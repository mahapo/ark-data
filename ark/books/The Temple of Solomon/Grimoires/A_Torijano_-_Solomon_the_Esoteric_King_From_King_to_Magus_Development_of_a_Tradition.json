The so-called \"rewritten Bible\" and \"para-biblical literature\" are the clearest and most explicit manifestations of this trend. We witness a parallel development based on the char-acters of the biblical stories and traditions. Patriarchs, kings, prophets and sinners again became the protagonists of Jewish texts in two ways: on the one hand, these new texts heralded, under the protective names of biblical figures, \"dubious\" theology, controversial halakah, revised ethics and exotic cosmology; biblical attributions brought respectability and authority to the texts. On the other hand, the figures themselves experienced a transformation, absorbing new traits and becoming altogether different characters from their biblical prototypes. On some occasions these new features were hinted at in the bib-lical tradition, triggering a change prefigured in the exegesis. Thus, the brief note in Genesis 5:24 about Enoch could have given birth to the development of his characterization as a seer of the secrets concerning the universe, the future of the world, and the course of human history, which produced in its last stage Enoch's transfor-mation to angelic status, as Metatron, in Hekhalot literature.1 Like-1 For an exhaustive study of this phenomenon of reinterpretation see J. L. Kugel, Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible as it was at the Start of the Common Era (Cam-bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998). However, it is quite difficult to see how the image of Enoch as the primordial sage that appears in Jub, 4:16-25 and in Sir 44:16 and in 1 Enoch itself could have been developed as an exegetical ex-trusion from Gen 5:22-24. On this and other problems about Enoch see M. E. Stone, \"The Book of Enoch and Judaism in the Third Century B.C.E.,\" CBQ40 (1978) 479-492; see also D. Dimant, \"Apocalyptic Texts at Qumran,\" in The Community of the Renewed Covenant: The Notre Dame Symposium on the Dead Sea Scrolls (eds. E. Ulrich and J. VanderKam; Christianity and Judaism in Antiquity Series"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"wise, in the hands of Philo the biblical figures became incarnations of virtue (Abraham), statesmanship (Joseph) and perfect legislation (Moses),2 whereas Artapanus made Abraham the father of astrolo-gy, Joseph the first surveyor and Moses the founder of the Egyptian animal cult.3 The biblical characters changed because the cultural and political environment, as well as the audiences to whom their examples were addressed, had changed. Among the biblical figures, Solomon underwent an especially radical adaptation to the new circumstances. Somehow his charac-ter was always \"problematic,\" since he was at the same time the wise king who built the Temple and the sinner indirectly responsible for the secession of the northern kingdom. Although because of this negative view the Chronicler felt compelled to belittle Solomon,s role in the building of the temple, his fame as an extraordinarily wise man endured and biblical wisdom literature was developed under his aegis. Thus, the image which emerged from the biblical tradi-tions was a mixed one, compounded of Solomon's quasi-divine knowledge and his sin. However, as the pseudepigrapha attributed to him show, his figure had a certain popularity in Second Temple literature. Yet, in contrast to the way he is represented in biblical literature, his reputation for wisdom is only secondary in the pseude-pigrapha, except for Wisdom of Solomon. After a relative period of oblivion in the two first centuries CE, Solomon became the exor-cist, the magician par excellence, acquiring extreme popularity in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. However, despite the appar-ent simplicity of the above view, many questions and problems re-main with regard to the exact origin, development and importance of these Solomonic traditions, as well as their impact on the every-day life of the people, either Jewish or Christian (whenever that dis-tinction was made), who transmitted and cherished them. Somehow, we will have to fill in the gaps in the proposed development, gaps 10; Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame, 1994) 175-195, who points out other possibilities and the great weight of independent development of the apoca-lyptic texts which are linked with Enoch. 2 See F. H. Colson, Philo VI (The Loeb Classical Library 289; Cambridge, MA / London; Harvard University Press, 1984) for texts and translations of De Abrahame, De Iosepho, De Vita Mosis. 3 For the texts and translation see C. R. Holladay, Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors (2 vols; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1983); for a discussion of the texts see D. L. Tiede, The Charismatic Figure as Miracle Worker (SBLDS 1; Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1972)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"that are due to the very nature of our material and sources. Accord-ingly, we must first of all define a method to be followed, the sourc-es to be studied and the problems to be addressed. SOLOMON IN THE JUDAISM OF LATE ANTIQUITY The principal aim of these pages was set out at the very beginning of this chapter: we are trying to understand the development of the figure of Solomon and the different characterizations it acquired throughout history and to ask what were the social, religious and historical settings that could lead to them. The brief overview we presented above seems to suggest a rather linear and simple devel-opment with some gaps which have yet to be filled in. However, the figure of the wise king and all the traditions attached to him prove to be more elusive than they seem. There are several causes for this state of affairs. We must deal with a rather extensive textual corpus, the contents of which include, on the one hand, the biblical books that are related to Solomon and the pseudepigrapha that mention him or that are attributed to him, and on the other hand, Greek, Latin and Hebrew amulets, Arama-ic bowls, magical papyri, exorcisms of diverse provenance, astrological texts, and some references in Gnostic tractates. To all this mass of material we could add the diverse characterizations of the king in rabbinic literature, a number of references by various Church Fa-thers, as well as some valuable material included in Early Byzan-tine chronographs. The size of the corpus alone would make the study difficult enough. But if we add the fact that the chronology of the corpus stretches from biblical times through the first seven centu-ries of our era, the difficulty increases considerably. Furthermore, both the extent of the corpus and its lengthy chronology indicate that the traditions contained in it, although at first sight related and from a common source, have been transmitted in very different cultural and religious settings and in several languages such as Hebrew, Aramaic, Latin, Greek, Armenian and Syriac. Therefore, the task of studying images of Solomon is quite difficult due to the sheer quantity of the texts that contain them. It is evident that some kind of guidelines or principles have to be established before attempting a deeper immersion into the texts regarding Solomon. The first of these rules is a logical consequence of the range of texts that depict Solomon: by no means may we claim"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"to be exhaustive in this study, since such a study can only be sys-tematic but not complete or definitive. In fact, many texts will es-cape our attention, because we are less interested in amassing texts or curious stories, than in interpreting them and in being able to establish a systematic treatment of the traditions about Solomon, so that we may understand them as well as the circumstances that gave rise to them. Furthermore, equal attention and depth of analysis will not be devoted to all texts; thus, the treatment of the biblical ma-terial, which would be an extensive subject in its own right, will be considered only as the starting point of our study. In the same way, some traditions, such as many of the developments contained in the rabbinic literature, will be studied only if related in a general way to our esoteric typology of Solomon. Finally, as the cultural bound-aries in Late Antiquity seem to be more permeable and loose than is commonly accepted, there has to be some freedom in the com-parison of parallels from different literatures and religions so that they may reciprocally shed light on their different settings and tra-ditions. The second rule that we will follow derives indirectly from the preceding comments on the size of the corpus and concerns its chronology: given the long period over which our texts were writ-ten, it seems necessary to fix some kind of temporal boundaries so that we can distinguish a chronological succession among the dif-ferent images of Solomon. However, there is an aspect that should be taken into account when fixing these temporal limits: the date of actual manuscripts and of their transmission is not a criterion for the internal dating of the traditions the texts contain. By external chronological limits we mean limits that will be fixed by consider-ations that are not imposed by the texts or traditions, so that they may work within a specific historical period. In the present study, we will take as the terminus post quern the redaction of the biblical writings concerned with Solomon, and as the terminus ante quern the seventh century CE, that is, the beginning of the Islamic conquest that brought about a partial halt to the cultural and historical continuity of the Mediterranean oikumene. These limits are formal, but they will help us to exclude the pre-history of the traditions on the one hand, and on the other, their development in the Middle Ages.4 However, texts that were transmitted and 4 In fact, Solomon had considerable success in many Christian and Islamic"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"reached their final state much later but that clearly preserve early traditions will be considered and their material studied, for exam-pie the early Byzantine chronographers and some mediaeval Greek works, which are reworkings of older material that may even go back to the first centuries of the Common Era. Unlike the temporal restriction that has been imposed on the textual corpus, no spatial limitation has been adopted with respect to the geographic origin or environment of the texts where Solomon is present in some way. This decision is motivated by the fact that the Mediterranean world, the Hellenistic oikumene, formed an inte-grated and common cultural continuum. To impose a clear-cut divi-sion between, for example, Hellenistic Judaism of the Diaspora and Palestinian Judaism of the Jewish homeland is artificial and intro-duces into research a distorting element that is imposed by our historical bias.5 Certainly there were distinctively Hellenistic prod-ucts in the Diaspora, such as the works of Philo or works like Joseph and Aseneth, but they are the extreme products of a spirit that was everywhere; and even they share many traits with the \"more\" Jew-ish exponents of the same spirit.6 Therefore, the texts do not allow such a distinction, nor would it be useful for our purposes. However, it seems clear that the foregoing methods are not pow-erful enough to address the study of Solomon in the Judaism of Late Antiquity, since they only give external shape to the mass of mate-rial that might be relevant. Consequently, we have to design some kind of structuring devices that will allow us to provide an overall order and system to the texts and the traditions they contain. Among the possible approaches, we have chosen to study the traditions con-cerning Solomon, dividing them according to the different images works in the Middle Ages. However, a lot of these texts are new developments that respond to specific circumstances of the Middles Ages. 5 We are aware that these views are very controversial, and many scholars dis-agree with them. Even a modern encyclopedia such as the Anchor Bible Dictionary (CD edition; ed. by D. N. Freedman; New York, Toronto, London: Doubleday, 1994) seems to reflect this division between Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism in the article \"Judaism.\" 6 Even in the case of Philo one might doubt that his work is so distinctively Hellenistic; on this aspect see the classic work of H. A. Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (2 vols; fifth edition; Cam-bridge, MA / London: Harvard University Press, 1982); see also E. R. Goodenough, The Jurisprudence of Jewish Courts in Egypt: Legal Administration by the Jews under the Early Roman Empire as Described by Philo Judaeus (New Haven: Yale University, 1929)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of the king that they present, so that a trajectory and typology of his character may be drawn from them. Second Temple Judaism has a clear tendency to categorize its interest in the figures of its historical or legendary past into three different groups:7 the first group is formed by those figures drawn from the past depicted by the biblical texts and traditions. This interest is centered on the figure itself and in its role in the people's legendary past.8 Here we have a clear and progressive manifesta-tion of the Hellenistic individualism that is crystallized in the inter-est in biographies of great personalities of the past, viewed as role models.9 Conversely, the second group centers around figures that are projected into the future, such as the figure of the perfect Da-vidic king of Psalm of Solomon 17 or of the messiah of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs; here the interest is not the past but the future and the role that those figures will have in that ideal future, although the figures themselves are drawn from the nation's past.10 The third group is formed by ideal and abstract types, that were \"generated by roles (real or fictional) within the Judaism of the day—visionary, wise man, martyr, charismatic, etc;\" again the past is the basis, ei-ther for reinterpreting a figure or for the creation of new types.11 We find this type of dialogue between past, present and future also in the traditions centered around the figure of Solomon; thus the characterization of Solomon as the \"son of David\" could be con-nected at the same time with the glorious past (the building of the Temple), the future (as ideal messianic figure) and the present (when exorcistic powers were viewed as attributes of Solomon as Son of David, and later on of Jesus as Son of David and Messiah). We shall see how the different figures of Solomon also establish this dialogue with time, from which a clear division of the material into two parts seems to evolve, a division that is also related to the ' On this categorization and the study of ideal figures in Second Temple Ju-daism, see J. J. Collins and G.W.E. Nickelsburg (eds.), Ideal Figures in Ancient Juda-ism: Profiles and Paradigms (Atlanta, GA: Scholar Press, 1980), 1-12.

Thus, in the first part, the wise king of the biblical writings and the Pseudepigrapha seems to point both to the glorious past and to reinterpret the present in the light of that past. The image of Solomon that opens up be-fore us is firmly anchored in this biblical past but is accommodated to the present. In the second part, the figures of Solomon again become abstract concepts, but this time extracted from the histor-ical present and with no clear relation to the biblical past. As we shall see, Solomon becomes more than a mere powerful and wise king; he embodies several esoteric figures endowed with special power. We shall search for the reasons for the characterization of the second part in ancient traditions that were not directly linked with Scripture. Thus, the Solomon that is reflected in the biblical writings is clearly a Jewish figure who was understood in Jewish and Semitic terms; the figure that appears in Second Temple literature offers some changes due to new circumstances and is therefore re-interpreted in new terms that can be considered non-Jewish at or-igin, although they eventually became Jewish along with the new interpretation. To a certain extent, many of these new traits of Solomon, which will be described in the second part of our work, seem to be Jewish adaptations of material (especially magical and esoteric material) that were part of the world view of Late Antiqui-ty as a whole.12 This material is Jewish to the extent that its adop-tion to characterize Solomon witnesses an \"acquired Jewishness,\" at least in some very Hellenized communities. Accordingly, we will divide the material into a first part that will be introduced by an assessment of the Solomon of the Bible and that will then deal with his development in some Pseudepigrapha; in the second part we will deal with the \"esoteric\" Solomon. This second part will tell us much about the social and religious setting in which the esoteric characterization of Solomon originated and from which it was transmitted and cherished. It seems to respond much more to the everyday life and concerns of Late Antiquity, and in view of the long-term popularity that some of these traditions had, also to the everyday life of much later times. 12 The traditions about Solomon as exorcist seem to be earlier and to have a development more linked with early Jewish traditions, as texts such as 11QjPsAp3 (11Q.11) seem to suggest."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO SOLOMON THE KING IN THE HEBREW BIBLE INTRODUCTION The natural basis for any attempt to study the development of a figure from the biblical past in Second Temple Judaism has necessarily to be the portrait that the Hebrew Bible presents. Solomon is a major biblical figure; a great deal of the first book of Kings is centered around his wisdom and his greatest success, the building of the Temple. In the same way, several biblical books were attributed to him, a clear example of pseudepigraphical attribution. In the fol-lowing pages we will study these biblical texts, in order to be able to understand the images of Solomon in the Hebrew Bible and to assess the extent to which they established a framework for the image of Solomon that was to emerge afterwards in Late Antiquity. There-fore, in the following pages we attempt to lay a foundation from which to launch our study of Solomonic traditions in Late Antiqui-ty, and not to make an exhaustive study of the biblical material per se. Brevity and clarity will be our main tenets and aims in this pre-liminary part of the study. SOLOMON IN THE BOOK OF KINGS a. Solomon the Divinely Appointed Successor of David The first mention of Solomon in the Bible is 2 Sam 12:24. It narrates the birth of the second son of king David, who is called Solomon by David andjedidiah by Nathan.1 In this passage, the historian of 1 2 Sam 14:24-25. All the quotations of the Bible follow the translation of the Tanakh: A New Translation of The Holy Scriptures According to the Traditional Hebrew Text (Philadelphia / Jerusalem: The Jewish Publication Society, 1985); for the Apocry-pha and Deuterocanonical books we shall use The Oxford Study Bible (ed by M.Jack et al.; New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). It seems that the name Solomon means \"his replacement\" referring to the first child of David and Bathsheba; on this passage see P. K. McCarter, Jr., II Samuel{ AB 9; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1984) 302-304, 307-309."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the succession writes an introduction to the future events that will lead to the taking of power by the son of Bathsheba. The entire account of the succession is organized around the deeds of God: ־a) YHWH was displeased by David's faults (2 Sam 11:27); b) YHWH loved Solomon (2 Sam 12:24); and c) YHWH punished Absalom (2 Sam 17:14). Nathan's Oracle (2 Sam 7), in which there is a wordplay based on the double meaning of the term ΓΓ3 (\"temple\" / \"dynasty\"), can be applied to Solomon.3 YHWH appears here as a dynastic god and there are clear deuteronomistic traits;4 these traits point to Solomon as the heir who will enjoy divine favor and protection. Thus, in these first texts that seem to refer to Solomon, his image as divinely appointed successor of David is clearly more positive that was to be the case afterwards (1 Kgs 11); Solomon is the \"Son of David\" loved by God (2ידידיה; Sam'12:24).5 The actual role of Solomon in the events surrounding the succession to the throne of David varies according to the different editors and layers of the text, with different, and often clearly opposite, images of Solomon appearing, a tendency that will continue afterwards, as we shall see in several later Jewish writings that mention the king. In 1 Kgs 1, Solomon is depicted as the puppet of two political factions fighting for the throne, the true protagonists being David, Bathsheba, Nathan and Adonijah with their respective supporters. In 1 Kgs 2, Solomon is depicted as a dynast avant la lettre, an oriental monarch who is far from the idealized and legendary king who materializes in the following chapters. According to Langlamet, we can distinguish two editors in these chapters,1' the first showing a marked anti-Solomonic bias, the second, and later, expanding the earlier version and legitimizing Solomon's accession to power. For both editors, Solomon displays his wisdom 2 See H. Cazelles, Introduccion crítica al Antiguo Testamente (Barcelona: Herder, 1989), 322. 3 See McCarter, II Samuel, 190-231. 4 See O. Eissfeldt, The Old Testament. An Introduction (trans, by P. R. Ackroyd; Oxford: Blackwell, 1974), 270, 274-279; for Eissfeldt the deuteronomistic ideas are quite evident: \"...the favourite Deuteronomistic ideas were introduced, as, for example (...) 2 Sam 7, with its pointer to Solomon's temple building (270).\" 5 The oracle of Nathan (2 Sam 7) and the texts of Kings are linked by several references to the theme of the peace / safety, which was also to be incorporated in Chronicles.

Although the first stratum of the account is quite old, it has been modified following Deuteronomistic ideas.14 In addition, the final edition of the dream seems to follow traditional patterns common to different monarchies of the ancient Near East: judicial wisdom, namely, the capacity for discerning between just and unjust and being able to judge, is a fundamental characteristic of the ideal king.15 The central point of the whole episode is the petition for wisdom, although this plea is not in absolute terms the beginning of the wisdom tradition linked with Solomon. As we have seen already, the Succession Narrative mentions this wisdom tradition, but at Gibeon it appears in a clear and definite way. Thus, the principal story (1 Kgs 3:6-14) introduces a theme of divine-dynastic alliance in which David is the kernel. The alliance is between David and YHWH and by extension between his successor and YHWH; as a result of this alliance, wisdom is graciously awarded by God to Solomon. Closely related to the theme of wisdom is that of the people's numrical strength (1 Kgs 3:8-9), which also appears in Deuteronomy 4 is closely related.

The wisdom requested from, and the additional things awarded by the divinity, show how in the figure of Solomon two different conceptions of monarchy are combined; the first one corresponds to the traditional conception, the second reinterprets the figure of the king from a radically new point of view. Thus, Solomon represents the prototype of a king touched by divine grace. Around the petition of \"judicial\" wisdom two different traditions, the monarchical and the patriarchal, are combined. Solomon is characterized as the heir of the royal ideology and as a leader in the image of Moses; this leader is both judge and administrator.19 Thus, we see how the historical Solomon, whoever he might be, has been reinterpreted and idealized in very definite ways by the Deuteronomistic editor. This idealization becomes evident in the inclusion of a learned re-elaboration of a popular tale or legend about the judgment of the two prostitutes (1 Kgs 3:16), as proof of Solomon's divine judicial wisdom,'20 and in the list of officials of 1 Kgs 4, as a practical exposition of administrative and pragmatic 16 Gen 21:22-24; 2 Sam 10:2; 1 Sam 20:14-16; for extra-biblical parallels see, Pritchard, ANET, 200a and 202ab.

In 1 Kgs 5:9-13 the wisdom of Solomon is described in \"intel-lectual\" and \"encyclopedic\" terms; although such information could represent an aspect of early annals or tales and could even have functioned as an introduction to a collection of such tales that were subsequently lost, it is most likely that such information about the wisdom of Solomon was popular.22 The analysis of the various terms used in 1 Kgs 5:9-14 seems to point in this direction: thus, 1) תבונה Kgs 5:9) is quite rare in pre-exilic writings but very common in Proverbs; the expression 1)K רחב לב gs 5:9) appears in Proverbs as well; the verb חכם appears 27 times but almost always in post-exilic texts; the names Ethan, Heman and Chalkol are also found in 1 Chr 2:6 and Ps 88:1. We may assume, then, that the text is clearly post-deuteronomistic.23 The development of the tradition about the wisdom of Solomon in Kings could have been as follows: a) the wisdom of a successful leader, representing a pre-deutero-nomistic stage (1 Kgs 2:1-2, 5-4, 5:15-26); b) wisdom as the capacity to distinguish between just and unjust, representing the deuterono-mistic stage (1 Kgs 3:4-15, 16-28); c) wisdom, as represented by encyclopedic knowledge, representing a post-deuteronomistic and later development.24 One characterization that could be derived from 1 Kings 5 is that of universal king or king of kings. In fact, the figure of Solomon as universal ruler prevails over the characterization of Solomon as wise man, since the chapter is structured on the pattern of a ring-composition, according to which the introductory themes are taken up again at the end of the unit. Thus, in 1 Kgs 5:1 the universal dominion of Solomon is acknowledged and in the same way at 1 Kgs 5:14 the submission of all the kings of the earth is clearly stated.

Besides the characterization of Solomon as king of kings and wise man, he is depicted as principally responsible for the building of the Temple, for which he took all the necessary steps, as described in 1 Kgs 5:15-7. In these chapters, Solomon the architect acquires preeminence and takes centre stage; every other characterization is subordinated to his role as the chosen builder of the temple. Solomon finishes his duty as builder of the temple with a prayer and supplication to God (1 Kgs 8); they are in effect the consecration of the Temple. The divine answer to Solomon's prayer is a second apparition. In fact, the whole deuteronomistic redaction of 1 Kgs 3-11 is organized around the two theophanies of 1 Kings 3 and 1 Kings 9; the second theophany has been completely reworked following deuteronomistic ideas. In this second dream (1 Kgs 9) all the evil things that will occur if the divine will (as understood in Deuteronomic terms, following Deut 17:16-17) is not fulfilled are narrated; as Solomon multiplies transgressions (1 Kgs 10:27-28, 11:3), the second dream has a premonitory character.21' Again we have a theological transformation of historical sources and actual facts; Solomon becomes a sinner and is responsible for the division of Israel andjudah (1 Kgs II).27 c.

SOLOMON THE KING IN 2 CHRONICLES a. Introduction We have just seen how the various traits of the character of Solomon in Kings correspond to a process of idealization that is complex and was developed relatively early. The Chronicler realized a similar work of adaptation of his sources, principally the book of 1 Kings, so that a new picture of Solomon emerges, a figure that responds to the changing interests and situations of a new historical period.28 The books of Chronicles present several problems in respect of their sources, date of composition, authorship, and ideology. However, what concerns us here is the ideology of the Chronicler and how it affects later treatment of Solomon. As the date of composition of the books is clearly post-exilic, we will be able to discern how the figure of the wise king was understood at the beginning of the Second Temple period. b. Solomon in 2 Chronicles 2-11 The figure of King Solomon in Chronicles has undergone a radical transformation, with the Chronicler having systematically reworked his sources. The same facts are narrated, but some material has been 28 On the ideology developed in the books of Chronicles see S. Japhet, The Ideology of the Books of Chronicles and its Place in Biblical Thought (BEATAJ 8; Frank-furt, Paris, Bern, New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1988); on the book in general see J. M. Myers, II Chronicles (AB 13; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1965) 3-60; R. B. Dillard, II Chronicles (WBC; Waco, TX: Word, 1987); P. R. Ackroyd, \"The Chronicler as Exegete,\" JSOT 2 (1977) 2-32."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"left out and different models have been used to configure a new view of David and Solomon. The description of both kings is so interlinked that it is quite difficult to understand either figure independently of the other. Even a cursory reading of the material shows that there has been a whitewash of \"troublesome\" details of the life and activity of both kings and how the dynasty that rises from them is the repository of the author's hopes of a messianic restoration. Thus, there is no mention of David's problems with Saul (cf 1 Sam 16-30), or oflsrael as divided at the beginning of his reign (2 Sam 1:1-5:3); according to the Chronicler, all David's activities were focussed on the preparations that would make possible the construction of the Temple by his son Solomon.29 Solomon, too, is depicted in positive terms and is also clearly related to the building of the Temple.311 However, this change of image, although favorable, is not flattering, since aspects that are fundamental in Kings, such as the inclusive conception of wisdom applied to Solomon, his good administration and the idealization of the king, are not so emphasized. The figure of Solomon loses some of its lustre by leaving aside the exploits of the idealized reign described in 2 Kings 3-11; in Chronicles all the positive traits flow into the building of the Temple. The wisdom of Solomon is impoverished and is transformed into the wisdom displayed in building the temple.31 Apparently the Chronicler used a refined redaction technique in his treatment of Solomon, employing a series of defined models to characterize the king.32 According to these models Solomon is viewed as a second David chosen by God (1 Chr 28:5-6, 10; 29:1) and 29 Cf 1 Chr 11:4-9 (the capture of Jerusalem, the future site of the Temple, is David's first act as king); 1 Chr 16:4-7, 37-42 (reorganization of the ranks of priests and levites); 1 Chr 22:1 (designation of the site of the Temple after a sign from YHWH); 1 Chr 22:2-5; 29:2-5 (preparation of materials for the building of the Temple). 30 1 Chr 29:23-25 (unanimous acclamation of Solomon), 2 Chr 2:2-16 (prepa-rations for the building of the Temple); 2 Chr 5:2-14. ,י Only the dream at Gibeon (2 Chr 1:7-12) with the excursus about the rich-ness and power of Solomon (2 Chr 1:14-17) does not seem to agree with this ten-dency; however, it is quite evident that the Chronicler's version of the dream is simplified, and that many ideological nuances concerning kingship and its char-acteristics have been omitted. Furthermore, whereas 1 Kgs 3:12 emphasizes the theme of wisdom, 2 Chr 1:12 combines it with the gifts of wealth, therefore some-how diminishing the importance of the principal award, wisdom. The story about the Queen of Sheba (2 Chr 9:1-12) mingles both themes. 32 See Dillard, II Chronicles, 2-4."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"considered by God to be David's successor (1 Chr 22:7-10; 28:6). In some aspects he appears more idealized than David (1 Chr 21; 1 Chr 13; 1 Chr 11:17). It seems that every one of these changes parallels the succession of Moses and Joshua, considered by the Chronicler to be the paradigm for his view of the succession of David and Solomon. Both schemes of succession start with the failure of the first leaders, Moses and David, since Moses does not achieve the possession of the land, nor does David build the temple (Deut 1:17-38; 31:2-8; 1 Chr 22:5-13; 28:2-8). These failures are linked directly to the achievement of their successors, Joshua and Solomon. Their access to power and authority is linked to the repetition of terms that emphasize the theme of the repose (peace, tranquility) 53 awarded by God, in direct contrast with the agitated times of their predecessors.54 c. Conclusions What, then, is the image of Solomon that appears in Chronicles? It is an image that is more closely related to David than it was in Kings. For the Chronicler, Solomon is the builder of the Temple and information concerning his power and wealth (2 Chr 1:14-17; 2 Chr: 1-12; 13-29) is included, without the negative considerations attached by the Deuteronomic redaction in Kings. However, the fact that the material concerning the \"mundane\" exploits of Solomon is grouped into two definite units makes it clear that the Chronicler included them for the sake of his characterization of Solomon; he did indeed idealize Solomon as the perfect king, but he did so by depicting him as the ideal Jewish king for the Jewish people, as the king that should be sought and expected, and not as the universal king that appears in Kings. The inclusion of the story about the Queen of Sheba (2 Chr 9:1-33 Josh 11:23, 21:44; 1 Chr 22:8-9. The Chronicler insists on the image of Solomon as a man of peace and on the image of his reign as a period of peace, in contrast to David's reign. Depriving a king of military propaganda is quite un-usual in the Bible; on this aspect see S. Maier, \"The King as Warrior in Samuel-Kings,\" Hebrew Annual Review 13 (1991), 63-76. The linking of Solomon with peace will become a lasting trait of his image in later writing, with only a partial excep-tion in Josephus' Jewish Antiquities. 34 On the existence of these models and on the transformation of Solomon in Chronicles, see S. Abramsky, \"The Chronicler's View of King Solomon,\" Eretz Israel 16 (1982), 2-14 (Hebrew); R. Braun, \"Solomon the Chosen Temple Builder. The Significance of 1 Chr 22, 28 and 29 for the Theology of Chronicles,\" JBL 95 (1976), 581-590; on the overall structure of the text, see R. B. Dillard, \"The Lit-erary Structure of the Chronicler's Solomon Narrative,\" JSOT 30 (1984), 85-93."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"12) is surprising given the primary interest of the Chronicler in describing Solomon as the builder of the Temple; this material, as well as the narrative referring to Solomon's wealth (2 Chr 1:14-17; 9:13-29), points more to the idealized universal monarch of Kings than to the Jewish king of Chronicles. Quite likely that it was introduced because by the date of composition of Chronicles the story had already become so popular that it could not be omitted. This indicates how other traditions about Solomon, both biblical and non-biblical, could and did exist in parallel to the Solomon of the biblical writings, traditions that even a systematic theological reworking, such as the one by the Chronicler, could not ignore. The Solomon of the Chronicler is less legendary, but at the same time less historical, than the Solomon in Kings. He is a chosen leader, the builder of the temple and the Jewish king par excellence. As we shall see, this positive tendency towards Solomon would continue, initially, in various writings of the Second Temple Period. SOLOMON IN PSALMS The figure of Solomon in the book of Psalms is not a particularly important one. However, two psalms are attributed to him: Psalm 72 (LXX 71) and Psalm 127 (LXX 126). a. Psalm 72 It is quite likely that the ascription to Solomon of this psalm originated from the association of the word \"peace\" (•טלו, Ps 72:7) with the king's name and the images of glory that the text depicts with the portrait of Solomon in Kings. This Psalm is defined as a royal Psalm.30 There are three different approaches among scholars concerning the understanding and explanation of this Psalm: a) the Psalm can be understood as a composition of royal enthronement, the style of which is clearly influenced by the royal ideology that is common to the cultures of 35 On this Psalm, its interpretation and the different approaches to it see, J. Brière, \"Solomon dans les Psaumes,,י Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible XI (1987), cols 456-458; J. M. Carrière, \"Le Ps 72 est-il un psaume messianique?,,י Bib 72 (1991), 46-69; M. Dahood, Psalms II, 51-100 (AB; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1968), 178-185; H.J. Kraus, Los Salmos.

If the psalm was reworked in post-exilic times and it was then that the ascription to Solomon was made, it is quite probable that Solomon was considered by this time as the model for the ideal king of the future and, therefore, his image could convey some messianic overtones. We would have, then, during the Second Temple period two conflicting images of Solomon, that of pious builder of the Temple and that of the triumphant and powerful king.3'' Both images would survive in later writings, but that of the model king, with its possible messianic overtones, seems to have a place in the later development of the messianic traits that the title \"son of David\" linked with Solomon; these traits were acquired in the first century CE when Christians and Jews established a polemical competition between Solomon and Jesus. 36 Thus Ps 72:10 / Is. 60:7-8, Zech 9:10. 3' Several parallels could be established between Psalm 72 and the first book of Kings: Ps 72:2 = 1 Kgs 3:28 (judging with justice); Ps 72:3, 7 = 1 Kgs 4:20, 5:4-5 (peace); Ps 72:8 = 1 Kgs 5:4 (extension of the kingdom); Ps 72:10 = 1 Kgs 5:1 (the tribute of foreign rulers); Ps 72:10 = 1 Kgs 10:1-2 (the gifts of the Queen of Sheba). As seems evident, the Psalm shows special interest in the notices about the power and wealth of Solomon and omits any mention of the Temple or of the king's sins. 38 Ps 72:4, 12-14. 39 This last point could support the hypothesis of a post-exilic reworking of the Psalm, since we can suppose that the editor longed for a model king but not for a Temple, since there already was a Temple. Perhaps for similar reasons the figure of Solomon as builder of the Temple is so important for the Chronicler."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"b. Psalm 127 This psalm is included among the so-called \"songs of ascents.\"40 Except for the present psalm and two others attributed to David, they usually do not have attributions; so it is difficult to explain why it was attributed to Solomon during the post-exilic period. The psalm can be divided into two parts, one about the futility of human toil if YHWH does not support it (Ps 127:1-2) and another about the blessing of numerous progeny (Ps 127:3-5). It seems that there is a word play between the two senses of the term תיב (\"house\" / \"lineage, family\"). Perhaps Nathan's Oracle (2 Samuel 7) is alluded to here; if so, then the building of a house is a metaphor for the building of the temple and \"to have numerous offspring\" is a metaphor for the Davidic lineage. The kernel of the psalm is the word !ידי (\"loved one\") which could be seen as an allusion to Solomon's second name, Jedidiah.41 It is clear that the principal link of the present text with the Solomonic traditions is its attribution to King Solomon; this attribution seems to be late and adds nothing to the image of Solomon presented in Chronicles or Kings. We have here, then, an example of where pseudepigraphy does not affect the structure of a composition since the alleged author does not play an integral part in it.

Introduction These three compositions comprise the biblical sapiential corpus that is most probably linked with a wisdom school related to the figure of the wise King Solomon, defender of the poor and weak (1 Kgs 3-11; Ps 72).42 We group these three works together because they clearly show the success of the Solomonic attribution in a part of the Bible that was fixed and edited more or less definitively during 40 On this Psalm see, M.

Scott, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes (AB; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1965); Tremper Longman III, The Book of Ecclesiastes (NICOT; Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1998); C. L.

Besides the coincidence in their date of final edition, they share another trait; at some moment in the history of Bible transmission all three works were viewed as suspect in respect of their canonicity. This detail could be significant since it seems that all three works were saved in extremis because of their attribution to Solomon.43 All three writings show a tangential connection with the figure of Solomon: the entire book of Proverbs, as well as the two collections that are directly attributed to the king are connected with Solomon because of the legendary fame of his wisdom;44 Song of Songs could be connected with Solomon because of his love of women (1 Kgs 11:1) and perhaps because of the mention of the 'Shulammite' (Song of Songs 7:1); Qoheleth was linked with the king because of its beginning (Qoh. 1:1, \"Son of David\") and its sapiential contents. b. The Texts The whole book of Proverbs is attributed to Solomon in 1:1 (\"The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel\"). This pseudepigraphical motif is glossed in the following seven verses. In this gloss, there are several expressions that recall the image of Solomon in the book of Kings (1 Kgs 5:9). The epicenter of this gloss is 1:6 (\"for understanding proverb and epigram, the words of the wise and their riddles\") which seems to refer to 1 Kgs 5:12 and 1 Kgs 10:1. These first seven verses are a compendium of the gifts that God awarded to Solomon through wisdom. It is probable that the editor of the whole book was also the author of Prov 1-9.45 The R. Ν Whybray, Wisdom in Proverbs (Studies in Biblical Theology; London: SCM, 1965); M. H. Pope, Song of Songs (AB; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1977): L. Daniel, Le plus beau chant de la Création: Commentaire du Cantique des Cantiques (LD 51; Paris: Ed. du Cerf, 1968); R. E. Murphy, The Song of Songs: A Commentary on the Book of Canticles or the Song of Songs (Hermeneia Commentaries; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990). 43 The formation of the canon of the Jewish Bible was not simple; however, in this particular case, the fact that three sapiential books attributed to Solomon were regarded on some occasions as dubious could be more important that it seems at first sight. On this difficult question see, J. Trebolle Barrera, La Biblia judiay la Biblia cristiana. Introducciôn a la historia de la Biblia (Madrid: Trotta, 1993), 159-184; see also R. Beckwith, The Old Testament Canon of the New Testament Church and its Background in Early Judaism (London: SPCK, 1985). 44 See the introduction to both collections: Prov 10:1, 25:1. 45 So P.

From this basis, he added the traditional epithets of wise and just, but the main motive for the attribution was Solomon's dual role as king and Son of David. The attribution is repeated again in 10:1 and 25:1, where two new collections of sayings that seem to deal with some aspect of the king's behavior are introduced; these two collections are a compendium of royal wisdom, referring to politics, administration and life in general, which seems to reflect the image of Solomon in 1 Kgs 5:12.47 The book of Song of Songs is also a post-exilic work, although it incorporates older elements.48 The name of Solomon appears several times in the text.49 The basis for the attribution could be the mention tion, 1971), 15-26. For this author the numerical value of the names ofSolomon (375), David (14) and Israel (541) would support the hypothesis; this value would function as the link between the different parts of the book, the total extent of which is 932 lines (375+14+541=930). 46 However, D. Dimant (\"Pseudonymity in the Wisdom of Solomon,\" in N. Fernández Marcos [ed.] La Septuaginta en la investigaciôn contemporânea [V Congress IOSCS; Madrid: CSIC, 1985], 243-253, esp. 245) says that there are \"...two main types of pseudonymity current in ancient Jewish literature. The first found mostly in biblical books, employs titles as a means of pseudonymic attribution, without affecting the actual structure or content of the work. An example of this is the attribution to Solomon of the major part of Proverbs. Such attributions may have been made by later editors or compilers. The second type of pseudonymity, used by most of Jewish Pseudepigrapha, is organic to the original framework and thus constitutes an integral part of the work. Consequently, in compositions using this second type, pseudonymity is invested with formal as well as ideological functions.\" According to this perspective, the pseudepigrapical attribution of Proverbs 1:1-7 has no formal and ideological functions; however if we take into account the fact that the attribution confers a unity to the whole book as it actually stood before its final editor, it is clear that it has such functions, and although not organic to the different collections that form the text, it is organic to the final stage. Some-how, the attribution to Solomon, the wise king, is the thread that holds together the whole work. Therefore, the division of pseudepigraphy into two types may sometimes lead to confusion, because we are now interested in dealing with the final stage of works, in which the attribution plays quite an important role. 4' As we have seen this image is considered late; on this see R. B. Y. Scott, \"Solomon and the Beginnings of Wisdom,\" 84-101. 48 The book can be dated around the fourth century BCE. 49 Song of Songs 1:5; 3:7, 9, 11; 8:11-12.

In Song of Songs 1:1-3, there is a word play based on the terms \"peace\" (שלום) and \"name\" (•ש) that also occurs in Psalm 72 and at 1 Chr 22:9. In Song of Songs 7:1, the name of the Shulammite is a possible allusion to 1 Kgs 1:3. The fact that the male protagonist of the epithalamium (nuptial song) is described as a king is noted by some scholars as a further reason for the attribution to Solomon.50 In contrast with Song of Songs and Proverbs, Qohelet is not directly attributed to Solomon, that is, his name does not appear in the actual text. Qoh 1:1 (\"The words of Qoheleth, Son of David, king in Jerusalem\") and in Qoh 1:12 (\"I, Qoheleth, was king in Jerusalem over Israel\") seem to be the basis for Solomonic attribution at an early date.51 The point is that the royal title and the \"Son of David\" formula, which seem to have been naturally linked with Solomon, would be viewed then as referring to the king and the Son of David par excellence. Besides, the reference to the wisdom of Qoheleth (1:16-17) points in the same direction. c. Summary The principal trait that all the three works share is their attribution to Solomon. As the sapiential contents are not common to all, this attribution was not necessarily and primarily made on the ground of Solomon's fame as a wise man, but on his fame as king. Somehow Solomon is depicted first as king, and only later and secondarily as wise king.52 The repetition of the title \"Son of David\" seems to suggest that this formula was virtually identified with Solomon at an early date. As we shall see, this identification was to acquire different associations in later times. SOLOMON AS SON OF DAVID IN THE HEBREW BIBLE Despite its later importance, the title \"Son of David\" is not frequent in the Hebrew Bible and, most importantly, it does not have messianic overtones. Only on one occasion is it used without referring 50 A king appears in Song 1:4, 12; 7:6 51 The approximate date of composition of Qoheleth is 250-225 BCE, although there have been some attempts to date it even later. 52 Proverbs is a clear exception, since both traits are totally intertwined."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"to Solomon;53 other than this, all the references are to Solomon and late (1 Chr 29:22; 2 Chr 1:1; 13:6; 30:26; 35:3). In Prov 1:1 and Qoh 1:1, Solomon or the \"Son of David\" is connected with wisdom literature. In Chronicles, the title \"Son of David\" functions as a principle of legitimization and characterization of the figure of Solomon. Both the name of the king and the title form an expression that has to be considered as a unit. On two occasions (2 Chr 30:26, 35:3) the pair Solomon / Son of David is supplemented by the title \"king of Israel.\" Thus, from Chronicles on, it seems that Solomon was depicted as the Son of David, and the expression was transformed into a synonym for the king. In Prov 1:1 and Qoh 1:1 the title again occurs together with the expression \"king of Israel\", which in Qoh 1:1 reinforces the pseudepigraphic attribution to Solomon provided by the title \"Son of David.\" In Qoheleth there is no direct mention of Solomon, so the combination of the two titles (Son of David, king in Jerusalem) together with the sapiential content support the attribution; thus the mechanisms of pseudepigraphical attribution are clearly at work. It has been said above that in the Old Testament the expression \"Son of David\" is not a messianic title. In fact, the descendents of David are not referred to by the title \"Son of David.\" Therefore, in all these post-exilic texts the use of the title \"son of David\" is a way of referring to the figure of the wise king Solomon. In Chronicles there is an apologetic effort to link the figure of Solomon more closely with that of David; in Proverbs and Qohelet the only interest is the pseudepigraphical attribution which is facilitated by the references contained in Kings to the legendary wisdom of Solomon.54 53 In 2 Sam. 13:1, the title refers to Absalom. 54 See 1 Kg 5:9-14. Regarding the beginnings of the tradition about Solomon and his wisdom, see R. B. Y. Scott, \"Solomon and the Beginnings of Wisdom,\" 84-101; K. Berger, \"Die königlichen Messiastraditionen des Neuen Testaments,\" NTS 20 (1973), 1-44, suggests that miracle working is to be seen as part of having wisdom, and that we have a \"titular\" use of the \"Son of David\" formula in these wisdom books. However see the criticism of D. C. Duling, in \"Solomon, Exor-cism, and the Son of David,\" HTR 68 (1975), 235-252, esp. 237, n. 11: \"the at-tempt to reduce NT Messianology to the complex of wisdom is too extreme and the designation of 'Son of David' in wisdom books as a specific title is not con-vincing. Berger's study brings forward the wisdom associations and raises the is-sue of the overlapping of 'titular' and 'not-titular' uses of 'Son of David'.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS The image of Solomon the king that emerges from the various biblical texts is always one which has clear Semitic roots, and is clearly understandable within the world view of Israelites first and Jews afterwards. The concepts of great king and wise man par excellence, in ancient Near Eastern terms, are embodied in Solomon, although the transformation of some of these traits and the different evaluation of the king in the various theological interpretations of the texts provided a basis for the later development of the figure of Solomon. The biblical texts allow a multiple reading of Solomon; he is portrayed first and foremost as a king, to which multiple adjectives (wise, rich, powerful, etc.) can be added. The different texts project differing judgments of the king, an appraisal that from the very beginning oscillated between approval and disapproval. Thus, if the deuteronomist edition of Kings condemns the figure of the king, despite all his successes, the later vision of Chronicles is positive. As we shall see, this oscillation remains and allows for considerable development of traditions centered on the king. Equally, in later times the characterization of Solomon as king will remain central, but will be enriched with details for which there are no roots in the biblical soil. It is quite likely that the wisdom tradition linked with Solomon from early times, as the attribibution of Proverbs shows, functioned as a sort of catalyst in the process; the similarities between some exorcistical formulae related to Solomon and traditional wisdom forms support this hypothesis. The use of the title \"Son of David\" in the Hebrew Bible is rather narrowly defined and quite limited in its ap-plication, working either to strengthen the characterization of So-lomon as legitimate heir to David or to attribute a text pseudepi-graphically to the wise king."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE SOLOMON THE HELLENISTIC KING IN SECOND TEMPLE LITERATURE INTRODUCTION In the preceding pages we have seen how the image of King Solomon was shaped in several biblical books; first of all, Solomon was de-picted as king and Son of David. He was seen as a very special king endowed with extraordinary gifts and abilities that resulted from the divine wisdom he possessed. Although the post-exilic biblical books focused their attention on an idealized figure of King Solomon, to some extent the Jewish writings of the Second Temple period modified this trend.1 As we shall see, they were also interested in the role of Solomon as king, but they reinterpreted the figure of Solomon in the light of the newly formed Hellenistic monarchies and their royal representatives. Solomon is viewed as a βασιλεύς and every event of his reign is narrated and interpreted accordingly. Thus, the Greek version of Kings and the works of Ben Sira, Eupolemus andjosephus describe and characterize Solomon from this new perspective, although they vary in the degree to which they adapt the figure of Solomon to the new model. In the following pages we will study each of the texts in order to highlight their different approaches to Solomon. We will begin with the hellenized image of King Solomon provided by the LXX, which gives several clues to understanding later developments in hellenized Jewish settings. We will then examine the Wisdom of Ben Sira in order to see whether it exhibits any development in the image of Solomon between the Hebrew original of around the 180 BCE and the Greek translation of 132 BCE. This dating of the Hebrew original and of its Greek translation is close to the date of the Greek translation of the Hebrew books of Kings, a fact that could help us to understand better the development of the figure of Solomon at a given time and place. Finally, we will study some 1 On this literature, see M.

SOLOMON AS HELLENISTIC KING IN LXX The Septuagint (LXX) constitutes one of the greatest achievements of the Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period; it represents the biblical text that was used by many Greek-speaking Jewish com-munities of both the Diaspora and the homeland as canonical, in-spired and authorized, until it was eventually abandoned because of its use, as Scripture, in Early Christianity. This Jewish transla-tion was made in different places (mostly Egypt and Palestine) and at different times, approximately from the mid-third century to the first century BCE.2 The Septuagint can be used for research into the Jewish Bible and the Judaism of the Second Temple Period for two reasons: on the one hand it furnishes us with Greek translations of a Hebrew text that is sometimes different from that of the Masoretic tradition, that is, it has a text-critical value for our knowledge of pre-masoretic Hebrew texts; on the other hand, it furnishes an exegetical tradi-tion that is at work in the translation itself, which reflects herme-neutical techniques and theological traditions that were alive within Hellenistic Judaism.3 To a certain extent, the LXX can be viewed as the principal manifestation of Hellenistic Judaism, since it reflects the reworking of theology and thought in the light of hellenization.4 2 Our knowledge of the development of the LXX is rather meagre and blurred; on this aspect see G. Dorival, \"L'achèvement des Septante dans le judaïsme. De la faveur au rejet,\" in La Bible Grecque des Septante, 83-1 11. 3 We have stated in the General Introduction that, strictu sensu, all Judaism of the Second Temple period could be defined as hellenized to different degrees. However, when we speak of Hellenistic Judaism we are referring to the Judaism that was developed within a Greek setting such as the great metropolis of Alexandria or in similar cities of the Hellenistic world of Late Antiquity, where Hellenization made deep inroads into the heart of Judaism. 4 On this aspect, see N. Fernández Marcos, Introduction a las versiones griegas, 307-321. One must be careful not to force 011 the text Hellenistic ideas and concepts when they are not there; examples of this flaw are to be found in P. Lefevre, \"Salomon et Bacchus,\" in C. E. Cox (ed.), VII Congress of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (SBLSCS 31; Leuven: 1989), 313-323."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Traditionally there has been a clear divergence of opinion about the value of the LXX biblical text. For some scholars any variation with respect to the Hebrew text could reflect an alternative Hebrew Vorlage for which the only witness extant would be the Greek text of the LXX. For others most of the variants that exist in the LXX are due to its midrashic character and so do not reflect a different Hebrew text, but rather the interpretation and understanding of the same text within the community that produced the Greek translation. According to this view, the LXX would then be \"the oldest of our preserved Midrashim.\"5 The Greek translation of 1 Kings (3 King-doms) is a clear example of the dichotomy we have just mentioned; textually speaking the historical books (1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings) have a Hebrew Vorlage that is very different from the Masoretic Hebrew text, a Vorlage that could be considered as older than the one pre-served by the Masoretic text because the Hebrew Masoretic texts of Kings is especially corrupt. Conversely, some of these variants, especially the ones formed by the so-called miscellanies (textual in-sertions), have been considered by some authors as examples of a midrashic-like activity by the translators of the Hebrew original.(> 5 So S. Liebermann, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1950), 50; other authors have insisted on the \"targumic\" character of the LXX and the influence of traditional Jewish hermeneutics; see M.

Fernández Marcos, Introduction a las versiones griegas de la Biblia, 107-111. On the \"midrashic approach\" to the text of Kingdoms see D. W.

Rather, we will try to determine whether the image of Solomon has been reinterpreted in some way by the Greek translators through their choice of words. Thus, we will try to re-late the semantic changes of the Greek wording used in the LXX with the philosophical concept of the institution of the monarchy and the figure of the king; whether the actual Greek translation might or might not reflect a different Hebrew text is of less interest to us than the possible change in the characterization of Solomon that a particular translation might reflect within a Hellenized Greek-speak-ing Jewish community. The first place where such a change is attested, and attested most strikingly, is in the two miscellanies (3 Kingdoms 2:35a2:46 ;°־a)'־ that precede the Prayer at Gibeon and the divine award of wisdom. In the first miscellany or textual insertion (3 Kgds 2:35a־°) the predomi-nant theme is the wisdom of Solomon, indicated by the wordpair φρόνησις / σοφία and their cognates φρόνιμος / σοφός; the name of the king occurs six times, always linked with the concept of wis-dom. Therefore, in this first miscellany Solomon is characterized principally as a wise man. However, the Greek words suggest a change in the concept of wisdom, a change towards redefining the figure of Solomon following Hellenistic conceptions. Apparently both φρόνησις and σοφία, and their cognates, mean \"practical wisdom\" or \"clever in practical matters.\"' However, both terms have a more extended meaning in philosophy and religion. Thus, σοφία has a variety of meanings, which can refer to a) practical habilities; b) political skill and wisdom; c) poetry and the things that give quality to life; d) physical science; and e) knowledge of divine things, that is, of unchanging entities in philosophical terms.8 Φρόνησις and φρόνιμος have a meaning clearly linked with Greek philosophy and philosophical theories about monarchy; thus Plato affirms that the see also Ε. Τον, The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (JBS 8; Jerusalem: Simor, 1997). 7 See Liddell and Scott, Greek English Lexicon, 1956 for φρόνιμος and 1622 for σοφός. Cf. also the definition of σοφία that appears in 4 Macc 1:16: σοφία δή τοίνυν εστίν γνώσις θειων και ανθρωπίνων πραγμάτων και τούτων αίτιων (\"wisdom, in consequence, is knowledge of divine and human things and of their causes\"; my translation). 8 V.

The exact pattern of that development is provided by the second miscellany (3 Kgds 2:46a''), which continues to develop the charac-terization of wisdom but links it with Solomon as ruler; thus Solomon is depicted in this second textual insertion as άρχων φρόνιμος και σοφός. Wisdom and rulership become identified; Solomon is not only a wise man but a wise ruler. The underlying concept in the LXX is that of the ruler as the incarnation of law and justice (νόμος έμψυχος),10 a concept that was central in Hellenistic treatises about kingship.11 The principal idea is that \"Kingliness [...] is inseparable from justice,\"12 and it is precisely in the light ofthat idea that the whole episode of Gibeon (3:5-15) can be easily reinterpreted because justice is the supreme characteristic of the king in his role of Ani-mate Law (νόμος έμψυχος). Thus, in the Greek text Solomon asks for \"a heart to hear and to judge your people with justice (3:9);\" the expression \"with justice\" (εν δικαιοσύνη) is absent from the Hebrew text and in the Greek texts links the concept of justice to the peti-tion for φρόνησις. This link between φρόνησις, δικαιοσύνη and βασιλεία is more evident in 3:28 after the judgment of the two prostitutes (3:16-27) and acquires a further aspect, namely the con-nection with the divinity: 9 Politicus, 1288a, b; Politicus, 294 a; quoted by E. R. Goodenough, \"The Political Philosophy of Hellenistic Kingship,\" TCS Í (1928), 55-102, 62. 10 As in the treatise On Kingship of Diotogenes quoted by Goodenough (\"Hellenistic kingship,\" 65) following Stobaeus (Stob., IV, vii, 61 [IV, 263 ff.]): \"The most just man would be king, and the most lawful would be most just. For without justice no one would be king, and without law [there would be no] justice. For justice is in the law, and the law is the source [αίτιος] of justice. But the king is Animate Law [νόμος έμψυχος], or is a legal ruler [νόμιμος άρχων]. So for this reason he is most just and most lawful.\" 11 So Goodenough, \"Hellenistic Kingship,\" 64: \"there had developed a conception that the true king was personally of unique significance as a lawmaker, or even as Law itself. [...] this conception is explained as resting on the fact that the king is personally a representation and revelation of divine natural law in the kingdom.\" 12 Goodenough, \"Hellenistic Kingship,\" 65."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"And all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they were afraid before the king, because they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to make judgment. The key concept in this passage is \"wisdom of God;\" the Greek expression (φρόνησις θεοϋ) translates the Hebrew The .חכמת אלהים Hebrew expression could have been translated by the Greek φρόνησις θειά or something similar, since the Hebrew genitive construction stands for an adjectival construction; however, although translated in a literal manner, the expression could have been in-terpreted by readers in the light of their awareness of Hellenistic theories of kingship. Thus, the image of Solomon would have dif-ferent associations in the Hellenistic world: In so far as he has a sacred and divine mentality he is truly the king; for by obeying this mentality he will cause all good things, but nothing that is evil. And he will clearly be just, one who has common relations with all. For communion [κοινωνία] consists in equality, and while in the distribution of equality justice plays the most important part, yet communion has its share. For it is impossible to be unjust while giv-ing a share of equality, or to give a share of equality and not to be communal. And could one doubt that the self-sufficient man [ό αύταρκής] is continent [εγκρατής]? For extravagance is the mother of incontinence, who in turn is the mother of insurgency [ΰβρις], from whom most human ills arise. But self-sufficiency does not beget ex-travagance or her brood. Rather self-sufficiency, being a primal en-tity [άρχά], leads all things, but is itself led by nothing, and precisely this is a property alike of God and the king himself, to be the ruler (whence he is called the \"Self Ruling\"), but to be ruled by no one. Now that this could not occur apart from intelligence /φρόνησις7 is clear, while it is obvious that God is the intelligence /φρόνησις/ of the universe (emphasis mine).13 According to this text, the φρόνησις θεοϋ is one of the natural attributes of the ruler, who is άρχά (\"principle\") and, as we have seen in the second miscellany, Solomon was characterized as άρχων, that is, as \"ruler\". The exact wording of the LXX could then be interpreted along lines that clearly diverge from traditional under-standing of the king of Israel; the Solomon of LXX is shown as the paradigm of the Hellenistic ruler, embodying wisdom and justice as his main attributes.

In this text, φρόνησις (wisdom, intelligence) is not linked to justice, rather it denotes prac-tical wisdom, as the use of the verb σοφίζομαι (\"to be wise\") sug-gests as well. Furthermore, the text could easily be reinterpreted in an allegorical way because several terms and expressions are seman-tically ambivalent. The comparison between the wisdom of Solomon and the wisdom of Egypt has to be located within the legendary Hellenistic conception of Egypt as a land where mysterious knowl-edge was preserved,1' which would add an esoteric dimension to Solomon's wisdom not necessarily present in the Hebrew text. Therefore, the Greek-speaking Jew would have the means to remould the figure of Solomon according to a new pattern. The Greek word παραβολή (\"comparison, proverb\") also means \"astronomical conjunction\"16 and it is quite likely that such a mean-ing was understood because Solomon is depicted as a philosopher with knowledge about all the domains of nature. Besides, the bib-lical text is interpreted in this way in the Wisdom of Solomon and in depictions of the hermetic sage, which suggests that this exegesis gained some popularity. In the same way the φδή (\"song\") of the text is a quasi-synonym for επωδή (\"spell\", \"charm\"), which could 14 All the translations from the LXX are mine. 15 This reinterpretation was completed within a century, as Josephus' view of Solomon in the Jewish Antiquities 8:42-43 clearly suggests. 16 Cf. Liddell and Scott, 1305.

Finally, 3 Kgds 5:13 could be seen as an allegory for the four elements in which each of the species would stand for one of the elements (land animal = earth, fish = water, birds = air, reptiles = fire). According to the Greek version, the figure of King Solomon could easily be transformed along Hellenistic lines as a kind of para-digmatic universal king of kings whose main virtue was σοφία (5:14). SOLOMON THE KING IN THE WISDOM OF BEN SIRA The Wisdom of Ben Sira is the longest of the so-called deuterocanonical works. This sapiential work was composed by Ben Sira, apparently the master of a wisdom school in Jerusalem, to serve as a kind of handbook of moral behavior, around 180 BCE. His grandson trans-lated the Hebrew original into Greek around 132 BCE in Alexan-dria. The contents of the work are clearly sapiential, following the line of Proverbs, Job or the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon; there are moral, cultic and ethical maxims, folk proverbs, theological and philosophical observations. The book is composed of units longer than the one-verse structure typical of the book of Proverbs. Its textual history is quite complicated since there are two different recensions of both the Hebrew and Greek texts. The Hebrew text that we pos-sess does not comprise the whole work.18 Mention of King Solomon occurs within the \"Praise of the An-cestors\" (44:1-50:24). This text is the longest unified section of the book and is a panegyric on the heroes and sages of Israel; Ben Sira seems to adopt here the Greek literary genre of έγκώμιον (\"lauda-tory ode\") and proposes to his fellow men several figures as models of behavior to be followed or avoided.19 17 Cf. Liddell-Scott, 2030. 18 On this work, see P. W. Skehan and A. Di Leila, The Wisdom of Ben Sira (AB 39; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1987), especially 3-92; M. Segal, Sepher ben Sira ha-Shalem (Hebrew; Jerusalem: Bialik, 1953), 1-72. 19 On this adoption of the έγκώμιον see N.

Thus Solomon is called \"wise\" (έπιστήμων, 47:12) but this Greek word suggests more a kind of technical skill or ability and has smaller semantic range than the Greek words φρόνιμος and σοφός used in LXX to translate חכם (\"wise\"). It could be, then, that the grandson of Ben Sira consciously chose έπιστήμων in order to avoid the alternative Greek terms and that he did so because the figure of King Solomon presented by the LXX had Hellenistic traits that transformed the king into a Helle-nistic ruler. The Greek word έπιστήμων denotes a kind of techni-cal knowledge that is not usually applied to the king in Hellenistic tractates on the monarchy. The text continues by describing the reign of Solomon as an era of peace (47:13); God is responsible for the peace that he awarded in consideration of David's merits and in order to make possible the building of the Temple and the performing of the cult. There is here a downplaying of the merits of Solomon as ruler and the introduc-tion of a negative characterization both of his personality and of his reign that departs from the tendency we observed in Chronicles to value him positively. That negative appraisal is supported also by the direct address to Solomon (47:14: \"how wise you were,\" έσοφί-σθης), which present the figure of Solomon as a failure, despite his extraordinary wisdom (47:14-17). The Greek word σύνεσις (47:14) means rather \"understanding\" or \"intelligence,\"21 and the author again avoids the LXX choices of φρόνησις and σοφία, terms that are more semantically charged than σύνεσις and, consequendy, more prone to reinterpretation. After the motif of wisdom, Ben Sira develops the motif of wealth (47:18-20), combining it with the motif of the king's downfall due to his love of foreign women (47:19-20).22 Here the negative view of the figure of Solomon is completed; he is depicted as the only person directly responsible for the secession of the northern king-20 On this passage see Skehan / Di Leila, The Wisdom of Ben Sira, 522-528; P.

The image of Solomon that is presented in the Wisdom of Ben Sira follows Kings in its main traits. The temporal division between youth / wisdom and old age / folly also follows the editorial pattern of Kings against Chronicles (wise youth 1is unwise old age). Ben Sira in-sists, then, on a darker image of Solomon that goes against the general post-exilic trend represented by Chronicles, Psalm 72, and Song of Songs, which silence the negative traits and emphasize the positive ones. In the same way, the Greek translation of Wisdom of Ben Sira offers a much more \"Jewish\" image than the LXX, which, in contrast, attempts to transform Solomon into a Hellenized king. SOLOMON THE HELLENISTIC KING IN EUPOLEMUS Eupolemus was a Jewish historian of priestly line who apparently lived in Palestine in the mid-2nd century. Among other works, he wrote a book called Concerning the Kings in Judea, only fragments of which have been preserved; some excerpts were incorporated by the pagan author Alexander Polyhistor in his work Concerning the Jews, and from these excerpts five fragments found their way into Eusebius' Praeparatio EvangelicaP Eupolemus is one of the first Hellenistic-Jewish historians and, to a certain extent, his work is apologetic. Although his work was not intended primarily for Gentiles, its inclusion within the work of Alexander Polyhistor indicates that it was read by Gentiles outside Palestine. Two of the five fragments that have come down to us describe Solomon's achievements,24 focusing on the construction of the Temple and the relationship of Solomon with the rulers of Egypt 23 The fragments are as follows: Eus. Praeparatio Evangelica IX, 26, 1 (about Moses); IX, 30, 8; IX 31, IX, 33; IX, 32; IX, 34, 1-3 (about David and Solomon). For the Greek text see A. M.

Eupolemus' source is 2 Chronicles but he has harmonized it with 1 Kings. It seems that he used both the Hebrew text and a Greek translation, which supports the existence of a Greek version by the second century BCE. The treatment of Solomon in Eupolemus follows very closely that found in the Chronicler; thus the role of Solomon in the construc-tion of the Temple is to some extent diminished because of the preparations made by David before his death.25 However, the fig-ure of Solomon acquires greater importance if we take into the account the correspondence between the king and the rulers of Egypt and Tyre. Leaving aside the discussion about their authenticity, these letters depict a Solomon who is regarded as, and treated as, a great king or king of kings.2'י The formulae used in the letters clearly show the superiority of the king over the Egyptian and Tyrian rulers. The letters deal with Solomon's need for workers to build the Temple, and the arrangments for their maintenance.27 Eupolemus modified his sources about the maintenance of the workers, increasing the quantities and thus indicating the generosity of Solomon, as gener-osity was considered one of the principal attributes of Hellenistic rulers. After the correspondence with foreign kings, the fragments of Eupolemus describe Solomon's preparations for building the Temple.28 In this connection, Eupolemus appears as revisionist, trying to attribute ultimate responsibility for the building work to David.29 Although we can observe the same trend in 1 Chronicles, Eupolemus carries it even further. Thus, he emphasizes Solomon's youth, claim-ing that he was only twelve years old when he ascended to the throne. It seems, as Wacholder states, that \"Eupolemus was convinced that the Chronicler's revision had not gone far enough;\"30 thus he made clear that the preparations for the construction of the Temple were already completed in David's time. Thus, we can say with Wacholder that \"in the First Book of Kings, the Temple of Jerusalem was wholly Solomonic. The Chronicler assigned a significant share in the plan-25 Praeparatio Evangelica 9.30.8. 26 Praeparatio Evangelica 9.31 - 9.33. On the depiction of Solomon as king of kings, see D.

Eupolemus made David's share paramount. The apotheosis of David seems to have begun.\" 51 There is an ambivalent treatment of the figure of King Solomon in these fragments of Eupolemus. On the one hand, Eupolemus portrayed Solomon as a very generous king, following a Hellenistic model. On the other hand, the responsibility of the principal achieve-ment of his reign, the construction of the temple, is indirectly at-tributed to David, with the role of Solomon diminished; accordingly Solomon is referred to as \"Son of David,\" this family connection being his principal attribute. However, despite their apparent op-position, both these contrasting portraits of Solomon both influence later tradition. Thus, Josephus will continue the description of Solomon as a Hellenistic king, but enriching it with esoteric tradi-tions. In the same way, Solomon characterized as \"Son of David\" will be present in Pseudo-Philo and Psalms of Solomon, although there \"Son of David\" is a title with a different content. The frag-ments of Eupolemus, then, show that from the second century BCE such portraits of Solomon existed to a limited extent; further on we will see how they were modified by various authors. SOLOMON THE HELLENISTIC KING IN JOSEPHUS' ANTIQUITIES Josephus' historical works are one of our main sources for the study of the history of Second Temple Judaism and his treatment of bib-lical sources reflects the different traditions that were alive in his time and the contemporary attitudes toward biblical texts.32 In his Jew-ish Antiquities Josephus retold Jewish history from its very beginning to the bitter end of the destruction of the Temple.33 This retelling 31 Wacholder, Eupolemus, 172. 32 For a general introduction to Josephus, see H.

In, fact he seems to diminish David's role in the construction of the Temple, contrary to the postexilic tendency to attribute more responsibility to David, evidenced in Chronicles and Eupolemus.411 Like Eupole-mus, Josephus focuses a great part of his effort on describing the preparation and construction of the Temple, but he adds several details to his biblical sources to bolster the role of Solomon and his prestige.41 Some of these details could be inspired by the Herodian Temple he knew, but most of them are his own invention, based perhaps on some priestly traditions known to him. Josephus also insists on Solomon's wisdom, which he describes as the wisdom of a philosopher. He depicts Solomon as a sage who knows the secrets of nature, which included dominion over demons (8.44-45). He develops 1 Kings 9-10 so that a new personage called Abdemonos appears and shows himself to be superior in wisdom to Solomon (8.147-149); apparently he quotes the Hellenistic historian Dios.42 Josephus then presents a rather favorable view of Solomon, although he notes the gravity of his sins (8.191-194). 40 Jewish Antiquities 7.339-340. 41 Thus he adds some information about the foundations of the Temple, the materials, the existence of a second storey, the number of side chambers and their exact dimensions (Antiquities 8.63-66); he also insists on the extraordinary size of the Temple (8.79); he exaggerates numbers in general (8.89-91) and makes them quite exact (8.91-100). However, it has to been noted that he does not mention demons or spirits working on the construction as the Aggadah usually does, although he does mention the approval and assistance of God in the task (8.130). 42 See Mendels, \"Hellenistic Writers of the Second Century B.C. on the Hiram-Solomon Relationship,\" 239-441.

On the one hand, Josephus and the LXX depicted him as a Hellenistic ruler tailored to Hellenistic ideas about King-ship and perhaps having in mind the great rulers of the Hellenistic oriental monarchies. However, both Josephus and LXX incorporate into their view some notes that clearly suggest more than the mere recasting of King Solomon in the mold of a Hellenistic ruler. Their interpretation of 1 Kgs 5:9-14 suggests that they also introduced the Hellenistic concept of the numinous power that the King as vicari-ous divine figure embodied. This concept was combined with her-metic interpretation of the same passage and resulted in the blend-ing of the Semitic figure of Solomon, already linked with Wisdom, with the figure of a Hellenized king. On the other hand Ben Sira and Eupolemus use this reinterpretation more cautiously, although their portrayal remains closer to the traditional King Solomon of the Hebrew Bible, except for the fact that they continue the pro-cess already begun in Chronicles of transferring the credit for the Temple construction from Solomon to David. These texts also furnish us with an approximate chronology of the changes. Thus, around the mid-second century CE the LXX began recasting the figure of Solomon into a Hellenized mold, timidly at first. Eupolemus some years later and then the Greek Ben Sira continued this process of recasting. Josephus presents us a with King Solomon who is quite transformed, incorporating both the Helle-nized figure and the Jewish traditions about his dominion over demons, as we shall see."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR SOLOMON THE EXORCIST INTRODUCTION In the preceding chapters we have seen how Solomon was described in the biblical text and in what could be defined as the main streams of the Judaism of the Second Temple: in the Scriptures his portrayal was not always completely positive as the different strata in the first book of Kings show or as the conscious effort of the Chronicler to whitewash the figure of the king clearly indicates. In the writings of Second Temple Judaism, we have found the usual Jewish adapta-tions to the current trends of the historical period; thus, Solomon is depicted as a Hellenistic king. However, despite the existence of different perceptions of the king in the Bible, he was always por-trayed in \"normal\" terms: thus, the king is a builder, wise, a judge, priest, sinner. It is surprising then that already in the first century BCE a new portrait of Solomon arose that described him as endowed with secrets and esoteric knowledge, i.e., as a powerful exorcist. From then on Solomon and demonology appeared together and this new perception of the character enjoyed great popularity. Perhaps the tradition that linked Solomon with demons and ex-orcism originated in an older tradition what depicted David as exorcizing demons by the soothing powers of his music. Solomon, as the Son of David, would have inherited some of these capabili-ties. In fact, the prayer at Gibeon in which the king asked for prac-tical wisdom to rule over a great people could be reinterpreted in other terms only if the previous description of David as exorcist (1 Sam 16:14-23) was applied also, at least in certain contexts, to his son Solomon. The first evident manifestation of these new interpre-tations could be found in the LXX translation and in the impor-tance of the so called miscellanies or textual insertions in the Greek text. However, it is not likely that the biblical tradition of the exorcistic and soothing powers of David could be the only basis for the new portrayal of Solomon as exorcist and for the importance of this portrayal, which is attested in several texts from the first centuries"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CE. Therefore, the actual origin of this new conception of Solomon has to lie somewhere, and perhaps it should be viewed as the result of the adaptation and transformation of some of the Hellenistic ideas on monarchy that were current at the time. We have seen how the LXX wording of the text of Kings seems to offer us a conscious reinterpretation of Solomon as a Hellenistic king; in the same way, we know that there was a tendency to deify Hellenistic monarchs, first after their death, and later during their lifetimes. This deifica-tion depicted the king either as the earthly representation of a god (Zeus, Dionisius) or as the god incarnate. It is likely that as gods, Hellenistic rulers were viewed as having special powers: they acquired some of the abilities of the θειός άνήρ (\"divine man\").1 Thus Vespa-sian, when hailed as emperor in Alexandria, perfomed several miracles.־ Besides, among the characteristic traits of the θειός άνήρ the ability to expel demons included, as Philostratus shows in his biography of Apollonius of Tyana.3 It is most probable then, that at some point, part of this type of monarchic ideology was incorpo-rated into the process of historical idealization of the Jewish mon-archy. This incorporation supposed, nonetheless, a reworking of these ideas, so that they were not totally incompatible with the monotheistic beliefs of Judaism. Thus, the LXX vision of Solomon as Hellenistic king could be easily reinterpreted in that sense because the divinity of the Hellenistic ruler was based on his alleged superiority, and in the case of Solomon that superiority was unquestionable and stated in an absolute manner by the text.4 ' On the divine man see L.

However the view of the king as lieutenant of a god on the earth was used in combination with the rich demonology and angelology of the period. Solomon would be considered, then, as the lord and master of demons by reason of his special knowledge, and so sev-eral marvellous details could be added to the narration of the con-struction of the temple. That these new traits enjoyed a significant diffusion is attested by the different texts we will study and by the fact that some of them seem to preserve the same exorcistic formula. In the following pages we will focus on the texts that deal with expelling demons and the use of an exorcistic formula (\"who are you?\"). In this chapter we shall study a small scroll of apocryphal psalms from Qumran (11QPsApa), which seems to be the oldest remnant of this tradition; the exorcisms that appear in the Testament of Solomon will also be studied and we will relate both traditions. Finally, other texts, such as the Questions of Bartholomew and some Greek exorcisms will be taken into account. In each one of the three principal texts, the mention of Solomon is clear and the identifying formula (\"who are you?\") plays an important role, and it seems to be linked to Solomon to a greater or lesser extent: in 11 QPsApa the formula begins the exorcisms and seems to function as the kernel of the structure; in the Testament of Solomon, it comprises the framework for the demonological and medico-magical material incorporated in it; in the so-called Questions of Bartholomew, the formula and its link to king Solomon is used as a sort of proof text for emphasizing the power against the demons of Jesus and Bartholomew.

Therefore, magic and divination must be viewed as of minor interest for the Essenes [...] The magic and divinatory texts found in the caves of Qumran demonstrate that the Essenes had a profound knowledge of different forms of magic and divination as well as of the different arguments for their rejection\" (433-434; emphasis mine). It is evident that the author's conclusions are quite surprising, since what he denies in the first place, he affirms afterwards; the relative absence of magic and divination in legislative or theological reflection can equally mean that such practices were absolutely integrated in the life of the sect and, therefore, were not viewed as objectionable. As we shall see, 11 QPsAp\" seems to support the view that the sectarians used exorcistic techniques that can also be found outside the sect."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"specifically in 11QPsAp3, a scroll that contains four exorcistic com-positions. 11QPsAp3 is a small scroll measuring 8.5 cm by 3.2 cm; after unrolling it, the editor had a long strip of leather in a zigzag shape. There is a little tongue of leather to be placed to the right of the strip, thus at the beginning of the scroll. The end of the manuscript is composed of a sheet of blank leather, approximately one column wide; at the left of this sheet there are remains of sewing.7 The state of the scroll is, thus, quite fragmentary, which makes the study of the traditions it contains difficult. However, despite the problems, two facts are clear: on the one hand, the names of King Solomon and his father David appear at the beginning of the compositions; on the other, the content of the psalms is exorcistic. On these grounds, a more detailed study should be undertaken regarding its content, structure and possible links with the traditions about Solomon that we find in other texts. Our study will be limited to the three apoc-ryphal psalms; the canonical Psalm 91, also found in the scroll, will be considered only in terms of its thematic links with the other psalms.8 The first datum that 11 QPsApa furnishes us is an \"external chro-nology\" of the traditions it contains. By external chronology, we mean the fact that this scroll, like the other scrolls that form the library of the sectarians, can be located in time by palaeographical analysis of the script.

The scroll is written in a late, highly developed Herodian hand; the style of the letters is quite baroque, due to the presence of keraiai and some ligatures; the letters tend to be of equal size. This script is very similar to the script of 4QDeutJ and 4QPs and it can be dated approximately between 50 and 70 C.E.9 The traditions of the scroll must be at least as old as the date of the copy of the manuscript, and most likely older: if we consider 11QPsApa to be a copy of another manuscript, we are speaking then of a tradition and with it, of a development. This possibility would mean that the psalms might be pre-Qumranic, that is, that they had their origin outside of the community and that at a specific point they were taken into the corpus held by the Qumran library; the traditions contained in the psalms would have been widespread and popular enough in the second and the first century B.C.E. as to have been incorporated by the sectarians.10 However, even if they are sectarian compositions, it is likely that they draw from sources that were also quite popular among various Jewish groups of the Second Temple period, as the numerous later works that contain the same traditions suggest. b. Contents and Structure of the Scroll As has been noted, 11 QPsApa contains the remnants of four psalms. The last of them, Psalm 91, is the only canonical composition pre-43.982-88, PAM 44.003 (Fragment A), 44.113 (unpublished fragment), 44004 (two unpublished fragments). 9 For this chronology we have taken as reference the classification of F.

Yadin; Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1957), 56-87. 10 Puech (\"Les deux derniers psaumes davidiques du rituel d'exorcisme,,-81 י 89) sees in these psalms examples of pre-Essene compositions; on the contrary, Garcia Martinez (\"Salmos Apôcrifos en Qumrán,\" 200) affirms the sectarian origin of the psalms by pointing out their characteristic sectarian terminology; Kampen (\"The Essene Position on Magic,\" 329-382, esp. 381) dates them even earlier: \"The free use of the tetragrammaton in 11 QPsAp׳' demonstrates that the text must have been written at least in third or early second century BCE and that it is therefore of non-Essene origin.\""},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"served in the scroll; it closes the group of compositions and provides them with the necessary pseudepigraphical cover: the Davidic au-thorship claimed for Psalm 91 is extended to the other psalms. Besides, as Psalm 91 was, according to rabbinic tradition, to be used as an exorcistic device, it underlines the exorcistic content of the whole scroll.\" The other three psalms are compositions the contents of which are clearly exorcistic and share some of the characteristics of this kind of work. We can suppose, as Puech does, that this scroll has preserved the rest of the psalms \"to sing over the possesed\" that are mentioned at 11QPsa XXVII 9-10.12 Not much can be said about the first apocryphal psalm; its state is so fragmentary that only a few words have survived the ravages of time. Among these words, \"dragon\" (],3D) in line seven and \"de-mons\" (•,שד) in line twelve, and \"exorcising\" (משביע) are the only remnants that allow us to suppose its exorcistical content. The second and third Psalms are also very fragmentary. However, a reconstruction of the lacunae has been attempted by several schol-ars, and is complete enough to allow us an assessment of the psalms' contents and structure. The second Psalm was composed of four columns of 14 lines each; we have sizeable fragments of the first three 11 See J. A. Sanders, The Psalms Scroll of Qumran Cave 11 (HQPs'> (DJD 4; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), 91 -93; idem, The Dead Sea Psalms Scroll (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, 1967), 134-137. 12 See Puech, \"11QPsAp\": un rituel,\" 397. However Garcia Martinez argues against this: \"there is not enough evidence to assume that the manuscript contained the four songs mentioned in 1 1 QPsa, as the songs of this manuscript are not the only ones dealing with •״הפגוע״ (Qumran Cave 11, 183). It is precisely the mention of Solomon in col. II 2 which, in the opinion of Garcia Martinez, \"may indicate that the scroll did not consist per se of four songs of David against the demons, but of a collection of such texts.\" As is clear, the reasons advanced against the Davidic attribution of the four psalms are by no means absolutely conclusive; the mention of Solomon could suppose that there is a conscious effort to link both biblical figures to strengthen the pseudepigraphical attribution. 111 addition to that, we should remember the exorcistic psalm that David sang to soothe Saul tormented by a demon (LAB 60) in which David foresees his son prevailing over demons. It is probable that both 11QPsAp\" and Pseudo-Philo refer to the same tradition. It has also to be noted that if Psalm 91 works as a device of pseudepigraphical attribution, so the whole scroll logically was considered to be of Davidic authorship. Finally, we should remember that the role of Solomon in the pseudepigraphical and parabiblical literature of the sect is quite limited; on Qumran and Pseudepigrapha see, M. E. Stone, \"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha,\" DSD 3 (1996), 270-295; M.J. Bernstein, \"Pseudepigraphy in the Qumran Scrolls: Categories and Functions,\" in E. G. Chazon and M. E.

[...]'5 Already at the beginning the reconstruction, the text defines its content and its claimed \"Davidic\" authorship; since the four com-positions claim to be Davidic and their content is exorcistic, this occasions no surprise. However, what does surprise us is that the psalm has already introduced the name of Solomon by the third line. In fact, this name is one of the few words that are not entirely re-constructed; indeed it is the only word that requires no reconstruc-tion whatosever. It seems clear, then, that this name played some kind of role in the psalm, either as theme, subject, or depositary of the alleged Davidic tradition the psalm contained, and that it is clear then, that a plausible explanation of the presence of Solomon in the text should be attempted in order to better understand both the inner working of the text and its possible links with contemporary and later traditions. What, then, is the role of Solomon in this text, and how does the text relate to the other psalms? To answer the first part of 13 The present translation is mine; it is to some extent restricted by what could actually be read on the photos. Both the preliminary edition of Puech and the definitive edition of Garcia Martinez have been taken into account. We have preferred to adopt the fuller reconstructions of Puech since they provide a more comprehensible framework for the surviving remnants of the psalms. However, we are quite aware of the highly hypothetical character of much of his reconstruction, so we have checked them against the edition of Garcia Martinez in each doubtful case. In lines 11-12, according to Puech, the verb הבדיל refers to divine creation (Genesis 1). However, Garcia Martinez (Qumran Cave 11, 192) points out that it is used both in the context of the separation of Israel from the nations (Lev 20:24), and in Qumran sectarian literature in connection with the separation of the Community from the rest of Israel (1QS V 1); thus, according to Garcia Martinez, the present use of the verb could refer to a separation from the demons, who would be viewed as essentially impure creatures."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"this question a partial reconstruction of the lacuna that precedes the name of Solomon has to be attempted. As we have seen, the text begins with a definition of its con-tents \"about the words of incantation in the name of YHWH\" (על דברי לחש בשם יהוה), after which the name of Solomon oc-curs. Already at this point we have to suppose that the Solomon to which the text refers is the king who was the son of David; it is reasonable to think so given on the one hand the context, and on the other, the testimonies of some almost contemporary works such as the Jewish Antiquities or Pseudo-Philo, which present King Solomon in connection with demons and exorcisms. As the psalm seems to be attributed to David, Solomon cannot have the principal role, which has to be related somehow to David. It is likely that here we have an introduction of the king that ap-pears at the beginning of some canonical psalms, by which the set-ting or the contents of the psalm are explained. Thus, a plausible reconstruction of the lacuna could be the following: \"Of David. Concerning the words of incantation in the name of YHWH that king David gave to his son, Solomon (אשר נתן דויד )המלך לבנו שלומה14 Solomon would appear then as heir to a tradition that apparently was linked to his father David. It is likely that we have an echo of the same tradition in Pseudo-Philo (LAB 60), where David announces that a son from his loins will have power over demons.1' Although in both texts the pair David/Solomon appears, each elements em-phasizes a different aspect: in LAB 60 David gives prominence to his son, apparently Solomon, as a future ruler over demons, whereas in 11 QPsAp3, according to the proposed reconstruction, Solomon plays a more secondary role, as repository of secret wisdom for exorcising demons. It is, thus, likely that at Qiimran, when the tra-dition that connected Solomon and the demons was taken into the community, this tradition was deliberately linked with David, since 14 Garcia Martinez (Qumran Cave 11, 191) proposes another possible reconstruc-tion: \"He shall utter a spell which Solomon made, and he shall invoke the name it is clear that this ,)יאמר לחש אשר עשה שלומה ויקרא בשם יהרה( ״of YHWHreconstruction does not allow for Davidic attribution of the Psalms. Charlesworth (Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek Texts, 4a: 220-221) makes another pro-posai: \"[...the ac]t of Solomon when he invokfed the name of Yahweh...\" .)מעש[ ה שלומה ויקר]א בשם יהוה(15 See the chapter 6 \"Solomon, the Son of David.\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"LAB 60 shows us that such a link existed outside the sectarian com-munity; however both texts testify to the existence of such a tradi-tion, which was also linked to David, perhaps to strengthen its au-thority. To some extent, we can observe a similar transformation in the Chronicler's treatment of the figure of Solomon, who is so con-sciously and systematically linked with David that all his achieve-ments appear to have already been planned by David.Ib However, if this hypothesis holds true, the role of Solomon in 11 QjPsApa and his relationship with its exorcistic and demonological contents are diminished, which seems strange in the light that other texts shed on him. Could we have here a transformation of the tra-dition of Solomon so that it would appear linked to David and in this way be more acceptable? The answer to this question is to be found in the last two extant columns of this psalm. The text begins with an important question that, as we shall see later, is related to Solomon in other texts: Col. II /)[...] [and you will say to him: who] 2) are you? [Did you make the heavens and] the depth[s and all that is in them,] 3) the earth and every [thing that is upon] the earth; who has do [ne these signs] 4) and these port[ents upon the ]earth?

Col. IV 1. [...] 2) which [...] those possessed, [and they will walk with all] 3) the volunteers of your/his tru[th when Ra]phae1 heals them. If in the first column we find a kind of introduction in which David, his son Solomon, and Belial, prince of the demons, appear, the second column begins with the question \"Who are you?\"1' Evidently this question is addressed to the demon or evil spirit to be exorcized. Although the question's aim is to identify the demon, so that it may be expelled, the answer is not direct, but rather a kind of negative identification; the exorcism identifies it on account of what it is not or what it cannot perform. Thus, the first four lines of the column constitute the negative identification, with which the rest of the exorcism is contrasted; it is God, by means of an angelic figure, who will fight against the demon. The demon is threatened with impris-onment in darkness and with binding in Sheol. Judging by the rem-nants of the fourth column, Raphael is the angel to whom the ex-orcisms refer. The key to understanding these psalms as a sectarian adaptation of a tradition that was first linked with Solomon outside the sect lies in the question \"who are you?\" It is likely that it worked as a for-mula to identify the demon and to make the exorcism effective. In the light of the role this formula plays in the Testament of Solomon, where it functions as the kernel to the introduction and identifica-tion of the different demons and as a framework for the demonol-ogy contained in the text, it is quite possible that the question was a traditional exorcism formula. As this formula is clearly linked with Solomon, since it is used by him every time in the invocation of the demons, it is also probable that both formula and exorcist (Solomon) were united by tradition. It is not likely that the direct source of the Testament for such a tradition was the Qumran psalms; therefore, it is logical to conclude that both writings drew the formula and its connection to Solomon from another source, or most likely that such a tradition and formula were quite widespread and popular in Jew-17 Garcia Martinez (Qumran Cave 11, 194), only mentions Puech's reconstruction (\"who are you\" [אתה ,D]) in the comments to the first line. However, it should be noted that the same direct question to a demon appears afterwards in 11 QPsAp3 V.6. As magic in general and exorcisms in particular show a clear tendency to use fixed formulae, the reconstruction of Puech is more likely than Garcia Martinez presupposes. As the different compositions of the scroll form a quite well-defined unit, the formulae used in them have to show points of contact in order to be viewed as effective by the possible users."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ish circles, at least from the first century B.C.E. on. This same for-mula is used again in the third psalm in a manner which reminds us even more of the Testament of Solomon: Col. V, 4) Of David. Ab[out the words of incajntation in the name of YH[WH. Call out at any] moment 5) to the hea[vens when] Belial is coming upon you, and [you] will say to him: 6) who are you, [accursed among] men and among the race of the holy ones? Your face is a face of futility and your horns are horns of a wre[tch]. You are darkness and not light, 8) iniquity and not justice. [Against you] is the chief of the army.

[...] for ever 3) [all the] sons of Be [liai. Amen. Amen]. Selah. This text shows a much more defined structure; in fact it seems to furnish a series of practical instructions to be followed when Belial is lurking. It begins with the Davidic attribution and a brief com-pendium of the contents and the circumstances in which the Psalm should be used. The formula \"who are you?\" clearly appears as the kernel round which the framework of the text is constructed. The structure is built up as follows: a) identifying formula (\"who are you?\"); b) description of the demon; c) threat of binding at the hands of YHWH; d) rhetorical invocation of an angel. Solomon does not appear in this text, but, according to the proposed reconstruction, the four compositions are linked to him indirectly. Besides, as has been noted, this same formula occurs in the Testament of Solomon, which suggests that its Davidic attribution in the present text is also sec-ondary, since it is most likely that it was linked to Solomon in the first place. Thus, at Qumran we appear to have a transformation of the tradition so that David could take on the role of exorcist to the detriment of Solomon, because David or an ideal Davidic fig-ure seems to have an important role in the sectarian writings. How-ever, at a certain point the precise ascription of the exorcistic for-mula becomes secondary; the really significant thing is that an exorcistic formula centered around the question \"who are you?\" already existed from an early date, at least from the first century CE, the approximate date at which our scroll was copied."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"c. Conclusions 11 QPsAp3 is not the only composition found at Qumran that deals with demonology, angelology or exorcism. In fact, 4Q510-511 (\"Songs of the Sage\") is composed of the same kind of material, and we have the description of an exorcism in the Genesis Apocryphon (XIX, 28-29).18 However, 11QPsAp3 differs from those texts in that it provides the oldest ritual of exorcism of Second Temple Judaism, where the importance of the divine name is clear, since it appears repeatedly, as against 4Q510-511 where there is no explicit men-tion of the divine name. This mention of the divine name is also important in later Jewish exorcisms and magical texts. Besides, these apocryphal psalms provide us with the oldest available background concerning the traditions about Solomon and the demons; in them, the name of Solomon appears in an evidently exorcistic setting that includes the use of a formula (\"who are you?\") for the identification of the demons to be chased away, a formula that appears again in another text related to Solomon ( Testament of Solomon). Therefore, it is likely that both texts took the use of this formula and its connec-tion with the name of Solomon from a common source or milieu, since it is not plausible to see it as a purely Qumranic development. What the Qumran fragments adds to our comprehension of these traditions is their antiquity, which in turn supports the antiquity of the tradition as a whole. SOLOMON THE EXORCIST AND THE FORMULA \"WHO ARE YOU?\" IN THE TESTAMENT OF SOLOMON Among the apocryphal and pseudepigraphal writings attributed to Solomon, the Greek work called Testament of Solomon clearly stands out. This writing was already noted by some scholars in the seven-teenth century, but it was not until the nineteenth century and the beginnings of twentieth that it was studied with the care it deserved.19 18 For the \"Songs of the Sage,\" see M. Baillet, Qumran Grotte 4, III (4Q482-4Q520) (DJD 7; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982); for the Genesis Apocryphon see N. Avigad and Y. Yadin, A Genesis Apocryphon: A Scroll from the Wilderness of Judaea (Jerusalem: Magnes Press and Heikhal Ha-Sefer, 1956); J. A.

Dupont-Sommer, \"Exorcismes et guérisons dans les écrits de Qoumrân,\" VT Sup 7 (1960), 246-261. 19 Despite the interest that such a text has in the present surge of studies about"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The work is narrated in the first person by Solomon himself, fol-lowing the genre of the Testaments: Solomon tells how he invoked several different demons by using a ring (δακτυλίδιον) given to him by the archangel Michael and how the demons were forced to work in the building of the temple.20 A complex and comprehensive demonology is inserted within the haggadic framework of the labours of the demons in the Temple; this demonology describes the physi-cal appearance of each demon, its powers, and the angels to be invoked against it. It is not easy to clarify the relationship between the haggadic story and the demonology. However, it is evident that \"the Testament of Solomon in its full form was intended as a sort of encyclopaedia of demonology.\"21 The textual history of the Testament is quite complex; McCown, the editor of the text, used sixteen manuscripts in his eclectic criti-cal edition.22 According to the textual history proposed by the edi-tor, those sixteen manuscripts (dated from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries CE) are divided into four different recensions (A, B, C, D). Recensions A and Β are revisions of the original Testament; although McCown had doubts about the order of the recensions, he finally defended the priority of recension A over B. Recension C would be a still later recension of B, possibly made in the Middle Ages. Fi-nally, according to McCown, Recension D represents the haggadic story that formed the basis of the Testament, although not in its present magic in antiquity, the numerous difficulties of the Testament of Solomon have not been tackled. On the status questionis and the possible lines of research see D. C. Duling, \"The Testament of Solomon,\" JSP (1988), 87-112. 20 There are parallels in rabbinic sources; see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (6 vols; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1968), 4.149-157; 6.291-296. 21 P. S. Alexander, \"Incantations and Books of Magic,\" in E. Schürer, A History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C.- A.D. 135) (3 vols.; rev. by G. Vermes, F. Millar, and M. Black; Edinburgh: Τ & Τ Clark, 1973-1987), 3/1 372-379, 373. It is quite evident that the Testament of Solomon cannot be considered a true \"testament\"; although it has some of the general characteristics of the genre, it lacks the ethical message and reinterpretation of the biblical sources found in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.

However, some of these conclusions have been reassessed in light of the discovery of a papyrus in Vienna, which is the earliest remnant of the Testament (fifth or sixth century CE). This papyrus suggests that recension Β is closer to the original Testament and pre-serves better readings, despite its tendency to expansion.21 The difficulties that we encounter in establishing a textual history are present again in the questions concerning the date and place of composition of the Testament. Preisendanz thought that the original composition went back to the third century CE.24 However, the fourth century C.E. can be viewed as the likely date for the compo-sition of the Testament, since there is no sound basis for the earlier date. Whatever the date of composition may be, the traditions in-eluded within the Testament are very likely at least as old as the first century C.E., as the traditions preserved by Josephus' Jewish Antiq-uities, Wisdom of Solomon and 11 QPsAp3 suggest. As the work was composed in Greek, the place of composition could be Egypt, Asia Minor, or Palestine, according to the editor of the text. b. The Formula \"who are you?\" in the Testament of Solomon As we have just seen, the Testament of Solomon is a difficult work for several reasons: textual history, date and place of composition are still open questions. No attempt has been made to study and clarify the shorter forms of the Testament and their history in the tradition, nor has the genre of the work been analysed. In the following pages, we will try to show that an exorcistic formula comprises the body 23 K. Preisendanz, \"Ein Wiener Papyrusfragment zum Testamentum Salo-monis,\" EOS 48 (1956), 161-167; R. W.

The Testament of Solomon presents itself as a \"Testament,\" that is, a work that follows a very specific genre that was quite popular in Second Temple Judaism. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is the classic example of the genre.25 Each of the Patriarchs narrates his life and makes his will on his death bed, and several ethical messages are conveyed; each composition ends with the instruction given by the patriarch con-cerning his burial and a prediction concerning the future of Israel. Evidently, the Testament of Solomon fits the above description, albeit rather loosely. Thus, the author of the work made use of the genre to give further authority to his text and the traditions it contained. In fact, even though the Vienna papyrus has a physical format that was used in legal testaments, the Testament of Solomon is not a Testa-ment \"avant la lettre.\" What, then, could the Testament be? The answer to this question may lie in a form, an exorcistic formula (\"who are you?\"), that makes up the actual framework holding together the demonology and magical material of the Testament and that turns it into a handbook of demonology and exorcism. Let us study the ap-pearance of this form in the Testament. The oldest recensions of the Testament (A and B) begin in the same way and give us a clue about the character of the work. Although it is likely that this heading was added at a later stage, it is espe-cially interesting, since it expresses one of the principles at work in the Testament. The text is as follows: Blessed be you, Lord, who gave Solomon this power; May glory and power be yours for ever, amen.2'י The key word here is \"power\" (έξουσια). We find this same cog-nate in texts such as Wisdom of Solomon, the Jewish Antiquities of Jose-phus and the New Testament, where Solomon appears in a direct or indirect way. The choice of this word shows that the principal attribute in the Testament is not wisdom or knowledge, but authority or power; a power to subdue demons, a power that is given by God to Solomon as special knowledge. After this illuminating heading, 25 For a discussion of the genre and of the most important testaments, see J. J. Collins, \"Testaments,\" in Stone (ed.), Jewish Writings, 325-355. A testament is always a death bed speech. 26 McCown, Testament, p. 5: Εύλογητός ει, κύριε ό δούς τω Σολομώντι τήν έξουσίαν ταύτην· σοι δόξα και κράτος εις τούς αιώνας; άμήν."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the Testament proper begins with a tale: a boy, the favourite of the king, was being tormented by a demon who sucked his finger, weak-ening him. Solomon went to the temple and prayed to God so that the demons might be delivered by his hand (Test. Sol 1:1-6). The text reads literally: 1.5 I, King Solomon, entered into the temple of God and prayed with my whole soul, praising him day and night, so that the demon might be delivered into my hands and I could have authority over him. 6. And it happened, when I was praying to the God of heaven and earth, that a ring, which had a seal engraved on a precious stone, was given to me from Lord Sabaoth through the archangel Michael.27 Again the key word is \"I could have authority over him\" (εξουσιάσω); here, too, the wisdom tradition has been changed into a power tra-dition. The whole tale functions as an introductory story, a kistoriola, which in exorcisms and magical praxis usually furnishes an \"histori-cal\" context for the technique to be explained. It is evident that in the Testament, the tale runs counter to the biblical prayer of Solomon at Gibeon; whereas in the biblical text Solomon asked for wisdom to rule over the numerous people of Israel, in the Testament he asks for authority to subdue a demon. The setting of the prayer has been completely changed and transformed into a justification for what follows in the Testament. Thus, a biblical text is used as basis for the historiola, but is so transformed as to become unrecognizable. The tale introduces the body of the Testament and then becomes a part of the framework of the text, functioning as the excuse to usher in the demon Ornias, who is the link between the different parts of the text. The prayer at Gibeon has been modified to include the tradi-tion about the imprisonment of the demons (\"you will shut up all the demons, male and female\"28) and another about the miraculous building of Jerusalem and the magical ring of Solomon (\"and through them you will build Jerusalem when you bear this seal of God\"29). 27 Test.Sol. 1:5 (McCown, Testament, 9-10): έγώ ό Βασιλεύς Σολομών είσήλθον εις τόν ναόν τοΰ θεού και έδεήθην έξ ολης μου της ψυχής έξομολογούμενος αύτω νύκτα και ήμέραν όπως παραδοθή ό δαίμων εις τάς χείρας μου και έξουσιάσω αυτόν. 6. και έγένετο έν τω προσεύχεσθαί με προς τόν θεόν του ουρανού και της γης έδόθη μοι παρά κυρίου Σαβαώθ διά Μιχαήλ τοΰ αρχαγγέλου δακτυλίδιον εχον σφραγίδα γλυφής λίθου τιμίου. 28 καί συγκλείσεις πάντα τά δαιμόνια τά τε θηλυκά και αρσενικά (Test. Sol. L7). 29 και δι' αύτών οικοδομήσεις τήν Ιερουσαλήμ έν τψ τήν σφραγίδα ταύτην σε φέρειν τοΰ θεοΰ (Test. Sol. 1:7)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"However the mention of the seal and its role in the Testament are clearly secondary, since the text mainly concerns demonology and the description of an exorcistic formula. Thus, the protagonists of the histonola are a little boy beloved by Solomon, the demon Ornias who is described as a succubus and the king himself, which reminds us strongly of the practitioners of cer-tain magical techniques or exorcisms where a magician (here Solomon) works a spell or invokes a demon (here Ornias) through the assistance of a medium, generally a child (here the beloved ser-vant of Solomon). It is, then, most likely that the author of the Testa-ment adapted a \"classical\" magical-exorcistic technique within the introductory setting of the Testament, so that Solomon invokes a demon through the help of a boy: And I said to him: at the hour the demon appears to you, throw this ring at the chest of the demon, saying to him: Solomon summons you; and come back quickly to me, without thinking about anything that you are going to be afraid of.30 Thus, it seems, the historiola of the beginning of the Testament par-allels other magical texts. Among them, we have to take into account the text entitled \"Solomon's Collapse,\" (PGM 850-929) and the astrological procedures of divination preserved in the Hygromanteia of Solomon, where the magician (again Solomon), the medium (a boy) and a demon appear together. Besides the coincidence in the pro-tagonists of the Testament and the other two texts, the role of Ornias as the introductory element for the rest of the demons makes it more likely that both the Testament and the magical texts share the same setting, since Ornias appears again and again summoning the dif-ferent demons to the presence of Solomon. After the capture of Ornias is depicted (Test. Sol. 1:10-14), the introduction to the core of the Testament is finished. From then on the author sets out a rather complicated demonology following a specific formula that always begins with the identifying question: \"who are you?\" As we have found that question in 11 QPsAp3, an exorcistic text where Solomon appears as well, it is evident that it responds to more than mere chance or coincidence. Even a cursory reading of the Testament makes it clear that each 30 και είπον αΰτψ· \"έν f| âv ώρ<? έπιστή σοι τό δαιμόνιον ρΐψον τό δακτυλίδιον τούτο εις τό στήθος τοΰ δαίμονως λέγων αυτώ׳ δεΰρο καλεί σε ό Σολομών,\" και δρομαίως παραγίνου πρός με μηδέν λογισάμενος ων μέλλει σοι φοβήσαι (Test. Sol. 1:9)."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"of the demons that appears in it is introduced following a defined pattern; this pattern (from now on \"exorcistic form\") is repeated throughout the whole Testament, sometimes with small modifica-tions that do not preclude the identification of the form as such. The summoning of the demon Ornias (Test. Sol. 2:1-5) offers a clear example of the form. Let us examine its structure: When I heard these things, I, Solomon, after getting up from my throne, saw a demon shuddering and trembling, and I said to him: \"Who are you? and what is your name?\" The demon said: \"I am called Ornias.\" 2) And I said to him, \"Tell me in which sign of the Zodiac you re-side.\" And answering, the demon says: \"in Aquarius\" and I strangle the ones who lie in Aquarius, who because of their desire for wenches have invoked the Zodiacal sign of Virgo. 3) Besides, I am hypnotic, being changed in three forms; sometimes I went up like a man who desires the bodies of effeminate boys and when I touch them, they suffer great pain. Sometimes I become a winged creature in the heav-enly regions. Sometimes I appear with the face of a lion. 4) I am a descendant of the power of God, but I am thwarted by Ouriel, the archangel. 5)When, I, Solomon, heard the name of the archangel, I honored and glorified the God of heaven and earth, and having sealed him, I ordered him into the work of cutting the Temple stones...31 The formula appears after a brief introduction. Its structure is clear as well as its function: it arranges the demonological material in an ordered manner, as in a set of instructions. The fundamental points are: a. Identificatory formula (\"who are you,\" \"what is your name\"; τις ει σύ, τίς κλήσις σου;). b. Self-identification of the demon (\"I am called\" / \"I am\"; Χ καλού-μαί/έγώ ειμί). c. Astrological question (\"tell me in what Zodiac sign you reside\"; λέγε μοι èv ποίω ζψδίψ κεΐσαι). 31 1 ) Και ταύτα άκουσας έγώ Σολομών άναστάς άπό τοΰ θρόνου μου ειδον τόν δαίμονα φρίσσοντα και τρέμοντα και ειπον αύτψ· \"τίς ει σΰ, καί τίς ή κλήσίς σου;\" ό δαίμων ειπεν \"Όρνίας καλούμαι.\" 2) καί ειπον αύτψ־ \"λέγε μοι έν ποίω ζψδίψ κεΐσαι.\" καί άποκριθείς ό δαίμων λέγει \"Ύδροχόψ· καί τους έν Ύδρο-χόψ κειμένους δι' έπιθυμίαν τών γυναίων έπί τήν Παρθένον ζφδιον κεκληκότας άποπνίγω. 3) είμί δέ καί ΰπνοτικόν, εις τρεις μορφάς μεταβαλλόμενος, ποτέ μέν ώς άνθρωπος έχεν έπιθυμίαν είδους παιδιών θηλυκών άνήβων, καί άπτομένου μου άλγώσι πάνυ. ποτέ δέ ύπόπτερος γίνομαι έπί τούς ουράνιους τόπους, ποτέ δέ όψιν λέοντος έμφαίνω. 4) άπόγονος δέ είμι άρχαγγέλου τής δυμάνεως τοΰ θεοϋ, καταργούμαι ύπό Όυριήλ τοΰ άρχαγγέλου.\" 5) δτε δέ ήκουσα έγώ Σολομών τό όνομα τοΰ άρχαγγέλου ηΰξάμην καί έδόξασα τόν θεόν τοΰ οΰρανοϋ καί τής γης, καί σφραγίσας αυτόν έταξα εις τήν έργασίαν τής λιθοτομίας, τοΰ τέμνειν λίθους του vaoâ)...(my translation)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"d. Self-characterization and description of the demon (physical form, place of dwelling, evil actions). Sometimes it is introduced by a ques-tion: either \"what are your deeds?1' [τίνες εΐσιν αί πράξεις σου;] (Test. Sol. 6:4) or \"what is your activity?\" [τίς σου ή έργασία;] (Test. Sol. 25:1). e. Mention of the thwarting angel or archangel. It may be introduced by a direct question from Solomon: \"What angel is the one who thwarts you?\" (ποίος άγγελος έστίν ό καταργών σε;). f. Sealing of the demon. g. Commissioning of the demon to some task in the building of the Temple. Generally speaking, the above units form the core of the exorcistic formula; however this form is modified on several occasions, although always preserving the identificatory formula at the beginning. The exorcistic pattern of the form is evident in several details, such as the use of imperative forms (λέγε) and the recourse to direct address, both characteristic of exorcisms and apotropaic devices. The tone of the discourse constitutes a direct call to the demon that is being identified and, thereby, put under the dominion of the king or of the person using the technique. The insistence on the identification of the demons is typical of exorcism and magic, since knowledge of the name allowed dominion over the evil spirit. The scheme of the formula repeats itself throughout the whole Testament of Solomon with some minor variation. Thus, for example, when in Testament of Solomon 3, Ornias the demon introduces Beelzebul, the prince of demons, the question \"who are you?\" is preceded by a dialogue between both demons that includes the repetition of the magical technique used by the boy of the tale of Chapter 2; moreover, on this occasion the form consists simply of the \"who are you?\" unit and the self-identification of the demon (\"I am\"). The exorcistic unit, interrupted by the two units that de-scribe the demons Asmodaeus and Onoskelis, is resumed in chap-ter 6; here some additional questions (Test. Sol. 6:1) are added, but they seem to be a secondary addition to the structure of the exorcistic unit. The questions about the powers and evil deeds of the demon (Test. Sol. 6:7) and about its astrological sign are distributed in a different way, except for the mention of the thwarting angel.

The formula itself exhibits some variation in its wording, but the core of the exorcist formula in the Testament is the question \"who are you?\", the self-identification of the demon (\"I am called X\"), the mention of the contrary angel, and perhaps the allusion to the sealing of the demon. The active role of King Solomon is the second strand that gives structure to the text. In this way, the text acquires a consistency that the demonological material it includes does not easily convey. If we compare the formula that occurs in the Testament with the one of 11 QPsAp3, it is clear that the exorcistic formula of the Tes-lament is longer and more developed in content and structure. How-ever, what could be considered as the principal traits of identity appears in both of them, namely the mention of Solomon, obviously more important in the Testament than in the Qumranic apocryphal psalm, and the question \"who are you?\" In both texts these traits are directly addressed to the demon who is to be repelled. Further, we can add a third distinctive characteristic which both texts share: they are unmistakably exorcistic in their content and practical in their objectives. In 11 QPsApa the use of imperatives indicates that actual instructions are being given to expelled demons; in Testament of Solomon the pseudepigraphcal fiction is so well constructed and developed that the practical aim of the text appears blurred, but both the role played by Solomon and the use of the formula make up the true character of the Testament as a manual for exorcism. However, it would be useful if we can find an external witness that supports our hypothesis about the actual purpose of the Testament of Solomon. Fortunately enough, a Greek text shows how the Testament was re-garded, and used, as a handbook for exorcism. The Greek text under consideration is found in a manuscript of the eighteenth century CE.34 Although quite fragmentary, this text is most interesting be-cause it contains a series of exorcisms in which magic and gnostic doctrines are intermingled.5 ' Besides, some of these exorcisms com-34 Manuscript 825 of the National Library of Athens; for a description of the same see A.

Among the various exorcisms in the manuscript there is one, called \"Another Prayer of Saint Athanasius the Great of Alexandria,\"36 in which King Solomon appears several times. This \"prayer\" incorpo-rates a series of different exorcisms that are introduced one after the other, without apparent structure; their character is very mixed, since they share evident Christian traits, as the invocations to the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost clearly show, pagan traits, such as the invocation of the Sun, and what could be defined as Jewish traits, mainly allusions to biblical passages always taken from the Old Testament. Furthermore, these three types of material are not in-termingled but instead are located in successive blocks, as the fol-lowing example clearly shows: I adjure you, every impure and evil spirit, by the seven letters that are written in the heart of the Sun, and no one reads them, but God the Lord. I adjure you, evil spirits, by the three-pointed bird that hovers over the head of our Lord Jesus Christ. I adjure you, every impure and defiled spirit, by the incorporeal archangels of the great God, Michael, Gabriel, Uruel and Raphael, and by the many-eyed Cheru-bim and the seven-winged Seraphim (who with two wings hide their face, with two [wings] hide their feet, and with two fly, while crying and saying: Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord Sabaôth, heaven and earth are filled with your glory).37 The text goes on to combine materials of different origin, in which there are repeated references to archangels, seraphim and cherubim. Accordingly, it seems probable that the text combines and preserves ancient exorcistic texts, despite the late date of the manuscript and its unmistakably Christian transmission and revision.

I adjure you, the evil spirit called Ornias, the demon of love, the one who is thwarted by Michael the archangel, retreat from so-and-so servant of God. I ad-jure you, Beelzeboul, the ruler of the demons, the one who makes mankind adore the demons, the one who resides in the evening star, the one who is thwarted by the all-powerful God and by Elôith the great name of His power, retreat from so-and-so servant of God. I adjure you, the evil female demon, the one who is called Onoschelida, the embodied spirit, the one who lurks in the earth, and who has her den in cliffs, caves, and ravines, the one who has sexual intercourse with men because they think you are a woman according to your appearance, the one who is thwarted by the holy Iel, our Lord Jesus Christ; retreat from so-and-so servant of God.38 This exorcism confirms the actual function of the Testament of Solomon as a handbook for exorcism, in which the different demons and the means for exorcizing them are described. The present text transforms the material contained in the Testament of Solomon into a real exor-cism, presenting it as though uttered by Saint Athanasius. Undoubt-edly, the pseudepigraphical Christian attribution to this saint is weak at best, since here an exorcist is taking as the basis of his praxis a writing that he thought was composed by King Solomon and that perhaps was viewed as containing some problematic doctrines or techniques, since he felt it necessary to give to the text an unequivo-cally Christian veneer by attributing it to the saint and by includ-ing in the body of the exorcism Christological allusions that were not present in the Testament. The exorcism follows closely the 38 ορκίζω ύμάς, πάντα τά πονήρα καί άκάθαρτα πνεύματα τά γραφέντα έν τη Διαθήκη τοΰ βασιλέως Σολομώντος, κατά τοΰ ονόματος τοΰ Σαβαώθ, ϊνα μηκέτι είσέλθητε εις τόν δοΰλον τοΰ θεοΰ όδείνα. ορκίζω σε, δαιμόνιον πονηρόν τό καλούμενον Όρνίας, ό έρωτοδαίμων τό καταργούμενον υπό Μιχαήλ τοΰ άρχαγγέλου, άναχώρησον άπό τόν δούλον τοΰ Θεοΰ όδείνα. ορκίζω σε, Βεελζεβούλ, τόν άρχοντα τών δαιμόνων, τόν ποιοΰντα τοΰς άνθρώπους σεβέ-σθαι τούς δαίμονας, τόν κειμένον έν τω έσπερίω άστρω, τόν καταργούμενον ύπό τοΰ παντοκράτορος Θεοΰ καί εις τό Έλωίθ τό μέγα όνομα τής δυνάμεως αύτοΰ, άναχώρησον άπό τόν δούλον τοΰ θεοΰ όδείνα. ορκίζω σε, δαιμόνιον πονηρόν τό Θήλεια καί έγκυόμενον τό καλούμενον Όνοσχελίδα, τό σεσωμα-τωμένον πνεύμα, τό φωλεΰον έπί τής γής καί έχον τήν κατοίκησιν έν κρημνοις καί έν σπηλαίοις καί έν φαραγγίοις, τό συγγινόμενον τοις άνθρώποις κατά φαντασίαν ώς γυναίκα νομίζουσι είναι, τό καταργούμενον ύπό τόυ άγιου Ιήλ τοΰ Κυρίου ήμών ,Ιησού Χριστοΰ, άναχώρησον άπό τόν δούλον τοΰ Θεοΰ όδείνα (Α.

Occasionally some new details can be added, as the in-elusion of the word \"demon of erotic love\" (έρωτοδαίμων) attests, while in another, the description of the demon is omitted or abbre-viated; in the first part of the exorcism a physical description of each demon is given, while in the part dealing with the decans the accent is on the description of the sickness that each of these demons pro-duces. The whole text of the exorcisms has a clear focus on magical medicine, since a good deal of it is dedicated to the procedures for exorcizing the 36 decans who are supposed to be responsible for different sicknesses. At least on one occasion one of the decans is linked with a zodiacal sign, which shows how Solomon the exorcist was linked with astrology and could eventually be characterized as an astrologer.39 In conclusion, both the Testament of Solomon and the Exorcism of the MS 825 of the National Library of Athens seem to prove that the question \"who are you?\" functions in an exorcistic context; in both texts, this formula is closely bound to the king and, as the Greek exorcism shows, has a clear apotropaic content. The occurrence of the formula in both texts is clearly related to 11 QPsApa where it appeared as well in a context in which both David and his son Solomon seemed to play some role.

We shall see how the whole structure of the exorcism that appeared in the Testament of Solomon and in the so-called \"Prayer of Saint Athanasius\" has 'been taken over by the writer of the Questions of Bartholomew and adapted to a new function that was determined by the genre of the Questions. The Questions of Bartholomew, also known as the Gospel of Bartholomew, is a Christian work that deals with themes such as various aspects of Christ's descent, the annunciation, the origin of Satan and of his power in the world. Its structure is formed by a series of questions and answers on the above motifs, reminiscent of certain character-istics of apocalyptic literature.40 The Questions were written in Greek, possibly in Egypt, sometime between the second and the fifth cen-tury CE and there are Latin and Slavonic versions that can be used to fill in the lacunae of the Greek text.41 The Questions share several aspects with the Testament of Solomon, such as the language, place, and aproximate date of composition; further investigation of the text itself will illuminate, as we shall see, some details that could be signifi-cant for our understanding of the traditions about Solomon and the demons. The Questions of Bartholomew are constructed around a series of questions and answers; thus in a particular passage (4.1-60), Jesus is discussing the nature of sin, and as a consequence Bartholomew asks Jesus to disclose the adversary of men (i.e. Beliar). After an initial reluctance, Jesus grants him the request; as we shall see the text follows the structure of the exorcistic formula that we have encoun-10 On the apocalyptic literature and its imagery and literary devices see J.J.

The text, although quite long, is worth quoting in full, since it clearly illustrates the development of the formula \"who are you?\" within a new genre and religious context: And he led them down from the Mount of Olives and looked wrath-fully upon the angels that keep hell (Tartarus), and beckoned to Michael to sound the trumpet in the height of the heavens. And Michael sounded, and the earth shook, and Beliar came up, being held by six hundred and sixty angels and bound with fiery chains. 13) And the length of him was one thousand six hundred cubits and his breadth forty cubits, and his face was like a lightning of fire and his eyes full of darkness. And out of his nostrils came a stinking smoke; and his mouth was like the gulf of a precipice, and one of his wings was four-score cubits. 14) And straightaway when the apostles saw him, they fell to the earth on their faces and became as dead. 15) But Jesus came near and raised the apostles and gave them a spirit of power, and he said to Bartholomew, 'Come near, Bartholomew, and trample your feet on his neck, and he will tell you his work, what it is, and how he deceives men' (έρώησον αΰτώ τί έργον αύτοΰ ήν, [ή πώς άπατφ τούς ανθρώπους). 16) And Jesus stood afar off with the rest of apostles. 17) And Bartholomew was afraid and raised his voice and said, 'Blessed be the name of your immortal Kingdom from henceforth even for ever.' And when he had spoken, Jesus ordered him, saying, 'Go and tread upon the neck of Beliar.' and Bartholomew ran quickly upon him and trod upon his neck, and Beliar trembled. 18) And Bartholomew was afraid and fled, and said to Jesus, 'Lord give me a hem of your gar-ments that I may have courage to draw near to him.' 19) But Jesus said to him, 'You cannot take a hem of my garments, for these are not my garments which I wore before I was crucified.' 20) And Bartholomew said, 'Lord I fear lest, just as he did not spare your angels, he swallow me up also.' 21) Jesus said to him, 'Were not all things made by my word, and by the will of my Father the spirits were made subject to Solomon? You, therefore, being commanded by my word, go in my name and ask him what you will.' 22) And Bartholomew went and trod upon his neck, and pressed down his face into the earth as far as his ears. 23) And Bartholomew said to him, 'Tell how you are and what is your name' (Είπέ μοι τίς ει συ καί τί τό όνομα σου). And he said to him, 'Lighten me a little, and I will tell you who I am and how I came hither, and what my work is and what my power • 42י IS.

The new location works as a tran-sition to the core of the unit, which begins precisely with the beck-oning of Jesus to Michael the archangel, who summons the prince of demons to the presence of Jesus and the apostles. This detail is quite significant because in the Testament of Solomon as well Michael is the angel charged with the commission of giving a ring to King Solomon. Thus, in both texts, Michael introduces the demons di-rectly (Questions) or indirectly (Testament); it is unlikely that this is a simple coincidence, but rather first-hand evidence for the transfor-mation of the structure of the Testament of Solomon by the compiler of the Questions of Bartholomew. Afterwards, Beliar is presented, chained (again a detail in com-mon with the Testament of Solomon), and a complete physical descrip-tion of his fiery aspect is given. This last point represents a slight departure from the structure of the formula of the Testament that we outlined above, but only in the order followed, since both the Tes-lament and the Questions do have a complete description of the de-mons; in the Testament the description follows the \"who are you?\" question, whereas in the Questions, it apparently precedes the ques-tion. Jesus then gives specific instructions on how to handle the demons: the apostle has physically to subdue him and to ask the demon about his works (τί έργον αύτοϋ ην;) and how he deceives men (πώς άπατα τούς άνθρώπους;). Both questions occur in the scheme of the formula \"who are you?,\" which provides the struc-ture for the demonology of the Testament of Solomon and which has a long history as 11 QPsApa proves; in fact the question τί έργον αυτοΰ ήν; of the Questions is clearly parallel to the forms we find in the Test. Sol 6:4 (τίνες ε'ίσιν αί πράξει σου;) and 25:1 (τίς σου ή έργασία;). It seems that the author of the (Questions was aware of the existence of the exorcistic formula used in the Testament of Solomon and used it to structure a passage of an exorcistic nature in order to make it look authentic; this supposes that the various questions were considered as integral parts of a contemporary real technique of exorcism. However, this exorcism was modified to fit the new con-text of the Questions, which were not concerned with exorcisms but with various themes of Christian doctrine. The passage continues by showing how the terrible aspect of the demon makes the apostle faint. Utterly afraid, the latter finally asks for a piece of the garment of Jesus which is here clearely viewed as having apotropaic power. After denying the petition, Jesus counters"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Bartholomew's doubts in terms that are very interesting for us: Were not all things made by my word, and by the will of my Father the spirits were made subject to Solomon (ουχί λόγω τώ έμώ πάν γέγονεν καί tfj διανόια τοΰ πατρός μου τά πνεύματα τώ Σολομώνι ύπετάγησαν;)? You, therefore, being commanded by my word, go in my name and ask him what you will (IV. 21). Here we have a direct reference to the tradition about the subjec-tion of every evil spirit to Solomon in a context where it is com-bined with a reference to the power of the name of Jesus. It is likely that the author of the Questions was combining both and that he was aware of the polemical rivalry between Jews and Christian concerning the power over demons exercised by Solomon and Jesus. The men-tion of Solomon in a situation where exorcistic matters are alluded must have functioned as a token of authenticity and, at the same time, made Solomon clearly subordinate to the figure of Jesus, quite a common tendency in early Christian literature. We now come to the point where Bartholomew treads upon the neck of the demon and asks two questions. The treading on the neck is reminiscent of various amulets where a figure, identified as King Solomon, treads upon a female demon while piercing her with a spear; it is quite probable that we have here a link with the icono-graphical tradition which clearly depicts the domination of the de-mon at the hands of powerful kings. The magical overtones of both situations are clear.4 5 In the same way, the questions \"who are are?\" (τίς εί σύ;) and \"what is your name?\" (τί τό όνομά σου;) that the apostle addresses to the demon are the same as the ones that Solomon repeats in the Testament when he is invoking the demons; these questions comprise the true core of an old exorcist formula, as 11 QPsApa seems to attest, a formula that is used in the Questions as a pseudo-exorcistic motif, since it does not introduce a complete description of the demon and his deeds but rather a description of the heavens and the angelic ranks, much as we find in some apoca-lyptic texts and in some works of Hekhalot literature.44 Nevertheless, 43 It should be added that the medieval representations of Saint George conquering the dragon could have been derived from the Solomon-amulets of Late Antiquity; in the medieval representation Saint George treads upon the neck of the dragon while piercing it, which to some extent parallels the present text. 44 However, the Latin text of MS.

We can then conclude that the author of the Questions of St. Bartholomew was aware of the traditions that linked Solomon with dominion over the demons, as well as the correspondence established in this respect between the figures of Jesus and Solomon. The spe-cial adaptation of the exorcistic formula that we postulate for the structure of the Testament of Solomon supports the hypothesis of the use of this formula as an exorcistic device in Late Antiquity. The presence of King Solomon in a context that contains slightly modi-fied versions of the questions that comprise the formula seems to support our hypothesis of a clear link between the exorcistic formula (\"who are you?\") and King Solomon in Late Antiquity. As for the origin of such a formula, it is necessary to take into account differ-ent data. The immediate motive for the use of the formula is that knowledge of the name supposes power over the thing or person named, as even a cursory reading of the magical corpus of the PGM proves. However, this does not explain the actual structure of the formula nor its penchant for the question form. The only way to explain it without referring to the inner workings of magic is to find some type of parallel in a Jewish work, or genre, which could ex-plain it in reasonable and convincing terms. There are two types of literature that at least in some degree parallel this interest in the names of demons and angels exhibited by the structure of the exorcistic formula: apocalyptic and hekhalot literature. Thus, in 1 Enoch 20 there is the list of the names of the archangels and their functions in the universe; in 1 Enoch 40:8-10 Enoch wants to know the names of the four angels, which his ac-companying angel reveals to him together with their functions: \"Who are these four faces which I have seen and whose voices I have heard and written down?\" And lie said to me, \"The first one is the merciful and forbearing Michael; the second one, who is set over all disease and every wound of the children of the people, is Raphael; him, which is a clearer parallel to the structure of the formula we have found in the Testament of Solomon. This could mean that the expansive character of the Casanatensis could sometimes be more original, since it fills the lacunae of the Greek text and at the same time offers a more logical flow of discourse."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"the third, who is set over all exercise of strength, is Gabriel; and the fourth, who is set over all actions of repentance unto the hope of those who would inherit eternal life, is Phanuel by name.\"45 Apart from the obvious differences, this passage from Enoch paral-lels to some extent the formula found in the Testament of Solomon. We are aware that it is not possible to claim a direct link between these two texts, but it can exhibit from which literary genre and social ambience the exorcistic formula \"who are you?\" might have origi-nated, namely, from sets of questions and answers about eschatology and the future in apocalyptic literature. Besides, the importance of the names and the questions that lead to the knowledge of such names is common to other non-Jewish works that are heavily indebted to Jewish sources such as the Gnostic tractates the Hypostasis of the Archons and On the Origin of the World. Thus we read in the Hypostasis of the Archons 11,4: Norea said, \"Who are you?\" The rulers of unrighteousness had with-drawn from her. He said, \"It is I who am Eleleth, sagacity, the great angel, who stands in the presence of the holy spirit. I have been sent to speak with you and save you from the grasp of the lawless. And I shall teach you about your root.\"46 The question \"Who are you?\" introduces an angelic figure who is identified in this way; again, we find a similar procedure in On the Origin of the World II, 5 and XIII, 2: Then when the seven rulers came, they saw him and were greatly disturbed. They went up to him and seized him. And he (viz. the chief ruler) said to the breath within him, \"Who are you? And whence did you come hither?\" It answered and said, \"I have come from the force of the man for the destruction of your work.\" When they heard, they glorified him, since he gave them respite from the fear and the anxi-ety in which they found themselves. Then they called that day \"Rest,\" in as much as they had rested from toil. And when they saw Adam could not stand up they were glad, and they took him and put him in Paradise. And they withdrew up to their heavens.47 45 For the present translation see E. Isaac, \" 1 (Ethiopie Apocalypse of) Enoch,\" inj. H.

In fact, these two gnostic tractates stand out because of the Jewish sources they have incorporated in different ways.48 In the same way, hekhalot literature has an obvious interest in the names of the angels and in the Name of God. Thus in the Sefer Hekhalot the role played by the names of the angels and the form in which the description of the angels is arranged have certain simi-larities with the ways the different demons are presented in the Testament of Solomon: R. Ishmael said: Then I questioned the angel Metatron, Prince of the Divine Presence. I said to him, \"What is your name?\" He answered, \"I have seventy names, corresponding to the seventy nations of the world, and all of them are based on the name of the King of kings of kings; however my King calls me 'Youth.'\"49 Again, despite the evident similarities in the wording of the passage we cannot claim a direct relationship; what we can claim is that before the beginning of the common era a formula existed for in-troducing and identifying powerful beings that was adopted by dif-ferent trends and types of Judaism. In some way, at least as early as the first century BCE, it was linked to Solomon and to the tradi-tions that boasted of his powers over demons; but at the same time it was adopted by other types of literatures such as the Hekhalot the World (11,5 and XIII,2) in J. M. Robinson (ed.), Nag Hammadi Library in English, 171-189, 182. 48 On this aspect and the relation between Judaism and Gnosticism see B. A. Pearson, Gnosticism, Judaism, and Egyptian Christianity (Studies in Antiquity and Christianity; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), 10-28, 39-51, 124-147.

Scholen!, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (Second Edition; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1965). This is not the only parallel that can be quoted to show the similarities and parallelisms of the formula used in writings attributed to Solomon and the ones that appear in the present hekhalot text; in fact, almost the entire text is a description of the angels, their functions and their names (see chaps. 17, 18, 19)."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"theurgic texts.5\" It is quite evident that the treatment of the formula in both types of traditions and texts had to differ since the exorcist viewed the angels and demons as actual realities, whereas the theurgist was interested in the names of angelic figures as hypostases of divine power.51 However, both considered that knowledge of the name, i.e. the identification of the celestial reality, presupposed power. Thus, from a common origin in apocalyptic texts, the formula had very different paths of development. We can then conclude that the linking of Solomon with this formula was made as early as the first century CE, the date of 11QPsApa; it functioned as an exorcistic device and was considered as such since its use in the Questions of Bartholomew to lend the right tone to the summoning of Beliar. The Testament of Solomon made use of the same formula to structure its demonological material and to demonstrate an exorcistic technique. Besides, the formula was also used in apocalyptic works and in Gnostic and Hekhalot literature, and it is likely that it was also employed as an identification device in other literary genres.52 SOLOMON, EXORCISM AND THE MAGIC RING We have just seen how the figure of Solomon as exorcist appears from quite an early date (at least from the first century CE), linked with an exorcistic formula that most probably had its roots in apoca-lyptic imagery and was afterwards adapted as a means of apotropaic invocation and linked to Solomon and perhaps to his father David as well. However, besides this tradition that connects Solomon with a very specific exorcistic technique, which quite probably resulted of the development of a Jewish tradition, there were other traditions that enjoyed great popularity in Late Antiquity, such as King Solomon's possession of a magic ring that allowed him to subdue the demons. In fact, we have seen how a ring was used by Solomon 50 We are aware of the relatively late date of the Sefer Hekhalot (fifth or six century CE), but it also contains old traditions; on this see Scholem, Gnosticism, 17, n. 19. 51 On this aspect see K. E. Grözinger, \"The Names of God and the Celestial powers: Their Function and Meaning in the Hekhalot Literature,\" Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought VI, 1-2 (1987), 53-69. 52 See 1 Sam 26:14; 2 Kgs 10:13; Cant 3:6; 6:10; 8:5;J0b 38:2. This does not invalidate our hypothesis, rather it supports it: there is such a formula because it is found in very different settings and it functions in form as an structuring device and in content as an identifying device."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"in the Testament in order to subdue the first demon, Ornias. In that instance, two different traditions appear to be mingled, one concern-ing the power of a magic ring and the other concerning an exorcistic formula (\"who are you?\"). King Solomon's ring and its power over demons appear in dif-ferent texts and amulets; both Jewish and Christian texts acknowl-edge this power and use the traditions concerning Solomon's ring.53 The origin of these traditions is quite probably extra-textual, that is, it is to be found in actual magic and exorcistic praxis, in which different objects, such as swords and rings, were endowed with power over the spiritual and demonic world; thus even a very cursory reading of the Greek magic papyri shows the importance that the ring had as a magic instrument in different procedures.54 However, the mention of the ring in connection with Solomon is usually linked with exorcisms. Thus, we can read in a Christian phylactery against a female demon called Gelou: [Amulet for small children: concerning Gelou] In the beginning the word was. And the darkness did not seize him [corrupted text]...

As these amulets mention the ring in connection with other traditions about Solomon, they have been studied in the Ch. 6, \"Solomon, the Son of David\" and Ch. 7, \"Solomon the Horseman.\" However, it should be noted that the bowls seem to understand the \"ring of Solomon\" as an hypostasis of power; that is, the mere mention of the \"ring of Solomon\" has apotropaic effect. The Babylonian Talmud (b. Git. 68ab; the legend of the Shamir) also mentions Solomon's magic ring; on this parallel see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (6 vols.; Philadephia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1968), 4.165-169; 6.299-302. 54 See, e.g., K. Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae.

The seal of the ring that Michael the archangel brought and it was given to King Solomon; and blast the evil ones!55 In this Christian amulet several details show how previous traditions were reworked. We have here an amulet against a female demon that was frequently linked to Solomon. The dangerous moments in which an attack could happen are named as well the names of ev-ery demon. The expression \"Jesus Christ conquers\" (,Ιησούς Χρισός νικά) that appears in our exorcism is also applied to Solomon in several amulets. In the view of the fact that this apotropaic expres-sion is followed by a reference to the king's ring working as a deter-rent against the demon, it is possible that this entire exorcism is a christianized version of one in which Solomon played the principal role. Although the manuscript in which the present amulet is found is dated by its editor to the eighteenth century CE, the actual re-daction of the amulet text is very probably Byzantine (sixth century CE?) and the original form could go back even further in time (fourth or fifth century CE?).56 We find very similar wording in other amulets; however some of them link this tradition to Egypt, which is quite interesting since several of the works studied above seem to point 55 Φυλακτήριον εις παιδία μικρά׳ περί Γέλου.

[...] ilee, evil demon, flee, our Lord Jesus Christ chases you from the servant of God.1' It is obvious that this amulet is related to the first one discussed, since it mentions a female demon (Onoskelis) and both Solomon and Michael appear in the same context. Although the ring does not occur in the present text, the same tradition of the ring is at work here. The mention of Egypt as the place where the amulet was given could mean that the whole tradition originated in a Hellenized Jewish setting in Egypt. In fact, there are other textual witnesses found in older manuscripts that even supplement the information about the origin of the tradition, establishing a sort of chain of tradition in which the archangel Michael, Moses and finally Solomon are presented as links in the transmission of the amulet.58 Besides the Greek witnesses, 57 Φυλακτήριον εις φάντασμα και ξύπασμα τής νυκτός καί ήμέρας.

Sol. 8 and a further proof of the relationship of astrology to the king, since these seven spirits most probably stand for the seven planets.60 There are other Hebrew amulets that parallel the diseases adjured in the Greek examples, especially the fever and shivering fever, which shows that we have this type of amulet, which establishes a curious chain of tradition, see A. Delatte, Anecdota Atheniensia, 126, in which the same wording appears again. Generally speaking, the repeated mention of fevers and different evil things goes back with all certainty to the third or fourth century CE, since there are several examples of amulets that have the same formulation, although not always linked to the apotropaic power of Solomon, these can be dated around these centuries; for the text of these amulets see, Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae, 11.212 (P 5b), 11.218 (P 10; that can be compared with Delatte, Anecdota Atheniensia, 243-247 passim), 11.227 (P 18); see also W.

Fortunately, there is such an example in which the seal of Solomon is mentioned within a syncretistic context that, none-theless, indicates the importance of the Jewish material. The example is from the so-called \"Great magic Papyrus\" of Paris, which is itself a veritable compendium of magic practices in Late Antiquity; it was copied around the beginning of the fourth century which means that its Vorlage is even older, perhaps going back to the end of the sec-ond century CE or the beginning of the third.62 The fragment (PGM IV: 3007-86) is entitled \"a tested charm of Pibechis\" and describes a procedure to help those possessed by demons.65 It reads as fol-lows: A tested charm of Pibechis for those possessed by demons.

The Jewish material employed includes references to events surrounding the Exodus,66 the seal of Solomon, the tower of Babel, Jerusalem and the light of the menorah in the Temple. Also, at the end of the amulet the necessity of not eating pork and of keep-ing pure is mentioned \"for the charm is Hebraic and is preserved among pure men.\" It may be supposed that the magician who ed-ited the charm was aware of some of the laws of purity and of cer-tain Jewish dietary customs and felt that for correct use of the amulet ritual purity was required. The story of the exodus enjoyed consid-erable popularity among Jewish and Christian magicians and most probably among pagan ones as well, since there are several examples of its use in magic and exorcistic contexts.67 In the present text it is χερουβίν. ορκίζω σε τόν περιθέντα όρη τη θαλάσση ή τείχος έξ άμμου, και έπιτάξαντα αύτη μή ύπερβήναι. και έπήκουσεν ή άβυσσος׳ και συ έπάκουσον, πάν πνεύμα δαιμόνιον, οτι ορκίζω σε τόν συνσείοντα τους τέσσαρας άνεμους άπό των Ιερών αιώνων, ούρανοειδή, θαλασσοειδή, νεφελοειδή, φωσφόρον, άδάμαστον. ορκίζω σε τόν έν xfj καθαρφ Ίεροσολύμω, φ τό άσβεστον πύρ διά πόντος αιώνος προσπαρακάεται, τώ ονόματι αΰτοϋ τω άγίω [nomina Barbara], ôv τρέμει γέννα πυρός και φλόγες περιφλογίζουσι και σίδηρος λακφ και πάν ορος εκ θεμελίου φοβείται, ορκίζω σε, πάν πνεύμα δαιμόνιον, τόν έφορώντα επί γης και ποιοΰντα εκτρομα τά θεμείλια αυτής και ποιήσαντα τά πάντα έξ ών ουκ όντων εις τό είναι, ορκίζω σε, τόν παραλαμβάνοντα τόν όρκισμόν τούτον, χοιρίον μή φαγεϊν, και ύποταγήσεταί σοι πάν πνεύμα και δαιμόνιον, όποιον εάν ην. όρκίζων δέ φύσα α' άπό των άκρων τών ποδών άφαίρων τό φύσημα εως του προσώπου, και είσκριθήσεται. φύλασσε καθαρός· ό γάρ λόγος έστίν Εβραϊκός και φυλασσόμενος παρά καθαροις άνδράσιν (Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae, I: 170-172 (IV 3009-3085)).

This impres-sion seems to be confirmed by the passage \"I conjure you, every daimonic spirit to tell whatever sort you may be, because I conjure you by the seal which Solomon placed on the tongue of Jeremiah and he told,\" where the demon is addressed in a form that reminds us indirectly of the \"who are you?\" formula found in the Testament of Solomon and in 11 QPsAp3. As the seal of Solomon is mentioned immediately afterwards, it is quite probable that we have here a transformed version of same tradition. In this case, a detail about the tongue of Jeremiah, probably inspired by some unknown haggadic midrash, is added to the tradition about the seal of Solomon, which provides further support for an original Jewish source for most of the amulet.68 The description of God as the sole creator and ruler \"I adjure you, demons [...] I adjure you by the power of Lord Sabaöth Adönai who is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, who chose from all the races and all the peoples Israel, the one who delivered the divine mysteries; I adjure you by the one who spoke to Moses and who gave him the law on Mount Sinai; I adjure you by the radiant God, [...] who afflicted Egypt with the seven plagues and brought out his people from there; I adjure by the powers of the Lord who broke through the Red Sea with a rod and carried across Moses after ordering him to make this thing and who carried his people across the sea; I adjure you by the power of the God of the terrible tent, the one who freed his people with a strong hand and an extended arm\" (δαίμονες, [...], ορκίζω σάς κατά τής δυνάμεως κυρίου Σαβαώθ 'Αδωναί δς έστίν Θεός τοΰ Αβραάμ, θεός τοΰ 'Ισαάκ, Θεός τοΰ 'Ιακώβ, όστις έξελέξατο παρά πάσας τάς γενεάς καί παρά πάντα τά έθνη τόν 'Ισραήλ, ός παρέδωκεν τά θεια μυστήρια, ορκίζω σας κατ' έκείνου τοΰ λαλήσαντος μέ τόν Μωυσήν καί δόντος αύτω τόν νόμον έν τφ όρει τω Σινφ, ορκίζω σας, δαίμονες, εις τόν Θεόν τόν φωτεινόν [...], τόν μαστιγώσαντα μέ ταίς δέκα πληγαίς τήν Α'ίγυπτον καί έξαγαγόντα τόν λαόν αύτοΰ έξ αυτής, ορκίζω σας κατά τής δυνάμεως Κυρίου τοΰ διαρρήξαντος ράβδω τήν έρυθράν θάλασσαν καί διαγαγόντα τόν Μωυσήν προστάξαντος ταύτα ποιήσαι καί διαγαγόντος τόν λαόν αύτοΰ διά θαλάσσης״ ορκίζω σας κατά τής δυνάμεως τοΰ θεοΰ τής φοβέρας σκενής έλυτρώσατο κύριος έν χειρί κραταιή καί έν βραχίονι ύψηλω αύτοΰ״). This text, which is found in a Greek manuscript of the eighteenth century (Codex 115 of the Historical Society of Athens), appears to be a true cento or anthology of biblical quotations traditionally used in exorcistic and magical contexts; the full text also mentions the temple, the tablets of the Law and the Tabernacle as apotropaic and coercive elements. Although the copy is late, its sources and the traditions it preserves are quite early (third century CEP); besides, they all also appear to be related to Solomon, who is no longer an exorcist but a magician. 68 On the haggadic source of the reference of Jeremiah and the seal of Solomon see D. Sperber, \"Some Rabbinic Themes in Magical Papyri,\" JSJ 16 (1985), 93-103; unfortunately, the parallels adduced by the author, although slighdy connected with the tradition of the present text, do not shed light on it. Sperber seems to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"of nature reminds us strongly of the divine description that appeared in 11 QPsApa, where the creative capacity of God was opposed to the incapacity of the demons. It seems that both texts use the same formulations and in both Solomon is mentioned in close connection with demons and exorcism. Finally it should be noted that once more Solomon and Jesus appear together in an exorcism. This last example clearly shows the importance of the exorcistic tradition of the seal of Solomon because already in the third cen-tury CE its fame was sufficiently to be included together with other Jewish traditions within a syncretistic exorcism that was most prob-ably edited by a pagan practitioner. The traditions about the exorcistic power of the seal of Solomon were very much alive by the fourth century; in fact, we possess several accounts of pilgrims to the holy places of the fourth and fifth centuries C.E. who claim to have seen either the seal of Solomon or the place where he used to expel the demons.69 As these witnesses are undoubtedly Chris-explain obscura per obscuriora. On the Jewish materials in magical papyri see also M. Smith, \"The Jewish Elements in the Magical Papyri,\" Society of Biblical Literature 1986 Seminar Papers (1986), 455-62; M. Rist, \"The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: A Liturgical and Magical Formula,\" JBL 57 (1938), 289-303. Besides, it has to be noted that recension D of the Testament of Solomon has what seems to be an allusion to the Paralipomena of Jeremiah (manuscript E; McCown, Testament, 102-120, esp. 119); the version of the Testament of Solomon that Delatte edited in his Anecdota (Manuscript 2011 of the National Library, 210-227) is also clearly related to recension D and, like it, includes the allusion to the Paralipomena. We could, then, ask ourselves whether the obscure passage about the \"tongue of Jeremiah\" being sealed by the seal of king Solomon has something to do with the allusions to the Paralipomena we find in one recension of the Testament. If so, it would mean that both the Testament and the present magical papyrus used the same sources or that both pertained to the same circles. If so thejewishness of the sources of the material included in the papyrus would be greatly reinforced and the popularity of Solomon as exorcist in Late Antiquity unequivocally demonstrated. 69 The fourth century pilgrimage of the Spanish nun Egeria is the most conspicuous and early example of such \"touristic\" visits to the holy places in Late Antiquity; she explicitly mentions both the seal and the spot where it was preserved (P. Geyer, Itinera Hierosolymitana, Vindobonae: 1893, p. 21): At ubi autem osculatifuerint crucem, pertransierint, stat diaconus, tenet anulum Salomonis et cornu illud, de quo reges ungebantur.

They kiss also the horn and give heed also to the ring\"). In addition to this we can quote the testimony of a pilgrim from Bordeaux who wrote in 333 (Geyer, Itinera, 21): Est ibi et crepta ubi Salomon daemones torquebat (\"the crypt where Solomon examined the demon is there as well\"). A very similar note can be found in the Breviarius de Hierosolyma (Geyer, Itinera, p. 154) which is dated to 530 C.E.: illud cornu, quo David unctus est et Salomon et ille anulus ibidem, unde Salomon sigillavit demones, et est de electro (\"that horn, from which David"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"tian, they prove that these traditions were not viewed as objection-able or reprehensible among Christians, despite the rivalry estab-lished between Jesus and Solomon who were both considered as figures endowed with power over demons. CONCLUSIONS In the preceding pages we have tried to explain the characteriza-tion of King Solomon as exorcist and its development in different texts and periods. It is most probable that the traditions that con-tained information about Solomon and the demons were quite com-mon as early as the second century BCE; the origin of such a link could be due to a transformation of the Hellenistic royal ideology, with its interest in the extraordinary abilities and power of the king, regarded as an individual and with a close relationship to the di-vine. Such royal ideology, combined with some attributes taken from the figure of the divine man (θειός άνήρ) who in virtue of his supe-rior intellect could rule the spiritual world, is probably the basis for the formation of the Solomonic tradition of exorcism. This tradi-tion had an extraordinary development in the Hellenistic setting of Judaism, and of Christianity when it was still a Jewish sect. The principal feature of this tradition is the use of the exorcistic formula \"who are you?,\" which at Qumran (11QPsApa) already appears in exorcisms where Solomon seems to play some role. The combina-tion of the formula and the figure of the king occurs in a fully de-veloped form in the exorcistic handbook called Testament of Solomon; was anointed and Solomon as well, and that ring, with which Solomon sealed the demons and which is made from electrum\"). The mention of electrum as the material from which the ring was made is also found in an alchemical text preserved in Syriac (see the Ch. 9, \"Solomon the Astrologer\"), which clearly shows the acceptance of the traditions about the seal of Solomon in very different settings and the fidelity to the nucleusof such traditions. Finally, we can observe in the following passage from the Breviarius (Geyer, Itinera, p. 153) how different traditions were integrated in everyday life: in circuitu duodecim columnae marmoreae (omnino incredibile), super ipsas columnas hydúae argenteae duodecim, ubi sigillavit Salomon daemones (\"in a circle there are twelve columns made of marble [absolutely unbelievable], over the same columns there are twelve vessels made of silver, where Solomon sealed the demons\"). The pilgrim is describing the apse of the church of Constantine or, the Martyrium; the fact that elements from the traditions concerning Solomon's power over the demons were forged for the pious tourist again shows the popularity of such traditions and the inability of the church to uproot such beliefs from the people's imagination."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"in this work both Solomon and the formula are clearly linked, func-tioning together as the structuring and pseudepigraphical device that forms the framework of the text. This combination occurs in other works, such as the (Questions of Bartholomew, which can be dated be-tween the second and fifth century CE; in this text the role of Solomon and the exorcistic formula is not so central but they are introduced in a pseudo-exorcist context, which seems to prove that they were naturally associated with this type of situation. Such tra-ditions enjoyed considerable popularity in a period extending from the first century CE to the eighth CE, when they undergo further development with the addition of folkloristic elements that diverge from the source tradition about Solomon and the demons.70 70 We can find an indirect account of the popularity of Solomon as an exor-cist in the works of several early Byzantine chronographers: Georgios Hamartolos, ca 850 (Chron. II 42, 4; Patrologia Graeca 110: 249 c); Cedrenus, ca 1100 (Patrologia Graeca 121:156 B, 196 D); Zonaras, te 1150 (.Patrologia Graeca 134: 168 B); Michael Glykas, ca 1150 (Patrologia Graeca 158, 349 C); Niketas Akominatos Choniates, ca 1200 (De Manuele Comneno IV 95 [Patrologia Graeca 139, 489 A]). All these writers when describing Solomon draw extensively on Josephus' Antiquities, specially from the part where the special wisdom of Solomon regarding the demons and an explicit case of exorcism in his name are reported (Jewish Antiquities 8:42-49). The fact that all of them agree in reporting the power over the demons allegedly possessed by Solomon, instead of omitting such a dubious account, seems to suggest that in their time such a characterization of the king was vox populi and that, in conse-quence, the necessity for some kind of support was acutely felt. On these Byzan-tine authors, see K.

Hermeticism is a philosophical and theological movement of Late Antiquity that is intimately linked to the legendary figure of the Egyptian god Thoth also known by the Greeks as Hermes Trismegistos (Hermes the Thrice-Great), who was considered the inventor of writing and patron of all the arts depen-dent on writing. The main manifestation of this movement is a collection of treatises (Hermetica) written in Greek and Latin in the form of Platonic dialogues from the mid-first century until the third century CE.1 Thus, Wisdom of Solomon and the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus introduce an image of King Solomon that adds traits not present in their biblical sources and incorporate ideas related to so-called \"popular\" Hermeticism.2 This kind of Hermeticism was principally concerned first with astrology, and later on with medicine, alchemy and magic, whereas \"learned\" Hermeticism was interested in theol-ogy and philosophy. The first kind of Hermeticism arose around the first century CE and was very much indebted to current theories about the unity of the cosmos and to concepts about the sympathy and antipathy of all the elements of the world.3 Both popular Her-metism and the occult sciences have in common their belief in the genuine uselfuness of the knowledge they manipulate; the power to 1 See G. Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993). 2 On 'popular' Hermeticism see A.J. Festugière, La révélation d'Hermès Trismégiste (3 vols; Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1986), 1.187-200. 3 About the sympathetic link between substances and the corresponding \"en-ergies\" (demons, planets, gods...) see A. J. Festugière, L'idéal religieux des Grecs et l'Evangile (Paris: Les belles lettres, 1932), 294-303."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"change states of nature and life is what both pursue.4 However, this distinction between \"popular\" and learned Hermetism should not be over-emphasized, since even so-called popular Hermetism pre-supposed a social and cultural milieu that may hardly be defined as popular. Wisdom of Solomon and the Jewish Antiquities are dated to the first century CE; Wisdom is located in a very hellenized Jewish setting, probably in Egypt, whereas the Antiquities, written in Rome, can be defined as a type of apologetic history addressed to gentile Greek readers. Both texts demonstrate adaptation of Hermetic doctrines to the figure of Solomon by starting from a particular exegesis of the biblical source. In the case of Wisdom of Solomon, the formula-tion of that adaptation is more 'learned' and shows the influence of some of the philosophical doctrines of the period, principally of the Stoic school. In the case of Antiquities, the formulation follows the biblical source more closely, although transforming it in ways that show the probable influence of those Hermetic doctrines, or at least of some similar movement.־' Since a considerable number of the Hermetic doctrines could have a Jewish origin, such doctrines might have been known to Josephus and the author of Wisdom of Solomon, in view of the way they reinterpret king Solomon.1' Furthermore, in the particular case of the Antiquities, the interest of Josephus in the portrayal of Solomon as exorcist indicates an interest in usefulness and praxis that is very characteristic of \"popular\" Hermetism. Let us study the ways in which this transformation of Solomon into a Hermetic figure took shape in each text. 4 The magic is not theoretical but practical and is interested in results; thus it is not a θεωρία, a contemplative science. Because of this, \"popular\" Hermetism is interested in the occult powers of animals, stones and plants, since such knowl-edge supposes the possibility of using them to control other situations or people. However, even popular Hermeticism is distinct from magic and exorcism, since it also has a basis in philosophy and is intimately related to theurgy. 5 See M. Wellmann, Der Physiologos. Eine religionsgeschichtlich-naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchung (Philologus, Supplement Band XXII, Heft 1; Leipzig: Dieterichsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1930), 58-59. The Physiologos is the standard book in Latin and Greek Late Antiquity and Middle Ages about the symbolic and typological significance of animals plants and stones. The Greek version is oldest among the surviving versions of this book. It comes from the fourth century CE but earlier forms of the text can be reconstructed; these forms originated in Alexandria in the High Roman Empire and were, thus, unaffected by Christianiy. 6 See Festugière, IM révélation, 1.210."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"SOLOMON THE HERMETIC SAGE IN WISDOM OF SOLOMON The Wisdom of Solomon is a clear example of the combination of Jewish culture with hellenistic philosophy; it has been dated to around the second quarter of the first century CE, as it was probably writ-ten during the reign of Caligula (37-41 CE). Written in Alexandria by an author with a sound knowledge of Greek language and phi-losophy, Wisdom of Solomon constitutes one of the most important works attributed to Solomon. Its structure responds to the Hellenis-tic genre of the protreptic (exhortatory discourse).7 The work is divided into three parts: the description of wisdom's gift of immor-tality (1-6:21); the nature and power of wisdom and Solomon's quest for her (6:22-10:21); and divine wisdom or justice in the Exodus (11-19).8 The pseudepigraphical ascription clearly determines the struc-ture of the work; although Wisdom of Solomon does not mention the king explicitly, it employs a complex system of allusions that makes this unnecessary: thus, Wis 1-6 refers constantly to Prov 1-9, which serves as a model and, at the same time, as a token of Solomonic authorship.9 The figure of the king is based, on the one hand, on the biblical text which furnishes the legendary notes, and on the other, on the attributes of Hellenistic theories of monarchy.10 However in Wis 6:22 and 7:15-22, which belong to the core of the work (Wis 6:22-10 -7 See J.

In Wis 6:22, Solomon tells the rulers of earth that he will com-municate to them what wisdom is without hiding any mystery. Here, Solomon appears as a teacher of a special knowledge that is to be communicated to students, a trait that also appears in other works such as the Testament of Solomon or the Hygromanteia, where Solomon is the teacher of secrets.\" In Wis 7:15-22, first the giver of the knowledge is identified, God himself is his teacher; thereafter, the exact nature of the promised knowledge is described in terms that point to a reinterpretation of the biblical source: 15. God grant me that I speak in accord with his wish, and conceive thoughts worthy of his gifts, for he himself is both the guide of Wisdom and corrector of the wise. 16. Both we and our words are in his hands, as well as all understand-ing and craftsmanship. 17.

See also M. Gilbert, \"La figure de Salomon en Sg 7-9,\" in R. Kuntzmann and J. Schlosser (eds.) Etudes sur lejudaisme Hellenistique: Congrès de Strasbourg [1983] (LD 119; Paris: Cerf, 1984), 225-49; idem, \"La struc-ture de la prière de Salomon (Sg 9),\" Biblica 51 (1970), 301-331."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"esting if we bear in mind the existence of later texts where Solomon, Hermetism and astrology appear in contact.14 The text states that the provider of the knowledge is God, whereas Solomon is only a disciple, who wishes to communicate the secrets handed down to him (Wis 7: 15-16); this fact reminds us of the general structure of Hermetic writings where Hermes, the god, gives to a disciple exact knowledge about the universe.15 These two verses serve as an in-traduction to the catalogue of knowledge, which is then listed in detail. The exact nature of the knowledge is explicitly detailed in Wis 7:17: the knowledge is 'infallible' because it is divinely given and it encompasses the whole universe (\"the things that are\"), its constitu-tion (\"the structure of the world\") and the working of its ultimate components (\"the activity of the elements\"). The Greek term for elements (στοιχεία) is clearly related to the Greek doctrine of the four elements (earth, water, air, fire), which is predominant in Hermetic teachings; an allegorical exegesis of 3 Kingdoms 5:13-14 supplies another reason for its presence in the text.16 In Wis 7:18, the nature of Solomon's knowledge is described; here, time and chronological matters are at the core. The terms used do not refer to history, but to the knowledge of temporal divisions; thus, χρόνοι means the times measured by the cycles of the planets, and the expression «the beginning, the end and the middle» is all-inclu-sive and signifies an exhaustive knowledge. The second part of the verse adds astronomical-astrological observations (\"the changes of the solstices, the alternations of the seasons\"), which are yet more precisely referred to in Wis 7:19 (\"the cycles of the year and the 14 Thus, Festugière interprets the passage in a magic-mystical way [La révélation, 1.41). Besides, it is clear that there are resemblances to the lists of secret things in apocalyptic literature; see M. E. Stone, \"Lists of Revealed Things in the Apoca-lyptic Literature,,י in Magnalia Dei: The Mighty Acts of God, F. M. Cross et al. (eds.) (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1976), 436-37. 15 For a modern study of general Hermetic conceptions see Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, 6-45. 16 On this aspect, see Ch. 3, above. It is probable that this interpretation of the biblical text is quite early (first century BCE). We find in the Koiranides (first century CE) and in the Hermetic writings (Sto. Herrn. Exc XIII [Kore Kosmou] 42) a similar kind of allegorical interpretation: \"Les Koiranides formaient un bestiaire où les animaux étaient étudiés selon les lettres de l'alphabet (κατά στοιχείον). Dans l'ouvrage original, l'ordre suivi était: oiseaux, animaux terrestres, poissons. Tel est bien en effect l'ordre hermétique, qui correspond à l'hiérarchie des éléments: feu - air - terre - eau\" (Festugière, IM révélation, 1.208)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"positions of the stars\"). The insistence on this kind of chronological knowledge shows how important it was for the author of Wisdom and his characterization of Solomon. Knowledge of time and its division is directly linked with the theory of cosmic sympathy, since on many occasions the power afforded by such knowledge also depends on the exact hour, day and month or on the planet that rules at that moment. Thus, Solomon is depicted not as astronomer or even astrologer, but as one who knows the relation between this power and the time at which it can be obtained. Wis 7:20 ends the enumeration of knowledge that has been com-municated to Solomon; the mention of his knowledge of tame and wild animals (\"the nature of the animals, and the tempers of the beast\") is a sign of the exceptional insight of the king, which also includes his familiarity with the power of spirits, the thoughts of men and, finally, the species of plants and the powers of roots. This verse constitutes a veritable repertoire of expertise comprising the core disciplines of magic that were central to popular Hermetism. The reference to the knowledge of the 'psychology' of the beasts may be interpreted in various ways: it is quite likely that the author is em-ploying or alluding to the tradition attested in Rabbinic and Islamic texts that makes Solomon conversant with the language of animals; besides, in astrological texts the mention of the taming of animals is frequent.17 Similarly, knowledge of the powers of roots and plants is commonplace in magic, astrology and Hermetism. Finally, in Wis 7:21 Solomon speaks again in the first person; he has known (εγνων) the occult and the overt because wisdom has taught him. This verse closes the catalogue of knowledge (Wis 7:17-20) with what seems to be an allusion to 1 Kgs 3:28 / 3 Kgdms 3:28.18 As seems clear from the above analysis, the lore that is described has little to do with biblical wisdom or purely scientific disciplines, despite Larcher's efforts to prove as much. As a matter of fact, each of the points listed is at the core of the Hermetism, astrology, or magic in general. Thus, on the one hand, the conception of the elements 17 See the Hygromanteia of Solomon (Appendix 1) passim; cf. also the gloss of Can-tacuzenus quoted in Larcher, Commentaire, p. 474: καί όπως ταύτα καταγοητεύεται καί τιθασοΰται, καί τήν αγριότητα πρός τό φιλάνθρωπον μετασκευάζει (\"and in this way those are enchanted and tamed, and he transforms the wild beast into being amicable towards men;\" my translation). 18 φρόνεσις 0εοΰ; .חכמת אלהים"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"and the structure of the universe has parallels in Hermetic texts;19 on the other, astrological/astronomical terms are used throughout the text;20 and finally, mention of the tempers of animals and beasts is also found in the so-called Physical In the same way, the refer-ence to the spirits points to traditions that we will see at work in other writings of the period; and the interest in the knowledge of plants and roots that the text suggests does not seem to refer a descriptive botany.22 All the elements of Solomon's knowledge are based on the same concept: cosmic sympathy.25 Thus, Solomon is described as a very 19 Cf A. D. Nock and A.J. Festugière, Corpus Hermeticum (4 vols; Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1972), 1.44, 61, 99, 116, 182; 2.205, 298; 3.24, 35. 20 τροπών άλλαγάς (Wis 7:18), αστέρων θέσεις (Wis 7:19).

Putnam's Sons, 1912). 21 See Festugière, La révélation, 1.143, 154, 195, 200. In fact the Physika could have Jewish roots: \"Comme le poème sur les poissons de Marcellus de Sidé (sous Hadrien) s'inspire très directement des Koiranides, celles-ci remontent donc au moins à la fin du 1er siècle de notre ère. [...] Ces trois textes (Timothée de Gaza, Physiologus, Koiranides) dérivent d'un même ouvrage de Physika du 1er siècle de notre ère, et cet ouvrage est si fortement marqué d'influences juives qu'on doit le supposer écrit par un auteur palestinien: il semble plausible de l'identifier avec les Φυσικά apocryphes du roi-prophète Salomon\" (Festugière, La révélation, 1.210). See also Wellmann, Physiologos, 55-60, where this hypothesis is developed. 12 On plants and their supposed powers see J. Bidez and F. Cumont, Les mages hellénisés, ^0r0astre, Ostanes et Hystaspe d'après la tradition grecque (2 vols; Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1938), 1.188-198. Flavius Josephus gives very similar information about the wisdom of Solomon (Jewish Antiquities 8:43-45); 1 Enoch 8 speaks of the \"cut-ting of roots\" and follows a very similar curriculum of lore with evident negative overtones. 23 See J. M. Hull, Hellenistic Magic and the Synoptic Tradition (Studies in Biblical Theology 28; London: SCM, 1974), 37: \"The basis of the system is a belief in non-human, superhuman usually invisible powers, including the gods themselves, the angelic beings, demons of various orders and the souls of heroes and men. But the distinctive development is a belief that these superhuman, supernatural entities are linked by invisible bonds of sympathy to visible and material things which are thus 'symbols' of the power to which they adhere - plants, minerals, animals, times and seasons. A further development leads to the theory that by knowledge of the powers, their sympathies and antipathies and their symbols, it is possible to influence the supernatural world. The art of magic is to collect such knowledge and apply it correctly so as to swing the enormous forces of the uni-verse in the desired direction.\" On sympathy and antipathy see also Hull, Helle-nistic Magic, 41-51; Festugière, La révélation, 1.90 and especially 1.91: \"Elle [the doctrine of the unity of the cosmos] est le fondement indispensable des pseudo-sciences -astrologie populaire ou savante, médecine astrologique, alchimie,- de la magie, de la gnose pénétrée de magie, de la théurgie et de tout l'art divinatoire quelles qu'en soient les formes...\""},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"special type of Magister omnium physicorum (\"Master of all natural things\"), as a model hermetic sage. This characterization of the king is completed by alluding to his knowledge of spirits, in accord with the tradition that described him as an exorcist; nevertheless, this last trait fits in well with the hermetic picture of Solomon, although probably it is the only traditional aspect that was incorporated into his character. The catalogue of knowledge that Solomon masters also is found applied to other figures but with a clearer magical orien-94 tation. In conclusion, in the first half of the first century CE Solomon was transformed into a Hellenized sage but without losing some tra-ditional traits (exorcism); that transformation took place in Egypt and, since it is not likely that it was created by the author of Wisdom of Solomon, it reflected a common picture of the king at least in certain quarters. The fact this picture endure and survived would explain how a text such as the Hygromanteia of Solomon could be the product of a Jewish environment, even though this transformation of the figure of Solomon began at a quite early date. SOLOMON THE HERMETIC SAGE IN JOSEPHUS' JEWISH ANTIQUITIES 8.4-50 The portrait of Solomon in Jewish Antiquities seems to follow the biblical text without outstanding changes. However, as we have seen, his portrait undergoes a careful Hellenizing process, since Josephus wrote the work having a definite kind of reader in mind: either pagan Greek or Hellenized Jew. Due to this audience and his apologetic interest, he retold biblical history so that king Solomon appeared as the perfect Hellenistic king, transforming the biblical account in the light of Hellenistic monarchical ideology.2' 24 See the characterization of Cyprian the magus in Festugière, La révélation, 1.36-37, and especially 1.375 (Apendix II, \"La confession de Cyprien le mage\"): \"...Je vis en ce lieu des sortes (-τύπος) d'arbres et des herbes en puissance d'agir (ένεργέω), comme si (ώστε) les dieux les regardaient. Et (δέ) je vis encore en ce lieu 4 étoiles dans lesquelles se trouvaient les vents (πνεύμα) changeants, la suc-cession (διαδοχή) des saisons et des fruits (καρπός), (54 ro. 2), les différents jours marqués par les puissances (ένέργεια) du diable (αντικείμενος).\" 25 On Josephus' treatment of Solomon see Chapter 3 above. The figure of Solomon in Josephus has been studied by L. H. Feldman, \"Josephus as an Apolo-gist,\" 69-98, who insists too much on the parallelism between the figure of Solomon and Oedipus and who consciously plays down the magical content of AJ 8:42-49."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"However, there is an aspect of the portrait of Solomon by Josephus that does not fit the general pattern of treatment of biblical figures and situations in the Antiquities; normally, there is a conscious trend in the writing technique of Josephus toward 'de-mythologizing' the biblical material; that is, he plays down any notice, situation or event that could suggest a miraculous interpretation or link with what can be defined as the \"occult\" in the broadest sense of the term.21' Notwithstanding that, in his portrait of Solomon there are several details that break with this tendency toward 'rationalization' of the biblical account. Thus, in AJ 8.42-49 we observe how the biblical story is modified and how several details are added that character-ized Solomon in an unexpected way; this text, which is normally quoted as a proof for the antiquity of the exorcistic traditions at-tributed to Solomon, begins as follows: Now so great was the prudence and wisdom which God granted to Solomon, that he surpassed the ancients, and even the Egyptians, who are said to excel all men in understanding, were not only, when compared with him, a little inferior but proved to fall far short of the king in sagacity. He also surpassed and excelled in wisdom those who in his own time had a reputation for cleverness among the Hebrews, and whose names I shall not omit: they were Athanos and Haimanos and Chalkeos and Dardanos, sons of Hemaon. He also composed a thou-sand five books of odes and songs, and three thousand books of parables and similitudes, for he spoke a parable about every kind of tree from the hyssop to the cedar, and in like manner, about birds and all kinds of terrestrial animals, and those that swim and those that fly. There was no form of nature with which he was not acquainted or which he passed over without examining, but he studied them all philosophi-cally and revealed the most complete knowledge of their several prop-erties [emphasis mine].27 The first part of the text (8:42-44) is a re-working of the Scriptural source (3 Kgdms 5:9-14) as is usual in the Antiquities. However the treatment of the text on this occasion is of a rather unusual nature, 26 On miracles, magic and the occult in Josephus see H. Attridge, Interpreta-tion, 43-60; O.

That temporal trans-ference, which is evident in the relative clause (01 πάντων συνέσει διενεγκεΐν λέγονται) is supported by the use of present infinitives in the rest of the text (ΰπερβάλλειν, λείπεσθαι, έλέγχεσθαι).29 Solo-mon is not viewed against the legendary and obscure past of a leg-endary and mysterious people, as the Jews were for the Greco-Roman world, but against the present of that same Hellenistic and Helle-nizing world. Thus, the competition between the legendary Egyptian sages and Solomon is established in the time of Josephus, suggesting with it the existence of a rivalry that perhaps was known by both the Jewish and Gentile readers of Josephus. Josephus, then, is de-picting not only a legendary Solomon but an actual Solomon, who is described in terms that Josephus' readers understood in a particular way. That characterization progresses along with the text, always taking the biblical source as point of departure but adapting it to the readers and their conceptions. In AJ 8:43-44, the description of a Solomon endowed with ex-traordinary wisdom follows the path determined by the LXX text: Solomon was clever and wiser than Athanos, Haimanos, Chalkeos 28 The Greek text used by Josephus for this part of the Antiquities was proto-Lucian, which could mean that he played with its variants to support his adapta-tion of the figure of Solomon.

At this point, another transformation of the figure is evident, since Josephus has turned into Jews the obscure characters that appeared in the biblical text; fur-thermore he transformed the Darda of the biblical text into Dardanos, who was known among his readers as a powerful magician.31 Again, it seems clear that Josephus has in mind a Solomon who was popu-30 και των κατα τόν αυτόν καιρόν δόξαν έχόντων παρά τοις Έβραίοις. 31 On Dardanos as magical figure see R.

In the same manner we see how in AJ 8:44 Josephus subtly trans-formed his biblical source by combining in a single motif what were two separate items in the LXX; thus, whereas the Greek text of 3 Kgdms 5:12-13 follows its Hebrew source, describing in traditional terms the numbers of compositions made by Solomon and the encyclopaedic character of his wisdom, Josephus changes the set-ting of the text and makes each of the compositions attributed to the king, into scientific discourses. Two facts support this statement: first, the way Josephus transforms 3 Kgdms 5:13 into an explana-tory gloss on 3 Kgdms 5:12 by adding a causal conjunction;5־־' sec-ond, the combined use of παραβολή and είκών (analogies and parables respectively) in AJ 8:44 changes the text further, since for the readers of Josephus both terms had a specific content related to the world of science and philosophy. Thus, again the LXX text is transformed by a slight change in the wording and with this Josephus reinforces the traits that Solomon's figure was progressively acquir-ing. Those traits become even clearer when we take into account the second half of the same text (AJ 8:44), where Josephus continues his transformation of the figure of the king. Thus, he portrays Solomon as one who has spoken about every kind of tree and plant and ev-ery type of animal; in this way he suggests an allegorical interpre-tation of the biblical text of 3 Kgdms 5:13 that can be related to the στοιχεία we have seen in chapter 7 of Wisdom of Solomon. Ac-cordingly, each of the living beings stands for one of the four ele-ments: the terrestrial animals represent earth, the ones that crawl represent fire, the ones that fly, air and, finally, the ones that swim, water.33 Therefore, it is quite probable that Josephus knew of a tradition that connected Solomon with philosophical and Hermetic 32 Καθ' έκάστον γάρ είδος δένδρου παραβολήν ειπεν άπό ύσσώπου έως κέδρου, τόν αυτόν τρόπον καί περί κτηνών... 33 The translation of R. Marcus fails to reflect that possibility since it renders κτήνη by birds (sic) and έπίγεια ζφα by terrestrial creatures. The first translation is incorrect, for κτήνη designates terrestrial animals, not birds; as it is unlikely that we have an hendiadys here, the έπίγεια ζώα should designate a further kind of animal, other than \"terrestrial.\" It is plausible that we have here an alternative term for the ερπετά of the parallel text of 3 Kgdms 5:13; in fact, έπίγειος, when applied to plants, means 'creeping' (See Liddell and Scott, 627)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"conceptions of the four elements, as we have seen the author of Wisdom of Solomon knew before him. Both authors attributed to Solomon knowledge that supposed a very particular view of the king; as their works are dated to the first century CE, the first half and the second half respectively, the tradition was quite widespread at least in some milieux. The transformation of the king continues in the last part of AJ 8:44; here Josephus is free of the biblical source and revises the fig-ure of the king, adapting him to the characteristics of a Hellenistic sage or philosopher. Thus, the chosen wording describes the king as a scientist or philosopher;34 Solomon investigates nature to be-come acquainted with its properties, as is typical of a philosopher, and to be able to use its powers, because Josephus is building up an image of Solomon in which knowledge is equivalent to power. Thus, even when he is depicting Solomon as a philosopher he adds some special traits, which mingle the characteristics of philosophers with the thaumaturgie powers of those considered to be more than phi-losophers. In a way, Josephus predates the efforts of Philostratus in his biography of Apollonius of Tyana; while Philostratus strives (with-out too much success) to minimize the thaumaturgie features of his hero, Josephus combines in Solomon both figures of philosopher and thaumaturge, emphasizing the thaumaturgical / magical aspects, which is rather surprising, given his attitude towards the occult.35 That special characterization is introduced by a note that mentions how God gave Solomon knowledge of exorcism and it is defined in reference to the incantations composed by the king: And God granted him knowledge of the art used against the demons for the benefit and healing of men. He also composed incantations by which illnesses are relieved, and left behind forms of exorcisms with 34 άνεξέταστον, έφιλοσόφησε, έπιστήμην, άκραν, έπεδείσατο. 35 As Gil proved (L. Gil, Therapeia. La medicina popular en el mundo clàsico [Madrid: Gredos, 1969], 470, n. 14) Philostratrus defined Apollonius of Thyana as a θειος άνήρ, a divine man ( Vita VIII: 7). On the definition of divine man see E. R. Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), 74. Josephus does not transform Solomon into a Hellenistic divine man, because his characterization of the king when he speaks about exorcism is more in line with the image of a magician. Surprisingly, C. R. Holladay (Theios Aner in Hellenistic Judaism [SBLDS 40; Missoula: Scholars Press, 1977], 77-79) does not mention those traits and affirms that there is no tendency to deify the king or to elevate him to supra-human status."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"which those possessed by demons drive them out, never to return. And this kind of cure is of very great power among us to this day.3'י We have to consider two facts in this text (AJ 8:45). First, Josephus does not base this text on a scriptural source; here, he draws from Jewish traditions about Solomon, which at least had to be contem-poraneous with him. He is very careful in presenting the informa-tion, for in the eyes of the Roman authorities the claiming of such dubious powers was definitely suspicious; therefore, his choice of words shows how Josephus minimizes the blame which an accusa-tion of γοητεία could suppose for his construction of the character of Solomon: first, God only allows that Solomon could learn such things;׳\" second, Josephus consciously speaks of a technique, play-ing down the negative tones with a rather aseptic term; furthermore, the only purpose of that knowledge was to help humankind, with-out personal interest or desire for domination.38 Here, then, the special attitude of Josephus towards the occult is evident from the careful formulation of the text, since, although for some reason he has to include such traditions in his picture of the king, he tries to reduce any suspicious traits which could provoke accusations of sorcery. The second question is closely related to the way Josephus de-scribes Solomon, referring him not to the past but to the present; we again observe this technique here, since the present predominates in the verbs used by the writer. The verbal forms παρηγορείται, ενόούμενοι, έκδιώκουσι, all refer to the writer's present time, and with it the writer represents a phenomenon that was alive in his own time. The last part of the text leaves no room for doubt: among Jewish people (παρ' ήμίν) up to that time (μέχρι vöv) such healing has power. M' AJ 8:45-46; for the Greek text and the present translation see Marcus, Josephus: Jewish Antiquities, 5.595. ,י An alternative interpretation of the passage could be that Josephus removed any negative trait of such knowledge by making God (ό θεός; this word, formu-lated in this way, had very specific contents for the gentile readers of Josephus) the provider or teacher of Solomon 111 those disciplines. Thus any polemical ac-cusation by adversaries of Judaism could not be based on a supposed link with demonic or malign powers. 38 One of the clearest identifying marks of the figure of the magician is the desire for power and dominion over the world either on his own behalf or on behalf of a client. Therefore, when Josephus clearly states that Solomon learned the technique of exorcism only for the benefit of men, he was safeguarding his gen-eral characterization of the king, making sure Solomon would not be mistaken for a magician."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Yet Josephus felt the need to include an example of the power and efficacy of Solomon's compositions, as AJ 8:46-48 shows: I have seen a certain Eleazar, a countryman of mine, in the presence of Vespasian, his sons, tribunes, and a number of other soldiers, free men possessed by demons, and this was the manner of the cure: he put to the nose of the possessed man a ring which had under its seal one of the roots prescribed by Solomon, and then, as the man smelled it, drew out the demon through his nostrils, and, when the man at once fell down, adjured the demon never to come back into him, speaking Solomon's name and reciting the incantations which he had composed. Then, wishing to convince the bystanders and prove to them that he had this power, Eleazar placed a cup or footbasin full of water a little way off and commanded the demon, as it went out of the man, to overturn it and make known to the spectators that he had left the man. And when this was done, the understanding and wisdom of Solomon were clearly revealed, on account of which we have been induced to speak of these things, in order that all men may know the greatness of his nature and how God favoured him, and that no one under the sun may be ignorant of the king's surpassing virtue of every kind.39 That the above text was included by Josephus within his portrait of Solomon as a token of praise is surprising given, as has been noted already, the special attitude of Josephus towards magic and other dubious disciplines; thus, a careful textual analysis is required to understand why it has been included and its function within the overall structure of the work. Right from the beginning, Josephus is very careful in the way he presents the story: he uses the verb ιστόρησα, not είδον, to introduce the narration. The first meaning of this verb is 'to observe,' 'to see', but it can also mean 'to know' (because one has learned), and it is used among the historians to report or inform about a situation, a country, or suchlike. There-fore, its use at this point of the text suggests that the writer is trying to to convince us of the veracity of the story he is reporting since, as a true historian, he is pledged to the truth. The presence of the emperor Vespasian and his sons as witnesses to the wonder reinforces the veracity of the account and, at the same time, confers the weight of authority upon the whole story and its consequences; that authority supposes that what happened happened in the presence of an em-peror and, therefore, was observed and approved by an emperor. !9 For the Greek text and the present translation see Marcus, Josephus: Jewish Antiquities, 5.595-597."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Thus, the account has to be truthful and cannot imply anything harmful or shameful and the whole figure of Solomon has to be seen in the light of this narrative. It is, without doubt, a clever way to place all the responsibility on the readers. Why did Josephus include this episode in his characterization of Solomon? Only two possibilities can be given in answer: first, the whole episode responds to a real situation which either was observed by Josephus or was narrated to him;40 second, the exorcistic / magical tradition to which the episode responds was so well known even to the gentile readers of Josephus that he could not suppress it and had to explain it in some way; let us analyse in detail each possibility. There are several details that argue against the first possibility. Although we have just seen how Josephus transforms a problematic story by introducing illustrious witnesses, and that fact could con-stitute a proof for the veracity of the account, further study of the overall structure invalidates its impact. First, we have seen how the verb ίστορέω is neutral in its meaning and was chosen by Josephus for that reason; second, the text is divided in two quite distinct parts: the first one mentions, in a rather general way, that Eleazar cured possessed men in the presence of the emperor, whereas the second describes a particular case in such a detailed and structured way that it seems to follow very closely the procedures for exorcism that were current in the period. As we know Josephus' penchant for following Greek literary models on other occasions, it is likely that here we have the same literary practice at work.41 Therefore, the second motive seems a more plausible justification for the inclusion of the exorcism narrative. Is it possible, then, that a tradition that depicted Solomon as 'Her-metic' sage with the powers of an exorcist was known to Josephus' 40 This would depend on which meaning of ίστορέω is adopted. 41 Even in cases in which the historical aspect is more obvious, Josephus shows a clear tendency to model them on Greek literary parallels that were known to his prospective readers. A clear example is his account of the suicide of the de-fenders of Masada where the historical nucleus is cast so much in the form of lit-erature that it is impossible to distinguish between history and literature. In this respect see D. Ladouceur, \"Josephus and Masada,\" in Feldman and Hata (eds.), Josephus, Judaism and Christianity, 95-113; idem, \"Masada: A Consideration of the Literary Evidence,\" Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 21 (1980), 245-260; S.J. D. Cohen, \"Masada Literary Tradition, Archeological Remains, and the Credibility of Josephus,\" JJS 33 (1982), 385-405; R. R. Newell, \"The Forms and Historical Value of Josephus' Suicide Accounts,\" in Feldman and Hata, Josephus, the Bible and History, 278-294."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"gentile readers? Although our second hypothesis gains its strength from what can be defined, in a certain way, as an argumentum ex silentio, it has sufficient weight to be considered in depth. If we analyse the actual form of the exorcism, we observe how several characteristic elements that usually appear in exorcisms have specific roles in our text. Thus, both the mention of the ring (δακτύλιον) as well as the seal (σφραγίς) remind us not only of the importance of such instru-ments in magic and exorcisms in general but also of their specific relationship with king Solomon and traditions linked to him.42 Be-sides, a root plays an important role in the exorcism, and this spe-cific detail reminds us both of AJ 8:44 and of the importance of the powers of roots and plants in Hermeticism and magic.43 In the same way, we find that invoking the name of Solomon as a threat against demons is frequent in many Greek amulets and magical papyri; this last detail is fundamental for the proposed hypothesis of a characterization of Solomon as exorcist known to the readers of Josephus, since it supposes the very name of Solomon to contain apotropaic power, and there are several examples of both amulets and papyri in which the king's name works as the principal deter-rent against the demons. Finally, the overall structure of the exor-cism, with the practical demonstration of its success, has parallels in other exorcisms. This supposes that the figure of Solomon as exorcist enjoyed enough fame among the gentile readers of Josephus to allow the adaptation of pre-existent patterns without much 42 Thus different Greek amulets, Aramaic bowls and some Hebrew incanta-tions show how the power of Solomon over demons was usually linked to his seal. It is interesting to note that, whereas the Jewish traditions in either Aramaic or Hebrew emphasize the connection with the seal those that were more Hellenized combined it with references to the power claimed for different plants and stones, following the theory of cosmic sympathy. A work that combines both traits is the Testament of Solomon, where the role of the seal and the figure of Solomon are completely intermingled. 43 In fact, Josephus's characterization of the Essenes refers to their knowledge of and interest in the properties of roots and stones: \"with the help of these, and with a view to the treatment of diseases, they make investigations into medicinal roots and the properties of the stones\" (BJ 2:136). It seems clear that Josephus adapted whatever the Essenes' interest was into an hellenizing account reminis-cent of Greek interest in the power of roots and stones. Thus, the Essenes are transformed into a kind of Hermetic sages whose special knowledge gives them power. It is evident that the transformation of both images (that of Solomon and that of the Essenes) is made according to a similar pattern, which is reinforced by the fact that Josephus felt the need to state the philanthropic nature of such power, avoiding in this way the accusation of magic."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"trouble.44 Thus, the final formula praising the king could prove that the whole exorcism narrative represented an independent unit that was introduced and adapted by Josephus to confirm for his readers the perhaps dubious fame of Solomon as exorcist. CONCLUSIONS Despite the difficulties in defining the transformations in the char-acter of King Solomon as Hermetic, this characterization fits easily within the figure's development in late Antiquity. Several facts sup-port this Hermetic characterization of the king: a) both the date of so-called 'popular' Hermeticism with its interest in astrology and occult sciences and the date of texts studied are to be located around the first century CE; b) there is a coincidence in the theory of the sympathy of cosmic elements; c) the emphasis on astrology and matters related to the stars and the heavens denote a common ground; d) both texts narrate how Solomon had dominion over spirits or demons; e) the criterion of utility is present in Wisdom of Solomon as well as in the Jewish Antiquities. Thus, both texts as well as their biblical source were understood and interpreted in a Hermetic manner, which supposes that from the very beginning these passages were related to Hermetic doctrines. 44 On these pre-existent patterns see D. C. Duling, \"The Eleazar Miracle and Solomon's Magical Wisdom in Flavius Josephus's Antiquitaks Judaicae 8.42-49,\" HTR 78 (1985), 1-25; this author has made a formal analysis of the exorcism narrative, following the study of G. Theissen, The Miracle Stories of the Early Christian Tradition (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1983) and R. W. Funk, \"The Form of the New Testament Healing Miracle Story,\" Semeia 12 (1978), 57-96. Although his analysis forces the narrative into a formal pattern, it succeeds in showing the general common back-ground for both types of text. The exorcism presented in Vita Apollonii 4.20 is very similar to the one narrated by Josephus; on this and other parallels see Hull, Hel-lenistic Magic, 65-67."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX SOLOMON THE SON OF DAVID INTRODUCTION We have seen that the title \"Son of David\" occurs only in the Old Testament in the post-exilic writings and, except with one excep-tion (2 Sam 13:1), it refers always to Solomon. This title strength-ens the characterization of Solomon as legitimate heir of David and it is also used as a means of pseudepigraphical attribution of writ-ings to King Solomon. However, the title \"Son of David\" has received great attention from scholars due to the importance of the role it plays in the messianic tradition embodied both in the New Testament and in some Jewish pseudepigrapha. That interest has usually been focused on the study of its development in the theology of messianism in the New Testament. Nonetheless, little attention has been dedicated to the application of the formula outside that context. Its presence in texts where Solomon plays an important role, functioning either as a device of pseudepigraphy or as a protagonist, indicates the neces-sity of research into the relationship between the wise king and this title to see whether the title was used as a substitute for the king's name or whether it embodied a particular characterization of the king that could be adapted to other situations. We will examine the terms Solomon / \"son of David\" and see how these designations work together in different settings. SOLOMON, THE SON OF DAVID, IN PSALM 17 OF THE PSALMS OF SOLOMON The Psalms of Solomon are a collection of poetic compositions dating to the first century BCE that appear to have come from circles related to the Pharisees. The pseudepigraphical attribution of the whole work to Solomon is undoubtedly later than the single compositions and its rationale is very unclear. In spite of this, the pseudepigraphical attribution is at least contemporaneous with the Greek translation"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"or the Hebrew Vorlage of the Psalms of Solomon and, therefore, took place in a Jewish setting. This attribution facilitated the later accep-tance of the work into the Greek Christian Bible. We will focus our study on Psalm 17 where the title \"Son of David\" occurs for the first time in the Jewish literature of the Second Temple period.1 We have seen that the role played in the Old Testament by the title \"Son of David\" is rather minimal. However, this trend changes in the pseudepigraphical literature. In Psalm of Solomon 1 7, the title \"Son of David\" appears again, but this time it has a clear messianic content that is absent from the Old Testament. The future \"Son of David\" described in the Psalm is depicted according to the princi-pal positive traits that characterized Solomon in 1 Kings. Besides, it echoes the canonical Psalm 72 (which is also entitled \"Psalm of Solomon\"), which may provide further support for an early ascrip-tion of the Psalms of Solomon to the wise king. After an introduction which depicts the iniquity of the present rul-ers of Israel, describing them as anti-Solomonic figures, the psalm-ist asks for a king who is called the \"son of David\" (17:21), a mes-sianic figure who will deliver the people from present threats. The king, the \"Son of David,\" will be endowed with the virtues that we also find in 1 Kings as attributes of Solomon, such as wisdom and justice (17:22-26, 35, 37). He will proceed to the organization of both the land and the people (17:28-30; cf., mutatis mutandis, 1 Kgs 4:7-19). The \"Son of David\" for whom the author longs has been taught by God, which relates him directly to the Solomon who in Gibeon asked for wisdom in administering justice and ruling the people (1 Kgs 3:10-15, 28).2 The \"Son of David\" will not be a warrior king; the author of the Psalm is depicting a \"Son of David\" who is more like the peaceful Solomon than the rather warlike David. 5 He will abstain from negative actions such as the accumulation of wealth 1 The Greek text that will be used is that of Rahlfs' Septuaginta. The transla-tion of the Greek text is mine, unless otherwise noted. 2 (32) \"And he will be a righteous king over them, taught by God\" (και αύτός βασιλεύς δίκαιος διδακτός υπό θεού έπ' αυτούς). 3 One of the traits on which biblical tradition, Pseudepigrapha, Josephus, etc, agree when speaking about Solomon is the peaceful nature of his kingdom. Even Josephus, when he describes the reign of Solomon, emphasizes that peaceful character which, ultimately, is rather extraordinary, given that in the Hellenistic characterization of a successful ruler progress as a warrior was fundamental. The characterization of other biblical personalities as warriors is consistent through-out the Antiquities."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"and military might which, according to the deuteronomistic redac-tion of the book of Kings, ruined the reign of Solomon (17:33).4 The \"son of David,\" whose image is intellectualized, will rule not by the force of the arms but by power of words and wisdom (17:29, 35, 37), and by these means he will usher in an age of blessing and peace (17:35; cf. mutatis mutandis, 1 Kgs 4:20, 25).5 All the commentators on the Psalms of Solomon agree in empha-sizing their strong messianic color;6 they \"preserve one of the most detailed messianic expectations in the immediate pre-Christian cen-turies.\"7 They also agree in stressing the links between Psalm of Solomon 17 and the canonical Psalm 72. Further, the common opinion is that pseudepigraphic attribution must be rather late and thus quite dif-ficult to justify.8 But at least Psalm of Solomon 17 allows another hypothesis; besides the echoes of different biblical texts,9 there are several points of agreement between the 'Son of David' whom God is asked to send in the apocryphal psalm and the \"Son of David\" to whom wisdom and understanding were graciously given at Gibeon. Thus, the pseudepigraphic attribution to Solomon of the whole of the Psalms of Solomon functioned as a principle that structured the final edition of the text, but it derives from Psalm of Solomon 17, where 4 (21) \"(For) he will not rely on horse, rider and bow nor will he collect gold and silver for war...\" Cf. the description of Solomon as a hoarder of money and horses in 1 Kgs 10:26-29; despite the fact that the author is probably also refer-ring to the Hasmonaean rulers, the parallel with Solomon is most likely. We find the same warnings in the so-called \"Law of the King\" in the Temple Scroll 56:15-19; both texts have the Hasmonaeans in mind when advising against the accu-mulation of economic and military power.

A similar procedure can be seen in the variations on the image of Solomon that Chronicles provides in comparison with the nature of his portrait in Kings.

Probably the attribution to Solomon of the whole of the Psalms of Solomon derived from it, but for our argumentation this fact is not too important. The author of Psalm of Solomon 17 was asking for a \"Son of David\" who would be a Salomo redivivus without the taint of his errors. Solomon, then, as the \"Son of David,\" was taken as the prototype of the messiah at least in some Jewish currents of thought.

It mixes biblical material with legendary and traditional expansions of the same material, such as genealogies, halakhic themes, dramatic speeches and poetic compo-sitions. The present Latin text is a translation from Greek which, in turn, was translated from the original Hebrew. Its date and prov-enance are debated; probably it was composed in the second half of the first century CE in Palestine.12 10 On the mechanism of pseudepigraphic attribution see D. Dimant, \"Pseud-onymity in the Wisdom of Solomon,\" in Fernández Marcos (ed.), La Septuaginta, 243-253, esp. 245. 11 We observe no trait of the thaumaturgie / exorcistic 'Son of David' that we will study in the Synoptic Gospels. Therefore, we can conclude that in the brief span between the late first century BCE and the first century CE a substantial change took place. 12 For a general overview see G. W. E.

Ant. 60, the biblical text of 1 Sam 16:14-23, where it is narrated how David played the lyre to keep at bay the evil spirit that tormented Saul, has been expanded by adding a psalm that has a clearly exorcistic character. Although the 'Son of David' title does not appear anywhere in the Psalm, David warns the evil spirit about a descendant of his who will rule over it. Thus, even though the actual formula (\"Son of David\") does not appear, it is alluded to. In this way the psalm offers, on one hand, further proof for the effective existence of the title 'son of David' applied in a particular way to Solomon and, on the other hand, an indication of Solomon's trans-formation from an earthly king into a more esoteric figure.13 The psalm is considered to be composed of two interwoven themes. The first is an account of the creation of the world, whereas the second constitutes the exorcism.14 However, this view of the text misses its real character; as a matter of fact the composition is not a real exorcism, but is only modelled on an exorcistic pattern.

The dating is one of the most controversial issues; there are two points of view, the one, maintained by Harrington among others, who defends a pre-70 CE date, and the other, maintained by Jacobson, which claims a post-70 CE date, even for a post-135 CE date. Both positions have a rather feeble basis since they apparently read too much into the text. Nevertheless, Harrington's hypothesis seems to conform more with historical reality. 13 For a translation and a commentary on this chapter of the work see M.

If we date the text around the first century CE, we can link it directly with the dates of the traditions at work in the shaping of the Synoptic Gospels. In the New Testament the messianic figure of Jesus has power over demons and it is probable that this power is modelled on an exorcistic concep-tion of Solomon, the esoteric 'Son of David.'19 Thus, our author heralds the birth of a 'Son of David' whose principal attribute is his dominion over the demons. SOLOMON THE \"SON OF DAVID\" IN THE NEW TESTAMENT AND EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITERS In the New Testament, the figure of King Solomon does not seem to play an important role. He is mentioned in Matt 12:42 and 6:29 (cf. Luke 12:27); in these texts, Jesus is speaking to his disciples about the futility of excessive preoccupation with daily life and he men-tions Solomon and his wealth in a rather negative way, since all his glory was insufficient to give him equal status with the lilies. Given the context of warning, it seems clear that the author of the gospel disapproved of the wealth that made Solomon one of the Jewish glories of antiquity and was, thus, presenting a negative character-ization of the king. Besides these passages, there is no direct mention of Solomon in the Gospels. However, in the Synoptic Gospels the expression \"Son of David\" appears in contexts that suggest that the king was indi-י' Bib. Ant. 60:3: \"and now, do not be troublesome\" (Et nunc molesta esse noli). 18 \"But the new womb, from which I was born, will rebuke you, from which in time one will be born from my loins and will rule over you\" (Arguet autem te metra nova unde natus sum, de qua nascetur post tempus de lateribus meis qui vos domabit [Bib. Ant. 60:3]). 19 Josephus' Antiquities 8:45-49 and Wisdom of Solomon 7:20 seem to be contem-porary manifestations of the same tradition. Bib. Ant. 60 has the added value of being the primary Jewish attestation of such a tradition."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"rectly present. Traditionally, this expression has been explained by scholars either in terms of the messianism that the editors wanted to see ascribed to Jesus of Nazareth or as an acknowledgment of his Davidic lineage.20 Perhaps in the actual state of the texts such as-sertions hold true, but the insertion of the expression in these texts and its pre-history suggest that they were first applied to Solomon. First, for the sake of clarity, we shall establish two groups of texts. The first group comprises Mark 10:46-52 and its parallels in Mat-thew (Matt 20:29-34; 9:27-31;) and Luke (Luke 18:35-43); the sec-ond one includes Matt 12:22-30, 42-45; and Matt 15:22. All these texts have a healing context and, with the exception of Matthew (Matt 12:22-30, 42-45), invoke Jesus of Nazareth in the same way: \"have mercy on me (us), [Lord], Son of David\".21 Let us examine each text and its setting. In Mark 10:46-47, the healing of the blind beggar, Bartimaeus, is described; Jesus is addressed as the \"Son of David.\" Apparently, the text belongs to the overall scheme of Mark; Jesus is in continu-ous travel, with each stop used to teach and to perform healings and exorcisms as a sign. At the beginning of Mark 10, it is stated that the teacher is on his way towards Jerusalem, and the healing of Bartimaeus takes place in Jericho when Jesus is passing by. It is quite probable that this episode was taken from some external source, perhaps a Semitic one,22 later to become part of the theological construction of Mark. The ailment healed by Jesus (blindness) and, finally, the use of the expression \"Son of David\" as a title or invo-cation characterize the story. In Matt 20:29-34 and its doublet (Matt 9:27-31) the setting of heal-ing is less dramatic and detailed. It seems quite certain that Mat-thew created the story of the healing taking as a source the Bartimaeus story of Mark, in order to complete the miracle cycle of 2(1 About the origin and means of transmission of Jewish royal and messianic ideology, see D.C. Duling, \"The Promises to David and their Entrance into Christianity: Nailing Down a Likely Hypothesis,\" JVTS 20 (1973), 55-77. 21 υιέ Δαυίδ Ίησοΰ, έλέησόν με. 22 See James Η.

Priest (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996), 125-151, esp. 133-134: \"Since the evangelist Mark must translate Bartimaeus—a Semitic name that means 'son of Timaeus'—as the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, there can be virtually no doubt that some of the tradition here goes back to an Aramaic tra-dition, and perhaps source.\""},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"chapters 7-8.23 What is interesting for us is the fact that Matthew retains the title \"Son of David\" in the healing context, rather than using only \"lord\" or a similar word. In Luke 18:35-43, we see the same healing settting; it has been further simplified, since the background is less clear and defined. In the Lucan parallel the healing context is, as in the other texts, linked directly to faith, and the \"Son of David\" expression still has a for-mulaic value. All the texts, then, have in common the formulaic use of the expression \"Son of David,\" but the link with Solomon, the \"Son of David\" par excellence, is not clearly present in them. In the second group of texts, we have to proceed more slowly and cautiously. Matthew 12 has two sections that are particularly impor-tant for us: first, verses 22-24 and 26-27, and second, verses 42-45. In Matt 12:22-24 the title \"Son of David\" is a response by the crowds to the healing of the dumb and blind man; it seems that the origi-nal sense of the question asked in this passage was whether Jesus was healing in the name of Solomon or whether he was a Solomon redivivus.24 The Pharisees, according to Matthew, have the answer: Jesus drives out the evils spirits in the name of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons. The rhetorical question with which Jesus addresses his adversaries (Matt 12:26-27) seems to indicate that the evangelist was aware of the polemic about the authority and power of Jesus as an exorcist; the mention of the queen of the South who came to hear the \"wisdom of Solomon\" and the affirmation that \"what is here is greater than Solomon,\" combined with the repeated exorcistic set-ting which encloses all the chapters, point to the recognition at an early date of common powers to expel demons shared by Solomon and Jesus.25 Thus, the polemical competition between Solomon and 23 See D. C. Duling, \"The Therapeutic Son of David: An Element in Matthew's Christological Apologetic,\" NTS 24 (1978), 392-420. 24 Many Church Fathers saw Jesus as a kind of perfect Solomon; see Athanasius, Expositionen in Psalmos in ], P. Migne Patrologiae cursus completus omnium patrum, doctorum, scriptorumque ecclesiasticorum sive latinorum sive graecorum (Turnhout: Brepols, 1857-1866) vol. 27, p. 324, 1. 12; Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, 8.1.53. 25 E. R. Goodenough, in Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period, (13 vols; Bollingen Series 37; New York, 1953-1968; 2.226) affirms: \"Incomplete as I con-sider the pericope about the unclean spirit in both Matthew and Luke to be, Matthew's presentation of the three together seems to me probably original. In this case we have a direct association of Jonah with Solomon and the unclean spirits, that is, with the world with which magic usually dealt. I see no reason to suppose that this association originated in Christianity. It seems more likely that the power of Christ was being presented as greater than Jonah's or Solomon's in terms commonly intelligible among Jews as describing superhuman power.\""},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Jesus found in later Christian writings reflects in an indirect and partial way the same tradition that would be preserved in Jewish claims of the superiority of Solomon,s power over the demons. In the fifth to sixth centuries the controversy continued and the Jews still mantained that the name of Solomon was a powerful deterrent againt demonic power, as Leontios of Byzance (485-542) said: \"to whom did the legion of demons say: if you throw us out, send us into that herd of pigs? To Solomon who built Jerusalem, or to the Lord Christ who carries all in his hand? But at once the Jews, lovers of demons, will say: so what! Is it not true that Solomon subdued the demons? Is it not true that he shut them up all one by one? do they not fear him even now? But, Ο Jews who conjure demons, you say these things in vain: for only the Lord Christ powerfully bound the violent one and tore in pieces his instruments. Because Solomon only did not rule over the demons as king, but also he was subdued by them, being com-pletely destroyed at the end. [...] How, then, is the demons' slave the lord of demons?\"26 It is likely that Leontios was interested in avoiding the use of the power of Solomon by his fellow Christians; this would be further proof of the specific weight of this tradition in everyday life and, in-directly, offer considerable support to the proposed interpretation of the passages under study: a Christian authority mentions Solomon and Jesus in a context of rivalry concerning power over demons; al-though he acknowledges the relationship between Solomon and the demons, he denies that it was established on an equal footing with that of Jesus. Besides, the polemical tone of the text indicates that the legend of the power of Solomon was still alive among both Jews and Christians.27 26 Tivi εϊπεν ό λεγέων τών δαιμόνων ει έκβάλης ημάς, έπιτρέψον ήμίν είς τήν άγέλην τών χοιρών είσελθεΐν; Σολομώντι, τψ τά Ίεροσολύμα κτίσαντι, ή τώ Δέοποτη Χριστώ, τφ τά σύμπαντα έν τή χειρί βαστάζοντι; 'Αλλ' έρούσιν ευθέως οί φιλοδαίμονες ,Ιουδαίοι־ τί οΰν; ό Σολομών ούκ έδεσπότευσε τών δαιμόνων; ουχί πάντας ύφ' έν ως ένα συνεκλείσεν; ούχί μέχρι τής σήμερον τούτον δεδοίκοσιν; Αλλ', ώ Ιουδαίοι μαγγανοδαίμονες, μάτην ταύτα προβάλ-λεσθε־ μόνος γάρ ό Δέσποτης Χριστός κράταιως τόν ισχυρον έδησε, καί τά σκευή αύτού διήρπασε.

The miracle per-formed is not a healing but an exorcism, to attain which the hea-then woman invokes Jesus as \"son of David.\" The fact that the passage is derived from the episode of the Syrophoenician woman of Mark 7:24-30 is not relevant for our purposes, but the direct link between the title \"Son of David\" and an exorcism is consistent with the idea that we have developed above. It has been said that most of the Old Testament references to that title are late and applied to Solomon, so the use of the formula in New Testament passages appears to be something more than a penchant for a good-sound-ing title. Finally a word must be said about Luke 11:14-32, which is a par-allel to Matt 12:22-32 and Mark 3:20-30.28 In this passage the wording of the source \"Q\" is quite well preserved; thus, in Luke 11:14-24, which narrates how a dumb demon is expelled and the controversy about which kind of authority Jesus uses to expel the demon, there is not even an indirect reference to Solomon as the prototype of an exorcist: in this passage neither the title \"Son of David\" nor the rhetorical question \"is he the Son of David?\" ap-των δέ τών πονερών δαιμόνων έκράτησε, καί δέσμιους αυτούς ήσφαλίσατο.

Certainly he secured them in jars at the right time, and, having sealed them, he buried them in obscurity. But it seems to me most likely that after he was subdued by the mental demons, and was defeated, he risked his own salvation, as Scripture attests.\" This text is remarkable for two reasons: on the one hand, S. Gregentios acknowledges to some extent Solomon's power over the demons as fact; on the other, the text seems to attest to a Jewish source for the legend about the shutting of the demons in jars, which appears also in the Testament of Solomon. 28 On the passage in question seej. A. Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke. Introduction, Translation, and Notes (AB 28; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983), 916-937. Notwithstanding his excellent analysis, neither he nor the standard textual commentary on the NT (B. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testa-ment [Stuttgart: German Bible Society, 1975]) notes that at the beginning of the passage there seems to be a conflation of two texts, for the passage begins by speaking of a dumb demon and afterwards describes how the dumb man speaks when the demon is chased away. Perhaps the composite nature of the text is more complicated than it seems."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"pears. However, Luke 11:20 (\"the finger of God\") seems to be an echo of Ex 8:15 where the finger of God is mentioned, a passage that was in the Q source;29 it has to be understood as a proof of the superior power of Solomon who does not need rings, charms or adjurations.30 Thus, it seems that Luke's intention was to play down the magical content of the passage; for that, he removed the rhe-torical question \"is he the Son of David?\" and transformed the allu-sion to the wisdom of Solomon into a comparison between a wise man, Solomon, and a man who has the power to use the \"finger of God\" (Jesus). Notwithstanding this interpretation, the passage is more evidently \"magical\" on account of this expression, the presence of which in the Q, source points to the sources used by the other evan-gelists and, then, to the sources that were aware of the tradition about Solomon, the powerful exorcist. Besides that, the anthropomorphism of the expression, despite its likely Septuagintal origin, resembles the expression δακτυλίον θεοΰ, \"signet of God,\" and we have found a similar formula (σφραγίς θεού) in some old Greek amulets, the source of which seems to be Jewish.31 Of course, we are not suggesting that the passage should be interpreted in this way, but it is likely that the amulets referring to the seal of God had their origin in a special way of reading the LXX passage (by Jews) and then the Q source (=actual text of Luke) by the first Christians (=Jews). All these facts together provide fur-ther support for the existence of the magical-exorcistic tradition about Solomon and for its use in NT. Several authors have studied the problems of these passages.32 Al-though employing different perspectives, they agree that the title \"Son of David\" here does not necessarily indicate an expression or ac-29 LXX Ex 8:15 : είπαν ουν οί έπαοιδοί τω Φαραώ Δάκτυλος θεοΰ έστιν τοϋτο. 30 So Fitzmyer, Gospel, 922, who notes that the same expression, \"Finger of God,\" has also been found in a Greek adjuration on an ostracon from Ashmunen in Egypt (AE 306), which dates from the late empire period and mentions a woman called Maria. 31 On these Greek amulets see Ch. 7, \"Solomon the horseman.\" 32 In addition to the works already cited see D.

If the tide \"Son of David,\" with specific exorcistic characteristics, was transferred from Solomon to Jesus, then we could think that the portrayal of Solomon as a healer/exorcist occurred at least as early as the first century C.E.33 This would suppose the existence of a Jewish tradition in a Semitic garb and setting that portrayed Solomon as more than a healer, at least when characterized as the \"Son of David.\" Such a tradition would not differentiate between the healing and exorcistic aspects of the character, because they had been completely merged.34 Al-though we can ask ourselves if the healing aspect in the NT is due to an overlap with an Hellenistic royal ideology that sometimes characterized the king as healer,35 the existence of a Second Temple Jewish tradition, which linked special powers to the royal ideology and figure of the king, is quite likely. Solomon would constitute the expression of that ideology, which, after being modified, was passed on to the Christian messianic conception of Jesus;36 Clement of 33 See M. Smith, Jesus the Magician (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1975), 80: \"...it is clear that by Jesus' time the Solomon legend had been shaped by popular stories about magicians' powers and to some extent by knowledge of actual ma-gicians, their practices and their perils. This illustrates the importance of magic in Jesus' environment and helps to explain why Jesus' powers were similarly in-terpreted. Moreover, that Solomon was not only a magician, but also King of Israel and son of David, may have helped some of those who thought Jesus a magician to believe that he might also be the Messiah, the promised son of David and King of Israel. Those of his followers who did think him the Messiah could easily draw on the Solomon legend to justify his dealings with demons, and to extend the story of his powers. Conversely, as time went on, the notion of Solomon as ancestor and antecedent of Jesus led Christians to attribute to him miracles taken from Jesus' repertory.\" 34 Some of the scholars quoted, due to their theological interests, make a clear-cut distinction between the healing aspect and the exorcistic one. ij On the monarchical ideology in the antiquity, see E. R. Goodenough, \"The Political Philosophy of Hellenistic Kingship,\" Tale Classical Studies 1 (1928), 55-102; about the relation among the healing \"Son of David,\" the royal \"Son of David\" and the Hellenistic \"divine man\" in early Christianity see C. Burger, Jesus als Davidssohn. Eine traditionsgeschichtliche Untersuchung (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1970), 44, 169. 36 Thus, in chapter 66 (\"Concerning the Prophecy of Christ\") of the Ethiopie book Kebra Nagast it is said that Solomon was a model for Jesus: \"Now, according to the interpretation of prophecy, the name Solomon signifieth in the secret speech 'Christ.'\" That notice about the true interpretation of the name of Solomon is followed by exegetical proofs from Song of Songs (see E. A. Wallis Budge (tr.), The Queen of Sheba & her only Son Menyelek [London / Liverpool / Boston: Medici Society, 1922], 105). Similarly, the Mandaean book Ginza makes Jesus the imme-diate successor of Solomon, the Son of David, ruler of demons: \"(190) Then, King Solomon, the Son of David, is born and appears, and he is king overjudah and"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Alexandria clearly links both figures by making the demons the touchstone in the legitimation of the messiah.37 In addition to that, different Christian writers continued to link both figures by seeing Solomon as an precursor of Jesus. In this way the suspicious tone of their rivalry of powers was eliminated and tailored to suit Christian orthodoxy.3\" However, such a conception was also known to Chris-tian Gnostic movements, which reflects its importance within the different currents of Christianity. Thus, the Gnostic Christian work The Second Treatise of the Great Seth (VII, 2: 63.4-17) seems to reflect a related tradition: David was a laughingstock in that his son was named the Son of Man, having been influenced by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stron-ger than I and the fellow members of my race. But we are innocent with respect to him; we have not sinned. Solomon was a laughing-stock, since he thought that he was Christ, having become vain through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him. In this text Solomon is described as a false Christ, a false messiah; it indicates that there was a tradition that linked the figure of Solomon a powerful ruler over Jerusalem. The demons and the devils (dews) submit to him and walk according to his will, until he glorifies himself and is ungrateful to his Lord for the good things.

Here, King Solomon is given the title \"the son of David' and in some sense is made a model for and predecessor of Christ. 37 Clement of Alexandria, Eclogae Propheticae chapter 53, section 2: και νύξ νυκτί αναγγέλλει γνώσιν, ό διάβολος £δει έλευσόμενον τόν κύριον, ει δέ ό Ίησοϋς αυτός ε'ίη, οΰκ ηπίστατο״ διό και έπείραζεν αυτόν, ινα γνω t εί δυνατός έστιν, έαν φησι׳ \"και άπέστη άπ' αυτού εις καιρόν,\" τουτέστιν άνεβάλλετο τήν εΰρησιν εις τήν άνάστησιν. εδει γάρ τοΰτον είναι τόν κύριον τόν άναστησόμενον. ομοίως και οί δαίμονες, έπεί και Σολομώνα ύπώπτευσαν είναι τόν κύριον, έγνωσαν δέ μή είναι, άμαρτόντος αυτού [and now at night he proclaims the knowledge.

In the same way, the demons, when they suspected that Solomon was the lord, knew he was not, for he sinned], !H See e.g. Origen, Commentam in Evangelium Joannis Book 10, Chapter 39, sec-tion 276; Theodoretus, Interpretatio in Psalmos, PGM 80, 1429."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"with the messiah by transforming the king into a model for the messiah, a model that was rejected.59 SOLOMON, THE \"SON OF DAVID\" IN JEWISH AMULETS AND MAGICAL BOWLS Jewish amulets and magical bowls comprise a corpus of texts that shows actual magical and exorcistic practice in Late Antiquity. That practical character makes them important for the understanding of the title \"Son of David\" as it relates to Solomon in an exorcistic context. Furthermore, despite their relatively late date, they preserve traditions that are quite older and that were alive in a Jewish soci-ety and in Semitic garb.40 In the Babylonian bowls Solomon appears together with the title 39 Translation of R. A. Bullard and J. A. Gibbons in Robinson (ed.), Nag Hammadi Library, 368. In the Gnostic tractate The Apocalypse of Adam (V, 5; 78.27-79.19) we can observe a similar tradition to the one under study: \"The fourth kingdom says [of him that] he came [from a virgin. ... Solomon sought her, he and Phersalo and Sauel and his armies, which had been sent out. Solomon him-self sent his army of demons to seek out the virgin. And they did not find the one whom they sought, but the virgin who was given to them. I was she whom they fetched. Solomon look her. The virgin became pregnant and gave birth to the child there. She nourished him within a boundary of the desert. When he had been nourished, he received glory and power from the seed form which he had been begotten. And thus he came to the water\" (trans. G. W. MacRae, Nag Hammadi Library, 282-283). This Gnostic text is difficult insofar as it appears to display no distinctively Christian trait; in this passage, therefore, we either in fact have such a trait, or we have a link with some kind of Jewish apocalyptic tradition that linked Solomon with a messiah, who was tranformed into a gnostic redemeer by the author or redactor of the Apocalypse of Adam. The reference to the \"army of demons\" of Solomon seems to point to the general background of the tradition that linked Solomon with demonic power; such a tradition would be easily introduced within the Gnostic world of spiritual beings (aeons, angels, powers) or linked to astrol-ogy (see Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer\"). 40 As we shall see, the Babylonian magical bowls can be dated between 300-600 CE based on stratification. The Aramaic amulets found in Palestine can be dated around 300-700, although we cannot be certain because the provenance of many of them is unknown (seej. A. Montgomery, \"Some Early Amulets from Palestine,\" JAOS 31 [1911], 272-281, who dates some of the amulets ca. 200-400 CE). Finally the amulets and recipes from the Cairo Genizah are to be dated still later, from the tenth century on. In any case that dating does not neccesarily presuppose that the traditions contained in the texts are from the same period, if we take into account the conservative and traditional character of magical prac-tice, which tends towards the preservation of magical formulae almost without change."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"\"Son of David\" several times, always within an exorcism.41 Thus we read: (15) ...I will bind you with the bond with which the seven stars/plan-ets [and the twelve signs of the zodiac have been bound unto the great day of judgment and unto the great ho]ur of redemption. (17) ...the devils are bound [y]ou will do, with the bond of El Shadday and with the sealing of King Solomon the son of [David....] .... Amen.42 In the same way, other bowls refer to Solomon as the 'King', the 'son of David', which supposes more than genealogical note; his name together with both titles plays an important role in the spell. Each of the examples mentions either the action of sealing by Solomon or the signet-ring of the king.4 5 Solomon is the \"Son of David\" and as such is represented as exorcist. To this principal trait another should be added: in the example quoted we see that the context shows an astrological interest which is reminiscent of Solomon the astrologer who is quite common in texts like the Hygromanteia of Solomon in which the zodiacal signs and the seven planets play a fundamental role.44 Both traits, the astrological and the magical, have merged in this bowl and indicate the chronological endurance and geographical extent of the tradition. Another bowl seems to address the same combination of exorcistic and astrological material in the rather obscure expression \"...the luck of which no one has mastered\"; perhaps the Aramaic מזולא refers here to a planet or zodiacal con-stellation considered as the king's fortune.4 ' In a third text, Solomon 41 For the text and translation see C.

If the read-ing is correct, we would have a parallel to the New Testament oc-currences of the title, a closer parallel geographically speaking. The text would refer to the signet-ring of the king, the \"Son of David,\" which would prove the spread of the tradition in both the Palestin-ian and the Babylonian Jewish communities.

Thus, our first amulet, a magical nail, shows an owl, which usually symbolized evil; around the owl, we read, \"The lion from the tribe ofjudah, the root of David, Solomon, David, son of Jesse conquers.\"56 Although this amulet, made of copper and found in Carthage, shows a slightly different formula for the title, it proves that this title continued to be applied to Solomon within a Christian context.57 Besides the variation of the title and the appearance of Solomon in an exorcistic milieu, the phrase \"the lion ofjudah\" reminds us of other amulets, in which alongside the figure of the king riding a horse and killing a female demon a lion appears.58 In those cases, the allusion to the lion of Judah, Solomon the king, Son of David, helps to reinforce the apotropaic strength of the amulet. The same titles applied to Jesus appear in another amulet, which is intended to fight the owl and the evil or demon symbolized by it: The Lion from the tribe ofjudah conquers you, the root of David, the Lord Jesus Christ will bind you, God's arm and the seal of King Solomon, so that you, nocturnal bird, may not be able to enter into a pure soul and to have power over her whoever you are.09 55 So Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, 1.68; 2.226.238; 7.198-200; 9.1044-67. 56 J.

This phenomenon is equivalent to the one observed in the passages of the NT discussed above, but in the present case the polemic between the two exorcistic figures is omitted; we have here a syncretistic reinterpretation of the Jewish tradition of the magical \"Son of David.\" SOLOMON THE \"SON OF DAVID\" IN THE TESTAMENT OF SOLOMON As we have seen the Testament of Solomon constitutes one of the pseudepigrapha attributed to the king; it consists principally of demonological lore linked to the figure of the king.61 Given its dat-ing (third or fourth century CE) and contents (exorcism and magic), it is not surprising that the title \"Son of David\" occurs several times in the Testament. The distribution of these references is problematic since some are found either in the titles of the different recensions or within the body of the text as textual variants of different values; only a number of manuscripts agree in naming Solomon as \"Son of David\", whereas even these references are not present in represen-tatives of each of the three major recensions of the Testament, which lessen their value for our study of the title \"Son of David.\" Thus, for the sake of consistency, all examples of the title \"Son of David\" found in titles or as textual variants within the manuscript tradition of the Testament that are not considered as having sufficient value, will not be studied.

ME 1:1, 2:1, 11:1 have little interest since they are Christianized, as the transformation of David into a prophet seems to attest (cf. Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, 2.233); Μ Ε 11:1 relates the reigns of Solomon and Zedekiah and the tradition about the liberation of the demons imprisoned in jars of bronze at the hands of the Babylonians. On the other hand, the titles of mss P, Q, and I appear in a setting where there is an evident relation between Solomon the \"son of David\", the demons and the building of the temple. In Recension C XII: 1, the titular character might be attested since the demon Paltiel Tzamal addreses the king with it after being summoned into his presence; Recension C XIII: 10-11 shares the same character to a lesser de-gree because the king is the one who speaks; this recension lacks, therefore, the setting of dominion and respect that the recognition by the demon suggests. It should be noted that this text constitutes also a further witness to the tradition that narrates the destruction of some Salomonic writings at the hands of King Hezekiah; here the responsibility for that destruction laid on Solomon. Numer-ous sources from early Byzantine times and some rabbinic texts mention this tra-dition but without making the king responsible. Concerning some of these rabbinic traditions see D. J. Halperin, \"The Book of Remedies, the Canonization of the Solomonic Writings and the Riddle of Pseudo-Eusebius,\" JQR 72 (1982), 269-292. 63 A fourth appearance could be noted at the beginning of the Testament, in which the archangel Michael addresses Solomon with the title \"Son of David\" when he tells to the king that his prayers have been heard (Test. Sol 1:7). The fact that this passage seems to be part of the structural framework of the exorcistic mate-rial of the Testament, makes it advisable not to include it as textual evidence for our hypothesis. 64 έπηρώτησα πάλιν αυτόν λέγων \"μή κρύψης άπ' έμοΰ ρήμα, οτι έγώ είμι Σολομών υιός Δαυείδ και εϊπε μοι τό όνομα τοϋ ιχθύος ου σύ σέβη.\""},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"mercy on me, an old man.\" and I said to him: \"say, old man, what you want.

On this occasion the coercion of the demon comes about as a result of the name of the king and his identifica-tion as the \"Son of David'5 (\"because I am Solomon, Son of David\"). The tradition about Solomon, \"Son of David,\" master of demons is at work here; in these lines there is no mention of either the seal or the divine name and, therefore, the formula works as an authorita-tive and powerful title by itself. Even more interesting is Test. Sol. 20:1; in this text we have a small historiola, which precedes a lengthy discourse by the demon Ornias on human fate; it would constitute a perfect expression of the titular character of the \"Son of David\" formula. However, the text poses two difficulties that reduce its importance to some extent; on the one hand, the actual wording could be an echo of Mark 10:47; on the other, the elderly man's petition has more to do with a plea for justice than with a cry for magical or exorcistic help. Some authors tackle the first difficulty by seeing in this text a statement independent of the NT;67 others think of some kind of dependence on the NT that could only be oral.68 Probably it would be more realistic to affirm that even if the text is considered to be an echo of the NT, it has been reinterpreted, changing the protagonist to Solomon, who is called \"Son of David.\" Besides, we should ask ourselves how we can explain an NT echo or oral dependence in a passage where Christian features are ab-sent, since we cannot even adduce a polemic or apologetic inten-tion on the part of the redactor. Therefore, Berger's opinion seems 65 καί ιδού εις τών τεχνιτών γηραιός έρριψεν αυτόν ενώπιον μου λέγων \"βαοιλεΰ Σολομών υιός Δαυείδ, έλέησόν με τό γέρας.\" καί ειπον αύτψ· \"λέγε, γέρον, δ θέλεις.\" 66 έγώ οΰν Σολομών υιός Δα(υεί)δ υιοΰ ίεσσαί έγραψα τήν διαθήκην μου καί έσφραγίσα αυτήν τω δακτυλίδιω τοΰ θεοΰ. 67 See Berger, \"Die königlichen Messiastraditionen des NT,\" 7: \"Vieles spricht dafür, daß es sich hier nicht um eine Nachahmung, sondern um eine Parallele zu dem ntl. έλεήσον υιέ Δαυίδ handelt.—Zahlreich sind ferner die Belege aus Pa-pyri und Inschriften, in denen Salomo als Sohn Davids, Prophet und Magier bezeichnet wird- jeweis in Kontext von Herrschaft über Dämonen.\" 68 See Duling, \"Solomon, Exorcism,\" 243."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"correct: the text constitutes a further example of the title \"Son of David\" applied to Solomon within a historiola. CONCLUSIONS The title \"Son of David\" appears in late biblical books, almost al-ways applied to Solomon in a limited manner, being used princi-pally as a device of pseudepigraphical authorship. In the first cen-tury BCE, the title acquired a messianic content in Psalm of Solomon 17, where the hoped for messianic ruler was modelled on King Solomon, stressing his sapiential attributes, but without mentioning any esoteric knowledge. In the first century CE the \"Son of David\" denotes either a messianic figure with strong thaumaturgie power or a thamaturge/exorcist as in LAB 60. Later on, the pre-Markan source preserved in Mark and parallels seems to indicate how Jesus, depicted either as a healer or an exorcist, is called \"Son of David,\" and it is more than likely that Solomon, the \"Son of David,\" was taken as the effective model for that tradition. From the third cen-tury on, Solomon, with the title \"Son of David,\" appears frequently in Greek, Latin and Hebrew amulets and in Aramaic bowls. Finally around the third or fourth century as well, the title \"Son of David\" applied to Solomon appears again in the Testament of Solomon as a title of magical power, lacking any messianic content. In consequence, in magical and exorcistic settings, the title \"Son of David\" used by the Jews was applied to Solomon as a motif expressing special power, while the Christians applied it to Jesus, transferring the title from the Jewish tradition, which depicted Solomon as an exorcist, to their messiah.69 However, some Christian currents, such as those repre-69 A papyrus from the fourth or fifth century provides further proof for the titular use of the expression \"Son of David\" applied to Jesus in exorcistic con-texts, see P. 3 (K. Preisendanz PGM, 2.219) where it is very likely that the magi-cal name Σαλαμαν stands for Solomon, although the writer of the exorcism was not aware of it; on this see Cabrol, Dictionnarie, 5.596-597, where Σαλαμα or Solomon is mentioned in connection with Artemis. The exorcism seems to be a Christianized version of a Jewish or syncretistic model; we have a close parallel to this papyrus in the following Latin inscription on a bronze nail: ...ter dico, ter incanto, in signu dei et signu Solomonis et signu domna Artemis (R. Heim, Incantamenta magica, graeca, latina [Leipzig: Teubner, 1892] # 230, p. 541). See also Ρ XXVIII a-c dated to the f1fth5-6th century CE from Oxyrhinchus (Preisendanz, PGM, 2.154-155,); this papyrus shares the same tradition that links Solomon, Artemis and the de-mons; again we have magical names of Jewish origin."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"sented by the Gnostics and their historical succesors the Mandaeans, continued to link in some way both figures who were considered important in some way for their cosmology and eschatology.

The archae-ological sphere indicates the importance of the figure of Solomon in certain contexts. In this chapter we will, therefore, examine some amulets on which a peculiar characterization of Solomon as horse-man appears and which were particularly popular in Late antiqui-ty. Apparently they were developed by a Hellenized Jewish popu-lation among which the use of magic, in a form that is heavily indebted to pagan sources, was widespread.1 These amulets usually show a horseman galloping to the right and about to pierce the heart of a female figure with a spear. The hair of the rider is confined by a band.־ The oldest amulets of this type were made of haematite and had the inscription Σολομών around the horseman, and σφραγίς θεοΰ, \"seal of God/' on the reverse.3 They show no evident trait of Christianization and so it is likely they had a Jewish origin.4 The first question that arises from these amulets is why the king was identified with a horseman killing an foe. Bonner explains it as the result of a process of mimicry of royal representations of 1 See C. Bonner, Studies in Magical Amulets Chiefly Graeco-Egyptian (Ann Arbor & London: University of Michigan Press, 1950), 208. 2 For a more detailed description see Bonner, Studies, 207-209. 1 For examples of this type of amulet see A. Delatte and P. Derchain, Les intailles magiques graeco-égyptiennes (Paris: Bibliothèque Nationale, 1964), 261-264, amulets 369-377; G. Schlumberger, \"Amulettes byzantines anciens,\" REG 5 (1892) 73-93, esp. 84, 92; Bonner, Studies, plates XIV-XVI. 4 See Bonner, Studies, 108; Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, 2.226-227. Notwith-standing all this, such characterization is later than the Macedonian conquest of the East, as Bickerman suggested: \"Biblical angels do not ride horses, but the Macedonian kings and nobles were masters of equitation, and the orientals be-gan to represent their own celestial beings as Macedonian horsemen\" (E.

However, other authors seek to locate the model of the amulets in ancient represen-tations of an Anatolian god, called Ηρών.3 Nevertheless, while the original source of the figure may be older, Bonner is right in seeing a closer model in the representation of the last three emperors of the Antonines. Amulets in haematite seem to be the oldest type of these Solomonic amulets but even they cannot be dated earlier than the third century. Since it takes some time for an official represen-tation to become successful and to be adopted and readapted for another function, we can conclude that the transformation of that official model took place around the mid-third century CE in Syria-Palestine and Egypt.6 An official motif of victory was reinterpreted and transformed into an apotropaic device in which King Solomon fights against a female demon. This transformation took place among Hellenized Jews and in a Hellenistic context because only in such a context would the representation of King Solomon as a mighty warrior have been plausible, despite the weight of the biblical tra-dition which, depicted Solomon and his kingdom in a peaceful way.7 THE AMULETS: ICONOGRAPHY AND INSCRIPTIONS After these preliminary remarks, we shall take a closer look at the different types of amulets and the inscriptions on them. As has been said, on the earliest type of amulet, besides the drawing of the horse-man, there is a short inscription which includes the name of the king and a mention of the seal of God, that is, the seal on which is en-' Bonner, Studies, 210. For another hypothesis about the origin of the amulets see B. Bagatti, \"Altre medaglie di Salomone cavaliere e loro origine,\" R/IC 47 (1971), 331-342, especially 337-342; however, Bagatti tends to interpret the amu-lets too freely in order to relate them to the different demons and practices re-corded in the Testament of Solomon. For the Anatolian hypothesis see P. Perdrizet \"σφραγις Σολομώνος,\" REG 16 (1903), 42-61, especially 50-53. From the same author, see also, Negotium perambulans, 9-11. 6 See Bonner, Studies, 221. Thus, the date for the effective presence and de-velopment of the figure of Solomon as magician and exorcist points to the third century CE and to a hellenized environment, when magic had established itself among the more cultured classes as well, as literary works, such as the Vita Apolonii of Philostratus (third century CE), attest. י Even Josephus did not add martial prowess to his portrayal of Solomon (except for the section in Jewish Antiquities 8.160)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"graved the name of God. The knowledge of the divine name is a tradition that later on was to attain considerable importance in Jewish mystical circles and play a specific role in magical practices; in the amulets that knowledge is related to the power it confers over the demons, a tradition that we can find in other texts supposedly authored by Solomon, such as the Testament or the Hygromanteia.8 Over time, the iconography and design of the amulets changed and evolved.9 Thus, later examples of amulets show clear Christian reworking: the band has become a halo,10 the upper part of the spear ends in a cross, and the iconic representation is enriched with sev-eral animals, such as a scorpion, snakes, a bird and sometimes a roaring lion walking to the right. Another type of amulet has on the reverse the evil eye either being attacked by a lion, snakes, and/or a scorpion, or being pierced by sharp instruments.\" Despite the importance of the iconography, the inscriptions which appear on the amulets comprise the principal link with traditions relating to Solomon. Although not every amulet has an inscription or charm, those which do seem to go back to a Jewish setting and, accordingly, it is necessary to look at the inscriptions to understand the inner workings of such traditions. The charms are simple and usually written in a rather defective Greek; angelic and magical names are present in various degrees. They are to be understood within an exorcistic or magical context. Thus we can read on one amulet: \"Seal of Solomon, keep away any evil from the one who wears you.\"1־־' This inscription is written 8 The theurgic use of divine names was common in magical practices as the Greek magical papyri show (e.g., Preisendanz, PGM, 1.64-184, 2.125-130). 9 In fact the amulets' iconography re-adapted earlier themes and designs; for some partial iconographie parallels see O. Keel and C. Uehlinger, Göttinnen, Götter und Gottessymbole. Neue Erkenntnisse zur Religionsgeschichte Kanaans und Israels aufgrund bislang unerschlossener ikonographischer Quellen (Freiburg / Basel / Wien: Herder, 1993), passim. 10 This halo should not cause surprise; throughtout the entire Christian Ori-ent, Solomon and, indeed, all the righteous kings ofjudah were considered to be saints. 11 For examples of each of the types see C. Bonner, Studies, 209-221, amulets 294-309, plates XXIV-XXV; G.

On the reverse, around the figure of the horseman who is spearing a female demon, we can read: \"Flee, Oh hated one. Solomon pursues you, Sisinnios, Sisinnarios.\"15 In this amulet we observe the combination of the iconographie motifs described above along with the use of the name of Solomon within a small historiola; the ensemble works as an apotropaic device to keep away a female demon. This amulet, then, supposes a development of the haematite type, reflected both in the iconography and in the charm that ex-plains the engraving and strengthens its power. The amulet is called an amulet of Solomon, not an amulet of God, as in the oldest type, in which only the image of the horseman piercing the demon, the inscription \"seal of Solomon,\" and a reference to God appeared. Thus, power over the demon is transferred from the name of God to the person of the king, who is described as a magus.14 This de-velopment supposes that the present amulet, although graphically Christianized and chronologically later, contains nothing specifically Christian from the formulaic point of view and is related clearly to the general magical techniques of Late Antiquity. Finally, the men-tion of the names of Sisinnios and Sisinnarios together with Solomon shows that they were regarded as related and equally powerful at an early date and in a non-Christian setting; this association would continue into the Middle Ages, although sometimes the figures of Sisinnios and Sisinnarios could have an existence of their own. They can be found together in Greek charms; thus in a Greek work, entitled \"Magical Treatise\" by its editor, we read: Seals of the Living God, Lord of heaven and earth, as he bound and bridled all demons' power through the seal lie sent to King Solomon [...] bind, Lord, the four princes and their armies; bind, Lord the thirty six kosmokratores [...], bind, Lord, Ornias, dragon-winged Onoskelis, 13 G. Schlumberger, \"Amulettes\", 75: φεύγε μεμισιμένι σολομόν σε διόκι σισίννιος σισιννάριος. This formula is totally Christianized in a papyrus from the fifth century CE (Preisendanz, PGM, 2.212, Ρ 5 b): \"t Φεύγε, πνεύμα μεμισημένον ״Χριστός σε διώκει\". Here the female demon and Solomon disappear, being re-placed by more neutral and Christian terms. 14 The very name of God had tremendous power; the magician who fashioned the amulet indicated by his use of the name of Solomon that the king's name also had the same kind of power; see K. Grözinger, \"The Names of God,\" 53-69, who shows how in Hekhalot literature the names of the angelic beings became the hypostases of power."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the damned Gillou [...] and make them disappear from the dreams of so-and-so by the elders, Sineisios, Sinodoros and Sisinios [...] and by the holy angel Abaraph and the holy angels, Michael, Gabriel, Ourouel, Raphael...15 In this charm, we find some threads of tradition that bring together Solomon, Sisinios and his companions, and the figures of different male and female demons: thus, on one side, we have Ornias, Onos-kelis and the thirty six dekani (kosmokratores), who are present in the Testament of Solomon as some of the principal demons;\"' on the other, the female demon Gyllou as well as Sisinnios and his com-panions are mentioned as well. Perdrizet edited and translated a Byzantine story about an exorcism performed by Sisinios and his companions;1' the story has many parallels in different languages of the Christian Orient. 111 it, Sisinios and his companions have been transformed into Christian saints and they are described as riding horses and pursuit of the female demon Gillou. It is evident that the story maintains the principal identifying trait that we have found in the Solomonic amulets, that is, the apotropaic figures appear as horsemen; therefore, it is almost certain that we are dealing with different developments of the same Jewish tradition.18 15 Delatte, Anecdota, 98-99: \"...Σφραγίδες Θεοΰ Ζώντος, Κυρίου τοϋ ούρανοϋ και της γης, ώσπερ εδησεν και εχαλίνωσεν πάσαν τήν δύναμιν τών δαιμόνων διά της σφραγίδος ήν άπέστειλε τω Βασιλεί Σολομών [...], δήσον, Κύριε, τούς δ' άρχηγούς και τά στρατεύματα αύτών״ δήσον, ιύριε, τούς λσ' κοσμοκράτορας [...] δήσον, κύριε, τόν Όρνίαν, τόν πτεροδράκονταν της Σκέλιδος και τήν κατάρατον Γιλλου (...]και άφάνισον άπό τόν ϋπνον τοϋ δούλου τού θεού όδ(εΐνα), διά πρεσβειών τοϋ άγιου μάρτυρος Σινεσίου και Σηνοδώρου και Σισίννιου [...] καί τοϋ άγίου άγγέλου Άβαράφ και τών άγιων άγγέλων Μιχαήλ, Γαβριήλ, Όυρουήλ, Ραφαήλ, (...]).\" Concerning Sisinnios and his companions, cf. below, η. 1 7. The angel Abaraph is called Arlaph in other amulets. This \"Magical Treatise\" is linked with the Hygromanteia of Solomon; see Chapters 8 and 9. 16 The demon Ornias plays an important role in the Testament for he is the first demon to be subdued by Solomon and the one who presents each new bound demon to him. Despite this, his name does not appear in the Hebrew legends about Solomon and the demons, which suggests that its origin has to be placed in a Greek setting: in fact, Όρνία is the name of Adonias, the adversary of Solomon, according to the Old Greek text of 3 Kingdoms, attested in the proto-lucianic text (mss boc2e2), that preserves a variant of the Hebrew text. If the demon's name has its origin in the biblical Adonias, the linking of Solomon with demonology was made at an early date, and in a completely Jewish setting; on this aspect see the Chapter 4. 1 י Perdrizet, Negotium perambulans, 13-26. 1(1 On the relationship between the Greek text and the Jewish amulets see Naveh and Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls, 1 1 1-122.

The charm is in the form of a little story: Antaura—that is the name of a female demon—arose from the sea crying out and shouting. Artemis of Ephesus (the goddess of magic, often identified with Hecate) met her, asked her where she was going, and exorcised her.\" The questions of Artemis to the female demon are very similar to the ones that Sisinios and his companions make to Gyllou; besides, Solomon and Artemis appear together in various Greek and Latin amulets. It seems then, that the same kind of amulet co-existed in different religious ambiences. On the first Roman amulet see A. A. Barb, Der Römische Limes in Osteneich XVI (1926), cols. 53-68 (non vidi)·, id. in Jedermann-Heße III (Vienna, 1933), 26-33 (non vidi)\\ on Artemis and Solomon see Κ.

In this particular case it is interesting to note the βι that is prefixed to the magical name and that could stand for the Hebrew ב; the invocations would, then, be transliterations from a Hebrew source. Delatte (Anecdota, 249) transcribes another charm: \"...I adjure you, Strankalia of many forms, the one who attacks small children, the one who has hard hands and drags the children and strangles them and they die. These are the names of of the holy angels who overcome Gilou and any impure spirit, male or female, that are pronounced in the Hebrew lan-guage: Michael, Gabriel, Ourouel and Rafael, Gazael, Manasamouel, Abesabek, Saleleêl, Sabaoth, Adonae, Eloe [...]; I adjure you by the holy Sisinnios and Dionisios...\" (...ορκίζω σε, Στραγκαλιά πολύμορφε, ή έπερχομένη έπί τά μικρά παιδία, ήτις έχει χείρας σκληράς καί σύρει τά νήπια καί πνίγει αύτά καί τελευτώσιν. ταύτα είσιν τά ονόματα τών άγιων άγγέλων οϊτινες καταργούν τήν Γίλου καί πάν άκάθαρτον πνεύμα, άρσενικόν τε καί θηλυκόν, έβραίδα φωνήν διαλεγόμενον Μιχαήλ, Γαβριήλ, Ουρουήλ καί Ραφαήλ, Γαζαήλ, Μανασαμουήλ, 'Αβεσαβέκ, Σαλελεήλ, Σαβαώθ, Άδωναέ, [...]. ορκίζω σε εις τόν άγίον Σισίννιον καί Διονύσιον...).

A third type of amulet, which is more developed, transforms the model but at the same time retains its primary traits. In the first example of this new type the figure of an angel spears what looks like a demon; the angel is clothed with a tunic, is winged and has a halo; the fol-lowing phrase is inscribed around the drawing: \"Flee, Oh hated one, the angel Arlaph chases you.\"21 The charm is similar to the one studied above, the reference to King Solomon being replaced by a reference to the angel.22 Therefore, two substitutions have taken place and both indicate a further Christianization of the model. However, on the other side of the amulet we can see two different scenes; in the upper part we have two human figures representing the sun and the moon, above them stars and Harnes. In the lower part a lion is attacking a prostrate figure (probably a female demon); around the lion the following charm is engraved: \"Seal of Solomon, protect the one who wears you.\"23 Again we are dealing with a seal of Solomon, but in this case the victorious horseman representing Solomon has been transformed into a lion, and we have seen elsewhere how Solomon the Son of David was called the lion of Judah.24 Both amulets refer to the same stage of the tradition, the Latin one by means of the exorcism and the Greek by means of the illustration. Furthermore, the presence of the astrological figures is interesting insofar as it connects the amulet to astrological traditions that are placed under the authorship of Solomon, such as the Hygromanteia or the Selenodromion.25 language (Hebrew or Aramaic).

Preisendanz (\"Solomo,\" col. 683) notes the resemblance of the angel's name to the magical word αφαρα, αραφαι, αραφα (Preisendanz, PGM XIII, 777f), which is found in a Jewish setting as the names άβραάμ, άβραάχ, Ίαώ suggest. 23 Schlumberger, \"Amulettes,\" 76-77: σφραγις σολομόνος φύλατε τόν φορούντα. 24 In Ch. 6, \"Solomon the Son of David,\" we studied an amulet in Latin where the king is called Lion of Judah. 25 See Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\""},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"There are other examples similar to this amulet; they show small differences both in the wording of the charms and in the drawings. As it is not productive to study all of them, we will only add two other examples. The first amulet comes from Cyzicus and represents a rather complicated combination of all the models that have been studied so far.21' On the obverse we again find Solomon the horse-man spearing a demon; at his side the winged angel Araaph stands; the scene is surrounded by the charm: \"Flee, Ο hated one. Solomon pursues you (and) the angel Araaph.\"2/ On the reverse, two crowned figures representing the sun and the moon face each other and a lion is attacking the demonic figure. The inscription reads as follows: \"Michael, Gabriel, Ouriel, Raphael, protect the one who carries it; holy, holy, holy, PIPI, RPSSS.\"28 The four angels play an impor-tant role in exorcisms and frequently appear together with Solomon.29 However, what is more interesting is the presence of the word PIPI in what seems to be a partial quotation of the trisagion (Is 6:3) in a special form, since it uses the Greek letters that were usually em-ployed in the Jewish Greek text of Aquila instead of the tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew characters.30 This detail points to the persistence and use of ancient sources, with the biblical quota-tion still preserving the ancient method of transliteration; it consti-tutes a further evidence of the age of the charm and of its probable Jewish origin, despite the clear Christian peculiarities that the ac-tual amulet exhibits, especially in respect of its iconography.

In each of these works there are several examples of amulets; the amulet from Cyzicus, because of its interest, has been studied by each one of the authors quoted here. 27 Sorlin-Dorigny, \"Phylactère alexandrin,\" 287: φεύγε, μεμισιμένι, Σολομόν σε διόκι (και) άγγελος Άραάφ (note that the participle is feminine and is, there-fore, addressed to a female demon).

The second amulet presents an even more complicated design on which each of the elements described above appears.31 The inscrip-tion of the obverse is interesting since it calls the amulet a seal of God, as we have seen in the oldest type of amulets: \"Seal of the Living God, protect the one who wears it. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaöth, the heaven and the earth are full of your glory.\"52 The quotation of the trisagion has been slightly modified to made it more inclusive and complete;33 moreover it has been transformed into a vocative expression, as the change of the possessive adjective indicates, so that it addresses directly the divinity on whom the amulet's power de-pends. All these changes are in accordance with the inner working of the magical techniques and, again, there is nothing specifically Christian about them. Besides, the continued use of the word 'Sabaöth' points to the common magical techniques where it was frequently employed. On the reverse, the inscription is almost iden-tical to the preceding amulet: \"Flee, Ο hated one (Araaph the an-gel pursues you and Solomon), from the one who wears it.\"34 Again we have the female demon and the presence of the angel Araaph and Solomon, both of whom function as apotropaic figures. The absence of the word PIPI supposes that Christianization, when it occurs, is very superficial since the charm keeps the old wording. The last type of amulet to be studied is very similar in its iconog-raphy to those studied so far.35 On the obverse a horseman is spearing a female demon who is identified by her breast, which was not clear in the other amulets. Beneath the female demon there is a sketch of a lion walking to the right. Around these drawings, the following 31 Perdrizet, \"Σφραγίς,\" 48, η. 2-3; Peterson, Εις Θεός, 106-107. 32 σγραγίς τοΰ ζόντος θεοϋ φύλαξον τόν φορούντα. \"Αγιος, άγιος, άγιος, Κύριος-Σαβαώθ πλίρις ό ουρανός καί ή γί σης δόξις. 33 Cf Isa 6:3, άγιος, άγιος, άγιος, κύριος σαβαώθ, πλήρης πάσα ή γή τής δόξης αύτοϋ. 34 φεύγε μισιμένι Άραάφ ό άγγελος σε διόκι κέ Σολομόν άπό τοΰ φουρούντ(ος) (Delatte, Anecdota Atheniensia, 99).

On a bronze amulet from the collection in the British Museum there is no drawing but a combination of the inscriptions of the amulets discussed above within a charm that asks the help of god, the archangels and Solomon to protect a woman called Babina daughter of Theodosia: One god who overcomes Evil / Iaö Sabaö / Solomon, Michael, Gabriel Ouriel, protect and the own possesions / (reverse) ... / as a lion [?] / as well as a bull / [?] as well as a snake / ... an angel tied / the Lord untied / he healed the mother; having heard he fled / protect Babina whom Thedosia bore.39 The sense of the obverse is plain and easily related to the other amulets. However, it is more difficult to understand and decipher the reverse; what can be said is that it narrates a small historiola involving different animals with the aim of protecting Babina. Since the lion and snake are present in each of the other amulets it is more than likely that the writer of this charm was drawing from a tradi-tion shared by the other amulets described. 36 εις θεός ό νικών τά κακά. 37 Schlumberger, \"Amulettes,\" 81, 82. 38 For the actual drawings and examples of this kind of amulets see, Perdrizet, \"Σφραγίς,\" 49-50; see also the plates in Schlumberger, \"Amulettes,\" 80-83; Bagatti, \"Altre medaglie,\" 332-335, studied them superficially; Peterson, Εις θεός, 103-105. 39 Ο.

If every piece of evi-dence is put together, the result is that the existence of a tradition related to Solomon in his supposed capacities as exorcist was well established at least from the third century on, and that this tradi-tion underwent almost no changes, judging from the persistence of the design of the amulet and the quantity of such amulets found.40 A SEMITIC PARALLEL It has been proven that a tradition that depicted Solomon as a horseman spearing down a female demon existed in a Hellenized Jewish environment and that it was taken on by Christians almost without change. However, the channel of transmission of this tradi-tion can raise some doubts about its Jewish character. In order to resolve this difficulty, the Babylonian Jewish bowls provide us with a partial parallel; thus, the text of several bowls describes the spear-ing of Lilith, a female demon, at the hands of an angel: (5) I adjure you, Lilith Halbas (6) granddaughter of Lilith Razni [dwell-ing] in the house and the dwelling of Newanduk [the daughter of Kapni and s]haking boys and [gi]r1s.

Although the exorcist does not mention Solomon at this point in the text, it seems clear that the bowl attests to the same tradition that is at work in the Greek amulets analyzed above. Since the chronology of the Babylonian bowls (300-600 C.E.) over-laps that of the Greek amulets, it is likely that the same tradition was widespread and popular among magicians in both Greek- and Aramaic-speaking Jewry. In the Aramaic development the linguis-tic aspect is prominent, whereas in the Greek one the physical re-ality of the drawing has a major significance; this is because an amulet is small and portable whereas the bowls were more stationary, al-lowing the text to be given prominence, which is more in accordance with the inner working of Jewish magical techniques.42 The num-ber of Aramaic bowls where this tradition appears provides further proof for its popularity in Late Antiquity.43 CONCLUSIONS A magical practice linked to Solomon existed from the third cen-tury CE in a Greek-speaking environment. The principal manifes-tation of that praxis is provided by several types of amulets where King Solomon, depicted as a warrior riding a horse, kills a female demon; the identification of the rider is provided by the charms inscribed on the amulets. The absence of specific Christian traits in the earliest amulets seems to demonstrate the Jewish origin of the models. Although later amulets underwent different degrees of Christianization, they show remarkable fidelity to the Jewish sources and models, a fidelity that was determined by the intrinsic conser-vatism of magic. The amulets show how the praxis developed in a 42 Perhaps the text-based nature of the bowls is not as important as that of the amulets and they work more as physical objects of power; nonetheless, they do use rethorical and mnemonic components of the text. For a study of the rhetoric and formulae used in the Jewish amulets from the Cairo Genizah, see M. D. Swartz, \"Scribal Magic and its Rhetoric: Formal Patterns in Medieval Hebrew and Ara-maic Incantations Texts from the Cairo Genizah,\" HTR 83:2 (1990), 163-80. 4׳' For other bowls that preserve almost identical texts with some variation in the names of the angel and the female demon, see Isbell, Corpus, bowls 18-20, pp. 58-65; bowl 22, p. 69; see Yamauchi, Mandaic Incantation Texts, 231 for a Mandean example of the same Jewish tradition."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"popular setting independently of the literary traditions about Solomon.44 The Aramaic parallel furnished by the Aramaic Jewish bowls con-firms, albeit only partially, the Jewish source of the amulets, since the charms written on the bowls ask for the cooperation of a magic figure, who has to kill a female demon with a spear. Furthermore, they provide a context for the use of the Greek amulets: it is likely that, as the bowls seem to indicate, these amulets were intended for the protection of women and children against female demons (liliths).45 Later traditions about Sisinnios and his companions en-dorse this hypothesis and show how the characteristics of the fig-ures were shared at the same time by several of them (Sisinios, Solomon...). These Greek amulets show a particular development of the exorcistic traditions we find in different texts. They demonstrate that those traditions were part of everyday life and that they could be formulated in very different ways. 44 However, we can also find references to the development of the praxis in literary texts; thus, in the Syriac Zosimus (fourth century CE), we find a notice about Alexander and his invention of a special alloy (electrum) with which he sowed the earth: \"Then Alexander prepared a sort of engraved coins, formed with gold and silver, and he disseminated them in this earth [...] These coins that Alexander sows in the earth, the people who find them use them for the same thing, engrav-ing on them the figure of Alexander riding a horse. They hang them around themselves, as amulets...\" (M. Berthelot, La chimie au moyen âge, [vol II, L'Alchimie syriaque׳, Paris: 1893, reimp; Osnabrück, Amsterdam,: Otto Zeller / Philo Press, 1967], 262-63). Although King Solomon does not appear, it is evident that the text is speaking of the praxis we have analyzed in various amulets. 45 In the amulets Solomon appears always associated with a female demon, an association that we find in other texts. Perhaps it testifies to the antiquity of the traditions that identified the Queen of Sheba with a female demon. Grosso modo, it seems that both the Christian and the Jewish traditions did not completely adopt that transformation, although the Islamic tradition did so at an early date. Some-times the Jewish texts hint at such an identification, but it is not so clear as it is in the Islamic tradition; on the demonizing of the Queen of Sheba in Islam see J. Lassner, Demonizing the Queen of Sheba. Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam (Chicago, London: The University of Chicago Press, 1993); W. M. Watt, \"The Queen of Sheba in Islamic Tradition,\" inj. M. Pritchard (ed.), Solomon & Sheba (London: Phaidon, 1974), 85-103. On the Jewish tradition see L. H.

Their similarities to lists of secret things in apocalyptic literature provide a point of contact between both traditions and what we have called the \"Hermetic\" figure of Solomon. Within the Hermetic treatment of Solomon, the relation of the king to astrology is striking and important, as the numerous texts attributed or related to Solomon in which he is portrayed as astrologer seem to prove. The great majority of this material is in Greek, although there are also some witnesses in Hebrew and Aramaic; most of this material has not aroused much interest among scholars. In the following pages we will investigate some of these texts and the image of Solomon they reflect in order to understand their links with the other stages of the Solomonic tradition that we have stud-ied. For this purpose, we will analyse and study each text on its own, dealing with its structure, content, form and redaction, since the only path to follow is the one provided by the texts themselves. By doing so, we will be able to place each work within the traditions related to Solomon and, thus, to explain its function and origin. Finally, an explanation is needed to justify the decision to make a distinction between the Hermetic characterization of Solomon, studied in Ch. 5, and the astrological characterization of the king, which we are about to study now. At first glance such a distinction is unnecessary; however, each of our chapters responds to a differ-ent setting. In \"Solomon the Hermetic Sage\" (Ch. 5), we studied the first appearance of a tradition that crystallizes in Wisdom of Solomon and the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus in the creation of a catalogue"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"of Hermetic lore that is attributed to the king; the importance of both texts lies in that their witness to the early date of this tradition and to its influence. Nevertheless, the treatment of the figure of Solomon developed so much that a new portrait was created, based not on an exegesis of the biblical text but on the tradition that re-suited from that exegesis combined with external motifs. Astrology and magic came to the fore as protagonists; thus, we have here a Hermeticism of a different kind, which would function as a bridge between the image of Solomon in Late Antiquity and its further development in the Middle Ages. Several questions should be asked about the genesis, transmission, and importance ofthat tradition and about the role that Jewish elements play in it; in the following pages we will try to answer at least some of these questions. Several texts will be object of our attention. We will first study two passages of the Testament of Solomon (chapters 8 and 18) in which we gain a glimpse into the way astrological material was introduced within the Solomonic traditions. We find here the association of the King with demons from an early date and its decisive role in the constitution of the new tradition. After this, we will study the Hy-gromanteia of Solomon, a fairly obscure Hermetic text with astonishing astrological content. In this text the astrological material is distrib-uted around the structural framework provided by the pseudepi-graphical attribution to the king, which shows the strength of the links between Solomon and the astrological material. We will also study a brief fragment of the Mandaic Ginza, where Solomon ap-pears linked to some astrological figures and which furnishes us with a parallel that shows how astrological material was reinterpreted in mythological terms. In the same way, a Syriac alchemic writing will be included in our study since it shows how astrology was always in close contact with the figure of Solomon in Late Antiquity. Finally a work called Selenodromion of David and Solomon will be studied, since it shows the attribution of an astrological genre to David and So-lomon. In this text, demonology is totally absent; it represents the monotheistic adaptation of a pagan genre, the so-called Lunarium. The ascription of this work to Solomon seems to be an example of how the traditions about Solomon the astrologer evolved to the point where there was a real characterization of the king as knower of astrological lore, unconnected with demonology. With all these witnesses, it will become clear that, at least in certain circles, So-lomon was viewed as a kind of mystic teacher, versed in astrology."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE ASTROLOGICAL MATERIAL IN CHAPTERS 8 AND 18 OF TESTAMENT OF SOLOMON As we have seen before,1 Solomon was linked early on with demons and exorcism. This association had to be syncretistic by the very nature of the incorporated material. Thus, as the Testament of Solomon clearly shows, this demonology was enriched by contributions from different cultures, especially Jewish, Egyptian and Hellenistic. Among these contributions, it was natural that astrology, which played an important role within the realms of esoteric knowledge, was absorbed into the Solomonic traditions. The Testament exhibits this absorption in chapters 8 and 18, where the adaptation of the astrological tra-ditions is absolutely central. However, astrology permeates the whole work, with minor astrological references within the framework pro-vided by the exorcistic formula \"who are you?\".2 Accordingly, it seems necessary to evaluate each of these minor references, so that later on we may study the longer pieces of astrological material from the perspective provided by our examination of the smaller units. Besides some astrological allusions and the two long astrological passages in chapters 8 and 18, there are nine passages in which astrology is clearly located in the context of the identificatory for-mula \"who are you?\".3 For example, in Test. Sol. 2:2 the demon Ornias answers King Solomon's question about his constellation in this way: And answering the demon says: in Aquarius; and I strangle the ones who reside in Aquarius, those who called the Zodiac sign Virgo be-cause of the desire of women. ' Although the text is certainly difficult, the transformation of astro-logical into demonic material is, nonetheless, clear. In the same way, a female demon called Onoskelis attacks men with fair hair because 1 See Ch. 4, \"Solomon the Exorcist.\" 2 On this formula and the frame it provides see Ch. 4, \"Solomon the Exor-cist.\" 3 The passages are the following: Test. Sol. 2:2; 4:6; 5:4; 7:6; 14:7; 15:5-6. 4 \"καί άποκριθείς ό δαίμων λέγει׳ Ύδροχόψ״ καί τούς έν Ύδροχόφ κειμένους δι' έπιθυμίαν τών γυναίων έπί τήν Παρθένον ζφδιον κεκληκότας άποπνίγω.\" The original text is very corrupt and the present text represents an attempt by the editor to make it understandable (see McCown, Testament, 14). The translation of Duling (in Charlesworth, Pseudepigrapha, 1.963) is not possible on syntactic grounds; see H. M.Jackson, \"Notes on the Testament of Solomon,\" JSJ 19 (1988), 19-60, especially 27."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"\"they are of the same constellation as mine.\"5 The importance of astrological contact between men and demons is stated again in Test. Sol. 5:4 and 7:6 where Solomon asks the demon directly what his constellation is. The connection between stars and demons is thus clear in the Testament and was very likely made at an early mo-ment. Finally Test. Sol. 14:7 and Test. Sol. 15:6 seem to suggest an angelic hierarchy based on a division of the heavens into seven parts. It is quite probable that such a division alludes to the seven planets of Hellenistic astrology.1' As we have said, the astrological material is not limited to these passages; in fact, chapters 8 and 18 consist of astrological material that has been taken over entirely from the astrological ideas of Late Antiquity; in chapter 8 we again find the tradition about the seven planets, reworked into a catalogue of demons whose names corre-spond to vices: 1. And again I glorified God who gave me this authority and I or-dered another demon to come to me. And seven spirits went bound and entwined together, well formed in aspect and graceful. 2. And when I, Solomon, saw them I was amazed and I asked them: \"Who are you?\" And they said: \"We are the heavenly bodies, world rulers of darkness.\" 3. And the first says: \"I am Deceit.\" The second: \"I am Strife.\" The third: \"I am Fate.\" The fourth: \"I am Distress.\" The fifth: \"I am Error.\" The sixth: \"I am Power.\" The seventh: I the Worst. 4. And our stars look small in heaven and we are called as gods. We move together and we live together, sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olym-pus, sometimes on the great mountain.\"7 Here a reference to the seven planets is certain. Although they have been transformed into demonic figures, their astrological background 5 Test. Sol. 4.6: πρό πάντων δέ τοις μελιχρόοις οτι ούτοι συναστροί μού είσιν... 6 See, e.g., Test. Sol. 15:6: I am thwarted by the angel Rathanael who is seat-ed in the third heaven (καταργούμαι δέ υπό άγγέλου 'Ραθαναήλ τού καθεζομένου εις τρίτον ούρανόν). Perhaps the angelic hierarchy of some Hek-halot works goes back to the same souces; in the same way the division of the Book of the Secrets could have been inspired by this astrological tradition of the seven planets. י Test. Sol. 8:1-4: Κάγώ δέ πάλιν εδόξασα τόν θεόν τόν δόντα μοι τήν έξουσίαν ταύτην και έκέλευσα άλλον δαίμονα παρείναί μοι. και ήλθον πνεύματα έπτά συνδεδεμένα και συμπεπλεγμένα, εύμορφα τω ειδει και εύσχημα. 2. έγώ δέ Σολομών ίδών αύτά έθαύμασα και έπηρώτησα αύτά־ τίνες εστε; οί δέ ειπον ημείς έσμεν στοιχεία κοσμοκράτορες τοϋ σκότους. 3. και φησιν ό πρώτος· έγώ είμι ή 'Απάτη, ό δεύτερος״ έγώ είμι ή Έρις. ό τρίτος· έγώ είμι ή Κλωθώ. ό τέταρτος· έγώ είμι ή Ζάλη. ό πέμπτος· έγώ είμι ή Πλάνη, ό έκτος־ έγώ είμι ή Δύναμις. ό έβδομος• έγώ είμι ή Κακίστη. 4. και τά άστρα ημών έν ούρανώ φαίνονται μικρά και ώς θεοί καλούμεθα׳ ομού αλλασσόμεθα και όμοΰ οίκούμεν ποτέ μέν τήν Λυδίαν, ποτέ δέ τόν Ολυμπον, ποτέ δέ τό μέγα ορος."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"is evident, since they \"are called like gods.\" Besides, some of the new names of the heavenly bodies coincide with the ones quoted in the Gnostic treatise On the Origin of the World.8 In this chapter the trans-formation of the astrological material is more important than in Chapter 18, since it is re-arranged to fit into the context of exor-cism. It is particularly interesting that the seven spirits call them-selves κοσμοκράτορες τοΰ σκότου (\"world rulers of the darkness\") since we find the same expression in a Christian Greek Papyrus of the fourth or fifth century, in which the astrological entities have been transformed into demonic ones.9 The transformation and adaptation of the astrological material is more evident in Test. Sol. 18 where the astrological deities called decans appear, since the astrological block was taken over, with chang-es in the names of the demons but preserving the overall contents and the interest in astrological medicine: the decans have been trans-formed into demons with power over different diseases, which the exorcist can cure through adjuration of those demons. This last aspect recalls the interest in such matters that the Hygromanteia clearly shows, because its interest in astrological plants is centered precisely on their curative powers. The chapter of the decans is the most controversial and most quoted text of Testament of Solomon because the material that composes the chapter is clearly identifiable as a fragment of an older astrological tradition.10 The name decans is not a definition but reflects the fact 8 Cf., below, the notes concerning On the Origin of the World II, 5: 106.27-107. 9 See Preisendanz, PGM, 2.221, Ρ 13: ...αί άρχα[ί καί έξουσίαι καί κοσμοκρά-τορες τοΰ σκότου, ή καί ακάθαρτον πνεύμα ή καί πτώσις δαίμονος μεσεμβριναΐς ώραις, εϊτε ρίγους, εϊτε πυρέτιον...(\"ι!1ε powers and the authorities and the world rulers of the darkness\"...). In P. 10 (Preisendanz, PGM, 2.128), a Christian papy-rus or the sixth century we read: όρκίζω αυτό του [ς επτα κύκλους] τοΰ ούρανοΰ ־τόν πρώτον.... τον δεύτερον [...] ορκίζω ϋμας, ατινα ωμόσατε επί Σολομώνος... (\"I adjure you, the seven circles of the heaven: by the first... the second [...] I ad-jure you, the ones who swear by Solomon...\"). The present translation differs from Preisendanz's: \"Ich beschwöre ihn, (den Geist) bei den [sieben Kreisen]...\" It has to be noted that the decani that appear in Test. Sol. 18 also called themselves κοσμοκράτορες τοΰ σκότου. 10 See W. Gundel, Dekane und Dekansternbilder.

In this process, the old divinities were given a more defined personality and acquired do-main over a specified segment of time, that is, they became χρονοκράτορες (rulers of time);13 in addition to this, they were considered as demons by lay people.14 This astrological unit was subsumed under the exorcistic formula \"who are you?\", and the decans were personalized; that is, they become personal and definite enti-ties, equivalent to the other demons appearing in the Testament. This material has suffered an extensive reworking in respect of the names of the decans and its specific astrological content; the chapter on the decans is introduced as follows: 18. And I ordered another demon to come to me. And the thirty-six heavenly elements came to me, their heads like dogs, without form. Among them there were forms of men, bulls, dragons, and faces of beasts, birds and sphinx. 2. And seeing these I, Solomon, asked them, saying: \"And who are you?\" All at once with one voice they said: \"We are the thirty six heavenly elements, the world rulers of the darkness of this age. 3. And you cannot hurt or shut us up, Ο king; but since God gave you power over all the aerial, terrestrial and subterranean spirits, then we present ourselves before you like the other spirits.11 11 On the Egyptian decans see Bouché-Leclercq, L'astrologie, 215-231. 12 On Manilius' decans see Bouché-Leclercq, L'astrologie, 217-220. 13 Thus Bouché-Leclercq (L'astrologie, 222) says: \"les décans sont bien les étoiles, des étoiles fixes qui chacune à leur tour, suivant les saisons, 'montent à l'orient du ciel' au coucher du Soleil, et c'est ce que traduit exactement le terme ώροσ-κόποι (οί λαμπροί λσ' ώροσκόποι).\" This affirmation reminds us of Solomon's knowledge of stars and seasons according to Wisdom of Solomon 7:18-19. 14 See Festugière and Nock, Corpus Hermeticum, 3.36 (Stobaeus, Excerpt VI. 10): Τούτους ούν καλοΰσιν οί πολλοί δαίμονας· ουδέ γάρ ϊδιόν τί έστι γένος τό τών δαιμόνων, ούτε άλλα σώματα έχοντες έξ ιδίας τινός ύλης ούτε ψυχη κινούμενοι ώπερ ημείς, άλλά ένεργειαί είσι τών τριάκοντα εξ τούτων θεών (\"many call them demons; because neither the genre of the demons is a special genre, nor they have bodies of some special matter, nor are they moved by a soul as we are, but they are the energies of these 36 gods\"). 15 Test.

However, the king is not able to harm or imprison them, which is rather surpris-ing, if we consider what such a statement means: the divine power awarded to Solomon by God has a limit. The affirmation of inde-pendence by the demons perhaps originated in the astrological character of the demons, who were perceived therefore as more powerful or, at least, as less prone to be influenced. After this gen-eral introduction, Solomon summons each of the decans as follows: 4. And I Solomon, after summoning the first spirit, said: \"Who are you?\" And he said to me, \"I am the first decan of the Zodiac circle, I am called Ruax.\" 5. I cause the heads of men to ache and I move up and down their temples. Should I hear, \"Michael, imprison Ruax,\" I retreat at once.16 The decan, now a demon who has power to cause illness, can be chased away, a fact that was denied in the introduction to the chapter on the decans. We can observe the same structure in the whole chap-ter. The interest in iatromagic (curative magic) coincides with the interest found in other texts that link Solomon and astrology, such as the Hygromanteia. In several cases the name of the angels or di-vine figures who thwart the demons has obviously been Hebraized, a remainder of the importance of such pseudo-semitic nomina bar-bora in the Greek Magical Papyri, where such names were interpreted as a mark of a Jewish tradition or source.1׳ Although the astrological source of the chapter is clear, the as-trological content of Test. Sol. 18 is very blurred, at least in the text of recension A, which McCown printed, since he considered it the πρός με τά τριάκοντα εξ στοιχεία, ai κορυφαί αυτών ώς κύνες άμορφοι, έν αύτοΐς δέ ήσαν άνθρωπόμοργα, ταυρόμορφα, θηριοπρώσοπα, δρακοντόμορφα, σφιγγοπρώσοπα, πτηνοπρώσοπα. 2. καί ταύτα ίδών έγώ Σολομών έπηρώτησα αυτά λέγων και ύμεΐς τίνες έστε; ai δέ ομοθυμαδόν μια φωνή ειπον ήμεΐς έσμεν τά τριάκοντα εξ στοιχεία, οί κοσμοκράτορες του σκότους τοΰ αιώνος τούτου. 3. άλλά ού δύνασαι ήμας, βασιλεΰ άδικήσαι ουδέ κατακλεΐσαι άλλ' έπειδή έδωκέ σοι ό θεός τήν έξουσίαν έπί πάντων τών άερίων πνευμάτων καί έπιγείων καί καταχθόνιων, ιδού παραστήκομην έμπροσθέν σοι ώς τά λοιπά πνεύματα (my translation). 16 Test.

This supplementary part continues the text: \"from Aries and Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.\"19 If we insert this passage into the main body of the text, it acquires a new aspect: \"the other spirits from Aries and Taurus, Gemini and Cancer...;\" thus, all the spirits and demons are put under the aegis of the twelve signs of the Zo-diac; because of this, the astrological material introduced into with-in the structural framework of the Testament would seem to reflect more than a casual interest in such insertions. However convenient a textual reading may be, we must take into account that this read-ing has to be supported by some supporting evidence. As we shall see, a fragmentary papyrus containing Test. Sol. 18:27-28, 33-40 justifies this textual choice. Preisendanz was the first scholar to note the existence of a frag-mentary papyrus that contained parts of Test. Sol. 18:33-40, but Daniel studied it in more detail and added other two small fragments (Test. Sol. 18: 27-28) that complete the text at our disposal.20 It seems that the papyrus preserves a rotulus, that is a scroll that stretches vertically and not horizontally.21 The format of the rotulus was not usually employed for literary works but rather for documentary works such as wills, bills, etc. Perhaps, then, we have here one of several rotuli that would have contained different chapters of the Testament, so their pseudepigrapical attribution would be reinforced by the use of a documentary format found in wills.22 On palaeographical grounds the papyrus can be dated to around the five or sixth cen-tury, which makes it the oldest extant manuscript of the Testament of 18 On the textual history of the Testament see McCown, Testament, 30-38, 105-108; Delatte, Anecdota, 211-227; Preisendanz, \"Solomo,\" 689. 19 McCown, (Testament, 51) in the critical apparatus to 18:12 where Ms. Ρ adds: άπό κριοί), καί ταύρου, διδύμου τέ καί καρκίνου, λέοντος, καί παρθένου, ζυγού τε καί σκορπιού (sic) τοξότου, αίγωκέρωτος, ύδροχόου, καί ιχθύος. 20 See Preisendanz, \"Ein Wiener Papyrusfragment,\" 161-167; Daniel, \"The Testament of Solomon XVIII 27-28, 33-40,\" 294-304. 21 See E.

Its importance for us lies in the fact that it preserves a text that closely follows recension Β and that distributes the decans among the twelve signs of the Zodiac. In addition to that it supports the general value of Recension Β for the whole of the text since this recension preserves readings that are clearly superior to A on many occasions.25 The papyrus, then, supports our text-critical choice of Recension B, as containing the better readings, in which the astrological ma-terial is intimately linked with the demonology of the decans.24 Also, since the chapter on the decans circulated as an independent unit, it furnishes more evidence of the importance in certain circles of the combination of astrology, demonology and magical medicine in connexion with Solomon, at least from the fourth to fifth centuries onward. Thus, what is only suggested in Wisdom of Solomon 7:19 acquired gradual importance in other writing attributed to Solomon; in the Testament, the interest in demonology outweighs all other tra-ditions. Gradually, the astrological material gained ascendancy as the central point of the Solomonic tradition; thus, the Testament shows how Solomon the exorcist could not be separated from the Solomon the astrologer. These two images coexisted from the beginning and we shall see how works like the Hygromanteia show the development of Solomon the astrologer and the importance of this image for subsequent understanding of the character of Solomon.25 23 There is disagreement about the priority of the different recencions; Mc-Cown defended the value of A, followed by B, and then by C; Daniel, on papy-rological grounds, suggests that the order B, A, C would be more realistic, since McCown constantly had to supplement his text (mainly Ree. A) with Recension B. In at least one case the papyrus supplies the correct reading for the Testament; thus the Greek word Ρύξ that McCown took as a second name for all of the decans from twentieth to the thirty-sixth, would be addressed to Solomon, as Preisendanz ventured (\"Solomo,\" 678). As Daniel says (\"Testament,\" 296): \"The papyrus con-firms Preisendanz's suggestion as to the the meaning of the word. Wherever the Mss. have ρύξ (or ριξ or ρίξι etc.) with or without a preceding και (or κε or κι etc.) the papyrus has κύριε ρήξ. From the 4th century on, ρήξ as a transliteration of rex occurs in Greek, generally to designate rulers of non-Byzantine kingdoms. The mss show various mis-spellings which arose from iotacism, the interchange of υ with η or ει, and the interchange of υ and ω. Thus an unrecognized ρήξ could easily generate all the variants found in the tradition. Before the variants of ρήξ, Ree. A sometimes has what seems to be a superflous emphatic καί, and in the same position in Ν the variants of ρήξ are preceded by κε, κι or κη. All of these must have arisen from the Christian abbreviation of κύριε, namely κε.\" 24 So Daniel, \"Testament,\" 295: \"F or the present chapter, however, we find the reverse situation: Ree. A seems to be shortened from a version which is com-mon to Ree.

General Introduction to the Text In another chapter we proposed the existence of a characterization of Solomon as Hermetic sage that was present both in Jewish and Christian texts. Among the Hermetic writings, there is one text that seems to support this hypothesis; it is placed under the aegis of King Solomon and is interesting because of the mixture of astrological and magical material that appears on it. Although this work is entitled Hygromanteia (\"divination through water\"), there is no mention ofthat magical art, but we do find all the elements characteristic of Her-metic literature.2'י The date of the text that is preserved in the Ms. Monacensis 70 (fifteenth century) is uncertain because no writer of either Late Antiquity or the Middle Ages quotes it. Heeg, the editor of the text,2' was persuaded of the antiquity of the book and he thought, with Reitzenstein, that its author had to be a member of a Hermetic sect, since he had imitated the apocryphal authorship of the Hermetic texts;28 for Heeg the origin was most likely Egyptian. In addition, the numerous chapters about the plants of the seven planets, the signs of the Zodiac and similar material, which comprise the principal parts of the book, point to the same Hermetic environment. Similar writings were attributed to the Egyptian Nechepso, Al-and the Hygromanteia in a clearly intermingled fashion, could mean that demon-ology and astrology were viewed as complementary aspects of the traditions re-lating to King Solomon; for a detailed description of the contents of Harleianus and their distribution see, Delatte, Anecdota, 387-388. 211 For a general introduction to the history of the text and its contents see Preisendanz, \"Solomo,\" 690-694. 27 J.

The extant title is perhaps to be explained by the possible loss of some of the pages of manuscript from which our principal text was copied, since the contents have nothing to do with the techniques of hydromancy.32 It is quite probable that the original text includ-־!l Festugière, La révélation, 1.137: \"D'autre part, on lisait, dès le 1er siècle de notre ère, un ouvrage de Nèchepso sur la connexion des plantes et des astres, et les manuscrits astrologiques grecs et latins nous font connaître, sur le même sujet, un certain nombre de petits traités qu'ils attribuent, mais non sans désaccord, au roi Alexandre de Macédoine, à Hermès Trismégiste, à Hénoch, à Solomon (lequel s'adresse à son fils Roboam).\" 50 Festugière, La révélation, 1.143: \"Il subsiste, sur les plantes des douze signes, deux sortes d'écrits qui se distinguent fort bien, non pas seulement parce qu'ils sont attribués d'un côté à Thessalos (Harpokration) ou à Hermès, de l'autre à Solomon, mais parce que la liste des plantes et la nature de l'exposé relatif à chaque plante diffère d'une manière très sensible dans les deux cas.\" 31 Festugière, La révélation, 1.146: \"Mais ce n'est pas la seule différence. Dans l'opuscule 'de Thessalos', les paragraphes sont uniquement composés de recettes médicales très précisés, avec indication des mesures (once, etc.) pour chaque in-grédient et du mode d'emploi en chaque maladie. Ces recettes sont purement médicales (potions, liniments, cataplasmes) et pourraient être empruntées à n'importe quel auteur sérieux: il n'est point question d'amulettes ou de charmes. Au contraire, dans le texte 'de Salomon', les recettes sont plus vagues et, d'autre part, elles concernent bien plutôt la magie que la thérapeutique; en outre la langue est beaucoup plus proche du grec populaire de l'époque byzantine et des temps modernes. [...]Il s'agit donc bien ici, non pas d'une simple variante, mais d'une tradition nettement diverse, d'une école rivale. Dans son état actuel, le texte 'de Salomon' est certainement plus récent que celui 'de Thessalos', mais il se peut qu'il remonte, en substance, aux premiers siècles de notre ère.\" 3־ However, it seems that Solomon was reputed to have been familiar with such techniques since there are examples of amulets that show the king perform-ing the procedure of hydromancy, as Goodenough (Jewish Symbols, 2:232) states : \"On one amulet accepted as Jewish by Frey, as well on many others, Solomon plays yet another role. Fig. 1059 shows him, named, as a magician in a long robe; here he stirs a pot and holds a lance or spear in his left hand.

This last text provides the material to fill in the lacunae of Monacensis 70. Besides, despite the different word-ing in some parts of the tradition, the relationship is significant to us, all the more so if we take into account that the manuscripts of Delatte share a great deal of the same material, even though these manuscripts are later. b. The Technique of the Hydromancy It is almost certain that the so-called Hygromanteia coincides with hydromanteia, or lekanomanteia; these techniques are similar in their procedures and try to foretell the future by using a basin filled with water in which different demons are summoned either directly by the magician or indirectly, with the help of a boy who acts as me-dium.34 Heeg furnishes us with some sources that help us to under-stand the mechanism that linked such traditions with Solomon, leav-ing aside the likely characterization of him as a Hermetic sage.35 Augustine describes the technique as follows: Since also Numa himself, to whom no prophet of God nor holy angel was sent, was forced to perform hydromancy, so that he saw images of gods, or better mockeries of the demons, from whom he heard what he had to arrange and observe whith regard to the sacred.36 on either side, and in the field are a star, a caduceus of Mercury, a five branched menorah, and various 'Characters.' Solomon is here perfoming the rite of hydro-mancy, a form of magic in which demons were called to appear as reflections or shadows on the surface of the water of a pot.\" i!

And by means of the charm, the mannikins became alive in the dish and in the same way were soaked. At the very instant they were soaked the true ships of the attacking enemies that were on the sea were destroyed because of the man's great experience in magical power.38 Pseudo-Callisthenes describes how Nectanebus performed a tech-nique that is called lekanomancy, as a result of which his enemies were destroyed. What interests us is that the demons again play an important part and that the account is incorporated within the 37 See the definition of Hinemarus Remensis (Migne, PLM, 125:718): \"The Hydromanters are those who call forth the demons' shadows through the inves-tigation of water, and they say that they see there either images or mockeries and hear other things from others\" (Hydromancii sunt qui in aquae inspectione umbras dae-monum evocant, et imagines vet ludificationes ibi videre et ab aliis aliqua audire se perhibent).This author also perceived the role of the demons as fundamental; furthermore, the word \"mockeries\" suggests to us that he believed that something actually happened during the procedures of hydromancy. 38 Ps.- Callisthenes Vitae Alexandrì Magni, I. cap.

Consequently, giv-en the early connection of Solomon with demons and astrology in a Hellenized setting, lekanomancy was easily included within knowl-edge associated with Solomon by combining the purely divinatory with the astrological and demonologic aspects inherent in the char-acterization of the king in Jewish tradition. In the texts we are about to study, interest fluctuates between the purely astrological materi-al and magical material. c. The Text c.l. The Problems of the Text Because of the type of literature to which the Hygromanteia belongs there are serious problems in respect of its textual tradition. We are not dealing with texts that were preserved and carefully copied for their literary value or religious importance. These texts were wide-ly used, functioning on occasions as manuals for the professional practitioner. Since they were, thus, not protected as either canon-ical or aesthetical significant compositions, they were prone to cor-ruption or manipulation. Only the necessity of preserving the wording of names and procedures with as little variation as possible acted as a deterrent against textual corruption. However, this did not pre-elude the creative growth of material that could be added or removed purely on the grounds of fashion. Thus, this type of texts oscillates between verbal immutability and redactional change.40 As a result, the study of such textual traditions is complicated, since the classical approach of establishing a \"secure5' critical text is al-most impossible; the words that Swartz applied to the prayers in 39 Cf. also M. Psellus, τίνα περί δαιμόνων δοξάζουσιν \"Ελληνες, (ed. I.F. Boissonade; Norimbergae: 1838, 42 [op. cit. in CCAG, 7:2,142]), who describes in detail the practice of lekanomancy, drawing on early Byzantine sources. 411 Nock's insights about the textual character and transmission of the magical papyri could be applied to these texts: \"Working copies have a history which is quite different from that of ordinary literature. In literature the form is essential; one may insert glosses, and one makes errors of transcription, but one seeks to preserve its shape. A working copy has to be useful, and so one modifies it and incorporates suggestions from other sources. So much we might conjecture, and in fact there is abundant evidence of these proceedings in our texts.\" (Nock, \"Greek Magical Papyri,\" in Essays in Religion, 1.177)."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Hekhalot literature are equally useful for dealing with these texts: The state of these texts precludes reliance on a classical \"critical edi-tion\" by which an ideal text is reconstructed to be analysed by the scholars. Rather it is necessary in dealing with this material to nego-tiate among varying forms of the text. These variants are not restricted to problems of wording. Whole sections of given text may appear in one recension, and be absent in another.41 It is clear, then, that no reconstruction of the text should be attempt-ed, because the result would be artificial and would reflect the ed-itor's prejudices and preferences rather than the \"original\" document. Therefore, the study of this kind of text has to be synoptic, consid-ering each version in itself and, at the same time, placing it into the general picture provided by the analysis of the whole tradition. Accordingly, the recensio and collatio will be partial means of research, but they will not have as their final resul, a constitutio textus; in the same way, we will not attempt the emendatio or conjecture, because there is no Urtext to reconstruct. The path to tread and to be fol-lowed when studying this kind of text is that of form- and redac-tional criticism, as Swartz saw clearly in his study of mystical prayer:4 ־This can be accomplished through form criticism of the text tradition particularly by identifying and distinguishing individual literary units with an eye to their formal characteristics and their relationship to their redactional content.45 41 M. D. Swartz, Mystical Prayers in Ancient Judaism (Tübingen: J.B.C. Möhr, 1992), 33. 42 In fact the insights of P. Schäfer (\"Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature,\" Hekhalot-Studien [Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1988], 8-16, esp. 15-16) into the Hekhalot literature are applicable as well to our texts: \"(1) the so-called Hekhalot literature is an extremely fluid literature which has reached different literary expressions in different manuscripts at different times and in different places. (2) The final literary product of a certain work is in most cases a fiction the redactional identity of which is questionable. (3) It is therefore a false presupposition to reconstruct the individual \"works\" of Hekhalot literature and to delineate one in comparison and contrast with another. (4) It is equally mistak-en to attempt to establish the age of these \"works\" as final literary products. (5) In the tension between tradition and redaction the decisive weight must be placed on the tradition in each case. (6) The individual traditions have been combined into different and variable literary units. The relationship of such a literary unit to a certain \"works\" is of secondary importance. (7) The transmission of smaller and larger units of texts has to be described according to its different relation-ships and functions. (8) Divergent settings of a tradition are therefore not to be reduced to assumed \"original forms\" but have to be respected as autonomous stages of a development. (9) Any edition of texts of Hekhalot literature has to take into consideration that one text is an illusion.\" 4i Swartz, Mystical Prayers, 34.

This Arabic manuscript was de-scribed by Graf as an \"ethical exhortation of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam\"; it is not clear whether this is the same work as the Hygro-manteia.9 יThis list of manuscripts is by no means exhaustive; undoubtedly, there are more copies of the Hygromanteia lying in libraries due to bad cataloguing and other adversities. However, the existence of four-teen manuscripts that preserve the Hygromanteia completely or partially wittnesses to both the popularity and importance of the work, as well as to its continuous copying until the nineteenth century; thus, we have two manuscripts of the fifteenth century, four of the six-teenth, three of the seventeenth, two of the eighteenth, and finally two of the nineteenth century. On linguistic and philological grounds they all seem to go back to Byzantine copies. Their geographical origin is also very diverse, which, again, indicates the popularity of the work. Besides, three of the manuscripts (numbers 3, 8, 13), which exhibit a clear inner relationship among themselves, seem to be of Italian provenance. Thus, it is likely that the tradition they reflect goes back to Byzantine copies, and it is well known that Italy was at the fringe of Byzantine dominion and that quite early traditions were preserved there, even when those tradition fell into oblivion in the rest of the empire.60 Besides, at least several manuscripts also preserve either a complete copy of the Testament of Solomon or at least an abbreviated one that includes the list of the decans, demons that were clearly related to astrology.61 59 On this manuscript see Duling, \"The Testament of Solomon: Retrospect and Prospect,\" 97; Alexander, \"Incantations and Books of Magic,\" 373-374; both authors quote G. Graf, Geschichte des christlichen arabischen Literatur (Vatican, 1944), 1.209-210 (non vidi). According to Duling (\"Testament,\" 110), Graf notes other similar texts; if so, this would indicate the existence of a Semitic version of the Hygromanteia, which would provide further support for the popularity of the work and its antiquity, since the Karshuni version (Arabic text written in Syriac char-acters) may have as source a Greek one. 60 I am employing here the linguistic notion that the borders of a linguistic zone are more conservative and less prone to changes and evolution than the center; the same tendency can be observed when establishing the history of a textual tradition. 61 Thus, manuscript 10 (Cod. Petropolitanus 4) preserves a version of the Testa-ment of Solomon that only includes the decans; see Cod. Petropolitanus 19 (CCAG XII, 61), which, although it does not include the Hygromanteia, preserves a very similar version of the Testament. It has to be noted that the oldest manuscript (fifth to sixth century C.E.) we have of the Testament of Solomon is a papyrus that only has the list of decans; thus, it seems that the list of the decans had an independent develop-"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Undoubtedly, the use of catalogues as a tool for understanding the relationship between different manuscripts of a tradition has some flaws, since we cannot compare the manuscripts themselves. How-ever, this method surveys the contents of the different manuscripts; thus, we obtain an assessment of the arrangement of the materials in each manuscript, which allows us to assess their stability and persistence as individual units. According to this method, in our manuscripts the Hygromanteia of Solomon appears either alone or as-sociated with a partial version of the Testament of Solomon that con-tains the list of the decans. In several cases it is incomplete contain-ing only the first part with the pseudepigraphical ascription and a partial list of the demons and angels of each day. In the following pages we will deal with the tradition as repre-sented in the texts edited by Heeg and Delatte. By doing so, we can acquire a better comprehension of the inner working of the tradi-tion and of its development. d. Comparison of the Different Texts d. 1. Preliminary Matters As seems evident from the precedent pages, a comparative study of the different texts that form the Hygromanteia is necessary. The ideal situation would be to have at our disposal complete copies of the manuscripts available and to compare all of them in a large synop-sis. Unfortunately, we do not have complete copies or editions of the manuscripts at our disposal. Therefore, we shall proceed in a less ambitious manner: we will undertake a synoptic study of the different texts, even if the texts are clearly incomplete; although this procedure is far from ideal, it will allow us to understand the rela-tionship between the different texts as they stand, as well as the development and growth of the tradition. Heeg's text (Monacensis 70) will constitute the backbone of the comparison. Each of the other texts will be checked against it and will be evaluated accordingly. The reason for this is that Monacensis 70 seems to preserve the oldest version of the work since it is clear-ly related to other Hermetic texts attributed to legendary figures, and its Greek is by far the best of the witnesses. Besides, the pseude-ment linked to the portrayal of Solomon as astrologer. About the papyrus frag-ment of the Testament of Solomon see Daniel, \"The Testament of Solomon XVIII 27-28, 33-40,\" 1.294-304."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"pigraphical attribution is more structured and complex in this text than in the others and, finally, its contents focus on astrology and magical-astrological medicine, whereas the other texts seem to tend more toward magical and exorcistic materials. If Monacensis 70 is our first touchstone, it will not be the only one: the pseudepigraphical references to Solomon and Rehoboam will also provide us with a supplementary check of the different texts. Thus, this synoptic study will be carried out in different stages: first, the different texts that share the pseudepigraphical attribution to Solomon will be compared against Monacensis 70\\ thereafter, the texts that seem to form a special derivation of the tradition will be stud-ied by themselves, by means of a partial synopsis. It is evident that the method proposed raises some difficulties as to how to integrate the data provided by the two stages of the study, but it is the only approach that allows us to deal with related texts, which, nonethe-less, will show up large differences in either the wording or the order of the materials. As the texts to be studied are rather long, we will show only the actual results of the review, so that the flow of the discussion will not be interrupted by the synopsis; besides, the synopsis is a medi-um, a tool for research, not an end in itself.62 Finally, a word about the texts that will be object of our study. As has been shown in the review of the text's manuscripts, we do not have at our disposal every one, nor, on the other hand, would their study be of equal value, due to their fragmentary state. There-fore, from all the manuscripts and texts described, six have been selected and subjected to study.63 Although it migh have been in-teresting to have included more texts, it was not absolutely essen-tial, since the six selected provided us with a textual basis large enough to study the development of the text and to draw some conclusions that shed new light on our understanding of the Hygro-manteia and similar texts. Besides, given the natural tendency to expansion in this kind of text, the inclusion of more textual witness-es would not necessarily have made our study more complete, but only more complicated.

(li According to our classification of manuscripts, numbers 2, 3, 8, 11."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"d.2. Structure of the Text First of all, a word must be said about the state of the manuscripts under study. Only four manuscripts of the six preserve the begin-ning of the work, where the pseudepigraphical attribution to Solomon and Rehoboam is most developed, serving as the conducting thread for the whole text. Two of these four manuscripts (Monacensis 70, Ath. Dion. 282), preserve the beginning of the work and the pseudepigraph-ical material in a more complete form, although Ath. Dyon. 282 shows a clear tendency to shorten the astrological material and is, gener-ally speaking, much abbreviated. The other two manuscripts (Har-leianus 5596, Paris. 2419) also have a pseudepigraphical attribution; Harleianus 5596 follows Monacensis 70 quite closely, but it has a large quantity of extra material at a point where Monacensis is clearly frag-mentary (see below). Paris. 2419 has an abbreviated text for the first part, especially if we compare it with Monacensis 70, although the other two texts (.Harleianus 5596, Mount. Ath. Dyon. 282) are also longer than it. Finally, the other two manuscripts (Cod. 1265 National Library of Athens, Cod. 115 of the Historical Society) are lacking the entire begin-ning of the work; there is no pseudepigraphical attribution and they display a rather different ordering of the material. However, they coincide with Harleianus 5596 and Paris. 2419 in the parts that are missing from Monacensis 70 and Ath. Dyon 282, parts that deal spe-cifically with the magical technique (hydromancy) to which the title of the work refers. All the texts are in the second person singular, as if they were addressed to Rehoboam.'4י Now, we will establish the structure of the material that consti-tutes the Hygromanteia according to Monacensis 70, which will be sup-plemented if neccesary by the other manuscripts. This structure is shared in general lines by the textual tradition that we have at our disposal. However, and for the reasons explained above, Monacensis 70 and Harleianus 5596 have provided us with the framework of the work, since they are less fragmentary than the rest of the manuscripts. On the whole, Monacensis 70 has been followed, supplemented by Harleianus 5596 in the places in which Monacensis 70 is clearly frag-mentary; to aid comprehension, it has been noted on each occasion which manuscript is being used.

Pseudepigraphical unit: Instruction of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam (f. 240). A. The seven planets and their dominion during every hour of the days of the week. 2. Pseudepigraphical unit: Instruction of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam (f. 243). A. Angels and demons who rule over every hour of the days of the week (f. 243v). 3. Pseudepigraphical unit: Instruction of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam (f. 246). A. Prayers to the seven Planets (f. 246v). 4. Abbreviated pseudepigraphical unit (f. 247v). A. Prayer to the angel of each hour. 5. Pseudepigraphical unit: instructions of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam (f. 248). A. The characters of each planet (incomplete in Monacensis 70). 6. Pseudepigraphical unit: instruction of Solomon to his son Re-hoboam (material from Harleianus). A. Magical material. 7. Another technique (πράξις) to summon the spirits: Pseudepi-graphical instructions to Rehoboam (.Harleianus, f. 30v). (1). Gasteromanteia. (2). Pibaktoromanteia. A. Angels and demons of each day (Harleianus). B. Other horoscopes of the day and night (?): hours of every day of the week and appropiate actions to be performed in them (.Harleianus; same as above in Monacenis 70). C. The plants of the Zodiac (Monacensis). 8. Pseudepigraphical unit: Instruction of Solomon to his Son Re-hoboam. A. The plants of the seven planets. According to the above outline, the structure of the work is based on the direct invocation of Solomon to Rehoboam, which we have 65 See Appendix 2 \"Greek Synopsis of the Hygromanteia\" for the whole text of Harleianus 5596; for the other two see Delatte, Anecdota Atheniensia, 10-101."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"called \"Pseudepigrapical unit;\" every one of these units includes direct mention of Rehoboam to whom concrete instructions about the use of the material are given; there is an exception, labelled \"Abbrevi-ated unit,\" where Rehoboam is not specifically mentioned, although there is an instruction formulated in the second person as in the other units. However, despite the structuring role of these units, the first of them, which includes a dialogue between Solomon and bis son, comprises the key to the structure of the work, since the \"pseudepi-graphical units\" that follow clearly depend on it. This important passage reads as follows: Pay attention, my very dear son Rehoboam, to the exactness of this art of mine your father Solomon, to the procedures, in which the whole technique of the divination through water lies, because it is necessary before anything [...] to master the observations of the planets and of the signs of the Zodiac and to follow them and to do them according to your will. Rehoboam asks his father Solomon: Father, where does the force of the acts lie? Solomon responds: The entire art, grace and force of what is sought remains in plants, words and stones. First of all, know the positions of the seven planets; because the seven planets lead the seven days of the week; let us begin from the week's first day, that is, from the Sun's day. And in the first period we assume that the Sun rules, and, in the same way, we will explain the others that follow.1'6 The similarities of this text with some Hermetic passages have been noted already. However, besides those points of contact with Her-metic tradition, this pseudepigraphical unit is important, since in it King Solomon and his son Rehoboam appear as interacting person-alities. Accordingly, the use of the second person, which persists 66 Heeg, \"Excerptum,\" CCAG VIII, 2: 143-144: Πρόσεχε, ώ άκριβέστατε υιέ 'Ροβοάμ, εις τήν άκρίβειαν τής τέχνης ταύτης έμοΰ τοΰ πατρός σου Σολομώντος έν τοις πράγμασιν, έν οίς κείται ή άπάσα προσοχή τής ύγρομαντείας, οτι χρή πρό πάντων [...] έπικρατεΐν τάς επιτηρήσεις τών πλανήτων και τών ζψδίων και μετ' αύτά μετέρχεσθαι και ποιεΐν κατά τό βουλητόν.

This would-be dia-logue is surrounded by explanatory material of the same type that we find in the other \"pseudepigraphical units,\" as it summarizes and describes the material that will follow. The force of the pseudepi-graphical ascription of the whole text lies in this first passage and in the mention of the names of Solomon and Rehoboam. The follow-ing pseudepigraphical introductions structure the text around the apparent instructions to Rehoboam; the king speaks to his son and gives him detailed instructions so that he will be able to perform the techniques that are described and to understand the material prop-erly. Thus, the pseudonymity of the text has formal and ideological functions and goes beyond simple attribution. Every single \"pseudepigraphical unit\" follows the pattern estab-lished in the first, introducing the different units of material that compose the Hygromanteia. In the first block (,Monacensis 70, ff. 240-243v) each day of the week is put under the patronage of one of the seven planets; every planet is in charge of the expected day, that is, each day is under the dominion of the planet from which the actu-al names of every day of the week derive. However, several details suggest that the actual ordering of the days of the week could have a Jewish background. Thus, the days are designated by ordinal numbers as in the Jewish week, with the exception of the so-called day of preparation (παρασκευής ήμερα) and the Sabbath. The fact that the seventh and last day is called Sabbath also seems to point to a Jewish week.(w Besides the importance of its background, this block of material contains explicit instructions about the actions and activities to be or not to be undertaken in every hour, because each hour is also under the dominion of a planet. The second block of material (.Monacensis 70, ff. 243v - 246) de-scribes the angels and demons who are in charge of every hour of every day of the week. Their names are a mixture of nomina barbara, Semitic sounding denominations and classic figures of angelology (Michael, Raphael, etc.) and demonology (Asmodai, Ornai, etc.). It 67 Although Constantine established the seven-day week in the Roman calen-dar, designating Sunday as the first day of the week, the days were not called by the ordinal numbers, but bore the names Moon־s day, Mars's-day, Mercury's-day and so on. Saturday or Friday were not called Shabbat and \"day of preparation\" respectively. Perhaps Friday was called \"day of preparation\" among Greek-speaking Jewish communities and the evangelists took this name from them."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"is likely that much of the material contained in the text was linked to Solomon because of the traditional association of the king with demons. In fact, a late Greek ms. shows how the list of angels and demons was transformed into a handbook for exorcisms.1,8 Although these two blocks appear at the beginning of the arrange-ment proposed, their position could vary. Thus, in Harleianus 5596 and in the two codices Atheniensis69 we find both units at the end of the work. They preserve almost the same wording of the text and their inner structure. However, Ms. Harleianus 5596 duplicates the content of the unit. At the beginning it has an abbreviated version, whereas it has a longer version at the end. Thus, both units were viewed as linked with the Hygromanteia and especially with Solomon, which suggests that our text has a rather long history and develop-ment behind it.70 The third and fourth units are composed of invocations or prayers to win the favor and cooperation of the seven planets and of the angels in charge of every hour. The prayers to the planets are clearly '8י See Delatte, CCAG X, 53 (Cod. 167 Bibliothecae Societatis Christianae): F. 1. Προσευχή κάι εξορκισμός τοΰ προφήτου Σολομόντος περί τούς δαίμονας.

Exorcisms against the demons who rule over the seven days of the week and in the twenty-four hours of a night and a day, by means of the holy angels who cause them to cease working\"). Although the ms. is dated in the XVIII century, it is most likely that its use as a handbook is much older. 69 Codex 1265 of the National Library of Athens, Manuscript 115 of the Historic and Ethnographic Society of Athens. 70 The so-called Horarium, found in the Syriac Testament of Adam or in the Greek Apotelesmata and attributed to Apollonius of Tyana, also shows a remarkable in-terest in the prayers to be directed to God at every hour of the day and night. This text, which has different versions in Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic, Georgian and Ethiopie, is attributed to Adam and embedded in the Syriac Testament of Adam as well as in the Armenian version. The Greek version is usually attributed to Apollonius of Tyana. It has to be noted that both the Armenian and Greek texts are preceded in their manuscripts by astrological works dealing with the powers of stars and their relationship with the days of the week, which suggests that both Hygromanteia and Horarium emerge from the same kind of cultural setting. On the Horarium see, S. E. Robinson, The Testament of Adam. An Examination of the Syriac and Greek Traditions (SBLDS 52; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982), 105-127; idem, \"The Testament of Adam,\" in Charlesworth (ed.), The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, 1.989-995; M.

Lord and God, all powerful father, creator of the visible and invisible, king of those who rule and lord of those who are lords, give us the power of your grace, so that Zeus may be subject to us, because all is possible for you, Lord.71 The divinity who is invoked, is described in monotheistic terms. The entire prayer is transformed and adapted from a pagan source by adding this invocation to a God who is described only as creator and supreme master. From the expression used we cannot ascertain the Christian or Jewish character of the prayer, since there are no unequivocal traces of either religion.72 The second part of the prayer seems to be a slightly reworked pagan invocation of the different planets, described here as lesser divine figures: I adjure you, Zeus, by your wisdom and your knowledge, by your curative force and your heavenly course, in which you orbit, and by these names, Anöph, Orsita, Atnox, Onigeui, Atziniel, Ankanitei, Tyneos, Genier, Kaniptza, so that you may bend your grace in sub-jection to me in this service that I am doing.73 In the above prayer, Zeus is considered first an actual divinity with certain attributes (wisdom, knowledge, healing powers), but at the same time he is described in astronomical terms (\"your heavenly course\"). It seems that there is an inner conflict that the author of the material chose not to resolve. This conflict does not seem to exist in the prayer to the angels, where the terms of the invocations are better defined: I adjure you, angel so-and-so, you who rule over this hour and are appointed for the provision and the service of the human race, [an-71 Heeg, CCAGVU1, 155: Κύριε και Θεέ, πάτερ παντοκράτωρ, ό δεμιουργός ορατών άορατών, ό βασιλεύς τών βασιλευόντων και κύριος τών κυριευόντων, έπίδος ήμΐν δύναμιν χάριτος, ϊνα ό Ζεύς υποταγή ήμΐν, δτι πάντα δύνατά σοι, κύριε.

Their combina-tion in a pair forcefully reminds us of the demon-angel pair we find in Testament of Solomon; it seems, then, that both texts share the same tradition, although it is not formulated in the same way. Neverthe-less, in the Hygromanteia, knowledge about the hour of invocation is more important than knowledge of the name. Thus, although the tradition is the same, it has been worked into different trends: in the Testament knowledge of the demons' names gives power; in the Hygro-manteia, however, power is achieved through the knowledge of the right time. This tradition seems to be attached to the Solomon-ic exorcistic cycle, since it concerns the power of demons and an-gels. The following two units of material are clearly related to magi-cal practices. The first (\"the symbols of the planets\") describes how the character corresponding to each planet is to be written. The Codex Monacensis does not preserve the whole text, which is broken at the description of the Moon's character. Harleianus fills in the lacuna with a slightly different text, which also includes the fumigations (θυμίαματα) and the seals (σφραγίδες) for each of the planets. This block is closed by a \"pseudepigraphical attribution\" (Harleianus) in which Solomon summarizes the knowledge that he has handed down to Rehoboam and announces the techniques his son still lacks: Then, dearest son, you have learned the power of the planets, the days and hours in which each of the planets rules, the techniques of their prayers and the demons that are subjected to them (by which you are going to pray to the angels that rule over them and the demons who are subjected to the the angels). Still it remains to teach you to be learned 74 Heeg, CCAG, VIII, 2.157: Όρκίζω σε, ώ άγγελε δείνα, όστις κυριεύεις τήν ώραν ταύτην και εί σύ βαλλόμενος πρός πρόβλεψιν και ύπουργίαν τοΰ άνθρωπίνου γένους, δείνα, ό πάντοτε πρόθυμος, δυνατός και άνδρείος και όξύς, όρκίζω σε εις τόν θεόν, ος σε εταξε φυλάττειν τήν ώραν ταύτην, ϊνα είσαι σύνεργός μου μετά τοΰ ύποτακτικοΰ σου τοΰ δείνα δαίμονος, ός έπροετάχθη νά εναι δούλος εις τήν ώραν ταύτην και έσύς νά μοι συνεργήσεται και νά ποιήσεται τήν δουλείαν ταύτην, νά εναι δόκιμος, καλή και άληθινή.; see \"Syn-opsis,\" Column 1, fol. 248."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"in the instruments that are used for the technique of the congregating of spirits, especially the sword and the garments and all the other things and all that will be said afterwards.75 At this point the contents of the Hygromanteia change radically; the astrological material is still important, but only as part of the pro-cedures to be followed for the various techniques that are described. In consequence, Solomon appears under a new light and is trans-formed into a magician \"avant la lettre,\" very different from the other characterizations we have seen until now. The inclusion of this type of material probably took place at an early date (second or third century CE), since, as we shall see, the magical techniques record-ed in this part of the Hygromanteia are parelleled by the Greek mag-ical papyri and do not present significant traits of Christianization.6 ׳It would be useful at this point of the discussion to note some details about the exact position of the magical material within the Harleianus 5996, which also preserves a copy of the Testament of So-lomon. The distribution is quite strange since the works appear com-bined as follows: ff. 7-7v fragment of Recension C of the Testament, ff. 8-18 fragment of Recension A of the Testament, ff. 18v-39v Hygro-manteia, ff. 39v-41v fragment of Recension C of the Testament.77 This fact suggests that the whole of the Hygromanteia materials were seen as obviously linked with the traditions relating to Solomon; similar-ly the probable Italian origin of Harleianus 559678 points in the same direction as Monacensis 70, to a Byzantine reservoir of ancient tradi-tions that remained isolated in what was once part of the Byzantine Empire, the south of Italy. The description of the power of the plants of the Zodiac and of the seven plants of the planets (.Monacensis, ff. 248-253) constitutes the two final blocks of astrological material.79 In them Solomon 75 Delatte, Anecdota, 406 (Harleianus f. 24): ιδού μεμάθηκας, φίλτατε υιέ, τήν δύναμιν τών πλανήτων, τάς τεχνάς τών ευχών αυτών και τούς δαίμονας τούς ύποτασσομένους (έν οις μέλλεις εΰχεσθαι τούς τε άγγέλους τούς έπιστατούντας αυτών και τούς δαίμονας όπου υποτάσσονται τών άγγέλων)· λοιπόν δέ σοι έτι είδέναι και τά όργανα τά υπηρετούντα πρός τήν τέχνην τής συναγωγής τών πνευμάτων, δηλαδή τήν μάχαιραν και τά ιμάτια και τά άλλα οσα δή και οία έν τω καθεξής είρήσεται.

The medicinal powers and the different combinations of preparations are depicted in very vivid terms, which seems to suggest that the text corresponds with actual practices of medicinal or magical botany. Thus, this part of the text would also have been destined ultimately for use as a re-pository of techniques and procedures that were intended to be carried out by real practitioners, much the same way as the Testa-ment of Solomon is a tractate about demonology and exorcism in which, as we have seen, different demons and a detailed exorcistic proce-dure are described. Although there are several texts that preserve similar traditions linking them to other legendary figures, our text differs from them in its greater propensity for magic. The catalyst for the inclusion of this kind of material was again, as in Wisdom of Solomon or the Jewish Antiquities of Josephus, a special exegesis of 3 Kings 5 where the four elements (air, earth, fire, water) are referred to allegorically. How-ever, as the text combines magic and medicine in a greater degree than the mere exegesis of the biblical passage would allow, it sug-gests, then, that we have here a new development of the tradition, intimately linked with traditions that go much further than can be observed in Wisdom or Antiquities. e. Conclusions The Hygromanteia is a work in which an immense wealth of material related to Solomon has been preserved. Most of the material con-cerns astrology, although a large part of the work also deals with magic in the strictest sense of the term, since it describes different kinds of procedures and manipulations in order to reach a goal with the aid of supernatural forces and powers. This work is extremely interesting for us because it presents Solomon in the new guise of astrologer. In fact, the text is composed of different units from var-ious sources, which seem to be older that the Hygromanteia itself. However, the structural framework of the text is formed by the pseudepigraphical attribution to Solomon and Rehoboam which is firmly stated by using two procedures: first, the different techniques and information are channelled through direct speeches and instruc-tions of Solomon to Rehoboam, which summarize the contents of the blocks of astrological material and, secondly, the second person is used constantly throughout the work, in order to add weight to"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the pseudepigraphical attribution. Also, by using the second person, Solomon seems to address at the same time the actual reader of the work, which is in this way transformed into a veritable handbook of astrology and astrological medicine. The traditions contained in the Hygromanteia link Solomon with the ambiguous world of astrology and magic. Although both disci-plines were held in high regard by the various peoples of Late Antiquity, it seems rather strange that such disciplines were connected to Solomon. It is likely that this relationship was established on three grounds: (1) in the first place, the traditional association of Solomon with demonology and exorcism, which would account for the list of the angels and demons ruling over every hour of the week. (2) Sec-ondly, the characterization of Solomon as Hermetic sage would explain the passages about the power of the plants of each planet and signs of the Zodiac, because this passage is indirectly based on the theory of the sympathy of the whole cosmos. (3) Finally, a spe-cial exegesis of 3 Kings 5:13 (the allegory of the four elements) and 3 Kings 5:10 would have acted as the point of departure, as the following passage from Qoheleth Rabbah seems to attest: It is written (1 Kings 5:10): \"And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.'''' What, then, was the wisdom of the \"children of the east\"? They were skilled in astrol-ogy and divination from birds, and expert in augury.H״ Although this passage aims to explain what was meant by the wis-dom of the \"children of the east,\" and does so by interpreting the biblical text as referring to astrology, it also characterizes in an indirect way the wisdom of Solomon, relating it to astrology, although it is a \"special\" astrology since the proof text states so clearly that Solomon's wisdom was superior. In any case, this text shows that an exegesis that somehow connected Solomon and astrology was known about and employed in a Jewish setting.81 Therefore, the 80 For this translation see S. Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine. Studies in the Life and Manners of Jewish Palestine in the II-IV Centuries C.E.

Scholem regarding about demonology in Kabbalah: \"The names of the seven kings of the demons in charge of the seven days of the week, very popular in later Jewish demonology, were derived from Arabic tradition. [...] Other systems of demonology are connected with lists of the angels and the demons in charge of the night hours of the seven days of the week, or with the demonological interpretation of diseases such as epilepsy\" (G. Scholem, Kabbalah, [New York: 1974] 324). Both demonological conceptions appear in the Hygromanteia, so it is quite likely that their source was much older that Scholem supposed and not neccessarily of Arabic derivation. Scholem (Kabbalah, 187) also affirmed that \"practical kabbalah did manifest an interest in the magical indue-tion of the pneumatic powers of the stars through the agency of specific charms,\" a practice that could be paralleled by the prayers to the seven planets that we have in the Hygromanteia. Although the Kabbalah is later than the Hygromanteia, their respective traditions with reference to astrology could have been drawn from similar sources, if not from the same source. Perhaps late Judaism was less mono-lithic and rabbinically oriented than is generally believed, and in certain domains, such as that of esoteric knowledge, was more open to interaction with the trends of the day. Thus we can again state with Scholem [Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism and Talmudic Tradition [New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America 1965], 34) that \"the logical conclusion seems to be, given the historical circumstances, that initially, Jewish esoteric tradition absorbed Hellenistic elements similar to those we actually find in Hermetic writings.\" However, due to the special character of these texts and traditions we should adopt only as a hypothesis the probable Jewish origin of the text we have studied and not as an unshakable truth, as Goodenough (Jewish Symbols, 2:233-235) did, based on a cursory analysis of the text. On the importance of the astrology in Jewish literature see also J. H. Char-lesworth, \"Jewish Astrology in the Talmud, Pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Scroll and Early Palestinian Syngogues,\" HTR 70 (1977), 183-200. 83 In an amulet from the Cairo Geniza (T-S. Κ 1.18 / T-S. Κ 1.30) that we have already quoted (see Ch. 4, \"Solomon the Exorcist\") Naveh and Shaked (Magic Spells and Formulae, Geniza 10, 152-157) give us an example of such a combina-tion. This Amulet, which begins with a direct order to a sign of the Zodiac asking for protection, explicitly mentions the seven angels that are appointed over the seven days of the week, divides the different types of demons according to the primary element (fire, water, wind, earth) from which they originate, in a form that remind us of the Hermetic exegesis of 1 Kings 5, and, finally, it also men-tions Solomon and the seven spirits (= planets?) that Ashmedai taught him about. It is clear that in this amulet we have a mixture of different traditions that pre-viously we have found separately; although the copy of the amulet is late, the traditions it contains seem to be much earlier. It is noteworthy that the geographical provenance of the present amulet (Egypt) coincides with the likely origin of many of the astrological and magical traditions studied in the Hygromanteia״, this detail"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Finally a word is needed about the chronology of the text. The actual text, from the Greek in which it is written, is clearly Byzan-tine. As the Greek is quite correct and shows some Italian influence, it is likely, as we have just said, that the actual redaction was made in the south of Italy in the early Middle Ages. However, since in spite of its obvious Christian transmission it does not offer obvious signs of Christianization, it is likely that its actual form preserves much older material that could go back to the first centuries of the com-mon era; therefore, the Hygromanteia could be considered as a repos-itory of traditions, more or less transformed through the passage of time, that go back to the moment in which the traditions about King Solomon developed in a way that is very remote from the original biblical sources or the traditional link with demons. This develop-ment borrowed Hermetic teachings, philosophy and, as we can see in the Hygromanteia, astrology and magic. Since much of the mate-rial used is in different text attributed to other legendary figures, it is likely that there was a conscious effort to enrich the image of Solomon and that this took place in a highly syncretized environ-ment with strong ties with Jewish or Jewish-Christian Hellenistic milieux.81 The significance of the Hygromanteia within the tradition relating to Solomon is quite striking, as it shows a developed form of the astrological material and of the astrological characterization of the king. Most often, such material only comprised notes referring to stars and planets that had been transformed into demons; however the Hygromanteia shows how the astrological component could and did acquire an importance of its own within the portrait of Solomon, to the extent that in the Middle Ages the image of Solomon according to this portrait was extremely popular and widespread, as the nu-argues against the Arabic source of these traditions, defended by Scholem (Kab-balah, 324). On this amulet from the Genizah see also Schiffman and Swartz, Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts, 68-82, and especially 79, where they mention that Sefer Raziet (Amsterdam, 1701; p. 34b) contains a passage in which the angels, planets, and signs of the Zodiac for each day of the weeks are listed. The Sefer Raziet compiles older writings of the Hekhalot literature, but in its present version it is not much older than the edition of Amsterdam; on this book see Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 349-50. 84 The fact that of the figures to whom these teachings were attributed two were pagan (Alexander the Great, Hermes Trismegistes) and the other two Jew-ish (Enoch, Solomon) is evidence of the widespread importance of such teachings and explains the pseudepigraphical attribution to Solomon."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"merous references to Solomon in astrological manuscripts seem to prove.85 SOLOMON AND ASTROLOGICAL MATERIAL IN THE MANDAEAN GINZA We have already seee how Solomon played a role in the Mandae-an Ginza where the title son of David, demons and a direct mention of Jesus appear in very close contact.80 It has been argued above that the Mandaean text is an additional witness to a very early as-sociation of the title Son of David with Solomon, and that it consti-tutes a further proof of the existence of a Jewish-Christian polemic about the exorcistic power of both figures. In the same way, the Mandaean Ginza also shows how certain astrological themes were related to Solomon. As Mandaeism had a clear interest in astrolo-gy, it is not suprising that astrological traditions appear in its prin-cipal book; what is surprising is that this astrological material is related in an indirect way to Solomon. Thus, the Hygromanteia is not the only work to present astrology in connection with Solomon, nor the Greek environment the only one to exhibit such a link.87 The Ginza (\"Treasure\") is the principal and largest collection of writings of Mandaeism; divided in two parts, the larger is called the \"Right Ginza\" and is composed of eighteen tractates of mythologi-cal, theological and didactic content, whereas the \"Left Ginza\" de-scribes the ascent of the soul to the realm of light.88 Mandaean lit-erature in general, and this text in particular, presents many difficulties, principally in respect to the date and provenance of the traditions recorded. Among the earliest traditions are the beliefs in demonic beings and angels; the seven planets and the signs of the Zodiac are transformed into angels or demons. The text that we shall study presents these seven planets in a context in which Solomon appears indirectly, forming part of a sort of cosmic genealogy. The text is as follows: 189. From Noah the man until the place of Jerusalem is built there are six generations. It exists in its prime one thousand years. 83 See Catalogus Codicum Aslrologorum Graecorum, passim. 86 See Ch. 6, \"Solomon the Son of David.\" 87 Most probably such a relation also goes back to Jewish tradition, since, as Scholem affirmed, \"the Jewish elements are much stronger than generally sup-posed\" in Mandaean texts (see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 5). 88 K. Rudolf, \"Mandaeism,\" in D. N. Freedman (ed.) The Anchor Bible Dictio-nary (CD ROM Edition; New York: Doubleday, 1997)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"190. Then, King Solomon, the Son of David, is born and appears; and he is king over Judah and the powerful ruler of Jerusalem.The demons and the devils submit to him and walk according to his will, until he glorifies himself and is ungrateful to his Lord for the good things. Then, the demons and the dews turn away from his words and the power is taken from him. 191. Then Christ, the prophet of the Jews appears. He shouts to the planets and converts them to his side, and each one fights for him. 192. The seven demons, the tempters, tempt the children of Adam. The first is Šamiš also [known] by the name (the Sun). The second is the holy spirit Estrā (Aphrodite), also [known] by the names Libat, Amamit. The third is Nbu (Mercury), the Messiah of lies, who falsifies the first glorification. The fourth is Sin (the Moon), Saurel by name. The fifth is Kewān (Kronos), the sixth Bel (Zeus), the seventh Nerig (Ares). 193. The demons from the house of Samiš grant to their adorers gold, silver and luxury. He sends messengers out into the world, and they lead the sons of mankind into worship of the Sun and the Moon. 194. The demons from the house of Libat let loose against men mad-ness, adultery, fornication, concupiscence, passion, incantation and magic. 195. The demons of Nbu-Christus perfidiously attack by surprise the children of men. They take hold of them, they seize them and their families from their houses, they carry them off to the mountains and plains.[...] 196.

The demons from the house of Nerig attack by surprise the chil-dren of men, they skin them, they cut their flesh to pieces and they spill their blood on the earth. They are called oppressors, clerics, priests and men of oracles.89 The structure of the text is clear: two parts can be differentiated in it: (1) a genealogy where Solomon and his power over demons have a prominent place and where both he and Jesus are viewed within the same genealogical scheme, and (2) a reference to the seven planets and the demons that fall within their influence. Thus, the second part, which mentions the seven planets and lists the demons that belong to each planet, immediately reminds us of the list of angels and demons who rule over each hour of each day, which, as we have seen, is ruled at its alloted time by a particular planet. In the Ginza text the planets are transformed into demons; in the Hygromanteia they are treated as kings of celestial, that is demonic, beings, whose favour 89 Lidzbarski, Ginza, 28-29."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"and good graces can be won. Both texts link this astrological mate-rial with Solomon, but in the case of the Mandaean text there is also a clear link with the tradition about Solomon's power over the demons. Whereas the Hygromanteia reinterprets this tradition and uses it, without mentioning it directly, the Ginza maintains it and relates it to the astrological material. The fact that both texts preserve the same material, albeit as the result of different processes, suggests that this combination was made early on and that the character of So-lomon was already linked to astrology in the first or second century CE, the date of the earliest Mandaean traditions to arise in Pales-tine and Syria, which were brought orally to Mesopotamia. That both texts refer to the same kind of traditions is evident, although there are some difficulties regarding their respective dates and provenances. However, we could resolve these difficulties if we had a third source that was easy to date and combined the tradi-tions being studied. Such a source is a Greek magical tablet from the early third century CE. The text is as follows: I conjure you, whoever you are, demon of the dead, by the god who created earth and heaven, Iona; I conjure you by the god who has authority over the subterranean regions, Neicharoplez...by...holy Hermes...Iao...Sabaoth...the god of Solomon, Suarmimoouth...I con-jure you by the god of this day in which I conjure you Aöabaöth. I conjure you by the god having authority over this hour in which I conjure you, Jesus.9\" We have here a combination of all the traditions mentioned in a text the chronology of which is very early (third century CE) and whose provenance, although syncretistic, displays evident Jewish-Christian traits. The tablet has an invocation the form of which reminds us of a formula that is used very often in the Testament of Solomon (\"Whoever you are\");91 it mentions Hebrew divine names, 90 Εξορκίζω σέ όστις ποτ' εί, νεκυδαιμον, τόν θεόν τόν κτίσαντα γήν καί ούρανόν 'I(0va.

Most probably this relation was due to the traditions about Solomon and the demons, which were included within the astrological material. These tradi-tions about Solomon could appear at the same time or in isolation, but their accumulation in the same text is significant, since it seems to prove that the association of Solomon with astrology happened at an early date (second or third century CE, perhaps already in the first century CE) in a Hellenistic environment. THE SYRIAC ZOSIMUS (BOOK XII OF ZOSIMUS) Zosimus of Panopolis (modern Akhmim in Egypt) was a famous alchemist whose work can be dated to around the beginning of the fourth century. He seems to have been a clear exponent of the in-tellectual current of Late Antiquity as his personal creed was a mixture of Christian Gnosticism and Pagan Platonism; he derived his creed apparently from the philosophic Hermetica.93 Although a prolific author, only fragments and extracts of his writings have survived. Some have reached us in their original Greek form with-in a Corpus of excerpts from Greek writers on alchemy, composed by a Byzantine scholar around the eighth or ninth century, and whose best witness is a Venetian Manuscript (M) of the eleventh century.94 Besides these Greek excerpts, we have a Syriac translation of Zosi-mus in a Cambridge manuscript of the fifteenth century.93 Among his numerous writings there is a particularly important one addressed to a woman called Theosebeia. It is comprised of many 92 Thus, see the Hygromanteia of Solomon (Heeg, CCAG VIII, 149, f. 233): \"Know, my dearest son Rehoboam, that one good angel and one evil demon are lords at each hour. If you want to do a good deed, adjure the good angel so that he may be an ally to you; if you want to do any other, bad, deed, adjure the demon, so that he may be your ally; and you will do so, if you want something. It begins easily in this way.\" 93 On Zosimus of Panopolis see Scott, Hermetica, 4:104-144. 94 See Berthelot, Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs, 1.184, 2.234-237. 95 See Berthelot, La chimie, 2.260-266."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"books, the title of each book being a letter of the Greek alphabet. The major part of the work addressed to Theosebeia is preserved in the Syriac translation mentioned above; only the letter τ survives in the Greek original. It is precisely in this work that we find two fragments related to the traditions concerning Solomon that we are examining in this chapter. We will include them both here, since they show how different traditions about Solomon were known to Zosimus and how he used them according to context. The first fragment indicates clearly that the traditions about Solomon and his power over the demons had widespread acceptance by the time of Zosimus. In the text Zosimus exhorts Theosebia as follows: So do not be pulled back and forth like a woman, as I have already told you in the books According to Energy. Do not roam about searching for God; but remain seated at home, and God, who is everywhere and not confined in the smallest place like the demons, will come to you. Being calmed in body, be calmed also in your passions, desire, plea-sure, anger, grief and the twelve portions of death. And in this way, keeping yourself straight, summon the divine to you, and thus the one who is everywhere and nowhere will come to you. And without being told, offer sacrifices to the demons, but not offerings, not the ones that are pleasant and nourishing to them, but rather the ones that are repellent and destructive to them, which Membres told Solomon, king of Jerusalem, and especially the one that Solomon himself wrote as result of his own wisdom.'\"' In this text, Zosimus is explaining to Theosebia how to reach the divine through quiet contemplation; he constructs a polemical struc-ture in which God is opposed to the demons. Thus, God who is everywhere is compared with the demons who are confined in the smallest place; most probably this is an allusion to the tradition about the demons' confinement in jars or bottles at the hands of Solomon, 96 For the text see Festugière, La révélation, 1:367-368: σύ γοϋν μή περιέλκου ώς γυνή, ώς και έν τοις κατ' ενέργειαν έξειπόν σοι, και μή περριρέμβου ζητούσα θεόν, αλλ' οικαδε καθέζου, και θεός ήξει πρός σέ ό πανταχού ών και ουκ έν τόπω έλαχίστω ώς τά δαιμόνια׳ καθωζομένη δέ τω σώματι καθέζου και τοις πάθεσιν, έπιθυμίς( ήδονή θυμώ λύπη και ταΐς δώδεκα μοίραις του θανάτου״ και ούτως αύτήν διευθύνουσα προσκαλέση πρός έαυτήν τό θείον και όντως ήξει τό πανταχού öv και όυδαμού. και μή καλουμένη πρόσφερε θυσίας τοις δαίμοσιν, μή τάς προσφόρους, μή τάς θρεπτικός αυτών και προσηνείς, άλλά τάς άποτρεπτικάς αύτών και άναιρετικάς, ας προσεφώνησεν Μεμβρής τω 'Ιεροσολύμων βασιλεΐ Σολομώντι, αύτός δέ μάλιστα Σολομών δσας εγραψεν άπο τής έαυτού σοφίας״"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"a tradition that was known to our author, as we shall see. Besides, in the catalogue of evils that Zosimus lists, he makes an obscure reference to \"the twelve portions of death,\" which could be under-stood as an astrological reference to the planets of the Zodiac. Apparently, Zosimus is polemicizing against part of the traditions related to Solomon. In the last part of the text, he makes direct reference to the the tradition concerning Solomon's composition of exorcisms, but he transforms it slightly since, according to Zosimus, Membres is the one who handed down such \"sacrifices\" to So-lomon.97 Since according to ancient traditions it was Membres one of the Egyptian magicians who fought against Moses, this allusion also has a negative component. We can conclude then, leaving aside the transformations, that it is most likely that Zosimus knew both the traditions about Solomon and the demons as well as those that combined demonological lore with astrological material. This last point is supported by a text from the Syriac translation of the twelfth book of Zosimus; the text is as follows: Among the Egyptians, there is a book called The Seven Heavens, attrib-uted to Solomon, against the demons; but it is not correct (to say) that it is by Solomon, since these bottles had been brought at another time to our priests; that is what the language employed to denote them makes one suppose, because the expression \"bottle of Solomon\" is a Hebrew expression. At any moment, the great priest of Jerusalem gets them, according to the plain sense, from the lower abyss of Jerusalem. After these writings were spread everywhere, still unfinished, they were corrupted. It is he (sc. Solomon) who composed them, as I have said above. But Solomon only wrote a single book about the seven bottles, while some person invented and composed commentaries at different epochs to explain what this work contained; but in these commentar-ies there is some deception. All or almost all agree concerning the function of the bottles directed against the demons. These bottles acted like the prayer and the nine letters written by Solomon: the demons cannot withstand them.98 Evidently, as it now stands, the text has suffered corruption either as a result of its translation into Syriac or as a result of the previous 'י' For a modern assessment of the apocryphal writings and the legends con-cerning Jannes andjambres see A.

The English translation has been made from the French translation of the Syriac original."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"process of transmission of the Greek text. However, it still provides us with valuable data; in it, Zosimus refers to a book called The Seven Heavens, whose author is Solomon. Its contents are also clearly stat-ed: it is a work of exorcistic material. Zosimus also mentions the existence of commentaries on that work, in which the only thing on which they seemed to agree was the existence of a work composed by Solomon about \"the seven bottles,\" which is clearly exorcistic. To all these notices we can add the initial statement that the book was known among the Egyptians. Beginning with the last remark, several observations can be made about the text: the term \"Egyp-tians\" can be understood as a direct reference to the Gnostic move-ment of which the author was aware, and this seems to be confirmed by the repeated mention of the seven bottles. Thus, we read in a passage of the Gnostic tractate The Testimony of Truth, (IX,3 : 69.31-70.30): They are wicked in their behaviour! Some of them fall away to [the worship of] idols. [Others] have [demons] dwelling with them as did David the king. He is the one who laid the foundation of Jerusalem; and his son Solomon, whom he begat in adultery, is the one who built Jerusalem by means of the demons, because he received [power]. When he [had finished building he imprisoned] the demons in the temple. He placed them into seven waterpots. They remained a long time in the waterpots, abandoned there. When the Romans went up to Jerusa-lem they discovered the waterpots, and immediately the demons ran out of the waterpots as those who escape from prison. And the waterpots remained pure thereafter. And since those days they dwell with men who are in ignorance, and they have remained upon the earth.\" The parallel is relevant because either Zosimus was aware of the Gnostic treatment of the Jewish tradition or of the Jewish tradition itself; in any case, the Gnostic text seems to prove that in Zosimus we have a combination of the exorcistic tradition about the impris-onment of demons in jars and, as we shall see, of astrological ma-terial.100 The Testament of Solomon Ε XI.3 also mentions a very sim-99 S.

I adjure you by the 1999 names who swore to King Solomon: when we hear the name of the Lord Sabaoth, we will flee from those. Solomon, who received wisdom from God, shut them up in bronze jars and sealed them with the name of God).102 It is interesting to note how the same exorcism is prone to transforma-tion and corruption, although the essential structure remains intact. In addition to that, Zosimus states that The Seven Heavens were similar to prayers and letters written by Solomon; as the exorcistic nature of these writings is clearly mentioned, one wonders whether Zosimus is referring here to prayers similar to the prayer we find in the Hygromanteia addressed to the seven planets or whether the so-called Characters (χαρακτήραι) should be identified with the let-ters to which Zosimus alludes. Besides, the title The Seven Heavens seems to refer to the seven planets, which have a significant role in astrology. In consequence, it is very likely that both Zosimus and the Hygromanteia refer to the same tradition, although Zosimus only hint at it. Besides, the text adds support to the existence of a shared tradition to which the whole textual corpus we are studying in this chapter would allude. Thus, we read: [...]The seven bottles in which Solomon shut up the demons were made of electrum. It is necessary to believe, in this respect, the Jewish writ-ings about the demons.

[...] The wise Solomon knows also how to summon the demons; he gives a formula of conjuration and mentions the electrum, that is, the bottles of elec-trum on the surface of which he wrote this formula.'\"3 In this text Zosimus makes references that reinforce our statements about the links between astrological material and Solomon. First, he insists on the Jewish character of the sources used. Thus, although noting the imperfect state of the book he has (\"the altered book\"), he proceeds to provide an (incomplete) list of its contents. We have as elements: (1) an angel who orders Solomon to make the bottles, a detail that reminds us of the introductory framework of the Tes-lament of Solomon, in which the archangel Michael communicates to Solomon that the power over demons has been awarded to him; (2) the indication that each \"bottle\" was named after one of the seven planets; and finally, (3) he notes that Solomon knew how to sum-mon the demons. The second point is particularly important for us, since it shows how Solomon was indeed related to knowledge of astrology and how this relationship could be modified according to the general content of a given composition. Thus, Solomon was associated with the seven planets at an early date. Zosimus, then, recognizes the existence of such traditions, but at the same time, he tries to polemicize against them, by limiting what should be accept-ed as genuine. It is likely that he was referring to works like the Hygromanteia; we can conclude then, that texts and traditions simi-lar to the Hygromanteia were widespread, at least from the fourth century in Egypt, which lends considerable support to the value and importance of the Hygromanteia as a reliable witness to traditions linked to Solomon. SOLOMON AND THE ASTROLOGICAL MATERIAL IN THE NAG HAMMADI TRACTATE ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD The work entitled On the Origin of the World forms part of the Gnos-tic codices found at Nag Hammadi. The discovery of such a library 103 M.

We have already analysed some of these occurrences, since they are relevant to other texts or traditions we are interested in, such as the competence of Jesus and Solomon as exorcists or the recording of the Jewish tradition about the shutting up of the de-mons in jars.105 On the Origin of the World is especially important for understand-ing Gnosticism.10(1 Although the text seems to be a \"well planned literary composition without extensive secondary alterations,\"107 it also shows an extraordinary mixture of Jewish, Manichaean, Chris-tian, mythological, magical and astrological material. We can place the composition of the text around the early fourth century in Al-exandria. The principal ideas of the texts are centered on the ere-ation of earthly man by the Archons as well as on the story of redemption by of Pistis Sophia; Jesus Christ clearly plays a second-ary role, which makes this tractate essentially non-Christian, although his presence suggests that the tractate was at least superficially Christianized. Universal eschatology is central to the work, in which it is possible see a massive adoption of motifs and ideas from Jewish apocalypticism. The author of the work used several sources and traditions that are included within his narrative framework as ref-erences, quotations, summaries and so on. It is precisely because of this redactional technique that the text preserves three references 104 For a reassessment of Gnosticism following the discovery of the library see J. M. Robinson, \"Introduction,\" in idem, The Nag Hammadi Library, 1-26. More important for us is the possibility of the existence of a Jewish and / or Pagan Gnosticism prior to Christian Gnosticism: see Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 1-8. 105 These texts are The Apocalypse of Adam, V, 5; 78.27-79.19; The Second Trea-Use of the Great Seth, VII, 2: 63.4-17; The Testimony of Truth, IX,3: 69.31-70.30. S. Giversen (\"Solomon und die Dämonen,\" in M. Krause (ed.), Essays on the Nag Hammadi Texts in Honor of Alexander Bohlig [NHS 3; Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1972], 16-21) has studied all the passages that involve Solomon and the demons and has noted that the figure of the king presented is clearly condemnatory.

Although two of these passages do not mention Solomon or have an interest in him, they share a set of traditions that we have seen linked to the king in other works and that appear again in the third text as directly related to Solomon. In the first text, which forms part of a description of creation, we find an allusion to the seven forces of Chaos: Seven appeared in Chaos, androgynous. They have their masculine names and their feminine names. The feminine name is Pronoia (Fore-thought) Sambathas, which is \"week.\" And his son is called Yao: his feminine name is Lordship. Sabaoth: his feminine name is Deity. Adonaios: his feminine name is Kingship. Eloaios: his feminine name is Jealousy. Oraios: his feminine name is Wealth. And Astaphaios: his feminine name is Sophia (Wisdom). These are the seven forces of the seven heavens of chaos. And they were born androgynous...108 It is very likely that we have here a transformation of the seven astrological planets into seven primary powers; one of them, Sam-bathas, indicates that the original tradition was structured around the division of the week according to the seven planets, which re-calls for us the interest of the Hygromanteia in such questions.109 The mixture of Jewish names and nomina barbara reminds us both of the Greek Magical Papyri and of the Hygromanteia; besides, the androg-ynous character of these seven forces, which is important here as a Gnostic tenet, reminds us of the importance that an androgynous demon has in several exorcisms linked to Solomon and in the Hy-gromanteia}10 The fact that Solomon does not appear in the passage does not lessen its value for us, since it proves the antiquity of such traditions, their composite character and their capacity for adapta-tion into different narrative, ideological and religious frameworks. Thus we can see the very same tradition, reinterpreted and connected 108 On the Origin of the World II, 5; 101.25-102.5.

The second Adam is soul-endowed (psychikos), and appeared on the sixth day, which is called Aphrodite.

And these are the names of the females ones: Wrath, Pain, Lust, Sighing, Curse, Bitterness, Quarrelsomeness. They had intercourse with one another, and each begot seven so that they total forty-nine an-drogynous demons. Their names and their functions you will find in the \"Book of Solo-mon\".111 In this text, the seven forces are transformed into androgynous demons; their names constitute a sort of catalogue that is very sim-ilar to the one we find in Testament of Solomon 8 (see below), with which it coincides in respect of the demon called \"quarrelsomeness\" (=Greek ερίς). Again we have an explicit reference to forty-nine androgynous demons whose function, we are told, can be found in a \"Book of Solomon.\" Thus, it is quite evident that we have here the same mixture of astrological and demonological material that we find in the other texts studied; the astrological content has certainly been played down, but it is there nonetheless. Besides, the text seems to refer directly to a work that had to be very similar to the Testament of Solomon. In consequence, it is likely that these Gnostic texts also share the traditions connecting Solomon with astrology, as a logical development of his still earlier connection with demonology.112 1,1 On the Origin of the World{MDBI, II, 5: 106.27-107.3.

Now, when the seven rulers were cast down from their heavens onto the earth, they made for them-selves angels, numerous, demonic, to serve them. And the latter instructed man-kind in many kinds of errors and magic and potions and worship of idols and spilling of blood and altars and temples and sacrifices and libations to all the spirits of the earth, having their coworker fate, who came into existence by the concord between the gods of injustice and justice.\" The terms in which it describes the rulers remind us strongly of 1 Enoch 7-8."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"SOLOMON THE ASTROLOGER IN THE SELENODROMION OF DAVID AND SOLOMON We have seen how the astrological material was already linked at an early date (second or third century CE at least) with the tradi-tions relating to Solomon and how the relationship between demon-ology and the king acted as kernel and trigger for the mingling of both traditions. Now, it is quite likely that at a certain point the astrological traditions \"freed\" themselves from that association and were linked directly to Solomon, who was then depicted as an as-trologer. Perhaps such a change may lie behind the Selenodromion of David the Prophet and his Son Solomon. This work fits the astrological genre called lunarìum, which enjoyed considerable popularity in Late Antiquity and afterwards according to the several examples we have found in different manuscripts.113 The genre οï lunarium or selenodro-mion (predictions based on the course of the moon) has a rather long history, since it shows a progressive development: in the earliest and simplest form, the different days of the lunar month were noted and it was stated for what each day was good or bad. Some of the asso-ciations between a particular day and a determined action go back to Hesiod's Works and Days (700 BCE), where some days are linked with the birth of different gods or mythological figures.114 The prin-ciple at work in the genre was the same as that of the sympathy among different realms of the cosmos, although here we have a sympathy among the birth of a particular figure, a day of the month and the actions that could be performed on such a day. The work entitled Selenodromion of David the Prophet and his Son So-lomon is representative of this genre, except for one detail: almost every reference to pagan gods is replaced by references to the birth of biblical figures or to biblical situations.\"' The biblical references range from Genesis to Samuel, and with it, the work has been con-sciously and totally Judaized. There is nothing specifically Christian n i See Delatte, CCAG X, 121, for a list of the manuscripts that contain tuna-ria, attributed to different figures such as Aristotle (CCAG VIII, 3, I 7), Esdras (CCAG VIII, 3, 88, Cod. Athen, 26), Melampodus (CCAG VIII, 4, 9). 114 See F. Cumont, \"Les Présages lunaires de Virgile,\" L'Antiquité classique II (1933), 259-270; Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, 2.233-5^. 115 However, we observe the pagan origin of the text in day seven where the Greek god Apollo appears together with a mention of the killing of Abel by his brother Cain."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"in the genre of the lunaria in general or in this lunarium. So it is quite probable that the lunaria with Old Testament adaptations were produced by Jews in a syncretistic Jewish setting.1 \"י Besides this fact, our Selenodromion shows clearly how astrology was linked with So-lomon, to the point that the \"pretext\" of the demonological tradi-tions has been dropped and the very name of the wise king and his father provides enough support for the pseudepigraphical attribu-tion. Another detail strengthens the ascription of the work to King Solomon and his father David: the list of the days and the biblical figures and events related to them ends with the mention of Sam-uel the Prophet, so that the historical fiction is respected. This pro-cedure of pseudepigraphical attribution seems to denote more careful planning than the apparent simplicity of the structure suggests. The structure of the Selenodromion is indeed simple. Each day of the month is linked with a biblical episode or personality, although the author did not follow a strict sequence regarding genealogy or succession of events; however, the text provides detailed informa-tion of a miscellaneous nature, as we can see in the following ex-ample: Day seven. On the same day Abel was killed by his brother Cain and Apollo was born. The same day is good for sowing, harvest, reaping medicinal plants and making petitions, for interceding for any one, for cutting off one's hair in mourning. The one born will be dexterous in the skills, wise and strong; he is short-lived, excellent in selling and buying; he will have a sign on his right foot. It if it is female, she will be a mid-wife. The fugitive will be saved, the sick dies quickly.117 Every day follows grosso modo the pattern provided for the example: 1. biblical reference; 2. good and bad action for that day; 3. char-acteristics of those born on the day, distinguished according to sex; 4. repeated mentions of fugitives, slaves or sick persons; 5. on occa-116 Goodenough, Jewish Symbols, 2.235. 117 Delatte, CCAG X, p.'123, f. 22v: Ήμερα ζ'· έν αύτη τη ήμέρςι \"Αβελ έφονεύθη ύπό τοΰ αδελφού αύτοΰ Κάιν και 'ο 'Απόλλων έγγενήθη. αύτη ημέρα καλή σπέρνειν, θερίζειν, βότανα ιατρικά σωρεύειν καί έντεύξεις ποιεΐν, πρόσωπα έντυγχάνειν, κείρειν κεφαλήν, ό γεννηθείς έσται πάντεχνος, σοφός καί ισχυρός׳ έστιν δέ όλιγοχρόνιος, εις τό πωλεΐν καί άγοράζειν δόκιμος״ σημεΐον έξει έν τω ποδί τω δεξιω׳ εί δέ θηλύ, έσται ίατρινά. ό φυγών σωθήσεται. ό άσθενών ταχέως τελευτφ.

The importance of the right time is stressed in both texts and recalls the description of Solomon in Wisdom 7:18-19; again the \"Hermetic\" background is at work here. One wonders if the authors of these works reinterpreted the Greek text of Qoh 3:1-8 as an astrological key, so that the appropiate wise moment (καιρός) of the biblical text was transformed into an astrological concept. Other possible parallels are provided by two pseudepigraphical works, the Treatise of Shem (first century BCE?) and the Revelations of Ezra (prior to ninth century CE?), which have some points in common with our text.119 Both works belong to the astrological genre of the calendolo-gia, which describe the year according to the day of the week on which that year began; several natural conditions (weather, harvest...) are foretold. Both texts are attributed to biblical figures and their astrological contents confirm the influence and importance of astrol-ogy in Jewish settings. The Selenodromion constitutes a clear example of the Judaizing of a genre that at the beginning was alien to the Jewish spirit.120 However, this is not so important as the fact that this work was attributed to Solomon and that this attribution was effected by the inclusion of Solomon's name at the beginning and end of the work. This could mean that the linking of Solomon with astrology was so accepted among some Jewish circles that it was sometimes neces-sary to develop pseudopigraphical fictions as complex as the one we 118 Evidently, the fifth point is absent from the example; see Appendix 3, for other days in which it does appear. 119 About this works see Charlesworth, The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, I: 473-486; 601-604. 120 As Cumont (\"Les présages lunaires de Virgile,\" 264) clearly states: \"Con-sidérons d'abord les indications tirées de l'Écriture qui ont pris la place des na-tivités païennes. Leur caractère artificiel et livresque saute aux yeux; c'est une construction arbitraire d'un érudit de cabinet. Les naissances des patriarques et autres événements mémorables de la Génese et de VExode s'y succèdent conformé-ment à la chronologie biblique et le mois offre ainsi, comme par miracle, dans ce trente jours un raccourci de l'histoire des Hébreux depuis Adam jusqu'à Samuel. D'autre part, ni dans ces premiers mots des trente paragraphes, ni dans les présages qui suivent, ne se recontre aucune allusion à l'Evangile ou à l'Eglise. Ce type de selenodromia bibliques doit avoir été créé par un Juif qui a voulu rendre accepta-bles les almanachs des Grecs à ses correligionnaires enclins à la superstition mais hostiles au paganisme, et si, comme nous le croyons, les selenodromia mythologiques ont été constitués en Egypte, ce Juif était probablement alexandrin.\""},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"find, for example, in the Hygromanteia of Solomon. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to think that this association was made at an early date in Jewish settings that were in close contact with an environment where such beliefs were widespread, such as Hellenistic Egypt of the first centuries of the common era. CONCLUSIONS From the preceding pages, it is clear that the astrological typology of King Solomon was more widespread and popular than we might at first have thought. The connecting of Solomon with astrological material took place at an early date (second or third century CE at least) and was based on traditional lore about Solomon and his portrayal as an exorcist. In the first stage, the different astrological entities, such as the signs of the Zodiac or the seven planets, were transformed into demons and subsumed within the demonology that was related to Solomon in works such as the Testament of Solomon; already then, it is evident that an astrologization of the material was taking place using such procedures as the distribution of the differ-ent demons among the signs of the Zodiac. In a second stage (Hy-gromanteia), the astrologization of the figure of Solomon is clear, al-though the basis of the demonology still operates in the arrangement of the days of the week and in the list of demons and angels who rule over each hour. Details such as the ordering of the days of the weeks and the careful pseudepigraphical fiction point to Jewish tra-ditions. At a later stage, large blocks of purely magical material were included in the Hygromanteia and were adapted into the pseudepi-graphical framework; the magical techniques described have many points in common with the procedures that appear in the Magical Papyri. The development of the astrological tradition we have just out-lined was progressive and, besides, it did not exclude the transfor-mation of the very same astrological material, creating new devel-opments and adaptations. Texts such as the Ginza, the Syriac Zosimus, and the Gnostic tractate On the Origin of the World show how such reworkings were made. The ubiquitous presence of Solomon in these texts is clear evidence of the popularity of the traditions being studied; Jewish, Christian, Gnostic and Hermetic writings accepted them in very different forms and, most importantly, at very differ-ent moments: it is likely that the original traditions went back to the"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"first centuries of the common era and that they were reworked sev-eral times until some of them reached the present stage at the be-ginning of the Middle Ages. There was even further development of the figure of Solomon as astrologer in the Middle Ages; the numerous astrological manu-scripts that preserve mediaeval writings attributed to Solomon or that repeatedly mention Solomon in connection with astrology prove as much."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE SOLOMON THE MAGICIAN INTRODUCTION In previous pages we have seen how Solomon was depicted as an astrologer and how he was connected with astrology from quite early times (at least from the second century CE on) in different texts and traditions. This characterization as astrologer does not seem to derive from Solomon as he appears in the biblical texts, except in a very indirect manner. Rather it seems that we have here a Jewish tradi-tion that took the Bible as basis, making use of several astrological traditions that were quite common in the Graeco-Roman world of Late Antiquity. In the same way, the magical traditions that were ascribed to Solomon, as well as his characterization as magician, which became so popular in Late Antiquity among Jews and Chris-tians alike, have very little to do with the \"biblical Solomon.\" As we shall see, we have here a relatively late development of the ex-orcistic and hermetic traditions that were applied to the ideal fig-ure of King Solomon and that went beyond the characterization of the king as Hellenistic monarch, which probably was the basis for the new developments. This characterization of Solomon as magician owes much to the magical traditions and techniques that were quite widespread in the Graeco-Roman world among Jewish, Christian and pagan people alike. Thus, it is quite syncretistic by nature and it is somewhat difficult to distinguish between what appears to be Jewish treatment of the character and any other material of non-Jewish origin that was absorbed into this new portrayal of Solomon. In consequence, at this particular stage of our study, we will have to be particularly careful in the way we address the different texts to evaluate precise-ly the possible source of the various materials and their final incor-poration into the texts where Solomon is depicted as a magician.1 1 On magic in Late Antiquity studied from different points of view see J. Goldin, \"The Magic of Magic and Superstition,יי in Aspects of Religious Propaganda in Judaism and Early Christianity, ed. E. Schüssler Fiorenza (University of Notre Dame Center"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"We have just noted above that quite probably the basis for this new magical characterization of Solomon emerged from his earlier characterization as a great exorcist, which, as we have seen already, arose at an early date (first century CE) in a clearly Jewish setting, although it was later enriched with syncretistic-Hellenistic traits. However, there is a trait that pertains exclusively to the Jewish background of the new magical characterization of Solomon: So-lomon, like Moses and Abraham, besides being described as a magician, shares the status of leader of the Jewish people. Howev-er, this leadership trait is not combined with magical power in the other figures that were considered great magicians in Late Antiqui-ty (Dardanos, Simon Magus, etc.).2 Apart from Abraham and Moses, Solomon is portrayed as king and magician, in a way that is not supported by Hellenistic theories concerning the character of the monarchy and the endowment of kings with numinous (divine) power. This combination, then, of worldly power over people, and esoteric or magical power over demons, seems to be Jewish; perhaps, indeed, it is the most clearly Jewish characteristic of the traditions connect-ed with Solomon that the king is endowed with a magical persona. A word must be said about what may appear to be a somewhat artificial division into different types, according to which we have classified the different portraits of Solomon, especially with regard to the types of exorcist and magician. It seems rather difficult to distinguish between these, since they respond to very similar settings and the texts in which they appear share several characteristics, such for the Study of Judaism and Christianity in Antiquity 2; Notre Dame / London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1976), 115-147; H.

Although this division is clearly artificial in terms of the sources, it is not casual or trivial; it is based on the fact that there is a clear progression in the role played direcdy or indirecdy by Solomon with regard to the results of the magical techniques. The Solomonic types described and stud-ied in the second part of the present work oscillate between the passive and the active in respect of the actual aims of the techniques outlined in the texts. All the texts, and the images of Solomon they present, share to a greater or lesser extent the conception of a spe-cial knowledge that gives the king power and dominion over a su-pernatural reality, which by means of universal sympathy (the rela-tionship between each and every element of the cosmos), is connected with this mundane reality. However, the Solomon depicted as ex-orcist, Hermetic sage and so on uses that knowledge in a passive manner, that is, with no intention of changing reality by subduing the forces submitted to the power that this special knowledge awards to its depositary; conversely, when Solomon is depicted as magician this knowledge is used and portrayed in an active manner, so that it enables dominion over supernatural realities and, accordingly, changes of the present world. This dichotomy is quite clear in three different stages: exorcist, astrologer, and magician; each of these types participates somehow in the same material but the factor of passivity / activity works differently in each of them. The Solomon who is linked with exor-cism has power over demons only with the aim of subduing and expelling them; it is a less active use of knowledge and its power because reality is only slightly changed; it returns to a previous stage that has been disturbed and transformed by the demonic possession. The Solomon who is linked with astrology is more \"active,\" since the knowledge and power that function in the supernatural world by menas of \"sympathy\" transform it; it represents a middle stage, since this transformation comes indirectly from knowledge. Finally, the Solomon who is linked with magic is most \"active,\" since his knowledge and power over the supernatural world effect changes in the reality of this world. Thus, it seems clear that the different types according to which the figure of Solomon has been classified and analyzed are justified, since each of them represents a different di-alogue between the supernatural world and the real world. From what has been said above, it is clear that exorcism, astrol-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"ogy and magic share many traits and interests; this is evident when studying the magical traditions of Late Antiquity. However, Jewish handling of those traditions displays some peculiarities that seem to derive from a clearly Jewish background and have consequences different from those found in non-Jewish texts: the Jewish magical and mystical traditions with an interest in demonology, angelology and the sacred names, whether of God, angels or demons, are a down-to-earth version of trends that also existed in apocalyptic texts. Whereas apocalyptic material deals with the problems posed by existence, in the future or within the future facts of history, the magician deals with them in the present, desiring power and con-trol over fate in the present age.3 For both, human life is bounded by a supernatural world of angels and demons but the magician does not worry about the inevitability of a final judgment; that is, mag-ical tradition seems to care little about eschatology. The mystical text seeks to transcend time and place in order to attain contemplation of the divine, oblivious of this-worldly history. Therefore, the same ideological background evolves in three stages, each step being more other-worldly than the previous; magic is the popular and worldly trend, mysticism, the spiritual, apocalypticism lying in being between these two. From ancient times these magical traditions were nurtured mainly in a \"popular\" environment; perhaps because of that we have few-er glimpses of Solomon as magician in textual traditions, which would naturally represent a more intellectualized environment. Therefore, the magical characterization of Solomon was either unrecorded or disdained during the first two centuries CE. However, the strength of this magical tradition appears in the fact that several texts evi-dence some features of it. Thus, 11 QPsApa, Wisdom of Solomon, Bib-lical Antiquities of Pseudo-Philo, and Josephus' Jewish Antiquities all bear witness to the underground existence of exorcistic traditions by the first century CE, traditions that share many characteristics with the purely magical texts that would appear at a later time.4 3 On the problem of fate and the various responses to it in Late Antiquity see E. R. Dodds, Pagans and Christians in an Age of Anxiety (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni-versity Press, 1969). 4 Despite the rather casual manner that has been used above when speaking about the magicial traditions linked to Solomon, the following caveat made by J. Gager has been taken into account: \"...the use of the term \"magic\" tells us little or nothing about the substance of what is under description. The sentence, \"X is/ was a magician!\" tells us nothing about the beliefs and practices of X; the only"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"A parallel phenomenon is apparent in the pagan milieu. Interest in magic and demonology is relatively rare in most literary works during the first two centuries, but as the third century progresses, this interest appears in both literary works and philosophical prac-tices (theurgy). Many of the same practices that we find in pagan literature are also attested in Jewish sources. There is clear interde-pendence between magical and mystical techniques.5 On this basis, the successful image of Solomon as magician and exorcist owes much to the portrayals of some pagan philosophers who, from the third century on, were acquiring the features of miracle workers and magicians. The point of departure in both cases was their charac-terization as wise men, being added to Solomon as king, philoso-pher, Hermetic sage, exorcist and, finally, magician. Therefore, the evolution attested in the Life of Apollonius by Philostratus and in the Lives of the Sophists and Philosophers by Eunapius, with the addition of thaumaturgie elements, can be transplanted to Solomon who offi-daily took his place in the Hellenistic world as one of the great wise teachers of secret knowledge at a relatively late date, perhaps dur-solid information that can be derived from it concerns the speaker's attitude to-wards X and their relative social relationship—that X is viewed by the speaker as powerful, peripheral, and dangerous. Thus the only justifiable (answerable) his-torical question about magic is not \"What are the characteristics of, for example, Greek magic?\" but rather \"Under what conditions, by whom, and of whom does the term magic come to be used?\" (J. Gager [ed.], Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World [New York / Oxford: Oxford University Press], 25; emphasis mine). The sociological approach of Gager, even if somewhat extreme and reductionist, is very useful in the study of what is called magic; although Solomon is nowhere called magician, he is depicted as an extremely powerful one. Thus we will try to answer some of Gager's questions, while, at the same time, we look into the techniques our texts describe. Finally, we use the noun \"magic\" and the adjective \"magical\" for texts and techniques that deal with power and with the results and inner working of such power. In the same way, we have used the pair \"popular\" / \"cult\" ambience(s) for the sake of clarity and convenience; nevertheless we are well aware that such oppositions should not be carried too far. 5 On this aspect in Hekhalot literature see P. Schäfer, \"The Aim and Purpose of Early Jewish Mysticism,\" in idem, Hekhalot-Studien, 279-295, especially p. 290 on the aim of early Jewish mysticism: \"... A first conclusion, I think, is apparent. In regard to the heavenly journey, and especially in regard to the adjuration, the concern is with a direct and unobstructed contact with God or with his angel. God can be reached directly, fast and without detours. In both cases, the means of achieving this is magic. The world view which informs these texts is thus one which is deeply magical. The authors of the Hekhalot literature believed in the power of magic and attempted to integrate magic into Judaism. The central elements of Jewish life—worship and the study of the Torah—are determined, in these mys-tics' understanding of the world, by the power of magic.\""},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"ing or after the third century CE. Consequently, this process should be viewed as heavily indebted to the dialogue established between Jewish tradition and pagan practices on one side, and the adaptation of popular customs by the cultivated social classes on the other. To a certain extent, the new magical characterization that emerges is almost of a new figure that has very little to do with the biblical point of departure or the early exorcistic traditions that were linked to the king. As we shall see, the image of Solomon as magician is the least typically Jewish of all the portrayals we have studied so far, since it is made into a vehicle for a series of magical teachings and techniques that were common to magical praxis in Late Antiquity. In fact, rabbinic literature shows a clear tendency to \"folklorize\" the magical traditions related to Solomon, so that they become mere folk-tales and lose the practi-cal character they have in the Greek texts to be studied.() We shall examine several texts to show the development of the magical traditions linked to the wise king. The introduction to the magical handbook Sefer ha-Razim will be taken into account; in it, Solomon is described as the repository of a magical chain of tradi-tion going back to Noah that has a lot in common with the tech-niques described in the magical treatise included in the Hygromante-ia, which, according to the ascription of the work, is attributed to Solomon. We shall also study the magical treatise included in the Hygromanteia; we shall see how this magical material is linked with the other magical texts attributed to Solomon and with the magical techniques that appear in them. In the same way, a Greek magical papyrus (PGM 850-929), in which a technique called \"Solomon's collapse\" is described, will be considered; in this technique the use of a boy as a medium recalls texts such as the Testament of Solomon and the Hygromanteia where the use of a boy as a medium also oc-curs. 6 A cursory reading of the compilation of Rabbinic material by L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 4.125-176; 6.277-302, makes the phenomenon clear; per-haps there is an exception in 6.287, where a magical technique involving the use of a sword is quoted, which seems to parallel the frequent use of swords in the magical treatise of the Hygromanteia."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"SOLOMON THE MAGICIAN IN SEPHER HA-RAZIM a. Introduction What have been called magic and magical practices were as popu-lar in the Judaism of Late Antiquity as they were among the other peoples and cultures of the same period. Their applications and uses were truly manifold; love, business, war, hate, health: any aspect, whether high or low, of human life could be confronted by means of magic. Therefore, magic and magicians pervade every sphere of life; they do so because they were viewed as effective or, at least, they seemed to be effective, as the persistence of the same techniques, incantations and charms through Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and even the early modern period clearly witnesses. Jewish magic is clearly located within this ambiance and shares quite a few traits with regard to actual magical techniques, formulae and texts. There has been considerable advance, recently, in the study of Jewish magic. Besides the work of Blau, which is still useful, and the texts edited by Gaster,' new studies and editions of texts have been produced and have shed new light on this aspect of Judaism, which had to some extent been neglected.8 It is precisely within this new interest in Jewish magic that the work Sepher ha-Razim (The Book of the Mysteries) has to be understood.9 The text we posses is an eclectic one, to a certain extent made up by its editor, Margaliot, from different manuscripts and also from 7 Blau, Das altjüdische Zauberwesen·, M. Gaster, \"The Sword of Moses,\" in Stud-ies and Texts in Folklore, 1.288-337 (English Translation); 3.69-94 (Hebrew text). 8 On the status questionis see Alexander, \"Incantations and Books of Magic,\" in Schiirer, A History of the Jewish People, 3/1.342-379; see also Schäfer, \"Jewish Magic Literature,\" 74-91; for editions of texts see, Naveh and Shaked, Amulets and Magic Bowls, passim׳, idem, Magic Spells and Formulae, passim; Schiffman and Swartz, Hebrew and Aramaic Incantation Texts, especially 11-61; Schäfer and Shaked, Magische Texte, passim; for an analysis of some aspects of the Genizah texts see M.

Each part describes a series of angels, their function, their \"practical applica-tions,\" invocations and techniques to accomplish them.12 Many of the incantations have similarities with some of the formulae that we can find in the PGM and in Greek texts linked with Solomon, such as the magical treatise included in the Hygromanteia of Solomon. It is noteworthy that both in the Hygromanteia of Solomon and in the Sepher ha-Razim the names of the angels and their description was of primary importance. In the Sepher ha-Razim the description either of the angels or of their power has a clear role in the practical spells that are recorded afterwards. They work by linking both parts of the incantations, in a manner similar to the way in which the ange-lology of the Hygromanteia links the astrological material with mag-ical praxis. Equally, the coincidence of the spellings of the angels' names with the ones found in the PGM seems to support the exist-ence of a continuum of magical praxis and beliefs throughout Late Antiquity.15 It seems, then, that two types of material can be clearly distinct in this text: the first one is formed by a sort of cosmological frame-work that seems to have certain points of contact with Hekhalot lit-10 Again we face the same difficulties that we already mentioned in Ch. 9, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\" P. Schäfer (\"Tradition and Redaction,\" 15-16) warns us about artificially establishing texts and works; although his caveat principally concern Hekhalot literature, and is perhaps too extreme, it could be applied to the study of magic in general and to Sefer Ha-Razim in particular. '1 So Margalioth, Sepher ha-Razim, 24; Gruenwald (Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 226) dates it around the sixth or seventh century C.E.; due to the eclectic and, to a certain extent, artificial character of Margalioth's text, any attempt to date the book on internal grounds should be very cautious (so Morgan, Sepher Ha-Razim, 10). 12 For a study of the form and style of the incantations included in the work see J. H. Niggemeyer, Beschwörungsformeln aus dem Buch der Geheimnisse (Hildesheim / New York: Georg Olms Verlag, 1975) [non vidi], The section concerning the seventh heaven does not contain magical material but is a description of God sitting on his throne of glory. 13 Besides, the fact that both the Hygromanteia of Solomon and the Sepher ha-Razim (see Margalioth, Sepher ha-Razim, 42, and Heeg, CCAG VIII/2, 140) entered Eu-rope through Southern Italy in the sixth (Hygromanteia) or eighth (Sepher ha-Razim) century CE could mean that many magical traditions were preserved in Byzan-tine lands, unchanged, well into the Middle Ages."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"erature. The second consists mainly of magical techniques only loose-ly linked with the first type of material; the main interest of the editors of the book was precisely this magical material.'4 Besides the seven firmaments, the work has another differentiat-ed part that consists of a sort of general introduction (פתיחה); it is a kind of catalogue of all the secret knowledge that is found in the book. It is precisely in this \"introduction\" that Solomon occurs at a certain point; consequently, we will study it in the following pages, locating it within the general development of the magical traditions linked with Solomon. b. Solomon the Magician in the \"Introduction (ΠΠΤΞ)\" to the Sepher ha-Razim Despite the great importance of the Sepher ha-Razim for the study of Jewish magic, we are interested in it mainly because Solomon is mentioned once in the text. As we have said, he appears in the \"introduction\" (פתיחה), just at its end; however we shall analyze the whole introduction in order to demonstrate the importance of this brief mention. Margalioth made his edition of this part of the text from several manuscripts.15 This introduction (פתיחה) functions as a kind of catalogue that anticipates the contents of the whole book, listing all the things that can been achieved through magic. The introduction begins as follows: This is a book, from the Books of the Mysteries, which was given to Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son ofjared, the son of Mahallalel, the son of Kenan, the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, by Raziel the angel in the year when he came into the ark (but) before his entrance.\"' 14 Morgan, Sepher ha-Razim, p. 8-9; Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mys-ticism, 225-234. A very similar composition can be discerned in the Hygromanteia of Solomon׳, thus, there is a clear distinction between the astrological part, which functions as a sort of introduction, and the magical praxis recorded afterwards, which has many astrological features. 15 Oxford MS. Heb. C. 18/30, which includes the introduction and a part of the first heaven (1:6); Adler JTSL ENA 2750, pp. 4-5, which includes the intro-duction as well; Margalioth also used the Sepher Raziel (Amsterdam: 1701) to com-plete lacunae and to correct some readings. 16 זה עפר מספרי הרזים שנתן לנוח בן למך בן מתושלח בן חנוך בן ירד בן מהללאל בן קינן בן אנוש בן שת בן אדם, מפי רז־אל המלאך בשנת ביאתו לתבה,Margalioth( לפני כניעתו Sepher ha-Razim, 65). For the present translation see Morgan, Sepher ha-Razim, 17."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"According to this text, the Sepher ha-Razim is only one of several books that logically we can suppose contained the same kind of knowledge. Besides, Noah is the recipient of a book that is given him by the angel Raziel, in a way that reminds us of Solomon and the seal being delivered at the hands of the archangel Michael (Test.Sol 1:5-7). It is probable that the origin of the tradition linking Noah with a book of secret lore may be found in Jub. 10:12-14: And the healing of all their illnesses together with their seductions we told Noah so that he might heal by means of herbs of the earth. (13) And Noah wrote everything in a book just as we taught him accord-ing to every kind of healing. And the Evil spirits were restrained from following the sons of Noah. (14) And he gave everything he wrote to Shem, his oldest son, because he loved him much more than all of his sons.17 The text of Jubilees is found in a context (Jub. 10:1-11) where the demons are subdued and where the angels teach Noah how to heal the illnesses produced by the demons. There are evident parallels in the formulation of the tradition about Solomon and Noah and their connection with secret knowledge and universal wisdom.18 Besides, both the beginning of the Sepher ha-Razim and of the Testa-ment of Solomon comply with what seems to be a universal character-istic of magic: magic is always linked with tradition and is never original, but rather has existed from the beginning of time.19 17 English translation by O. S. Wintermute in Charlesworth (ed.), The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, 2:76. 18 The Qumran Aramaic text 4QE1ect of God (4Q534 [4QMess ar]), which seems to refer to the birth of Noah, could reflect a very similar tradition. On this text see Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, 185; see also J. A. Fitzmyer, \"The Aramaic 'Elect of God' Text from Qumran,\" CBQTÌ (1965) 348-372; for an English translation, see Garcia Martinez, The Dead Sea Scrolls Translated, 263. 19 So B. Malinowski, Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays (repr. from 1948 ed.; Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984), 74-75: \"Tradition, which, as we have several times insisted, reigns supreme in primitive civilization, gathers in great abundance around magical ritual and cult. In the case of any important magic we invariably find the story accounting for its existence. Such a story tells when and where it entered the possession of man, how it became the property of a local group or of a familia or clan. But such a story is not the story of its origins. Magic never \"originated,\" it never has been made or invented. All magic simply \"was\" from the beginning [...] In higher societies magic is often derived from spirits and demons but even these, as a rule, originally received and did not invent it. Thus the belief in the primaeval natural existence of magic is universal.\" Although it is evident that some of the ideas of Malinoswki are outdated, the concepts about tradition and \"eternal\" existence of magic surprisingly still fit perfectly into the scenery drawn by our texts. Neither Solomon nor Noah are the inventors of magic, only its depositaries."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The introduction continues by describing the catalogue of knowl-edge that Noah learned from the Book of Secrets: And [Noah] inscribed it upon a sapphire stone very distinctly.

That is, the knowledge of the book that has been given to Noah coincides with the astrological knowl-edge given by Solomon to his son Rehoboam in the Hygromanteia. Thus, we read in the Hygromanteia how Solomon warns his son about the need \"to master the observation of the planets and of the Zodi-ac signs\" and \"to know the positions of the seven planets, because the seven planets lead the seven days of the week.\"21 Evidently, both texts describe very similar types of knowledge. Furthermore, if we recall the importance that is attached in the Hygromanteia to the knowledge of the names of the various demons and angels who rule over every hour of each day of the week and the insistence on know-ing the right moment to perform different actions or accomplish different things, it is clear that both Solomon and Noah are made repositories of the same type of knowledge. Besides, the order of the different secret sciences that appear in the introduction to the Sepher ha-Razim is very similar, grosso modo, to the order that the Hygromanteia follows when Solomon describes them to his son Rehoboam. Con-sequently, both texts seem to attribute almost the same traditions to two different figures that have very little to do with one other, since Noah is a figure of a legendary antediluvian and \"pre-Jewish\" past whereas Solomon fits more easily into what could be called \"Jewish\" history. However, as we shall see, it is likely that a great deal of the knowledge that our text ascribes to Noah was first at-tributed to Solomon and only afterwards, and secondarily, to Noah. There are some details that seem to support this transference: on the one hand, our text includes what seem to be echoes of biblical passages that are ascribed to Solomon. These echoes are introduced by the Hebrew •תות ורגעיילחקור ע translated by Morgan as \"to search out (the right) seasons and moments;\" by translating the Hebrew עת as \"season,\" Morgan has obstructed its true relationship to the introduction of the disciplines that follow. It is quite likely that here עת does not mean \"season\" or even \"time\" in general but rather a very particular unit of time, namely, the \"time of twenty-four as-21 See Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer;\" the texts quoted are found at the beginning of the Hygromanteia; for the complete translation see Appendix 1."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"tronomical hours,\"22 or it may even denote the individual parts (hours) of a day. If so, the passage would refer to the exact hour when each procedure or technique has to be performed in order to be ef-fective. What, then, could be defined as \"free quotations\" of Qoh 3:2,3 (\"the time to give birth and the time to die, the time to strike )״עת ללרת ועת למות עת למכה ועת לרפואה ;and the time to healand of 1 Kings 3:9 (\"to understand the evil and the good; להבין הרוע והטוב\") are logically linked through the introduction and re-interpreted in astrological and magical terms.25 This reinterpreta-tion again recalls the Hygromanteia of Solomon and its detailed list of the suitable hours to perform different procedures. The fact that these biblical allusions of Sepher ha-Razim refer to texts that were linked to Solomon cannot be due to mere chance. In the same way, part of the knowledge that Sepher ha-Razim gives to Noah, the dominion over demons and the ability \"to watch the four winds of the earth\" (להביט בארבע רוחות הארץ), is also linked with Solomon, both in the Testament and in other texts that refer to dominion over demons, as in the magical part of the Hygromanteia.2 ' Perhaps this passage of the Sepher ha-Razim understands these \"winds\" (רוחות) as spirits, that is as demons, as well. If in the first part of the introduction there is no actual link be-tween the biblical figure of Noah and the knowledge contained in the book, this relationship is established in the second part, although in a surprising manner, as we can see: And from the wisdom of the secrets of this book, Noah learned and understood how to make gopher wood into an ark and to hide from the torrent of the flood waters, to bring (the animals) with him two by two and seven by seven, to take in some of every kind of food and every kind of provender. And he placed (the book) in a golden cabi-net and brought it first into the ark, to learn from it the times of the day and to investigate from it the times of the night, and in which period he should arise to pour out entreaties. And when he came forth from the ark, he used (the book) all the days of his life, and at the time of his death he handed it down to Abraham, and Abraham to Isaac, and Isaac to Jacob, and Jacob to Levi, and Levi to Kohath, and Kohath 22 See Jastrow, Dictionaiy, 1128. 23 Cf. Qohelet 1 Kgs and )עת ללדת ועת למות ]...[ עת להרוג ועת לריפוא( 3 ,3:2 .)להבין בין טוב לרע( 3:924 In the Hygromanteia (Harleianus 5596\\ Delatte, Anecdota, 426-428) there is a complex demonological invocation to several groups of demons, who are divided according to the winds of the South, North, East and West."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"to Amram, and Amram to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the sages and thus generation by generation until Solomon the King arose.

For many books were handed down to him, but this one was found more precious and more honorable and more difficult than any of them.25 This text contains three different blocks of material; each part de-velops a different tradition and focuses on a specific point. The first part is completely devoted to Noah; in fact, it is the first time in the introduction that the Noah who appears in the text is explicitly and directly related with some aspect of the biblical Noah. However, even then, the introduction is chiefly concerned with the secret lore of the book from which Noah took the procedures to follow when preparing the ark for the flood. We have seen how Jubilees mentions a tradition about a book of remedies against the illnesses caused by demons, but the present text goes much further, leaving aside the role played by God and, to a certain extent, giving greater promi-nence to Noah and to Sepher ha-Razim. However, this part finishes by mentioning again how Noah learned the appropriate times (ΣΤΠΤ) of the day and the night, which again can be directly related to the Hygromanteia of Solomon and its developed chronology of appropriate times. In this part of the introduction the transformation of biblical traditions works again as a device that introduces to the traditions about the appropriate times.2() The second part of the above text comprises a very special \"chain of tradition,\" similar to the one we find in Pirke Avoth 1:1; it seems quite likely that it has suffered some kind of edition and/or inter-25ף מטט מחכמת רזי הספר הזה למר נח והשכיל לעטות עצי נופר תבה להיסתר מי מבול להביא עמו שנים שנים ושבעה וטבעה ולהכניס מכל אכל ומכל מאכל. ויתנהו בארון זהב ויבאהו תחילה לתבה לידע ממנו עיתות יום ולחקור ממנו עיתות לילה וב־אזו עונה יעמוד להפיל שוועה: וכיצאו מן התבה בו היה משתמש כל ימי חייו ובעת מותו מסר לאברהם ואברהם ליצחק ויצחק ליעקב ויעקב ללוי ולוי לקהת וקהת לעמרם ועמרם למשה ומשה ליהושע ויהושע לזקנים וזקנים לנביאים ונביאים לחכמים וכן לדור ודור עד שעמד שלמה המלך ונעלו לו ספרי הרזים והשכיל למאד בספרי בינה ומשל בכל חפצו בכל הרוחות והפגעים המשוטטים בעולם ואסר והתיר ושלח והביא ובנה והצליח מחוכמת הספר הזה, כי הרבה ספרים נמסרו בידו וזה נמצא יקר ונכבה וקשה מכולם.26 On the twenty-four hours and parallel texts such as the Testament of Adam see the chapter \"Solomon the Astrologer.\""},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"polation at the hands of its editor; thus, in its non-interpolated ver-sion Solomon would follow \"elders\", linking the king indirectly with Noah.2/ If we take into consideration the traditions about Solomon that have been studied previously, it is clear that this \"chain of tra-dition\" reinterprets them from a quite different perspective. Thus, we have seen how Solomon the exorcist \"owed\" his powers over demons to Michael and to a ring given to him in response to his prayers; here, the role played by Solomon in the transmission and gathering of secret powers that the Sepher ha-Razim confers upon its users is, to a certain extent, secondary. However, by linking Solomon with Noah, the authority of the book and its contents are reinforced by reference to an older legendary figure, who, as we have seen in Jubilees, was related to secret knowledge from ancient times. Since Solomon appears as the last stage of the transmission of the Sepher ha-Razim, he is depicted as the principal depositary of the knowl-edge it contains; as this secret knowledge goes beyond the exorcis-tic traditions of Solomon, it was linked with Noah to strengthen its pseudepigraphical claims, which, however, ultimately rested on Solomon. Apart from the Jubilees passage that we have quoted, Noah does not seem to play an important role in exorcistic and magical literature.28 However, in the following Syriac bowl we find Noah and Solomon within an exorcism for the protection of men and women: 21 In this regard Morgan (Sepher ha-Razim, 19, n. 9) notes: \"This genealogy is similar to the Avoth tradition but it puts Solomon the King after the prophets and the sages. Since they should follow Solomon, it seems that an original genealogy ending with Solomon (probably after \"elders\") has been interpolated by an editor who wanted to claim knowledge of these secrets for the rabbis. Evidence for such and insertion is important because it casts some doubt on other Rabbinic elements in the text, and because of the fact that a Rabbinic editor let the pagan elements stand, illustrates an unfamiliar side of Rabbinic Judaism.\" It is not pertinent to define any editor of the text as \"rabbinic1' or to suppose that the \"rabbinic\" ele-ments are due to such an editor; it is more logical to think that any \"rabbinic\" element has been introduced with the aim of making the text less suspicious or the knowledge it contains less reprehensible for rabbinic \"orthodoxy\" (if such thing ever existed). Thus, we cannot suppose that the present text \"illustrates an unfa-miliar side of rabbinic judaism\" but rather a current of non rabbinic Judaism, that, incidentally, might have been more important than \"orthodoxy\". 28 Thus we find a reference to Noah and to Gen 6:8 in some Genizah frag-ments (TS Κ 1.152; TS Κ 1.168.1-3; see Schiffman and Swartz, Hebrew and Arama-ic Incantations Texts, 38-39, 41-42, 66, 140), but it is made in a rather \"uncompro-mising\" manner, since the texts ask for the favor Noah found before God."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"(10) [...] May it be bound and sealed by the seal by which the heaven and the earth are sealed, and by the seal by which Noah sealed his ark and by the seal of Solomon, (11) by which the demons and the dews are sealed and by the great seal.

Thus, it is likely that both Solomon and Noah were linked in some kind of traditions and that the knowledge and pow-ers attributed to one of them, were transferred without difficulty to the other.31 The third and last part into which we have divided the second part of the introduction to the Sepher ha-Razim links the new and purely magical traditions that the book develops with the exorcistic traditions about Solomon that we have found elsewhere.׳5־ However, here the exorcistic traditions are transformed into magical traditions, since Solomon is depicted as using the knowledge of the book not only to expel demons, but also to achieve active dominion over them, being able, through the book, to perform many things and to pros-per. Solomon is represented here as a magician, with the same kind of powers over demons and with the same kind of practical purpose in mind. Many of the procedures described in the Sepher ha-Razim have the same practical aims of obtaining money, love, success, revenge, etc. and can be found as well in the magical treatise of the Hygromanteia, which is also attributed to Solomon. 29 For the present translation and the Syriac text see Naveh and Shaked, Magic Spells and Formulae, 139-142. s\" The presence of a cross among the magical signs engraved in the bowl makes the editors think that the bowl is Christian (Magic Spells and Formulae, 140). How-ever, apart from this cross, there is nothing specifically Christian in the bowl, which seems, then, to follow Jewish patterns and traditions, such as the one that links Solomon and Noah. 31 The fact that Noah opens the introduction to the Sepher ha-Razim and So-lomon closes it seems to support the connection between both figures, a connec-tion that was used by the editor of the text to structure the introduction and to reinforce the pseudepigraphical authority of the work. 32 On these traditions see Ch. 4, 6-7, \"Solomon the Exorcist,\" \"Solomon the Horseman\" and \"Solomon the Son of David.\""},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"c. Conclusions The introduction to the Sepher ha-Razim, which we have just stud-ied, shows King Solomon in the new guise of magician. The près-ence in the texts of the tradition about the correct times (עת) to perform the procedures that are supposedly described in the Sepher reminds us of the distribution of hours we found in the Hygromante-ia; in the same way, the appointing of different entities over each hour seems to point to the same traditions we find in the Hygromanteia, which are connected to Solomon. In the Sepher, Noah and Solomon are linked, a connection that is paralleled in at least one Syriac bowl. On the basis of the introduction, the Sepher ha-Razim is attributed to Solomon. Generally speaking, the whole work agrees with many of the magical procedures that are described in the Hygromanteia, without the importance that the astrological material has in the Hygromanteia׳, in the same way, angelology is as fundamental in the Sepher ha-Razim as demonology is in the Hygromanteia. However, the Solomonic ascription of a Jewish magical handbook that can be dated around the fourth century CE and that in its actual language and form is unmistakably Jewish shows that the magical characterization we find in the Greek Hygromanteia was also known in Jewish groups with a Semitic mother-tongue and that this magical typology was heavily indebted to the magical techniques widespread in the world of Late Antiquity. This seems to suggest that the figure of Solomon as magician was developed at a later stage (second century CE on?) by incorporating materials not included in a previous exorcistic tra-dition. The importance of the introduction of the Sepher ha-Razim lies in the fact that this incorporation was not only made in the Greek-speaking Jewish world but also in the Semitic-speaking one and that this development witnesses to the success and acceptance of such magical practices despite the \"official\" rabbinic position, which was contrary to most of them. 5 5 33 The same dichotomy can be found in the Graeco-Roman world, where despite legislation and the adverse attitude of a part of the intellectual elite, magic was held in high regard by the majority of the population, without much regard to social status or educational background."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"SOLOMON THE MAGICIAN IN THE HYGROMANTEIA a. Introduction We have just seen how a Hebrew magical work dated to the fourth century CE and called Sepher ha-Razim was indirectly attributed to Solomon; this work depicts him as a magician and a master of se-cret knowledge. Now we shall analyze a magical treatise that forms part of the Hygromanteia, the Greek astrological work that we stud-ied when analyzing the astrological characterization of the king.34 As we have seen, the textual history and the composition of the Hygromanteia are quite complicated; although the astrological con-tents are an important part in all the branches of the textual tradi-tion we have, there are some textual witnesses that also preserve a magical treatise within the astrological material that comprises the whole of the work. This magical treatise shares the pseudepigraph-ical attribution to Solomon that forms the structure of the Hygromanteia and the importance that astrology has in the rest of the work. In the following pages, we shall focus our study on two different as-pects, one referring mainly to the structure of this magical treatise and the other to its contents. Thus, on the one hand we will ana-lyze its structure, how it fits into the general structure of the whole Hygromanteia, and study whether this magical part always formed part of the Hygromanteia; on the other, we will study which magical tech-niques are attributed to Solomon, how they are linked to Solomon, how they transform the characterization of the king, and whether there are examples of this attribution in other texts that may pro-vide us with parallels, so that we may able to understand better the importance of the magical traditions within the different traditions linked with Solomon that we have studied in the preceding pages. When we studied the different manuscripts that contain the dif-ferent texts of Hygromanteia of Solomon, it was evident that we had a very fragmented textual tradition, where it was useless to try to establish a critical edition of the text. It is precisely in the magical parts of the Hygromanteia where the textual tradition is most fragmen-tary, so that first we need to establish what we will study. Of all the manuscripts that were listed in the chapter \"Solomon the Astrolo-ger,\" only four (.Monacensis 70, Harleianus 5596, Parisinus 2419, Ath. Dyon. 282) were used to make the Synopsis that formed the basis for 34 See Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\""},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"our study of the contents and the structure of the Hygromanteia of Solomon׳,י:3 only two of these four manuscripts (.Parisinus 2419, Harle-ianus 5596) contain the magical treatise that now concerns us, and only one of them is reasonably complete (Harleianus 5596). Thus, at first sight, our purpose in studying this particular part of the Hygro-manteia seems to be doomed to failure since it seems that we do not have enough textual evidence to allow that study; however, there are two other manuscripts that were listed previously 36 which, al-though also fragmentary, contain precisely the magical part of the Hygromanteia. Therefore, we will use these two manuscripts to study the magical treatise, in addition to Parisinus, as the means to verify the text of Harleianus 5596 that we will use as the textual basis due to its better text.37 b. The Structure and Function of the Magical Treatise How does the \"Magical Treatise\" function within the whole Hygro-manteia? Does it form part of its original layout? Does it follow the structure we found when studying the astrological material of the Hygromanteia? These are the principal questions we have to ask the text in order to to locate it within the Solomonic traditions. Although answering them is not an easy task, we will try to do so by applying the same methods of analysis of forms and structure that have al-ready been used in the rest of the Hygromanteia.38 Let us begin by setting out the general structure of the magical material of the Hygromanteia·. Pseudepigraphical introduction: instruction of Solomon to his son Rehoboam (material from Harleianus). 35 See the Appendix 2 for the Greek Synopsis of the Hygromanteia. 36 Codex 1265 of the National Library of Athens׳, Manuscript 115 of the Historic and Ethnographic Society of Athens. See the list of manuscripts of the whole Hygromanteia in Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\" 37 It has to be noted that the caveat against the \"traditional\" textual edition that we expressed in the Chapter \"Solomon the Astrologer\" has to be applied also when studying the present text. Therefore, we are not trying to establish a critical text or to draw a stemma codicum of the different texts; we are studying some tra-ditions such as they appear in the several texts that we have at our disposal, so that we may be able to understand their role in the development of the different esoteric traditions linked with Solomon. Thus, when we define Harleianus 5596 as the better text, we do so on the basis of its fuller character and its basic fidelity to the general structure of the work. 38 See Ch. 8, \"Solomon the astrologer.\""},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"A.

The four manuscripts that preserve the magical material, completely or in part, agree grosso modo with its distribution and struc-ture. Two of them (Codex 1265 of the National Library of Athens, Manu-39 These same material is found in the middle of Monacensis. See the Appen-dix 2 \"Synopsis,\" p.

The Greek text of the magical material can be found in the Greek synopsis of the Hygromanteia (see Appendix 2). 41 On the general structure of the Hygromanteia of Solomon, see Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\""},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"script 115 of the Historic and Ethnographic Society of Athens) are clearly expansive in respect of the quantity of magical material preserved, but they follow the order of Harleianus 5596 and coincide almost exactly in the wording of the techniques described and in the spell-ing of the names of demons and angels. Parisinus 2419 follows Har-leianus 5596 very closely, but it is clearly incomplete, since the final part of the material is lacking. However, Parisinus 2419 is particu-larly important for understanding the structure of the Hygromanteia and of the magical material it includes; fortunately, this manuscript also preserves an abbreviated \"pseudepigraphical introduction\" in the same place as Harleianus 5596, that is, at the beginning of the block of magical material. Accordingly, it, too, is introduced by a unit comprising by a direct invocation of Solomon to his son Reho-boam, which we have called \"pseudepigraphical introduction.\" This \"introduction,\" like the others that appear throughout the rest of the Hygromanteia, together with the use of the second person, is the prin-cipal medium of attribution to Solomon. Besides, it is a powerful mechanism within the literary structure of the work, connecting the different blocks of material into a uniform whole. The \"pseudepi-graphical introduction\" to the magical material shows this clearly: Then, dearest son, you have learned the power of the planets, the days and the hours in which each of the planets rules, the techniques of their prayers and the demons that are subjected to them (by which you are going to pray to the angels that rule over them and to the demons that are subjected to the angels). It still remains to make known to you the instruments that are used for the technique of the congre-gating of spirits, especially the sword and the garments, and all the other things and all that will be said afterwards.42 Although the name of Rehoboam does not actually appear, it is clear that the vocative \"dearest son\" (φίλτατε υιέ) refers to him. This unit clearly functions here as the trigger that links the magical material with what had appeared before; besides, it seems to demonstrate that the astrological and the magical material are different parts of the 42 Harleianus 5596, f. 24v (Delatte, Anecdota, 406): ιδού μεμάθηκας, φίλτατε υιέ, τήν δύναμιν τών πλανήτων, τάς τεχνάς τών ευχών αυτών και τούς δαίμονας τούς ύποτασσομένους (έν οΐς μέλλεις εύχεσθαι τούς τε άγγέλους τούς έπιστα-τούντας αύτών και τούς δαίμονας όπού υποτάσσονται τών άγγέλων)· λοιπόν δέ σοι έτι είδέναι και τά όργανα τά υπηρετούντα πρός τήν τέχνην τής συνα-γωγής τών πνευμάτων, δηλαδή τήν μάχαιραν και τά ιμάτια και τά άλλα όσα δή και οια έν τω καθεξής ειρήσεται.

Two additional details give fur-ther support to the unity of the different parts of the Hygromanteia: on the one hand, the astrological material functions as a kind of introduction to the magical techniques described afterwards, since these techniques presuppose all the astrological instructions as pre-mises and conditions for their correct performance. On the other, both parts of the text share an additional trait that reinforces our hypothesis of the intrinsic unity of the Hygromanteia·. the first part of both the astrological and the magical units has a clearly technical character. They explain the conditions, materials and times that will make it possible for Rehoboam to perform the techniques that are described afterwards; in the case of the astrological material, the previous description of the correct hours, their demons and angels, prayers to planets, etc. is ultimately important for the correct har-vesting and use of plants with magical power. We find the same kind of structure within the magical material: first a detailed set of in-structions to made different tools and instruments is described; af-terwards, several techniques with various aims are described, in which the previously noted tools are essential. Consequently, according to the similarities of their inner structures, it is clear that the Hygromanteia as a whole forms a unit and that the magical material is not an appendix that was later added to the astrological material; both magic and astrology were worked into a literary composition at the same time, and by the same editor. In the second \"Pseudepigraphical Unit\" the name of Rehoboam occurs explicitly in the text; within this \"Pseudepigraphical Unit\" there is also a set of instructions to invoke demons that shares some traits with the Testament of Solomon: In many procedures, my very dear son Rehoboam, it is necessary to understand and know about the subduing of demons, since for the one who is going to subdue and to see the incorporeal spirits when they are incarnated great care is needed, as I will remind you here. Begin after the first day of the Moon, and refrain from intercourse with a woman, from meat, wine, fish and the other things; and when the eleventh of the moon comes first, fast for three days, only eating bread. And prepare some white linen clothes that have not been worn [...] And prepare also paper...\" 43 Harleianus 5596, f. 30; Delatte, Anecdota, 424: Έν πολλοίς μέν ούν πράγμασι"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"This \"Pseudepigraphical Unit5' furnishes us with further proof of the unity of the work and of its links with Solomon, since in it there is a direct dialogue between Solomon and Rehoboam in which the king advises his son how to rule over demons by applying the techniques that have been described before. Besides, this unit introduces a long invocation to the demons of the four cardinal points, which are identified with the names of winds. This type of invocation was clearly alluded to in the introduction to the Sefer ha-Razim, which supposes a new link between the techniques that both texts attributed to Solomon.44 The inner unity of the Hygromanteia is important for the represen-tation of the figure of Solomon since it supposes that both the char-acterizations of Solomon, as astrologer and as magician, go back to an earlier time, perhaps as early as the third or fourth century CE at least.4;> It also seems clear that both characterizations were quite intermingled, although it is quite probable that the astrological traits δέον διαλαβείν και γινώσκειν περί της ύποτάξεως τών πνευμάτων, ώ άκριβέστατε υιέ Τοβοάμ- ό γάρ μέλλων ύποτάξαι και ίδεΐν τά άσώματα πνεύματα σεσωματωμένα πολλής δέεται έπιμελείας, ώς ένταΰθα ύπομνήσω σε. άρχου άπό τής πρώτης ήμέρας τής Σελήνης και άπέχου άπό συνουσίας γυναικός και κρέατος και οίνου και ιχθύων καί τών λοιπών, και οταν φθάσωσιν ai ενδεκα τής Σελήνης, ποίησον τριήμερον νηστείαν, έσθίων μόνον άρτον. καί έχε προοικονομημένα ιμάτια λινά λευκά άφόρεστα. 14 The demons are invoked according to the four cardinal points (όρκισμός τής άνατολής, όρκισμός τού βορέως, όρκισμός τής δύσεως, όρκισμός τοΰ νότου). See Delatte, Anecdota, 426-427 for the whole exorcism. 4:) It is quite evident that the present state of the texts is due to their rework-ing in the Byzantine period; however, both the original version of the text as well as the traditions it contains go back to the last centuries of paganism (third or fourth century CE), as the parallels with the magical papyri suggest. We could even defend an even earlier date as M. Smith did in his dating of two Greek Magical papyri (\"A Note on Some Jewish Assimilationists: The Angels (P. Berlin 5025b, P. Louvre 2391),\" JANES 16-17 [1984-1985], 207-212), because both his texts and the text that we are studying show the resilience of some magical prax-is; thus, speaking about those two magical texts, he affirms: \"The fact that not only the original, but also its major expansion in L, are entirely Jewish in nomen-clature, argues for a date before the near-extermination of the Egyptian Jews in 115-117. After that, indeed, Jewish material survived in manuscripts and undeni-ably continued to be used, but one would expect, when a text was being expand-ed, some admixture of pagan personnel. A first century A.D. date would be more likely, but perhaps, for the sociological background, one should go back to a yet earlier time [...] This would put us in the first two thirds of the first century B.C., roughly 350 years before the writing of P. Louvre 2391. Is this two large a gap? I think not. Many manuscripts written as late as A. D. 1500 contain texts of the 'Lord's Prayer'\" (p. 212). The last affirmation could well be applied to the dating of the material contained in the Hygromanteia."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"were earlier, and only when combined with the exorcistic traditions and the wisdom traditions that circulated around Solomon in dif-ferent settings did the magical characterization acquire the impor-tance it has in part of the Hygromanteia. Now, we need to study in depth some of the techniques that are associated with Solomon in the Hygromanteia. c. The Magical Techniques of the Hygromanteia We have just seen how the different material of the Hygromanteia forms a unified block and how it shapes a figure of Solomon centered around magic and astrology. Now we will consider the several tech-niques that according to our text Solomon bestows on his son Re-hoboam and we will relate them to magical techniques that appear in other texts, such as the Testament of Solomon, the Sefer ha-Razim, the PGM, and the so-called Sword of Moses. By doing so, we will show how the magical traditions attributed to Solomon have to be under-stood against the background of the magic of Late Antiquity; equally it will become apparent that, in spite of suffering some slight Chris-tianization during its process of transmission,\"' our text seems to use Jewish sources that are highly syncretistic in their approach to the different magical techniques. We have noted above that the contents of the magical material follow a quite defined distribution: they can be divided into two clear groups. In the first, Solomon apparently explains to Rehoboam how several materials and tools are to be prepared, following a detailed set of instructions. Among these instructions there are some details that interest us, since they shed some light on details of the tradi-tion relating to Solomon as we have seen above. One of the passag-es that is especially relevant to us describes the process of making a sword, which later keeps appearing in the Hygromanteia as an essen-tial instrument for the performing of all the techniques that are described afterwards. The instructions are quite detailed: When you want to make the sword of the technique (with which you must draw the circle on the earth, and through which the pens of the 46 This process of Christianization is clear in a part of the tradition (Codex 1265 of the National Library of Athens, Manuscript 115 of the Historic and Ethnographic Society of Athens). Harleianus 5596 and Parisinus 2419 hardly evidence it at all, except in some clearly secondary interpolations that break the structural unit of the text, which mention Jesus Christ."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"technique and the other things will be made) it is necessary to do so in this way: take iron that has brought death, a sword or a blade or something similar; then give it to the blacksmith so that he may make for you a sword that may please you [...] and fix it with a handle made of the black horn of a he-goat, and do not cut anything with it and do not put it within a scabbard, and keep it in a pure spot. It is necessary that the artisan remains pure until he finishes making it. And use it only because of its power, and not for anything else.4' The text is quite technical; it insists on the need for purity to make the sword. The importance of the sword within the Hygromanteia is evident, as the text clearly shows; there are parallels to this tech-nique of the sword both in the PGM (Sword of Dardanus) and in purely Jewish works (Sword of Moses).48 However, the sword about which these texts speak is not a material one, but consist of the knowledge of a series of names and invocations of great power, whereas the sword of which Solomon speaks in the text just quoted is a real one. This shift in the content of the sword technique could reflect a tra-dition based upon the biblical episode of the judgment of the two prostitutes (1 Kings 3:16-28), in which King Solomon uses a sword to find truth and administer justice. According to some rabbinic texts Solomon used the sword of his father David, on which the name of God was engraved, to test the nature of the woman; the procedures that the king followed could be seen as magical.49 Therefore, in the light of this last parallel, the technique of the sword that the Hygro-manteia associates with Solomon could have been inspired by a de-velopment of the biblical passage that was to lead to the transfor-47 Harleianus 5596 f. 24v; Delatte, Anecdota, 406: Όπηνίκα δέ θέλεις ποιήσαι τήν μάχαιραν τής τέχνης (η δει σε έγχαράξαι τόν κύκλο ν έν τή γη καί δι' αυτής γενήσονται), οΰτω δει ποιεΐν.

Besides, in Josephus' Jewish Antiq-uities 8:44 Dardanos is mentioned as one of the great wise men who were clearly superseded by Solomon. On the Sword of Moses, see Gaster, Studies and Texts, 1:288-337 (English translation), 3:369-94 (text). 49 See Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, 4:287-287, n. 33-34 and the sources quot-ed there."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"mation of the spiritual sword mentioned in other magical texts into the real sword that the Hygromanteia speaks about. This transforma-tion also reinforces the inner structure and connection of the differ-ent magical techniques linked to Solomon, since most of them mention the use of the sword and its key importance in the success of the magical procedures. We have just seen that the \"sword of Solomon\" has considerable importance in framing the magical contents of the Hygromanteia. There are other techniques that have this same structural importance since they give name to the whole Hygromanteia; furthermore, they all share traits with other texts linked to Solomon and, what is more inter-esting, with a short text called the \"Collapse of Solomon\" that clearly shows the antiquity of these traditions. Thus, techniques of the gas-teromanteia (divination by means of a vase), and of the pibaktoromante-ia and of the so-called \"procedure of the mirror\" that appear in the Hygromanteia50 seem to be variants of the divinatory technique of lekanomanteia (divination be means of a bowl) and of Hydromanteia (=Hygromanteia, or divination be means of water) that gives to the whole work its title. They all share its divinatory character and the presence of two figures, magician and student (always a \"pure\" boy); and we find precisely both features in the \"Collapse of Solomon\" (PGM IV 850-906), a magical text that was copied in the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris, dated around the fourth century CE.51 Although the text is quite long, it is worth quoting it in its entirety so that we may take a look at the technique that it describes in the following terms: Charm of Solomon that produces a trance (works both on boys and on adults): I swear to you by the holy gods and the heavenly gods not to share the procedure of Solomon with anyone and certainly not to use it for something questionable / unless a matter of necessity forces you, lest perchance wrath be preserved for you. Formula to be spoken: \"[nomina barbara] Hear me, that is, my holy voice, because I call you upon your holy names, and reveal to me concern-ing the thing which I want, through the NN man or little boy, for otherwise I will not defend your holy and undefiled names. Come to me, you who became Hesies and were carried away by a river; inspire 50 See Delatte, Anecdota, 429, 430, 432-34. About all those techniques see Ch. 8, \"Solomon the Astrologer.\" יי Since the papyrus is a copy from older writings, we can suppose that the actual date of the techniques is earlier; therefore, we could date the text to around the second or third century CE."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"the NN man or boy concerning that which I ask you: [nomina barbara] Come to me through the NN man or little boy and tell me accurately since / I speak your names which thrice greatest Hermes wrote in Heliopolis with hieroglyphic letters: [nomina barbara] Enter into him and reveal to me concerning the NN matter.\" After you have purified the designated man [by keeping him] from intercourse for 3 days, you yourself also being pure, enter together with him.

The text describes carefully the invocation to be pronounced and the technical mat-ters concerning purity, the use of various plants to gain protection against the entities invoked, and offerings of incense. The text is characterized by the invocation of demons (gods) in order to ac-quire knowledge, by the use of a boy as medium and catalyst be-tween magician and gods, and by the extensive use of what can be labelled as magical botany, that is, descriptions of the types of plants that must be used during the whole procedure. Finally, the text insists on the purity of both magician and medium. Thus we have a text that can be dated to at least about the fourth century CE, attribut-ed to King Solomon, and in which a magical technique of divina-tion is described in detail. As there are no clear Christian traits in the text, we have to suppose that it belongs to a highly syncretized milieu and that the author of the text in its present form was either a pagan who was aware of the traditions associated with Solomon or a Jewish magician, since the text has at least one Jewish element, namely, its attribution to the king. We shall see now that there are several other texts that share these traits. Every peculiarity that has been noted in the \"Collapse of Solomon5' can be found with some changes in the techniques of the Hygromanteia of Solomon, which was discussed above. In each, a boy who has to be pure is used by the magician (that is, Solomon or his son Rehoboam) as a medium. The so-called \"divination through a vessel\" (γαστερομαντεία) runs as follows: βοός μέλαινης, ειτα ούτως εις τό ους τοΰ δείνα άνθρωπου ή παιδιού επιλέγε ζ' τόν λόγον, καί ευθέως πεσεΐται. σύ δέ καθέζου έπί τάς πλίνθοις καί πυνθάνου, καί πάντα άληθή διηγείται, χρή δέ στεφανώσαι αυτόν στεφάνψ άρτεμισίας χλωρικής, αυτόν τέ καί σε׳ ήδεται δέ ό θεός τη βοτάνη. άπόλυσις τοΰ κυριακοΰ εις το ους τοΰ δείνα״ [nomina barbara] έάν δέ βραδύνη, έπίθυε εις τοΰς άνθρακας τούς άμπελίνους σήσαμον καί μελάνθιον λέγων׳ [nomina barbara], χώρει, κύριε, εις τούς οικείους σου θρόνους καί διαφυλάξον τόν δείνα άπό πάσης κακίας, τελείως έμαθες׳ κρύβε, ή έξήχησίς έστιν ήδε׳ στήκε άπό μακρόθεν τοΰ παιδός ή τοΰ άνθρώπου έχων τάς χείρας έπί τών γλουτών έκτεταμένας, κεκολλημένους έχων τούς πόδας έπί τής γης δίωκε πολλάκις, έως κινηθή ήτοι έπί τά δεξιά ή έπί τά άριστερά׳ On the present text, see Preisendanz, PGM 1:102-105; for the present translation see Betz, Greek Magical Papyú, 55-56."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"After taking a vessel, put it under the table; afterwards, throw under it a new woollen cloak and nuts from a green tree, juice of panacea, and a young shoot [...] and bring a pure boy [...] and (have) the boy look into the middle of the vessel; and say in his ear [...] I adjure you, evil and impure spirit, by the great name of God Sabaoth and by the revelation of God that he revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai, by the holy of holies and by the name of the holy angels Michael, Gabriel and Uruel and Raphael, by the name of the seven terrible angels [...] I adjure you by the God in whose presence the whole creation of visible and invisible things trembles to depart at once from this man [...] Then ask the boy if he sees a corporeal man in the middle of the vessel; and if he says, \"It is in the middle\", immediately take a horn and close the mouth of the glass.

And the boy has the seal ring put on this...53 This text shares some elements with the \"Charm of Solomon that produces a trance\" that we examined above, although each text arranges them in a different order. Thus, the present text begins with some technical and practical instructions, whereas the \"charm of Solomon\" puts them after a long series of invocations and nomina barbara; both texts include long units of invocations, but while in the \"Charm of Solomon\" they are absolutely magical, in the gasteromanteia they refer to figures and motifs related to the Bible and Jewish-Christian magical traditions. In both texts, the role of the magician, who seems to function as a kind of master, and of the boy, who functions as medium and disciple, are evidently important. Both texts, then, reflect the same traditions and in both texts these traditions are clearly linked to Solomon. However, Solomon does not himself perform the techniques attributed to him: in one case (hygromanteia) he supposedly gives instruction to his son, and the other (\"charm\") is only attributed to Solomon, that is, he does not play 53 Harlenianus 5596 f. 36; Delatte, Anecdota, 429-430: Λαβών μίαν γαστέραν θες τήν άπάνω εις τράπεζαν εϊτα βάλε ύποκάτωθεν μανδύλιον καινόν καί καρυοφυλλάτον καί μόσχον καί χαλβάνην, [...] καί έπαρον έναν παρθένον παιδί ׳[...] καί νά έβλέπη τό παιδίν μέσα εις τήν γαστέραν. καί σύ είπέ εις το ζερβόν του ώτίον [...] τόν όρκισμόν׳ ορκίζω σε, πνεύμα πονηρόν καί άκάθαρτον, άπό τό μέγα όνομα του Θεοϋ Σαβαώθ καί άπό τήν άποκάλυψιν τοΰ Θεοΰ τήν οποίαν άπεκάλυψεν τοΰ Μωυσέως εις τό όρος τό Σινά, εις τά άγιάσματα τών άγιασμάτων καί είς τά ονόματα τών άγιων άγγέλων Μιχαήλ, Γαβριήλ, καί Όυρουήλ καί Ραφαήλ, καί είς τά ονόματα τών έπτα άγγέλων τών φοβερών [...] ορκίζω σας είς τόν θεόν δν τρέμει πάσα κτίσις όράτων καί άοράτων ότι ευθύς νά χωρίσθης άπό τόν άνθρώπον έτοΰτον [...]• τότ' έρώτα τό παιδί έάν έβλέπει άνθρωπον σαρκικόν μέσα είς τήν γαστέραν׳ καί αν ε'ίπη· μέσα έστίν, [...] καί τό παιδί νά έχη φυλακτήριον άπάνω τοΰ έτοΰτο τό παρόν."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"any direct role in it. This fact seems to suggest that this divinatory technique was at a very early date associated with Solomon, at least in certain circles, a date that could go back to the second century C.E. If the attribution of such a technique to Solomon was tradi-tional, we can then understand the title of the Hygromanteia as a means to protect all the techniques this work contains under the aegis of a procedure that was linked to Solomon from ancient times. In this we can explain the inclusion of different versions or variants in the text, as well as its title. One of the variants, a passage describing Πίβακτορομαντεία (divination by means of a vessel), shows further points of contact with the \"Charm of Solomon;\" the text, slightly abbreviated, runs as follows: Take a pibatarin (type of vessel) that has not been used [...] and have a pure boy with you [...] And have the sword of the art and make the throne of Solomon. And sit down, both you and the boy, in the hour in which the sun rises. And say the names eleven times in the boy's ear [nomina barbara]. And when you have said them eleven times, adjure them in the following way: I adjure you, planets, whichever of you are sweet in deeds and occult to men [...], by the name of the flaming angel and of the sword that turns to and fro, by the name of your seven powerful kings and of the purple sheep and of the strong lion [...], so that I may ask you what I want. And then ask the boy [54.[.״ This version of the technique coincides with the \"Charm of Solomon\" in two additional details: both texts mention that the magician has to say the magical formula in the ear of the boy and that the boy has to be seated on a special structure (a throne in the above text and unbaked bricks in the \"Charm\"). This supports our hypothesis about the early linking of this divinatory technique with Solomon. Besides, the presence in the body of the invocation of a reference to the seven kings of the demons should be noted, as this reference 54 Harleianus 5596 f. 37v; Delatte, Anecdota, 430: Επαρον ενα πιβατάριν άφόρεστον [...]. και έχε εναν παιδί παρθένον μετά σου.

In this Recension C of the Testament a voice from heaven communicates to Solomon the remedy for expelling the demon that is tormenting the boy: And then one day, King Solomon, after seeing him and extending his hands towards heaven, said: \"God of gods and only King of kings, reveal to me every torment of the boy by your terrible and all-hal-lowed name.\" A voice came saying: \"speak in the right ear of the boy these things: dafnön, magata, palipoul;\" write these things on a pure sheet of paper: [signa magica] and after having delivered them to fire, burn them for the purpose of fumigating him, while you hold in your hand the plant called ivy and the stone iasaßte; and in the fifth hour of the night, ask the boy and he will reveal to you all things.57 It is evident that the techniques that Recension C describes provide us with a direct link between the figure of King Solomon and the magical technique that we have studied in its different versions. Given the exorcistic interest of the Testament of Solomon, the aim of the tech-nique is changed into exorcism, but even so, we can distinguish how the primary interest was also to learn (\"he will reveal to you all things\"). This passage of the Testament proves that a technique where Solomon uses a boy as medium was attributed to him in magical treatises. Since we can date the \"Charm of Solomon\" to at least 55 T.S. Κ 1.30, 1. 3 (f.; on this text, see Ch. 4, \"Solomon the Exorcist,\" where it is discussed. 36 This recencion is described by McCown as more interested in demonology as a means of revealing nature^ treasures and mysteries than in the medical as-pects (McCown, Testament of Solomon, 32). Parisinus 2419 contains a version of this recension as well as an abbreviated version of the Hygromanteia•, on this version see the \"Greek Synopsis\" of the Hygromanteia in Appendix 2. 57 Kai δέ έν μία τών ήμέρων ό βασιλεύς Σολομών ίδών καί έκπετάσας τάς χείρας είς τόν ούρανόν ειπεν־ \"θεέ θεών καί μόνε βασιλεΰ βασιλέων, άποκάλυψόν μοι τήν τοΰ παιδός πασαν βάσανον διά τό όνομά σου τό φοβερόν καί πανάγιον.\" ήλθε δέ φωνή λέγουσα׳ \"πρόσειπε είς τό δεξιόν ους τοΰ παιδός τάδε׳ δαφνών׳ μαγατά״ παλιπούλ׳ έγγραφον δέ ποίησον έν άγεννήτω χάρτη ταύτα׳ *** καί παραδούς πυρί ύποκάπνισον αύτω, έχων δέ καί βοτάνην τήν λεγομένην κισσόν καί λίθον ίασαφήτην έν τή χειρί σου׳ καί έν πέμπτη ώρςι τής νυκτός έρώτησον τόν παΐδαν, καί άναγγελεΐ σοι άπαντα\" (McCown, Tes-lament of Solomon, p. 8, 1:5-14; my translation)."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"around the third century CE, this attribution is quite early and is connected directly with the magical praxis of Late Antiquity. Thus Solomon was viewed as a \"magician\" from an early date, and this characterization was mingled with other characterizations such as those of astrologer and exorcist. d. Conclusions The texts that have been studied have provided us with an image of Solomon that is completely different from that of the biblical sources. They all depict Solomon as a figure who shares all the traits of a magician and emphasize knowledge and the practical aspects of magical power as principal elements. It is likely that this picture of Solomon is the latest of all the images we have studied; it seems to be the final stage of the development of the figure of the king, a development based on both the exorcis-tic traditions that were linked with Solomon and the reinterpreta-tion of the biblical theme of his wisdom, first in Hermetic terms and afterwards in magical ones. This transformation must have taken place around the third century in Jewish and/or Jewish-Christian settings that were highly syncretistic in thought and religion. Although the actual manuscripts of several of the texts studied are late, as are the sith- or seventh-century Byzantine texts to which they witness, this does not invalidate the hypothesis, since even the present con-dition of the texts indicates that they are reworkings of much ear-lier material, which could go back to the third or fourth centuries. One fact that seems to strengthen our hypothesis is that every text mentions a technique (hydromancy), which has a parallel in a pa-pyrus, the text of which was copied in the fourth century. The use of a boy as medium is common to them all; besides, a boy plays a role in the structure of the Testament of Solomon as an introductory figure and also in the Hygromanteia itself, where Rehoboam is under-stood to be a student of secret lore who is taught by Solomon. As the introduction to the Sefer ha-Razim provides us with parallels to many of the techniques described in the Hygromanteia, and they are also linked to Solomon, the characterization of Solomon as magi-cian seems to have been known in Jewish circles where Semitic languages were spoken, which presupposes that it was quite popu-lar among Jews in general in Late Antiquity. This popularity con-"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"tinued into the Middle Ages among Christian magicians, the clear-est example being the Latin Clavicula Salomonis and its translations into several European languages and into Hebrew (Maphteah Shelo-mo)."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION In the foregoing pages we have described how the biblical figure of King Solomon was understood and how it developed into an alto-gether new figure. As we have seen, even in the historical books of Kings there is a certain ambivalence in the treatment and consider-ation of Solomon. On the one hand, he is the wise king par excel-lence, touched by divine wisdom, and the glorious king who built the Temple of God, an honor denied even to David. On the other hand, he is transformed into the first person who is ultimately responsible for the secession of the north, on account of his marriage with for-eign women and other offenses that the final Deuteronomistic edi-tor regarded as capital. In a way, the development of the figure of Solomon over the following centuries follows the same lines of char-acterization, which are taken as the point of departure for construct-ing a complex typology of the king, a typology the evolution of which is linked to the changing circumstances of the Jewish groups from which it emerged. The three characterizations that already appear in Kings as in-extricably associated with the portrait of Solomon, namely, the wise king, the builder of the Temple, and the sinner, sometimes occur together, sometimes separately, in the typology of the king. Thus, we have seen that the Chronicler was silent about the sins of So-lomon, downplayed to some extent his wisdom and depicted the construction of the Temple as his principal exploit. Even so, the Chronicler also took away some of this merit and assigned it to David, as the person responsible for the preparations that made the build-ing possible. To a certain extent, in the postexilic period the con-ception of Solomon oscillates between his characterization as wise king and his portrayal as glorious builder of the Temple. Thus, whereas Chronicles focuses on the building aspect, Proverbs and Qo-heleth highlight the importance of Solomon's legendary wisdom. But both descriptions share one important detail: Solomon is viewed first and foremost as a king, both glorious and famous. The Jewish literature of the Second Temple adopted the princi-pal traits with which Solomon had been depicted, but adapted them"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"to the new cultural and historical setting of Hellenism and the in-elusion of Palestine in the Greek Mediterranean oikoumene supposed. The figure of Solomon was affected by those changes and the older traits of wise king, temple-builder and sinner began to be transformed by the new ways of thinking. Although some writers, like Ben Sira, continued with the traditional description of Solomon that had appeared in the Scriptures, others began to change it in subtle ways. Thus Eupolemus, the Jewish historian of the second century BCE who wrote Concerning thejudaean Kings, depicted Solomon as King of kings and continues the \"canonization\" of David already initiated by the Chronicler, as a result of which the responsibility of Solomon for the construction of the Temple was considerably diminished. As the Temple was still the center of the Jewish homeland and of Jew-ish life, the figure of Solomon was still closely associated with its construction. However, little by little his portrait as wise king ac-quired greater weight as the Greek translation of Kings (second cen-tury BCE) clearly suggests. There, Solomon is transformed into a Hellenistic ruler, endowed with divine wisdom over the whole cos-mos; the wording of the texts suggests that Hellenistic theories of kingship were taken into account, and the preeminence of the char-acterization of Solomon as wise is proved by the miscellanies of 3 Kingdoms 2, which insist on that aspect, using specialized Greek terms. Besides these miscellanies, the wording of 3 Kingdoms 5 shows clear-ly that the wisdom attributed to Solomon was viewed in a holistic way: it was an all-encompassing wisdom, with knowledge and do-minion over the four realms of nature, air, earth, fire, water. Although it is evident that the Greek translation contains all the material concerning the building of the Temple and its description, there is a clear reinterpretation of the text with regard to the characteriza-tion of Solomon. Since we can date the Greek translation of Kings to the second century BCE and locate it in Alexandria, we can say as well that around this date the figure of Solomon began to be actively reinterpreted in Jewish communities that were deeply Hel-lenized and in which there was a clear tendency to syncretism. In this milieu, Solomon was depicted as being endowed with a practi-cal wisdom that encompassed all the aspects of the cosmos. It seems that this perspective acquired further importance and became clearly predominant after the destruction of the Temple. Thus, already in the first century CE the characterization of Solomon as king endowed with a special kind of wisdom was well"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"established, as Wisdom of Solomon 7 shows: Solomon was viewed as an Hermetic sage, a master of all physical things (magister omnium physicorum), with knowledge and power even over the spirits, that is, the demons. In his Jewish Antiquities, Josephus develops the charac-terization of Solomon as wise king, but besides adding what we have called Hermetic features, he explicitly mentions Solomon skill as exorcist, noting that even in the historian's own time Solomon's exorcistic powers remained intact. It is quite likely that both texts knew of a Jewish tradition in which Solomon was depicted as a powerful exorcist. This tradition must have existed before being added to the characterization of Solomon as Hermetic sage, which was favored by the older exorcistic tradition. As 11QPsAp3 shows, the Qumran sectarians were aware of such a tradition, which was linked with an identification formula (\"who are you?\"). This formu-la is also associated linked with Solomon in the Testament of Solomon, where it functions as the structuring device of the work. Although 11QPsApa is dated to the first century CE, according to paleograph-ical analysis, and the Testament of Solomon can be dated to around the fourth century CE, the similarities in the use of the formula are so striking that the same chain of tradition is to be suspected. Besides, parallels furnished by Hekhalot and apocalyptic texts attest the exist-ence of such an identificatory formula. However, we have also seen how the characterization of Solomon as exorcist had other developments, such as the one that links the title \"Son of David\" with Solomon, or the amulets in which Solomon, depicted as a horseman, pierces a female demon with a lance. The title \"Son of David\" was applied to Solomon at an early date and already by the first century CE was clearly linked with the portrait of Solomon as exorcist. Around the same time it was also applied to Jesus, establishing a competition between both figures as exor-cists, a competition that was continued by Jews and Christians, as we have seen in the polemical writings of Greek fathers from the third century on. Jewish bowls and amulets also witness the près-ence of the title \"Son of David\" applied to Solomon in exorcisms from the third century on. Several Christian amulets provide fur-ther support for it. The Greek amulets in which Solomon appears as subduing de-mons show the popularity of the exorcistic characterization of So-lomon and its presence in every-day life. The parallels furnished by several Jewish and Mandaean bowls suggest that this portrait of"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Solomon was also known in Jewish-speaking circles. Besides, it seems likely that they gave rise to the later iconography of Saint George and the dragon. The esoteric images of Solomon are completed by his character-ization as astrologer and magician. Both arise from the relationship established between Solomon and the special kind of practical wis-dom that we have described in connection whith Solomon as Her-metic sage. Thus, astrological details were incorporated into the Jewish Antiquities, Wisdom of Solomon and the Testament of Solomon, but they do not shape a new characterization of the king. This characteriza-tion comes to light in the Hygromanteia of Solomon, which describes Solomon as the master of astrological knowledge. This work, as well as Ch. 18 of the Testament of Solomon, has a new demonology in which the demons are transformed into astrological entities over which Solomon has practical knowledge, being able then to control them. Although this astrological characterization of Solomon was popular in Hellenized and syncretistic Jewish settings, it was also widespread in communities that used Aramaic and Hebrew, as clearly suggest-ed by various pieces of evidence from Aramaic bowls and Hebrew amulets. Even in rabbinic texts (Pesiqta de Rab Kahana, Qohelet Rab-bah) this characterization of Solomon as astrologer was alluded to, which proves that it was also known in less Hellenized Jewish com-munities. Solomon and astrology appear in intimate connection at least from the second century CE and this relationship again has as its main basis the characterization of Solomon as wise king. Solomon is rep-resented as astrologer because it was believed that he knew about the times relating to the planets and their servants, the demons and angels. When he is represented as magician, his knowledge becomes completely active, so that is able to manipulate the reality to his advantage, or at least to the advantage of any one who could use his writings and the knowledge / power that they bestowed. His characterization as magician seems to be the last step in the devel-opment of the wisdom trait: Solomon becomes a magician when knowledge / wisdom becomes identified with power or gives access to power. This identification was always latent in the practical wis-dom that Hellenized Jewish communities attributed to the king, and was favored by the exorcistic traditions about the king's power over demons, which were widespread at least from the first century CE. This magical representation of Solomon was widespread in non-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Greek speaking communities as well, but there the exorcistic tradi-tion was predominant and we have only hints of Solomon as magi-cian, as in the introduction to the Sepher ha-Razim, which has many points of contact with the magical arts attributed to the king in the Hygromanteia of Solomon. It seems that the rabbis interpreted and trans-formed Solomon's practical wisdom into knowledge of the Torah, thus describing him as a paradigm of a rabbinic sage. They praised Solomon's great mastery of the Torah and deliberately downplayed the esoteric traditions about Solomon's wisdom, traditions that, in spite of everything, survived on the fringes of the every-day life of even the rabbinically-oriented communities of Palestine and Baby-Ion, as the bowls and amulets clearly show. If we go beyond the boundaries of rabbinic orthodoxy, we find works like the Sepher ha-Razim, which clearly show how magic and the magical view of Solomon permeated the necessities of daily life, which were other-wise overlooked. The rabbinic sources ar aware of the traditions that describe Solomon as exorcist, astrologer, or magician, but these traditions arere downplayed by being transformed into legendary stories. Thus, the practical contents of the Greek works attributed to Solomon are absent from the rabbinic texts, as they are also absent from the Islamic adaptations of those traditions. The popularity that the astrological and magical characterization of Solomon enjoyed in syncretistic and Hellenized Jewish circles was continued in Christian astrology and magic, which transmitted many of the works attributed to Solomon and preserved the esoteric tra-ditions and procedures associated with them. Although these works were slightly re-worked during their transmission, they display their Jewish origin, and comprise the handbooks of astrologers and ma-gicians all around the Mediterranean until the nineteenth century. If we had to establish an approximate chronology for this develop-ment it would be the following: in the middle of the second century BCE, Hellenized communities of Alexandria began to transform the figure fo Solomon as wise king into a Hellenistic king with attributes of the Hermetic sage. This change was very gradual and incorpo-rated other Jewish traditions that associated Solomon with power over demons. Initially (first century CE), the exorcistic traditions were apotropaic in their aims and they remained such in the less Helle-nized environments and practices that the Aramaic bowls and the Hebrew amulets of later periods reflect. Afterwards, in the more Hellenized Jewish communities, the Hermetic characterization trans-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"forms the passive and protective goals embodied in the figure of Solomon as exorcist into images in which the king plays an active role, first as astrologer, then as magician. This final change could have taken place around the second or third century, and is paral-leled by Philostratus' description of the philosopher Appolonius of Tyana. Afterwards, from the fourth century on, Solomon was de-scribed both as astrologer and magician, and these characterizations enjoyed considerable popularity in syncretistic Hellenized Jewish circles. Later, \"Christian\" magicians and astrologers transmitted the very same writings and attributions, which survived as the handbooks of medieval and modern practitioners of the esoteric.
