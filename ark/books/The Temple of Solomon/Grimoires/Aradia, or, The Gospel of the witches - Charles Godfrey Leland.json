H. ANDREWS to Folk-Lore} he will be aware that there are in Italy greatnumbers of strege, fortune - tellers or witches, who divine by cards, performstrange ceremonies in which spirits are supposed to be invoked, make and sellamulets, and, in fact, comport themselves generally as their reputed kind arewont to do, be they Black Voodoos in America or sorceresses anywhere.But the Italian Strega or sorceress is in certain respects a different characterfrom these. In most cases she comes of a family in which her calling or art hasbeen practised for many generations. I have no doubt that there are instances inwhich the ancestry remounts to mediaeval, Roman, or it may be Etruscan times.The result has naturally been the accumulation in such families of muchtradition. But in Northern• March, 1S97: \"Neapolitan Witchcraft.\"Italy, as its literature indicates, though there has been some slight gathering offairy tales and popular superstitions by scholars, there has never existed theleast interest as regarded the strange lore of the witches, nor any suspicion thatit embraced an incredible quantity of old Roman minor myths and legends, suchas OviD has recorded, but of which much escaped him and all other Latinwriters.'This ignorance was greatly aided by the wizards and witches themselves, inmaking a profound secret of all their traditions, urged thereto by fear of thepriests. In fact, the latter all uncon* sciously actually contributed immensely tothe preservation of such lore, since the charm of the forbidden is very great, andwitchcraft, like the truffle, grows best and has its raciest flavour when mostdeeply hidden. However this may be, both priest and wizard are vanishing nowwith incredible rapidity—it has even struck a French writer that a Franciscan ina railway carriage is a strange' Thus we msy imagine what the case would huve been as re-eards German fairy-tales if nothing had survived to a future day except the colleclions of Grimm andMus/gus. The world would fall into the belief that these constituted all theworks of the kind which had ever existed, when, in fact, theyfoini only a smallpart of the whole. And folklore was unknown to classic authors: there is reallyno evidence in any ancient Latin writer that he gathered traditions and the like"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"among the vulgar, as men collect at present. Theyall made books entirely out ofbooks—there being still \"a few left of the same sort\" of lilctsti.PREFACEanomaly—and a few more years of newspapers and bicycles (Heaven knowswhat it will be when flying-machines appear !) will probably cause anevanishment of all.However, they die slowly, and even yet there are old people in the Romagna ofthe North who know the Etruscan names of the Twelve Gods, and invocations toBacchus, Jupiter, and Venus, Mercury, and the Lares or ancestral spirits, and inthe cities are women who prepare strange amulets, over which they mutterspells, all known in the old Roman time, and who can astonish even the learnedby their legends of Latin gods, mingled with lore which may be found in Cato orTheocritus. With one of these I became intimately acquainted in 1886, and haveever since employed her specially to collect among her sisters of the hidden spellin many places all the traditions of the olden time known to them. It is true thatI have drawn from other sources, but this woman by long practice has perfectlylearned what few understand, or just what 1 want, and how to extract it fromthose of her kind.Among other strange relics, she succeeded, after many years, in obtaining thefollowing \"Gospel,\" which I have in her handwriting. A full account of its naturewith many details will be found in an Appendix. I do not know definitelywhether my informant derived a part of these traditionsfrom written sources or oral narration, but believe it was chiefly the latter.However, there are a few wizards who copy or preserve documents relative totheir art. I have not seen my collector since the \"Gospel\" was sent to me. 1 hopeat some future time fo be better informed.For brief explanation 1 may say that witchcraft is known to its votaries as lavecckia religione, or the old religion, of which Diana is the Goddess, herdaughter Aradia (or Herodias) the female Messiah, and that this little work setsforth how the latter was born, came down to earth, established witches andwitchcraft, and then returned to heaven. With it are given the ceremonies andinvocations or incantations to be addressed to Diana and Aradia, the exorcism ofCain, and the spells of the holy-stone, rue, and verbena, constituting, as the textdeclares, the regular church-service, so to speak, which is to be chanted or"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"pronounced at the witch-meetings. There are also included the very curiousincantations or benedictions of the honey, meal, and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper, which is curiously classical, and evidently a relic of the RomanMysteries.The work could have been extended ad infinitum by adding to it the ceremoniesand incantations which actually form a part of the Scripture of Witchcraft, but asthese arePREFACEnearly all—or at least in great number—to be found in my works entitledEtruscatt'Rotnan Remains and Legends of Florence, I have hesitated to compilesuch a volume before ascertaining whether there is a sufficiently large numberof the public who would buy such a work.Since writing the foregoing I have met with and read a very clever andentertaining work entitled // Romanso dei Settimani, G. Cavagnari, i88g, inwhich the author, in the form of a novel, vividly depicts the manners, habits ofthought, and especially the nature of witchcraft, and the many superstitionscurrent among the peasants in Lombardy. Unfortunately, notwithstanding hisextensive knowledge of the subject, it never seems to have once occurred to thenarrator that these traditions were anything but noxious nonsense orabominably un-Christian folly. That there exist in them marvellous relics ofancient mythology and valuable folklore, which is the very cor cordium ofhistory, is as uncared for by him as it would be by a common Zoccolone ortramping Franciscan. One would think it might have been suspected by a manwho knew that a witch really endeavoured to kill seven people as a ceremony orrite, in order to get the secret of endless wealth, that such a sorceress must havehad a store of wondrous legends ; but of all this there is no trace, and it is veryevidentPREFACEthat nothing could be further from his mind than that there was anythinginteresting from a higher or more genial point of view in it all."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"His book, in fine, belongs to the very great number of those written on ghostsand superstition since the latter has fallen into discredit, in which the authorsindulge in much satirical and very safe but cheap ridicule of what to them ismerely vulgar and false. Like Sir Charles Coldstream, they have peeped into thecrater of Vesuvius after it had ceased to \" erupt,\" and found \"nothing in it.\" Butthere was something in it once ; and the man of science, which Sir Charles wasnot, still finds a great deal in the remains, and the antiquarian a Pompeii or aHerculaneum—'tis said there are still seven buried cities to unearth. I have donewhat little (it is really very little) I could, to disinter something from the deadvolcano of Italian sorcery.If this be the manner in which Italian witchcraft is treated by the mostintelligent writer who has depicted it, it will not be deemed remarkable thatthere are few indeed who will care whether there is a veritable Gospel of theWitches, apparently of extreme antiquity, embodying the belief in a strangecounter-religion which has held its own from pre-historic time to the presentday. \"Witchcraft is all rubbish, or something worse,\" said old writers, \" andtherefore all booksPREFACEabout it are nothing better.\" I sincerely trust, however, that these pages may fallinto the hands of at least a few who will think better of them.I should, however, in justice to those who do care to explore dark andbewildering paths, explain clearly that witch-lore is hidden with mostscrupulous care from all save a very few in Italy, just as it is among theChippeway Medas or the Black Voodoo. In the novel to the life of / Settimani anaspirant is represented as living with a witch and acquiring or picking up withpain, scrap by scrap, her spells and incantations, giving years to it. So my friendthe late M. Dragomanoff told me how a certain man in Hungary, having learnedthat he had collected many spells (which were indeed subsequently published infolklore journals), stole into the scholar's room and surreptitiously copied them,so that the next year when Dragomanoff returned, he found the thief in fullpractice as a blooming magician. Truly he had not got many incantations, only adozen or so, but a very little will go a great way in the business, and I venture tosay there is perhaps hardly a single witch in Italy who knows as many as 1 havepublished, mine having been assiduously collected from many, far and wide.Everything of the kind which is written is, moreover, often destroyed"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"•with scrupulous care by priests or penitents, or the vast number who have asuperstitious fear of even being in the same house with such documents, so thatI regard the rescue of the Vangelo as something which is to say the leastremarkable.CONTENTSPrefaceCHAPTER IPAGE VHow Diana gave Birth to Arabia (Herodias)Of the sufferings of Mankind, and how Diana sent Aradia on earth to relievethem by teaching resistance and Sorcery—Poem addressed to Mankind—How toinvoke Diana or Aradia,CHAPTER IIThe Sabbat—Treguenda or Witch-Meeting . 8How to consecrate the supper—Conjuration of the meal and of Salt—Invocationto Cain—Conjuration of Diana and to Aradia,CHAPTER IIIHow Diana made the Stars and the Rain i8CHAPTER IVThe Charm of the Stones consecrated to Diana—The Incantation of PerforatedStones—The Spell or Conjuration of the Round Stone . 21PAGECHAPTER V"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Conjuration of the Lemon and Pins—Incantation TO Diana 29CHAPTER VI A Spell to Win Love 35CHAPTER VIITo Find or Buy anything, or to have Good Fortune thereby 38CHAPTER VIIITo HAVE A Good Vintage and very Good Wine BY THE Aid of Diana 44CHAPTER IX Tana and Endamone, or Diana and Endymion 51CHAPTER X Madonna Diana 61A Legend of Cettardo, and how Diana appeared with ten Bridesmaids to giveaway a Bride—Incantation to Diana for a Wedding.CHAPTER XIThe House of the Wind 65Showing how Diana rescued a Lady from Death at the Honse of the Wind inVolterra.PAGECHAPTER XII Tana or Diana, the Moon-Goddess ... 72CHAPTER XIII Diana and the Children 78CHAPTER XIVThe Goblin Messengers of Diana and Mercury 86CHAPTER XV Laverna 89APPENDIX loiARADIA"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"OR THEGOSPEL OF THE WITCHESCHAPTER IHOW DIANA GAVE BIRTH TO ARADIA (HERODIAS)\"It is Diana!

Lucifer, her brother and son, herself and her other half, was the light.And when Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was herother half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire.Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture,in delight, she trembled with desire This desire was the Dawn.But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he wasthe light which flies into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which fliesbefore the cat.Then Diana went to the fathers of the Beginning, to the mothers, the spirits whowere before the first spirit, and lamented unto them that she could not prevailwith Lucifer. And they praised her for her courage; they told her that to rise shemust fall; to become the chief of goddesses she must become a mortal.And in the ages, in the course of time, when the world was made, Diana went onearth, as did Lucifer, who[A MADE THE STARShad fallen, and Diana taught magic and sorcery, whence came witches andfairies and goblins—all that is like man, yet not mortalAnd it came thus that Diana took the form of a cat. Her brother had a cat whom"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"he loved beyond all creatures, and it slept every night on his bed, a cat beautifulbeyond all other creatures, a fairy: he did not know it.Diana prevailed with the cat to change forms with her; so she lay with herbrother, and in the darkness assumed her own form, and so by Lucifer becamethe mother of Aradia. But when in the morning he found that he lay by bissister, and that light had been conquered by darkness, Lucifer was extremelyangry; but Diana sang to him a spefl, a song of power, and he was silent, thesong of the night which soothes to sleep; he could say nothing. So Diana withher wiles of witchcraft so charmed him that he yielded to her love. This was Chefirst fascination ; she hummed the song, it was as the buzzing of bees {or a topspinning round), a spinning-wheel spinning life. She spun the lives of all men;all things were spun from the wheel of Diana. Lucifer turned the wheel.Diana was not known to the witches and spirits, the fjdries and elves who dwellin desert place, the goblins, as their mother; she hid herself in humility and wasa mortal, but by her will she rose again above all. She had such passion forwitchcraft, and became so powerful therein, that her greatness could not behidden.And thus it came to pass one night, at the meeting ofall the sorceresses and fairies, she declared that she would darken the heavensand turn all the stars into mice.All those who were present said—^ If thou canst do such a strange thing, having risen to such power, thou shaltbe our queen.\"Diana went into the street ^ she took the bladder of an ox and a piece of witch-money, which has an edge like a knife—^with such money witches cut the earthfrom men's foot-tracks—and she cut the earth, and with it and many mice shefilled the bladder, and blew into the bladder till it burst.And there came a great marvel, for the earth which was in the bladder becamethe round heaven above, and for three days there was a great rain; the micebecame stars or rain.

Here, indeed, I am speaking seriously, for the man who can trainhis faith to actually believe in and cultivate or develop his will can really workwhat the world by commonconsent regards as miracles. A time will come when this principle will form notonly the basis of all education, but also that of all moral and social culture. Ihave, I trust, fully set it forth in a work entitled \" Have you a Strong Will ? orhow to Develop it or any other Faculty or Attribute of the Mind, and render itHabitual,\" &c.

The botanist who repeats it beforegoing into the fields will probably discover some new plant, and the astronomerby night be almost certain to run against a brand-new planet, or at least anasteroid. It should be repeated before going to the races, to visit friends, placesof amusement, to buy or sell, to make speeches, and specially before hunting orany nocturnal goings-forth, since Diana is the goddess of the chase and of night.But woe to him who does it for a jest!CHAPTER VIIITO HAVE A GOOD VINTAGE AND VERY GOOD WINE BY THE AID OF DIANA'* Sweet is the rintage when the showering grapes In Bacchanal profusion reel toearth, Purple and gushing.\"— Byron, Donjuan^ c. 124.''

Which willbe saving me from dire distress; For should I lose them I'd be lost myself. Butwith thy aid, Diana, I'll be saved.[This is a very interesting invocation and tradition, and probably of greatantiquity from very striking intrinsic evidence. For it is firstly devoted to asubject which has received little attention—the connection of Diana as the moonwith Bacchus, although in the great Dizionario Storico Mitologico, by Pozzoliand others, it is expressly asserted that in Greece her worship was associatedwith that of Bacchus, Escula-pius, and Apollo. The connecting link is the Iwrn.In a medal of Alexander Severus, Diana of Ephesus bears the horn of plenty.This is the horn or horns of the new moon, sacred to Diana. According toCallimachus, Apollo himself built an altar consisting entirely of horns to Diana,The connection of the horn with wine isobvious. It was usual among the old Slavonians for the priest of Svantevit, theSun-god, to see if the horn which the idol held in his hand was full of wine, in"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"order to prophesy a good harvest for the coming year. If it was filled, all wasright; if not, he filled the horn, drank from it, and replaced the horn in the hand,and predicted that all would eventually go well.' It cannot fail to strike the readerthat this ceremony is strangely like that of the Italian invocation, the onlydifference being that in one the Sun, and in the other the Moon is invoked tosecure a good harvest.In the Legends of Florence there is one of the Via del Corno, in which the hero,falling into a vast tun or tina of wine, is saved from drowning by sounding ahorn with tremendous power. At the sound, which penetrates to an incredibledistance, even to unknown lands, all come rushing as if enchanted to save him.In this conjuration, Diana, in the depths of heaven, is represented as rushing atthe sound of the horn, and leaping through doors or windows to save the vintageof the one who blows. There is a certain singular affinity in these stories.In the story of the Via del Coma, the hero is' Krbusslbr, Serbanvafdiickt Altirthuma; Ft. I, p. 273,saved by the Red Goblin or Robin Goodfellow, who gives him a horn, and it isthe same sprite who appears in the conjuration of the Round Stone, which issacred to Diana. This is because the spirit is nocturnal, and attendant on Diana-Titania.Kissing the hand to the new moon is a ceremony of unknown antiquity, and ]0B,even in his time, regarded it as heathenish and forbidden— which always meansantiquated and out of fashion—as when he declared {xxxi. 26, 27), \" If I beheldthe moon walking in brightness . . . and my heart hath been secretly enticed ormy mouth hath kissed my hand . . . this also were an iniquity to be punished by"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the Judge, for 1 should have denied the God that is above.\" From which it mayor ought to be inferred that Job did not understand that God made the moonand appeared in all His works, or else he really believed the moon was anindependent deity. In any case, it is curious to see the old forbidden rite stillliving, and as heretical as ever.The tradition, as given to me, very evidently omits a part of the ceremony, whichmay be supplied from classic authority. When the peasant performs the rite, hemust not act as once a certain African, who was a servant of a friend of mine,did. The coloured man's duty wasso ARABIAto pour out every morning a libation of rum to a fetish—and he poured it downhis own throat The peasant should also sprinkle the vines, just as theDevonshire farmers, who observed all Christmas ceremonies, sprinkled, also jfrom a horn, their apple-trees.CHAPTER IXTANA AND ENDAMONE, OK DIANA AND ENDYMION\"Hie ultra Endymionem indormit negligentia:.\"\" Now it is fabled that Endymion, admittsd to Olympus, whence he was expelledfor want of respect to Juno, was banished for thirty years to earth.

Theconception is that of a beautiful youth furtively kissed in his slumber by Dian ofreputed chastity. The ancient myth is, to begin with, one of darkness and light,or day and night, from which are born the fifty-one (now fifty-two) weeks of theyear. This is Diana, the night, and Apollo, the sun, or light in another form. It isexpressed as love-making during sleep, which, when it occurs in real life,generally has for active agent some one who, without being absolutely modest,wishes to preserve appearances. The established character of Diana among theInitiated (for which she was bitterly reviled by the Fathers of the Church) wasthat of a beautiful hypocrite who pursued amours in silent secrecy.\"Thus as the moon Endymion lay with her, So did Hippolytus and Verbio.\"(On which the reader may consult Tertullian, De Falsa Religione, lib. ii. cap. 17,and Pico de MiRANDULA, La Strega.)But there is an exquisitely subtle, delicately strange idea or ideal in theconception o£ the apparently chaste \" clear cold moon \" casting her living lightby stealth into the hidden recesses of darkness and acting in the occult"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"mysteries of love or dreams. So it struck Byron ' as an original thought that thesun does not shine on half the forbidden deeds which the moon witnesses, andthis is emphasised in the Itahan witch-poem. In it the moon is distinctlyinvoked as the protectress of a strange and secret amour, and as the deity to beespecially invoked for such love-making. The one invoking says that the windowis opened, that the moon may shine splendidly on the bed, even as our love isbright and beautiful . . . and I pray her to give great rapture— sfogo —to us.The quivering, mysteriously beautiful light of the moon, which seems to cast aspirit of intelligence or emotion over silent Nature, and dimly1 \" The aun set and uprose Ihe yellow moon : The devil's in ihe moon formischief; they Who called her chaste, metbinks, began loo soon Theirnomenclalure ; there is not a day The longest, not the twenty-first of June, Seeshalf the business in a wicked way On which three ungle houn of moonshinesmile.\"S9half awaken it—raising shadows into thoughts and causing every tree and rockto assume the semblance o£ a living form, but one which, while shimmeringand breathing, still sleeps in a dream —could not escape the Greeks, and theyexpressed it as Diana embracing Endymion. But as night is the time sacred tosecrecy, and as the true Diana of the Mysteries was the Queen of Night, whowore the crescent moon, and mistress of all hidden things, including \"sweetsecret sins and loved iniquities,\" there was attached to this myth far more thanmeets the eye. And just in the degree to which Diana was believed to be Queenof the emancipated witches and of Night, or the nocturnal Venus-Astarte herself,so far would the love for the sleeping Endymion be understood as sensual, yetsacred and allegorical. And it is entirely in this sense that the witches in Italy,who may claim with some right to be its true inheritors, have preserved andunderstood the myth.It is a realisation of forbidden or secret love, with attraction to the dimly seenbeautiful-by-moonlight, with the fairy or witch-like charm of the supernatural—a romance all combined in a single strange form—the spell of Night I \" There is adangerous silence in that hour, A stillness which leaves room for the ful! soul Toopen all itself, without the power Of calling wholly back its self-contiol;(Or De h\\"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MiKABr. strai; appa: livin;■of d of V oriii half ness wit( as t and love win-spk and rapt Ti the^ gene-MADONNA DIANACHAPTER XMADONNA DIANA\" The Mndonna is essentially tbe goddess of the moon.\"—\"Ifirfki lit tht MHttiii,\" by E.

And if the young lady had onefault, it was her great pride, nor would she willingly be married unless in goodstyle, with luxury and festivity, in a fine garment, with many bridesmaids ofrank.And this became to the beautiful Rorasa —for such was her name—such anobject of desire, that her head was half turned with it, and the other girls of heracquaintance, to say nothing of the many men whom she had refused, mockedher so bitterly, asking her when the fine wedding was to be, with many otherjeers and sneers, that at last in a moment of madness she went to the top of ahigh tower, whence she cast herself; and to make it worse, there was below aterrible ravine {baha), into which she fell.Yet she took no harm, for as she fell there appeared to her a very beautifulwoman, truly not of earth, wb~took her by the hand and bore her through the air to a safe place.Then ail the people round about who saw or heard of this thing cried out, \" Lo, a"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"miracle ! \" and they came and made a great festival, and would fain persuadeRorasa that she had been saved by the Madonna.But the lady who had saved her, coming to her secretly, said; \"If thou hast anydesire, follow the Gospel of Diana, or what is called the Gospel of the Witches(// Vangelo dtlU Strege), who worship the\" Se la Luna adorerai Tutto tu otterai.\"\" If thou adorest Luua, then What thou desir'st thou shait obtain!\"Then the beautiful girl went forth alone by night to the fields, and kneeling on astone in an old ruin, she worshipped the moon and invoked Diana thus:—Diana, bella Diana!Tu che della grande cadutaMi ai bene salvata !Ti prego di farmi una altra grazia,Di farmi far' un belio sposalizio,Una sposalizio ricco e 'compagnatoDa molte signore . . .Se questa grazia mi faraiSempre il Vangelo delle Stregelo asseriro.Diana, beautiful Diana. 1 Thou who didst save from a dreadful death When I didfall into the dark ravine!

Then there appeared tenyoung ladies, all splendidly attired, and with them and many distinguishedpersons she went to the church in a carriage. And all the streets were filled withmusic and people bearing flowers.So she found the bridegroom, and was wedded to her heart's desire, ten timesmore graridly than she had ever dreamed of. Then, after the ceremony, therewas spread a feast at which all the nobility of Cettardo were present, and,moreover, the whole town, rich and poor, were feasted.When the wedding was finished, the bridesmaids made every one a magnificentpresent to the bride— one gave diamonds, another a parchment (written) ingold, after which they asked permission to go all together into the sacristy. Andthere they remained for some hours undisturbed, till the priest sent his chiericotoinquire whether they wanted anything. But what was the youth's amazement atbeholding, not the ten bridesmaids, but their ten images or hkenesses in woodand in terra-cotta, with that of Djana standing on a moon, and they were all somagnificently made and adorned as to be of immense va!ue.Therefore the priest put these images into the church, which is the most ancientin Cettardo, and now in many churches you may see the Madonna and Moon,but it is Diana— la Dea della Luna. The name Rorasa seems to indicate the Latinros the dew, rorare, to bedew, rorulenta, bedewed—in fact, the goddess of thedew. Her great fall and being lifted by Diana suggest the fall of dew by night, andits rising in vapour under the influence of the moon. It is possible that this is avery old Latin mythic tale.

Lb LAND,The following story does not belong to the Gospel of the Witches, but I add it asit confirms the fact that the worship of Diana existed for a long timecontemporary with Christianity. Its full title in the orginal MS., which waswritten out by Maddalena, after hearing it from a man who was a native ofVolterra, is La Pellegrirui della Casa al Venta —\" The Female Pilgrim of theHouse of the Wind.\" It may be added that, as the tale declares, the house inquestion is still standing.There is a peasant's house at the beginning of the hill or ascent leading toVolterra, and it is called the House of the Wind. Near it there once stood a smallpalace, wherein dwelt a married couple, who had but one child, a daughter,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"whom they adored. Truly if the child had but a headache, they each had a worseattack from fear.Little by httle the girl grew older, and all the thought of the mother, who wasvery devout, was that she should become a nun. But the girl did not like this,and declared that she hoped to be married like others. And when looking fromher window one day, she saw and heard the birds singing in the vines andamong the trees all so merrily, she said to her mother that she hoped some dayto have a family of little birds of her own, singing round her in a cheerful nest Atwhich the mother was so angry that she gave her daughter a cuff. And the younglady wept, but replied with spirit, that if beaten or treated in any such manner,that she would certainly soon find some way to escape and get married, for shehad no idea of being made a nun of against her will.At hearing this the mother was seriously frightened, for she knew the spirit ofher child, and was afraid lest the girl already had a lover, and would make a greatscandal over the blow ; and turning it all over, she thought of an elderly lady ofgood family, but much reduced, who was famous for her intelligence, learning,and power of persuasion, and she thought, \"This will be just the person toinduce my daughter to become pious, and fill her head with devotion and mate an of her.\" So she sent for this clever person, who was at once appointed thegoverness and constant attendant of the young lady, who, instead of quarrellingwith her guardian, became devoted to her."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF THE WINDHowever, everything in this world does not go exactly as we would have it, andno one knows what fish or crab may hide under a rock in a river. For it sohappened that the governess was not a Catholic at all, as will presently appear,and did not vex her pupil with any threats of a nun's life, nor even with anapproval of it.It came to pass that the young lady, who was in the habit of lying awake onmoonlight nights to hear the nightingales sing, thought she heard her governessin the next room, of which the door was open, rise and go forth on the greatbalcony, The next night the same thing took place, and rising very softly andunseen, she beheld the lady praying, or at least kneeling in the moonlight, whichseemed to her to be very singular conduct, the more so because the ladykneeling uttered words which the younger could not understand, and whichcertainly formed no part of the Church service.And being much exercised over the strange occurrence, she at last, with timidexcuses, told her governess what she had seen. Then the latter, after a litdereflection, first binding her to a secrecy of life and death, for, as she declared, itwas a matter of great peril, spoke as follows:—\" I, like thee, was instructed when young by priests to worship an invisible god.But an old woman in whom I had great confidence once said to me, ' Why"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"worship a deity whom you cannot see, when there is the Mood in all hersplendour visible ?

But the mother, who was far more bent on gratifyingvindictiveness and cruel vanity than on her daughter's happiness, was infuriatedat this, and when the gentleman came to her, she bade him begone, for herdaughter was vowed to become a nun, and a nun she should be or die.Then the young lady was shut up in a cell in a tower, without even the companyof her governess, and put to strong and hard pain, being made to sleep on thestone floor, and would have 'died of hunger had her mother had her way.Then in this dire need she prayed to Diana to set her free; when lo! she foundthe prison door unfastened, and easily escaped. Then having obtained a pilgrim'sdress, she travelled far and wide, teaching and preaching the religion of oldtimes, the religion of Diana, the Queen of the Fairies and of the Moon, thegoddess of the poor and the oppressed.And the fame of her wisdom and beauty went forth over all the land, and peopleworshipped her, calling her La Bella Pdkgrina. At last her mother, hearing of her,' This incarnation is given in Ihe chapter enlilled \"A Spell loTHE HOUSE OF THE WINDwas in a greater rage than ever, and, in fine, after much trouble, succeeded inhaving her again arrested and cast into prison.

The gods hadreplied to the prayer.The young lady escaped happily with her lover, wedded him, and the house ofthe peasant where the lady stood is still called La Casa al Vento, or the House ofthe Wind.This is very accurately the story as I received it, but I freely admit that 1 havevery much condensed the language of the original text, which consists of twentypages, and which, as regards needless padding, indicates a capacity on the part ofthe narrator to write an average modern fashionable novel, even a second-rateFrench one, which is saying a great deal. It is true that there are in it no detailed"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"descriptions of scenery, skies, trees, or clouds—and a great deal might be madeof Volterra in that way—but it is prolonged in a manner which shows a gift for it.However, the narrative itself is strangely original and vigorous, for it is such arelic of pure classic heathenism, and such a survival of faith in the oldmythology, as all the reflected second-hand Hellenism of the .(Esthetes cannotequal. That a real worship of or belief in classic divinities should have survivedto the present day in the very land of Papacy itself, is a much more curious factthan if a living mammoth had been discovered in some out of the way corner ofthe earth, because the former is a human phenomenon. I foreseethat the day will come, and that perhaps not so very far distant, when the worldof scholars will be amazed to consider to what a late period an immense body ofantique tradition survived in Northern Italy, and how indifferent the learnedwere regarding it; there having been in very truth only one man, and he aforeigner, who earnestly occupied himself with collecting and preserving it.It is very probable that there were as many touching episodes among theheathen martyrs who were forced to give up their beloved deities, such as Diana,Venus, the Graces, and others, who were worshipped for beauty, as there wereeven among the Christians who were thrown to the lions. For the heathen lovedtheir gods with a human personal sympathy, without mysticism or fear, as ifthey had been blood-relations; and there were many among them who reallybelieved that such was the case when some damsel who had made a faux pas gotout of it by attributing it all to some god, faun, or satyr; which is very touching.There is a great deal to be said for as well as against the idolaters or worshippersof dolls, as I heard a small girl define them.CHAPTER XIITANA, THE MOON-GODDESSThe following story, which appeared originally in the Legends of Florence,collected from the people by me, does not properly belong to the Witch's Gospel,as it is not strictly in accordance with it; and yet it could not well be omitted,since it is on the same subject. In it Diana appears simply as the lunar goddessof chastity, therefore not as a witch. It was given to me as Fana, but myinformant said that it might be Tana; she was not sure. As Tana occurs inanother tale, and as the subject is certainly Diana, there can hardly be a questionof this."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Tana, la Dea delta Luna.Tana was a very beautiful girl, but extremely poor, and as modest and pure asshe was beautiful and humble. She went from one contadino to another, or fromfarm to farm to work, and thus ted an honest life.There was a young boor, a very ugly, bestial, and brutish fellow, who was afterhis fashion raging with love for her, but she could not so much as bear to look athim, and repelled all his advances.But late one night, when she was returning alone from the farmhouse where shehad worked to her home, this man, who had hidden himself in a thicket, leapedout on her and cried, \"Non mi sfuggerai; sara mia!\" — \" Thou canst not flee;mine thou shalt be I\"And seeing no help near, and only the full moon looking down on her fromheaven. Tana in duspair cast herself on het knees and cried to it :— \" I have noone on earth to defend me, Thou alone dost see me in this strait; Therefore Ipray to thee, O Moon! As thou art beautiful so thou art bright. Flashing thysplendour over all mankind ; Even so I pray thee light up the mind Of this poorruffian, who would wrong me here, Even to the worst. Cast light into his soul,That he may let me be in peace, and then Return in all thy light unto my home!\"When she had said this, there appeared before her a bright but shadowy form—una ontbra bianca —which said;—\" Rise, and go to thy home!Thou hast well deserved this grace;No one shall trouble thee more,Purest of all on earth !Thou shalt a goddess be,The Goddess of the Moon,Of all enchantment queen ! \"Thus it came to spirit of the Moon."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"pass that Tana became the dta orARADIAThough the air be set to a different key, this is a poem of pure melody, and thesame as Wordsworth's \"Goody Blake and Harry Gill.\" Both Tana and the olddame are surprised and terrified; both pray to a power above :—\" The cold, cold moon above her head. Thus on her knees did Goody pray; YoungHarry heard what she had said, And icy cold he turned away.\"The dramatic centre is just the same in both. The English ballad soberly turnsinto an incurable fit of ague inflicted on a greedy young boor ; the Italian witch-poetess, with finer sense, or with more sympathy for the heroine, casts the bruteaside without further mention, and apotheo-sises the maiden, identifying herwith the Moon. The former is more practical and probable, the latter morepoetical.And here it is worth while, despite digression, to remark what an immensemajority there are of people who can perceive, feel, and value poetry in merewords or ybrw—that is to say, objectively—and hardly know or note it when it iapresented subjectively or as thought, but not put into some kind of verse ormeasure, or regulated form. This is a curious experiment and worth studying.Take a passage from some famous poet; write it out in pure simple prose.doing full justice to its real meaning, and if it still actually thrills or moves aspoetry, then it is of the first class. But if it has lost its glamour absolutely, it issecond-rate or inferior; for the best cannot be made out of mere wordsvarnished with associations, be they of thought or feeling.This is not such a far cry from the subject as might be deemed. Reading andfeeling them subjectively, 1 am often struck by the fact that in these Witchtraditions which 1 have gathered there is a wondrous poetry of thought, whichfar excels the efforts of many modern bards, and which only requires the aid ofsome clever workman in words to assume the highest rank. A proof of what Ihave asserted may be found in the fact that, in such famous poems as theFinding of the Lyre, by James Russell Lowell, and that on the invention of thepipe by Pan, by Mrs. Browning, that which formed the most exquisite andrefined portion of the original myths is omitted by both authors, simply becausethey missed or did not perceive it. For in the former we are not told that it was"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the breathing of the god Air (who was the inspiring soul of ancient music, andthe Bellaria of modern witch-mythology) on the dried filament of the tortoise,which suggested to Hermes the making an instrument wherewith he made themusic of the spheres and guided the course of the planets. As for Mrs.Browning, she leaves out Syrinx altogether, that is to say, the voice of the nymphstill lingering in the pipe which had been her body. Now to my mind the oldprose narrative of these myths is much more deeply poetical and moving, andfar more inspired with beauty and romance, than are the well-rhymed andmeasured, but very imperfect versions given by our poets. And in fact, such wantof intelligence or perception may be found in all the \"classic\" poems, not only ofKeats, but of almost every poet of the age who has dealt in Greek subjects.Great license is allowed to painters and poets, but when they take a subject,especially a deep tradition, and fail to perceive its real jneaning or catch itspoint, and simply give us something very pretty, but not so inspired withmeaning as the original, it can hardly be claimed that they have done their workas it might, or, in fact, should have been done. I find that this fault does notoccur in the Italian or Tuscan witch-versions of the ancient fables; on thecontrary, they keenly appreciate, and even expand, the antique spirit. Hence 1have often had occasion to remark that it was not impossible that in some casespopular tradition, even as it now exists, has been preserved more fully andaccurately than we find it in any Latin writer.Now apropos of missing the point, 1 wouldtWa, the moon-goddess 'remind certain very literal readers that if they find many faults of grammar, mis-spelling, and worse in the Italian texts in this book, they will not, as adistinguished reviewer has done, attribute them all to the ignorance of theauthor, but to the imperfect education of the person who collected and recordedthem. I am reminded of this by having seen in a circulating library a copy of myLegends of Florence, in which some good careful soul had taken pains with apencil to correct all the archaisms. Wherein he or she was like a certain Bostonproof-reader, who in a book of mine changed the spelling of many citations fromChaucer, Spenser, and others into the purest, or impurest, Webster; he beingunder the impression that I was extremely ignorant of orthography.

Sometimes visible manifestations, as, forinstance, lightning, are requested. To see a white horse is a sign that the prayerwill be granted after some delay. It also signifies tiictory.And having taught them this, Virgil departed.Then the children ran to tell their patents all that had happened, and the latterimpressed it on them to keep it a secret, nor breathe a word or hint thereof toany one.

Diana is declared to be the protectress of all outcasts, those to whom thenight is their day, consequently of thieves; and Lavema, as we may learn fromHorace {Epistles, i6, i) and Plautus, was preeminently the patroness of pilferingand all rascality. In this story she also appears as a witch and humourist.It was given to me as a tradition of Virgil, who often appears as one familiar withthe marvellous and hidden lore of the olden time.It happened on a time that Virgil, who knew all things hidden or magical, hewho was a magician and poet, having heard a speech (or oration) by a famoustalker who had not much in him, was asked what he thought of it ? And hereplied:—\"It seems to me to be impossible to tell whether it was all introduction or allconclusion; certainly thereARADIAwas no body in it. It was like certain fish of whom one is in doubt whether theyare all head or all tail, or only head and tail; or the goddess Lavema, of whom noone ever knew whether she was all head or all body, or neither or both.\"Then the emperor inquired who this deity might be, for he had never heard ofher.And Virgil replied :—\"Among the gods or spirits who were of ancient times—may they be everfavourable to us 1 Among them (was) one female who was the craftiest andmost knavish of them all. She was called Laverna. She was a thief, and very littleknown to the other deities, who were honest and dignified, for she was rarely inheaven or in the country of the fairies."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"\"She was almost always on earth, among thieves, pickpockets, and panders—shelived in darkness.\" Once it happened that she went (to a mortal), a great priest in the form andguise of a very beautiful stately priestess (of some goddess), and said to him:—\"' You have an estate which I wish to buy. I intend to build on it a temple to(oui) God. I swear to you on my body that I will pay thee within a year.'\" Therefore the priest transferred to her the estate.\" And very soon Lavema had sold off all the crops, grain, cattle, wood, andpoultry. There was not left the value of four farthings.\"But on the day fixed for payment there was noLavtma to be seen. The fair goddess was far away, and had left her creditor inasso —in the lurch !\" At the same time Lavema went to a great lord and bought of him a castle, well-furnished within and broad rich lands without.\" But this time she swore on her head to pay in full in six months.\"And as she had done by the priest, so she acted to the lord of the castle, andstole and sold every stick, furniture, cattle, men, and mice—there was not leftwherewith to feed a fly.\" Then the priest and the lord, finding out who this was, appealed to the gods,complaining that they had been robbed by a goddess.\" And it was soon made known to them alt that this was Lavema.\"Therefore she was called to judgment before all the gods,\" And when she was asked what she had done with the property of the priest,unto whom she had sworn by her body to make payment at the time appointed(and why had she broken her oath) ?\" She replied by a strange deed which amazed them all, for she made her bodydisappear, so that only her head remained visible, and it cried :—"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\"' Behold me! 1 swore by my body, but body have I none!'\"Then all the gods laughed.\" After the priest came the lord who had also been tricked, and to whom she hadsworn by her head. And in reply to him Lavtma showed to all present her wholebody without mincing matters, and it was one of extreme beauty, but without ahead; and from the neck thereof came a voice which said:—' Behold me, for I am Laverna, who Have come to answer to that lord'scomplaint, Who swears that I contracted debt to him, And have not paidalthough the time is o'er, And that I am a thief because I swore Upon my head —but, as you all can see, I have no head at all, and therefore I Assuredly ne'erswore by such au oath.'\"Then there was indeed a storm of laughter among the gods, who made thematter right by ordering the head to join the body, and bidding Laverna pay upher debts, which she did.\" Then Jove spoke and said:—\"' Here is a roguish goddess without a duty (or a worshipper), while there are inRome innumerable thieves, sharpers, cheats, and rascals^— ladri, bindolini,Iruffafori e scrocconi —who live by deceit.\" ' These good folk have neither a church nor a god, and it is a great pity, for eventhe very devils have their master, Satan, as the head of the family. Therefore, Icommand that in future Laverna shall be the goddess of all the knaves ordishonest tradesmen, with the whole rubbish and refuse of the human race, whohave been hitherto without a god or a devil, inasmuch as they have been toodespicable for the one or the other.'k 93\" And so Lavema became the goddess of all dishonest and shabby people.\"Whenever any one planned or intended any knavery or aught wicked, heentered her temple, and invoked Lavema, who appeared to him as a woman'shead.

This is quite classic, i.e., Graeco-Roraan or Oriental, in all ofwhich' sources the magician relies not on favour, aid, or power granted by eitherGod or Satan, but simply on what he has been able to wrench and wring, as itwere, out of infinite nature or the primal source by penance andstudy, I mention this because a reviewer has reproached me with exaggeratingthe degree to which diabolism —introduced by the Church since 1500—isdeficient in Italy. But in fact, among the higher class of witches, or in theirtraditions, it is hardly to be found at alL In Christian diabolism the witch neverdares to threaten Satan or God, or any of the Trinity or angels, for the wholesystem is based on the conception of a Church and of obedience.The herb concordia probably takes its name from that of the goddess Concordia,who was represented as holding a branch.

In this I was for a time disappointed. But"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"having urged it on Maddalena, my collector of folk-lore, while she was leading awandering life in Tuscany, to make an effort to obtain or recover something ofthe kind, 1 at last received from her, on January r, 1897, from Colle, Vai d'EIsa,near Siena, the MS. entitled Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches.Now be it observed, that every leading point which forms the plot or centre ofthis Vangel, such as that Diana is Queen of the Witches ; an associate ofHerodias {^Aradia) in her relations to sorcery; that she bore a child to herbrother the Sun (here Lucifer); that as a moon-goddess she is in some relationto Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and thatthe witches of old were people oppressed by feudal lands, the former revengingthemselves in every way, and holding orgies to Diana which the Churchrepresented as being the worship of Satan—all of this, I repeat, had been told orwritten out for me in fragments by Maddalena (not to speak of otherauthorities), even as it had been chronicled by Horst or Michelet; therefore allthis is in the present document of minor importance. All of this I expected, butwhat I did not expect, and what was new to me, was that portion which is givenas prose-poetry and which I have rendered in metre or verse. This beingtraditional, and taken down from wizards, is extremely curious and interesting,since in it are preserved many relics of lore which, as may be verified fromrecords, have come down from days of yore.Aradia is evidently enough Herodias, who was regarded in the beginning asassociated with Diana as chief of the witches. This was not, as I opine, derivedfrom the Herodias of the New Testament, but from an earlier replica of Lilith,bearing the same name. It is, in fact, an identification or twin-ing of the Aryanand Shemitic Queens of Heaven, or of Night and of Sorcery, and it may be thatthis was known to the earliest myth-makers. So far back as the sixth century theworship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemnedby a Church Council at Ancyra. Pipernus and other writers have noted theevident identity gf Herodias with Lilith. his preceded both.Diana is very vigorously, even dramatically, set forth in this poem as the goddessof the god-forsaken and ungodly, of thieves, harlots, and, truthfully enough, ofthe \"minions of the moon,\" as Falstaff would have fain had them called. It wasrecognised in ancient Rome, as it is in modern India, that no human being canbe so bad or vile as to have forfeited all right to divine protection of some kind"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"or other, and Diana was this protectress. It may be as well to observe here, thatamong all free-thinking philosophers, educated parias, and literary or book-Bohemians, there has ever been a most unorthodox tendency to believe that thefaults and errors of humanity are more due (if not altogether due) tounavoidable causes which we cannot help, as, for instance, heredity, the beingborn savages, or poor, or in vice, or unto \"bigotry and virtue\" in excess, or untoinquisi-tioning—that is to say, when we are so overburdened with innately bornsin that all our free will cannot set us free from it.'It was during the so-called Dark Ages, or from the downfall of the RomanEmpire until the thirteenth century, that the belief that all' Hence the saying th>t to know all would be to forgive all; wbich may be nine-Ienths tiue, but there is > tenth of responsiblewhich was worst in man owed its origin solely to the monstrous abuses andtyranny of Church and State. For then, at every turn in life, the vast majorityencountered downright shameless, palpable iniquity and injustice, with no lawfor the weak who were without patrons.The perception of this drove vast numbers of the discontented into rebellion,and as they could not prevail by open warfare, they took their hatred out in aform of secret anarchy, which was, however, intimately blended withsuperstition and fragments of old tradition. Prominent in this, and naturallyenough, was the worship of Diana the protectress—for the alleged adoration ofSatan was a far later invention of the Church, and it has never really found aleading place in Italian witchcraft to this day. That is to say, purely diabolicalwitchcraft did not find general acceptance till the end of the fifteenth century,when it was, one may almost say, invented in Rome to supply means wherewithto destroy the threatening heresy of Gei-many.The growth of Sentiment is the increase of suffering; man is never entirelymiserable until he finds out how wronged he is and fancies that he sees farahead a possible freedom. In ancient times men as slaves suffered less undereven more abuse, because they believed they were born to low conditions of life.Even the best reform brings pain with it, and the great awaken-jng of man was accompanied with griefs, many of which even yet endure.Pessimism is the result of too much culture and introversion."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"It appears to be strangely out of sight and out of mind with all historians, thatthe sufferings of the vast majority of mankind, or the enslaved and poor, werefar greater under early Christianity, or till the end of the Middle Ages and theEmancipation of Serfs, than they were before. The reason for this was that in theold \"heathen\" time the humble did not know, or even dream, that all are equalbefore God, or that they had many rights, even here on earth, as slaves; for, infact, the whole moral tendency of the New Testament is utterly opposed toslavery, or even severe servitude. Every word uttered teaching Christ's mercyand love, humility and charity, was, in fact, a bitter reproof, not only to everylord in the land, but to the Church itself, and its arrogant prelates. The fact thatmany abuses had been mitigated and that there were benevolent saints, does notaffect the fact that, on the whole, mankind was for a long time worse off thanbefore, and the greatest cause of this suffering was what may be called asentimental one, or a newly-born consciousness of rights withheld, which isalways of itself a torture. And this was greatly aggravated by the endlesspreaching to the people that it was a duty to suffer and endure oppression andtyranny, and that the rights of Authority of all kinds wereAPPENDIXso great that they on the whole even excused their worst abuses. For byupholding Authority in the nobility the Church maintained its own.The result of it all was a vast development of rebels, outcasts, and all thediscontented, who adopted witchcraft or sorcery for a religion, and wizards astheir priests. They had secret meetings in desert places, among old ruinsaccursed by priests as the haunt of evil spirits or ancient heathen gods, or in themountains. To this day the dweller in Italy may often find secluded spotsenvironed by ancient chestnut forests, rocks, and walls, which suggest fit placesfor the Sabbat, and are sometimes still believed by tradition to be such. And Ialso believe that in this Gospel of the Witches we have a trustworthy outline atleast of the doctrine and rites observed at these meetings. They adoredforbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by rebellionagainst Society as by their own passions.There is, however, in the Evangel of the Witches an effort made to distinguishbetween the naturally wicked or corrupt and those who are outcasts oroppressed, as appears from the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"\" Yet like Cain's daughter (offspring) thou shall never be.

The moon or horn-shapedcakes are still common, I have eaten of them this very day, and though they areknown all over the world, I believe they owe their fashion to tradition.In the conjuration of the meal there is a very curious tradition introduced to theeffect that the spige or glittering grains of wheat from which spikes shoot likesun-rays, owe their brilliant likeness to a resemblance to the firefly, \"who comesto give them light.\" We have, 1 doubt not, in this a classic tradition, but I cannotverify it. Hereupon the Vangelo cites a common nursery-rhyme, which may alsobe found in a nursery-tale, yet which, like others, is derived from witch-lore, bywhich the lucciola is put under a glass and conjured to give by its light certainanswers.The conjuration of the meal or bread, as being literally our body as contributingto form it, and deeply sacred because it had lain in the earth, where dark andwondrous secrets bide, seems to cast a new light on the Christian sacrament. Itis a type of resurrection from the earth, and was therefore used at the Mysteriesand Holy Supper, and the grain had pertained to chtkonic secrets, or to what hadbeen under the earth in darkness. Thus even earth-worms are invoked inmodern witchcraft as familiarAPPENDIXwith dark mysteries, and the shepherd's pipe to win the Orphic power must beburied three days in the earth. And so all was, and is, in sorcery a kind of wildpoetry based on symbols, all blending into one another, light and darkness, fire-Sies and grain, hfe and death.Very strange indeed, but very strictly according to ancient magic as described byclassic authorities, is the threatening Diana, in case she will not grant a prayer.This recurs continually in the witch-exorcisms or spelts. The magus, or witch,worships the spirit, but claims to have the right, drawn from a higher power, tocompel even the Queen of Earth, Heaven, and Hell to grant the request, \" Giveme what I ask, and thou shalt have honour and offerings; refuse, and I will vexthee by insult.\" So Canidia and her kind boasted that they could compel the gods"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"to appear. This is all classic. No one ever heard of a Satanic witch invoking orthreatening the Trinity, or Christ or even the angels or saints. In fact, theycannot even compel the devil or his imps to obey—they work entirely by hisgood-will as slaves. But in the old Italian lore the sorcerer or witch is all ornothing, and aims at limitless will or power.Of the ancient belief in the virtues of a perforated stone I need not speak. But itis to be remarked that in the invocation the witch goes forth in the earliestmorning to seek for verbena or vervain. The ancient Persian magi, or rathertheir daughters, worshipped the sun as it rose by waving freshly pluckedverbena,' which was one of the seven most powerful plants in magic. ThesePersian priestesses were naked while they thus worshipped, nudity being asymbol of truth and sincerity.The extinguishing the lights, nakedness, and the orgie, were regarded assymbolical of the body being laid in the ground, the grain being planted, or ofentering into darkness and death, to be revived in new forms, or regenerationand light. It was the laying aside of daily life.The Gospel of the Witches, as 1 have given it, is in reality only the initial chapterof the collection of ceremonies, \"cantrips,\" incantations, and traditions currentin the fraternity or sisterhood, the whole of which are in the main to be found inmy Etruscan Roman Remains and Florentine Legends. 1 have, it is true, a greatnumber as yet unpublished, and there are more ungathered, but the wholescripture of this sorcery, all its principal tenets, formulas, medicaments, andmysteries may be found in what I have collected and printed. Yet I would urgethat it would be worth while to arrange and edit it all into one work, because itwould be to every student of archteology, folk-lore, or history of great value. Ithas been the faith of millions in the past; it has made itself felt in innumerabletraditions, which deserve to be better understood than they are, and 1 wouldgladly undertake the ' Friedrich, Symbelik, p. 2S3.Appendixwork if I believed that the public would make it worth the publisher's outlay andpains.It may be observed with truth that I have not treated this Gospel, nor even thesubject of witchcraft, entirely as folk-lore, as the word is strictly defined and"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"carried out; that is, as a mere traditional fact or thing to be chiefly regarded as avariant like or unlike sundry other traditions, or to be tabulated and put away inpigeon-holes for reference.

But there is this to be said—and 1 have observedthat here and there a few genial minds are beginning to awake to it —that themere study of the letter in this way has developed a great indifference to thespirit, going in many cases so far as to produce, like Realism in Art (to which itis allied), even a contempt for the matter or meaning of it, as originally believedin. ^I was lately much struck by the fact that in a very learned work on Music, theauthor, in discussing that of ancient times and of the East, while extremelyaccurate and minute in determining pentatonic and all other scales, and whatmay be called the mere machinery and history of composition, showed that hewas utterly ignorant of the fundamental fact that notes and chords, bars andmelodies, were in themselves ideas or thoughts. Thus Confucius is said to havecomposed a melody which was a personal description of himself. Now if this benot understood, we cannot understand the soul of early music, and the foik-lorist who cannot get beyond the letter and fancies himself \"scientific\" is exactlylike the musician who has no idea of how or why melodies were ancientlycomposed.The strange and mystical chapter \" How Diana made the Stars and the Rain\" isthe same given in my Legends of Florence, vol. ii. p. 229, but much enlarged, ordeveloped to 2 cosmogonic- mythologic sketch. And here a reflection occurswhich is perhaps the most remarkable which all this Witch Evangel suggests. Inall other Scriptures of all races, it is the male, Jehovah, Buddha, or Brahma, whocreates the universe ; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitiveprinciple. Whenever in history there is a period of radical intellectual rebellionagainst long-established conservatism, hierarchy, and the like, there is always aneffort to regard Woman as the fully equal, which means the superior sex. Thusin the extraordinary war of conflicting elements, strange schools of sorcery,Neo-Plafonism, Cabala, Heretic Christianity, Gnosticism, Persian Magism andDualism, with the remains of old Greek and Egyptian theologies in the third andfourth centuries at Alexandria, and in the House of Light of Cairo in the ninth,the equality of Woman was a prominent doctrine. It was Sophia or Helena, theenfranchised,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"APPENDIXwho was then the true Christ who was to save mankind.When Illumination or Illumin4-ism, in company with magic and mysticism, anda resolve to regenerate society according to extreme free-thought, inspired theTemplars to the hope that they would master the Church and the world, theequality of Woman, derived from the Cairene traditions, again receivedattention. And it may be observed that during the Middle Ages, and even so lateas the intense excitements which inspired the French Huguenots, the Jansenistsand the Anabaptists, Woman always came forth more prominently or played afar greater part than she had done in social or political life. This was also thecase in the Spiritualism founded by the Fox sisters of Rochester, New York, andit is manifesting itself in many ways in the Fin de Steele, which is also a nervouschaos according to Nordau, — Woman being evidently a fish who shows herselfmost when the waters are troubled:—\" Oh, Woman, in our hours of ease ! \"The reader will remember the rest. But we should also remember that in theearlier ages the vast majority of mankind itself, suppressed by the too great orgreatly abused power of Church and State, only manifested itself at such periodsof rebellion against forms or ideas grown old. And with every new rebellion,every freshAPPENDIXoutburst or debAcU or wild inundation and bursting over the barriers, humanityand woman gain something, that is to say, their just dues or rights. For as everyfreshet spreads more widely its waters over the fields, which are in due time themore fertilised thereby, so the world at large gains by every Revolution, howeverterrible or repugnant it may be for a time.The Emancipated or Woman's Rights woman, when too enthusiastic, generallyconsiders man as limited, while Woman is destined to gain on him. In earlierages a contrary opinion prevailed, and both are, or were, apparently in the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"wrong, so far as the future is concerned. For in truth both sexes are progressive,and progress in this respect means not a conflict of the male and femaleprinciple, such as formed the basis of the Maka-barata, but a gradualascertaining of true ability and adjustment of relations or co-ordination ofpowers—in doing which on a scientific basis all conflict ceases.These remarks are appropriate to my text and subject, because it is in studyingthe epochs when woman has made herself prominent and influential that welearn what the capacities of the female sex truly are. Among these, that ofWitchcraft as it truly was—not as it is generally quite misunderstood—-is asdeeply interesting as any other. For the Witch —laying aside all question as tomagic or its non-existence—was once a real factor or great power in rebeUiousAPPENDIXsocial life, and to this very day—as most novels bear witness—it is recognisedthat there is something uncanny, mysterious, and incomprehensible in woman,which neither she herself nor man can explain,\" For every woman is at heart a witch.\"We have banished the broom and the cat and the working miracles, the Sabbatand pacts with Satan, but the mystery or puzzle is as great as ever; no one livingknows to what it is destined to lead. Are not the charms of love of every kind,and the enjoyment of beauty in all its forms in nature, mysteries, miracles, ormagical ?To all who are interested in this subject of woman's influence and capacity, thisEvangel of the Witches will be of value as showing that there have been strangethinkers who regarded creation as a feminine development or parthenogenesisfrom which the masculine principle vpas born, Lucifer, or Light, lay hidden inthe darkness of Diana, as heat is hidden in ice. But the regenerator or Messiahof this strange doctrine is a woman— Aradia, though the two, mother anddaughter, are confused or reflected in the different tales, even as Jakveh isconfused with the Elohim,\"Remains to be said\"—that the Adam-nable and Eve-il, or Adamite assemblagesenjoined in the Gospel of Sorcery, are not much, if at all,APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"kept up by the now few and far between old or young witches and venerablewizards of the present day. That is to say, not to my knowledge in Central orNorthern Italy. But among the rowA, viveurs, and fast women of Florence andMilan—where they are not quite as rare as eclipses—such assemblies are calledbalH angelici or angels' balls. They are indeed far from being unknown in any ofthe great cities of the world. A few years ago a Sunday newspaper in anAmerican city published a detailed account of them in the \"dance-houses\" of thetown, declaring that they were of very frequent occurrence, which was furtherverified to me by men familiar with them.A very important point to all who regard the finds or discoveries of ancienttradition as of importance, is that a deep and extensive study of the Italianwitch-traditions which 1 have collected, a comparison of them one with theother, and of the whole with what resembles it in the writings of Ovid and othermythologists, force the conviction (which I have often expressed, but not toofrequently) that there are in these later records many very valuable and curiousremains of ancient Latin or Etruscan lore, in all probability entire poems, tales,and invocations which have passed over from the ancient tongue. If this be true,and when it shall come to pass that scholars will read with interest what is heregiven, then most assuredly there will be critical examinationand veri6cation of what is ancient in it, and it will be discovered what marvels oftradition stilt endure.That the witches even yet form a fragmentary secret society or sect, that theycall it that of the Old Religion, and that there are in the Romagna entire villagesin which the people are completely heathen, and almost entirely governed bySetti-mani or \" seven months' children,\" may be read in the novel of that name,as well as several papers published in divers magazines, or accepted from myown personal knowledge. The existence of a religion supposes a Scripture, andin this case it may be admitted, almost without severe verification, that theEvangel of the Witches is really a very old work. Thus it is often evident thatwhere a tradition has been taken down from verbal delivery, the old womanrepeats words or sentences by whole chapters which she does not fullyunderstand, but has heard and learned. These are to be verified by correlation orcomparison with other tales and texts. Now considering all this most carefullyand critically, or severely yet impartially, no one can resist the conviction that inthis Gospel of the Witches we have a book which is in all probability thetranslation of some early or later Latin work, since it seems most probable that"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"every fixed faith finds its record. There are literary men among the Pariahs ofIndia ; there were probably many among the minions of the moon, or nocturnalworshippers of Diana. In fact, 1 am not without hope that research may yetreveal in the writings of some long-forgotten heretic or mystic of the dark agesthe parallel of many passages in this text, if not the whole of it.Yet a few years, reader, and all this will have vanished from among the Italiansbefore the newspaper and railroad, even as a light cloud is driven before a gale,or pass away like snow-flakes in a pond. Old traditions are, in fact, disappearingwith such incredible rapidity that 1 am assured on best authority—and canindeed see for myself—that what I collected or had recorded for me ten yearsago in the Romagna Toscana, with exceptionably skilful aid, could not now begathered at all by anybody, since it no longer exists, save in the memories of afew old sorcerers who are daily disappearing, leaving no trace behind. It is going—going— it is all but gone; in fact, I often think that, old as I am (and I amtwelve years beyond the Umit of extreme old age as defined by the Duke ofMarlborough in his defence), I shall yet live to hear the rap of the auctioneerTime as he bids off the last real Latin sorcerer to Death I It may be that he ispassing in his checks even as I write. The women or witches, having morevitality, will last a little longer—I mean the traditional kind ; for as regardsinnate natural dev-elopment of witchcraft and pure cus-tom, we shall alwayshave with us sorceresses, evenas we shall have the poor—until we all go up together.What is very remarkable, even to the being difficult to understand, is the factthat so much antique tradition survived with so httle change among thepeasantry. But legends and spells in families of hereditary witches are far morehkejy to live than fashions in art, yet even the latter have been kept since 2000years. Thus, as E. Neville Rolfe writes: \"The late Signer Castellani, who was thefirst to reproduce with fidelity the jewellery found in the tombs of Etruria andGreece, made up his mind that some survival of this ancient and exquisite trademust still exist somewhere in Italy. He accordingly made diligent search . . . andin an out of the way village discovered goldsmiths who made ornaments for thepeasants, which in their character indicated a strong survival of early Etruscanart.\" ^' I am here reminded, by a strange coincidence, Ihal I having rediscovered the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"very ancient and iost art of the Chinese how to make bottles or vases on whichinscriptions, &c., appeared when wine was poured into them, communicated thediscovery on the ipot where I made it to the brother o( Sifinor Castellani; SirAustin Layard, who had sent for him to hear and judge of it, being present,Signor Castellani the younger was overseer of the glass-works at Murano, inwhich I mode the discovery. Signor Castellani said thai he had read of theseChinese vases, and always regarded the story as a fable or impossil>le, but thatthey could be made perfectly by my process, adding, however, that they wouldcost too much to make it profitable. I admit that I have little faith in lost artsbeyond recoveiing. Described in my book (unpublished) on the Hundrtd MiimrArts.And here I would remark, that where I have written perhaps a little too bitterlyof the in-diiference of scholars to the curious traditions preserved by wizardsand witches, I refer to Rome, and especially to Northern Italy. G. Pitri did allthat was possible for one man as regards the South. Since the foregoing chapterswere written, I received Naples in the Nineties, by E. Neville Rolfe, B.A., inwhich a deep and intelligent interest in the subject is well supported byextensive knowledge. What will be to the reader of my book particularlyinteresting is the amount of information which Mr. Rolfe gives regarding theconnection of Diana with witchcraft, and how many of her attributes becamethose of the Madonna. \"The worship of Diana,\" as he says, \"prevailed veryextensively ... so much so, that when Christianity superseded Paganism, much ofthe heathen symbolism was adapted to the new rites, and the transition fromthe worship of Diana to that of the Madonna was made comparatively simple.\"Mr. Rolfe speaks of the key, rue, and verbena as symbols of Diana; of all of theseI have incantations, apparently very ancient, and identified with Diana. I haveoften found rue in houses in Florence, and had it given to me as a special favour.It is always concealed in some dark corner, because to take any away is to takeluck. The bronze frog was an emblem of Diana; hence the Latin proverb, \"Hewho loves a frog regards it as Diana.\" Itwas made till recent times as an amulet. I have one as a paper-weight nowbefore me. There is also an incantation to the frog.That wherein Mr. Rolfe tacitly and unconsciously confirms what I have written,and what is most remarkable in this my own work, is that the wizards in Italyform a distinct class, still exercising great power in Naples and Sicily, and evenpossessing very curious magical documents and cabalistic charts, one of which"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"(familiar to those who have seen it among the Takruri and Arab sorcerers inCairo, in their books) he gives. These probably are derived from Malta.Therefore it will not seem astonishing to the reader that this Gospel of theWitches should have been preserved, even as I have given it. That I have not hador seen it in an old MS. is certainly true, but that it has been written of yore, andis still repeated here and there orally, in separate parts, I am sure.'It would be a great gratification to me if any among those into whose hands thisbook may fall, who may possess information confirming what is here set forth,would kindly either communicate it or publish it in some form, so that it maynot be lost.'
