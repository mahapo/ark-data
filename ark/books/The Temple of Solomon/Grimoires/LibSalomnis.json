INTRODUCTION For an excellent summary of various Raziel manuscript traditions, see Stephen Skinner‘s foreword to Sepher Raziel : Liber Salomonis, a sixteenth-century English Grimoire, transcribed, annotated, and introduced by Don Karr, with a foreword and modern English version by Stephen Skinner (Singapore: Golden Hoard Press, 2010), pages 13-23. Liber Salomonis comprises folio pages 2r-57r of British Library Sloane MS 3826; it contains seven treatises (as described in its own fo.3r)*: 1. Clavis...―of astronomy and of the starres‖ (ff 5v-11v) 2. Ala...―the vertues of some stones of herbes and of beasts‖ (ff 12r-27r) 3. Tractatus Thymiamatus...of suffumigations and of allegations of them and divisions‖ (ff 27r-34r) 4. The ―Treatise of tymes of the year of the day and of the night...when anything ought to be done by this booke‖ (ff 34r-46r) 5. The ―Treatise of Cleanesse...of Abstinence‖ (ff 46r-51r) 6. ―Samaim‖ which ―nameth all the heavens and her angels and the operations or workings of them‖ (ff 51v-53v) 7. The ―booke of Vertues...and miracles...the properties of the ark of magicke and of his figures and of the ordinance of same‖ (ff 53v-57v)   * These sections also appear in the edition prepared by Joseph H. Peterson from British Library Sloane MS 3846, at ESOTERIC ARCHIVES, ―Sepher Raziel Book of the Angel Raziel‖ (© 1999, 2006) http://www.esotericarchives.com/raziel/raziel.htm."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2015 2 Liber Salomonis refers to itself as ―Cephar Raziel‖ (ff 2v, 3r, 4r, 12r, 34r), ―Sephar Raziel‖ (fo. 2r), ―booke of Raziel‖ (ff 20r, 46r, 57r), and ―booke of Razeelus‖ (fo. 3v). Solomon is indicated as the recipient and redactor—not the author—of the book in the narrative which introduces the text (ff 2v-3v), though most instructions begin, ―Salomon said....‖ Others begin, ―Hermes said...‖ (ff 9r, 11r, 18v, 24r, 28v, 30r, 31r, 32r, 33v), ―Adam said...‖ (fo. 16r), ―Nathaniel said...‖ (fo. 47r), ―Moyses said...‖ (ff 4r, 4v), and ―Raziel said...‖ (ff 6r, 16v, 22r, 26r, 28v, 31v, 34v, 36r, 37r, 38v). Narrative passages refer to Raziel as the source of the book (e.g., ff 34r and 36r). The rest of Sloane MS 3826 consists of 1. Incipit Canon: The rule of the book of consecration, or the manner of working (ff 58r-60r) 2. Orisons (ff 60r-65r) 3. Magical directions (ff 65r-83v) 4. Liber Lunæ (ff 84r-97v) 5. Raphael: The Invocation of Oberon Concerning Physick &c (ff 98r-99r) 6. The Call of Bilgal, One of the 7 etc. (fo. 99v) 7. An Experiment for a Fayry (fo. 100r) 8. Beleemus De imaginibus (ff 100v-101r) Sloane MS 3826 is in English, except for (i) the opening lines of paragraphs in Liber Salomonis and Incipit Canon (ii) the Orisons (iii) the invocation, constriction, ligation, and license of Raphael (iv) Beleemus De imaginibus (BELEEMUS REGARDING THE IMAGES [OF THE PLANETS]) In various papers and communications, I have expressed the opinion that Sloane 3826 was a sixteenth-century Christian product, though one which borrowed from Jewish, Arabic, and Græco-Roman scholastic and folk sources. In a note to me (January 28, 2007), Sophie Page offered an informed and most welcome emendation to my view in the form of an abridged segment from her article, ―Uplifting Souls and Speaking with Spirits: The Liber de essentia spirituum and the Liber Razielis,‖ which was to be published in Claire Fanger (ed.), Invoking Angels: Mystical Technologies in the Middle Ages †: The most explicit transmission of Jewish magical material into the Christian Latin tradition of magic was the translation of works associated with the name ―Raziel,‖ an angel present in Jewish angelology and Arabic astrological texts who was said to have revealed a book of secrets to Adam. Various esoteric and magical treatises attributed to Raziel and based on the practical use of divine and angelic names circulated among late medieval Jews. The earliest known reference in Latin is a citation by the Christian convert Petrus Alfonsus [OR Alfonsi] (1062-1110) of a certain Secretum secretorum, which claimed to have been revealed to Seth, the son of Adam, by the angel Raziel. By the mid-thirteenth century, these magic texts were circulating more widely in Latin. In 1259, Alfonso [X, (1221-1284)] directed the translation of a work entitled Liber Razielis from Latin into Castilian by the cleric Juan d‘Aspa. The Castilian version does not survive, but the Latin original put together by Alfonso survives in two complete and several partial copies, as well   † This was actually published as Invoking Angels: Theurgic Ideas and Practices, Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries, edited by Claire Fanger (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2012). The passage quoted, with significant additions and modifications, occurs on pages 81-83."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2015 3 as various early modern abridged vernacular versions. The Alfonsine Liber Razielis is structured in the form of seven books said to have been brought together by Solomon. Nine related texts from the Solomonic and Hermetic magical traditions were added by Alfonso‘s scribes as appendices. Although the preface cites a single Hebrew original for the seven volumes, it is likely that the structure was partly a creation of Alfonso himself and his translators. The following post-1500 manuscripts contain abridged vernacular copies of the Alfonsine Liber Razielis or the Liber Sameyn only (the sixth book). This is not an exhaustive list, and I have only personally examined those in the British Library: MS Yale, Beinecke Rare Books Library Osborn MS fa. 7 (late s. xvi, English); British Library MSS Sloane 3826 (s. xvii, English), ff. 1-57, Sloane 3846 (s. xvi, English), ff 127-55; MS Lyon 970 (s. xvii, xviii, French; MSS Alnwick Castle 596 (s. xviii, Italian, the Liber Sameyn), pp. 1-42 and 96 (Italian, Latin, English, the Liber Sameyn only); MS Lübeck, Bibliothek der Hansestadt, Math. 4o 10 (s. xvi/xvii, German); MS Dresden N. 36 (s. xviii, German); Prague, National Museum Library MS XVIIF25 (1595, Czech, trans. Ioannes Polenarius). MS British Library Add. 16, 390 (s. xvii) has a Hebrew extract with a title in Italian. Where no folio references are given, the catalogue entry suggests that the Liber Razielis travels alone. Suggested bibliography: J.

[my brackets—DK] In her introduction to The Watkins Dictionary of Angels (London: Watkins Publishing, 2006), Julia Cresswell writes (page 9) of Sloane 3826, I would suggest that although the manuscript may be sixteenth century, some of the language is rather old-fashioned for that date, except perhaps for an old person writing in the early sixteenth century. I would guess that the text is a reworking if an earlier one, pushing the origin of the material back into the Middle Ages. Liber Salomonis is here literally transcribed, line-by-line; no changes in spelling or wording have been made. (Spelling in the MS is quite inconsistent; e.g., within a few lines of each other, we find ―wing,‖ ―winge,‖ ―wyng,‖ and ―wynge.‖) With the superscript and other features, I have imitated the look of the text. Note that superscripted letters belong to the text; superscripted numbers refer to footnotes. All Latin headings are in italics. Each page of text here represents a folio page of the MS; folio numbers are given in square brackets.

"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2015 8 [3r] The name of this booke expounded in Latine is Angelus mag- nus Secreti Creatoris That is to say the great Angel of the secret creator And in Hebrew Cephar Raziel it is the booke after Adam written in language of Caldey and afterward translated in Hebrew. And know each man that reades it that in it all Semiforax that is to say the great name complete wth all his names whole and even. and wth his vertues and his sacraments And I found it in 7 bookes that is 7 treatises. And know ye that I found the first and the last full darke and the five middle more plain and although I found them darke I opened them as much as I could or might. And the 7 treatises of this booke be these.. 1. The first is said Clavis for that in it is determined of Astronomy and of the stares for wthout them we may do nothing. 2. The second is said Ala for that in it is determined of the vertues of some stones of herbes and of beasts 3. The third is said Tractatus Thymiamatus for that there is determined in it of suffumigations and of Alle- gations of them and divisions 4. The ivth is said the Treatise of tymes of the year of the day and of the night for that in it is determined when any- thing ought to be done by this booke 5.

Methelis Salomon said that after Clarifaton had corrected it and had dressed it, it should be the better and ordained it in the best maner that he might. And Clarifaton said, wch was the writer of Salomon, that this booke is full of great privity and that it was sent of full great honor And that it was sent to Salomon for most price and most love. And everiche treatise of these vii was was written by themselves. But although it be so that Clarifaton said that it ought to be but one booke alone by itself for none of these saith he should suffice wthout another, wherefore he said it were necessary that they were all together Whereupon Salomon ordained that all the said 7 treatises were but one booke as they ought to be and as they ought to be read and wrought. And he ordayned it much better then the philo[soph][e]rs orday= ned, and also he taught how a man ought to do his worke by it.
