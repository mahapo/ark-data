The history of astrology has,with a few notable exceptions, considered astrology in terms of emerging science, declining magic, orin terms of a “rationality” defined as an essentially non-magical endeavour. This book considers earlymodern expectations and practical applications of astrology, and models astrology’s universal scopeusing three areas of focus – the environmental, the political and the social. The environmental focusdiscusses how astrology informed human understanding and action in relation to the nature andpassage of time as well as phenomena of the natural world. The political focus examines theastrologer’s role as an interpreter of divine ordering, while also underlining the power ofastrological knowledge to affect as well as analyse. The social focus analyses astrology’s conceptionof the individual and the forces influencing their predispositions and temperaments. It also addressesthe numerous ways in which astrology offered active solutions and remedies for the variety ofpersonal questions, concerns and problems it mapped and interpreted. This book analyses the ways inwhich magic and astrology co-mingled, cross-pollinated and fused, as well as emphasising thetheories and techniques that unified all scales of existence in a grand interrelating astrological system.Finally, this book explores the performative and transformative dimensions of astrological practice,which produced intercessory knowledge and action through an interrelated set of functions,interpretative techniques and ritualised activities."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1INTRODUCTIONSAstrology is an important area of study in the history of seventeenth-century England. It has beendescribed as ‘a central – if controversial – feature of the intellectual and social history of the earlymodern period’.[1] Astrological theory and techniques were used to analyse all manner of phenomena– it has been remarked that astrology was ‘less a separate discipline than an aspect of a generallyaccepted world picture.’[2] This book concerns itself with the multiplicity of specific uses to whichastrology was put, including such diverse fields as early modern cosmology, eschatology, politicalanalysis and propaganda, medicine and popular magical solutions to personal problems. In doing so,it advances three contentions.Firstly, that astrology presented and explored a thoroughly interconnected universe, to the extent that itposited the interdependence of individuals and their environment – meaning both one’s immediatesurroundings and the wider totality of the universe. Humanity was not considered an agency outside ofor separated from the “natural world”: all phenomena, human and otherwise, were unified in a totaland interrelated astrological spectrum of meaning. As demonstrated by the wide variety of subjectmatter in the sources I have used, astrology touched on everything. Nothing, save perhaps GodHimself, was beyond astrological analysis. The unifying and underlying influences of and on anythingcould be discerned, analysed and manipulated.Secondly, this book argues that astrology based this analysis and manipulation of influence onfundamentally magical principles that described the nature and operations of the universe. This naturewas understood and manipulated through ontological taxonomies, such as the four classical elementsand rulerships of the seven planets. These operations were understood and manipulated throughmagical axioms, such as reflection, contagion, similitude and the agency of non-material intelligences.As such, magic and astrology intermingled in a mutually supportive exploration, analysis andapplication of occult theories and practices. To explore this, I will be drawing upon explanationsfrom works of occult philosophy as well as astrological handbooks.Finally, this book puts forward the notion that astrological knowledge and action were themselvesfused and interrelated. Investigative astrological activity produced complex forms of knowledge –divinatory foreknowledge of coming events clearly demonstrates how magical ways of knowingshaped action. The interpretive and intercessional functions that astrological practitioners performedfor themselves and their various clients are also considered significant indicators of the power ofoccult knowledge. Furthermore, the transformative effects of astrological knowledge in and of amagical universe frequently combined and united divination and enchantment activities, and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"demonstrate more generally that understanding was itself a form of knowledge-in-action. Accounts ofthe astrological services offered by practitioners are therefore invaluable.The seventeenth century was a turbulent, uncertain time for England. The political and social turmoilof the Civil War, the Revolution, the Commonwealth and the Restoration Crisis were accompanied byintellectual upheaval: eschatological concerns combining politics, religion and cosmology wereamong the flood of new and often socially disruptive ideas being discussed and disseminatedthroughout this period. Fundamental to this rise in new ways to make sense of a changing world wasthe lifting of printing press censorship and restrictions between 1640 and 1660. These ‘several yearsof virtually complete freedom of the press’ were crucial to the spread of new ideas during thiscentury, as this freedom ‘offered the possibility of choice between alternatives, [and] ended the statechurch’s monopoly of opinion-forming.’[3] Astrology played an important part in this explosion inpublishing – from political analysis in almanacs and pamphlet propaganda to astrological diagnostics,treatments and elaborations on contemporary Galenic humoural theory in popular medical handbooks.There were also strong astrological components within continental grimoires of magic beingtranslated, printed and bought around this period, not to mention the production and sales of ‘hugenumbers of chapbooks on astrology and divination.’[4] This century marks a zenith in the availabilityand popularity of astrology and its uses in England.Studying how early modern thinkers characterised and understood their world is vital in constructingaccurate assessments of their experiences. Astrology in seventeenth-century England was used toinform decision-making and problem-solving, to interpret both personal crises and historical events,and to manage and manipulate diverse activities. It is important to consider astrology because it wasimportant to the early modern people we study."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(A BRIEF) HISTORIOGRAPHYOne of the first major works of the twentieth century to deal with the history of astrology was LynnThorndike’s extensive A History of Magic and Experimental Science, published in eight volumesbetween 1923 to 1958. It located astrology within a grand positivist narrative of the rise of theexperimental methodology and the birth of science, spanning from Pliny to the end of the seventeenthcentury. The series concentrated upon the intellectual, and above all scientific, aspects of astrologyand magic. Thorndike assesses that astrology’s main role was to be an important precursor for futurescientific ideology. This approach demonstrates how the history of astrology (and of magic ingeneral) began the twentieth century by being assessed, not by its own standards and achievements,but by those of science.Over the 1960s, Harry Rusche emphasised a specific political context to seventeenth-century Englishastrology with his 1965 article ‘Merlini Anglici: Astrology and Propaganda from 1644 to 1651’.[5]His later article, ‘Prophecies and Propaganda, 1641 to 1651’,[6] underlined links between astrologyand magical prophecy by examining interpretive roles of astrologers in forming specific politicalanalyses from the symbolic language of magical prophecy. Magic and astrology were demonstrated tooffer an interrelated set of functions for assessing and affecting political developments. The 1966publication of the diary and correspondences of the magical practitioner, patron and antiquarian EliasAshmole (1617-1692), edited by C.H. Josten, offered insight into the personal practice andunderstanding of astrological techniques of a renowned seventeenth-century occultist.[7]Keith Thomas’ Religion and the Decline of Magic (London, 1971), regarded as a landmark work inthe history of magic, also contained important contributions to the history of astrology. This booktreated astrology as a fundamental part of the early modern English understanding of a magicaluniverse. Its “bottom-up” perspective described astrologer’s consultation rooms and magical surgerysessions to explore the uses and social significance of astrology. It also marked a fundamental shift inhistorical considerations of astrological magic, away from demonstrating how science “evolved”from magic and towards assessment of the changes that rendered magic inadequate – or, as G.E.R.Lloyd put it, ‘the explanandum is not, in any case, the victory of rationality over magic: there was nosuch victory; but rather how the criticism of magic got some purchase.’[8] However, perhaps one ofthe most important contributions to the history of English astrology was the publication of BernardCapp’s Astrology and the Popular Press: English Almanacs 1500-1800 (London, 1979). This bookemphasised the social, intellectual and cultural importance of almanacs and astrology – demonstratingtheir wide-ranging influences on, inter alia, literacy, politics, agriculture, religion, romance,cosmology, medicine, advertising and history itself. It located a firm astrological contribution to theimportance of print in early modern English culture. Astrology was dealt with on its own terms, in itsown language, and through the accounts of a whole spectrum of contemporary practitioners, believersand sceptics."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The 1980s saw various refinements in understanding astrology’s significance in seventeenth-centuryEngland. Stephen Skinner’s Terrestrial Astrology: Divination by Geomancy (London, 1980)demonstrated how crucial astrological symbolism was for geomantic divination, emphasisingontological interdependencies of early modern magic and astrology. One of the most important worksof this decade for the history of astrology was Michael MacDonald’s Mystical Bedlam: Madness,Anxiety and Healing in Seventeenth Century England (Cambridge, 1981) which emphasisedpsychiatric contexts within which seventeenth-century English astrology operated. It explored thetheories and techniques of astrological medicine, with particular interest in early modern conceptionsof “mental health”, by focusing on the practice of the clergyman, astrologer and magician RichardNapier (1559-1634), and yielded valuable data from statistical analysis of Napier’s detailedcasenotes. S.J. Tester’s A History of Western Astrology (Bury St. Edmunds, 1987) traced astrology asa discrete system back to ancient Greece and up to the late Renaissance, offering an importantunderstanding of the basis for seventeenth-century astrological axioms and techniques. MichaelHunter and Annabel Gregory’s editorship of the ‘astrological diary’[9] of Samuel Jeake (1652-1699)also provided additional firsthand accounts of astrological practice which, in contrast to Josten’sAshmole volumes, came from a practitioner whose religion, influenced by Puritan and nonconformistideas, did not always seem to sit comfortably with his astrology. This offers particularly fascinatinginsight into contemporary opinions on the interrelations and delineations of astrology, magic andreligion. Patrick Curry’s Power and Prophecy (Cambridge, 1989) readdressed the political functionsof English astrology in this period. Curry’s book categorised astrology into ‘elite’ (Royalist) and‘democratic’ (Parliamentarian) types, analysing politicisation of astrological conceptions of theproper nature and operation of the universe – as both sides of the civil war attempted to justify theirpolitics by appeal to astrological understanding of nature, to insist either that “inferiors obeysuperiors” or that “the stars incline but do not compel”. The political nature of astrology (and theastrological politics of nature itself) was explored through emphasising the magical universe’sinterrelations of microcosm and macrocosm.Another important work to consider the interrelation of politics and nature was Ottavia Niccoli’sProphecy and People in Renaissance Italy (Princeton, 1990) which considered the politicaland cultural impact of early modern prophecy as a combination of various magical aswell as religious comprehensions of natural processes. While this book’s focus issixteenth-century Italy, Niccoli’s observations about the intersection of politics,humans and nature in prophecy are also useful insights for considering seventeenth-century English astrology. Further, far more detailed assessment of astrology’scontemporary political utility came from Ann Geneva’s Astrology and the SeventeenthCentury Mind (Manchester, 1995), which examined in great detail the ‘language of the stars’ as usedby England’s most famous astrologer of the time, William Lilly (1602-1681). Geneva utilised herdeep reading of Lilly’s work to emphasise the cryptographic importance of astrological symbolism incovert political assessment and criticism, deeply expanding upon the explicit propaganda valueidentified by Rusche. Geneva emphasised a rational function of astrology as an interpretive,analytical and critical tool or ‘multi-layered symbolic language system’[10] of seventeenth-century"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"English political activity, thereby also stressing the necessity of astrological interpreters and code-breakers, and developing consideration of the transformative effects of astrological knowledge.The medical dimensions of early modern astrology have been considerably advanced by two morerecent works. Lauren Kassell’s Medicine and Magic in Elizabethan London: Simon Forman –Astrologer, Alchemist, and Physician (Oxford, 2005) presented a deep reading of Forman’s casehistories, notebooks and many unfinished works which offered fresh perspectives on early modernattitudes and practices concerning physician-patient relations (specifically regarding gender andgynaecology), as well as exploring how astrology related to the myriad magical practices of SimonForman (1552-1611). David Lederer’s Madness, Religion and the State in Early Modern Europe: ABavarian Beacon (Cambridge, 2006) presented and analysed a variety of early modern ideasconcerning the interrelations of body, mind and soul. Lederer’s book significantly developsMacDonald’s early work on diagnosis and treatment of impaired mental faculties during this period,including greater assessment of spiritual afflictions and the Christian moral casuistry that oftenaccompanied them. Like Niccoli’s Prophecy and People, Lederer’s work offers us valuablecomparisons and commonalities to be drawn from a wider European perspective on astrology’s rolein restoring and maintaining physical, mental and spiritual well-being.Two works by Owen Davies have also recently developed important strands within the history ofastrology. Popular Magic: Cunning-folk in English History (New York, 2007) has located a firmastrological basis in the magical activities of village wizards and wise-women – reminding us thatastrology did not merely inform high ceremonial court magic or the summoning of angels, but wasalso the most ubiquitous element throughout the magical activities of “common” practitioners.Popular Magic also provided snapshots of the clients and patients of astrological practitioners, andglimpses of their concerns, problems and expectations for magical services on offer. Davies’Grimoires: A History of Magic Books (Oxford, 2009) likewise presented study of astrology as animportant element of magic, exploring links between the history of magic and of print. Contributing tothe work begun in Capp’s Astrology and the Popular Press, it focuses on Europe as a whole over anincredibly broad period of time (from the ancient world to the 1960s), offering an expansive contextwithin which to discuss links between astrology, magic and written text.This historiography highlights three key factors in our conceptions of astrology: firstly, the relationbetween magic and astrology; secondly, notions about astrology functioning as a practice as well asknowledge; and finally, how astrology has been examined as contributing to understandingenvironmental, political and social contexts of early modern England. It is the intention of this book todraw upon extant scholarship to develop and explore our understanding of these ideas – to not onlyconsider how people of the seventeenth century comprehended and used astrology, but also toconsider how historians have presented and analysed it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AREAS OF STUDYThere are a number of topics related to, but not specifically addressing, astrology that this book doesnot cover. It does not discuss astrology’s functions relating to the emerging scientific experimentalmethodology, and does not investigate astronomy or meteorology. Nor does this book examinedebates about determinism and free will, or contemporary discussion over astrology’s legitimacy.Although it seeks to examine astrology’s interrelations with occult philosophy and magical practice, itdoes not look at any of the massively diverse and important cultural impacts of witchcraft and witchtrials. Finally, this book does not assess factors behind the decline of astrology in the final years ofthe early modern period.The focus of this book is upon the expectations, services and practical applications of astrology inseventeenth-century England. It analyses how astrology was used, and what it was used for. Itexamines both analysis and management of celestial influence, and explores links between divinationand enchantment activities within astrology. This study of the functions of astrology should bedistinguished from study of the functions of belief in astrology. The purpose of this book is to offer anunderstanding of early modern astrological thought and action as it was used, rather than explaining orexcusing it from the vantage of hindsight. For these reasons, I have considered astrology on its ownterms at the height of its popularity to explore what people did with astrology – to understand thefunctions astrology fulfilled.In order to assess astrology’s broad and far-reaching functions in seventeenth-century England, I havedivided this book into three main chapters, prefaced by a brief introduction to the premises,mechanisms and techniques of astrology. Chapter 2 considers astrology’s broadest functions inassessing human existence in relation to the environment. It analyses how astrology constructed humanmeaning for time, history and nature. It stresses the unifying capacity of astrology to explore andmanage fundamental occult interrelations posited to underlie existence. Chapter 3 narrows assessmentof astrological functions by focusing on political contexts for astrological theory and practice. Itanalyses astrology’s functions in relation to prophecy, political analysis and propaganda. It also dealswith astrology’s considerations of political organisation as but one level of complexity in a unifyingontological and epistemological system. Chapter 4 further narrows this book’s analysis ofastrological utility, considering astrological understanding of human societies and individuals, aswell as the links between the two. It deals with the variety of services astrological practitionersoffered in their personal consultations, and considers the wide range of magical activities thatastrology supported and cross-pollinated."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PREMISESIt may seem bizarre to modern sensibilities that astrology should have such an impact andsignificance. The study of astrology therefore makes an important contribution to the history of earlymodern England by seeking to not simply “explain away” but to understand astrological worldviews.Such study delivers early modern astrological practitioners, their clients and their wider audiencefrom a condescending appraisal of astrology as fundamentally irrational or nonsensical. As has beenpointed out, ‘logic of whatever kind... contains no guarantees as to the correctness of premises’[11],and to call astrological practice irrational or illogical is to do it a great disservice. In order tounderstand astrology on its own terms, we must look at its underlying mechanics. Astrology was thetheory and practice of analysing and managing influences of celestial forces on human affairs. Itrested upon a number of premises shared with magical thinking. According to infamous occultphilosopher Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535), magic is, inter alia, ‘thediffering, and agreement of things with themselves.’[12] The following principles are astrologicaltheories on how phenomena interact with one another.The central notion of astrology contends that as celestial bodies move in the heavens, so too doearthly events unfold in corresponding ways. This idea is described by the Emerald Tablet of HermesTrismegistus, which states: ‘That wch is below is like that wch is above [;] that wch is above is likeyt wch is below’.[13] This is the notion of an interlinking macrocosm and microcosm – of aninterconnected universe where the smallest parts and processes are accurate portrayals of the largestand vice versa. This principle or theory, that the massive machinations of the cosmos might illustrateand correspond to the relatively tiny actions and events upon Earth, is the main foundation ofastrology. Astrology was considered ‘a rational attempt to map the state of the heavens and tointerpret that map in the context of that “cosmic sympathy” which makes man an integral part of theuniverse.’[14]From this notion of a basic interconnection of all things, several further principles can be outlined.The first is ‘similitude’ – that ‘everything moves, and turns itself to its like, and inclines that to itselfwith all its might.’[15] In similitude, things are connected because they share fundamental essences.The occult properties of things are imbued at their creation ‘through the rays of the stars’.[16] Indeed,astrology works precisely because all things are thought to be imbued with astral properties or“virtues”. The principle of contagion or exposure assumed that this occult virtue could betransferred between things. This transfer of ‘vertue’ or occult properties through exposure plays avital role in understanding why accurate astronomical data was necessary for the setting of anastrological figure – as the stars moved through the heavens, their influence waxed and waned.Heavily connected with similitude is the principle of sympathy.[17] This states that even things thatare not alike, but which might nevertheless “agree”, also share a link. Magnetism was considered interms of sympathy – ‘that attractive inclination, which loadstone hath upon iron’.[18] Conversely,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"there is a notion that certain things also share effects upon each other by their “disagreement” orantipathy – that unlike can compel unlike. Agrippa refers the popularisation of these ideas toHeraclitus, who ‘professed that all things were made by enmity and friendship.’[19] This way oflooking at the world is characteristic of a holistic view of an interconnected universe – phenomenaare defined or considered by their opposites as well as their likenesses. The idea of antipathy wasfurther complicated by conceptions of common enemies in the natural world. Therefore, theturtledove and the parrot were considered to be magically “friendly” to each other, despite their onlyconnection being a shared antipathy to foxes.[20] These contrasting and opposite forces of sympathyand antipathy play an important astrological role in characterising the relations between planets andthe zodiac.These are some of the key astrological principles positing why astrology worked. To understand howastrology was thought to work, we must examine specific astrological structures – the conceptions ofthe elements and humours, planets, signs and houses of the heavens. These are the specific structuresthat astrological activity utilises, as opposed to the mechanics of magical axioms by which such workis done.The planets were the seven classical observable celestial bodies, which included the Sun and Moon,while the zodiac was a band of twelve astrological signs which made an annual orbit through the sky.The planets and signs were collectively referred to as “the stars”. The ‘Houses of the Heavens’ werespecific fixed areas of the sky, used to give a position to the stars. The planets represented aparticular force or experience (i.e. Venus representing love), the zodiac signs represented how thatforce manifested (i.e. Aries represented courage and ‘impetuosity’[21]), and the houses eachsignified a particular area of life (such as “Possessions”, “Children” or “Career”[22]) that this forcewould affect.[23] Each planet had sympathetic and antipathetic relations with the signs – when aplanet shared a position with a sign it “ruled”, the planet’s influence was amplified. Conversely,detrimental signs impeded planetary influence. The planets were also linked through sympathies andantipathies with each other.[24] Astrologers could find further meaning by assessing particularconfigurations or relation of planets to one another – called aspects. Some aspects, such as the trine,were considered favourable, whilst the square or quartile was considered ill-fated. Crucially, theconjunction configuration could be understood as beneficient or malevolent depending oninterpretation.The signs were also afforded an elemental identity – three signs to each of the four classical elementsof Fire, Water, Air and Earth. So the signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius were considered to exert a hotand dry Fiery influence. This is significant to our studies because early modern humoural theories of‘the body are also based on elemental analysis – the four humours (choler, phlegm, blood andbile[25]) correspond to the four elements. Humoural theory posited that ‘man’s body was made up ofthe four elements and the four qualities held, in good health, in a proper balance, or harmony.’[26]The four immutable qualities mentioned above are the properties of the mutable elements: hot, cold,dry, and moist. The distinction between elements and qualities explained how universal phenomenawere capable of both change and stability. So a beaker of water (made up of the Watery elementwhich possessed cold and moist qualities) when put on a flame to boil would exchange the cold for"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"heat, producing steam or air (the hot and moist element); yet the fundamental qualities themselves,although swapping to produce different elemental functions, would not alter. Humoural medicine,treatments to bring the humours from a dyscrasia (literally “bad mixture”) into healthy balance,underlies most physic practiced during the early modern period, both by licensed, educated doctorsand the multitude of “irregular” medical practitioners; apothecaries, cunning-folk, astrologer-physicians, et al. As we shall see, astrology played an important role in attempts to aid patients bybalancing their humours.Finally, we should be aware of the techniques commonly used in seventeenth-century Englishastrology. Perhaps most iconic are nativities, charts mapping the stars’ positions at the point of aperson’s birth. The “native” was considered intimately linked to these configurations – a nativitycould be used to assess an individual’s personality and destiny. Another common astrologicaltechnique was the horary figure – a snapshot of the heavens which would offer divinatory answers byinterpreting the stars’ positions at the time the question was asked. Astrological practitioners alsodrew up elections, which assessed the best time to begin a journey, project or enterprise so as to bestutilise astrological influences for one’s benefit. These are far from the only techniques thatastrological practitioners utilised, but specific procedures and practices will be dealt with in thefollowing three chapters, addressing the environmental, political and social functions of seventeenth-century English astrology."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE ENVIRONMENTALWhen assessing types of astrology, we are generally presented with a division into two approaches. Ithas been considered that astrology has ‘experienced a conflict between more magical and morerationalistic strands throughout [its] history... between a more divinatory and more rationalistictradition.’[27] This rationalistic tradition has been called “natural astrology”, and is most oftencharacterised as the strand of astrology concerned with renovating astrological practice throughempirical experimentation. It is the astrologia sana of Francis Bacon (1561-1626), supported bycontemporaries such as Samuel Jeake and astrologer John Gadbury (1627-1704), which ‘sawastrology as comparable to other forms of natural causation’.[28] Empirical evidence was to be usedto reason conclusions about the operation of the universe. This supposedly more “rationalistic”approach to astrology streamlined the detailed considerations of astral influences whichcharacterised other more Neo-platonic approaches, and instead emphasised simpler analysis of birthcharts.[29] This further emphasised the consideration of astrology as a natural causation ofphenomena – a central consideration in the natural philosophy of astrology. Much has already beenmade of this area of astrological theory and practice in histories of science and proto-science –Patrick Curry considers the ‘natural law-like determinism’ of this approach to be a foundation forinterest in astrology from such historians as Lynn Thorndike and Otto Neugebauer.[30] This “naturalastrology” is considered to have de-emphasised more occult or magical practices such as horaryastrology. However, natural astrology also refers to certain astrological practices and applicationsconcerning the natural world itself, such as forecast of weather, harvest and epidemics. We shouldtherefore begin by distinguishing the approach or discourse which can be called the naturalphilosophy of astrology, from the actual practices of natural or “nature astrology” itself. This bookwill not concern itself with the natural philosophy of astrology – the pursuit of astrology that sought‘to refine the techniques and test the principles of astrology by careful empiricism’[31] – but it willlook at the actual applications and practices of natural astrology because, as we shall see, they sharemuch common ground with other predictive astrological techniques typically depicted as “magical”.This book puts forward a broad working definition for natural astrology, as the practice ofdeciphering information from the stars regarding “the natural world” – agriculture, weather, diseaseand so on. However astrology also considered events of the human microcosmic world a part of thenatural macrocosmic world. Therefore astrology concerned itself with mass movements in humansociety, assessing them as expressions of natural processes. Francis Bacon defined his naturalistic‘sane astrology’, for example, to be concerned with ‘all commotions or great innovations of thingsnatural and civil.’[32] Natural astrological practice was therefore in most cases a generalised form ofspeculative and predictive activity, and not so far removed from the expressly political character of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"judicial divinatory astrology.[33]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"TIMEThe widest environmental context within which to consider human agency is existence and action intime as well as space. As Proclus observed, ‘time is the number of the motion of the celestialbodies’.[34] While astronomical observation of the movements of celestial bodies was a widely usedmeans of measuring the passage of time even into the seventeenth century,[35] astrology played asignificant role in early modern understanding of time. Astrology offers symbolic meaning forobservable phenomena to not only mark but provide meaning for the passage of time. To say, forexample, that the Sun “enters” Aries[36] (as it does at the start of spring to begin the new astrologicalyear) is to say that the fiery nature of Aries acts as an energetic reawakening of nature from its winterslumber into a new spring beginning. A particular period of time and the events occurring within thatperiod were not considered merely arbitrary or coincidental but closely interlinked. The changingseasonal cycles affected flora (observed in their specific flowering and harvest times), fauna (inanimal mating seasons) and, most obviously, the seasonal climates. To consider this in a slightlydifferent manner, the effect of winter upon nature (i.e. upon the world and humanity) occurredbecause such influence was instilled by virtue of winter’s particular astrological identity. As the wildnatural world was clearly regulated by specific timing, so too human events and experience werethought to be linked to time. Astrology offered a cyclical conception of the processes of time uponnature – a nature that united the activities of people and their environment.Astrology’s scope with regards to time was universal – it mapped the entirety of human and cosmicexistence. Astrology linked small divisions of time important for everyday human life (such as daysand hours) with the vast spans of millennia into one continuous and universal astrological scope. Itdid so through cyclical conceptions inspired by observable planetary revolution – small cycles ofcelestial orbits constructing ever grander cycles towards a single period measuring the entire span ofthe universe. It provided meaning for the duration of all existence, and to the processes unfolding tothe very end of time and the cosmos itself.This astrological period of an entire cosmos-length is illustrated by the concept of the Great Year – aPlatonic idea that the universe literally repeated its events and various unfolding history every 36,000years.[37] It has been suggested that ‘underneath... later theories of cyclical history lies a shadowastrological tradition... whose continuity remains unbroken from 8th century Islamic theorists toWilliam Lilly in the seventeenth century.’[38] Such an astrologically derived idea of eternalrecurrence was not agreeable with later Christian doctrine; partly because it obscured the act ofCreation at the beginning, and partly because it denied the permanency of any divine Judgement orRedemption at the end.[39] Therefore this universal cycle-length, originally representing theendlessness of the cosmos, came to be understood by the ‘one-cycle cosmological system[s]’ ofJudaism and Christianity as representing the life-span of the whole of creation.[40] So astrologyultimately helped encode, eschatologically speaking, the point at which time itself would stop. Inmany ways, astrological speculation on the end-times was a logical extension of the idea of general"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"divination by the movement of the stars. However rather than predict likelihoods of particular events,or even outline broad trends of fortune, the eschatology of speculative astrology attempted to discernthe nature of the final conclusion of all affairs of the cosmos. It attempted to comprehend themechanisms underlying the unfolding and completion of destiny. It is from this position that astrologypresents a unique contribution to eschatology, periodisation, and the philosophy of history.By the seventeenth century, overt Christian symbolism had come to take prominence in eschatologicalspeculation.[41] Yet astrology was still an important component in considering the end-times. In theopening of The Bloody Almanack for 1643, astrologer John Booker (1602-1667) advanced aperiodisation of the history of Christianity, beginning with the later life of Christ. This is based oninterpretation of symbols from the book of Revelation, namely, that the seven seals mentioned thereinmark seven-year periods by which ‘you shall find the effect of every seale to be performed within theseven years of that seale; and so the harmony to be perfect betwixt those seales and the justhistory.’[42] Booker notes that in the initial ‘sixt[h] seven yeers [which would begin 71 AD], as theText saith, there was a great quake, and the Sun was black as sack-cloth of haire, and the Moon waslike to blood, and even so after the yeare of Christ 64 a great change and defection came on allestates of the Roman Empire’.[43] Booker’s almanac utilised scriptural quotation to form a historicaltheory and cited celestial phenomena for its proof. There are many other Biblical examples ofChristian recuperation and utility of older astrological ideas about celestial phenomena presagingboth the end-times and serious times of crisis.[44] An apt articulation of the combination of astrologyand Christian eschatology comes from minister and astrologer Christopher Ness (1621-1705), whoreasoned that ‘if so many prodigys attended Christs’ passion, surely many more may attend his Returnin Glory and the end of the World, many strange conjunctions in Heaven, Earth and Sea.’[45]Throughout the seventeenth century astrological, biblical and historical concepts were fused into asingle “astro-historical-eschatological” analysis."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PERIODISATIONThe example above demonstrates two interlinked preoccupations of seventeenth-century Englishalmanacs: complete histories of the world and periodisation. Almanacs frequently contained a brieftimeline of the world’s history.[46] As in Booker’s account, the meaning of earthly events could beexplained through astrological analysis of celestial phenomena. Yet use of astrology was not limitedto providing proofs of crises throughout history. Astrology could also offer a comprehensiveassessment of the underlying character of events, and link together these events through time as part ofa continuous process. We should bear in mind that ‘in a framework which strove to understand humanaffairs through the influence of recurring planetary conjunctions, “revolution” [as a cycle or period oftime] could suggest the end of time (and the beginning of a new time), which is not much differentfrom saying that it suggested notions such as destiny and change.’[47] The predictable conjunctions ofplanets were often used to measure the passage of time and analyse the unfolding of history.[48]However, astrology’s contribution to history was not merely to mark out periods of time conveniently.Astrology provided functions for modelling and understanding historical events and processes. Itprovided language, taxonomies, analogies, and underlying structural assumptions with which toanalyse history, both human and universal. Capp advances this relation of history and astrologyfurther still:‘Such speculations reflect, once again, the confidence that astrology, properly studied, could providethe key to universal understanding. History itself might become a branch of astrological science.’[49]Almanac makers and astrologers utilised the revolutions of planets not only to periodise time but tostructure these formalised periods into interlinking and meaningful durations. This astrologicalanalysis provided information that could be pieced together to comprehend the fundamentalmechanics of history. Indeed, it has already been noted that ‘astrological doctrines about therecurrence of planetary conjunctions and their influence upon the course of affairs had helped to formthe concept of a historical period.’[50]Astrology connected scales of meaning for time and history using longer cycles carefully observedfrom shorter ones. When outlining the relatively frequent conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter[51] in hisAstrological Discourse, Christopher Heydon (1561-1623) noted that over the twenty years betweenconjunctions, ‘those Planets are moved from the place of their former Conjunctions 8 signs [andtherefore still occurring in signs of the same elemental identity], and almost 3 degrees, which excessof 3 degrees is the cause why after 10 Conjunctions they pass from one Triplicity [a set of three signsof the same elemental identity] to another’. Because each sign occupies 30 ̊ of the total 360 ̊ of theZodiac, every tenth time around the conjunction would have moved a total of 30 ̊ and thus occur in asign of a different elemental identity. From these ten conjunctions we get ‘one Triplicity [cycle,which] continueth 198 equal years, 265 days (the intercalary day of every fourth year [i.e. leap year]omitted) and 10 hours.’ Finally therefore the grand ‘Revolution of all the [four elemental] Triplicities"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"is finished but only once in 794 equal years, 331 days and 16 hours.’[52] While these irregularastrological periods of time might at first appearance seem to demonstrate somewhat imperfectlybalanced celestial mechanics, these very irregularities in fact allowed the construction of intricatecycles-within-cycles, such as the schema above. This lent a sense of fundamental connection betweenlong-term movements of the universe and the shorter-term motions. It tied together the eventsobservable within a human lifetime (such as the Saturn-Jupiter conjunction every twenty years) withthose of a far more universal scale, such as the return of the conjunction to exactly the same point atwhich it had occurred nearly 795 years ago.Astrological periodisation offers an understanding of early modern conceptions of an ‘overallframework of history’.[53] Royalist astrologer George Wharton (1617-1681) considered fivehundred to seven hundred year periods as important historical epochs. He explains that history ismade of ‘sundry changes and Translations of Kingdomes, whilst these or these Planets Raigne, andbeare Rule with others’.[54] Specifically, he appealed to astrological effect on the human biology ofsuccessive generations. Wharton claimed that empires generally existed for this five- to seven-centuryperiod because successive generations of humans become weaker than their forefathers, culminatingin the sixth generation.[55] As the planets cycled around and humans became weaker until their nextastral infusion of vitality, so too our empires waned and collapsed, or else were overthrown by anewly-invigorated generation. History, for Wharton, is made by people, but people shaped by theheavens.William Lilly, arguably seventeenth-century England’s most famous astrologer, made extensive use of‘Tritemius’[56] in describing an astrological periodisation of the history of humanity based uponcycling governorships of planetary angels. These angels were considered the ‘SecundarianIntelligences’ instituted by God and ‘appointed as Presidents of the 7 Planets’.[57] Such angels werean important link between astrology and Christianity, providing an integrated system of early modernanalysis that utilised both astrological and Christian symbolism. This periodisation endowed itsepochs with planetary characteristics. The first era, beginning in ‘the first year of the World’, wasgoverned by the angel of Saturn and, as such, ‘under his dominion men were rude, and did cohabitetogether in desert and uncouth places’.[58] This idea anthropomorphised eras by creating an angelicfigurehead or, in the Platonic sense, an ideal character of that age. History, both scriptural and actual,is fitted to astrological symbolism, creating further explanation and meaning for remarkable events.This notion also offers an underlying common character or motivating force to the people and eventsof an era. The Great Flood is explained as divine refutation of a ‘wantonness of life in men’ thatoccurred during the rule of the angel of Venus, Anael. Blame is not laid upon Anael as an absolutelycorrupting influence though – it is noted that ‘Under the Regiment of this Angell, men began to bemore Civilized’.[59] Astrology once more outlined the inclinations, persuasions and predispositionsthat encourage the particular behaviour and mentality of people within a given period of time."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"HUMAN TIMEAstrology was not limited to providing meaning and understanding to time on universal or historicalscales. The zodiac signs divided the year into twelfths, each with a particular character derived fromtheir element and qualities – perhaps astrology’s most resilient idea, surviving down to modern times.A collection of three signs made up every season, expressing a unique seasonal astrological identity.[60] Astrological handbooks and treatises provided incredibly detailed descriptions of thecorrespondences of the signs – what plants, animals, places and types of people were associated witheach of the zodiacal taxons and divisions of the year – and almanacs were full of advice detailingwhich months were most favourable for particular activities.[61] This kind of interpretation of month-long periods was the recognisable staple of the astrologer’s craft. It helped encode a person’sexperiences of themselves and other people using a twelve-part taxonomy of personality traits, aswell as providing a complex means to understand how (via roving planetary position against thezodiac) dynamic human individuals were constantly changing. It encouraged a meaningful linkbetween an individual and the natural world. Astrology emphasised the importance of one’s precisetime of birth as both a unique point in time, mapping exact positions of celestial bodies, and as a partof a continuous and universal spectrum – a grand cosmic process of expression that was happeningwith rather than to us.Astrology also provided a wider significance to quotidian human times such as days and hours. Theseven days of the week were given planetary signatures corresponding to their names.[62] Earlymodern magic-users even referred to weekdays in their writing by using planetary glyphs.[63] Theplanetary character of the days regulated both ordinary and magical activities. The magical system ofthe Heptameron broke magical operations into seven categories, each based on the nature of a planet,which were only to be performed on the relevant day.[64] As well as investing each day with aparticular planetary character or energy, each day was given over to the guardianship of a planetaryarchangel. The Theomagia of occultist John Heydon (b. 1629, d. in or around 1670) details sevenplanetary “Spirits” or ‘Ideas’ which similarly rule the days.[65] So as the weekdays cycled, theyreflected and were reflected by a larger celestial ordering – the movements of the planets and sharedgovernance of angelic forces.Even divisions of an individual day were afforded astrological importance, each day being dividedinto periods attributed to a planetary ruler. The astrological identity of these ‘artificial hours’[66] isexplained by John Heydon (“quoting” Agrippa):‘about the times of choosing the planetary hours; for almost all Astrologers divide all that space oftime from the Sun-rising to setting into twelve equal parts, and call them the twelve hours of the day...and then distribute each of those hours to every one to the Planets according to the order ofsuccessions’.[67]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Astrology characterised each hour[68] as carrying an inherent significance, providing an astrologicalundercurrent of meaning for each mundane utility of daily timing. The planetary hours were not basedupon the position of the stars at that time of the day, but upon a symbolic astrological sequence. Wemay therefore note here a clear separation between the symbolism of astrology and the observationsof astronomy. The latter certainly aided knowledge of long durations of time through measurement, butthe former provided means to interpret or understand time on a more quotidian level.Knowledge of these hours facilitated magical action, most notably in the carefully timed constructionof magical talismans that would “soak up” astral influence. So Agrippa describes ‘the operations ofMars [:] they made an image in the hour of Mars, Mars ascending in... Aries’.[69] The timingcombined the planetary hours with actual astronomical observation – in this case, when the planetMars was in Aries in the heavens – and as such there was not only a day but an hour deemed mostsuitable for operations of this kind. The casting of metal seals attributed to particular zodiac signs hadsimilar instructions – the seal of Taurus must be cast when ‘the Sun being in Taurus, which everyyeer happens about the eighth day of April.’[70] Ashmole used planetary hours to cast many sigils tocontain astral influence for creating magical effects.[71] At precisely 11 a.m., 2.17, 3.15 and 4.30p.m. on 18th July 1650 as ‘[Saturn] and [Mars] continued in the 8[th] house’, Ashmole ‘cast off inLead’ several sigils ‘against Fleas, Flyes, Caterpillars, & Toades’.[72] In Ashmole’s magicalrepellents we see that astrology could be used to not only locate the individual as a significant part ofthe cosmos, but also aid that individual in achieving effect upon the world – even if that effect wassomething as mundane as warding off unwanted domestic pests. One could be provided this aid bymapping the astrological forces that underlay phenomenal existence and, combined with magicalprinciples and structures of meaning, one was thus offered the ability to affect as well as analyseevents. Furthermore, astrology’s epic scope stretched from the end of the universe to dealing withsome of the most material of domestic nuisances.[73] This ability to affect events, made possible bymagical premises such as sympathy and contagion, nevertheless hinged upon understandingfundamental astrological correspondences that linked phenomena – for example, Saturn and Marsaffecting infestations of vermin – and acting at an exact point in time so as to best harness the forcesof astral influence permeating existence.Sigils and other charms ‘thought to preserve the favourable planetary influences and to place thempermanently at the disposal of the wearer’ are especially important to a central argument of this book:that, as Capp puts it, ‘magic here clearly fused with astrology’.[74] I would like to affirm thisstatement, but to take from it a slightly different interpretation. I would argue that instead of seeingsigils as merely one form of astrological activity that fused with magic, as opposed to other“scientific” forms of astrology, sigils mark a point on an interdisciplinary astrological-magicalspectrum at which it becomes most clear to modern thinkers that astrology itself was fused withmagic."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE HEPTAMERONThe Heptameron[75] provides a particularly useful case study of astrological time-specific magic.The Heptameron employs a magical circle inscribed with planetary angel names, as well asincantations that call upon specific planetary angels of the days.[76] The type of effect one hoped tocreate by conjuring and commanding angels was dependent upon planetary rulerships of the days.Operations of Venus (which were performed to ‘excite men, and incline them to luxury; to reconcileenemies through luxury; and to make marriages; to allure men to love women; to cause, or take awayinfirmities; and to do all things which have motion’) must be made on a Friday.[77] The actualinscriptions of the circle vary according to the time of year, the day and the hour of the magicaloperation itself. One must write, inter alia, the magical name of the hour in which the ritual isperformed, the name of the Angel of that hour, ‘the name of the Angel that ruleth that day wherein youdo the work, and the names of his ministers’, the occult name of the season, as well as those for theSun, Moon and Earth in that season.[78] These names were not merely written to draw astralinfluence; they were intoned as part of a conjuration of spiritual intelligences. Spoken as well aswritten expression formed an essential part of effect-creating knowledge. The circle forms a crib-sheet detailing the correct order and passwords for the granting of requests or demands made ofspirits able to assist the operator at the specific time of operation. The magic circle of theHeptameron is therefore intricately tied to timing, to the extent that it sacralises the very encoding ofthe time of operation into an address to active angelic agents. In addition, ritual tools like a pentaclewere made observing astrological conditions[79], and the ceremony itself was always to beperformed with the Moon at a particular position.[80] Astrology allowed the very timing of an act toconsecrate that act and its effects."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CLIMATEAstrology was considered crucial for analysing climate. Weather forecasts had an important place inseventeenth-century almanacs – an almanac without weather predictions was considered to be ‘like aPudding without Sewet, or a Christmas-pye without Plums.’[81] It was clearly a staple part of whatreaders wanted or expected, and meteorology was a common interest for astrologers.[82] SamuelJeake certainly drew astrological figures for the times of new and full moons in order to decipherweather predictions from them.[83]The astrological rules for weather prediction consisted of specific astrological configurations beingthought to create (or at the very least presage) particular weather conditions.[84] Many almanacwriters may well have been dubious about the accuracy of weather prediction, but still includedastrological rules for how to do it.[85] Nevertheless, the planets, which moved in predictable cycles,were believed to directly affect the qualities and properties of the air.[86] By extension, such cyclesmust have also affected the weather. Weather prediction further exemplifies how astrology united andanalysed phenomena, through consideration of cyclical influences as expressions of a dynamicuniversal system.By understanding climate, one could take advantage of this knowledge, most obviously in agriculture.Almanacs frequently offered advice on the astrologically propitious times to ‘plough, sow, geldanimals or fell timber.’[87] Such agricultural usage of astrology was a simpler version than formalfigure-casting, involving less mathematics. Astrologer and mathematician Henry Coley (1633-1704)suggested that all agricultural astrology needed was the zodiac sign that the sun occupied and thephases of the moon.[88] Moon-lore, as a particular subset of astrology, offered optimum times forwhen land should be manured[89] and when to geld lambs.[90] Capp has gathered several examplesof the use of astrological principles in gardening, farming and planting: even diarist John Evelyn(1620-1706), sceptical of judicial astrology, observed the “correct” moment to plant trees.[91] Thisshould not really surprise us, given that plants, responding to annual temperature and moisturefluctuations, do genuinely germinate better when particular planting times are observed. Astrologyoffered a certain further depth of analysis of such natural phenomena.[92]While agricultural election relied more on general knowledge of favourable periods than exactfigures, the principles are identical. In searching for the most appropriate point in time to begin anendeavour, in order to take full advantage of the various astrological influences, most agriculturalastrology was a form of election.[93] Agricultural astrology further affirms the advantage of humanityacting as part of their natural environment, in harmony with the annual rhythms of nature. Suchaffirmation attempts not only to explain the forces influencing the links between people and theirlandscape, crops and animals, but explores the best methods and practices to take full advantage ofsuch forces. The power of the Moon in astrological agriculture should also be considered in terms ofthe magical images of its mansions, which were particular celestial positions similar to the houses of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the heavens. The Moon could operate as a charge for magical talismans to aid farming as well as aclock by which to tell planting-times. Agrippa lists images of the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifthmansions as being used, respectively, ‘for the multiplying of herds and cattle’ and ‘for thepreservation of trees and harvests’.[94]Astrology had a strong interest in both prediction and explanation of outbreaks of epidemic. In earlymodern England, it was ‘plausible for astrologers to predict disease and mortality since it wasgenerally accepted that people’s health was affected by the state of the air and that the air wasinfluenced by the heavens.’[95] The credibility of such prediction might also be linked to the generalnotion that the weather itself operated in cycles of roughly 35 years.[96] Disease and weatherconditions were already considered to be intimately related.[97] Certain predictable appearances ofplanets or conjunctions were thought to exert influence on the balance of humours and thereforecontribute to ill-health. Capp has stated ‘several compilers noted a possible correlation betweenconjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, every 20 years, and outbreaks of plague.’[98] Richard Edlyn(1631-1677) made what turned out to be a correct prediction of the Great Plague of 1665 when hewrote in the previous year, ‘great Plagues have also succeeded those preceding Conjunctions of theyears 1603 and 1623 & that there are also two conjunctions of Saturn and Mars in the same sign; methinks we have too great cause to fear an approaching Plague, and that a very great one, ere the year1665 be expired.’[99] Similarly, John Gadbury posited ‘a general cyclical theory... [that] the return ofSaturn might be the cause of periodic outbreaks of plague’ although Gadbury himself admitted hisuncertainty about the complete validity of such a theory.[100] The predictability of planetaryrevolution, and the cyclical nature of phenomena they affected, allowed analyses of epidemics to lookforwards, to forecast, instead of being restricted to documenting death-tolls.Astrological speculation on epidemics occupies certain shared ground with traditions that consideredparticular days lucky or unlucky. One prime example would be the dog days of high summer,regarded as an intrinsically unlucky annual period, ‘so called because of the influence of those starscalled the Dog [Sirius, the Dog-Star]... beginning about the 20th day of July, and ending the 17th ofAugust.’[101] The best approach was moderation during this period ‘which had been linked sinceantiquity with the prevalence of disease.’[102] It was thought a particularly bad idea to take medicineof any kind during this period, or, indeed, to engage in sexual activity.[103] This last concern seemsespecially interesting, in that it presents an approach to the fundamentals of human existence that linksindividual reproduction with the wider environment. Astrologers mapped the positions of celestialbodies at one’s time of birth in order to comprehend the astral influences that shaped an individual.Conception – the very biological causation of one’s existence – is a logical beginning in analysingrelationships between identity and environment. A sexual act is therefore placed within anenvironmental context and a point in time’s continuum, uniquely shaped by astrological forces. Aseven animals restricted their mating to particular times, so too should humans (who were merelyanother expression of the natural world) be wary of the temporal context in which they acted. In thisregard, the dog days acted as a sort of anti-election, a period in which it was unwise to begin aproject, such as an erotic relationship or an attempt to conceive. Elections provide a further rationaleto support ideas about lucky and unlucky days, as well as a framework for their analysis. Just assexual activity was discouraged during the dog days, almanacs also offered, along with council on"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"timing for diverse other human endeavours, ‘astrological elections for sexual relations’. Apparently,‘the ideal time was when the moon was in Sagittarius.’[104] It is assumed that such elections wereexpected to help maximise one’s chances of conceiving a healthy child rather than being astrologicalaphrodisiacs – the phrase commonly used in the almanacs, arguably evoking more of a sense of dutythan of romance, is the somewhat prim ‘be as a husband to thy wife’.[105]In the tradition of the dog days, and other “unlucky day” traditions like it, we see the investment orincorporation of meaning into a set of dates. Certain days are afforded greater consequence or evenspecific distinction – relating a particular activity to a point in the annual calendar, thereby mappingand providing context for the annual cycle of the year. Most almanacs tabulated the ‘common notesand moo[v]able Feasts’ that punctuated the year.[106] This was especially true for rural life, wherethe rhythms of nature were paid particular attention. Along with providing a scale of meaning thatdivided up the year into activities – while also linking year-long cycles with the larger cosmic scalesof planetary revolution and universal destiny – doctrines of unlucky days also once againdemonstrated a combination of knowledge and action. By recognising these particularly significantdays, especially the misfortunate ones, a preventative form of action took place."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CATASTROPHEThe use of astrology to predict natural disaster was long-established by the seventeenth century.Christopher Heydon points out that Christ ‘forewarned the Jews to lift up their heads to heaven and tobehold the signs that should be in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars before [the fall ofJerusalem].’[107] However we should remember when discussing early modern “natural disasters”that humanity itself was considered part of the natural world. There was no sense of separation inastrology between great political, religious or otherwise human upheavals and floods, fires, tornadosand other catastrophes. Astrology’s universal scale of meaning considered all upheavals.Astrology made prediction about such catastrophes as contemporary disaster warning, and alsopredicted the public mood itself. Astrologers helped construct the social meaning of naturallyoccurring events such as comets and eclipses. Some of the best examples of this type of effect are theevents leading up to and surrounding the solar eclipse of March 1652. The agitation over thisparticular celestial phenomenon was considerable – consideration of the effect and meaning of thiseclipse accounted for over a quarter of the March publications amassed by bookseller and collectorGeorge Thomason (1602-1666).[108] The reaction seems to have been one of widespreadbewilderment and even outright terror at this ‘Preamble of Doomsday’.[109] John Evelyn commentedthat, following predictions made by at least one contemporary astrologer regarding this solar eclipse,‘many were so terrified by [William] Lilly that they durst not go out of their houses.’[110] Thomasdescribes a truly apocalyptic scenario, with wealthy Londoners desperately fleeing the city, as thepoor were left to scrabble for tonics[111] to counteract the effects of this dreadful event.[112] Cappconstructs from evidence a similarly bleak report: ‘other accounts speak of deserted streets andabandoned markets, and even of breakdowns and suicides.’[113] The effects of prophecies aboutcatastrophes were not limited to creating mere general panic. As events could be influenced by priorhuman knowledge they might well take on a certain self-fulfilling character. Indeed, ‘contemporariesrealized that... prophecies [of famine in this case] could be self-fulfilling, as farmers hoardedsupplies and waited for prices to rise.’[114] Likewise, from a contemporary (and critical) view, thecharge was levelled firmly against astrologers and their supporters as being primary instigators ofpanic through their ‘unknown Characters of’s horrid Pen’ that purported to reveal the ‘secrets of theStars’: one pamphlet raged, ‘your foolish fears in part were causes, why / The Women tremble, andthe Children cry’.[115] Clearly the power of astrology to interpret events in the early modernenvironment was not always considered matched with astrologers’ sense of responsibility for thoseinterpretations. The position of astrologers as messengers of the stars was fraught with the dangers ofbearing bad news.A fusing of magic and astrology occurs in the tirade of the pamphlet mentioned above. Astrologicalsymbols are derided as esoteric and obtuse. The astrologer is accused of ‘Conj’ring’ and is referredto as a ‘Magician’ and a ‘Wizard’ who ‘in their Black Art beguile[s]’ – even as a ‘frantick Prophet’.[116] The pamphlet demonstrates a clear understanding of the overlapping grounds and roles between"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"astrologers, religious figures and magicians. While this diatribe may demonstrate a seventeenth-century dissatisfaction with occult arts such as astrology, and with magic and the occult in general, theconflation of magic and astrology should also illustrate that there was a genuine cross-fertilisation ofastrology and magic in the early modern period. This pamphlet, after all, does offer insight into theprecise mechanisms of astrology – for example, it accurately identifies and laments the universalscale of astrological analysis.[117] This was not a “rationalistic” anti-magical outcry against“superstitious” practices. It was a religious call to abandon fearful and socially disruptive eclipse-lore and to accept that ‘God is the Guide, His Son, our Way, our Light’.[118] The astrologer, like thepriest, attempted to act as a middleman or interpreter for the underlying foundations of existence. Theclear difference between the two roles, that of astrologers’ attempts to manage and manipulate suchcelestial influences, is perhaps the clearest indication of the fusing of astrologer and magician. It isfor this reason, for the impertinence of attempting to become a director of divine power, that thispamphlet, in my opinion accurately, conflates magic and astrology.The emphasis given here to the upheaval of this feared event is certainly not meant to highlight thegullibility of early modern people, but to illustrate that astrology played a vital role in the generaltensions of millenarianism in the seventeenth century about a ‘Sodome-vengeance’.[119] These kindsof astrological scares demonstrate a disruptive and potentially dangerous dimension to astrology.Apparent foreknowledge of events affected the actions of participants forewarned of astrologicalforces. It therefore affected the outcome of an event, particularly in the case of tumult followingfearful predictions. In particular, ‘the furore over the solar eclipse of 29 March 1652, known as“Black Monday”, revealed the potency of a combination of astrology and apocalypse.’[120] Clearlythese kinds of astrological predictions played a role in political considerations. In short, naturalastrology did more than offer good planting times and weather forecasts – it provided disasterwarnings and answers to the hows and whys of mass events. At the very least, it provided a languagefor analysis of these mass phenomena. By attempting to grant meaning to mass events from their timingand relation to the stars, astrology often encountered malevolent confluences of astral forces at thecrux of a coming celestial event. In the mind of the astrologer, he was doubtlessly merely warning thepublic of an impending disaster. Yet the furore over Black Monday offers a glimpse at the extent ofearly modern comprehension that the astrologer was as much a subjective interpreter of the signs ofthe cosmos as an objective reporter. Indeed, ‘no real objectivity could – or can – exist in decipheringGod’s providence’.[121] The pamphlet discussed above seems to be most incensed over thisassumed authority and objectivity of the astrologers. The pamphlet perceives an astrologicalchallenge to the ‘common sense’ objective truth of God and His works, and to the scare-mongering ofsuggesting that God would abandon those who did not indulge in magical protection."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ELECTIONBy using ‘Elections we may Governe, Order and Produce things as we please: Faber quisq; Fortunæpropriæ [sic]’[122] This is how Ashmole extolled the great virtues of the practice of electingastrologically favourable times to begin a project. By understanding at what times the forces of theuniverse were well-disposed to support a particular kind of activity practitioners of astrology couldtake full advantage of such forces. The magus and court astrologer John Dee (1527-1609), was‘entrusted to choose the astrologically best fitting day for the coronation [of Elizabeth I (1533-1603)]in 1558.’[123] This illustrates the high regard in which elections were held and (although it arguablymarks an Elizabethan zenith in the appraisal of election astrology) the practice remained a ubiquitioustool in the arsenal of the practicing astrologer well after the seventeenth century. Astrologers couldelect a time for any conceivable question phrased “when should I do x?” Samuel Jeake, for example,seems to have used astrological means to decide when exactly to propose to the future Mrs Jeake,Elizabeth Hartshorne.[124] Ashmole frequently elected a time to make a journey. After setting one fora journey from London to Bradfield on the 27th December 1651, he reported ‘a journey of greatpleasure and good reception from friends.’[125] Elections not only ensured fate was not against youractions, but could maximise the success of the venture.A common topic of election included timings for the laying of foundation stones of buildings. VaughanHart describes how ‘by tradition foundation ceremonies were performed at specific times calculatedby astrology in an attempt to draw down favourable influence on the building work’, and quotes onecontemporary observing of building location regulations, that ‘Some doe seem a little Astrological’.[126] Jeake elected a time for the building of his new storehouse, and Hunter and Gregory observethat he even had this figure ‘let into the wall of the building like a kind of talisman.’[127] The trulytalismanic nature of such an engraving should be considered in the context of image magic and theprinciple of sympathy. As astrological glyphs were thought to attract the power of thing theyrepresented, an election figure adorning the project for which it was cast becomes as much of amagnet for the forces it depicts as a mere research exercise. Elections thereby demonstrate theinterlinked nature of astrological knowledge and action applications, and also highlight howastrology’s rationality cannot be clearly cut away from its magic. Just as knowledge and action aredemonstrably fused in knowing when best to act, so too are astrology and magic a co-dependentadmixture of symbol and utility. In election, the casting of a figure becomes more than measuring,even more than interpretation – it becomes a ritual in which certain times for action becomesacralised, emphasised as they are underlined with astrological significance.The practice of election demonstrates how astrological activity cannot be discretely divided betweenthe proto-scientific knowledge systems utilised in divination, and those more overtly magicalactivities (such as talisman construction) which were designed to have an effect on the world.Elections were divinatory, in that astrological symbolism was interpreted to discern information, butsuch information consisted of instructions for how to favourably affect a venture – knowing was"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"acting. Jeake’s storehouse election and talismanic engraving further complicates scholarly attempts todivide astrology between practices to gain knowledge and practices to affect things. Jeake’sastrological thinking can be located ‘partly in assessing the broad circumstances in which he came toimportant decisions and partly in choosing exact moments at which to execute his plans.’[128] Jeake,like other astrological practitioners, not only used astrology for gaining knowledge of the world, butalso for acting in it. Here I believe we glimpse the ways in which relatively widespread astrologicaldivinatory knowledge systems, which could be explored within a rational natural law-likedeterminism, could also quickly stray into the more ritualised ceremonies of effects-centredenchantment magic. Elections, by their very nature, were a practice of imparting the expressknowledge of how to affect a desired outcome. They represent how an astrological understanding ofevents also presented an opportunity to manage and manipulate such events prior to their occurrence.Such manipulation of events yet again illustrates how temporal context and human significance wereclosely united in a grand universal system of astrological meaning. People did not have to be at themercy of vast impersonal forces – astrological election offered a chance to utilise the ebb and flow ofcosmic assistances and hindrances for one’s own benefit. Elections allowed early modern astrologersand their audience to be active and responsible participants in an unfolding of destiny.Such an analysis is not merely the benefit of hindsight – early modern contemporaries were similarlyaware of the grey area into which elections fell between legitimate Christian natural philosophy andpowerful, even potentially questionable, sorcery. Such awareness is demonstrated by Jeake’s uneaseand defensiveness around the topic of elections, even in his own diary. Jeake makes an election buthides his confession of it in shorthand. Elsewhere Jeake repeatedly and somewhat defensively deniesmaking elections over activities typically elected for, such as making a long journey.[129] The fusingof magic and astrology, demonstrated in election, was clearly something understood by early modernpractitioners. Election was more than forecasting, it was enchanting.As has already been suggested in the discussion of astrology and agriculture, the most advantageoustimes to harvest plants and herbs in order to utilise their ‘occult virtues’ to maximum effect were alsogoverned by astrological considerations. Ingredients for medicinal or other magical usages wereastrologically encoded with layers of meaning and effect, directly dependent upon the time they werecollected for use. These astrological harvest timings were derived from the stars that were thought torule the plant or herb in question. Speaking of the herb angelica astrologer-physician NicholasCulpeper (1616-1654) advises ‘It is an herb of the Sun in Leo; let it be gathered when he [the Sun] isthere [Leo], and the Moon applying to his good Aspect; let it be gathered either in his hour, or in thehour of Jupiter [a planet ‘friendly’ to the Sun[130]]... Observe the like in gathering the herbs of otherPlants, and you may happen [to] do wonders.’[131] Astrology once more linked natural phenomena,such as the growth of flora, to the processes of time and destiny. Election furthermore underlinedparticular periods during which a plant or herb was considered especially significant, as astrologycombined a universal and interlinking system of meaning with notions of occult virtue."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ENVIRONMENTAL CONCLUSIONSIn the current scholarship of astrology, “natural astrology” has often been defined as dealing with this‘natural law-like determinism’ that linked it to approaches of natural philosophy. Yet this definitionimplicitly requires a distinction to be drawn between astrologies of nature and of magic, between thenatural and the supernatural, that does not seem to be justified by the majority of early modernastrological activity. It may be tempting for the modern secular materialist to consider nature the veryopposite of magic: one is evidently the measurable reality of the cosmos and can be subjected torigorous empirical testing, the other is essentially defined (in much modern parlance) as anythingoutside of the authority of physics, that which is relegated to the freakish, the non-normal, theunexplainable, even the fallacious or merely pseudo-scientific. This non-natural definition of magic,and even to some extent, this non-magical conception of nature, would be very alien to early modernthinkers.That is not to say that the term ‘supernatural’ itself was not used at all in the early modern period. Butit should certainly be noted that the word has very different meanings from the modern usages. It is,for example, used at one point in Agrippa’s Three Books to explain the magical principles ofreflection and sympathy:‘For this is the harmony of the world, that things supercelestiall be drawn down by the Celestiall, andthe super-naturall by naturall, because there is one operative vertue that is diffused through allkinds of things, by which vertue indeed, as manifest things are produced out of occultcauses...’[132]The supernatural is considered merely the superlunary influence drawn by the natural. MoreoverAgrippa suggests that, while these things are located in different tiers of the Neoplatonic cosmichierarchy known as the Great Chain of Being, they are of the same essential force. A natural thingmust possess its particular occult properties, essences or ‘vertues’, responsible for its form andfunction. This is the unity of manifest things in this world; that all of nature operates by such ‘vertues’.This is clearly not a use of ‘super-natural’ to support or encourage a separation between natural andmagical, and certainly not a bifurcation of early modern knowledge into exclusive categories ofrational empiricism and non-rational magic. The ‘one operative vertue’ is a description of theorganisation and operation of a holistic magical universe.[133]For astrologers, ‘nature was infused with divinity, spirituality and magicality’.[134] Patrick Curry,speaking of both astrologer-herbalist Nicholas Culpeper and the alchemist and physician known asParacelsus,[135] sums up this attitude as a ‘naturalism-cum-supernaturalism’.[136] Astrologyoperated in a natural and magical world. In the 1658 English translation of his Natural Magick,Giambattista della Porta (c. 1535-1615) – Anglicised to John Baptista Porta – explains the naturalbasis of this magic with particular reference to the advantages to be gained from studying the stars:"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"‘...I think that Magick is nothing else but the survey of the whole course of Nature. For, whilst weconsider the Heavens, the Stars, the Elements, how they are moved, and how they are changed, by thismeans we find out the hidden secrecies of living creatures, of plants, of metals, and of theirgeneration and corruption...’[137]It is these ‘hidden secrecies’ we should bear in mind when considering early modern occultphilosophy. The “occluded” element of magical practice seems less about veiled elite knowledgethan simply pursuit of the hidden inner workings of life. Bearing in mind that metals were commonlyregarded as organic, and thought to grow in the veins of the earth, Porta’s wider point seems clear.Each of the forms of life – animals, plants, metals – existed and functioned (literally) by virtue oftheir ‘hidden secrecies’. Such study of the occult virtues of things ‘openeth unto us the properties andqualities of hidden things, and the knowledge of the whole course of Nature...’[138]By comprehending the forces influencing one form of the life of the cosmos, one could get atprinciples that could be used to understand another form. This thoroughly rational conclusion wasarrived at from magical premises such as the principle of reflection: the laws of the macrocosmicstars could be applied to the microcosmically human scale – to empires and even individual patients.Thus a doctor of astrology could be a physicist, an economist and a physician. Astrology usedrational analysis to carry out magical activities – whether that was drawing influence into an object toact as a “fate-magnet” that would draw the desired change to us, or in manipulating the outcome ofevents by making judgements and actions based upon knowledge of occult properties and operations.We have seen in this chapter how magical tonics were sold against putrefactions expected as a resultof an eclipse; how agricultural elections attempted to ensure the best crop by knowing about themagical ways nature worked; and, finally, how amulets were used to affect nature directly. Alongwith providing illustrations of what natural magic looked like, we can draw a further significancefrom considering these examples of action in an early modern magical cosmos: that knowledge was ameans to action, of ensuring a useful and beneficial outcome. The use of amulets is perhaps the mostobvious form of this natural magical action, and one that deserves some further consideration.Keith Thomas stated in 1971, ‘the one widely practiced type of magic which rested on clearly statedastrological foundations was the construction of astrological sigils and talismans, in whichappropriate heavenly influences were caught like fruit as they fell and stored up for use whenneeded.’[139] While I contend that many other widely practiced forms of magic also depended onastrological principles, I thoroughly agree that the construction of sigils is perhaps the clearest linkbetween magic and astrology, and also the clearest example of the use of knowledge of magical natureto affect the world to one’s advantage. The streaming forces of the stars pulsed and fluxed inaccordance with God’s design, and attempts to collect such influences into suitably-markedcontainers were no more inherently unnatural or irrational than bringing in a crop at harvest-time.Nature appointed a time at which nourishment would sprout from the earth and fall from the skies. Acanny operator could catch the fruits of the stars just as they would pick the blooms of medicinalplants at the proper time of their blossoming."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Significantly, this consideration of the construction of astrological sigils as storing fruit is not one thatescaped early modern thinkers. Porta remarks of exactly such processes that, ‘as in Husbandry, it isNature that bring forth corn and herbs, but it is Art that prepares and makes way for them.’[140] Sucha comment highlights the importance of the artful craft of the magical operator, while also maintainingPorta’s characterisation of Magick as the ‘handmaid’ of Nature. We do not hold dominion over thestars, any more than we can command rivers, but we can make best preparation for their flow andeven harness their force for our mills.As a final comment, the totality of early modern nature’s domain should also be emphasised. Magicalastrological virtue and correspondence existed in all creation and in all processes. Astrology tracedthe lattices and knot-works of this web of correspondences, and astrologers picked harmonies fromthe strung threads of an interconnected universe.The symbolism of magic and astrology contributed significantly to human knowledge. The sevenfoldtaxonomy of planetary characteristics was used to understand many processes. Lilly’s angelicperiodisation explains history as the efforts and effects of people under particular celestial influence.It gives reasons why people acted as they did. It provided a basis for analysis of action. Astrologyexplored underlying forces to produce knowledge, which would affect action. From astrologicalconsiderations of the cyclicality of nature, predictive analytical activity (and not merely hindsightedexplanation) could take place. There was certainly a sense of “cosmological security” in having faithin nature’s predictability. Yet more than security, the prospect of foreknowledge allowed analysis tolook forward, to better one’s chances. Awareness of vast forces allowed the self-direction of efforts.Far from constructing a system of scapegoating the stars, I believe astrological activity couldencourage a responsibility for one’s actions, or at least an understanding that such actions did notoccur in an environmental vacuum. Astrologers were analytical “liminaries”[141] existing on thethreshold between people and their environmental context. Like the clergy, they acted as mediatorsbetween an underlying divine plan and the living of everyday life. Astrologers were a kind ofmagician, natural philosopher and speculative theoretician combined; exploring with great ingenuityand imagination the utility of their knowledge.Astrology dealt with knowledge of the underlying destiny of time and the natural world. Environmentwas not merely what surrounds us, not merely a location for human endeavour. Environment was aprocess and a unity. Nature was more than a static resource to be used; it was a total weave and weftof dynamic and interrelating rhythms of interaction. Astrological factors were similarly fluidinfluences. The waxing and waning of astral influences were in constant flux, as planets revolved intoand out of particular signs and configurations.Astrology united all natural phenomena by common analysis. The quotidian and small was linked allthe way up to the cosmically big. Indeed, it is this ‘comprehensiveness’ that Thomas remarks ‘madethe art so compelling.’[142] Astrology located human activity within a universal scale of meaning.Human activity became an expression of the universe, not merely an alienated agency acting in orupon it. Astrology made human action and experience part of the natural world. In this way, astrologyfostered a unique connection between people and environment."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"So astrology built and maintained conceptual bridges between identity and environment. This was notsimply a matter of “nature vs. nurture”. Astrology did more than present an initial nativity ofastrological factors governing a person’s life based on birth. It accounted for fluctuations in a vasthost of affecting influences throughout human experience. Astrology sought to locate all human acts(birth, sex, death and what happened in-between) within a context of influencing factors.[143] Wecould not, astrologically speaking, operate in a vacuum – no area of life was exempt fromastrological analysis. It was in this manner that astrologers operated as interpreters of theenvironment, communicating the significances of nature. Consideration of nature was a matter ofobservation, measurement and speculation, very like such contributions made by astronomy andnatural philosophy. Futhermore however, the symbols, conventions and assumption-structures ofastrology and occultism also contributed to understanding the significances and human meaning ofnature."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE POLITICALAs has been demonstrated, astrology extended analysis into all areas of human life: all events,tendencies, and eventualities could be investigated in the heavens. Historian of astrology Ann Genevamakes a striking analogy: ‘Like economists, astrologers rarely made correct predictions; yetuniversities granted degrees in the subject and few heads of state made a move without them.’[144] Itis this prestigious economist-like role that astrologers fulfilled with both judicial and horaryastrology – that is, making particular speculations and predictions about human events, either on abroad national political scale (the judicial) or a more detailed level of personal and individualproblems or concerns (the horary). Astrology provided an analytical system that could address thetotality of human experience. Economics was certainly one of the contexts of early modern living thatastrology touched upon, most often through a combination of these wider political judgements andpersonal consultancy that made up the workload of astrological practitioners. Yet the coming of thecivil war prompted a resurgence of specifically political astrological speculation.[145] After 1640political prognostication certainly became more specific, widespread and commonplace.[146] Thepolitical application of astrological prophecy even continued throughout the later Restoration Crisis.[147]George Wharton offers us the most common kind of argument that justified astrology as useful forpolitical analysis:‘Heaven...most effectually operates upon a Humane Body... and so also on the Body both of thePrince himself and his subjects ; to wit, so, as that it changes the Temperaments of Mens Bodies, andwith those Temperaments their manners or conditions: and the manners or conditions of Princes andSubjects being changed, a Mutation of the Common-wealth followeth.’[148]Astrology offered a way to comprehend how political developments emerged from changing humanpredispositions, especially those of autocratic leaders. Small wonder that ‘until nearly the end of the[seventeenth] century it remained conventional for most political issues to be given some form ofastrological expression.’[149] Astrology offered understanding of political affairs throughassessments of relationships between individuals and nature. It was the grand aspiration of astrologyto explore, as a unity, what has since been separated in modern assessments into natural philosophyand magic: to unite people and their environment, and the governing of humans and the wideruniverse, with a set of universally applicable frameworks. It was these aspirations that allowed theformulation of an astrological language for understanding politics to be so widely and usefullyutilised."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The term “judicial” is sometimes also used to refer to any astrological activities (such as horarywork) that did not fall into the category of “natural astrology”.[150] However as we have seen,natural astrology viewed the affairs of humans, along with their technology and culture, as equally asnatural as unspoilt wild environments. Both forms of astrology have a political dimension. “Judicial”as a general term for divinatory astrology is not a useful taxon, particularly if applied to astrologicalelections. Nevertheless, judicial astrology can be considered a unique type of astrological activity –that of making judgements on particular national political events. This definition of judicial astrologydistinguishes it from the personal consultancy of horary and nativity astrology although, as we shallsee, these two techniques were also used for expressly political purposes. One might be tempted todraw a distinction between astrological judgements on socio-political events based on humanknowledge and reason, and the prophetic judicial astrological appeals to God and magic – Ashmoledoes consider ‘Iudicall Astrologie... the Key of Naturall Magick, and Natural Magick the Doore thatleads to this Blessed [Philosopher’s] Stone.’[151] Yet the actual methods and practicalities of thesesupposedly different forms – of casting figures, interpreting their symbolisms, and extrapolatingprojections – are all too similar."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PROPHECYProphecy was a central part of the judicial astrologers’ craft. After all, ‘in the experience of mostpeople, politics, religion and eschatology were ultimately inseparable; and astrological prophecywas a common thread through all.’[152] The use of prophecy demonstrates the status and expertiseafforded to astrologers as analysts of future events. Astrologers interpreted the symbolic language ofprophecies into messages relating to contemporary affairs. In Monarchy or No Monarchy, Lillyprints ‘Grebner’s Prophecy of our late King and his sonne now King’ in Latin, and then literallytranslates it. Moreover, he provides a detailed analysis of these symbols following the translations, inparticular the ‘Lyon of the North’.[153] Lilly even goes on later to equate this ‘Lyon’ with the signLeo, and therefore with King Charles.[154] As a more general observation, it might helpunderstanding of the political role of an astrologer to note that a 1626 English dictionary has therather concise definition for “Astrologie” as ‘A foretelling of things to come’.[155] There is nospecific mention of stars. Astrologers could be forecasters of all things, a role certainly linked withastrology’s universal scope.The importance of prophecy in early modern English rebellions was both great and widely accepted.[156] When Rusche paraphrases Rupert Taylor’s The Political Prophecy in England as emphasisingthe cross-class appeal of political prophecy, he claims prophecies were well circulated by a varietyof sorts of people who ‘at times even acted upon them.’[157] These prophetic efforts were popular –it is claimed of Lilly’s version of the White King prophecy that ‘1,800 copies were sold in threedays, and it was often reprinted during the next few years.’[158] Rusche is cautious not to draw‘definite relationships of cause and effect between particular prophecies and specific historicalevents’, yet he nevertheless affirms that ‘prophecies were given so much attention during the civilwars that one can safely conclude that they were a factor in the political affairs of the period.’[159]Millenarian concerns, which combined astrology and eschatology with political analysis, were animportant factor – ‘it has been estimated some seventy-percent of the ministers supporting Parliamentsaw the conflict in millennial terms’.[160] Astrologers such as Christopher Ness also presented‘astrological and eschatological wonders firmly into the context of current English political events’during the Restoration Crisis.[161] The political dimensions of prophecy are clear in the work ofseventeenth-century judicial astrologers. Astrologers were occult interpreters, describing the shape ofthe future, and their audience was fascinated by their interpretations.As well as penning their own forecasts, many astrologers were in the habit of adopting older andestablished prophecies and giving them new contemporary interpretations. The works of MotherShipton provided particularly good utility to the parliamentary cause for example, as she predictedthat, following a violent conflict, ‘there shall never be warfare againe, nor any more Kings orQueenes’.[162] Lilly includes one of Shipton’s forecasts in an annotated summary of ‘severall ancientEnglish Prophecies, affirming there shall be no more Kings in England’ in his Monarchy or No"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Monarchy of 1651.[163]Another example of astrologers recycling prophecy is Lilly’s use of the long-extant Prophecy of theWhite King[164] to make dire warnings about the eventual downfall of King Charles I (1600-1649).By 1651 Lilly claimed that ‘Charls late deceased... was without dispute the true White King.’[165] In1644 Lilly combined this and a further prophecy known as The Dreadful Dead-man, taken from JohnHarvey’s A Discoursive Probleme concerning Prophecies (London, 1588)[166] to claim that‘Monarchy shall be eclipsed and darkened’, itself a phrasing not without portentous astrologicalsignificance.[167] Rusche seems certain that this identification of Charles with “the White King”would have been obvious to seventeenth-century readers, who would have been well aware that thisidentification would spell trouble for the king. Rusche even offers accounts of the Earl of Pembrokeattempting to persuade Charles to wear the traditional purple coronation robes by citing ‘the violentdeaths of Richard II and Henry VI, the two monarchs who had previously broken with tradition towear white at their coronations.’[168]Speculation on future events by astrologers was not limited to figures that they themselves cast.Astrologers’ primary role was to forecast the future by interpreting symbolism – whether that be thesigns in the stars or the predictions of ancient prophecy. Indeed, it has been pointed out that manyprophecies chiefly,‘drew their prestige from their antiquity, and that although some contemporaries discussed whetherthe prophets had got their foreknowledge from God, from conjuration or from astrology, there was onthe whole little interest shown in the precise origin and basis of such predictions. For most men itwas sufficient that they were there.’[169]This assessment not only illustrates an early modern prioritisation of the use of prophecy overassessment of fundamental truth value, it also demonstrates how astrology was co-mingled in popularconceptions with magic, and indeed religiosity and spirituality, as a means of synthesisingspontaneous knowledge.When discussing overlap between religion and astrology, particularly in the context of prophecy, weshould also include use of the Bible by astrologers. We have already discussed John Booker’s TheBloody Almanack, described by Rachum as ‘a pro-parliament presentation of John Napier’s 1593study of Revelation’[170] which attempted to synthesise astrological proofs of historical crises withsymbolism in Revelation to create both a periodisation of Christian history and a projected date forthe end of the world. It is certainly a drastic condensing of the some 280-page tome of John Napier(1550-1617) into an eminently more accessible 6-page almanac. Revelation, ‘always a rich source ofastrological symbolism’,[171] was also used by the minister Edmund Reeve (d. 1660) in his sermonThe New Jerusalem delivered to the Society of Astrologers at their feast on 8th August 1650.[172]Another Scriptural sermon delivered 1st August 1649 at the Astrologers’ Feasts was A New StarreLeading Wisemen unto Christ by clergyman Robert Gell (1595-1665) – as can be deduced from thetitle, this sermon discussed the ‘Star in the East’ which had led the Magi to the Christ-child.[173]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Astrologers of the Christian early modern period were understandably fond of using accounts ofprophecy from the Bible involving celestial events to argue for the legitimacy and authority of theircraft. Without entering into extended coverage of attacks and defences of astrology in this period, it ispertinent to note that the Bible has been described as ‘unfortunately... ambiguous’ on astrology’slegitimacy.[174] A favourite passage for astrologers was Genesis 1:14,[175] which was used as abasis for a sermon by Roman Catholic priest Richard Carpenter (1604/5-1670?).[176] It isCarpenter’s considered opinion that this passage should be read to say that ‘the Stars and Planets areSigns: as signifying in their motions, conjunctions, oppositions, risings, settings, occultations,apparitions, defections, and various Relations and Aspects; and as acting by theirinfluences.’[177] He follows this interpretation with an etymological proof – ‘Whence the Hebrewsname the Stars, Massaloth, being a word bred and born of Nazal, influere, to give influx orinfluence.’[178] Regardless of the accuracy of this assessment, such a case highlights how astrologersnot only interpreted the Bible, but even interpreted the Hebrew roots of its text. Prophecyreinterpretation by astrologers was demonstrably not to be limited to magical prophecy, nor torelatively contemporary divinely-inspired works, but included exegesis of established Biblical texts.Perhaps the most frequent reinterpretation of the astrology of others was in the refutations ofjudgements made by adversarial astrologers during the ongoing pamphlet propagandising around thecivil wars.[179] This was expressly the opposite of citing respected older works to increase therecognised legitimacy of one’s own prognostications. It was a battle of aggressive pop-academic one-upmanship, with the express purpose of both co-opting the astrological data used by rivals for one’sown ends and, as was more often the case, rubbishing the credentials of said antagonists. The latteractivity was far more common than the former, owing partly to common conventions of astrologicalsymbolism – most obviously, the Sun as a symbol of royalty and governors. As such, it was far morecommon to emphasise a part of a figure one’s rival astrologer had overlooked to arrive at anopposing viewpoint – and to undermine their political opinion. So, between ‘royalist astrologicalsymbolism’, such as that of George Wharton, and Parliamentarian symbolism, such as WilliamLilly’s, there were certainly different, even ‘inverted’, significances.[180] When interpreting a horaryfigure, set for the time of ‘His Majesties present Martch: begun from Oxford May 7 1645’, Whartonemphasises inter alia that ‘the Regall signe Leo’ is in the first house and that the Sun, Venus andJupiter are in fortuitous positions. He insists that ‘these are evident and undeniable Testimonies’ ofthe king’s success.[181] In contrast, Lilly claimed that the position of Mercury, ‘simply the moststrong in this present figure’ (a fact that Wharton affirmed by ‘his own words at this time’) meant thatthe victory assured in the figure would go to that which was signified by a sign ruled by Mercury. Inthis case, ‘Gemini is the ascendant of the City of London all Authors agree’, and seeing as Mercurywas ‘Lord of that signe’, Lilly interpreted the figure to mean that the ‘City and Citizens’ of Londonwould be victorious ‘by being the Kingdomes Bulwarke against Tyranny and Oppression.’ Hefurthermore added that ‘this city shall get into their power... all their enemies... for we see Mercurydisposeth of Jupiter.’[182] Such examples reflect ‘the remarkable flexibility of astrology as aninterpretive language system’.[183] They also further emphasise the interpreter role of astrologers,especially those making expressly political judgments."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Historians of science have relished emphasising the examples of empirical correlation that astro-meteorology so neatly provides. As mentioned above, the weather logs of Jeake and others offer muchto analyse.[184] However we should also remember that astrological meteorological analysis wasused for expressly political purposes, in prophesising the fate of kings and kingdoms from naturalportents. Geneva notes that the thoroughly political astrologer-prophet William Lilly made use ofseveral different celestial phenomena in his pamphlets, many of which had ‘long traditions ofinterpretive analysis within astrology: comets, eclipses, and the periodic conjunctions of... Saturn andJupiter’.[185] Eclipses and their astrological coordinates were used to demonstrate the natures ofpolitical organisations. On 3rd November 1640, Elias Ashmole noted in his diary: ‘At the first sittingof the Long Parliament the Sun was Eclipsed in 21 degr: of [Scorpio] and their actions were sutableto the falce viperous & trecherous nature of that signe, swift & violent as lightning.’[186] Celestialevents occurring at the outset of a venture were particularly useful in assessing the nature andsignificance of that venture. By finding and analysing a ‘sutable’ symbol or analogy (such as thescorpion), astrological knowledge about the signified organisation could be explored, and a politicalassessment could be quickly reached. Such an assessment also linked the event to a specific point intime, affording it a unique role in the overall destiny of the universe.The divinely-inspired or unveiled ancient wisdom of prophecy is based upon an often revelatoryunderstanding of fundamental forces underlying existence. Astrology and prophecy frequently cross-pollinated each other – astrological symbolism was frequently used to interpret the ‘wealth andpolyvalence of prophetic language’.[187] Their most frequently shared ground was politicalassessment and speculation. The distinction between rational human projections about future eventsand divinely-inspired prophecy was not a clear one. Both explanations for their methodologies wereused by astrologers in their predictions. Richard Napier reportedly summoned the archangel Raphaelto give patient diagnoses, discuss theology and deliver prophecy.[188] The astrologer acted as areceiver and relay for communications from the forces underlying mundane reality. This is asomewhat definitional model of the function of a prophet. The active conjuration of angels or othersources of divine knowledge however (rather than being visited unexpectedly or unbidden), asperformed by Napier and doubtlessly by other astrologer-magicians, presents a further complication.For astrologers, there was active engagement in seeking information and interpreting those answersinto action.For much of the early modern period leading up to the seventeenth century, astrologers had been ableto couch their prognostications in the language of visionary theology as well as that of “scientific”prediction. Lilly has been described as an astrologer ‘who could unselfconsciously... issue hispredictions as prophecies.’[189] In the early modern period, religiosity in politics was generallyconsidered a desirable if not downright necessary quality. We find then in political astrologicalactivity the means to marry broad religious knowledge and values with particular political decision-making and action. This seventeenth-century attitude has been summed up as being of ‘a time whennatural, civil and religious phenomena were still widely seen as connected, if not indeed one’.[190]Astrology could offer a means to practical piety, taking heed of the stars that God had set in theheavens to act as ‘signes’ to guide us."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Astrologers publishing political judgements on existing magical prophecies, even phrasing their ownpolitical predictions in visionary voices, demonstrate how astrology was considered within a widerscope of religious and magical activity, which also included conjuration of angels or spirits andmagical divination, as part of Christian spirituality and piety.[191] Astrology promoted theunderstanding of, and the operating within, a divinely-ordained magical natural world – that earlymodern viewpoint characterised as ‘naturalism-cum-supernaturalism’. Political astrology operated ina context that conflated intellectual, religious and magical roles. Likewise, prophecy demonstrateshow political wisdom did not always come from claims of the objective truth-value of statements,beliefs and actions, but often from practices designed to best illustrate particular links betweenpeople and the underlying divine order. Ottavia Niccoli, speaking of sixteenth-century Italy, hasobserved that ‘prophecy seems to have constituted a unifying sign connecting nature to religion andreligion to politics and coordinating all the scattered shreds of a culture that in the end turned out tobe an integral way of knowing embracing observation of nature, political analysis, and religiousreflection.’[192] I would suggest not only that this insightful observation rings true for the laterEnglish context of prophecy, but also for the astrology that was used to analyse, interpret anddisseminate such prophecy. The political context of astrology emerged from observing the influencesthat unite the microcosmic individual with the wider macrocosmic universe."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"ANALYSISAlong with examples of words with obvious linguistic foundations in astrological symbolism (e.g.“saturnine”) there are words in modern English usage that come directly from astrologicalterminology. The roots of the term “revolution” are astrological, and significant for considering thepolitical contexts of astrology and its efforts to combine the individual with the cosmos. The wordclearly originates in astrological and astronomical language, meaning the completion of a cycle,referring originally to planetary motion. In 1626 therefore ‘Reuolution’ was defined as ‘A winding orturning about, especially in the course of time.’[193] The intellectual cipher to unlocking the term’sshift from a purely astronomical measurement of time to one that signified change in human events iscertainly also astrological. As the planets completed their cycles, new astral influences permeated theworld, and “revolution” could therefore be used to discuss a transformation or new direction ofevents. Rachum traces a particularly significant usage of the word to physician Thomas Browne(1605-1682), who, along with using it in a traditional temporal periodic sense to refer to the‘revolution of Saturn’, wrote that ‘the glory of one State depends upon the ruin of another, there is arevolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and must obey the swing of that wheel’.[194] The termrevolution provides an example of the linguistic dimension of astrology’s contribution to earlymodern politics in particular and culture in general.Although the intellectual roots of this shift in meaning are undoubtedly astrological, Rachumexpresses puzzlement at a general ‘inability or unwillingness [of astrologers themselves] to employ“revolution” in a political sense’, especially during the very period when this new use of the termwas being popularised.[195] I would suggest that a lack of consideration of “revolution” as a specifictechnique of astrological activity in Rachum’s essay may at least help to explain this apparentrecalcitrance. “Revolution”, as well as being a term for periods of planetary cycles and thereforechange, also referred to an astrological practice whereby a new figure of the heavens was set for theprecise moment the sun re-entered the position it occupied at the moment of a person’s birth. The birthfigure was “revolved” or spun forwards like a clock, until the Sun came back to the position it hadoccupied before the revolution had been made. This ‘annual revolution’ of a nativity figure, havingshifted each of the stars around the chart, could then be interpreted to answer questions about thecoming year – uniting the native with factors that would affect them. The revolution was both apersonalised version of a horary chart and a modified type of nativity chart. It related the individual’sparticular astrological birth influences to the events in their life over a specific coming year. Ashmolerecords performing such a revolution in 1655.[196] His interpretation notes illustrate, as Jostenpoints out, ‘what fears and hopes occupied Ashmole’s mind at the time’.[197] One such hope was fora ‘reconciliation between the Native [i.e. Ashmole] & his wife’ which, sadly, the revolution onlydemonstrated ‘rather the Natives willignes to seeke it, th[a]n hopes of obteyning it’.[198] This annualrevolution also provided the native with a type of astrological early warning system. Noting theappearance of ‘[Saturn] in [Virgo] in [quartile] to the Ascendant of the Radix’, Ashmole judges thatthis will ‘afflict the Native with Melancholly and may occasion some sicknes.’[199]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Such an example demonstrates that revolution was already a type of intellectual activity forastrologers. The term already had general descriptive values, of a period of time and of change – yetalso had a specific technique and activity ascribed to it. I suggest then that this extant meaning orcontext of “revolution” as a thing that can be brought about by human activity, rather than aphenomenon that occurs to humans, may help explain why early modern astrologers themselves werenot typically users of the word in its modern political meaning, despite the newer term’s clearintellectual roots in astrology. The concept of participating in, instigating or making a revolutionwould already have a defined meaning for astrologers – of drawing up an annual revolution of anativity. Furthermore, such an activity demonstrates how astrology united personal identity andenvironmental factors, and how astrologers could make assessments about one’s future based uponinterpretation of one’s time of birth. Destiny was encoded within identity across time.These annual revolutions were not merely performed for individuals. This annual speculative figurewas also set for the world itself, and so called a Figura Mundi. Geneva provides an excellentdescription of this activity:‘political astrologers computed the celestial situation at the time of the world’s yearly ‘birthday’, thefirst day of spring, when the sun entered Aries. This world figure... was used by astrologers to makepredictions for the fate of the entire society, its rulers and ruling classes, harvest, plagues, famine,weather, as well as for ‘the people’ – anything likely to affect the society as a whole.’[200]It was this figure that almanac-writing astrologers made most use of to draw up their national andinternational appraisals and prognostications. Lilly based his Merlinus Anglicus Junior of 1644 onsuch a figure of the heavens at the time of this ‘Ingresse of the Sun into the first point of Aries’.[201]In this figure Mercury (described as ‘the father of lyes and untruths’) is to be found in Pisces (‘aCommon signe’) which tells us that it will ‘all this whole yeare... vex us with flying reports,continuall feares, false alarums, untoward speeches, contradictory news, lying messengers, andcozening Accomptants, Receivers, Treasurers, and the like’.[202] The overt but non-specific politicalimplications of this statement highlight the status of astrologers as political surveyors. Theyannounced the total character of the year’s political affairs. Crucially, interpretation of the figuramundi demonstrates again how astrology created meaning by exploring natural interrelations ofhuman political phenomena and the environment.The other crucial astrological activity to have a bearing on the political contexts of early modern lifewas the expressly political applications of horary questions and their resolutions. Ashmole madenotes of figures he cast which often related to political concerns – a figure cast on the 20th January1648 asks ‘whether the King shall be restored and whether his life be not in danger’.[203] Ashmolealso kept a close watch on the movements of the planets to deduce general political mood anddirection – between 7th and 31st January 1674 he ‘wrote notes on events in Parliament...accompanied by references to current astrological constellations’.[204] Moreover, Ashmole seemseven to have been asked for astrological council by Charles II himself, who had ‘asked Ashmole tocalculate and to interpret a horoscope for the time at which he began his speech at the opening of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Parliament on 27 October 1673.’[205] Likewise, many leaders and prominent figures of radical sects,not to mention Parliamentarians, consulted astrologers about how their particular political struggleswould fare, and there was ‘well-documented recourse to astrologers by radicals of all kind’.[206] Ithardly seems surprising, given the ease with which astrology could literally pluck politicalassessment out of the sky. Astrological questioning into political matters was a means of generatinginformation; themes, symbols and relations to be interpreted and applied to the situation at hand.Furthermore, this ritual of questioning and answering was initiated by referring to a chart created atthe very point of astrological intervention – when the astrologer was posed the question. Thispractice was explained on the grounds that ‘as the Nativity is the time of the Birth of the Body, theHorary Question is the time of the Birth of the Minde’.[207] The querent themselves was responsiblefor the timing of questioning, which (through horary ritual) would produce a snapshot of theastrological forces currently at work. The astrological action revealed knowledge and anunderstanding of the situation in question that could facilitate further and better action.Political speculation in astrology was not always explicitly voiced. Criticisms of the incumbentregime couched in the symbolic language of astrology could slip past the censors but be understoodby readers aware of astrological symbolism and cipher conventions. Lilly adopted a technique ofsubstituting the name or direct mention of King Charles with the 10th house of the heavens, theMedium Coeli.[208] Likewise, in his Anglicus for 1645, Lilly explained the ascendant (the firsthouse of the heavens) represented the people as a whole. He even went on to explain that suchsignifications could be used to astrologically determine, during ‘turbulent times, if...the successe[would belong] to King or People.’[209] Geneva cites Lilly’s January 1644 interpretation of thefigura mundi and judges that Lilly was using this interpretation ‘to cast doubt in a covert manner onthe public benefit of the peace articles’ negotiated secretly between King and Parliament, whichbecame public knowledge by December 1643.[210] Lilly’s interpretation (in the final printedversion) claims that the peace articles, represented astrologically by Venus and Jupiter, ‘behold thetenth house with trine aspect, which is of love and affection: but I say... neither Venus or Jupiter dobehold the ascendant... the Articles themselves shall have more in them, which may advance thedesires of those signified by Medium Coeli, th[a]n the good of the people signified by theascend[ant]’.[211] Lilly was making a political astrological analysis of the treaty as favouring theKing more than “the People”. Such an opinion is confirmed by Geneva’s citation of earlier manuscriptversions of this interpretation, where Lilly unveils his coded language: ‘the tenth house representinghis Maty: and the ascendant the Parl’.[212] Specific references to the King and Parliament wereexcised from the final print version, allowing the document to slide under the radar of Presbyteriancensors while still being understood by those aware of the cipher key.This substitution ciphering was not limited to a few astrologically savvy practitioners – suchsubstitutions would have been well understood by many people.[213] Even if the codes wereoccluded enough to pass by censors, ‘judging... from the sales figures the public were not so slow-witted.’[214] Substitution not only refined the accuracy of interpretation, but meant that astrologycould operate as a secret code language. Coding creates cases where action requires knowledge. Onemust know the code to be able to unlock it – and to use it for one’s own purposes. Through coding,astrology made itself politically necessary. It could be criticised, but if it was used by one’s enemies"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"it must nevertheless be used to decipher their information. On the battlefields of civil warcryptography and intelligence, where astrology was a weapon employed by both sides, knowledgeand action were intrinsically linked.[215]"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"INTERPRETATIONIn their role as interpreters of the heavens, astrologers were in a unique position to offerinterpretations of both the natural development of events and of divine favour or wrath. The mainmeans of dissemination of judicial astrology was the almanac, which was ‘after the Bible, by far themost popular kind of literature in seventeenth-century England.’[216] Along with guidelines andadvice on weather and agriculture, almanacs contained specific predictions about the resolution ofparticular political events. After all, ‘natural sympathy or concord (antonym = antipathy/discord)between human microcosms and the universal macrocosm underscored a universal interdependence,rendering individual morality relevant to the state of the commonwealth, just as the position of thestars influenced events in the world and personal behavior.’[217] Astrology could not only giveexplanation for the underlying mechanics of politics, but actually offer moral judgements on both aneventual outcome and how best to respond.In a 1660 speech to the houses of Parliament, the author – whom Rachum suggests was politicianEdward Hyde (1609-1674), ‘the man who had successfully negotiated Charles II’s return’)[218] –lays out a thoroughly astrological explanation of the Interregnum upheaval of the old royalist orderand the Restoration return of monarchy. The speech initially lays out an exoneration of the republicanbehaviour of the nation as a whole, insisting ‘Let us not be too much ashamed... [for] The Astrologershave given us a fair excuse, and truly I hope a true one; all the motions of these last Twenty years havebeen unnatural, and have proceeded from the evil influence of a malignant Star’.[219] Such acelestial harbinger of disorder had affected ‘the humor, and the temper, and the nature of our Nation.’There was to be a minimum of recrimination, partly because the deviant actions of the Republic werebeyond the responsibility of individuals, and partly because this evil had now run its course – ‘thesame Astrologers assure us, that the malignity of that Star is expired; the good genius of thisKingdom is become Superior, and hath mastered that malignity, and our own good old Stars govern usagain’.[220] Monarchism had ‘mastered’ republicanism, exactly as the old stars had vanquished thisrecent astrological malignancy.Sensibility and order had returned with the good old stars, ‘and their influence is so strong, that withour help, they will repair in a year what hath been decaying in twenty’. Now was to be a time ofrebuilding, not of finger-pointing. Such an astrological characterisation of events allowed anabsolution of the grievances of the civil war, yet it also laid down a line in the sand on this amnesty.Those who continued their radical disruptive activity and ‘malignity’, who now ‘have no excuse fromthe Star... [would] own all the ill that is past to be their own, by continuing and improving it for thetime to come.’[221] The past twenty years could be excused as a brief madness, in which the nationhad taken leave of its senses under the influence of evil stars, but those who persisted in disruptive ortreasonous activity would now have no such insanity plea to protect them. This was an astrologicalultimatum issued by the resumed royalist order to the former dissenters – the time of civil unrest andpanic was over, order had been restored, and anyone continuing this fit of temporary national insanity"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"would be personally prolonging damaging behaviour and held fully accountable. Astrology providedpolitical assessment both exoneration and subsequent potential culpability. Blaming past stars alsoabnegated guilt whilst stressing a renewed sense of responsibility.It would be a severe disservice to astrology’s contribution to language to say that it merely providedparticular words or definitions. Astrology could identify forces that underpinned political events –indeed the same forces underlying the universal totality of events – and was therefore able to analyseparticular expressions of those forces in a systemised methodology of observation and interpretation.Astrology could even locate, identify and justify particular significances of and from occurringevents. Its universal scope allowed particular political events to be analysed for general assessmentof political zeitgeist, as well as observations of general trends to be distilled into predictions ofparticular activity. Astrology actually framed discourses of political speculation, simultaneouslyinterconnecting both the environment and the individual to form political assessment, speculation andjudgement."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PROPAGANDAAstrological characterisations of the meaning of events had powerful effects on seventeenth-centurypolitics. The astrologer almanac-writers occupied a privileged position as potent politicalinterpreters for the public. These interpretations were a key use of astrology – ‘their effect on thenational morale was great... the role of the astrologer as a propagandist during the decade ofturbulence from 1640 to 1650 became both significant and profitable.’[222] Astrological readingsand judgements of political events were certainly not an invention of the early modern period, yetmeanings derived from particular conjunctions had been traditionally couched in generalisations.These generalisations of classical astrological meanings were made specific in this period ofpolitical instability and uncertainty: ‘where the textbook states that a particular conjunctionforeshadowed the death of a ruler, or some upheaval in the church, the almanac-maker was willing topublish a specific and partisan judgement on an individual, party or sect.’[223] Astrology offeredparticular and definitive political projections, speculations, and analyses that were used for expresslypolitical ends.Astrologers could offer assurances of victory through assessment of figures, as in the case of Lillyand Wharton’s differing astrological interpretations of the king’s march from Oxford.[224] This wasfar from an isolated incident. Lilly’s almanac for 1646 contained the judgement that ‘some shatteredBrigade of his Majesties may move West or Norwest ; they have ill successe, as the [quartile] of[Saturn] and [Mars] tells me’.[225] Such a prediction had a double effect in strengthening the resolveof Parliament and their supporters whilst simultaneously weakening that of the Royalists.[226]Assurances for one side were, of course, also warnings to the other.Another type of astrological political speculation was the study of ruler’s nativities. This wassomewhat of a risky business – laws prohibited the calculation or consideration of such genitures,and several practitioners were imprisoned for just this.[227] The illegality of such activity itselfprovides us with an idea of how powerful such a practice was considered. Calculating a regent’s lifeexpectancy was ‘in popular estimation... not far removed from malevolent conjuration to take awaythe ruler’s life.’[228] Gadbury admits that ‘The Politician takes cognizance of the great dangers, andeminent disadvantages[,] the making known a Princes destiny may do him.’[229] Astrology wasdangerous not because it was inherently diabolic or evil but because it was a powerful tool. Herewas an early modern grasp of an interrelation of knowledge and action, and of foreknowledge andeffect, as well as of astrology and magic. The nativity figure did hold enciphered symbols that couldbe related to the native’s time and manner of death: Lilly describes the eighth House’s ‘nature andsignification’ as ‘Death, its quality and nature... What kinde of Death a Man shall dye’.[230] Perhapsbecause of this concern, it was considered more acceptable to publish an exact geniture once thenative was deceased, which supported an astrological practice of analysing recent political historyusing the nativity figures of recent rulers. Gadbury’s Nativity of the late King Charls was subtitledwith Reasons in Art Of the Various Success, and Mis-fortune of His Whole Life – tellingly, it was"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"further subtitled ‘a brief History of our late unhappy Wars.’ Astrology once more united the individualand the events surrounding them. It described history as the actions of people, and analysed them bymapping influences of divine forces.Astrological interpretation was used to spin nativities to fit particular assessments of the ruler’scharacter. Royalist Gadbury’s ‘general judgment’ for Charles’ nativity considers the chart to‘Astrologically demonstrate the temperature of this native to be Sanguine Cholerique; which humorsprevailing, argued him to be of disposition and behavior courteous, and affable, yet Princelike,magnanimous and imperious.’[231] In contrasting opinion but with similar technique, Lilly judged ofthe king, ‘He had the signe Leo ascending in his Nativity... which made him so obstinate.’[232] Re-prioritisation of emphasis in nativity analysis could yield wildly different characterisations of rulers.Astrological knowledge could provide “proofs” for opposing interpretations, each of which wouldhave a political effect and reaction. Explanation of the strengths or weaknesses of a ruler was apolitical action facilitated by astrological knowledge.The personality of the monarch was explained by the nativity figure for expressly political reasons.Reasonably enough, the personalities of rulers (particularly the powerful ones of pre-modern times)are still held to be an important part of political analysis. Thomas makes comment on both thefunction and importance of this political psychology of astrology:‘In an age of near-absolute monarchy the attention paid to the horoscopes of royal princes was fullyjustified. The political history of a nation could to some extent be explained in terms of the individualpsychology of its rulers.’[233]These astrological assessments of the personalities, proclivities, foibles and idiosyncrasies ofpolitical leaders were not simply ad hominem attacks, although certainly this was also popular.When speaking of powerful autocrats, the personal(ity) was the political.The sheer utility and power of astrology meant that ‘during the civil war Royalists andParliamentarians alike exploited the propaganda value of astrological predictions’.[234] In order torepudiate negative judgements it became necessary to use an astrologer to catch an astrologer. Ruscheconjures a wonderful image of an occult dimension to the civil war: ‘while the armies of KingCharles and parliament fought in the fields, the astrologers chose to defend their causes with theiralmanacs in the personal and vitriolic battle of words.’[235] This battle of words betweenastrologers was not restricted to interpretation, but also to critical analysis of the work of otherastrologers. Wharton criticised Lilly and fellow Roundhead astrologer, John Booker, saying ‘art notyou [Booker] and Mr. Lilly alike ashamed, to account your selves Masters in Astrology, when...neither of you have yet attained so much skill, as to set a Figure of Heaven exactly?’[236] Much ofthis conflict was made up of slander and personal attacks: for example, the satirical altering ofWharton’s anagrammatic pen-name “Naworth” to “No-worth”.[237] Such attacks were more thanchildish squabbling. Upon the battlegrounds of rival almanacs, the political had become the personal,for ‘to attack the man was to attack his ability to defend his political position.’[238]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Astrological propaganda highlights the importance of the astrologer’s role as interpreter of the divineordering. Their interpretations were, politically, very useful. Astrologers offered assurances ofvictory, justifications of political acts, political assessments of recent events, and counter-analysisand refutations against the astrological propaganda efforts of one’s enemies. This activity was backedup by interpretations of divine favour for whichever side that particular astrologer backed. Lilly isunselfconscious in announcing in the postscript to The Starry Messenger: ‘God is on our side ; theConstellations of Heaven after a while will totally appeare for the Parliament’.[239] Astrologicalknowledge of divine underlying forces informed and justified political action. It thereby linked notonly politics and religion, but also humanity with its environment – our political ordering and activitywas a rung on a ladder bridging the individual and the entire universe happening with (rather thanmerely around) us."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"POLITICAL CONCLUSIONSWhat is evident from this study is that astrologers were more than assessors – they were interpreters.They were analysts, deriving detail from stylised data-sets, and their focus was the future. They wereto be experts on foreknowledge of all kinds. Astrology was itself after all a form of prophecy. Theirskills of interpretation and reinterpretation allowed generalised knowledge to be specified into aforecast of a specific outcome. This was especially useful in political judicial work. Prophecy, andastrology in general, characterised politics in a language of symbols and analogy. Differentastrological interpretations of events were methods of modelling not only the political subject (be itevent, group, individual or mood) but the universal totality of contexts in which the subject existed.Religious as well as occult knowledge informed political action via astrological knowledge.Political contexts were dependent upon a co-mingled religious, environmental and magical discourse.Astrologers were intermediaries between divine underlying cosmic processes and the organisation ofhuman affairs.Astrological knowledge was not interested in scientifically provable abstract truth value – or rather,it already assumed the hidden but theologically imminent truth value of astrological correspondences.It was interested in how this astrological knowledge was utilised, what function it performed, how itcontributed to or detracted from what it analysed, explained and interpreted. When astrologyexplained historical processes and recent events, it was affecting the subject of its study through itspositive and negative assessments. Natural portents characterised political organisations andtherefore fostered judgements of and reactions to them, while astrological propaganda had an affecton what it measured or talked about – intentionally aiding the culmination and fruition of theirpredictions. Astrological modelling shaped perception, understanding and, ultimately, further action.The extent of this can be seen in the ways in which astrology made itself politically necessary throughsubstitution codes and counter-astrology. The action of deciphering and answering the interpretationsof one’s rivals depended upon astrological knowledge.Astrology analysed the shifting foundations of politics, offering insider information on the waypolitical events were developing. It interpreted the continuum of political contexts as a multitudinousseries of cycles, constantly beginning and ending. Beginning gave a new opportunity to examine theastrological factors surrounding political events through horary consultation and election. Endings ofold influences stressed a new sense of responsibility, and themselves gave way to new beginnings,for astrology had no place for vacuums. Political horary astrology used knowledge to affect situationsthrough interpreting and analysing. The political activities of astrologers during the civil warhighlight how tangible action was just as much a part of being an astrologer as predicting andprinting.So astrology combined the specific practicalities of analysis and action with the abstractuniversalities of religious and spiritual occult principles concerning the nature of God, the ordering of"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"His creation, and (most importantly) how all these things would fit together in the future. Asintermediaries, the religious role of astrologers could stray dangerously close to that of priests, eveninterpreting and espousing their own Scriptural truths. We see this especially in the various exegesesof Revelations by pamphleteers and almanac-writers.[240] Prophecy and astrology were a potentcombination – prophecy benefitted from astrology’s ability to provide justifications and specificityusing a wealth of symbolic taxonomies, and astrology benefitted from the prestige and popularity ofprophecy.Even beyond theological exegesis, the delineations between the roles of priest and magician in anaturally magical world frequently overlapped. The clergyman, astrologer and magician RichardNapier did not simply carry out these roles as separate and discrete interests; they were frequentlycombined and interrelated to inform and strengthen the functions he was called upon to perform.[241]As we shall see later, there are cases of seventeenth-century priests actually carrying out theirastrological calculations upon their church altars, combining their occult and spiritual activities in thesame consecrated physical spaces, utilising the same sacred equipment.[242] The astrologer relied onmodels and principles of God’s plan that were magical and religious. This is not to suggest astrologyattempted to usurp established Christian religion, rather that it existed as a parallel to the Church as apractical Christian spiritual practice. Astrology worked towards discovering and interpreting thedivine imperative in specific human action, and particular political organisations of human life.The civil wars offer a variety of cases of the desirability of such discovery and interpretation. Thereare frequent requests from both sides of the conflicts for astrologers to give straightforwardprognostications about whether particular political endeavours would be successful, such as CharlesII’s consultation with Ashmole. There were also calls for clarifications and verifications. In a sectionof Lilly’s astrological handbook, Christian Astrology, entitled ‘If a Report or common Rumour wereTrue or False’, Lilly presents, as a working example of such a verification method, a figure of theheavens at 4:31 p.m. on 11th April 1643 analysed to ascertain whether accounts ‘that his Majesty hadtaken Cambridge’: from the evidence of, inter alia, the square aspect of Saturn and Mars, he judgedthe rumours false.[243] Astrologers were not simply long-sighted soothsayers proclaiming vaguefinal outcomes: they were up-to-date providers of information on shifting battlefields where accuratereconnaissance was scarce and quick decisions required.To consider both the magic and rationality of such consultations, we can study in more detail the caseof Lilly’s work for prominent Leveller leader Richard Overton, answering ‘whether, by joining withthe agents of the private soldiery of the Army for the redemption of common right and freedom to theland and removal of oppressions from the people, my endeavours shall be prosperous or no’.[244]Thomas points out that Overton was hardly thought a “superstitious” man: indeed, he quotes P.Zagorin’s assessment that the radical leader was a firm ‘rationalist’ who rejected dogmaticunquestioning belief.[245] Overton’s note of April 1648 asking for Lilly’s expert astrological opinioncannot therefore be regarded simply as the actions of a simple, gullible or “backwards” man, butrather a rational decision-maker taking full advantage of every means at his disposal to investigateand analyse a complex and shifting political situation.[246]"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The recourse to astrological investigation and analysis itself was also an act requiring certaininherently magical ideas about the generation of knowledge through understanding occult virtues intime, and even of underlying interrogations of fate and destiny. The ritual of horary astrology investedthe querent themselves directly in the process of divination – the time they put their question to theastrologer was the “random input” element necessary for divinatory knowledge-generation. This veryprocess highlighted deeply occult principles underlying astrological practice: everything wasconnected, reflected and reflecting. There was in fact no “randomness” when it came to destiny,merely the time ordained to act – to enquire and to decide – encoded within which was anunderstanding waiting to be unfolded. Determining a correct time, as in election, and deciphering sucha time’s meaning, as in horary work, were intensely political acts.Astrology’s magical roots also nourished the political usage of images, amulets and other enchantment– perhaps the most obviously magical of the occult means by which one could harness astrologicalforces to one’s benefit. Just like the astrological images used in agriculture, images could also beconstructed at appropriate times to bring to the bearer various political advantages. They could bemade for the benefit of a particular government so as to ‘causeth nobleness, height of a kingdom, andgreatness of dominion’[247] or to ‘giveth power, nobility, and dominion over people’[248] toambitious individuals. These astrological images could also be used to bring occult aid to thedisenfranchised and oppressed, as with the image of the first face [decan] of Libra:‘...the form of an angry man, in whose hand is a pipe, and the form of a man reading in a book; theoperation of this is in justifying and helping the miserable and weak against the strong and powerfuland wicked...’[249]Such political utilities of talismanic objects also included forms of magical sabotage: an amulet of thetwenty-fourth mansion of the Moon could be used ‘for the victory of soldiers’, yet it also ‘hurteth theexecution of government’.[250]Politics existed within a magical framework of reality, and was subject to the liminal forces thatgoverned the individual as an expression of nature. Magic was the hidden physics of divine nature,and astrology merely another means to categorise and therefore comprehend and manipulate it.Politics is sometimes defined as processes for determining the best acquisition and use of resources.By this kind of understanding, the early modern magical universe was certainly politicised in anumber of magical ways. The Great Chain of Being essentialised a naturally hierarchicalunderstanding of power, and by extension the mandate to wield it, as emanating and descending fromGod the Highest through to humans. Whether one distinguished different rungs on the ladder fordifferent humans made the difference between divine right and mortal equanimity before the Almighty.[251]Astrology mapped essential natures in an interrelated context of influences. The nature of literally anyphenomenon existed in relation to the surrounding forces which could be mapped by the movementand influence of the stars. Celestially-influenced predispositions of individuals and groups to certainbehaviour or outcomes could be used to inform the astrologer about distinct culminations of these"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"moods into particular events. Likewise, these particular events could be analysed to extrapolate anassessment of a larger astrological picture. Early modern English politics owed a lot to thisastrological picture, for it was a picture of the universe and how humans regulate, have regulated andwould continue to regulate themselves and their affairs.Political astrology took example from the rule of nature by the stars. Curry divides astrology of thisperiod into elite types, characterised by Ashmole and the autocratic and authoritarian doctrine ofinferiors being forced to obey superiors, and democratic types, characterised by Lilly and his maxim‘non cogunt’ – that the stars incline, but do not compel.[252] Whether an invisible iron fist or a gentlehelping hand, seventeenth-century politics recognised the touch of the stars in all of life, especiallynational political life. Astrology understood politics by looking at how individual and environmentinterrelated in a mutually cohesive and symbolically demonstrable relationship. Astrologersinterpreted symbols to form a comprehensive discourse, which worded discussion, analysis andjudgement of political contexts in the language of social and environmental contexts.Natural portents were assessed against an individual’s nativity chart to locate significant correlations,contrasts and emphases. Similarly, the freeze-framed star-map of a nativity was manipulated to revealsecrets about the native’s relations with the world – the figure revolved forward to portray actions inthe coming year. Astrological enquiry sought after an idea of destiny encoded within individualidentity – the nativity was an outline of birth’s threshold between the personal and the environmental.Politics was both a process of individuals being swept along by vast underlying forces, and also themanifestation of human avatars of these divine forces. A political actor could come to represent theastrological forces that characterised them, as a crystallisation of these influences in physicalinteraction with the universe and humanity’s ordering of it. This was an astrological explanation ofpolitics as the striving of groups as well as individuals to affect their environment. Astrology alsolooked to the environment for its influence upon political affairs. Analysis of the figura mundiextrapolated and interpreted political significance from the turning of the year. The environment wasstudied to provide insight into the nature of all things – especially politics. This was thecomplementary astrological view of politics as the dynamics of nature affecting groups and thereforeindividuals. In this early modern astrology everything affects everything else all the time.Overall, politics was an expression of complexity in this universal astrological system of meaning.Politically-minded astrology was a total investigative system that mapped the actions of individualsand groups. What politics searches for, especially upon the verge and in the midst of great actions thatwill affect many – such as civil war, the Commonwealth, and even Restoration of the old regime – isexplanation, analysis, assessment and, above all, justification. Astrologers provided a vital service inthe political contexts of seventeenth-century England, precisely by using a system that united allcontexts."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE SOCIALAstrological knowledge and action affected conceptions of different scales of meaning – the nature oftime, eschatology and destiny – and ideas about how a magical universe affected human life. Finallytherefore, we come to the social contexts within which astrology operated. These social contextsconsist of two areas. There is what we can call societal astrology – the exploration of astrologicalforces and influences underlying human society as a whole. This included judicial astrology thatlooked to the forces underpinning politics itself and explored astrological considerations of societyas a more foundational level of complexity. It made pronouncements about the essence of society, howsocial developments would unfold, and by what fundamental principles it operated.The second area could be called personal astrology, and concerned itself with resolving individuals’personal issues. This type of social astrology included the services, assistance and adviceastrological practitioners offered to clients. Personal astrology ranged from divination to finding lostor stolen property to counsel over all kinds of personal problems. Crucially, it also offered varioussolutions to the problems it could detect and explain. This function of astrology was the key to themost popular and important form of personal astrology – medical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.Astrology explored the universal undercurrents of human existence and experience. Social astrologycovers both the outlining of temperaments of an individual, and developments of society as a whole,because it conceived the two as united. It analysed individuals as forming complexes of socialinterrelations, and considered these individuals within a total context – providing theories andtechniques important for analysing everyday personal life and for mass social trends and events. Asthe stars predispose or “tempt” individuals, so the society those individuals make up experiencesparticular social, political and economic phenomena.The manner in which individual and society reflect each other is also profoundly magical. Themicrocosmic activity and passivity of the human scale was used to model the macrocosmic processesand behaviours of society – just as the practice of the revolution of a person’s nativity chart was alsoutilised in the figura mundi to tell of the world’s fate. This anthropocentric evidence base forunderstanding the cosmos was based on the occult principles emphasising the fundamental naturalunity of all scales, human and universal. The actions of the stars would excite particular behavioursfrom a kingdom just as they would an individual. This influence on and of individuals is at the root ofall social astrology.We observe in social astrology the unification and intermingling of the three strands of this book’sassessment.

Events that our modern assessment might deem socio-economic, aswell as ‘sweeping political and religious changes’[253], were considered to be kinds of naturaldisasters which could be predicted by astrological activity. However, societal astrology did notsolely concern itself with these sudden sweeping changes. It was also interested in developingrelatively subtle speculation on social theory. While headmaster and early meteorologist John Goad(1616-1689) is often mentioned, like Jeake, for keeping records of weather conditions, it has alsobeen remarked that he ‘must have been one of the earliest writers to notice that suicide rates varyaccording to the time of the year.’[254] Goad reasoned that such a phenomenon could be explainedastrologically, given that the planets affected the weather and ‘as the Physician knows the Delirium ofhis Feavourish Patient is heightened by the Intemperance of the Weather.’[255] Societal astrologydealt with a social phenomenon such as suicide by examining astrological influences upon theindividual, then following this influence up into general social theory.Goad had ‘observed various Alterations and Emotions of Spirit under [conjunctions of] [Saturn][Jupiter], Visible in Melancholly, Griefs, Distractions, Phrensies, Lunacies, &c.’[256] Heconjectured that ‘those unhappy Felo’s de-se, that make away themselves by what kind so ever; I dosuspect are the worse... through the Potency of the [Saturn-Jupiter] configuration’.[257] Manypsychological afflictions were held to be capable of causing bodily malfunction in early modernEngland, and could even be fatal. It was not uncommon during this period to list a cause of death as‘grief’, ‘despair’, ‘fright’, or even a broken heart.[258] John Graunt’s study of the Bills of Mortalityclaims that in 1632, 11 die of ‘Grief’, 5 of ‘Lunatique’ and, particularly pertinent to our study, 13 aresimply listed as being killed by ‘Planet’.[259] The influence of the planets was thought powerfulenough to be able to predispose to fatality on occasion.Goad put forward the idea that, far from separate phenomena, fatal psychological conditions (such asearly modern conceptions of grief) might be considered different expressions of an overall form ofunbalanced mental health, a conclusion reached in part by noticing that ‘Grief, Lunacy, and theMelancholly Desperado are carryed forth in the same Weekly Sheet to be buryed.’[260] Time asviewed using astrological symbolism and enciphering could itself be utilised as a critical tool forassessing human lives, particularly the circumstances and factors influencing the actions of peoplewho deliberately ended theirs. Goad declared a link between a particular sort of personal humanevent and the astrological influence that underlay the passage of time. He collected and presentedcases of periods of high suicide rates, and also observed periods of non-activity.[261] He was quickto point out he was not positing a simple causal relationship between suicide and particular planetaryaspects.[262] Rather, that ‘Minds, Sickly, and Crazy, and Distemper’d by our natural Weakness... arenot able to stand under the harsher temptations of the Planets.’[263] The stars inclined the natural"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"tendencies of individuals (and humanity as a whole), but did not directly force the behaviours theyprompted or encouraged. The use of the term “temptations” seems a particularly good indication ofthis assessment of the stars’ exact influence. Nature obviously affected an individual – just as beingwet and cold would encourage pneumonia, so exposure to the stars would doubtlessly affect aperson’s mood and mental state. Environment had a tangible effect on mental and physical balance.As we shall see later, early modern notions of mind and body (and therefore treatment of maladies)were complex and interrelated.[264] Likewise, we shall return to seventeenth-century suicide in thecontext of magical medicines, regimes and talismans.[265]In early modern analysis of suicide, a topic which itself seemed to become less taboo across theperiod,[266] we can observe the universality of astrology’s use as a tool for discussion andexplanation. Goad was firm in his faith that ‘even the Melancholly Secrets of Nature may be pryedinto’.[267] From reproduction, to survival, to death, there was no aspect of human social existencethat could not be interpreted using astrological techniques and symbolism. The comprehension ofcontexts of influence added to a growing compassionate appraisal of suicide. Furthermore theinfluences on social and psychological existence that astrological analysis could describe, model andpredict were actually posited to underpin political events. As Goad asks in the rhetoric of an earlymodern astrologer and psychologist, ‘what should I meddle with Discords, Tumults, Seditions, Wars,Rebellions, Treasons, Imposters, Sectaries, False-Prophets... all these proceed from a Diseased Mindand ungovern’d Passion, a Zeal that cannot be justified, Pride, Envy, Wrath, Heady, Hair-brain’dTemper, which... helps make Dangerous times’.[268] Politics was an expression of deeper factorsshaping human existence; matters of material, social and psychological significance. Far from thestars “causing” a king to be killed, they represented the social forces that would lead to regicide.Thomas has stated that ‘in their confident assumption that the principles underlying the developmentof human society were capable of human explanation, we can detect the germ of modern sociology’.[269] I would go further and suggest that astrology fulfilled the role and functions for early modernpeople that sociology and many other social sciences fulfil for us today. Instead of being consideredproto-sociology, I would argue this kind of analysis and activity forms a fully fledged early modernsociology, one based upon astrological assumptions, tools and techniques rather than modernscientific ones. Astrology presented a system to understand and analyse all other systems. It was aninterpretive craft that explained human existence and experience, and was dependent upon magicalpremises to explore, understand and manage the links between the individual and environment.There is in Goad’s analysis of suicide a certain admixture of what would previously have been callednatural and judicial kinds of astrology. By instead examining astrology in particular contexts, in thiscase the social, we see that such distinctions are not easy to maintain. By attempting to understand andexplain human endeavours and catastrophes of both personal and national scales, natural astrologyinformed conceptions of the very origins of the political contexts with which predictive judicialastrological activity concerned itself. To distinguish between natural and judicial one could say thatnatural astrology made predictions about general trends (“suicide rates will increase as Saturn entersconjunction with Jupiter”) while judicial astrology made predictions about general events(“Scorpio’s strong position shows the king will lose the war with Parliament”). The latter could beconsidered expressly socio-political, whereas the former was, in the broadest sense of the word,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"environmental. The term socio-political is a highly appropriate one, given the characteristic mannerwith which astrology assessed the politics of a particular time and the general laws and forcesshaping society within the same analysis. The term “environmental” is used to indicate both thenatural workings of nature, yet also to show that deeper environmental forces had a massive influenceon how political events themselves were judged to be formulated from human social interaction. Anydelineation between different forms of astrological methodology, such as attempting to distinguishbetween magical and empirical activities, must be aware of overlapping grounds. The search tounderstand natural processes was accompanied by a search for a beneficial outcome for humanendeavour. Although theory and approach of natural and judicial might be separated by respectiveemphases upon empiricism and magic, they exist as bandwidths on a single astrological spectrum.Moreover, there is certainly crossover between the more “proto-scientific” natural astrology andmore “magical” astrology in their practices, particularly when it came to actually doing something toalleviate the suffering of individuals."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"HEALTHAstrology was of central importance in early modern medicine. It was used as a diagnostic tool byclergymen, licensed physicians and the myriad “irregulars” who also practiced physic.[270]Astrological medicine concerned itself with understanding the nature of illness by studying howparticular influences of the stars affected the patient. The most common astrological diagnostictechniques were either horary figures based on the time of consultation between patient andpractitioner, or a decumbiture.[271] Whichever technique was utilised, an up-to-date astrologicalmap was essential, as the occult influences that astrological medicine analysed were considered to bein constant flux.[272] Astrologer-physicians such as Forman and Napier opted for casting by the timeof consultation.[273] It was easier for the practitioner to note the time of consultation themselvesbecause, as one contemporary noted, when it came it to the exact ‘time of decumbiture... few knowthat’.[274] Astrological knowledge produced diagnoses from measurements determined by the time ofastrological intervention. The horary ‘ritual of interrogation’[275] was a prime example of divinatoryanalysis, which took data (stars’ positions at the time of consultation or illness) and ran it through asystemised set of correspondences to discern information about the current composition of occultinfluences. Links between magic and astrology were also exemplified in the diagnostic use ofgeomancy, a divination system heavily based upon astrological symbolism.[276] Simon Forman isnoted to have ‘calculated an astrological, or on occasion a geomantical, figure for the time at whichhe was consulted and read this for the cause of the disease or to foresee its outcome.’[277]These medical charts of decipherable astrological symbolism were the early modern equivalents ofblood tests and other modern diagnostic technologies.[278] Typically, a figure could be analysed inseveral ways: ‘the sixth House, and his Lord [planet], signifies the sickness: the seventh the Physitian:the eighth Death : the tenth Medicine: the fourth the end of the Disease’.[279] A planet’s positioncould be examined to yield information about the problem – ‘Mars in Leo afflicts the heart, thedisease is a feaver, and the cause of it choler.’[280] Lilly‘s Christian Astrology handbook alsoteaches how to analyse nativities for inherent susceptibility to certain conditions or illnesses.[281]This nativity analysis further highlights the ways astrology explored the links between one’s situationand one’s self.Astrological figures provided essential information to be interpreted to pronounce both a diagnosisand prognosis of the sickness. Comparison with advanced modern medical technology is particularlyappropriate when we understand that the main alternative diagnostic tool during the early modernperiod was uroscopy.[282] Astrology, in contrast, was a highly systemised practice with detailedoperational parameters and a vast array of semiotic characterisations and models it could utilise. Itsimply provided more data that could be symbolically interpreted to produce useful information thanthe study of a patient’s water. Napier supported astrology over uroscopy on practical experientialgrounds, claiming that, ‘where his figure deceived him once, the urine did it ten times... And for thatthe Urine would not shew many things that the figure would’.[283]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"When considering medical astrology we should also bear in mind the expectations of patients of theearly modern period. It has been observed:‘seventeenth-century men and women were well aware of the feeble curative powers ofcontemporary medicine. What they expected above all from their doctors was that they distinguishfatal illnesses from harmless or transient maladies.’[284]Forman’s clients sometimes merely wanted him to pronounce whether their child would live or die,without apparently asking him to take any action to attempt to ensure the occurrence of the formerrather than the latter: ‘they simply wanted a prognosis.’[285] A figure of the heavens describing theunderlying natural forces that had led to one’s sickness would ‘situate the patient in the cosmos,placing him at the vortex of the natural forces that impelled the universe, discovering thecorrespondences that linked microcosm and macrocosm.’[286] The medical astrologer was in aposition to reconcile individual sickness, infirmity or bereavement with the larger cosmologicalpicture, in a similar manner to the clergy. Yet they could also present the exact celestial mechanicsthat had created this sad state of affairs, and so held out a more comprehensible explanation than mereemphasis upon, say, God’s mysterious nature. The role played by early modern astrological medicalpractitioners was as much that of a counsellor as it was a doctor of biology and medicine. The addedimportance of constructing a social meaning of disease and disorder should be appreciated in thislight.The medical figure of the heavens provided an initial case history for patients who suffered relapses.Forman encouraged other practitioners to ‘look back to the first figure ever cast for the patient and tosee if the signifiers (important astrological markers) of the cause of the disease had altered since thepatient’s first visit.’[287] The wealth of information that horary, nativity and decumbiture figures heldwas recorded for study of both current and similar future cases.[288] Beyond the immediate utility ofa figure for diagnosis and treatment of the individual patient, such a record of the course of theinfirmity added to the practitioner’s stockpile of medical information to help better diagnose and treatfuture patients. Such records were in studious circulation between astrological medical practitioners.In a letter from astrologer-physician Arthur Dee (1579-1651) to Richard Napier, Dee discusses acollegial consultation he made with Napier concerning ‘an fuisset gravida’ (whether a client waspregnant) and informs Napier ‘we were both deceived, for it proved not so.’ However, more thaninforming a consulting colleague of the conclusion of the case, Dee goes on to explain he hasobserved a particular trend that may be useful in future cases – Dee also included ‘the figures toconsider of it’, and concluded his report by asking Napier ‘to send me some receipts of worth foundby your own practice.’[289] We can observe here that the detailed analysis of such figures extendedbeyond diagnosis of an individual case into a wider inquiry into the refining and improvement of thepractice of astrological medicine itself. Astrological knowledge about a particular incident was usedto understand the whole system, and to better understand and manipulate future occurrences.Once an astrological medical diagnosis had been made, a cure could be prescribed through planetarygovernorships: ‘you may strengthen the part of the bodie by its like, as the brain by Herbs ofMercury’ and, in addition, ‘you may oppose diseases by Herbs of the Planet opposite to the Planet"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"that causeth them, as... diseases of Mars by Herbs of Venus, and the contrarie’.[290] The ‘occultvertues’ afforded to natural resources by astrological governances could be applied to rebalance apatient’s locus of astrological influences. By knowing the astrological signifier of either the diseaseor the part of the body affected, one could automatically construct a treatment to counteract thisinfluence, simply by understanding the sympathies and antipathies of the planets. Astrologicalunderstanding of flora and fauna also allowed astrological medical practitioners to have easy accessto a form of natural talismanic magic – whereby the planetary influence of herbs could be used toaffect patients needing equilibrium to be re-established. Astrologer-physician Joseph Blagrave(1610-c. 1682) utilised the talismanic nature of some herbal remedies, prescribing his ‘patients towear a select number of... herbs’ gathered at astrologically appropriate times.[291] These werepractical benefits of the astrological exploration of the essential natural magical identity andproperties of the environment. It was a living system employing a unifying universal scope of meaningto select natural resources to steer the course of a sickness towards recovery – that is, to affectpractical results through application of knowledge, understanding and informed action.Artificial talismans such as astrological sigils, seals and images were also used in medical treatment.Talismans could draw forth elemental forces to return equilibrium to imbalanced humours. Preciselybecause elemental Fire and Water are considered to have opposite qualities (hot-and-dry and cold-and-moist respectively), Agrippa describes how images of ‘Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, because theydo constitute the watery... triplicity, do prevail against hot and dry fevers’.[292] The scope ofpotential talismanic treatments was not limited to humoural readjustment – planetary and zodiacalsymbolism was also utilised. The seal of Scorpio, made “correctly”,[293] exercised dominion overscorpions and, by extension, all venomous things – it was therefore ‘a most excellent Remedy againstall Poyson and Diseases thereby infected.’[294] Astrological amulets were also prescribed to thosesuffering from a variety of mental and emotional disturbances.[295]Even treatments not themselves especially astrological were carefully timed by election. Indeed,‘virtually all physicians of the period employed astrology in their practice to determine appropriatedays for bloodletting and purging and to set a schedule for administering medications.’[296] In a‘small Treatise’ detailing a cure for smallpox which does not appear to have any explicit astrologicaldimension, the author adds an (expressly astrological) appendix on the basis that, after this work hadbeen submitted ‘in order to be Printed; it came into my Mind that I had given directions to Vomit suchPersons as should be infected with the Small Pox... but had given no Instruction to the ignorantTenders how to govern the Patient during the time that it is Working’ and that ‘therefore I will firstshew (to such as have a little insight into Astrology) how to Elect a proper time for theAdministration of the Medicine’.[297] So established was such a practice, even in 1685, that theauthor Lamport[298] added a whole appendix dedicated to including this vital astrological feature oftreatment. Such was the perceived power of the natural magic of an astrological universe – bad timingmight literally kill you. This kind of medical election presented the treatment in a universal context,and made both practitioner and patient uniquely aware of the environmental factors influencing theiractivity. Not only the disease and diagnosis, but the cure itself, became part of an unfolding destiny,interconnected through applied analysis of specific points in time and empowered by the influences ofthe stars. Using election, ‘the medical astrologer could thus manipulate the forces of nature to heal his"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"patients.’[299]"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MIND, BODY AND SOULAmongst the complaints, maladies and diseases treated by astrological medical practitioners were awhole subset of disorders affecting the patient’s mind as well as body. Consideration of seventeenth-century attitudes to ‘impairment of a principal internal mental faculty’[300] requires a carefulapproach. Comparisons between modern ideas of mind, body and their early modern considerationsare, to say the least, problematic – ‘early modern Europeans deployed a nosology that, over time, hasbecame largely alien.’[301] Nevertheless, “psychiatry” is not in itself an anachronistic label for earlymodern treatment of madness.[302] There is compelling evidence that ‘clergymen, astrologers, andmagicians of all kinds treated mental disorders.’[303] Mental disorders were often explained, likephysical maladies, by reference to the waxing and waning of astrological influence upon the victim’shumoural temperament. However, we must remember that, within early modern psychiatry, ‘theprevailing system of Galenic medicine still subordinated the body to the soul and medical authorsusually passed decorously over the problematic mind-body relationship’,[304] precisely because, forcontemporaries, mind and body were two expressions of a complex of underlying interrelationswhich included religious notions of the soul, free will and sin as much as ideas that might beconsidered analogous to modern epistemological categorisations of biology and psychology.Astrology could also locate mental disorders in its (characteristically) total categorisation of humanmaladies. Mental and physical problems were described in a common astrological language, andwere linked to the wider environment and motions of the universe. Just as physical complaints couldbe remedied by knowing the astrological sympathies and antipathies that would address theimbalance causing the illness, so too could diseases of the mind. The astrologer-physician RichardNapier’s most (in)famous mental health case was the treatment of Viscount Purbeck, John Villiers(1591?-1658). Driven to apparent breakdown by the power-plays between his and his wife’s ruthlessaristocratic families, MacDonald assesses: ‘Purbeck was almost certainly a manic depressive andalcoholic, and Napier treated his wild oscillations between ‘merry madness’ and deep melancholiawith medicaments, management and amulets from 1622 to 1626 and then again in 1631-32.’[305]Seventeenth-century astrology accepted an interlinked relation between mind and body, and becauseeach could affect the other, a doctor would need to be sure he was treating the cause of the illnessrather than merely a symptom. One of the first tasks of the astrologer-physician therefore was todetermine whether the disease ‘be in the minde, or in the body.’ Culpeper offered astrological‘Aphorisms’ for determining this (‘the Sun, Moon and Ascendent rule the body, and their Lords theminde’) followed by more detailed consideration – ‘If Jupiter be significator of the disease, it lies inthe body, if it lies anywhere; for Jupiter never troubles the mind’.[306]Precisely because early modern forms of psychiatry frequently interwove their understandings ofmind, body and soul, astrology shared common ground with religious as well as occult discourses intreating infirmities of the mind. This can be observed most readily in the idea that ‘sin corrupted the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"bodily humors physically.’[307] Transgression endangered the mind and body as well as the soul.Along with the corruption resulting from spiritual transgression, it was more widely understood thatdamage to, or degradation of, the physical body could itself impair mental faculties. This can be seenmost obviously in early modern humoural understandings of the brain. In a compilation of medicaltreatises listed as ‘being chiefly a Translation of the works’ of French physician, Lazarus Riviere, weare told ‘the greatest number of Diseases of the Head come from a Cold and Moist Distemper of theBrain’, precisely because ‘the Brain is that Mother of Moisture or Flegm, and Coldness long abidingdraws moisture to itself.’[308] This kind of early modern assessment, and the resultant treatments tore-balance humours, should look fairly familiar to us by now.As we have seen, seventeenth-century humours were still constructed from elementist premises,possessing elemental qualities that could be brought into balance using a variety of magical-medicalmeans; many of which were, naturally, astrological. These could be applied to heal the unbalancedmind just as effectively as the dyscratic body. The cures offered for excess phlegm in the head werethe same as other humoural treatments: ‘Diet, Chirurgery and Physick’, that is, (often expresslyhumoural) regulations of nutritive intake and procedures of bloodletting and purging supported bysyrups, electuaries and other medicaments.[309] In addition to these, the types of treatments for theadjustment and regulation of humours we have already seen could be employed.In addition to humoural and elementist comprehension of the brain, expressly astrological nosology –particularly the practice of melothesia (attributing parts of the body to the rulership of zodiacal signs)– was common in early modern neuroscience. Culpeper’s Semeiotica Uranica offers us a typicalearly modern perspective on the sheer range of mental and physical brain (or, more commonly, simply‘head’) maladies:‘Under Aries are... all diseases in the Head, as the Head-ach of all sorts, Vertigo, Frenzy, Lethargy,Forgetfulness, Catalepsie, Apoplexy, dead-Palsy, Coma, Falling-sickness, Convulsions, Cramps,Madness, Melancholy, Trembling.’[310]We find here a whole range of cognitive, behavioural and pathological dysfunctions.This association with Aries was by no means the only judgement on brain disease. According toAgrippa, citing such attributions to ‘the doctrine of the Arabians’, both the Sun and the Moon ruled thebrain, while Mercury was associated with ‘common sense’. [311] These planetary and zodiacalforces could be harnessed using the methods already explored to treat a variety of kinds ofimpairment of neurological and psychological functions.Early modern psychiatry also included astrologically-based humoural components to the experienceand expression of what we modern thinkers might call emotional distress.[312] An imbalance of anyof the humours would encourage perturbations that would make the subject’s body and mind moresusceptible to affect. This was the most basic early modern understanding of passions: they wereaffections because they were what affect us, they were perturbations treated as accidents that befall us– they were passions understood as what moves us. Some thinkers considered there to be inherently"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"dangerous qualities in any impassioned or emotional state. So it is that theologian, poet and historianNicolas Coeffeteau (1574-1623) presents the claim that ‘as we call passions of the body diseases,wounds, paines, inflammations, incisions, and all other violent accidents which happenextraordinarily: so wee properly call passions of the soule, those infirmities wherewith she isafflicted and troubled...’ [313] This kind of attitude culminated in the notion of psychomachia, thewar for the soul in each of us between pious Christian rationality and base animalistic passions.The pathologisation and demonization of the passions were not the only early modern comprehensionsof emotionality. Other thinkers, in the tradition of the ancient philosophers Cicero, Plutarch andothers, emphasised the passions as useful tools for ensuring proper moral conduct. Even the priestThomas Wright (c.1561-1623), who on the whole advocated a fairly “pro-psychomachia” position,declared that ‘Passions are not onely, not wholy to be extinguished (as the Stoicks seemed to affirme)but sometimes to be moved, and stirred vp for the service of virtue...’[314] For example,‘shamefastnesse brideleth vs of many loose affections, which would otherwise bee rangingabroad.’[315] Rather than advocating a total repression of all impassioned states in favour of somekind of unadulterated rationality, one passion could be used to regulate – or, as in the example ofshame, restrain – another.[316]To return to a theological angle, the passions were thought to originate in the sensitive faculties of theAristotelian tripartite soul – the part shared with animals – and were considered in essence themovement of the soul towards stimuli it deemed good, beneficial or pleasurable and away from thoseperceived as bad, detrimental or painful. As such, they were ordained by God as part of our immortalsouls: their actions and malfunctions fell as much under the purview of the priest as the physician.Beyond emotional pathology, the vast, intricate breadth and wealth of passionate human experiencewas comprehended with humoural elementist understandings. Anger was considered a Fiery cholericpassion; lust and joy were both Airy sanguine affections; grief, a condition associated particularlywith the Watery phlegmatic temper; sorrow, a product of the Earthy black bile, melancholy. This lastexample is probably the clearest of a humour and an impassioned state sharing terminology, althoughthere are also plenty of instances of ‘Choler’ referring both to humour and passion.[317] Exposure (amagical principle in itself) to Fiery things could encourage one to experience and express ‘boldness’,anger or any of the other Fiery passions.The interaction of humours and passions was two-way. This interrelation was described by Wright inhis popular Passions of the Minde in Generall, judging that ‘Passions ingender Humors, and Humorsbreed Passions’.[318] So the heavens could affect our quality of experience and methods ofexpression, and our very physical and mental functioning, while habit and habituation of personality,behaviour, even diet, would encourage the cultivation of the humours – the bodily reflections of thecosmic building blocks of the elementist universe – that would continue these physiological-emotional feedback loops.The interrelations between religiosity and the occult forces underpinning the universe were also by nomeans a “one-way system”, and the multiplicity of Christian magical practices attest to this. Richard"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Napier was not only an astrologer-physician of considerable renown, but also a clergyman, who, inaddition, practiced angelic magic – for expressly medical purposes. In 1619 he conjured theArchangel Raphael for a medical consult to help diagnose clients. A transcript of the conversationbetween doctor and angel revealed ‘Raphael’s opinion that five of Napier’s patients were bewitchedand predictions that two of them would recover.’[319] The biographer John Aubrey (1626-1697) andLilly both attested that such conjurations were common, even the norm, in Napier’s practice –furthermore, they considered this to be testament not of his magical prowess conflicting with hisreligious position, but of Napier’s great piety.[320]As Don C. Skemer has pointed out, there was a medieval practice in which ‘amuletic texts could alsobe inscribed on small metal sheets (lamellae or laminae) for medical use on the body...’[321] Notonly did this continue into the early modern period, but these lamen could also be used for rectifyingimpairments of mental faculties. The ‘amuletic texts’ were frequently Biblical passages. The recitingof Biblical passages and Christian prayers were often treatments in themselves,[322] as well as beinga frequent part of the administering of healing amulets.[323] Such administrations would frequentlyuse astrological timing. In Sloane MS 3851, the grimoire of London cunning-man Arthur Gauntlet,there are instructions for engraving magical symbols onto a cooking pot in which to wash ‘weakenedthings’: the engraving was to be done in the hour of the Sun and Psalm 7:2 was to be read over thewater seven times.[324] Significantly, these instructions are contained in a section of the grimoireentitled ‘Magnus Medicus est Naturae Minister’ (‘The Great Doctor is the Servant of Nature’): editorDavid Rankine notes that the “great doctor” was a common way to refer to Christ himself as aphysician.[325]We see in such Psalm charms various rituals of medication, often designed to be self-administered.Such charms therefore extended the act of treating ailments out of the consultation room of cunning-folk and into the everyday lives of their patient-clients. As employed in construction and consecrationof magical objects such as these medical tools, they were a magical means to activate, as well asrecharge, one’s medicine with intent and language recognisable as pious and effective. Indeed, inconsidering the relations between magic and Christianity we should bear in mind the claim of WalterRaleigh (1554-1618), that ‘the art of magic is the art of worshipping God’.[326] Magic and religionwere especially co-mingled in the practice of astrology, and most overtly in the practices ofastrologers such as Dee, Napier, Forman and even Lilly.[327]By astrological assessment, the mind, like any other phenomenon of the universe, existed in a contextof forces that influenced all life, time and events. Understandably then, ‘the astrologer and his clientswere seldom content to list a single factor as the sole cause of a case of mental disorder.’[328]Astrology was used to analyse and understand an illness – whether of the body or mind – not merelyto find causes. Astrologers used their figures as warning systems for times when the stars mightpredispose the humoural temperaments of their clients to certain mental afflictions, not tocategorically blame one particular astrological configuration. Astrology outlined all kinds ofphenomena as contributing to impairment of mental faculties. Indeed, ‘most people in earlyseventeenth-century England saw no theoretical incompatibility among the different kinds ofexplanation for mental disorders, and many practitioners combined therapies justified by medical,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"magical, and religious beliefs’.[329]Such therapies took full advantage of the manipulation of influences facilitated by astrologicalunderstanding. The patient’s mind would “soak up” what it was exposed to, so the correctmanagement of environmental stimulus could be vital for recovery. The doctrine of the “six non-natural things” – ‘diet, retention and evacuation, air [crucially, sometimes referred to as ‘the heavens’i.e. the stars], exercise, sleeping and waking, and the passions’ was utilised to properly affect thismanagement of the humours.[330] This management of environmental stimuli could be relativelymundane – ‘Forman sometimes prescribed a change in diet or behaviour (regimen) rather than anyspecific medical intervention’, such as the standard purges and blood-letting most common in earlymodern medical treatments.[331] He would often judge that patients suffering from melancholy ‘musthaue comfortable things and be merry and give her sweete & comfortable meat.’[332] This was notmerely comfort-eating for the depressed. The inherent occult properties of these foods and activitieswould have an effect on the patient’s humours – their magical physiology. Such ‘comfortable things’were astrologically justified treatments with rational reasoning derived from magical premises ofhumoural theory, contagion and exposure.Astrological interrelation meant all things transmitted an effect as well as receiving one. A diseasedmind, and in particular a diseased ‘Imagination’, not only absorbed but transmitted an influence thatwould affect a change in humours and exert a negative influence on the bodies and minds of peoplearound them.[333] What might nowadays be explained as the “power of suggestion” was understoodas effects of an underlying link between knowledge and the physical body. The physician John Cotta(c. 1575-1627/8), a staunch critic of astrology, popularised the cases of two female patients who,following being misdiagnosed, promptly developed the very diseases they had been told they hadalready contracted.[334] Richard Napier noted the case of Joan Neighbor, who became melancholicafter merely hearing about a suicide.[335] Knowledge itself could cause mental and physical ailmentsby interacting with an individual’s consciousness. Thus early modern psychology writer RobertBurton (1577-1640) describes the ‘Imagination’ as ‘the medium deferens of passions’ whichthemselves acted upon one’s character as one’s ‘humours disposed’.[336] Astrology was an essentialtool in discerning the influences that an unwary person’s imagination could catch and be manipulatedby. Moreover, it could prescribe treatments for these plagued individuals.Lilly writes of an astrological sigil made for his master Gilbert Wright (d. 1627) by Simon Forman toprevent Wright being haunted by the spirit of a man who had killed himself in a room in which Wrighthad stayed. This spirit was now provoking Wright himself to suicide.[337] This presents us with aslightly different early modern modelling of the apparently contagious nature of mental disorders; onewhere Wright’s suicidal tendencies were still picked up by geographical proximity but nowanthropomorphised into the form of a malevolent ghostly tempter, or ‘revenant’.[338] Such adiagnosis of malevolent spiritual agency was remarkable but far from unusual.[339] Wrightapparently wore his protective sigil ‘continually until he died,’ and, thankfully, ‘was never moremolested by the spirit’.[340] We might see in Wright’s sigil of protection from spirits an astrological-magical anxiolytic treatment. It has been calculated that out of all Richard Napier’s consultationswhich included mention of amulets, 20.3% were for those ‘tempted to suicide’.[341] Forman also"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"dealt with cases of haunted melancholic people tempted to self-harm and suicide by evil spirits – hemanaged to help one Susan Cuckston ‘to handle pins and knives without inflicting self-harm’ using apurge treatment.[342]We can feasibly conjecture about early modern conceptions of positive effects of astrological amuletsbased upon an early modern conception of the power of suggestion, particularly when we take intoaccount that during this period it had been ‘asserted that people who were terrified by the plaguewere more vulnerable to the disease.’[343] Similarly, Forman discusses how poor mental healthcould impair the body’s ability to fight off disease: a disrupted mind would influence the body to‘languish long in a small disease’.[344] Robert Burton highlights how humoural theory (whichastrology incorporated as part of its universal system of meaning) could be itself a way to understandthe laws of magic. Magical and astrological medicine ‘doth more strange cures th[a]n [those of a]rationall Physition... because the patient puts his confidence in him... Tis opinion alone, saith Cardan,that makes or marres Physitions’.[345] It is in this context we should understand Forman’s insistenceupon earning the trust of his patients. Astrology could make the most accurate medical diagnoses,‘thereby winning the confidence of the patient’[346] and therefore ensuring that the treatment wouldbe well received by the patient’s body and mind. The activity of proscribing was itself bolstered bythe authority that astrological knowledge bestowed upon the medical practitioner. Forman noted that‘the verie presence of the physician aswel as the medison shall be verie comfortable to the sick andthe sick shall rejoice in and have in great regard the phisisione and he shall doe the sicke moregood.’[347] Astrological practice was not merely a matter of knowing what was wrong, or even howto remedy it – it was a conscientious administering activity that required the astrologer to enter into arelationship with their clients and earn their trust.Individual instances of psychological problems were astrologically considered as part of the wideruniverse, and considered in the same language. Just as astrology reconciled the apparent difference ofcelestial and terrestrial phenomena into a cohesive spectrum of reflecting scales so the mental and thephysical were considered within a unifying analytical framework. Astrology mapped the multiplicityof environmental factors for imbalance and impairment of mental faculties. Astrologers analysedindividuals and offered treatment for mental disorders within a context of influences that combinedphysiology, religion and magic. Astrological utility and elaboration of humoural theory explored themicrocosm of a patient’s mind using the macrocosm of the stars. Environmental influences weremanaged to create a healing regimen, but the field-like nature of ‘Imagination’ meant it also interactedwith the world as it was influenced. The idea of a diseased mind being somehow contagiousdemonstrates the crucial principle that knowledge has a tangible and magical effect on the knower.Existing in this magical universe meant both affecting and being affected by it, and understandingitself could alter and manipulate this two-way process of effect."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"PERSONAL CONSULTANCYThe final forms of personal astrology to be discussed are the varied and various non-medicalpersonal consultations that practitioners of astrology gave. Local practitioners were also often askedto help bring something about – to bless or otherwise enchant or protect. Astrology offeredknowledge and practice of a ‘rich variety of magical... practices to deal with everyday frustrations,longings and dilemmas’.[348]Much of an astrological practitioner’s workload came in the form of providing information andunderstanding. The most common question put to an astrological practitioner was ‘quid agendum’:‘what’s to be done’.[349] Astrology’s universal comprehensiveness allowed it to answer questionsconcerning anything. Offered the chance to know about anything, most early modern people wereinterested in their relationships. Love consults were not limited to forecasts of spouse material,though these were common.[350] They included relationship advice and marriage counselling. Thiscould even extend to magical action – cunning-folk sometimes offered to make ‘ill husbands to begood to their wifes’.[351] Astrology considered the love-lives and kinships of individuals as part ofthe overall pattern of the universe. Likewise, complicated family matters could be consoled andexplained, indeed ‘every kind of domestic entanglement was ventilated in the astrologer’s consulting-room.’[352] In particular, astrology provided the paternity tests of its day for uncertain men andwomen, demonstrating a performativity of astrological announcements about personal identity.[353]In an era of aristocratic bloodlines, astrological knowledge about your parentage could literallychange your life.Astrological practitioners generated spontaneous information through knowledge-at-a-distancedivination. Horary techniques, the ‘openly divinatory kind of astrology’,[354] proved essential forthis practice. Ritualisation of consultation provided a time-point focus to astrologically locate andanalyse profundity. The extent to which local horary activity was ritualised can be seen in the case ofJohn Vaux, a curate, astrologer and cunning-man, who would often draw up his astrological figuresand calculations on the communion altar – doubtlessly with the purpose of ensuring that casting andinterpretation were guided by God.[355] Piety was an indication of a great astrologer and magicianas well as a priest.The other main area of astrological divination was detection magic. Astrology offered advice fortreasure-seeking[356] and was also ‘one of the most common techniques employed for finding lostproperty’.[357] This could also include stolen property – in a letter dated 28th July 1650 astrologerVincent Wing (1619-1668) asked Lilly to help interpret a figure to find stolen linen for an MP’s wife.[358] Similarly, detection magic could be used to find people, as evidenced by Booker’s note to Lillyasking him to locate Booker’s absconded son Samuel.[359] As with horary work, ritual wasimportant, perhaps even essential, in detection magic. One magical practitioner in 1631 claimed ‘anyman going about to find out stolen goods doth it with great difficulty, with fasting and praying three"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"days together and great pains taken therein.’[360] Like the worried parents of sick children whoseemed to want only a prognosis, some merely wished to know if they would ever get theirbelongings back. However, astrological practitioners also used their knowledge to influence thereturn of stolen goods.[361] Astrology offered both closure and an avenue of hope for the practitionerand client to explore together.Since astrology could find both people and stolen goods, it could also locate and identify thieves.Many practitioners offered to magically compel the thief to return the property. There were manydifferent techniques of anti-thief magic – as well as horary figures to identify offenders, ‘writtencharms were also used to afflict thieves and thereby force them into returning goods, and spirits couldalso be conjured up to do likewise.’[362] There are examples of astrological images that could becast to find criminals or ward off thieves, such as the image of the third face of Cancer and that of theseventeenth mansion of the Moon.[363] The fear of magical reprisal itself was also hoped to induceenough of an effect to achieve a speedy recovery.[364] The social justice implications of this areworth considering – ‘astrology could be a useful deterrent’[365] in any number of areas. In fact forevery field of divination, astrology provided the techniques, understanding and agency to affect thesubject of the divination, whether by specific timing, identifying unknown parties or by usingastrological knowledge to affect magical results.A hand-written home protection prayer-charm from the end of seventeenth-century to ‘bequeath thysplace all about and all my goods within and without to the Blessed trinity that one god... [to allow] nothee[v]es feet goe’ concludes with charging the planets and the twelve signs to keep the house safe,each astrological glyph written in their magical sequences.[366] The totality of the planetary andzodiacal governances could be employed to protect against every eventuality. A manageableastrological taxonomy of the complete mechanics of the universe allowed one to invoke and chargethese forces with tasks and functions. This was the function of symbolising cosmic forces with glyphs– the extensive corresponding powers, responsibilities and influences of the planets and signs couldbe symbolised in their summarising glyphs. Hence ‘there was also considerable use of overtlymagical words and phrases, spirit names, occult symbols, planetary signs, and astrological terms’ inthe various magical charms offered by astrological practitioners.[367]Astrological symbolism played an important interpretive role in other forms of magic – most of whichwere practiced by astrologers. Geomantic divination, despite its late arrival into English vernacular,was very popular with magical practitioners.[368] Forman, Napier and the occultist Robert Fludd(bap. 1574, d. 1637) even ‘formed a sort of succession especially in astrological and geomanticstudies.’[369] Likewise, Davies judges that village cunning-folk who practised astrology ‘wouldcertainly appreciate the detailed practical guide to astromantic and geomantic divination, and thediagrams showing the various signs and characters of the planets and their angels’ in John Heydon’sTheomagia.[370] Astrological symbolism underlay geomancy – Cattan stated that geomancy ‘dothparticipate with Astrologie, and is called her daughter.’[371] The sixteen “answers” or charactersthat made up the geomantic system had expressly astrological correspondences – the figure Carcer(Prison) for example, with a divinatory meaning of ‘ill in all things’, is attributed by Cattan to darkScorpio.[372] Each of the sixteen figures had an astrological identity, although the specific"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"attributions of the figures to the zodiacal signs varied slightly from handbook to handbook.[373]However, astrological symbolism also worked at a more fundamental level in the geomanticdivination process. A full geomantic cast would consist of generating twelve initial figures followedby three final figures which would be interpreted to provide a general answer to the inquiry.[374]The initial twelve were assigned in their order of appearance to the astrological diagram thatrepresented the twelve houses of the heavens, in order to locate information more directly related tothe question at hand.[375] This was a use of an astrological taxonomy (the house system and itstwelve-part categorisation of human life), not to astronomically map celestial bodies, but to plotrandomly generated figures into a magical sequence to derive particular significances for divininganswers. The position of a geomantic figure in a particular house described the area of life that thisfigure affected, and the zodiac attributes of the figures were used to further interpret the figure’ssignificance. Astrological symbolism aided the practice of geomancy by providing additionalsymbolic correspondences, links and interpretations: ‘as far as geomancy is concerned, astrology isan interpretive system.’[376] Astrological knowledge added a powerful advantage to the user ofgeomantic magic. John Heydon even declared ‘That No Divination without Astromancy andGeomancy is perfect.’[377]Astrological practitioners were not merely occult polymaths interested in various disconnectedmagical practices. Astrological structure, symbolism, theory and practice all contributed to, and evenunderlay, a deeper understanding, and therefore use of, other magical systems. This cross-pollinationof astrology and other magic systems has been described as a ‘blurring of different magical beliefs...characteristic of the period.’[378] I agree that these beliefs and systems co-mingled in a particularlystriking way in the seventeenth century, but would certainly consider this magical syncretisation ofapparently discrete beliefs and practices to be more than mere ‘blurring’. Astrological practitionerscombined their magical studies into wider cohesive universal systems, to explore occult influence inevery aspect of existence. Forman expresses how astrology was the foundation of all study –‘for astrologie is the booke and course of all naturalle things, the grounds of physicke and mother ofall artes what so ever. And without that thou canst doe nothing in phisicke nor magick.’[379]The glaring overlaps in the theories and practices of astrologers, cunning-folk who used astrology,and ceremonial magicians, make distinguishing between these roles difficult. However this difficultydoes not arise from interrelations of magical systems being hazily or indistinctly lumped together, butrather from the organic manner in which they associated and supported the practices of each other.The sheer utility of combining symbolism of different magical activities, reconciling supportivetheories, principles and techniques into a complete practice, allowed magical practitioners of allkinds to better understand and therefore act in the magical universe. Astrology was a magical systemof knowledge and activity that fed into and expanded the correspondences and interrelations of othermagical systems and their interactions with this magical universe. It is for this reason that, when itcame to astrologers and astrological practitioners, ‘in practice many of these were indistinguishablefrom the village wizards.’[380]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"SOCIAL CONCLUSIONSAstrology was a vital interpretive craft for analysis of magic itself as well as for the large-scalemovements of the universe, political developments and individuals and their groupings. Its symbolismfundamentally contributed to the theoretical knowledge and practical activity of other magicalsystems. Astrological practitioners dealt in all sorts of magic. Geomancy is a significant example, asthis practice was not based upon an empirical map of celestial influence at a particular point in time(as in horary work), but on an arbitrary sequencing of stylised but randomly-generated data. Itspractice required a belief in an underlying life or intellect to the universe itself that wouldcommunicate through certain “random” (or rather, magical) acts – say, by ensuring mathematicallygenerated geomantic figures did indeed answer a question. This organic universe is an expresslymagical model. One of the most ardent proponents of geomancy was Fludd, who ‘saw the universeanimated by a living soul and ruled by spiritual essences, angelic powers and a whole machinery ofplanetary intelligences.’[381] As has been observed, ‘in the post-Restoration world, seen through thewindow of contemporary astrology, a line was drawn – not between magic and reason, as is so oftenassumed, but through magic, dividing it into acceptable and unacceptable sorts.’[382] Includingprinciples such as contagion and sympathy, we find the foundations (and many practices) of astrologywere deeply magical. In the motions of the stars, the universe narrated its story, relating itself to itselfin an ongoing interrelation. It is this active engagement with a magical universe, of being part of theexpressions of cosmos, that made astrology a spiritual as well as practical craft. It united theindividual with existence, finding a role for one as an active participant in a magical universe. This isthe context of the manner in which seventeenth-century English astrology operated as a practicalChristian theology – as a parallel to the Church rather than competitor. Astrologers’ practices werecertainly different, but their roles as intermediaries, interpreters and even liminaries between thedivine and the everyday were not.The ritualised ceremonies of astrological consults, that provided both information and treatment,further facilitated the significances of interpretative astrological techniques. Technical readings ofpositions and relations of the stars were only one dimension of a consultation – astrologicaltechniques were supported by the setting in which the consult took place. Ritualisation of theconsulting process highlights the necessity of the authority and liminality of the astrologicalpractitioner as an interpreter of existence’s magical undercurrents. The practitioner united querent andquestion in their answers by being the intercessor between the two. It is in this context we shouldunderstand certain popular anxiety about Forman entering the names of his clients alongside thefigures he would cast for them.[383] This was not solely a fear of ‘diabolic overtones’ in thecontract-like nature of this practice. Names were not just signifiers; they were a powerful magicalhandle that contained an essence or attachment to what they signified. This was a basis of the use ofangelic names in conjuration, as well as the carving of planetary glyphs into talismans. An individualand their situation were unified and explored in a single magical act."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"This unification of individual and situation was focused around the point at which astrologicalknowledge informed the client. Held within the moment at which a question was asked was anencoded answer. Horary astrology decoded patterns and inertias within these particular moments.This understanding was itself a collaboration between astrological practitioner and querent, andencouraged further action in light of fuller awareness. The manner in which this expanded awarenesssupported action is demonstrated in the way astrology located medical consultation ‘in a fruitfulcontext for the patient by providing the symbolic, interpretive, therapeutic, and social dimensionsnecessary for the completion of a successful healing act.’[384] We have already seen that astrologicalpractitioners offered to magically affect the subjects they explained. This search for knowledge, andits expansion into the manipulation of effect, illustrates the implicit agency that astrology offered – toengineer and manage as well as explain favourable outcomes.Astrological knowledge and action themselves required management. We have seen how masssocietal phenomena were worked into cohesive social theory using astrologically-principledresearch. Likewise, personal services were improved by more accurate time- and note-keeping.Casenote review offered improvement and refinement of astrological diagnoses, to forecast, to offeradvice and to otherwise affect the situation. Finally, this management extended to the manifestation ofinterpretation – that is, the behaviour and conduct of the interpreter. Issues concerning placebos,suggestion, deterrents, trust and authority reflect how the act of interpreting knowledge had significanteffects – sometimes as much as the information or understanding itself.Seventeenth-century English astrology treated certain knowledge as having a somewhat magicalnature. A diseased and contagious imagination, and the influence upon this imagination by astrologicalconditions, could have tangible effect on the sanity and body of individuals and society in general.The very links between body and mind in early modern thinking reflect how knowledge could haveeffects through underlying magical principles. Even in divination, knowledge was encoded andhidden (“occult”) in the stars, yet was always available to be summoned. Astrological knowledgemade an intervention the instant it was called upon, which was based upon assessing the very point intime of that intervention. This assessment of astrology’s own place in constructing information wasbased upon an inherent principle – that the universe was “narrating itself” across a time-span ofordained interrelation. There was no random time to make a horary question, there was destiny in allaffairs, and knowledge itself was an active participant in this astrological story of fate. Byunderstanding astrological-magical sympathies and antipathies, the underlying natures and operationsof celestial forces, diagnosis was a treatment. By knowing the astrological identity of the problem,one could automatically relate it to its relevant antidotes, and prescribe a way to manipulate thedilemma. It is for these reasons that ‘astrology, though beginning as a system of explanation, thusended as one which held out the prospect of control.’[385] The essence of the malady or generalsituation was considered within the same framework of interrelations as the essence of its resolution.The astrological practitioner truly did offer ‘the prospect of that greater freedom which comes fromself-knowledge.’[386] This knowledge was unified with action in the grand interlinking andreflecting scales of astrology.Social astrology illustrates the most personally affecting connections of this grand unifying spectrum –"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"those between individual, group, society and environment. It placed the ailments of particular parts ofthe human body within the same context as analysis of the body politic, and traced both of these backto fundamental principles of celestial influence. The combination of astrology and humoural theoryalso identified and analysed influences we would nowadays consider of a biological as well aspsychological nature, likewise within the same fundamental framework. Such a combination reflectsthe interrelation of all existence, whether material or mental. Analysis of both mind and body wereconstructed from the same modelling assessments of a multiplicity of forces and contexts. Thismodelling assessment is the common unifying principle in all astrological activity. We can distinguishbetween different subject matters – the supposedly distinct “types” of astrology such as judicial,natural, etc. – but we must be aware that such categories are far from discrete. Such fields exist asoverlapping areas of focus on a unified spectrum.Astrology explored the magical identity of natural organisms through understanding their astrologicalproperties and governorships. This brought together not only people, plants, trees, animals and otherliving things, but also non-living things ruled by or otherwise responsive to celestial forces. Theseincluded minerals, metals and other inorganic materials,[387] as well as abstract concepts,institutions and all the features of experiential life. Astrology considered that the human body itself ‘ismade of the same materials that the whole Universe is made of... namely of a composition of contraryElements.’[388] All these things were considered to be containers of occult virtue – everything wascommunicating with and influencing everything else. Nothing and no-one was isolated. Humanrelation to the environment, to the universe in general and to the earth and our surroundings inparticular, was not one of builder to materials, or of artist to media, but of a creation-wide dance orplay of interrelation, in which the stars called the dance-steps as they moved. Environment was notsimply something we acted upon or that acted upon us – such an attitude would have separated “man-made” and “natural” causes. All was an expression of the common unifying effect of the stars. Thecelestial influence that impacted upon humanity could have dangerous, even fatal results, yet thiseffect was felt throughout nature – the impact upon humanity and individuals was merely oneexpression of an overall process of effect. Astrology not only constructed or unveiled the socialmeaning of a personal tragedy, or even a particular kind of tragedy – it placed all tragedy and victoryin a unifying context that explored the complete consequences that any phenomenon in aninterconnected magical universe would wreak. Astrology presented a model with an infinite numberof facets. It included social, psychological and psychiatric subroutines to analyse all other systems –it was an underlying magical system that represented a grand unified set of principles, mechanics andtechniques for understanding and interacting with (and as part of) an interrelated magical universe."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5CONCLUSIONSAstrology was certainly a magical discipline. Historians seeking to emphasise astrology’s rationalityhave sought to distance astrology from magic. Such an emphasis is useful in approaching astrology onits own terms – yet this emphasis upon rationality should never come at the price of divorcingastrology from its magical roots and its clear use within magical activity. Geomancy’s underlyingastrological foundations have been briefly dealt with by Skinner, although mainly as part of thepractices of the nineteenth-century occult revivalists, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Interms of seventeenth-century study, Kassell and MacDonald have considered the diverse magicalactivities of individuals, providing useful beginnings for study into how astrological symbolism wasutilised in general magical practices. Both Thomas and Capp note general usage of sigils andastrological magic, yet seem to consider it a peripheral activity to astrological divination. This bookinsists that the philosophy and utility of astrological images forms a central part of early modernastrology, and that this astrology informed a variety of other magical activities.The totality of astrology’s scope of analysis has been under-explored by historians. Thomascharacterises astrology as having a universal ‘comprehensiveness’, and draws vital conclusionsabout the functions of astrology’s universal breadth in ‘bringing with it attempts at a universal naturallaw.’[389] This book provides further examination of the dynamic interrelations that astrologyposited and explored within this comprehensive spectrum of meaning. Studies into the ‘Great Chainof Being’, a magical conception of a hierarchical universe, have looked at how existence is groupedand categorised into a chain of command but not at how the phenomena at each level actually relate toone another. Szőnyi has considered ways in which magicians have elevated themselves along thischain through exaltation, but has not considered how astrology could affect the world by directlymanipulating its magical nature. My analysis of astrology and magic supports these investigations bymore fully considering the astrological conception of the cosmos as an interrelation of surroundings,whether physical and immediate or celestial and abstract. My approach emphasises the universalityand interconnectedness of early modern astrological conceptions of the “natural world” within amagical universe.I have also placed the methods and manners by which astrological knowledge affected action at theforefront of the study of seventeenth-century astrology. Geneva, Rusche and Curry have addressed thepolitical effects of astrology – Rusche and Geneva in specific terms of propaganda and cryptography,with Curry considering the broader political dimensions of astrology’s role in early modernhegemony. MacDonald has begun discussion of knowledge’s transformative value in his focus onearly modern mental health, and Kassell has raised important issues of authority and trust in medicalpractice. However, this book emphasises ways in which astrological knowledge itself had"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"performative and transformative functions in all areas of life – personal, societal, political andphilosophical. Political and medical astrology offer us the clearest pictures of the importance ofastrological interpretation, but these are just two examples of astrological understanding being itselfknowledge-in-action."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"SPECULATIONThe study of astrology clearly has much to offer the history of magic. Applied broadly, study of earlymodern astrology can provide useful historical parallels for discussing the liminality of knowledgeand status, and especially the functions of astrological practitioners as intermediaries, intercessorsand interpreters. The religious dimensions of astrology, where the roles of astrologer and priestoverlapped, have much to say about the status and utility of being an intermediary within communitiesand cultures, particularly of bridging the divine and the earthly. Likewise, expressly magicalastrological practices provide many fascinating and useful examples of the functions of intercession,as well as of offering the means for direct action in a magical universe, endowing those withknowledge of and practice in astrological arts crucial roles within society. Study of astrology alsomakes essential contributions to the kind of epistemological approach being considered in Peek’sstudies of African divination systems[390] – in terms of assessing the analysis, interpretation and theconstruction of knowledge – as well as existentialist discussions of identity and responsibility."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"SUMMARYEarly modern astrology provides us with a rich social and cultural focus for studying the fusing ofmagic and astrology, of knowledge and action, and of humans and their environment. As we haveseen, astrology was based upon fundamentally magical premises and functioned in a variety of othermagical practices. Study of astrology provides myriad examples of the illuminating, inspiring, andaffecting nature of both illicit and orthodox forms of knowledge. It also presents early moderncomprehension of knowledge itself as performative and magical, as well as showing how methodsand models of understanding reflect or mimic the subjects being explored.Astrology demonstrates how human understanding situates itself in relation to what it considers byexploring a universal and interrelating ontology of experience. I have tried to show not only howastrology presumes the interrelationship between individuals, nature and the cosmos, but how the artitself, reflecting that set of relationships, is conceived by its practitioners and audience as a dynamic,interrelated set of functions, interpretative devices and affective rituals. Seventeenth-century Englishastrology functioned as an early modern grand unified theory, as an interpretive and intercessorysystem for understanding and acting in a magical universe by constructing both correspondences and(what were conceived as) precise, functional significances from all phenomena."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYPRIMARY SOURCEA collection of His Majesties gracious letters, speeches, messages and declarations since April1660 (London, 1660).Agrippa, H.C., Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy, translated by R.
