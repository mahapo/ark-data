It seemed clear to usthat ancient defixiones—curse tablets and binding spells inscribed nor-mally on thin metal sheets—offered a unique body of data. They arelargely unknown, as much to general readers as to scholars; unlike themuch more familiar spells written on papyrus and preserved in largecollections of recipes for use by professional magoi, defixiones survivedbecause they were actually put to use by individual clients; like ancientamulets on stone, they come to us largely unmediated by external filters;unlike ancient literary texts, they are devoid of the distortions intro-duced by factors such as education, social class or status, and literarygenres and traditions. Most of all, they are intensely personal and direct.Of course, we are not so naive as to believe that the defixiones wereuninfluenced by cultural forces: their language is highly formulaic, andclients were often limited by the recipes that the local magos had avail-able in his or her collection of recipes. One final advantage is thatdefixiones, for the most part, have been uncovered by modern archaeolo-gists precisely where they were deposited by the ancient clients or theiragents: in cemeteries, wells, or other appropriate sites.For several reasons, we made the decision not to include the texts intheir original languages. First, our intended audience includes notonly—not even especially—scholars of Mediterranean antiquity but abroader range of students and general readers. Second, it soon becameapparent that for many of these defixiones the published texts are notreliable. Indeed, in many cases, the tablets themselves are no longeravailable for inspection (for example, most of those published byWünsch in DTA).

Third, for those who wish or need to consult the textsin their primary languages, editions are readily available, along withmore recent catalogues and inventories (for example, SGD for Greektablets and Solin for the Latin ones). We have tried to provide exhaus-tive bibliographical references for each of the texts included in thiscollection; in addition, where individual words or phrases are crucial tointerpretation, we have provided them in transliteration.The principle of organization within each chapter is basically geo-graphical: we begin with ancient Greece (an arbitrary starting point) andcircle around the Mediterranean in clockwise fashion. The fact that wehave included a few objects from beyond the Mediterranean, such as thebowls from Mesopotamia, indicates that we have not felt tightly boundby any of our categories.A brief word about the treatment of foreign and especially Greeknames is in order. In the texts themselves, we have not Latinized theletters of personal names: Greek kappa remains k, upsilon is renderedas u (rather than the more traditional y), omega becomes 6, and so on.But in the introductions, annotations, and discussions, we have used theLatinized conventions, especially with common and familiar names.Thus a name will not uncommonly appear in two forms: Sôkratês (in thetext) and Socrates (in the discussion). Voces mysticae—those \"words\" or\"terms\" in a spell that do not represent ordinary language—we haverendered in upper-case letters. On some tablets it is difficult to decidewhere one of these voces ends and the next one begins. On others,separations are indicated by various scribal devices, for example, boxesdrawn around the vox, suprascript horizontal lines and colons. With anumber of tablets, we have attempted to format the translation so as toreflect the unusual ways in which the text was inscribed; we have alsoincluded a number of photographic reproductions that illustrate thesetechniques.One of the features that distinguishes this book from other collectionsof ancients texts and documents—a feature that derives from our broadconception of how the world of the ancient Mediterranean must bestudied and understood—is the extent to which its contents cross tradi-tionally impervious barriers of language and culture. Thus we includematerial written not just in Greek or Latin but also in Hebrew, Aramaic,Coptic, and Demotic. Jewish, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, British, andChristian tablets appear side by side, often employing the same formu-las, mysterious names, and drawings. On a geographical scale, our tab-lets range from Britain to North Africa, from Mesopotamia to Spain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Preface   viiBehind this mix lies a conscious intention on our part to undermine theconfidence with which cultural, geographical, and chronological labelsare applied to ancient texts and traditions, as if they represented clear,distinct, and nonoverlapping categories.This book has been a collective effort from start to finish.

Jordan describes these curious objects as \"inscribed pieces oflead, usually in the form of thin sheets, intended to bring supernaturalpower to bear against persons and animals.\"4 Other materials could alsobe used—ostraca or broken sherds of pottery,5 limestone,6 gemstones,7papyrus,8 wax9 and even ceramic bowls10—but lead, lead alloys, andother metals remained the primary media for expressing a desire toenlist supernatural aid in bringing other persons (and animals, in thecase of racehorses) under the control of the person who commissionedor personally inscribed the tablet. In fact, the vast majority of survivingtablets is made of lead or lead alloys.11The preference for lead over other metals presents a complicated andrevealing set of problems. First, analysis of the remarkable tablets fromthe spring of the goddess Sulis Minerva at Bath (England) has revealedthat only one-fifth of the tablets contained as much as two-thirds lead.12The rest consist of alloys of lead and tin, sometimes fused with copper.13Perhaps this alloy was peculiar to England, a by-product of local pewter3"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldindustries, but these results should raise doubts about earlier claims thatmost tablets were made of pure lead. Second, the preference for leadseems due largely to its low cost and ready availability, whether as a by-product of silver mining in Greece or of pewter industries in England.Also, recipes for defixiones recommend \"borrowing\" (stealing?) leadfrom water pipes, presumably in the public domain.14 Third, as Tomlinnotes, \"it was quite easy to make a tablet\" by pouring hot lead into amold and then rolling, hammering, or scraping the sheet to obtain asmooth surface.15 Thereafter the sheet could be cut into smaller pieces tomake individual tablets. Fourth, lead was a common medium, perhapsone of the very earliest, for writing of any kind, including private corre-spondence.16 Fifth, certain obvious features of lead (it was cold, heavy,and ordinary) came to be seen, at a later time, as particularly suitable forthe specific task of conveying curses and spells to the underworld. Atablet from the Athenian Agora pleads that \"just as these names arecold, so may the name of Alkidamos be cold\"17; others seek to renderone's personal enemies as heavy as the lead18; and several early Greektablets make use of what seems already to have become a formula: \"Justas this lead is cold and useless, so let them (my enemies) be cold anduseless.\"19 But these formulas do not appear on the earliest tablets andprobably represent a later stage of reflection.The Inscribed MessagesContrary to what one might expect, the process of inscribing metaltablets posed no great difficulty. The preferred instrument was a bronzestylus (PGM VII, lines 396ff.). In some cases, the letters are lightlyscratched on the surface, but in others they are more deeply incised,with a clear buildup of metal visible at the end of the stroke. Tomlinnotes that \"a practiced scribe could write on the soft metal surface aseasily as on wax.\"20 Of course, the real issue here is to know who actuallyinscribed the letters, a professional scribe or the private individual seek-ing to enact the spell. We may begin with three observations. First, therange of skill exhibited on tablets is quite broad, with large, awkwardletters on one extreme and fluent scripts on the other.21 Second, profes-sionals may have played a more important role in the Roman period(first to sixth centuries C.E.) than in classical and Hellenistic times, al-though Plato already indicates the presence of professionals in thefourth century B.C.E. who prepared katadesmoi for a fee.22 Third, in mostcultures the business of making spells has been an activity entrusted tospecialists."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction   5The tablets themselves suggest that it was not uncommon for individu-als to turn to professionals, whether magoi or scribes. The work ofprofessionals is evident in a tablet like DTA 55, whose hand is describedas a scriptura elegantissima reminiscent of public monuments,23 or in the\"skillful, elegant, fluent semicursive\" texts of the third century C.E.,excavated from wells in the Athenian Agora.24 The \"clerical\" characteris-tics of numerous tablets from the find at Bath suggest the presence ofscribes, even though no two tablets appear to be by the same hand.25Also, highly formulaic texts, which cannot have been invented on thespot, must have been copied from formularies of the sort preserved inPGM and similar recipe collections used by professionals. Finally, sev-eral large caches of tablets found in one place clearly reflect the work ofa local \"cottage\" industry. Common sense seems to point us towardTomlin's cautious conclusion that we should expect to find \"a mixture ofprofessional and amateur scribes,\"26 but on balance the scales wouldappear to favor professionals, at least in the Roman period, both forinscribing the tablets and for providing the formulas.Next we must ask what these scribes wrote on their tablets. In largepart, the translations that follow in this collection will answer that ques-tion, but some general observations may serve to create a sense of broadpatterns and of changes through time. The general rule is that the earli-est examples are also the simplest: most of the early tablets from Sicilyand Attica (fifth to fourth centuries B.C.E.) give only the name of thetarget, with no verb of binding and no mention of deities or spirits; somedo include both a verb (usually a form of katadein) and the name of adeity (in Attica usually Hermes or Persephone).27 Special forms of writ-ing include either scrambling the names of the targets28 or writing them,and sometimes the full text of the spell, backwards—that is, from left toright but with the individual letters facing in the proper direction. Suchtechniques clearly express a symbolic meaning like that attributed to thelead of the tablets themselves, that the fate of the targets should turnbackward or be scrambled, just like their written names. We also findhere yet another example of the way in which quite ordinary habitsbecame \"mystified\" in time, gathering a significance and power quiteunthinkable at earlier times.With few exceptions, \"mystical\" words or formulas do not appear inGreek tablets of the classical and Hellenistic periods, in contrast to therichly variegated language of tablets in the Roman period (first centuryC.E. onward). But these exceptions are interesting and important. Thefirst involves a set of six terms, called ephesia grammata, first attested ina fragment of Anaxilas, a comic poet of the fourth century B.C.E.: \"(an"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldunnamed person) . . . carries around marvelous Ephesian letters insewn pouches.\"29 These terms (askion, kataskion, lix, tetrax, damname-neus, and aisionlaisid) were believed to possess the ability to endowthose who wore them (especially boxers, so it seems) with great power,both defensive and aggressive.30 They remained well known for centu-ries, appearing in several later spells and charms. The Christian writer,Clement of Alexandria (ca. 200 C.E.) not only lists the terms but callsthem \"famous among many people.\"31 More significantly, they appear inat least one lead amulet from the Hellenistic period and thus clearlyestablish the use of \"mystical\" terms (voces mysticae) long before theirwidespread circulation from the first century C.E. onward.32 This foldedtablet from Crete, dating to the fourth century B.C.E., must have beencarried as a protective amulet (line 20 speaks of protecting the weareragainst hostile spells); it contains several of the ephesia grammata: askiand kataski (lines 9-10), lix (lines 5 and 10), forms of tetrax (lines 5,11-12), and damnameneus (line 16).33 A second exception is a curious stonemonument from Greece, dating to the late fifth century B.C.E., whichJeffery takes to be a thank offering by an unnamed person for thesuccessful punishment of a personal enemy.34 She offers the followingtentative reconstruction of the text: \"The Ephesian vengeance was sentdown (?); first Hecate injures (??) the possessions (??) of Megara in allthings; then Persephone already is reporting all the (prayers?) to thegods.\"35The significance of this evidence for the development of defixionesfrom those of the classical and Hellenistic periods to later Roman typescannot be exaggerated. As even a brief comparison of any early and latetablet from the following collection will reveal, the differences are realand many:1. in some of the late Roman examples (esp. fourth to fifth centuriesC.E.), voces mysticae and other forms of \"unintelligible\" writing can takeup as much as 80 to 90 percent of the tablet, whereas in the amulet fromCrete discussed previously, the ephesia grammata occupy no more than aline or two;2. the names and invocations of the gods and spirits are notably longer,more complex, and aggressively international in the later examples;3. drawings of human and animal figures, along with the probablyastrological charakteres, become omnipresent;4. a general increase in Egyptian elements occurs, reflecting the factthat most of the surviving formularies were produced and copied inEgypt and thus reveal the fusion of Greek, Egyptian, and other cultures"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction   7typical of Egypt from the first century C.E. onward; among these Egyp-tian elements, one of the most notable is the use of threats against thegods.36And yet we must not overemphasize these differences, as earlier inter-preters have done, out of a desire to protect ancient Greek culture, evenin its \"lower\" forms (such as the defixiones) from comparison with the\"degenerate syncretism\" of late Roman \"magic\" and \"superstition.\" Forunderneath these differences, we can also detect clear lines of continuity.For example, the earlier ephesia grammata continue to appear in thelater texts37 and may now be regarded as forerunners of the more elabo-rate voces mysticae so characteristic of them. Indeed, already on theearly Hellenistic amulet from Crete, the originally impersonal ephesiagrammata are addressed as powers in their own right: they have becomethe names of supernatural entities, just as the later voces mysticae cometo function as the secret and powerful names of the gods invoked in thespells.38Also, the relatively simple forms of the earlier tablets may be ex-plained by the strong likelihood that the commissioning and depositingof tablets with simple written formulas were accompanied by oralprayers, invocations, and incantations. Gradually, with the growth ofwritten language in Greek culture, these oral accompaniments werewritten down and took their place on the tablet alongside the traditionalelements (the names of the targets and the deities and the verbs ofbinding).39While the evidence for the use of charakteres and engraved figures onearlier tablets is virtually nonexistent, the stone monument discussedpreviously does incorporate, in the midst of its text, the head of a ram.In this regard, it may also be worth noting that the use of dolls ororiginally separate item (the figurine) eventually moved onto the tabletitself (as a drawing of a human figure).Still, there can be no mistaking the more elaborate forms of speech intablets of the Roman period; in general, they are the most certain indica-tors of a late date. A partial catalogue of these nonstandard forms ofspeech would include the following:1. palindromes;2. charakteres (see Figure 1);3. vowel-series40;4. triangles, squares, \"wings,\" and other geometric shapes made up ofletters;figurines with early defixiones may provide another instance in which an"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"FIGURE 1.

To be fair, such interpretationsare not modern inventions but reach back to ancient critics. In his satireon such practices (PhilopseudeslLover of Lies, chap. 10), Lucian ofSamosata has his protagonist protest: \"Unless you can show me how it'sphysically possible for a fever to be frightened or a swelling to be scaredaway from the groin by a holy name or a word in some foreign language,the cases you quote are still only old wives tales.\" On the other hand, theNeoplatonic philosopher lamblichus (ca. 300 C.E.), in his passionatedefense of the same practices (he calls them \"theurgy\"), argues thatcharakteres and foreign names,41 when used properly, convey to thetheurgist the powers of the gods. He adds that names lose theirtheurgical power when translated into Greek.42 In the long run, how-ever, the view of Lucian has prevailed and impressed itself on Sir JamesFrazer and his successors. Only recently have efforts been made toreverse these effects, efforts directed at understanding the foundationsof such beliefs, without slipping into lamblichus's posture of defendingthem as true.43At the center of these efforts lies the work of the anthropologistStanley J. Tambiah. His 1968 essay, \"The Magical Power of Words,\"though written with no apparent knowledge of ancient Mediterraneandefixiones, presents a definitive repudiation of the \"gibberish theory\"regarding voces mysticae.*4 For our purposes, we may concentrate onone aspect of Tambiah's argument, his analysis of special languages inSinhalese spells employed to invoke demons of illness. In this case,where the healer is conscious of addressing a \"foreign\" audience ofsupernatural spirits, it would be entirely inappropriate to use one's na-tive, human, ordinary language. Thus the mysterious language of spellsdoes not violate the basic rule of speech communication, that the partiesinvolved must understand one another, because the voces mysticae repre-sent \"the language the demons can understand.\"45 Along similar lines, P.C. Miller and R. T. Wallis have recently shown in separate essays that inthe culture of late antiquity it was precisely the use of unintelligibleforms of speech that signaled the passage from the lower mundane"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldrealms into the sphere of true spiritual conversation with higher ordersof being.46 The words of the Christian philosopher Clement of Alexan-dria (ca. 200 C.E.) represent a wide consensus that normal human lan-guage was not appropriate in addressing gods or any higher beings:\"Plato assigns a special discourse (dialektos) to the gods and he reachesthis conclusion from the experience of dreams and oracles but most of allfrom those possesseed by daimones, for they do not speak their ownlanguage or discourse but rather the language of the daimones whopossess them.\"47Of course, this is not to say that either those who commissioneddefixiones or those who prepared them understood the voces mysticae.That was not the point. What mattered was the belief that these invoca-tions and secret names were understood by the spirits themselves. Just asin ordinary human encounters, the key to success was to address thesesuperior beings by their proper names and titles. In this sense, althoughit is interesting to note that many of the voces have turned out to be\"real\" words borrowed and frequently distorted from other \"real\" lan-guages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian, and various forms of ancient Egyp-tian and Coptic), this finding is quite irrelevant to understanding theattitudes of those who purchased the tablets. For the anxious client,what mattered was the belief that the magos possessed the special knowl-edge to get these names and titles right. But as the many variants reveal,we can see that even they did not always copy the voces with totalaccuracy. We should also consider the likelihood that there was an ele-ment of status enhancement for professionals in maintaining a core of\"unintelligible\" discourse, for this left the client with little choice but toassume that the specialist alone, through superior wisdom, understoodthe meaning and significance of this higher language. There is muchmore to Tambiah's essay, but on the single issue of \"unintelligibility\" hehas pulled the rug from under smug interpreters who have, it turns out,vainly contrasted the benighted irrationality of superstitious and igno-rant primitives with their own modern rationality.Charakteres occupy a special place in the symbol system of ancientspells, for their omnipresence—though not earlier than the second cen-tury C.E.—as well as for the scant attention they have received. Theyappear on amulets,48 defixiones,*9 a private divination apparatus fromPergamum,50 in recipes (including Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, and Arabiccollections) for defixiones and other spells,51 and in treatises of ancientGnostics.52 In addition, they appear in a public inscription on the wall ofthe theater at Miletus, where each of seven charakteres is associated withtwo sets of vowels: under each set of charakteres and vowels appears the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction   11following request, \"Holy One, protect the city of Miletus and all itsinhabitants,\" and under the full set of seven columns follows a one-lineprayer, \"Archangels, protect the city of Miletus and all its inhabitants.\"53Clearly, these charakteres were seen as signs and sources of great power.They embody the classic definition of a religious symbol as embodyingand transmitting power from the divine realm to the human. But whatprecisely did they represent—traditional gods, archangels, planets, orsomething else? No doubt, like other special forms of writing ondefixiones, they were taken to be mysterious and powerful, which meansthat their \"real\" origins were not understood at all. Among competinginterpretations regarding their origin, the most promising would appearto be astrological—that they symbolized various planetary powers, pow-ers that were in turn commonly identified with angels and archangels bylate Roman astrologers.54 But whatever their origins, their presence asthe sole powers invoked on tablets from Apamea (\"most holy\" and\"lords\"), Beth Shean (\"fearsome\"), and Hebron tells us that they hadtaken on a life of their own and were seen as personifying, representing,and embodying great power.55A good number of the defixiones, most gem amulets, and many of therecipes in formularies also include drawings of human beings, animals,or mixed creatures (for example, the famous \"Anguipede\" figure of ahuman torso with head of a rooster and snakes for legs). In generalterms, the meaning or function of these figures is obvious: like the vocesmysticae which they represent, they embody and make present the real-ity of the various actors mentioned in the spell (the human target and thesupernatural beings, rarely the client). Here again, and in contrast toearly views, we can see that the function of figures on the tablets is by nomeans unique or distinctive to them. For, as Andre Grabar has noted inhis study of early Christian iconography, images in late antiquity \"seemto have been used more frequently than at other historical periods andthat an extraordinary importance was attributed to them. . . . [T]heportrait of the sovereign replaced the sovereign. . . .

But like"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldmany other features, these drawings have been little studied. A. D.Nock's plea of 1929 for a study of these drawings and their iconographicbearings remains largely unheeded.58Gods, Daimones, and Spirits of the DeadThe role of images and figures as mediators of power brings us finally tothe names of deities and other spiritual entities on defixiones. In discuss-ing these names, it is essential to keep in mind three fundamental charac-teristics of the \"spiritual universe\" of ancient Mediterranean culture:first, the cosmos literally teemed, at every level and in every location,with supernatural beings; second, although ancient theoreticians some-times tried to sort these beings into clear and distinct categories, mostpeople were less certain about where to draw the lines between gods,daimones, planets, stars, angels, cherubim,, and the like; and third, thespirit or soul of dead persons, especially of those who had died prema-turely or by violence, roamed about in a restless and vengeful mood neartheir buried body.It has long been customary to distinguish ancient defixiones from otherareas of ancient culture—that is, to separate magic from religion—bypointing out, as does H. Versnel, that the gods named in them \"invariablyeither belong to the domain of death, the underworld, the chthonic or arereputed to have connections with magic.\"59 But such observations tell usprecious little, for the supernatural beings named in defixiones appearalso in what we otherwise call ancient religion, where virtually every godor spirit reveals some connection with death and the underworld. Inshort, when Jewish (and later Christian) elements (angels, archangels,and the figure of IAO, the god of Israel) are taken into account, they will beseen to have almost no chthonic ties. In short, the presence or absence ofchthonic deities offers no hope for a satisfactory differentiation between\"religion\" and \"magic.\"Once it became customary to write down, rather than recite, thenames of the gods to whom the spells were addressed, a clear order ofpreference became apparent: Hermes is by far the most common; he isfollowed by Hekate, Kore and Persephone, Hades (also known asPluto), Ge/Gaia, \"the holy goddess\" (at Selinus in Sicily), and finallyDemeter (often cited together with \"the gods with her\"). Others ad-dressed include Zeus,60 \"all the gods and goddesses,\" Kronos, theMother of the gods, and the Furies (Erinyes).61 On Latin tablets, themost common names are the Manes (spirits of deceased ancestors),Jupiter, Pluto (the Greek Hades), Nemesis, Mercury (the Greek Her-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction   13mes), and various water nymphs. Now the 130 or so tablets from Bath,dedicated to the goddess Sulis (also called Minerva) must be added atthe top of the list. Finally come those highly syncretized spells, primarilyfrom North Africa and Egypt in the third to sixth centuries C.E., wheregods, daimones with secret names, personified words (for example,EULAMON), voces mysticae containing elements of foreign deities (IAO,ERESCHIGAL), and especially a variety of Egyptian deities come togetherto form the rich international blend that is so characteristic of late an-tique culture in all of its dimensions. Among the Egyptian contributions,the most prominent are Thoth (commonly identified with Hermes),Seth, and Osiris. In addition to contributions from Egypt, one findssignificant elements from Jewish sources, from Persia, and at a later datefrom Christianity. In general, two factors seem to have governed theselection of gods and spirits and their names: first, local customs andbeliefs; and second, the recipes available through the formularies ownedand used by local experts. In this sense, we may use what we read ondefixiones as a reasonably accurate measure of prevailing beliefs at par-ticular times and places.Like other forms of human speech with which they show close similari-ties (legal,62 cultic,63 epistolary64), the language of defixiones is highlyformulaic.65 Various schemes have been proposed for organizing theseformulas, most recently by C. Faraone. He proposes a simple yet com-prehensive threefold division of styles or types, although he emphasizesthat all three could be used at one and the same time, even on a singletablet66:1. the direct binding formula (\"I bind X!\"): Faraone calls this a per-formative utterance, designed to operate automatically, through the ef-fective force of the words themselves and without intervention from anysupernatural source; here it should be recalled, however, that gods mayhave been invoked orally, when the tablet was either commissioned ordeposited;2. prayer formulas that appeal directly or indirectly for supernaturalassistance (\"Restrain X!\");3. persuasive analogies in which the client expresses the wish that thetarget should take on the characteristics of something mentioned in thespell (\"As this lead is cold and useless, so may X be cold and useless!\");this, too, must have been regularly coupled, even if orally, with anappeal for divine assistance.67To these basic types we may add a partial list of recurrent features in thelanguage or discourse of the defixiones: repetition, pleonasm, metaphor"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"14 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldand simile, personification, rhythmic phrases, exaggeration, threats,promises, prayers, and formal appeals.68 Once again, it must be empha-sized that these features are not distinctive of defixiones but insteadmark them as part of the general culture of their time.The last piece of information engraved on any tablet would be thename of the target and, in cases where it was appropriate, the name ofthe client. Not all tablets included a personal name, but it is clear,especially in the Roman period, that tablets were sometimes prepared inadvance, with space left for inserting the names provided by payingcustomers. In cases where the names were too long for the space, thescribe was forced to squeeze the name or to write the final letters on aslant or even between lines.69 We have seen that names were oftenwritten in symbolically significant ways on early Greek tablets—theletters could be scrambled or written backward—so that names clearlyoperated as more than labels. The name embodied the person or theanimal and gave some measure of control over them. The same ruleapplied, as we have seen, to gods and spirits.Another unusual characteristic in the treatment of names was thepractice, from the second century C.E. onward, of identifying personalnames by matrilineal descent (\"I curse X, whose mother is Y\").70 Evenin Jewish spells this was the custom, so much so that a noted rabbi,Abaye (ca. 325 C.E.), once reported the following: \"Mother told me,'All incantations which are repeated several times must contain thename of the patient's mother.' \"71 Various explanations have been ad-vanced for this unusual custom: because precise identification was neces-sary, only the mother could be known for certain; influence may havecome from Babylonia or Egypt, where matrilineal lineage appears inearly spells; the practice was taken over from the world of slaves, whowere regularly identified by matrilineal descent; and in Egypt, Jewishand Christian funerary monuments sometimes identify the deceased bydescent from the mother.72 Although several signs point in the directionof Egyptian influence, we must suppose that other forces were also atwork, arising from social and psychological dynamics peculiar to theancient Mediterranean. In the end, however, the practice must also berelated to the countercultural and subversive character of the defixionesthemselves.Dolls, Hair, and NailsAs complex as the inscribed tablet sometimes appears, especially fromthe second century C.E. onward, it might require still more preparations"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction   15before it was ready to leave the shop. Frequently these took the form ofseparate items attached to the tablet itself.Figurines73One of the most striking features of ancient defixiones emerges from theuse of dolls or figurines as part of the binding process. A significantnumber of such figurines have survived, thus confirming and illustratingthe literary texts74 (see Chapter 8, esp. Plato) and formularies (see Chap-ter 2 and PGM), which speak of them as if they were a commonplace.The earliest discussion occurs in an Egyptian text of the Middle King-dom (ca. 2133-1786 B.C.E.), which prescribes the making of a wax imageof a personal enemy, to be buried in a grave for harsh treatment byOsiris.75 Similar dolls were used by Greek cities in public binding ceremo-nies as early as the fourth century B.c.E.76Three types of figurines were used in the private sphere of defix-iones.71 Almost all, whether made of lead, mud, or wax, had their handstied (\"bound\") behind their backs; others appear to have been deliber-ately mutilated78 (Figure 2). Frequently the name of the target was in-scribed on the figurine.79 The first type of figurine, which appears inlove/sex spells, represents the desired object of one's affections. Forexample, a small human shape was found in Egypt, attached to a lovespell written on papyrus80; another (see pp. 97-100) was produced inaccordance with an elaborate recipe in PGM, which called for thirteenneedles to be inserted at symbolically appropriate spots. Whatever elseone might say about such puzzling \"sex objects\" found with defixiones, itis important to emphasize that they were not curses and were not alwaysintended to harm the target.81 The second type was used to assaultpersonal enemies; a special subset of this type was discovered in gravesfrom the Kerameikos (Athens) and dates from around 400 B.C.E. (Fig-ure 3). The group includes four lead figurines (see pp. 127-29), eachencased in a miniature coffin made of two lead sheets, with names of thetargets inscribed on all of the sheets and on three of the figurines.82Finally, we note a unique instance of nine little horse figurines fromAntioch. Six are inscribed with a single name: Huperochos, Polukles,Poluandros, Dithurambos, Sundikos, and Pemphreos; the other threehave two names: Euaspis and Damastes, Aristenetos and Pontouchos,and Anchitheos and Thetis. In all probability the horses were intendedto represent the teams of competitors in chariot races, for there arenumerous examples of curse tablets from the world of ancient racingthat name both drivers and steeds.83"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"16Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient WorldFIGURE 2.

Kagarow, who pro-vides a full discussion of nails as symbolic instruments in ancient as wellas modern cultures, insists that their function here is to add pain anddeath to the spell. But as we have seen, this fails to do justice to their usein love spells. In fact, the root meaning probably derives from the ordi-nary function of nails, which is to fasten, to fix, to tie down, and thus tobind.89 In any case, their universal application tells us that whatever their\"original\" purpose, they soon became a prescribed part of the processfor preparing a defixio. In just one instance was a nail actually used forits ordinary purpose, to fix a tablet in place. Recent excavations in thecircus at Carthage have recovered in situ a folded tablet, deliberatelyfixed to the compacted floor of the circus by a long bronze nail. Both arewell preserved (Figure 4).Depositing the TabletsDefixiones differed from amulets in one fundamental respect; once theywere inscribed, they were deposited in special locations where theirpowers took effect. PGM VII, lines 451-52, gives a typical list of suchplaces: \"have (the tablet) buried or [put in] a river or land or sea orstream or coffin or in a well.\"90 Other places included, for love spells, thehome of the desired target; for racing, the stadium floor91; and sanctuar-ies associated with chthonic deities.92Many graves, which appear to have been the most common place ofrials inserted or attached, almost all defixiones were rolled or folded;"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction19FIGURE 4.

The"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldprecise function of these \"dead souls\" (nekudaimones in Greek) is notalways clear. Did they simply transmit the petition of the tablet to thegods, in their capacity as beings caught midway between the living andthe dead? Or did they enact the spell themselves, under the watchful eyeof the gods? Perhaps the answer is that their role changed over time andaccording to local beliefs. In any case, the gods were always involved inone way or the other. The standard technique consisted of using legalterminology, whereby the case of the target was handed over or trans-ferred to a divine jurisdiction (\"I hand over X before/to the presence ofHermes\").94In thinking about how tablets were deposited, we need also to askwhether it was the client or the scribe or magos who carried out thephysical act of deposition. Like the related question of who made theinscriptions on the tablets, this one concerns and shapes our understand-ing of the total process. Unfortunately, there is little direct evidence tosuggest an answer one way or another. In some cases, the depositingsurely required no special skill—as in dropping the tablet into a well orspring—and we can well imagine the client carrying out the task alone.But in other cases, involving defixiones placed in graves or buried at thestarting gates of race courses, the likelihood is much greater that scribesor magoi, or their assistants, undertook this task as part of their serviceto the client. It is unlikely that a private citizen would enter theKerameikos at night, dig up the grave of a young person, and place thetablet in the corpse's right hand.95Before leaving the question of where the tablets were placed, and whoplaced them, we must re.emphasize one aspect of the process that has ledto serious misunderstanding in the past. The business of commissioning atablet entailed much more than buying a piece of folded metal and throw-ing it into a well. As the recipes from PGM clearly demonstrate, the totalprocess could be quite complex. It required invocations, purifications,fumigations, prayers, instruments, rituals, and more. In an earlier literarysource, the second Idyll of Theocritus, the story of Simaetha's efforts toregain the affections of Delphis is no less complex. Earlier still, when thesons of Autolycus heal Odysseus's wounds in the Odyssey (19.457-58),they apply bandages but also pronounce a spell (epaoide) to stop the flowof blood. In short, the client's attempt to prepare a defixio, from the initialdecision to its actual commission, must be located in a series of actions, atotal flow of events rather than a single isolated act. It is a serious mistaketo focus attention solely on the innocuous piece of corroded lead and notto perceive other actions that accompanied its commission.96A related and equally serious issue concerns the balance between"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction   21private and public aspects of commissioning and depositing a defixio. Ithas generally been assumed, with important consequences for interpreta-tion (\"Those foolish people believed that by simply tossing a hunk ofuseless metal into a well and mumbling a few senseless words they couldaffect the lives of others!\"), that the process was entirely private, secret,and hidden from the public eye. Yet there are numerous indications thatsuch was not the case, not least among them the undeniable indicatorsthat defixiones worked, or were believed to work, which amounts tomuch the same thing. First, almost everyone, from aristocrats and phi-losophers to slaves and jockeys, seems to have known the defixio as asocial fact. Second, the public monuments that speak of curses andbinding spells belong not to the private realm but to the public (see pp.246-48). Third, the fact that in the famous case involving the unex-pected illness of Germanicus (see pp. 254-55) someone thought to lookfor tablets or spells—and found them—suggests that people knew bothwho their enemies were and what actions they might take against them.Fourth, to return briefly to the jilted Simaetha, she does not limit hercountermeasures to rituals and spells but goes down to the gymnasiumto confront her faithless lover face-to-face. Love spells in particularpresent a strong case for supposing that the use of a defixio was but onestrategy among several for achieving one's goal. Fifth, one suspects thatthe perpetrators (if not the client, at least the scribe or magos) were lessthan totally discreet about their business, perhaps intentionally so, andlet it be known that a \"fix\" had been put on so-and-so.97 If this morepublic aspect of commissioning and depositing defixiones is at all true toreality, we will need to revise our thinking about whether and how theyworked.What Effects Did Tablets Seek?persons or animals under the client's power, against their will and cus-tomarily without their knowledge. In some cases, the wish is expressedas an intention to inflict personal harm or death. Kagarow lists thefollowing examples: death, illness (fever, consumption, blindness, dumb-ness, lameness, broken limbs), loss of memory, various forms of mentalsuffering, sleeplessness, involuntary celibacy, loss of family and house,public humiliation, defeat in war and athletic competition, failure inbusiness, conviction in public courts, denial of an afterlife, and generallack of success.98 In racing spells, horses are to fall down, break theirlimbs, and rear up at the start.

Once again, the tendency among interpreters has beento read them literally. Here we might begin with our own forms ofcursing. What do we mean when we blurt out, \"Screw you!\"? Is this anexpression of our desire for sexual intercourse? When we hear team-mates or sports fans shout, \"Kill the bum!\", do we load our rifles? Twoconsiderations seem in order here. First, the audience may not be exclu-sively, or even primarily, \"out there.\" As Tambiah, among others, hasargued, spells are directed primarily to the human participants in allritual action.\" Second, the function of verbal speech-forms represents aunique feature of human language, namely, its ability to communicateand give form to the expressive and metaphorical aspects of humanexperience. We take this treatment of language for granted when weread poetry or novels. Perhaps we should apply it to the language ofspells and curses. One is reminded of an anecdote told by Mary Doug-las: \"Once when a band of !Kung Bushmen had performed their rainrituals, a small cloud appeared on the horizon, grew and darkened.Then rain fell. But the anthropologists who asked if the Bushmen reck-oned the rite had produced the rain, were laughed out of court. . . .How naive can we get about the beliefs of others?\"100Did They Work?Until recently, the very idea of asking such a question would haveseemed absurd. Of course this stuff doesn't work! Indeed, from the timeof Sir James Frazer to the present, the ruling assumption has been thatspells, charms, and amulets cannot work—by definition. Once again,the initial assumption sets the agenda for the ensuing discussion andinterpretation: because the beliefs are assumed to be false and becausethe practices are taken to be ineffective, how are we to explain thepersistent irrationality of those who pursued them through so manycenturies.What would happen, however, if we changed our initial assumptionand began with the idea that these beliefs and practices must haveworked in some sense; if we indicated that we can no longer accept thenotion that those who hold to them are irrational; and if we recoveredour sense of poetic language and expressive ritual as fundamental con-stituents of all human experience?"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction   23Roger Tomlin's introduction to the Bath tablets may be taken as ameasure of a new climate regarding the treatment of the effectiveness ofancient spells and curses. \"Did the Bath tablets work?\" he asks.

Or rather that they were believed to work; andperhaps, that this belief was justified.\"101 Of course, we need not assumethat they worked in the same way that the participants themselves be-lieved. But neither are we justified in imposing simplistic or literalisticpreconceptions on these participants and their beliefs. Tomlin offersseveral useful insights as to how the tablets might have worked. Theprocess \"removed intolerable tensions.\"102 It \"allowed a transfer of emo-tion.\"103 More pragmatically, he continues, \"to inscribe a curse tabletand throw it into the sacred pool relieved the injured party's feelings;something at least had been done.\"104Much more has been written on this subject, including Levi-Strauss'sremarkable essay on \"The Sorcerer and His Magic,\"105 and GezaRoheim's treatment of what he calls \"the magical principle,\" describedvariously as \"the counterphobic attitude,\"106 and \"the ever-present ma-trix of our actions.\"107 In line with these neo-Freudian views, we mayalso mention the work of E. E. Evans-Pritchard, the British anthropolo-gist whose work on African witchcraft has shown that curses and spellsplay an important role in explaining personal misfortune and in excusingpublic failure.108Defixiones and the LawIt has often been assumed that the use and preparation of defixioneswere against the law, despite the fact that classical Greek law codesnever mention katadesmoi as such.109 Perhaps, some have suggested,there was no need for such legislation, specific cases being covered bylaws against impiety (asebeia).110 Or perhaps only those that fell underthe rubric of homicide, those that called for the death of the target, weretreated as illegal. On the other hand, in a law code of 479 B.C.E., thecommunity of Ionian Greeks at Teos decreed as a capital offense thepreparation and use of pharmaka.m It is worth noting here that whilepharmaka sometimes referred to poisonous potions, it was also usedfrequently in an extended way to designate spells and curses. Plato'sproposed legislation against curse tablets, outlined in the Laws (see pp.249-50), yields uncertain results on this point.

We will find a single answer to both questions.feature of ancient Mediterranean cultures. What is more, they cut acrossall social categories; on this point there is virtual unanimity. The reasonfor their pervasive presence lies in the observation that they worked, orthat they were believed to work, which comes to the same thing. Theirsuccess and effectiveness also explains why they were treated as illegalor dangerous. Dangerous not because they always intended harm butbecause they worked. Better yet, they worked in ways that could not becontrolled by the legal, social, and political centers of ancient society.Indeed, at times they stood outside, perhaps in direct opposition tothose centers. The idea that magoi could dispense power on matters ofcentral importance to human life; the idea that any private person, fornothing but a small fee, could put that power to use in a wide variety ofcircumstances; and the idea that all of these transactions were availableto individuals who stood outside and sometimes against the \"legitimate\"corporate structures of society—all of these ideas presented a seriousthreat to those who saw themselves as jealous guardians of power ema-nating from the center of that society, whether Greek, Roman, Anti-ochene, or Rabbinic. Here was power beyond their control, power inthe hands of freely negotiating individuals.\"Magic\" and \"Religion\"We have avoided the use of the term \"magic\" in this volume. Custom-and thus contrasted with ancient \"religion.\" But it is our conviction thatmagic, as a definable and consistent category of human experience,simply does not exist. For as one critic has put it,the scientific debate over the relation between \"magic\" and \"religion\" is adiscussion of an artificial problem created by defining religion on the idealpattern of Christianity. The elements of man's beliefs and ceremonies . . .which did not coincide with the ideal type of religion was—and is—calledWe have already seen that defixiones must be treated as a familiararily, defixiones have been treated as an expression of ancient \"magic\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Introduction   25\"magic.\" . . . \"Magic\" became—and still becomes—a refuse-heap for theelements which are not sufficiently \"valuable\" to get a place within \"reli-gion.'114By substituting the generic phrase \"sanctioned or official beliefs\" for\"Christianity\" in Petersson's lament, we may extend it to non- or pre-Christian societies as well—the beliefs and practices of \"the other\" willalways be dubbed as \"magic,\" \"superstition\" and the like. Even thosedefinitions that speak of an overlap between magic and religion mustpresuppose them somehow to be distinct and definable entities.115 Byimplication, we also reject as useless all evolutionary schemes, whetherthe classic theory according to which magic precedes first religion andthen science116 or the converse view that magic represents religion in astate of decay117 or the related stance according to which religion is thework of the literate and cultured classes whereas magic and superstition—often used interchangeably—represent the stunted circumstances of theignorant and the unlettered.118 Thus the use of the term \"magic\" tells uslittle or nothing about the substance of what is under description. Thesentence, \"X is/was a magician!\" tells us nothing about the beliefs andpractices of X; the only solid information that can be derived from itconcerns the speaker's attitude toward X and their relative socialrelationship—that X is viewed by the speaker as powerful, peripheral,and dangerous.119 Thus the only justifiable (answerable) historical ques-tion about magic is not \"What are the characteristics of, for example,Greek magic?\" but rather \"Under what conditions, by whom, and ofwhom does the term 'magic' come to be used?\" Thus our treatment ofancient defixiones does not locate them in the category of magic, for in ourview no such category exists.120 Instead, our approach has been moredescriptive—of what they say and claim to do, of who made and usedthem, and of what various people thought of them. Of course, this is notto argue that some of the material in ancient spells, defixiones, andformularies—the sorts of things customarily labeled as magical—do notderive from \"religious\" (cultic) sources. There was a great deal of borrow-ing in every corner of late antiquity and the magoi were certainly noexception.121The Pre-history and Post-history of Cursingof swearing during moments of anger, frustration, uncertainty, and in-tense competition. Like all forms of cursing, our own curious and distinc-Defixiones represent but a small sample of the universal human practice"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"26 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldtive swearwords and oaths represent highly formalized, sometimes evenquite ancient, verbal formulas. Ancient Mediterranean cultures nodoubt had their own forms of private, spur-of-the-moment swearing,122but they also developed more highly formalized, even ritualized expres-sions of their desire for protection, aid, and revenge against enemies realor imagined. The defixiones in this volume present these formalizedexpressions as they were deployed by private individuals against per-sonal and sometimes public enemies. As such, they are to be distin-guished from public forms of cursing, even though the techniques usedare often the same. In the first century C.E., for instance, the citizens ofSyedra (Asia Minor) consulted the oracle of Apollo at Claros whenplagued by pirates. The god advised them to set up a statue of Ares, thetraditional god of war, bound with chains of Hermes and supplicatingthe figure of Dike/Justice.123Much earlier, the civilizations of the ancient Near East and Egyptdisplay a wide variety of techniques for cursing and binding others andfor protecting individuals against hostile spells. Like those in the periodcovered by the present collection, these spells were used both in publicsettings and by private parties. In some cases, the parallels with laterMediterranean defixiones seem more than coincidental. A Hittite ritual,presumably used by a professional, for counteracting spells uses thefamiliar formula, \"Just as ... so also,\" four times in its prescriptions(\"Just as I have burned these threads and they will not come back, evenso let also these words of the sorcerer be burned up!\").124 Various Babylo-nian rituals prescribe the use of figurines and amulets in the dialectic ofspell and counterspell.125 Equally striking are fragments of Egyptian potsand figurines from the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.C.E.; in-scribed with the names of hated foreigners (among them the ruler ofJerusalem and his retainers), the pots were then smashed in order \"tobreak the power of their enemies.\"126 The practice of formalized cursingwas also well established in ancient Israel, most notably in the blessingsand curses which conclude the giving of the Mosaic covenant in Deutero-nomy 28.127 Curse formulas, with clear parallels in other Near Easterncultures, appear in a number of biblical prophecies where they are di-rected against enemies of Israel, Israelites who violate the covenant, andcriminals of various sorts.128 An early student of Greek and Latindefixiones concludes from his examination of six biblical curses (Judges17:1-2; Malachi 3:8-9; Zechariah 5:2-4; Jeremiah 51:60-64; Ezekiel4:1-3; 2 Kings 13:17-19) that these texts \"contain all the principal ele-ments of defixiones . . . (that) the Hebrews were familiar with the writ-ten curse, of near kin to defixio, as early as the first part of the sixth"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introduction   27century B.C.\"129 All in all, there seems little reason to doubt the word ofS. A. B. Mercer, given already in 1915, thatthe malediction in Babylonian and Assyrian times was a highly developedlegal and religious ceremony, universally practiced and respected. It notonly figured in ceremonies of great occasions, but also penetrated into theeveryday life of the people. It seemed to have served almost the samepurpose as Common Law does among modern people, for it acted as arestraint, corrective, and stimulant to better deeds.130If ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian cultures provide the backgroundfor many aspects of later Mediterranean curse tablets and binding spells,we must not neglect the distinctive developments of this later period.The use of lead tablets; the appeal to Greek, Roman, Egyptian, andJewish daimones, spirits, and deities; the proliferation of occasionsdeemed appropriate for the deployment of defixiones; their increasingpopularity in the private as opposed to the public sphere; and the relatedemergence of official disapproval toward their use—these features sepa-rate later Mediterranean defixiones from their Near Eastern and Egyp-tian forerunners.There can be no doubt that the use of defixiones in the private realmsurvived the rise of Christianity. Of this there is ample proof in survivingtexts on papyrus131; in a late sermon that specifically mentions their useby Christians and argues that \"whoever, during the time of the moon'sincrease, thinks that it is possible to avert (harm) through the use ofinscribed lead tablets . . . they are not Christians but pagans\"132; and inother literary texts.133 But from the eighth century on, there is a curiousabsence of physical evidence for defixiones. Still, they did not disappearwithout a trace, not even in the Latin West. First, a little-known set ofLatin prayers, known as loricae (from the Latin for \"breastplate\") andespecially characteristic of Celtic Christianity, shows clear traces of be-ing both used against and influenced by earlier defixiones.134 Intendedfor the protection of individuals against harm of various kinds, theseloricae sometimes enumerate at great length the parts of the body to beprotected, in ways reminiscent of similar lists in curse tablets. Two pas-sages from one of the loricae (the Lorica of Laidcenn, dating from theseventh century C.E.) may even be seen as containing explicit referencesto the use of defixiones: \"Then be a most protective breastplate for mylimbs and for my inwards, so that you drive back from me the invisiblenails of the shafts that the foul fiends fashion\" (lines 51-54); and \"Pro-tect my bladder, fat and all the innumerable rows of connecting parts;protect my hairs and the remaining members whose names I have per-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldchance passed over\" (lines 79-82). The mention of \"nails\" in the firstpassage reminds us of the use of nails in many defixiones, while the useof the \"safety clause\" in the second (\"whose names I have perchancepassed over\") may derive from similar formulas in spells and charmsused to cover names or items not specifically mentioned.In addition, in a late Greek manuscript (Codex Parisinus Gr. 2419),edited by G. Midiates in the fifteenth century and no doubt copied fromearlier sources, there appears the following recipe for an amulet againstfevers: \"take the stone and inscribe on it an erect headless spirit with itshands and feet bound behind; and around it write these signs and on theback the preceding names . . . wear it under a lead plate and you will befar (removed) from any such harm. . . ,\"135 To be sure this is not adefixio, but it does contain unmistakable elements (signs, the headlessspirit, mysterious names, bound hands and feet, lead plate) from muchearlier curse tablets, binding spells, and amulets, which might suggestthat such practices had remained alive after all.Finally, there is a small body of defixiones from early modern En-gland, written on lead as well as paper, which are striking in their similar-ity to our ancient tablets136 (Figure 5). May we take these few examplesas evidence for a continous tradition of defixiones, otherwise unattestedfrom the eighth to the seventeenth centuries, or do they represent a\"revival,\" inspired perhaps by the chance discovery of ancient tablets?Perhaps not, given the absence of physical evidence for the continueduse of metal tablets in the Western and Eastern Middle Ages. Still, thepractice of formalized cursing remained alive throughout this period.To some extent, we can trace this continuity by noting a shift of media,from metal tablets to hand-written books, while, at the same time,curses on gravestones remained in constant use. Book curses, directedby scribes against those who might modify, deface, or destroy theirprecious writings may reach back as far as 3800 B.c.E.137 The earliest clearexample dates to the seventh century B.C.E. And the practice of attach-ing such curses to the colophons of medieval manuscripts of all sorts waswidespread among both Jewish and Christian copyists. The New Testa-ment Book of Revelation concludes with the following admonition: \"Iwarn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in thisbook, and if any one takes away from the words of the book of thisprophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holycity which are described in this book.\"138In the end, it would be a mistake either to overemphasize the similari-ties between curses in books and our defixiones or to ignore their differ-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Introduction29FIGURE 5.

The fact remains that after a continuous history of more thantwelve hundred years, physical evidence for their use disappears fromthe record. An explanation for this break may lie in a Christian sermonfrom the eighth century C.E. (no. 167): \"Whoever ties around the neckof humans . . . any characters ... on metal tablets made from bronze,iron, lead or any other material, such a person is not a Christian but apagan.\" Here we may be confronted with a rare instance where ecclesias-tical authorities actually succeeded in suppressing a \"pagan\" practice.For unlike many other practices, this one neither slipped through the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldantipagan filters nor found an acceptably Christian guise. It was simplytoo pagan.Notes1. In Greek, the standard term in modern discussion for an inscribed metalstrip with spells directed against others was katadesmos, derived from the verbkatadein, meaning \"to bind up,\" or \"to tie down.\" In Latin, defixio is quite rare,although forms of the verb defigere (\"to fasten\" or \"to nail down\") do appear.Latin tablets used other terms, e.g., devotio, donatio, or commonitorium; seethe discussion in Tomlin, p. 59. Jordan notes in a private communication thatkatadesmos appears to derive from the idea of binding by rolling the metal sheet;when used of other media such as stones, the term must be understood in abroader sense. By contrast, defixio, when used in the narrow sense, seems toimply the act of \"fixing\" by driving a nail through the tablet. Of course, there arerolled tablets pierced by nails, although Jordan observes that no Athenian tab-lets of the Roman period make use of nails. \"Defixio,\" he concludes, \"may wellrefer to a different kind of operation . . . from what katadesmos refers to.\" Inthis volume, we use defixio and katadesmos—sometimes \"tablets\"—in the ge-neric sense to designate spells and curses inscribed on a variety of media.2. See the most recent discussion by Tomlin, p. 59.3. Preisendanz (1930), pp. 119-20, dates the first scholarly notice ofdefixiones to 1796, when Nicolo Ignarra published a few lines on tablets discov-ered in Italy in 1755 (DT212). Jordan, in his review of Tomlin (Journal of RomanArchaeology 3 [1990]: 440) contends that DT212 is not a defixio and that the firstscholarly treatment dates to 1813, when J. D. Akerblad published an Attic tablet,Iscrizione greca sopra una lamina piombo trovata in un sepolcro nelle vicinanze deAtene (Rome, 1913). C. T. Newton's publication of the tablets from the temple ofDemeter on Cnidos (1862; see no. 89) and L. Macdonald's treatment of sixteentablets from Cyprus (1890; see pp. 132-37) mark important turning points in thestudy of these neglected documents. R. Wiinsch's collection of the Attic tablets in1897 (DTA) and A. Audollent's subsequent collection of many more defixionesfrom the Mediterranean region in 1904 (DT) made it possible for the first time toexamine all of the known evidence.

A piece of Attic black-ware, dating from the late fifth or the early fourthcentury B.C.E., and published by M.

Ill), while the other apparentlyseeks to bind (no verb is used) the tongue and power of Sitturas and Epikrates(PGM, vol. 2, Ostraka 5). A photograph of the spell against Hori appears in A.Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East (London, 1911), opposite p. 309.

PGM VIII, lines 1-63, bears the title of an erotic binding spell (phil-trokatadesmos), which it attributes to Astrapsoukos, a known magos of Persia;such spells are quite common on lead tablets. In fact, the text appeals for worldlysuccess of various sorts. See also PGM CIX, a love spell directed at a certainKalemera, and a plea for justice and revenge, dating from the sixth century C.E.,by a Christian man, directed against his daughter, Severina, and another mannamed Didymos (published with an extensive commentary by G. Bjorck, DerFluch des Christen Sabinus—Papyrus Upsaliensis 8 [Uppsala, 1938]).9. DTA 55a (see pp. 158-59) states \"I bind all of these people in lead and inwax,\" while Ovid (Loves 3.7.29) wonders whether he himself has been victim-ized (defixit) by a specialist who has written his name in red wax and pierced itwith a needle (see no. 142). See the discussion in Faraone, \"Context,\" p. 7.10. See pp. 205-7; such bowls were normally used for protective, not aggres-sive purposes.11. The recipes used in the later Roman empire in producing defixiones donot always specify lead. PGM X, lines 24-35, a spell for restraining anger, callsfor a gold or silver strip; PGM IV, lines 2145ff., a multipurpose spell for obtain-ing oracles, wrecking chariots during races, and undoing other people's bindingspells (!), calls for iron, whereas an eighth century Christian sermon againstpagan practices condemns the use of metal tablets made from bronze, iron, orlead. By and large, gold and silver were reserved for protective amulets and formedical spells to cure various diseases and infirmities, although other materialscould be used for the same purposes. On the use of amulets for healing andother purposes, see R. Kotansky, \"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation onInscribed Greek Amulets,\" in Magika, pp. 107-37.

The tablet itselfcontained .02 percent silver and the lead probably came from the famous minesat Laurion, south of Athens.14. See PGM VII, line 397, and Sepher ha-Razim, p. 49, second firmament,line 68.15. Tomlin, p. 83. In his review of Tomlin (pp. 439-40), Jordan doubtswhether the tablets would have been heated before being inscribed. He notesthat several recipes in PGM demand the use of cold lead, e.g., PGM XXXVI,line 2.16. See Jordan, TILT, pp. 226-28, and Faraone, \"Context,\" p. 4, for a discus-sion of lead as a medium for writing documents other than curses and spells.17. Jordan, \"Agora,\" p. 207.18.

See pp. 249-50.23. See pp. 158-59.24. Jordan, \"Agora,\" p. 210. More recently, in a paper presented to the Ameri-can Philological Association (1989, Baltimore), Jordan has argued that these textswere inscribed by the very same professional, civic scribes-(moonlighting afterhours?) who worked in buildings close to the site (a well in front of the MiddleStoa) where the defixiones were discovered. For Jewish amulets and spells, Mi-chael Swartz has reached similar conclusions. He argues that the so-called magicalmaterials from the Cairo Geniza were copied out by the same hands that producedother, more \"secular\" or public documents for the Jewish community; see \"ScribalMagic and its Rhetoric: Formal Patterns in Medieval Hebrew and Aramaic Incan-tation Texts from the Cairo Geniza,\" HTR 83 (1990): 163-80.25. So Tomlin, pp. 98-99.26. Tomlin, p. 100.27. Jeffery, pp. 72-75, gives a list of 25 defixiones which can be safely datedto the fifth century B.C.E.; Jordan, SGD, extends the list to 1985.28. SGD, p. 162, mentions an early defixio (fifth or fourth century B.C.E.)from the Athenian Agora that has deliberately scrambled the names of thetargets.29. From his lost play, The Harp Maker, as cited by Athenaeus, LearnedBanquet 548c (CAP, frag. 18); slightly later, the comic poet Menander alsomentions them, adding that they were used with newly weds to ward off spells(CAP, Menander frag. 371 = Suda, s.v. alexipharmakd).

A similar phenomenon, dating from approximately the same time, ap-pears in Latin texts, first mentioned by Cato in his On Agriculture 160 (a spell fordislocated bones): \"Take a green reed four or five feet long and split it down themiddle, and let two men hold it to your hips.

The monument is IG 4.496, found near modern Phychtia, a town near thesite of ancient Mycenae; see the discussion in Jeffery, pp. 69-76.36. On Egyptian \"magic,\" a category that seems indistinguishable from whatmight elsewhere be called \"religion,\" see J. F. Borghouts, Ancient EgyptianMagical Texts (Leiden, 1978), and C. Jacq, Egyptian Magic (Chicago, 1985).There are very few aspects of Greco-Roman \"magic\" in Egypt that are notanticipated in earlier Egyptian tradition. It is also true that we are much betterinformed about early Egyptian beliefs and practices; if early Greek or Etruscanhandbooks had survived, they might have yielded a similar picture.37. Some examples: PGM VII, lines 451-52 (in a recipe for an all-purposedefixio): \"Write the Orphic formula, saying 'askei kai tasked . . .\"; PGM LXX,line 12 (a spell to protect against punishments in the underworld): ASKEIKATASKEI ERON . . . ; the term damnameneus appears frequently (PGM II, lines163-64; III, line 511, etc.).38. See the intelligent discussion of F. Graf, \"Prayer in Magic and ReligiousRitual,\" in Magika, pp. 188-97."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"34 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World39. The same point is made persuasively by Kotansky, \"Incantations,\" pp.109-10, and Faraone, \"Context,\" pp. 5-6. The early separation of oral andwritten aspects of curses might explain the unusual cache of forty blank tablets(DT109), each rolled up and pierced with a nail, found at Rom in France (Deux-Sevres). If these represent real defixiones, we can imagine that they were depos-ited with no written inscription and only a series of oral spells, which in this casewould have included the name to the target as well; see the cautious remarks ofFaraone, \"Context,\" p. 24, n. 19.40. On the use of letters, especially vowels, in spells see the still essentialwork of F. Dornseiff, Das Alphabet in Mystik und Magie (Leipzig, 1925). A textfrom the rhetorical writer, Demetrius (On Style, chap. 71; ca. first century C.E.),should be noted in connection with the frequent appearance of vowel series: \"InEgypt the priests, when singing hymns in praise of the gods, employ the sevenvowels, which they utter in due succession (i.e., in order); and the sound ofthese letters is so euphonious that men listen to it in place of flute and lyre.\" Theliturgical use of vowels was also practiced by the Valentinian Christian, Marcos,whose congregants lined up and recited the vowels in praise and evocation of thefather of all (Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 1.14.Iff.). The seven Greek vowelswere also associated with planets, angels, and sounds and were eventually in-voked as powers in their own right. Their number (seven) also carried mythologi-cal and cosmological significance. In Egypt, the use of vowels, whose inventionwas attributed to Thoth (cf. Plato, Philebus 18B-C), allowed the precise pronun-ciation of ritual texts. See C.-E. Ruelle, \"Le chant des sept voyelles grecques,\"Revue des etudes grecques 2 (1889): 38-44, 393-95; Dornseiff, Das Alphabet,pp. 35-60; Patricia Cox Miller, \"In Praise of Nonsense,\" in Classical Mediterra-nean Spirituality, ed. A. H. Armstrong (New York, 1986), pp. 481-505.41. The fact that Lucian, in his Dialogue of Courtesans 4.6, uses the sameterm probably indicates that the phrase must have had a technical meaning.42. On the Mysteries of Egypt 3.14 (on charakteres) and 7.5 (on foreignnames). That lamblichus's theory of the power of foreign names was not limitedto theurgical circles is indicated by a comment of the Christian philosopherOrigen (ca. 250 C.E.), certainly no friend of \"magic,\" who observes in his AgainstCelsus that \"a man who pronounces a spell in its native language can bring aboutthe effect that the spell is claimed to do. But if the same spell is translated intoany other language whatever, it can be seen to be weak and ineffective\" (1.25).43. See in particular the work of J. L.

Theocritus (ca. 275 B.C.E.), in Idyll 2.28, records the feverish efforts ofSimaetha to win back her lover, Delphis. Her efforts amount to an elaborateritual, consisting of many separate actions and invocations. At one point sheexclaims, \"As I melt, with the goddess's help, this wax (probably a figurinerepresenting the faithless Delphis), so may Delphis of Myndus waste away atonce from love.\" Among other things, this text warns us not to read such actionsliterally, for if we were to find just the melted wax we might well suppose that itsintent was to destroy Delphis!75.

Such games were great festivals for all Greeks, andthey occurred only once every two or four years—in short, they wererelatively infrequent events and heavy with political, national, and reli-gious trappings. Originally created for wealthy aristocrat-citizens who42"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Competition in Theater and Circus  43competed as amateurs, the games took on an increasingly professionalcharacter so that by the second century B.C.E. the athletic competitorswere all professionals; the theatrical events were probably \"professional\"from the beginning.4 A list of prizes from Athens in the fifth century B.C.E.reveals the comprehensive character of these games—rhapsodists recit-ing Homer, singers with harp or flute, instrumentalists on harp or flute,athletes in various events (foot races, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, andthe pankration, a free-for-all that combined elements of boxing and wres-tling) for men and boys,5 equestrian events such as four- and two-horsechariot racing, various team competitions, and a regatta for ships.6 Com-plementing this cycle of biennial and quadrennial competitions were regu-lar dramatic festivals, such as the annual festival of Dionysus at Athens atwhich dramatists competed for the right to stage their plays,7 and otherpublic events at which poetry was recited and songs chanted. All of theseoccasions involved competition of one kind or another, usually amongchoruses of singers, dancers, reciters, and their leaders. As we shall see,the competitive nature of these occasions, which placed both employmentand status on the line, prompted the use of defixiones in order to hinderone's opponents and to enhance one's own chances of success. No less afigure than Augustine of Hippo, Christian bishop and former professor ofrhetoric, illustrates the long history of the ties between such competitionsand the use of curse spells. In his Confessions (4.2), written eight hundredyears after the earliest Greek tablets, he relates that \"once, when I haddecided to enter a competition for reciting theatrical verse, a sorcerer(haruspex) sent to inquire of me how much I would pay him to guarantee avictory.\"8In the period that concerns us here, the second century C.E. onward,Roman hegemony in the Mediterranean meant that distinctively Ro-man forms of entertainment, especially chariot racing and gladiatorialcontests, could be found everywhere, west and east. Unlike their Athe-nian counterparts, Romans enjoyed a calendar literally bursting withvarious forms of competition—festivals (feriae), games (ludi), andshows (munerd) of every kind and combination.9 By the year 300 C.E.there were 177 days of games, including 66 days of racing in the circus.To complete this list of public celebrations, we must finally take ac-count of the many lavish and lusty shows and gladiatorial contests,involving both men and wild animals, that occurred on a nonregularbasis several times a year, sometimes as part of the games and some-times separately.10What Greek and Roman performances shared was a keen sense ofcompetition, copious rewards, and enormous popularity. The number of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldactual competitors may have been limited, but the tally of those interestedin the events was enormous, encompassing the full spectrum of the socialorder from emperor to slave. For the winning performers the tangiblerewards were fame and fortune, while for the spectator-participant therewas the suspense over the results, exultation at the competition, and,depending on the outcome, delight in victory or despair at defeat.For all involved, much depended on the outcome, and competitorsand fans sought advantages wherever they could find them.11 Amongthese advantages was the use of defixiones, here understood quite liter-ally as an effort to bind one's competitors—their limbs, their sinews,their courage—through spells addressed to gods, spirits, and daimones.Curse tablets of this sort played a regular and persistent role in the life ofthe circus. The number of surviving examples is considerable; theirfindspots stretch right across the Roman world, including several exca-vated in and around hippodromes where they were originally depositedin accordance with prescribed procedures.12 Literary testimonies of vari-ous kinds support the picture sketched by the tablets themselves.13As for defixiones related to athletic competition among humans, all ofthe surviving tablets are relatively late and concern a variety of events:five from Athens in the third century C.E. are directed against profes-sional wrestlers in specific matches against named opponents (no. 3)14;one from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt a century later names a runner (no. 8).15But by far the greatest number of ^'athletic\" tablets, whose total nowexceeds eighty, concern chariot racing in circuses and hippodromes ofthe Roman world.16It would be difficult to overestimate the cultural significance of chariotracing in the Greco-Roman world. The earliest literary account appearsin Homer's Iliad (23.262ff.) in the lengthy account of the funeral games inhonor of the warrior-friend of Achilles, where it was the first event. Morethan a millennium and a half later, Byzantine civilization could still bedescribed, in the words of Norman Baynes, as honoring two heroes—theChristian holy man and the triumphant charioteer.17 Certainly Romanauthors, even when they professed dislike for this facet of Roman life,recognized and described it in telling detail. Late in the first century C.E. ,Tacitus speaks disparagingly of \"the peculiar vices found in our city, whichseem to be conceived already in the mother's womb—a partiality for thestage and a passion for gladiators and horse racing.\"18 Some three hun-dred years later, Ammianus Marcellinus mockingly depicts race fans whoargue that the state itself will fall unless their favored team is first from thestarting gates and negotiates the turns in proper fashion. For such, hewrites, \"their temple, their dwelling, their assembly, and the height of all"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Competition in Theater and Circus  45their hopes is the Circus Maximus.\"19 For winning drivers, the gain wasenormous fortune—Juvenal complains that the Red driver, Lacerta,earned one hundred times the fee of a lawyer.20 Betting was omnipresentand riots not infrequent. Emperors regularly proclaimed their loyalty tofavorite drivers, while powerful factions (Reds, Whites, Blues, Greens)organized the financial, technical, and professional side of the sport andspread eventually to every major city of the empire.21 In the sixth centuryC.E. , the historian Procopius could write that \"in every city the populationhas been divided for a long time into the Blue and Green factions.\"22 Vividaccounts of races survive in a youthful poem of Sidonius, later a Christianbishop in Gaul in the 470s, and in the epic poem entitled Dionysiaca byNonnus, a writer of the fifth or sixth century C.E. Such accounts make iteasy to understand the remarkable persistence of chariot racing into theChristian empire despite the resistance of figures like John of Ephesus(sixth century C.E.) who responded to the patriarch of Antioch's plan tobuild a hippodrome by labeling it \"the church of Satan.\"23 Indeed, it is aChristian writer, Cassiodorus, in the sixth century C.E., who provides anelaborate interpretation of the circus and its races as an astrological andastronomical symbol of the entire universe—the twenty-four races eachday are the twenty-four hours; the seven laps of each race are the days ofthe week; the twelve portals at the entrance are the signs of the zodiac; theturning posts are the tropics and so on.24For these reasons and more, curse tablets played a potent and abidingrole in the world of chariot racing.25 Whether commissioned and depos-ited by supporters26 or by the drivers themselves,27 they were a regularfeature of competition, with factions, fans, and charioteers seeking ad-vantage not just by tricks and skills on the course but by hampering theperformance of man and beast by defixiones.There is good reason to assume that everyone believed them to beeffective, even when they disapproved. How else to understand a prac-tice attested over such a stretch of time and geography? Certainly thelegal evidence points in this direction. For in the fourth century C.E., ahigh point in the construction of Roman circuses,28 Roman emperorsbegan to issue legal decrees specifically aimed at the notorious and well-attested connection between charioteers and the use of curses.29 A re-markable passage in Cassiodorus's edition of important documents writ-ten by him during his years as secretary to Theodoric illustrates severalfacets of this connection:King Theodoric to Faustus, Praetorian Prefect (of Rome}: Since constancyin actors is not a very common virtue, therefore with all the more pleasure"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worlddo we record the faithful allegiance of Thomas the Charioteer, who camehere long ago from the East, and who, having become champion chario-teer, has chosen to attach himself to the seat of our Empire; we thereforedecide that he shall be rewarded by a monthly allowance. He embracedwhat was then a losing side in the chariot races and carried it to victory—victory that he won so often that envious rivals declared that he conqueredby means of witchcraft. For they were driven to attribute his victories tomagic when they could not account for them by the strength of his horses.30\"The circus was indeed,\" in Alan Cameron's words, \"a microcosm ofthe Roman state.\"31 But it does not require \"a mystical turn of mind\"to see this, nor is the symbolism limited to the visible realm of socialand political life displayed explicitly in the emperor, senators, and soon \"down\" to slaves and children. The inconspicuous lead tablet, in-scribed, folded, and buried in the dust beneath the starting gates,symbolized the invisible world of Rome—a world of gods, spirits, anddaimones on the one side, of aspirations, tensions, and implicit poweron the other—in short, a world where emperors, senators, and bishopswere not in command.32Notes1.

On gladiatorial shows, see Balsdon, Leisure, pp. 288-313, and Hopkins,Death and Renewal, pp. 1-30.11. Faraone, \"Context,\" pp. 16-17, suggests that early Greek curses wereused in order to even up contests where the opponent seemed to have an unfairadvantage. The wide usage of curse tablets indicates that while \"evening up theodds\" may have been an occasional motive, perhaps even a rationalization, theirreal goal was to create an unfair advantage, to \"fix\" the outcome. At the sametime, it must be recalled that those who resorted to the use of defixiones did so inthe full knowledge that their opponents were up to the same tricks. Both alsoused defensive phylacteries and spells to guarantee victory.12. See now the discussion in D. R. Jordan, \"New Defixiones from Car-thage,\" in The Circus and a Byzantine Cemetery at Carthage, ed. J. H. Hum-phrey, vol. 1 (Ann Arbor, 1988), pp. 117-20.13. Faraone, \"Context,\" p. 20, observes that the first literary instance of acurse in athletic competition occurs in Pindar (fifth century B.C.E.), in his firstOlympian Ode (lines 76-78) where Pelops, the son of Tantalus, competes withOenomaos for the hand of his daughter, Hippodameia. In preparation for thisall-or-nothing battle with spears and chariots, Pelops prays for help to Poseidon:\"Block the bronze spear, and grant me the swifter chariot . . . and surround mewith power.\"14. The tandem of curses and wrestlers shows up again in later Christiansaints' lives. In one (Life of Saint George of Choziba), a professional wrestler isreleased from spells cast on him by his opponents only by becoming a monkhimself. In the other (Life of Saint Theodore of Sykeon), a wrestler unable tocompete because of pain in his body, is released from a demon, introduced nodoubt by a curse tablet. For a discussion of both texts, see H. J.

Greece, Athens (Patissia); original location not known. Lead tabletmeasuring 6x4 cm.; written on both sides; originally rolled up andpierced by a nail. The editor gives no date, but it can hardly be later thanthe second century B.C.E. No deity is invoked and the simple formula, \"Ibind!\" is used. The occasion is not clear; the only hint is that the primarytarget, Euandros, is twice identified as an actor. This label raises thepossibility that the tablet may have arisen out of rivalry between actors.The actor's son, Asteas, is also cited.

Greece, Athens; discovered in excavations of Roman wells in theAthenian Agora. Altogether some one hundred lead curse tablets havebeen recovered from the Agora, rolled up as scrolls. Jordan dates thisone to the mid-third century C.E. The tablet measures 13.9 x 11.5 cm.Jordan has described the writing as a \"skillful, elegant, fluent semi-cursive,\"6 as if produced by a professional scribe. The tablet involves acurse against a professional wrestler; several others are directed againstwrestlers and lovers. In a number of these, the same names and formulasreappear, indicating that they were copied, though not exactly, from thesame formulary in the scribe's possession.7 Another tablet in Jordan's col-lection (no. 6) is aimed at Alkidamos, a runner about to participate inthe athletic games of the city. That spell, presumably commissioned byone of Alkidamos's competitors, expresses the desire that he may notpass the starting line and that if he does he may veer off the course anddisgrace himself. The connection between binding spells and wrestlers ap-pears also in several Christian saints' lives.8 The deity invoked is the wide-spread Greco-Egyptian figure of Seth-Typhon. Bibl.: Jordan, \"Agora,\"no. 1, pp. 214-15.5. The language here is suggestive of cases in which defixlones were accompanied by figu-rines of the intended victim, frequently with bound hands and feet. Yet the phrase may simplyrefer to the binding action of the tablet itself.6. Jordan, \"Agora,\" p. 210.7. Jordan, \"Agora,\" pp. 236-40, has produced a synoptic version of ten different curses,which reveals their basic similarities, together with minor differences.8. H. J. Magoulias relates two incidents involving professional wrestlers who found them-selves suddenly unable to compete, presumably because they had come under spells like thoseillustrated here; they were cured only by resorting to saints who required them to give up theircareers as athletes; see Magoulias, \"The Lives of Byzantine Saints as Sources of Data for theHistory of Magic in the Sixth and Seventh Centuries A.D.: Sorcery, Relics and Icons,\"Byzantion 37 (1967): 245-46."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Competition in Theater and Circus  51*B6RPHORBABARBORBABARPHORBABORBORBAIE, powerful BEIRUT9 I deliver toyou Eutuchianos, to whom Eutuchia gave birth, that you may chill him andhis resolve,10 and in your gloomy air also those who are with him.

Thewriting on both the left and right margins has been eroded. Audollentdates it in the third century C.E. This fragmentary tablet, first interpretedby Audollent as dealing with circus factions, has since been identified byGanszyniec and Louis Robert as referring to factions of pantomimes.DT16 is very similar and targets Hyperechios the actor, binding variousparts of his body necessary for successful performance. Another tabletrelating to the rivalry of pantomime actors comes from Gaul (see no.16). The immediacy of this spell is striking, as the event is referred to astaking place \"tomorrow.\" The confused language suggests that the in-scriber clumsily copied the curse from a formulary. The original publica-tion included neither a photograph nor a drawing; located today in theLouvre, it is not available for inspection. There is thus every reason to9. Not otherwise attested, but probably one of Seth-Typhon's secret names.10. The Greek term is gnome; its closest modern analogue might be \"spirit.\"11. Here there is an obvious symbolic connection between the cool and dark character of thewell where the tablets were deposited, the subterranean deities invoked to carry out the curse,and the desired effects on Eutychian. Jordan notes that the use of the verb katapsucho occursregularly in curses associated with Seth-Typhon. Whether \"the gloomy air\" and \"the unlit realm\"refer to two different subterranean zones, or to this world (so Jordan) as opposed to theunderworld, is not clear.12. Jordan suggests a place name where the bouts would be staged.13. These words occur on each of the ten tablets edited by Jordan, with slight variations fromone version to the next.14. Part of the secret name of Seth-Typhon.15. Seth-Typhon, the great deity of magical texts; a highly syncretized figure, with accretionsfrom many sources.16.

Eitrem, \"Die sustasis und der Lichtzauber in der Magie,\" SymbolaeOsloenses 8 (1929): 49-51.19. The Greek words apopompai edei apotropai refer to rituals performed for the targetedvictim's sake. The words might also refer to phylacteries and apotropaic amulets. In either case,our tablet seeks to neutralize any rituals that the target, Huperechios, may have undertaken onhis own behalf.20. The verbs are lud and analuo; an instance of the tendency to repeat a simple verb with itscompound, which has a similar meaning, e.g., \"bind\" and \"bind together\" (deo and sundeo) and\"turn\" and \"overturn\" (strepho and katastrepho).21. The name of the targeted victim. It is spelled with slight variations throughout this text.22. Audollent reads the word as remmachchos, an otherwise unattested Greek word.

However, Maricq(pp. 364-68), following Robert, argues that it should be read emmallos, an adjective designatingpantomime roles in the early Byzantine period; for example, a chrusomallos was a gold-wiggedactor, a karamallos a black-wigged one.

The figures invoked are \"holy angels,\" referred to by theirmysterious names. The spell is directed against a long list of horses anddrivers of the Blue faction. Directly under the title and between twocolumns of mysterious names at the top there appears a bound humanfigure seemingly under attack by a second, incomplete figure (probablya snake), showing only a head and an open mouth (Figure 6). Accordingto Mouterde, the small circles on the body and the protrusions from thehead represent nails, symbolizing the binding process.32 Bibl.: R.Mouterde, \"Le glaive de Dardanos,\" Melanges de I'Universite Saint Jo-seph 15 (1930-1931): 106-23; SEG 7.213; A.

Audollent reads ton aposion (\"unholy things\"), which makes no sense; Jordan proposesinstead tonpodon (\"feet\").31. Reading the Greek word here as oudon for ouron.32. The so-called Sethian tablets from Rome offer a number of close parallels; cf. esp. no. 11in Wiinsch, with a figure bound by straps or bands, three nails emerging from the head, and asnake underneath.

The setting of the spell is chariot racing in thehippodrome of Apamea. Intense rivalry between the major teams orfactions, the Blues and the Greens, is known from a passage from thesixth-century historian, Procopius (Wars 2.11.31-35). On a \"visit\" toApamea, the Persian general Chosroes issued orders for a special seriesof races in the hippodrome of the city. Knowing that the Roman em-peror Justinian favored the Blues, Chosroes decided to support theGreens. When the Blues took an early lead, Chosroes commanded hisagents to slow down the Blue team in order to guarantee a Greenvictory.

J.-C.),\" Apamee de Syrie (Brussels,1984), pp. 213-34; SEG 34.1437; SGD, p. 192.Most holy Lord Charakteres/1 tie up, bind the feet, the hands, the sinews, theeyes, the knees, the courage, the leaps, the whip (?),42 the victory and thecrowning of Porphuras43 and Hapsicrates, who are in the middle left, as wellas his codrivers of the Blue colors in the stable of Eugenius.44 From this veryhour, from today, may they not eat or drink or sleep45; instead, from the(starting) gates may they see daimones (of those) who have died prematurely,41. We must suppose a close connection between the signs on the first two lines of the tablet,above the text, and their use here. The signs embodied the higher powers invoked to carry outthe spell. What exactly these powers were thought to be is not clear, although the papyri make itclear that all superior beings were believed to possess their own characters or signs as empow-ered signatures. As symbols of higher power, they are addressed here as \"Lords, most holy.\"Elsewhere, they are called \"divine\" (theioi; see pp. 000-000) and \"terrifying\" (phoberoi; see pp.000-000). The presence of exactly thirty-six signs on the two tablets from Apamea leads vanRengen to argue that the connection or association here may be with the thirty-six decans ordivisions of the heavens common in Egyptian astrology. Elsewhere, the charakteres are associ-ated with the protective powers and functions of angels and archangels. In this tablet, there maywell be a tie between archangels and decans, with the former understood as in charge of thelatter.42. The text reads taura, a word otherwise unattested. The editor suggests a miswriting fortaurialtaureia, \"whip.\" The whip was, of course, the most important instrument for charioteersand appears frequently in drawings of charioteers in ancient art.43. Binding spells from hippodromes regularly give the names of horses and drivers, some-times both. The question as to who these two names are meant to designate—horses and/ordrivers—depends in part on the rare word \"in the middle left\" (mesaristeros) that follows. In theBook of Ceremonies of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (ca. 940 C.E.), the word appears todesignate the favored starting position: \"Once the jar has been turned, the ball that comes out(first) designates which one will occupy the position in the middle left (mesaristeron).\" On theother hand, as van Rengen notes, the term might also have been used to specify the lead horse inthe team of four. Porphyras is a late form of Porphyrius, a common name for horses and jockeys.The most famous jockey of this name was a professional who enjoyed phenomenal success in themid-sixth century and received numerous public honors; cf. A. Cameron, Porphyrius the Chario-teer (Oxford, 1973).44. The Eugenius named here in connection with the stablon (a Latin word taken intoGreek) is no doubt the factionarius or professional manager, later the leading jockey, of a team;on the term and its development, see Alan Cameron, Circus Factions: Blues and Greens at Romeand Byzantion (Oxford, 1976), pp. 5-13.45. In this case, the client's wish is that the spell begin immediately, not just at the time of therace. Thus, the horses are marked for trouble not just during the race but for unfavorableconditions beforehand. Similar commands to prevent eating, drinking, and sleeping show up inlove spells (see PGM IV, lines 354ff.)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"58 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldspirits (of those) who have died violently,46 and the fire of Hephaestus47 . . .in the hippodrome at the moment when they are about to compete48 may theynot squeeze over,49 may they not collide,50 may they not extend,51 may theynot force (us) out, may they not overtake, may they not break off (in a newdirection?)52 for the entire day when they are about to race. May they bebroken, may they be dragged (on the ground), may they be destroyed; byTopos53 and by Zablas.54 Now, now, quickly, quickly!46. The start was the critical moment of the race and thus the subject of particular anxiety.Other spells specify a bad start as their goal. In this case, the designated technique takes the formof causing the horses to see the terrifying daimones of those who had died prematurely or byviolence.47. Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and the foundry. Here he appears in his familiar roleas the first Greek \"magician,\" though his name appears in just one other surviving magical text(PGM XII, lines 177-78). The point is clear: the horses are to see the fire of Hephaestus as theyleave the starting gates and thus be frightened into a bad race. On Hephaestus, see M. Delcourt,Hephaistos ou la legende du magicien (Paris, 1957).48. The following series of verbs is not merely repetitive. It lists the various techniques ortricks used by charioteers to gain an advantage over their competitors. There is a close parallel inDT187 (Rome): \"May they not get a good start, may they not pass.\".49. The editor is not certain how to read the Greek at this point and offers two possibilities,chiazein or piazein/piezein. The first would indicate a maneuver of crossing or zigzagging fromlane to lane; the second would signify much the same thing—pressing across into another lane.The effect of either action would be the same, to cut off the path of one's competitors by forcingthem out of their lanes.50. The verb parabuzein here means to force one's own chariot, from an outside passingposition, into the chariot and the horses of one's competitor so as to overturn them and put themout of the race. The technique is described by the poet Nonnus (fifth or sixth century C.E.) in hisThe Story of Dionysus 37.35Iff.: Actaeon (one of the drivers) caught up and passed from theoutside; he then swerved to the inside, touching his rival's chariot and scraping its horse's legswith his own wheel. The chariot overturned and three of the four horses, along with the driver,stumbled and fell.51. The Greek is tathosi(n) from teino (\"to strain, exert, stretch\"). The meaning here seemsto be \"to stretch,\" \"to strain,\" or \"to exert oneself to the fullest.\"52. The verb periklan might mean either to break away or to make the sharp turns aroundthe two end posts of the course. Other spells from the world of racing use various forms of thesame verb in a \"positive\" meaning—to wish that their competitor's chariots will break apart; cf.DT 187 and in our tablet, line 12.53. The phrase kata topo(n) and the following phrase kata Zablan are unusual and somewhatpuzzling. The sense seems to be that the figures are here invoked as the divine agents throughwhose authority (kata) the charakteres are to carry out the spell. Topos (\"the place\") as a divinename occurs frequently in Jewish texts, translating Hebrew maqom, commonly used to designatethe deity (e.g., Philo, Dreams 1.63). The same term appears in Valentinian Gnostic texts whereit designates the demiurge or creator-god (cf. Clement of Alexandria, Excerpts of Theodotus 34,37-39). And in the Hermetic Tractate 2.12 (from Egypt and dating to the same period as thecurse tablets), topos is described as \"that in which everything moves ... the incorporeal ... amind that contains its own self entirely, free from any form of bodily nature, unerring, aboveemotion, intangible, immutable in itself, containing all things and redeeming all things . . . fromwhich the good, the truth and fountainhead of what is spiritual emanate like rays.\" Thus, whiletopos appears in no other binding spell, it certainly falls within the range of those powerfulspiritual beings that could be useful in circumstances like these.54. The only other known occurrence of Zablas/Sablas is in a Coptic amulet from around 600C.E. (Kropp, vol. 1, text F, line 37). It appears in a list of the seven angels who assisted God in the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Competition in Theater and Circus  597. Egypt, from the Jewish collection of spells and recipes, Sepher ha-Razim (see p. 106).5S Properly speaking, the recipe is not for a cursetablet directed against other competitors but a spell to guarantee victoryfor oneself by forcing horses to run even when they are tired. A similarrecipe for producing metal tablets guaranteed to \"fix\" horse races—butcertified in addition as useful in producing dreams and generatinghatred—appears in PGM III, lines 15-30.If you wish to race horses, (even) when they are exhausted, so that they willnot stumble in their running, that they will be swift as the wind, and that thefoot of no living thing will pass them, take a silver lamella and write upon itthe names of the horses and the names of the angels and the name of theprince who is over them and say:I adjure you angels of running, who run amid the stars, that you will girdwith strength and courage the horses that N is racing and his charioteerwho is racing them. Let them run and not become weary nor stumble. Letthem run and be swift as an eagle. Let no animals stand before them, andlet no other magic or witchcraft affect them.Take the lamella and conceal it in the racing lane (of the one) you wish to win.8. Egypt, Oxyrhynchus; exact origin not known. Lead tablet measuring8 x 13 cm. and originally rolled up. Dated to the fourth century C.E. Thetablet is poorly preserved. The spirit invoked at the beginning is ad-dressed by the familiar name EULAMO. The only other legible name isalso known from similar tablets—CHUCH BAZACHUCH. The occasion iscompetition between athletes, in this case runners. In addition to thecreation of Adam; the theme of angelic cooperation in the act of creation is a common one inJewish and Christian texts of this period. This helps us to understand the connection betweentopos, taken as referring to the biblical god, and Zablas, an angel. What about their connectionto the charakteres, depicted in the first two lines above the text and invoked in the first line of thetext? As van Rengen observes, angels and archangels were thought to command and control notonly spirits and demons generally, but the thirty-six decans specifically—that is, the thirty-sixequally divided portions, also known as world rulers, of the heavenly sphere or zodiac accordingto Egyptian astrological tradition. And the thirty-six charakteres of the first two lines of our textalmost certainly represent the thirty-six astrological decans; see the convincing argument of vanRengen, pp. 216-19. Furthermore, in The Testament of Solomon, the thirty-six decans aresummoned to appear before Solomon, where they announce their names, their powers, and theparticular angel to whom they are subjugated: \"I am the first decan of the zodiac and I am calledRuax. I cause the head of men to suffer pain and I cause their temples to throb. But if I evenhear, 'Michael, imprison Ruax,' I retreat immediately\" (18:5). Unfortunately, none of the thirty-six decans summoned before Solomon specialized in chariot racing and none is named Zablas.But it is evident that there was great variability in the names and functions of spirits from onetext to another. In short, there is a close connection in our tablet between the charakteressummoned to carry out the spell, and topos and Zablan, under whose power and authority theystand.55.

Five are written in Latin, the rest in Greek. Thelanguage is highly formulaic and unsophisticated. The editor was able todate the tablets confidently to the end of the fourth century C.E., duringthe reigns of the Christian emperors Theodosius I and Honorius. Thefigures addressed in the spells are typically eclectic, reflecting both bibli-cal influences (angels and archangels) from the predominantly Christianenvironment in Rome as well as names and titles drawn from pagantraditions, which were apparently still alive and circulating. No singlefigure predominates.84 It is important to note that as with all tablets82. Here begins a series of references to the Hebrew Bible, probably reflecting the use of anoriginally Jewish formula. The phrase \"above the heaven\" derives from passages like Isaiah 14:13(\"above the stars of heaven I will place my throne\"); for \"above the Cherubim,\" see the samewords in Psalm 79:2: \"Who is seated above the Cherubim.\" The dividing (diorisas) of the landand the sea refers to Genesis l:7ff., where God separated (chorisas) the waters and divided thedry land from the sea, just as here. Of course, the professional who prepared this tablet probablyknew none of this and simply treated the phrases and terms as traditional words of power.83. The term SABA6 is written directly above ADONAI.84. The original editor, Richard Wiinsch, labeled all of the tablets as Sethian and regardedthem as being under the influence of a known group of Christian Gnostics, called Sethians by theiropponents in early Christian literature. Wiinsch wrote during a period of pan-Gnostic interpreta-tion, when everything unusual in the world of Greco-Roman culture was attributed to Gnostic in-fluence. Wiinsch's interpretation was widely criticized and is no longer accepted; cf. Preisendanz,pp. 23-37, and Moraux, Defixion judicial™, p. 19, n. 3. Wiinsch's edition of the texts and hiscommentary on them are still invaluable. I know of no other translation of these texts."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worlddeposited in tombs or graves, the immediate agent of this spell was thespirit of the dead person in whose tomb the tablet was placed. Of particu-lar interest is the fact that most of the tablets include drawings, usuallyof human figures portrayed in bonds and surrounded by a serpent aboutto bite or of horse heads85 (Figures 9, 10).86 The setting for these tabletsis clear—competition among racers and charioteers in Rome. Socially,these tablets and their purchasers fall into the class of freedmen87 andslaves. Their names are a mix of Greek and Latin and are regularlyidentified by maternal lineage; several are also given nicknames. Bibl.:R. Wiinsch, Sethianische Verfluchungstafeln aus Rom (Leipzig, 1898),85. These horse heads were central to Wiinsch's argument for the Sethian Gnostic origin ofthe tablets, for he took them to be representations of the Egyptian god Seth, who was frequentlyportrayed with the head, not of a horse but of a donkey. More plausible is Preisendanz's viewthat these equine shapes depict horse-headed spirits (daimones), revered and feared as thepresiding powers of amphitheaters and racing. Just such a horse-spirit is referred to in the PistisSophia (chap. 145), a Christian Gnostic document of the third century C.E., in connection withfuture punishments of murderers: \"(Jesus is speaking) ... a murderer will be bound by his feetto a great daimon with the face of a horse.\" Other elements in this chapter of Pistis Sophia areworth noting: the spirits will punish the murderer by whipping him; and various spirits willpunish (timorein; a variant of the same verb is used in our text) the murderer. One should alsoconsider, given the fact that the horse figures appear alongside human figures who clearlyrepresent images of the human targets of the spell, the possibility that the horse figures may alsooffer a visual embodiment of the target's horses, who are also named and cursed in the spells.86. Preisendanz describes the design as follows, based on his assumption that the figuresshould be interpreted in close connection with the accompanying text: (1) the central figure is ahorse-spirit (daimon), holding a whip in one hand, symbolizing both power and the charioteers'whip, and a circular object (hoop or disk?) in the other, symbolizing the wheels of the chariot;the design under the horse's left foot represents the yoke or chassis of the chariot; (2) the twofigures just below the arms of the horse figure are theparedroi mentioned in the text as being onthe right and the left; (3) the figure in the upper left is Osiris in his coffin (done in, according tolegend, by Seth); the cross marks on his body, on the coffin, on the two paredroi, and on otherfigures are all symbols of binding; in addition, the lines emerging from Oriris's head and from thecoffin, and the dots on the coffin depict the nails and pins that were a common feature of bindingspells; the same figure shows up in nos. 20B and 29; Richard Lim makes the appealing suggestionthat the figure in the coffin might better be taken as the human target of the defixio, depicted asdead and buried; (4) the charakteres, the vowel figures and the letter formations based onEULAMO are associated with the spirits/daimones as indications of their cosmic power; (5) themummy figure at the bottom, surrounded by two biting snakes and crisscrossed by lines, is thehuman target of the spell, dead and buried in accordance with the desires of the client; no. 49,line 54 in Wiinsch's collection may contain a reference to the biting snake where the verbakontizein, meaning \"to wound\" or \"to dart,\" may indicate the action of the snake; the starcharakter, which appears under the feet of the mummy, Preisendanz takes to be a symbol of thenails and pins used in binding. Given the frequent occurrence of this symbol in many otherdefixiones, Wiinsch is probably closer to the truth in arguing that it represents Osiris or the sun.In line with his general principle of locating correlations between the texts and the designs,Preisendanz offers the view that the one figure not mentioned in the text, the snake, is probablyto be identified with Eulamo to whom is addressed the command, \"Restrain!\" The designs onanother tablet, no. 20B, are virtually identical to those of our tablet, with but one exception—20B shows several bound figures rather than the single one of no. 16.87.

This series of \"words,\" which reappears several times in the spell, contains crypticremains of names of Egyptian deities: OUSIRI is Osiris; MNE is Mnevis, the bull worshiped atHeliopolis; AP(H)I is Apis, the bull worshiped at Memphis; PHRI might be derived from Ra, thesun god of Egypt, whose name was pronounced P(h)re in the early Hellenistic period.89. The phrase to katachthonio appears here and below. The reference is almost certainly tothe spirit of the dead person in the grave, at the door of the underworld.90. The target of the spell is thus Cardelus, a well-attested Latin name. His mother wasFulgentia, similarly well attested as a name.91. This phrase is difficult. The Greek word krab(b)aton is not widely used, but appears todesignate a bed or a couch. Thus kata krabaton must mean something like \"while in bed\" or\"while lying down.\" Wiinsch (p. 100) proposes to interpret the phrase with reference to theladderlike figures on several tablets, which he takes to be instruments of torture. Thus the phrasehere would mean that the target should suffer torments on a bed of torture.92. Another instance where the scribe mistakenly copied instructions from the formulary,rather than beginning with the following text.93. Preisendanz (Akephalos. Der kopflose Gott [Leipzig, 1926], p. 32) proposes a differentinterpretation. He takes the Greek dee as a transliteration of a Latin plural, deae (\"goddesses\")and Phrugia not as a reference to the well-known \"Phrygian goddess\" but to local spirits namedPhrygia because they caused people to \"dry out\" (phrugios).94. This translation is based on Preisendanz, who takes the second dee as a Latin plural fordeae. The Nymphs thus represent the water-spirits of wells where defixiones were customarilydeposited. Jordan (SGD, p. 167) reports an unpublished deftxio from a pool or bathhouse inCorinth, which is addressed to \"holy and powerful nymphs.\"95. At the same point in the spell other texts read ADONAI, one of the names for the god ofthe Hebrew Bible. EIDONEA here is probably a garbled version of ADONAI. Alternatively, it mightbe taken as an epithet of Hekate, aiddnaia (\"infernal\"); cf. PGM IV, line 2855.96. Wiinsch takes these letters as mysterious invocations. Preisendanz (Akephalos), citingparallels in other tablets (esp. no. 19, line 6ff.) from the same find, argues that they are in fact agarbled version of the phrase, en chord katoikousai, \"who live in this place.\"97. The Greek term here is paredroi, used in the papyri of the spirits or daimones whoattended and assisted magoi in the course of their activities.98. Wiinsch relates Symphonia to a book by the same name attributed by the Christianauthor, Epiphanius, to the Sethian Gnostics. Preisendanz (Akephalos, pp. 34ff.) insists that theword, which he reads as sumphona rather than sumphonia, refers clearly to the \"box\" of vowels,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Competition in Theater and Circus  71[taken from a water conduit]—EULAM6N restrain OUSIRI OUSIRI API OUSIRI MNEPHRI—in order that just as I hand over to you this impious, accursed, andmiserable Kardelos, to whom his mother Pholgentia gave birth, bound, fullybound, and altogether bound, in order that you may in the same way restrainhim—Kardelos to whom his mother Pholgentia gave birth—and make himbedridden and (make him) suffer the penalty of an evil death and expire withinfive days—Kardelos to whom his mother Pholgentia gave birth.

The Greek is typical of the Doricdialect found in the Greek colonies of Sicily and closely resembles that ofthe \"Great Defixio\" from Selinus (see pp. 139-41).

The person who commissioned or inscribed the tablet speaksin the first person (\"I curse\") but the binding is intended to favor his friendEunikos.

Clearly some form of public competition lies in the foreground. Such competitionsinvolved either lyric choruses for poetic recitation or full dramatic productions. In either case,the selection and training of a chorus would have been at stake. Miller (pp. 83-85) lists a numberof famous poets and dramatists (including Aeschylus) who visited Sicily and staged publicperformances there. These occasions must have required public competitions and no doubtgenerated sharp rivalries.131. This is close to a translation proposed by Miller in her discussion but not included in thetranslation proper. Her reasoning is that while this version makes better sense of the words, itraises problems of interpretation, namely, the other choregoi might have known about thedefixio and the literary contest might thus have been subject to \"forcible persuasion or even,perhaps, sabotage\" (p. 89). But as we have argued, we have no choice but to assume somedegree of public knowledge concerning such efforts. Furthermore, what is a defixio if not anattempt to change things by force, persuasion, and sabotage?132. This phrase raises the possibility that some chorus leaders may have come, as did thedramatists and poets themselves, from the outside, thus further intensifying the sense of competi-tion and rivalry.133.

Thusit should come as no great surprise to discover that roughly one-quarterof all surviving tablets concern \"matters of the heart.\"1 While the pre-served specimens—whether as recipes in the handbooks used by profes-sional magoi or the tablets themselves—emerge rather late in the story(the earliest erotic tablet dates to the fourth century B.C.E., the closeassociation between eros and the use of spells surfaces already in theearliest literary products of the Greek world, the Iliad and the Odyssey.2Indeed, given the fundamentally oral character of even the writtenspells, it is probably not too much to speculate that the marriage of erosand spells considerably antedates even the Homeric epics.In book 14 of the Iliad (216ff.), Zeus's wife Hera borrows Aphrodite'sembroidered girdle, \"in which all her power resides, Love and Desireand the sweet bewitching words that turn a wise man into a fool.\" Butwhom does Hera wish to seduce? Her own husband, the father of menand gods! And it worked, tucked away in her bosom like many a latercharm, for Zeus responds to her with unaccustomed ardor, overcome bypassion and the forgetfulness of sleep. Similar procedures, no doubtmuch older than the epic itself, appear in book 1 of the Odyssey, wherethe more-than-human Calypso resorts to charms and spells in her unsuc-cessful effort to have Odysseus forget his native Ithaca and his wifePenelope in favor of remaining forever with her. Here again there issomething odd about the circumstances.

Orperhaps male authors are no more reluctant to project their own fanta-sies and anxieties onto female deities than onto female humans.However that may be, we cannot miss certain continuities betweenthe early literary occurrences of \"love\" spells and later defixiones3:(1) In Homer, Theocritus (Idyll 2 concerning Simaetha's efforts toregain the affections of her departed lover),4 and Lucian of Samosata(see pp. 255-56), it is primarily women who resort to ritual means inorder to charm the targets of their passion. Although in the later recipesand tablets men sometimes take the initiative in these affairs, it is worthnoting that a number of women seized the opportunity to commissioncharms and spells. Here, then, we find one arena of ancient life wherewomen were not only active participants in shaping their private livesbut initiators of action in the public realm.(2) The means employed—verbal spells and ritual instruments of vari-ous sorts—no doubt varied according to time and place, but we neverfail to find both spells and instruments, usually together. This is not tosay that defixiones as such, in which oral spells are recorded on strips ofmetal, predated Homer; it may very well be that the particular tech-nique of using defixiones, attested much earlier in nonerotic affairs, wasadopted by nervous lovers on the basis of its reputation as a successfuldevice in constraining the behavior of other persons, most notably inlegal matters. Indeed, one common element in all binding spells is con-straint, through the deployment of powerful formulas, names, figures,and other materials, for the purpose of bending the actions and senti-ments of others according to one's own desires. Thus an eventual trans-fer of defixiones to the realm of sex and love, if this is how thingsdeveloped, must have happened quite naturally. Faraone suggests thatlegal defixiones were first \"converted\" into separation love spells, pri-marily in Greece, and only later made the further transition to attractionlove spells.5(3) Loss of memory plays an important role throughout—in legaldefixiones as well—no doubt because memory was seen as the locus ofsocial ties and obligations that interfered with erotic relationships (realor fancied) of one kind or another.6 Just as Calypso seeks to eraseOdysseus's memory of Ithaca and Penelope, so love tablets regularlyinsist that the object of the client's passion should forget all others.The traditional label for these tablets as \"love spells\" gives a seriouslymisleading impression of the various types that appear even in the lim-ited sample provided in this chapter. Faraone's basic division into separa-tion spells, usually involving triangular relationships of one kind or an-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldother, and attraction spells, designed to charm a second party, has beensubdivided further.7 Within the first category, Petropoulos distinguishesbetween attraction spells (agogai) and binding tablets (philtrokatades-moi).P Winkler offers spells to curse rivals, to divorce or separate cou-ples, to cause a downturn in a pimp's business, and to attract a lover.9Further subdivisions are no doubt possible. Our interest, however, is notto formulate a set of categories but to underline the complexity of typesand circumstances, corresponding no doubt to the illuminating variety ofneeds and fantasies experienced by the love-struck clients themselves.We have already noted the prominence given in literary texts towomen as initiators of amatory spells and devices. In other areas involv-ing literary representations of women as witches and purveyors of spells,there is good reason to believe that the literary tradition has projected asystematic distortion. Yet in this one area, relating to women's use oferotic defixiones, the literary testimony finds at least partial confirma-tion in the tablets and recipes. Winkler asserts that these texts \"arepredominantly composed by (or on behalf of) men in pursuit ofwomen,\"10 but he also observes that a number fall into rather differentgroupings:1. women in pursuit of men: PGM XV, XVI, XlXb, XXXIX; DT100, 230; and no. 18 in this volume;2. women in pursuit of women: PGM XXXII; SGD !5l=SuppMag42\";3. men in pursuit of men: PGM XXXIIa; and our no. 25(?)12;4. recipes to deliver men or women; PGM I, line 98; IV, line 2089;and our no. 31.In short, the professional dispensers of erotic charms were prepared toserve all possible clients and relationships.13The tablets and recipes paint a rather intimate portrait—to be sure inthe formulaic language of ritual—of the sexual appetites, anxieties, andfantasies of ancient men and women. As such, they offer a welcomeantidote to the skewed, largely masculine perspective of the literarytradition. Basing his observations on recent studies of Mediterraneanculture in general, Winkler asserts that women in love \"are considerablymore watched and guarded and disciplined than their brothers, andpresumably had less access to male experts with their books and tomoney for hiring them.\"14 Yet, even more than Winkler seems preparedto admit, both the tablets and literary figures such as Lucian demon-strate that women resorted to precisely the same ceremonies, spells, anddevices as did men. Thus it is not too much to insist that it is precisely"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Sex, Love, and Marriage  81through defixiones that women emerge from their stereotyped seclusionand passivity in aggressive pursuit of their own erotic dreams.There can be no mistaking the deeply aggressive, even violent lan-guage of the amatory defixiones. Various tablets specify that the objectof passion is to be dragged by the hair, deprived of memory and sleep,tormented by passion, and killed with madness. In another case (no.27), a female figurine has survived, pierced with thirteen needles.15 Yetthese items are clearly not curses in any shape or manner. Their explicitgoal is not to harm the target but to constrain her. How are we tointerpret the vivid language of these spells, not just in its aggressiveforms but equally in its undisguised sexuality (\"join belly to belly, thighto thigh, black to black,\" \"bring her thigh close to his, her genitals closeto his in unending intercourse for all the time of her life\")?Several responses seem in order:(1) In part, the violent language may be explained by the developmen-tal history of defixiones. If, as suggested earlier, the deployment ofbinding spells in erotic affairs was taken over from the legal and judicialrealm, where hostile techniques and formulas for harming and bindingone's enemies were quite \"appropriate,\" then it seems likely that theaggressive language simply came along with the transfer.(2) We must exercise care not to misread a \"document\" like the figu-rine with needles. The spoken words that accompany the insertion of theneedles are not \"I harm you!\" or \"I wound you!\" but \"I pierce whateverpart of you so that you will remember me!\" In short, like much else inthis and similar texts, the language is deeply symbolic and will simply notallow an overly literal interpretation. The closest modern analogy forunderstanding these needles is thus not the so-called \"voodoo\" dolls,from Haiti and elsewhere but instead the therapeutic use of needles inChinese acupuncture. To this we must add a single caveat: the figurine isgender-specific. The penetration of the female figurine by needles proba-bly carries sexual meaning as well.(3) In his analysis of intense desire as a form of illness in Greekculture, requiring treatment, Winkler has indicated yet another impor-tant feature of love spells, namely, their therapeutic function.16 Througha dual process of transference and projection, the spell reverses theactual emotional state of the two parties and thereby accomplishes adouble goal—the illness is removed from the client by its projectiononto the target; the target is thus made, in some fashion, to conform tothe client's desires: \"The rite assigns the role of calm and masterfulcontrol to the performer and imagines the victim's scene as one of pas-sionate inner torment. But if we think about the reality of the situation,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldthe intended victim is in all likelihood sleeping peacefully, blissfullyignorant of what some lovestruck lunatic is doing on his roof.\"17 In short,the \"real\" target of the spells is the disease, the inflamed passion of theclient, whereas the spell, or rather the series of actions leading up to itsprocurement, functions as a cure by projecting the passion onto theother.18(4) In his trenchant critique of Frazer's Golden Bough, Ludwig Witt-genstein reversed Frazer's understanding of ritual action by interpretingit as directed toward effecting a change not in the external world ofnature but in the internal world of the actor. \"Burning in effigy. Kissingthe picture of the loved one. This is obviously not based on a belief thatit will have a definite effect on the object which the picture represents. Itaims at some satisfaction and it achieves it. Or rather, it does not aim atanything; we act in this way and then feel satisfied.\"19 In other terms, theerotic defixiones—and the other types as well—deal primarily with theinner world of the client's fantasy and imagination. Their goals arelargely realized in the very act of commissioning and depositing thetablets.20 Once again, it would be a serious error to read them in anoverly literal fashion. It may not be too much to propose that thechthonic powers to whom the tablet is dedicated represent the client'ssense of domination by psychological forces beyond his or her control;the violent language expresses the turbulence of the erotic passion; andthe desire to dominate the target manifests an effort to regain control ofoneself.21These considerations cast in a new light one of the central assumptionsin virtually all traditional views of defixiones, their exclusively privateand secret character. Indeed, the position of Frazer and his successors,which has commanded all interpretations of \"magical\" action—the posi-tion that all \"magic\" can be written off as nothing more than a series ofmistaken beliefs about the world, leading to ineffectual efforts to controlthe natural order according to one's own desires—depends heavily onthe claim that such activity is always isolated, private, and secret. Buthere and there in the ancient record, there are signs that the act ofcommissioning and deploying a defixio formed part of a broader ama-tory strategy, some of whose aspects were public. In brief, the intendedtarget of the spell was almost certainly aware that someone had commis-sioned and deposited an erotic tablet because she or he was already theobject of that person's attention. When Simaetha, in Theocritus's Idyll 2(ca. 240 B.C.E.), intones her binding spell over her ritual apparatus(iunx)—\"Draw my lover to my house, oh powerful iunx!\"—she doesnot leave the matter there but adds, \"And tomorrow I will go myself to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Sex, Love, and Marriage  83Timogetus's wrestling school to scold him for the way he has treatedme.\" Similarly, more than six centuries later, Eunapius records an inci-dent of erotic spell and counterspell involving the \"divine philosopher\"Sosipatra and her love-sick relative, Philometor.22 He, overpowered byeras, had undertaken certain rituals—perhaps including the commission-ing of a defixio—that had taken effect. The philosopher, afflicted butunaware of the source, pleads with a confidant, the well-known theurgistMaximus, to discover the cause of her ailment and to cure her. Maxi-mus, having discovered Philometor's strategy, unleashed a powerful anti-dote, which brought the affair to an end. Apart from its value as testi-mony for the use of spells and antidotes in high places, the immediaterelevance of the story is that if Philometor's amorous assault onSosipatra has been an entirely private affair, Maximus, despite his re-nown as a theurgist, would not have discovered Philometor's plot.Finally, we need to ask what these spells and tablets have to do withlove—romantic style—for their traditional label has been \"love spells.\"In some cases, as Winkler observes, \"love\" is not the right word.23 Sometablets fall into the category of affairs or flings; others involve nothingmore than fantasies. But a few do point to something like modern no-tions of romantic love, marriage, conjugal fidelity, and honor. Domi-tiana (no. 36) pleads to be united with Urbanus in marriage and love forthe rest of their days.24 In other cases, the issue is given a reverse spin inthe sense that jealous spouses or lovers intervene with the spirits tobreak up an affair and induce the wandering partner to return to a stableand exclusive relationship. Here we must take note that prostitutes andconcubines appear to have played a role in a number of cases (nos. 18,21) in which a wife resorted to extraordinary measures in order to termi-nate her husband's involvement with a concubine (hetaira).25 Such rela-tionships were quite common throughout the ancient world and occasion-ally took the form of moving the hetaira into the husband's household.The tablets indicate that wives did not always approve. No doubt theconcubines themselves made use of amatory charms, or were suspectedof doing so, to win the affections of married men.26Notes1.

Until recently, we had only themodels and few copies.39 Now we have several examples of a single,richly complex love spell based on a recipe, or variants of it, preserved inPGM IV, lines 296-466: two lead tablets from Oxyrhynchus; one leadtablet from the region of Antinoopolis (see next item); a lead tabletfrom Hawara; and a lead tablet at the University of Michigan (PapyrusMichigan 6925). ^ PGM IV contains an extensive collection of fifty-threeseparate recipes dating from the fourth century C.E. The special value ofthis extensive recipe is that it reveals the full complexity of ritual actionsassociated with the use of defixiones. In other words, it was never asimple matter of buying a piece of inscribed lead and tossing it into anopen grave. Our translation largely follows the version of E. N.

Differ-ent versions and parts of this hymn to Helios appear in PGM I, lines 315-27; IV, lines 1957-89;VIII, lines 74-80. In his analysis of this and other hymns in PGM, the great student of Greekreligion, Martin Nilsson, argued that these hymns were not the products of the professionalmagoi who authored and sold the spells but were taken over from a much earlier tradition ofGreek magic, which survived largely in these poetic texts; cf. \"Die Religion in den griechischenZauberpapyri,\" Opuscula Selecta 3 (Lund, 1960): 129-30. Although Nilsson's view is possible, itis based on his view that \"magic\" and religion represent antithetical phenomena, a view notshared by the authors of this book. Thus, we must hold open the possibility that it was preciselythe magoi who produced not only the spells but the hymns as well.47. This and the following lines make it apparent that the hymn in its original form waswritten for precisely the sort of spell that it accompanies here. It is not, as some have suggested,a \"purely religious\" cult hymn, borrowed from the \"religious\" sphere and adapted secondarilyfor \"magical\" purposes.48.

C. Edgar52; and a lead tablet at the University ofMichigan (Papyrus Michigan 6925). The figurine conforms closely to the49. In this and the preceding lines, the hymn expresses a common fear that the power of thespell or, in this case, the power of the spirit might turn against the client. The source of the fearwas no doubt twofold: first, the effect of the spell was to disturb the dead person's spirit, whichmight quite plausibly make it angry at the client; and second, as the spell itself prescribes, thespirit belonged to someone who had died early or by violence, under circumstances that ren-dered it angry and vengeful.50. The Egyptian god Horus is here identified with Helios, as also in line 989; in Egyptianreligion of our period, Horus was worshiped at Heliopolis and revered as the god of the morningsun.51.

Whereas the model in PGM calls for the relevantnames to be introduced (deina, \"so and so\"), our tablet names the clientas Sarapammon, son of Area, and the desired woman as Ptolemais,daughter of Aias and Origenes. The spell invokes a number of deities(or one deity under a long series of names?), but the immediate agent isthe spirit of a dead man, whose name is Antinous (Hadrian's friend?)and whose task it is to carry out the charge. In return for the successfulcompletion of its charge, the client promises to release the spirit ofAntinous from its restlessness. The occasion is love-longing; whethermarriage is the ultimate goal is not certain, though Sarapammon doesenvisage a long-standing relationship with Ptolemais.

The editor dates the pot to the third or fourth century C.E. Thepot belongs with two lead tablets, also from Oxyrhynchus (Wortmann,nos. 1-2, pp. 57-80). The writing on the pot comes from the sameperson who inscribed the tablets; the text is largely derived (in muchabbreviated form) from the text recorded on the tablets; and the threeitems concern the same \"problem\"—a certain Theodores undertakes byvarious means to win the affections of a woman. The spirits addressedhere include none of the pagan figures (Kore, Persephone, Adonis,Thoth, Anubis, Hekate, and so on) cited in the tablets. Instead, the onlynames, of the secret and mysterious variety, are those associated com-monly with Jewish texts (Adonaios, Baruch, Sabaoth, Abrasax, lao, andso forth). As in all of the spells derived from PGM IV (lines 296ff.), theimmediate agent is the spirit of a dead person, here not named, in whosegrave the tablets and pot were deposited. While unusual, the use of a potfor writing a binding spell is not without precedent (Wortmann, p. 81; cf.no. 26). Bibl.: Wortmann, no. 3, pp. 80-84; cf. SGD 155-56; SuppMag51 (text).57.

The editor assignsa date in the fifth century C.E. Our couple is the only Greco-Romanexample portraying such an embrace. There is, however, a close parallelin an Arabic text, called Picatrix, where two wax figures are to be placedface-to-face if the goal is union or back-to-back if it is separation.64 The59. The Greek word ousia is used here to designate something associated with the target,such as hair or threads of clothing. Jordan, \"Agora,\" p. 251, discusses other instances where suchousia is prescribed or has actually survived.60. The two occurrences of IAO are written with a short line above each letter, probably as anindication that the words were to be regarded as nomina sacra, much like the \"boxed\" names inShaked and Naveh, Amulet 1. As such, they indicated names of special power; see C. H.Roberts, Manuscript, Society and Belief in Early Christian Egypt (London, 1979), pp. 26ff.(\"Nomina Sacra: Origins and Significance\").61.

Such threats are not uncommon in the magical papyri, especially where Egyptian influ-ence is strong. PGM XXXIV threatens that \"the sun will stand still; and should I order themoon, it will come down and should I wish to delay the day, the night will remain for me.\"Conversely, PGM LVII consists of a spell in which the magos promises to withhold similarthreats if certain commands are fulfilled: \"Accomplish this for him, whatever I have written herefor you, and I will leave the east and the west.\" For a discussion of the ideas and practices intraditional Egyptian religion that underlie these threats, particularly the extent to which the godswere thought to be utterly dependent on daily rituals, see Wortmann, pp. 92-93.70. This term, together with Osiris, is akin to Osoronnophris, a common name for Osirismeaning \"Osiris the beautiful being.\"71. In general, the dead were thought to suffer from thirst in the underworld. Osiris inparticular brought water, as in a common grave inscription, \"May Osiris bring you cool water.\"72. The figure named here is not otherwise attested. The idea of burning as a form ofpunishment in the underworld was widespread in antiquity, reaching from Plato's myth of \"thevast region of blazing fire\" in the Phaedo (113-15) to later Jewish and Christian texts. Here itserves as the counterpart to the refreshing water of Osiris.73. The suffix -lamps is common among voces mysticae.74. Probably a reference to the cemetery where the tablet was deposited; normally, cemeter-ies in Egypt were thought to be ruled by Anubis, represented with the head of a jackal or dog.75. The reference here is to steles or official inscriptions set up in temples. Such monumentssometimes contained lists of instructions or secret names of the gods. PGM VII, lines 41-42, forinstance, speaks as follows: \"Your true name is inscribed on the holy stele in the sanctuary atHermoupolis, where you were born.\"76. The reference is to the blood of the enemies of the gods, notably Seth as the archenemy.In turn, this blood was traditionally identified with the flood waters of the Nile, especially at themoment of creation (see D. Wortmann, \"Kosmogonie und Nilflut,\" Banner Jahrbticher 166[1966]: 87-88). These combined powers are here invoked against the spirits in case they fail tocooperate in carrying out the spell. Behind the name, lothath, lies Thoth, the great Egyptian godof wisdom and ritual power. The word translated here as \"temple\" appears as dap and is not aGreek word. It probably represented a transliteration of the Coptic word for temple or holyplace; cf. Wortmann, p. 97.77. A common attribute of various Egyptian gods, including Isis.

Alternatively, the ten months may designate the institution of \"trial marriages,\" attestedin Egypt of the Roman period; see the discussion of S.

Margalioth and translated into En-glish by Michael Morgan. It contains numerous spells and recipes for awide variety of purposes. They are embedded in a detailed descriptionof six heavenly firmaments, to each of which are assigned groups ofangels. The text provides their secret and powerful names along withtheir functions and specialties. The document itself dates most likelyfrom the third or fourth centuries C.E.; the individual spells and recipesare no doubt earlier. While the descriptions of the heavenly firmamentsand their angelic inhabitants are distinctively Jewish, the spells are not.The book provides numerous recipes for producing defixiones from vari-ous metals—copper, gold, iron, lead, tin, and silver. This particular spellconcerns love and marriage.?8 Bibl.: Sepher ha-Razim, pp. 45-46.If you wish to put love of a man into the heart of a woman, or to arrange for apoor man to wed a rich woman, take two copper lamellae and write uponthem, on both sides,89 the names of these angels, and the name of the manand the name of the woman and say thus: \"I ask of you, angels who rule thefates of the children of Adam and Eve, that you do my will and bring inconjunction the planet of N son of N90 into conjunction with91 (the planet of)the woman N daughter of N. Let him find favor and affection in her eyes anddo not let her belong to any man except him.\" Place one lamella in a fieryfurnace92 and the other where she bathes.93 Do this on the twenty-ninth ofthe month when the moon has completely waned. Take care to keep your-self from intercourse, from wine, and from all (kinds of) meat.87. At this point it becomes clear that Theon's interest is primarily sexual; \"nothing but mydesire\" most likely indicates Theon's own sexual fantasies.88. Lines 30ff. of the second firmament; Sepher ha-Razim, pp. 45-46.89. Here the instructions confirm the physical evidence, that the metal sheets could some-times be inscribed on both sides.90. In the recipes of the Sepher, it is not possible to determine whether the names aredesignated by paternal or maternal lineage. However, the common practice of identifying per-sons by maternal descent is well attested even in the circles of Rabbinic Jews; in the BabylonianTalmud (Shabbath 66b), Abaye states that all spells repeated several times must include thename of the person's mother.91. The means specified here for bringing man and woman together also involved astrologi-cal techniques of some sort.92. Here again the action is symbolic; as the fire burns, so should the heart of the desiredwoman. In this case, the \"real\" fire must refer to the furnaces (hypocaust) of the bathhouse.93. Morgan comments that according to Rabbinic law (which may or may not be relevanthere) women who use the ritual bath (mikvah) are either married or about to be married.

These figuresprobably depict the series of animals cited in the spell. One appears todepict a crocodile; another shows two people kissing; still another maybe a schematic effort to represent a penis entering a vagina. The occa-sion is a familiar one: the client, a man, seeks to win the affections of awoman and to prevent her from having sexual relations with anyone buthimself. There is no indication that the relationship was meant to in-volve marriage. Although the language of the tablet is Greek, the per-vading atmosphere is Greco-Egyptian. Like other love spells of a similarkind, this one expresses primarily a set of male fantasies about sexualpleasures and female subservience. Bibl.: V.

The spell usesthe imagery of fevers and quarrels, abetted by the powers of Greekvowels and voces mysticae, to separate a husband and wife. The focalverb, apallasso, derives from the legal word for divorce, while the heatimagery suggests sexual motivations on the part of the client. The client(unnamed) desires to break up a marriage and (presumably) attain thewife for himself. Yet this second intent is not spelled out.

At this point the spell follows a common procedure of identifying the speaker/clientwith a more-than-human authority; in this case the authority, an otherwise unnamed god orspirit, is invoked by its secret, mystical name.101. This name appears beside the figure of a daimon in PGM II, line 167. It should be notedthat the text as given in PGM (cf. GMP, p. 18) reads CHAMPSOUR§; Martin comments that thepapyrus itself clearly shows the first letter as a lambda; thus the word should read LAMPSOURS, acommon term in PGM (e.g., V, line 62).102. The term appears several times in the papyri; cf. PGM II, line 234; V, line 425; VII,lines 680-81.103. The same term appears in PGM XXXVI, line 170. It refers to the Egyptian god,Khepri, embodied in the scarab.104. At this point the text reads on, whose meaning remains unclear. It might represent don(Greek for \"egg\") or possibly the present participle of the verb \"to be,\" as in \"I who am . . . (thepreceding voces).\"105. The Greek term is philtrokatadesmos; it also appears in the lengthy love charm whosepreparation is detailed in PGM IV, lines 296ff.106.

The spell is addressed, as wasfrequently the case, to the spirit of a dead person in the cemetery, whoserole is to carry out the immediate task of the spell. But the greater powerinvoked, whose function was to command the local spirit, is the god ofIsrael. No other spirits or deities are invoked. The language of the invoca-tion is strongly reminiscent of the Septuagint (LXX) and other GreekJewish texts.113 The spell was commissioned by a woman, Domitiana, forthe purpose of inducing a man, Urbanus, to take her as his wife. Both theclient and her \"target\" were probably freedmen. Despite the numerousechoes of terms and phrases from the Greek Bible, there is no need toassume that either the client or the professional was Jewish, though bothmay have been. The language of the spell is certainly Jewish in its originsbut had probably become part of the common culture of professionalmagoi by the time it was copied from a reference book in Hadrumentumin the third century C.E.

This line,along with the Greek in Roman letters of lines 4-5 (in fact this is just one line inasmuch as itbegins on line 5 and slopes upward into a blank space in the middle of line 4), was added at alater time. Maspero explains the confusion of the opening lines as follows: the original scribe leftthe first line blank, with the intention of later inserting the name of the local spirit to be invoked;the scribe also left a blank space in line 4, for the special names of the deity, and drew a verticalline toward the end, just before the kai of \"and bring him,\" indicating the limit of the spaceavailable for them; the scribe's eye then skipped from one kai to the next, a common scribalerror, and in the process omitted the first part of the command and the name of the target; at thispoint, a second hand, perhaps the chief magos in the shop or possibly even Domitiana herself,discovered the omission and added the missing phrase in Roman letters, beginning on the nextline and sloping upward to fill the blank space in line 4 (the text reads, in Roman letters, caeapelthe pros ton orbanon hon ethecen urbana).116. The identical words appear in PGM V, line 135. Abaoth is a variant of Sabaoth.117. The text reads Abraan. This mistaken spelling of the name of Abraham is but one ofseveral errors that suggest that the immediate writer of the tablet was probably not a Jew or, ifso, not a highly literate one.118. Here, as in line 38, the word is lakou, a corruption of Jacob.119. Here, as in line 39, Israma is written instead of Israel. The double occurrence points tothe likelihood that the corruption existed already in the reference book from which this spell wascopied.120. The name of God is frequently described in the LXX as enft'mon/\"honored\" (Deuteron-omy 28:58), phoberon/\" dreadful\" (Psalm 110:9); the combination of megas (\"great\") kaiphoberos is common (Deuteronomy 10:17; Sirach 43:29).121. The Greek term sumbios is used regularly in papyri for husband or wife.122. The identical phrase appears in Isaiah 26:4.123. The Greek term pantokratdr is commonly applied to God in the LXX.124. A clear echo of Genesis 1:1; 14:19, 22.125. The phrase means that the righteous are separated from the ungodly. The text refers toSirach (LXX) 33:1 Iff.

The idea that the name of the God of Israel could not be spoken outside the Temple andthus possessed enormous potency was widespread in ancient Judaism.133. The name(s) of the God of Israel recur frequently in magical papyri. Here the magosuses the ultimate threat, the pronouncing of the divine name, to motivate the spirit. Josephus,Bellum Judaicum 5.438, speaks of the \"terrible name of God\" (to phrikton onoma tou theou).134.

A character in Aristophanes' Peace commentsthat Athenians never do anything but try cases.We know much about the formal aspects of ancient legal culture—how charges were filed, how evidence and witnesses were presented,how juries were selected, and how verdicts were rendered.1 But for ourpurposes, we may safely ignore these formal matters, including thenumerous important differences between Greek, Roman, and otherancient legal systems, in order to focus instead on one particular aspectof the legal process, namely, how prospective litigants prepared todefend themselves against their accusers. According to the standardtreatments, such preparations covered the following items: preliminarysparring before magistrates over the legitimacy of the charges and thecompetence of the court; the gathering of evidence and witnesses in sup-port of one's case; and, once a trial seemed inevitable, the decision toseek professional assistance in the form of an orator or speech writer.2Once again, however, these were strictly formal matters, and we knowfrom our own experience that involvement in legal proceedings evokesand engages powerful emotions—fear, shame, guilt, panic—that re-quire preparation and treatment of an entirely different kind. In antiq-uity, how were these emotions recognized and handled, if at all? To behonest, most scholarly discussions have paid them no heed whatsoever,so that we may perhaps excuse them for having also ignored a substan-tial body of relevant material whose precise if unstated function was to1163"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Tongue-Tied in Court  117deal with the nonlegal side, the emotional dimension, of lawsuits andpublic trials.3This body of material comprises curse tablets, directed against judicialopponents and accusers, from classical Athens to the late Roman Em-pire. Altogether some sixty-seven Greek examples have been published,along with a lesser number (approximately forty-six) in Latin; a Hebrewcollection of spells and curses, the Sepher ha-Razim, includes a recipefor preparing a defixio to reverse bad fortune in a trial.4 Indeed, amongthe published Greek defixiones, judicial or legal types constitute thesecond largest subgroup. In addition, this group contains some of theearliest and best preserved of all ancient curse tablets. The very earliestdate from the Greek colony at Selinus, on Sicily, around the year 500B.C.E. (no. 49), while a somewhat later tablet (no. 50) from the same sitehas been described as \"the largest complete defixio of the fifth century.\"5From the Greek mainland, several well-preserved tablets have survivedfrom the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E., while curses in Greek stilloccur as late as the third century C.E. in Palestine and the fifth century inEgypt. Among these later examples, the most intriguing is a large cacheof more than two hundred tablets, discovered in a well on Cyprus.6Dating from the second or third century C.E., these tablets—of whichonly seventeen have yet been published—employ the same formulasthroughout and concern a variety of different trials. In each instance, thetablets name the defendant as well as the plaintiff, but only one of thepublished curses gives any details about the case (no. 46).The procedures and the circumstances involved in commissioningstraightforward—and common. Indeed, we must now begin to considerthe likelihood that commissioning a curse tablet against prospectivejudicial opponents was a regular feature of the legal process in theGreco-Roman world. Two facts seem certain: first, and contrary toearlier views, which held that judicial tablets represented efforts toseek revenge against one's accusers following a trial,7 it is now clearthat the deployment of the defixio belongs to the preliminary phase ofpreparations for an anticipated trial; and second, by the very nature ofthe case, those who commissioned the tablets were prospective defen-dants.8 Exceptions to those two observations are rare: first, a spellprescribed in the Jewish collection, Sepher ha-Razim, promises relieffor a friend who has already suffered an unfavorable ruling; and sec-ond, a number of cases involve disputes over inheritances and owner-ship of property that do not lend themselves to the category of criminallaw (defender versus prosecutor) but fall instead into the category ofand deploying defixiones of a judicial character are relatively"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"118 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldcivil cases in which the emphasis lay on efforts at mediation and the\"loser\" was not found guilty of any crime. While it is not always easy todistinguish between criminal and civil trials in the tablets, one thing isclear in every case—the clients who commissioned the defixio sawthemselves as threatened by the legal proceedings and consequentlytook extralegal measures in order to guarantee a favorable outcome.9Overall, the language and structure of judicial defixiones follow thedevelopmental pattern of curse tablets in general. The earliest examplesname the opponents; they sometimes invoke local deities by their famil-iar names, though some examples omit both verbs of binding and thenames of the deities; and they mention the physical and mental faculties,usually tongue and mind, to be bound or tied up so that the targets willbe unable to pursue their case. Later examples, by contrast, tend to belonger, to use secret names and mystical terms (the voces mysticae), toinvoke spirits and deities from many traditions, and to provide specificdetails for every aspect of the binding process.10In general, the potential defendant in a legal proceeding seems tohave resorted to a local professional, perhaps to a magos, in order tocommission a defixio.n Very little is known about this stage of the trans-action, but it seems fair to guess that the professional played a leadingrole: he (most seem to have been men) supplied the text and the metaltablet, perhaps offering the client a range of options according to asliding scale of fees; he inscribed the tablet, or in some cases selectedone from a pile of preinscribed sheets, filling in the client's name, thenames of the opponents, and sometimes providing a few details relatedto the case; and in all likelihood, he arranged for the placement of thetablet, in a well but more often in a grave or tomb, where its bindingaction was entrusted to the restless spirit, the \"ghost,\" of the deadperson.12 At least with the later tablets, the role of the deities anddaimones was not to carry out the curse itself but rather to see to it thatthe spirit of the dead person executed the spell as commanded.out through the symbolic medium of written and spoken words under-stood as \"things\" that could change the world. The written form ofwords is obvious in the inscribed text on the metal sheet; the spokenword is less obvious but no less important and, as the recipes in theGreek papyri make clear, took the form of oral prayers and invocationsdelivered at various stages in the preparation and placement of thedefixio. As for the binding action itself, it is sometimes made explicit, asin cases where the opponents are to be rendered speechless, like thecorpse in the grave, or where they are to become cold and useless, likeFor the most part, the binding action of judicial defixiones was carried"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Tongue-Tied in Court  119the lead of the tablet itself. In other cases, the symbolic character of thebinding action is extended from words-as-things to other physical ob-jects, like dolls, figurines, and dead animals.13 Several examples of suchfigurines have been recovered in Greece and elsewhere. One (no. 41) isclearly judicial and bears the name of the target inscribed on its leg.Other examples, some of which are also judicial, represent figures invarious suggestive postures—laid out in miniature coffins, hands boundbehind their backs, heads sometimes turned sideways or completelyremoved, and so on.The first figurine just mentioned (no. 41), from the Kerameikos inAthens and dating to fourth century B.C.E., raises a number of furtherissues. First, in a tablet whose judicial character is unmistakable, thetext names not just one but nine accusers and, by way of caution, incor-porates \"any one else with them as an advocate or witness.\" In short, theclient's enemies constituted, in his mind, a group, perhaps even a party.Second, multiple accusers are not at all uncommon in Greece: in theApology Socrates always refers to his accusers in the plural. What thissuggests, as is patently manifest in the case of Socrates, is that many ofthe tablets with multiple accusers—in one case the total approachesseventy-seven—lead us from the realm of the law into the world ofpolitical strife and competition. In other words, the Greek public wasneither the first nor the last to use courts of law as a cover for advancingtheir own political causes and for crushing those of their opponents.Whether or not one chooses to distinguish a separate category ofpolitical defixiones is largely a matter of taste.14 Here we have chosen torecognize a distinction while treating them in the same chapter (legal,nos. 37-54; political, nos. 55-59). More important is to recognize thatthe tortured political history of Greece from the end of the Peloponne-sian War to the Macedonian conquest under Philip, Alexander, and theirsuccessors witnessed an era of unparalleled political strife and that muchof the drama was played out in the courts.15 As the testimony of the cursetablets clearly reveals, the confusion of political and legal affairs gener-ated a need on the part of many to call upon higher powers to sustaintheir cause. Third and last, the Greek and Latin defixiones demonstrateconclusively that the use of curse tablets was by no means limited to\"unlettered and superstitious\" members of the lower classes. In classicalGreece as in imperial Rome, their power was accepted and employed byall, including the wealthy and powerful Athenian aristocrats cited onnumerous Greek tablets.16 Similarly, just as defixiones cut across allsocial categories, they were no respecters of gender. Several tablets,including some from Greece and at least one from Sicily, mention"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"120 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldwomen as potential witnesses. Their presence contradicts the traditionalview that women had no legal standing in Greek courts, but the evidenceof the defixiones as well as other considerations must now call this viewinto question.17 Women must also have been among those who commis-sioned judicial tablets, as is even more clearly the case in tablets relatingto matters of sex and pleas for justice.The persistent and pervasive belief in the binding power of judicialdefixiones may be further illustrated by the evidence of literary sources.Generally speaking, the Greeks of classical Athens were fully convincedthat words—or rather, correct words skillfully arrayed—could shapehuman behavior. Words, in the form of rhetorical and philosophicaldiscourse, were frequently likened to charms and spells. Socrates toyswith a young man in the Charmides who is looking for a spell to cureheadaches; what he really needs, answers Socrates, is a spell to cure thesoul, meaning, of course, that philosophical training alone can providethe ultimate cure. At almost exactly the same date, Aristophanes, in theWasps, mentions the case of a well-known orator whose jaws suddenlyand inexplicably froze as he was defending himself before an Athenianjury. Two competing explanations of the orator's dilemma circulated atthe time: one, no doubt advanced by his enemies, held that he wassimply outargued by his rhetorically gifted opponents, while the other,certainly preferred by the orator himself, insisted that his tongue hadbeen tied up, certainly by a judicial defixio.18 At a much later date, in thefirst century B.C.E., Cicero tells of a similar case in which a lawyer, inmidspeech, forgot which case he was pleading, subsequently blaming hislapse on spells and curses (veneficiis et cantionibus) .19 Later still, in themid-second century, the physician-philosopher Galen indicates his dis-dain for all who believed in the power of spells and charms, citing theirclaim as follows: \"I will bind my opponents so that they will be incapableof saying anything during the trial. \"20 But of course, Galen's very disdainfor such beliefs and practices merely confirms their broad circulation inhis time.Can we take one further step, beyond the now incontrovertible beliefin the effectiveness of curse tablets? Dare we ask whether these cursesactually worked? The answer must be that they did. Or, at the very least,that they were widely believed to work. Not, perhaps, precisely as themagos and his clients believed, through the agency of daimones, deities,and ghosts. But work they did, more likely, as literary figures argued,through the coercive power of words, a power much exploited by practi-tioners of rhetoric and philosophy.21 If two essential components in un-derstanding how judicial curses worked were, first, the general belief in"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Tongue-Tied in Court   121the power of words, and second, the related belief that this power couldextend beyond the human realm to coerce unseen but no less real person-alities via the medium of defixiones, a third element certainly lay in thetensions and anxieties experienced by all public speakers, whether ora-tors or defendants at trial, especially when they \"knew\" that they werelikely targets of binding spells. Under these circumstances, it is no won-der that they worked.Two famous orators who suffered bouts of verbal paralysis aptly re-flect Euripides's description of how it must have felt to speak before alarge public audience with one's reputation or even one's life on theline. First, Euripides: \"Whenever anyone stands opposite in the debateand is about to speak at a trial for homicide, fear paralyzes the mouth ofmen and prevents the mind from saying what it wants to say.\"22 AeliusAristides, the most noted orator of the second century C.E., foundhimself frequently incapable of delivering his speeches due to respira-tory disorders, no doubt of a psychosomatic nature. Although Aristidesgives no hint of attributing his difficulties to spells or curses, perhapsbecause his problems were chronic in nature, the case is quite differentwith Libanius, one of the leading orators of the fourth century C.E.Numerous references in his autobiographical speech (Oratio 1) attestthe frequency with which orators resorted to charges that their enemieshad used binding spells, but one incident in particular paints a vividportrait of how effective these spells must have been.23 Libanius wasdevastated by physical maladies in his later years, especially by migraineheadaches, which made it impossible for him to lecture before his stu-dents. Doctors proved unable to provide a cure. But a dream revealedto him that he had been the target of hostile rituals; the truth of thedream was soon confirmed when a mutilated chameleon turned up inhis lecture hall, its head stuffed behind its rear legs and one of its frontlegs placed over its mouth. Discovered and removed from the building,the obvious source of Libanius's illness was eliminated and the oratorsoon returned to full health. Later he complained to his students abouttheir indifference to his sufferings, in a passage that clearly demon-strates his conviction that he had been done in by a curse tablet: \"Whenyou believe that a charioteer or a horse has been hobbled in this manner(by a defixio), everything is in an uproar, as if the city itself had beendestroyed; but I am treated with indifference when the same thingshappen to me.\"One final word about the commonly held view that the beliefs aboutcurse tablets and binding spells so fully displayed by Libanius belongexclusively to \"the superstitious age in which he lived,\"24 an age once"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldcaricatured by Gilbert Murray for its \"failure of nerve.\"25 The evidenceof the defixiones themselves, stretching from the sixth century B.C.E. tothe sixth century C.E., proves, as Peter Brown has noted, that \"it is farfrom certain that there was any absolute increase in fear of sorcery or insorcery practices in the late Roman period.\"26 Instead, as Brown ob-serves, such beliefs function like X-rays, revealing \"pockets of uncer-tainty and competition.\"27 Such pockets, we have good reason to be-lieve, belong to every age and to every place.Notes1.

For a more recent treatment, see Faraone,\"Context,\" n. 67.8.

Part of the tension in these trials was certainly due to class antagonism.Ober (Mass and Elite, p. 18), without mentioning judicial defixiones, constructsa scenario in which their use would seem both rational and inevitable: \"the elitelitigant retained functional advantages over his ordinary opponent, and thepoorer Athenian's envy and resentment of the social privileges enjoyed by thewealthy man were far from eliminated.\" It is not too much to speak of defixionesin general as tokens of envy and resentment.10. So Moraux, Defixion, pp. 5-10, though we need not follow him in describ-ing the later period as a time of delirious syncretism (p.7).11. C. Faraone has suggested that in the earlier defixiones, those of the sixthto fourth centuries B.C.E. , the great variety of formulas and vocabulary points tothe likelihood that many individuals simply prepared their own tablets. Still,Plato (Republic 364C) speaks of wandering specialists who offered their servicesfor a fee. Certainly the clear evidence for professional hands on defixionescomes from a later time, the first to sixth centuries C.E.12. Recently, D. R. Jordan has presented evidence from Athens that theinscribers and dispensers of defixiones may have been professional scribes,\"moonlighting,\" rather than magoi. His evidence is of two sorts: a large horde oftablets was turned up in a well near the stoa where professional scribes workedin the city's civic offices; and curse tablets of the period in question \"have scriptscomparable in quality with those of the Civic Office well, and most show evi-dence for the use of formularies.\" See Jordan, \"New Evidence for the Activity ofScribes in Roman Athens,\" Abstracts of the American Philological Association—120th Annual Meeting (Baltimore) (Atlanta, 1989), p. 55.13. The most thorough treatment of such objects is by David Jordan, \"NewArchaeological Evidence for the Practice of Magic in Classical Athens,\" inPraktika tou XII diethnous synedriou klasikes archaiologias (Athens 1988), pp.273-77, which includes a number of recent and yet unpublished finds fromAthens; see also Jordan's brief description of these objects in SGD, p. 157.14. Preisendanz (1972), cols. 9-10, among others, isolated a separate cate-gory of political curses. Faraone, \"Context,\" pp. 16-17, is inclined to do awaywith the distinction. It is worth noting, however, that there is little substantivedifference between the two positions. Both agree that political disputes inGreece were fought out in lawsuits and public trials.15. On the politics of this period, see W. R. Connor, The New Politicians ofFifth-Century Athens (Princeton, 1971); C. Mosse, Athens in Decline: 404-86B.C.

Stressing the pointthat wealthy and poor citizens seem regularly to have associated with one an-other, despite differences of class, he cites a defixio from the fourth centuryB.C.E. that names politicians of high standing together with prostitutes; presum-ably they belonged to the same circles.17.

In 323 B.C.E., Athens revolted againstthe rule of the Macedonians; the revolt failed, in part because of thepoor condition of the Athenian navy. Lawsuits involving trierarchs andnaval affairs were rampant during these years.

On the right leg of the figurine isinscribed a name, Mnesimachus.21 (2) The first of two oblong platesshaped like saucers and measuring approximately 11 x 6 cm. and 2 cm.deep. Together, the two sheets formed the top and bottom of a minia-ture sarcophagus for the figurine. On the first sheet, there is no writ-ing. (3) The second sheet contains the curse proper, where the name ofMnesimachus reappears. Beneath the inscription, and to the right,there are two holes, presumably made by a nail. These objects are ofparticular interest in that they were found precisely where they wereoriginally deposited. The objects were found in a grave, along with thepartially disturbed and mutilated remains of a human skeleton and ared-figure vase (lekythos). The figurine was placed at the pelvis of theskeleton and the inscribed plate was discovered just above it. The dateof the grave itself lies close to 400 B.C.E.; the names on the lead ob-jects belong to well-known public figures from the late fifth century.2219.

Nikomachos may be the controversial and prominent commissioner (anagrapheus) whoin 411 B.C.E. and again in 403 was appointed to draw up a revised copy of the laws of Solon. Onboth occasions he took much more time than expected. The orator Lysias, along with others,sought to impeach him; Lysias's oration against Nikomachos has survived (Against Niko-machos). In the Frogs (1506), Aristophanes mentions Nikomachos among the fools of Athens. ANikomachos also appears in another curse tablet, from approximately the same period; cf.Wilhelm, p. 122. The name also appears on a lead figurine from the Kerameikos (no. 41).24. A common name of the period; cf. Trumpf, p. 101.

The first tablet (A) protects Aris-tandros from Neophanes; the second (B) protects Eratophaenea fromboth Akestor and Timandridas.

Cyprus, Amathous, near Paphos.44 Discovered by workmen \"at thebottom of a disused shaft, under a quantity of human bones.\"45 From thelanguage of the tablet it seems possible that the shaft served as a com-mon grave. D. R. Jordan notes that the original find consisted of morethan two hundred tablets on lead and an additional sixty on sheets ofselenite. Altogether, seventeen tablets were published by L. Macdonaldin 1891. The rest are in the British Museum in London and the Biblio-40. According to Athenaeus (The Learned Banquet 377bc), written ca. 200 C.E., the Atticcomedian Poseidippus (ca. 289 B.C.E.) mentions the same Seuthes in one of his comedies.Poseidippus was noted for having introduced slaves as cooks into his dramas.41. According to Athenaeus (379e), Euphron, another new comedian and a contemporaryof Poseidippus, mentioned a butcher/cook, with the name of Lamprias, in one of his plays.Lamprias is credited with having first created black broth (zomos melas). The speaker goes on torank Lamprias and six other cooks as the second group of \"Seven Sages\" in Greek history.42. In other words, the client \"wishes\" for his enemies the same fate as that of the tabletitself.43. The client here anticipates two possible stages in legal proceedings—the preliminaryhearing before an arbitrator (diaitetes) or a full trial in the public court (dikasterion).44. According to the report (p. 184) of P. Aupert and D. R. Jordan, this and the other tabletswere in fact found at Amathous, not at Kourion, as reported by all previous scholars. Cyprus wasknown in antiquity as a center of \"magical\" activity. In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder writesof the various \"schools\" or traditions of the magi: \"There is yet another branch of magic, derivedfrom Moses, Jannes, Lopates, and the Jews, but living many thousand years after Zoroaster.And much more recent is the branch in Cyprus\" (30.11). Jews were known as magoi on Cyprus.Josephus (Antiquities 20.142-44) reports efforts by the Roman procurator of Judea, Felix, to winthe affections of Drusilla, great-granddaughter of Herod and sister of Agrippa, by using theservices of a Jew from Cyprus, named Atomus, who had advertised himself as a magos. Atomuswas summoned to provide Felix with a binding spell, of the sort well known and attested amongthe finds from Amathous. With this must be compared the tale in Acts 13:4-12. Paul sails toCyprus and preaches his message in the synagogues. Arriving at Paphos, near Amathous, heencounters a Jewish magos (or possibly two figures, conflated by the author) by the name of Bar-Jesus or Elymas; presumably Bar-Jesus called himself magos. This Elymas was a friend of theRoman proconsul, Sergius Paulus; in other words he was a figure of considerable standing. Paulconfronts Elymas with his own superior power and renders him temporarily blind. Sergius Paulusembraces Christianity on the spot. Assuming, roughly, a late second century date for the tablets,we are thus able to locate two important moments in the history of \"magic\" on Cyprus, reachingfrom the mid-first century to the late second or early third century. On the story in Acts, see A.D. Nock, \"Paul and the Magus,\" in The Beginnings of Christianity, ed. F. J. Foakes Jackson andK. Lake, vol. 5 (London, 1933), pp. 164-88, and on the considerable evidence for the Jewishcommunity on Cyprus, see T. B.

The one chosen for translation here is a leadsheet, measuring 14.7 x 25.9 cm. The right and left edges are worn andthe bottom is missing portions of a line or two; the full text covered somesixty lines. The letter shapes and the postclassical Greek point to a datein the late second or the mid-third century C.E. Except for a \"rudelydrawn figure of a bird\" (a rooster?) on the fragmentary no. 141 inMitford's edition (DT 36), there are no designs on the tablets. Theaction of the spell or curse consists of two parts, each repeated severaltimes and not always in the same manner: first, the deities and spirits areinvoked; next they are bidden to take over the named targets. The bulkof this massive find consists of brief spells directed against opponents,the prosecutors, in legal proceedings. Their intended goal is not to kill orinjure these opponents but to render them incapable of speaking at thetrial. The clients were thus prospective defendants. Among the tabletsfrom Amathous, only one gives any information concerning the sub-stance of the dispute; no. 134, line 18, at the place where all of theparallel texts say simply \"so that he may be unable to oppose (me) in anymatter,\" adds \"concerning the thremmata (young animals/slaves?).\" Thenames of the litigants, both defendant/client and prosecutor/target, ap-pear in every text.47 The deities and spirits invoked include a widevariety of name types from diverse sources (Greek, Jewish, and Egyp-tian), among them several with mysterious combinations of letters of thesort known from other spells and tablets.

Audollent (DT, p. 42) suggests that behind these letters may lie the Greek word for\"falcon,\" ierax/irex.54. The Greek is resichthon, a common epithet of Hekate and Dionysus; here it appears tomodify STERXERX.55. Audollent interprets these two words as the description of a spirit gnashing its teeth witha face on its hand (DT, p. 42). The reading of PRISTEU is taken from Audollent in preference toMitford's PRISSGEU.56. The Greek term is katathema. Here it clearly designates the tablet itself.57.

Under Romanrule until the reforms of Diocletian, Cyprus was governed by a proconsul (Greek anthupatos, thetitle of Sergius Paulus in Acts 13:7).

The Ionian Greek is not polished; although the syntax and languageare elliptical, the general sense of the binding spell can be establishedwith fair certainty. Dated between the third and first century B.c.E.73 Thesetting is most probably judicial; the client seeks to initiate a preemptivestrike against the people named, who were about to give testimony incourt. Of interest is the switch from \"we\" to \"I/me,\" which may point tothe ritual context of the spell-casting act.

Discovered in a group of eight tablets near thesanctuary of the local goddess, Malophoros. Lead sheet measuring 17.2x 9.9 cm., originally folded down the middle but unusually well pre-served. Indeed, along with other tablets from Sicily, this is one of theoldest surviving tablets. The language is the normal Doric Greek ofSicily. The tablet is given a tentative date by L. Jeffery of 475-450 B.C.E.The text contains \"misspellings, corrections, clumsy spacing, and varia-tion in letter forms and sizes.\"79 In line 16, a solid line was etched,dividing the sheet into two parts, one (A) of sixteen lines80 and the other(B) of just three lines.81 The deity invoked is never named, but referredto simply as \"the holy goddess.\" The verbs of binding are compounds ofgrapho (\"to write\"), three times with the prefix kata- and once withenkata-. No specific occasion is given in the spell, but the fact that theseventeen persons cursed are all male, that they appear to reflect familygroups (Calder identifies seven families)82 and that line 8 mentions78. It is not clear whether Eukles and Aristophanes are the names of the advocates oradditional figures.79. Calder, p. 172.80. Part A consists of eight subsections, each with a formula of cursing and the names ofthose cursed. The names in A appear in the accusative case, as direct objects of the bindingverbs.81. In B, the names all appear in the nominative case. There are other significant differencesbetween the two sections, described by Calder, pp. 164, 169-71; for example, of the twelveindividuals named in B, nine are repeated from A. Calder formulates the following hypothesis,not accepted by Masson (p. 378): the author of A, perhaps the son of the author of B, wrote firstand produced the longer text; between the writing of A and B, the names omitted by B hadceased to be a threat. Despite the differences signaled by Calder, Masson prefers to see B as asimple recapitulation of A. Calder proposes a division of A into eight subsections, each with \"aformula of consecration\" and each naming from one to four persons (these sections areindicated—roughly following Calder's divisions—by periods in the translation). The formulasrange from a simple \"with the holy goddess\" to the fuller \"I record/register with the holy goddessthe life and the strength. . . .\" B again differs from A, this time in excluding any curse formulaand giving only personal names.82. Calder cautiously defines the families as follows: (1) Pykeleios = father (?) of Halos;Halos = father of Lykinos (= father of Apelos) and Nauertos (= father of Atos ?; only if oneassumes, with Calder, that Nauertos and Naueridas are the same person); (2) Tamiras = fatherof Rotylos = father of Saris and Apelos; (3) Haiaios (our Kailios, following Masson) = father of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"140 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World\"tongues\" leads naturally to the assumption that the occasion was apending lawsuit. The client thus endeavors in the tablet to curse theprosecution and witnesses. Furthermore, as Calder suggests, the factthat the tablet targets family groups points in the direction of a disputeabout testaments or inheritance. The ethnic and national diversity ofnames in the text illustrates the social diversity of Selinus itself.83 Thetranslation below generally follows the readings and interpretations ofJeffery and Masson. Where Calder differs with Jeffery and Masson onpoints relevant to the text as a whole, indications will be found in thenotes. Bibl: Jeffery, p. 73, no. 10; W. M.

With the holygoddess (I record) Puros and the sons of Rotulos (the son) of Puros—with theholy goddess—both their power/strength and their tongues.88 Plakitas (son)of Nannelaios and Halos (son) of Pukeleios, I record their life with the holyRomis = father of Saris and Pyrrhos; (4) Nannelaios = father of Titelos; (5) Matylaios = fatherof Kadosis; (6) Magon = father of Ekotis; (7) Kaiaios (whom Calder takes to be different fromHaiaios in no. 3; Masson reads both as Kailios) = father of Phoinix = father of Apelos andTitelos. Not all of these relations are certain. For a somewhat different organization of familygroups, see Masson, p. 388.83. Masson classifies the names as follows: (1) Greek: definitely, Pyrrhos, Pyrrhinos,Phoinix, Plakitas; and possibly, Nauerotos, Naueridas, Halos, and Atos; (2) Semitic (Punic):Magon; (3) Sicilian or Italic or Etruscan: probably, Apelos, Titelos; and possibly, Rotylos,Kailios, Romis, Matylaios, Pykeleios; (4) Asiatic: Tamiras, Nannelaios; (5) uncertain: Ekotis,Kadosis, Saris.84. The verb here is katagraphein, a common binding verb in spells. It is used here with thepreposition par, a shortened form of para. The sense here as elsewhere is that the target is to betransferred to the realm or to the authority of the holy goddess.85. The Greek word ispsucha, the Doric variant ofpsuche. As Calder notes, it connotes theidea of \"essential life-force.\"86. The Greek here is dunamis, which is frequently paired withpsuche on other tablets (e.g.,DT234, line 16; 237, lines 9 and 30-31). They may be read either as approximate synonyms or,more plausibly, as embracing respectively the inner and outer aspects of human life in its totality.87. Nauerotos seems to be identical with the brother named just previously. Perhaps, asCalder suggests, the author of the text recalled his name and introduced it only after mentioninghim anonymously.88. Calder reads glosas (\"tongues\") and the followingplakitan as \"the tongue's flat surface.\"More likely, plakitan is to be taken as a proper name; so Masson, pp. 382-84."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Tongue-Tied in Court141FIGURE 18.

Three lead tablets, each inscribed in Latin on two sides andfound inside three separate funerary vases. The Latin is corrupt, with noregard for cases other than nominative and genitive. The tablets can bedated precisely to 78 C.E., on the basis of external evidence. The occa-sion concerns a trial between two local clans, the Olossitani and the Indi-cetani, plaintiffs and defendants, respectively. The issue seems to havebeen a border dispute. Those named include three prominent representa-tives of the Roman government in the region: (1) Marius Maturus, theprocurator Augusti, who is also known from Tacitus's Histories (2.12.5-6, 3.42.2-4, and 3.43.2), where he is referred to as the procurator of theMaritime Alps. In the spring of 69 C.E., he failed to defend the regionaround Narbonne from an Othonian invasion. (2) The legatus Augusti,whom Pflaum has suggested must be the legatus Augusti for the provinceof Spain near Tarragon. (3) One of his assistants, a praetorian legatusAugusti, who Pflaum suggests is the legate for the diocese of Tarragon.90. The Greek verb here is engraphein, which does not occur in any other defixio; the closestparallel is \"The Great Defixio,\" also from Selinous, which employs the cognate verb katagraphein.91. The name means \"the one from Selinous.\" Heurgon proposes to interpret the name asevidence that its bearer, while a citizen of the city, may not have been born into the status butmore likely had acquired it, perhaps illegally, as an adult.92. Sundikoi played an important role as prosecution witnesses in Greek courts and are thusnamed frequently in defixiones of a judicial character. But the sundikoi here are further calledxenoi, \"foreign.\" No such phrase appears elsewhere in connection with any Greek legal practice.Selinous was populated by residents of various national origins. Thus Heurgon (pp. 73-74)proposes the following scenario leading up to the deposition of the tablet: a dispute had arisenconcerning the legality of the client's citizenship; certain witnesses were summoned to givetestimony; those named on Side A include some noncitizens (xenoi) and, perhaps by extension,our Selinonntios; in any case, as Heurgon notes, we do appear to have a situation here where, incontrast to Athens, women were competent to provide legal testimony in court proceedings."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Tongue-Tied in Court  143Lamboglia argues that the tablets were deposited by Sempronius Cam-panus Fidentius, on behalf of the Olossitani, and that the curses aredirected against the highest authorities in the province and the consiliumlegati, the council with jurisdiction over the Indicetani.

Such games are based on limited patterns of variations which are in turn based onassociations and echoes of letters and sounds, for example, the combination in different order ofthe vowels, i, a, o, and e. These forms must have evolved long before they entered the hand-books of magicians as fixed formulas, although there is evidence to suggest that professionalmagicians themselves sometimes continued the tradition by adding variations of their own. Inthis instance, the presence of IAO is probably to be seen as an example of this game playing andnot as an example of a conscious or \"high level\" combination of Egyptian and Jewish themes.95. Various interpretations have been proposed for this term. If the diphthong eu is pro-nounced as ef, the result is a reference to the Egyptian goddess Nephthys, the wife of Seth-Typhon (so Plutarch, Isis and Osiris 356A, 375B). Another possibility, proposed by Moraux, isthat the word may derive ultimately from the Coptic, noute, \"god.\"96. A variant of the term IASPHE, perhaps by association with Joseph, the biblical patriarch.IOSETH and IOSEPH appear side by side in the tablet from Beth Shean (no. 77, pp. 168-69).97.

It should be noted, however, that two of thetablet's most famous names turn out to be \"ghosts.\" Ziebarth identified98. The verb enkalein was used of accusations by one party against another; more specifi-cally, it was used of cases in which one party sought to repossess property wrongfully lost to theother. In our text, several pretrial items are mentioned that pertain to the case: the documents(grammata) that were a regular feature of such trials, through which the plaintiff sought toestablish the legitimacy of debts, legacies, or property owed to the prosecuting party. The termtranslated here as \"slaves\" is somata. Since slave owners could sell, loan, rent, or donate slaves,legal disputes regarding ownership were common.99. \"Cooling off\" one's opponents is a common petititon in curse tablets and binding spells.By contrast, anger is often associated with heat. Thus it is not surprising that numerous cursetablets contrast the present heated or emotional state (thumos) of their opponents with thedesired future condition of cooling off.100. Could this be the famous philosopher, whose death in 399 B.C.E. came as a result of acourt action against him? Socrates was certainly a controversial figure in his time and the targetof numerous accusations as one who invented new gods and denied the existence of the old ones(Euthyphro 3b). Elsewhere, he relates that his accusers (kategoroi, a common term in cursetablets of a judiciary character) charge him with being \"an evildoer (adikei) and a curious personwho searches things under the earth and in heaven and makes the worse appear the better cause\"and that he was a teacher who took pay for his instruction (Apology 19b-e).

For this tablet he argues that it belonged originallyto one of the fourth century B.C.E. graves near the Dipylon Gate. Thesheet measures approximately 12 x 7 cm. and was folded into threesections.

They were required to have acitizen as sponsor. Many were quite wealthy and could assume various public duties, thoughnever the highest.107. Strombichus of Eunonymon was trierarch in 357 B.C.E. This office required great wealthin order to furnish and outfit a warship (trireme) for one year; cf. PA 13022 and Davies,Families, p. 163.108. Quite possibly the son of Strombichos in the previous line; cf. Davies, Families, ibid.109. This figure served as parasitos (a priest who served at public expense) in the late fourthcentury B.C.E.; cf. PA no. 10903 and Davies, Families, p. 409.110. Demophilus held a religious office at Eleusis and has been identified with theDemophilus who lodged charges of impiety against Aristotle; cf. Diogenes Laertius, 5.5, andAthenaeus, The Learned Banquet 696a-b. There were, however, other prominent figures of theperiod who bore the same name; cf. Davies, Families, p. 498.111.

Lines 16-19 contain names of women, each followed by the letters laikast (except in thefirst case, where the complete word laikastria is visible, the others are missing between one andfour letters). These lines form part of two columns of names, at right angles to the main textrunning from bottom to top of the tablet. Ziebarth proposed that laikas was a mistaken abbrevia-tion for the deme of the women, lakiadai. L. Robert (pp. 13-14) argued that there are problemswith this reconstruction. First, women did not normally bear a demotic label. Second, a fourfoldmistaken writing of Lakias seems unlikely. Instead, Robert proposes to read laikas as \"prosti-tute,\" an intentional insult hurled at these women by the client. In line with this, Robertreconstructs the letters tera after the first name, Kleinis. If accepted, this would mean that thefirst-named of the women is thus labeled as \"more of a prostitute (than the others).\" Jordaninforms us that the text clearly reads laikastria (\"strumpet\") and that the term was used merely toidentify the women by their profession.113.

Wilhelm tentatively identifies our Phokion with the famous Athenian statesman andgeneral of the mid-fourth century B.C.E. Further, he proposes to connect the curse with distur-bances surrounding a series of calendrical and administrative reforms concerning the offices ofdemarch and treasurer; cf. Wilhelm, pp. 117-18.123. An Ergokrates appears on an inscription (7G 2.2, 1007), dating from the mid-fourthcentury B.C.E.124. Eupheros is the brother of Callistratus of Aphidna, a powerful political figure in Ath-ens; he was finally impeached and condemned to death. Callistratus himself is the target of twocurse tablets (Ziebarth [1934], no. 2; cf. DT63). The first reads simply, \"I bind Callistratos, andall his associates/advocates (sunegorous) I bind.\" The second, a fragment, mentions three Athe-nians (names missing) and \"the accomplices (sundikous) [with Callistjratos.\" Both reflect trialsand, together with our tablet, are probably to be understood as judicial in nature.125. A second brother of Callistratus; cf. Wilhelm, p. 117.126. According to Wilhelm, p. 117, based on two inscriptions (7G 2.1.572 and 2.3.1208),Nikomenes, Euthemon, and Astuphilos were associates in proposing a set of reforms that led toopposition from other parties. In both cases, Nikomenes' name appears along with Euthemonand Astuphilos.127. According to IG 2.1.571 and 572, Euthemon initiated the administrative reforms, fol-lowing difficulties with earlier officeholders. The precise time of these reforms is 368/367 B.C.E.Thus Wilhelm suggests that our curse stems from the same time and circumstances as D T 47-50and 57. Thus, in Wilhelm's judgment, the curse must be attributed to the opponents ofEuthemon and his associates, the ruling elite of the time under the leadership of Callistratus.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the study of work and work-ers. Even more than today, most people spent most of their waking hoursat work—whether as slaves who had no say in the matter and who for themost part received no wages,1 or as free laborers who hired themselves toindependent employers or worked for themselves, as craftsmen, shop-keepers, or professionals of one kind or another. And yet the amount ofliterature on work and workers is utterly disproportionate to their place inancient societies.2 What is more, we seldom catch a glimpse of ancientworkers without the distorting lens of aristocratic and learned observers.3Archaeology can sometimes provide a correction by revealing the central-ity of work, both literally and figuratively, to the ancient city. R. E.Wycherly describes Athenian life as a \"fascinating mixture, from which itis almost impossible to separate the elements. . . . Shops and a law-courtare side by side on the southern edge of the Agora; the shop of Simon theshoe-maker is not far south of the Eponymous Heroes; beneath the Stoaof Attalus, which was a market-hall, are unmistakable traces of a law-court.\"4 Of course, as ancient street and neighborhood names prove,there were also areas where shops predominated—one of our tablets (no.71) turned up among a cluster of buildings in an \"industrial district\"occupied by bronze-workers.Fittingly, Hesiod opens his Works and Days, one of the very fewancient texts on labor, with a discussion of the positive role of strife orrivalry (eris) among various kinds of workers: \"Rivalry stirs up even theshiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers hisneighbor, a rich man, who hastens to plough and plant and put his housein good order. . . . This sort of competition is useful for mortals—onepotter is envious of another; one craftsman of another; one beggar ofanother; one singer of another.\" Hesiod's list of occupations reads like1514"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"152 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldan abbreviated catalogue of those found among the curse tablets. More-over, he describes precisely the sorts of conditions under which we finddefixiones in the ancient workplace—competition and rivalry. When wefurther consider that virtually all of the occupations mentioned on thetablets fall into the category of small-scale, marginal businesses, wheresurvival and success were perennially uncertain, we should not be sur-prised to find individuals who were prepared to seek an advantage forthemselves by cursing or binding the affairs of their nearby competitors.In some of the tablets, where personal names appear together with theoccupation, the underlying cause of tension may concern somethingother than professional issues; the person's occupation may have beenadded merely for the purpose of full identification. However, the factthat the occupation functions like a patronymic (\"son of\") or even ademotic (\"belonging to such-and-such a deme\") is in itself a tellingindicator of the social importance of work. Thus there is an unavoidableelement of uncertainty in our choice of tablets. For instance, a tabletfrom the Kerameikos area of Athens, dated to the late fourth centuryB.C.E., identifies several people by profession: two tavern keepers, astallkeeper, a household slave, and a brothel keeper (SGD 11). Butwhether these occupations have anything to do with the occasion for thetablet is not certain. Other tablets of a similar kind mention a shieldmaker,5 a painter, a flour seller, a scribe,6- a seamstress7 and a shipcaptain.8In other cases, where in addition to the occupation, the tablet binds orcurses the target's labor, products, income, and workplace, there can beno doubt that the root issue was competition between small businessesand their proprietors. Here it is worth noting that all of these tabletsstem from Greece and the Greek colonies in Sicily and that their datesfall exclusively in the classical and Hellenistic periods.9 Whether theselimitations are significant, indicating that tablets of this nature occurredonly in these times and places, or merely accidental, cannot be deter-mined. The earliest can be placed near 450 B.C.E.: one from Sicily ap-pears to condemn a list of names to a downturn in profits10; and one fromAthens identifies its target as a bellows operator in the Athenian mint(no. 72). Once again, the majority of persons belong to the world ofmarginal laborers, some free and some slave—tavern keepers, carpen-ters, metalworkers, potters, prostitutes, and so on. In our selection,there are but two possible exceptions to this rule and both concernphysicians (nos. 79, 81). But in both cases the physicians are the targetsof the tablets, while the status of the client in at least one case (no. 79)seems to point in the direction of slaves or freedmen."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Businesses, Shops, and Taverns  153Among the occupations cited in the tablets, apart from chariot racersand gladiators, the most common is that of proprietors of taverns(kapeleion in Greek; tabernae or popinae in Latin). Of special note hereis the fact that both women and men appear as proprietors and thatwomen seem to have been particularly active as tavern keepers. From anaristocratic and literary perspective, the tavern and its proprietor wereregularly treated with disdain, the very embodiment of disorderly anddishonest low-life in the city.11 Rightly or not, they are often described asbrothels. But for the working patrons of a local pub, the institution musthave served—as has always been true—a whole range of social andpersonal functions that outside observers were simply incapable of dis-cerning. In line with this, it would seem that the frequent use ofdefixiones in and around the tavern demonstrates that important issueswere transacted there.One final observation about the exigencies of certain crafts and theirconnection with cursing. If, as we have argued, curses were deployed insocial and personal conditions of competition and uncertainty, we mightexpect to find an association of curse tablets with occupations character-ized by a high potential for mistake and failure. Ceramics—the makingof pottery through the use of high temperatures—was such an occupa-tion.12 A curious text from the classical period (sixth to fourth centuriesB.C.E.) illustrates the hazards of firing pots as well as some of the custom-ary ways of explaining the frequent disasters.13 The so-called Potters'Hymn includes a passage that is almost certainly based on a once-extantformula for curse tablets against the kilns of rival potters:If you will pay me (Homer is the imagined speaker) for my song, O Potters,then come, Athena, and hold your hand above the kiln. May the cups andcans all turn a goodly black, may they be well fired and fetch the priceasked. . . . But if you (potters) turn shameless and deceitful, then do I sum-mon ravagers of kilns, Suntrips [Smasher] and Smaragos [Crusher] and Asbes-tos [Unquenchable] and Salaktes [Shake-to-pieces] and Omodamos [Con-queror of the unbaked] who cause much trouble for this craft.14 Stamp onstoking tunnels and chambers, and may the whole kiln be thrown intoconfusion, while the potters loudly wail. As a horse's jaw grinds, so may thekiln grind to powder all the pots within it.15 And if anyone bends over to lookinto the spyhole, may his whole face be scorched, so that all may learn todeal justly.In light of this text, it comes as no surprise to find, some five hundredyears later in Pliny's Natural History (28.4.19), immediately followinghis comment that no one was immune to the fear of curse tablets, hisobservation that \"many people (presumably potters) believe that the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"154 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldproducts of potters' shops can be crushed by this means (i.e., cursetablets).\" Similarly, when the second-century C.E. scholar Pollux reportsthat bronze-workers were in the habit of displaying apotropaic devices atthe front of their foundries to protect themselves against envy, surely oftheir rivals, the meaning must be that they used formulaic antidotes toward off dangerous curses from jealous rivals. Conversely, we may alsoassume that failures in the workshop were regularly attributed to success-ful tablets commissioned by hostile rivals.In the final analysis, it is difficult to determine whether defixionesconstituted a regular or merely an occasional feature of the ancientworkplace. This much, however, does seem certain. The claim that \"thereal answer to difficulties in the workshop ... or at the kiln, was not torecite spells, but to apply the fruits of training and experience,\"16 mustbe rejected. Surely this is a false alternative, an unjustified imposition of\"modern\" categories, for the use of spells was also governed by trainingand experience. Far better—and more in line with the few literarysources, too—to conclude that curse tablets and apotropaic defensesagainst them were reckoned among the several proven techniques em-ployed by workers to enhance their chances of success and to explaintheir occasional failures.Notes1. Not all slaves were unsalaried; indeed, some used their wages to eventu-ally buy their freedom; cf. Alison Burford, Craftsmen in Greek and RomanSociety (Ithaca, 1972), pp. 45 and 51. M. Finley, Economy and Society in AncientGreece (New York, 1981), makes the important point that in terms of the variouskinds of work—excluding the \"political\" work of citizens—there was little dis-tinction between slaves and free laborers. Both did every kind of work, althoughslaves predominated in certain occupations, such as mining.2. One notable exception is the book of C.

The exchange here is based on the notion that \"ifyou (gods) give now, I (person) will give later.\" In this case, euangelia,gifts in exchange for good tidings, were promised to the deities after thecompletion of the desired results.

In the first case, the curse is designed to obliterate any memory ofthe person; in the second, the point would be that the person's death is wished or that the cursetablet itself was deposited in a grave.19.

He himselfhas cast a spell54 on a slave girl, against my will,55 in order to take her as hiswife; for this reason she fled along with the others. Lady Demeter, I havesuffered these things and, bereft, I have fled to you. May I find you mercifuland just. See to it that the one who has put me in this condition finds nosatisfaction, whether at rest or in motion, in body or in spirit. Let him find no52. The client must have undertaken certain prescribed ceremonial acts in his approach toDemeter, perhaps privately, perhaps in a local temple of the goddess. Where and when theseacts would have been performed is not indicated, but the terms themselves underscore theimportance of presupposing a set of actions to accompany the preparation and depositing ofdefixiones, even when they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.53. Whether Epaphroditus himself was a slave is not known. It is worth noting thatepaphroditos might also be taken as an adjective, \"a certain handsome fellow.\" In any case, wehave a most unusual example in the tablet of someone organizing slaves to abandon their owner/master.54. The Greek verb is sunapothelgesthai (though the text is not clear at this point), based onthe root thelk-, used for charms and spells as early as Homer (e.g., Odyssey 3.264).55. Homolle suggests, without discussion, that the client himself may have wanted or en-joyed the slave girl as his lover, so that jealousy would have added fuel to the sense of social andeconomic injustice."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Businesses, Shops, and Taverns  167help from male or female slaves, from the small or the great.56 If he under-takes something, let him not be able to accomplish it.

Lead tablet measuring 19.5 x 7.5cm.; originally folded. Wiinsch dates it to the third century B.C.E. Nospirits or deities are invoked. The form of the tablet departs from stan-dard models in several respects: the names of the targets appear sepa-rately in the left-hand column; the spell itself fills the right-hand column.The text of the spell may have drawn on literary sources for some of itslanguage. The setting is business competition, expressed here in theclient's feelings that his competitors have enjoyed certain unspecifiedadvantages. As such, the tablet also expresses a wish for justice andvengeance. Bibl.: Wiinsch (1900), no. 1, pp. 233-35; DT92.(Column A)BittalosBakionZogenes . . . (istirake)60Bakion56. The punishment anticipated here is of the eye-for-eye variety in return for the harmEpaphroditus had inflicted on the client. The loss of all slaves would have been a \"cruel blow\" ina slave-dependent society.57. The Greek term here is the familiar katadesmos.58. Once again, the punishment is designed to reflect the harm done by Epaphroditus—totaldomestic disruption. The focus here is strikingly evocative of rural life: noises of the household,food and eating, planting and harvesting of crops.59. Clearly the client and his wife were suffering as much from shame and loss of honor, as aresult of being mocked publicly for their misfortunes, as from the loss of servants and their laborin the fields.60.

But\"lord angels\" are also addressed, and the spell is full of Semitic and Egyp-tian names. The spell seeks to bind the psychological and physical capaci-ties of one man and two women; the verbs are compounded for effect, ex-tending from the simple deo to the more vivid katadesmeuo.

Italy, Rome; from a grave near the Porta Adreatina. Lead tabletmeasuring 10.4 x 3.5 cm.; the Greek text is written in two columns.Guarducci, the original editor, places it in the third century C.E., per-haps between 270-285 C.E., based on references in the text. The spir-its addressed appear only at the end of the spell. They are addressedby their mysterious, secret, and holy names; some are familiar, whileothers are unprecedented. The curse involves the following elements:a Greek physician in the Roman army; two brothers who served asassistants to the physician, one of whom has died, while the other isprobably the client who commissioned the tablet; and the curse, bornof anger and frustration, against the land of Italy and the gates ofRome. Bibl.: M. Guarducci, \"LTtalia e Roma in una tabella de-fixionis greca recentemente scoperta,\" Bulletino della commissionearcheologica comunale di Roma 74 (1951-1952): 57-70; BE (1955):no. 292; SEG 14.615; Guarducci, Epigrafia greca, pp. 251-54; SGD129 (text).Restrain Artemidoros the physician, of the Third Praetorian Cohort. Thebrother of the deceased Demetrios, who has worked as his assistant, nowwishes to depart to his own country.78 Do not permit him,79 but restrain the75. A closely parallel set of voces appears on a tablet from North Africa (see no. 82).76. The reconstructed Greek word is probably to be read as ergastillarion, reflecting theLatin word ergastularius, which in turn designated the person in charge of the workhouse{ergastulum). The ergastulum itself was a notorious institution, reserved for unruly slaves andnoted for its harsh conditions. Whether or not it was an actual work site or simply the buildingwhere fettered slaves were quartered, it was used by Roman authors to express the lowest formof human living. Columella, the author of a treatise on agriculture (first century C.E.) writes asfollows: \"For those (slaves) who are in chains there should be an underground prison(ergastulum), receiving light through a number of narrow windows built so high from the groundthat they cannot be reached by hand\" (1.6.3).77. The final phrase is uncertain. Apsuchia, meaning lifelessness, could be used as a term fordeath. The verb is lacking. Wiinsch proposes idein, \"to see.\"78. The situation is thus as follows: the client has been serving as an assistant to the physicianArtemidoros; following the death of his brother Demetrius, he now wishes to return to his homecountry; given his brother's name and the fact that Greek is their native tongue, their home laysomewhere east of Rome. The physician has refused to allow the departure, thus prompting thespell by his angry assistant. The brothers were probably slaves.79. This phrase is not clear. The Greek is me easete oun auton. It may mean \"Do not allowhim (the physician)\" to prevent the departure.

The client's name is not80. The curse is addressed against Italy itself, where the disconsolate client must remainagainst his will.81. Here again the text is not absolutely clear. Guarducci has interpreted \"the gates ofRome\" as a reference to the mouth of the Tiber; the verb she takes to mean \"to cause to becomesilted.\" The phrase thus expresses the wish that the lifeline of Rome, the Tiber, should becomeuseless. Robert offers a number of serious objections to this interpretation. Our translationfollows the text as reconstructed by Jordan. In general, the curse is directed against the gates ofRome because they symbolize the client's inability to pass through them on his way home to hisnative land.82.

H. Versnel, in a recent treatment,calls them judicial prayers for help from the gods and argues that theybelong to a category quite different from curses on metal tablets.2 Interms of their occasions, the most distinctive feature of this category liesin the explicit claim that the targets or enemies have somehow wrongedthe client. Sometimes this claim is quite vague (for example, \"I havebeen mistreated!\"), but more commonly the offense is spelled out insome detail, especially in the frequent cases concerning stolen property(see nos. 88, 94-100). In terms of their goals, these defixiones seek bothjustice and revenge—the recovery of the stolen goods as well as punish-ment of the alleged thief. But perhaps their most distinctive trait, asVersnel and others have shown, lies in the quasi-legal transaction thattakes place between the client and the deity invoked3: in virtually everycase concerned with stolen property, the client temporarily transfersownership of the goods in question, sometimes even the culprits them-selves, to the deity and thereby makes their recovery a matter of divinerather than merely human concern. For it is no longer just the human1755"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"176 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldowner, but the gods themselves who have been deprived, offended, anddishonored. This transfer procedure seems generally to have taken placein a local temple, no doubt one associated with a deity known for specialcompetence in hounding thieves. Ownership of the stolen property wasritually, if provisionally, transferred to the deity; the thief was requiredto return the goods to the temple, whence the owner presumably re-claimed them after paying a fee to the deity, that is, to the treasury of thetemple. Behind this legal fiction, we glimpse a pressing need for redressagainst injustice, large or small, in what R. Tomlin aptly calls \"an under-policed world.\"4 Here the patron was no longer the emperor, far tooremote from Roman Britain, or even a local magistrate, but the ever-vigilant and jealous gods themselves.A striking confirmation of this unusual procedure has survived in aseries of \"confessional inscriptions\" from Lydia and Phrygia (Asia Mi-nor) in the second and third centuries c.E.5 In these remarkable texts,individuals who suspected that they had become the target of a plea forjustice—those who have suffered the illnesses and misfortunes spelledout in numerous defixiones—set up tablets either proclaiming their inno-cence, since we may be certain that not all charged were guilty and thatnot all missing property had been stolen, or confessing their guilt, return-ing the property, and praising the power of the god who had trackedthem down. One such text concerns a cloak stolen from the local bath.The victim had apparently lodged his complaint through the medium ofa defixio: \"The god was vexed with the man and after some time had himbring the cloak to the god, and he openly confessed his guilt. Then thegod ordered him, through the agency of an angel, to sell the article ofclothing and to publicize his (the god's) miracles on a stele.6 Anothertext reveals a case of false accusations, which resulted eventually in theexoneration of the accused and the punishment of the slanderers by thegod Men: \"To Men Axiottenos. Since Hermogenes, son of Glukon, andNitonis, son of Philoxenos, have slandered Artemidoros with respect to(the theft/drinking of?) wine, Artemidoros has given a tablet. The godhas punished Hermogenes, who has propitiated the god and from nowon will extol (the god Men).\"7These texts illustrate two important features of pleas for justice inparticular and of defixiones in general: first, they indicate how deeplyrooted was the belief in their effectiveness; and second, they tell us thatthe commissioning of a defixio was not, indeed could not be, an entirelyprivate affair. In other words, the effectiveness of the process was depen-dent to a certain degree on public knowledge that \"a fix\" had beenplaced on a particular suspect.

In some instances, public display in a temple area seemsclear, whereas others have turned up in graves and wells where no onecould read them. But as Versnel rightly observes, there were public andprivate aspects to the proceedings: \"The most obvious—though by nomeans exclusive—procedure may be that the injured party first tries todraw a confession from the suspected culprits and then tells them explic-itly that he is making a higher appeal to the god.\"8Until recently, pleas for justice and revenge represented a modestshare of the total corpus of defixiones. A rough count indicates nineteenin Greek and perhaps twelve in Latin. Since the 1970s, these numbershave increased dramatically, to the point where they now represent byfar the largest single subcategory of all curse tablets and binding spells.The discovery of significant deposits at two British sites, Bath and Uley,has now raised the total in Britain alone to ca. three hundred, virtuallyall of them involving stolen property. Whether this means, as some haveopined, that Britons in the period of late antiquity were especially preoc-cupied with recovering stolen property may be left as an open question.It seems much more likely that the current disproportion generated bythe British tablets reflects nothing more than the hazards of preservationand discovery. What is certain, as Tomlin and Versnel have emphasized,is the remarkable similarity of atmosphere and formulaic language inpleas for justice from widely separated regions of the Greco-Romanworld—Britain, Spain, Italy, and the eastern Aegean. Here again weencounter two recurrent features in the use of curses and spells: theirunmistakably international character and the role of written handbooksor formularies, like the major collections of PGM, from which the spellswere copied and by which they were transmitted from region to region.Like other types of defixiones, pleas for justice and revenge look tothe past as well as into the future. They arise from a perceived wrongalready suffered—sometimes about to happen—while simultaneouslyanticipating future compensation. One subcategory of defixio, however,looks exclusively toward the future. These are curses on gravestones,invoking dire consequences for any who disturb or destroy the burialsite. Here, of course, we encounter an arresting irony, for we now knowthat one of the most common reasons for disturbing a grave site wasprecisely to deposit a defixio inside. But the logic, or better the psychol-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"178 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldogy, seems perfectly straightforward—the acknowledged power of onekind of defixio was deployed against another kind, based on the beliefthan \"mine\" is surely stronger than \"theirs.\"Such curses as those found on gravestones clearly cross the boundarybetween the private and the public sphere. The protection of graves andtombs was a matter not merely of private concern but of public policy aswell.9 There are other differences: they are inscribed on stone or woodrather than on metal sheets; and of necessity they name no specificculprit. They also represent a form of cursing with a remarkably well-attested history of use, reaching from Phoenicia in the eleventh centuryB.C.E. to early modern Europe.10Altogether the few examples given here stand at one extreme of thespectrum covered by curse tablets and binding spells. Still, and thepoint is worth repeating, no subcategory is definitionally pure. Publiclydisplayed curses on ancient gravestones reveal not only common traitswith private defixiones11 but more generally they indicate the untenabil-ity of all traditional distinctions between \"magic\" and \"religion.\" Thuswe conclude with a few instructive examples from R. Lattimore's com-prehensive treatment, Themes in Greek and Latin Epitaphs; their simi-larity to the language and the concerns of defixiones will be readilyapparent.12I put an oath on, you who settle here, to treat this place with properrespect.13I, Idameneus, built this tomb to (my own) glory. May Zeus utterly destroyanyone who disturbs it.14. . . may he be guilty in the sight of all the gods and of Leto and herchildren.15...

The definition is essentially the one proposed by David Jordan in SGD, p.151, with slight modifications.2. H. Versnel, \"Beyond Cursing,\" in Magika, pp. 60ff. Versnel insists onseparating pleas for justice rather fully from defixiones, though he is prepared torecognize a border area where some pleas for justice (he enumerates someeighteen instances of this type) are difficult to distinguish from defixiones.Whether in this border area or in the \"pure type\" of the plea for justice (in thiscategory Versnel is prepared to locate some twenty cases, apart from the Britishtablets), Versnel isolates the following distinctive characteristics: (1) the name ofthe author/client, although such is also the case in many spells concerning sexand love; (2) an argument defending the action; (3) a request that the act beexcused; (4) the appearance of gods other than the usual chthonic deities, al-though \"standard\" defixiones also refer to a wide range of deities and spirits; (5)appeals to the gods through expressions of supplication rather than coercion,although the appeals in the defixiones are by no means always coercive; and (7)the occurrence of terms related to punishment and vindication, such as ekdiko.It should be noted that the use of voces mysticae is not characteristic of pleas forjustice and revenge.3.

It has the sense of transferring something or someone by the act of recording theperson's name under a new heading, in this case the heading of the gods being invoked. Theremay also be a play on the more literal meaning of the verb, \"to engrave,\" that is, on the tabletitself.3. The verb katatithenai conveys the sense of consigning or handing over, often in businessmatters.4. The Greek is kakos, here meaning not \"evil\" but \"able to cause harm.\"5. In DT 38, a tablet from Alexandria (third century C.E.), Hekate appears with Pluto,Persephone, Hermes, and others. Such a full listing of gods and goddesses is unusual.6. The Greek reads theetophagos.1. Although the client claims not to know the identity of the thieves, he appears to knowsomething about them, that they live in a particular part of Athens and are named after thatsection, described here as litos (\"rundown\" or \"inexpensive\"). At two places in the text, uncer-tainty about the theft expresses itself in the phrase \"the thief or the thieves.\"8. The Greek term is katena, borrowed from Latin catena, which probably refers to a chainnecklace.9. The Greek term is sunerga, which can designate tools or other implements.10.

Wiinsch dates it to the first or second century C.E. Both sidesof the tablet contain spells, with some similarities between them but alsodifferences. The absence of names makes it difficult to determinewhether the targets and the occasion are identical on the two sides. Thefigures invoked are addressed by mysterious and secret names. Amongthe recognizable deities on Side A are Althaia, Kore, Hekate, andSelene (the Moon); on Side B, Selene and Hekate. According toWiinsch, Hekate is the chief figure of the spell, the others being identi-fied with her. In addition to the obvious Greek themes on Side A, thereare indications of Jewish elements as well. Bibl.: Wiinsch, DTA, pp.xiii-xiv; DT41; Wiinsch, Antike Fluchtafeln, no. 1, pp. 4-7; H.

Panaition could be read as a proper name (well attested as such) or as an epithet of thespirit (\"cause of all things\").14. Of the two binding words used here, katagraphein and anathematizein, the former ap-pears frequently in Greek defixiones, whereas the latter is used exclusively in Jewish and Chris-tian sources. In Deuteronomy 13:15 (LXX), it describes an oath taken by Israelites against thosewho introduce foreign rites. In his letters, Paul employs the form anathema as a curse formulaseveral times (1 Corinthians 12:3; 16:22; Galatians 1:8; Romans 9:3). Each time it designates apowerful oath, consigning the target to death.15. Althaia in mythological tradition was the mother of Meleager and wife of Oeneus.Pausanias reports the following story of her in describing a famous painting by Polygnotos: \"Asto the death of Meleager, Homer says that the Fury heard the curses of Althaia and that this wasthe cause of Meleager's death\" (10.31.3). Althaia's success thus made her a likely candidate forselection by someone who wished to enlist powerful \"cursers\" at a later time.16.

Like the monuments ofHerodes Atticus, which it resembles, this one is not a burial inscriptionbut a warning designed to protect private property, in this case an instal-lation of baths. But Amphicles has modified the text of his models in amost extraordinary way, by adding numerous allusions to the Septuagintand by deleting all traces of paganism.25 Thus the author of our inscrip-17. The Greek is logois hekatikois horismasi abraikois. The occurrence here of abraikos(hebraikos) confirms the earlier use of anathematizein as evidence of Jewish influence of somesort in the history of the spell's development.18. This must mean fevers, a common \"wish\" in curses.19. Side B is more fragmentary than A. It also lacks terms of Jewish origin. From whatremains, Wiinsch concludes that the lengthy series of epithets attached to Hekate must havederived from a Greek hymn.20. A common epithet of Hekate in her capacity as guardian of crossroads; it should benoted that the text is not certain. On the goddess in general see Sarah Johnston, Hekate Soteira:A Study of Hekate's Roles in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature (Atlanta, 1990).21. The Greek terms are kolaseis, poine, and timoria. Versnel (p. 65, n. 26) proposes thatkolaseis in particular refers to punishments in the afterlife and that it has the meaning here of\"hell.\"22. This is presumably the title or label for the tablet itself, \"this is a/the curse.\"23. This inscription and its twin are printed in IG XII, fasc. 9, 955 and 1179 (incorrectly listedas 1170 in Robert, p. 245, n. 30).24. The view that Amphicles must be seen as a disciple of Herodes is developed by Robert,pp. 246-53. Philostratus, in his Lives of the Sophists 2.8 and 10, mentions an Amphicles ofChalcis as a favored pupil of Herodes. It must be noted, however, that the primary evidence forthe connection between Herodes and the author of these two monuments is the \"close parallels\"in their texts. A close reading of the Herodes monuments, however, does not suggest suchparallels. Those parallels that do exist are stock formulas, which might have come about from anumber of sources, including collections of curse formulas available for purchase in the region.25. Robert notes the following modifications: the opening appeal \"to the gods and heroes,\"found in parallel versions has been dropped and been replaced by the singular \"god\"; themention of the Erinyes, Grace (Charts), and Health (Hygieia), taken by some as proof that theinscription is pagan, is dismissed as mere moral personifications with no pagan implications; theuse of the verb eulogein (\"may he fare well\") recalls the recurrent use of the root eulog-throughout Deuteronomy; and epikataratos (\"There shall be a curse upon . . .\"), though at-tested in purely pagan texts, is probably derived here from Deuteronomy 28:18-19."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Pleas for Justice and Revenge  185tion was as an aristocrat of an important Greek city, a disciple of themost famous public figure in the Greece of his day, and in some sense a\"Judaizing\" Gentile. One lesson he had learned from his contacts withJudaism was the knowledge that the text of the Bible could be used as asource book for potent curses. The reference to the curses of Deuteron-omy recalls the Jewish gravestones from Acmonia (see no. 91), whichinvoke \"the curses written in Deuteronomy\" upon anyone who shouldviolate the burial site.

Greece, Rheneia (small island facing Delos); used primarily as theancient cemetery of Delos. A marble tablet, measuring 31 x 42 cm.29 Thesame text is carved on both sides; at the top, two hands reach upward insupplication toward heaven30 (Figure 21). Unlike other curses in thisvolume, this tablet was a public document, meant to be seen and read bypassersby. Such was the regular practice in relation to curses both forprotecting graves from disturbance by robbers and for seeking justice for26. This series of misfortunes is taken word for word from the Greek text (LXX) of Deuter-onomy 28: 22 and 28.27. The Greek term is episkopous.28.

Raised hands on a stone monument from the Greek island ofRheneia near Delos, inscribed with a plea for vengeance in the death of a Jewishwoman. The cause of her death was not known, although the text of the inscrip-tion makes it clear that her relatives suspected that spells or poisons had beenused.those who had died in an untimely or violent manner. The letters indicatea date in the second century B.c.E.31 Because of clear allusions to biblicalpassages from the Septuagint (LXX), interpreters of the tablet havegenerally taken it to be Jewish. While such a view is clearly possible, itmust now be recognized that a second biblical community resided atDelos, namely, Samaritans,32 and that a Samaritan origin must also beconsidered.33 The text is an appeal for vengeance and justice in relation31. See the discussion in Deissmann, pp. 432-34.32. See the discussion in A. T. Kraabel, \"New Evidence of the Samaritan Diaspora HasBeen Found on Delos,\" Biblical Archaeologist 147 (March 1984): 44-46; Kraabel also discussesevidence for Jews on Delos.33. Bergmann (pp. 507-6) has shown that prayers for vengeance in connection with thedeath of young persons was not uncommon. He cites a strikingly similar example from a burialinscription from Alexandria: \"Arsinoe, untimely dead, raises her hands to the highest (hupsis-tos) god and to the one who oversees (epoptes) all things and to Helios and to Nemesis—whoever placed the spells (pharmaka) on her and whoever rejoiced or still rejoices at her death,attack them!\""},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Pleas for Justice and Revenge  187to the untimely death of a young woman, Heraklea. The appeal is ad-dressed to \"the highest god, the lord of the winds and of all flesh and tothe angels of God.\" No other figures are invoked. BibL: A. Wilhelm,\"Zwei Fluchinschriften,\" JOAI4 (1901): Beiblatt, cols. 9-18; A. Deiss-mann, Light from the Ancient East (London, 1911), pp. 423-35; J.

Bergmann argues (p. 509) that the speaker of the plea for justice is the dead womanherself. But the change from first to third person may indicate that the speaker is a survivingrelative of the unfortunate Heraklea.35. The verb, epikalesthai, appears together with the epithet, hupslstos, in several passagesfrom the Septuagint—Sirach 46:5; 2 Maccabees 3:31.36. The verb axioun is used commonly of prayer in Jewish and Christian texts and appearswith epikalesthai in Jeremiah 11:14 (LXX).37. This phrase is based on Numbers 16:22 (LXX); the spirits here indicate heavenly figures,in this case angels.38. The Greek verb here is pharmakeuein. It has usually been taken as indicating death bypoison. But the word was used just as frequently, if not more so, with reference to the casting ofspells. Thus we must consider the possibility that the \"cause of death\" here was not poison but abinding spell. In view of this possibility, we must also reconsider the traditional interpretation,which simply takes for granted that the women were murdered. We know that they died, but thetext, by its use of the phrase \"murdered or poisoned/put under a spell,\" clearly indicates that theprecise cause of their death was uncertain.39. The woman's name on the second tablet is Marthina, a variant of Martha.40. Again a clear allusion to biblical language as illustrated by the Septuagint. Deuteronomy19:10 speaks specifically of not spilling innocent blood; the expression \"innocent blood\" occursby itself several times.41. The notion of exacting vengeance in conformity with the crime is again biblical, thoughnot exclusively so.42. As Deissmann notes, even the extension of punishment to the children of the criminal isbiblical; cf. Exodus 20:5, \"I visit payment for the sins of the fathers on their children.\"43. A common expression in the Septuagint; cf. Job 34:23; 2 Maccabees 12:22.44. The language here is thoroughly biblical. Leviticus 23:29 shows several precise verbalparallels; the text speaks of preparations for the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)—\"Whoever(pasapsuche, as in our text) does not humble himself on this day ...\" Thus Deissmann is led tothe view that the stone tablets were set up in connection with the Day of Atonement. Bergmann(pp. 509-10) rejects this view and argues instead that along with its plea for justice, the tabletproudly proclaims in a public setting both the universality of the god of the Bible and thewidespread appeal of Judaism among pagans of the Greco-Roman world.45.

Several of the spells specify provisionalcurses—that is, the punishments will expire if the target makes good theconditions that led to the curse in the first place.

Bronze tablet measur-ing 8.1 x 5.5 cm. with a hole at the top-middle, possibly for displayingthe tablet in a public location.57 The editor assigns a date between thefirst century B.C.E. and the second century C.E. The deity invoked iscalled \"mother of the gods,\" most probably the goddess Cybele, whosecult center was Phrygia in Asia Minor. The tablet belongs to the com-mon category of pleas for justice in connection with lost or stolen prop-erty. The owner-client temporarily transfers the property in question tothe god so that its recovery and the punishment of the thief become amatter of divine justice and, in this case, of divine prestige as well.Presumably, at least a portion of this donation or transferred propertyremained the permanent possession of the god, that is, of the temple.Bibl.: Christiane Dunant, \"Sus aux voleurs!\" Museum Helveticum 35(1978): 241-44; H. Versnel, \"Beyond Cursing,\" in Magika, p. 74.53. The Greek is emoi d'hosia. The phrase, which appears in several of the tablets fromCnidus (Newton's nos. 82, 84-87, 90-92), recalls the language of a plea for justice from Athens(no. 84). The language suggests some reluctance on the part of the client to undertake the actionof commissioning the defixio, whether because of its illegality, its social unacceptability, orperhaps simply because of its great contagious power. Versnel (p. 73) comments that the formulaalso serves to protect clients in small communities where they might easily find themselves in thecompany of the unknown culprit at the moment when the gods chose to carry out the curse.54. See the similar precautionary formula in a defixio from Italy (no. 92).55. The phrase here is meta ton idion panton.56. The language of this fragmentary tablet suggests that the client belongs to the lowersocial classes, possibly even that he was a slave.57.

Acmonia, in the province of Phrygia, Asia Minor. A burial inscrip-tion, probably of Jewish origin. The date is clearly indicated on the stoneitself as 248/249 C.E. This stone belongs with a number of others from thesame city; together they curse anyone who disturbs the burial site. Allare probably Jewish. On the opposite face of the stone, Aurelius lists hisimportant civic offices: \"stewardship of the marketplace and of cornpurchasing, guardianship of public order; (I have) occupied all the mu-nicipal offices and held the post of strategos.\" This stone, and anotherone from the same place and time,62 recall the curse bowl (see no. 109)from Mesopotamia which uses the formula \"May the following verse (abiblical passage is cited) apply to him or her (the target) ...\" The regionof Phrygia was noteworthy for the use of curses on epitaphs.63 Bibl.: W.M.

The verb anatithenai appears in similar tablets (DT4, line 1, from Cnidus in Asia Minor;see no. 89); on other parallels between our tablet and those from Cnidus, see Dunant, pp. 243-44.59. Following Egger's proposed scenario for the tablet from Innsbruck (no. 101), the clientprobably had the following sequence of events in mind: the tablet itself was nailed up in the localtemple dedicated to the mother of the gods; the goddess would pursue the thieves and punishthem until they decided to return the gold; the lost or stolen property would be returned to thetemple where the owner would redeem it.60. Versnel comments that the goddess's power (dunamis) corresponds to arete (see no. 88)in other tablets where pleas for justice are made in the name of some deity. In all cases, theseterms constitute a public appeal to the known powers of the god or goddess.61. The notion that the goddess will be subject to humiliation if she fails to carry out the chargeis unique in tablets of this kind but probably not to the psychology of curse tablets as a whole.62. MAMA VI, no. 335, which similarly warns anyone who disturbs the tomb that \"thecurses (arai) written in Deuteronomy will come upon him.\" This stone no doubt belongs to thesame period as the one cited previously.63.

The Greek is en to deuteronomio. The reference is undoubtedly to the lengthy series ofcurses spelled out in Deuteronomy 28:15-68. The fact that the inscription of Amphicles ofChalcis cites some of these curses word for word and that Amphicles was himself probably notJewish raises the possibility that our inscription from Acmonia, with its general reference to \"thecurses written in Deuteronomy,\" might not be Jewish."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"192 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World92. Italy; from the region of ancient Bruttium. Bronze tablet measuring10 x 14 cm. A date in the third century B.C.E. seems most likely. Theletters were not carved with a stylus, as was customary, but hammered inwith a chisel. This tablet appeals for the return of stolen property. Theappeal is directed to an unnamed goddess; the names of both the thiefand the client are given; the client promises to donate a portion of thestolen property (clothing and three gold pieces) in return for its returnthrough the agency of the goddess; the thief is to return the stolen goodsto the temple of the goddess; the goddess will bring suffering on the thiefuntil he relents. Beyond these common features, this tablet shows onenovel element—the thief must return not only what was taken but pay apenalty of twelve times its value and an offering of incense.

The word for incense here is tibanos, widely used in religious rites and temples.66. This requirement is without parallel in other tablets.67. The precaution here presupposes not only that the client knows the suspected thief butthat the social circumstances are those of a small, closed society where the two were likely to findthemselves, in the normal course of daily living, under the same roof. Sensibly, Kollura asks thatpunishment not be visited on Melitta when they are together, lest it affect her too.

England, Bath; from the sacred spring whose matron deity was SulisMinerva. Lead alloy tablet measuring 9.9 x 5.2 cm.; written in Latincapitals. The editor proposes a date in the second or third century C.E.for most of the tablets. Altogether some 130 curse tablets have beenexcavated and published; many more remain unexcavated.72 Most dealwith the loss or theft of personal property at the baths themselves,probably taken by bathhouse thieves.73 The missing items included jew-elry, coins, household items, gemstones, and, most of all, articles ofclothing. Most of the clients appear to have come from the lower socialclasses (Tomlin, pp. 97-98). The texts are highly formulaic, obviouslytaken from available handbooks. The general procedures that underliethe purchase and deposition of these tablets are strikingly similarthroughout the Greco-Roman world of late antiquity: the stolen prop-erty is ritually transferred to the appropriate deity, thus involving thegod directly in the loss; normally the suspect is named and sometimesalso the client (at Bath 21 tablets name the client); the client then urgesthe deity to visit various afflictions on the thief, including death, not somuch as punishment but rather as inducement to return the property tothe temple where, presumably, the owner would redeem it for a certain68. The goddess invoked here might be any number of female deities, including Hekate, De-meter, or local goddesses addressed in other Sicilian defixiones; cf. the goddess of Selinus (no. 50).69. The name, meaning \"freedman,\" points to social circles of ex-slaves.70. Spadix can designate a stringed musical instrument, like a lyre (so Comparetti) or thebranch or frond of a palm tree. The latter might be more appropriate here if we see the promisedoffering as a decorative piece.71. The double condition here (\"If . . . if . . .\") makes it clear that the donations and offer-ings in pleas for justice must be taken as provisional. The donation will be made j/the god causesthe property to be returned or otherwise vindicates the wronged party.72. See the remarkable publication of the Bath tablets, a model of philological scholarship atits best and broadest, by Tomlin, pp. 59-278. Tomlin's publication includes a list of all cursetablets from England; a catalogue of all theft-related tablets from outside Britain; a completestudy and catalogue of formulas, key words and phrases, language, and handwriting; and tran-scriptions and reconstructions of the 130 texts, with drawings and full commentary. Tomlin notesthat as many as 500 more tablets remain to be uncovered, based on his assumption that no morethan one-sixth of the spring's deposit has been excavated thus far.73. Tomlin observes that the bathhouse thief was a well-known literary and presumably,social type: cf. Catullus 33, a poem addressed to an \"outstanding\" bathhouse thief; Seneca,Letters 56.2, which speaks of the noise created when one is apprehended in the act; Petronius,Satyricon 30, in a scene where a master beats his slave for having lost his clothing while in thebath; Digest 1.15.3.5, which regulates those paid to watch over clothes in public baths. The cursetablets from Bath and elsewhere suggest that they were more than merely literary (pp. 80-81).In Greek law, such thieves could be executed; in the Digest of Justinian (XLVII.17), they occupya full paragraph, where the penalty is forced labor in the mines."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"194 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldfee.

England, Bath (see no. 94). Lead alloy tablet measuring 7.5 x 5.8cm., written on both sides and folded twice. The editor proposes a datein the second century C.E. Like other tablets from Bath (nos. 4, 61, 62,98, 99), this one employed a \"mysterious\" form of writing: the beginningand the end of each line is reversed so that it reads from left to right.Bibl.: Tomlin, pp. 164-65 (no. 44).(Side A) The person who lifted my bronze vessel is utterly accursed.76 I give(him) to the temple of Sulis, whether woman or man, whether slave or free,whether boy or girl,77 and let him who has done this spill his own blood intothe vessel itself.7874. In no. 54, a woman, Arminia, complains that Verecundius has stolen two silver coins(argentiolos duos). The editors comment that the coins are not likely to be the highly debasedantoniani of the mid-third century, but the double denarius of Caracalla. By implication, then, thecost of a curse tablet would not have been more than two argentiolilantoniani, not a great sum.75. This is the only reference in the Bath tablets to the actual process of copying the formulasfrom a master. In this case, the copyist made several errors, which were subsequently correctedby overwriting, presumably after rechecking the master.76. The Latin term is [e}xconic[tus\\, read by the editor as exconfixus.77. This formula, or variants of it, appears in numerous tablets from Bath and elsewhere,including a curse tablet from Delos dating from between 100 B.C.E. and 100 C.E. (see no. 88); cf.Tomlin, pp. 67-68 and 73. Similar phrases appear also in several other places: (1) the NewTestament, in Paul's letter to the Galatians 3:28: \"There is no Jew and Greek, slave and free,male and female . . .\"; (2) Plutarch, Life of C. Marius 46: \"Plato, when he was about to die,praised his companion spirit and Fortune that he was made a man and not an irrational beast, aGreek and not a barbarian, and beyond this that he had lived in the time of Socrates\"; (3)Diogenes Laertius 1.33 (Thales): \"Hermippus in his Lives refers to Thales the story which is toldby some of Socrates, namely, that he used to say that there were three things for which he wasgrateful to Fortune, that he was made a man and not a beast, a male and not a female, a Greekand not a barbarian\"; (4) Roman legal texts, for example, Justinian, Novella V.2: \"as for theworship of God, there is neither masculine nor feminine, neither free nor slave,\" where Chris-tian influence seems likely; and (5) various Jewish texts, of which the earliest is probably theTosefta (Ber. 7:18): \"Rabbi Judah says, 'One ought to say three blessings every day: blessed is hethat he did not make me a Gentile; blessed is he that he did not make me a woman; blessed is hethat he did not make me a boor.' \" In its origins, the formula is probably Greek, whence itpassed into Jewish circles and thence to Paul. There is no reason to posit Jewish or Christianinfluence on its use in the curse tablets.78.

The hoop of thering bears a secondary inscription, almost certainly later than the first,namely SENICIANE VIVAS IN DE [o], which is a common Christian excla-mation (\"Senicianus, may you live in/with God!\"). The sequence ofinscriptions suggests that the ring had two successive owners or possess-ors, the first a non-Christian and the second a Christian with the nameof Senicianus. Both the ring and the tablet date from between 350 and400 C.E. There is thus a real possibility, though nothing more, that wenow possess not just the report of a lost or stolen ring, on the tablet,but also the ring itself, bearing the same name as the person cited inthe tablet.87 Here is a possible sequence of events, partially spelled outin the customary narrative recorded on the tablet: Silvianus, a non-Christian, lost his gold ring, inscribed with the name of Venus;Senicianus, a Christian, found it and had it inscribed with his ownname and the Christian exclamation; Silvianus learned that a personnamed Senicianus had come into possession of the lost or stolen ring;Silvianus commissioned the tablet and deposited it in the local templeof Nodens; the ring was found some fourteen hundred years later by afarmer ploughing his field.

Corby Finney, who is working on a new study of the ring, kindly informs me that thename of Senicianus is not altogether rare in Christian circles of the period and could in this caserefer to another person. The same name appears on one of the tablets from Bath, where itsbearer is named as a suspect in the theft of silver coins; see no. 96.88. It is clear that the stolen goods were to be returned to the temple of the gods inquestion. In a tablet from Uley in England (see Versnel, p. 88), a woman named Saturninawrites a letter (commonitorium) to Mercury concerning a lost piece of clothing. The thief,\"whether man or woman, slave or free,\" is to return the item \"to the temple mentioned above(i.e., of Mercury).\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"198 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldtablet measuring roughly 7x7 cm. The tablet was not folded; it musthave been deposited in the vicinity of the amphitheater or the nearbytemple of Nemesis. A date in the first or second century C.E. seemslikely. Its original form included two \"handles\" (ansae), one of which isnow missing. The inscription covers eight lines in a cursive script ofordinary Latin. The deity addressed is Nemesis, saluted as \"Lady.\"89The recurrence of the formulaic phrase \"with his own blood and life\"in several tablets from Bath and other sites in England suggests thatthe tablet was prompted by the loss of personal property to a suspectedthief; the client invokes the power of Nemesis to avenge the loss.

The occasion isstolen property, valued by the owner at fourteen denarii. The owner-client is a woman, Secundina. The formulas find close parallels in Latincurse tablets from Britain (see nos. 94-100) and several Greek tablets.Bibl.: L.

She commands you on this;you must bring them to justice.9891. Mercury, who was widely assimilated to the Greek god Hermes, was commonly associ-ated with theft, which explains his appearance in spells against thieves. PGM V, lines 172ff.,prescribes the following spell in order to catch a thief: \"I summon you, Hermes, immortalgod ... I call upon Hermes, finder of thieves ... to grab the thief's throat and bring him intothe open today ...\" What the text in PGM makes clear in this case is that the tablet was to bedeposited together with sacrificial offerings and spoken spells.92. Moltinus is a Celtic deity, whose special concern seems to have been sheep and cattle; cf.Egger, pp. 11-12.93. See Versnel, p. 83, n. 121.94. Franz and Versnel translate \"has stolen 14 denarii or two necklaces.\" They take dmucusas a transliteration into Latin of the Greek draukion/necklace. Egger argues that it representsinstead a Celtic loanword, with different meanings in Latin, among them \"cow.\" The fact thatMoltinus is a Celtic deity lends some plausibility to this argument.95. Cacus and his sister, Caca, were known as fire deities who lived on the Palatine Hill inRome; he is particularly known for having stolen cattle from Hercules. The appropriateness ofsuch an act for the circumstances of our tablet, as interpreted by Egger, is readily apparent.96. As frequently in defixiones, the punishment desired corresponds precisely to the crime;in this case, additional penalties are demanded—separation not only from the stolen propertybut from family and friends as well. What separation means here (death?) is not clear, althoughthe endpoint is obvious, that social pressure should force him to return the stolen property.97. The procedure, here as in similar texts (see no. 92), is for the owner to \"dedicate\" thelost property to the gods, that is, to transfer its ownership to them on a temporary basis, so thatits theft becomes their loss, not just the owner's.98. On punishments in Roman law for theft of cattle, see Egger, pp. 14-15; still open is thequestion whether Secundina appeals to the gods to bring the thief before the Roman court or toexecute punishment themselves. Egger holds that in matters of theft involving relatively smallamounts of property, it made better sense to turn to the gods and their powers than to the courts.Thus the ultimate purpose of the spell is to force the thief to return the stolen property to itsrightful owner in the temple of the gods in question. Such a proceeding makes sense not in aRoman legal framework but rather in a small, rural community where Celtic customs prevailed."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Miscellaneous TabletsAmong the various types of defixiones, the miscellaneous examples col-lected in this chapter are surely the most arbitrary. Perhaps they shouldbe labeled as \"personals.\" Of course, all curse tablets and binding spellsare personal by definition, in the sense that they represent a ritual me-dium whereby individual persons sought redress or advantage againstother persons. In short, every defixio, of whatever sort, could be in-cluded among those brought together in this chapter.Those actually located here meet one simple, if negative criterion:they fail to reveal enough information regarding their original causes orcircumstances in order to qualify for one of the more precise categories.Put differently, the eclectic group of tablets in this chapter reminds usthat our other categories (competition in public arenas; sex and love;legal and political affairs; business rivalries; and pleas for justice andrevenge) do not completely exhaust the possibilities for strong emo-tional feelings, for personal conflict of various kinds that reveal them-selves in ancient defixiones. For most of the tablets discussed here, just alittle more information might enable us to relocate them to a differentchapter. Still, there must have been some expressions of anger, jealousy,lust, and revenge that arose at less well-defined moments in the personallives of our men and women. Thus some of the tablets in this chapterwould probably remain here no matter what additional information wemight learn about their original causes.102. Greece, Attica; Original location uncertain.

The Greekwriter, Athenaeus, who wrote his The Learned Banquet at the end of the third century C.E.,states that Philetairos, a poet and author of comedies, wrote a comedy entitled Kunagis/TheHuntress (587-88) in which he mentions a courtesan by the name of Galene, and that Alexis, acomedian of the same period, wrote a piece entitled Polykleia, taken from the name of acourtesan (642c).

Behind this appeal, according to Harrauer (p. 57), lies an allusion to an important themefrom Greek mythology; Zeus decreed that Persephone, the \"queen\" of the underworld, couldnot lay exclusive claim to the handsome Adonis but would have to share him equally withAphrodite. Thus the idea at work in the spell runs as follows: \"Just as Adonis/Meliouchos isforced by Persephone (a familiar figure in spells; here also called Ereschigal) to come to Aphro-dite, so she must send Annianos to lonikos.\" Behind the notion of gathering up the limbs ofMeliouchos there must also lie an allusion to the story of Isis who, following the dissemination ofOsiris's dismembered body, traveled around and reassembled every part but his genitals.22.

But the great likelihood is that thesurvivors, too, had fortified themselves against \"anything harmful\" byputting on their engraved stones or their inscribed sheets of metal andpapyrus. To be sure, 2 Maccabees does not offer the sort of hard demo-graphic data preferred by modern social scientists, but the fact remainsthat in this randomly chosen sample of ancient Jews, every one wore anamulet, as did virtually every sensible person of the time.We would be committing a serious methodological error if we failed tobalance our presentation of curse tablets and binding spells with a brieflook at the repertoire of available countermeasures—phylacteries, anti-dotes, and amulets, as they are variously called. The result of such anomission would be an unacceptably, even unimaginably paranoid culturewhose inhabitants would have been conscious not just of being underconstant assault from defi%iones commissioned by personal enemiesknown and unknown but, worse still, feeling utterly defenseless and with-out recourse.1 At another level, such a mistake would lend unwelcomesupport to the widespread view that the use of spells and counterspells218Antidotes andCounterspells7"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Antidotes and Counterspells  219represented nothing more than a grab bag of traditional techniques, inef-fective, limited to the \"superstitious\" lower classes, and without furthersignificance for our understanding of the ancient world at large. Such hascertainly been the predominant view. But once we complete our dynamicsystem by introducing amulets and counterspells, we not only undercutthis view but at the same time open up the way to appreciating thesetechniques—in the words of Peter Brown—as elements \"in the way inwhich men have frequently attempted to conceptualize their social rela-tionships and to relate themselves to the problem of evil.\"2 More particu-larly, we begin to see in them a strategy for dealing with social aggressionand personal failure. In short, defixiones and amulets emerge, when seentogether, as far more than simple coping mechanisms. They behave in-stead rather like traces in an X-ray, to borrow another phrase fromBrown,3 which point to powerful but invisible systems operating beneaththe surface. For, as Hildred Geertz has argued, such practices make senseonly \"within the framework of a historically particular view of the natureof reality, a culturally unique image of the way in which the universeworks ... a hidden conceptual foundation for all of the specific diagno-ses, prescriptions and recipes.\"4 Thus, she continues, the historian mustrecognize \"the fact that a particular notion is set within a general patternof cultural concepts, a conventional cognitive map, in terms of whichthinking and willing, being anxious and wishing, are carried out.\"5Amulets were called periapta and periammata—\"things tied around\"parts of the body, usually the neck, an arm, or a leg.6 These objectsmight be simple pieces of string; colorful embroidered bands; engravedstones and rings; or strips of metal, papyrus, and other materials in-scribed with special formulas, then rolled up or folded and carried abouton a string, in a pouch or in tubular containers. Thousands of suchstones and strips have survived,7 along with a considerable literature ontheir uses and preparation.8 As the selected items below make abun-dantly clear, amulets were prepared and sold by specialists who pro-duced them according to traditional recipes and consecrated themthrough ritual acts, thereby endowing them with effective power. C.Bonner cites a text of the Neoplatonic philosopher, Hermeias (sixthcentury C.E.) that illustrates the essential part of the process:We have explained how the soul is inspired. But how is an image inspired?The thing itself cannot respond to the divine, since it is lifeless; but the artof consecration purifies its matter and, by attracting certain marks andsymbols to the image, first gives it a soul by these means and makes itcapable of receiving a kind of life from the universe, thereby preparing it toreceive illumination from the divine.\"9"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"220 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient WorldNot every ordinary user would have been able to recite this theory, butsomething like it must have served as the cognitive map that gave amuletstheir power. Certainly, we find many of these \"marks and symbols\"—signs, figures, and charakteres—on both defixiones and amulets. To-gether, the acts of consecration, engraving, or inscribing were taken asproof that amulets possessed special virtues of protection.In practical terms, the purposes of amulets were rather simple. Mostserved to shield the bearer from all forms of harm and danger. By exten-sion, that is by virtue of their ability to ward off unforseen disasters, somealso guaranteed success and prosperity.10 And not surprisingly, in a culturewithout aspirin or antibiotics, many aimed at protecting against commonmedical problems—digestive disorders, fevers, eye problems, scorpionbites, and various gynecological disorders.11 In a few cases, we find amu-lets that functioned exactly like defixiones: love stones designed to attractor separate lovers12; a thumokatochon intended to subdue the anger of apersonal enemy13; and several aggressive stones designed to harm or killan opponent.14 At least one stone appears to have been employed specifi-cally to ward off the powers of defixiones.15 Overall, it appears that amu-lets, like the bowls from Mesopotamia, originally served a singlepurpose—to protect the owner from a wide range of known and unknownevils; however, across time their uses expanded to cover other needs, sothat the boundary lines between bowls, amulets, and defixiones graduallydisappeared.But who made use of amulets? In raising the question, we come upagainst a major issue regarding our general understanding of late an-tique culture. Do amulets—and their attendant beliefs and assumptionsabout how the world works—represent a basic and universal feature ofthat culture or just \"an unswept corner of odd beliefs, surroundingunsavoury practices?\"16 For an answer we may turn to Pliny the Elderand recall his observation that \"there is no one who is not afraid ofcurses and binding spells.\"17 If this is so, we have our answer—everyoneused amulets. What is more, given the conventional cognitive map ofthat world, it would have been foolish and unreasonable to behaveotherwise. A list of oracular questions from Egypt (third or fourth cen-tury C.E.) may indicate just how widespread was the need for protec-tion.18 Along with a list of possible queries about the seeker's currentcircumstances (\"Is my property to be sold at auction?\" \"Shall I become acity councillor?\") appears the following question: \"Am I under a spell(pepharmakomai) ? \"To be sure, we hear occasional voices of protest and dissent. But theyare just that, protests against universal assumptions and practices."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Antidotes and Counterspells  221Among Christians, Gregory of Nazianzen insisted, in a baptismal ser-mon, that his flock had no need of amulets and spells, but most of hislisteners probably remained unconvinced. Among Jews, the author of 2Maccabees may have felt that amulets belonged to the forbidden prac-tices of the wicked Amorites, but soldiers on the front line still took thenecessary precautions, while the supposedly \"rigorist\" Rabbis not onlyallowed but prescribed amulets for a variety of purposes right down tothe present day.19 Among philosophers, Plotinus seems to presupposethat spells worked on all souls, except those of the wise, but he is anotable exception among his peers.20 Far more representative of lateantique philosophers was lamblichus, whose theurgical treatise, On theMysteries of Egypt, shows just how respectable such matters had be-come. Finally, among physicians, even the most empirical found them-selves unable, or unwilling, to break entirely with a system that seemedto work. The noted physician Galen, for instance, prescribed the use ofamulets, even while denying traditional explanations for their success.21Galen's dilemma regarding amulets—they seem to be effective, eventhough his empirical medical theory allowed no room for them—promptsus to ask whether amulets really worked.22 Before answering the questiontoo hastily, and thereby falling once again into the Frazerian trap, we needto rephrase it slightly, for it is impossible to answer the question at allunless we know with greater precision what amulets were expected to do.What we need to ask is, Against whom or what did amulets offer protec-tion? If we take our cue from Tambiah's observations that the audience ofa ritual is identical with its performer23—in our case, the client—and ifadditionally we read the external threats and dangers as projections, atleast in part, of the client's own internal condition, we find ourselvesasking what it is in the client's life that the amulet represents and protects.Viewed in this setting, the answer to our reformulated question wouldhave to include the following components: (1) the amulet itself, as aconcrete physical object, shows forth the wearer's embeddedness in aconcrete social system of exchanges between human actors; (2) as a pro-tective device, the amulet points to an awareness that all social systemsdepend on an active yet invisible network of feelings, beliefs, and atti-tudes, whose particular feature here emerges as aggressiveness, hostility,and unpredictability; (3) from a dynamic perspective, these negativeforces can add up to so many reasons not to act, to withdraw into thesafety of solitude, to remain frozen; and (4) the protective function ofamulets can thus be seen to embody a counterstrategy of individual ac-tion, undergirded by feelings of self-confidence, optimism, and the abilityto formulate and achieve goals."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"222 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient WorldThe Freudian analyst and anthropologist, Geza Roheim, has framed asimilar explanation in his provocative reformulation of Freud's essen-tially negative view of \"magic.\"24 Beginning with a redefinition of magic(the term is Roheim's) as \"the counterphobic attitude, the transitionfrom passivity . . . (and) probably the basic element in thought and theinitial phase of any activity,\"25 he concludes that we must postulate athird or magical principle that deals with the world as if it were governedby our wishes or desires or emotions.\"26 Seen in this light, the amuletbecomes the physical token of Roheim's \"counterphobic attitude,\" thebelief that we can achieve something despite all of the evidence to thecontrary. In Freudian terms, the fearsome world of spirits against whichthe amulet offers protection represents the inhibiting, pessimistic, inter-nal voice of the superego, urging caution and warning of failure, whilethe amulet itself manifests the countermove of the ego, the transitionfrom passivity to activity. Perhaps this is what Malinowski had in mindwhen he spoke of \"magic\" as \"the embodiment of the sublime folly ofhope, which has yet been the best school of man's character.\"27This brief excursion into Freudian theory leads us finally to the gods,spirits, and daimones invoked as protective agents in the amulets. Ourexcursion, and perhaps common sense as well, would lead us to expect asomewhat different set of agents from those invoked in the defixiones,inasmuch as the purpose of amulets was to overpower the force and, byimplication, the agents of the defixio. As we shall see, this intuition proveslargely correct, even taking account of differences due to different localesand changing tastes.28 By and large, defixiones call upon chthonic figuresand spirits of the dead, whereas amulets tend to invoke composite figureswith solar connections (for example, the snake-legged god with cock'shead), unmistakably solar deities, and, to a significantly greater degree,Egyptian gods. Some figures show up on both sides—for example, Her-mes and Hekate appear on amulets—whereas the omnipresent Demeteron defixiones is virtually absent from the amulets. Elements common toboth include the following: Jewish terms (for example, IAO and SABAOTH);charakteres and vowel series; many of the common voces mysticae; andcertain designs such as the headless daimon and trussed mummies.Notes1.

On liliths, their powers, and their reputations, see Neusner, pp. 235-36, and the fuller ac-countinR. Patai, The Hebrew Goddess (New York, 1967),pp. 180-225. Liliths were sexually vora-cious creatures, mostly female though sometimes male, who joined with their gender opposites attimes of special vulnerability—during menstruation, after childbirth, at night, and so on. Thepicture of these figures as sexually voracious finds its psychological complement in their mur-derous assaults on the children and mates of their human paramours. In all, the female lilith mustbe seen as the counterpart of the \"sons of god\" in Genesis 6. At some point, probably in the secondcentury C.E. , the belief arose that the only technique for dealing with them was to treat them as ifthey were \"married\" to their human lovers and to dismiss them by legally valid bills of divorce. Onthe legal background of divorce procedures in rabbinical circles, see Levine, pp. 348-50.18. Here we follow the translation of Harviainen, who takes raz as referring to the bowlitself, together with its spell. The mythological notion here, according to Harviainen (p. 16), isthat the bowl in the house is a miniature representation of the cosmic bowls (the cosmos itself)buried in heaven and on earth. As such it partakes of cosmic powers against the forces of evil.19.

The use of these formulas and of Rabbi Yehoshua'sname is certainly Jewish in origin, though they may have spread to non-Jewish bowls as well. As for Rabbi Yehoshua himself, who appears tohave lived early in the first century B.C.E., he is cited in the Mishnah20and reappears—anachronistically—in later Rabbinic literature as onewho taught Jesus.21 The rudiments of his story are as follows: among theJews of Babylonia in the sixth century C.E., long after his death, RabbiYehoshua developed a reputation for his knowledge and control of super-natural powers; his authority was put to use by the creators of bowls as ameans of controlling harmful female spirits; they were subjected to au-thoritative bills of divorce and banned as though they were illicit wives;the same reputation probably explains the historically impossible linkwith Jesus, who was known independently in Jewish tradition as a sor-cerer, that is, as one who exercised power over spirits. One importantprinciple regarding interactions between humans and spirit-demonsemerges with unusual clarity through this bowl and requires special atten-tion here. By and large it has been assumed that these spirit-demonsinvaded humans on their own initiative. In the period of late antiquity,however, it would appear that this independent initiative and willfulnesshad been brought under human control in the sense that the behavior ofspirit-demons came to be regarded almost exclusively as the result ofcurse tablets and binding spells. In other words, they were understood asa potential source of power, for good or evil, but they became actual onlywhen summoned or invoked by widely known, \"approved,\" and avail-able techniques.

This interjection underlines the importance of names in ritual practices of all kinds. Butat the same time, it underscores the continuity of that importance with the role of names in manyother domains of human activity, in this case the legal sphere, where a bill of divorce was validonly if it could name the defendant. In this case, the first attempt to divorce the lilith had failedbecause her name had not been known. In the meantime, says the text, a new decree thatincluded her name had appeared.

These two terms suggest a mixed society of Jews and pagans, not at all surprising inMesopotamia, although the redundant character of the language of the spells may indicate thatthe terms do not refer to separate entities.30. The sense here is that demons and evil spirits are warned not to transgress against thepower of the angels whose power, through their names, has been invoked against them.31. The precise meaning of the sentence is not clear. The general sense is that the incantationwill be effective because it is based on the professional's knowledge of the proper links andsympathies between earth and heaven. Here these links are embodied in the secret names of theangels. Compare the formula in Amulet 1, lines 12-13: \"I (the professional) have written; Godwill heal.\"32. Again, these two sentences seem to provide reassurance for the client that the profes-sional has the ability to detect curses (that is, to hear the voice of earth) and to bring about thedesired response from heaven.

An amulet of unknown date and origin; oval stone (carnelian)meant to be worn in a metal setting or carried in a pouch of some sort. 13x 20 cm. The stone belongs to a subtype that consists exclusively, orlargely, of text; this one bears no images (Figure 29). Both the front andthe back are covered with inscriptions; in addition, a third inscriptionappears on the edge or rim. Apart from the usual number of vocesmysticae, the names on the stone are exclusively Jewish. Thus we callthis object Jewish, although similar formulas also appear on Christianamulets. The purpose of the stone was to protect its owner from unspeci-fied misfortunes, which are commanded \"not to approach (the owner)\"and \"not to disobey the name of god.\" The name of god is no doubtidentical with the voces mysticae.

Together with four otherlead tablets, all in fragmentary condition, this one was found rolled upand pierced by a single nail. The original size was approximately 11.3 x31.6 cm. The original editor, W. S. Fox, assigns them to the mid-firstcentury B.c.E.54 The Latin texts of the five tablets are almost identical andwere inscribed by the same scribe, clearly using a common model. Noclear occasion is indicated, though personal enmity of some sort seemsmost likely. The deities invoked are the familiar figure of Persephone,here in her Latin version as Proserpina; next, her husband Pluto, thetraditional lord of the underworld; and finally, the much less commonfigure of Cerberus.55 Cerberus is the otherwise well-known \"hound of49. Perhaps derived from Aramaic mry f (\"my lord, come!\")-50. The editors note that the numerical value of the letters in the three preceding words is2662, that is, a palindrome. Similarly, the value of the following word is 3663, also a palindrome.51. The editors argue that these two letters are probably a false start for the verb at the endof the line, apallaxete (\"cure\").52. Frequently this series of vowels was written out in pyramid or ladder fashion; so PGM I,lines 13-19.53. At this point, as in the two earlier occurrences of the phrase, a new invocation wasapparently meant to be copied. Space for a few additional lines remains at the bottom of thesheet.54. Fox also concludes from various characteristic spellings that the persons involved in thespell represent \"the lowest classes of the population\" (Fox, Tabellae, p. 35). If true, however,this would apply to the professional who prepared the tablets and not necessarily to the clients.55. Cerberus appears in no other Latin defixio. Fox, Tabellae, notes, however, that thefigure of Cerberus appears in two Greek tablets from Attica (DT74, line 5, and DT75A, line 9).In both cases, it is called phulax or \"guardian.\" Other figures mentioned in both texts includeHermes, Hekate, Pluto, and Persephone, all standard denizens of the underworld. Cerberus alsoappears in PGM IV, lines 2264 and 2294, as part of a lengthy invocation to the Moon, written iniambic trimeter; it appears again in line 2861, this time in an invocation to the Moon in dactylichexameters.

Two features of this tablet deserve special mention: first, theclient promises a set of sacrificial offerings to Cerberus, provided that thecurse is carried out by a certain date; and second, the tablet contains oneof the most complete listings of anatomical parts known to us. They areclustered by groups with a view to incapacitating and afflicting certainanatomically \"appropriate\" actions of the target, named Plotius. BibL:W. S.

Hand him over to Pluto, yourhusband. May he not be able to escape this (curse) by his wits. Hand himover to fevers—quartan, tertian and daily57—so that they wrestle andstruggle with him. Let them overcome him to the point where they snatchaway his soul. Thus I give over to you this victim,58 O Proserpina orAcherusia59 if you prefer that I call you so. Summon for me the triple-headed hound60 to snatch away the heart of Plotius.61 Promise that youwill give him three victims (gifts)62—dates, figs, and a black pig—if hecompletes this before the month of March.

The Latin terms here are vires and virtutes, which might be translated any number ofways.57. Cf. DT74, line 6, with which our tablet shows other similarities.58. The term victima is normally used of animal sacrifices but seems to be applied here to thehuman target, Plotius. Alternatively, the victim may designate an offering made at the time ofdepositing the tablet.59. Acheron was the name of the river located at the mythical entrance to Hades; thus itmight also be translated as \"of the underworld.\"60. Here as elsewhere, Cerberus's name is not mentioned; yet its description as \"triple-headed\" was quite common.61. Among other attributes, Cerberus was known as a devourer of human flesh; cf. Hesiod,Theogony 311: \"Cerberus who devours raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades.\"62. Three gifts, no doubt, for the three heads; customarily, underground deities preferredpigs, especially black ones.63. The idea seems to be that the client will offer the gifts to Proserpina who would in turnconvey them to Cerberus."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"242 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient WorldProserpina Salvia, I give over to you the eyelids of Plotius.Proserpina Salvia, I give over to you the pupils of Plotius.64Proserpina Salvia, I give over to you the nostrils, lips, ears,nose, tongue, and teeth of Plotius, so that he may not be able to say whatis causing him pain; the neck, shoulders, arms, and fingers, so that hemay not be able to aid himself in any way; his breast, liver, heart, andlungs, so that he may not be able to discover the source of his pain; hisintestines, stomach, navel, and sides, so that he may not be able to sleep;his shoulder blades, so that he may not be able to sleep soundly65; his\"sacred organ\" so that he may not be able to urinate; his rump, anus,thighs, knees, shanks, shins, feet, ankles, heels, toes, and toenails, so thathe may not be able to stand by his own strength.

Let himperish miserably. Let him leave life miserably. Let him be destroyed mis-erably. Take care of him so that he may not see69 another month.64. This extraordinary list of body parts moves more or less systematically from head to toe.Following the initial listing of separate parts, the succeeding groups of parts culminate in anaffliction to which they are immediately relevant—for example, the speech organs are affectedso that the target cannot express his suffering and so on.65. Here the person copying made a mistake, as is clear from the parallel passages in theother tablets. Having omitted \"shoulder blades\" from the preceding list, the copyist made up anew phrase (\"not sleep soundly\") rather than leave them out altogether.66. The formula s(e)ive . . . s(e)ive, reminiscent of similar phrases from the tablets of Bath,indicates once again the legal flavor and atmosphere found in many defixiones.67. The verb mandavit might also mean that the tablet was deposited in the proper locationor handed over to some other person.68. As this line indicates, the client knew that Plotius had previously commissioned his ownspell against the client. Thus our tablet is a counterspell. As such it constitutes importantevidence for the public character of spells and counterspells. They were clearly not completelyprivate or secret actions. Indeed, we must suppose that some public knowledge was essential totheir effectiveness. Fox, Tabellae (p. 46) translates these difficult lines as follows: \"In whatmanner he has according to the laws of magic composed any curse (i.e., against me) andentrusted it to writing, in like manner do I consign him to thee.\" The underlying Latin reads:seive plus, seive paruum scriptum fuerit, quomodo quicquid legitime scripsit, mandauit, seic egoPloti tibi trado, mando.69. As is typical of spells and prayers, the text uses three different verbs (aspicere, videre,contemplare) to express the same idea."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"8TestimoniesIn this chapter, we endeavour to collect all references to defixiones fromvarious types of ancient literature—histories, fiction, drama, philosophi-cal and theological treatises, encyclopedias, Christian saints' lives, legalcodes, poetry, manuals of various kinds (including those for producingdefixiones), and even public inscriptions. In addition to the tablets them-selves, these references testify to the broad and deep dissemination ofdefixiones in a variety of ancient societies.By and large, the materials in the present collection may be said tospeak for themselves. And yet, ancient texts never speak by themselves,which explains in large part why so little has been heard from defixionesin modern scholarship. Ancient voices come to life only through theactive intervention of the modern interlocutor; few students of ancientMediterranean cultures have known of these curse tablets and bindingspells or thought them of sufficient interest to engage them in conversa-tion. They belong truly to the category of the silent majority. And that isthe argument of this book: defixiones, though widely ignored and disre-garded, introduce us to the cultural koine, the universal religious dis-course of the ancient Mediterranean world. The tablets presented in thepreceding chapters—each one representing at least ten others, scatteredacross international journals, museums, and storage rooms—give usaccess to the concerns of individuals whose voices would otherwise re-main silent.Once engaged in conversation, these tablets make a powerful impres-sion through their immediacy and directness. They add depth and tex-ture to the—one is tempted to say \"real\"—life of ancient men andwomen. Since this is so, we must ask why they have received so littleattention. Obvious answers might be found in the obscurity of the jour-nals in which they have been published; a tendency to classify them as\"magical,\" \"superstitious,\" or \"popular\" and thus not the stuff of serious243"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"244 Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient Worldhistory; and the claim that ancient authors themselves, our best guidesto what \"really\" mattered in antiquity, paid little attention to them. It isthis final claim that we seek to address in this chapter on ancient testimo-nies. Although it is certainly true that discussions of curse tablets wouldnot rank high on any statistical listing of topics in ancient literaturegenerally, or in any individual author, the claim that they played nosignificant role in ancient life remains flawed in two respects: first, thearistocratic bias of ancient authors and modern scholars has produced anenormous distortion in our conception of ancient life and culture, adistortion now under attack from various quarters; and second, the listof authors who do mention katadesmoi and defixiones is not unimpres-sive, including Homer, Plato, Ovid, Tacitus, Apuleius, Plotinus, andEusebius of Caeserea. In addition to such traditional literary testimo-nies, curse tablets and binding spells show up in other sorts of ancienttexts: public inscriptions (nos. 135-36); legal codes (no. 157); and hand-books used by professionals in preparing spells and charms for theirclients. In short, the literary evidence has been present all along; it hassimply been ignored.In most respects, these testimonies confirm the picture painted by thetablets themselves. First and foremost, it is now beyond dispute thatnearly everyone—99 percent of the population is not too high anestimate—believed in their power. That great fact gatherer, Pliny theElder, was certainly correct when he observed (no. 146) that \"there is noone who does not fear to be spellbound by curse tablets.\" More precisely,this belief seems to have transgressed every significant ancientboundary—social, cultural, linguistic, geographical, and religious. Whenadded to the great reach of time embraced by the earliest literary testi-mony (Homer in the eighth century B.C.E.) and the latest (Eustathius inthe twelfth century C.E.), the apparent ease with which the use of defixi-ones managed not merely to survive but to cross these boundaries suggeststhat we are dealing with a truly universal feature of ancient civilization.But if the testimonies confirm some impressions left by the tablets, theyalso point to certain persistent disjunctions. Most notable among these isthe matter of gender. In his remarkable study of love charms and tablets,the late J. Winkler observed that in literary texts, the clients are usuallyfemale, while the experts to whom they resort for help are male.1 But thetablets show a preponderance of men in pursuit of women—just theopposite of the literary portrait. Beyond the sphere of eros, literary textsalso consistently portray the ominous purveyor of horrific spells as awoman, like the bloodthirsty Thessalian \"hag\" in Lucan's Pharsalia(6.413ff.). In fact, the majority of practicing professionals appears to have"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Testimonies   245been men. In this instance, the unique evidence provided by defixionesmakes it possible both to recognize and to isolate this gender disjunctionand thus to make appropriate corrections in our perception of the \"realfacts.\" The truth is that it made little difference who you were—man orwoman; Greek, Roman, Jew, or Christian; commoner or aristocrat; unlet-tered peasant or wise philosopher. In matters of the heart, as in manyother affairs of daily life, anyone could play the role of client or target. Forthere was no one who did not fear the power of defixiones.Note1. \"Constraints,\" pp. 71-98.135. Italy, Tuder (central Italy); dated to the first century C.E. Theinscription appears on the base for a public statue erected by a localfreedman to thank the god Jupiter for having miraculously saved mem-bers of the city council (decuriones). According to the inscription, thecouncillors' names had been attached (defixd) to monuments/tombs(monumentis}. If defixa simply means \"attached\" and if monumentisrefers to a public monument, the result would be a public act rather thanan instance of a defixio. But if defixa is used in a technical sense, that is,in preparing a curse tablet, and if monumentis refers to tombs, we wouldhave a clear reference to a defixio. The circumstances behind the dramaare not given, but the general scene is familiar enough. As a result ofsome grievance against members of the city council, the aggrieved partysought redress.

Theinscription belongs to the category of \"confession texts,\" of which manyexamples have survived.2 Its interest for the study of curse tablets lies inthe fact that this text narrates a sacral-legal proceeding against a woman,Tatia, who was suspected of having placed a curse on her son-in-law. Thecurse is likely to have been a defixio. As part of her ultimately unsuccess-ful efforts to exonerate herself, Tatia posted in the temple what Versnelcalls \"conditional self-curses,\" curses that the gods would carry out only1.

Since Tatia and her son bothsuffered misfortunes that some had interpreted as divine retribution, heroffspring undertook efforts to avert further damage by removing themfrom the temple and propitiating the gods. They set up stelae, or honor-ific inscriptions, which described the gods' great deeds. The proceedingstake place under the aegis of three deities: Great Artemis, Anaeitis, andthe moon-god Men. The inscription sheds light on several problems inthe study of defixiones: (1) the fact that Tatia was believed by others tohave engaged in suspicious practices suggests that such things were notentirely private, secretive acts—indeed, she appears to have beenmoved to vindicate herself due to public rumors about her; (2) it illus-trates a tendency in the Greco-Roman world to attribute personal mis-fortune to spells and charms; and (3) the fact that these events take placein a local temple points to the difficulty in maintaining traditional distinc-tions between the spheres, the beliefs, the gods, and the actions of magicand religion.

This was a standard procedure for opening legal proceedings under the aegis of the gods;see the discussion in Lane, vol. 3, pp. 28-29. The placing of the scepter meant that accusationswere lodged against known or unknown persons and that the prosecution of the case was therebyturned over to the gods.7. Lane's comment here is apropos: \"One may well wonder . . . whether Tatia was not infact innocent. . . .

Homer, Iliad 6.168. The Iliad probably reached its present form inthe eighth century B.C.E. In book 6, Diomedes the Achaean challengesGlaucus, a Lycian fighting with the Trojans, to identify himself. In reply,Glaucus tells the story of his family, including an incident concerning hisgrandfather, Bellerophon, who had been accused and exiled by KingProteus. The question here is what is meant by the folded wooden tableton which are written semata, described as lugra and thumophthora.Bibl: W. Leaf, ed., The Iliad (Amsterdam, 1971), p. 270.The king stopped short of killing him (Bellerophon), for he feared in his heartto do so, and sent him off to Lukia and gave him sinister signs, numerous andlife-threatening,10 written on a folded tablet. He told him to show them to his(Bellerophon's) father-in-law and thereby be put to death.139. Sophocles, Ajax 839-42; the author probably produced his playbefore 441 B.C.E. In this scene, Ajax is about to kill himself. In anticipa-tion, he calls for vengeance against those who had dishonored him byawarding the arms of the dead Achilles to Odysseus rather than to him.His earlier attempt to restore his honor by killing Agamemnon andMenelaos, had been turned aside by an attack of madness brought on byAthena. Instead, he assaulted a flock of sheep. There is no question of acurse tablet in this passage, but rather a reference to gods who show up8. The verb eulogein indicates not a private act of personal piety but rather the public actionof setting up an offering to the gods.9. The actions of the family consisted in offering sacrifices and setting up a stele (probablythis very stone), or inscription, in which they \"confessed\" publicly the great feats of the gods.10. How to read these words? Do they simply refer to the contents of the message, whichpresumably contained the command to arrange for Bellerophon's death? In this case, the tabletwould simply be a letter. Against this view, it can be argued that semata does not designate wordsbut some other kind of writing, and that in the Odyssey (2.329) the phrase pharmakathumophthora clearly points to deadly spells. Thus there is at least a possibility that the foldedtablet (pinax ptuktos) was a prototype of later curse tablets (also folded and also making use ofsigns), with the signs intended somehow to bring about Bellerophon's death.

In a preliminary discussion concerning the nature of true justice,Adeimantos reports a number of widely held views that deprived justiceof any serious meaning, citing as examples popular religious figures whoclaim to possess the power to manipulate the gods for any purpose, goodor evil, by spells and charms. Two points are worth noting: first, thespeech assumes that curse tablets were a common feature of Athenianlife; and second, the wandering professionals who sold them directedtheir attention at the wealthy. In short, the use of curse tablets was notlimited to the \"ignorant\" and \"superstitious\" lower classes as oftenclaimed.Begging priests and soothsayers go to the doors of the wealthy and convincethem that if you want to harm an enemy, at very little expense, whether hedeserves it or not, they will persuade the gods through charms and bindingspells14 to do your bidding.141.

In her study of the god Hephaistos, Marie Delcourt (p. 160) argues that Ajax's wordsmust be interpreted as a formulaic expression taken from a cursing ritual; cf. also Tupet, pp.261-62. Certainly the expression (lines 840-41) \"just as (hosper) ... so (tos)\" is reminiscent ofsimilar formulas in numerous curse tablets.14. The Greek terms are epodai and katadesmoi.

The issue here involves twokinds of pharmaka, poisons and spells. This passage confirms severalimportant notions about the use of binding spells in classical Greekculture: they were widespread; they were feared by most people; theywere made available by professionals; they were commonly deposited incemeteries; and they used human figurines. As in the previous passage,Plato finds himself in a dilemma. On the one hand, he claims not tobelieve that such things really work; on the other hand, he must banthem because of their noxious effects on the broad public. Bibl: J. deRomilly, Magic and Rhetoric in Ancient Greece (Cambridge, Mass.,1975), pp. 23-43 (\"Plato and Conjurers\").There is also another kind that persuades reckless persons that they can doinjury by sorceries, and incantations and binding spells,15 as they are called,and makes others believe that they are likely to be injured by the powers ofthe magician.

Ovid, AmoreslLoves 3.7.27-30; three books of elegiac love poetrywritten and revised over a period of time, from around 20 B.C.E. toperhaps 1 B.C.E. The poet laments his inability to \"perform\" in the armsof his lover. His first explanation for this humiliating failure takes theform of imagining that he has been the target of a love spell, in this casethe kind exemplified by numerous separation tablets. The ease withwhich Ovid considers this explanation suggests that the practice was wellknown at the time.15. The Greek terms are manganeia, epddai, and katadesis. The last two appear in Republic364; katadesis here must be identical with katadesmos.16. In PGM IV, line 2955, a love spell is to be deposited \"at a crossroad.\" It is interesting tonote that the same spell requires the use of wax to be shaped as a small dog.

Ovid, Fasti II, 571-82; Ovid's poetic explanation of the Romanreligious calendar. At this point Ovid is discussing the Feralia, or festival18. In the literary tradition of Rome, Thessaly was known as the (Greek) home of charmsand spells; it is the setting for Lucan's gruesome account of the famous \"Thessalian witch\"; theplay, Heracles on Mount Oeta, attributed to Seneca, identifies Thessaly as the place wherepowerful herbs grow; and in Apuleius's Golden Ass, the hero, Lucius, travels to Thessaly inorder to study \"the magical arts.\" In these stories, the practitioners are always women.19. The Latin term is venenum, probably derived from Venus, the goddess of love. It couldbe used narrowly of a love spell or more broadly of spells of any kind.20. The Latin term is devota, a technical term for spells on curse tablets; such tablets werecalled both devotiones and defixiones.21. Like Plato, Ovid considers two possible forms of enchantment, drugs taken from plants(herba) or recited spells (carmina).22. The Latin verb is defixit; again this is a technical term for curse tablets.23. The practice of sticking pins in small figurines, especially in curse tablets associated withlove, whether for attraction or separation, is well attested in literary texts, in the papyri, and insurviving figurines. The liver was the proverbial seat of the emotions.24. The two verbs here are devovet andfigit; both are technical terms for love spells on metaltablets.25. It should be noted that some modern editors regard the details spelled out here(\"Among . . . needle\") as a later interpolation.

It was a time when spiritswere around and about. Perhaps inspired by the thought of spirits andcemeteries, Ovid describes certain ritual activities of an old woman.Bibl.: J. G.

Then she binds enchanted threads together withdark lead27 and mutters with seven black beans in her mouth. She roasts inthe fire the head of a small fish which she has sewn up, sealed with pitch andpierced with a bronze needle. She also drops wine on it. ... Then, as sheleaves, she says, \"We have bound up hostile tongues and unfriendlymouths.\"28 ... At once you will ask me, \"Who is this goddess Muta (MuteOne)?\"29145. Seneca, On Benefits 6.35.4; this essay deals with the theme of howone can be the source of benefit toward others. At this point in the essay,Seneca is discussing those who seek to escape the responsibility of repay-ing a benefit received from others, in this case the repayment of a debt.If you decided to repay a debt to him with money from his own pocket, youwould appear to be very far from being grateful. But what you desire is even26. Tupet, pp. 409-10, suggests the following scenario: the young women come to the oldwoman for the preparation and consecration of lead defixiones; the association of the festival ofall souls with the dead is appropriate in that the young women would then deposit their tablets inthe cemeteries where the holiday would take them in any case.27. The connection between threads and lead tablets appears in several love spells in PGMas well as in a number of preserved tablets. The connection is probably a physical one, that is,the recipes call for a figurine to be attached by threads to the tablet on which the spell isinscribed. Alternatively, the threads might be pieces taken from the victim's clothing. Bomer (p.126) and Tupet (pp. 409-10) correctly see the passage as a clear reference to spells on metaltablets, namely, defixiones.28. In her parting words, the old woman indicates that the spell belongs to the particularcategory of \"silencing charms,\" which are amply illustrated among both surviving defixiones (\"Ibind the tongue of so-and-so\") and in PGM (e.g., IX, lines 1-14).29. The underworld goddess (so named by Ovid himself in line 610, infernae nympha paludisor \"goddess of the infernal marsh\") is attested not just in Ovid but in a lead defixio, with Latintext; cf. R. Egger, \"Zu einem Fluchtafelchen aus Blei,\" Romische Antike und frtihes Chris-tentum, vol. 2 (Klagenfurt, 1963), pp. 247-53. Frazer (p. 446) and others had previously arguedthat Ovid had simply invented the name Muta in order to explain certain features of the Feralia.The tablet itself is an appeal to the deity Muta Tacita that she should silence a certain Quartusand that he should run around like a scurrying mouse (\"O Muta Tacita, let Quartus be silent, lethim run around disturbed like a scurrying mouse\")."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Testimonies   253more unjust.

She doesn't charge a big fee—just a drachmaand a loaf of bread. Besides that you must put out seven obols, some sul-phur, and a torch along with salt. These are taken by the old woman. Shemust also have a bowl of wine mixed and drink it by herself. You'll also needsomething belonging to the man himself, such as clothing or boots or a fewof his hairs or anything of that sort. . . . She hangs these (boots) on a peg andfumigates46 them with sulphur, sprinkling salt over the fire, and mumblesboth your names. Then she plucks out a wheel47 from her bosom and whirlsit around, rattling off an incantation full of horrible outlandish names.48That's what she did on that occasion, and shortly afterward, though at oneand the same time his friends warned him off, and Phoebis, the lady whosecompany he was keeping, pleaded desperately with him, he returned to me.153. Apuleius, Metamorphoses 3.17. In this episode of his picaresquenovel, the young Lucius tries unsuccessfully to imitate the spells producedby a professional woman, Pamphile. In this scene, Pamphile's servantgirl, Fotis, describes her mistress's workshop for Lucius.

PGM IV, lines 295ff., speaks of the use of smoke (thumiaterion) in the preparation of ametal tablet.47. The Greek term is rhombos, probably to be taken as identical with the Greek iunx. Therhombus is mentioned in PGM IV, line 2336, a (love?) spell addressed variously to Hermes,Selene, Kore, and Hekate. The instrument is described as belonging to \"her who rules Tartaros.\"It appears also in the same text, line 2296, as an instrument connected with the invocation of thedeity. A. S. F. Gow, ed., Theocritus (Cambridge, 1950), p. 41, describes the instrument as \"aspoked wheel, or a disk, with two holes on either side of the centre.\" When a cord is passedthrough the two holes and alternately stretched and released, the disk will revolve back andforth. The instrument is illustrated on numerous Greek vases. On the wheel and its use inconnection with love spells and other forms of binding, see Gow, p. 41, and Sarah Johnston,Hekate Soteira: A Study of Hekate's Roles in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature (At-lanta, 1990), pp. 90-110.48.

Apuleius, Metamorphoses 9.29. In a series of ribald tales involvingbetrayal and marital infidelity, a baker learns of his wife's adulterousaffairs. Her efforts to save herself reveal a number of typical settingswhere defixiones were likely to be deployed: first, as love spells betweenmarried couples where one partner feared losing the affections of theother; and second, failing that, as a way to bring suffering and death onthe lost spouse. Once again, as often in literary texts, both the client andthe specialist are women.The baker divorced his wife and made her leave the house. . . . But shesought out a old woman who was believed to be able to do whatever shepleased by means of curse tablets and spells.51 . . . The baker's wife prom-ised her a large sum and urged her to do one of two things: either to softenher husband's heart so that they might be reconciled or, failing that, toinvoke some spirit or infernal deity to put a violent end to his days. Thispowerful woman, able to control the gods, first tried the milder forms of herevil art and sought to influence the offended feelings of the husband.52 . . .But when the results turned out differently from her expectations, indignantat the gods . . . she began to attack the very life of the poor man and tostimulate the spirit of a woman who had met a violent death to carry out hisdestruction.53155.

PGM VII, lines 465-66 (a recipe for preparing a love charm on a tin sheet), calls for acopper nail from a shipwrecked vessel.50. The details correspond accurately with the material evidence: the common use of plants;metal strips with mysterious names, (the defixiones themselves); pieces of sunken ships, in thiscase the nails that commonly accompanied defixiones; parts of human bodies (the commonassociation of defixiones with graves and tombs); and finally an elaborate set of ritual incanta-tions whereby the defixio was consecrated before being deposited.51. The terms are devotiones and maleficia; here, as elsewhere they probably refer to differ-ent aspects of a single action rather than to separate strategies.52. The first effort was clearly a love spell, designed to rekindle affections in the husband.Thus we can safely assume that a number of love spells preserved on lead tablets were employedfor intramarital reconciliation.53.

Paulus, Sentences 5.23.15-18; an anthology of legal opinions, at-tributed to an important Roman jurist (ca. 210 C.E.). \"Magical prac-tices,\" however imprecisely defined and understood, had been out-lawed in Rome from the time of the Twelve Tables (fifth centuryB.c.E.).57 Under Sulla (81 B.C.E.), the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis etVeneficiis added venena (poisons/charms) to the list of prohibited of-fenses and made the possession, sale, gift, or production of poisons/charms, including those used for amatory purposes, subject to punish-ment; the punishments depended on the social standing of the of-fender. Both earlier and later prohibitions no doubt cover the use ofcurse tablets but this passage from Paulus is the only one to makespecific mention of them.58 The passage represents a significant expan-sion in the range of prohibited offenses.

The Greek term is poikilos. The connection may be that this term was often used ofdrugs; alternatively, it might lie in the fact that curse tablets sometimes used string to attachfigurines to the metal tablets.55. The verb is katadedesthai, to which both katadesmos and katado which occur frequentlyin tablets, are related.56. The two verbs are pepharmakeusthai and dedesthai.57. In his Apologia (47), Apuleius remarks that \"this magic of which you accuse me is, I amtold, a crime in the eyes of the law and was forbidden in remote antiquity by the Twelve Tablesbecause in some incredible manner crops had been charmed away from one field to another.\"The key was the prohibition of mala carmina. Some Roman authors took the phrase to be aprohibition against defaming persons through poetry—so Cicero, as cited by Augustine, City ofGod 12.9, and others; see Tupet, \"Rites magiques,\" pp. 2592-2601. In support of Apuleius'sreading stands Pliny, Natural History 28.10.58. The Christian emperor Constantine strongly affirms the authority of Paulus's writings(Theodosian Code 1.4.2). To this he added, in line with earlier attempts to distinguish between\"harmful\" and \"innocent\" magic, that no punishment was due for remedies of illness or for spellsto protect crops from natural disasters (ibid., 9.16.3)."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Testimonies   259Whoever performs or commissions unlawful nocturnal rites, in order to casta spell, to curse or to bind59 someone, will be crucified or thrown to thebeasts. ...

The Neoplatonic philosopher (205-269C.E.) devotes a lengthy section of his essay \"On Difficulties about theSoul\" to the question of how spells (goeteiai) work. He assumes theirefficacy but strives to empty them of all traditional significance by attrib-uting their success to the natural workings of the cosmos. In addition, hedenies their ability to affect the soul of the wise person. Like mostintellectuals in the ancient world, Plotinus was well informed about theworld of spells and curses. Some have wondered whether he was also apractitioner. BibL: P. Merlan, \"Plotinus and Magic,\" Isis 44 (1953): 341-48; A. H. Armstrong, \"Was Plotinus a Magician?\" Phronesis 1 (1955-1956): 73-79; E.

Jerome, Life of Saint Hilarion the Hermit 21 (PL 23, cols. 39-40);this life of Hilarion of Gaza is attributed to Jerome and was written inthe late fourth or early fifth century C.E. The account of Hilarion con-tains several incidents of confrontations between the saint and variouslocal practitioners of the \"magical arts.\" One story tells of a young manwho had fallen in love with a Christian virgin. After failing in his firstadvances, he traveled to Memphis in Egypt where he studied (presum-ably the arts of amatory spells) with certain prophets of Asclepius. Onhis return to Gaza, and armed with his new knowledge, he sought to puthis skills to work. In the end, the saint defeats his efforts and demon-strates the superiority of his power to that of the demons. The descrip-tion of the amatory metal tablet conforms well to prescriptions in thepapyri. BibL: J. N. D. Kelly, Jerome (New York, 1975).After a year of instruction with the prophets of Asclepius,69 who are trainednot to heal souls but to destroy them, he returned home, excited by hisdreams of debauchery; at the home of the young woman, under the thresh-old,70 he buried a metal tablet, made of bronze from Cyprus, engraved withvarious portentous words71 and potent figures.72 Immediately the youngvirgin went crazy.7366. Synesius here uses goes.67. The term here is katadesmos, used with epoide.68. The Greek here is iunx.69. At Memphis in Egypt. The mention of the cult of Asclepius in this setting is unusual, forthe Greek god of healing is not normally associated with spells and curses in the primary texts—the papyri and tablets themselves.70. The placement of love spells near the home of the intended target is prescribed in variousrecipes in PGM as well as in the account of Sophronios (see no. 166).71. These portenta quaedam verborum may reflect either the content of the spell or thecustomary mysterious words and names, or, more likely, both.72. The portentosas figuras must be a reference to the various figures and charakteres foundin virtually all binding spells of this period.73. In other words, the spell worked. Love spells of this sort regularly specify that theintended target should lose her normal faculties until she comes to the client.

Some have sought to derive the root word from the Hebrewkochav, \"star.\" In general, this series of voces mysticae illustrates a linguisticprinciple according to which a set of variations on a basic pattern is created byaltering a limited number of vowels and consonants in successive \"words.\""},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Glossary of Uncommon Words  267DAMNAMENEUS: a common term, possibly derived from damnazein (\"to tame\").For discussion, see Faraone and Kotansky (no. 133).DAMNO DAMN A LUKODAMNA: a standard set of word variations, for example, PGMIII, lines 434-35 read, \"ARTEMI DAMNO DAMNO LUKAINA.\" The basis of the set isderived from one of the widely circulated ephesia grammata, i.e., damna-meneus (see glossary): lukodamna = wolf-tamer; lukaina = she-wolf. Thewords are commonly associated with Hekate and Artemis.Demeter: a popular Greek goddess, associated with her daughter Persephone/Proserpina (also called Kore) and with Hades/Pluto, the god of the underworld.Dike: personification of justice and revenge; became a popular Greek goddess.D6DEKAKISTE: a rare term of uncertain meaning. Dodeka is the number ten, andkistos means basket; perhaps \"the one (female) who encompasses the twelve(gods?).\" See under HUESSEMIGADON.Ephesia grammata: a term used in two quite different senses. The broad use,now less in vogue, designates all nonstandard forms of discourse in spells andcharms; this use has now generally been replaced by voces magicae or, as inthis book, voces mysticae. The narrow use refers to a set of terms said to havebeen inscribed on the great statue of Artemis at Ephesus—askion, kataskion,lix, tetrax, damnameneus, and aision (variant aisia. See the discussion in R.Kotansky, \"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amu-lets,\" in Magika, p. 111).ERESCHIGAL: a female deity of Babylonian origin; the name sometimes appearstogether with NEBOUTOUSOUALETH.EULAMON: this common term is used in a variety of ways. Various theories havebeen proposed regarding its origin and meaning. R. Wiinsch (SethianischeVerfluchungstafeln aus Rom [Leipzig, 1898], p. 83) considers a possible connec-tion with the Egytian god Ammon; he also argues that it stems from a com-mand in Greek, \"Destroy the body (of my enemy)!\" in which the Greekletters have been reversed so as to read from last to first; that is, soma luebecomes eulamos. Others propose a derivation from a West Semitic adjectivemeaning \"eternal.\" Still others would derive it from an Assyrian term, ullamu,again meaning \"eternal.\" See the discussion in Bonner and Youtie, \"CurseTablets,\" pp. 62-63. Various other interpretations of this common term havebeen offered; cf. Youtie and Bonner, p. 62 and Preisendanz (1972), pp. 17-18.Hekate: an important Greek goddess of the underworld and one of the mostprominent figures in charms and spells; see Sarah Johnston, Hekate Soteira: AStudy of Hekate's Roles in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature (At-lanta, 1990).Hermes: a Greek god, associated both with the underworld and with a numberof female deities, especially Demeter and Hekate. He was long associatedwith the sphere of charms and spells. He was further identified with theEgyptian god Thoth and the Roman god Mercury."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"268  Glossary of Uncommon WordsHUESSEMIGADON: the first word of a common formula that appears on severaldefixiones and in numerous recipes of PGM (e.g., II, lines 32-34 and V, lines424-25). See Cormack, \"A Tabella Defixionis in the Museum of the Univer-sity of Reading, England,\" HTR 44 (1951): 31-33, and Martinez, pp. 39f.IAO: derived originally from the famous tetragrammaton (four letter), the holyand unpronounceable name of god in the Hebrew Bible, YHWH. It came to beused widely on amulets and defixiones; it appears as well as a cosmic power inGnostic texts. See the discussion in Fauth, \"Arbath Jao,\" pp. 65-75, andMartinez, pp. 79f.Kore: see under Demeter.LAILAM: some connection with the Greek word lailaps (\"storm, hurricane\")seems likely, although others have proposed a derivation from Hebrew, le-olam, \"forever\"; whether our vox mystica was originally derived from it, ormerely associated with it secondarily, is another matter.MARMARAdiH: this name occurs also in PGM VII, lines 488 and 598, 608. Onevariant is MARMARACHTHA. Voces mysticae built on the basic form of marmar,with numerous suffixes, are quite common; cf. PGM XXXV, line 2 and VII,line 572. Its origins probably lie in the Aramaic phrase, \"Lord of Lords.\" SeeK. Preisendanz, \"Marmaroath,\" RE 14 (1930), col. 1881, and Martinez, pp.81f.MASKELLI MASKELL6: one of the most common formulas containing voces mys-ticae. In its full form it reads as follows: MASKELLI MASKELLO PHNOUKENTABAOOREOBAZAGRA REXICHTH6N HIPPOCHTHON PURIPEGANUX (cf. PGM VII, line302). It includes a number of recognizable Greek elements: rexichthdn, \"burst-ing out from the earth\"; hippochthdn, horse plus earth; puripeganux, \"lord ofthe fire fount.\" See the discussion in GMP, p. 336.MELIOUCHOS: in various spells this term is used of a mythological figure associ-ated with a number of deities, including Serapis, Zeus, Helios, Hekate,Ereschigal, and Mithras. The name may derive from the Greek word forhoney, meli, or perhaps (so Harrauer) from an Egyptian phrase. For discus-sions see GMP, p. 336; C. Harrauer, Meliouchos. Studien zur Entwicklungreligioser Vorstellungen in griechischen synkretistischen Zaubertexten (Vienna,1987); and the cautionary note (against hasty word derivations) of H. J.Thissen, \"Etymologeien,\" ZPE13 (1988): 304-5.OSORONNOPHRIS: a common name for Osiris. Its meaning in Egyptian is \"Osiristhe beautiful.\"Osiris: a popular deity of Egyptian myth and cult; the husband of Isis and theruler of the underworld.OREOBAZAGRA: see under MASKELLI MASKELLO.OUROBOROS (AKROUROBORE is a common variant): a serpent represented biting itsown tail; see the discussion in GMP, p. 337."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Glossary of Uncommon Words  269Persephone: see under Demeter.PURIPEGANUX: see under MASKELLI MASKELLO.Sabaoth: one of the many terms used to describe the god of the Hebrew Bible.Its original meaning is \"the heavenly hosts.\" In the later defixiones and amu-lets, it comes to designate an independent deity.SEMESEILAM: a familar term in formularies (e.g., PGMIV, line 1805; V, lines 351and 365; and VII, lines 645-50). The fact that this vox mystica is clearlyassociated with the sun makes it likely that it was originally derived from aHebrew expression meaning either \"sun of the world\" or \"eternal sun.\" G.Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, p. 134, proposes a derivation from Aramaic,shemi shelam, \"my name is peace.\"SESENGENBARPHARANGES: a common vox mystica with solar connections. It isused frequently together with the palindrome ABLANATHANABLA. Scholem,Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 96-100, argues for Jewish origins. Josephus, BellumJudaicum 7.179-80, speaks of a potent fig-tree located in a ravine (tespharangos) near a place called Baaras. The roots of the tree produced power-ful drugs. Thus our vox may have originated as a reference to \"the Baaras-ravine.\" See the discussion in GMP, p. 339, and Martinez, pp. 78f.Seth: the Egyptian chthonic god of wisdom and spells; the enemy of Osiris;associated with the desert and the color red; often represented with the headof a dog or jackal.
