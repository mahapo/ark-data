At the conclusion of the excava-tion, with the onset of World War II, it seemed preferable to leave the artifacts in Iran,where they would presumably be safe, rather than to send them to the United States for studyand publication. Indeed, a few specimens that were risked were \"lost at sea\" through enemyaction, and they are so marked in the catalogue of objects in Persepolis II. Only two smallpieces carried to the United States by Professor Erich Schmidt personally for petrological analy-sis reached their destination. The remainder, more than two hundred pieces, were crated atPersepolis for shipment to the Teheran Museum.Fortunately, most of the Aramaic-bearing specimens were photographed by the excavatingstaff at Persepolis, and they were copied and studied there in 1939 by Professor GeorgeCameron, who was then a member of the Oriental Institute staff at Persepolis. Preliminarypublication of his conclusions is found in Persepolis II. When I was assigned the task of publish-ing the Aramaic material from Persepolis, Professor Cameron generously supplied me with thephotographs and personal copies as well as the notes he had made in Iran. Without this ma-terial publication would now be impossible.My first independent readings of these texts were made in 1947. Ever since, during a busyschedule of teaching and administration, the study of the artifacts has proceeded on the basisof the secondary materials supplied by Professor Cameron. The difficulties that had to besurmounted in broken, faded, and often stained texts are apparent from the photographs herepresented.Bit by bit the witness of the fragments was extracted. Faded and missing letters wereidentified wherever possible, and broken words were restored. The essential structure of thetexts was determined and the occasional unique, supplementary phrases were given specialstudy. Finally, because of the formulaic character of the texts, broken passages were restoredand almost every word could be read with certainty.But the task then had just begun. Proper names were recognized, but the correct identifica-tion and rendering of Iranian names in Aramaic transcription is a continuing problem, especial-ly for one who is not an expert in the subject. The limited and simple vocabulary of Aramaicwords found in these texts, too, although easily translated in isolation, was a problem. At-tempts to translate the texts by employing the usual and expected meanings of the Aramaicwords produced awkward, cumbersome readings that make no sound, consecutive sense. Asmall but quite clear photograph of one of the more complete and representative texts waspublished in Persepolis II. To my knowledge, only Professor F. Altheim ventured a translationand commentary on that text,' an attestation of the difficulty of extracting the sense of suchapparently simple texts.More study was required to discover the syntax of the texts and their proper meaning beforea translation could be attempted. On apparently sufficient grounds, Professor Schmidt re-garded the vessels as \"ritual objects,\" and, because of their dense concentration within oneof the rooms of the Treasury, assumed that the objects had been presented there as memorials.1 F. Altheim and R. Stiehl, Die aramiische Sprache unter den Achaemeniden (Frankfurt am Main, 1936) I 17-21.voi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In order to arrive at a meaning for the texts that would be intelligible and within the boundsof the accepted assumptions, valid but less usual meanings of the simple Aramaic words hadto be tried. The results of such study are apparent in the translations and discussions herepresented. Without pretending to have proven a thesis about the texts, I have presented thiswork simply as what appears to be the most plausible conjecture in harmony with all knownfacts. It is but a challenge to others to present alternative explanations of these simple yetdifficult texts that will be equally true to all of the evidence.Before publication, an effort was made to collate suspected readings with the original textsin Iran. The result was a continual delay. In 1963 the pieces on exhibition in the museums atTeheran and Persepolis were studied, but determined efforts to locate the bulk of the artifactswere frustrated. Knowledge of their whereabouts was disclaimed everywhere.After the publication of Persepolis II, it was found that not all of the material had beenmade available for study. A check of the Field Register of the Persepolis Expedition indicatedthat approximately a third more texts had been found than those represented by the photo-graphs and copies that had been supplied to me for study. A careful search of the effects andrecords of the late Professor Schmidt produced no further material and publication had to bedelayed until another search could be made in Iran.Attendance at the Congress of Iranologists in Iran in 1966 afforded the needed opportunityto renew the search for the missing artifacts. With the vigorous support and personal assistanceof Professor Cameron and with the full cooperation of Iranian officials, an extended, carefulsearch was made in the storage cabinets and storerooms of the archeological museums inTeheran and Persepolis. Only what had been seen previously in 1963 was found at Teheran,and it seemed evident that the artifacts had never reached their destination from Persepolis.The explanation was finally found by Professor Cameron at Persepolis. The crated objectshad been dumped and abandoned in an unused room of the Persepolis Museum. The objectshad to be re-excavated there, cleaned, and forwarded to their original destination in Teheran.Some of the objects had been further broken in the interim and in the process of cleaning, thefaint Aramaic writing almost disappeared. They were briefly studied and sorted in Teheranand the texts that had never been copied or photographed were sent on loan to the OrientalInstitute at Chicago.The artifacts sent to Chicago from Teheran were generally in such poor condition, presum-ably as a result of the cleaning process they had undergone, that they were extremely difficultto photograph. Infrared photography produced no satisfactory results, but filters were foundthat gave passable prints. Hand copies were made of the most difficult examples, using magni-fication and a slight moistening to bring out the dim letters. Consequently, the copies some-times show what is not clearly visible in the photographs. In some instances both the copyand photograph are given here so that comparison can be made. Where no presentable photo-graph is available, copies by Professor Cameron or by me are given (indicated by initials\"C\" and \"B\"). In every possible instance, the copies have been checked and rechecked withthe almost illegible originals to insure accuracy.2Only part of the missing fragments were recovered in 1966. The remainder were presumablyalso discarded somewhere and may never be found. It seems imperative now, at long last, toproceed with the publication of the material now available. While the loss of the remainder isdeplorable, since the missing texts would doubtless augment the already long list of Iraniannames in Aramaic transcription and possibly present variant readings or supplemental ma-terial that might cast more light on some of the quite perplexing problems that remain, it2 All Aramaic texts except those on a few very large objects are shown actual size in the illustrations at the end ofthis book.viPREFACEoi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"seems unlikely that the missing texts would materially alter the conclusions based on availableresources or upset the dating of the texts, which appears to be quite certain.In the course of this study it has been necessary for me to enter fields of Iranian languageand religion that are not normally the province of an Aramaist. I claim no expertise in suchareas myself, and I am aware of the differences of opinion that exist among Iranologists,especially in the matter of Achaemenid religion. But an adequate exposition of the nature ofthese inscribed cultic artifacts demands an examination of the context in which they belong.If the vessels are indeed cultic, as seems likely, religious matters cannot and must not beavoided, even if only for the evidential value of the implements and their texts.Because the haoma ceremony is an important and continuing aspect of Persian religion andbecause the praxis of modern Parsi ritual, almost our sole witness to the ancient rite, obviouslyhas ancient survivals as well as subsequent changes, it is both necessary and appropriate toexamine the current haoma ritual, at least for comparative purposes. The somewhat extendeddiscussions of religious matters in chapter ii and elsewhere are needed to justify the transla-tions given and to render them intelligible.Furthermore, since in many of the texts the principal actor in the ritual is a high militaryofficial, it seems pertinent to refer to the military Mithraism of much later times in which somesubstitute for the haoma ceremony seems to have persisted. After conjecturing that the culticaspects of these Aramaic texts may reflect a Mithraic cult in the Achaemenid army, I wasgratified to learn, in a personal communication from Professor Richard N. Frye, of HarvardUniversity, that \"It looks more and more that a 'proto-Mithraic' cult existed among thesoldiers at Persepolis, for other fragments of information fit in with such a theory.\"Because of my obvious deficiencies in Iranian matters, I have sought the assistance of anumber of more competent scholars in that area. I am especially grateful to Professor WilhelmEilers, of Wiirzburg, Germany, Professor Janos Harmatta, of Budapest, and ProfessorRichard N. Frye, of Harvard University, concerning the identifications and etymologies ofthe many Iranian names in these texts. I must, of course, accept full responsibility for thematerial that I have used.Professor E. 0. Negahban of the Iran Bastan Museum of Teheran, Iran, has been mosthelpful during my frustrating periods in Iran and has been an interested and encouragingfriend throughout the preparation of this study. Without the assistance of my good friendProfessor George G. Cameron, of the University of Michigan, this work could never have beenundertaken. Through the years we have discussed the problems involved, and he has carefullyread and criticized my manuscript. Although not all of his suggestions have been followed,they are evident in the final draft and this book is, I believe, all the better for his challenges.Special recognition is due those who have seen this work through the laborious and tediousprocesses of editing and production.

Schmidt, in the years 1936 through 1938, theremains of some 269 mortars, pestles, plates, and trays of a distinctive flinty green stonewere found in the Treasury building.' About 203 of those objects were more or less legiblyinscribed in ink in Aramaic writing.2The stone fragments were found scattered on the floors, principally in the complex of roomsand corridors in the northern part of the Treasury (Fig. 1). Schmidt said, \"By far the majorityof these objects had been stored in the last addition to the building. ... A small number ofspecimens occurred in Hall 41 and in other units of the central section of the Treasury, butonly three pieces had strayed into the southern and earliest portion of the building.\"3 Thechief storage place for such objects was the large rectangular room (38) which runs the widthof the Treasury at its northern extremity. This room, its roof supported by a hundred columns,was surrounded by seven subsidiary rooms (42 to 48) with entrances from the western andnorthern sides of the larger room.Only a few complete vessels were recovered, and those were not found in the room with thegreat majority of the fragments. Pieces of the objects were found scattered among the pillarsof Room 38, but the great mass of them littered the floor to the south and west of the room,especially along the south wall, against which they appear to have been shattered.After the green stone mortars, pestles, and plates had been interpreted as \"ritual objects,'4it seemed natural to suppose that their destruction was purposeful, part of the praxis of thereligious rite in which they were used. But the recovery of several undamaged pieces5 and thefact that the royal tableware had been similarly shattered and scattered on the floor among thefragments of the mortars, pestles, and plates made vandalism a more likely explanation oftheir broken condition.When Alexander the Great captured Persepolis in 330 B.c., according to Diodorus he per-mitted his troops to plunder the city, \"except the king's palace.\"6 It is evident that their loot-ing and vandalism extended to the Treasury of Persepolis on the citadel terrace as well as tothe city in the plain below. Everywhere in the Treasury there has been found evidence ofplundering and vandalism before the building was burned and of wanton destruction of what-ever the looters decided not to carry away.1 Schmidt, Persepolis II 18, 53, 82, Fig. 7.Other fragments of damaged green stone mortars and pestles, now at the Oriental Institute, sent by Ernst Herzfeld,who had recovered them earlier at Persepolis, are presumably those mentioned by Schmidt as having been found in theFratadara Temple and the post-Alexandrian building with the Achaemenid gate (Schmidt, Persepolis II 53, n. 55, I 55-56).Schmidt regarded them as vessels, \"presumably reused.\" There is now no trace of writing on any of them.A similar green chert mortar fragment (NR1 12) was found at Naqsh-i Rustam in the surface layer of BB 14.2Schmidt, Persepolis II 55a. 3 Ibid., p. 53a.SIbid., I 156-200, Figs. 63-81, II 53-56.Nos. 33, 43, 76.

Even itsroof seems to have escaped destruction by fire. Only where burning debris fell into the roomfrom outside was there even scorching. It is evident that the material stored there was notflammable. Its contents appear to have been statuary and tableware of stone, composition,and glass. Especially prominent among the finds of this room were the green stone ritual ob-jects scattered on its floor, especially near the base of its south wall.Rooms 46 and 47, subsidiary to Room 38, which lay beyond the northern wall of that greatroom, contained no trace of the green stone vessels. In Room 42, entered near the southwesterncorner of Room 38, only a single object was found in the debris. Room 43 and, subsidiary toit, Room 44, in the northwestern corner, appear to have been depositories for weapons,principally, but two green stone mortar fragments and one of a plate were found in Room 43;one of the mortar pieces was inscribed.7Room 45, entered from Room 38 near the northwestern corner of its north wall, held frag-ments of seven green stone objects, four of which were inscribed (Nos. 36, 74, 88, and 125).8The finding of so many objects in such a relatively small room has led to the conclusion thatat least some cult vessels had been stored there.A small collection of fragments of such stone vessels lay before the doorless opening in theeastern part of the north wall which led to the long, narrow room (48) below the stairway atthe northern exit of the Treasury building. Only one fragment, and that inscribed (No. 117),was found within, at the eastern end of the long room.A single door in the southern wall of Room 38 linked it with the remainder of the Treasury.Just beyond the door in the south wall, in Room 39, where more than a thousand arrowheadswere found, fragments of several green stone plates were recovered. They had probably beenkicked or thrown from Room 38. Beyond Room 39 a long corridor (Room 31) extended south-ward to Room 32 in the southern part of the Treasury. A pestle fragment and part of a greenstone plate were found in Room 31 quite near its southern exit.9A doorway in the western wall of the long corridor (31) led to a large square room (41) witha roof supported by 99 columns. There a patched strip of flooring running between the doorwayand the entrance to Room 56, on the opposite side, attests to heavy traffic. A considerablenumber of labels bearing impressions of official seals found in the complex indicate that Room56 and Rooms 55 and 57, which flank it, were used for the storage of the most valuable things.These three rooms, looted of all major objects, were almost bare, but a fragment of a singlestone pestle was found just inside the door to Room 56.10 It could have been dropped or dis-carded by a busy plunderer who had found more desirable loot there. Not a trace of a greenstone ritual vessel was found in the other subsidiary rooms entered from Room 41 throughdoors in the north and south walls of the room.Blackened walls, burnt plaster, and spalled and heat-shattered column bases attest to aviolent conflagration of combustible stores in Room 41. But it was also the depository for themost precious royal tableware, which included foreign, pre-Achaemenid objects, spoils of war,as well as vessels of domestic production. In the northern half of the room, fragments of royaltableware were scattered over the floor among the columns, as they were also in Room 38.A heap of fragments was found in the northeastern corner of the room, where the vessels hadbeen shattered against the walls. But few, if any, of the ritual vessels appear to have beenstored in Room 41. Fragments of four plates and of a mortar were found in the heap of shatteredtableware in the northeastern corner of the room and five fragments of other plates werescattered among the columns near the center. A fragment of a pestle was found near the center7 Schmidt, Persepolis I 184.

Four of the plates (Nos. 18, 45, 72, and 111)\" and a mortar fragment (No.82) found in Room 41 were inscribed.Across the corridor (31) from Room 41, a door in the east wall led to an open courtyard (17)surrounded by four porticoes, a complex that appears to have been the administrative center ofthe Treasury. From the courtyard there was access, through Portico 19 and Room 23, to alarge rectangular room (33) with a roof supported by ten columns in two rows. The largenumber of cuneiform tablets found there suggests that Room 33 was the archival headquartersof the local administration.Only scattered fragments of the stone ritual objects were found in the complex of rooms andcorridors east of Corridor 31. A piece of a plate was recovered from the western portico (20);another was in the northwestern corner of the main courtyard (17); still another came fromthe northwestern portico (19) and another plate fragment (No. 113) was found in the smallRoom 23.12 In the archive room (33) there were fragments of two plates and a mortar. Sincethere is no evidence for storage of such vessels in any of these rooms, the pieces recovered inthe administrative complex were apparently brought there by looters from elsewhere, ulti-mately, perhaps, from Room 38.A doorway from the south portico (21) of the administrative complex led southward toRoom 24, which gave access to a ramp (25) leading eastward by two inclines to the roof of theTreasury. From Room 24 doorways opened to the east and south to corridors of rooms.Southward Room 24 led to a short corridor (26) in which a fragment of a green stone platewas found,3 but the room was otherwise completely lacking in objects. Corridor 26 ran south-ward through Rooms 27 and 28, to a large courtyard (29) in the southern part of the Treasury.There, in the eastern portico (6) off the courtyard, a mortar fragment was found.Eastward, at the junction of Room 24 and a long, narrow corridor (9), a single fragment ofa green stone plate was found. A suite of rooms (10, 12, and 13) off the eastern end of Corri-dor 9 led to the eastern exit of the Treasury building. Room 10 was simply a barren passage-way. Room 12, to the north, had a doorway in its western wall that gave access to the ad-ministrative courtyard (17) in the central part of the Treasury already discussed above. Inalmost the center of Room 12 a green stone pestle fragment was found.\"4 To the north ofRoom 12 a doorway led to Room 13, a guardroom at the eastern exit of the Treasury. Anearlier doorway that had continued the passage northward toward the northern exit of theTreasury had been blocked up, making Room 13 a dead end.The eastern exit of the Treasury opened on \"Garrison Street,\" which faced the soldiers'quarters at the foot of the mountain to the east, Mount Kuh-i-Rahmat. Near the eastern en-trance, both within the guardroom (13) and in the street outside, fragments of tableware werefound. In the street, north of the exit, lay fragments of two green stone plates, one of which(No. 112) was inscribed.'5 In a later excavation in 1949, the Archaeological Institute of Per-sepolis found a beautiful, complete green stone plate (No. 43), inscribed with Aramaic, in thestreet east of the Hall of the Hundred Columns (Room 38).1\"At the north end of the portico (18) of the administrative compound mentioned above, adoor led to Room 16, which then gave access eastward to another suite of corridor rooms(14, 37, 40, 51, and 50) leading to the northern exit of the Treasury building.Room 14 was used for the storage of combustible material as well as for traffic, as its scarredwalls and the layers of ash and charcoal in its debris show.

A bronze pestle (PT6 123) lay at the opening betweenRooms 14 and 37 and a fragment of a green stone plate was found nearby.17 In the northernend of Room 37, where it opened into Room 40, a mortar and pestle in perfect condition werefound.\" Room 40, a long storeroom running northward along the narrow end of Room 38,shows evidence of violent burning. Midway along its length a fragment of a green stone platewas found, apparently dropped by a looter on his way to the northern exit of the Treasury build-ing.The door at the northern end of Room 40 led to a small, square room (51) at the northeast-ern corner of the Treasury which, like Room 40, showed signs of a great conflagration. FromRoom 51 a door led west to the guardroom (50) at the northern exit of the Treasury. It wasused for the storage of tools and other hardware as well as for martial projectiles.Once a doorway in the western wall of the guardroom had opened to a stairway (49) to theroof. This passage had been blocked by a wall, but the plunderers of the Treasury reopened itwith a breach to gain access to the northern exit from the stairway. Schmidt says, \"It seems,however, that the despoilers of the Treasury found this convenient means of access to thenorthern entrance. They breached the southern part of the blocking wall and-after carryingtheir loot from the interior of the building, up Ramp 25 and across the roof-used Stairway 49as a passage to Vestibule 50 and its street exit. They enable us to follow their tracks bydropping some of their plunder at two bottlenecks, namely on Ramp 25 ... and on the stair-way.\"'9 An inscribed fragment of a green stone pestle (No. 123) was found on the stairs, whereit apparently had been dropped by a plunderer coming down from above. In the street outside,just beyond the northwestern corner of the building, a fragment of a green stone mortar (No.124) was recovered.A few other pieces of inscribed green stone objects were later recovered from the sherd pileof the excavation and their provenance was determined by the general area from which thefragments came.20Thus, the distribution of the stone mortars, pestles, and plates in the Treasury clearly indi-cates that the bulk of them had been stored in the large Room 38 and its subsidiary Room 45in the northern part of the Treasury. The remainder was scattered elsewhere, with decreasingfrequency toward the southern and older part of the Treasury complex. Scattered pieces wereoften found in unexpected places, usually along the routes that would be taken by the plunder-ers into the heart of the Treasury or outward toward its exits.Apparently some looters, attracted by the beauty or utility of particular pieces, carriedthem off and were thus responsible for scattering them into the central and even the southernparts of the Treasury, far from Room 38. As more valued items of booty were encounteredand as the loot accumulated, the despoilers became more aware of the bulkiness or weight ofthe stone objects, which they then discarded. Some were purposely smashed and in a fewinstances others were dropped intact on the way. A complete small mortar and pestle weredoubtless carried a long way before they were discarded as a burden, near the northern exitof the building.1~ Schmidt, Persepolis I 185a.18 Mortar No. 33 and uninscribed pestle PT5 8 (Teheran Museum No. 2208).19 Schmidt, Persepolis I 186.20 Nos. 13, 18, 51, 60, 67, 84, and 98.oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IITHE HAOMA CEREMONYT- HE excavator of the mortar, pestle, and plate fragments has called them \"ritual objects\"and has identified them as having been used in the haoma ceremony of the Persianreligion.' The basis for such an identification was the discovery of a seal impressionimperfectly registered on several clay labels of the time of Xerxes which were found in theTreasury at Persepolis.2The seal design portrays two persons standing below a winged sun-disk, the emblem of thePersian god Ahuramazda. The figures flank a fire altar and a stand bearing a mortar and pestleidentical in form with the green stone vessels inscribed in Aramaic that were found in thePersepolis Treasury.The person on the left, bent forward slightly toward the fire altar, seems to be wearing atiara-like headdress.3 His face shows a blurred, beardlike projection, which probably representsthe expected mouth cloth (paddm).4 His garment is a long, belted coat with long sleeves. Heextends several twigs toward the flame, apparently replenishing it.5The figure on the right, standing before the table bearing the mortar and pestle, wears aheaddress such as Strabo describes on Magians. It is of felt, with cheek pieces at the sides thatcome down to cover the lips.6 His mantle, thrown over his shoulders and falling to his knees,there meets his long, rather tight trousers. In his right hand he holds three \"rods,\" which prob-ably represent the twig bundle (barsom) rather than a few haoma twigs.7 His left hand holdsthe top of a slender, canelike staff, which appears to rest on his somewhat advanced rightfoot.8Behind the figure at the right there is an Aramaic legend, him dim ... \"Seal of dim.. ,\"which Cameron once read as \"Seal of Datames.\" He also once identified the owner as the1 Schmidt, Persepolis I 156-200, II 53-56.2 The labels bear the field numbers PT3 384 and PT3 363. See Pl. 1 here.3 The figure on the left is found in only one impression of the seal (PT3 384), where it is blurred and distorted. Schmidt(Persepolis II 26) describes the headdress as \"round (mutilated) ... possibly bashlyk,\" but it seems to be rather rec-tangular, more closely resembling the crownlike headdress found elsewhere (Schmidt, Persepolis II, P1. 7, Seal 23). Thefigure in Seal 23 seems to be similarly clothed. Pausanius (Description of Greece v. 27, 6) describes a Magian as putting atiara on his head before intoning an invocation before the fire altar.Zaehner, Zoroastrianism, Fig. 42; Haug, Parsis, p. 243, n. 1.SHe doubtless represents the Old Persian *ataravaxsa (Elamite ba-tur-ma-ak-sa, Greek pyraithos), the \"fire-watcher.\"6 Strabo Geography xv. 15, C 733.SHe probably represents the frabaretar, who bore the barsom to the fire.8 Similarly the spear-bearing soldiers on the stairway leading to the Apadana at Persepolis as well as the leaders of theKashshites, Bactrians, Saka, Indians, and Cilicians: each rests the end of his spear or stave on the toe of his extendedfoot. Likewise the spear-bearers in the glazed brick reliefs found at Susa.The rod in the seal impression is perhaps the \"reed staff\" which Magians carried. Several classical writers mentionsuch a Magian \"wand.\" Strabo (Geography xv. 14, C 732) claims that the Magians touched the sacrificial flesh with it.Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae xii. 530e) quotes Phoenix as declaring that the Magians kindled the sacred flame by touch-ing \"the god\" with their wand.

Shortly thereafter the drinkingof the haoma intoxicant takes place.\"The use of an intoxicating drink, which is called soma by the people of India and haoma bythe Iranians,12 is one of the earliest and most persistent elements in the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples. The importance assigned to the drink by both of those ancient peoples clearlyshows that its use must have originated in a common source in prehistoric times.One tradition ascribes the origin of its use to the primeval man Yima (the Indic Yama),who was believed to have been the first to slaughter oxen as sacrifices to the ancient gods andassociated such sacrifices with the drinking of the juice called haoma.'3 Another legend tracesits first use to a certain prophet, Haoma-Diiraosha or Haoma-Frishmi, a learned, pious manof the early period of the Peshdadian dynasty, before the Indians and Iranians separated to be-come distinct peoples. While meditating on the heights of the Hukairya peak in the ElburzMountains, he discovered a plant that was nutritious, invigorating, and health-promoting.From it he pressed a golden liquid which ever afterward bore his name, Haoma, and he deviseda ritual to accompany its pressing which would teach religion and morality to aid all man-kind.14Whatever its origin, soma/haoma at a very early period was freely prepared and drunk byall who sought its life-giving and life-preserving properties. It was the first liquid to pass thelips of the new-born babe and the last draught given to a dying person.15 According to theVisparad (12:5), it was hoped that the mortar for pounding the plant would be used widelyin houses and streets, cities and countries.16 In India during the Vedic period worshipers couldsay, \"We have drunk soma; we have become immortal,\"' 7 and among Iranians an epithet forhaoma was diraoSa, \"the averter of death.\" No special adept was necessary for its making,and long before a special caste of priests was recognized, the householder himself produced theintoxicant. Such practice long continued among the daeva-worshipers, who claimed that, ashouseholders, they were also priests.'\"9 In Schmidt, Persepolis II 26, n. 122.10 See p. 28. 11 Modi, Religious Ceremonies, pp. 293-94.12 The words soma and haoma are cognate, originally referring to the same plant and the liquid derived from it. Theword, while used to designate a plant, is not in fact a botanical name but a development from an Indo-Iranian verbmeaning \"press.\" Thus, as Eilers has indicated, the word is as noncommittal as the \"squash\" used by the British to indicateany one of a variety of pressed drinks; see W.

It wasregarded as a substance consumed by the gods to ensure their own immortality and to increasetheir strength against their enemies, and in the Yasna of the Seven Chapters, which maypossibly be dated as early as the sixth century B.C., the haoma plant is listed as an object ofworship along with the earth, sky, water, fire, and other natural phenomena.19The use of haoma in early Iranian religion was certainly more diversified than we find it inthe later cultus. It accompanied sacrifices and presumably was used in a variety of other ways.Plutarch describes a Persian rite which, if genuine, must preserve the praxis of a propitiatorysacrifice used by daeva-worshipers to placate their dreaded gods. Plutarch claims,Zoroaster taught them [i.e., the Persians] to make to the one [i.e., to \"Horomazes\" = Ahuramazda]vows and thank offerings; to the other [i.e., to \"Arimanius\" = Ahriman] sacrifices for averting evil andthe things of depressing appearance. For example, while pounding in a mortar a certain herb calledomomi [i.e., haoma], they appeal to Hades and Darkness; then they mix it with the blood of a slaughteredwolf, take it to a place where the sun never shines, and throw it away. The reason for this is becausethey regard some plants as belonging to the beneficent god and others to the evil demon.2 0In India, in Vedic times, it was primarily for the da6va Indra, the chief god of the Brahmans,the patron of the warrior bands of the Aryans, that the worshipers squeezed and drank theintoxicating soma and gave the god his share. Naturally, the soma ceremony in India came tobe of particular interest to military men.2'Among the Iranians the haoma rite became associated principally with the god Mithra,who, after a somewhat varied career, had come to assume the warlike character of the Indicgod Indra.22 It has been said of the Mithra Yasht of the Avesta, \"Throughout the poem,Mithra is preeminently a god of battles; he was, therefore, especially fitted to become, as hedid in later times, the favorite deity of the Roman soldier.\"23 Nyberg has described Mithraismas a religion of warriors and chieftains.24It is probably the use of haoma to which Greek writers refer when they describe royaldrunkenness during the Mithraic festival. Athenaeus quotes Ctesias as saying that Persiankings could drink heavily on only one day of the year, the day of their sacrifice to Mithra.25He also quotes the seventh book of Duris' History to the effect that \"at the festival of Mithraalone, of all the festivals celebrated by the Persians, the king gets drunk and dances 'thePersian (dance).' \"2619 I. Gershevitch, \"Zoroaster's Own Contribution,\" JNES XXIII (1964) 14-15, n. 11.20 Plutarch Moralia; Isis and Osiris v. 46.The rite described is \"Zoroastrian\" only in the sense of being \"Persian.\" One must differentiate between the ancientceremony used as an illustration and the theological framework in which it is set. Zaehner (Zoroastrianism, pp. 124-25) saysthat Plutarch's Persian theology, which was presumably derived from Theopompus, is \"a half-way house between Catho-lic Zoroastrianism and the Mithraism we meet in the Roman Empire.\"The non-Zoroastrian nature of the rite is manifest in the fact that in Zoroastrianism wolves rank as most evil animals(Yasna 9:18) and should be killed (Vendidad 18:65). A wolf must be seen by a man before it spies him, or evil results willfollow (Yasna 9:21). Also, the surprising association of haoma with the wolf and Ahriman seems to reflect the ancientusage in which haoma was offered principally to the daevas in India and presumably also originally in Iranian religion.21 Zaehner, Zoroastrianism, pp. 97-116.22 The question whether Mithra, like Indra, was originally a daeva is debatable. Frye (Heritage, pp. 114-15) and Haug(Parsis, pp. 272, 288) claim that Mithra was a daeva, while Zaehner (Zoroastrianism, pp. 97-116) suggests that he wasoriginally an ahura who attained the warlike characteristics of the daeva Indra.2a H.

In the days of Zoroaster, the daeva priests and prophets of the Brahmans, thekavi's and karapan's,\" the opponents of the Zoroastrians, prepared solemn soma feasts tosecure the assistance of the god Indra and, after the sacrificial feasts, during which they weretotally inebriated by soma, they led their people in predatory excursions against the Iraniansettlers.28Zoroaster reacted vigorously against such a situation. He execrated the kavi's and karapan's,inquiring of Ahuramazda, \"When, 0 Wise One, will the warriors understand the message?When wilt thou smite this filth of drink through which sacrificers wickedly and the evil mastersof the countries of their own will commit their deeds of malice?\"29This outburst by the prophet has created controversy among students of Iranian religion.Because of the bitterness of his denunciation, it is often claimed that Zoroaster condemned theuse of haoma and ordered its suppression in Persian religion. Gershevitch, for example, callsattention to Herodotus' description of the part played by the worshiper and the Magus duringthe sacrifice and indicates not only that there is no reference to haoma but that Herodotusexpressly states that the Persians \"pour no libations,\"3 0 from which Gershevitch concludedthat \"no haoma ritual was involved.\"\"3 Furthermore, he indicates that the name of Haomadoes not appear in the religious calendar adopted in 441 B.c., during the reign of Artaxerxes I,in which most of the deities of the Zarathustric religion appear as the religious names of eachday and each month of the year.32But Zaehner repudiates such a view as extreme and contends that it was only against theabuse of haoma that Zoroaster inveighed. He insists that the prophet was probably disgustedby the drunkenness of the daEva-worshipers because it seemed to him a sacrilege against theplant-god Haoma, \"the sacramental center of the cult.\"3 3 He says, \"There is nothing in the(Yasna) texts that forces us to conclude that Zoroaster condemned animal sacrifices and thehaoma cult as such\" and \"all that Zoroaster seems to have condemned ... is a form of animalsacrifice in which the sacrificial flesh was given to laity to consume and in which, perhaps,-to judge from the reference to the burning of the haoma-the sacrificial meat was sprinkledwith the sacred fluid and then roasted.\"34Zaehner recalls that, according to Yasna 3:2, haoma was pressed and offered to the right-eous fravashi of Zoroaster and he concludes that if, indeed, the prophet had banned haoma, itwould be incredible that anyone who claimed to be a true Zoroastrian would insult the prophet,within a generation or two after his death, by offering to his soul what Zoroaster himself hadoutlawed. He concludes, \"So far as we can tell, the haoma rite has been the central liturgical27 Zaehner (Zoroastrianism, p: 37) regards the karapan's as liturgical priests and the kavi's as local rulers; Frye (Heritage,p. 36) thinks of the kavi's as \"somie kind of 'priest-kings' of eastern Iran who upheld the ancient Aryan rites and prac-tices\" and the karapan's, \"mumblers,\" as another kind of priest. M. Haug (Parsis, pp. 289-91) identifies the kavi's andkarapan's, in this context, with the daEva priests of the Brahmans of India (cft. Yasht 32:3, 48:10).28 Haug, Parsis, pp. 173, 291-92; cf.

In India, as the cult be-came more regulated, only the upper three castes were permitted to drink soma, and thenonly during religious ceremonies.36 In Iran, in accord with Xenophon's observation that \"thePersians consider the employment of professionals far more important in matters of religionthan in any other sphere,\"37 the operation of the official cult was put fully into the hands ofthe Magian priests. In modern Parsi procedure, too, the extracting and mixing of haoma isdone only by the priests and, as in India, except for some use for medicinal purposes, the haomais consumed only by them.Drastic revisions of the ancient religious rites occurred in Iran, but, because of later re-versions and revisions of the cultus,3s it is difficult to determine Zoroaster's part in the change.All that is certain is that both the Indians and the Iranians abandoned the primitive Aryanmanner of preparing the sacred drink and that the Iranians invented a new procedure morein harmony with the spirit of their later religion. Because Zoroaster himself never mentions thereformed haoma ceremony in the Gathas, it seems doubtful whether it existed during hislifetime or if it did, whether he approved of it. But the haoma rite even today is central in thereligious ceremonies of the Parsis.The details of the modern Parsi ceremony, a mixture of ancient and relatively modern ele-ments, are quite well known. The use of dry haoma twigs (hdm sali) is now in vogue. The\"haoma\" twigs are washed, purified, and stored in a special container for thirteen months andthirteen days, with periodic washings and purifications, before they are used in the haomaceremony. Because of epithets used to describe the haoma twigs, Pavry contends that originallythe fresh haoma plant (haoma jairi) was used in the ceremony.3 9 The plant then used was calledgaoman, \"full of juice/milk,\" huiti, \"juicy,\" zairi, \"green,\" and uzaddt, \"fermenting,\" as wellas hubaoidhi, \"fragrant,\" in the ancient records, according to Pavry.40Today the haoma twigs are mixed with milk and the roots of the pomegranate or juice of thepomegranate fruit and are pounded together in the mortar.41 The present ritual is long andtedious, with each action minutely prescribed and accompanied by a carefully synchronizedrecitation of the Haoma Yasht (Yasna 9-10) and pious formulae.42The preliminary stage of the ceremony involves a careful purification of the officiatingpriests and of the implements and materials essential to the ritual. The necessary items areset forth, each in its prescribed place, near the priest who will operate the mortar and pestle.The proper hand to be used at each point in the ritual, the direction of movement during thepounding of the mortar, the number of times for the performance of each repetitive act, andthe precise passage of the Haoma Yasht to accompany each action are all carefully prescribed.85 Ibid.36 E. W. Hopkins, \"Soma,\" Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics XI (New York, 1921) 685-86.Even in modern times in India great quantities of soma are consumed by the priests during the religious ceremonies.Modi (Religious Ceremonies, p. 297) indicates that at the Jyotist(oma ceremony each of the Brahman priests must drinksome soma and the chief priests, such as the adhvaryu and the hotd, must drink a very large quantity.37 Xenophon Cyropaedia viii. 3, 2.38 Gershevitch (in JNES XXIII 12-32) has discussed the role of the Magians in the corruption of Zoroastrianreligion from the time of Darius I to the Sassanian period through the re-introduction of diverse ancient ideas andpractices.39 Pavry, Iranian Studies, pp. 165, 196.40 Ibid., pp. 160, 196. 1 Ibid., p. 165.42 A detailed description of the modern Parsi ceremony is given by Modi, Religious Ceremonies, pp. 287-96, 306; cf.Haug, Parsis, pp. 394-403.oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE HAOMA CEREMONYSometimes a key word in the ritual is the cue for the beginning of the action and at othertimes the movement is synchronized with specific words recited during the action. Periodicallythe pounding of the twigs is interrupted for the pounding of the mortar itself in a set pattern.Such sonorous poundings are doubtless a primitive survival of an ancient practice once in-tended to frighten away lurking daevas. The haoma ceremony is now and perhaps from quiteancient times has been associated with the sacred fire and the use of the sacred bundle oftwigs.Tradition persists that the assemblage for the haoma ceremony, now consisting of but twopriests, once required eight participants43 and in some manuscripts of the Vendidad a diagramis given showing their placement for the rite.44 The members were arranged in a rectangularpattern oriented to the points of the compass in the ceremonial room (Arvis gah), with a priestat each end of the ceremonial space and three on each side.The chief priest, who sat at the northern end of the space, was the zaotar (1),45 correspondingto the hold of the Vedic ceremony, who recited the mantras of the Rig-Veda. The zaotar super-intended the haoma rite and recited the religious texts that accompanied the ceremonialactions.At his right hand, in the northwestern corner of the ceremonial space was the hdvandn (2), whooperated the mortar and pestle in the pressing of the haoma juice. At the left hand of the zaotar,opposite the hdvanan, in the northeastern corner, was the frabaretar (4), who bore the barsomto the fire.4 6To the right of the havanan, in the west, was the asnator (6), who washed and cleaned theceremonial implements.4 Opposite him, in the east and at the left of the frabaretar, was theraejwiskara (7), who mixed the haoma with the other ingredients. It is he who has survived,as the rathwi or rdspi, the modern acolyte of the chief priest in the Parsi ritual.48In the south of the ceremonial space sat the sraoadvareza (8), corresponding to the prati-prasthatd of the Brahmans. He represented the angel Srosa in the ceremony and bore a swordto drive away the evil spirits.

During the ritual the officiatingpriest calls the roll of his seven assistants. His subordinate then leaves his post, assumes thedifferent positions, one after another, and answers, \"I am here\" each time for himself and hissix absent colleagues. Thus, the chief priest of earlier times (zaotar) has retained his demanding,specialized role today and the indispensable dtaravaxza, under the old title of the raeowifkara,has absorbed the identities and responsibilities of the other priests of earlier days.5 3Perhaps the greatest change in the haoma ceremony since ancient times has been the sub-stitution of other plants for the original haoma.54 The Avesta indicates that the original homeof the plant was especially Mount Elburz (Avestan Hara Berezaiti), whence it was spread bybirds in all directions into the mountains and valleys of Iran. It is described as abundant, hav-ing branches and sprigs that are tender and bending, fragrant, juicy, of yellow or golden color,and beautiful in appearance.55In India the Brahmans now use the stalks of the Pitica plant for their soma,56 and theParsis in India, who believe that they are importing the original plant from Persia, now usethe Ephedra gerardiana (Gnetaceae), which is found in Beluchistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir,and western Tibet. This plant meets many of the specifications of the Avestan description ofthe ancient haoma plant. It grows as a bush in an upright mass to a height of one or two feetand is leafless, consisting of jointed twigs and branches of somewhat yellowish color. Whencovered with flowers, the bush appears golden and it often bears the name zairi-gaona, \"goldencolor.\" The juice pressed from its twigs, too, has a golden color, and it has an intoxicatingand narcotic effect on the drinker.57Although most modern scholars assume that the Ephedra was the ancient haoma plant,there have been many competing suggestions. Aitchison found that in Beluchistan the Peri-ploca aphylla (Asclepiadaceae) was also called ham (haoma).58 Hopkins and Windischmannhave suggested that it might be Sarcostemma acidum (Asclepiadaceae) or S. viminalis, whichare called \"soma\" and produce a juice with an astringent, narcotic, and intoxicating effect.59B1 E.

The product now consumed in the Parsi cere-mony certainly differs greatly from the haoma liquid of antiquity. Its potency is greatly re-duced, and its effectiveness as an intoxicant has been eliminated. Only a few twigs of a plantare now used in the preparation of haoma, and the juice resulting, greatly diluted by otheringredients, is drunk immediately after mixing, without time for fermentation. Nyberg claimsthat \"haoma,\" ritually prepared according to the prescription of the later Avesta, containsnothing more than water and pomegranate. In the praxis of the Parsis it is always unfermentedplant juice and not an intoxicating drink.75 In modern times a new-born child is given a tokendrink of molasses or sugar water instead of the intoxicating haoma used in ancient times.76Details of the modern haoma ceremony are well known, but it is difficult to probe behindit to the earlier forms of the rite. It is entirely probable that, as a result of what was believedto be Zoroaster's teaching, the use of haoma was curbed or possibly even banned, but it wasnever lost entirely. The use of haoma was a very ancient one with a firm hold on the masses ofthe people, and they have continued even into modern times to use the substance privately fora variety of purposes. Aitchison reported that \"among the Pathans of the Khyber Pass andall over that country, twigs of Ephedra, which are called 'haoma' are made into a decoctionwith water and used very largely as a household remedy in sickness. It is considered to possesshealing and health-promoting properties, as was attributed to the ancient haoma. Moreover,throughout the mountains where Ephedra is found, the ashes of its burned twigs are mixedwith snuff 'to make it more irritating.' \"77 People have been reluctant to surrender the precioussubstance which has long been believed to promote health and promise immortality.It is now certain that haoma was used in Persepolis in Achaemenid times, at least from thetime of Xerxes. The name Haoma-data, which has long been known from the Aramaic papyriof the time of Artaxerxes I, is now found also in the ritual texts from Persepolis.7s Cameronbelieves that the title of the haoma-mixer (ra&Owijkara) is found in an Elamite Treasury textof the second year of Xerxes.79 The seal impressions on labels in the Persepolis Treasury in thetime of Xerxes portray a scene from the haoma ceremony80 and a relatively large number ofgreen stone ritual vessels such as are depicted on the seal impressions attest a rather extensiveuse of the rite at Persepolis in the days of Xerxes and Artaxerxes I.It is clear that older forms of religious practice sometimes were re-introduced or persistedclandestinely among the people in Achaemenid times.

Cumont has described later Mithraism as \"a branch torn from the ancient trunk\"which \"has preserved in many respects the characteristics of the ancient worship of the Iraniantribes.\"8 3 The later Mithraic rites also included the preparation and drinking of an intoxicantby the initiates.8 4 Cumont declares, \"In the Mazdean service, the celebrant consecrated thebread and the water which he mingled with the intoxicating juice of the haoma prepared byhim, and he consumed these foods during the performance of his sacrifice. These ancient usageswere preserved in the Mithraic initiations, save that for the Haoma, a plant unknown in theOccident, was substituted the juice of the vine.\"\"85In the light of all facts at our disposal, it seems likely that in the green stone ritual vesselsbearing Aramaic texts from Persepolis, we see evidence that already in Achaemenid times aproto-Mithraic cult was actively operative in the Persian army.81 R.

Although all such objects were probablyused for ritual purposes, not all of them are inscribed. Texts on the mortars, plates, andthe tray are written on the bottom of the base of the vessel, where there is room for a full oreven an expanded text. Those on the pestles are usually found atop the head of the object,but a few writers gained more room by putting the inscription along the shaft of the pestle.2It is not surprising to find Aramaic used in ancient Persia, for there was long preparationfor it. By late Assyrian times, Aramaic was already firmly established as an important lan-guage of the Near East, where it was used especially in the western areas of the Assyrian em-pire. But it had a strong hold, too, in Assyria and Babylonia proper, where its use extendedinto the very palaces of the Assyrian kings. It was not a language imposed on others by aconquering people. In fact, most of the Aramaic that survives was written by non-Aramaeanpeople, many of whom were not even Semitic. It won its way and status as an adaptable anduseful tool. In a world using largely a rather complicated cuneiform system of writing (forexample, Akkadian, Elamite, Old Persian) which had to be impressed, etched, scratched, orcut into durable materials, a simple alphabet which could not only be scratched or cut intohard surfaces but could also be painted or written in ink upon them or even upon such perishablemedia as papyrus, leather, or birch bark had much to commend its use. Aramaic was a vig-orous competitor. In its wide acceptance in the ancient world it became a language of diplo-macy and commerce in the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires.3It was under the Persians that Aramaic reached its zenith as a world language. Its extendedemployment then was based on the broad foundation of usage already established in theAssyro-Babylonian age. As a means of writing, Aramaic was carried wherever the influenceof Persia went. From Abydos on the Hellespont to the most remote frontier of Egypt, Aramaichas been found. There is witness of it from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to the midstof the Syrian Desert and eastward through Kurdistan and the Zagros district to Afghanistanand India.4Achaemenid Persian writings are best known from monumental texts written in the OldPersian alphabet and language, but Nicholas of Damascus, Ctesias, Diodorus Siculus, andothers agree that parchment was used for ordinary writing purposes in Persia.5 A fragment of1 On the basis of a few linguistic phenomena, the question has been raised whether these texts are in heterographicwriting, to be read as Persian. This is a constant and perplexing problem in the field of Persian Aramaic, wherein thenumber of Persian loanwords gradually increases with time and there is sometimes evidence of Persian syntax.According to the usual view of Iranologists, the early, Achaemenid date of these texts would argue against a theoryof heterographic writing and, although there are Persian loanwords, some evidence of Persian syntax, and even a fewtroublesome verb forms (see pp. 65-66), the texts can be read rather smoothly as Aramaic.2 Nos. 17, 81, 123. 3 R.

Diodorus reportsthat Ctesias of Cnidus, who served as a physician in the court of Artaxerxes II, saw royalannals there which reported the important events of each year. He claims to have studied andused them in writing his history for the Greeks.o0 The Bible, too, mentions such a \"Book ofRemembrances\" (Ezra 4:15), from which a quotation is made in the Aramaic language.Later tradition indicates an early interest in libraries in Persia.

Gershevitch notes, \"the scribes . .. lost familiarity with theletters and spelling conventions of the Old Persian cuneiform script and could not be expectedto do more than to slightly adapt existing patterns to new needs. Even within these limits thescribes were apt to fall back on Aramaic spelling conventions.\"\"4A curious spelling error in the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius I and Xerxes near Hamadanled Herzfeld to conjecture that the original text used by the scribes had been written inAramaic characters in which the sign for both the Old Persian u and v would be expressedby the same Semitic sign waw.15 Gershevitch suggests that it was because of the dominance ofAramaic in Persia that no Achaemenian king later than Xerxes insisted on having his ownwords inscribed.166 E.

Since the only wordsthat are legible are Iranian, the text is probably in Persian language written in the Aramaicalphabet.1 Such writing is characteristic of Middle Persian, Pahlavi, which is truly the bestevidence of the extent and importance of Aramaic in the earlier period. Persian loanwords arefound interspersed in Aramaic texts throughout the Persian period and later; but in Pahlavicommon words are spelled as in Aramaic but are regarded as logograms which, when read, areto be pronounced and understood by their Persian equivalents. At times added letters, whichdistort the Aramaic spelling, give a phonetic clue to the proper identification of their Persiancounterparts.1The question of when the system of writing Aramaic with Iranian loanwords changed to oneof Iranian written in Aramaic letters with Aramaic ideograms is difficult to determine sinceit was a gradual development. Haug has asserted that Pahlavi \"exhibits a large admixture ofSemitic words, which increase as we trace it further back, so that the earliest inscriptions ofthe Sassanian dynasty may be described as being written in a Semitic language, with some ad-mixture of Iranian words and a prevailingly Iranian construction.\"'\" Frye has suggested thatthe transition was made in the farther East (for example, Afghanistan) by about 200 B.c. andin the West (for example, Parthia) in the first century B.c.20Persian texts on leather, papyrus, and other perishable media from the early period havenot survived in Persia because of its unfavorable climate.21 Only that written on durable ma-terials remains. In the storeroom of the Treasury which held the archives of the local adminis-tration at Persepolis (Room 33) the final conflagration that destroyed the building was par-ticularly furious, scorching and discoloring the plaster, burning the floor, and baking the mud-brick walls to a considerable depth.22 The only records recovered from the archive room wereclay tablets written in cuneiform Elamite. But with them were found a large number ofspheroid lumps of clay or bitumen, each with an oval or rectangular perforation. Such tubes,like napkin rings, could have held rolls of parchment or papyrus. Impressions of strings markthe inner walls and there was sometimes found within them remains of carbonized or decayedmaterial.23 The parchment or papyrus that they may have contained would have contributedmightily to the intense fire that destroyed the archive room.Cameron has conjectured that each Elamite tablet in the Treasury was attached to a claysealing which encircled a parchment or papyrus roll inscribed in the Aramaic language andscript, an Aramaic counterpart of the Elamite tablet. He further suggests that every Persianorder was translated into Aramaic, \"the official language,\" before its translation into Elamite.24He concludes that \"over a large part of the empire Aramaic was the language of the govern-ment offices (the chancellory) and of communication between master and subject.\"25\" E.

References to \"skins\" and \"pens\" as rationed items, pre-sumably for scribes, indicate that such media were used in Persia for the writing of Aramaic.Achaemenid seal impressions, some with Aramaic legends, were impressed on both the Elamiteand Aramaic tablets. Among the important finds at Persepolis was also a \"votive cylinder\"bearing four or five lines of Aramaic in addition to a cuneiform text.27Perhaps the most important Aramaic texts from Persepolis are those on the green stoneritual objects here being published.

He thus assumes that the vessels were brought toPersepolis from remote places by visitors attending the New Year's Festival or by men justpassing through who wanted the \"ritual capital\" to have a memorial of their presence there.The word srk or srwk, if a geographical name, might suggest the rather remote Sirbk (2hpwK)mentioned by Isidore of Charax,11 the Sirakene (2ZpaKrnn) of Ptolemy,'2 which was laterknown as Saralhs (ujy) and Serkas ( Iy).'3 It lay quite far from Persepolis, in Khorasan,midway between Nishapur and Merv, near the ancient Tus, the former capital of Khorasan.'4The site, rather extensive in later times, was one of the most celebrated fortresses of Khorasan.It has been suggested that the word prkn might represent the Parikani mentioned byHerodotus, a people that he associates with both the Maka and the Yautiya, who dwelt inArachosia and Seistan\"5 and with the Orthocorybantis of the Median satrapy in the lands eastof the Caspian Sea.l 6 Because Darius I located the Yautiya in Parsa,17 Junge would locate theParikani in Kerman, in the east of Persis.'8But the Parikani are a people and not a fortress, even though their name may be preservedin the city Parikani in Persis, mentioned by Hecataeus (TrappKavl 7rbXLs TrEcpcLK).19 Despitethe similarity of consonantal structure, it does not seem possible that either the Parikanipeople or the remote city of Sirok have anything to do with the prkn and srk/srwk of the ritualvessels. Nor has it been possible yet to link the word hst with any known fortress in Persia.Although it is tempting, in the interest of consistency, to find the names of scatteredfortresses in the words srk, prkn, and hst, there are some important considerations that advisecaution. The sites suggested were all a considerable distance from Persepolis, where the rela-tively large number of vessels was found. Furthermore, the remarkable homogeneity in theseritual objects suggests a place of common origin: All are made of the same green chert ma-terial; all have the same pattern and workmanship; all are inscribed in ink, in the same places,in the same language, and with essentially the same formula; all have the same continuingstaff of officials, so uniform that they can be used for a close dating of the texts.20 Moreover,all of the inscribed ritual vessels were found together in the Treasury of the \"ritual capital,\"Persepolis, most of them within the same room.It seems extremely unlikely that such remarkable uniformity would be found in vesselsprocessed independently in scattered fortresses in the remote East and that such a large num-ber of them, some of considerable bulk and weight, would find their way fortuitously to acommon storeroom in the Treasury of the reputed ritual capital of the Persian empire.

It seems likely,too, that the haoma ritual was performed in or near the ritual capital, perhaps in connectionwith the New Year's Festival, during which, according to al-Birini,21 the third session was forthe warriors, or during the other great festival dedicated to Mithra, the later Mihrajdn.2The words srk, prkn, and hst must have a meaning other than geographical. Admittedly ageographical name usually precedes byrt', but another construction is also possible in Aramaic.The words srk, prkn, and hst could stand in construct relationship with \"the fortress,\" referringeither to the haoma rite itself or to some place at Persepolis where the haoma twigs werepressed in the mortars.While it is conceivable that the word prkn might represent the Iranian paragnah, the termused to describe the part of the haoma ceremony during which the liquid is extracted fromthe twigs, prior to the drinking ceremony,23 the rendering of the Persian phoneme g by theAramaic k would be unusual and unlikely in the Aramaic of Persepolis. Some other explana-tion is preferable.It is probable that the word prkn is Semitic and related to other words found in diversecircumstances in the ritual texts but all related to the Semitic root prk, meaning in Aramaic,\"to rub,\" \"to pulverize,\" or \"to grind\"-the very actions involved in the use of a mortar andpestle.2\" A word pyrk is sometimes used to indicate the \"crushing\" function of the pestle25 anda substantive prk is found (No. 5) in a context in which it seems to indicate a ceremony ofcrushing haoma2 6 or a place in which such an operation was performed.Since the word prkn is not found elsewhere in Aramaic, its vocalization is still a matter ofconjecture. As a purely Aramaic word the final -n might be expected to indicate the Aramaicaffix -an for an abstract substantive or one of adjectival character. It could thus be an expres-sion for the act of crushing and might be rendered as \"the (haoma-)crushing ceremony,\" asis done here in the translations of these texts.27The word srk, which occurs before byrt' with the greatest frequency in these ritual texts,has been extremely perplexing. Although usually spelled srk, a single example (No. 54:1) hassrwk, which seems to indicate that the letter w represents a vowel rather than a consonant.A possible clue to its meaning may be found in a word spelled similarly and also used in areligio-military context in the so-called War Scroll from the Jewish community at Qumran.28Because Yadin relates the word to the Jewish word serek, \"habit,\" \"custom,\" from a rootmeaning \"to cling,\" \"to hold fast,\" \"to adhere,\"29 he renders the word as serekh. He ignores theone instance (col. v, 1. 5) in which the word was spelled srwk, which would agree with the singlevariant in a Persepolis ritual text.3021 Al-Birini, Chronology of Ancient Nations, trans.

Meillet and Ben-veniste, Grammaire, pp. 154-55, Sec. 265), to indicate the ceremonial space (Arvis-gdh or Dar-i-Meher) wherein the ritualobjects were used.

In the Qumran text the word was later altered to sdwr (sidd·r) meaning \"order,\" \"arrangement\"; cf.Yadin, Scroll, p. 144.22oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The term srk as used in Qumran is somewhat complex in meaning and difficult to define.Yadin finds it in two related senses which he designates as the \"Battle Serekh\" and the \"RitualSerekh.\"31 The former, concerned with organizational and tactical affairs of the army,3 2 seemsirrelevant to the use of the word srk in the ritual vessels of Achaemenid Persepolis.The Ritual Serekh involves the religious or, more precisely, the cultic aspects of militaryaffairs. In the Qumran context it is concerned with the method of fulfilling the laws of theJewish Torah within the context of war, especially with the \"Prayer for the Appointed Timeof Battle.\"33 Yadin claims, \"The regulations or serekh must specify in detail the laws of theTorah and the laws of tactics and strategy and the interrelation between them.\"3\"Since the haoma rite at Persepolis, with its set recitations and minutely prescribed move-ments, was performed by military officials, perhaps for military as well as personal reasons,35the srk at Persepolis may refer to the cultic pressing and drinking of haoma as a realistic andpractical military phenomenon,3\" as valid for the Persians as the \"Prayer for the AppointedTime of Battle\" was for the Jews.Still another aspect of the Ritual Serekh is encountered at Qumran. Yadin notes, \"Specialinterest attaches, however, to the numerous instances in which the word serekh occurs in thisscroll to indicate the actual body or unit, as arranged into a formation or acting accordingto a prescribed order.\"\"37 With such usage he compares one of the meanings of the Greek raC,as \"a congregation or group of people making up a religious or political body.\"38 Thus, theQumran text mentions \"the men of the serekh\" (col. iii, 1. 1), \"the elders of the serekh\" (col.xiii, sec. 17, 1. 1), and \"the serekh of god\" (col. iii, 1. 3). Yadin therefore sees in the serekh asused at Qumran, \"at least among its members, one of the official names of the sect,\"\"9 themembers of the order in general, as organized in a military structure.Thus, as used at Qumran, srk had a quite complex meaning. It could signify disciplinaryrule, custom, order, and prescription. But its use extended as well to the men responsible forcarrying out the prescribed orders and even to an actual body of men as arranged in a pre-scribed formation or acting according to a prescribed order.At Persepolis, too, the term srk/srwk appears to have cultic rather than geographical sig-nificance. The haoma ceremony in antiquity was of military value in its promise of divinesupport leading to victory over the foe, just as the Jewish prayers and prescribed ritual werebelieved to have military effectiveness. As we know it and as it must have been also in earliertimes, the haoma ceremony was a rigidly prescribed performance. The celebrants mentionedin the Persepolis texts who bear high military titles doubtless sought both personal and mili-tary values in the haoma ceremony.In the ritual texts the term srk/srwk is as difficult to define as it is at Qumran. It might meanseveral things. It could signify the prescribed ritual with an emphasis on the orderliness ofthe procedure. Or, since the haoma rite was observed by a relatively small group of partici-pants at a time, the srk might refer more narrowly to the celebrants seated at their closelyprescribed posts, following the rigid order of service.40Because of the limited context in which it is found in the ritual texts and because of thecomplexity of the concept there, it is impossible to be even as precise at Persepolis as at31 Yadin, Scroll, p. 6. 34 Ibid., p. 5.82 Ibid., pp. 149-50. \"s See pp. 36-37.\"3 Ibid., pp. 6, 303.36 Historically, in earlier days at least, the haoma ceremony preceded military expeditions; cf.

The form hvasta must be secondary, with the vocalism of the present, as the Indo-European system of formingpast participles requires. Professor Emmerick compares the situation with that of *hvax, \"to sleep.\" We have Avestanxvax, past participle x'axta-, whereas in Old Indian we have svax-, past participle, suxta-.

Gershevitch, A Grammar of Manichean Sogdian [Oxford,1954], § 397, p. 61).On this basis, the word hst, hfsta, would be an Iranian parallel to the Semitic prkn, \"crushing ceremony,\" found underidentical circumstances.43 In a letter of April 23, 1968, Professor Harmatta has written, \"I can reassuringly establish the sense of the termhat as 'haoma-feast.' \" Presumably he will present his views more fully after this book appears in print.24oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"VTHE OFFICIALSEXCEPT on a number of pestle tops where lack of space has resulted in the omission of allofficials,' the celebrant is always associated with at least one and often two or three ofthe officials mentioned in the green chert ritual vessels, the segan, the treasurer (gnzbr'),and the sub-treasurer ('pgnzbr ).The segan appears with greater frequency than the others. Except in two texts (Nos. 22and 116), whenever only one official is mentioned, it is always the segan.2 In a single abbrevi-ated text (No. 54), where a name appears without a title, the reference is probably to the segan.In one of the exceptional texts mentioned above (No. 22) only the treasurer is named and inthe other (No. 116) the treasurer and sub-treasurer are found without the segan.Principally on mortars and plates, where more room is available for writing, but also on afew pestles where the writing is quite small, all three officials are named with the celebrant.3Seven plates mention all three officials.4 One pestle that has its text written along its shaft(No. 81) also has three, but of the many inscribed on the top of the head only three (Nos. 7,23, and 39) have that many.Of texts that name two officials beside the celebrant, twenty-nine mention the segan andtreasurer5 and eleven have the segan and sub-treasurer.6It is impossible to determine why the number of officials in the texts should vary. One mightsurmise that the availability of officers at the time determined their number and identity, butit is probable that the number of officers participating in the ceremony was constant, despitethe number mentioned in the text. From the statistics given above, it appears that there issome correlation between the number of officers mentioned and the amount of space availablefor the text. This seems supported by the following circumstance. The celebrant Haoma-datapresented a set of objects in the nineteenth year of Xerxes. A full corps of three officers is men-tioned on the mortar (No. 14), where adequate space was available for the text, but only twoare found on the pestle (No. 15), where space is at a premium.THE SeganThe title s&gan is a loanword in Aramaic from the Akkadian title Saknu.

Johns declares, \"It is clear that the Saknu's position was properly that of locum tenensfor the king; a 'delegate,' a 'deputy,' the forerunner and closely similar parallel of the Persiansatrap.\"'0 The aaknu in Assyria was the official most frequently named and he is always namedfirst when mentioned with other officers.The early importance of the title is reflected in Biblical Aramaic by its listing immediatelyafter that of the satrap (Dan. 3:2), and in one instance (Dan. 6:8) it even precedes that title.In the Aramaic papyri of the Achaemenid period officers of relatively high rank were calledsegan and their function, like that of the judge, was to hear cases at law.\" In such a capacitythe segan leads in the series of magistrates, \"segan, lord, and judge\" (sgn wmr' wdyn),2 as itdoes also when it stands alone with either \"lord\" or \"judge.\"13 If, as Cowley believes, \"thelord\" in the papyri always refers to Prince Arsames, the satrap of Egypt,'\" the segan associatedwith him must have been a person of relatively high rank indeed.'5 Johns indicates that inAssyria the saknu was often mentioned with the hazanu, \"the chief civil magistrate of the city\"and that the saknu was \"the representative of the central authority and very likely, as such,the chief military authority.\"16In the Biblical books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which portray events of the Achaemenidperiod, the segan's in Palestine are constantly associated with the local Jewish rulers (horim,\"nobles\"'7), apparently as secular Persian officials in the government while the Jewish noblesfunctioned as religious leaders.\"8 Frye recognizes the saknu/segan as \"an important official\" butfinds his role in the Achaemenid economy to be particularly that of a tax collector.'9 In theseritual texts, however, this is certainly not the case.Important titles sometimes deteriorated and became ambiguous with overuse, as the titlespahdtu and satrap show.2 0 Even while the title segan could still refer to an important official, ittoo was sometimes degraded to signify simply \"foreman.\" Aramaic dockets on cuneiform tab-lets of the time of Darius sometimes use the title sgn for those who in the cuneiform texts of9 A.

It is he who is mentioned first among theofficers named in the texts and he who is most frequently mentioned when only one official isnamed.Perhaps it is because of its sensitivity as a royal appointment that the office of segan is moresubject to change than those of the treasurers. It is probable, too, that some of those whobear the title segan are but aides to a superior segan who functions more regularly. As in theBible (Dan. 2:48), where it is reported that Daniel became rb sgnyn, \"the chief of the segan's,\"it is probable that in one instance (No. 2) Mithra-pata is called the sgn' rbI, \"chief segan.\"23A single text (No. 94) which appears to give a geographical designation to the segan mayindicate that they, like the treasurers, could come from outside of Persepolis to function therebeside resident officials.24From the dated texts of Persepolis it is clear that Mithra-pata, \"the chief segan,\" is men-tioned as early as the eighth year of Xerxes (478/77 B.c.) and that he functions, with but fewinterruptions, until the nineteenth year of Xerxes (467/66 B.C.). Ama-data, who is mentionedas segan in the seventh, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of Xerxes (479/78 B.c. and 470-468B.C.) and Arta-data in the eleventh year of that reign (475/74 B.c.) were presumably his sub-ordinates.In the nineteenth year of Xerxes (467/66 B.C.), when a general change of officers occurred,both Mithra-pata and his successor Mithraka appear as segan's.25 Thereafter Mithraka servedconstantly as the principal segan down to the seventh year of Artaxerxes I (458/57 B.C.).Apparently Mithraka's subordinates were Mazza-farnah in the second year of Artaxerxes I(463/62 B.c.), Araya(t)-vahus in the third (462/61 B.c.), Vinda(t)-farnah in the seventh year(458/57 B.c.) and Ari-banu in the tenth (455/54 B.C.). Ama-data, who had served during thereign of Xerxes, reappears in the tenth year of Artaxerxes I (455/54 B.c.), presumably still asubordinate.Another major change in the office of segan is reflected in the eleventh year of Artaxerxes I(454/53 B.c.), when Araya(t)-vahu', who appeared as a subordinate of Mithraka in the thirdyear of Artaxerxes I, became the principal segan and served at least until the twenty-ninthyear of Artaxerxes I (436/35 B.c.). Only Suxra-raoa, called segan in the thirteenth year of Ar-taxerxes I (452/51 B.C.), a year in which Araya(t)-vahus also served in that office (Nos. 43and 44), appears to have been his subordinate.In an undated text (No. 116) Araya(t)-vahus, normally called segan, is designated as \"sub-treasurer.\" If the segan's post is the higher, this would appear to be a demotion after longservice or possibly a temporary return after retirement.\"6Segan's found in undated texts include Vahu-farnah (No. 119), Bhprt (No. 121), who ap-parently was a segan during the reign of Artaxerxes I, and Srby, who served with treasurer21 A. T. Clay, Business Documents of Murashit Sons of Nippur (University of Pennsylvania \"Babylonian Expedition\"X [Philadelphia, 1904]), Nos. 115:7-8, 126:6 and 9; L.

Although the name Mithraka could be an abbreviation for such a name as Mithra-pfta,from the consistent spelling of Mithraka thereafter it is apparent that a new official is intended.26 A similar shift in office possibly may be seen in the case of Mzprn, who is called segan in the second year of ArtaxerxesI (Nos. 21, 118), if he, as Mdzprn, can be the sub-treasurer in the undated text No. 54.

The title, which occurs regularly in the Aramaic ritual texts, is also encounteredat least once in the Aramaic fortification tablets from Persepolis.28In contrast to the segan's, relatively few treasurers are named in the ritual vessels. Only inthe nineteenth year of Xerxes do two treasurers appear as contemporaries.2 9The earliest dated Aramaic text in the ritual vessels (No. 1, the seventh year of Xerxes,479/78 B.c.) names Data-Mithra as treasurer, and he is the only such officer mentioned in thetexts until the nineteenth year of Xerxes (467/66 B.c.) when, apparently in a general changeof officers, Baga-pata is found as treasurer for the first time. It is probably the seal of Data-Mithra that was found impressed on several clay labels dating from the time of Xerxes.3 0Both Data-Mithra and Baga-pata are found as treasurers during the nineteenth year ofXerxes, but thereafter it is only Baga-pata who is named in the dated texts, at least throughthe twenty-ninth year of Artaxerxes I (436/35 B.C.), when the dated texts cease. He is alsomentioned, of course, in many broken, undateable texts. His successor may have been theArta-Zanah of No. 122, the only other person named as treasurer in the ritual texts. Becauseof the incompleteness of the text in which he is mentioned, however, it is impossible to date him.Because there is a quite different group of treasurers named in the Elamite Treasury textsand because only one treasurer is found at a time in the Persepolis Treasury tablets,3' Cameronoriginally denied that the treasurers of the Elamite texts and those of the Aramaic texts onthe ritual vessels could be contemporary and he concluded that the Aramaic texts were laterthan the time of Xerxes.32But with evidence that at least some of the ritual texts were inscribed in the time of Xerxes,3Cameron has shifted his point of view. He now accepts the dating proposed here, but he holdsthat the treasurers were not contemporary at Persepolis, that the sphere of activity of thetreasurers of the ritual vessels is to be sought elsewhere.A supplementary statement attached to the title of the treasurers in some of the texts on thecult vessels might be expected to shed some light on the relationship between the two groupsof treasurers, but it actually makes the problem even more perplexing.Both Data-Mithra and Baga-pata are sometimes clearly designated as \"the treasurer whois in Arachosia.\"34 A single text of the nineteenth year of Xerxes (No. 14) identifies Data-Mithra as \"the treasurer who is in Ghstk.\" While Ghstk might represent a district or town in27 Meillet and Benveniste, Grammaire, pp. 149-50, Sec. 255; W.

The full title is perhaps to be understood always, even when thesimple title \"the treasurer\" is used. Possibly the supplementary text \"who is in Arachosia\" isto be regarded as similar to the full title \"treasurer of Parsa\" found in some of the ElamiteTreasury texts or to the words \"in the fortress\" that occur in two Treasury texts when thetitle of the treasurer is omitted.35The meaning of the words \"who is in Arachosia\" is problematical. Because of them Cameronnow insists that the relatively large number of ritual vessels bearing Aramaic texts all camefrom the East, probably from Arachosia and that the words srk, prkn, and hst that occur atthe beginning of the Aramaic texts are the names of places, fortresses from which the objectswere brought to Persepolis.3 6 That would be an obvious and easy solution to the problem ofthe two sets of treasurers at Persepolis, but it is not without great difficulties that make itsacceptance impossible.There is a remarkable homogeneity about the cult vessels bearing the Aramaic texts thatcalls for explanation. The objects are structurally quite uniform in type, style, and material.The texts have the same formula, each part written in exactly the same sequence. The officialsnamed in the texts form a group so uniform that the names can be used for arriving at an exactdate for the texts and objects. Moreover, it would be rather difficult to explain the presenceof the unusually large number of the highest military officers, chiliarchs and myriarchs, in ap-parently scattered, possibly insignificant and certainly otherwise unknown \"fortresses\" inremote Arachosia. They might rather be expected in Persepolis. Furthermore, it seems highlyimprobable that the numerous stone vessels, some of which at least were quite heavy andbulky, would have gravitated fortuitously from scattered remote places in the East to thesame room in the Persepolis Treasury where they were found as a single collection.Such considerations make it improbable that the place of origin of the ritual objects is to besought far from Persepolis. It is most likely that they were used and presented at Persepolis,which has been called the \"ritual capital\" of the Persian empire.\"If this be so, then the officers mentioned in the Aramaic texts must have functioned atPersepolis and there must have been two groups of treasurers there contemporaneously.Could the occasional use of the words \"of Parsa\" and \"in the fortress\" in the Elamite Treasurytexts and the \"who is in Arachosia\" of the Aramaic texts indicate a deliberate attempt to dis-tinguish between the two separate sets of treasurers who presumably had quite separate func-tions? Unless there were good reasons for doing otherwise, the local officials would be desig-nated simply as \"the treasurer\" as most of them, of both groups, normally were at Persepolis.If, as seems likely, the treasurers of the Aramaic texts functioned at Persepolis, the words\"in Arachosia\" must have had some other significance. If the treasurers were simply visitorsat Persepolis, we might expect the Aramaic to read \"who is from Arachosia.\" But that mighthave been regarded as ambiguous, possibly suggesting Arachosia as a natal place. It wouldcertainly not indicate specifically that their assignment as treasurers was there. Perhaps theadditional \"who is in Arachosia\" is to be understood as meaning \"the treasurer who normallyfunctions in Arachosia.\"But why Arachosia?

Through its fertile, well-watered fields ran the great road linking Persia with India. Arachosia always formed a con-necting link between the pure Indian and the Iranian peoples. In later days the region wasknown as \"White India\" and its people as \"White Indians.'39Tiele has suggested that in all probability the oldest home of the soma/haoma cultus lay be-tween the streams which bore the similar sounding names, Harahuvati/Sarasvatf, southeast ofIran and northwest of India, in the border region between the two related folk.40 Moreover, ifwe may judge from the facts that the Mithra Yasht exhibits an eastern Iranian geographicalhorizon and is written in eastern Iranian language,4' the cult of Mithra, which always hadclose association with the use of haoma, was more prevalent and popular in the East wherethe mixed population could more readily support the cult, without the interference of Zoro-astrian reforms that were more prevalent in the West.Then we might conjecture that the treasurers mentioned in the ritual vessels may have beenbrought to Persepolis seasonally, perhaps during the New Year's Festival, to officiate asexperts or adepts in the rite as celebrated by the army officers. One of the texts (No. 112)indicates that the vessel presented was used \"in a festival.\" It was perhaps not by chance thatthe seal of Data-Mithra depicted an episode in the haoma ceremony.42THE SUB-TREASURERIn the Aramaic ritual texts there is found, for the first time, an official called the 'pgnzbr ,whom Eilers identified as the upa-ganzabara, \"the sub-treasurer.\"4 3 Such an officer apparentlydoes not appear in the Elamite texts from Persepolis.The earliest dateable sub-treasurer in the ritual texts is Mah(a)-data, who is mentioned inthe eighteenth and nineteenth years of Xerxes (468-466 B.c.), at the time of the generalchange of officials. Perhaps the Arzaratayna named in an undateable text (No. 74) as a con-temporary of the treasurer Data-Mithra comes from an even earlier date.In the nineteenth year of Xerxes a sub-treasurer Mazda-data appears beside the earlierMah(a)-data (Nos. 14 and 18), and he continues into the reign of Artaxerxes I, when he isfound with considerable frequency as sub-treasurer from the fourth to the eleventh years(461-453 B.c.), more often than any of the others mentioned. In the sixth and seventh yearsof Artaxerxes I (459-457 B.c.) a person whose name appears to be Mbm is found in the office(Nos. 33 and 38). Mazda-data does not occur in dated texts after the eleventh year of Ar-taxerxes I (454/53 B.c.).In the fifteenth year (450/49 B.C.) Artamaka occurs as a sub-treasurer (No. 47) and Cithra-farnah appears in the twenty-first year (No. 50) and also in still another text (No. 53) whichis probably later than the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I.A sub-treasurer Srwn is mentioned in an undateable text (No. 119) while Baga-pata wastreasurer, and in a single text written while Baga-pata was still treasurer (No. 116) Araya(t)-vahus, who previously appeared frequently as the segan, is designated as the sub-treasurer.44The role of the officials named in the Persepolis ritual objects is somewhat perplexing.

Most conceptions that now prevail are reflections from laterclassical sources or deductions from references made in later Persian literature.Since Magian priests were regarded as indispensable in religious ceremonials of the Achaeme-nid period, one might have expected priestly titles in the Aramaic texts. Ghirshman notesthat \"no sacrifice could be accomplished without the ministrations of the Magi, a fraternity,probably Median in origin, which held certain political and religious privileges. Their func-tions were very important under the Achaemenians. .. .The Magi accompanied the army tocelebrate the sacrifices, they interpreted dreams, and took part in the coronation of the newking. .. .\" 46 The chance occurrence of two Magian witnesses in an Aramaic business documentfrom Egypt fully attests their presence in a military context.4 7The presence of Magians in the Achaemenid community at Persepolis is well attested bothby the Elamite Treasury texts48 and the Aramaic fortification tablets.49 The seal impressionof Dita-Mithra represents the participants in the haoma rite in Magian dress.50If the hypothesis proposed here is acceptable, it would appear from the context of theAramaic ritual texts that despite their titles, which appear to be secular, the officers namedin the Aramaic texts participated in the haoma ceremony, functioning as priests. If the in-scribed ritual objects were those used in the haoma ceremony, as the Data-Mithra seal impres-sion indicates, and if, as seems likely, the military officers named on the vessels used them, ascelebrants, in the haoma rite, then the officials named with them must stand in some peculiarrelationship to the celebrant and the ceremony.It is quite clear from the Aerpatastan that at least in somewhat later times the participationof priests in secular pursuits was legalized in Persia. Many priests bore the otherwise seculartitle \"judge\" (databara)51 and at least one priest was \"king\" (•Jh).52Admittedly it is dangerous to draw parallels from differing cultures, but the Jews of theAchaemenid period were greatly influenced by the language and culture of the Persians. Itmight be doubted that the \"treasurer\" Mithra-data of the time of Cyrus, who returned thesacred vessels to the Jews (Ezra 1:8), was a priest, but it is clear that Nehemiah, who served inthe royal palace at Susa, appointed priests as \"treasurers\" in charge of the cultic supplies inthe Second Temple at Jerusalem (Neh. 13:13),53 and it is probable that the priests who receivedthe temple treasures in the time of Ezra (Ezra 8:33-34) are also to be regarded as \"treasur-ers\" in the same sense. One might suggest that the officers mentioned as \"treasurers\" in theAramaic ritual texts may have been priests bearing \"secular\" titles who received, guarded,and dispensed the cultic vessels and other materials used in the ritual and, as the texts suggest,also assisted in the performance of the rites.5 Schmidt, Persepolis I 172. 46 Ghirshman, Iran, p. 156.\" Kraeling, The Brooklyn Museum Aramaic Papyri, No. 4:24.48 Cameron, PTT, pp. 5-6; cf.

The Talmud indicatesthat in the organization of the Second Temple the segan was the foremost of three priestlyofficers who stood over the \"treasurers\" of the temple and that it was mandatory for one toserve as a segan before becoming the high priest.54A more precise relationship of the officers named in the ritual texts to the haoma ceremonymay be indicated, perhaps, by the prepositions that regularly appear before their names.Normally the preposition used before both the segan and the treasurer is lyd, which may beread as \"at the hand of\" or \"beside.\"55 The sub-treasurer is regularly introduced by the prepo-sition qdm, \"in front of,\" \"before,\" or \"opposite.\"5 6 The prepositions used could thus indicatethe relative positions of the participants during the ceremony. The clue to the arrangement isfound in the description of the ceremony when it involved eight persons as participants and inthe sketch of the positioning of people during the ceremony as sometimes found in theVendidad.57 The participants are therein described both by numbered rank and by titlesdescriptive of their functions.Since the celebrant in the ritual texts used the mortar and pestle, he served as the havandn,who sat at the northwestern corner of the ceremonial arrangement. He was second in rankduring the ceremony. \"Beside him,\" at his left hand, was the zaotar, the most important officerin the ceremony, for he was the priest of first rank, the one who quoted the Haoma Yashtduring the ceremony. He was probably the segan, who is mentioned first and separately in theritual texts. The zaotar sat at the north end of the group facing south. \"Opposite\" the cele-brant, at the northeastern corner of the arrangement, was the priest of fourth rank, the fra-baretar, who handled the sacred twig-bundle (barsom). \"Beside\" the celebrant, at his right,was the fourth officer, whose identity and function are somewhat difficult to describe.5 8 He wasdoubtless the priest who was third in rank, the dtaravaxva, who was in charge of the sacred fire,which was indispensable in religious ceremonies.Thus, the officers mentioned in the ritual texts were probably professional priests, exceptfor the celebrant. Those mentioned in the Aramaic texts seem to have represented the fourtop-ranking priests, constituting the assembly for the haoma rite. Seated in a hollow square,each of the participants represented a side, a point of the compass. Such distribution of per-sonnel seems natural since the haoma ceremony of today is still strongly oriented to the pointsof the compass during the operation of the mortar and in all other essential actions of theceremony.\"4 Sheqaltm 5:2; cf.

Two other vessels, both of which are also unfortunatelydamaged, have texts that indicate that two celebrants were involved with the same vessel(Nos. 88 and 95). In one of them (No. 88) there are traces of two names and the title plg appearstwice. Since haoma is prepared twice in the modern Parsi ceremony,4 apparently reflectingan older ritual, presumably two men participated in turn, using the same equipment, andthen shared the cost of the object presented in the Treasury.Sometimes the name of the celebrant is followed by a single, short, vertical stroke, thenumeral \"one,\" which may be understood as representing an indefinite article.5 It suggeststhe so-called isten wedge used in cuneiform texts, including Old Persian, before masculinenames.6 Since the phenomenon is found only with the celebrant and not with the names ofthe officials on the ritual vessels, it is always the indicator of the name of the celebrant in brokentexts. A similar vertical stroke is used with nouns in these texts, where it may represent an in-definite article.7 Although such a unit stroke was once used in ancient Hebrew listss and in listsin the Aramaic papyri,9 there is no example of it elsewhere in Aramaic after single personalnames.1 Nos. 22, 54, 57, 59-63, 66-68, 116, 126, 128, 131, 133, 134, and probably Nos. 70 and 71.2 Nos. 69, 127, and 129.8 Normal Semitic word order calls for the verb to precede the subject unless there is special stress on the subject.

If, as seems likely, the verb should be translated as \"worked,\"\"operated,\" \"used,\" with the implication that the officer named actually used the mortarand pestle in the haoma ceremony,30 it is rather surprising to find someone who is not a priestperforming this important act.There is, however, some evidence that a military officer could attain the religious statusof a Magian priest, an office originally hereditary in a special caste. In the bilingual Greekand Aramaic inscription from Farasha, Cappadocia, written during the Hellenistic period,it is stated that a \"general\" (Greek strategos, Aramaic probably rb h[yl]) \"became a Magus ofMithra\" or \"began to serve Mithra as a Magian\" (Greek 4dryevae MLiOpq; Aramaic mgy& [lm]trh).3Cumont suggested that the inscription was written on the occasion of an initiation, when anon-Magian could attain such status.32The Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis seem to indicate that already in Achaemenidtimes military men, at least in their own military cult, could assume priestly prerogativesand participate in the haoma ceremony.But it is unlikely that the rite at Persepolis was one of initiation since, although the ma-jority of celebrants seem to have served but once, according to the texts preserved, there isevidence that some celebrants participated in the haoma ceremony on several occasions.Thus, Raman gave one pestle (No. 39) in the tenth year of Artaxerxes I, another (No. 40)in the same year, and a plate (No. 113) in a year that cannot be dated. Karabara pre-sented a pestle (No. 11) in the sixteenth year of Xerxes and another (No. 12) in the follow-ing year.

In both India and Iran from ancienttimes the haoma rites were associated principally with the gods of war.3 8 This persisted, too,in the Mithraism of Roman times, when initiates were under the particular patronage ofMars, the Roman god of war.39 Vermaseren declares, \"It is therefore little wonder that soldiersof all ranks in the Roman legions, orientals included, felt the lure of Mithras. Observanceof the cult guaranteed assistance to all who pledged their lives to the Roman eagle. The as-surance of divine aid on the battlefield, the military discipline and the taking of an oath aspart of that discipline, were very important factors in the spread of the Mithras cult and itsofficial recognition. Material evidence from the second century A.D. shows that wherever theRomans planted the standards, Mithras and his cult followed.\"\"4Ancient Indians plied their gods with soma, not only to promote their immortality, butalso to increase their strength for the struggle against their enemies. Indra, in particular, wasoffered great quantities of soma to fortify him for dealing with the various dragon figuresthat stood in the way of the advancing Aryans.4' Among the Iranians Mithra was treatedsimilarly. As a result the tenth Yasht is replete with references to Mithra's greatness andpower and his readiness to fight. A worshiper declares, \"I will worship Mithra, who is strong,supernatural, foremost, merciful, incomparable, high-dwelling, a mighty, strong warrior. Val-iant, he is equipped with a well-fashioned weapon, he who watches in darkness, the unde-ceivable.\"42The values attributed to haoma for the gods were also sought by men who drank the pre-cious draught. For their continuing personal life men sought healing, vigorous health, nimble-ness, strength throughout the body, prosperity, and wisdom in all things-the very thingsthat the use of haoma had promised from the most ancient times.43 The familiar epithet ap-plied to haoma, \"from whom death flees\" (duraoga),4 attests its power of preserving life andgranting immortality, supreme desires of all men but thoughts ever present to the soldierfor whom battle is always imminent.All men sought the values promised by haoma, but they were perhaps even more meaning-ful to the military man. Some expectations associated with the use of haoma, as declared inPersian scripture, seem to be more distinctly military in character. Thus, there are pleas tohaoma for strength and ability to defend and a petition for \"some of the victorious qualitiesby which Haoma is conqueror of those who attack.\"45 Constantly there is urging for strength14 An apparent exception is Haoma-data's presentation of a mortar and pestle (Nos. 14 and 15) in the 19th year ofXerxes. However, these objects could have been given at the same time, as a set, as were several others that mention\"mortar with pestle\" (e.g., Nos. 1, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 46, 103, etc.).

Theverb is certainly transitive, with the various stone objects on which it is written as itsdirect object. As will be contended below, the sphere of action is probably somewhere withinthe fortress of Persepolis or nearby.'A normal translation of the verb 9bd in Aramaic should be \"he made\" or \"he did.\" But inview of the relatively large number of persons who appear as subjects of the verb and be-cause more than a dozen of them are identified as very high military officers who would notbe expected to show the artistic talent and skilled craftsmanship necessary to shape theobjects,2 it is quite unlikely that such a translation is possible in these texts.It has been proposed that the meaning should be \"he had (someone) make.\" But the con-sonantal text does not permit the reading of a causative form of the verb ('AfEel or Hafeel)nor can 4bd be a Pacel form used in a causative sense, for such a form of the verb is relativelyrare in Aramaic and, as Syriac shows, when it does occur, the meaning is not \"to make some-one make (something)\" but \"to make someone serve.\"3One might better appeal, if such a sense is desired, to the frequent use of the verbs \"made,\"\"built,\" and the like, in Semitic inscriptions which declare that a king had \"made\" a tombor \"built\" a palace or even a city (for example, Moabite Stone, 11. 9-10, 18-19, 21-23, 25-26,29) when he obviously did not do the work himself. Even more pertinent here would be KingKilamu's assertion that he \"made\" (qn klmw) the decorative golden shell or overlay for thehandle of his \"scepter\" (or \"whip\"?).4But such royal claims are quite understandable and of a different order from the use ofthe verb in these ritual texts. Moreover, it can scarcely be said that the objects were \"made\"in the prkn or srk, as the words are understood here. Nor would such an interpretation besuitable in the few instances wherein the action is said to have occurred \"during a festival\"(No. 112:5) or \"during an important prk (great ceremony of crushing haoma?)\" (No. 5:3).Moreover, such a translation does not construe well with the several prepositions that occurbefore the names of the officials mentioned in the texts. Furthermore, it would appear thatthe vessels presented in the Treasury were not always newly made for the celebrants sinceseveral of them show signs of having been broken and mended in antiquity.5Because of the considerable number of ritual objects found in the Treasury, it is naturalto assume that they were presented at the Treasury and that their Aramaic texts refer totheir delivery at Persepolis. Such was the original premise of this writer and it is still thecontention of Professor Came'ron, who has translated the basic Aramaic text tentatively asfollows:1 See pp. 20-22. 2 See pp. 34-35.3 J. Payne Smith, A Compendious Syriac Dictionary (Oxford, 1957), p. 396.

To Y thetreasurer, in the presence of Z the assistant treasurer (it is) a gift. Year. .. .6In his translation of the Aramaic cbd ... lyd as \"into the hand of . .. X made,\" Cameronwas doubtless influenced by a Persian idiom. In the Behistun Inscription of Darius I the kingclaims, \"Afterwards Ahuramazda made them into my hand\" (pasdva dig auramazda manddastaya akunauX).7But there are a number of reasons why Cameron's reading is unacceptable and these haveled the writer to seek another meaning for the verb cbd and consequently another interpreta-tion for the texts. The word that he translates as \"a gift\" ('Skr) cannot have that meaning inthese texts.8 Without it in such a sense an awkward construction results-two widely sepa-rated prepositional phrases (lyd) dependent upon the same verb-a construction unlike thePersian idiom. It seems improbable that the presentation of the ritual objects was \"madeto the hand of the segan\" and also \"to the hand of the treasurer.\" Moreover, although thewords cbd .. .lyd, literally \"he made to the hand of,\" superficially resemble the Persian idiom\"made into the hand of,\" it is not an exact rendition of the idiom. One should expect anAramaic byd to render the dative case of the Persian noun \"in the hand.\"9The words \"made to the hand of\" are used nowhere else in Aramaic-not even in theAramaic of Persepolis-as a circumlocution to express the idea \"he gave.\" It is an awkward,distinctly non-Semitic expression that would be avoided in Aramaic, which has a good, shortSemitic verb for \"he gave.\" That verb is used elsewhere in the Aramaic fortification textsfrom Persepolis.If the Persian idiom were used in the Aramaic texts for \"he gave,\" the prepositional phraselyd (or, preferably, byd) \"to the hand\" would be indispensable. But there are some texts inthe cult vessels in which the verb cbd, \"he made(?),\" is used without the prepositional lydand even without a reference to an official.10 In a single, much abbreviated text (No. 127),only the verb cbd and a personal name are found. Obviously cbd alone cannot mean \"he gave.\"\"While it is probably true that the ritual objects were presented in the Treasury at Persepoliswhere they were found, that is but an inference drawn from the fact that they were foundthere, presumably where they had been stored, rather than from any explicit statement ofdonation in the Aramaic texts. Both the verb cbd and the words lyd and qdm, which introducethe officials, must have some less usual meaning in the Aramaic texts.Clarity is achieved only when the verb cbd is rendered as \"worked,\" \"operated,\" or \"used.\"That the Semitic verb can have such meaning is seen from such Hebrew texts as \"there wasnot a man to work the ground\"'2 and \"you should work the ground for him.\"' 3 In post-BiblicalHebrew cbd can be employed in the sense of \"to use (something, especially for idolatrous pur-poses).\"\" A possible Aramaic use of the verb cbd in the sense of \"use\" is found in the Peshittatext of Ezra 7:23, which can be read as \"And everything in the tablet shall be given. And giveto Him according to the law of the God of Heaven. He shall take (nissab) and he shall use(wenecbed) and there shall not be anger against the kingdom of the king and his sons.\" TheAkkadian verb epeJu, \"to make,\" has had a similar development and was used similarly for\"to use.\"156 Cameron, in Schmidt, Persepolis II p. 55b.7 Behistun Inscription, col. iv, 1. 35. 8 See p. 54.'

Similarly constructed is such a form as nrmr,which is regarded by Nyberg as an Aramaic perfect verb form (z'ban) to which a letter -t isadded as a \"phonetic complement\" to indicate the Iranian equivalent in the preterite tense,which ends with the phoneme -t (xrit).24In Middle Persian the form zbnw is likewise explained as an Aramaic logogram to whichan additional letter -w has been attached. While there is general agreement among Iranolo-gists about the origin and significance of the final -t in such a word as zbnt and about its func-tion as indicating the Iranian preterite tense, there are diverse views concerning the originand significance of the -w in such forms as zbnw.25Nyberg, who transcribed such a -w as -u, suggested that zbnw is the second person pluralimperative Aramaic form, the \"most common verbal form\" used in the chancery of the GreatKing, that has been adopted for Iranian use.26 He explains that in the development of Middle16 See p. 32.17 Here this word represents either the words \"ritual\" (srk), \"ceremony of crushing (haoma)\" (prkn), or the stilluntranslated hst.18 Mortar, pestle, or plate.19 Nos. 2:3, 13:2, 14:2, 15:3, and 20:3.

Diakonoff regards the troublesome -was a non-phonemic, differentiating sign used to distinguish between the participial forms andthe finite verb. The simpler form (cbd) he identifies as the participle and the affixed form(cbdw), when used as a singular verb, he considers to be the finite verb.33Although the surprising occurrence of the form cbdw in these Achaemenid ritual texts mayresemble heterographic writing and thus suggest that the texts in which it is found should beread as Persian rather than Aramaic, that seems quite unlikely. The time that elapsed be-tween the ritual texts and those of the Middle Persian in which such heterographic forms areencountered is quite considerable, a matter of several centuries. On the basis of Persian ma-terial hitherto known, Henning has determined that it is certain that the Aramaic languagewas displaced by Iranian language using Aramaic logograms in its written expression aboutthe middle of the second century B.C.34 and that the earliest known example of such hetero-graphic writing is found in a series of coins which began at about the end of the second cen-tury B.C.35 Furthermore, there are no other examples of heterographic writing in the ritualtexts of the Achaemenid period which are read otherwise quite readily as good Aramaic.3\"As a homograph, the verbal form cbd could represent either the Pecal or Pacel perfect formsin Aramaic or the Pecal masculine singular participle.372 Ibid.28 The Arsacid ending was -w and it was -wn in Sassanian times.

It is observable in such a hybrid combination as Ipty (Nos. 43:4, 114:3) and in the reflection of Persian thought andsyntax (see pp. 63-70), but aside from the strange cbdw there is nothing in the texts that resembles the logographic writingfound in Pahlavi texts.37 If defective writing is possible, cbd might also represent the P\"cil (passive) perfect and participle in the masculinesingular form. Then cbdw would be identical with the form cbydw that Altheim (Altheim and Stiehl, Aramdische Sprache I42-43) finds in line 4 of the Armazi text.But in Biblical Aramaic and the papyri PUcil forms are always written with the letter y to represent the i vowel (cbyd).However, Nyberg (in Le monde oriental XVII 222) suggests that there was an archaic Aramaic dialect in Iranian territorywherein the use of matres lectionis must have been scarce, since the bulk of Aramaic ideograms are later taken over fromArsacid Pahlavi, which was founded on such an archaic Aramaic dialect.THE ACTION41oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLISAltheim and Stiehl attempt to explain such forms as cbdw as good Aramaic, a participlewith an auxiliary finite verb. They consider the cbydw of the Armazi text to be a passive(Pecil) participle with an enclitic auxiliary verb hawd, \"he was,\" and they compare it to theMiddle Persian kart stet.38The use of the participle with an auxiliary verb is already found in Biblical Aramaic, wherethe perfect form of the verb \"he was\" usually precedes the participle and only rarely followsit, as in 'ate hawd (Dan. 7:13). In such a construction the verb indicates a continuation of ac-tion in the past.3 9Such usage is even more common later, in Syriac, where the auxiliary verb occasionally isplaced before the participle but usually after it and, unlike Biblical Aramaic, it is writtenadjoined, with the initial letter h of the enclitic hawd written but unpronounced, making theform cdbed(h)wd. In Syriac such a combination expresses continuance or repetition in pasttime. The form I ,-L is almost equivalent to the Latin \"faciebat.\"40In Syriac the use of an auxiliary verb in the perfect may be added to the perfect tense ofthe finite verb as well as to the participle. Then the past tense is brought into greater promi-nence and the construction of the perfect finite verb with an auxiliary perfect may often betranslated as a pluperfect.4' Such usage is still reflected in the neo-Aramaic dialect of Azer-baijan in which past time is indicated by \"the unstressed past indicator -wd\" affixed to theforms of the \"Aorist.\"4 2In such constructions it is possible that there may be some relationship in syntax betweenAramaic and Old Persian, wherein the copula aha, \"was,\" appears virtually as an auxiliaryverb.43 Kent explains,4 \"The perfect tense is virtually lacking in Old Persian.... The mean-ing which in English is normally expressed by the perfect tense seems to be present in all in-stances where the participle is accompanied by the present copula. . . . Where the copula aha'was' is expressed, the meaning seems to be that of the pluperfect: pardbartam aha 'had beentaken away';45 kartam aha 'had been made.' \"46As the Persepolis ritual texts show by the identical placement of the verbs Cbd and cbdw inthe formula, the terms must be equivalent. If the interpretation proposed here is correct,both words must refer to past time. The action described in the ritual vessels was certainlycompleted, once and for all, with that particular vessel before it was inscribed. Each ceremonyseems to have been regarded as a unit and not as an event in a continuing or repeated sequenceof acts. This appears to be indicated by the fact that although some celebrants participatedmore than once in the ceremony, different objects were dedicated on the various dates.4 7 Onthe basis of preserved texts it must be assumed that the majority of the celebrants partici-pated but once.38 Altheim and Stiehl, Aramdische Sprache I 42-43, 274, cbd; also, Supplementum aramaicum; Aramiisches aus Iran(Baden-Baden, 1957), pp. 84-85.

Only a single severelyabbreviated text on a pestle head (No. 127) lacks the name of the object. The wordhwn identifies the mortar, 'bJwn the pestle, and shr the plate. The Aramaic name for thetray unfortunately is not preserved on the only specimen that bears an Aramaic text.The ritual objects are made of a hard, flinty green stone that is usually more or less patternedwith lighter and darker grayish-green bands, veins, or lines.2 Petrological examination indi-cates that the stone is an impure chert which owes its green color to such impurities as clayand probably glauconite.3 Herzfeld claimed, \"There are plenty of stone vessels in Persepolis,mostly of green stone which protects against poison, patizahr > bezoar,\"'4 but he does notspecify which of the several types he means. Schmidt associated the word patizahr (> pdzahr)with the mottled black and green serpentine stone used for the royal tableware. But since allof the ritual vessels are made of the same green chert, one wonders whether it was believedto have some peculiar, perhaps apotropaic, value that made it suitable for religious purposesand apparently for nothing else.5Frequently in the Aramaic texts the objects are described as being zy gll, \"of gll.\" The wordgllis identical with the galdlu or aban galdla of Akkadian6 and the equivalent :\"ben gl^dl of Bibli-cal Aramaic (Ezra 5:8, 6:4). The use of the logogram aban, \"stone,\" in Akkadian suggeststhat galdla was originally either a distinct kind of stone or one that had been treated in somespecial way. According to Herzfeld, the word indicated the manner by which the vessels weremade, by \"turning.\"7 But the designation is used elsewhere for architectural elements whichcertainly were not \"turned.\" Landsberger rejected Herzfeld's interpretation and agreed withScheil8 that galdla represented a property of the stone, perhaps \"hard.\"9 Since the Semiticroot gll can mean \"to move in a circle,\" the word originally might have referred to the naturalcircular movement of the arm in polishing, leading to the concept of \"polished stone.\" Atleast the inscribed surfaces of many of the ritual vessels were polished before the texts werewritten. But whatever the original significance of galala, by the Achaemenid period the wordwith or without the logogram for stone had come to mean simply \"stone.\"10 In bilingual textsthe Old Persian equivalent for galdla is simply a0a\"gaina, \"of stone.\"11 See Schmidt, Persepolis II 53-56.

C. Thompson, apparently on the basis of a rendering by Scheil rather than of anymore specific evidence, has identified galala as \"marble.\"\"'MORTARIt is assumed that the green stone vessels recovered from the Persepolis Treasury are culticbecause just such a mortar and pestle is portrayed beside a fire altar in a religious theme de-picted on cylinder seal impressions from the time of Xerxes.1\" That seal motif appears tocapture the moment during the haoma ceremony just before the haoma liquid was consumed.The content of the Aramaic texts, as conjectured here, supports the assumption that the ves-sels found had been used in the haoma ceremony before being presented in the PersepolisTreasury.A surprising number of mortars was found in the Treasury. Of 97 recovered, 79 bore Aramaictexts. In the Aramaic texts the mortar is identified as the hwn, havana. The word, like haoma,the name of the sacred drink, is derived from a root meaning \"to press.\"\" The noun, mean-ing \"the presser,\" \"(wine) press,\"'8 is used in a dual form to designate the two essential partsused for the crushing operation.According to Bartholomae, the word havana describes both the mortar and pestle. Unlessa careless error is involved, that is supported by a single text on a pestle (No. 24:4) whichdescribes the object on which it is written as \"this havana.\" Such usage would be appropriatewhen, in the earliest days, the mortar and \"pestle\" consisted of a pair of stones. In theirpressing of soma (= haoma) the Brahmans in India \"beat the stalks of the plant, which areplaced on a large flat stone [upara], with a smaller stone [gr&van] till they formed a singlemass.\"'9 On the basis of Yasht 10:2, Herzfeld contended that the Persians, too, used such apress, made of a \"principal\" (frataram) and an \"upper\" (uparam) havana.20 Such usage doubt-12 Ibid., p. 165b, axsaina; BAiW, col. 51, Avestan a-xkaEna, \"dunkelfarbig.\" Cf.

Not only does each object usually bear its distinctive name, but anumber of texts describe the set as \"this mortar with a pestle\" or \"this pestle with a mortar.\"\"Since the mortar and pestle was regarded as a unit, it is apparent that the donor usually hadbut one object inscribed.22 That would account for the relatively large number of uninscribedobjects of the same shapes and material.According to ancient texts, the mortar could be made either of stone (asmana hdvana)23 orof iron (ayanghahena hdvana).24 Most of the mortars found at Persepolis were of green chertbut an uninscribed one of creamy-white and orange limestone (PT5 911) was also found inthe great Hall 38 of the Treasury, where most of the ritual objects were recovered. Even moreinteresting are the uninscribed mortar (PT6 195) and pestle (PT6 123) of bronze which areidentical in shape with those of green chert.25 Pavry explains that formerly two mortars wereused at the same time in the haoma ceremony, a stone one for pounding haoma and an ironone for producing a ringing sound.26 The Parsis today use mortars and pestles of bell metal(brass or copper) because the sonorous ringing of the mortar with the pestle is a conspicuouspart of the haoma-crushing ceremony.\"Mortars now used by the Parsis are described as \"generally shaped like a wine glass witha foot and stem, but much larger.\"28 On the basis of one complete example29 and a numberof fragments, the excavator says of the mortars found at Persepolis, \"The mortars as wellas the pestles of green chert have stereotyped shapes. Almost all mortars have a roughlyhemispherical top with squared rim. However, in a few cases the top part is oblong, with al-most straight sides. The conoid base has squared edges, beveled in some instances with an in-ward slant. The bottom is frequently more or less convex. As the mortar would have greaterstability if its bottom were flat, the purpose of the convexity may have been to facilitaterocking or revolving.\"30Inscribed mortars, some of which were for cultic use (Akkadian madaqqum, madakum,mazuktum), are already known from Iraq.\" But none are like the ritual objects from Persepolis,which bear more extensive and significant texts, written in ink and in the Aramaic alphabetand language. The inscribed mortars have their texts written across the bottom surfaces oftheir bases, some of which were polished before the texts were written.From the Aramaic texts we learn that three sizes of mortars were recognized, although notall examples are so designated. Semitic words are used to designate the \"large\" (rb)32 and\"small\" (zcyr)33 sizes but, lacking a precise Semitic word for \"medium-sized,\" the Iranian mdm(Avestan ma'dma)34 is used for mortars in that category.35Because the vessels are fragmentary, it is impossible to make an over-all comparison for21 See Nos. 1:3, 46:4, 103:3, and also in Nos. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 79.22 Nos. 14 and 15 indicate that at times both objects could be inscribed.3 Vendidd 14:10. 24 Yasna 22:2; Visparad 10:2.2 6 Schmidt, Persepolis II, P1. 80: 7a, b.

But the largest by measurement (No. 5) has a base diameter of18.9 cm.40A single mortar text (No. 8) furnishes the rather unnecessary information that it was used\"for pounding\" (lhsl).

The Achae-menian Aramaic word used for the object is 'bSwn.Altheim and Stiehl transcribe the word as 'bhwn and propose an etymology *abi-sa-van,\"rings, sehr scharfend, sehr spitzend,\" relating it to Old Indic iSdati, \"he sharpened,\" modernPersian szdan and Avestan saenay, \"sharp,\" \"point,\" \"top.\"43 More likely is the suggestionof Eilers, who sees in it the prefix 'b (abi-), \"against,\"44 and a form of the verb su, \"pressout,\"45 with the s properly becoming s after the preceding i-class vowel.4 6 Eilers suggests thatthe use of the sibilant s instead of h indicates a borrowing of the word from the East. The con-cluding -n Eilers sees as an affix encountered elsewhere in the names of implements (for ex-ample, safkon, \"strainer\"). Thus, the word 'bgwn means \"an instrument pressed againstsomething\" or \"an instrument used for pressing out something.\"4736 Checking measurements shows that the figures for \"diameters\" in the excavator's Field Register are the measurementof the base, usually reconstructed from a fragment and that the figures are accurate and trustworthy.7 BAiW, col. 1786.38 Other small mortars are Nos. 34 and 105 (7.1 cm.); 46 and 116 (7.2 cm.); 32 (7.3 cm.); 121 and 125 (7.5 cm.); 83 and143 (7.6 cm., also No. 38); 160 (7.7 cm., also No. 108); 8 and 30 (7.8 cm.); 130 (7.9 cm.); 1, 84, 99, 138 (8 cm., also No. 31);146 (9.7 cm.); and possibly No. 74 (ca. 10 cm.).39 Other medium-sized mortars are Nos. 139 (11.2 cm., also No. 80); 96 (11.4 cm.); 159 (11.5 cm.); 79 (11.6 cm.); 162(11.9 cm.); 9, 25, 101,103, 135, 145 (12 cm.); 13 and 144 (12.2 cm.); 93 (12.5 cm., also No. 97); 76 and 82 (13 cm.); and 106(13.1 cm., also No. 124).40 Large mortars include Nos. 149 (15.8 cm.); 86 (16 cm.); 94 and 122 (16.5 cm.); 91 (16.7 cm., also No. 14); 36 (17.7 cm.);and 75, 85, 89, 90, 136 (18 cm., also No. 16).41 Haug, Parsis, p. 396.42 Modi, Religious Ceremonies, p. 259; F.

The shaft expands toward the round grindingend. Two pestles in our collection consist only of a shaft with two wrought ends.50 It may bethat the heads of these specimens were accidentally broken and that the fractured ends werecarefully reground.\"5 1Most of the pestles found are badly broken. Only two may be regarded as complete. A smallone (PT5 8), which belongs with mortar No. 33, is now illegible and may not have beeninscribed.52 The larger one (No. 54), which perhaps would be classified as \"medium-large,\" isonly slightly damaged on the edges of its head.Noteworthy is the uninscribed bronze pestle (PT6 123) that was found with the bronze mor-tar (PT6 195) to which it belongs. It is shaped exactly like the ritual pestles of green chert.Because mortars and pestles formed sets to be used together,5 3 it should be expected thatpestles, like mortars, would come in three sizes, and they do. Here, too, some are called \"large\"(rb),54 others \"medium-sized\" (mdm),55 and \"small\" (zcyr).56The smaller pestle called \"small\" (No. 123) has a head diameter of 3 cm., but there areeven smaller ones (Nos. 60 and 131 of 2.7 cm. diameter and No. 78 of 2.9 cm. diameter). Thelarger pestle called \"small\" (No. 87) has a head diameter of 3.3 cm., exactly the size of another(No. 57) which is called \"medium.\"57 Others called \"medium\" measure 3.4 cm. (No. 2),3.5 cm. (No. 17), 3.6 cm. (No. 100), and 3.7 cm. (No. 21). The largest called \"medium\" has ahead diameter of 4.3 cm.58 Since the smallest pestle designated as \"large\" (No. 10) measures5.8 cm., it is difficult to determine whether those that measure 5 cm. or over59 should beregarded as medium-sized or large. The largest pestle so designated (No. 64) measures 6.5 cm.,almost the diameter of the base of a small mortar. Another (No. 39) called \"large\" has a headdiameter of 6 cm.6 0Of the 80 green chert pestles found, 68 were inscribed with an Aramaic text written in ink.The normal place for the text is on the discoid top of the pestle, but the small space sometimesimposed severe restrictions in the formulae. In order to gain more writing space, scribes wrotetexts lengthwise along the shaft of a few pestles (Nos. 17, 81, and 124).Just as the texts of mortars occasionally refer to their pestles, a few pestle texts mention48 Nos. 9, 13, 14, and 17.49 Faycal andfaycdl forms are found in Arabic in such words as hayYar, \"rambling,\" or hayqdr, \"tearing\"; cf.

Altheim read the word as shr and equated it with the shr of Hebrew(Cant. 7:3; English vers. 7:2), the 'aggan hassahar.66 Because Semitic h or h may sometimesbe represented by Aramaic h in the Aramaic of Persepolis but Semitic h seems never to be ren-dered by the letter h there,\"7 Altheim's etymology seems suspect. The explanation of shr isstill uncertain.On the basis of many fragments of plates recovered in the Persepolis Treasury the excavatorreports, \"Three of the eighty-five plates have a rounded, laterally projecting lip. Where pre-served, the lips of all others are squared. On one plate a groove encircles the exterior just be-low the rim. Otherwise, there are only minor variations in size, thickness, and depth. Thebases of all plates project somewhat and form a flat disk, at times slightly convex at the bot-tom . . .Except for their usually thinner walls, many serpentine plates which we classify asroyal tableware are identical in shape with the green chert plates with squared lips.\"68 Abeautiful, complete specimen of such a plate was found by the Archaeological Institute of Per-sepolis in 1949.\"6Professor Schmidt recognized \"minor variations\" in the size of the plates. As with the mor-tars, the diameters of the plates, when they can be determined, can furnish some basis for in-dicating relative size.70 Unlike the mortars and pestles, only the \"large\" (rb) plates are sodesignated in the Aramaic texts.716o Nos. 10 and 17. 63 See pp. 54-55.52 BAiW, col. 1786. 64 Schmidt, Persepolis II 89b.66 The word tasta, used as early as the Vendidad for the plates of the haoma ceremony (Vendidad 19:8), is cognate withthe French and German \"tasse\" and English \"dish.\"66 Altheim and Stiehl, Aramdische Sprache I 19.

Theusual formula in the plates is 9bd shr znh, \"used this plate.\"In addition to the usual formula of the Aramaic text several plates have some modifyingwords not encountered elsewhere. Because the words are often badly preserved and the writ-ing of many of the letters at times is ambiguous, little can be learned from some of such addi-tions that occur only once.72An expression found on two plates is rcyn bg,73 which appears to be a mixture of Aramaicand Iranian words. As the letter Caiyn was used in Persian only in Aramaic logograms, thefirst word must be Semitic. It appears to be the Aramaic racydn, which appears in BiblicalAramaic and later Jewish Aramaic, as well as in late Hebrew, in the form ray6n.7 4 Its Semiticroot, rcy (Arabic Si)), signifies \"to take pleasure in (something)\" or \"to desire.\"'7 From Bibli-cal contexts in which it is found it is clear that the word involves \"striving\" or \"longing\" (inEcclesiastes) and \"desire\" (in Daniel), as well as \"ambition\" and \"greed\" in later Aramaic.7\"The word bg, however, is doubtless the Persian baga, which usually means \"god\" but canalso mean \"portion,\" \"lot,\" \"fortunate lot,\" \"good fortune,\" and \"luck.\"\"77One would expect rcyn bg, which appears only on plates, to refer to the object and furnishsome description of the vessel, but that appears not to be the case. It seems to be a paren-thetic comment relating to the verb. As \"the desire of god,\" it might indicate that the cere-mony was performed to please the god. More probable, however, is the translation \"a desirefor good fortune,\" which would indicate that the purpose of the generals in participating inthe haoma rite was to gain personal good fortune, military victory, immortality, health, andprosperity.A few plates that are unfortunately very badly preserved have a textual insertion includinga numeral after the description of the vessel.78 The difficult passage was clarified with thediscovery of a complete text which shows that the numeral indicates the value of the vesselbeing presented.79 One such plate and a mortar were worth eight shekel coins and one \"large\"plate cost nine.In any set of haoma vessels one would expect to find the cup from which the liquid wasdrunk. One would expect this vessel, above all others, to be the dedicated memorial of the oc-casion of participation in the haoma ceremony. At the present time the Parsis use a round-bottomed cup the size of a teacup in the ceremony,80 but no such vessels were found at Persepolis,either among the ritual vessels or among the royal tableware. It is clear that cups wereindeed known in ancient Iran,8 1 but there are none of the green chert used for the ritual ves-sels. Perhaps the solution lies in the fact that in the Achaemenid period bowls were used fordrinking purposes. This is suggested by the motif on a cylinder seal of the period which de-picts a meal in which the eater is about to drink from a bowl.82 While it may be that at least7 E.g., see No. 48:5. 73 Nos. 47 and 52.74 Dan. 2:29-30, 4:16, 5:6 and 10; Eccles. 1:17, 2:22, 4:16.75 Professor J.

One of the pieces with straight sides is the corner of an angulartray.84Of seven trays recovered, only one (No. 142), a smooth, oblong vessel of green chert withgrey veins, shows evidence of having been inscribed.8 5 Only three letters, the beginnings oftwo incomplete words, remain of the Aramaic text that had been written on the flat bottomof the tray. The traces are too incomplete to preserve even the name of the object, as a clueto its use in the haoma ceremony.No \"tray\" is listed among the paraphernalia now used by the Parsis in their haoma cere-mony. It seems probable, however, that the \"trays\" functioned in ancient times as the slabs,later known as hwdn's, \"tables,\" in the modern ceremony.86 Six such stone slabs or hwan's,cut of stone or marble, are used in the Parsi ceremonial room today. One such stone platform(takht-i-dlat) now holds the cups and saucers, the barsom stand, and other apparatus necessaryfor the ceremony.Only one of the slabs of the modern ceremony, however, has rounded ends to resemble theshape of the inscribed tray from Persepolis. That one, a slab about fifteen inches long, is nowcalled the kundi nJ hwan, the \"table\" for the kundi, the large vessel containing the rituallypure water in which the smaller implements, including the pestle, were kept when not in use.87It seems quite probable that the oblong-oval inscribed green chert \"tray\" at Persepolis is anearlier form of the \"slab\" for the kundi-vessel, just as the stone mortars and pestles antedatedthe bell metal ones now in use.The kundi itself may be represented at Persepolis by the apparently uninscribed green chertbowl with lion legs, which has usually been included in the category of royal tableware, butwhich Schmidt suspected of being for ritual use.88 This seems likely because all of the in-scribed ritual vessels are of the same green chert stone. It would appear that such stone wasreserved for ritual vessels and therefore that all objects of that stone served a ritual purpose.The green chert tripod vessel would thus have stood on the oblong-oval green chert tray.Since most of the green chert ritual objects are identified by the demonstrative pronounznh, \"this,\" it seems probable that the objects inscribed are the very ones that were used by83 Vendidad 14:8; Modi, Religious Ceremonies, p. 260.84 Schmidt, Persepolis II 53b-55a, P1. 24:4 and 6, PL. 64:1, 3, and 5. 86 Ibid., P1. 24:4.8e Modi (Religious Ceremonies, pp. 254 ff.) calls the object a \"stone slab,\" which might well characterize a tray, but thevessel is now called by the Arabic name hwdn ( l)^), \"table,\" \"tray,\" because it now stands on four feet, like a table; cf.Steingass, A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, p. 480b.87 Modi, Religious Ceremonies, pp. 254, 258.s Schmidt, Persepolis II 55a, 89a, Pls. 55:3, 56:1.THE UTENSILS51oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLISthe celebrant in the haoma ceremony. There are, however, a number of texts in which thedemonstrative pronoun is not used.\"9 Indeed, some texts have the unit stroke, which shouldbe rendered as an indefinite pronoun rather than a demonstrative. A single text which men-tions both a mortar and pestle (No. 14), written on a mortar, describes the mortar with thedemonstrative \"this\" but uses the unit stroke \"one\" or \"a\" for the pestle.Such texts might suggest that the vessels so inscribed were not the identical ones used inthe ceremonial. Perhaps this should not be overstressed, however, since it would be mostlikely that the celebrants would have preferred to present the very ones they used, appro-priately inscribed.Since all of the vessels were not preserved intact as a collection, but were shattered and scat-tered, it cannot be decided whether each celebrant presented a complete set of the objectsused. The relative scarcity of trays suggests that they were not normally regarded as part ofa \"set\" and the tripod vessels are even more rare. The fact that many of the cultic vesselswere not inscribed suggests that Aramaic texts, in some cases at least, may have been writtenon only one piece of a set. This seems particularly clear with the mortars and pestles, for theywere regarded as a unit and either part could be called havana, \"mortar.\"90 It is possible thatthe pestle was an indispensable part of the mortar, for in a few instances the mortar and pestleare both mentioned on the same object.91It is probable that the mortar and pestle was the usual dedication and that the mortar andpestle presented by Haoma-data in a single year (Nos. 14 and 15) represent such a presenta-tion. Others show their intention to present a complete set, even though time elapsed betweenthe presentations. Thus Raman presented two pestles, and a plate (Nos. 39, 40, and 113) indifferent years, probably indicating participation in the haoma ceremony several times. Swrty,too, gave three pieces, although the loss of dates prevents a decision as to whether they wereall presented at the same time.It may be that less than a set, even a single piece, was given as a token of the event. Thus,Bhyyn dedicated two plates (Nos. 48 and 112); 1dwst and Raman two pestles and a platein different years (Nos. 3, 52, and 133; Nos. 39, 40, and 113); Krpys two mortars and a plate(Nos. 25, 102, and 103); Krbr, two pestles in different years (Nos. 11 and 12); and Kali, amortar and a plate (Nos. 94 and 95).Other celebrants seem to have presented only a single inscribed object each. As in the caseof some mentioned above, there may have been an intention to complete a set over a period ofyears. Sometimes there was a considerable interval between the dedications. Forty yearselapsed, for example, between the presentation of a pestle (No. 3) by 'dwst in the tenth yearof Xerxes and a plate (No. 52) in the twenty-ninth year of Artaxerxes I.89 E.g., Nos. 4, 11, 12, 17, 22, 29, 87, 116, 131.90 See pp. 45-46. 1N Nos. 1, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 46, 79, and 103.52oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"IX'SkrJUST before the date in the standard Aramaic text on the ritual vessels from Persepolis is asingle, somewhat enigmatic word S'kr. Except for a few pestles with extremely abbrevi-ated formulae,' the word 'kr, or some evidence of its presence, is found in the text of everyinscribed mortar, pestle, or plate on which the end of the Aramaic text is still preserved.The word might be either Semitic or Persian in origin. J. Duchesne-Guillemin has suggestedthat it might be the Persian afkar, meaning \"clear,\" \"open,\" \"public,\" \"evident,\" \"mani-fest.\"2 Such a meaning would be appropriate if the Aramaic texts recorded the presentationof the ritual vessels at Persepolis in a public ceremony, but the simple solution is not persua-sive. Furthermore, as will be shown below, the word appears in these texts as a modifier ofthe word \"pestle.\"If the word is Iranian, the letters -kr at the end of the word might represent the Persianelement -kara, which is found in two senses in combination. It can be a verbal noun express-ing \"agent,\" \"maker,\" as in hamarakara, \"accountant,\" or it can be used in a passive sense,\"a thing made,\" as in patikara, \"image,\" \"reproduction.\"3The initial element '- might then be a substantive expressing the nature of the maker orof what is made. Gathic and Late Avestan asa signifies \"law,\" \"justice,\"4 but in some con-texts it appears to have a more dynamic quality of cosmic power affecting the strength oflife and healing damage caused by evil powers. Nyberg claims that in a certain sense theterm comes close to the concept \"health.\"' The term asa occurs in the Haoma Yasht (Yasna10:8), where haoma, the beneficial drink, is contrasted with all others. As \"health-producing\"the term 'kr would seem to be an appropriate epithet for haoma. But etymologically theword aSa is related to the Sanskrit ytd, \"cosmic order,\" which should be spelled arta in OldPersian, where it is found as an element in many personal names.In Late Avestan a word asa, when used as an adjective referring to grain, signifies \"crushed.\"6This meaning, too, would be suitable as a modifier of \"pestle\" and \"maker of somethingcrushed\" would be an appropriate title for the havandn, who crushed the haoma, and \"(some-thing) crushed\" would certainly characterize the haoma liquid itself.

The word occurs often enough to certify its spelling as 'skr.Cameron, regarding the ritual texts as being simply a statement of the presentation of theobjects in the Treasury in the presence of officials, translated 'kr as \"a gift\" on the basis ofthe 'ekar found in the Bible (Ezek. 27:15; Ps. 72:10).10 But the Biblical 'eSkar is doubtlessa borrowing of the Akkadian iSkaru,\" which probably ultimately derives from Sumerian.Among the several meanings of Akkadian ilkaru are \"assigned work\" and, only in the Neo-Assyrian period, \"(a kind of) tax.\"12 In the Biblical passages in which the word occurs, thereference is certainly to \"imposed tax\" or \"tribute\" rather than to a free-will offering or \"pres-ent,\" the sense in which Cameron assumes that the Aramaic texts on the ritual vessels have it.Because of the intoxicating character of haoma, it is tempting to regard 'Skr as a causative('Afel) form of the Semitic root skr, \"to fill,\" \"to saturate,\" \"to drink freely\" and to trans-late :skr as the verb, \"he became intoxicated.\" But it is the Pacel rather than ,Afcel or Hafcelform of the verb skr that is used in Aramaic to indicate intoxication. Moreover, althoughthere may be traces of an 'Afel form in Biblical Aramaic'3 and Egyptian Aramaic,'4 only Hafcelforms are attested hitherto in the Aramaic of Persepolis.Most promising for a Semitic solution to the word :skr is the Akkadian word Sikdru, \"drink,\"\"beverage,\" \"intoxicating drink.\"'\" It is found in Hebrew as Sdkar with the meaning \"intoxi-cating drink\"16 and in Aramaic as Sekar, which is used for \"strong drink other than wine.\"\" InPahlavi the Aramaic Skr is a logogram for Iranian x'ar, \"intoxicating drink.\" It can correspondto the Avestan hurd, \"kumiss.\"\"' Such Aramaic forms with a double consonant at their begin-ning because they do not have a full vowel in their first syllable may take a prosthetic 'alephin the Aramaic of Persepolis, as occasionally also in Biblical Aramaic. Thus, .ekar may be-come 'iskar, just as Aramaic tebac becomes )itbac in these texts.19Such an explanation of 'skr makes sense in the only text in which there is a demonstrablesyntactical relationship with an adjacent word. There (No. 62:3) the 'skr is associated withthe word \"pestle\" as bhiwn zy 'skr, \"pestle of (the) 'ckr.\" One might conjecture from this thatthe text should be read as \"pestle of (the making of) the intoxicant\" or \"pestle of (the makerof) the intoxicant.\" Some such translation is supported by a seemingly parallel expression thats Steingass, A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, pp. 62a, 65b; D. D. Kapadia (Glossary to the Pahlavi Vendi-ddd [Bombay, 1953], p. 231) cites a word us- of uncertain origin, in the Pahlavi Vendidfd, with the meaning \"drinking\"or \"drinker\" and, as a noun, \"a drink,\" \"beverage,\" \"cordial,\" \"wine.\" This, too, in its sense might be appropriate to indi-cate haoma; but we should then expect a spelling Dskr instead of Askr.9 Althcim and Stiehl, Aramdische Sprache I 20-21.10 See Schmidt, Persepolis II 55.1 Koehler and Baumgartner, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros (Leiden, 1948), p. 94a.12 CAD VII 248, iskaru A, 4; C.

Althoughmany of the texts are incomplete at the end and therefore lack their date, the morecomplete texts usually have a date, even when their formulae are abbreviated, as on thesmaller pestle tops. There is some evidence for its deliberate omission, however, on a few ofthe most severely reduced texts on pestles.'Dates are recorded by the year but without reference to the reigning sovereign. The datesrange from the first year to the twenty-ninth in the dated texts, but a comparison of theofficials mentioned in them indicates that not all texts are from the same reign.According to Professor Erich Schmidt, the Great Hall of the Hundred Columns (Room 38),in which most of the fragments of the ritual objects were recovered, belongs to the third build-ing phase of the Treasury, which was constructed probably after the death of Darius I. Sinceits building was closely connected with the construction of Xerxes' Harem building, for whichthe western parts of the first two sections of the Treasury were razed, Schmidt is inclinedto date the construction of the Hall of the Hundred Columns to the early years of Xerxes,between 486 and 480 B.C.2Because the debris of Hall 41 and all other parts of the Treasury contained only a few speci-mens of the green chert ritual vessels, the excavator declares that he is tempted to concludethat the ritual objects of green chert were made and used only after Hall 38 had been addedto the building.3In seeking an even more precise date for the green chert objects, Schmidt depended prin-cipally on the preliminary work done on the objects by Cameron, who noted that in theElamite Treasury tablets only one treasurer at a time was found at Persepolis in the textsthat are securely dated to the time of Darius I and Xerxes.4 Since he found that the treasurersmentioned in the Aramaic texts differed from those named in the Elamite texts in the tablets,Cameron contended that the Aramaic texts must be later than the time of Xerxes, datingpossibly from the reigns of two consecutive later rulers, probably Artaxerxes I (464-424 B.c.)and Darius II (423-405 B.C.) or, less probably, Artaxerxes II (404-359 B.c.) and ArtaxerxesIII (358-338 B.C.).5Cameron arrived at his dating by setting the texts in order, according to the officials men-tioned in them. To the reign of Artaxerxes I he attributed the ritual objects that mentionedthe treasurer Baga-pata between the fifteenth and twenty-fourth regnal years (450-441 B.C.)and those remaining, which name Baga-pata as treasurer presumably replaced by Data-Mithra, he assigned to the period 420-405 B.c., the fourth to the nineteenth years of the suc-ceeding ruler, Darius II, providing the first group was correctly dated to the reign of Arta-xerxes I.6SNos. 77, 126-29, 131, 133, 134. .Ibid., p. 182b.Schmidt, Persepolis I 200. 4 Cameron, PTT, p. 10a.6 Ibid., p. 34; Schmidt, Persepolis I 182b, II 55-56.6 Cameron, in Schmidt, Persepolis II 56.

An arrangement basedon both dates and official names here proposed7 produces more satisfactory results, with whichCameron now concurs. It is preferable to assume that the treasurer Data-Mithra precededrather than followed Baga-pata, since it is probable that the seal impressions depicting a scenefrom the haoma ceremony which date from the time of Xerxes8 are in fact those of the treas-urer Data-Mithra, who is named in many of the Aramaic texts on the ritual vessels.If we assume for the moment that Data-Mithra served as treasurer during the reign ofXerxes, the first dated text comes from the seventh year of his reign (479/78 B.c.),9 approxi-mately the date posited by the excavator on archeological grounds for the building of theHall of the Hundred Columns (Room 38), in which most of the cult objects were found. There-after, Data-Mithra served as treasurer for some years while Mithra-pata served as the segan.The nineteenth year of Xerxes (467/66 B.C.) appears to have been a critical one at Per-sepolis for the officers mentioned in the ritual vessels. It was a time of complete change, whenall offices were passed to others. During that year there were two treasurers and two segan'sas well as two sub-treasurers. They appear to have served contemporaneously and in variouscombinations during that year of transition.'0 The in-coming officers, the treasurer Baga-pataand the segan Mithraka are found together in the nineteenth year\" and serve alone in thetwentieth year and thereafter.Data-Mithra and Mithra-pata are no longer encountered as officers after the nineteenthyear. There are no inscribed ritual vessels dateable to a twenty-first year'2 but in a new seriesof dated texts, beginning with year one, the new officials, Baga-pata the treasurer and Mithra-ka the segan, are named.1 3 Thus, the dated texts indicate a change of personnel in the nine-teenth year and a change of reign after the twentieth. The only Achaemenid reign that qualifiesfor the first series of texts is that of Xerxes, who ruled exactly that long.Therefore, the texts in which Data-Mithra is mentioned belong to the first nineteen yearsof the reign of Xerxes and those in which Baga-pita appears as treasurer come from the lasttwo years of that reign and for at least the first twenty-nine years of Artaxerxes I.14 That some ofthe undateable texts probably go beyond the twenty-ninth year of Artaxerxes I is suggestedby a text (No. 122) that names an Arta-canah as treasurer instead of Baga-pata, as thoughhe were a successor.Historically, the period covered by the dated ritual texts, which refer to many high mili-tary officials, was a most momentous one for Persia, politically and militarily. It encompassesthe time of conflict between Persia and the Greeks and the subsequent withdrawal of thePersians to Asia.The year 480 B.c., just before the dated ritual texts began, was the apex of Persian militarySSee Table 1. 8 See p. 6. 9 No. 1.10 See Nos. 14-18 inclusive; Data-Mithra and Mithra-pata (Nos. 14, 15); Baga-pata and Mithra-plta (No. 16); andData-Mithra and Tmrk (= Mithraka) (No. 17); and the completely new corps of Baga-pata, Mithraka, and Mazda-data(No. 18).\"1 No. 18.12 An Egyptian papyrus (Cowley, AP, No. 6) extends the reign of Xerxes to a 21st year, which it calls \"when KingArtaxerxes sat on his throne\" (i.e., the accession year of Artaxerxes I).

Despite naval disasters at Artemisium and Salamis, the massive armiesof Xerxes in that year penetrated Europe at the expense of the disorganized and competingGreek states. They crossed the Hellespont at Abydos, secured the pass at Thermopylae, en-tered Athens without opposition by mid-August, and burned most of the city, including thetemples on the Acropolis. Victoriously the Persians returned to Asia to winter at Sardis inLydia under the command of General Mardonius.The first year of the dated ritual texts, 479/78 B.c., began well for the Persians but endedin irretrievable disaster for them when the Greek states began a defensive war to drive thePersians from Europe and to recover Asiatic cities that had been settled earlier by the Greeks.When diplomatic overtures by the Persian general, Mardonius, who sought to avert furthermilitary conflict, were repulsed by the Greeks, the Persians again marched against an aban-doned Athens, where they destroyed whatever remained of the city and desolated Attica be-fore retiring to a stockaded camp near Plataea.From August of 479 B.c. to the end of the reign of Xerxes, the Persians knew nothing butdisaster. The Greeks under Pausanius soundly defeated them at Plataea, capturing their camp,routing the armies, and slaughtering Persians without mercy. On August 27, 479 B.C., theywere utterly defeated in a decisive battle at Mycale in which their fleet was burned and nativePersians died almost to a man.During the year, two of the six Persian armies in Europe were completely destroyed and athird had to leave Europe to guard the centers in western Asia that were under Persian con-trol.

In 475 B.C. Cimon led the Greek fleet of the Delian League against Eion on theStrymon, one of the last points in the West still held by the Persians. Then only Doriscusremained as a Persian stronghold in Europe.In 466 B.C., under the leadership of Cimon, the war against Persia was resumed. By per-suasion or force revolt was stirred in the cities of Caria and Greek garrisons were set in them.When Xerxes sent a large fleet and army under Ariomandes against Cimon, another decisivebattle was fought at the mouth of the Eurymedon River during which the Persians weresoundly defeated. So helpless had the Persians become that in 465 B.C. Cimon with only fourships drove thirteen Persian vessels from the Chersonese.By 465 B.c. the die was cast. Europe was lost to Persia and even the Asiatic Greeks turnedwestward, with large numbers of them, including Carians and Lycians, joining the DelianLeague against Persia. Before the end of the year the disaster became personal for Xerxes,and he lost his life in a palace revolt, bequeathing a world of problems to his successor.The early years of Artaxerxes I were busy with personal problems arising from harem in-trigue and from competition for the throne. But the West, at that time, was in the midst ofa conflict between Athenians and Spartans and was no better prepared to prosecute the war.The Athenian Cimon was ostracized in 461 B.C. and a new leader, Ephialtes, at once sent theAthenian fleet eastward, looking in vain for the grand fleet of Persia. When Pericles came topower, he, too, prepared to confront the Persians. He equipped two hundred ships to invadeCyprus, which had returned to Persian control.In 462 B.C. Prince Hystaspes, the satrap of Bactria, rebelled against central authority andsought independent rule. Artaxerxes ordered his destruction, and after two bloody battlesroyal authority was restored in Bactria. Meanwhile, in Egypt, too, there was rebellion, forthe native Inaros challenged Persia and sought Athenian support. Pericles diverted to Egyptthe vessels he had prepared for the Cyprus invasion, and the rebels and their Greek allies cap-tured Memphis and besieged the Persian garrison within the White Wall.Artaxerxes sent another large army led by Megabyzos from Cilicia to relieve the Memphisgarrison in 456 B.C. The tide turned in Persia's favor; the allies, decisively defeated, fled toan island in the swamps of the Egyptian delta where they were besieged for eighteen monthsbefore they surrendered. Fifty Greek triremes that had been sent to relieve the embattledGreeks and Egyptian rebels were sunk by the Phoenician allies of the Persians. The Egyptianrevolt was ended and Megabyzos returned to Susa in triumph in 454 B.C. with Inaros and theGreek generals.In 451 B.C., anti-Persian Cimon returned to Athens after ten years in exile and began atonce to stimulate an anti-Persian policy in the West. A renewal of the war was voted in450 B.c., and a fleet was sent to assist an Egyptian rebel, Amyrtaeus. Another fleet invadedthe Persian territory of Cyprus, where Marium was captured and Citium was besieged untilprovisions failed and Cimon died.After the death of Cimon the Greeks realized the futility of expecting a total victory overwealthy Persia and its seemingly unlimited manpower. An embassy, headed by Callias, wassent to Susa in 449 B.C. to discuss peace. Since both sides realized that a stalemate had beenreached, two spheres of influence in the West were determined, separated by a demilita-rized zone.THE DATE61oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLISBut the Peace of Callias was not a lasting one. By 445 B.c. Pericles had become as anti-Persian as his predecessor Cimon had been. After a thirty-year peace had been concludedwith Sparta, Athens was free to renew the war against Persia. A bribe from the Libyan rebelPsammeticus again involved the Greeks in an Egyptian revolt against Persia, breaking thePeace of Callias. Pericles broke another point in the agreement by pushing Athenian controleastward to include in Athenian tribute districts the states that Athens had left to the Persiansatrapies-Caria, lonia, Hellespont, and the islands. He took advantage of a quarrel betweenSamos and Miletus in 441 B.C. to invade the island of Samos and reorganize it as a democracy.But appeals from Samos to the Persian satrap at Sardis produced funds for mercenaries whothen recovered the island and turned its Athenian garrison over to the Persians.In retaliation the Persians again moved into Lycia and by the end of 440 B.c. they hadwon back Gargara, Scepsis, Cebren, the Western Zeleia, and Astacus. They next secured thewhole interior of Caria and so much of the coast that between 440 B.c. and 438 B.c. twelvecities were dropped from the Athenian list of tributaries.'6In the spring of 439 B.c. Pericles again regained Samos and began to exert the authorityof the Greeks in the Black Sea area, where Amisus was colonized as a second Piraeus and in438 B.C. Sinope became a Greek colony.'\"In 431 B.C. plague struck Ethiopia, Egypt, Athens, and large parts of the Persian empire.In that year, too, the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) broke out, and Artaxerxes I spenthis last years watching his enemies destroy one another.Thus, the period covered by the dated ritual objects (479-435 B.c.) was a critical one forPersia and a trying one for its armies. The threat of the West was a real one. The reign ofXerxes was a disaster after 480 B.C., with one critical loss after another by the Persian armies.Troops were constantly being marshalled for service, grappling with the foe, and beingreconstituted as a military unit after disaster. Only limited success marked the reign ofArtaxerxes I.Persian commanders learned the bitterness of defeat. They led great armies into battleonly to see them decimated or utterly destroyed. Desperately they sought support and vic-tory. They needed the wise guidance and support of Mithra, their god of war, as well as thatof Ahuramazda. In such a context the haoma ceremony became meaningful throughout theperiod and the participation of the chief military leaders of the Persian armies during thatinterval is understandable.16 Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire (Chicago, 1948), p. 343.16 Ibid., p. 344.62oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"XITHE LINGUISTIC PHENOMENATHE formulaic character of the ritual texts inevitably restricts the number of grammaticaland syntactical phenomena to be considered. They are principally those already encoun-tered in the Aramaic papyri and parchments of the Achaemenid period. Deviationsfrom the structures and uses of standard \"Reichsaramiische\" are to be construed as evidencenot that the texts are in the Persian language' but that Aramaic has been influenced by OldPersian. As might be expected, Aramaic and Persian in use side by side mutually influencedone another. Kent has suggested that the written style of Old Persian reflects that of Aramaic.2But, as will be seen below, in some respects the Aramaic texts here discussed have departuresfrom normal Aramaic usage which are perhaps due to the influence of Old Persian syntax.LOANWORDSThere is a surprising number of loanwords in these rather brief texts.3 A few are words fromAkkadian that have been Aramaized and have long been known from Biblical Aramaic andthe papyri (for example, byrt', Akkadian birtu; sgn', Akkadian Saknu/Sakenu).As might be expected, most of the loanwords are Iranian. These include:'bkwn, \"pestle\" (Iranian abi-su-ana?)'hSynpyn/'hSynpn, \"dark... color\" (?) (cf. Old Persian axSaina)'pgnzbr, \"sub-treasurer\" (Old Persian upa-ganzabara)bLt, \"wine\" (Old Persian batu)bg, \"god,\" \"portion,\" \"good fortune\" (Old Persian baga)bz/bzy, a kind(?)

Late Avestan maidma)pty, \"value,\" \"worth\" (Old Persian patiy)PHONETICSSEMITICAlthough the Semitic dental spirant bi is usually represented by z, there is one instance (No.44:3) in which the letter d is used (dnh), although in the same text it appears as z (zy).4 Theuse of a prosthetic 'aleph and vowel (probably -i) to break up a consonantal cluster at thebeginning of a word5 is attested by the words (tbc (itbac), \"(shekel) coin\" (compare TalmudicAramaic tebac), and presumably also in 'Nkr, \"intoxicant\" (compare Aramaic jkar).6SSee p. 41. 2 Kent, Old Persian, p. 9, Sec. 12.SA few words are still uncertain as to etymology and linguistic relationship. Some also are problematic as to their read-ing, for instance, ggbs or .tzgbs or nzgbs in No. 1:3, wtpn in No. 161:1, ..nh.wyn in No. 74:3.

But there are some Aramaic letters, especially those used to express non-Semiticsounds, that deserve special consideration here.7In the transcription of Iranian words and names the Aramaic letters t, caiyn, and s are notused in these ritual texts, although t and s are used in Middle-Iranian words found in theTalmud.8 Since Aramaic 1 would not be expected in a Persian name, its single example, inthe name Kl (Kal?), in two texts (Nos. 94 and 95), must mark a foreigner. The Semitic letter qoccurs rarely, once in a difficult combination, in the curious name Kqyz (No. 50:2).As in the Talmud,9 Iranian h is expressed in the Persian names here by either Aramaich or h. Thus, the Persian vahu, \"good,\" can be spelled as either vahu (for example, Whwprn,Vahu-farnah, in No. 119:1) or vahu (as in Araya(t)-vahus in No. 48:2; compare Araya(t)-vahus in No. 49:2 and others) and hu- is written as a name element either as h (for example,Hsdk, Husadaka(?) in No. 98:2) or hw- (HwrSypt, Hvarsya-pata, in No. 37:3).But Aramaic h is also used to indicate the Persian voiceless velar spirant x, just as in thelater Talmudic transcriptions of Persian loanwords.10 Thus, the element suxra- appears as shr-in the name Shrrt, Suxra-ra0a (No. 44:2).If the name 'dwst (Nos. 3:3, 48:2, 120:2) is derived from *a-daulta or *a-dulta, there ismanifest already in Persepolis the change St > st characteristic of Middle Persian (daulta >dost) noted by Eilers.\"Aramaic 5 is used in the ritual texts to indicate both the Iranian alveolar sibilant N and thepalatal affricate 6, which Kent symbolizes by c. Such usage, too, is found in the Talmudictreatment of Middle-Persian loanwords.12 Thus, we find in these texts the name elements-5anah (in 'rtun', Arta-Eanah in No. 122:3), -c~ra (in MhSr, Mah(a)-Eara, No. 32:2), and-iO0ra (BgStr, Baga-ciera in No. 117:3 and Mzdttr, Mazda-ieora in No. 36:2).Aramaic t is used for both the Persian dental stop t and its voiceless spirant 0.13The Iranian phoneme 0r is a special problem for transcription into Aramaic letters. Thesound 0' persisted in Avestan and Median but became a sibilant (symbolized by g by Kent)in Old Persian, where it \"apparently was a sound intermediate between the pure dental s andthe palatal S.\"14In the Aramaic transcriptions of Persian names in the ritual texts the phoneme 0' occursoften in the name Mithra, perhaps in the element pdOra- in the name Dsptrwk (No. 26:3),and quite frequently with the word iOera.'5 It cannot be determined from the Aramaic spell-ing mtr whether the pronunciation was Mitra or MBOra, both of which are found in Old Persianinscriptions.6 But the use of the double consonant tr regularly in pdOra and £i0ra seems to favorthe latter form.7 S.

It appears that Ciora-farnah is written as S$prn (Nos. 50:3 and 53:5). It wouldseem that even after a sibilant the Or became g and was then assimilated to the preceding sibi-lant.1In Middle Persian the phoneme g becomes h and it is often so spelled in Persian loanwordsfound in the Talmud.18 There may be evidence for such a shift as early as Achaemenid timesif the name Phrbrn (No. 116:2) is Pahra-barana for an earlier PaOra-barana and the element...phr in a broken name (No. 90:2) represents earlier pdOra.The familiar Persian consonantal cluster xS appears as hS in the name HStr, Xsaera (No.89:2) and apparently also in the adjective axzaina, \"dark,\" if that is indeed an element inthe Persian word 'h4yn-pyn/'hSyn-pn (for example, Nos. 11:3, 101:2, and others).It has been noted above that there is a possible example of assimilation of consonants inthe name Sprn for Ciora-farnah (for example, CiOra > Jigra > ci6ra [or &i*ra?]). Unless thereis a simple error in spelling, another example of assimilation may be found in the spelling snifor sgn', segan (No. 124:2). The g appears to be assimilated to the following n as signdm be-comes sinna'. Still another instance may exist in the name Mazda in which the letters zdseemed to trouble some writers. The name Mzprn (Nos. 21:2, 118:2) may represent Mazza-farnah for Mazda-farnah, just as Mazdaka is written Mazakes (Ma-aKfls) in Greek.19The awkward Mdzprn (No. 54:2) shows another treatment of the zd in Mazda involvingmetathesis. Other examples of metathesis found in the ritual texts include the spellings tmrkand mrtk for the segan Mithraka (Nos. 17:2, 85:2) and cdb for the verb 9bd (No. 134:2).VERBSINFINITIVEThe single example of an infinitive in the ritual texts is lh§l (No. 8:3) used to express pur-pose, \"for crushing.\"The form is rather unusual for the simple Aramaic infinitive, since such a form has beendisplaced usually by the miqtal nominal form.2 0 One would have expected ImhSl.There is abundant evidence, however, for the survival of the older form of the infinitive asl~mr, which is found as late as Assyrian times21 and is used in the Aramaic papyri of the Achae-menid period far more often22 than the expected forms n\"lrnr•23 and -1.r9.24 One might perhapsregard l'mr as a stereotyped survival of the earlier form that has come to be used to indicatedirect discourse. But such an early form also persists in the Biblical lbn' (Ezra 5:3, 13), whichRosenthal rightly recognizes as a survival of the older form.2 5FINITE VERBThere is but scant evidence for the verb in these formulaic texts, but what is found is inter-esting and significant.

Since the form used where the subject is plural iscbdw (No. 95:3), it is apparent that the perfect form rather than a participle is intended.Thus, it is probably to be understood as the Pecal perfect form of the verb and translated as\"he worked\" or \"he used\" the object.26What appears to be the masculine plural form cbdw is found not only in the few instancesin which the subject is compound (Nos. 88 and 95) but also, surprisingly, in a number ofexamples in which the subject is singular (Nos. 2:3, 13:2, 14:2, 15:3 and probably 20:3).Such usage, what appears to be a plural verb for a singular subject, is also found in the ostracafrom Nisd in Turkestan and in the controversial bilingual text found at Armazi.2 7 Since theritual texts are several hundred years earlier than the earliest recognized \"heterographic\"writing of Aramaic as Persian logograms and since there are so few examples in these manytexts, it is probable that there is an Aramaic explanation of such forms.28 The proposal ofAltheim and Stiehl, that the additional -w is an enclitic form of an auxiliary verb, as foundelsewhere in later Aramaic,29 is worth consideration. Perhaps the past character of the actionis stressed by such an addition and the form is to be translated as \"he has used.\"ADVERBAs the Aramaic text of the Behistun Inscription shows,30 the Aramaic noun Smh, \"hisname,\" reflects syntactically a typical Old Persian phenomenon, the adverbial use of nama,\"by name,\" or \"namely,\" after a personal name. In Persian it is used with the first referenceto the name of any person or place, other than that of a governmental province or the rulingking.31 In these texts the word is never used with the name of a place or with those of the seganor treasurers but only after the name of the celebrant.32NOUNS AND ADJECTIVESGENDER AND NUMBERMost of the nouns encountered in the ritual texts are masculine and singular. The onlyfeminine noun is Snt, \"year,\" which appears in most texts, and the only plural form is themasculine absolute plural (bcn (Nos. 43:4, 73:5). There are no examples of the determinateplural.STATEAbsolute.-Absolute forms are found more frequently than those in the determinate state.The titles 'lp and pig are regularly absolute in form, appositive to the names that precedethem. The word gll, \"stone,\" is absolute. So, too, is the Persian bt, \"wine,\" and 'Skr, where itis in the same construction as bIt (No. 62:4). The Aramaic prk (No. 5:3) is also absolute. Ofthe names of the objects, hwn, \"mortar,\" is invariably in the absolute state and the words for\"pestle\" ('bSwn) and \"plate\" (shr) usually are. The few examples of byrt, \"fortress,\" thatseem to be in the absolute state where the determinate form is expected, are apparently in-complete words.33The indefinite character of absolute nouns is frequently indicated in these texts by the use26 See pp. 39-40. 27 See pp. 40-42. 28 See pp. 42-43.29 See p. 42; Altheim and Stiehl, Aramdische Sprache I 43, 274, cbd.30 Behistun Inscription, col. ii, 1. 49 (= Aramaic 1. 7), col. iii, 11. 21 (= Aramaic 1. 22), 30-31 (= Aramaic 1. 25).31 Kent, Old Persian, p. 97b, Sec. 312.32 Such usage is found in the Bible (Ezra 5:14) and in the Aramaic papyri (Cowley, AP, No. 28:4, 5, 9, 13, No. 33:1-5,and No. 66 Frag. 1, Ahiqar, 11. 1, 5, 18) and often in the Aramaic text of the Behistun Inscription (see n. 30 above).33 See p. 20. Unless what seems to be byrtn (No. 77:2) is a misspelling or presents a unique form of 'aleph, resemblingletter n, the word may be a hybrid showing Persian influence (see p. 141).66oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE LINGUISTIC PHENOMENAof a single unit stroke, numeral one, used as an indefinite article (for example, 1 Jlt~2H [Nos.26:4, 66:3] instead of simple ]ltv3l [No. 131:3]).34Construct.-At least one example of the construct state of a noun is found in almost everytext. The only feminine form is Snt, \"year of,\" which precedes the figure in every date thatis preserved.The words srk/srwk, prkn, and hst before the word byrt' at the beginning of each text areinvariably construct nouns.3 5 Such, too, must be the syntax of 'lp pig, \"a chiliarch of a divi-sion\" (No. 118:3), and of the collocation rcyn bg (Nos. 47:3, 52:3). It seems that a doubleconstruct occurs in the numerous instances in which the word :'kr appears before the date.Determinate.-The determinate state, \"status emphaticus,\" is found in the ritual texts, asin the papyri and Biblical Aramaic, but it is not always found where expected. As in BiblicalAramaic,3\" foreign words are less likely than Semitic words to have the final 'aleph of the de-terminate state. But the title of the segan is invariably in the determinate state and theword byrt' is presumably always intended to be so. The names of the pestle ('bgwn) and plate(shr) may appear in the determinate state when used with the demonstrative pronoun znh.7It is difficult to be sure of the state of the titles of the treasurers. They appear to be de-terminate because of their final 'aleph, but that may only be an attempt to render the final -aof the Persian word ganzabara. The Persian word hwn, \"mortar,\" is never in the determinatestate, not even when the use of the demonstrative pronoun would call for a determinate nounto conform to correct Aramaic syntax. Such usage is also found in the majority of instanceswhen the object is the pestle3 8 and less often, apparently analogically, when it is a plate.3 9 Thoseomissions are probably due to Persian influence, since there is no definite article in Old Per-sian.40ADJECTIVESSince the ritual objects are of various sizes, adjectives mentioning the fact are frequentlyencountered. Mortars, pestles, and plates are called \"large\" (rb); only mortars and pestlesare called \"small\" (zcyr) or \"medium-sized\" (mdm, an Iranian word). The word \"large,\" inthe determinate state (rbI) to agree with the noun sgn', is used to designate the \"chief\" officialof the class (No. 2:2), and rb is also used to indicate a \"great\" or \"important\" ceremony inwhich the vessels were used to crush haoma (No. 5:3). In a few instances (Nos. 9:3, 13:3,14:3, 17:5) the adjective pyrk, \"crushing,\" is used to modify the noun \"pestle.\" The difficultreading nqwr, which appears without context in a badly damaged text (No. 161:2), is alsoapparently adjectival since its root seems to be nqr, which is used in the sense of \"to chisel,\"\"to shape stones.\"41Sometimes there is an attempt to indicate the color of the stone. It is probable that thePersian word kpwtk, kapautaka, must be an adjective of color, \"pigeon color\" (greenish-blue?)14 Biblical Aramaic uses the numeral hd, \"one,\" as an indefinite article (Ezra 4:8, 6:2; Dan. 2:31). So also in the papyri(Cowley, AP, Nos. 26:12, 27:5). In the Behistun Inscription (col. iii, 1. 57), where the Old Persian has 1 martiyam, theAramaic version (1. 38) has ys hld, \"a man,\" which is the equivalent of :ys 1 in these ritual texts. Cf. Kent, Old Persian, p.85b, Sec. 262, II.35 The lack of the word \"fortress\" (No. 137:1) is the result of abbreviation and does not necessarily indicate that thesrk is to be regarded as absolute.36 BLA, p. 308, Sec. 88g; Rosenthal, A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic, p. 24, Sec. 46.37 biumwn znh only in Nos. 13:3 and 15:4; shr4 znh often (e.g., Nos. 19:3, 43:3, 44:3, etc.).88 biwn znh, Nos. 2:3-4, 3:4, 10:3-4, etc.\"9 shr znh, Nos. 18:2, 48:4-5, 52:3, 92:4, etc. Likewise in the Aramaic inscription of Hellenistic Warka, a Semitic wordis written ungrammatically in the absolute state when the Akkadian expression Aa sumiiu Aan· is written zy imh rhminstead of zy Smh uhrn (R. A. Bowman, \"Anu-Uballit-Kefalon,\" AJSL LVI [1939] 233).4 0 Kent, Old Persian, p. 85a, Sec. 262.41 Jastrow, Dictionary II 935a, 'lp3 I. = \"dig,\" \"chisel,\" \"bore,\" \"perforate,\" \"chisel (stones).\"67oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLISsince the usual translation of the word as \"lapis lazuli\" is inappropriate.

The usage isidentical with that of the Aramaic papyri of the Achaemenid period: small vertical strokes ingroups of three, up to nine, are used to indicate units. The number one is often used in thesense of an indefinite pronoun. A horizontal arc (-)) is used for ten, and a double arc, re-sembling a figure 3, stands for the figure twenty.What appears to be a figure 543 in No. 4 is doubtless an unusually vertical figure 10.PREPOSITIONSPrepositions figure prominently and importantly in the ritual texts. The prefixed letter b,\"in,\" begins most texts, introducing the construct nouns srk, prkn, and hst. It is also usedwith the absolute nouns prk as \"in a crushing (ceremony)\" (No. 5:3) and cyd as \"in a festival\"(No. 112:5). It occurs, too, with place names to indicate places associated with the segan (No.94:2) and the treasurers (Nos. 9:4, 13:4, 14:4 and others).The preposition 1, \"to,\" is used once with an infinitive form to express purpose (No. 8:3).Elsewhere it is used in these texts only in combination. It occurs with the noun \"hand\" (lyd)to express the positional idea of \"at the hand of\" or \"beside\" to indicate the relative positionsof the celebrant, the segan, and the treasurer during the haoma ceremony.44 As \"to\" or \"for\"the preposition I is combined in rather unusual fashion with the Persian preposition patiy,used in the sense of \"value\" or \"equivalence\" (No. 43:4).In the sense of \"before\" or \"opposite\" the preposition qdm, \"in front of,\" is used in the ritualtexts to indicate the relative positions of the celebrant and sub-treasurer during the haomaceremony.The preposition Cm, \"with,\" or \"together with,\" occurs on mortars (Nos. 1:3, 46:4, 103:3;compare Nos. 14:3, 16:3) when their related pestles are also mentioned in the texts and onpestles (Nos. 10:4, 17:4) when the accompanying mortars are also named.42 Unless the word is a hybrid with the Persian affix -ana to indicate \"place of crushing\"; cf. p. 22.43 Such a figure is found in the Samaritan ostraca, Palmyrene, and elsewhere but not in the Aramaic papyri. It would beunique in the ritual texts and definitely not part of the numerical system.4See p. 32.68oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE LINGUISTIC PHENOMENAPRONOUNSPRONOMINAL SUFFIXThe only example of a pronominal suffix in these texts is the affixed h used with tm, \"name,\"as Smh, \"his name,\" when used for the Old Persian ndma, \"namely\" (see above).DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNThe demonstrative pronoun znh, \"this,\" (once dnh in No. 44:3) is used only adjectivallyin these Aramaic texts, following the noun as in the majority of instances in Biblical Aramaicand the papyri.Sometimes the noun so designated is in the determinate state, as it should be in Aramaic(for example 'bSwn' znh in Nos. 13:3, 15:4 and shr' znh in No. 19:3). But quite often thenoun is in the absolute state ('bSwn znh in No. 27:5 and shr znh in No. 18:2). That phenomenonmay reflect the influence of Old Persian, which lacks an article.45RELATIVE PARTICLE zyThe indeclinable particle zy is used, as elsewhere in Aramaic, to introduce a relative clause.Thus, there is found sometimes gnzbrl zy bhrhwty, \"the treasurer who is in Arachosia\" (Nos.9:4, 43:5-6, and others) and \"the treasurer who is in GhStk\" (No. 14:4).As in Biblical Aramaic and the papyri, the particle zy is also used to express a relationshipbetween nouns. Most frequently it is found in such a construction as hwn zy gll, \"a mortarof stone\" (literally, \"a mortar, that which is stone\"). It may also be used as a modifier of gll,\"stone,\" as in the example hwn zy gll zy bz, \"a mortar of bz stone\" (No. 116:2-3).Two texts which show its use in establishing relationship between nouns deserve specialconsideration. One (No. 29:4) describes a pestle as 'btwn zy b't, \"pestle of wine,\" which mustsignify \"a pestle used for making wine.\" The other (No. 62:3) has 'bSwn zy 'tkr, \"pestle of'skr,\" which must have a similar meaning. It must indicate \"the pestle used for making theintoxicant,\" in these texts, \"the pestle used for pressing haoma.\"WORD ORDERSUBJECT-VERBNormally in the ritual texts the subject precedes the verb, following an order sometimesalso encountered in Biblical Aramaic,46 even when there is no special emphasis on the subjectto warrant such deviation from the more normal Semitic order. The phenomenon is probablydue to the influence of Old Persian, in which it is normal for the subject to precede.4 7ADJECTIVE AND DEMONSTRATIVEAs indicated above, the demonstrative pronoun is used in adjectival position after the nounthat it modifies. Except in the case of the Persian noun, which is always in the absolute state,the noun with the demonstrative pronoun may be in the determinate state (Nos. 15, 19, 49, 73)or, more usually, in the absolute state (Nos. 52, 54, 58, 59 and others).When an adjective of size is added, the scribe could write 'bswn mdm (No. 57) or 'bSwn mdm 1(No. 21) for \"a medium-sized pestle\" or hwn rb znh for \"this large mortar\" (No. 14; compare\"6 Kent, Old Persian, p. 85a, Sec. 262.4l BLA, p. 332, Sec. 99, pp. 342 ff., Sec. 101, and p. 372.47 Kent, Old Persian, p. 96, Sec. 310. Bauer and Leander (BLA, p. 332, Sec. 99a) attribute such order to the influence ofAkkadian, but the order in Old Aramaic, which might be expected to shqw such influence, places the verb first. It would bebetter to assume Persian influence. The statistics on order in Biblical Aramaic presented by W. Baumgartner (\"DasAramiischen im Buche Daniel,\" ZATW XLV [1927] 128 ff.) show that the proportion of subject-verb to verb-subject isin the Aramaic of Daniel 120 to 80 and of Ezra 30 to 15.69oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"70 ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLISNos. 38, 55, 64). But the latter can be written also with the adjective after the demonstra-tive pronoun as shrý znh rb (No. 43; compare No. 41:2-3) or even as the unusual shr znh rb 1(No. 18), which perhaps must be read as \"this one large plate\" or \"this, a large plate.\"Similarly, when the descriptive zy gll, \"of stone,\" is used with the demonstrative pronoun,the writer had the option of writing it as hwn zy gll znh, \"this mortar of stone\" (Nos. 24, 33),or as hwn znh zy gll (No. 5; compare Nos. 20, 72, 109, 112, 113). When an adjective of size isinvolved, it is usually written as hwn zy gll zcyr znh, \"this small mortar of stone\" (Nos. 31,118; compare No. 88:3), with the demonstrative pronoun at the very end. But there is oneexample (No. 33) where the text probably has hwn zy gll znh zcyr with the adjective \"small\"after the demonstrative pronoun.Where both the mortar and pestle are mentioned in the same text, a demonstrative pronounat the end perhaps refers to both objects, whether used in such a simple form as hwn Em 'bSwnznh, \"this mortar with (this) pestle\" (No. 46), or in such a complex statement as hwn zy gll(cm) 'bswn pyrk znh, \"this mortar of stone (with) (this) crushing pestle\" (No. 13), or hwn zygll tzgbs Cm 'b6wn znh, \"this mortar of tzgbs stone with (this) mortar\" (No. 1).

Such use of lyd is attested in Akkadianand the Bible and also in the Aramaic fortification tablets of the time of Darius I.9The name 'mdt is doubtless the same as the mam-ma-da-a-tu mentioned in a cuneiform textof the time of Darius I.o1 It may also be concealed in the name Madatas mentioned by Xeno-phon\" and the Medaths and 'Aja80-7Os by which Josephus (Anliq. XI. vi. 5) and the Septua-gint respectively render the Persian name Hammedatha of the Bible (Esther 3:1).12 Whilethe present 'mdt might be a graphic variant of the Biblical name, it is preferable to regard thefirst element of the name as the Persian ama-, \"strength,\" \"might,\" which sometimes is usedto indicate a divine manifestation.13The title segan, an Aramaized form of Akkadian Saknu, which originally meant a royalappointee, still indicates a relatively important official in these Aramaic texts.14 As in theBible (Dan. 2:48) there appears to have been a \"chief segan\" who, at this time, was Mithra-pata.15Ama-data was apparently a subordinate segan. He is found sporadically in the reigns ofboth Xerxes and Artaxerxes I, as well as in some undateable texts.16LINE 2The name of the celebrant, the subject of the verb cbd, is uncertain. It is probably damagedat the beginning, where the edge of the inscribed surface is broken away. One, or possiblyeven two letters could have stood there. The first visible traces, at the very edge of the break,suggest the lower part of a letter m. The final letter of the name is certainly s, which maybe added optionally to noun stems ending in the vowels -i and -u, as in the names Daraya(t)-vahu(s) and Araya(t)-vahu(S).1 Before the -9 are two letters that appear to be identical andmost closely resemble the letter -s. But the combination -sss is impossible and the reading mustbe . .mbwS, which could represent either Iranian . .mbw• or . .mbwt.The verb ^bd regularly describes the action in the Aramaic texts.

But, as in the lines that follow, the text can be restored with great probability on thebasis of well-recognized formulae.The first word, the clearest in the line, is nevertheless difficult and uncertain. To judge fromits position, it must modify gll, indicating the kind or quality of the stone. The last three let-ters are clearly gbs, but it is uncertain what is before them. A letter may be missing at the be-ginning of the word, where the margin is broken. Close inspection suggests that the mostlikely reading is .tzgbs or less probably 'nzgbs. Its etymology and meaning are still uncertain.Since several mortar texts mention the pestle used with them (for example, Nos. 46:4,103:3), this line doubtless makes such a reference, introduced by a somewhat smudged Cm,\"with,\" near the middle of the line.

Alarge spall at one edge of the head has struck away some of the Aramaic text and a dark hori-zontal band in the stone obscures a line of the Aramaic. The chip has removed the centralparts of the first two lines. The fourth line is written on top of the dark band, rendering theend of the line almost illegible.

In his earliercopy the first two letters are written close together, but he later left space between them, asthough they belonged to different words, possibly because he then thought that the remainderwas mdy, \"a Mede.\" There is no such space between the first two letters, and the last letterdoes resemble an n. It is possible that there was a letter or two before the letter t, but that isuncertain. If the name is read as . .tmrn, it is unique for an officer in these texts and mightindicate another subordinate segan.But the writer is inexperienced and the final letter might be a carelessly made k. In the lightof the spelling mrtk for Mithraka (No. 85:2) it is probable that tmrk, too, is a misspelling ofthe name of the popular segan Mithraka. The error would be understandable since even insome experienced hands the letters m and t closely resemble one another, as indeed they dohere in Cameron's earlier copy.The name probably represents Mithraka,101 an abbreviation of a longer name that beganwith the divine name Mithra. To Mithra is added the affix -aka, which is used for abbreviatedor pet names.102 The officer Mithraka is found as segan from the nineteenth year of Xerxes(467/66 B.c.) until the seventh year of Artaxerxes I (458/57 B.c.), while Baga-pata wastreasurer.LINE 3The name of the celebrant is broken at its beginning.

It is prob-ably the first year of Artaxerxes I (464/63 B.C.) or, to judge from the spacing of Cameron'scopy, one of the first few years of that reign.LINE 3While the spacing in Cameron's copy may be inexact, it would allow for four missing lettersor spaces, too much for the expected verb 9bd alone before the word \"pestle.\" Although itwould help to read the verb as cbdw, as in No. 2:3 and others, still too much space remains.If Cameron's spacing is even approximately right, one cannot conceive what might have in-tervened between the verb and its object.In Cameron's copy the first letter of the word \"pestle\" appears to be a k but that is obviouslyincorrect.

It is presumably to be readafter the demonstrative pronoun znh at the end of the third line, a peculiar form of syntaxencountered elsewhere in these texts.202 It could not have been added to the third line, whichruns to the very edge of the base.The word Ipty is difficult. It must further the description of the vessel, and from its positionand context must describe the cost or value of the object.20 3The use of the letter 1 suggests that the word is Semitic, but no Aramaic word seems to fitthe present context. The word is probably Persian, related to the Avestan paiti-, Old Persianpatiy-, which is used in the sense of \"equivalence\" and \"for\" when price or payment is in-volved.2 04 In its context Ipty must signify \"for the value of,\" since what follows precludes anidea of the vessel's content. As is often the case, the Aramaic preposition 1, \"to\" or \"for,\" isprefixed to a word to form a compound preposition,20 5 unless the word pty itself has cometo be recognized as a substantive, \"value,\" in Aramaic.The word tbcn preceding the numeral is the masculine plural form of tbc ('itbac).

Presumably the 'tb' of our text has the same value.The coinage of Darius I, among the earliest known, consisted of the daric, a gold coin ofvery pure quality and a silver shekel (Greek siglos) of silver ninety per cent fine. These coins,roughly oval, were struck from egg-shaped globules of metal. Their types were the same. Theobverse depicted the Persian king kneeling with a bow in his left hand and a spear in his right.The reverse had only a rough, irregular incuse caused by the striking. They bore no inscrip-tion. Darius I and his successors preferred the silver shekel, which was equal to one-twentiethof the gold daric and to the Greek half-stater.21Plutarch preserves rumors of tremendous stores of coined money (vostularos) at bothSusa and Persepolis when they were conquered by Alexander the Great. He reports that40,000 talents of coined money was taken from the palace at Susa21 5 and claims, \". .theysay that as much coined money was found there (that is, Persis/Persepolis) as at Susa andthat it took 10,000 pairs of mules and 5000 camels to carry away the other furniture andwealth there.\"216 Claudius Aelianus states that each ambassador to the court of Artaxerxes IIreceived a Babylonian talent in coined silver in addition to other gifts.21Despite such rumors of a huge deposit of coins at Persepolis, only thirty-nine coins wererecovered there, only twenty-three from the Treasury. Most of them antedate the founda-tion of Persepolis. Surprisingly, there was not found among them a single Persian daric orshekel.218In the Achaemenid period the Semitic shekel is well attested, not only in the cuneiformbusiness documents of Babylonia but also, as a loanword, among the Jews of Palestine21 9 andin Egypt.220 The word has not yet been found at Persepolis. To judge from this text, theAramaic word used for the shekel in Achaemenid Persia was it(bac, which is also used in Tal-mudic circles of later times.

The fifteenth yearof Artaxerxes I was 450/49 B.c.LINE 2The spelling of the segan's name, 'ryhw, which is unique, is probably an error for the 'rywhwfound elsewhere (for example, No. 46:2).The name of the celebrant is extremely faint and uncertain. It certainly begins with theletter b, as Cameron read it. It is faint but relatively clear in the photograph. It seems to befollowed by a y and a difficult sign which most resembles a S. The next letter is an angularone that could be either g or h but is probably an 'aleph. The vertical stroke after it must bea z. The smudged sign at the end of the line could possibly be another 'aleph or the unit strokesometimes found after celebrants' names.Such a collocation of consonants, byPz' suggests the Late Avestan baJaaza, \"medicine,\"\"healing\"2 3 5 and, as byPz 1, 1 bi3az, \"physician.\"2 36 As in No. 17:3 and elsewhere, the cele-brant is called a plg, a divisional commander (myriarch) of 10,000 men.LINE 3After the verb cbd one expects the name of the vessel as the object of the verb. The firsttwo letters, sh- are clear and the r is split by the fracture that divides the base. The remainderof the word, on the other fragment that holds the rest of the line, is very faint and uncertain.The substance of the remainder of the line should be descriptive of the vessel or concernedwith the action of the verb. The space available and the traces of letters that remain suggestthe reading rcyn bg, which is certified by its occurrence on another plate (No. 52:3-4).The use of the letter 'aiyn in the word rcyn indicates that the word is Semitic. Suggestedat once is the word racy6n, which is found in both Aramaic and Hebrew texts. The root fromwhich it is formed (Arabic s--4), Aramaic rnyn, Hebrew rmr) signifies \"to take pleasurein (something)\" and \"to desire.\" From the contexts in which racy6n is found, it is clear thatits meaning involves \"striving\" or \"longing\" (Eccles. 1:17, 2:22, 4:16) and \"desire\" (Dan.2:29-30, 4:16, 5:6 and 10) as well as \"ambition\" and \"greed.\"237 It is related to the Biblicalre(a)c, \"purpose,\" \"aim\" (Ps. 139:2, 17). Professor J. Harmatta indicates that in Sogdianwriting the form rcyn occurs as an Aramaic logogram for the Persian word kdma, \"desire.\"The word bg, associated with the word r.yn, is apparently the Persian baga, which oftenmeans \"god\" but can also signify \"lot,\" \"fortunate lot,\" or even \"good fortune.\"238But what is the significance of the rcyn bg and how should it be read? From its position andthe fact that it occurs only on plates, one would expect that it would refer to the vessel, butthe two words form a context inappropriate as a characteristic of a plate. It might be readas \"a desire of god\" indicating that the gift had divine approval.It seems preferable, however, to regard it as a parenthetic comment indicating the purposeof the military officer in participating in the haoma rite. Like the Biblical racy6n ru(a)h, \"astriving after wind\" (Eccles. 1:17), this rcyn bg is \"a striving after good fortune\" or \"a desirefor good fortune.\" Thus, the general claims to have sought good fortune through participationin the haoma ceremony and the presentation of the vessel as a token of his experience.23 9236 BAiW, col. 914, bacEaza.236 Ibid., col. 967, bisaz (Aryan *bhisaz, \"physician\").237 Jastrow, Dictionary II 1487, 71'.1, N~1'.1.238 Kent, Old Persian, p. 199a, baga; BAiW, col. 921, baga, \"Herr,\" \"Gott,\" \"Anteil,\" \"Los,\" \"giinstiges Los,\" \"Gluick.\"'23See p. 50.118oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"LINE 5Although the first letter of the name of the sub-treasurer is obscure, it is probably an 'alephfor the name Arta-.

It is unlikely that there were other unit strokes at the end of the preceding line,which is broken, since the figure would not be separated when all of the last line was avail-able for it.Since there is no dated text prior to the seventh year of Xerxes and all lower year dates arein the reign of Artaxerxes I, it is probable that this text is from the first year of Artaxerxes I(464/63 B.C.). If the Mdzprn of line 2 is the segan Mzprn of No. 21:2, the date would be con-firmed, for Mzprn functioned as segan in the second year of Artaxerxes I.LINE 1The spelling srwk instead of srk is unique and significant. It has its parallel in the JewishWar Scroll from Qumran wherein the usual srk was once written as srwk and then altered tosdwr.253 Two witnesses to the spelling srwk thus suggest that the pronunciation was not\"serekh,\" as Yadin supposes, but something with the vowel o or u.The writing of sdr for srwk/srk may be instructive if, as seems likely, the words at Persepolisand Qumran are related. The Semitic root sdr has much in common with srk. It connotesorder, both spatial and sequential, especially in such matters as the arrangement of culticmaterials and the sequence of prayers and scriptural readings.254LINE 2The first word might be read as gytz, but its spacing suggests that it is gyt followed by theunit stroke that sometimes follows the name of a celebrant.

It is followed by a sign d or r and a vertical stroke to be read as z. The letterscrowded behind it, with no indication of word separation, are not the expected verb 9bd butthe familiar name element -prn, -farnah. The word is thus Mdzprn, evidently the proper nameof an official. It is probably the name Mazda-farnah with the metathesis of the z and d, aphonetic phenomenon also found elsewhere in these texts.257In their present position it would appear that Gyt would be the name of the segan andMdzprn that of the celebrant, since that is the usual order of occurrence in the normal for-mula. But the unit stroke marks Gyt as the celebrant and Mdzprn must be the official. In thenormal formula only the treasurers are mentioned after the celebrant, but the name Mdzprnresembles the name of the segan Mzprn, which also is a form of Mazda-farnah. Furthermore,the segan is seldom omitted from the text when officers are mentioned, even when abbrevia-tion means the dropping of the names of the treasurers.25 8 It is likely, therefore, that Mdzprnrepresents the segan in this text.LINE 3The essential verb 9bd, \"used,\" is omitted in this text, as in No. 137, and it must be suppliedto make sense.The word \"pestle,\" normally spelled 'bIwn, seems to be 'bsyn here.

The other (PT5 405) was recovered in the southern part of Room 38, justwest of the same doorway (HF 39).283DATEThe date is quite uncertain. Cameron copied only three strokes, at the very end of the lastline. Because of the dark band on which the figure is written, it is difficult to determine whatpreceded.Since it is probable that Araya(t)-vahui is the segan, the text was written during the reignof Artaxerxes I and well along in that reign, for Araya(t)-vahus served from the eleventh toat least the twenty-fourth year (454-440 B.C.).279 Eilers, in Abhandlungen fur die Kunde des Morgenlandes XXV, No. 5, p. 97, n. 3, [mmi]-in-[da-parl]-na-.280 Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch, pp. 368-69. 282 See p. 34.281 Manda(t)-, from man-, \"think\"; BAiW, cols. 1121 ff. 283 See p. 3.136oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"LINE 5After the reference to the plate in the fourth line and before the preposition lyd, at theend of the fifth line, there is additional text that includes a figure that is clearly visible.

The letter is doubtless the plural ter-mination of a masculine noun.

That text, appropriate for the location and space availablehere, is restored in the text above.LINE 6The restoration at the beginning of the line is based on the fact that after the lyd of thefifth line the name of the treasurer normally appears.

Its position in the text shows that it is a modifierof the object.Part of what remains suggests the 'hgynpyn that occurs elsewhere (Nos. 11:3, 101:2) pre-sumably as an indication of the color of the stone. But the spelling is not identical. The dam-aged letter at the edge of the break is apparently a 9 but the y of the other form is missinghere. What follows the s might be a w, but it is probably a relatively short n. Thus, the firstelement of the compound is perhaps 'h.n for 'h4yn, axtaina, \"dark colored.\"28 6 The second ele-ment, hwyn might be the objective xvaena, \"glowing,\"287 or, better, x'aini, \"beautiful.\"288Usually such an adjective modifies the noun \"stone\" in these texts. We thus expect zy gllbefore it. Since the name of the celebrant concludes line 2, the third line must also have in-cluded the verb 'bd and the name of the object.LINE 4The beginning of this line, too, must have continued the description of the object or thestone.

Assuch it is unique.Except for the last two letters, the reading of the name is certain. After the t Cameronread a w, with which he concluded the name. But that letter need not be a w and can be a y,like the one near the end of the third line. The final sign is copied by Cameron as a smudged,diagonal line which he disregarded in his translation. But the stroke must not be ignored.Since it runs at a sharp angle to the prominent bands in that area of the stone and com-pletely crosses a wide, light-colored band, it cannot be regarded as a natural line in the stone.It is too straight to be accidental and its width and density are identical with those of thestrokes used to form most of the other letters. It seems to be a purposeful stroke, the letter n,as at the end of the third line.The first element of the name seems to be 'rz, which suggests the Avestan araza, \"slaugh-ter.\"2 89 The second element, -rty, could represent -rdtay, \"offering.\"290 The terminal -n couldindicate the affix -na expressing adjectival actor.2 9' Like Vidarna it is possibly hypocoristicto a compound.292 Could the name be \"He who makes a slaughter offering\"?

The additional text must re-late to the segan. The reading is difficult because of the faded letters and the dark backgroundof the band in the stone on which the line was written. The fracture of the stone ends the lineafter the first few letters.Cameron copied and transliterated a clear b and r after the title, but there are traces ofseveral more letters before the break. The signs are difficult to read and uncertain, but theysuggest a g, an obscure mark that might be a y, and a letter m for a reading brgym. . . .Sincethe length of the line cannot be determined, it is impossible to conjecture the length of theword or what, if anything, followed it in the line.The letters br at first suggest a patronymic, for those letters can be read as \"son of\" andthere is a probable example of such usage in these texts.316 But there appears to be no spacebetween the letter r and what follows. Perhaps it is to be read as a place name, \"the seganin R. .... ,\" denoting the place in which the segan normally officiated. We might have ex-pected the word zy in the construction, as in the statement \"who is in Arachosia,\" whichsometimes follows the title of the treasurer.LINE 3The use of the letter 1 in the name of the celebrant indicates that it is not Persian. It couldrepresent such a name as the Kali listed by Justi.317 That name is possibly found also in oneof the Aramaic tablets from the fortification at Persepolis, from the time of Darius I.31 8 Thename is found also in the next text (No. 95:3).LINE 4Because the letters of the name of the sub-treasurer are faint and incomplete toward theend of the line, its reading is somewhat uncertain. Since carelessly written zd can look likethe letter h, Mah(a)-data might be a possible reading, for he served as sub-treasurer in thetenth year of Xerxes (476/75 B.c.) and in his eighteenth and nineteenth years (468-466 B.C.).But because Mah(a)-data is not found elsewhere with Baga-pata as treasurer, the nameMazda-data is restored here.Only the b of the name of the treasurer remains, but the title at the beginning of the nextline makes the restoration highly probable.316 See No. 33:3.817Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch, p. 153, KMli. *' Tablet 45, 1. 2.TEXTS151oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ARAMAIC RITUAL TEXTS FROM PERSEPOLIS95.

The same celebrant, Kali, is in No. 94,where the date is restricted between 476 and 453 B.C. by reference to the sub-treasurerMazda-data.LINE 2The length of the second and third lines and the plural verb indicate that, as in No. 88,two celebrants are mentioned in this text.After the h of the first name, the next two letters are blurred. The first is either d or r andthe second is a w or, much less likely, a letter p. The name is thus Hrwn or Hdwn.The second element of the name, -wn, is probably -wana/-vana, \"prevailing,\"32 0 which isencountered in other names in these texts.32 If the first element is hd, it suggests hada, \"al-ways,\"322 for Hada-vana, \"He who always prevails.\" If it be read as hr, it could possiblybe hdr-, \"protector,\" \"prince,'\"23 for a name Har-vana, \"Prevailing protector.\"LINE 3A title ('lp or pig) must have stood at the beginning of the line, following the name at theend of the line above and, since there were two celebrants, a conjunctive \"and\" must havepreceded the second name.At Teheran the text seemed to read kl 1, as in No. 94:3, but an enlarged photograph seemsto show traces of two vertical strokes after the name.

The name may also befound in the Aramaic fortification tablets from Persepolis from the time of Darius I.356 It isfound nowhere else in these texts as the name of a treasurer.Justi lists an Iranian Artasin,357 but Eilers prefers reading the name as Arta-canah or Arta-cinah, \"He whose longing is for Arta.\"3 58The two clear letters that follow the name and the trace of the preposition that precedes itindicate that the reference is to the treasurer.

It is followed by a long vertical line that might be the principal stroke of a letter t.

At thevery edge of the break Cameron's copy suggests a long, somewhat curved stroke which couldbe a k or p and with such a suggestion the dense discoloration at that point seems to takeon such a shape. It is followed by a smudged letter that looks somewhat like a b.

But if its vertical stroke is aslong as it appears to be in the photograph, it is probably a k. Whatever the reading, the placeof the word in the formula of the text suggests that it is a modifier of the vessel or of the stoneof which it is made.The following word, qdm, introduces the sub-treasurer and his title and the remainder of theline might also have had the preposition introducing the treasurer named in the next line.LINE 3The letters here are clearer than the others. Only the first letter of the place name hrhwty,\"Arachosia,\" is missing. Since the expression \"who is in Arachosia\" in these texts is only as-sociated with the treasurers, the name and title of the treasurer must have preceded it.The word 'Skr is clear and after it are traces of all three letters of the word Snt, \"year,\" butthe figure of the date that followed it is now gone.133.

Lack of title in this text might suggest that this pestle should be dated some-time before he became chiliarch. But omission of the title here should not be stressed, for suchdetails are frequently omitted on pestles where writing area is limited.LINE 2The reading of the name of the celebrant is probable, although the letter s is written simply,as a diagonal line.134.

Elsewhere in these texts Baga-pAta occurs only as the name of the treasurer. Both by its position and the use of the unitstroke the name is shown to be that of the celebrant here.As the forms of the letters show in Cameron's copy, there has been a transposition of theletters b and d in the spelling of the word cbd. Such an error is in keeping with the crude letterforms in this text and indicates lack of experience in writing Aramaic.LINE 3After the first two letters, Cameron's copy shows an unusually large space between the let-ters b and 9 and again between the X and the following w. This, too, seems to indicate an in-experienced writer. It results in crowding the last word of the line. The short vertical strokeat the end of the line is the z of the word znh. Because of crowding the n of the word is writtenabove the z as the last letter of the second line in such a way that it combines with the letter bof the verb to make that letter resemble a t.
