are still young, full of energy, and confident of being able to finish several major tasks in a few years time—but then find out that it takes the best part of their scholarly lives to finally bring to end even one of them.In this particular case, the project can be traced back to the fall of 1969, when my teacher Wolf-gang Röllig mentioned the Lamaštu corpus among other topics he thought I might want to look at while searching for a viable dissertation project. It soon became clear, however, that Franz Köcher was still officially working on these texts, and a new edition was thus not a suitable choice for a dis-sertation. But my interest in Lamaštu had been aroused, and in the years after 1970, I spent much of my “free” time reading these captivating incantations and rituals and collecting the pictorial material related to them. I also found time in London to collate all the published and unpublished Kuyunjik fragments I knew of, which resulted in a good number of joins not yet recognized by Köcher and their assignment to a definable set of exemplars. The plan to publish my results in a short article that was not to interfere with Köcher’s work, however, never came to fruition. Instead, some of my findings found their way into Rykle Borger’s Handbuch der Keilschriftliteratur. It must have been from there that Köcher heard about my interest in the corpus and, taking me by surprise, eventually ceded all his prior rights to me and asked me to take over and publish the full text edition, which he felt he would no longer have the time and energy to finish.Köcher’s offer brought new hope to the Assyriological community. As an example, Wolfram von Soden congratulated me, adding that now, for the first time in years, he believed that he would still live to see the much-needed new edition of the Lamaštu texts. I am deeply sorry that I disappointed him and many other colleagues who had hoped for a speedy publication. New finds in the British Museum, paired with my move to the New World, slowed down the work considerably, and the nag-ging devil of perfectionism did his destructive work as well. Finally, more than 44 years after my first encounter with the demon and the texts, 36 years after Köcher’s offer, and 34 years after my reloca-tion to Chicago, the deed is done, and the book is being published.Needless to say, such a long period of gestation makes it quite difficult to remember everybody who over more than four decades helped me to reconstruct and understand these texts. I enjoyed enormous help from institutions and individuals, from friends and colleagues, and from generations of students with whom I had the pleasure to read the Lamaštu texts over the years. The help came in the form of new identifications of texts and artifacts, permissions to study and publish these materi-als, individual improvements of my readings, bibliographical information, or simply by giving me the encouragement to continue my work or to go back to it after some lengthy breaks."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PrefacexiiCorporate acknowledgments go to the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes, which helped fi-nance several of my earlier stays at the British Museum; the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, for two stipends allowing me to copy many of the texts in London in 1976 and 1979; the American Philosophical Society, which in 1981 enabled me to work again in London, Istanbul, and Berlin; the National Endowment for the Humanities, for financial help and a travel grant to London during a sabbatical in 1994; and the Oriental Institute, for a special travel grant to Damascus in 1995. My thanks go to the following museums and collections and their respective staff for granting me per-mission to publish materials from their holdings and in most cases also for accommodating my work there: The British Museum, London, the Trustees represented by E. Sollberger†, C. B. F. Walker, and I. L. Finkel; the Vorderasiatische Museum zu Berlin, represented by L. Jakob-Rost, E. Klengel-Brandt, and J. Marzahn; the Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul, represented by V. Donbaz; the Babylo-nian Section of the University Museum, Philadelphia, represented by Å. Sjöberg, H. Behrens†, and S. Tinney; The National Museum, Damascus, represented by S. Muhesen; the Iraq Museum, Baghdad, represented by D. George Youkhanna†; the Yale Babylonian Collection, New Haven, represented by W. W. Hallo and U. Kasten; the collection of the Altorientalische Seminar Tübingen, represented by K. Volk; the Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose, CA; the collection of S. Moussaieff, London; and a private collection whose owner prefers to remain anonymous. I also want to thank the Mission de Ras Shamra, represented by M. Yon, and the Assur-Projekt of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, represented by J. Renger and S. Maul, for permission to publish texts under their tutelage.My deepest thanks go to individuals who informed me about new text identifications, often combined with the cession of their own earlier publication rights. F. Köcher†’s generous offer, which made the whole project possible, has already been mentioned. Foremost among the other friends to be given credit here is I. L. Finkel, whose contributions are almost countless. For identifications, pho-tos, or further information about individual texts and amulets, I am also indebted to (in alphabetical order) A. Berk, R. D. Biggs, J. Black†, E. Bleibtreu, R. Borger†, P. Calmeyer†, D. Collon, S. Dalley, M. Gallery-Kovacs, M. Geller, J. Goodnick Westenholz†, O. Gurney†, N. Heeßel, C. Hess, W. G. Lambert†, W. Meinhold, W. Röllig, S. Tinney, A. Tsukimoto, E. von Weiher, and D. Wiseman†.I will not even try to compile a complete list of all those colleagues who, over more than four decades, have discussed individual passages, phrases, or amulets with me, helping me to understand not only single words or lines but often also the major context of the incantations and rituals. The following few names (again in alphabetical order) of colleagues not yet mentioned above stand for all the unnamed others, to whom I want to cumulatively apologize for their omission: T. Abusch, M. Civil, K. Deller†, B. Foster, T. Frymer-Kensky†, E. Götting, S. Holloway, W. R. Mayer, E. Reiner†, M. Stol, F. A. M. Wiggermann, A. Winitzer, and I. Winter. Last, but by no means least, I want to thank all my students who read through parts or all of the Lamaštu corpus with me at one time or another. Again, the few names whose contributions I specifically recall stand for many others whose questions or answers in class also furthered my own understanding of the texts: S. Cole, T. Collins, S. Endy, J. Lauinger, A. Dix, and P. Gauthier.Jerry Cooper and Jim Eisenbraun had suggested years ago that I should consider writing my “Lamaštu” in English and aim to have it published in the series “Mesopotamian Civilizations.” I am very grateful for this offer and especially to Jerry for accepting the manuscript when it was finally finished. But the written versions of this book go back to the “good old days” of manual typewrit-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiiiPrefaceers, pass through the period of IBM Selectric and similar tools, and then show several stages of the development of word-processing technologies. The old fonts alone would have made it a nightmare for me to transpose and reformat the manuscript into Unicode, had it not been for the invaluable help of Jim Eisenbraun, who decided to act as my personal editor and then tended to every detail and accommodated every formatting wish I came up with. Before we reached that stage, I had already received invaluable help from Andrew Dix, who read through the whole manuscript several times, editing my English and at the same time correcting innumerable factual or philological mistakes and inconsistencies. His help in proofreading was also of great value, and the final quality of the printed product is largely due to the efforts of Jim and Andrew.To all of those whose contributions I may have forgotten to mention (and I am sure there will be many), I again give my collective heartfelt thanks.The scholarly environment in which this work grew and finally came to fruition was provided by the Altorientalische Seminar of the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen, the Institut für As-syriologie und Hethitologie of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, and by the Oriental Institute at The University of Chicago.

Yet, she has never been the subject of a scholarly monograph dedicated to the textual and visual evidence about her, her activities, and the measures the ancient magical specialists took to counter her. 1 The volume at hand also falls short of this description, since it covers only one part of the material: it is an edition of the textual record only, which is, however, collected here as com-pletely as seems possible today. My strong desire to see at least this text edition finally in print, a proj-ect that has been considered overdue for decades by many colleagues, prompted me some years ago to abandon my earlier plans for an overarching monograph about Lamaštu, and to concentrate on the presentation of the philological record. The task to put all the details now known about Lamaštu from the written sources together, combine them with old and new data from the pictorial record, connect them into a picture that can stand up to the methodological rigor of other disciplines like Comparative Religion, Art History, or History of Literature, and thus produce the much desired real monograph on Lamaštu, was more than I felt I could still accomplish. I do not know whether I should blame my partial mental burnout on Lamaštu herself, who might have taken revenge after I already had misrepresented her persona in many different publications. The task now has to be taken over by some younger colleague with a fresh outlook on the material, not obscured by a much too long period of exposure to Lamaštu’s demonic aura.Most of Lamaštu’s features and misdeeds have been at least briefly described elsewhere. By far the most complete dossier covering her background, her evil personality (including some redeem-ing aspects), and her place in the demonology of ancient Mesopotamia and its surrounding areas, as well as the written and pictorial records pertaining to her, has been compiled by Frans Wiggermann in his essay “Lamaštu, Daughter of Anu. A Profile” (= Wiggermann 2000). Much shorter, but at the same time less interpretive and therefore also occasionally less speculative, is my own resumé of the magico-medical, literary, and art-historical aspects of the corpus dealing with her, in the Real-lexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archäologie under the simple heading “Lamaštu” (= Far-ber 1983). A long overdue study of the Lamaštu amulets was recently made by Eva Götting in her M.A. thesis (= Götting 2009); unfortunately, only an excerpt that contains a rough typology of the amulets, describes the spread of these artifacts outside of Mesopotamia and to the Mediterranean 1.

Most other recent authors of biblical or ancient Near Eastern handbooks, topical encyclopedias, wiki-pedias, etc., when talking about Lamaštu have derived their statements more or less directly from Wiggermann 2000 and Farber 1987. For the benefit of those readers who have no easy access to these publications, I repeat some of the most important features described there. This should provide at least a basic background for the un-derstanding of the texts edited here. As a very short dossier of facts about Lamaštu, it could also be useful for recognizing her or her likes in other contexts or cultures. Figuratively speaking, this brief introduction could thus be used as a basic tool to assist in her detection and deterrence. As such, it neither preempts nor replaces the com-plete “Lamaštu Biography and Handbook” that remains to be written.Already in Sumerian texts from the 3rd mil-lennium b.c., a female spirit named Dimme 2 was mentioned as one of a group of seven similar de-mons, without specific individual traits or fea-tures. 3 In Sumerian and bilingual texts of a later date, she became the leading lady in a triad with two other demons whose Sumerian names shared the element *d i m m e (dd ì m . m e .A and ddìm.m e .ḪAB) with hers. 4 In the Akkadian versions of these texts, dd ì m . m e is called Lamaštu, which sounds like an Akkadian name but is still of unclear etymology; 5 the other two were known under the names of Labāṣu 6 and Aḫḫāzu. 7 Only in the 2nd millennium, and probably under the influence of the Semitic speakers of Akkadian, did Lamaštu gain in individuality and swiftly become the most 2.

Already in one of the oldest surviving spells against her (“OA1” 8), we learn that as a misbegotten daughter of the chief god of the Babylonian pantheon, Anum, and thus of unquestionable divine ancestry, she was thrown out of heaven and down to earth, either as a punishment for her previous evil deeds, or as a divine trick to control overpopulation in the future. 9 Her main goal on earth was to snatch and eat newly-born babies, which she accom-plished either by trickery, posing as a midwife or a physician, or by sheer force, attacking her victims like a wolf or a lion. Naming all these bloodthirsty activities and cruel attacks makes up much of the Akkadian incantations against her, and the vividness of these descriptions has made the corpus fa-mous well beyond the inner circle of Assyriologists. But she is not only a danger to babies and, inher-ently, their pregnant mothers before and during birth. Her destructive aura and scorching personality also affect adult men, old people, and even domestic animals. 10 At the same time, she is much more than just a cause or agent bringing about one or more definable diseases. 11 She is an almost satanic force, a personification of evil and aggressiveness.Her favorite hang-outs and preferred company make her quite undesirable for most civilized humans, but also not always easy to spot before she becomes dangerous. She usually emerges from far-away mountains, swamps, thickets, or the desert. There, she lives in close contact with wild ani-mals. 12 When we get a visual glimpse of her and her activities on amulets or in descriptions thereof, she is often associated with unclean animals like pigs and dogs whom she suckles at her breast. Quite often she holds snakes in her hands, and scorpions or poisonous centipedes 13 populate the back-ground. At the same time, she seems to have become somewhat accustomed to the basic features of human life, as shown by her means of transportation (usually a donkey and a boat on which she is supposed to leave the civilized parts of the world), and by the gifts she gets when people are trying to send her away, which include toiletries and feminine accessories, pins, fibulas, shoes, pots and pans, and carpets. 14Her own appearance is also terrifying. In the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia, nobody seems to have known exactly what her head looked like, so pictures and textual descriptions vary between those of dogs or lions, 15 and of birds-of-prey. 16 Occasionally, she is even shown with two heads, like below in fig. 2. At that time, however, the main emphasis seems to have lain on her deadly claws 8. In references to Lamaštu texts edited in this book, the sigla introduced on pp. 45ff. are used.

I have to repeat here that there is a clear zoological difference between centipedes (Chilopoda) and millipedes (Myriapoda). Unfortunately, the editors of the Reallexikon at the time changed the wording of my manuscript for Farber 1987 from “Hundertfüßler” to “ Tausendfüßler,” and since then millipedes or “ Tausendfüßler” have wrongly been accused to be associated with Lamaštu; see most recently Götting 2011: 440.14.

A variant of this type has her holding the pig and dog in her hands (see, for example, figs. 13 and 23). In the boat scene, her ankle is usually tied to a tree at the water’s edge, and the background of the scene is filled with further accessories of civilization, but also with harmful animals like scorpi-ons and centipedes. As a slightly unusual feature, some of these very elaborate amulets add another demon, Pazuzu, to the scene, who peeks from the reverse over the top of the amulet like Kilroy (for examples, see figs. 1 + 5 and 18), thus forming something like a handle to the piece, where the older and less elaborate amulets used to have a simple protrusion with a hole drilled through for suspen-sion. Pazuzu himself is an ambiguous demonic figure whose powers, at least in this context, could also be harnessed to help in the expulsion of the much more dangerous Lamaštu. 21Whether the aforementioned features would be enough to recognize Lamaštu before she could attack, I do not know, but they should at least be sufficient to make a positive identification if she is caught in flagranti. They thus could serve as the basis for a search warrant and a “Wanted” poster (see fig. 6, p. 6).17. Wiggermann 2000: 231–33.18. Götting 2011: “ Typ I: Drohende Lamaštu.”19.

I hope that this new edition of Lamaštu texts will raise the level of alertness for her nefarious deeds, although this can no longer be expected to have a major impact on the health of future generations of mothers and babies. Fortunately, the advancements of scientific medicine have long taken over where magico-religious methods left off in the distant past. At the same time, we have a major advantage over the people who originally composed, wrote down, and recited these texts to ward off a demon of the utmost destructive power: we can now read the incantations collected in this edition simply as literature, without having to worry that a single minor misunderstanding of the text could jeopardize the magical effectiveness of the whole ritual cure. In other words, we can enjoy the liveliness and appreciate the poetic workmanship of this unusually rich corpus of magical texts at the same time that we continue trying to define its place in the magico-medico-religious thought and practice of ancient Mesopotamia.

At some point, her father and mother are said to have thrown her out of Heaven and down to Earth (see “OA2” 12, “Lam. I” 112, etc.), but we do not know exactly when this was supposed to have happened and when her story made its first appearance in Mesopotamian mythology. Even though some traits of her demonic character may then have been known already for quite some time, possibly under other names, only this pedigree and expulsion made her the demoness we now know so well. All this may have hap-pened relatively late and may in turn explain the fact that Lamaštu has not been identified yet as an independent demonic agent in incantations of the 3rd millennium b.c. 1 As of this writing, the oldest known texts that were specifically composed to protect humanity against her evil deeds date to the OB and OA periods. At and shortly after that time, a fair number of individual incantations against Lamaštu were written down, both in Sumerian and Akkadian. While all Akkadian texts that can safely be identified as Lamaštu incantations have been edited below in Parts I and II, I decided early on that Sumerian incantations should only be incorporated into this edition if they showed a direct relationship to known SB texts and specifically to incantations nos. 10 and 13 of the canoni-cal series, which are in Sumerian. Although no such texts have actually been identified to date, it turns out that there is one example of a survival of OB Sumerian material into the SB series, TIM 9, 63: 17′–23′ // OECT 5, 55. This passage provides a distant Sumerian parallel to the Akkadian text Author’s note: In this edition, all references to lines of the canonical Lamaštu Series, as reconstructed here, will be quoted as “Lam. I,” “Lam. II,” and “Lam. III” (always in double quotation marks). Individual exemplars that have been edited as fully integrated duplicates to the series (see sections 1.1. and 1.2.1. of the list of Manuscript Sources on pp. 45–48) will be quoted by their sigla. Independent parallels (section 1.2.2., pp. 48–50), as well as all noncanonical Lamaštu texts (sections 2.1.–2.3. and 3., pp. 50–52) will be quoted by their abbreviated names (e.g., “Bo,” “OB5,” or “SpTU”). In context, these abbreviated names are always enclosed in quotation marks, to make it easier to keep them apart from the sigla used for duplicate exemplars, but they are used without quotation marks in the text edition proper (transliteration, transcription, translation), where such a differentiation is not needed. For an alphabetical list of all abbreviated names, see Table IV on p. 66.1.

This is a clay amulet in the shape of a barrel cylinder, of uncertain date but found in a Persian grave at Ugarit and inscribed with a duplicate to the SB Sumerian text of STT 144, 1– 4. It is edited in Part II under text “STT 144” as exemplar b.Akkadian Lamaštu Texts from the OA and OB PeriodsAkkadian Lamaštu incantations from the first half of the 2nd millennium are relatively numer-ous, with a total of eight such spells (“OB1–6” and “OA1–2”) identified to date. All of these are found on single-column tablets, in most cases containing just one incantation (“OB1”, “OB2,” and probably “OB4,” “OA1,” and “OA2”). The short Akkadian spell “OB6” is a postscript on the left edge of a tab-let that otherwise contains Sumerian incantations, at least some of which were also directed against Lamaštu (TIM 9, 63; see above). “OB3“ and “OB5” are short Lamaštu incantations written on tablets the remainders of which contain other magical texts not directed against Lamaštu.Unfortunately, the provenience of most of the OB tablets is unknown, since they were originally acquired from different dealers at different times (“OB1–3” and “OB5,” Yale) or confiscated by Iraqi authorities (“OB6”). Only one tablet (“OB4”) has a reliable pedigree and is known to have come from Nippur. The script and shape of the unprovenienced tablets do not suggest a common area of origin. Of the two OA texts, “OA1” was excavated at Kültepe in 1994, and it is safe to assume that “OA2” also came from there before it was acquired by Yale from the antiquities market. Although not strictly provable, it thus seems reasonable to assume that in OB and OA times Lamaštu spells were widely utilized wherever Akkadian and Sumerian texts were used for magic, and there is no in-dication in the textual record 9 that belief in Lamaštu was not rooted in Mesopotamian culture itself. Occasional references in the texts to Lamaštu as a dangerous foreigner—i.e., as an Elamite, Sutaean, 2. I believe that the passage in question, TIM 9, 63 “obv.” 17′–23′, constitutes a complete incantation and must be separated from “rev.” 24′– 45′. The rubric line *k a . i n i m . m a dd ì m . m e could have been lost on the lower edge of the tablet (separation lines might not have been deemed necessary there), or “obv.” and “rev.” may have to be exchanged. According to Michalowski (1978: 345), this Sumerian incantation might actually be a translation from a still unrecovered OB Akkadian version of “Lam. I” 1–8.3. All of TIM 9, 63 was edited and commented by Tonietti (1979: 301–23). Whether “rev.” 24′– 45′ (see previous note) are also related to Lamaštu remains uncertain. Surprisingly, this interesting text does not seem to have elicited much attention since. For a few quotations and parallels, see Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 1994: 74.4. See Tonietti 1979: 309 and Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 1994: 74.5. Mention should also be made of the entry dd ì m . m e a n . e d e n . n a m ú . d a in the OB catalogue of incantation incipits, Wilcke 1973: pl. 3 “JRL Box 25 E5/25” line 8, quoting still another unknown Sumerian Lamaštu incantation (cf. also ibid., line 9 for an incantation starting dudug ddìm.me u4.ḫuš kalam.ma ri).6.

I refrain here from making similar statements about the archaeological record, since a comprehensive study of Lamaštu amulets and their stylistic development in the context of Mesopotamian and neighboring art has yet to be written and remains a major desideratum. For the time being, see Götting 2011."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"9The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History or Amorite woman—in my opinion reinforce this impression and are easier to explain from within Mesopotamian social and magico-religious beliefs than if her figure and character had actually been borrowed or imported from some neighboring cultures.An interesting feature of “OB5” is the inclusion of Akkadian agenda, or ritual instructions, on the tablet. These are introduced by the phrase kikiṭṭaša “its ritual.” Although by no means unique, this is still rather uncommon for OB incantations. For examples, see the references collected by Gertrud Farber (1984: 313 with n. 10). A few other texts also add agenda to the incantation but lack the catch-word kikiṭṭaša: see, for instance, Nougayrol RA 66, 141ff.: AO 6782; YOS 11, 15 rev. 17ff.; and YOS 11, 4 obv. 3ff. Finally, a few incantation texts that seem to intersperse the recitanda with occasional agenda should also be mentioned here—e.g., Wilcke ZA 75, 198: IB 1554 obv. 23, or YOS 11, 12 rev. 31–37.While most of these earlier Lamaštu incantations in some way or other refer to myths and motifs known to us also from the 1st-millennium texts, or use descriptions, similes, and phraseology similar to these, two of them (“OA1” and “OB1”) are actually close enough to the later material to qualify as “earlier versions” 10 of the third incantation of the canonical series (“Lam. I” 37– 45). They are thus the oldest known links in a chain of tradition that for us becomes visible only in the OB period, when such spells—which probably had been transmitted orally until then—were first written down, and then continues through early attemps at collecting and editing the genre in MB times; the establish-ing of the wording of the individual spells early in the first millennium; the addition of a ritual tablet and at the same time the use of many Lamaštu spells in other magico-medical contexts also in the first millennium; and ultimately the standardization of the text and even of the spelling in the 3-pirsū version of Aššurbanipal’s library in Nineveh. This text edition is not the place to treat this story comprehensively, since doing so would delay the publication of the text corpus even more. The task should probably be tackled by a fresh mind not worn out by more than 40 years of Lamaštu’s demonic presence. Many philological details that may, I hope, have a bearing on the problem, can, however, be found in the philological commentary on the relevant texts and passages.Lamaštu Texts from the MB PeriodBetween the end of the OB period and the time of the MA libraries at Assur, 11 magical texts from Mesopotamia are quite scarce. This is probably due to the haphazard results of excavations and chance finds, since we have reason to assume that the Kassite period was altogether quite produc-tive for literary and religious texts, although it is often hard to define which versions or new texts were actually composed during the period. 12 In this respect, it is very fortunate that we have at least one early MB text from Babylonia that shows how close to the SB series the wording of Inc. 12 had already come around the middle of the 2nd millennium. The text in question, which in my edition bears the name “MB,” 13 was originally deemed OB by both I. L. Finkel, who was the first to identify it as a Lamaštu text, and me, but closer scrutiny of its epigraphic and linguistic features now leads me 10. For my preference of this term over the often used “forerunner,” see Farber 1993: 95–97.11. See Pedersén 1985: 29ff. (ca. 12th/11th centuries).12. For a succinct statement of the problems involved, see Foster 1993: 203ff.13.

The im-portance of this text is heightened by the fact that we have still another MB version of this incanta-tion, which is part of the collection of Lamaštu spells from Ugarit originally published by Nougayrol (1968) and reedited here under the name “Ug.” The passage that runs parallel to “MB” and Inc. 12 of the “Lam.” series is found there in col. V 30′–31′ and col. VI 1′–19′. The two MB versions, although not identical to the last detail, are strikingly similar and share some interesting features, like the ad-dition of lines “MB” I 27 // “Ug” VI 3′ and “MB” II 18 // “Ug” VI 18′, which are not present in the SB version.The importance of the Ugarit version (“Ug”) of the Lamaštu incantations for the history of magi-cal texts in the second half of the 2nd millennium has been clear ever since its first publication by Nougayrol (1968: 393– 408). Written in quite good Babylonian script, but showing a few insecuri-ties with individual signs and a number of mistakes and misunderstandings of the Akkadian text, it seems likely to me that this text is the work of an advanced local scribe or scholar well versed but not natively fluent in Babylonian. 15 For the much more fascinating question, whether this scribe should also be credited with collecting and assembling all(?) Lamaštu incantations known to him, thus creating the oldest real Lamaštu corpus that has come down to us, I have no definitive answer. In the context of the other Akkadian texts from Ugarit, I think it more likely that our Ugaritic scholar copied someone else’s compilation, but where could such a tablet have come from? Arnaud (2007: 62) argues that a second, physically unrelated Lamaštu piece from Ugarit (RS 25.513, named “RS” in my edition) is actually an import from Hattuša. Since this fragment is the upper left corner of col. I of a multicolumn tablet, and since the beginning of “Ug” col. I is lost, 16 one could speculate that “RS” actually is the only remnant of the otherwise lost original behind “Ug.” 17 Arnaud’s hypothesis, which is part of a larger theory of supposed imports into Ugarit from several other places, not only contradicts Nougayrol’s statement (Nougayrol 1968: 405 n. 93) that basically all Akkadian textes de tradition found in Ugarit 18 were also written there but would at the same time simply shift my initial question to Boghazköy: from where would the Hittites have gotten such a compilation, and why do we not have any remnants of a similar Lamaštu compendium from Boghazköy?14. The text was still translated by me as “altbabylonisch” in Farber, Kümmel, and Römer 1987: 257ff. (see also Farber 1983: 440a). It is quoted as “OB” by Wiggermann (2000: 217ff. passim); Wassermann (2003; for individual quotations, see index p. 227); and Cunningham (1997: 153 no. 362).

If this were the case, however, we would have to assume that the “Ug” parallel of Inc. 5 was much shorter than the later version in order to make space for another short spell at the beginning of the tablet. For further details, see my reconstruction of “Ug” below, with fig. 7.18. Note that this obviously only covers texts excavated before his publication of the Lamaštu fragments—i.e., before 1969. The material has increased and the interpretation has changed significantly since then (see Arnaud 2007: 7–11)."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"11The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History Fig. 7.

Beyond these parallels to Incs. 3 and 12 which bridge the gap between older Mesopotamian texts and the standard versions of the first millennium, “Ug” also contains the earliest known versions of Incs. 5 (col.

For this reconstruction, I assume that each column originally contained roughly 60 lines of text and that about the same amount of text is missing at the top and at the bottom of the original tablet. These estimates are certainly very rough but are not completely arbitrary, since they are consistent with the calculable gaps in Incs. 5 and 12 that give us some indication of the overall length of the breaks. Note, however, that the space allotted to Inc. 12 is a bit more than might have been expected from the parallels, with room for about 30 lines in “Ug,” compared to 22 lines in “MB” and no more than 17 in “Lam. II.” It is thus not completely impossible that “Ug” V 30′–31′, instead of giving the incipit line of Inc. 12, actually represents the beginning of another very short spell that could, however, have hardly been longer than 8–10 lines.

III and still another spell of about the same length at the end of col. VI. 20Mention has already been made of RS 25.513 (named “RS” in my edition), another fragment from Ugarit that is, however, written in quite a different hand and cannot be part of the same original tablet as “Ug.” Arnaud (2007: 11 and 62) considers this fragment to be an import from Boghazköy. His statement “il fournit le commencement d’un texte dont [“Ug”] fournit la suite” (2007: 62) is not quite unequivocal: does he suggest that we suppose a “series” of Lamaštu tablets at Ugarit, of which “RS” would be the first tablet and “Ug” the second? Or does he also consider the possibility that “RS” is actually the beginning of a tablet that served as the original for the copy now preserved as “Ug” and thus contained the same text as the latter? In any case, since the text preserved on “RS” does not really qualify as an “earlier version” of any of the known SB Lamaštu incantations (in spite of some similarities with the beginning of Inc. 7), its place in the development of the corpus cannot be viewed as certain.Whether or not “RS” originally was written in Hattuša, there is actually one fragmentary tablet excavated at Boghazköy that might belong to the Lamaštu corpus, KUB 37, 66 (edited here under the name “Bo”). This text has often been quoted as part of a group of fragments that at one time or another were all thought to be Lamaštu rituals or at least to contain Lamaštu material. 21 Of these, it is the only one that actually contains instructions that are close enough to other Lamaštu rituals to make such an identification plausible. Some doubt is, however, still possible, since Lamaštu herself seems to be referred to in this text as *Lamas(sa)tu (see below, commentary to “Bo” 3), leaving open the possibility of further misunderstandings by the Hittite scribes. The text has been collated and joins have been attempted by R. D. Biggs and G. Wilhelm, who both concluded that it is not part of the same tablet as KUB 37, 61+. 22 Biggs did, however, consider the possibility that nos. 65, 66, and 67 are three unjoinable fragments of one and the same tablet. Of these, no. 67 has now been joined by Wilhelm to KUB 37, 105+, 23 while nos. 65 and 66 are still separate. 24 Since none of the other fragments show any close resemblance to Lamaštu rituals, I assume here that if KUB 37, 66 is actually an indirect join to Schwemer’s “Handschrift B,” this ritual compendium must have contained very diverse material and that KUB 37, 66 would be the only surviving fragment that may preserve text of a portion dealing with Lamaštu. Aside from Arnaud’s speculations about “RS” (see above), fragment 19. Note also that the individual length of the spells on “Ug,” compared to the SB versions, can vary considerably, as does the use of line indentation on “Ug.” Both of these factors add to the uncertainty of my reconstruction of the spatial distribution of text on the physical tablet. Note also that, although the columns of the reverse of “Ug” are slightly wider than those of the obverse, I have assumed the same number of lines on both sides of the tablet.20. It is, of course, also possible that this final space was either left blank or contained a colophon-like note or even a ritual, although neither of these options seems to have parallels in comparable texts from Ugarit.21. See, for instance, Nougayrol 1968: 405 with n. 91, and compare Borger 1975: 134 under KUB 37, 61+. For most of the fragments and a few new identifications and joins, see now KBo 36, 29 and the edition of all related texts by Schwemer (1998). KUB 37, 66 is edited there as “Fragment X5” on pp. 134–36.22. As assumed in Borger 1975: 134 (see now Schwemer 1998: 80f.: “Handschrift A”).23. See Schwemer 1998: 81: “Handschrift B.”24.

Seal Impression on “Emar” (1981 composite drawing by D. Collon, reproduced here with her friendly permission).“Bo” thus constitutes the only indication to date that any Lamaštu incantations might have formed part of the magico-medical corpus that reached the Hittite capital from Mesopotamia. In view of the existence of similar material from Ugarit and Emar, such a textual presence would not be unexpected, although the evidence is still too doubtful to constitute definitive proof.Although the MB texts from Babylonia, Ugarit, and possibly Boghazköy provide extraordinary evidence for the development and growth of individual incantations and the corpus as a whole, a unique and most intriguing Lamaštu text from this period is a clay tablet in the shape of an amulet that is edited here under the name “Emar.” It was bought by its present owner in 1981, at a time when many tablets from the vicinity of Meskene (ancient Emar) surfaced on the antiquities market, and the dealer actually specified its provenience as “Emar.” This amulet tablet formed part of a group of mainly legal and economic tablets that can be prosopographically linked to other texts excavated at Meskene. This lot also contained a tablet of liver omens. 25 It is therefore reasonable to assume that the whole assemblage originated in or near Emar, although unfortunately the exact provenience and date of the individual pieces remain unknown. Our text can be compared to other amulet-shaped clay tablets like the ones discussed by Reiner (1960: 148–55), with a pierced handle that served to suspend it, most probably in the bedroom of the pregnant women to give her the much-needed pro-tection from Lamaštu. In spite of its amulet shape, and presumably at least temporary use as a magical artifact, I have classified it with the other MB clay tablets since it does not show any pictorial scenes but instead contains the continuous text of three Lamaštu incantations. Its material (clay, not stone or metal) also defines it, I think, primarily as a text-bearing document with potential use as an amu-let, rather than a physical-metaphysical tool for a given magical purpose. This differentiation may, however, be very anachronistic, especially since the arrangement of the text itself clearly follows a magical principle: the three incantations, separated by appropriate rubric lines t u6.ú.ni.nu.ru, are subdivided into sections with horizontal blank bands in between, with each spell comprising two sections of exactly seven lines each, to which the third one adds a section of three extra lines on the reverse of the handle, to reach the magical number of seven sections altogether. Probably to further enhance its magical powers, the tablet was then (after the text had been written) sealed along the four edges, including the sides of the handle, in all the horizontal blank bands, vertically from the tip of the handle through the middle to the bottom of both obverse and reverse, and crosswise again over both obverse and reverse, using only one seal of local style (see fig. 9).The horizontal impressions all follow the direction of the script, with the bottom of the sealing pointing to the end of the obverse or reverse, respectively. Around the edges, the bottom of the seal 25. See the publication of the group by Dalley and Teissier 1992: 83–111. The amulet (no. 8) was published, in photograph only, on pl.

The vertical impressions also change direction between the obverse, where its bottom points to the right, and the reverse, where it points to the left. I was unable to ascertain the direction of the sealings on the very superficial diagonal impressions. As if to underline their existence and importance, the scribe has secondarily highlighted these and the vertical impressions by “framing” them with his stylus, giving them the appearance of railway tracks. In view of all these variations in application, I assume that, although the existence of all these seal-ings was of great magical importance, their individual layout and orientation was not.Besides its unique physical features, the Emar tablet abounds with philological difficulties. Dif-ferent from any other “earlier version,” this text seems to be an assemblage of more-or-less discon-nected words and phrases, many but by no means all of which can be traced to contemporary or later Akkadian incantations. A few of these are unique to or at least very typical for the Lamaštu corpus. This, together with the mention of mārat Anim in line 1, provides for the safe identification of our text as “Lamaštu incantations.” To make things worse, the script of the tablet is very bad, full of defi-cient signs or extra wedges often to the point that it is impossible to decide what cuneiform sign was intended, unless a usable parallel phrase comes to mind. The scribe furthermore used many obscure phonetic values, most but not all of which are also occasionally found in other Akkadian texts from the Western periphery. At the same time, he was not familiar with mainstream use of, for instance, determinatives and phonetic complements. As a very individualistic feature, he often extends his text all the way to the right margin, and if he ends up with incomplete words, he repeats them at the beginning of the next line without erasing his first attempts. And, finally, his grasp of Akkadian is insufficient to protect him from grammatical and lexical misunderstandings and mistakes. The result is what I unhesitatingly call the most difficult Akkadian text of reasonable preservation that I have ever tried to read and understand. 26 In fact, the text is so difficult that I cannot even be sure that its three incantations are more than mumbo-jumbo-like medleys based on Akkadian phrases, which seem to lack any associative or narrative thread to hold them together. In other words, I love this text. 27It is difficult to place this text correctly in a reconstruction of the development of the Lamaštu corpus in MB times, given the lack of direct textual parallels. But even so, it is highly important for our knowledge of the Lamaštu tradition in the West, since it shows unequivocally that much of the pertinent phraseology was known to the Emar scribe (or author?) at the time, even though no fixed versions of three usable individual incantations of exactly the right size—remember the restriction to two × seven lines for each of them—seem to have been at hand. As things stand, and with-out the discovery of some library texts with Lamaštu incantations from Emar like the one we have from Ugarit, it will remain very difficult, if not impossible, to trace the diffuse material of the three 26. In some respects, this text is comparable to the infamous incantation texts from Alalaḫ (Wiseman AT nos. 448–50), where the fragmentary state of the tablets and the inadequacy of the copies have further added to the difficulties of the text (see, for instance, Farber 1990: 309f.). 27. With all the physical and textual idiosyncrasies of this tablet, the question of a possible forgery might come to mind. I categorically reject this idea, since I am convinced that no one in this world—specialist or nonspecialist, not even I myself—could have come up with a forgery so refined in its mixture of known and unknown, expected and unexpected, or understandable and not understandable."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition16incantations to individual sources and thus to find ways to put this unique amulet-shaped tablet into its right place within the textual tradition of the Lamaštu corpus.On the other hand, this text prompts me to make a remark on the role of the Ugarit and Emar texts in a broader religious and cultural context. The Lamaštu texts found at Ras Shamra are so closely related to Mesopotamian traditions and beliefs that it is hard to imagine how they could have been used at Ugarit in a local religious environment, where they probably would have seemed exotic and alien. If not only copied for educational or scholarly reasons (as is not unlikely for much of the Boghazköy Akkadian ritual texts), their practical use would most likely have been restricted to a Mesopotamian-oriented religious enclave or diaspora situation, which we do not know to have ex-isted. On the other hand, the “Emar” tablet seems to be an indigenous product of magical literature, based upon but freely reorganizing and rewriting textual material of Mesopotamian origin into a new, and newly structured, set of spells. The arrangement of the written text on the tablet, as well as its sealing, are also features not otherwise known to me from Babylonia or Assyria, while the amulet shape of the tablet has good Mesopotamian parallels. I think this is exactly the type of document, hybrid in form and contents, that one can expect as the result of secondary assimilation of foreign (in this case: Mesopotamian) motifs into a local culture and its written output. This textual artifact could hardly have been used in the setting of a traditional Mesopotamian Lamaštu ritual but was presumably made for the magico-religious conditions of Emar at the time. It is also possible that there is still a lot of non-Mesopotamian material hidden in the passages of the text that I could not understand. I thus see “Emar” as an outstanding example of magico-religious transcultural amalgama-tion. As such, it could eventually play a major role in discussions of how Mesopotamian culture and religion influenced and changed the perception of indigenous rites and features of “peripheral” areas and vice versa.Lamaštu Texts in the First Millennium b.c.The Canonical Lamaštu SeriesAn Early Canonical Version in the 13th Century?From the MB period to the beginning of the first millennium, we do not have independently dateable Lamaštu texts. The only possible exception might be VAT 10353, an excerpt tablet that, among other texts, contained a Lamaštu incantation accompanied by ritual instructions; it is used in the reconstruction of the series as exemplar Ee. This tablet, reportedly from Assur but in Babylonian script, 28 was originally classified by Heeßel as NB, a date that would pose no problems for the fact that it contains a major excerpt from the “Lam.” Series (// “Lam. I” 44–61), covering an incantation and its appropriate ritual in a wording that exacly mirrors the SB version of the text. Heeßel, in a later private communication, informs me, however, that the vast majority of Babylonian tablets found in Assur should actually be dated to the MB era, probably comprising spoils from Tukulti-Ninurta’s war against Babylon, 29 and that hardly any Babylonian tablets from Assur are safely dateable to the first 28. According to Nils Heeßel, to whom I owe detailed knowledge of the piece, its photograph numbers are M 2464–2465, but no excavation or Ass.-Photo numbers are given.29.

If our exemplar Ee were actually part of this booty from Babylon, as an MB excerpt from the series, especially one accompanied by ritual instructions that exactly duplicate the standardized later version, it would obviously presuppose the existence of this “canonical version” already in the 13th century in Babylonia. As long as there is no other evidence, primary or secondary, for such an early version of “Lam.” with standardized incantations and rituals, I prefer to assume that our text Ee is actually NB (a date that is also easiest to reconcile with its ductus) and that it is either not from Assur but got numbered with the Assur material by mistake, or that we actually do have to accept the rare case of a stray NB tablet from this site.Different Recensions in the First MillenniumWhen we can pick up the thread of Lamaštu incantations again in the first millennium, the text of 13 Lamaštu incantations and their rituals has been standardized throughout Assyria and Babylonia into a “canonical version,” which, however, has come down to us in at least two different redactional recensions. Following the ancient designations of their sections, I have called one of them the “pirsu recension,” and the other the “ṭuppu recension.” For a detailed discussion of the differences between them, and their respective place in the history of the Lamaštu texts, see below. A schematic juxtapo-sition of these two recensions can be found in fig. 10, which I reproduce here with a few adjustments from Farber 2012b: 229 fig. 1.While the two recensions contain exactly the same text for all the incantations and for most of the rituals, it should be noted that Rituals 7 and 8 differ slightly between them, which accounts for the different number of lines assigned to these sections in the table. It should also be noted that in both versions Rituals 2 and 6 consist of two parts each that are separated by a rubric line. I refer to these as Ritual 2a or 2b and Ritual 6a or 6b, respectively. The Ritual Tablet, which was of less inter-est in the context of the article mentioned above and therefore described only summarily, can be subdivided into five major sections, plus a short conclusion. The sections are:(a) the “Dog Figurines Ritual” (“Lam. III” 1–28/29),(b) the “Stones Ritual” (“Lam. III” 30–63), 30(c) the “Salves and Fumigations” (“Lam. III” 64–75), 31(d) the “Rubbing” (“Lam. III” 76–109), 32(e) the “7-Day Ritual” (“Lam. III” 110–35), and(f) the “Epilogue” (“Lam. III” 136–38, but not completely preserved)The ṭuppu Recension (Assur and Babylonia)Probably the oldest of these various arrangements, at least as far as the existing exemplars are concerned, is what I call the “ṭuppu recension.” Here the three main chapters of the compendium were named ṭuppū “tablets.” 33 In this arrangement, Incs. 1– 4, 6, and 8–13, each followed by their 30.

The only extant copy of this version in Assyrian script comes from Assur (exemplar m 35 in my edition; “ Tablet II”). Babylonian copies that belong to this recension come from Babylon (exemplars a: “ Tablet I”); Uruk (exemplar n: “ Tablet II”); Sippar (exemplar c: “ Tablet I”); and, of unknown provenience, from the Khabaza collection in Philadelphia (exemplar b: “ Tablet I,” but without the rituals). 36A ritual tablet, or “ Tablet III,” for the Lamaštu series must also have existed in Assur, probably in connection with the ṭuppu series, since it is listed in the list of magical texts from the “Haus des Beschwörungspriesters.” 37 This inventory, which had been known from excerpts for a long time, was recently published in full by Geller (2000: 266ff., “ Text A”). Geller’s copy shows that the tablet was probably jotted down hastily when the owner of the library needed to take temporary stock of his holdings. The right columns of both obverse and reverse (col. II and III, respectively) are much narrower than the left ones, and erasures and secondary markings abound. According to an indirect join, col. III ends with material not related to “Lam.”, while immediately after this the Lamaštu texts in the library are listed (Geller 2000: 230, col. IV 1–2):én ddìm.⟨me⟩ dumu an.na [ . . . . . . ?]e-nu-ma né-pe-ši šá dd ì[m . m e teppušu]These lines are followed by a blank space. They seem to refer to only two Lamaštu tablets, of which the first one could have started with Inc. 1, 2, 5, 10, or 13 and thus could have been either tablet I or II of the ṭuppu version. The second one is clearly the “Ritual Tablet.” Since what remains of the line seems already to take up all the space otherwise allotted to col. IV, it is not easy to restore a reference to the other Lamaštu incantation tablet in the gap. But with the upper right-hand corner of the reverse of this tablet missing, and all the other unusual features of the text, I wonder whether the subdivision of the reverse into two columns (III and IV) actually started right at the top of the reverse or possibly only after the blank space? If this were the case, an entry for the missing tablet, or some abbreviated indication that there were two different tablets with the same catchline, could still be restored as the second half of the first line, especially since a similar restoration of at least a few signs would also be very helpful after the second line. 3834. Unfortunately, the number in LKU 33 rev. 37 can no longer be read with certainty. It could be either “2” or “3,” but not “1.” No other colophons preserving either number “1” or “2” for any of the ṭuppū that are known. It is therefore remotely possible that in this recension the Ritual Tablet actually occupied the first place (see below under “Ni/Si Recension”). In this case, what I call “ Tablet I” and “ Tablet II” of the ṭuppu recension would have to be renumbered as “ Tablet II” and “ Tablet III,” with “ Tablet I” designating the Ritual Tablet (= “Lam. III”).35. Nothing is known about the exact findspot or library context of this tablet, but the script makes a relatively early NA date probable. 36. This version is also demonstrably the one from which the “Lam.” passages on the Babylonian school tablets Sb and Sd have been extracted; see Farber 2012b: 231.37. VAT 13723+, from library N 4 (see Pedersén 1986: 49 and 66, no. 291). 38. Note, however, Geller’s observation (2000: 227) that this “catalogue” does not always include all known tablets of a given canonical series but only seems to enumerate those physically present in the library at the time the inventory was taken. In this case, it thus seems even remotely possible that the entry of col. IV 1 could directly correspond to the Assur exemplar m of tablet II (in spite of the fact that neither of its two fragments has been recorded as excavated in the “Haus des Beschwörungspriesters”), while tablet I was simply not represented in the library at that time."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"19The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History Fig. 10.

Exemplar G, although according to the colophon 40 a tablet from the Nabû temple library in Nineveh, and not from Assurbanipal’s palace, was also probably copied locally and thus stands a good chance to have belonged originally to the Ninevite pirsū recension. On the other hand, any of the Babylonian exemplars of the ritual tablet from Kuyunjik (E, F, H) could theoretically equally well be imports that originally belonged with a ṭuppu set, although in the list of sources I have listed all of them as the third pirsu of the “pirsu recen-sion.” I did this mainly because they were excavated in Nineveh, and it somehow seemed appropriate to keep them with the other Kuyunjik material. It should also be noted that the standardized ritual sequence in “Lam. III” 77–97, which makes use of all incantations in the order of their appearance in “Lam. I–II,” follows the arrangement of the incantations as fixed in the pirsu version, and not that of the ṭuppu edition, and that none of the known Babylonian exemplars deviates from this standard text to reflect an earlier(?) order of incantations. While this could be seen as an indication that the “ritual tablet” was actually a secondary addition to the pirsu version that was composed after the new arrangement of the incantations had been fixed, it seems more likely that the rearrangement of the incantations into the pirsu sequence was itself the secondary development by which Assurbanipal’s scribes adjusted the first and second pirsu to reflect the order of events in “Lam. III” 77–97 better (see below). The surprising number of three Babylonian exemplars of “Lam. III” found at Kuyunjik (E, F, H), while no Babylonian exemplars of “Lam. I” or “Lam. II” have been found there, also seems to speak in favor of this second alternative. Finally, there is still another copy of “Lam. III” in Baby-lonian script, possibly from Sippar (x), which can more easily be connected with the two copies of Tablet II of the ṭuppu redaction from Babylon and Sippar 41 in the British Museum (a and c) than with the Ninevite pirsu version. I therefore have listed this text as belonging to the ṭuppu recension.The pirsu Recension (Nineveh and Sultantepe)The version of “Lam. I–III” that remains the best attested and that has traditionally formed the basis of full or partial editions of “Lam.,” including the one presented here, is the one found—and probably created—in Assurbanipal’s library in Nineveh. Here the three main chapters of the text were called pirsū “sections” (see n. 39). “pirsu I” contained Incs. 1–5 with their rituals, while “pirsu II” covered Incs. 6–13 and the rituals to go with them. This is followed by the Ritual Tablet as “pirsu III.” It may well be that one particular passage of the Ritual Tablet that made use of every single incantation in the series in a fixed sequence (“Lam. III” 77–97, see above) prompted Assurbanipal’s practitioner-scholars to change the textual arrangement of the recitanda (“Lam. I” and “Lam. II”) from that of the earlier ṭuppu recension to the new pirsu sequence, so that they could be used in this overarching ritual exactly in the sequence in which they were written down on pirsu I and pirsu II. Four sets of this newly-arranged Lamaštu compendium, all written in NA script, were found in the 39. For the designation of the sections of this version as pirsū, see the colophon of K 2423+ (exemplar C2) IV 31: 2-ú pir-su dDÌM.ME.[MEŠ].40. See Hunger 1968: 106f. no 339.41.

Two of them combine all three “sections” of “Lam.” on one physical tablet of six col-umns (exemplars A and B); the other two spread the same text over three tablets comprising one pirsu each (exemplar sets C and D). While at least parts of all three pirsū of set C have survived (C1–3, all with conspicuous firing holes), no remnants have yet been found of the third pirsu of set D, so that at this time we only have physical tablets D1 and D2. The texts of three of these four sets (A, C1–3, and D1–2) are virtually identical, to the point that there even are no scribal variants on the graphemic level. The writing is very clear and clean, in a perfect NA “library hand.” This makes it very likely that they were copied from one master copy, probably within a short time of each other and maybe even by the same scribe. Five of the tablets (A, C1, C2, D1, and D2) show more or less extensive remnants of the standard colophon “Asb. c.” 42 In C3, the colophon is completely lost, but presum-ably it was also “Asb. c.” The text of the remaining exemplar (B), as far as it is preserved, stays close to that of the other group but shows a different, less polished hand-writing with occasional textual and graphemic variants and even some mistakes. Theoretically, it could thus qualify as the original rough copy for the others, but this is obviously pure speculation, especially since no remnants of the colophon of this tablet have been identified yet.Another copy of the Ritual Tablet in Assyrian script (exemplar G) can, through its colophon, be attributed to the Nabû temple library in Nineveh (see above, p. 20). It should also be noted that this exemplar, as far as it is preserved, is another variant-free, exact duplicate of the Kuyunjik tablets A and C3 and may thus possibly represent still another copy of the “Lam.” series prepared by Assurba-nipal’s scribes at the same time as the others, but for a different library. 43 In any case, I think it highly likely that it originally belonged to a set of tablets containing the 3-pirsū recension of Nineveh.Whether the additional Babylonian copies of the Ritual Tablet that were found at Nineveh (ex-emplars E, F, and H) should be understood as also representing the new pirsu recension, or instead as original copies of the older ṭuppu recension, has been discussed above in more detail. Much speaks for the latter, but a definitive answer does not seem possible. On the other hand, I think it very likely that the one remaining duplicate of “Lam. III” (examplar x, from Sippar?) is actually part of an original ṭuppu set (see above).Outside of Assurbanipal’s library, the pirsu recension, as a late innovation, does not seem to have found wide distribution. The only non-Kuyunjik text that can be classified with a reasonable degree of certainty as belonging to this recension comes from Sultantepe, a library that was assembled and flourished during the time of the Sargonid Dynasty of Assyria 44 and that, in addition to its close con-nections to the older Assur libraries, 45 also shows strong ties with Nineveh and the most “modern” canonical versions from Aššurbanipal’s library there. 46 The text in question is exemplar M = STT 143. Only the lower right corner of what must have been a large tablet survives. After traces of one line from the end of a ritual, the text duplicates “Lam. II” 84–104 (= Inc. 8), with the shift from the 42. See Hunger 1968: 97f., no. 319c.43. That exemplar G might have been the missing ritual tablet of set D, and the latter therefore the missing pirsū 1–2 from the Nabû temple is, unfortunately, excluded by the different wordings of their colophons.44. Pedersén 1998: 178–80.45. See, for instance, Lambert 1959: 123–24.46. Another good example for this is the series Šurpu, where the Sultantepe texts follow the tablet order of Nineveh, while exemplars from Assur and probably also Uruk show a different arrangement. See Farber 2012a: 330b."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition22obverse to the reverse between lines 92 and 93. This exactly mirrors the situation in exemplar A, where the shift from obverse to reverse, coinciding with the end of col. III and beginning of col. IV, also occurs between “Lam. II” 92 and 93 and is very closely paralleled by B (shift obverse–reverse between “Lam. II” 94 and 95). The traces of the preceding ritual could thus be restored according to “Lam. II” 83 (= end of Ritual 7, according to the text sequence of the pirsu recension), as I have done in my edition. 47 There is, however, also another possibility which requires a bit more juggling of the text, and which I therefore consider slightly less likely: if we assume that M followed the older ṭuppu recension, where Inc. 8 followed immediately after Ritual 6b, the damaged ritual line could also be understood as belonging to “Lam. II” 33 (= end of Ritual 6b). 48 We then could compare the textual distribution of M with the exemplars for Tablet I of the ṭuppu recension, where in c the shift from col. III (obv.) to col. IV (rev.) takes place between “Lam. III” 30 and 31, which would be exactly 12 lines earlier than in M. In a, the shift would be about 12 lines later than in M, and in b (which is different anyway, because it does not contain the text of the rituals), it would occur more than 18 lines earlier than in M. All of this may still be close enough to make the comparison somewhat plausible. But with the striking parallels in A and B, I believe it more likely that the STT text is the lower right corner of a 6-column tablet that, like the Kuyunjik exemplars A and B, originally contained all of “Lam. I–III,” in the order of the pirsu recension, on one physical tablet.“Ni/Si” and Possible Other RecensionsThere is at least one tablet with canonical Lamaštu incantations, exemplar α = Ni 2675(+)Si 883, 49 on which the order of the preserved passages is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the text sequence known from tablets that belong to the ṭuppu or pirsu versions. The left column of these two fragments contains text from Inc. 5 (“Lam. I” 148–76), while the right col. has the end of Inc. 12, followed by Inc. 13 and its ritual instructions (“Lam. II” 163–210). To judge from their appearance and rather flat curvature, the two pieces should be parts of the reverse, which becomes even more likely through calculations based on the length of Incs. 5 and 12: if text α were part of the obverse, and if Inc. 5 were followed on this tablet immediately by Inc. 12 (the shortest possible arrangement), we would need to postulate a gap of more then 85 lines between the end of the left and the begin-ning of the right column, with a total column length of well over 110 lines. If, on the other hand, the fragments belong to the reverse, only less than 50 lines have to be inserted between the end of the right and the beginning of the left column, assuming that Inc. 5 started right after the end of Rit. 13, where the right column breaks off. The total column length would then be around 75 lines, this being the median textual distance between lines in the right and left columns of α. This could well fit a hypothetical multi-column library tablet in the sequence of the ṭuppu version, where Inc. 5 (= the beginning of the 2nd ṭuppu) immediately would have followed Ritual 13 (= the end of the first ṭuppu) and on which all of “Lam. I–III” would have been written down. Since in this case the transi-47. Reading [ . . . ana tar-ṣ]i? K[Á? TUŠ-eb]48. Reading [ . . . ina N]E? M[Ú?-šú]49. When I saw the two fragments next to each other in Istanbul, it became absolutely clear to me that, in spite of their museum numbers, they are part of one tablet. Similar problems concerning Ni- and Si- numbers, where there is a likelihood that Si(ppar) texts actually come from Ni(ppur) or vice versa, have been noticed elsewhere: see, for instance, Civil 2011: 222 n. 5 for Si 277 (Nippur?); Borger 1973: 50 for Si 734(+)740 (Nippur?); and Sollberger 1967–68: 51 for the confirmed join of Si 3+Ni 1288 (Sippar)."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"23The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History tion from “1st ṭuppu” to “2nd ṭuppu” would have happened long after the midpoint of the tablet and deep into its reverse, one would furthermore have to assume that the text of this tablet (or version) actually started with the “Ritual Tablet” 50 before moving on to “1st ṭuppu” and “2nd ṭuppu.” This, on the other hand, would contradict the evidence from the Assur catalogue VAT 13723+ rev. 1–2 (see above, p. 18), where the Ritual Tablet of what I assume is the ṭuppu recension of “Lam.” is listed after at least one tablet of Lamaštu incantations. At the same time, another simple calculation shows that such a textual arrangement with ca. 73–75 lines per column would call for an 8-column tablet, to accommodate all ca. 580 lines of “Lam.”, plus a colophon. Based on the size of the script (ca. 10 lines per 28 mm) and width of the columns (roughly estimated at ca. 45 mm), this would yield a big tablet of ca. 210 × 180 mm. As shown by the sketch in fig. 11, the remnants of exemplar α would then have to be placed very close to the top of cols. VI and VII, despite the fact that Si. 883 shows no traces of an upper-edge curvature. Such a reconstruction still seems possible, but in view of the inherent difficulties (unusual 8-col. size of tablet, no visible curvature, unexpected position of text of “Ritual Tablet”), I have kept this exemplar separate from the ṭuppu tablets and have tentatively called it the “Ni/Si recension.”Two other fragments 51 defy my attempts to place them within a known tablet order of “Lam.”, ex-emplars Ψ = SpTU V 239, and Ω = K 10984. Ψ is a small fragment from the middle of a tablet, found in Uruk. After a break of unknown length, it starts as a duplicate of Inc. 11, which in the standard version (“Lam. II” 136–51) is never accompanied by a ritual. In this case, however, the last preserved line adds a fitting ritual instruction, which is culled from the overarching ritual passage in “Lam. III” 94. Unfortunately, there is nothing left of the text that preceded the incantation or followed the ritual line, so the broader context of the fragment remains unknown. This, I think, leaves two possi-bilities open: either the text is the remnant of still another local(?) version of the “Lam.” series, or it is an excerpt text that combined a standard incantation from “Lam. II” with an appropriate excerpt from “Lam. III” (similar to, e.g., texts Ea and Eb) in a different, and unfortunately un reconstructable ritual context. If the latter is true, the fragment should actually have been listed under “Canonical Incantations Used in Other Ritual Contexts” and been given a siglum starting with “E” for “excerpt.” In either case, the text adds another piece of evidence that the canonical text of “Lam. III” was also known in Uruk, but it does not do so in a way that lets me reconstruct the wider context of the frag-ment itself.The other text, Ω, is a small piece from the upper edge of a Kuyunjik library tablet in Assyrian script with remnants of two columns, of which only the left one preserves readable text. The frag-ment could belong to col. I (obv.) or IV (rev.) of a two-column tablet or to either col. I, II, V, or VI of a three-column tablet. The three lines that have survived duplicate “Lam. III” 40– 42, but the piece cannot be part of exemplars A, B, C3, or H. The textual distribution also makes it virtually incon-ceivable that it could be the only remnant of a hypothetical tablet *D3. On the other hand, it is quite possible that it comes from a tablet that does not as such belong to the “Lam.” series but contained 50. The commonly quoted other example for such an arrangment of a magical series is Šurpu, where, however, the definition of LKA 91 as both “ Tablet I” and “Ritual Tablet” (see Reiner 1958: “Introduction” and pp. 11f.) is highly questionable (see Farber 2012a: 330f.).51. For a third one, STT 146, see the commentary to “Lam. II” 110–11.

These will be presented here in the sequence of their textual affiliation and sigla.From Kuyunjik, exemplars A, C1, C2, D1, and D2 all show remnants of one of Assurbanipal’s standard colophons, Hunger 1968: no. 319c, “Asb. c.” 52 For exemplar C3, we can assume the same. These are all “library copies” of the pirsu recension, from the royal palace. In exemplar B, also from the palace library, the colophon is completely lost. The same is the case with the Babylonian copies of “Lam. III” presumably found there (texts E, F, and H).Exemplar G, another copy of “Lam. III,” shows a different Assurbanipal colophon that refers to the Nabû temple (Hunger 1968: 106f. no. 339). I therefore assume that the text formed part of the temple library there.Of the Babylonian tablets of Tablet I of the ṭuppu recension, the end of the tablet is preserved only in two copies. Of these, exemplar a, after the catch line to Tablet II (IV 33), in lieu of a colo-phon only has a damaged one-line note that may have read34 [DUB.1.KÁ]M?

A restoration [NU] AL.TIL might also be considered, since this tablet does not write out Inc. 6 but instead quotes it by incipit only (II 22). In addition, exemplar a does not include the ritual sections, which in the case of exemplar b may have lead to its description as “not complete” in the colophon (see next footnote).54. Why the text of this tablet is described as “incomplete” I do not know for certain. It may reflect the fact that exemplar b does not write out the rituals, only the text of the incantations.55. For colophons containing the statement mār šangî (ša) DN, see Hunger 1968: 175. The spelling A = māru, reminiscent of NB filiations, is also often attested in these phrases. Hunger does not, however, list any other attestations for a šangû of Nabû and/or Nisaba, the divine couple responsible for the scribal arts.

SeriesCanonical Incantations Used in Other Ritual ContextsLamaštu incantations and rituals were not always, and not exclusively, recited or performed in the settings prescribed by the “Lam.” series. As a result, we have a number of texts that duplicate one or several sections of “Lam.” but then integrate this passage into a different ritual setting. The situation is quite transparent in the two cases of exemplars Ea and Eb, with “E” standing for “excerpt.” Here, we find Lamaštu incantations embedded in qutāru rituals. The incantations are literal duplicates to the text of the canonical series and thus were surely excerpted directly from there. While we do not know the exact situation in Eb, 57 the much better preserved 2-column tablet Ea allows us to see more of the story: here, four Lamaštu incantations—Incs. 2, 3, 7, and 6, in this sequence—are written out in full (I 29–II 28). The accompanying rituals from “Lam.” are, however, omitted as unnecessary or unsuitable for the new ritual context, and instead, one new line (line 75 = II 29) is added: 4-TA ÉN.MEŠ ŠEŠ.MEŠ ana UGU KÙ.GI šá dDÌM.ME ŠID-ma ina IGI-at GIŠ.N[Á GAR-an] “ These four incantations you recite over the fumigants for Lamaštu and [place] (the preparation) before the b[ed.]” 58 It is certainly no coincidence that Incs. 3 and 6 are already associated with fumigations in their setting in “Lam.” 59 Why Inc. 2, which in “Lam. I” 32–36 accompanies an ointment, and Inc. 7, which in “Lam.” belongs with the famous ritual of the dog figurines, have (secondarily?) also been incorporated into this qutāru compendium, I do not know.In the baby ritual of text Ec (OECT 11, 57), the selection of Inc. 6 may at first seem a bit surpris-ing. While the affinity between baby rituals and Lamaštu texts is well known and easily understand-able, the secondary use of a Lamaštu excerpt taken directly from the canonical series in a baby ritual is not documented elsewhere. In all other cases known so far, the Lamaštu incantations used were culled from the independent traditions that coexisted with the canonical “Lam.” series (see below, specifically texts “RA” and “SKS”). It should be noted, however, that in Inc. 6 lines 7–10 Lamaštu is seen as having already attacked the baby, and Asalluḫi is called upon literally to remove her from its body. This scene is vividly different from other instances where babies are mentioned mainly as potential victims, and it might well be that this particular nuance made Inc. 6 more suitable than others to the overall context of OECT 11, 57. As shown also by the qutāru texts, there was gener-ally no restriction for the use of canonical “Lam.” material outside its “original” ritual context, and the apparent preference for non-canonical Lamaštu incantations in baby rituals may thus be a pure coincidence.With the lines following the text of Inc. 3 and Ritual 3 still unclear, 60 the ritual context of the fragmentary excerpt Ee cannot yet be reconstructed. Especially in view of the problems involving the 57. This text is a chunk out of the middle of a thick tablet that originally contained three columns on each side. Col. I is completely lost. The “Lam.” excerpt, in this case Inc. 6, takes up all that is left of col. II, depriving us of the immediate context in which it stood. Col. III, as well as the three columns on the reverse, contain non-Lamaštu texts, to go with the overall purpose of the ritual to prepare qutāru fumigations. I. L. Finkel is planning to publish the complete texts of both Ea and Eb. 58. See Finkel 2000: 192 n. 38.59. See “Lam. I” 60, “Lam. II” 31–33, and, combining these two passages, “Lam. III” 74–75.60. According to Heeßel’s copy and transliteration, they seem to be remnants of an unidentified Sumerian incantation that definitely does not belong to “Lam.”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"27The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History date of this piece (see above, pp. 16f.: “An Early Canonical Version in the 13th Century?”), it does not seem appropriate to speculate about Ee’s role for the use of “Lam.” material outside the specific ritual purposes of the “Lam.” series.A very different—and quite interesting—situation is finally presented by the duplicate texts Ed1–2. In this case, a complete incantation can be shown to be at the same time an integral part of two sepa-rate SB magical compendia, the Lamaštu corpus and the bilingual z i - p à -collection. 61 Although the spell is transmitted as Lamaštu Inc. 10 in a unilingual Sumerian version, the two extant duplicates of the pertinent section of §XXII of the z i - p à -collection add an Akkadian translation in a separate column, as is customary with texts of this series. 62 In a case such as this, to speak of “excerpting” texts from one corpus to the other is obviously too simplistic, although we do not know—and maybe never will know—the route the short spell took: did it first get incorporated into one compendium and was then, after being recognized as pertinent for the other as well, copied over? Or did it find its way independently into both, possibly from different sources and at different times? In our case, the question is even more complex, since by the first millennium the monolingual Sumerian version of this spell seems to have had a long history already, being inscribed on amulets that probably date back to at least MB times (see below), although it has not been found on clay tablets before the SB period. The Akkadian or bilingual version, on the other hand, does not seem to be attested anywhere outside of the z i - p à compendium, neither in the second nor in the first millennium, nor does it show up on amulets. This I see as a good indication that the Sumerian text found in “Lam.” and on the amulets is actually more original than the one from Ed1–2 and that—as somehow expected anyway—the Akkadian translation is but a late addition to the original version, probably added when the text was secondarily adapted to the format of z i - p à and incorporated into its second tablet.School Tablets Containing Excerpts from the Lamaštu SeriesA different type of excerption led to the existence of the exemplars edited under the sigla Sa–Sf, the “S” standing for “School Tablets.” Here, the reason for the excerpt is generally not the adapta-tion of a given incantation to a different or new ritual context, although at a given curricular stage even an exercise of this sort might have been asked for. 63 Instead, these excerpts were made as scribal (and mnemotechnic?) exercises on different levels of the curriculum in what I see as a tripartite edu-cational system. In addition to occasionally completing or clarifying the reconstruction of a given passage, these school tablets also show the place Lamaštu texts occupied in this educational system. I have outlined my views on the topic in a paper written in 2002. 64 I will therefore not repeat my arguments in detail but simply give a brief description of the texts involved and of their place in the “Lam.” corpus.According to the standard work by P. Gesche (2000), incantation texts, including Lamaštu texts, were not part of the first stage of education, which concentrated mainly on learning the basics of 61. See Borger 1969: 1ff. for a previous edition of the “Erste Teiltafel” of this series which on p. 12 also contains the Lamaštu incantation.62. In spite of the fact that this Akkadian translation is thus not really a part of “Lam.”, I have reedited the complete bilingual version of z i - p à §XXII as a parallel to Inc. 10.63. For a possible example, see below, discussion of text “FsL.”64. Now published as Farber 2012b."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition28cuneiform script. They only appear in the curriculum of the second stage, when the scholars-to-be had not only to practice their writing skills but also to memorize the text corpora that in later praxis would mainly be needed for oral presentation. This included many incantations, prayers, and texts of similar genres. The excerpts we see on tablets from this stage therefore were probably often not copied from a teacher’s original but instead written down by memory, and the reverse of such tablets was typically used for exercises based on lexical lists. Four of our texts, all of them from Babylonia, probably belong to this middle level of scribal education. A reasonably complete example of such an exercise is text Sd, which combines Lamaštu excerpts from Incs. 5, 7, and 12 with other magical and lexical texts in both Sumerian and Akkadian. 65 Similarly, Sb contains excerpts from three “Lam.” incantations (5, 8, and 9) in the middle of a medley of longish Akkadian passages from other texts, but the text is altogether very atypical, and its place in the curriculum is therefore less clear. 66 Sc and Se are both too fragmentary to inform us about any other texts practiced on them. They contain one “Lam.” excerpt each, from Inc. 7 on Se and from Inc. 5 on Sc.The remaining four school tablets containing Lamaštu material are all from Bēl-rēmanni’s ar-chive 67 and thus presumably belong to the third level of scribal education, when the emphasis of learning lay on short but complete texts from a given area of specialization and showing a general fa-miliarity with its genres. They have been published as such by Finkel (2000: 137–223). Two of them are catalogue-like lists of incipits, one (Sf ) naming only Lamaštu incantations (Inc. 8–9 and 11–13) and the other quoting Inc. 7 among the beginning lines of other magical texts (Finkel 2000: 191f., no. 35 rev. 2′). Both of these probably were used to familiarize the student with the genre of incan-tations. A third text, Sa, is probably an example of the “short complete text” type, containing two complete short incantations from “Lam.” (probably Inc. 10 on its obverse and Inc. 1 on its reverse). Finally, text “FsL” also belongs to this archive and thus is most probably a “school text.” Although formally still covered by the definition of “short complete text,” this exercise takes the matter one step further: here, the student was obviously asked to compose a new, abbreviated but workable ritual adaptation of a major passage from “Lam. III” 30–63. The result has reached a level of independence that prompted me to edit it as a separate non-canonical Lamaštu ritual (see below) rather than as the school exercise it actually is. Interestingly enough, the text composed by the student ended up being quite similar to “RC,” which, judging from the tablet’s shape, is probably neither a library text nor a school text but rather an ad hoc memorandum that was written down by an āšipu in preparation for a specific performance of a Lamaštu ritual similar to, or even identical with, “Lam. III” 30–63 (see below).Excerpts and Adaptations from “Lam. III”The process of excerption and adaptation I have just described for the school tablet “FsL” and the memorandum “RC” can also be observed in a few library texts that closely parallel certain passages from the Ritual Tablet of “Lam.” and that therefore can also be used in the reconstruction of the text 65.

It is conceivable that this unusually big tablet in oblong, or “portrait” format is actually a product of the third tier of education, but it does not belong to the corpus of such texts from Bēl-rēmanni’s archive (see below).67. See the reconstruction of this dossier in Jursa 1999: 4–6, and Finkel 2000: 137ff."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"29The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History of the series. In addition to this, these texts shed some interesting light on the growth and life-cycles of Akkadian rituals in general, but this aspect cannot be treated here in detail. All such excerpts pres-ently known are parallels to sections b and c of the Ritual Tablet (see above, fig. 10, p. 19)—that is, the “Stones Ritual” (“Lam. III” 30–63) and the passage dealing with salves and fumigations (“Lam. III” 64–75). For those that parallel the “Stones Ritual,” the reason for their selection is clearly that this section is very closely related to some baby rituals. All pertinent texts (see the list on p. 50, section 1.2.2.3., texts α, β, η, θ, Aa, e, and STT 273) have already been utilized in my edition of the baby corpus, 68 and are therefore not reedited here. Note also that §16 of the “Baby Compendium” (1989: 68–73), texts Aa and e, designates one of the two mumbo-jumbo spells of this passage specifi-cally as KA.INIM.MA mimma lemnu ana ṣeḫri lā [ṭeḫê] u La[maštu nasāḫi], “Spell to make sure that nothing evil gets close to the baby, and to remove Lamaštu.” 69A virtually complete parallel to the napšaltu passage from “Lam. III” 64–73, including the list of relevant Lamaštu incantations, is found on a tablet from Sultantepe that collects prescriptions for salves and fumigations. Again, the proximity to baby rituals seems to have been the crucial factor for the excerpt, since the purpose of this section is stated here in IV 15 as LÚ.TUR! EŠ TI = ṣeḫra tapaššaš iballuṭ “you apply the ointment to the baby, and it will get well.” Note also that the Lamaštu incanta-tions are listed in a different sequence, and a fourth one not included in “Lam. III” 69–72 is added, so that we now have incipits of Incs. 6, 2?, 8 or 9, and 3, instead of 2, 3, and 6, as in the canonical text of “Lam. III.” A close parallel to this excerpt is offered by a Babylonian compendium to be published by I. L. Finkel and used here as “Rb,” BM 43897+. Here, the passage with the ingredients for the salve (“Lam. III” 64–68) has been left out, while the instructions about the recitanda in “Lam. III” 69–73 and the short qutāru prescription of “Lam. III” 74–75 have been excerpted more or less literally but in reverse order, in lines 32′–35′. The qutāru recipe alone (“Lam. III” 74–75) is finally also included in “Rc” = BAM 183, 16–19, 70 a text that compiles short magico-medical prescriptions of different kinds and adds an inventory of stones at hand or needed for particular purposes.Lamaštu AmuletsLamaštu amulets deserve their own place in a history of the Lamaštu textual corpus since they combine magical, artistic, and literary traits in a group of artifacts that existed parallel to, but not nec-essarily in close contact with, the popular spells of earlier times and the canonical or non-canonical incantations of the first millennium. Their chronological order has to be established independently, by methods largely outside the reach of the philologist, and their philological value is often more de-pendent on the level of “literacy” the individual stone-cutters had achieved rather than on the obser-vation of grammatical, lexical, or other philological details in a synchronic or diachronic comparison.68. See Farber 1989: 68–73. See now also, with a few additional duplicates, Schuster-Brandis 2008: 145 “Kette 142” and “Kette 143.”69. Still another ritual text involving “10 Lamaštu stones” and the recitation of the Sumerian incantation ÉN a n b a . g u l k i b a . g u l (also mentioned in the excerpt of text b ) is attested in STT 275 II 8′–20′ (see Schuster-Brandis 2008: 146), but this one does not seem to have any recognizable connection to the “Lam.” series.70. According to Köcher (1963: p. xx), this exemplar could also be a school tablet. In my opinion, the tabulation of the numbers of needed stones for all kinds of magical purposes (lines 23– 40, including two entries for dDÌM.ME in 23 and 38) speaks more in favor af an ad hoc memorandum of the kind we also see in text “RC.” Schuster-Brandis (2008: 21 n. 80) calls it a “Steininventar.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition30Although a comprehensive and definitive study of the Lamaštu amulets from an archaeological and art-historical point of view is still a desideratum, a well-documented overview of the stylistic and textual development of Lamaštu amulets from the OB through the NB periods has been given by Wiggermann (2000: 219–24). This has been recently supplemented by Götting (2011), while the more extensive study on the subject by the same author (Götting 2009) unfortunately remains unpublished and will therefore not be quoted here in detail. Götting uses all the published Lamaštu amulets that had already been numbered 1–85 (see most recently Wiggermann 2000: 219 n. 11), plus two new pieces from Çatal Höyük and Poggio Civitate (Italy), to which she assigned the numbers 86 and 87, respectively. In her M.A. thesis (2009), she also uses three additional amulets, one from the Martin Schøyen collection, Oslo (MS 2779), one from the collection Moussaieff (no number), and one from an auction catalogue (Christie’s 2000: 100 no. 203; genuine?). Although a photo of the obverse of the Schøyen piece is accessible on a nonscholarly internet page 71 and the third one is technically published in the auction catalogue, no numbers have been assigned to these three amu-lets yet, pending the publication of the thesis.In addition to these previously published pieces, I can present new photos of Lam. amulet no. 60 (fig. 13, courtesy W. Röllig), no. 67 (fig. 21, courtesy W. G. Lambert), and no. 71 (fig. 17, courtesy E. Bleibtreu), as well as photos of another nine hitherto unpublished Lamaštu amulets, which now can be assigned the numbers 88 through 96. Nos. 90–96 are shown on pls. 90–91 at original size. Because of the small size of many of them, I have also included enlarged photos as text figures at the places indicated below:88: BM 132520 (see fig. 2 [p. 4, obv.] and pl. 65 [obv. and rev.]), photos courtesy British Museum.89: IM 67882 (see fig. 4 [p. 5, obv.] and pl. 82 [obv. and rev.]), photos courtesy R.

I also do not assign a number to the amulet-shaped tablet from Meskene mentioned by Wiggermann (2000: 219 n. 11) and now fully edited below as text “Emar.”Wiggermann arranges the pieces into four chronologically and geographically separable groups. Götting’s classification into three main groups, with some distinctive sub-groups for each of them, is somewhat similar (see already above, pp. 3–4). Both classifications are based directly on the scene depicted on any given amulet.

It is only in the later periods that we also occasionally encounter other Lamaštu spells like “Lam.” Incs. 7 and 8 on amulets. Wiggermann’s groups are the following:Group A (roughly corresponding to Götting’s “ Typ I.1– 4”) pieces are usually of OB to MB date and stem mostly from Babylonia, with at least three exemplars also from Assyria. Lamaštu does not hold paraphernalia in her hands, and her picture is usually only lightly incised. She is shown standing, in a threatening posture, with pronounced, large claws and the head of either a lion or a bird of prey (for a few examples, see figs. 2, 3, 15, 17, and 19–22). The only recogniz-able Lamaštu incantation found on amulets of this group is “Lam.” Inc. 10 (Lam. amulets no. 18, 67 [see fig. 21], and 70F, used in this edition as exemplars “Ak”–”Am”). Other Group A amulets show truncated versions of this or a similar spell (see, for instance, the amulets shown in figs. 3 and 22) or only a pseudo-inscription (figs. 15, 17, and 19–20). They remain outside the scope of this text edition.Group B (roughly corresponding to Götting’s “ Typ II.1–3”), presently known only from As-syria, is probably a bit more recent than Group A; according to Götting (2011: 444), the earliest"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition32examples date to the MA period. These amulets are more elaborately sculpted, and Lamaštu now always has a lion’s head and holds a comb and a spindle in her hands (for an example, see fig. 6). The text situation is roughly the same as with group A, but until now, no usable duplicates of “Lam.” Inc. 10 on a group B amulet have been found—only truncated versions that I have not included in my text edition.Wiggermann’s Groups C and D comprise the NA and NB pieces, some of which have formerly been called the “elaborate Assyrian type.” Götting subsumes both groups under her “ Typ III.1–3.” Lamaštu, again regularly with a lion’s head, is now shown with snakes in both hands, standing or crouching on an equid, which itself often stands in a boat. A dog and a pig are usually shown suckling at her breasts (for examples, see figs. 1, 4, 12, 14, 16, and 18). As a variant, she can also be depicted as holding the pig and dog in her hands (see, for example, figs. 13 and 23). This central motif is often expanded into a vividly landscaped scene populated by fish, scorpions, and centipedes, while pictures of paraphernalia that are used to bribe her into leaving fill the empty spaces of the composition. Since these amulets belong to the same general period and share the same selection of texts (mostly Inc. 1, but also 7 and 8), for our purpose they also can be treated together. Pieces that duplicate “Lam.” Inc. 1 are Lam. amulets nos. 5 (Bab., here used as exemplar “A b1”), with an unpublished duplicate “Ab2” that shows the same variant version of the incanta-tion; 6 (Bab., used here as “Ac”); and 61 (Bab., used here as “Ad”). To these published exemplars, the unpubl. pieces “Ad,” “Ae,” “Af,” and “Ag” (all Assyr.) can now be added.Special mention needs to be made of text “Aa,” an alabaster tablet that contains several incan-tations. These include parts of the Ḫulbazizi series and “Lam.” Incs. 2 + 1, in this sequence. The purpose of this artifact is not quite clear, since it does not show any features otherwise regularly as-sociated with amulets (shape, pictorial representations, etc.). Because of its shallow inscription and heavy wear of the soft material, and because I. L. Finkel is planning to publish the piece fully in his edition of the Ḫulbazizi texts, I have refrained from copying it myself, but a photo can be found on pl. 81. Lacking a better category, I have designated it “Aa” and edited it as an amulet.Two other amulets merit special mention as well. They are both of excellent workmanship and date to the NA/NB period. One of them surfaced on the art market (text “Ah,” Babylonian script) and the other was found in Byblos (text “Ai,” Assyrian script). Each of them bears the text of an incantation that otherwise had not yet been attested on amulets: “Lam.” Inc. 7 on text “Ah,” and “Lam.” Inc. 8 on text “Ai.” As another very unusual feature, both start with colophon-like introduc-tions or owners’ statements.The “colophon” of the Byblos piece, “Ai,” allows us a rather exact dating of the piece. It reads: 741 šá IDINGIR-i[t-t]i?-i[a]2 LÚ.SAG šá IdUTU-ši-dIM3 MAN KUR aš-šur ki GAR KUR URU.BAL.TIL4 a-na na-ṣar ZI-šú74. After Dossin’s publication (1969), the reading was significantly improved by Nougayrol (1971: 174). The identification of the owner is due to E. Reiner and J. A. Brinkman (see Brinkman 1973: 46; and cf. Baker 2000: 530 s.v. Ilu-ittīja)."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"33The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History 5 NAM.ERÍM a-na SU?-šú NU TE-e6 [dD]ÌM.ME dDÌM.ME.A dDÌM.ME.ḪAB7 [a-n]a IDINGIR-it-ti-ia DUMU DINGIR-šú NU TE NU DIM48 [zi a]n.na ḫé.pàd zi ki.a ḫé.pàdBelonging to Ilu-ittija, ša-rēši official of King Šamšī-Adad of Assyria, governor of Assur: In order to safeguard his life, to avoid that a curse gets to him, (and) to avoid that Lamaštu, Labāṣu (or) Aḫḫāzu come near (or) draw close to Ilu-ittija, the protegé of his god, may the life of heaven be invoked, may the life of earth be invoked!Ilu-ittija was a ša-rēši who served as eponym in 804. He was also governor of Assur under Šamšī-Adad V and Adad-nērārī III and may have been involved in the latter’s military engagement in Syria. He might thus personally have taken along his own Lamaštu amulet to Byblos, the city where it eventually resurfaced almost three millennia later. In spite of its find-spot, it therefore should be seen as a true Assyrian artifact, and neither its slightly unusual relief nor the unusual selection of the text should be blamed (or credited) on its “Western” or “provincial” provenience.The date and ownership of “Ah” is not as transparent. The “colophon” of this piece reads:1 DUB?! šá Ida-nu-I? ME ŠÚ A Iina-SÙḪ-ŠUR2 šá TÙM?!-šú NU GUR dPA ZÀḪ-šú3 liq-bi !Tablet 75 belonging to Anu-naʾid?, the . . . . . . , son of Ina-tēšê-eṭir. Whoever takes it along(?) 76 (but) does not return (it), may Nabû order his ruin! 77Of the two names mentioned in line 1, only one (Ina-tēšê-eṭir) is safely readable. This is a relatively common name, especially in Uruk and its surroundings. 78 The name of his son, and thus the owner (or, less likely, maker?) of the amulet, is still unclear. The signs seem to be da-nu-I?(-)ME(-)ŠÚ, but it remains uncertain whether the name ends with the sign I (*Anu-naʾid?), in which case ME.ŠÚ would have to be some appositional noun or professional title. If not, ME.ŠÚ should still be part of the PN, but I am at a loss to find a suitable NB name. In any case, these three lines, which are found on the obverse of the amulet just beneath the traditional Lamaštu scene, are written very badly, with several signs obviously misunderstood by the carver. In contrast, the text of the incantation, which starts on the lower edge and continues down the reverse all the way to the back and top of the handle, is written much cleaner and lacks major scribal mistakes. But it also has one rather curious feature: it breaks off suddenly in the middle of “Lam. III” 53, right on the top of the handle, just before the text would have become visible from the obverse, and leaves out the remaining six-and-one-half 75. No better reading than a defective DUB comes to mind in this context.76. This reading, proposed by F. Wiggermann (2000: 241 n. 179), makes much more sense than my original suggestion (Farber 1997: 119) but is very hard to reconcile with the wedges on the amulet. If this “colophon” has, as I assume, been copied from a clay tablet, I see no reason for Wiggermann’s further assumption that the verb itabbalu “carries away” refers to “loaning out” this amulet for the performance of a Lamaštu ritual on private order. 77. If the readings are correct, this “colophon” closely parallels lines 3– 4 of no. 424 in Hunger 1968: 124, which unfortunately is also unprovenienced.78. See, for instance, J. A. Brinkman in Baker 2000: 530."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition34lines of Inc. 7. The carver thus avoided having an upside-down inscription visible at the top of the amulet. If not purely coincidental, the spot for the break in the text is well selected, since it comes right after the end of the “narrative” part of the incantation and before the conventional nīš xx and z i - p à d invocations that bring it to an end. This might indicate that the carver fully understood the text he was writing. Another question is: from what kind of original was this text copied onto our piece? The “colophon” looks like it might be an ad hoc copy of a clay tablet written in cursive NB script, made by a stone carver not familiar with this type of text. On the other hand, the much-better-written incantation text would presuppose an original that was easier for him to read, maybe already in monumental script on stone. With no other amulet known that is inscribed with this same incantation (Inc. 7), this conclusion remains, however, purely hypothetical.Finally, three amulets that bear Lamaštu inscriptions that are not part of the canonical “Lam.” se-ries should be mentioned. One of them is unfortunately only a modern forger’s copy of a lost original. Although the reconstructed text of this artifact has been edited, as far as feasible, as duplicate d of the non-canonical text “RA,” the legitimate use of this text is limited to the fact that it testifies (or at least seems to testify) to the existence of a fragment of an original amulet, now lost, that bore this inscription.The second one is a little clay barrel cylinder found in a late grave at Ugarit, RS 25.457, which I have mentioned already above (p. 8) and which duplicates part of text “STT 144” (see below, p. 37). Since it does not have any relationship to the carved stone amulets used against Lamaštu and since its date and origin are obscure, it also cannot be assigned a place in the history of such artifacts.The third one is the curious amulet tablet from Meskene that is edited separately as “Emar.” Again, I refer the reader back to my lengthy description of this piece (above, pp. 14–16).Other Standard Babylonian Lamaštu Incantations and RitualsIn addition to the canonical “Lam.” series, twelve SB texts with Lamaštu incantations and rituals that were not included in the canonical set have been identified to date. They are all edited in Part II of this book. Seven of the texts contain non-canonical incantations specifically directed against Lamaštu, in a variety of ritual settings. The other five are rituals that either mention Lamaštu but do not require the use of specific Lamaštu incantations or contain ritual matter so specifically tied to the Lamaštu corpus that their inclusion in this edition seemed warranted.Non-Canonical Lamaštu Incantations in a Variety of Ritual Settings“ND”: Another SB Connection to the Middle Babylonian Compendium “Ug”Four of these texts have come down to us in more than one exemplar. For the textual history of Lamaštu texts, perhaps the most interesting of these is “ND.” Two versions of the incantation edited under this text name have survived: an SB version in NA script from Nimrud published as CTN 4, 104, which also includes ritual instructions; and an MB version without ritual from Ugarit that forms part of the big Lamaštu compendium “Ug,” col. III. 79 The textual interdependency between both 79. For a more detailed discussion of “Ug,” see above, pp. 9ff. and figs. 7–8."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"35The Lamaštu Texts: Ancient History versions is very similar to what can be observed in the relationship between “Ug” and the canonical “Lam.” series, with “Ug” virtually duplicating some lines, preserving recognizable parallels to others, and deviating considerably from the later version in about 25% of the text. The very broken state of the version from Nimrud as represented by exemplar ND (only the right half of the tablet has survived) makes the comparison, however, much more difficult and less fruitful than for the passages from “Ug” with parallels in “Lam. I–II” (see above, pp. 9ff.).“SKS”: Assyrian Influence in Uruk?Another non-canonical SB Lamaštu text with several duplicates is “SKS.” This incantation was fully edited, together with its ritual, in Farber 1989a (= SKS) §34. Since the ritual is specifically geared to help an ailing baby, only the incantation is repeated here in the context of Lamaštu texts. While one exemplar (e = LKU 32) comes from Uruk, the other two (k and l = SKS pls. 12–13) were both found in the NA library of the “Haus des Beschwörungspriesters.” 80 The Uruk “version” has a slightly longer and in some places different text than the two Assur tablets, which are almost exact duplicates. More interestingly, the Uruk text also shows several Assyrianisms not present in the As-sur “version,” which may prompt some speculations about their redactional and transmissional his-tory, without allowing me any final conclusions.“RA”: A Multi-Use Lamaštu IncantationThe most famous non-canonical Lamaštu incantation is the one first published by Thureau-Dangin (RA 18, 163: rev. 13–29) and reedited here under the name “RA.” Two of the duplicates known today (a and b) come from ritual texts from Uruk, one (c) is of unknown provenience, 81 and one is the modern copy of a lost ancient amulet, obviously also of unknown origin (d). Although the latter cannot be used for the history and context of this incantation, 82 exemplars a versus b and c show this spell in two different surroundings. In a, an LB ritual tablet from Uruk, it forms an appendix to rites to be performed for the benefit of a pregnant women; these rites extend over a pe-riod of more than four months (cf. rev. 9 and 12). The compendium is credited to an original from Babylon (obv. 11). The ritual uses several incantations, including a short Sumerian spell (obv. 15), an Akkadian incantation of the genre u š11. b ú r. r u . d a (obv. 16–25), and two spells that are only given by their titles (obv. 26–27). The second of these, obv. 27, may actually be another unknown Lamaštu spell, judging from its incipit [É]N ez-ze-ta ša-am-ma-rat dan-na-a[t . . . . . . ], 83 while the fol-lowing one-line ritual (obv. 28) seems to refer to a bronze Pazuzu statuette. The agenda on this tablet also make use of wools and stones in a way reminiscent of “Lam. III” 30–56, “RC,” and “FsL” but are altogether not close enough to the Lamaštu corpus to warrant inclusion here. 8480. See Pedersén 1985: 41ff: N 4 nos. 24 and 247.81. BM 42327+, prov. unknown. The tablet has been accessioned under the date of 81-7-1 as part of a collection excavated by Rassam, with tablets from various sites; see Finkel 2000: 137.82. The fact that the text had been written on an amulet that, if we had its original, would be the only one to bear this particular incantation is, however, noteworthy.83. For a categorization of this incipit as “Lamaštu inc.,” see, for instance, CAD Š/I 314b.84. Note, however, that the word *ḫuppu, which otherwise has not been found yet outside the Lamaštu corpus (see commentary to “Lam. III” 3), is also used in “RA” obv. 11."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition36In exemplar b (SpTU 3, 84, also LB and from Uruk), a collection of rituals not quite adequately described by its first editor, E. von Weiher, as “Beschwörungsritual gegen Lamaštu,” the incantation is found in the fifth of six sections, all of which seem to be designed to safeguard families from the loss of their children. 85 Most of these sections probably started with a description of “symptoms” introduced by šumma “if ” (lines 1, 17, 24, 37, and 79). The first section (1–16) seeks to prevent stillbirth for a woman who already had experienced one failed pregnancy and includes a ritual involving a Lamaštu figurine. It has been reedited in Part II under the name “SpTU.” The second section (17–23) deals with a man “who is struck by the catastrophe that his sons have died.” 86 This is followed by a section (24–36 // LKA 142, 1–18) dealing with extra protection for a surviving son: “[In the case of a child] whom his (i.e., probably the father’s) misfortune passed by: to avoid evil to approach (him), (or) any-thing bad to get close (to him).” 87 Section four (37–55) seeks to provide protection for the stricken family: “[In the case of a man] whose sons keep dying, are often ill,” (etc.). 88 After this, there follows section five (56–78), with the Lamaštu incantation, which is a duplicate of the baby ritual I edited previously in Farber 1989a (= SKS) §§39a and 40. 89 This is the only section that is not separated from the following one by a double line, but the subdivision is obvious on thematic grounds. The Sammeltafel ends (79–100) with still another ritual against death or excessive illnesses among one’s children: “[In the case of a man] whose children die [through ac]tions of Gula, of Lamaštu, of adver-sity, or of oath/curse, [or . . . . . .], or are often ill: to save his children.” 90 Although she is mentioned with the causes of death and illness in the protasis, this ritual does not specifically address Lamaštu and is therefore also not edited here.Exemplar c (SKS pls. 14–15, of unknown provenience) duplicates section 5 of SpTU 3, 84 (see above)—that is, the Lamaštu incantation ezzet šamrat embedded in a baby ritual, but this time on a separate single-column tablet. The text of lines 1–13 was edited under the siglum o in Farber 1989a (= SKS) §§39a and 40, while the Lamaštu incantation was “saved” for the current edition. The colo-phon of this tablet (lines 40– 41) is also of interest, with what seem to be two different catch-lines starting with DIŠ MUNUS.PEŠ4 [ . . . ], and DIŠ NA [ . . . ], respectively. Whether this might be seen as an indication that the ancient copyist used two different sources, which showed this ritual in two different textual settings, I do not know. 91 Another duplicate to the baby ritual (edited in SKS under the siglum p) only quotes the Lamaštu incantation, without writing out the complete text.85. See Farber 1985: 224ff. 86. 17: [šumma] amēlu miḫrī maḫir mārūšu imtūtū.87. 24: [šumma ṣeḫru] miḫiršu ītetiqšu ana lumni lā ṭeḫê mimma lemnu lā sanāqi.88. 37: [šumma amēlu] mārūšu imtanuttū lū murṣānūšu maʾdū, etc. Although, in line 41, Lamaštu is mentioned as the recipient of some kind of offering, the rest of the ritual is not related to her. Similarly, the mention of a “singly growing tamarisk” in the accompanying spell (44– 46) does not seem to be related to the similar phrases in “Lam. II” 47 and 146; see Farber 1989b: 228 n. 18. 89. At the end of line 57, there is still a trace of É[N] visible.— For a few readings in lines 58, 60, and 61 that can be improved, cf. the transliterations of the duplicates in Farber 1989a: 112–14. 90. 79f.: [šumma amēlu ina q]āt Gula qāt Lamaštu qāt miḫri lu ina qāt māmīti [ . . . . . . ] mārū⟨šu⟩ imuttū lū murṣānūšu maʾdū mārīšu ⟨ana⟩ eṭēri.91.

The follow-ing short ritual (12–14) also does not seem to be related to other known Lamaštu rituals. The main interest of the text, however, comes again from Ugarit, where, in a Persian grave, a small amulet in the shape of a barrel cylinder (RS 25.457, exemplar b) has been found, containing a duplicate of lines 1– 4. Unfortunately, this grave and its other contents have not yet been published, as far as I know, nor do I have access to a photograph of the amulet. 94 I therefore cannot say with any degree of certainty whether it was written in this late period or is a stray from an earlier period that somehow made its way into the grave when it was dug. If it actually dates from the Persian period, it consti-tutes the latest textual evidence for the writing down and actual use of any Lamaštu text outside of Babylonia.Another Sultantepe tablet that contains but is not completely devoted to Lamaštu is “STT 145.” A fragmentary non-canonical Lamaštu incantation fills the lower part of the obverse(?) and is pre-ceded by a ritual. Judging mainly from the two types of shoes mentioned in line 3′, which together show up several times in Lamaštu texts, this ritual is probably also addressed to Lamaštu. The re-verse(?) contains unrelated ritual instructions and an incantation to Šamaš. The text is altogether too broken to be of much use for the history of Lamaštu rituals, other than that it constitutes evi-dence for still another non-canonical incantation being copied and transmitted in NA times, in this case in a provincial library that seems to have had close ties to the scholarly activities in Nineveh.Excavated in Nineveh, text “FsB” stands as the only witness to the survival of non-canonical Lamaštu incantations in Assurbanipal’s library itself. Interestingly, the tablet was copied already in antiquity from a very damaged original, as shown by the frequent glosses ḫepi “broken.” The text makes liberal use of phraseology reminiscent of the canonical “Lam.” series without literally duplicat-ing a single line from it. No duplicates or other secondary source material to enhance our understand-ing of it has come to light yet.Non-Canonical Rituals With Ties to the Lamaštu CorpusThe two first texts to be mentioned here (“RC” and “FsL”) have already been described above with other excerpts and adaptations from “Lam. III.” Of these, “RC” is a pillow-shaped NA tablet that was probably written down in preparation for a specific performance of a Lamaštu ritual similar to, or even identical with, “Lam. III” 30–63. Its contents are very similar to that of “FsL,” which—judging from the context in which it was recovered and published—is, however, a school tablet. Both texts also refer to incantations known to belong to the Lamaštu corpus: although “FsL” in line 19 quotes the two short mumbo-jumbo spells from “Lam. III” 57–60 and 61–61, “RC” line 28 prescribes the 92. See already O. R. Gurney in Gurney and Hulin 1964: 2.93. Cf. E. Reiner in Reiner and Civil 1967: 183f., who suggests that obv. 14–18 might also have been directed against Lamaštu, a proposal that I think not very likely.94.

In this respect, they are somewhat similar to the rituals described above (p. 29), which also excerpt and partially rework text from the Ritual Tablet to embed it in other ritual contexts. At the same time, they stand apart because they do not just quote from the standard text but rather provide complete, performable rituals of their own which are then no longer bound to the context of “Lam.” In the case of “FsL,” it is quite surprising to see this happening on a school tablet, which makes one wonder about the place such an exercise may have had in the curriculum. 96“K 888,” on the other hand, embeds an otherwise unknown but typical Lamaštu ritual passage in a long ritual sequence addressed to Šamaš. The reason (and purpose) for this inclusion has been discussed at length in the edition of the text by Schwemer (2006: 197ff.; and Schwemer 2007: 76f.), who also could not find a perfect solution for this intriguing question.I also have included the initial passage of SpTU III 84 (as “SpTU”) in this group of texts. This is a lengthy compendium of rituals for protection against stillbirth and death in the family, 97 and the in-clusion of a Lamaštu-related passage seems to make much sense here. Quite unexpectedly, however, the text chooses not to use any of the traditional Lamaštu incantations but instead follows the pat-terns of other dissociative rites, while still using a “Daughter-of-Anu” figurine as the main carrier of the evil to be removed. Diction and vocabulary of this text therefore are not at all reminiscent of the rest of the Lamaštu corpus.The last text in this group, “BM 33399,” is very fragmentary. What remains on this hitherto unpublished fragment is a prescription against Lamaštu-related problems in lines 6′ff., which are pre-ceded by a ritual of unknown purpose that is traced back to an original from the time of Ḫammurapi (line 5′). If this line should also refer to what follows, the text would be a nice illustration of the long life and history of tradition of the Lamaštu texts, from OB to LB. Alas, this cannot be proved. The rest of the obverse(?) and reverse(?) contains remnants of other magico-medical prescriptions against Lamaštu that include substances and ritual actions also known from the Lamaštu corpus. Only for this reason have I included the text in this edition, while I otherwise did not try to assemble all at-testations from the medical corpus for Lamaštu herself or for illnesses related to her influence.Unidentified FragmentsAs an appendix, I have added three fragments from Kuyunjik with broken text passages the word-ing of which is somewhat similar to phrases in Lamaštu texts (see the commentary for details). Be-cause of their fragmentary state, however, I can neither prove nor disprove that they really belonged to the Lamaštu corpus as defined in this edition.95. It seems quite possible that this rubric line, if restored as [2 É]N? dDIM11.ME, also refers to the two mumbo-jumbo spells just mentioned and that both “FsL” 19 and “RC” 28 thus represent parallels to “Lam. III” 63.96. See also the brief discussion above (pp. 27–28) under “School Tablets.”97.

The first published record of this reappearance of which I know came shortly before 1850 in the form of a sketch of an amulet published by F. Lajard (1837– 49: pl. 17). The piece disappeared later, but was numbered by F. Thureau-Dangin (1921: 179) as Lam. amulet no. 7. 1 As we know from its republication in 1926, it bears an inscription that is not part of the Lamaštu corpus but belongs to the compendium Ḫulbazizi, 2 to be edited by I. L. Finkel. In 1853, A. H. Layard published the antique mold for a second Lamaštu amulet (Lam. amulet no. 10), which does not show any inscription (1853: 597), and in 1857, a third one (Lam. amulet no. 12), inscribed with what appears to be a mock text of literally meaningless but magically power-ful “cuneiform” signs, was made known by W. K. Loftus (1857: 236). Almost a quarter of a century later, in 1879, L. de Clercq and J. Ménant published what is still one of the key pieces for Lamaštu iconography and artifact-based philological work in our field, the famous plaque d’enfer. 3 In the fol-lowing years, many additional Lamaštu amulets, with and without inscriptions, became available to scholarship (cf. above, p. 30). The first of these to duplicate an incantation from what by then had become know as the Lamaštu Series was published in 1901 (photo) and 1903 (text). 4 It is now listed as Lam. amulet no. 5, edited here under the name “Ab1”, and bears the text of “Lam.” Inc. 1.Looking ahead, it took until 1921 for the first amulet bearing the text of “Lam.” Inc. 10 to be pub-lished. 5 Only relatively recently did the first amulets come to light that duplicate other incantations from the series: “Lam.” Inc. 7 on amulet no. 77 (here exemplar “Ah”; Farber 1997: 116ff.), and “Lam.” Inc. 8 on Lam. amulet 60 (here exemplar “Ai”; Dossin 1969: 250ff.). Two amulets with Lamaštu in-cantations that are not part of the canonical series also have become known since. Unfortunately, 1. For the current numbering of Lamaštu amulets, which by the year 2000 had reached no. 85, see most recently Wiggermann 2000: 219 n. 11. On. p. 30 above, I bring the list up to no. 96.2.

The other is a small inscribed clay barrel-cylinder from Ugarit without pictorial representations (see text “STT 144,” exemplar b). 6The First TextsThus, when the first edition of vol. IV of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia (IV R1, published under the name of H. C. Rawlinson, with lithograph copies by G. Smith) ap-peared in 1875, only two amulets and an amulet mold relating to Lamaštu were known, none of which bore a readable in-scription or could otherwise be identified as referring to a par-ticular demon. The year 1875 therefore marked the very first time that Lamaštu was resurrected from written sources 7 and made her appearance in Assyriology, which was at that time still in its baby shoes (no pun intended). Vivid testimony for this early stage of scholarly endeavor in our field is given by the first “edition” of the Lamaštu texts by J. Halévy (1882), who clumsily transcribed them into Hebrew characters but never produced his promised translation and commentary. A major step forward came with the publication of the second edition of vol. IV of the Cuneiform Inscriptions in 1891. IV R2, as it is known today, was again published under the name of Rawlinson, but now the copies by G. Smith were replaced by more reliable typesets prepared by T. G. Pinches. Undoubtedly already helped by the ongoing cataloging work by C. Bezold (1889–99), Pinches also included a number of additional fragments, and the Lamaštu corpus now comprised major portions of text published on pls. 55 (formerly 62), 56 (formerly 63), and 58 (formerly 65), plus pp. 10–11 of the “Additions.” For individual identifica-tions of these pieces, which all belong to exemplars A, C1–3, and D1, see p. 56, Table I s.v. Pinches IV R2. This material eventually formed the basis of an edition by Charles Fossey (1902: 390– 421).From Myhrman to GeersFossey’s edition remained, however, without much resonance in the field, since the year 1902 also saw the publication of David Myhrman’s Leipzig dissertation “Die Labartu-Texte: Babylonische Beschwörungsformeln nebst Zauberverfahren gegen die Dämonin Labartu” (Myhrman 1902). In this work, written under the guidance of Heinrich Zimmern, 8 Myhrman also used additional pieces of 6. RS 25.457, see Nougayrol 1968: 404 “D,” and Arnaud 2007: pl. xxx no. 69.7. The Lamaštu texts included in IV R1 were published on pls. 62, 63, and 65.8. I cannot resist mentioning here also that Myhrman was an alumnus of the University of Chicago, where he got his B.A. in 1896 and continued his studies under W. R. Harper. He received his M.A. from Harvard under G. Reisner, before moving to Leipzig for his Ph.D. Fig. 14. The first Lamaštu amulet to be published, Lam.

Meissner in the second volume of his widely-read cultural history “Babylonien und Assyrien” (1925). This source in particular inspired a number of literary quotations, some of which V. Haas collected (2000: 523–52, esp. 543– 46). Probably the most famous of them is the passage from Thomas Mann’s novel Joseph und seine Brüder IV 337ff., in which a clay figurine of “Labartu” 10 with a piglet’s heart in her mouth is smashed with a sword and then buried in a corner of the wall. This clearly reflects the rituals trans-lated by Myhrman (1902: 193, 195) and referred to by Meissner (1925: 222ff.).Until this time, only texts from Kuyunjik had been utilized for the reconstruction of the “Lam.” series, but in 1919 H. F. Lutz published his hard-to-read and often sloppy hand-copy of a Babylonian exemplar (here b) of unknown provenience 11 in PBS 1/II 113. In 1922, E. Ebeling included a big 9. Still more pieces of exemplar D1 were published later, although not recognized as “Lam.” fragments, by R. C. Thompson in AMT no. 3/3 and EG pl. 28b.10. In his edition, Myhrman kept the reading *Labartu which he calls “konventionell,” and Meissner also used this form. Myhrman (1902: 5) shows that he was well aware that an alternative *Lamaštu was equally possible. Final proof for the correctness of the latter came only in 1925, when A. Ungnad drew attention to CT 2, 27, 6, an OB document that mentioned a “Lamaštu Street” and spelled this SILA dla-ma-áš-tim, thus removing the ambiguity of the SB spellings with a sign that could be read either maš or bar. The reading *Lamaštu has been bolstered since then by other syllabic spellings (see, for instance, Falkenstein 1931: 6 n. 1), but *Labartu can still be found occasionally in non-scholarly contexts, especially on the internet.11.

Falkenstein published LKU 33, a Babylonian “Lam.” tablet from Uruk (exemplar n). These new sources showed a different arrangement of the text and, at least for the time being, made the reconstruction of a “canonical text” harder rather than easier. While Lutz and Ebeling published only hand-copies of the cuneiform texts, Falkenstein also included a transliteration and translation of the passages covered by LKU 33 (see Falkenstein 1931: 8–13), but no attempt at a new edition of the now considerably enlarged corpus was made until F. Köcher’s dissertation (Köcher 1948; see below). Around the same time, from 1924 to 1939, F. W. Geers, working for the Assyrian Dictionary project of the University of Chicago, copied thousands of cuneiform texts and fragments, mainly in the British Museum, London. Among these, he and his colleagues identified another 18 fragments from the Kuyunjik Collection as belonging to “Lam.”, and Geers joined some of them with other known pieces. He also recognized that the Nineveh recension was preserved on several sets of tablets, with at least one of them (now exemplar A) combining all three sections of the series on one physical tablet.Franz Köcher: Dissertation (1948) and CAD manuscript (1974)When Köcher wrote his 1948 dissertation “Beschwörungen gegen die Dämonin Lamaštu” under the guidance of E. Ebeling at the University of Berlin, he was finally able to reconstruct a continu-ous text for the canonical “Lam.” series correctly, based on the Kuyunjik texts, with only a few gaps remaining. This was largely due to the fact that Geers had ceded his publication rights for six of the newly identified fragments (three of them already joined together) 12 to Köcher, and he thus could fully utilize them in his work. For the remaining twelve fragments, 13 Köcher was only allowed to quote the museum numbers but could not include the texts in his edition. While he thus took a huge step forward, he was not yet able to distribute all known Nineveh fragments between the sets A, B, C1–3, and D1–2 correctly, as we know them now. He also could not yet understand the relationship be-tween the Kuyunjik version of the series and the different one represented by exemplars b, m, 14 and n, and thus had to split these up into sections, which he then edited as duplicates of the correspond-ing incantations and/or rituals in Nineveh.Following Myhrman’s edition of the series, a few non-canonical Lamaštu texts had also been published, which Köcher included in his edition. These were, in addition to the amulet “Ab1” men-tioned already above, two spells from the OA and OB periods (here texts “OB2,” published in 1920, and “OA2,” published in 1927), which he edited for the first time; 15 and the Lamaštu incantation of text “RA,” known at that time only from its main text a, as published by Thureau-Dangin in 1921.

The fragment VAT 10327, which forms an indirect join to exemplar m, was first identified by Ebeling as a duplicate to LKU 33 (margin notes in his hand-copy of LKU, today at the University of Tübingen) and then also included in Köcher’s edition.15. “OB2” had first been identified as a Lamaštu incantation by Meissner (1925: 222 n. 6) and “OA2” by Falkenstein (1931: 9 n. 3)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"43The Lamaštu Texts: Recent History addition to this, Köcher edited the Lamaštu incantation embedded in LKU 32, with an unpublished duplicate from Assur that Ebeling had identified (see now text “SKS,” exemplars e and l). 16Unfortunately, this dissertation, written in post-WW II Berlin under very difficult conditions and finished during the Berlin air-lift, was never published. Only a handful of carbon copies on very bad paper were made when Köcher typed it, and of these, probably not more than two or three have survived until today. I thus will not make further detailed reference to this work, which is basically an unpublished manuscript. 17 On the other hand, an acknowledgment of its importance for the recon-struction of the text and of Köcher’s contributions to its understanding seems more than appropriate here, especially since I had the privilege of access to one of the surviving copies.Another unpublished manuscript, bringing his reading of the “Lam.” series up-to-date, was pre-pared by Köcher in 1974 for use by the CAD. In the meantime, new identifications of texts and frag-ments, many of them still based on Geers’s copies, as well as numerous joins within the known corpus, had been made. Many of them were made available to Köcher by his colleagues, notably E. Weidner, W. G. Lambert, K. Deller, and R. Borger. 18 In 1964, the Sultantepe Lamaštu tablets were published by O. R. Gurney. In 1969, the edition of the new texts from Ugarit by J. Nougayrol appeared, and G. Dossin published the amulet “Ai” with a text duplicating “Lam.” Inc. 8. This additional mate-rial, as far as it was accessible to Köcher, was integrated into his manuscript, but since this was never meant for publication and became available to me only through the kindness of E. Reiner, I will refrain from quoting it. It shows, however, that Köcher was still working on an edition of Lamaštu at the time, about three years before he suddenly, and for me quite unexpectedly, asked me to take over his old project in 1977. The fact that during the following years, when we had an on going very friendly correspondence about Lamaštu, he never offered me a copy of this latest version of his efforts confirms my feeling that he did not want me to quote it in detail, in what at the time was supposed to be a speedy publication of my own. Nevertheless, Köcher’s name will, and indeed should, remain closely connected with the Lamaštu texts, even though neither of his successive editions of “Lam.” ever got published.New Discoveries Since 1977When, in 1977, Köcher asked me to take over the Lamaštu project because he felt that his other work on the series BAM made it unlikely that he could finish and publish the edition himself, I gladly accepted the offer, especially since I had been working on the material intermittently since 1970 and had already made significant progress on the reconstruction of the “Lam.” series (see Borger 1975: 230). At about the same time, I. L. Finkel began his survey of the Babylon collections in the Brit-ish Museum. Over the next few years, he identified many “Lam.” texts and other Lamaštu related 16. e = LKU 32 obv. 12–17; l = (Photo) K.4132 = A 394 = now Farber SKS pl. 12.17. After my manuscript was finished, Jerry Cooper discovered that a scan of Köcher’s dissertation is actually available on the internet, albeit in a rather unexpected context as part of the project “European Cultural Heritage Online (ECHO),” section “Cuneiform Tablets: Decipherment,” of the Max-Planck-Institut Berlin: http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuViewfull?mode=imagepath&url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/library/Q56UUN4X/pageimg&viewMode=images.

The first identifications of most of the hitherto unpublished texts with BM numbers go back to him, as does that of the amulet-shaped “Emar” tablet later published in photo by S. Dalley (Dalley and Teissier 1992: pl. xiv). M. Geller and W. G. Lambert also contributed to a steady stream of newly identified material that enlarged the cor-pus of texts that I could use for my edition far beyond what Köcher had used in 1974. Additionally, a good number of publications containing new Lamaštu texts, or important duplicates to known texts, have appeared since Borger’s overview (1975: 229f.). They can be found in my “List of Previous Pub-lications” on pp. 53ff. under the names of Cavigneaux, van Dijk, Finkel, Gurney, Hallo, Hussey, Michel, Schwemer, von Weiher, and Wiseman/Black. 19 Most of the authors included transliterations and translations of the new texts they were publishing, but none of them tried to present a more detailed study of the material, presumably in order not to interfere with, first, Köcher’s, and then, my own work on the corpus. Mention should also be made of the reedition of the Lamaštu texts from Ras Shamra/Ugarit by D. Arnaud (2007: 62–73, 207), which, however, in several respects marks a step backward from their original publication by J. Nougayrol.While, due to the usual distractions of academic life, my own work on the planned edition of the texts often proceeded more slowly than steadily, I was still able to identify a few more Lamaštu texts, which were then integrated into my new edition, and to produce a number of articles on individual aspects of the Lamaštu corpus. These include, among others, a general introduction to Lamaštu and the sources pertaining to her (Farber 1983; cf. also Farber 2007a), a philological and iconographic investigation of the Lamaštu amulets (1987a), and the publications and editions of “Lam.” amulets “Ah” and “Al” (1989c: 98; 1997: 115ff.) and the non-canonical Lamaštu texts “SKS,” “RA” exemplar c, and “FsB” (1989a: pls. 12–15; 1998: 67). At the same time, I made parts of my score transliteration of the texts available to the CAD and several other colleagues who wanted to quote specific passages or phrases from the “Lam.” series. Foremost among them was F. A. M. Wiggermann, to whom we now owe a masterful introduction to Lamaštu and the demonology of which she was a part. 20 In this study, which goes well beyond the brief synthesis I had given in Reallexikon der Assyriologie, he combines textual, pictorial, and comparative information to paint a detailed picture that summarizes most of the information about Lamaštu presently available. Although concentrating mostly on the earlier periods and leaving the final evaluation of the SB texts to a later study that “must await W. Farber’s re-edition of the texts” (Wiggermann 2000: 271 n. 1), this article marks a milestone also for our general understanding of the later texts and the mythology around Lamaštu in the first millennium.More than 160 years after she reappeared from her almost 2,000 years of dormancy, 137 years after her first effect on Assyriology, and 110 years after she became more widely known through Myhrman’s pioneering edition, Lamaštu is finally in for a major check-up and face-lift in the form of a new, and much more complete, text edition. I hope that this rejuvenation will not lead to a resumption of her nefarious activities. But should this be the case, I also trust that the new edition of the incantations and rituals will make it easier to ward her off again.19.

I–III”)Transliteration in Score Format*The arrangement of the “Standard Text” of the canonical “Lam.” series in Part 1 follows the Kuyunjik version and thus is subdivided into the 3 “pirsū,” “Lam. I–III”. For different textual arrange-ments in other first-millennium versions of the series, see above, pp. 17ff.All texts belonging to any of these versions are transliterated as part of the main “score,” 1 fol-lowed by excerpts from the series preserved in the context of other SB genres. These are set apart by space and transliterated in smaller type. Parallel passages from amulets and other independent tradi-tions (including earlier versions) are transliterated separately at the bottom of the page or section, indented and in smaller type.Throughout Part I, sigla in italic generally indicate exemplars in Babylonian script.*Abbreviations and signs used in the transliteration:1 ff. = reconstructed line numbering of edition.I ff. = columns of individual text (single column exemplars of “Lam. I–III”, and all fragments, are also quoted by column (I = obv., II = rev.). Other single-column tablets are quoted by “obv.” and “rev.,” with continous line numbering.1 ff. = line numbering of individual text and/or column.italic indicates restorations of signs of which no traces are left, both free and from parallels (used mostly if no ex-emplar is preserved for the passage but also for major variants that can be safely restored from the remaining signs).. . . . . . = word(s) left out in a particular text (as a variant); also used occasionally within restored passages, if such restoration seems warranted by space.* before transliterated sign = collated (used only with texts published elsewhere and not recopied for this edition).ṿ (dot under vowel) marks superficially damaged signs whose general outline is still visible on the tablet.// + line number = line in parallel version virtually duplicates line in standard version.~ + line number = line in parallel version is similar or comparable to line in standard version.? is used sparingly and is generally omitted when the traces in the copy do not contradict the reading expected from the duplicate(s), even if they would be equally consistent with different readings.CVm signs have been transliterated with mimation in word-final position.e/i: Signs differentiating between /i/ and /e/ (e.g., mi and me) are generally transliterated with their basic value; only in the case of BI and NI have the readings bi/bé and ni/né been adopted according to phonetic context. Signs not differentiating between the two vowels are rendered with /e/ wherever the context requires it.1. Having been credited somewhat incorrectly for inventing the term “Partitur”—that is, “(musical) score” for synoptical transliterations of cuneiform texts (Borger 1991: 50 n. 14; I first heard it from Manfred Weippert)—I think it fits this notation reasonably well: the two axes for continuous / melodic / narrative development, and for synchronic / punctual / harmonic structure in a musical score compare pretty well to the two axes for individual continuous / narrative representation of the exemplars and their punctual / graphemic comparison. I therefore still prefer it over other terms that have been proposed (e.g., Shaffer and Borger: “synopsis” or “interlineare Synopse”; Civil: “textual matrix”).Lamaštu Series I: Transliteration"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition68Lam.

Lam. amulet no. 2 obverse (de Clercq and Ménant 1900: pl. 34)."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"143Transcription and TranslationThe transcription follows the arrangement of the Standard Version in the score transliteration of the Series—that is, the “pirsu recension.”Significant grammatical, lexical, or semantic variants are marked and quoted on the same line on the right margin. Major phonetic variants are indicated in the text (e.g., *taš/sanniš). Minor phonetic variants are not listed.Full transcriptions of older parallel versions (“OA1”, “OB1”, “MB”, and “Ug”) and a few parallel texts showing major divergencies (“Ab1–2”, “Ak”–“Ao”, “Ra”, and “Rc”) are given at the end of the pertinent section, set apart by a rule. The corresponding lines from the main text, whether direct duplicates, or remote parallels, are summarily indicated by “~”. Restorations are indicated here only if they are not immediately apparent from the parallel line(s) in the Standard Version.The gender of predicates and suffixes referring to Lamaštu and other feminine names and nouns has been normalized as feminine; if masculine variants are attested, the ending is given underlined; if all extant duplicates show the masculine form, the ending is doubly underlined.Nasalized dissimilation of double-voiced consonants is indicated in the way closest to the spelling (*inamdin) and not to the probable pronunciation (*inandin, *nag̃giṣṣu etc.)./e/ instead of /i/ has only been used where etymologically justified, even where the spelling seemed more suggestive of /e/.Short case endings are given in the historically expected form, whatever vowel is written. Declin-able proper names are usually transcribed in the nominative case.Sumerian is also given in a normalized transcription, although the experimental character of this has to be stressed. My main intention is to give an approximation of a phonetic rendering for those elements spelled syllabically and at the same time to avoid ambiguity for “homophonic” words written logographically. Therefore, the lexical core of every form, if written in “normal orthography” (i.e., logographically), is transliterated in roman type. Since all formatives (prefixes, suffixes, enclit-ics) are spelled syllabically (i.e., phonetically), they are given in a bound transcription in italics and set apart from the lexical core by hyphens. Whole words that are spelled “unorthographically” (i.e., again syllabically/phonetically) in at least one exemplar are also given in bound transcription and italics, preceded by an asterisk (*). Significant variants of logographic spellings are indicated in the same way as for Akkadian, while purely graphical variants for the phonetic spellings are not listed.Rubric phrases, etc., are rendered in sMall caps, both in transcription and in translation.The translation follows the arrangement of the transcription of the text insofar as feasible.For discussion and translation of individual variants, see the commentary. Parallels transcribed in full are also translated as separate texts, following the pertinent section of the main text, after a rule.Lamaštu Series I: Transcription and Translation"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition144Lam.

On the other hand, translations of complete incantations or longer sections from the corpus and major discrepancies between them and my rendition have been noted.All cross-references to Lamaštu texts edited in this book are marked by the sigla introduced on pp. 45ff. These are always enclosed in double quotation marks. “Lam. I”, “Lam. II”, and “Lam. III” refer directly to the reconstructed text of the series, as edited in Part I. “OB1” 6, “Ah” 17, “OB3“ 5, or “SKS” 8′ are examples of designations for quotations of lines from individual texts transliterated and edited in Part I as parallels to the canonical “Lam.” series or from non-canonical texts edited in Part II. For more details, see the lists and tables under “Manuscript Sources” (pp. 45ff.). References to texts and secondary literature outside this edition follow the style of Borger, HKL I–III, and are always given without quotation marks (e.g., Farber SKS 17; KAR 79, 5; or Thureau-Dangin RA 18, 35:5).Individual variants of the exemplars are discussed whenever they seemed to be of graphemic, linguistic, stylistic, or semantic relevance.For parallel texts that are separately transcribed and translated above, the commentary is merged with that to the appropriate lines of the main text, with line numbers of the parallel indicated in parentheses. The commentary to lines from parallel texts that have no recognizable counterpart in the main text is to be found immediately preceding that to the next line showing a parallel.Quotations and parallels from Tablet III are discussed with the corresponding lines from Tablets I and II wherever possible. Their line numbers are also indicated in parentheses after the pertinent line numbers of “Lam. I” and “Lam. II.” For a concordance of parallel passages, see above, pp. 64–65, Table III.Lam.

Unfortunately, for the most part, not even the correspon-dences between the lines of the OB Sumerian version and the canonical text from the first 1. Texts: TIM 9, 63, 17′–23′ (a) // OECT 5, 55 (b); both texts are OB. Other OB Lamaštu incantations in Sumer-ian or unknown languages have not been included in my edition.

Those with substantial preserved text have been incorporated into the edition as texts “Aa”–”Ag.” Most of these follow the wording of the series quite closely. The two amulets “Ab1” // ”Ab2”, however, diverge significantly and therefore have been transcribed and translated as a separate parallel text.Inc. 1 has been translated by L. Jakob-Rost (Jakob-Rost et al. 1992: 131) and edited recently by Heeßel (2002: 99–100 2), both based on amulet “Ac”.I 1 (+ “Lam. III” 77) The rendition of šumu as “name” is traditional for this line and the follow-ing passage. Note, however, that lines 1–8 do not contain real “names” but rather “iden-tifying features,” “things to call her,” and that even the notion of šumu = “line of a text” or “item” could have played a role here. 3 It is also interesting that the Sumerian parallel reads dd ì m - m e MU d u m u a n . n a. If the sign MU indeed represents šumu = “name” here, as suggested by the later Akkadian parallel, it would be in a syntactically awkward position.In Sumerian context, Lamaštu/Dimme is always called d u m u a n . n a , never *d u m u .m u n u s a n . n a . I translate this “Child-of-An,” although the notion quite certainly is also “daughter” here, as in Akkadian mārat Anu = “Daughter-of-Anu.”In spite of the fact that three amulets (“Ab1”, “Ab2”, and “Ac”) and one exemplar of “Lam. III” 77 (H) write dA-num instead of a n . n a , the first “name” should probably be read in Sumerian. Compare “Lam. I” 70, where Sumerian *D i m m e is also found in Akkadian context and is actually used in contrast to Akkadian Lamaštu.I 2 Amulet “Ad”: “Watchful One of the Gods of the Streets.” Wiggermann 2000: 226 with n. 48, referring to the Sumerian parallel (d)šeš.AN.tur sila/t[u]r uríki. m a quoted above, interprets the “Gods of the Streets” as the “evil utukku-spirits” but gives no further proof for this equation (cf. also Wiggermann 1983: 100 with n. 10, where he translates the Sumerian phrase as “broer [!] van de goden, de zonen van Ur”).2. For some older translations, see Heeßel 2002: 100 n. 8.3. See already Nougayrol 1965: 229f. n. 8, and the translation “Beschwörung” in Myhrman 1902: 155."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition198I 3–8 Amulets “Ab1”//“Ab2” show some major variants here; see translation.I 5 L. Jakob-Rost, in Jakob-Rost et al. 1992: 131, translates “deren Gesicht behaart ist.” I do not know on what reading this is based; Lamaštu’s face is not otherwise described or de-picted as “hairy.”I 6 This line is bothersome. pa-qid qa-ti (no variant phonetic spellings) should refer to Lamaštu but shows the wrong gender; the meaning of the phrase also remains unclear. 4 The variant SUM-at ŠU (“Ab1”//“Ab2” 7) can either be seen as an unusual spelling for *paqdat qāti (so most recently CAD P 115a, based on the Sumerian verb š u - - s u m which regularly cor-responds to Akkadian *pqd) 5 or as still another major textual variant (nadnat or nādinat qāti) of this particular text.In the second half, D. Myhrman’s (Myhrman 1902: 154) reading leqât dIrnina is still valid (see also AHw. 544b), although its meaning remains obscure. 6I 7 L. Jakob-Rost, obviously trying to avoid taking the seventh “name” as a precative 2.f.s., takes sebû with the preceding half line (*lēqât irnini) and thus assumes two “names” in line 6. For the same reason, N. Heeßel argues that the first line contains two “names,” Lamaštu and Mārat Ani. Although the change in syntax assumed in most of the older translations and my own rendering, and the resulting seventh “name” in the form of a precative, do not strike me as features of great stylistic elegance, all extant duplicates break the line right before “seven,” virtually ruling out the proposed new interpretations.F. Köcher 7 read the end of the line in “Ab1” as ⸢tum⸣-[mat], but my collation was un-able to reconcile this or any other plausible reading with the traces still visible on the amulet.I 8 Three texts (C1, “Aa”, and “Ad”) form an unusual precative of the 2.f.s. based on the pres-ent (lū tapparrašī-ma, cf. GAG §81e), while two others (b and “Ac”) use a preterite (lū tapparšī-ma), probably under the influence of the regular precatives based on this tense. I interpret the -ma as marking a threat, with the same general sense as the more common expression *šumma lā verb+subjunctive-ma. 8 “A b1” has instead of the precatives a logo-gram DAL.DAL (no -ma!), which probably represents the imperative itaprašī of the non-passive Ntn stem. 94. AHw. 826b: “in die Hand übergebene”; cf. CAD P 117a paqādu v. 1a (without translation). L. Jakob-Rost, in Jakob-Rost et al. 1992: 131, translates “die in Beschlag nimmt.”5. For further evidence regarding SUM as a logogram for an Akkadian verb ending in /d/, see Geller 1995–96: 246a.6. For more recent attempts to reinterpret the line, see CAD L 136b, where all the texts were emended to read *lēqât unnēni, following the badly written amulet Ab1; Tonietti (1979: 318), who argued in favour of a by-form *irninu to irnittu, while correctly rejecting the emendation proposed in CAD; Cavigneaux and Ismail (1990: 407f.), who read le-qí (according to the photo, the sign in question seems to be ŠU=qat rather than KI=qí ), refrain from interpreting the form as an imperative (*leqe) and instead cope with yet another mistake in gender (translation “Adoptivkind”); and L. Jakob-Rost (in Jakob-Rost et al. 1992: 131), who translates “(die) den Sieg gewinnt.”7. In Köcher’s 1974 manuscript edition of “Lam.”, made available to me by the CAD.8. See, for this phrase, a “threatening curse,” Farber 1975: 177ff.9.

Note, furthermore, that syllabic šerru and logographic LÚ.TUR appear nowhere in our corpus as variants to each other, which speaks also in favor of a reading for LÚ.TUR that is not šerru.I 11–36 For a previous translation of this passage, see W. Farber, in Farber, Kümmel, and Römer 1987: 259f.I 11–13 (+ “Lam. III” 69, 79) The same three introductory lines in Sumerian occur in Inc. 5 (“Lam. I” 100–102). The lines seem to be an abbreviated variant of Inc. 10 (“Lam. II” 129ff.). My translation is influenced by the Akkadian version of that passage.I 14–30 Cf. the translation of these lines by Scurlock (1991: 159).I 14 (+ “Lam. III” 70, 80) gallû is found several times in the Lamaštu series. In “Lam. I” 156 and “Lam. II” 7, variant spellings GAL5.LÁ leave no doubt about the meaning “demon, demonic counterpart” (or even “nemesis”), which is surely also correct in our line and in “Lam. I” 110 (see already Farber 1987a: 102 n. 50; W. Farber, in Farber, Kümmel, and Römer 1987: 259 n. 14a; Farber 2007b: 642f. Cf. also Wiggermann 2000: 229 with n. 76). Thus, the interpretations as qallu B “slave” (most recently CAD Q 66a, quoting our line) or qallu A “(person) of low standing” (CAD Q 63a, quoting “Lam. I” 110) are no longer plausible. For a translation “soldiers” referring to the gallûs in Tiamat’s army, see Wigger-mann 1992: 164.The meaning of *ʾ ḫz Š should be taken literally here, as shown by the corresponding ritual instruction (“Lam. I” 25). The verb, which otherwise is rarely used in its basic mean-ing “to take hold of something” in SB, was probably chosen here because it at the same time is the technical term for “seizing, overcoming” by a demon. The interpretation of CAD Q 66a (“to give in marriage,” followed, for instance, by Wiggermann 2000: 238 with n. 162, and Scurlock 1991: 159) is unlikely. 10 Cf., in more detail, Farber 2007b: 641– 44. 11The presence of dogs in the Lamaštu corpus, both written and pictorial, is very con-spicuous (cf. briefly Farber 1987a: 89 n. 10, and more recently and in more detail, Farber 2007b: 35ff.). The topic needs to be studied in the broader context of dogs in the magico-religious life of Mesopotamia, which would lead well beyond the limits of this text edition. 10. This does not mean that demons can never magically be “married off.” The setting of the “Lam.” ritual, however, is significantly different from the ritual edited by Schwemer (1998: 59ff.; cf. also Farber 2001: 253ff.), where such a mar-riage is described in detail, as well as from the other texts quoted there.11. In “OB3” 9–11 and its OA parallel in Barjamovic and Larsen 2008: 145, 11–15, the synonymity of ṣabātum (OB) and aḫāzum (OA) is obvious, both meaning there “to seize, overcome.”"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition200For a survey of dogs depicted in Mesopotamian glyptic art, some of which are quite com-parable to the ones on the Lamaštu amulets, see Haussperger 1994: 103–10.I 15 In view of the syllabic variant bu-ri (a), the logogram PÚ is read as būru throughout this edition.I 17–20 Text b (and probably also A) writes KIMIN only in the middle of the line but repeats the full form *utammīki at the beginning of a new line, thus proving once more that KIMIN in enumerations such as this is only a graphic abbreviation and that to seek an Akkadian “reading” in these cases is futile. 12I 19 Cf. W. Farber in Farber, Kümmel, and Römer 1987: 259 n. 18a. The mention of Anunītu next to Marduk is a bit surprising, even if taking into account her affinity to childbirth and babies. One of the texts from Babylon (b) thus without much ado changes the name to Ṣarpānītu. The divine couple Marduk and Ṣarpānītu are also to be found in the earlier versions of Inc. 5 (“Ug” II 22′) and Inc. 12 (“MB” II 9) but seem to have in both places been replaced or eliminated in the ‘canonical’ version.I 21+a For the interpretation of this line as a threatening curse, see Farber 1975: 178 (quoted as “Lam. I 20”).TE ÉN as a variant spelling of TU6 ÉN = tê šipti is quite common in our corpus. I inter-pret it as a pseudo-logogram rather than a phonetic rendering *te šipti(ÉN), in view of the consistent spelling without a plene vowel -e, which is otherwise usually seen on construct forms of tû “spell.” For the meaning of the phrase, cf. also the commentary to “Lam. II” 59.I 28 (+ “Lam. III” 115) bitqu (added after šikkat šamni in the NB text a, but not in the Kuyunjik duplicate C1) could be connected with the NB measure bitqu “one-half of a sūtu” (see CAD B 278b), although this has so far not been attested with oil. bitqu also occurs in simi-lar context in “Lam. I” 50 (preserved only in text a). In “Lam. III” 115 (// “Lam. I” 28) and “Lam. III” 122 (// “Lam. I” 50), only the Kuyunjik exemplar C3 is preserved, which again does not have the word bitqu. If bitqu in our NB source refers to the later, smaller sūtu of 6 qa, we would be looking at about 3 liters of oil. This still seems rather high in our context but compares well with the size of šikkatu vessels known from OB texts. 13 See also Farber 1987a: 95f. for a brief discussion of the various kinds of pots and flasks depicted on Lamaštu amulets, which might correspond to the šikkat šamni of the rituals, and cf. now Sallaberger 1996: 83 and pl. 5:1–2.In the Lamaštu corpus, the rituals (“Lam. I” 28 // “Lam. III” 115 and “Lam. I” 50 // “Lam. III” 122) spell šikkatu, 14 wherever preserved, with a determinative GIŠ. In the single occurrence of the word in an incantation (“Lam.

I quote this edition without authors’ names, by line only.Note that “OA1”, while written in OA script and mostly showing Assyrian forms, also contains a number of Babylonianisms, as already pointed out by Michel (1997: 60). Note the following examples: line 3 barbaratum without vowel harmony; line 4 ma-ra-at instead of *me-er-(a-)at; line 6 mūšabūša again without vowel harmony; line 16 me-e instead of *ma-e/i.I 37 (+ “OB1” 1–4, “OA1” 1–4, “Ug” V 15′–17′; “Lam.

I” 105, “Lam. II” 84, “Lam. II” 119, and “RA” 1, there is no indication that UL could ever have been used as a logogram for šamru (or, for that matter, pa/ulḫum). As a matter of fact, there is no variance in any of the spellings in any of the lines in question (compare also the quotes in “Lam. III” 89 and 90, as well as the parallel to “Lam. III” 71 in Ra IV 12–13). See, furthermore, “Lam. II” 35, where text C2 has plain ilat, while text “Ea” adds what must be the negation ul. My translation of the ul as “(although) not being” may be over-interpretive.palḫat “she is to be feared” (“OB1” 1) has no parallels in the later corpus. The cor-responding pulḫat from “OA1” 1 shows that the OA stative/verbal adjective of this verb followed the pattern *purus- instead of *parus-, a phenomenon hitherto usually seen as an Assyrian idiosyncrasy of the root *qrb (for an attempt at a phonetic explanation, see GAG §9e). Note that both *plḫ and *qrb have a liquid as middle radical.amurrât “she is an Amorite woman” (thus probably in “Ug”) also occurs in the other MB text from Ugarit, “RS” 1. This provides a parallel to the text “OB1”, which, however, seems to base the stative not on the nisbe adjective *amurrīum but rather on the base form amurrum, which in OB is often also used for the gentilic (see CAD A/2 94b and Mayer 2008: 94f.). The SB version namurrat “she has an awesome aura, is terrifying” is foreshad-owed by “OA1” 2, which was read na-ma-ra-at 15 by its first editor, Michel (1997: 59, 62), 15.

The form *berberret in “Ug” V 17′ might be a mix-up with birbirrū “radiance,” rather than a phonetic by-form of *barbartu (cf. furthermore “RS” 3, also from Ugarit).I 38–39 (+ “OB1” 5–7, “OA1” 5–8, “Ug” V 18′–19′) For my understanding of kibsu as “track > droppings, dung,” see below, comm. to “Lam.

In line 38a, a restoration kibsi [imēri] seems plausible but unprovable.“OB1” and “OA1” do not give Lamaštu’s preferred resting places as “tracks” of differ-ent animals but instead use single nouns describing types of vegetation here. I understand sassu(m) (“OB1” 5; “OA1” 5), otherwise well known in the meaning “ground, bottom,” as a cognate and synonym of sassatu “grass,” which is mentioned as Lamaštu’s lair in “Lam. II” 121. 17 rītu “meadowland, pasturage” (“OB1” 6) and elpatu(m) “halfa grass(land)” (“OB1” 7; also “OA1” 7, with vowel harmony elpitim) pose no lexical problems. SEAL’s restorations of lines 5 and 7 should be adjusted accordingly.For the correct reading ru-{DU}-ba-sà (*rubas-sa) in “OA1” 8 see Mayer 2003: 241 (pace K. Hecker, in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 64 n. 14; for the two signs to be deleted in lines 6 and 8, cf. already Michel 1997: 62).I 40 (+ “OB1” 8–9, “OA1” 9–13, “Ug” V 20′–21′) Cf. also “Lam. II” 123.The wording of the “OB1” and “OA1” versions is quite different from SB, although the general idea is similar in all three versions. The most striking difference is that “OA1” introduces a human (eṭlam lāsimam) but the other texts all show animals as Lamaštu’s targets here.a-la-ka in “Ug” V 20′ could be understood as an adverbial accusative of the infinitive (“she hinders the ox with regard to walking”), but assuming a mistake for the participle ālika may be a more likely explanation of the form and would keep this text in line with the OB and later traditions. “Ug” V 21′ furnishes the first attestation of *pkr in a 2nd-millennium text and thus contradicts von Soden’s attempts to understand this verb as a loanword from Aramaic pkr (von Soden 1977: 191 and AHw 812a).In “OB1” 9, my collation (in van Dijk, Goetze, and Hussey 1985: 65) showed a clear ṣú. The resulting form šurbuṣu thus should probably be understood as a paronomastic in-finitive, to be followed by the cognate uš[arbaṣ], rather than imēra šurbuba up[akkar?], as 16. Another possibility was proposed by G. Kryszat apud Mayer 2008: 95, who reads na-ku-ra-at. While not backed by other parallels from the Lamaštu corpus, nakkurat “she has become strange/hostile” (D stative of *nkr) would also lend reasonable sense to the passage. The published copy and photo do not allow me to decide whether the sign in question is MA or KU, but K. Hecker insists that the photo he used speaks in favor of -ma-.17. Note that AHw. takes sassatu to be the nomen unitatis to sassu 4; cf. also CAD S 196a and Michel 1997: 62. The context of our line makes this suggestion quite attractive."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"203Lamaštu Series I: Commentarysuggested by Hussey’s copy. A crasis spelling for *šurbuṣ(a)-up[akkar] or a similar phrase cannot, however, be excluded, either.In “OA1” 11, C. Michel, against her own copy, read *māram “son” and based this on the apparent parallelism to eṭlum in the preceding phrase but subsequently could not ex-plain the mention of zibbatum “tail” (Michel 1997: 63). Ford (1999: no. 56) argues for a reading sí-ma-sú “his proper (healthy) appearance” and retains Michel’s māram lāsimam, which he translates “vigorous (lit., ‘swift’) son.” K. Hecker (in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 64 with n. 15) argues in favor of a reading *pá-ra-am “mule,” which would fit the context well as a semantic cognate to emārum “donkey” and a first direct object for the phrase *zibbatam nasāḫum. This comes very close to my own suggestion to emend the text to ⟨e⟩-ma!-ra-am. While providing the same good syntax as Hecker’s reading, it also would give us a true lexical parallel to the OB and SB versions. The final decision between Hecker’s and my suggestions should be based on a collation of the original tablet, since neither copy nor published photo seem to allow a safe distinction between BA and MA in this word (pace Hecker in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 64 with n. 15).I 41–42 (+ “OB1” 9–11, “OA1” 13b–14, “Ug” V 22′–23′) An appropriate translation of paronomastic infinitives is often difficult. Here and elsewhere, I have rather mechanically rendered this construction by adding a reinforcing “really” into the English text.While syntactically parallel to the SB version, “Ug” uses different verbs here (*ḫbl and *šgš instead of *qbr and *npṣ). Since a similar SB passage, “Lam. I” 128–29, reads eṭlūti šuggušu ušaggaš / ardāti ḫubbulu uḫabbal, the direct objects in “Ug” V 22′f. cannot be restored with confidence.I 41 qubburu uqabbar (see also “Lam. II” 124): although qubburu can also mean “to roll up,” the basic meaning “to bury” (same verb?), with its connection to death and burial, seems more appropriate here.I 42 (+ “OA1” 14) With nuppuṣu unappaṣ compare “Lam. I” 130; note that “OA1”, for reasons I do not understand, has the preterite tunappiṣ in this phrase.I 43 (+ “OB1” 12–13, “OA1” 15–16, “Ug” V 24′) See also “Lam. II” 125. Whenever the words are not written syllabically, I have rendered TUR(.MEŠ) as ṣeḫr(ūt)u and LÚ.TUR as šerru. For a more detailed study of words for “baby, small child,” etc., see Farber 1989a: 132ff. The plural forms ṣeḫḫerūtim (“OB1” 10; incorrectly “normal-ized” to read ṣe-eḫ-ru-tim by Wasserman 2003: 89) and ṣaḫḫurūtim (“OA1” 13), both in parallels to line 41, are also noteworthy.The “OB1” and “OA1” versions both have, in lines 12 and 16, respectively, mê BI-IŠ-ri. C. Michel, with a semantic leap that is not easy to follow, connects this expression with a rare synonym *bišru for šerru “baby” 18 and translates “les eaux du foetus > les eaux utérines > le liquide amniotique” (Michel 1997: 63f.). 19 The fact that, unlike “OB1”, “OA1” does 18. Attested only once in “Explicit Malku” I 305 = CT 18, 7 II 2; see now Hruša 2010: 441 and his commentary on p. 287.19. Michel was followed by K. Hecker (in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 64); the same argumentation is repeated, without credit to Michel, by Wasserman (2003: 89 n. 126)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition204not allow for a reading of the sign IŠ as /í Z/, excludes a connection with biṣru, a by-form of biṣṣūru “female genitals” (see CAD B 269a ad KAR 466:7), which might have led in a similar direction. I thus normalize the phrase as mê pišri and translate it “water/liquid of dissolution,” which then might mean something like “agent of complete destruction.” 20 The addition of the particle of direct speach, -mì in “OA1”, if this interpretation of the sign is correct, 21 might also be seen as an indication that this phrase is a verbatim quo-tation of an idiomatic phrase presumably familiar to the native speaker from a different context.The term used in “Ug” and in the SB version, mê pušqi, literally means “water of nar-rowness/difficulty/constriction” (see also “Lam. I” 131 and “Lam. II” 125). pušqu “tight, narrow place or situation” could also refer, with double allusion, to the physical “narrow-ness” of the mother’s pelvis and the notion of difficulty, danger and “tightness” at the crucial moment of birth. 22 Note that the root *pšq is also used as the general term for hard or difficult labor in childbirth. 23 mê pušqi thus could conceivably stand for the amniotic fluid (a notion that I consider unlikely for mê BI-IŠ-ri of the older versions; see above). The drinking of this could be seen as a reason for stillbirth or illness of the new-born. The parallel would, however, not fit too well with the fact that, according to “OB1” and “OA1”, Lamaštu forces the “big ones (grown-ups)” (rabbûtim) or “old people” (šībūtim) to drink mê pišri. 24 Finally, the only reference to mê pušqi known to me outside the Lamaštu corpus, IV R2 59/2, 24 ([kīma ] kurunni aštati A.MEŠ PAP.ḪAL u dim[ti]) does not have anything to do with babies, and mê pušqi šatû here seems to be an idiom for “being in deep trouble and distress.” 25 I thus assume that a similar meaning “to bring about distress” is also intended for mê pušqi šaqû in our passage.I 44–45 (+ “Ug” V 25′–28′) See also “Lam. II” 126–27.If the previous phrase is already hard to understand, these two lines still defy any con-sistent interpretation. Taking all variants from Kuyunjik and Ugarit into account (“OB1” and “OA1” do not contain corresponding lines), the readings of all but one word, luDpeš, 20. For *pšr “to dissolve (in a liquid),” cf. for example the expression mû pāširūtu (AHw. 945a; see Maul 1994: 88 with n. 45) and AHw. 843a: pašāru(m) D 1. The only other word consistent with the spellings would be bis/šru “a kind of leek.” In spite of the fact that the sap of plants is known as mû in Akkadian and the possibility that “leek juice” might have been considered unpleasant even in ancient Mesopotamia, this, I am sure, cannot be the intended meaning.21. Michel (1997: 63) understands the spelling as a mistake for ta-ša-qí-a-*am, and Mayer (2003: 232), without further comment, transcribes *tašaqqiam(e). For another example of /-mi/ in an OA incantation, see Farber 1996: 71f. In both cases, the use of the particle could be interpreted as a Babylonianism. For a new look at the usages and meaning of the particle -mi in OB, see now Wasserman 2012: 179ff.22. An otherwise unknown term for “womb, female genitalia” that ends in /q/ seems to be attested in §55 of the MA Laws. Roth (1997: 174) has restored the word as [puš]qa(?) and translates it “womb(?),” but CAD has not followed this interpretation (see CAD P 346a, where the text remains unrestored). 23. See Stol 2000: 129. 24. For a recent discussion of the two terms, see Wiggermann 2000: 231 with n. 93; he takes the meaning of mê pišri/pušqi as “fluids produced during birth giving” for granted. An interpretation of mê pušqi as “urine” had earlier been proposed by Nougayrol (1969: 401 n. 62) and accepted by Wiggermann (1983: 105; cf. already Meissner 1932–33: 58b), but there seems to be no solid textual support for this interpretation.25. Note that CAD P 544a actually translates mê pušqi in just this reference as “water of distress (amniotic fluid?).”"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"205Lamaštu Series I: Commentaryare unambiguous. luDpeš most certainly should be taken as a 1.c.s. precative, parallel to lūmur(ši), but no suitable verbal root *Dpš seems to exist in Akkadian. There remains the possibility that the final /š/ is actually an apocopated pronominal accusative and that the root thus could be a transitive III-weak verb. In this case, the form could be from *ṭpī “to lay out/on, to make an addition,” but again no plausible sense emerges.The tertium comparationis, the “bristle at the kidney(s) of the sky,” remains obscure. zappu “bristle” is, of course, also the Akkadian name of the Pleiades, while kalītu “kidney” is used to name or describe several heavenly bodies, including the planets Mercury and Mars, the gibbous moon, and a star or constellation yet to be identified (see CAD K 76). One text, Virolleaud AChSin 3, 7–8, actually seems to equate the Pleiades, zappu(MUL.MUL), with kalītu. The compound kalīt šamê seems, however, not to be otherwise attested, and I am unable at this time to come up with an explanation of our phrase based either on astronomical observation or on a figurative usage playing on the astronomical connota-tions of the words.“Ug” V 25′–27′ probably contained some kind of parallel to our phrase, and the few remaining signs should fit a reconstruction of this kind. I thus take AŠ KA KUR at the end of 26′ as ina ka-lat, restoring [šamê] at the beginning of 27′ and accepting the unusual feature of a construct chain split over two lines. J. Nougayrol, reading ina ka-šad but fac-ing the same difficulty (1969: 401 n. 63), also considered a reading ina pî māti. Van Soldt (1991: 14 and 456 n. 176) retains Nougayrol’s reading ina ka-šad, but then takes this to be an endingless status rectus form of the infinitive kašādu. All of these renderings have to ac-cept an unusual spelling AŠ = ina that is otherwise not attested in “Ug”, and none of the solutions makes really good sense in the given context. One thus might also consider an ancient copying mistake (omission of šamê) and a subsequent reinterpretation of the line by the Ugaritic scribe to explain the confusion.I 45 (+ “Ug” V 27′) See also “Lam. II” 127.The exact sense of rubûta šakānu is not clear to me; neither of the dictionaries has at-tempted a translation of the phrase. 26 šakānu + abstract object normally means “to estab-lish, cause, bring about, define,” but in our line a meaning like “bring into action, make good use of ” seems to make better sense.“OA1” 17–22 contains an Assyrian rendering of the traditional šiptum ul jâttum for-mula, which thus in this case could be what the other texts left out and only indicated through the abbreviative rubrics TE.ÉN, TU6.ÉN.É.NU.RU, and TU.EN.NU.RU. Note-worthy are the phonetic renderings of Ningirima as a male god Nikkilil (see already Michel 1997: 64 with n. 24, with an important reference to Krebernik 1984: 293), and the phrase anāku alqe “I took” replacing the more common anāku ušanni “I repeated.” 27I 47–52 Until recently, these lines had to be largely restored from the parallel in “Lam. III” 119–26, and the line divisions were adjusted to fit the shorter lines of “Lam. I.” I have kept the hypothetical line breaks in place even after exemplar “Ee” virtually closed the gap and it 26. Most recently, CAD R 401b quotes the passage without translation. 27.

This allowed me to avoid a complete renumbering of the lines of the remainder of “Lam. I”, since I have used these line numbers for many years when quoting this text.I 48 (+ “Lam. III” 120) For the restoration t[ukattam] in “Lam. III” 120, see the commentary there. For the second half of the line, cf. Farber 1987a: 99 n. 41. Text “Ee”, as well as the par-allel in “Lam.

III” 121) tunamdassi (with variants tunamtassi and tunaddassi from “Lam. III” 121) is difficult. While AHw. posits an otherwise unattested verb nuddušu “hineinstechen” and takes the suffix *-ši to refer to the garment, CAD N 41 lists our passage under nadādu D, with an ad hoc translation “to comb,” which does not make much sense to me in the con-text of our ritual. If Oppenheim Dreams 329, 61 (šumma ṣilli gišimmari nen-du-ud) indeed contains an N stative of the same verb, the final radical should be d, and the form should be analyzed as an intensive D to an otherwise unattested G of the same meaning; the dream omen has, however, not been listed in CAD N 41 (but see CAD Ṣ 193b). On the other hand, final /š/ could be backed up by MSL 9, 137:685 (quoted CAD N 61a): ŠÌR = na-da-šum. Here, ŠÌR could be read as KIRID, and a connection between the verb and KIRID = kirissu “pin” could be postulated. In either case, a translation “to prick, pierce” seems conceivable but remains a guess that is possibly biased by what looks like a parallel to well-known voodoo practices. See now also Schwemer 2007b: 210–14; he quotes fur-ther evidence, both textual and archaeological, for the piercing of magical figurines with a ṣilli gišimmari “leaf thorn” (“Blattstachel”) of the date palm, without reference to our text.I 50 (+ “Lam.

III” 44–45) For the relationship between ḫallutanû, ṣulum PAP.ḪAL imēri, and ṣulum ša ḪAL(.LA) imēri, see CAD Ḫ 48a. All these expressions seem to mean more or less the same, “black (spot/hair) on/from the hind leg of a donkey.” This explains why, with the exception of this one passage, they never occur side-by-side. My guess is that the compiler of our text ended up including two variants from different sources in his main text.The Akkadian equivalent of PAP.ḪAL is not always clear. In addition to its use for pušqu (see above, comm. to “Lam. I” 43, and below), it usually stands for purīdu “leg” but on occasion must also be read pa(p)ḫallu “thigh,” as evidenced by the spelling variants PAP(pa4?)-ḫal-la/li in “Lam. II” 116 (and 116*), “Lam. III” 44, and elsewhere (see already CAD Ḫ 48a). These variants are too numerous to be brushed away as mistakes, as AHw. 880b s.v. purīdu tried to do, arguing for a reading *ṣulum purīd imēri. paḫallu “thigh,” prob-ably a loanword from Sumerian, is also well attested in plain syllabic spellings (AHw. 810a). The difficulties in Akkadian reflect a similar problem in Sumerian, where the ex-act phonetics of the term and the relationship between p a ḫ = purīdu “leg,” ḫ a l = ḫallu"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"207Lamaštu Series I: Commentary“thigh,” and p a p ḫ a l (equated in LL with purīdu and pušqu but never with paḫallu) still have to be worked out in detail. The association p a p ḫ a l = pušqu may, by the way, have also played a role in the selection of ṣulum paḫalli imēri as one of the ingredients of the ritual to accompany an incantation which quite prominently refers to mê pušqi (see above, “Lam. I” 43 and comm.).I 60 For ina NE tuqattar (and the similar phrases ina NE ašāgi / eʾri tuqattar), several different readings and interpretations have been proposed:1. ina išāt(i) (ašāgi/eʾri) tuqattar “you fumigate, using fire (of a./e.)” (AHw. 907b; CAD E 319b; CAD I/J 232a);2. ina NE tuqattar “you fumigate in . . .” (CAD Q 167f.; see P 325b, where qutri, qutrinni, or penti are offered as possible readings of NE);3. ina qutrīni tuqattar “you fumigate in an incense offering” (CAD Q 325b);4. ina pēnti (ašāgi) tuqattar “you fumigate, using (ašāgu) embers” (CAD A/II 409f.; Mayer 1978: 453, accepted in ABZ2 p. 423 (supplement to no. 172, see now also MZL no. 313); Stol 1998: 350; but cf. also ina NE ašāgi “in smoke? of a.” (CAD Q 322a).With pēnti ašāgi attested several times in syllabic spellings and several references where NE needs to be a pourable commodity, NE should probably be read pēntu “embers” (and not išātu “fire,” qutrinnu “incense offering,” or qutru “smoke”) in all cases, even though an entry NE/IZI/DÈ = pēntu seems to be absent from the lexical lists. At the same time, ana IZI tanaddi, read ana išāti tanaddi in CAD Q 167b and elsewhere, should probably also be understood as ana pēnti tanaddi “you throw onto embers.” The reading NE = qutrīnu (and the tentative translation NE = “smoke”) proposed by CAD P and Q should be abandoned.I 61 This line should, by dint of elimination, be parallel to “Lam. III” 67, in which case the first ingredient should be azallû. The first sign of the line in c is, however, clearly saḫ and not ú, leading to a probable reading saḫlê “cress.” This pungent herb, on the other hand, does not seem to be a fitting ingredient for a salve. Only a new duplicate can show whether its mention here is due to a scribal mistake.I 62–92 Lines 62–80 only have been translated by Haas (1986: 144f., from F. Köcher’s manuscript edition), and the whole spell by Foster (1993: 867f., from previously published sources). Foster’s restoration of the beginning of the spell is, however, based on Myhrman’s edition and no longer tenable.I 62 (+ “Lam. III” 82) The beginning has been restored and emended according to “Lam.

CAD A/II 143f. does not make it clear enough that the emphasis is specifically on the heat created by, or surrounding, the “at-mospheric phenomenon,” as is also shown by the equations with akukūtu, išātu, and nablu (see, however, the important note on p. 144a, suggesting a meaning “wildfire,” which seems to fit many usages of a.).I 63–68 These lines have been translated by Heeßel (2002: 74f.).I 63–64 While spoiling (or discarding) valuable substances like the “root of the licorice tree” and the “seeds of the šunû (= chaste tree?)” makes sense in this context, the reference to “fruit"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition208(mutḫummu) of the ṣarbatu tree” is more problematic. The study announced by Nougayrol (1969: 396 n. 21), which was to prove that ṣarbatu is actually the maple has, as far as I know, never appeared, and I thus continue to use the traditional translation “poplar” with-out committing myself to any subspecies of the genus. 28 Undoubtedly, the ṣarbatu was a valuable tree, but its importance lay mainly in its wood, used as timber, woodworker’s ma-terial, and fuel. Its sap and foliage were used in medicine, but its fruit (zēru and inbu) had little value and in fact are only attested in dream omens that have questionable relation to reality. Although mutḫummu is equated with inib kirî “fruit of an orchard” in synonym lists, its meaning seems to be somewhat different (see, for instance, Maximilian Streck 1916: 90 X 105 = Borger 1996: 74 A X 105, where inbu and mutḫummu complement each other). m. thus might have included the lush appearance of the foliage as well, the loss of which would indicate that the tree was dying. 29I 65–66 The use of the preterite (followed in 65 by a second preterite and in 66 by a perfect) in what otherwise would appear to be a descriptive narrative is unusual but occurs again in the structurally similar passage “Lam. I” 179–86. I take it to be a generalizing statement that literally means “when she will have done xx, she will have achieved yy,” which then leads me to the translation “by doing x, she (always) achieves y.” Note that “Lam. I” 181 and 183 in fact repeat our two lines almost verbatim, with 181 changing the tense from iškun (preterite, line 55) to the perfect ištakan, thus making both lines syntactically parallel.I 67 I understand Lamaštu’s descriptive name pasus(s)atu as an unusual usage of the nominal pattern *parussat- from *pss “to eradicate, eliminate,” semantically based on a participle rather than an adjective. Heeßel (2002: 74f.) follows the more traditional analysis as an abstract noun “Vertilgung.” 30 Wiggermann (2000: 231 n. 102), on the other hand, trans-lates “cripple” and refers the reader to a still unpublished study proving this. As Heeßel has pointed out, the word could well be a pun on the name of Pazuzu (of still unknown etymology).I 68 For anqullu, see above to line 62. The variant [ . . . ](-)gu-la (b) could be the result of a mixup between anqullu and dGu-la, although this does not seem to make much sense in our context.I 69–70 The differentiation between Lamaštu and ddim10–11. m e is certainly artificial but shows that her Sumerian name (probably to be pronounced /dimme/) was still well-known and deemed magically potent, even in post-Sumerian times.28. See Postgate 1992: 183 for the suggestion that ṣ. is actually Populus alba or nigra, rather than the Euphrates pop-lar; note that the common identification with Populus euphratica is based solely on an Arabic etymology and thus rather tenuous. 29. Haas’s reading of these two lines, picturing Lamaštu as the destroyer of human fertility, is no longer tenable. For a similar, although badly broken, passage also using tabāku for the spoiling and destroying of trees and their yield, see the Pazuzu incantation Borger 1987: 17 = Heeßel 2002: 57, 10–11. 30.

Although I prefer to see Ea as the “creator of everything,” the rare epithet might have triggered the use of tīd kullati in the accompanying ritual (“Lam. I” 94), or vice versa. In our line, the consistent spelling ba-an (kullati) in all three surviving exemplars, contrasting with equally consistent ba-nu-ú (kibrāti) in line 83, both in pausal position, is noteworthy, although I am unable to explain it. Note that bānû kullati in Farber BID 134, 125 and 185, 37 is always spelled with final /û/ and that this is at the beginning of the lines and not in pause. A detailed study of the construct forms of III-weak participles is a desideratum.I 87 abrakkat É.KUR should probably not be directly connected with the Ekur in Nippur (but cf. below, line 89), because no specific affinity of Ninkarrak with that temple or city is oth-erwise known: see now Goodnick Westenholz 2010a: 377– 405. 31 If we take É.KUR as the logogram for Akkadian ekurru “temple,” the epithet abrakkat ekurri could—with a general-izing singular, as in bēlet šipti and similar epithets—mean “who keeps (all) temple(s) in or-der.” Compare also Gula’s statement abrakkāku “I am a (female) steward” (Lambert OrNS 36: 120:65, Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-Rabi), without connection to any specific temple.I 89 Following AHw. 1400b, CAD U/W 15f., and the evidence from Enūma eliš, I take the KI after *Ubšukkina as an Akkadian ending (though with wrong case vowel) rather than as the determinative for place names. Whether É.KUR in this line actually refers to the fa-mous temple in Nippur or should again be read as a generic noun ekurru “temple” remains unclear (see also above, line 87, with commentary).I 90 Cf. Farber 1975: 178 (quoted as “Lam. I 78”).I 95–96 (+ Lam. III” 131–32) Cf. Farber 1987a: 95 (quoted as “Lam. I 93//III 102”).I 100–102 See commentary to “Lam. I” 11–13.I 103 (+ “Lam.

For a possible connection of the word with the strange headgear, which looks like a little sack on a stick, depicted on some Lamaštu amulets, see Farber 1983: 444a. 32 The relationship of the noun upru to the verb apāru G/D “to put something on the head” also remains uncertain, and the fact that they are occasionally used in what looks like a figura etymologica may well be a result of popular etymology. To complicate matters, by-forms of u. seem to include a nisbe-like uprû and a feminine upurtu (see AHw. 1425f.; CAD U/W 189 and 193). The difficult passage King CCEBK 26,3, with an enigmatic reference to the Elamites(!), most recently listed in CAD U/W 17a as a separate lemma uburtu “(mng. unknown.),” might also belong here.I 104 Here, the Nineveh scribes by mistake included a former editorial gloss in the main text: uṣṣâm-ma “she comes forth and” is to be understood as originally a variant to īlâm-ma “she came up and,” correctly marked as such in the copied original by the word šanîš “otherwise” (for this, see CAD Š/I, 387a). Modern scholars followed the wrong lead of Aššurbanipal’s scribes, bending over backward to make sense of this line (Falkenstein 1931: 9; AHw. 1164a) or giving up on it (CAD Š/I, 386b). The omission of the phrase in texts m and “Sb” proves the point.I 104–5 The sequence “preterite + -ma + stative” (īlâm-ma ezzet, etc.) is closely related to the better-known sequence “preterite + -ma + present” (type illik-ma ibakki; see in more detail below, commentary to “Lam. II” 92). The latter means “he came (while) weeping”—that is, the present verb describes a simultaneous action defining the circumstances of the main predicate of the narrative (usually in the preterite). If, however, the circumstances are not seen as a separable action but as a state (both long-term or temporary), the stative is used istead of the present tense: “she came up being fierce.” As a convenient term for the construction, “circumstantial phrase” seems appropriate.I 105 In “Sb”, the signs could be just as well read kab-[t]a-at (the traces in C1 are even more inconclusive). Although wounds, illnesses, and punishment are often described as kabtu “severe,” I have not yet encountered this adjective used negatively to describe humans or demons and thus prefer gapšat “she is overbearing.”The traces in text m line 7 are inconclusive and are not easily reconcilable with the text of the other duplicates.I 106 Restored after “RA” line 3. Cf. also Farber 1989b: 230. J. Nougayrol’s remarks about this line (1965: 232 n. 12) suggesting a corruption zû > (an)zû, are too speculative to be helpful.I 107 All readings are very tentative. In the second half, text m might have to be read [r]u?-bu-us-su ra-[ ] “her lair is . . .

Note, however, that there is no textual evidence suggesting that upru/ū (the logogram of which, túgballa, in-cludes the determinative for textiles) had any wooden or metal parts. Without mentioning my suggestion about upru, Wiggermann (2000: 245 n. 192) prefers a connection between the headgear on the amulets and the word qannu, which occurs once in the Lamaštu corpus (“RA” 17)."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"211Lamaštu Series I: Commentaryand the following line, “Lam. I” 107–8). The traces in D1, however, if read correctly, seem to argue in favor of the interpretation adopted in the transcription and translation.I 108 For parallels to this line, a stock phrase in Akkadian literature, see most conveniently CAD M/I 237a and M/II 252a. ṣilli dūri “shadow of the wall” must surely have a negative connotation here, and my translation attempts to capture that nuance. Grammatically, it remains unclear whether the pre-suffixal vowel /u/ in manzazUša and mūšabUša is to be viewed as morphologically long (as in my transcription and translation), thus represent-ing a plural ending, or simply as an epenthetic vowel for an unusual pausal(?) form of the construct before suffixes.I 109 For the restoration of the first half of this line, cf. “OB2” 5: ṣuprātim arrakat. The restora-tion of the second half is based on gulibāt šaḫāti “shavings from the armpit,” attested sev-eral times in magical context (see CAD Š/I 84a).I 110 For gallât, see comm. to “Lam. I” 14. The end of the line remains unrestorable.I 111–13 Reading [a]na epšētīša lā banâti in line 112, I suggested some years ago that Lamaštu might have been sent down from heaven in order to do mischief, instead of having been dispelled from heaven because of her bad behavior (Farber 1983: 445a). Wiggermann repudiated my earlier view, 33 and the new variant ina epšētīša (“Sb”) seems to prove him right.I 112 Cf. also “SKS” 1: Lamaštu ištu šamê urdam-ma “Lamaštu came down from heaven.”I 113 For negated parakka nadû “to provide no place of worship,” compare Reiner and Güter-bock 1967: 259, NB16.The restoration at the end of the line is uncertain; another option might be ina q[ereb šamê], or some similar phrase.I 114 W. Meinhold informs me that her collation of the last sign of this line in exemplar m yielded an unequivocal, though damaged, *LÍL, thus proving Falkenstein’s restoration kīma lil[î/īti ipparraš] (Falkenstein 1931: 9) to be at least partially correct. Unfortunately, lilû is not otherwise attested as “flying around,” and I therefore still hesitate to accept his restoration of the predicate (see also the cautious remarks by Wiggermann 2000: 228 with n. 67).I 115–16 The difference between true narrative (usually preterites) and generalizing statements (usually statives or presents) is often blurred in “Lam.”; see above, comm. to “Lam. I” 65–66; below, “Lam. I” 137ff., and passim. In spite of the clear preterite itūr in 116 (the verb in 115 is restored as a preterite after this parallel), I thus assume that these two lines already belong to the following description of Lamaštu’s nefarious actions against mothers-to-be.I 115 The restoration of the final verb is the crux of this line. Whether sadāru “to place in a row,” also in temporal sense “to do time and again,” is close or even correct can only be demonstrated by a new duplicate.33.

Lacking corrobora-tive evidence, the line should, however, not be used as proof that pregnant women would normally be expected to stay in separate, and thus more vulnerable, rooms of the house or that access to their dwelling space was generally blocked. In any case, I take itūr as the basic verb of motion forming a hendiadys with the preceding [isdir] “[doing it time and again], she returns/ed to” (note also the word order, with the predicate of line 115 in final position and the one of 116 in initial position, which brings them even closer together). The translation of 116 in CAD N/II 176a, “she turned into? a woman whose entrance . . .” seems less attractive, especially since nērebu is the “(point of) entrance,” not the “(act of) entrance.”I 117 (+ “Ug” I 1′) and 119 manû “to count” is i/i-class in text n, but “Ug” and m show the more common u/u vocalism.I 120 The context makes it likely that nadât(i ) should be a transitive stative with Lamaštu as the subject. An alternative rendering “a spell is cast” (*nadât šiptu) can, however, not be excluded. The traces in text m 34 suggest a text different from n and do not help to clarify the phrase. 35I 120–21 Parallels to this couplet are “Lam. II” 90–91 and “Lam. II” 139– 40; cf. also “RA” 10–11 and the remotely similar phrases in “Emar” 3f. and 29.I 121 This line contains a classic example of a simple hinge construction, with mārīkina used as the direct object to the two syntactically unrelated predicates bilāni and lušēniq.I 122 (+ “Ug” I 4′) “Ug” has the interesting variant luttarru, which parallels “RA” 11: luttarra/i. I understand the form as a Gtn precative of tarû “to lift up, cradle (a baby), to act as a nurse or babysitter (tārītu)” (see Farber 1989b: 230 n. 23). For the corresponding Gtn participle muttarrû, see “RA” 14.I 123 The end of the line seems to be garbled in both extant duplicates (n and m). 36 If katimta is indeed the correct reading of the final word, it is tempting to see it as a reference to the rare katimtu net (CAD K 306f.; the use of the verb *nšī both in our line and in BWL 216 III 43 could be seen as reinforcing this connection), but because a “net” is not easily incorporated into an enumeration of terms for hot and cold temperatures, the syntax and overall meaning of the line remain obscure.34. Falkenstein (1931: 9 n. 8) read x-is-sa. The preceding signs are erased (see copy), and the last word may also have been writen over a hasty erasure, so that a reading [ši-pa]-{a}-as?-{x}-sa might be considered. My collation remains inconclusive.35. I do not know on what reading J. Scurlock based her translation of the line: “For the lying-in women giving birth (this) is (her) spell” (Scurlock 1991: 156).36.

I believe that both terms reflect unpredictability and randomness, with emphasis on space (*zâzu) and time (*surri), respectively.I 128–31 For similar passages, see above, “Lam. I” 41– 43 (with commentary), and below, “Lam.

Note, however, that in the comparable passage in “OB3” 6–8, ṣerrum occurs twice as “pivot.”It remains doubtful whether “Ug” I 8′–9′ actually contained parallels to this and the following line. If so, the mimation at the end of 8′ would be rather unusual for this text, and we also would have to assume that this text wrote iḫallup(a) ṣerrāniš only once in line 7′. If the trace at the end of 9′ actually is the remainder of an AŠ, another indented line would have contained the end of 135, panīša.I 135–39 These lines may possibly contain allusions to funerary rites, although distorted and turned into evil demonic actions for the purpose at hand.I 136 For a convincing identification of the yellow paste kalû as “(yellow) ochre,” see Stol 1978: 12f., 1998: 347f.I 140 The reading of the word preceding dudināša is uncertain, since only one ambiguous sign (TUR) is preserved. My restoration of nimru (PIRIG.TUR) “leopard” is based on the apparent parallelism of this line with the following, which compares bodily features of Lamaštu to those of animals (for another passage likening her small of the back to that of a leopard, see “Lam. II” 37). Note, however, that dudināša is primarily the dual of dudittu “fibula” (see commentary to “Lam. I” 197), and a secondary meaning as a part of the body is otherwise unattested. The apparent parallel may thus be misleading, and the restoration altogether wrong.I 143 The exact meaning of kirimmu is still debatable. In spite of the discussions by Falkenstein (1931: 9 n. 29), Landsberger (1960: 113ff.), and CAD (K 406), I think that at least some occurrences of k. indeed refer to an area or specific part of the body, most probably the bosom; 37 this seems to be inevitable, especially in Gilg. I 180 38 and also in the context of our passage. The meaning “bosom hold, cradling position” then should be a secondary derivation from there, not the other way round (against Falkenstein 1931: 9 n. 29). Note 37. See most clearly in the omen commentary Hunger, SpTU I 41:8, where the phrase ina kirimme ummišu is ex-plained as ina tulê ummišu.38. See also the commentary by George (2003: 796), who sees k. as “the folded arm which typically cradles a nursing baby.” Based on CAD D 136, he then argues for a further extension of the meaning, to include “the overgarment behind which a babe in arms might be held for shelter and nursing.” A k. garment (written with the determinative TÚG) actu-ally seems to be attested in an OB letter (Stud.Ebl. 2, 49:5); see CAD Š/II 59b."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition214also that the main support in favor of this transferred meaning comes from the lexical equation with l i r u m/ŠU.KAL and KÉŠ, while few if any contextual attestations unam-biguously call for such an interpretation. With the exception of the Gilgameš passage mentioned above, there is no indication that k. was ever seen as sexually important or attractive. In this respect, it is also interest-ing that in Borger 1969: 5, 35– 43 the mušēniqtu “wet-nurse” is described by allusions to her irtu “breast, mammae,” while the description of the kirimmu is tied to the tārītu “baby-sitter,” as first noted by Falkenstein (1931: 9 n. 29). In KAR 62:13, a male adversary is said to have a k. (here = “arm hold”?), and most other contexts refer simply to the loving care of a mother, bringing up her child “at/in her kirimmu.” The use of verbs like uššuru, paṭāru, and rummû in connection with k., most recently quoted in CAD as an argument against AHw.’s “Armbeuge,” does in itself not exclude a region of the body, since all these verbs are occasionally also attested with other body parts (compare, for instance, ipṭur irta in “FsB” 5).I 144 The restoration [šizba ša mūt]i was first suggested to me by T. Frymer-Kensky and is partially backed by “Ug” I 5′; unfortunately, the traces of the first two signs in this text, however, remain inconclusive (Arnaud 2007: 63 reads [ši]z?- but on p. 71 discusses the problems of this reading). Assuming a scribal error in the Ugarit text (rukkukā for rummukā, 39 see also CAD R 168), Nougayrol (1969: 395) already drew attention to the parallel between the two lines but stopped short of the reading proposed here. I am unaware of šizbu ša mūti (or šizib mūti) in any other text. 40I 145 “RA” 5 (uššurat peressa buttuqā dīdāša) might suggest a restoration [but]tuq ṣertu ina tulêša “the nipple on her breast has been [cut] off,” but the general context of the two lines is quite different. To postulate such a parallel would, furthermore, hinge on the very doubtful etymology of dīdu as a Semitic word for “breast” (see CAD D 136a) and a reinterpretation of Gilg. I 188, where the garment(?) dīdu replaces kirimmu (cf. above, commentary to line 143), which appears in line Gilg. I 180.I 146 The second half of the line, although now finally epigraphically clear (cf., formerly, Borger 1971: 67a, 1975: 230 for the correct reading of the verb) remains unclear. Since lasāmu is intransitive, Bur-rat/ra-tú can only be the subject of ilassum or an adverb qualifying it. For neither case can I offer parallels or clarification.I 147 Cf. “OB2” 14 rapaški(m) ṣerrum (wordplay on ṣērum!). Note, however, that the reading EDIN = ṣēru “steppe” in our line is not quite certain and that *rpš is usually i/i class; u/u vocalism is otherwise only once attested in the difficult muḫḫašu irappuš TDP 222, 4f. A connection with the rare verb rabāšu (u/u), otherwise only attested in OA and of unclear meaning, can thus not be definitively excluded.39. Arnaud (2007: 71) assumes a playful spelling, using the Sumerian value mu4 for KU, and compares the same usage in the colophon of RS 23.034.40.

If, on the other hand, the passage describes some kind of demonic entourage of Lamaštu, a slight emendation here and a subsequent reading ina “at” in all three lines seems plausible.I 155–60 Cf. Farber 2007a: 141 with n. 25.I 155–56 In translating balu xx as “(although) not being xx,” I am following a suggestion by F. A. M. Wiggermann, 41 who based his understanding of this couplet on Sumerian phrases such as a b g a l n u . m e . a s í g . b a r. r a “(although) not being an apkallu, he has long hair.” My for-mer translation of line 156 “If there is no counterdemon (to stop her)” (Farber 1987a: 102 n. 50) seems to me now less convincing. A third possibility would be “without permission of xx,” a nuance of balu well attested in other texts. In any case, the general sense of the passage is that Lamaštu does not hesitate to overstep her “rights” by killing her victims, something otherwise reserved for death itself or for the gallû demons, 42 whose close affili-ation with the netherworld is otherwise well attested and who are often seen leading or dragging their victims into the “Land-of-No-Return.”I 156 napišta turru seems to be used here as an idiom for killing, literally parallel to German “jmdm. den Hals umdrehen” = “to wring somebody’s neck.” The expression is also attested in ARM 14, 5:17 and 6:28, where it is figuratively used for the killing of an ox (see AHw. 1335a and CAD N/I 304 a, with slightly different interpretations).I 158ff. These lines contrast the socially correct house burials of children, with Lamaštu ordering the plain abandonment of their dead bodies outside the range of civilization. Whether this in fact reflects specific burial customs for babies who were deemed Lamaštu victims because they died during the first few days after birth I see no way to prove.I 159 Literally, “like one who is storing provisions.”I 160 The Akkadian text uses a hinge construction in which ana ṣēri connects both with lilqû and līzibu.The apparent mimation in (līzibū)šuM-ma, where an accusative (and not a dative) suffix is warranted by syntax, may be a proleptic dittography, caused by šumma “if ” in the following line.I 161 This line is very difficult. Taken at face value, lu-še-ṣu-ú-šú should be a 1.c.s. precative in subjunctive + suffix. In a šumma clause, the subjunctive should indicate an oath, but the precative strongly contradicts this interpretation. I thus prefer to see the form as a sandhi writing for *lū ušēṣûšu (or ušeṣṣûšu) “they indeed brought/ bring him out” (an emending transliteration of the one extant text, D1, to lu ⟨ú⟩-še-ṣu-ú-šú would yield practically the same result).The second problem is posed by miḫru. The meaning of the noun in this context should probably correspond to the cognate precatives in lines 162–66, but with the fur-ther possibility of double entendres. The spelling lim-ḫu-ra ṣe-e-ni in 163 at first seems to 41. Letter of Nov. 14, 1994. Cf. now also Wiggermann 2000: 229 n. 76.42. For the term gallû, see also comm. to “Lam.

Another possibility, however, is to see limḫura as a ventive singular used in variance with the non-ventive form for stylistic reasons not apparent to me. Line 166 actually bolsters this interpretation, since lim-ḫur la-a-ti can only be correct if lâti (fem.pl., again formally an oblique case!) is the object; the evidence from the remaining lines is inconclusive. This makes it possible, and I think even probable, that lines 161–66 are all based on the idiom miḫru xx imḫur “an unforeseen incident/mishap/accident happened to xx / befell xx” (see CAD M/II 59f.). Thus, miḫru in 161 would be the grammatical subject of all the following precatives, and the nouns following them would be their objects. This interpretation, although grammatically satisfactory and semantically acceptable here, is different from the motif seen in an apparent parallel to this passage from the baby incanta-tion corpus (Farber 1989a: 48 §5, 69–70). In the latter, the subject-object relationship is clear from the use of suffixes: limḫurka līmu(-)[ . . . ] / limḫurka nammaššû ša ṣēri “May . . . [ . . . ] receive (=take care of?) you, may the animals of the open country receive you!” The existence of this other motif might even have led to a certain level of uncertainty in our passage, as shown in the inconsistent spellings discussed above.I 167–69 These lines might have contained a (demonically twisted?) description of common wail-ing rites, but their wording is not well enough preserved to prove this.I 170–73 In this broken context, it remains unclear to whom or what the suffix -šu refers, although it might well resume once more ṣuḫāru from above, line 157.I 173 Rather than deriving the form from ḫabātu “to rob, kidnap,” I prefer ḫabāšu “to smash, chop up,” attested in similar comparisons in a magical text (Lambert AfO 18: 294, 75: kīma diqāri) and in a curse (CH rev. xxviii 39: kīma ṣalam ṭīdim). I am unable to offer a convincing restoration for the first part of the comparison, which might have named the thing broken (as in the two parallel passages), a tool used for breaking, or the person doing the breaking. sebîšu “seven times” might mean here “into seven pieces.”I 175 A plural form *šaḫātātu to šaḫātu “corner” 43 is still not otherwise attested, but the newly established connection of the form with *wšb (text α) strongly supports this derivation: compare CT 16, 26 iv 26 and CT 17, 3, 16 for similar passages. Note, however, that text m, by leaving out ina, seems to call for a transitive verb (a locative function of šaḫātāti seems less likely) and may have had an altogether different version of the line.I 177 (+“Ug” II 2′?) For šuḫarrat ūmi “stillness of midday,” used next to muṣlalu “high noon, si-esta time,” see “MB” I 17 (parallel to Inc. 12, but the SB text does not have this particular passage). Because the end of our line is still lost, the connection to “Ug” II 2′ also remains 43. See AHw. 1129b; accepted in CAD Š/I 81b (with question mark) and 82b (without question mark)."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"217Lamaštu Series I: Commentaryconjectural: if [ . . . -ḫ]ar-rat 44 actually should be restored there as [šuḫ]arrat, either the syntax or the arrangement of the lines must have been quite different in this text.I 178 (+ “Ug” II 3′?) The end of the line remains unrestorable, since “Ug” II 3′ (if it actually is parallel to this line; for the uncertainty of this assumption, cf. also the commentary to 177) does not yield a usable predicate: the first partially preserved sign is definitely not BA, 45 thus ruling out forms from *blkt Š or N. The problems of the line are worsened by the inconclusive variants of the beginning. Since ṣētu suggests a connection with *ḫmṭ, text D1 should probably be read ḫummu[ṭ ṣēt]i “the intense burning of the sun’s glow.” In m, however, the space before LUM and the use of the sign KUR in [ . . . ].LUM.KUR ṣe-e-ti excludes this reading. The most likely restoration here seems to be [ša]lummat ṣēti “the radiance of the sun’s glow.” Without direct parallels to either phrase, my preference for the latter follows the principle of lectio difficilior. Copying a slightly damaged tablet, the Kuyunjik scribe could then easily have misunderstood the text, changed the reading of LUM to ḫum, and rephrased the line to contain a more familiar idiom.I 179–86 For the syntax of this passage, see above, commentary to “Lam. I” 65–66.I 179 (+ “Ug” II 4′) The suffix in text D1 shows that Lamaštu’s own melammu (and not that of the lion) is the object here. Thus, it is unlikely that the predicate should be the same as in line 171 (*ndī Š perf. + acc. suff.). 46 *ʾdš “to be new” does not qualify for a Š stem and should therefore not be considered here (contra Nougayrol 1969: 395 n. 15 and Arnaud 2007: 71). A Š stem of idû “to know” also seems semantically problematic and would leave the alleged suffix -ša in “Ug” (see n. 46) unexplained. I thus assume an otherwise un-attested verb *šuddušu based on the numeral “6” (*šdš) with a meaning “to make six-fold, sextuple.” Similar verbal derivatives are thus far attested for “2” (šunnû), “3” (šullušu), “4” (rubbuʾu), and “5” (ḫummušu).I 180 (+ “Ug” II 5′) Only “Ug” preserves the last sign of the line which Nougayrol read NU, and understood as a form of neʾû. 47 The tablet, however, shows BE (which in this text is generally distinct from NU), and accordingly I read i-mid instead. 48 Since emēdu has the well-established meaning of “imposing (something unpleasant) on somebody,” the line also seems to yield at least acceptable sense. For the meaning of *lḫb G/Š, so far attested only in “Lam.”, cf. below, commentary to “Lam. II” 165.I 181 (+ “Ug” II 6′) Cf. “Lam. I” 65 (dilḫa iškun instead of duluḫḫâ ištakan). A byform dulḫû for duluḫḫû “confusion, murkiness” is attested in Oppenheim Dreams 326, 22. The spelling in 44. Note that Arnaud’s copy of these signs in Arnaud 2007: pl. VIII is quite different from mine, although his read-ing on p. 63 (with comm. on p. 71) is neither conclusive nor convincing.45. See also Arnaud’s copy in Arnaud 2007: pl. VIII. In spite of this, on p. 63 he reads the line as [ . . . ib-b]a!-la-kat.46. Note also that in Ug II 4′ the final syllable is written -ša, the vowel providing another strong argument against an accusative suffix.47. Reading i-nu, Nougayrol tentatively derived the form from *nēʾ “to turn back,” but left the vowel unexplained (1969: 395 n. 15). If NU were actually the correct reading, other derivational possibilities (but with similar problems of vocalism) would be from *nāʾ “to shout,” or *ʾnī “to change.”48. Arnaud’s reading i-bat (with translation “annihile”) seems to derive the form from *ʾ bt which to me seems mor-phologically impossible."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition218text D1 (du-ur-ḫa-a) might reflect this form, adding another example to the small list of l/r interchanges in Akkadian (see Farber 1977: 204 with n. 1). “Ug” simply writes idallaḫ instead of the rather stilted expression duluḫḫâ ištakan.I 182 This line is omitted in text m (note that “Ug” also contains no parallels for it or the fol-lowing line). ḫarrānu is construed as a fem. here (-ša).I 183 For a literal parallel to this line, see “Lam.

For the use of *tbk in similar context, see CAD T 7 s.v. tabāku 3c. Note that the verb denotes both the “shedding” (of one’s own leaves, hair, etc.) and the “stripping off ” (of someone else’s attributes).ībir in “Ug” (partially preserved in 7′–8′; lack of space precludes a similar restoration in 9′, where I tentatively restore īmid instead) looks like a multiple dittography from line 6′ (see already Nougayrol 1969: 396 n. 19). It is noteworthy, however, that the verbal root *ʾ br “to cross,” while restricted in Akkadian to complementation by bodies of water or the sky, in Northwest Semitic can refer to a much broader range of geographical features and very often simply means “to pass by x.” This would make perfect sense in our passage, and the variant thus may well be traced back to the misunderstanding by a Ugaritic scribe of the proper, rather narrow, meaning of ebēru in Akkadian. Note also that “Ug”, after a full parallel to line 184 in 7′, is very much at variance with the canonical text in 8′, while 9′ is again very close to 186. “Ug” II 8′: For ṣarbatu, see the commentary on “Lam. I” 63–64. For *npṣ “to strip off (hair, fruit, fish-scales, etc.),” compare the references collected in AHw. 735f. under napāṣu G2c, meaning “unkl.” (cf. also CAD N/I 286b).I 186 (+ “Ug” II 9′) Note that in the later texts GIŠbuṭnu replaces GIŠLAM.GAL = buṭuttu of the “Ug” version. This lends additional weight to the argument that both names refer to the same tree, the terebinth, and that the conventional separate translation “pistachio” for buṭuttu should be given up. 49 allānu and *buṭnu ša šadî (var. buṭunānu) are also mentioned next to each other in “Lam. II” 189. ul-ta-lak in “Ug” II 9′ must be a faulty spelling for ultālik.I 187 Cf. also “Lam. I” 190. Nougayrol (1969: 396 n. 24) was the first to correctly note that *na/ešb/pu must be an adjective qualifying dāmu. 50 Etymology and meaning, however, remain uncertain. 51 The word has until now almost exclusively been attested in Lamaštu texts and is there invariably spelled with initial Man = niš, which made it improbable that the relatively rare reading naš of this polyphonous sign was intended. Exactly this reading, 49. See the detailed discussion by Stol (1979: 8ff.), who seems, however, to have overlooked the prior remarks by Nougayrol (1969: 396 n. 22). 50. Although AHw.’s interpretation as an abstract noun *nišbûtu “Sättigung” seems to fit our line 187, it is syntacti-cally impossible in the similar passages “Lam. II” 95 and “Ug” II 10′. 51. For a rather speculative suggestion “dried,” based on a single entry in an Ebla vocabulary, see Civil 1982: 2 n. 4, followed by Scurlock (1991: 155), who (on the same page) translates the same word in “Lam. II” 95 as “coagulated?.”"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"219Lamaštu Series I: Commentaryhowever, is now made very likely by another text from Ugarit, edited by Arnaud (2007) as no. 14. Here, in lines 5 and 6, what is most probably the same adjective is written once na-aš-ba (masc. sing.) and once na-aš-bu-ti (masc. pl.). 52 It is also tempting to connect these passages with Bezold, Cat.Suppl. pl. 4, 500 II 4: MÚD.MEŠ-šú na-áš-Bu, which both dic-tionaries list under našāpu “to blow (away)” (CAD N/II 56; AHw. 758b). Note also that the N stem of this verb occasionally shows e-vocalism ([lin]nešpū, Maqlû VI 33). Whether further connections to the well-known našpu type of beer are admissible, I do not know, but it should be noted that (a) našpu beer does not seem to have the negative connota-tions we expect for na/ešpu blood 53 in our context and that (b) there are no by-forms with e/i-vocalism attested for the beer variety.I 188/191 The exact meaning of g/karāṣu in this context 54 still remains a bit unclear. The basic meaning of *krṣ is “to pinch or break off small pieces (from a substance or object),” which in our case might either refer to gnawing small edible pieces off the bones 55 or, more likely, to cracking the gnawed-off hollow bones to suck out the bone marrow.I 189 (“Ug” II 10′) The predicate of this line, tal-tam-di-i/e, has never been satisfactorily ex-plained. 56 Fortunately, help now comes from a hitherto unpublished source, “Emar” 31f.: talmadī akal dimmāti u bikīti. Unless we assume still another major misunderstanding in this often-corrupt text, it seems to show that our form is simply a 3.f.s. perfect from *lmd “to learn about,” with the “Emar” parallel having a preterite form instead. The plene writing tal-tam-di-i in this case should be an indication that we are dealing with a question here 57 and not a contractional length based on a final weak radical. “ To have learned about, become an expert for” could then, by extension, even have taken on the nuance “to have become used to,” as assumed in my translation. Although akal dimmati u bikīti does not seem to be attested elsewhere, it is fully un-derstandable in this context, while *ša dimmati u bikīti in text m does not make any sense. It thus seems probable that the scribe, copying from an original that wrote the logogram NINDA for aklu, misread the sign as a syllabogram šá and mistakenly replaced it with its allograph ša.I 190 (+ “Ug” II 10′) Cf. above, commentary to “Lam. I” 187 and 190. The phrase dām(ī) aWīlūti našbūti in “Ug” is the same as in “Lam. II” 95, thus clarifying the syntax of both passages.52. The third alleged occurrence of this word, this time as a noun written našx(GIŠ)-bé(-ma) at the beginning of line 5, is less certain. A simpler reading iz-bé(-ma) “fetuses” could also be considered.53. See also Arnaud’s tentative translations “corrompu” in our text (Arnaud 2007: 67) and “gonflée” in no. 14 (p. 57, with commentary pp. 57f.). His hesitation to accept a reading MAN=naš and instead to opt for néš (p. 71) are influenced by the “variant” GIŠ (see above, n. 52) and thus no longer substantial.54. CAD K 210a translates “to break”; AHw. 448a: “(zer)nagen.”55. Note, however, that this would basically repeat the previous action of “eating (flesh not to be eaten).”56. For a derivation from *ṣdī Gtn, see originally Myhrman 1902: 162f. n. 9, and later, AHw. 1074a. This interpreta-tion, however, had to cope with major morphological and syntactical difficulties and was, for instance, never adopted in the CAD.57. “Ug,” if restored correctly, instead has a plain statement tal-ta-[am-d]i."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition220I 191 (+ “Ug” II 11′–12′) See also line 188. Note that text m omits the repetition of this line. This might indicate that the Aššur version of the text took taltamdî mārat Ani in line 189 to function as a pivot in a construction linking šīra ša lā akāli eṣemta ša lā karāṣi as first ob-ject with akal dimmati u bikīti as second object: “ To flesh not meant for eating, bone(s) not meant for cracking (←) have you become used (→) to food of wailing and weeping? ” Such a construction, although not necessarily the older and better text (cf. “Ug”!), would elimi-nate the difficulty created by the lack of an appropriate verb for line 188. It also would avoid a possible misunderstanding of the passage based on a reading that would assume that line 191 contained the object of the verbs in 192–93.I 192–93 Here again, the verbal form is somewhat difficult. Myhrman (1902: 162f. n. 9) derived it from ṣadû D, a verb well attested in Lamaštu and similar texts. The form liṣaddīki “may he supply you (with provisions)” seems to make reasonably good sense here, although the cognate object ṣudê “with provisions” otherwise regularly accompanies forms of ṣuddû. The spelling with KUR, however, would involve an otherwise unattested value ṣad for this sign. 58 In view of this, Myhrman’s reading *li-ṣad-di-ki was rejected by AHw. 59 but revived with a question mark in CAD N/I 100. Although AHw.’s interpretation “may (Anu/Antu) cause (someone) to throw to you (2.fem.dat.) (bones, etc., for feeding)” seems rather convoluted, a simpler translation “to cause to drop” makes better sense to me: “may (Anu/Antu) cause you (2.fem.acc.) to drop (the bones etc.).” Line 191 then becomes the centerpiece of a hinge construction, acting as direct object for both taltamdī/taltanattî in 189/190 and lišaddīki in 192/193, thus introducing the description of Lamaštu being forced to break up camp. Note also that, at least according to the passage in lines 196–203, it is not Anu and Antu but rather Asalluḫi and Siraš (cf. also “Ug” II 15′, where it is Ea) who actually supply Lamaštu with better travel provisions in this incantation. Other possibilities that failed to convince me in this context include limaṭṭīki “may he reduce (= humble?) you” (*mṭī D) and linaṭtīki “may he beat you” (*nṭū, with uncertain meaning of the D stem).I 194 (+ “Ug” II 13′) Already, D. Myhrman realized that this line mentioning pegs and ropes refers to the breaking of camp. Although the first half is basically clear (“Ug” needs a slight emendation), the second half has been subject to many different interpretations: Myhrman’s translation “schneid ab deine Stricke” (1902: 163 with n. 10) was altered by Nougayrol without explanation to “enfouis tes excrements” (1969: 396 with n. 27). AHw. 913a, although introducing what it called a “transferred” meaning “einwickeln” for qebēru, translates our line “vergrabe deine Fäden,” which does not make sense in the context. CAD Q 201ff. finally postulates two separate meanings for qebēru, “to bury” and “to roll up.” I am not convinced that these two meanings, both attested for the G and D stems, really belong to one verb (see also above, comm. to “Lam. I” 41), and would rather separate 58. Cf. AS4 no. 211 (pp. 39f. and 13*). Derivation of initial /ṣ/ values from original /š/ or /s/ values hardly ever hap-pens within the Akkadian syllabary (cf. for the only clear case AS4 no. 26: ŠAḪ=šiḫ/ṣiḫ, LB). Secondary development of values from /z/ to /s/ occurs occasionally, while shifts /š/ < /s/ and /z/ < /ṣ/ are common.59. AHw. 708b, reading li-šad-di-ki, derives the form from *ndī Š."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"221Lamaštu Series I: Commentarythem for the time being, with the references for qubburu adj. “(mng. uncertain)” (CAD Q 292, cf. AHw. s.v. qebēru D4b) probably also belonging to “to roll up.”I 195 (+ “Ug” II 14′) In spite of the parallels, the correct restoration of “Ug” is still problematic. Instead of the version suggested in this edition, one could also assume a sizeable dittog-raphy and restore the line as ki-ma ANŠE.EDIN š[a-da]-ạ-ki 60 / {ša-d[a?-a-k]i} ru-up-di or just eliminate the final sign in 14′a for a restoration ki-ma ANŠE.EDIN.N[A? EDI]N {ki} / ša-d[a?-a-k]i ru-up-di.Texts m and “Ug” provide what I consider the original reading of the final verb, šadâki rupdī. 61 This phrase, “roam your mountain,” is parallel to well-attested ṣēra rapādu “to roam the open countryside.” The later change to šadâki rukbī “ride (to ?) your mountain, disappear,” 62 currently attested only in exemplars from Kuyunjik, may have come about under the influence of an existing idiom šadâ (or: ana šadê) rakābu with a meaning parallel to šadâ(šu) emēdu (cf. most recently CAD R 87a).I 196–203 (+ “Ug” II 15′–17′) “Ug” has a considerably shorter version of this passage. Only Ea mašmaššu is invoked here, and it even remains unclear whether he, or the magician, are supposed to give Lamaštu the ingredients necessary to make her own bread and beer, since the text actually has luddinku (precative 1.c.s.) instead of the canonical version’s liddinki (3.m.s.).I 196 (+ “Ug” II 15′) The spelling MAŠ.MAŠ in this line, now further backed by “Ug” [maš]-maš-šu, in my opinion constitutes final proof (contra CAD M/I 381b, which took this to be a syllabic spelling) that mašmaššu is at least a viable option for the reading of the logo-gram (LÚ)MAŠ.MAŠ in SB texts. For LB references, see my remarks in Farber 1987b: 29 n. 11 and Oelsner 2001: 487 with n. 19.I 197 The gifts for Lamaštu enumerated in this line also form part of the standard iconography of Lamaštu amulets; see my discussion in Farber 1987a (mulṭû: pp. 93–95; dudittu and kirissu: pp. 96–99; pilaqqu: p. 93; šiddu: pp. 99–100).I 199 Both dictionaries connect our šaman miḫri with the miḫru offering, which makes little sense in the context. My translation is based on the well-known nuance of maḫāru as “to be on the same level, correspond.” Another possible derivation of miḫru in this phrase could be based on maḫāru “to withstand,” with the emphasis not so much on quality oil as a status symbol but rather on the oil’s value in protective skin care (compare also the “everlasting shoes” of the following line).I 202 (+ “Ug” II 16′–17′) Text m seems to call on a human brewer, while the Kuyunjik exem-plars agree on the god of beer, Siraš/Siris, as the provider of brewing ingredients; for “Ug”, cf. above, commentary to “Lam. I” 196ff. and note that, according to my restoration of line 60. Arnaud (2007: 63), assuming another dyslexic mistake and a dittography with the following line, reads [ru-up]-di here, but my notes say that the last sign is clearly a KI.61. Both texts were formerly read *rubkī, assuming a metathesis from rukbī: see Nougayrol 1969: 396 n. 28. The read-ing d[i] in text m was confirmed by collations by me and, independently, by W. Meinhold.62. Wiggermann (1983: 102 n. 22) translates “bestijg je berg” = “climb your mountain.”"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition22215′, luddinku should be a mistake for the precative 3.m.s. *liddinki, not a 1.c.s., as originally translated by Nougayrol (1969: 396f.).“Ug” II 18′–28′ This passage was quoted (without its later parallels) by Dietrich (1988: 89f.) in a discussion of Marduk at Ugarit (see line 22′).I 204 (+ “Ug” II 18′–19′) To judge from the remaining traces, m seems to preserve the older reading of “Ug”, *utammīki mārat Anu Anu u Antu.

Lugalabzu, if read correctly, is another name for Enki/Ea (see Kre-bernik 1987–90: 110) who, however, had already been mentioned in line 205. Lugalabzu is mentioned next to Usmû and Ḫasīsu in Šurpu VIII 38, where an interesting var. from UET 6/II 408 24f. reads : . . . l u g a l . a . a b . b a (mistaken repetition from preceding line!) dše-mu-ú(-)ḫa-si-su. Usmû (dARA/ŠA) and Ḫasīsu also occur together in ABRT 56, 4. Their function in the context of incantations remains obscure to me.I 209 (+ “Ug” II 25′?) If it is legitimate to combine the text of “Ug” II 25′ with the name Ištar in line 209 of the standard version, we gain a nice, easily understandable epithet of the latter, “Ištar, [most ho]nored 63 one of the gods, heroic woman.” Unfortunately, in view of the different arrangements of the two versions, this remains unproven.I 210 (+ “Ug” II 23′?) Nougayrol (1969: 397 n. 33) read the first divine name in this line in “Ug” as dMÁ “the divine boat” (= the moon crescent, Sîn). This does not, however, fit the traces in text A very well, and the interpretation remains unproven. The second name in “Ug” II 23′, da m a.ZA.KA.NU.TA, can, in spite of Nougayrol’s efforts, 64 still not be safely identified with any female member of the pantheon. At the end of the line, ka-nu-ta could conceivably be understood as *kanûtu “honored,” if the name is actually reduced to dama.ZA. Unfortunately, the canonical text does not help either: while it is almost certain that the end of the first line preserved on K 2016b (D1) belongs to the second half of line 210, the reading of the traces as [rāk]ib? ṣīrūti is very doubtful, remains without parallels, and seems to refer to a male deity.63.

My restoration of the begin-ning fits this reading but without parallels must remain conjectural. A form of the verb *wṣī Š would, however, nicely preempt the ritual instruction in line 227, which uses the same verb.I 214 qebēriki instead of qerēbiki in “Sb” is simply a graphic metathesis (BI-RI for RI-BI) to be blamed on the student scribe.I 215 (+ “Ug” II 26′) The same sequence of verbs (*nsḫ, *wṣī Š, *ṭrd, *kšd D) also occurs in KAR 184 rev. 14–15.

Although his observations are fully convincing on the gra-phemic level, the semantic problems involved (D-stem forms of the same verb being used both transitively and intransitively, with a passive Dt stem almost synonymous to the intransitive usage of D) remain puzzling. For the stative of duppuru in similar context, see Lambert AfO 19, 118, 38f., where the preceding three verbs are unfortunately broken (ṭ[a]r-da-tu-nu seems possible for the second one).I 217–18 and “Ug” II 28′ Although “Ug” ends this incantation with a standard z i - p à formula, the text of the later tradition remains largely incomprehensible.

The signs preserved in line 218 are less conclusive: ù could just as well be Akkadian, UGU.RA might be muḫra (cf., from a distantly related text, KUB 37, 67, 4: mu-uḫ-ra(-)an(-)[ . . . ] ??), and TI.LA could be a logographic spelling of balāṭu or bulluṭu (a phrase il balāṭi/bulluṭi “the/a god of healing” is, however, otherwise unknown to me).I 221 Text m writes the hitherto unattested logogram DIRI for ṣuddû.I 223–25 Rather than “offerings” for Lamaštu, I assume the food and drink mentioned here to rep-resent an ordinary “meal” for her before her “travel” to the ṣēru. This seems to consist of a hot (or “thoroughly cooked, well done”?) dish or soup, everyday drinks, and a selected (and certainly symbolically relevant) piece of meat. For the surprisingly rare occurrences of pigs and piglets in Lamaštu’s realm, see Farber 1987a: 89 with n. 11.65.

In mathemati-cal terms, the wording seems to be over-determined.Lam. II (= 2. pirsu)II 1–26 (+ “Ug” III 15′ff.) This incantation, although now completely reconstructed, still poses immense difficulties for translation and interpretation. The earlier version from Ugarit helps solve some cruces that obviously stem from ancient textual corruption, but it also adds new problems. The imagery used seems to build on many allusions and is possibly meant to be ambiguous in several places. Syntax and style are also more complex than in most other spells of the Lamaštu series.Exemplar a (line II 22) quotes only the incipit of this incantation, then skips the full wording and instead adds the instruction adi qītišu tamannu “You recite (it) up to its end,” after which this text continues directly with the rubric line and ritual (“Lam. II” 27ff.). For similar redactional notes, cf. CAD Q 285a s.v. qītu 1c, and Šurpu I rev. 16′ (see Reiner 1958: 12).II 1 (+ “Lam. III” 72, 87, 100; “Ug” III 16′) The last word of this line was transliterated ME.UR-ki but left untranslated in AHw. 542a (see also CAD L 115b and Nougayrol 1969: 398 n. 39). Although neither AHw. nor CAD list our passage under letter M, a derivation from milku “counsel” seems inevitable now that “Ug” mi ?-li-ka has clarified the reading of the formerly ambiguous UR. Note, however, that *lzz “to be persistent” is otherwise not attested with milku or any similar term but restricted to uses with rain and medical conditions. Although the extant duplicates of “Lam. II” 1 do not add ana before lazzu (“Ug” is broken at the crucial point, but space also does not seem to allow the restoration of ana), the preposition is written in all exemplars of “Lam. III” 72, 87, and 100, which quote the incantation. Of the texts from “Lam. II” that do not write a preposition, “Ec” seems to make the best sense of the line by using a stative, lāz, which yields a translation “persis-tent is your counsel.” The others (D2: lazzi; a, “Ea”, and “Eb”: lazzu) remain syntactically unclear to me, and my translation is thus based solely on the somewhat simpler reading with ana from tablet III.II 2–3 (+ “Ug” III 17′–18′) For these lines, see Farber 1991. The main difficulty of interpreta-tion—the exact meaning of qāt x našû—is addressed there in n. 7. A connection with the standard expression “hand of god/demon xyz,” most often used in a negative sense (see CAD Q 186ff. s.v. qātu 1e 2′–6′) seems plausible but ultimately unprovable. An additional difficulty arises from “Ec”, which skips line 2 completely, thus leaving the passage without a predicate. The spelling i-ši in “Ea” is strange; it looks like an imperative, but the fact that the form is negated obviously rules this out as a possibility.II 4 (+ “Ug” III 19′) taprīs and taprīst nouns are known from both *nūḫ and *ʾnḫ: tanīḫ(t)u “re-pose, tranquillity,” and tānīḫ(t)u “wailing, hardship, labor” (see most recently al-Rawi and"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"225Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryGeorge 1990: 156 ad 59). In most cases, the context will make the decision between the two options easy, but in our line a final verdict can probably not be reached without fur-ther parallels, and it is quite probable that the almost perfect homophony (and complete homography) of the two words was used here in an intentional play on words. “Ug” and the Babylonian texts have the verb in the perfect (attadīki in “Ea”, “Eb”, and “Ec”, and probably to be restored also in b), while the Kuyunjik exemplars show the preterite (addīki).II 5 (+ “Ug” III 20′–21′) “Ug” seems to have had a different construction, unless the lack of ina is no more than a scribal mistake.II 6 In the absence of an unambiguous spelling variant (like *šà-) in *ša-libbiša, and since I am unable to make any sense of this line involving a reading “unborn child, fetus,” I prefer to connect the phrase with the idiom *mala libbi maṣû “to do as one pleases” (lit., “to be equal to a wish”). This interpretation is bolstered by the variant ša libbika in “Ea”, easily under-standable if both -ša and -ka refer to Lamaštu but not so if reference were made to another woman’s child. A first step toward this understanding was made by Nougayrol (1969: 399 n. 44).II 7 (+ “Ug” III 22′) Cf. comm. to “Lam. I” 14 and 196.II 8–10 These three lines function as a big hinge construction, with ina zumur šerri mār ilišu annî (line 9) connecting equally to all three verbs in lines 8 and 10.II 8 (+ “Ug” III 23′) Understanding it as a phonetic mistake (from dictation?), and not as a semantic variant “your word, utterance” (contra Nougayrol 1969: 399 n. 46), I take the spelling a-mat-[ki] in “Ug” to bolster a reading i-mat-ki “your venom” in the later texts, rather than i-šat-ki “the fire brought by you.”II 10 (+ “Ug” III 25′) The logogram GIG from “Ug” is reflected in the syllabic spelling mur-ṣa in “Ec”. Text “Ea” adds an extra term for “frost,” šalgu.II 11 (+ “Ug” III 26′) Out of a total of seven duplicates and parallels to this line, three texts (C2, D2, and b) write lām, three others (“Ug”, “Ea”, and “Eb”) write lā, and one is bro-ken at the beginning (“Ec”). While C2, D2, “Ug”, and “Ec” show the predicate (present or preterite?) in the subjunctive, the other three texts have a preterite in the indicative mood. Unfortunately, no clear distribution between Assyrian and Babylonian texts or between texts belonging to the different arrangements of the Lamaštu series is apparent here. Another text where lā and lām occur as variants is CH §278 (rev. xxiii 60, var. from the Kuyunjik exemplar e); here, both texts have the predicate in the preterite indicative. In both the Lamaštu reference and the CH lines, a meaning “x not yet having happened, before x has happened / will happen” makes good sense. The change in verbal mood re-mains puzzling unless we accept two different constructions, one using hypotaxis by means of the well-known subjunction lām (AHw. lāma C) with a hitherto unrecognized by-form lā (“Ug”) “before,” while in the other lām, again with the same variant lā, would have to be seen as the temporal adverb “not yet” (AHw. lāma B) in paratactic syntax. Lamaštu Series II: Commentary"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition226tamû D + double acc. is usually construed as “to put somebody under a magical spell validated by someone/something else.” With šipir lemutti, which can hardly refer to any-thing but Lamaštu’s evil deeds, this does not make sense, and I thus assume an ad hoc construction with an adverbial accusative “with regard to, on account of.”II 12–13 (+ “Ug” III 27′–29′) Instead of solving the extant textual problems, every new dupli-cate seems to add to the obscurity of these two lines, and it is entirely possible that this reflects just as much the puzzlement of the ancient scribes as it testifies to our inability to find an obvious meaning for the seemingly unrelated words juxtaposed here. Syntactically, it seems possible that all the commodities listed in lines 12–13a are finally subsumed in 13b under ikkibki, which then would act as the main object of the imperative ṣabtī. I prefer, however, to take them as parallel to šipir lemutti from 11, so that Lamaštu is thus being conjured “on account of ” all these unpleasant things. The concluding ikkibki ṣabtī, which I have translated rather literally, might also have an idiomatic meaning still unknown to us.II 12 (+ “Ug” III 27′–28′) In the Kuyunjik texts, the first item in this list of unpleasant com-modities is probably to be read šipir urî, as proposed in AHw. 1435b (slightly modifying Nougayrol 1969: 399 n. 50). “Ug” has ši-pur (bu-re-e?), most probably reflecting the read-ing šipir but exhibiting another mistake in the vowel (from dictation? Cf. above, comm. to “Lam. II” 8). On the other hand, the reading *šipir can hardly be correct in text b, where the second sign is actually ERIM, which in Babylonian script should only have the value z/ṣab/p. Combined with the fact that the next sign in this text seems to be a BU, this sug-gests a variant or misreading based on a hitherto unattested noun ṣ/zabburû, possibly to be connected with ṣabburītu in Maqlû III 54, although I cannot make any sense of the result-ing phrase pan (or: īn) ṣabburê. On the other hand, the possibility that ERIM is simply a lapsus calami for UD = pir cannot be completely ruled out; see below.The word following *šipir remains very difficult in the other texts as well. All texts seem to show forms of the genitive, reinforcing the notion that the preceding word, *šipir, should indeed be a noun in construct. As already mentioned above, the two Kuyunjik texts have šipir ú-ri-i, and text b might have to be emended to read šipir bu-re-e, which would bring it close to the reading in “Ug”, ši-pur bu-re-e?. Texts “Ea” and “Ec” are both broken at the beginning and thus they could have been parallel either to the Kuyunjik texts or to text b. Finally, “Eb” replaces this with ruḫê rusê, two terms for “witchcraft, sor-cery.” For urû, AHw. lists no less than five nouns, plus two cross-references: I = “stables,” II = “stallion, team of horses,” III = “palm frond,” IV = “a pot,” V = “fumigants,” VI = ūru “genitalia,” VII = erûtu “fish spawn,” and CAD adds urû F “a bird.” As a further pos-sibility, one might think of ūru “stalk,” which presumably has a masculine plural urū. Of these, none yields convincing sense after *šipir. If we accept the emendations in texts b and “Ug”, the situation with b/purû (or būru pl.) is not much better, with close to ten possible candidates listed in CAD B 339ff. and AHw. 881f. None of these stands out as an obvious solution to the problem nor even as a plausible variant to any of the urûs. In light of D. Schwemer’s comments on burû ša ašlāki in KALI 2, 13 IV 13′ (2007a: 46), burû “reed mat” may be the most promising candidate, although, unfortunately, the last word"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"227Lamaštu Series II: Commentaryin our line is not ašlāku but aštammu (see below). In view of all these problems, I prefer to leave the passage untranslated and the interpretation open for whoever has a good idea.The reading of the second half of the line (incorrectly restored without indication of damage in CAD L 253a) has now been clarified by texts “Ea” and “Eb”. It remains, how-ever, quite unclear what the “cloth (= towel?, rag?) of the aštammu bar” really is. Note also that the Babylonian duplicates seem to have both nouns in status rectus, “a cloth (and) an aštammu,” which, however, does not make sense to me. “Ug” again adds a puzzling variant by writing ú-la-pu-UZ-t[am-. . . ], which Nougayrol (1969: 399 n. 50) tentatively explained as a crasis spelling for *ulāpu + what he then believed to be the noun aškāpu “fuller.” His reading of the last word is now obsolete, notwithstanding the occurrence of aškāpu in the accompanying ritual, line 28, but even if we now assume it is a crasis of *ulāpu + *(a)štammu, the spelling with the sign UZ instead of UŠ remains unexplained.II 13 (+ “Ug” III 29′) I assume that lupputu at the beginning of the line should be connected to ulāpu in the previous line, even though the two words are separated by aštammu. It would then probably be the qualifying adjective well-known from TÚG.NÍG.DÁRA ŠU.LÁL = ulāpu lupputu (thus CAD L 253a) mentioned in the accompanying ritual, line 29. But though in the Kuyunjik texts it is just the line division before lupputu that looks a bit awk-ward, more of a problem is posed by the Babylonian duplicates (b, “Ea”, “Eb”) which all insert an extra sign KA(= pî ? ) after lu-up-pu-uD. Here, an interpretation as the substantiv-ized infinitive D of *lpt might be more appropriate, although an idiom *pâ lapātu/lupputu is not otherwise known to me. For an interpretation of ikkibu as “privilege,” see Nougayrol 1969: 399 n. 52. Although my translation is quite different, it follows the main thrust of his argument by taking the suffix -ki as a subjective genitive (“your ikkibu” = abominable things belonging to and liked by Lamaštu), not an objective genitive (“an ikkibu for you” = things Lamaštu abhors). For the syntax, see above, commentary to “Lam. II” 12, first paragraph.II 14 (+ “Ug” III 30′–31′) The suffix -šunūti on the imperatives probably refers back to the “commodities” enumerated in lines 12–13, as well as forward to the “persons” mentioned in lines 15–16.II 16 (+ “Ug” III 34′) šūt panī- (C2, D2, b), šūt itti- (“Eb”), and šūt qātī- (“Ug”) are used as syn-onyms here; “those of someone’s face” or “hands,” as well as “those with someone” all stand for “the ones most closely related to, belonging with somebody.” The suffix -šú once used instead of -ka in text “Eb” is probably simply a mistake and not an indication of a different understanding of the passage.II 17–19 (+ “Ug” III 35′–36′) These three lines contain several comparisons in a roughly chi-astic arrangement. Although the middle line (18: kīma šikkê lā taḫallupī ṣerrāniš) makes sense on its own, the first line (17: kīma nalši ša kakkabī kīma zaqīqi ša apāti) is missing the predicate of the comparison, and the final one (19: lā tattanablakkatī ḫaṣab ūrāti) is lack-ing the noun to which the comparison refers.

In line 18, i-tel-lu could be a mistake for *ītelli (*ʾ lī Gt present or Gtn preterite), but even such an emendation does not yield sense. In the following line, the form must have been intended as a Ntn present of nabalkutu but got out of control. The change to a 3.c.s. also makes no sense.II 19 For demons “crossing over” the roof into houses, see CAD N/I 12b and SpTU II 7, 21 (ardat lilî).In another case of crasis, or sandhi spelling, ḫaṣab ūrāti is represented as ḫaṣbūrāti in the Kuyunjik texts. This solves the morphological and graphemic problems inherent in CAD’s reading *ḫaṣbu rāṭi “clay drainpipe” (N/I 12b).II 20–21 Note that text b uses preterites (ušarkib and umalli) before switching to the present tense in aṭarrad.II 21–26 This passage has been quoted and translated by Picchioni (1981: 92f.) after an older man-uscript by F. Köcher. With new material at hand, the reading of the passage can now finally be clarified.II 22 e-peš (the first sign is preserved only in text b but lost in both Kuyunjik exemplars) is taken here to stand for eppēšu “clever, expert,” a well-known epithet of Ea, rather than *egir Adapa “si interpone Adapa” (Picchioni 1981: 263) or *epēš Adapa “the creation of Adapa” (Michalowski 1980: 78 n. 10). eppēšu seems to be a befitting epithet also for Adapa, the “sage from Eridu” and thus Ea’s neighbor, although neither the Akkadian word nor its Sumerian counterpart g a š a m(NUN.ME.TAG) are elsewhere attested referring to him. On the other hand, the variants e-piš-ki/ka (texts c and “Ea”) better fit a participle ēpišu “sorcerer,” which is often used with a suffix referring to the person bewitched (or, in this case, “conjured”). The resulting phrase can be compared to gallûki āšipu Asalluḫi, line 7 (see also “Lam. I” 14), which also could have been the starting point of a reinterpretation of an original wording eppēš(u) in the two exemplars showing the variant; another reason for such a reinterpretation might have been a perceived parallelism to the participle at the beginning of the following line, dāgilki.II 23 The hinge construction of this line is difficult to translate: “(Adapa,) when he spots you ← in Eridu → shall have a close look at you (right there in Eridu).”II 24–26 This passage, which is parallel and in its first two lines even identical with lines 8–10 of this same incantation, forms another long hinge construction.

Whether N./z. is actually a species of fish—or, instead, some fish part, preparation, or product—remains unclear to me. Its magico-medical uses clearly speak in favor of the latter. The only syllabic spelling is at-tested in a late commentary text (SpTU I 50, 24 and 28). The use of the sign ziq in this text practically rules out the possibility that the term should be connected with šiqqu “fish sauce, paste.” On the other hand, a possible etymological connection with *zqt “to be pointed, to sting” might, if correct, point toward a fish bone or a spiny fin, while the element BAR in the logogram could also be connected to qulēptu “scales” (cf. Salonen 1970: 152 and 169).II 30 (+ “Lam. III” 68) Note that text c prescribes the lard as the vehicle of the salve, while all other texts list it as one of the ingredients.II 32–33 (+ “Lam.

I saw (and cop-ied) a sequence of three BI signs following an unclear trace that could conceivably be a ḪI. Could the enigmatic passage possibly be an ancient mistake for ḫ[e]-pí ḫe(BI)-pí?

A. M. Wiggermann (1983b: 298). A translation of lines 34–53 has also been provided in my edition of the amulet “Ah” (Far-ber 1997: 115–28). The remnants of “RS” show several similarities to 34–38, and that passage thus may well have contained an earlier version of Inc. 7.II 34 (+ “Lam.

Note the spelling variation between broken vowel writings signifying a strong form of the participle with /uʾa/ (thus in the Kuyunjik exemplars of “Lam. II” 34 and III 95, in text “Sd” of II 34, and in text b of “Lam. II” 152), and a weak form mummilat (thus in texts “Ea” and “Ah”). 67 Regarding the meaning of ummulu (*wml D?), I prefer CAD’s “to disturb” to AHw.’s “umfloren,” although the translation still seems to be too weak in many idiomatic phrases referring to sandstorms, battle, etc. Instead of the rather general 66. Finkel also quotes four incipits from BM 45393+ “I 29–II 74 ! ”(= here, text Ed) that refer to Incs. 2, 3, 7, and 6, respectively.

The form mummilu has made it into CAD as a separate lemma; see CAD M/II 196f.

Since a literal rendering “totality of the mountains, all mountains” does not make much sense in this otherwise unattested expression, I assume that kullat x here instead reflects an intensification, “mountains par excellence, highest mountains,” or the like. The amulet “Ah” has instead the relatively straightforward phrase ištu api īlâm-ma ezēzi ezzet, known also from “Lam. II” 85 and 121a.II 36 The significance of donkeys’ teeth (plain ugliness? Not recognizable in any of the pictorial representations!) remains unclear; see also “Lam. II” 161 with commentary. In “Lam.

(“Sa-gig 1”) (see already Hunger 1976: 36b, and cf. Frahm 2011: 98).The spelling tuk-kup (“Ah”) looks intriguing but is probably nothing more than a sloppy rendering of tukkupā. An interpretation “(s)he is speckled with regard to/at her kidneys” is excluded since the apparent loss of morphological gender distinction seen oth-erwise in “Ah” will not affect the feminine ending of the stative (*tukkupat) even though this amulet profusely uses masculine suffixes and endingless verbal forms for the feminine gender.II 38 For parallels to this line, see “RS” 4 and “OB4” 4′. For kalû “ochre,” cf. commentary to “Lam. I” 136.II 39 Lamaštu is only rarely called mārat Anu ša šamê (see, however, “Lam. II” 136: mārat Anu ša šamê anāku). This phrase usually refers to the benevolent seven “Daughters of Anu” (see Farber 1990: 301 with n. 12). It is likely that this association prompted the scribe of text “Ea” to slip into the plural mārāt [Anu?] at this point.II 40 The reading ina šiptišu ša nēmeqi “by means of (one of) his ‘spell(s) of wisdom’ ” is now clarified by texts “Ea” and “Ah”. Although Pinches’ old copy in IV R2 58 I 40 shows an undamaged RI (formerly read [ina šip]-ri) in this spot, my new copy of C2 (re-collated) shows that there are only traces on this exemplar that are fully compatible with [É]N-šú.

The phrase širʾānīša ušālika lillûta literally means “he let her sinews go limp.”II 41 Once more, text “Ah” provides us with an endingless variant in a place where either the fem ending /ī/ (tarammī) or—if the form were based on the masculine—a subjunctive /u/ (as in tarammu, text “Ea”) would be needed.II 43 Text “Ah” clarifies the rendering of the first word as “mothers” by using the logogram AMA.ME. It remains unclear what form of ummu (sing. or pl.?) was used in text “Se”: the trace after um is clearly not KUR/mat, but a scribal mistake in this otherwise very neatly written excerpt tablet can also not be ruled out. C2 probably used the expected fem. pl. form, ummātu.Note that the wording as it stands does not seem to make clear whose “mothers” Lamaštu is encouraged to prey on. The passage makes, however, perfect sense as a con-structio ad sensum: kališina “all of them,” although referring to the grammatically masculine animals in line 42, is in 43 used in the feminine gender for the simple reason that these same animal species are in this line specified to be “mothers.”II 44 It is a strange fact that representations or identifiable remains of sailboats are not known from ancient Mesopotamia (see Farber 1987a: 90 with n. 14 , with a reference to de Graeve 1981: 176ff.). In light of this, the traditional translation of eleppu šaḫḫī/ūtu might have to be reconsidered. The meaning “sailboat,” based on šahhû “cloth, canvas,” was introduced by Myhrman (1902: 171, 44 with n. 13), following a suggestion by Jensen (1901: 410), and seems to have never been questioned later (see, for instance, AHw. 1131b; Farber 1977: 182 n. 1; CAD Š/I 95f.). Jensen, however, had proposed “entweder ein Segelschiff oder ein Schiff mit Baldachin oder einer (Segel)tuchdecke? ” (with a question mark later dropped by Myhrman), making the sailboat just one of several possibilities for a “boat with cloth.” Furthermore, even the connection with TÚGŠÀ.ḪA/šaḫḫû is not ironclad: note that the determinative TÚG is never present in the writings of the boat and that an adjectival derivation from a noun šaḫḫû could hardly take the form šaḫḫūtu (the variant *šaḫḫītu at-tested in Hh could, however, well be the expected nisbe formation *šaḫḫîtu). The contextual evidence for the šaḫḫī/ūtu vessel remains rather slim: 1. Hh. IV 286 offers a context hardly suggestive of a major type or class of boats (cf. lines 284–85: ṭebītu “sunken,” ḫarištu “tied up, moored;” 287ff.: eššetu “new,” labirtu “old,” lupputtu “soiled”).2. Three ritual passages use model GIŠMÁ.ŠÀ.ḪA boats, loading them with provisions to send away unwanted demons, etc. “Bo” 8 mentions MUNUSLAMA (probably to be un-derstood as an unusual spelling for Lamaštu) in a ritual similar to “Lam.”, which gives no details about the manufacture or use of the boat.

A fourth one—that is, our incantation—mentions the Ulâ river and the sea, also mak-ing downstream travel of Lamaštu very likely. It is the only instance where a makurru is described as šaḫḫūtu.4. In Adapa frgm. A 19′, Adapa uses a GIŠMÁ.ŠÀ.ḪA in which he travels without rud-der (sikkannu) and without punting pole (gimuššu). The passage has been the subject of much discussion and various translations. 68 The CAD’s most recent interpretation (neqelpû “to drift downstream” and muḫḫuru “to navigate upstream,” see Š/I 95b) has been refuted by Izre'el, who convincingly argues that both of the expressions in this passage refer to downstream travel in the direction of Eridu. By doing so, he removes the main argument for a boat that could move upstream without being pulled or pushed, which probably would have been a sailing boat. Izre'el still translates GIŠMÁ.ŠÀ.ḪA as “sailboat,” but what would be so special about a sailboat floating down-stream without needing a rudder? And why would Adapa’s invention never be imitated or depicted later? Maybe he was, after all, using nothing but a plain boat, float, or even raft that he, thanks to his unusual, supernatural cleverness, was able to steer without the gear other ships needed but that also could easily be blown off course by unexpect-edly shifting winds?To sum up: There is no indication that the šaḫḫūtu vessels of the ritual texts are supposed to do anything but float downriver; to give them the tools to sail upstream would actually be counterproductive in the context of the magical rituals. Hh. IV suggests a somewhat accidental quality for the š. boat, rather than a technologically different class of vessels. Adapa may, or may not have used a sailboat. I have no new etymology for šaḫḫū/ītu to offer but still entertain lingering doubts about the correctness of the traditional transla-tion “sailing boat” and, at least for the time being, prefer the non-idiomatic but also non-interpretive “canvas boat.”II 46 For the Ulâ river, a still not definitively identified watercourse near the traditional border between Mesopotamia and Elam, see most conveniently Vallat 1993: 338.Whether A.AB in “Ah” should be taken as a defective writing of the logogram A.AB.⟨BA⟩ or as a doubly defective syllabic spelling ⟨a⟩-a-ab-⟨ba⟩ remains unclear. For ajjabba as an indeclinable noun attested from OB through SB, see George 1991: 2 and Charpin 1990.II 47 For this line, cf. Farber 1987a: 90 and—for a tentative identification of kušāru as Giant Reed (Arundo donax)—1987a: 91f. with n. 20. The suggestion has, however, not been taken up by Michael Streck (2009: 182ff.), and kušāru is not even mentioned there. The Kuyunjik text C2 leaves out the first plant (bīnu aḫû), possibly by accident. A close parallel to the line, though in the form of an imperative, is found in “Lam. II” 146.II 49 This line enumerates public locations that are in some way or other connected with the concept of justice. The mention of mīšaru within this group is a bit unexpected but may ultimately have to do with the fact that the word is originally a nomen loci “place of right-fulness,” even though it was no longer commonly used as such in Akkadian. While texts 68. See most recently Izre'el 2001: 9f. and 14 (comm.). Other treatments include, for instance, CAD M/I 68b; N/II 173b; S 246a; Picchioni 1981: 113; von Soden 1976: 429; Dalley 1989: 184."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"233Lamaštu Series II: Commentary“Ea” and “Ah” mark both ÍD and mīšaru (see also later in line 52) as divine by adding the determinative d, the other duplicates treat them as common nouns. Text n spells the river of ordeal i-ta, making it even more likely that we should read the logogram (d)ÍD as It instead of *Id 69 whenever this is used for the name rather than for the common noun nāru.II 50 For Šarʾur, a divine weapon mainly associated with Ninurta and earlier with Ningirsu, see most conveniently Krebernik 2009: 84–86 (our line is not mentioned there). Although not otherwise known as the “attendant” (ša-rēši) of “the lord of the lands” (probably = Ninurta), this epithet seems to make good sense (see, however, CAD R 283f., where the phrase is rendered “the mighty weapon at the disposal[?] of the lord of all countries”). That Ninurta is actually meant here is made even more likely by the fact that in the ac-companying ritual (lines 62 and 71*) “dust from the gate of the Ninurta temple,” an oth-erwise very unusual substance for magical rituals, is used.II 52+52a The end of the line in text n remains unclear. A. Falkenstein’s reconstruction an-[tum] (1931: 10) remains possible but has yet to be supported by another duplicate. It seems also conceivable that the scribe used the extra AN sign to gloss dDIŠ/60, which at this time and in this type of text is not a common spelling of Anu and thus might have been seen as ambiguous (see MZL no. 748 where the spelling is accepted only for LB, and compare the only other instance for dDIŠ = Anu in the Lamaštu series, “Lam. I” 204 text m). B seems to leave out the phrase completely, while C2, “Ea” and “Ah” end the line with syllabic da-nu(m). For a rendering of this line that assumes a slightly different syntax, see Lambert 1979: 273.II 53 A. Falkenstein’s restoration of the predicate (*i-[tur]-ra, Falkenstein 1931: 10) is now confirmed by text “Ea” (i-tur-ru) and was adopted as the main reading in my translation. An intriguing alternative is presented in text B, which shows i-bur-ra, with a gloss tu that probably reflects the reading iturra as a variant from a different source. Interestingly enough, CAD T 159 also restored text n as i[bur]ra, without knowing about text B. The CAD’s reading was obviously based on the usage of lā iburra/u (G present ventive or sub-junctive from *būr “to last, be long-lived”) in comparable context; see CT 23, 10, 15: kīma erpetu ina šamê lā iburru “as a cloud does not last long in the sky,” and SpTU I 44, 67 + dupl.: kīma mār nadīti lā iburra/u “as the son of a nadītu does not live long” (for the context of both lines, see Mayer 1992: 376). As a matter of fact, text B’s iburra would also make acceptable sense in our line, although I prefer the concept of “not returning” with regard to doors and demonic actions.II 54 With a complete text finally established, we can now put to rest many previous attempts at reading this line. Unfortunately, this does not mean that I can also understand and translate it. I have decided against a reading nīš libbi “potency” in view of the repeated nīš xx in the following two lines, where the meaning of nīš as “(power of) oath” is not 69. Thus, most recently, MZL no. 839, but see already the variant spelling dit-tu quoted both in AHw. 364a and in CAD I/J 8, and compare also the playful use of dÍD for the syllable /īt/ in spellings of kibrītu, pappasītu, and ruʾtītu."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition234in doubt. The following adjective could qualify either nīšu or libbu. It can be read either kubbutu “respected” or kupputu “compressed, compact.” For the former, the use of *kbt D with regard to oaths (CAD K 18a) could be compared. The latter is occasionally used with libbu, but this usage has so far been restricted to extispicy, never refers to the human heart, and therefore cannot be considered a good parallel. My translation tentatively opts for nīšu kubbutu but at the same time sacrifices the apparent syntactic parallelism between libbu kupputu and qaqqadu ṣalmu.The significance of “the black head” (never else attested as such!) escapes me. It seems, however, almost inevitable that the expression is somehow related to the (nišū) ṣalmāt qaqqadi, the “native people” of Sumer, of still unclear semantic origin.II 55 For tubkinnu “garbage pile,” a pejorative(?) derivative in -innu from *tbk/tubku, see now CAD T 446 (cf. also Biggs and Pardee 1984: 257b). The word seems to have a feminine by-form tupkinnatu (thus text C2, where the suffix -ša shows that it is sing.) and probably also a fem. pl. tupkinnātu (see CAD s.v.), which may be meant in “Ug” IV 2. A further by-form(?) *tupkindu (text “Ea”) is phonetically problematic and might actually rather be an ancient misreading (-du for -UŠ) from an endingless spelling *túb-kin-net(UŠ).II 57–59 The exact meaning of the Sumerian expression ḫ u l . d ú b in this context remains debat-able. Rather than connecting it with the magician’s instrument ḫultuppû (AHw. ḫ. II), I follow Finkel (2000: 202 ad 15) and take it as referring to the demon ḫ. (cf. AHw. ḫ. I 1; Geller 1985: 78: 831, 82: 878). There is also a homophonous Elamite month name that probably has nothing to do with the Sumerian word (contra AHw. ḫ. II 2) but might still have influenced the use of ḫ u l . d ú b here, adding once more a little Elamite flavor to the Lamaštu corpus (cf. my cautious remarks in Farber 1983: 439b, 440b, and 442f.).The translation of z i x ḫ é . p à follows its Akkadian equivalent, nīš x lū tamâta/i. The Sumerian literally means “may the life of x be implored!”Text “Ea” replaces the second half of line 58 with a slightly more elaborate Sumerian formula. It also adds the phrase “May the evil tongue step aside!” after line 59.Note that here, after a written-out z i – p à formula, the final phrase TU6/TE ÉN (= tê šipti) is not used and that the same thing happens again in “Lam. II” 134. I take this as one more indication that, at least in late texts, the phrase is indeed an abbreviation for a standard ending routinely to be recited after the wording of the individual incantation. The abbreviated notation of this “standard ending” was then left out if an individually ap-propriate ending for a particular spell had already been incorporated in the text.II 61–64 (70*–73*; + “Lam. III” 8–11) Although Rit. 7 and Rit. 7* only differ slightly in the arrangement of line 62=71*, “Lam. III” substitutes eper bābi kamî for eper bāb ekalli. The seven (or eight) kinds of dust used here do not seem to show a close relationship to the text of Inc. 7 nor to Lamaštu herself. A few associations within the text of “Lam.” are, however, possible. For the mention of bīt Ninurta, see above, commentary to “Lam. II” 50. With eper bīt aštammi, compare above, “Lam. II” 12. The mention of the bīt sābî and the bīt nuḫatimmi might have been triggered by the recurring episode of providing travel provi-sions for Lamaštu (see especially “Lam. I” 202–3)."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"235Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryII 64 (73*; + “Lam. III” 11) ina? [urṣi?] (with a hypothetical variant [urṣa?]) is a rather desper-ate attempt to harmonize the traces in 73* (text n) and “Lam. III” 11 (texts E and F) in a way that is acceptable in the context, where either an eighth substance or an additional adverbial phrase (time, place, or tool of action) should be expected. With NA4 as the only unquestionable sign in the passage, the option of tool seems most plausible. urṣu is attested several times with *sūk (see CAD S 83a and U/W 249b), a verb that is construed not only with ina (passim) but also with an accusativus instrumenti (Jastrow TCPP 1913: 399, 34; BAM 3 III 44 [ur-ṣa!]; BAM 513 I 10; probably BAM 510 I 15; possibly also in BAM 240, 42 and AMT 11/2, 21).II 66 (61*; + “Lam. III” 13) A combination of the three versions of the ritual allows us to read the names of the four astral symbols to be drawn on the amulet with confidence, although they are listed in a different sequence in each version. It seems clear that this description refers to the four symbols actually depicted on the upper register or the handle of a number of Lamaštu amulets: a winged sun-disc, a crescent moon, the star of Ištar, and the seven stars of the Pleiades. 70 Although the former three correspond easily with the Akkadian words šamšatu, uskaru, and kakkabtu, the connection between the remaining word, gamlu “crook, curved staff, (constellation) Auriga,” and the unmistakable depiction of the Ple-iades remains obscure. 71 For another enigmatic allusion to the Pleiades, this time under their common Akkadian name zappu “bristle,” see above, commentary to “Lam. I” 44 (and “Lam. II” 126).II 67 (+ “Lam. III” 14) To date, only one amulet inscribed with the text of Inc. 7 and thus di-rectly corresponding to the ritual instruction of this line has been found (“Ah”). This piece is very detailed in its pictorial representations and shows outstanding workmanship but unfortunately fails to depict the astral symbols prescribed in the preceding line.II 68–69 (75*; “+ Lam. III” 15–16) For a general discussion of dog figurines used in Lamaštu rituals, see Farber 2007b: esp. 638f. Several groups of magical figurines of dogs from the first millennium have been found buried beneath the floor or next to entrance gates in Nineveh, Nippur, Ur, Kish, Dūr-Šarrukīn, and Kalaḫ (see Rittig 1977: 116–21). Although they offer some close similarities to the dogs described in our ritual, none of these finds seems to be related directly to protection against Lamaštu. Although the dog figurines in our ritual are only to be painted in black and white (which corresponds well with line 45, where Lamaštu is to be accompanied by “black” and “white” dogs), the hoard finds typi-cally also contained dogs of other colors. The manufacture of figurines in five different shades (white, black, red, blue, multicolored) is prescribed in detail in another ritual. 72 These parallels provide a possible explanation for the otherwise unattested use of *brm D 70. See, for instance, amulets nos. 1, 3, 4, 37, 41, 46, 61, and 64; cf. Farber 1983: 442b.71. See also Wiggermann 1992: 62. Wiggermann 2000: 239 with n. 168 takes gamlu as the “crook of Amurru” and connects this to a rather unclear passage in “Emar” 21–22 where Amurru and Martu seem to be mentioned as gods by whom Lamaštu is adjured (see below, comm. to “Emar” 21f.).72. Wiggermann 1992: 14 lines 191–205. For the excerpt text KAR 298, rev. 17–22, see Rittig 1977: 159; Hibbert 1981: 186f. and 205; and cf. Wiggermann 1992: 45."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition236“to multi-color, paint in several colors” referring here solely to the contrast between black and white (see also Wiggermann 1992: 29 with n. 194b).II 72 (78*; + “Lam. III” 18) The same location to write down the names of the dogs, naglab šumēli, is also prescribed in the ritual quoted above (Wiggermann 1992: 14 line 195), and many of the excavated exemplars actually bear their names on the left side of their back (see Rittig 1977: 116–21, 198–99). A literal translation “shoulder blade” for naglabu does not make much sense with regard to such figurines, but the word can also stand per meris-mum for the complete upper part (or, with quadrupeds, front part) of the back (as opposed to the kalītu, literally, “kidney” and then “lower back”). See also “Lam. III” 88, where naglabu is the opposite of irtu “chest” in line 85.For the individual names and their parallels from the quoted ritual and the artifacts, see below, lines 75ff.II 73–74 (+ “Lam. II” 19–20) To “open” a window in ancient Mesopotamia may seem anach-ronistic, and it is true that the verb has only been restored here (see, however, “Lam. III” 21). Occasional references to “open” or “pulled-out” windows (see CAD A/II 198 and P 343b) can, however, be seen as an indication that, at least occasionally, windows were closed or blocked and thus openable. Another possibility would be that petû actually refers to the insertion of a new window hole in a previously solid mud-brick wall, comparable to its use for “opening = digging” wells etc.II 75 (+ “Lam. III” 21) The reading (and meaning) of the first half of the line, in which the place for the seventh dog is prepared, is uncertain. I know of no parallels for an absolute adverbial use of ina šaplim-ma “underneath” without a point of reference for the notion “underneath x.” On the other hand, if one were to interpret *ma-baD as a location (“un-derneath the *ma-baD”), this would compound the problem by depriving the transitive predicate tepette of its needed direct object. I thus prefer to read BAD as pītu “hole” and to understand this to be the expected accusative object. Note that line 69* and “Lam. III” 28 refer to this seventh location as an aptu; the word is unfortunately broken in line 82, where either [apt]i or [pīt]i could be restored.II 75–76,78 (+ 63*, 65*; + “Lam. III” 22, 24) The name of the second dog, Uṣur-mūša-ṭurud-Mārat-Ani, is self-explanatory and specifically geared to our ritual. It thus neither appears in other ritual texts nor is it attested on actual figurines.The name of the first dog is more problematic. It is closely related to that of the third figurine (line 78/65* // “Lam. III” 24), both sharing the last two radicals of their predicate (*C1rḫ) and apparentely also the noun in the second part of the name (always written ZI-šu/šú); the two should therefore be discussed together.The following spellings for dog figurines’ names that share these characteristics are attested:1. a-ri-iḫ–ZI-šu: Langdon Kish I p. 91 and pl. XXVIII 1 (figurine).2. a-ru-uḫ–ZI-šú: KAR 298 rev. 18; Wiggermann 1992: 14: 198.3. šá-ru-uḫ–ZI-šú: “Lam. II” 63* (n).4. ur-ru-uḫ–ZI-šú: “Lam. II” 78 (C2); “Lam. II” 65* (n); “Lam. III” 24 (G)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"237Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryBroken: [ . . . -r]u-uḫ–Z[I-šú]: “Lam. III” 22 (E); [ . . .—Z]I-šu: “Lam. II” 65* (m); ur-r[u?- . . . ] “Lam. III” 24 (X).I see no way to derive all these forms from just one verb, arāḫu + direct object napištu, as CAD A/II 222 tried to do. Nor is it possible to understand all of them as imperatives of several verbs, which at least would keep the names in line with those of the other dog figurines in our text. Note, however, that apotropaic dogs’ names in other texts (see Rit-tig 1977: 198–99) show more syntactical variety, including participles in construct (ṭārid asakki, kāšid ajjābi, etc.) and statives (dān rigimšu). If one accepts CAD’s differentiation between three homophonous but semantically separate verbs arāḫu with at least partly different root vocalization, the forms can be analyzed as follows:1. ariḫ should be the imperative of a. C “to attack.”2. aruḫ is otherwise well attested as the imperative of a. B “to eat, consume” but can also be the stative of a. A “to be fast.”3. For šaruḫ, the morphologically best option is again a stative but this time from the unrelated (and semantically hardly appropriate) root šarāḫu “to be splendid.” Less convincing but still possible seems an Assyrian(!) Š stative of a. A “to be fast” with an elative meaning “to be exceedingly fast,” but the form could also well be a mistake (see below).4. urruḫ likewise must be a D stative, probably an intensive form of a. A “to be very fast.”In conjunction with transitive imperatives, ZI-šu should probably be read napištašu “his throat/life,” while the statives call for a different reading, based on ZI = *tbī, most likely tibušu “his onrush, attack” (see CAD T 388a for tību as “attack of wild or noxious animals,” where, however, in line with CAD A/II 222, our dog figurines are not mentioned). While the name of Lamaštu’s dog no. 3, Urruḫ-ZI-šu, is fully preserved in “Lam. III,” the begin-ning of the name of the first dog is preserved neither in “Lam. II” 75 nor in “Lam. III” 22. It should be different from the name of the third dog, but my restoration [ša-r]u-uḫ in the latter place remains conjectural. If correct, the two names for Lamaštu’s dogs nos. 1 and 3 would then probably both contain ZI = *tbī, and I thus read them as Šaruḫ-tibušu and Urruḫ-tibušu, respectively.The whole situation is rather messy and probably reflects several ancient mix-ups, in-cluding one on the level of graphemics (ZI = napištu ↔ ZI = *tbī). For šaruḫ as a variant of aruḫ, see furthermore Gilg. VI 20, where šaruḫ lasāma “it is splendid of running” replaces (by mistake?) the expected aruḫ lasāma “it is fast of running.” It is in view of this parallel that I also prefer to translate the dog’s name Šaruḫ-tibušu as “fast (and not: splendid) is his attack.” Note also two Š stem forms that CAD quotes s.v. arāḫu B “to consume” and that both have napištu as their direct object, ušāriḫ napištašu “he destroyed? his life” (YOS 9, 35, 122) and šūriḫ napšassu “destroy? his life!” (passim in the Anzû myth). Usages such as these might also have helped to generate confusion.II 80 (+ 67*; + “Lam. III” 26) In spite of the spelling with /ll/ in the Kuyunjik texts, ē tamtal(l)ik must be understood as Gt vetitive. Many more similar spellings of *mlk Gt forms can be found in the dictionaries. Whether these occasionally were intended to add an iterative sense to the Gt forms needs further investigation."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition238For further attestations of the names of dogs nos. 5 and 6, see Rittig 1977: 198–99. With the name Ē-tamtal(l)ik-epuš-pīka compare also its parallel Ē-tamtalik-ušuk “Without-hesitation-bite,” which leads me to think that pâ epēšu (see CAD E 215f. and P 459a), at least when said about dogs, could also have a stronger nuance than simply “opening the muzzle = barking.” With sikip lemna compare sākip irat lemni.I have no suggestion how to restore the brief gap at the end of the line.II 82 (+ 69*–69a*, [“Lam. III” 28]) Although all the other figurines have names closely related to their task of warding off the demon, their leader, a dog named Sîn-rēʾ i-kalbē, boasts a name that is very appropriate for his superior position and much closer to the patterns of the human onomastica. By invoking the moon-god Sîn, it furthermore emphasizes the fact that the main danger posed by Lamaštu is imminent during the night. 73 For the restoration of the end of the line, see above, commentary to line 75.The restoration of the full text of lines 69*–69a* of the alternative version is still problematic. Text m has a sign GAM at the end of 69*, which, if taken as a gloss indicator, could mean that all of 69a* is actually to be understood as a variant reading for 69*. This could then be restored as [ina apti ša ana tarṣi bābi t]ušeššeb, a solution adopted in my tran-scription and translation. Another possibility is that the GAM indicated insecurity on the part of the scribe regarding the correctness of his text (pītu/aptu?); for marginal marks like this, cf. Wiggermann 1992: 129f. note “a” to IV/1: 5′.II 84–94 Cf. the translation of this portion of Inc. 8 by Nougayrol (1971: 173; edition of “Ai”) which, however, can now be improved in many places, thanks to duplicates not yet known to Nougayrol.II 84 (+ “Lam. III” 89) Inc. 9 shows an identical incipit line (“Lam. II” 119), and the two incanta-tions are kept apart in “Lam. III” only by extending the quotations into the following line. A third incantation with exactly the same incipit is to be found in “RA”. If nothing but the first line is quoted, as is the case in STT 281 (= “Ra”) IV 12, it remains unclear which of the three spells is referred to.II 85 This line is also to be found as a variant to “Lam. II” 35b (text “Ah”) and as line “Lam. II” 121a (text a). For the first half, compare also “Lam. I” 104 and “RA” 5.II 86 The 3.sing. suffix -su, although in the wrong gender, shows clearly that šārtu (for the two variants of the logogram, see Mayer 1988: 149f.) is construed as a singular in all extant ex-emplars. The plural form kippātu (note the plene spelling in texts M and c) thus cannot be a qualifying adjective, but the whole phrase must be an equating nominal clause. kippatu “loop” (from *kpp “to curve, curl”) is not yet otherwise attested as describing human or animal hair. While the basic meaning may refer to “curls” or “loops,” in our context it seems to describe the hair as matted or untidy, inappropriate for humans, and above all wild and frightening to look at.73. Cf. also Wiggermann 2000: 239f. with n. 174. His earlier assumption that Sîn himself serves as the herder of the dogs and that figurines of him are placed with the dogs (Wiggermann 1983: 109) was based on an incorrect restoration of the text."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"239Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryInstead of pūssa “her forehead,” a reading būssa “her shoulder” (compare “OB3” 11) cannot be excluded, but next to her unkempt hair another unpleasant feature of her head seems more appropriate.II 87 For this line, the reading of which is still far from certain, cf. Farber 1987a: 89 n. 11. 74 The biggest problem in my interpretation is that no less than 5 exemplars of different date and provenience consistently write ú-ru for alleged urû “team (of equids),” a word typically found in NA but only sparsely attested in other texts from the first millennium. Next to šaḫû, however, and as the subject of a verb of voluntary motion, some kind of animal is to be expected.The other major difficulty is the second part of the line. The reading of the inconclu-sive traces in texts A, B, and M is based mainly on c as the best-preserved exemplar and its less-than-perfect duplicate “Ai”. Note that the two other Babylonian exemplars (a and b) completely skip this bothersome half line.II 90–91 For parallels to this couplet, see the commentary to “Lam. I” 121–22.II 90 The reduplication of the final radical in G forms of *wbl with short vowel is noteworthy. In our corpus, it occurs in the imperative (in Babylonian exemplars only: here, texts a and b; “Lam. II” 93 text b; “RA” 10 text aa) and in the precative (in both Kuyunjik and Baby-lonian exemplars: “Lam. II” 98 texts B, C2, a, and b). Note that the Babylonian texts n and c seem to never use such forms (see “Lam. I” 121, “Lam. II” 93 and 139), and both a (“Lam. II” 98) and b (“Lam. II” 139) also show forms without reduplication. The phenomenon has, to my knowledge, not expressly been recognized (see, however, the paradigmatic form *ūbil(l)ū quoted in AHw. 1450a) or explained but needs to be studied in the context of the weak and strong conjugations of the verbs I-w.II 92 This is, so to speak, the “eponymic line” for what has been called the illik-ma ibakki con-struction in Akkadian syntax. This syntagm, featuring a preterite or stative (often with enclitic -ma) followed by a present, is used to express a coincidental clause—that is, the verb in the present tense marks an accompanying action that specifies or qualifies the main predicate of the narrative, which stands in the preterite or stative (for a variant of the syntagm, see also above, commentary to “Lam. I” 104–5; a further example is “Lam. II” 141f.). In poetry, such coincidental clauses quite often also show the features of a hinge construction in which one part of speech (subject, object, predicate, or adverbial/prepo-sitional phrase) is placed in a pivotal position between two parallel other parts of the sentence and, without being repeated, relates both forward and backward. In our line, this pivotal phrase is ana pan Enlil abiša, which belongs both to illik (ana . . .) and to (ana . . .) ibakki. Note that the Assyrian texts expressly restate the subject (mārat Anu) but leave out the -ma, but the Babylonian exemplars leave out the subject (which is identical to that of the last predicate of the narrative, ittanazzaz in line 89) but add the enclitic copula. Note 74. CAD Š/I 108a s.v. šaḫurru, although published later than my article, still reflects an earlier reading of the line. CAD U/W does not list the line under urû B “team of equids” nor under any of its homophones or similar words."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition240also that the position of this copula, seemingly separating the first predicate from the prepositional phrase, is very typical for the hinge figure.The genealogy of Lamaštu is occasionally blurred, as in this line where she seems to have two fathers (might this inconsistency be the reason why the Babylonian texts leave out the mārat Anu phrase altogether here?). Compare also “RA” 13 (Ea abuša) in contrast to “RA” 13 22 (Anu abaki) and the cooperative effort of all three of her “fathers” to en-gender and bring her up in “OB2” 1–2. Finally, the mention of a god Nāli? (corrupt spelling for Enlil?) as her father in “Emar” 1 remains obscure.II 93 For the reduplication of /l/ in billu (text b), see above, comm. to “Lam. II” 90.Note the different forms of the vocative of abu: plain nominative abu (text b), diptotic construct+suffix abī (texts A, C2, a, and c), triptotic construct+suffix abuʾa (B), and what seems to be a hypocoristic (GAG §56s) form abūtu “daddy” (M; in view of many other ir-regular forms in this Sultantepe text, however, not too much weight should be placed on this variant).II 94 Texts M (Sultantepe, an exemplar that has to be used with caution) and possibly B seem to construe šīr amēlūti as a feminine plural (the attested plural form is šīrū, which is con-sistently construed as a masculine). Note that a, although expressly writing UZU.MEŠ, shows the adjective in its singular form.II 95 For našpūti, compare “Lam. I” 187 and 190 (with commentary).II 96–100 These lines contain Enlil’s answer to Lamaštu, which Wiggermann (2000: 240) takes as describing a mock ritual set in a mock temple. It remains grammatically possible but not very likely that Enlil continues to be the speaker in lines 101– 4. In 105, at the very latest, the words are again those of the conjurer.II II 97 The specific (magical? derogatory?) meaning of a “house of clods” (the “mock temple” in Wiggermann 2000: 240) remains unclear. The common use of ki/urbannu clods to chase away unwanted birds and other obnoxious animals may have played a role in the choice of words here.

It might refer to an unmarried girl of relatively safe age (as far as dangers from Lamaštu are concerned) and thus well suited to bring her the objects mentioned: too old to be attacked as a baby or child and too young to be of interest for her as a potential mother. Another possibility might be to see this line as referring to a “bride-to-be” and to assume that little girls might customarily have made offerings of this kind to Ištar or other suitable goddesses in order to ensure a good marriage later on. Wiggermann (2000: 240), when talking about a “mock cult,” may have thought along the same lines, while expressly assuming that the kallatu ṣeḫirtu “young bride” is a “potential victim.”75. qallatu “slave girl” (thus Scurlock 1991: 156) is excluded, since KAL cannot be read /qal/ in SB texts."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"241Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryII 100 gurāru, generally considered a variant of kurāru “carbuncle,” is spelled with /g/ in all five extant duplicates of our line. This spelling is only once attested for “carbuncle” (l ú . g i g .p e š = ša gurāri, OB Lu A 398). The meaning “embers” is based solely on that of kurāru and on our line and therefore remains open for discussion. Some negative connotation seems appropriate in the context. The meat preparation quraštu (see CAD Q 315a, which tenta-tively derives the word from *q/grš “to carve”) might also be related to our noun (*qurartu? Cf. the similar change between /r/ and /š/ before /t/ attested for kurar/štu “carbuncle”).II 103 Compare the use of wood shavings from the plows mentioned here in the accompanying ritual, line 117/115* // “Lam. III” 40. The magical meaning of this conjuration and its ritual counterpart still escapes me, but one might speculate about a connection to the “clods” in line 97.II 104 Both dictionaries have cross-references from ezību to uzību “abandoned child,” but under the latter lemma, neither one adduces evidence for a by-form *ezību. A conjuration by “the abandoned child and his son/offspring” might have seemed intriguing, but unfortu-nately the equation *ezību = uzību is thus not established. We therefore rather have to read a plain G participle ēzibu “a person who abandons a child,” thus making this an oath “by abandoner and his (abandoned) child.”II 105–7 See Farber 1975: 178 (quoted as “Lam. II 102”). Note that the -ma at the end of the line is not the enclitic copula but the emphatic particle often used in this construction, even though in this case additional predicates follow. Text b adds “(if) you draw close to this baby.”II 108–9 For dogs belonging to specific deities, see CAD K 71a. The dogs of Ištar and Nanâ men-tioned in our line are not included there (cf., however, CAD M/II 106a and the figurative use of the term kalab Ištar in an incantation against field pests; see George and Tanaguchi 1999: 294 and 2010: 85). 76 The meaning of the couplet is most likely that the sleep of the patient (line 110), be it mother or baby, should not be disturbed by the dogs’ barking. The other possibility, to understand pī kalbi ṣabātu as “to prevent a dog from biting,” seems to me to make considerably less sense in our context.II 110–11 A possible duplicate to these final lines of Inc. 8 is STT 146, where the copied traces might support a reading 1[LÚ.N]Á? ina m[a- . . . . . . . . . . . . ] 2ạ-di ina-[p]a?-[ḫ]u? d[UTU . . . . . . . . . ] (collation necessary!). This remains, however, very uncertain. Even if this reading were basically correct, STT 146 might still be a parallel to another incantation with a similar ending (cf. below, comm. to line 111) and has therefore not been included in the score.II 110 For parallels to this often misunderstood line (cf., for instance, CAD E 326b and AHw. 247a) see CAD K 75a and Farber 1989a: 48 §5:72.76.

I” 173 with commentary). Either of these readings is preferable to an interpretation of the spelling as evidence for (otherwise unattested) spirantization of the final radical of *ḫbt.II 121a This stock phrase, inserted here only by text a, is identical with “Lam. II” 85.II 122 The verb *nšī requires a concrete substance or object to be “lifted,” which in our passage excludes a translation “tracks, footprints” for kibsu. I therefore return to the tempting, though admittedly otherwise unprovable, idea of AHw. 472a s.v. kibsu 5c, to understand the word here and in similar passages as “(track >) dung, droppings.” Unfortunately, the second verb of the line is damaged, but the remaining traces are consistent with a reading ilappat, which, next to inašši, would make good sense here.

I” 40 and 41, and 43– 45.II 129–34 The texts from the Lamaštu series show this incantation in a unilingual Sumerian ver-sion known also from several amulets. In addition, a bilingual version of this spell was incorporated in the canonical series of z i - p à incantations edited by Borger (1969: 1–22). Texts “Ed1” and “Ed2” belong to that compendium (see Borger 1969: 12 §XXII, exemplars A and B). Several additional fragments have since been joined to “Ed2” (Borger’s B). The relevant passages of both “Ed1” and “Ed2” have been recopied for this edition of the Lamaštu texts. Translations of the incantation have been offered by Frymer-Kensky (1995: 104; with some notes at the end of her book) and by Wiggermann (2000: 242; according to text “Ak”; cf. ibid., n. 185 for text “Am”).II 130 di[n].in ir.[ál] in “Sa” is probably a misspelling from dictation.II 131 The variant from text a (s u m u . u n . d a instead of š u m u . u n . d ù) is repeated in the abbreviated version of this incantation in Lam. amulet no. 24, edited in Farber 1989c: 77. “ Tausendfüssler,” i.e., “millipede,” in Farber 1983: 442a is an editor’s Verschlimmbesserung of my manuscript."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"243Lamaštu Series II: Commentary95, 3. In the amulet, the phrase is followed by an interesting variant s a g . g i6. g á instead of a . z á g g i g . g a. For this second part of this line, see in more detail below, commentary to ll. 131a-132a.II 131a–32a With the new joins, text “Ed2” ([ . . . ]-ú) clearly calls for a verb IIIae inf. and thus almost certainly confirms the equation š u – d u8/d ù = kamû for 131a; Wiggermann’s trans-lation “who holds . . . in a tight grip,” although ostensibly based on the Sumerian text, seems also to reflect this equation. At the same time, [ . . . ]-ú rules out, at least for this exemplar, the traditional restoration *kāmât. Unless one accepts an unusually serious mis-take in gender, the masc. participle kāmû can, I think, only be taken as the descriptive noun “binder” as an a epithet of Lamaštu (for similar usages of this participle not followed by a noun in genitive, cf. CAD K 131 s.v. kāmû adj.). asakku marṣu at the end of the line should then also be understood as syntactically parallel to kāmû, and not as the genitival object of Lamaštu’s actions. In the following line 132a, “Ed2” once more shows a form in the nominative (alû kabtu), which qualifies it as a third, syntactically parallel, descriptive epithet of Lamaštu. This, however, does not work in “Ed1” where the form alê kabti clearly suggests the traditional interpretation of the couplet as a genitive construction “the binder of the grievous asakku demon (and) of the ‘heavy ghost of mankind’.” The Akkadian ver-sions of the two z i – p à texts “Ed1” and “Ed2” thus actually expose a major semantic vari-ance, and at present I am unable to decide which one was originally intended in this spell, or stays closer to the Sumerian wording. Of further interest is also the variant in Lam. amulet no. 24 (quoted above, comm. to line 131) which is phonetically similar but gives a completely different meaning to the line: “who binds? (s u m u . u n . d a) the blackheaded (people).” Is this simply a mistake from dictation, an attempt to read sense into an other-wise obscure line, or maybe even a correct rendering of an older version of the line? My translation basically follows the Akkadian version of text “Ed2” and thus avoids saying too many good things about Lamaštu, even if they were only part of a ploy of adulation (maybe even with a touch of sarcasm?) in order to get rid of her more effectively (version of text “Ed1”).II 133+a The reading šurbūtu, 78 which confirms g u l / g u - u l as a byform of g u - l a, is now quite cer-tain, and all earlier readings and translations can be laid to rest. Compare also the epithet šurbât in “Lam. II” 152 and “MB” 2.The text of amulet “Am” (Sumerian only) adds another two flattering epithets after í b . g u . u l “eminent,” these being n i n m a ḫ . a “lofty lady” and  i š . t u k u a . r a . z u “the one who listens to prayers.” It then goes on to write l ú . t u . r a (for l ú . t u . r a . r a/š è?) instead of simple l ú . r a, but this does not seem to make too much sense here, since Lamaštu typically approaches healthy, not sick, people.II 134 In spite of the vowelless spelling ta-mat (ending preserved only in one exemplar, “Ed1”), I take the form to be a 2.f.s. stative *tamâti, since a 3.f.s. stative tamât “may she be conjured” would be quite unusual in this standard context. I have to admit, however, that in our 78.

Maybe the whole text of lines 129–32 should there-fore be understood as part of one long nominative phrase acting as subject to the infinitive of purpose ana lā ṭeḫê rather than as an address in vocative to the demoness. This would yield a translation “ To the effect that Lamaštu, the daughter of Anu (etc. . . . . . .), (i.e.,) the eminent Lamaštu, should not come close to man, may she be conjured by heaven, be conjured by earth!”After this line, text “Am” again adds three additional lines:12zi den.líl.le lugal kur.kur.ra ḫé.pà13[z i] dnin.líl.le nin kur.kur.ra ḫé.pà14[z i] dnin.urta ibila é.kur.ra.ke4 ḫé.pà12May the life of Enlil, king of the lands, be implored,13may the life of Ninlil, lady of the lands, be implored,14may the life of Ninurta, the heir of Ekur, be implored.Note that, after the z i - p à formulas at the end of this spell, the concluding rubric phrase TU6 /TE ÉN is again left out (see commentary to lines 57–59).II 136–50 This spell has been translated by Haas (1986: 145; from F. Köcher’s manuscript), Foster (1993: 866; from the previously published sources), and Frymer-Kensky (1995: 105; based on an older manuscript of mine).II 137 Text Ψ from Uruk, a notoriously unreliable duplicate, differs here substantially from all the other exemplars. Most probably, it had a sequence of five instead of three 1.c.s. statives ending in -āk. Of these, the first, although mostly broken, was probably parallel to the standard version ([su-ta-a-a]k). Instead of the enigmatic 79 nam/n/ggiṣṣāku that follows in the other duplicates, Ψ then seems to have an equally dificult sequence diʾāk niʾāk raḫḫiṣāk. While the first of these forms could perhaps be connected with the ailment diʾu, I know of no lemma that would yield any understandable sense for the following *niʾāk. I thus wonder whether these two words might be no more than a mumbo-jumbo rhyming pair *diʾāk–niʾāk. Following raḫḫiṣāk “I am destructive,” there still seems to be sufficient space in Ψ to restore [namurrāk], parallel again to the standard version.II 138 Text a is more laconic than the others: “I go in and out.”II 139–40 For parallels to this couplet, see the commentary to “Lam. I” 121–22. Note the spelling tu-lu-ú-a in text Ψ, which is the only variant to our phrase that expressly includes a pos-sessive suffix of the 1.c.s.II 141–44 A similar passage is “Ug” IV 3′–6′: “(Aruru?) went wee[ping] before Anu, before Antu her tears were flowing: ‘She (= Lamaštu) has destroyed the work of our hands, what we have created the wind is carrying away!’ ”II 141 The substitution of Ea for Anu (again only in text Ψ ) is more likely a mistake than a theo-logically relevant variant.79. See CAD N/I 118f."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"245Lamaštu Series II: CommentaryII 143–44 The scribe of text Ψ confused the subjects of the verbal forms, leading to a rather nonsensical version: [ammīni] ša ibnû nuḫallaq [u ša ušab]šû nubbal šā[ra] “Why should we destroy what she created, and carry away the wind that she brought into existence? ”II 145–46 The enclitic -ma after leqēši and rukussi cannot be the connective particle and therefore has been interpreted as lending emphasis to the two imperatives.II 145 The correct reading of the end of this line is now finally proven by text Ψ. The metaphor ṣupur šadî “fingernail of the mountain,” describing the uppermost rocky outcrops, had not yet been attested but fits very nicely to the well-known ubān šadî “finger of the mountain = mountain peak, rock spire.” Frymer-Kensky’s rendering “edge of the mountain” (Frymer-Kensky 1995: 105 and notes in the back of the book) intuitively got close to the mark even before the Akkadian text had been established.II 146 For a parallel, see “Lam. II” 47 with commentary. For the readings *ēdu and *aḫû, cf. Far-ber 1987a: 90 with n. 16.II 149–50 The individual exemplars seem to try, with more or less success, to adapt the well-known kīma-qutri motif (see CAD Q 326f.) to the context of expelling Lamaštu. Unfortunately, only the rather unreliable text Ψ is sufficiently well preserved to yield an understandable (though otherwise unparalleled) version: kīma qutri āla liṣṣi lā [inaḫḫis] “may she leave the city like smoke (and) never return.” C2, although partially broken, most likely read kīma qutri ana š[amê lītellī-ma] lā inaḫḫis “may she go up like smoke to the s[ky and] never re-turn.” Text c might have been similar to that, but in the break probably substituted simple liṣṣi for ana šamê lītelli. Text b needs only a minor emendation (⟨-ri⟩) to be read kīma qutri liṣṣī-ma lā ineḫḫis. Text a is the most problematic, inserting li-[?] AN-e after qut-ri and be-fore [āl]a? liṣṣī-ma. Lack of space seems to exclude a restoration lī[telli], unless we assume an otherwise unattested value *tili for the sign BAD, which would still fit into the gap. Such a restoration would yield the most complete version of the phrase: kīma qutri lī[telli] šamê [āl]a? liṣṣī-ma lā ineḫḫis “may she [go up] like smoke to the sky, leave the [cit]y, and never return.”II 152–65 Translated by Haas 1986: 145f. (from F. Köcher’s manuscript) and Foster 1993: 865 (from previously published sources).II 152 (+ “MB” I 2; “Ug” V 31′) For muʾammilat laʾûti, see above, commentary to “Lam. II” 34. It is probably also to be restored at the end of the line in “MB”. From the length of Inc. 12, it seems very probable that “Ug” V 30′f. contained the beginning of the very same incantation which, after a break of approximately the right size, in col. VI 1′ff. provides a parallel to lines 171ff. Unfortunately, the remaining two signs in V 31′ could belong to the beginning of almost any Lamaštu incantation, and final proof that they duplicate our line is thus not possible.II 153 (+ “MB” I 3) Note that “MB”, as well as texts C2 and a, show a plene vowel indicating a dual for the first subject, rittāša “her (two) claws.” Unfortunately, all three texts are broken at the crucial point for the second subject (kir[imma/āša]). An unambiguous dual form here might have added valuable information for the exact meaning of the word (see comm. to “Lam. I” 143)."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition246II 154 (+ “MB” I 4) The variant dannat “she is mighty” in the oldest extant version (“MB”) suggests a misreading *ba for na somewhere in the later tradition, resulting in labbat as the accepted version in the first millennium texts (note that text C2 even uses a rare CV gloss to a CVC sign, babat, to remove any lingering doubts about the reading). In this sequence of verb-derived descriptive adjectives, I prefer our form to be also from the verbal root *lbb (see already CAD E 169b; our line is not quoted in CAD L 24a, labbu B), rather than translating “she is a lioness” (from substantival labbatu) or even “she is a bitch” (*kalbat).II 155 (+ “MB” I 5) The exact (negative) nuance of muttabbilat is hard to grasp. It may be com-pared to the use of the Gtn participle of *wbl, to describe aggressiveness in battle. This is attested in STC 2, pl. 75,6 (Ištar as muttabbilat kakkē), and several times in the Anzu epic (Ninurta as muttabbila/u qab(a)la anunti, and Ningirsu as muttabbilu sibittam qablī), 80 al-though in all these instances muttabbilu is followed by a logical object (“weapons”, “battle” etc.). Foster 1993: 865, translates: “an abductor.”II 157 (+ “MB” I 7) The root *šlp is usually of the a/u class. Reading i-šal-lul in C2 as i-šal-lup, I assume a root variant u/u for the verb (variation between a/u and u/u root vocalism is not too uncommon in Akkadian). Less likely are the readings LUL=láp (cf. AS4 no. 207 for a single, very questionable example for this reading) or lul=lip (against CAD Š/I 230f., which postulates a much more difficult root variation a/u : a/i, based on our form only). “MB” probably had the regular a/u class G present išallap, or a D present (cf. the variant ušallap in text b).II 158 (+ “MB” I 8) For the understanding of *unamzaz as a form of *nss “to sing” see Civil 1983: 50 n. 2. This is preferrable to the interpretation in CAD N/II 353 (nussusu “to shake, flap,” with an otherwise unattested nuance “to rock a baby”). Foster’s translation “she stands it up” (Foster 1993: 865) seems to derive the form from uzuzzu (D?) and is ostensibly based on his restoration of the final verb as *ittanallak, now obsolete.II 159 (+ “MB” I 10) Mighty or dangerous weapons are occasionally described simply as “big” in Akkadian literature, also in metaphoric use; see for instance En. el. IV 49 iššīma bēlu abūba kakkašu rabâ. I thus see no need to search for a different interpretation of GIŠKU/TUKUL in our passage, 81 especially now that “MB” has clarified the reading kakku beyond doubt. “MB” shows another nice example for the (archaizing?) use of rabbû for the predicative plural of rabû (see CAD R 16b). In the second part of the line, CAD N’s interpretation, followed by Foster, also has to be rejected. Once more, “MB” offers final proof that *namšišū of the later texts is a by-form of the stative namuššišū, as already recognized in AHw. 728. Our passage (quoted un-der namšašu) should thus not be separated from the adjective *nam(m)uš(š)i/ušu “agile,” regularly used as an antonymic euphemism for “stiff = dead”. 82 Whether there was also an 80. See Vogelzang 1988: 31 l.14; 38 ll.184 and 186; 97 ll.38 and 40.81. For our line, a meaning “breasts” has first been suggested “between the lines” by Reiner 1974: 233. It has then be taken up by CAD N/I 247a s.v. namšašu, translating “breasts(?)”; by Foster 1993: 865; and most recently by Wiggerman 2000: 230 with n. 90.82. Cf. CAD N/I 235b; the different etymology proposed by Borger (1991: 42), deriving the word from Sumerian *n a m . ú š, is hardly convincing but may reflect a learned later interpretation of the term."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"247Lamaštu Series II: Commentaryirregular infinitive to *nmš of that same form, as postulated in CAD N/I 223a (with a mis-leading reference to “GAG Erg.-H. p. 19**”; only the well-known adjective is mentioned there!), only further texts can prove. In BWL 42, 79 (mašâ-ma na-mu/nam-ši-ša šēpāja, quoted CAD N/I s.v. namāšu 1 e), to understand the form as an infinitive is unsatisfactory since mašû “to forget” otherwise never takes an infinitive as direct object and the entries in OBGT XV 13 and Nigga Bil.

Different and somewhat tempting, although as far as I can see lacking any outside proof, is the interpretation of Foster (1993: 865): “the one . . . with no child of her own,” a description that, however, would have befitted Ardat-Lilî better than Lamaštu.II 161 (+ “MB” I 11) “MB” clearly refers to Lamaštu’s teeth (šinnāša in the dual reflecting both jaws) and compares them to those of a donkey (šinnāt now in fem. pl.; cf. also “Lam. II” 36, where the constr. sing. šinni is used). The later text b seems to have reinterpreted the two references to teeth as šinnatu “likeness,” as first recognized in AHw. 1243a. This does not make much sense right before the mention of Lamaštu’s lips in line 162. The other SB duplicates are broken at the crucial point, and so it remains unclear whether this was an individual mistake of this text b, or reflects an authoritative version of the first millen-nium. In view of this, I decided to follow the older, and in my opinion better version in the translation.II 162 (+ “MB” I 12) Note the spelling ziq-ziq-ma for ziqziqum-ma in text b, which almost looks like a pseudo-logogram (*ziq.ziq-ma). “MB”, in what is probably simply a dittography, re-peats šinnāša (the last word of the preceding line) at the beginning of this line, instead of šaptāša in the later texts. “MB” also changes the grammatical subject for the second half of the line to a singular (itabbak), more likely referring to Lamaštu herself than to ziqziqu “gale.” The later texts continue instead with a dual/fem.pl. form utabbakā and the teeth as the subject, unless we assume a semantically unwarranted ventive here.II 163 (+ “MB” I 13) For a parallel, see above, “Lam. II” 35.II 164–165 (+ “MB” I 14–15) The stative nuʾʾurat (*nʾr D), attested in “MB” and in the Kuyun-jik texts, fits the comparison with a roaring lion, but for reasons unknown to me has been reinterpreted to read namurrat “she is terrifying” in texts b and “Sd”. Based on the earlier copy of C2, the end of line 164 has been read UR.IDIM by F. Köcher (unpubl. manuscript), CAD L 38a, and Wiggermann 1992: 174. Text “Sd” now shows unequivocal kal-ba-tum (see also “MB” I 14, kal-ba-ti); in b, KAL.BE should accord-ingly be read kal-bat. C2 remains problematic, with a clear UR followed by an inconclusive trace. The attestations of *lḫb Š (“MB” I 14) and its derivative stems, Štn (164) and Št2 (“MB” I 15), all seem to be intransitive here, and thus do not qualify for causative mean-ings. Intransitive Š stems are usually derived from verbs of state and tend to express elative meaning, the basic forms being statives and verbal adjectives (šurbû, šūquru etc.). Starting"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition248from these, finite Š forms often intrude into the realm of factitives for these same verbs, replacing or intensifying existent D forms. Beyond this, intransitive Š forms are very un-common, and their derivational meaning is hard to grasp. My translation “to whimper” for both G and Š (intensified to “howling” in Št2) is a guess based on context and following the suggestion of CAD L 38a; note that AHw. 527b translates the Štn as a true causative, sacrificing much of the expected sense of the line. For Št2 as a further intensification of Š see Michael Streck 1994: 173ff.; the pair ušalḫab—ultalaḫḫab in “MB” yields a prime example for this function.“MB”, showing lines 164 and 165 in reverse order and adding an extra verbal form in each line, produces a couplet consisting of two hinge constructions. In both lines, the prepositional phrase kīma x connects backward and forward with both predicates. In ad-dition, the poetic finesse of the passage is heightened by the increase in syllable numbers (“Ehelolfsches Wortfolgeprinzip”) and intensity (stems!) of the two line-final predicates, ušalḫab and ultalaḫḫab (see above).“MB” I 16 Lamaštu is also described as having the head of Anzû, the mythical lion-eagle, in “FsB” 18.“MB” I 16b–18 The second half of the line leads into a six line passage characterized by iterative tn-stems which is reduced to one single line in the later tradition (166). Syntactically, ittanatbak seems to form another hinge construction with ittanamzaz (line 18), with line 17 indicating the time for both verbal actions.

The phrase seems not to be attested elsewhere.166 (+ “MB” I 19) With the reading bardâ/î now clarified by “MB”, the translation “crosspiece (of a window),” and the restoration of the verb as šurru Dtn “to lean over” is no longer in doubt.“MB” I 20 Reduplication of /q/ in the fem. pl. of tub(u)q(t)u “corner” is occasionally attested in 2nd-millennium texts from varied proveniences; see, for instance, YOS 10, 54, 15f.

Compare also the hybrid singular tubuqqatu from Nuzi (e.g., HSS 5, 39, 9), which CAD T 449a lists separately under tubuqtu B “(mng. uncert.)”, but then still translates as “corner(?).”The restoration of the predicate of this line remains somewhat tentative.

My transcription and translation assumes the latter.“MB” I 21 The restoration of the verb remains difficult. Since a transitive predicate is needed, an Ntn stem of a verb I-l is excluded. At the same time, none of the transitive verbs of the structure *ʾ/n/t-l-C which might have a Gtn makes any sense in our context. I thus hesitantly opt for *ʾ lk Gtn which is attested several times with a direct object, although this tends to be a geographical feature (wilderness, mountains, etc.), and the meaning thus is “to roam about in xx.” For a possible parallel, where xx atalluku might also mean “to run around xx,” see Etana II 82 and 109 (see Novotny 2001: 18): sa-da-a-ti ittanallak. 83II 171 (+ “MB” I 26f., “Ug” VI 2′f.)

II 170”), and compare furthermore BAM 234, 16–17. For the different determinatives preceding šikkatu (GIŠ and DUG) see comm. to “Lam.

II 171”), see Farber 1987a: 100.II 175 (+ “MB” II 1; “Ug” VI 7′) The earlier texts show *lwī Št2 present here, yielding another impeccable example for M. Streck’s group 2.2 (Michael Streck 1994: 166ff.) in which the Št2 expresses the causative of a passive N. The underlying notion is *ṭēnša ēdēnīta illammi “she gets encircled by her own unique plot,” which then is put into causative, with Asalluḫi as secondary agent: “You (= A.) cause her to get encircled by . . .” The later texts simplify this by using a plain Š stem: “You (= Marduk) encircle her with a unique plot.” The apparent use of the pret. tušalmīši within a long passage of present tenses (172–77) makes no sense to me, but I also hesitate to understand the form as exhibiting an other-wise unattested e-vocalism, without regressive vowel assimilation, for a present *tušalmēši. 83. In the given context, a physical feature of the bull’s carcass around which the eagle is running would yield the best sense. Unfortunately, there is no fitting such noun, and the meaning of the hapax legomenon *sadāti remains unclear (Novotny 2001: 48). Interpretations include AHw. 1002: pl. of sādu “meadow(?)”; CAD S 17a: adv.(?); Foster 1993: 453f.: “outside(?)”; Kinnier-Wilson 1985: 96ff.: “area.”"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition250Note that in “MB” ṭēmu is construed as feminine (in “Ug”, the defining adjective is broken), while in the first-millennium texts it is masculine.II 177 (+ “MB” II 3; “Ug” VI 9′) The variance between texts a and b (tuparrakši vs. tušappaksi) can also be traced back to the earlier versions, where “MB” is siding with a, and “Ug” with b.“MB” neatly spells out a singular šadîm, to follow the numeral “seven,” see GAG §139h for similar examples also from the second millennium. Note also that it is only here and in the same word in II 15 that our text expressly uses mimation, ostensibly to distinguish the singular šadî(m) from its otherwise homophonous plural, šadî, as in I 13 and II 17. In the same exemplar “MB”, the spelling ÍD.MEŠ in the parallel phrase of the preceding line makes it probable that a regular plural nārāti(m) was intended there, giving us two different number constructions within one couplet, for whatever grammatical or stylistical reasons,.II 178–80 (+ “MB” II 4–6; “Ug” VI 10′–15′) “Ug” shows a different arrangement of these lines, and also some major textual variants. It starts in 10′ (second half indented?) with the conjuration by Asalluḫi; continues in 11′–12′ with an order for Lamaštu not to return and not to step over something, which is different from both other versions by negating *tūr and *blkt N instead of *snq and *ṭḫī; and in 13′–14′ probably changes the word order of Nabû’s intervention.“MB” II 4 has prohibitives (lā + present) of *snq and *ṭḫī, which the later version in 178 replaces by negated final infinitives (ana lā ṭeḫê/sanāqi). Note that text c in this line continues to speak of Lamaštu in the 3.f.s. (-šá; for line179 see below), while a and (prob-ably) C2 shift here to the 2.f.s. (-ki).“MB” II 5 is difficult. A spelling AK.AK (or KÌD.KÌD), plain and without any pho-netic complementation, for kikkiṭṭû in non-ritual context is not otherwise attested. Also, Nabû is not otherwise known as a god specifically connected with rituals. Furthermore, the two signs are written more superficially than the surrounding signs, with the second AK leaning to the left and showing an unwarranted extra vertical wedge. It thus seems likely to me that we should ignore the AK.AK altogether as an aborted attempt to write a ligature DINGIR+AK, and that the beginning of the line should thus simply be read as itabbalki Nabû “Nabû will take you away.” Whether or not the second half of the line contains an allusion to the river ordeal, I cannot tell.The beginning of “Lam. II” 179 is closely parallel to “MB”, but the second half (DINGIR.MEŠ ŠEŠ.MEŠ-šú; only preserved in text c) does not seem to make any sense, as can be seen from my very literal translation of the line. Maybe this phrase was simply an acoustical misunderstanding involving a change from /r/ to /l/: iraḫḫīšu > *ilaḫḫīšu, re-interpreted as ilī aḫḫīšu?180 and “MB” II 6 are virtually identical and pose no additional problems.II 181–82 (+ “MB” II 7–10; “Ug” VI 15′) This section is most elaborate in “MB”, where Ea, Ninurta, Marduk, Ṣarpānītu, and Šamaš are named. “Ug” invokes only Ea, while the later version shows Šamaš and Ea.

The later version has “do not enter!”II 184 (+ “MB” II 12) tassaḫ[ḫarī] (*sḫr N) from “MB” is replaced in the later version by the G stem form tasaḫḫurī.II 186 (+ “MB” II 15) “MB” shows a fem.pl. of abnu which, according to CAD A/I 54b, is oth-erwise only used as the plural for individual and countable stones or stone objects (jew-elry, weighing stones, etc.). Our line, referring to natural rocks, may make it necessary to reconsider this position and go back to the less specific statement of AHw. 6a: “m. u. f. . . . Pl. abnū u. abnātu.” Note also that “MB” first wrote the predicate as a precative masc.pl. lik-tam-mu-, then erased the -tam-mu-, wrote a new UD(=tam) over the erasure, and continued with -ma for fem.pl., exposing a certain insecurity about the gender on the side of the scribe.II 187 (+ “MB” II 16) The use of *sḫl with šikkurrāt elpeti clarifies the meaning of šikkurratu as a hard, piercing part of reeds and sturdy grasses; cf. already CAD Š/II 435 85 which, however, takes š. as a variety, and not a part of reeds to be used for pickets and fences. The Sumerian equivalents (especially g i . s u m u n “old reed”, and g i . ú š “dead reed”) seem to show that š. actually should mean the dry, hardened stalks of cut reeds etc., and not, for instance, the pointed young shoots. The spelling of “foot” or “feet” in “MB” is not absolutely certain. The traces seem to fit best to G[ÌR-ki] or G[ÌR.II-ki], but collation could also not rule out a syllabic spelling starting with š[i] or even š[e].II 188 (+ “MB” II 17; “Ug” VI 16′) Rather than assuming a double construct chain, I take e/irīšu ṭābi as a descriptive apposition to šadî. “Ug”, although too broken to prove the point, makes it even more likely by showing an accusative [ir]īša ṭāba (note that *ʾ lī can be construed with ana + genitive like in “MB” and probably in the canonical texts, or with an accusative of direction, as presumably in “Ug”).II 189 and “MB” II 18–20 (+ “Ug” VI 17′?) In both older versions, Lamaštu seems to be urged to apply her destructive activities to the animals of the wild, while the later version sim-ply sends her away to the realm of the aromatic trees high up in the mountains and thus unreachably far away.To understand ḫi-il (var. ḫi-i-li) in 189 as an imperative, parallel to ṣabtī and ullidī in “MB” II 18/20, is difficult, since no transitive verb *ḫīl is otherwise attested in Akkadian. 84. This phrase was misread by van Soldt 1991: 420.85.

The traces in a corresponding to UD-ma of the Kuyunjik texts seem to corroborate the reading *enūma, although [šu]m-m[a] can-not be absolutely ruled out; if this were the correct reading, the indicative iṣbassu would certainly be appropriate, and an otherwise unattested spelling UD-ma = šumma might be considered.Lam.

The scribes of all ex-emplars seem to have added unwarranted KÁ signs at several places. Unfortunately, the library text A is also broken at some of the crucial spots. My translation, especially in line 4, thus relies heavily on emendations and is based primarily on the pictorial record of the Lamaštu amulets (see Farber 1987a: 85ff).III 5–6 For readings, restorations, and individual interpretations of the paraphernalia mentioned here and regularly depicted on Lamaštu amulets, see Farber 1987a: 92–95.

At least for the time being, it re-mains impossible to prove or disprove the interpretation as mule figurines (AHw. 837a). 90III 36 The meaning (as well as the syntactical connection) of *ḫuppī (or kappī? Cf. AHw. 444b) remains unclear. Not showing an adjectival plural, it seems to qualify lippu as an apposi-tion, but none of the respective nouns 91 makes any persuasive sense. CAD’s assumption that ḫúp-pu should be in singular, next to a plural lap-pi (CAD L 200) is not borne out by the variant spellings ḫúp-pi. My decision to read *ḫuppu rather than *kappu is based mainly on the possibility that the sound of the word is somehow reflected in the phrase ḫuppani ḫuppu in the non-Akkadian mumbo-jumbo line 58.III 36(b)–41 With this passage, compare Rit. 8 = “Lam.

The spelling NA4.MEŠ GÚ instead of *NA4.GÚ.MEŠ, the latter well attested for “neck stones” or necklaces (see CAD K 448f.), speaks, I think, also in favor of my interpretation of the phrase as containing a Š stem *tušaṣbat, literally “you let (the stones etc.) grab/surround (the neck).”III 44–45(a) See “Lam.

The phrase “all the eye-stones and parû stones” thus occurs at a different point of the ritual in each text. When one tries to read III 30–63 as a continuous ritual that should make sense in itself, it does not seem very likely that this phrase should refer back to the stones mentioned in ll. 35, 42 and 43, since these should not be used for a second time but rather stay in their place. The irritating phrase might thus have originally crept into the canonical compilation(s) from a text similar to “RC” 12–27 which contained a parallel to our lines 47–56 as a separate ritual, but had already indicated the total number of stones needed at its beginning.

This school tablet from Babylon thus may not actually be an excerpt from “Lam.”, but rather a late exemplar of one of the rituals which were used to make up the ritual tablet in Nineveh.III 49, 51, 53, 55 Note that the color of the stones mentioned here, and the wool they are to be threaded on, seem to match: šubû > white wool, ṣurru ṣalmu > black wool, kapaṣu > red wool, and aban parzilli > bluish wool. While the colors of ṣurru ṣalmu (black) and kapaṣu (red) had been known before, and a bluish, shining or iridescent quality of aban parzilli “iron stone” is very plausible, the correct identification of šubû (usually translated, if at all, as “agate”) is still open to discussion and should take this indication of color (white, or translucent?), into consideration.III 57–60 For this spell, see the parallel in the compendium of baby incantations Farber 1989a: 68 ll. 223–228, and the preliminary edition of our passage (1989a: 70).III 61–62 For these lines, compare the similar spell in Farber 1989a: 74 ll. 255–257, with com-mentary on pp. 75f.III 66–68 The parallel “Ra” IV 5–9 replaces qīru “hot bitumen” 92 with the very similar napṭu “naphtha,” puts some of the ingredients in a different order, omits azallû, and adds “mut-ton lard, [ . . . ]-fat, (and) cedar resin” before adding the ingredients up as “22 ointments against Lamaštu.”III 69–73 Text H, instead of giving the incipits to Inc. 2, 3, and 6, quotes only Inc. 7 (“Fierce is the Daughter-of-Anu”) and 6, and leaves out the phrase “ These three incantations” in l. 73.92. In spite of my own translation “frischer Asphalt” (Farber 1987: 260) and the new questions raised by Stol (2012: 57a), I am convinced that ÉSIR.KÚM = qīru refers to hot, liquid bitumen, as already argued by CAD, and not to “new/fresh bitumen (ÉSIR.GIBIL4).” Maybe the clearest example for qīru to be hot, K 888, 16 (still quoted as unpubl. in CAD K 416a) has now been published and edited by Schwemer (2006; see also Schwemer 2007a: 76)."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition256The parallel “Ra” IV 10–15 adds a reference to Inc. 8 or 9 (identical incipit, “She is fierce, violent”), adjusts the instruction in l. 73 accordingly, and adds an extra line promis-ing the success of the ointment..III 74–75 The parallel “Rc” I 16–19 changes the order of the ingredients and ends with a sum-mation “altogether nine fumigations against D[imme].” “Ra” I 33 adds after the two lines “nine herbs, [fumigations] against Dimme.”III 76–102 For discussion and commentary to the incipits quoted here, cf. the commentary to the corresponding lines of “Lam. I–II” (see also the concordance in Table III, pp. 64–65).III 85 For the occasional use of a plural *libbū(ŠÀ.MEŠ) “abdomen, belly” see CAD L 166b and the Asb. passages cited there, p. 166a. A reading qerbū “intestines” would make no sense in our passage which calls for an external region of the body on the same side as irtu “chest,” and opposite of naglabu “back.”III 94 The instruction to recite Inc. 11 over the patient’s right foot is also preserved in text Ψ 12, where it follows the text of the incantation as an independent ritual.III 99 In C3, just before qu-ta-ri, two heads of vertical wedges remain visible which seem to be left over from an erasure. Compared with ll. 101f. (three fumigations, three locations), our line should have mentioned only one fumigation, since there is only one location. I therefore assume that a numeral (3?, possibly a presumptive dittography from l. 101) has been incompletely erased when the clay was already starting to dry.III 103–9 For similar passages, often using the same incantations to conclude other apotropaic texts or sections thereof, see Abusch 1974: 254 with n. 10.III 103–4 For the use of eʾru and libbi gišimmari in apotropaic rites, see most recently Wiggermann 1992: 79–85; our passage (103–6) is quoted there as no. 3. For still another incantation addressed to gišm a . n u, accompanied by a ritual using eʾru sticks, see Farber 1989a: 60ff. §13 ll. 186–203. 93III 105 This incantation is also quoted in von Weiher SpTU III 69 §9 col. VI, to be recited over 2 figurines of “twins” (cf. Wiggermann 1992: 110 no. 13+h, who chose not to include the Uruk text in his edition). Unfortunately, the reading and meaning of the incipit is still uncertain; note that Wiggermann 1992: 80 (quoting our line) provides a different seg-mentation of the Sumerian signs (*u d u g ḫ u l .  á l s a g g a z . z e . d a) but at the same time refrains from a translation.III 106(b)–9 For similar sections introduced by arkišu which conclude specific rituals with more general apotropaic rites, see Abusch 1974: 254f.III 107–18 These three incantations are also quoted in the same sequence in lines 38– 41 of the ritual tablet of muššuʾu (see most recently Böck 2003: 1–16). It is thus probably no coin-cidence that they are used here at the end of a section which starts (“Lam. III” 76) enūma šerra tumaššaʾu.93. Note that KA-šú in l. 203 is possibly to be read appašu, and talappat then might refer to the stick and not to the baby; cf. also ibid. l. 216."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"257Lamaštu Series III: CommentaryIII 107 For an edition of the short incantation series *saba see Schramm 2001. After Römer (1989: 465b) had proved the existence of at least two spells with the incipit s a g . b a s a g .b a (cf. also Köcher 1966: 21b), Schramm could now reconstruct two tablets which both contain just one bilingual incantation starting with these words. Since these two incan-tations, however, belong to different types and serve different purposes, Schramm could make a valid point that his Tablet I (CT 17, 34–36 and dupl.) is actually the one to be used here (see Schramm 2001: 12).For the incantation tummu bītu, still only partially known, and its use in different ritual contexts, see most recently Wiggermann 1992: 111–12; Finkel 1991: 102 ad no. 30, who argues for the existence of more than one incantation with this incipit; and Schramm 2001: 8f. with nn. 47 and 53. An incantation of this title seems also to be mentioned in the ritual KAR 144 to improve the profits of an innkeeper; see Farber in Farber, Kümmel, and Römer 1987: 278 (only in duplicate B = ABRT 66, 1).III 108 For the complete text of the incantation a b . t a n a m . m u . u n . d a . k u4.ku4. ( e.)NE, see Borger 1969: 10–12 §XXI and cf. Schramm 2001: 8 with n. 48. The spell is also used in the series šēp lemutti (Wiggermann 1992, text I 258–59, with the additional duplicate Beck-man and Foster 1988: 23 obv. 13). Cf. also Finkel 1991: 102 and Böck 2003: 11.III 109 An incantation with this beginning is not otherwise known to me.III 110–35 See “Lam. I” 23–31, 47–57, and 94–99. “Lam. I” treats these three sections as indi-vidual rituals, each of which accompanies a specific incantation. In “Lam. III,” they are slightly rearranged to form a complex seven-day ritual that stretches all the way to line 135. Line 110 specifically marks the starting point as the evening (i.e., the beginning) of the first day, “Lam. III” 119 specifies the fourth day for the second section, and “Lam. III” 130 probably contained a similar indication for the fifth day, which is now lost. In con-trast, no specific days are mentioned in “Lam. I” 23, 47, and 94. Besides that, the wording of the three ritual sections from “Lam. I” and the continuous ritual of “Lam. III” is virtually the same.III 120 The restoration t[ukattam] in C3 is purely conjectural, especially since *ktm G and D usu-ally refer to covering something in order to make it invisible or decent. Other possibilities could include t[umalli] “you make (her head) full (of hair)” or t[uʾappar] “you arrange (hair) as an upru (on her head).”III 121 For tunamtassi see above, commentary to “Lam. I” 49, and below, to ll. 124f.III 124–25 The variant te-em-[ . . . ] in text E seems to reflect a rare dissimilation of reduplicated voiceless /p/ (*teppuš > tempuš; cf. GAG §32c). Note that the same exemplar also shows a variant tunamtassi for *tunam/dassi (line 121), a spelling that also might imply a dissimila-tion involving voiceless /t/ (cf., however, the commentary to “Lam. I” 49 explaining the difficulties of deriving this form from any known verb). The same text, E, skips line 125 altogether.III 129 The Babylonian text E uses zipadê *tmā instead of the more common formula nīš xx *tmā found in the Assyrian duplicates D1 (“Lam. I” 57) and C3."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition258III 130 Although my restoration of [UD.5.KÁM] is admittedly conjectural, I prefer it to Wig-germann’s “zesde dag,” ostensibly based on the insertion of an extra day in l. 126 (Wigger-mann 1983: 107). A seven-day ritual seems to me to be magically more appropriate than an eight day sequence.III 137–39 Unfortunately, no parallels for this concluding passage are to be found in “Lam. I–II,” and the general sense remains obscure. For tēqītu, see most recently CAD T 347f., where our line is quoted under meaning c), “salve for the eyes,” although it certainly has nothing to do with eyes. Cf. also Wiggermann (1992: 27), who proposed a more general “liquid paste.”Starting in line 138, there might have followed some instructions to remove(?) the dog figurines described at the beginning of “Lam. III”, if kalbū is indeed the correct read-ing. Closing the circle in this way could well be an appropriate ending to the complex activities prescribed in our ritual tablet.Fig. 21.

Since then, the text has been quoted extensively in both dictionaries and translated by Wiggermann (1983b: 297); Fos-ter (1993: 59); and K. Hecker (in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 64f.). It was also reedited, although somewhat sloppily, by Wilson (1994: 72–74). For some collations, see Farber 1981: 72.1 By translating “er is een godin,” Wiggermann (1983b: 297) brushes aside von Soden’s still valid arguments for the reading adopted here, ellat “she is clean,” which K. Hecker (in Janowski and Wilhelm 2008: 65) interprets as “ungebunden = free, unrestrained.” A discussion of the concept of ellu in this context is offered by Wilson (1994, specifically on p. 74).2 I follow von Soden in taking appulat as an Assyrian form of *uppulu, but this interpreta-tion is by no means certain. CAD M 282b refrained from translating the line, which is also not quoted in vols. A or U/W. Wilson translates “she is an heiress,” which is certainly not correct. Most recently, Hecker derived the form from *ʾ bl and translated “ganz vertrocknet = completely dried out,” which is not very convincing either.5 For the reading lamnat, see Landsberger 1958: 57 n. 7 and Farber 1981: 72.8–15 I take this passage as one long hinge construction centered around ippuṣašši (see already Foster 1993, note to line 7). The preposition ana leaves it open whether the expulsion of Lamaštu served as punishment for her past misdeeds or as a passport to future destructive actions. The rendering of the passage by Wilson shows some involuntary humor in depict-ing Lamaštu (against all rules of grammar) as a stupid nymphomaniac.16 For the stative D waššarat instead of expected *waššurat, see Hecker 1968: §9a. An analy-sis as a stative G of *(w)ašāru(m) (thus CAD A/II 422b s.v. *ašāru C, repeated in CAD U/W 312a; and AHw. 1484a) could phonetically be possible in view of the occasional non-elision of short vowels before /r/ (see GAG §12b). Since, however, no G stem forms corresponding to the D (w)uššuru(m) otherwise exist, 1 I consider this highly unlikely.1. All context references for the G stem quoted in AHw. 1484a should be interpreted differently: OB *wašrū sikkūrū (ZA 43: 306:2, with an SB parallel ašrū s.) is probably a hypercorrection of a form without initial /w/, belongs Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"315Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary17 Cf. commentary to “RA” 5.21 I have not adopted the emendation proposed by Wiggermann (1983b: 297 note c) to read here lá-ki !-i-im “zuigeling” instead of the tablet’s la-áb-i-im, especially in view of the occur-rence of lá-i-im in line 23. For dialectal differences in the forms of *laʾûm “baby,” see Farber 1989a: 136–38.22 For this line, cf. Farber 1989a: 138.24 This line remains unclear. Against my collation (in Farber 1981: 72), CAD lately 2 re-turned to the suggestion by von Soden (1956: 143) to read ta-ra(?)-šu(?) and now trans-lates “she will weaken(?).” The traces in the copy look more like ta-áš-šu-ku, but this text nowhere else writes reduplicated consonants, and thus any tempting connection to *nšk “to bite” should probably also be ruled out. Note that Wilson, according to lines 24–26 of his transliteration, seems to give three alternative renderings and translations for this single line, none of them convincing.“OB2”: An OB Lamaštu Incantation on a Single TabletFor the editio princeps, see von Soden 1954: 337ff. (for collations, see Farber 1981: 72). The text has been quoted extensively in both dictionaries. It also has been translated by Haas (1986: 143), 3 Wiggermann (1983b: 296); Foster (1993: 130; repeated with some changes in the third edition, Fos-ter 2005: 173–74). It was studied in detail by D. O. Edzard (in Charpin, Edzard, and Stol 2004: 542–44) and Veldhuis (1999: 41– 45). The most recent edition is available only electronically on SEAL = Sources of Early Akkadian Literature (http://www.seal.uni-leipzig.de, last revised 02/07/2011), a web site under the control of Michael Streck and Nathan Wassermann. I quote this edition without au-thors’ names as SEAL, by text and line only.1–2 SEAL assumes that the mention of Anu, Ea, and Enlil could be taken as a reference to the three paths of the sky and thus tentatively dates our text to late OB or even Kassite times. Especially because the order of the three deities does not follow the later canon, I am not convinced that this is true.2 Wiggermann (1983b: 296) translated “leeuwinnenkop” (followed by Veldhuis 1999; Fos-ter 2005; and SEAL), but more recently (Wiggermann 2000: 232 with n. 108–109) leaves the reading of KAL-ba-tim open again. Among the numerous representations of Lamaštu with a lion’s head, not one shows her with the head of a female lion, *labbatu. Given the additional problems involved in a reading KAL=lab in OB, I thus continue to believe to ašāru “to muster, check, take care of,” and should thus be moved in CAD A/II from ašāru D (hapax!) to ašāru A; similarly, OB *ul wašrāta (AbB 6, 96:6) probably belongs to (w)ašru(m) “humble”; see CAD A/II 455f. Finally, OA tuppi PN wa-ša-ra-am ul imuʾa (VAT 9223:12, unpubl.), the linguistically closest parallel for our OA text that is cited in CAD as further evidence for the G stem (CAD A/II 422b), should be seen as just another example of the phenomenon described by Hecker (1968: §9a) and quoted above for *waššarat. This also makes the emendation to *wa-šu!?-ra-am in AHw. 1484a–b unnecessary.2. CAD R s.v. rašû C “(mng. uncertain),” a lemma that combines unclear references from Mari with our line and in doing so postulates a verb with root vocalism of u/i.3. His rendering, which is quite different from mine and largely based on obsolete readings, is taken almost literally from Köcher 1948: 14."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition316that the correct reading is panī kalbatim, as originally proposed by von Soden, followed by Foster (1993) and also accepted in both dictionaries.3–5 For an interesting translation, based on Köcher’s different segmentation of the text, which follows the tablet more closely than von Soden’s, see Haas 1986: 143: “Sie ist winzig, zwei Handbreit gross ist sie. Finger und Klauen sind lang, . . .”3 While most translators agree that i-ZA-at stands for īṣat “she is lacking, too small,” Wigger-man (2000: 231f. with n. 107), followed by Foster (2005), returns to the earlier interpreta-tion of CAD (see E 433a) *ezzat “she is fierce,” which has since been given up (see most recently CAD R 385a). If the reading *arakat is correct and the variation with *arrakat in line 5 is intended, this seems to be another example of non-elision of short vowels after /r/ (see below, comm. to “OB3” 6). See also SEAL, comm. to lines 3–5.5 See Farber 1981: 72 for inconclusive collations that, however, ruled out the former read-ing *bullulā (thus still in SEAL). The suggestion adopted here (*eʾʾēlā as a stative 3.pl.f. of a habitative *parrās form “habitual binder” derived from the demonic activity eʾēlu) was originally made to me by W. Sallaberger (private communication).6 Again, my collations are inconclusive. While KÁ at the beginning of the line seems pos-sible, there are traces of signs both before and after the break, with the expected u[b] compatible with the former, and [t]i (but definitely not [a]m) the most likely reading of the latter. I have no idea what to do with this at the end of a line, which would otherwise be perfectly understandable.SEAL argues in favor of a sequence preterite—present here (*īrub – iḫallup), but this is not convincing, since in the postulated modal clause the second verb (in the present) should be circumstantial to the first (in preterite, stative, or even another present), and this ideally should also show a connective -ma. The resulting translation “she entered while at the same time slipping in” is rather nonsensical. I therefore continue to believe that a present *irrub is meant here.7–8 Note the plays on words and sounds using ṣerrum “snake,” ṣerrum “door pivot,” and later also ṣērum “steppe,” to eventually rhyme with šerrum “child.” Since it is not always clear which meaning is “correct” (and some of the phrases may intentionally leave open several interpretations), my translation has to be taken with a grain of salt. For more details, see also comm. to lines 14–157 My reading ṣé-ra-n[i] tries to accommodate the trace after the break by combining it with the slightly slanted wedge preceding the break. It is, however, also possible that the trace at the end is nothing but the dislocated end of the line divider between lines 7 and 8. For more adverbs in -āni, see below, comm. to “OB3” 13–14.8 The reading ītamar, originally proposed by Landsberger (1958: 57 n. 7), has been con-firmed through my collation.9 For a discussion of the emendation and the meaning of this line, see Farber 2007a: 143 with n. 29."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"317Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary12–13 Against CAD Q 130a, I take this phrase, an old crux interpretum, to refer to Asalluḫi (or possibly the exorcist? See also Wiggermann 1983b: 296 note c), who is described as apkal-lam šipir Ea “a wise one with regard to the work of Ea,” followed by an additional apposi-tion qardu “a valiant one.”14–15 In reading ṣērum “pivot” in line 14 and ṣērum “wilderness” in line 15, I assume that our text again makes full use of their phonetic similarities with ṣerrum “snake” (see above, ll. 7–8) and its rhyme word šerrum “baby” (line 8). Foster translates “(door)post casing” in 7–8 and 14–15; Wiggermann, Edzard, Veldhuis, and SEAL also think of the door pivot in 7–8 and 14 but translate “steppe, desert” in line 15.15 See comm. to line 21.17 The final traces of this line were left standing by mistake when the scribe erased his earlier efforts, after probably writing pa-ni-(ki) for a second time. Incidentally, the puzzling BU copied at the end of line 18 is almost invisibly marked as a modern copyists’s comment to the -bu- in ta-ar-bu-ʾa4-am of line 17 and thus not part of the text.18 I see no compelling reason for an ad hoc translation “finely ground” for daqqu here, even though ground cress seeds are certainly more pungent than uncracked ones.20 The correct interpretation of this line as an oath in the 1.c.s. “I indeed will . . .” was first proposed by Wassermann (2003: 163) and has since been adopted by Foster (2005) and SEAL.21 Although a juxtaposition of two imperatives alkī “go!” (G) and atallakī “roam about!” (Gtn) in line 15 makes good sense, it is difficult to attach an iterative Gtn meaning in-stead of the expected separative nuance that would have to be expressed by a Gt stem to lū tattallakī in our line. Although the written form allows no other analysis, I am tempted to assume a mistake here and translate the form as a Gt precative *lū tattalkī “may you go away, be gone!”“OB3”: An OB Incantation on a Tablet with an Unrelated Other SpellFor a partial edition, see J. J. A. van Dijk (in van Dijk, Goetze, and Hussey 1985: 25f.). Colla-tions: W. Farber in van Dijk, Goetze, and Hussey 1985: 64. The text has also been translated by Foster (1993: 131; 2005: 174). The most recent edition is available only electronically on SEAL (see above, introduction to the comm. to “OB2”). I quote this edition without authors’ names, by text and line only.1 The reading [b]i?-ša-at is very uncertain (see also my collation in van Dijk, Goetze, and Hussey 1985: 64) but has, for lack of a better solution, been retained here. SEAL’s argu-ments for reading *[g]a-ša-at and deriving the form from an otherwise nonexistent verb gašûm 4 are unconvincing. Wiggerman’s tempting suggestion to read [n]am-[r]a-at (2000: 218 n. 3) does not fit the traces I saw on the original and on a photo made available to me by C. Hess.4. The reference to VS 10, 214 II 1 (Agušāja A) is misleading, since the verb there is gâšum (*gūš), and a derivation as a stative from this root would be both semantically odd (stative of a verb of motion!) and morphologically wrong."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition3182 Van Dijk’s reading i?-l[a-at], followed by Foster, is epigraphically difficult (see my collation) and at this point of the introduction not really expected. Unable to make sense of TUR and the following trace (Ḫ[U]/R[I]?), 5 I therefore prefer to leave the word uninterpreted.3–6 For these lines, see Stol 2000: 177 n. 30, with a slightly different interpretation.4 The text seems to show the more common OB form *tabsūtum for šabsūtu (OB and later).6 sandak as an OB form of santak “all the time” is a bit unexpected since the voicing of plo-sives after /n/ is otherwise a phenomenon considered typical for MB and later. Another indication of a relatively late OB date of our text may be seen in the use of the sign NIM in the mimationless adverbial ending -āni in line 14; see below.Since there is not enough space for pa-*ar-ka-at, we have the choice of three possibilities: 1. simple scribal mistake of RI for AR (reading ⟨a⟩r); 2. derivation from a habitual adjective *parrikum for which the i/i verb parākum might qualify (cf. GAG §55m). 3. non-elision of /i/ after /r/ (see GAG §12b for the same phenomenon before /r/ and before and after /l/).I opt for the latter.8 For a different rendering of this line, see Foster 1993: 131: ina uzzim šālilim “with plunder-ing fierceness”—that is, with a wrath poised on pillaging. Without a clarifying parallel, I return to van Dijk’s reading 6 and Groneberg’s interpretation of the line (see Groneberg 1997: 48 to line 124; Wiggerman 2000: 228 n. 65; Foster 2005: 174 “with demonic fierce-ness”; and most recently CAD U/W 394a).9 For my interpretation of this line (reading sullûm “prayer” instead of sulûm “street” 7), and indeed of the whole passage 9–11, I refer to the close parallel in the OA incantation against the Evil Eye, published by Barjamovic and Larsen (2008; kt 94/k 520). The respec-tive lines (11–15) read: tāḫuz eṭlam ina suppu’im tāḫuz wardatam iš-šuwārim tāḫuz ṣuḫram ib-būd tārītim “It (the Eye) grabbed the young man in prayer, grabbed the young girl while dancing, grabbed the child from the shoulder of the nanny.”12–15 ilān kilallān, the “two gods,” are presumably Asalluḫi and Ea. Note the inconsistency of the following four verbal predicates. While the first two are also in dual (imurāši, ušēṣiāši), the third verb, ušaḫlipašši, appears to be a singular in ventive, which might be considered a scribal error for the dual ušaḫlipāši. Finally, the last form, irkusūnišši, is a 3.m.pl. ventive.13–14 These lines provide two additional examples of OB adverbial forms in -āni, with the sec-ond one (ṣerrēni) showing progressive vowel assimilation and a spelling NIM for /ni/ (to 5. Unfortunately, a restoration of mārat Anim, in any conceivable spelling, does not fit the traces either, although this would have made perefect sense at this point of the incantation. SEAL’s interpretation as a participle in construct (muttadrirat ṣeḫrī “she is roaming around the little ones”) is grammatically untenable, since neither *drr nor its N cognate nadarruru are ever construed with a direct accusative object and the semantically required plural of ṣeḫrum would be ṣeḫrūtim.6.

Corroborating evidence is provided by VS 17, 33: 28, where KA.INIM.MA a-ru-úḫ-tum is also resumed by ki-ki-̣tá-ša, which needs a feminine antecedent. 8 This, however, does not affect the reading of the phrase in later texts, where a masculine noun (regularly resumed by a 3.m.sing. suffix, as in kikiṭṭa-šu) is required and an interpretation as a learned Akkadian loanword *kainimmakku 9 has been proposed.“OB4”: A Fragmentary Incantation on an OB TabletFor a previous edition, see Cavigneaux and al-Rawi 1994: 88f.; their comments have not been repeated here unless further discussion seemed appropriate.

I thus prefer the more literal reading “goat” (also in SEAL’s edition), although it remains unclear why a goat should be mentioned here.I 3′ My restoration is based on “Lam. II” 37 (already quoted by Cavigneaux, who, however, opted for a slightly different restoration).I 4′ Cavigneaux already noted that ša/eršerrum is actually a reddish paste and thus not really suitable for the predicate warqat “is yellowish/greenish,” which, however, fits perfectly the kalû paste (“ochre”) replacing it in the later parallels in “RS” 4 and “Lam.

Other than the rubric line šipat dDÌM.ME (line 5; 11 cf. also the unclear ŠU.PU dDÌM.ME, following two incomprehensible lines of Akkadian? text), nothing in this text is reminiscent of other Lamaštu material. It is, however, worthy of attention, because incantations accompanied by rituals (introduced by kikiṭṭa-ša, ll. 6–9 and 13ff.; see above, comm. to OB3 17) are rarely attested from the OB period.“OB6”: A Fragmentary Akkadian Lamaštu Incantation as a Postscript to a Tablet with Sumerian SpellsOnly the end of this Akkadian incantation is preserved on the left edge of TIM 9, 63.

Its first four lines are loosely parallel to the beginning of Inc. 7 (“Lam. II” 35–38). The text is much harder to read than RS 25.420+, and my edition freely uses both my own copy and Arnaud’s (2007: pl. 5 no. 17), which do not always agree. A final collation after the publication of Arnaud’s edition was unfortunately not possible.1 In view of the two other pre-SB attestations for amurrât “Amorite woman” to describe Lamaštu (“OB1” 2 and “Ug” V 16′, both parallels to “Lam.

Arnaud’s copy and transliteration suggest a reading kun-n[a-at], which, however, has no parallel in other Lamaštu texts.3 kaṣṣat (which is epigraphically more likely than Nougayrol’s and Arnaud’s *ezzat) is re-stored from “Lam.

I take it as a misspelling based on a local pronunciation of the name Lamaštu, which can easily be explained by the Anatolian speakers’ lack of differentiation between /s/ and /š/. Note that CAD A/II 199a also assumes that the text is dealing with a “figurine of Lamaštu.” In spite of the mention of an eṭemmu in line 1, all the ritual instructions of this fragment show quite close resemblances to passages from “Lam.”, although they do not form a continuous parallel to any passage from the later canonical text. 13 This similarity makes the proposed reading, and thus the definition of our fragment as part of our corpus, quite tempting, although it may ultimately have been an unrelated text that was only secondarily associated with Lamaštu through a mistaken reading of *Lamassatu.5′ The apti ṣēli “window of the side” is not attested elsewhere in “Lam.” but is otherwise well known as an entry way for demons into the house (cf. CAD Ṣ 126a and A/II 199a).Rather than looking for a rarely attested garment *TÚGaššiannu(Schwemer 1998: 134f.), I understand the sequence of signs KU A ŠI as a slightly unusual spelling TUŠ.A-ši for *tušeššebši. TUŠ.A = ašābu is not only occasionally used in SB texts such as KAR 377 rev. 46 or CT 39, 42c II 7 but also occurs in a roughly contemporary omen text from Nuzi (Lacheman RA 34, 6:13 and 8:38), although I cannot remember having seen the spelling in other Boghazköy Akkadian texts.“Emar”: A Tablet in Amulet Shape Containing Three Lamaštu IncantationsThis rather unusual piece surfaced on the antiquities market in 1981 in a group of tablets de-monstrably from Emar (see Dalley and Teissier 1992: 83ff.; for our piece, see specifically p. 109 no. 8 and the photographs on pl. XIV). Although the peculiarities of the handwriting and spelling of the Lamaštu tablet also point in the direction of Syrian peripheral Akkadian, its provenience from Emar is only suggested by the other tablets in the group but not strictly proven.I saw the amulet-shaped tablet myself during a brief stay at the British Museum in 1981, when it was brought to the Students’ Room by its then-owner for an opinion, but I had no time to copy it myself. The copy published here was prepared later that year by Irving Finkel, who originally planned to publish the text himself but graciously ceded his rights, his copy, and a drawing of the seal by Dominique Collon to me later. His rendering of this difficult-to-read text is admirable, and only in a few spots, after thoroughly studying the whole text, was I able to improve on the copy by collations (marked *) from excellent photographs sent to me by Stephanie Dalley in 1990. To all of these col-leagues go my warmest thanks.The text is a clay tablet in the shape of an amulet, inscribed with three incantations addressed to Lamaštu. They are arranged into seven sections, the first six of which have seven lines each. Be-tween those sections, and on the protruding handle at the top of the tablet, an uninscribed seal has been rolled all around the amulet. In addition, both the obverse and the reverse are “crossed out” by diagonal lines forming a St. Andrew’s Cross. They are, however, obviously not meant to obliterate 13. Note, however, that very similar instructions can also accompany the manufacture of other female figurines, as, for instance, the one of māmītu in BAM 234, 13–21.

The text is extremely dif-ficult to read, and my attempts to understand it are often no more than a first guess, hopefully to be improved by scholars more conversant with the intricacies and pitfalls involved in tablets from the Syrian “peripheral” area.1 If the four signs i-li-DINGIR-lim actually represent no more than the determinative d of traditional orthography (cf. the similar writings in ll. 20–22, 35, and 43), na-a-li should be the name of the god described as Lamaštu’s “father.” It thus could represent a garbled form of the name Enlil, who, in “Lam. II” 92f., is also described, in a somewhat similar context, as her “father.”2 For a “house” to be built for Lamaštu, see “Lam. II” 97 (cf. also “Lam. I” 113, where Anu and Antu deny her a sanctuary, parakku, on earth).In the remainder of the line, za-ab-bi zí-ib-bi defies interpretation; several Akkadian words could be hidden under this spelling, but none of them seems to make any sense in this context. P. Gauthier suggested to me a simple play on sounds with the preceding bīssa “her house.”2f. My emendation of an epigraphically clear te to im! is a desperate effort to gain a feminine plural verbal form (imlâ “they became full”) to go with the apparent subject ēnā and an adverbial dimta at the beginning of line 3. The final two signs of line 2, e and na, I take as a dittography; for similar cases where our tablet starts a word or phrase in one line, only to repeat the signs on the next line, see ll. 7–8, 17–19, 20–21, and 30–31. If this emendation and my reading of ēnā dimta (IGI.IGI.e-na A.IGI/ÍR, rather than morphologically difficult IGI.IGI.e-na-a-ši = ēnāši) in l. 3 are correct, one might again compare “Lam. II” 92, where Lamaštu approaches her ‘father’ Enlil in tears.3f. This variation on a well-known theme (see “Lam. I” 121–122, with commentary), Lamaštu asking for the babies to be handed over to her, is unique in that it talks about raising the children to adulthood. li-din in this context must be taken as a mistake for the 1.c.s. *luddin.4–6 By emending an irregularly shaped ni sign to pa! (note that the two horizontals are parallel and not angled!), I tentatively take this phrase to be an idiom (possibly a West Semitism) *panī naši “my front (or: face, although sing.?) is lifted” = “I intend (to do something).” No parallels from Akkadian texts are known to me, and the spelling na-ši-ʾ is definitely strange for second-millennium Akkadian (cf. below, line 8: pe-ʾ for pê). An alternative reading of the first sign(s) would be šum!-ma, but this does not seem to yield any recognizable syntax for the remainder of the sentence.6 *tattiṣī, if read correctly, seems to show vowel harmony and thus could be another example of an Assyrianism in “Emar” (see the preliminary remarks by Huehnergard 1983: 42). lā tattallak, if read correctly, substitutes an endingless 2.m.s. form for the expected 2.f.s in -ī (see also the 2.f.s. form *tippattil in line 8!).8 Cf. Maqlû V 11 and IX 77, where the emphasis is on the fact that chaff cannot be twisted into a strong rope; accordingly, I interpret ti-pa-ti-il as an N stem *tippattil. For a different"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"325Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentarypossible interpretation compare Maqlû II 165 and 176, where kīma pitilti patālu means “to tie (somebody) as with a rope.” pi-ʾ then would have to stand for pî—that is, the object of the action: “do not tie my mouth as with a rope.”For the prefix ti- on forms of the 3.f.s. in Western peripheral Akkadian, see most con-veniently Huehnergard 1989: 158f. and, specifically for Emar, 1983: 39f. I am not aware of this prefix otherwise also being used for the 2.f.s., although a mixup between the third- and second-person forms seems conceivable (note the absence of the fem. marker for the second-person -ī on our form).8–9 For ṣâdu “to swing,” said of a door, see LKA 135, 13ff. (cf. CAD Ṣ 58a). The emendation of the final sign in line 8 is based on this parallel.For the next phrase (*aptī lā ta[ . . . ]), a form of šurru “to lean (into a window)” could have been expected, but neither the G-stem prefix ta- nor the following traces support such a reading.10 bēlu kabtu is not a regular epithet of Ea. I wonder whether we have here a case of switched logogram for *bēl nagbi, with DUGUD = nakbatu being misunderstood as also standing for nagbu, which might have been perceived as a masculine cognate (for the opposite direction, the logogram for naqbu, BAD, used for nakbatu in SB omens, see the evidence gathered in CAD N/I 181a).13 Note that line 10 shows the expected vocalism for *nḫs i/i, while in line 13 we see an otherwise unattested a-vocalism: hypercorrection into “Babylonian” of a form erroneously thought to show Assyrian vowel harmony?15 The spelling BÀD-ri leaves some doubt whether the phrase dūr(i) dāri is actually meant here, although no interpretation using dūru “wall” seems to make much sense. An inter-pretive phonetic reading dur8 for BÀD might also be considered.16 The photo seems to allow a reading of the seventh sign ṢI, making it unnecessary to see a reference to manzât, the rainbow, here. manzāzu seems to make better sense in the neigh-borhood of kibsu and mālaku.I understand e-ṣu-ra-a-ti as a mistake for *uṣrāti, the plural of uṣurtu, rather than as iṣṣūrāti “female birds” (cf., however, “Lam. I” 8?). A derivation from *jsr “to enclose, take captive” (e-su14-ra-a-ti) might seem tempting but would lead to major morphological problems.17 I take ra-ab-ba-ti GAL-ti as a repetitive writing or pseudo-dittography and thus translate it only once.17f. ḫajjaṭṭu muttalliku is not otherwise attested but yields reasonably good sense. The mention of rēš arḫi next to it, however, remains unclear to me. My tentative emendation of a clear TA to ša? seems syntactically possible but also lacks any parallels.19f.

The two lines are quoted (from the largely unreadable photo in Dalley and Teissier 1992, pl. XIV?) by Wiggermann (2000: 239 n. 168).23f. I take ka-ab-ru-ri-ti and me-ru-ú-ti to stand for *kabrūti and *marûti, respectively, two syn-onymous adjectives appropriate for domestic animals. The reading alqēki for the following verb was suggested to me by P. Gauthier and makes more sense than my former reading *alkī sūqi “travel (imp.f.) the road.”26f. Note the uncertainty of our scribe regarding the names of the well-known Mesopotamian goddesses Damkina and Tašmētu. For another example of the spelling dtaš-me-NI(ì?)-tum, see Moortgat 1940: 556, 1.29–30 *lidīnanni-ma ilu/ī: No similar opening line of an incantation is known to me, but other options seem even less convincing. The rest of line 29 and the following line seem to be spoken by Lamaštu but remain very unclear, and I am fully aware of the inconsistencies in my tentative translation.30 I have been led to derive *luštaBBīka from *šbī Dtn “to regularly satiate, give (enough) to eat or drink” by the mention of drinking(?) and “food of wailing and weeping” in the next two lines. *wpī Š and *špī D seem to be excluded, since these verbs never take a person as their direct object, but *špū Dtn “let me continuously subdue you” might well be an ac-ceptable alternative.31 The derivation of iš-tu-ú-ma from *štī “to drink” is very uncertain, especially in view of the lack of an appropriate subject in masculine plural. Other options may exist but are not more convincing (ištu “since” as subjunction would require a subjunctive predicate; ištu ūma “starting today” seems absurd in the context).31f. talmadī akal dimāti u bikīti clarifies the much debated reading of “Lam. I” 189 (taltamdī . . . akal dimmati u bikīti), but the attested nuances of *lmd “to learn, become knowledgeable about” do not fully remove the semantic problems of the two passages.The remainder of line 32 seems to make reference to a figurine (ṣalmu), maybe of the exorcist, if e-ši-e-pí can be taken as a strange spelling for *āšipi. Parallels to such a phrase are not known to me.33 The reading ta-rí-tu4 is based on what seems to be a parallel in the following line but is rather shaky on epigraphic grounds.34 bēl ṭēmi is not otherwise attested as an epithet of Adad (or of any other god, for that mat-ter) but only as an unclear term for a human participant in extispicy (see AHw. 1387b). The reading of the signs as EN TI-ME, though epigraphically probable, thus remains open for discussion.35 la at the end of line 35 I understand as the negation, to be followed by a present, for a pro-hibitive predicate. The scribe then repeated the unfinished phrase in line 36 (as he did so"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"327Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentaryoften with dittographies) but on second thought replaced the lā by ē, to write the expected vetitive form.37 DU-UR-ki could stand for dūrki “your wall,” which makes little sense. I therefore also consider it possible that the scribe used DU.UR as a replacement for the logogram DUR = ṭurru “yarn, string,” or even wrote an irregular st.constr. form ṭù-ur-ki for *ṭurra-ki “your string, yarn,” a reading that would be much easier to reconcile with the verb *nsḫ.38ff. Only occasional words are understandable to me for the rest of this incantation. They do not combine into a recognizable sequence of events or into known phrases. All translitera-tions and translations are therefore extremely tentative, and I believe that only a better-written parallel will eventually enable us to understand what the scribe rather ineptly tried to convey.43 I tentatively understand LÚ?ši/IGI.ME-bu-ú-ti as *šībūti and assume a hybrid mixture be-tween a logographic (LÚIGI.ME) and phonetic (*ši-bu-ú-ti) spelling.

Note, however, that “Ug” shows a singular GIŠsippa where “ND” has a plural (sippī) and probably skipped one of the two following nouns (bābī, nērebī).

Although the special regulations concerning marriage and children of priestesses and nadītu women may have something to do with the magical powers of their stillborn 16 children, the mention of kūbu fetuses of the (male) earlier rulers Narām-Sîn and Šarru-kīn goes beyond my understanding.“ND” 14 and “Ug” III 10′ A god’s name *Enʾutila is not otherwise known to me. Although the second part, UD.TI.LA, reminds one of the name of Utnapištim, this association remains speculative in view of the initial dEN. Note also that the parallel line in “Ug” has utammīki nīš e-ni ụ̀ [e]n-ti and that the final en-ti consists of two signs also occurring in the enigmatic name in “ND”, EN and TI: coincidence? Or textual interference and corruption?The end of the line in “Ug”, which seems to mention Anu, remains incomprehensible and is probably corrupt. 17“ND” 15 (“Ug” III 11′–12′) Although the passage is shorter in “ND”, both texts ended this in-cantation with another example of the threatening curse introduced by šumma (the final -ma in “ND” makes this clear enough, in spite of a major break at the beginning of the line); the reference should be added to those collected by me (Farber 1975: 177–79). In reading bīt tuṣî as an asyndetic relative clause, I differ from van Soldt (1991: 443), who understood the phrase as šumma ana bīti tuṣî “if you go out into the house.” Arnaud (2007: 72) gives a correct analysis of the phrase but fails to understand its meaning in the context.Note the vowel in “Ug” III 12′, tasaḫḫarī (the same form has been restored below, col. V 4′, and preserved in KUB 37, 70, 8′). Unless this is a defective spelling for the N stem (see above, comm. to “Lam. II” 184 and “MB” II 12), *sḫr must have been understood here as a/a class.14. The different but hardly correct interpretations of “Ug” III 7 of van Soldt (1991: 258 n. 28) and Arnaud (2007: 64, 68, and 74) both were proposed before “ND” was published or without taking the parallel into account. 15. According to the space available, “Ug” seems to have mentioned three classes of priestesses here (NIN.DINGIR, [LUKUR], and NU.GIG). This makes the correct restoration of “ND” 12 somewhat uncertain: simply [utammēki k]ūbī nadâti, resulting in an omission of the qašdāti women, or [kūbī qašdāti k]ūbī nadâti for a complete parallel but in different order?16. Or: aborted? Cf. Römer 1973: 314 n. 31.17. The reading Anu *An{ni}tu (first suggested by J. Nougayrol and repeated by Arnaud [2007: 64]) is not consistent with my copy of the passage (cf., however, Arnaud’s quite different rendering of the cuneiform signs) and also fails to convince me, because an “oath” by Anu and Antu usually precedes the other conjurations instead of following them."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"329Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary“ND” 18 The phrase ṣīru u rabû seems out of place in a ritual, unless it is part of the incipit of another incantation, this time addressed to a male divine helper.“FsB”: An Independent SB Lamaštu IncantationSee the philological commentary in Farber 1998: 59–63.

The full text was published by him in transliteration (Nougayrol 1969: 404). When I was in Damascus in 1995, it had been temporarily misplaced, so I could not collate or copy it. It has been copied and reedited, however, by D. Arnaud, in his publication of all the library texts from Ugarit (Arnaud 2007: no. 69 on p. 207 and pl. XXX). Surprisingly, he ignores both previous studies by Nougayrol 18 and subse-quently misreads and misinterprets the short text in several crucial places. My transliteration is based on Nougayrol’s, and differences from Arnaud’s copy and readings are discussed in the commentary.1 Nougayrol’s transliteration e n (for é n) is clearly a misprint, as shown by Arnaud’s copy. In general, A.’s copy can, with only a few adjustments, be reconciled with Nougayrol’s correct readings, but his own rendering (damar.ud dumu dí d) and his comments on this line should be ignored.2 Note the phonetic spelling with p a d instead of p à(-d) in text b.3 With the exception of the last sign of line 3 in text b, where Arnaud’s copy suggests LI in-stead of the KI read by Nougayrol (an improvement I have followed in my transliteration), N.’s readings correspond very well with Arnaud’s copy— actually, much better so than A.’s own, which again are off the point. The direct connection of Lamaštu with k i . s i k i l . l í l .l á / ardat lilî in this line is noteworthy, 19 although I wonder whether the phrase is used here as a descriptive epithet rather than as a reference to a “real” demonic figure.The meaning of the phrase TUR/d u m u A.DU d u10. g a, which is repeated in the fol-lowing line, remains somewhat doubtful. Following Nougayrol’s lead in reading A.DU as a . r á = alaktu, I assume that Lamaštu is still being addressed here in an adulatory way reminiscent of the positive phraseology that starts several of the Lamaštu incantations. I do not know on what evidence Arnaud’s rendering of the phrase as aplu gitmālu is based, which leads him to another unwarrented speculation about the protagonist of our text.4 If Arnaud’s copy of line 6 in b is correct, Nougayrol’s reading *t e . é n (Nougayrol 1969: 404 with n. 85) should be corrected into *t u . é n, still another phonetic rendering of the phrase *t u6.én(.é.nu.ru).5–11 With the exception of the first line, which leaves no doubt about the demonic force against whom this spell is directed, and the double mention of Ḫendursanga, a god who does not play a prominent role in Mesopotamian magic, hardly anything of this damaged incantation is understandable to me. Accordingly, my transliteration is mainly guesswork on a text that may have been corrupt already in antiquity.18. Note, however, that he once quotes “J. Nougayrol (Ugaritica 6, Paris, 1969, p. 404)” in his commentary to line 2 and he therefore must have known N.’s previous edition. Even so, he states on p. 207 that he has been unable to find a parallel to the text.19.

Another possibility might be that the form is a mistake for *tašakkan, interpreting the SI as an incomplete SAG and, assuming an anagraphy, reading ta-kan:ša⟨k⟩.

I” 17–20) and that it stands for a real word or phrase. Note that -ma is used on the second and third occurrence only, which prompts me to translate these as “still (the same).” See also comm. to line 14.28 In spite of the extra space available, it may be best to assume that nothing is missing before the damaged sign ÉN and that the recitation of any Lamaštu incantation would have been appropriate here.

If this reading is adopted, “31” ends up being the correct total for the ritual.14 At the beginning of the line, Finkel read [(ina) SÍG].ÀKA. Context, limitations of space, and the basic resemblance of the signs ŠID and SA5 in NB script make it likely that the phrase should be read [SÍG].SA5 or even simply SA5, given the fact that the scribe skipped the sign SÍG several times when writing the different color varieties of his wools.For the reading 3 NA4pạ-r[e-e], see above, commentary to line 1.19 The complete wording of the two incantations quoted here by their incipits is preserved in “Lam.

Note that in the similar ritual “RC” 28 the more general statement “you recite a spell against Lamaštu” seems to replace the requirement of those two specific mumbo-jumbo incantations.“K 888”: A Short Lamaštu Ritual Embedded in a Šamaš RitualK 888, long known to the privileged few through an unpublished Geers copy and to others through extensive quotation in both dictionaries, has finally been published by Schwemer (2006: 197ff.; see also 2007a: 76f.). I refer to his splendid edition only where I think I can further the understanding of the passage or where I disagree with his readings.22f. I assume that the two figurines mentioned in line 22 are actually the two donkeys referred to in the following line and that these in turn should be tied to Lamaštu’s garment (line 23, taking the suffix -šú to stand for /ša/, as it so often does in SB texts). This, I admit, is purely hypothetical and would lend the whole passage a different twist than Schwemer’s rendition; he assumes that the travel provisions that are loaded onto two donkey figurines in ll. 23–24 are provided for two human figurines (line 22) that were to be tied into the hem of the patient’s garment (Schwemer 2006: 201).23f. *ʾmd with double accusative “to load x onto y” (see AHw. 211b) is surprisingly rare and, as far as I know, not known from any other ritual context, but the sense of the passage seems to exclude any different interpretation.26f. As already noted by Schwemer, “Lam. III” 120 also prescribes the clothing of a Lamaštu figurine with a garment of ḫašmānu wool (ṣubat ūmakkal ḫašmāni tulabbassi). I thus do not hesitate to emend line 27 from Schwemer’s TÚG SU (read as ṣubāt zumri) to MU4.⟨MU4⟩-su = tulabbassi, again with a masculine suffix replacing the feminine /si/.27 Schwemer is certainly right to connect ZA-bab kaspi with NA *sabUbu (CAD S 2a). His attempt to etymologize this piece of jewelry by reference to zibû/zibibânu “black cumin” (following AHw. 1000b and Black, George, and Postgate 2000: 309b) is, however, unconvincing."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"335Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary“SpTU”: A Lamaštu Ritual to Prevent Repeated Stillbirth, from a “Sammeltafel” to Avert Fatalities in the FamilyThis prescription is the first one on a tablet that combines different rites to safeguard families from the loss of their children. For a brief overview of the text, see above, text “RA” (p. 36) and, for a more detailed analysis, Farber 1989b: 224ff. 21 The ritual has no similarities or direct textual relationship to other Lamaštu rituals, canonical or non-canonical. It is included here—against my promise (1989b: 225)—because of the fact that it uses a Lamaštu figurine, although in the otherwise unknown context of a rite of dissociation for a woman who seems to have experienced a premature stillbirth and now is trying to avoid similar problems in her next pregnancy. No duplicates or parallels for this section have yet been identified.1–2 What remains of these introductory lines is very hard to understand and restore. No direct parallels are known to me. My readings and emendations 22 of the copied traces are often highly conjectural and, I am afraid, not always very convincing. Even the restoration of [ṣalam mārat Anu], and thus in a way the interpretation of the whole passage as a Lamaštu ritual, remains unprovable, but is very likely in view of line 13.5 This line is final proof that *krk D in Akkadian can have the meaning “to wrap,” as sug-gested by the Middle Hebrew/Aramaic etymology quoted in AHw. 446a (see already Far-ber 1989b: 225 with n. 5). This is probably also the basis for the SB and NA attestations of the G and N stems “to (be) intertwine(d).” The single other reference for the D stem, from a Boghazköy bilingual translated in CAD K 199 as “to gag,” probably also belongs here. If this is true, it speaks in favor of this original meaning in Akkadian, rather than merely being a late loan from Aramaic.7 The restoration of [dUTU] in this line is conjectural and solely based on the fact that a follow-up libation (line 12) is performed ana pani Šamaš.10–11 What makes these lines almost untranslatable is that they are based on double meanings of *šlm “and *jšr 23 which, in addition to their basic meanings “to be well” and “to be straight(forward), go straight toward something,” both have idiomatic meanings related to pregnancy and childbirth: *šlm D also means “to bring a pregnancy to term,” and *jšr can mean in the G “to have a normal pregnancy,” and in the Št “to give birth easily.” 24Although my translations of mušallimtu and bānītu are based on the most general level of meaning (lit., “a woman who brings well-being,” and “a creatrix”), it is obvious that 21. Philological arguments for my translation that were already given there on pp. 225f. will not be repeated here in detail. 22. For the correct reading ú-šal !-li, instead of the copy’s ú-ṣal-li, see already von Weiher 1988: 116. Miscopied? Or ancient mistake?23. Von Weiher instead assumed wordplays between *šlm and *slm and *bnī A and bnī B, but his translation and interpretation of the lines makes little sense.24. Note also the derived elliptical meaning of the Š stem “to straighten (the way) to something > to head for some-thing,” which our scribe used in line 11 in lušēšir ana bīt ašbāku “may I go straight home,” a form that closely rhymes with Št *luštēšir “may I give birth easily.” This rhyme may also have played a role in the multiple-level wordplay, especially since the Š stem occasionally seems to replace the standard Št forms for “to give birth easily” (see Farber 1989b: 226 n. 7)."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition336again the background of the idiomatic meanings is on the mind of the author (“a woman who can bring her pregnacy to term” and “a woman who brings children to life”).11 It seems morphologically inevitable to derive li-iš-šu-ra from *nšr “to diminish,” which in turn renders a reading e-li !-iá “over me” for the following word unacceptable. 25 Unable to reconcile the signs with a word that could be used to describe the deplorable condition of the pregnant woman, I therefore assume that the wording here is just as corrupt as the form of the alleged sign LI and the order of the signs at the end of the line.Since many LB tablets do not reliably differentiate between the graphemes for ina (= AŠ) and ana (= DIŠ), and since lušēšir “to head somewhere” calls for a directional phrase with ana “toward,” I feel justified to interpret AŠ here (and possibly also in line 12) as /ana/, a reading otherwise typical for NA (àna). Note, however, that the rhyming form *luštēšir (see p. 335 n. 24) would have called for the preposition ina instead, maybe giving the scribe a reason for using the slightly ambiguous sign AŠ.12 The end of the line is troublesome. 26 Von Weiher’s rendering *buqāmu(SILA4.UR4) ša imaḫḫarši “a shorn lamb which she receives?” not only newly introduces a “shorn lamb” 27 into the ritual but at the same time has to grapple with the fact that the predicate of the subordinate clause shows no subjunctive ending. The suffix -ši also remains untrans-lated. 28 Syntactically, the only way out seems to be to assume that the sign UR4 is actually an independent noun followed by the possessive -ša and that it constitutes an object that the lamb receives 29 from the woman, -ši. A possible solution could then be to read SÍG! instead of UR4, ignoring the final vertical wedge, and to assume that by “receiving her hair,” the lamb actually became the carrier of the woman’s misfortune and therefore was disposed of as part of the paraphernalia (mimma mala taškunu) that went onto the boat with Lamaštu in line 14.15 I cannot read the end of the line, even though the copy seems to indicate a reasonably well-preserved text. One expects a continuation of the forces mentioned at the beginning of the line and then used to conjure Lamaštu.16 If my restoration of [šumma] is correct, this line is another example of the “Drohfluch,” or threatening curse, that I have treated (Farber 1975: 177–79). My reading ZI (for the plural nīšū) later on in the line is very tentative, but the final phrase *nīšī annûti tummâta could then refer to all the natural and supernatural forces enumerated in line 15.25. elija would, on the other hand, make perfect sense if the form could in any way be derived from *šurru “to lean (over something),” but I see no way to get from li-iš-šu-ra to *liširra. Von Weiher’s translation “möge vermindern gegen mich (das Unheil?)” assumes an ellipsis, but without parallels this does not sound convincing to me. Note also that there is probably another play on words involved here, connecting liššura with the etymologically unrelated forms lūšir and lušēšir.26. See already Farber 1989b: 226 n. 10.27. Note that buqāmu is otherwise never attested as a ritual accessory.28. The German translation “das sie empfängt” could also be rendered in English as “which receives her,” to include the suffix -ši. This, however, does not make much sense and was probably not intended in von Weiher’s translation.29. Yet another possible play on words between the spell and the ritual might be noted here, with imaḫḫarši referring back to limḫuranni in line 10."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"337Non-Canonical Lamaštu: Commentary“BM 33399”: A Fragment with Magico-Medical Prescriptions against LamaštuThis fragment of a magico-medical text contains several prescriptions against Lamaštu-related ill-ness. Note the rubric line in col. I 5′ that traces the preceding prescriptions (also related to Lamaštu?) to an original from the palace of king Hammurapi. Several ingredients and phrases in the following six sections of the text (I 6′–II 8) are reminiscent of the Lamaštu series (e.g., ḫallulāja, ulāpu lupputu, and the making of clay figurines), but no direct parallels seem to exist. iḫiṭṭaššu in II 5 is probably related to the well-known demonic activity of ḫiāṭu (cf. also ḫajjāṭu), although this is not otherwise attested for Lamaštu.A Neo-Assyrian Memorandum“Assur Memo”: A List of Utensils and Materials for a Ritual Involving LamaštuFor my edition of this text, which I had copied in 1981, I also was able to use a more recent hand-copy and some notes by Wiebke Meinhold, who had been assigned its publication under the auspices of the Aššur project but graciously stepped aside when she heard of my older rights of publication.3 The spelling a-nu-ut is the only clearly Assyrian form in this text. It thus seems appropri-ate to assume that the NA vernacular was only used in the introductory lines 1–3 (and maybe also in the broken closing rubric on the left edge, lines 38–39), and the rest of the text reflects the SB usage of the contemporary ritual texts. I therefore did not attempt to Assyrianize the main part of the text in my transcription.4–8 For an elaborate ritual using a Lamaštu figurine, ḫašmānu cloth, and four donkeys with provisions, see Rit. 3 (“Lam. I” 47–53 // “Lam. III” 119–125).6 Although my copy seems compatible with the reading “4̣ ” for the number of donkey figu-rines, which would make a fine parallel to “Lam. I” 52 // “Lam. III” 124, 30 Meinhold’s copy and attached notes show the heads of three vertical wedges and thus speak in favor of a reading 3̣ , unless “4” would have been written in the less common style of ŠÁ. Un-fortunately, the number in line 8, which presumably should be the same, is even less well preserved.8 The complement -e after KUŠDU10.GAN.MEŠ is somewhat puzzling, both because the graphemically expected form after /tukkann/ should have been -né/i, and because the other ingredients seem to be enumerated in the nominative form. Could this be another Neo-Assyrianism, where the plural had lost its diptotic forms in favor of a single case-ending in /i/ (see Hämeen-Anttila 2000: 78f.)?9 The use of a spoon is not otherwise attested in Lamaštu texts, and the second silver? imple-ment mentioned here (sign PAP or KÚR) remains enigmatic to me.10 For a seal made of ḫaltu stone and used in a Lamaštu-related ritual, see also Thureau-Dangin 1921: 162, 2.30. If the broken numeral were “2̣ ,” one could also consider a parallel to “K 888”, 22–23, where one Lamaštu figurine and two donkeys are mentioned."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Lamaštu: An Edition338Fig. 22. Lam. amulet no. 95 (private collection Chicago; photos by A. Ressman, Oriental Institute). “ Threatening” Lamaštu with bird’s head, spindle, comb, pig, dog, a donkey’s ankle, and an unidentified object in the upper left corner. Black stone (obsidian?), 39×25×5mm. Provenience unknown. The amulet, formerly part of the collection of M. S. Yondorf, was acquired around 1938, and has since been in private possession.

No parallels from other Lamaštu texts come to mind for the rest of this memorandum, and it may well be that the initial passage (lines 4–8) refers to the use of a Lamaštu figurine in an otherwise unrelated ritual (as, for instance, “K 888”).11–14 Without the help of parallels, many of my readings remain extremely tentative.15–34 This list of 18×7 = 126 (if the restorations are correct) “figurines” made of sometimes very strange and seemingly unsuitable materials (e.g., lines 26–27) is curious and quite unique. It is hard to imagine that whoever was making preparations for a ritual here (ac-cording to line 2, the person seems to have been a potter) had to keep such a large stock of ready-made figurines at hand, even if they were only very small. I am also not aware of any other ritual that would call for an army of magical figurines, but the sign NU leaves us hardly any other interpretive choice. As far as preserved, the materials mentioned pose few epigraphical or philological problems, with the exception of line 28, where my reading ŠIMḪAB? = ṭūru remains very tentative and hardly convincing and was retained only for lack of a better idea.35–37 Although imḫur-līm and maštakal are occasionally mentioned (see index of words), none of the four plants listed here nor the bronze pot? play a major role in the Lamaštu texts.obv.rev."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"339The Texts: EditionPart III: Three Unidentified Standard Babylonian Fragments with Possible Connections to the Lamaštu CorpusTransliteration“Fr. 1”: A Ritual Fragment (K 17781) 1′ ana GAB x[x ] 2′ pa-ni-šá [ abunnata?] 3′ u SAL.LA t[e-eṣ-ṣir  ] 4′ GIŠ.IGI.DÙ GI[ŠIMMAR ] 5′ Ì.DU10.GA Š[ÉŠ?  ] 6′ ana IGI-[ ] 7′ ṣu-de-[e tu-ṣa-ad-di-ši ] 8′ mu-ši(-)[ ] 9′ ZÌ.MA?.

It remains therefore abolutely unclear whether this fragment belongs here or not.2–3 My restoration is based on Schwemer 1998: 63, where the painting of a navel and a vulva on a female figurine is prescribed (*abunnata ūra teṣṣir). If this reading is correct, it makes it even less likely that our text refers to Lamaštu.“Fr. 2”: Fragment of an Incantation (81-2-4,302)The reference to a demon in the 3.f.s., in connection with the twice repeated form iqabbûši (cf. “Lam.

Words discussed in the commentary are also included. Separate indices for divine, proper, and geographical names are added below.References from the Lamaštu Series (“Lam. I–III”, edited above in Part I) are quoted first. Paral-lel sections between “Lam. I–II” and “Lam. III” are quoted together and marked with an = sign (e.g., I 29 = III 115). Lines from “OB1”, “MB”, and from the passages of “Ug” that are directly parallel to the later series are cited with the pertinent references to “Lam. I–II”, joined to them by a + sign (e.g., II 167+MB I 23). Quotations from lines of “OB1”, “MB”, and “Ug” that do not literally duplicate the canonical text are listed after the references from the pertinent tablet from “Lam.” and are immedi-ately followed by the line number of their closest parallel in the canonical series in parentheses, for example, ‘MB II 4(II 178)’ or ‘Ug VI 3(after II 171)’. References from the non-canonical Lamaštu texts edited in Part II and Part III follow in separate paragraphs. They are generally listed in the same sequence in which the texts are edited above.All lexical variants are included and marked “(xyz)var.” Quotations from incantations (reci-tanda) are given in roman type and those from rituals and ritual sections are in italic. Substantial discussions of words in the commentary are marked by boldface of the appropriate quotation. Refer-ences in boldface and parentheses—for example, (I 103)—refer to words not actually found in that line but discussed in the commentary to it. Some important references to restored words are included, with the location given in brackets—for example, [I 178].Sumerian rubric lines, such as KA.INIM.MA dDIM10.ME.KE4, as well as Sumerian rubric words at the beginnings and ends of sections (ÉN, TU6.ÉN, DÙ.DÙ.BI, etc.) are not included in the glos-sary. 1 Words from Sumerian incantations and Sumerian phrases found in otherwise Akkadian incan-tations are also not included. For Sumerian words and logograms discussed, see the separate index on pp. 378–79.For better readability, I have left out all “prime” markings (′ and ′′) for line numbers from dam-aged text columns, since simple numbers are unambiguous for all identifications of lines in our corpus.1.
