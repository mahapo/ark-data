After themeeting, he returned to his home in New Hampshire. I spoke to him on Fridaynight, a week and a half after he delivered the presidential address. He had taken hispresidential duties seriously and had worked hard preparing the lecture; now he wasrelaxing and reading novels and was in good spirits. He was pleased with his lectureand with the reception he had received from the membership of the Society. In some ways, Jacobsen was a shy and modest man. On the occasion of his pres-idential address, I had enjoyed the privilege of introducing him, and in our conver-sation that Friday night, he was curious to learn what I had said in my introductionthat caused the audience to give him a standing ovation. It seems that he had heardonly parts of my introduction because his hearing aid was not working. I promisedto mail him a copy of my introduction on the following Monday, but I explainedthat the Society had not been applauding anything that I had said but, rather, whohe was and what he had accomplished. On Saturday, the day after our conversation, Jacobsen unexpectedly entered thehospital and underwent surgery. He never regained consciousness and died the nextday, Sunday, May 2, 1993. His death that day was fortunate, for the cancer that wasdiscovered during surgery might otherwise have meant months of pain and debilita-tion. He died, I suspect, as he would have wanted to—without indignity and in thefulness of his power. Up to the end, he was working intensively on a series of philo-logical commentaries to the translations that had previously appeared in his Harps ThatOnce. . . . Typically, he was learning and discovering new things and even, on occa-sion, changing his mind regarding his own translations. Thorkild aged with grace. Just as one can envy Jacobsen his old age and death, so one must admire his lifeand work. Studying with him was one of the most exciting and moving experi-ences of my life. He stands among the great interpreters of Mesopotamian culture.I constantly rediscover—occasionally with surprise, but usually with delight—howfundamental Jacobsen’s insights into and syntheses of that culture are to my ownunderstanding and appreciation of Mesopotamian civilization. For me, at least, hisconstructions serve as a framework and point of reference even when I end upmodifying them or developing alternative interpretations. I am sure that my feelingsof love, respect, and loss for a great scholar and teacher are shared by many others,and certainly by the membership of the American Oriental Society and the con-tributors to this volume. I need only recall the outpouring of admiration and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Preface viiiappreciation for Jacobsen in 1993 and the Society’s subsequent commission of thismemorial volume. As for the contributors, the alacrity with which they responded tomy invitation and the wonderful quality of their contributions attest to their regard.A few comments regarding this memorial volume are in order here. In 1994, theSociety asked me to edit an issue of the Journal of the American Oriental Society inmemory of Thorkild Jacobsen. The single-issue format limited the thematic scope ofthe volume as well as the number of people who could be invited and the length oftheir contributions. In order that the volume have some thematic unity and be a fit-ting memorial to Jacobsen, it seemed best under the circumstances to invite mainly,but not exclusively, Sumerologists who were either members of the AOS or had hadstrong personal contact with Jacobsen and to ask them to write essays that focused onaspects of Mesopotamian literature, history, religion, or culture that had been of par-ticular interest to Jacobsen. But subsequently, I found the single-issue format un-wieldy and not in the best interest of the volume or its contributors and decided,with the agreement of the Society, to produce instead a free-standing volume. Evenso, I could not significantly enlarge the make-up of the volume, but I could assignmore space to the individual contributors. I do regret that many more scholars couldnot be invited. I wish to acknowledge and express my gratitude to several individuals and insti-tutions for assistance received in the course of producing this volume. My sincerestthanks go to Christopher Wyckoff, Alan Lenzi, and Jeffrey Stackert, graduate stu-dents in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, Brandeis University,and Benjamin Studevent-Hickman and Gene McGarry, graduate students in the De-partment of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University, whohelped with editorial work, proofreading, and computer inputting and formatting.The two departments supported the work of their respective students; in this con-text, I particularly wish to thank John Huehnergard for funding, from his own de-partmental research funds, the work of the two Harvard students. Editors of the Ancient Near Eastern section of the Journal —Maynard Maidman,Jack Sasson, and Gary Beckman—have stood behind this project. I am particularlygrateful to Gary Beckman for the valuable editorial suggestions that he made justprior to my submission of the volume to the publisher. I thank the American OrientalSociety for sponsoring the volume and Eisenbrauns for serving as publisher. Biblio-graphical abbreviations, in the main, follow the conventions of the Chicago AssyrianDictionary and the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary. I should note that some of the articles were first submitted as long ago as 1996.I would end, then, by thanking the contributors for the spirit of cooperation and pa-tience that they have displayed. I am sure that Thorkild Jacobsen would have foundmuch to study and enjoy in these essays.

Throughout his life, he was passionately and deeply committed to the studyof ancient Mesopotamia: its land, cultures, and languages. Until his death at the ageof eighty-eight, he continued to be a vibrant and creative scholar, his engagementand fascination in no way diminished. By virtue of his achievements, vision, andapproach, he had surely become the outstanding humanist among contemporaryNear Eastern philologists and archaeologists.Jacobsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark on June 7, 1904, and died in NewHampshire on May 2, 1993. At the time of his death he was Professor of AssyriologyEmeritus, Harvard University. Already as a teenager, Jacobsen was drawn to ancientstudies. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, from which institution he re-ceived an MA in Semitic philology in 1927. There in his native Copenhagen, hestudied Assyriology with Ravn and Pallis and always retained a great respect for thepedagogical style and scholarly positions that they represented. In 1927, he traveledto the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, where he hoped to continuehis work in Assyriology and, in particular, to pursue the study of historical texts withLuckenbill. On arriving in Chicago, he learned of Luckenbill’s sudden death. Hestudied Sumerian with Poebel, but did not wish to write his dissertation with him.

(InCopenhagen, he had studied Hebrew and Arabic in addition to Akkadian and Su-merian, but had not studied Syriac.) With Chiera’s arrival in Chicago, Jacobsenbegan working on the Assyrian dictionary project; Chiera subsequently arranged forhim to participate in the excavations of the Oriental Institute in Iraq.Jacobsen was field Assyriologist with the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental In-stitute from 1929 to 1937 and served as both epigrapher and excavator. Jacobsencollaborated with Frankfort, who led the expedition, as well as with other archae-ologists: Delougaz, Lloyd, and Loud. The 1930’s were an exciting time for archae-ologists working in Iraq. They were especially important and formative years forJacobsen because of the actual physical contact with the land, the experience ofworking in the field and excavating, and the influence and friendship of Frankfort.During these years, he was epigrapher at Khorsabad and in the Diyala region, andhe himself led the excavation at Ishchali. Together with Lloyd, Jacobsen excavatedSennacherib’s aqueduct at Jerwan. Moreover, he was instrumental in introducingsystematic surface survey as a method for the reconstruction of ancient Mesopota-mian settlement patterns and agricultural history.Returning to Chicago in 1937, he began a twenty-five year affiliation with theUniversity of Chicago. At the University, he progressed to the rank of full professorby1946 and served over the next five years, first, as the Chairman of the thendepartment of Semitic Languages and Literatures and the Director of the OrientalInstitute and, then, as the Dean of the Division of Humanities. Especially throughthe office of Director, he gave new shape to the Assyriology faculty of the OrientalInstitute, and to American Assyriology in general, by bringing to Chicago severalmajor cuneiformists who had fled Europe because of the Nazi persecutions (Lands-berger, Oppenheim, Güterbock). Moreover, he set the agenda for American ar-chaeology in Iraq by reestablishing American excavations at Nippur jointly with theUniversity of Pennsylvania, and by setting in motion the surface surveys that wouldlead, for example, to his own as well as to Adams’ important discoveries regardingwaterways, salinization, and settlement patterns. The last years at Chicago weremarred by major disagreements over the policies, direction, and execution of theChicago Assyrian Dictionary. As a consequence of these disagreements, Jacobsendecided to leave Chicago. He joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1962 andtaught in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures until his re -tirement in 1974. During his long retirement, he often served as a visiting professorand taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Columbia University, UCLA,the Uniersity of Michigan, the University of London, and St. John’s College, Ox-ford. The Hebrew University, where he taught on three different occasions duringhis retirement, conferred upon him an honorary doctorate in 1989. He died sud-denly in May, 1993 while still in the fulness of his intellectual powers.Jacobsen began publishing already in 1927.

These works are indicative of many of the di-rections that his future research would take: his exemplary edition and analysis of The Sumerian King List (AS 11; Chicago, 1939), which he submitted to the Uni-versity of Copenhagen for the degree of Dr. Phil.; his demonstration in “TheAssumed Conflict Between the Sumerians and Semites in Early MesopotamianHistory” that early Mesopotamia was a multilingual society devoid of racism—thisat a time when racist categories were normal in the academy; his recovery in“Primitive Democracy in Ancient Mesopotamia” of early Mesopotamian forms ofgovernment; his groundbreaking and breathtaking interpretation of Mesopotamianreligious thought in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on SpeculativeThought in the Ancient Near East (which he coauthored with H. and H. A. Frank-fort, J. A. Wilson, and W. A. Irwin [Chicago, 1946]), wherein he noticed the ex-istence in Mesopotamia of an animistic view of nature but then pointed to theMesopotamian tendency to view the world as a state and thus to reformulate themore natural perception in terms or forms derived from political life; his “SumerianMythology: A Review Article” of Kramer’s Sumerian Mythology that demonstrateda rigorously philological approach to mythology that was yet rooted in a profoundunderstanding of nature, literature, and religious sentiment and thought. Jacobsen’s insights and syntheses influenced and sometimes even determinedthe direction of research in such diverse fields of Mesopotamian scholarship as lin-guistics and language, religion and literature, history and archaeology. He contrib-uted significantly to such central areas as Mesopotamian archaeology, history, andinstitutions; religion, literature, and their modes of interpretation; Sumerian andAkkadian lexicography and grammar. Though interested in the whole of ancientMesopotamia, in the main Jacobsen concentrated on (1) the history and institutionsof Mesopotamia during the third and early second millennia, (2) the Sumerian lan-guage and its literature, and (3) the formative tendencies and basic forms of Meso-potamian religion. We should here take note of some of his work in these areas.(1) He reconstructed the earliest forms of government, the stages of develop-ment of the state, and the process of nation-building in Mesopotamia (e.g., “TheAssumed Conflict Between the Sumerians and Semites in Early MesopotamianHistory”; “Primitive Democracy in Ancient Mesopotamia”; “Early Political Devel-opments in Mesopotamia”) and pioneered the study of Mesopotamian irrigationand settlement patterns (“The Waters of Ur”; “Salt and Silt in Ancient Mesopota-mian Agriculture,” Science 128 [1958]: 1251–58 [with R. M. Adams]; Salinity andIrrigation Agriculture in Antiquity [Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 14; Malibu, 1982]).(2) The analysis of the Sumerian language is certainly one of the great chal-lenges and achievements of 20th century humanistic scholarship, and Jacobsen de-voted much of his scholarly attention to the understanding and interpretation ofthis language and its literature. While paying great respect to Poebel’s analyses andresults, he was able in his studies of Sumerian grammar to register major progressin the most difficult area of Sumerian grammar—the verb. Thus, for example, he"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Tzvi Abusch xxiiwas the first to utilize systematically and comprehensively the principle of fixedrank order for the study of the Sumerian verb and the explication of some of itsmore daunting intricacies (“About the Sumerian Verb”; “The Sumerian VerbalCore,” ZA 78 [1988]: 161–220). (He creatively applied this approach as well to theAkkadian verb [“ Ittallak niâti ”].) He thereby made original and profound contribu-tions to an understanding of Sumerian grammar and stimulated major advances inthe study of the verb and its syntax. Over the years, Jacobsen produced important translations of many of the majorworks of Sumerian literature. Near the end of his life, he produced a major vol-ume, The Harps That Once . . . : Sumerian Poetry in Translation (New Haven/Lon-don, 1987), in which religious poetry—myths, prayers, laments, etc.—is presentedin translations that are no less magnificent and beautiful for their great interpretiveand scholarly value. His translations of this difficult literature are a tour de force of ex-acting philology and artistry; they remain fundamental and seminal. Up to the endof his life, he was working intensively on a series of philological commentaries tothe translations that had previously appeared in his Harps That Once . Jacobsen wasa great philologist but he was surely a poet also. With precision, clarity, elegance,and above all imagination, Jacobsen created translations, renditions, and paraphrasesthat are simple and evocative and yet also illuminate the texts so that they finallyseem intelligible. Typically, he breathed life into texts that seemed wooden anddead and rendered them emotionally alive. As for his interpretations, they invari-ably uncover the concrete background of the texts, articulate their intellectualforms, and enable us to enter their world and grasp their meaning.(3) Certainly one of Jacobsen’s most enduring and powerful contributions is inthe area of religion and mythology (see simply the essays on religion collected in Toward the Image of Tammuz ). He sought to elucidate religious imagery by findingthe underlying natural and social forms and defining the nature of the religious ex-perience itself. In his later synthesis, The Treasures of Darkness (New Haven/London,1976), he developed the idea of divine intransitivity and transitivity, reconstructedthe major stages of development of Mesopotamian religion over the course of 4000years, examined the most important gods, and provided analyses of significant seg-ments of Mesopotamian religious literature. His imagination, his artistic bent, andhis empathic powers allowed him to penetrate and create a meaningful and coher-ent reconstruction of Mesopotamian religion. It is a picture that has texture, di-mension, and spirit. In part, it is personal. He understood that an appreciation of anancient religion requires both objective analysis and subjective involvement. Hesought to combine the varying approaches and sensibilities rooted in both the im-personal and the personal. Thorkild Jacobsen’s career as a cuneiformist and archaeologist spanned much ofthe twentieth century. His work was both fundamental and original, and its impactfar-reaching.

To witness him slowly probing"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Thorkild Jacobsen: An Appreciation xxiiia text by a meticulous and analytic reading tempered by sensitive inquiry is to haveexperienced the philological enterprise at its most profound and beautiful. One distinguishing characteristic of Jacobsen’s approach was his integration ofthe textual, material, and natural evidence—the different aspects, that is, of cultureand even nature—in his attempt to fathom the meaning and forms of Mesopota-mian civilization. His very unique blend of scholarship—a mastery of texts, aknowledge of art and archaeology, a quest for conceptual patterns, and an appreci-ation of the environment and way of life of ancient Mesopotamia—together withhis own deep human sympathy, allowed him to recreate the image of a past civili-zation and shaped his understanding thereof. It will not have escaped the readerthat, for example, “Assumed Conflict” and “Primitive Democracy” were composedat a time when the Nazi threat hung over Europe, that “The Myth of Inanna andBilulu” speaks as much about our approach to reality in general as it does about thecharacters in a Sumerian text, or that his “Toward the Image of Tammuz” revealsnot a little about his understanding of some of the emotions that shape relationshipsbetween men and women. Perhaps, then, he was able to recreate an image of a civ-ilization that had disappeared because he approached the task in an existential spiritand saw an alien and distant human life as something that not only existed in itsown terms but also mattered very deeply for our own cultural, spiritual, and per-sonal lives, indeed, for the enduring human spirit."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" xxv Thorkild Jacobsen’s DanishAcademic Background Bendt Alster Thorkild Jacobsen always considered himself—with his own words—a scholarworking “in the Danish tradition.” He talked of the University of Copenhagen atthe time when he studied there, around 1920, as ranking among the finest univer-sities in the world. Today there is no commonly recognized “Danish tradition,” soit might be worth while briefly to recapitulate the situation of those days, with aview to seeing how Jacobsen may have understood this.Jacobsen received his primary Assyriological education from Prof. O. E. Ravnin Copenhagen, whom he remembered as a severe and highly formal teacher, whoonly became somewhat less formal after Jacobsen received his degree in 1924.From then on Jacobsen spent most of his time in Chicago, where he was givensome unique archaeological opportunities that he would never have had if he hadstayed in Denmark, where unemployment was indeed becoming a severe problem.Yet, in 1939 Jacobsen defended his doctoral thesis, The Sumerian King List , inCopenhagen. During most of these early years Jacobsen continued to keep a summer cottagein Tisvildeleje, on the coastline some 70 kms north of Copenhagen, where he usedto spend some months every year. Jacobsen always preserved a warm remembranceof the place (as appears from a newspaper interview in which he talked of “walkingon the sand of Tisvildeleje”). In 1969 he spent a summer at Asserbo, a neighbour-ing area. Although he had long ago given up hopes of ever returning to Denmark,it was this visit to Denmark that inspired him finally to settle in New Hampshire“on the real countryside,” where he found an environment with some of the samerural qualities, characterized by tall fir trees, yet on a much larger scale.It is worth keeping in mind that one of Jacobsen’s early scholarly commitmentswas the completion of Howardy’s Clavis Cuneiforum , which he undertook at the re-quest of Howardy’s widow. Howardy was a Danish clergyman who held an officeon the island of Funen (Fyn), far from libraries and books. He had constructed hisminute signlist from handwritten copies of the Rawlinson volumes which he had"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Bendt Alster xxviprepared in his limited spare time—summer after summer—during numerous visitsto the Royal Library in Copenhagen—long before the age of xerox copies. Jacob-sen always spoke very highly of Howardy’s work, and continued to use it through-out his life, although he admitted that it was unfortunately outdated already by thetime of its appearance, since Deimel’s Sumerisches Lexikon was already available. An influential scholar in the study of the history of religions, including Meso-potamian religion, was Svend Aage Pallis. In 1926, he published his The BabylonianAkîtu Festival : subsequently, he became professor of the history of religions, andcontinued to take an interest in Assyriology, as well as in Manichaean studies, etc.Pallis’s work on the Ak i tu festival, as well as his other Assyriological publications,are not generally held in high esteem, but Jacobsen acknowledged it as an attemptto study Mesopotamian rituals as part of a living drama taking place in real life. Jacobsen surprisingly never mentioned Vilhelm Grønbech (1873–1948), whoundoubtedly was the most prominent Danish scholar in the study of religions.Grønbech started as an extremely gifted linguist, specializing in Turkish soundshifts, but at the time when he was finishing his dissertation, he decided to shift tothe study of religions, in particular “primitive” religions. Grønbech was a highlycharismatic person who influenced a whole generation of scholars, but his majorworks were never translated and regrettably remain virtually unknown outside hishome country. Among Grønbech’s followers was Johannes Pedersen, professor of Semiticstudies, whose book Israel was first published in Denmark in 1920 (an Englishtranslation was delayed many years owing to unfortunate circumstances). Characteristic of Grønbech and his followers was an outspoken ability to com-bine a strong insight in philological matters with a high degree of intuition regard-ing living institutions. To them the appearance of a seemingly trivial word in anunexpected context may reveal much more about the “true” meaning of the wordthan numerous “plain” attestations. So, in discussions with this school, one shouldnot use as an argument that there are hundreds of references that suggest a simplersolution, but only a few that suggest a more unusual one, which they support.Their answer would be, “well, that’s exactly the point.” This method, which obvi-ously may have promising as well as dangerous consequences, may make some ofJacobsen’s at times controversial conclusions appear less surprising. Jacobsen seemsnot to have read Grønbech’s major works, yet, it is justified to say that at least in-directly he was inspired by Grønbech, even deeply so. In the early days of the study of Sumerian literature, Jacobsen was ahead ofeveryone else as far as the reconstruction of narrative plots was concerned. His un-surpassed intuition became manifest with his review of Kramer’s Sumerian Mythol-ogy , which appeared in 1946. In this sense, Jacobsen drew on the heritage fromAxel Olrik, who was the leading Danish scholar of folktale tradition and legends.His best known work Nogle Grundsætninger for sagnforskning appeared in 1921. Ear-lier studies by Olrik were published in Germany as early as 1909, and Olrik’s ideashad a heavy impact on Gunkel’s Genesis commentary. Jacobsen hardly mentioned"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Thorkild Jacobsen’s Danish Academic Background xxviiOlrik’s epic “laws” in his writings, but knew them and frequently referred tothem in his teaching. Jacobsen took great pride in being linguistically well informed. The leadingfigure in linguistics at the University of Copenhagen was Otto Jespersen (1860–1943, professor from 1893). His well known work The Philosophy of Grammar wasfirst published in 1926, and has continually been reprinted. Though Jespersen’sgreat strength was English grammar, he nevertheless thought in universal terms ofa “science of grammar.” Jacobsen considered this book a classic. The later Copen-hagen school of glossematic linguistics founded by Louis Hjelmslev played no rolein Jacobsen’s writings.Jacobsen frequently asserted, “I always wanted to return to Denmark,” and thisdesire was deeply felt. But it was obvious that Jacobsen soon came to feel at homein the United States, and he probably never thought of an academic career in Den-mark as a serious possibility. He never forgot the instability of his younger years,but he still felt he was indebted to the “Danish tradition.”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 1 The Socio-Religious Framework of the Babylonian Witchcraft Ceremony Maqlû : Some Observations on the Introductory Section of the Text, Part I Tzvi Abusch for Thorkild JacobsenMaster, Teacher, Friendin Memoriam I.

I must apolo-gize for some repetition between Parts I and II, but because Part II was published first, it was necessaryto repeat there, especially in the sections “Introduction” and “Legal Setting” (pp. 468–69 and 471–75), some of the conclusions arrived at in the present study (Part I). My work on these studies in1989–90 was supported by an NEH Fellowship. Building on these studies, I then developed a furtherset of insights in “Ascent to the Stars in a Mesopotamian Ritual: Social Metaphor and Religious Ex-perience,” in Death, Ecstasy, and Other Worldly Journeys , ed. J. J. Collins and M. Fishbane (Albany,1995), 15–39. I wish to express particular gratitude to Kathryn Kravitz for valuable assistance and sug-gestions during the preparation of this essay.

Abusch, “Mesopotamian Anti-Witchcraft Literature: Texts and Studies. Part I: TheNature of Maqlû: Its Character, Divisions and Calendrical Setting,” JNES 33 (1974): 251–62, espe-cially 259–61. See below, §IV.2. The definition of I 1–72 as a discrete introductory unit is evident not only from position andcontent but also from the fact that the original work began only with line 73 (for the evidence andargumentation, see my “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual Maqlû and the Origin of a Babylo-nian Magical Ceremony,” in Lingering Over Words: Studies in Ancient Near Eastern Literature in Honor ofWilliam L.

Abusch, Babylonian Witchcraft Literature: Case Studies [Brown Judaic Studies 132; Atlanta: 1987], 85–86, with86, n. 1.). The compositional and dramatic unity of the middle three incantations is indicated by in-ternal textual cross-references and by the overlapping of related motifs. Note the netherworld and thenetherworld judge Gilgamesh (second incantation); B e let- Íe ri, the scribe of the netherworld (fourthincantation); the gods of the night sky (third incantation) and Anu and Antu (fourth incantation). Fur-thermore, KAR 94: 19–23, the commentary to I 42ff., links the city Zabban of the third incantationwith the quay mentioned in the fourth incantation. Compositional unity is further suggested by therecurrence of the common stylistic feature of pairs and pairing in the three incantations (note thecounterpoint of speaker and witches in lines 39–40; the repetition of the name Zabban in line 42;the focus on two gates in lines 43–45; the repetition of the statement regarding the position of thetwo gates in lines 44–45; the frequent use of synonymous parallelism in lines 50–60). Further supportfor unity is perhaps also provided by the absence in Maqlû I Ms BM 43826 + 43835 of a dividing linebetween the third and fourth incantations (obv. II 2 u /3 u ). BM 43826 + 43835 has a dividing line be-tween the fourth and fifth incantations, as is to be expected.

Finally, the fifth incantation is a call to the powers ofnature.But the language of discourse is not wholly natural or even supernatural.Rather, the several magical addresses are set into a distinct social framework; theyare clothed in a legal guise, and the ceremony constitutes some form of judgmentand execution. Central to the introductory section is the indictment of the witchesand their imprisonment, prior to and in anticipation of their subsequent judgmentand execution in the following sections of the work. Thus, in the opening incan-tation, the speaker invokes the gods of the night sky and asks that the witch be in-dicted and bound over for trial for having attacked him unjustly. He receives afavorable preliminary hearing from these gods. 5 In the next three incantations, thespeaker invokes and secures an oath sanctioned by the netherworld: He invokesthe gods of the netherworld to assist him in enforcing the m a m i tu , “oath,” and inmaintaining control over the witches in what is both a magical and legal conflict. 6 Finally, in the fifth incantation, he calls upon various natural forces to serve as wit-nesses and to support him in his battle with the witches.But while it represents some progress to state that, in their present setting, thefive introductory incantations in Maqlû serve to recall, invoke, and impose a di-vinely sanctioned oath and curse and to secure the imprisonment of the witchespreliminary to their judgment by Nusku and execution by Girra in I 73ff., it re-mains true nonetheless that significant portions of the introduction (especially lines37ff.) are not yet understood.The text of the introduction, especially lines 37–60, is slippery and very diffi-cult to pin down; it is laconic and elusive. Although most of the words are notparticularly obscure, it is nonetheless difficult to reach a clear and satisfactory inter-pretation of the passage. But to understand the context of the work as a whole, wemust understand this section. 7 The passage, especially the middle three incanta-tions, will thus serve as a jumping off point from which to explore some of the cen-tral issues of Maqlû . Accordingly, I shall focus on several of the major problems ordifficulties of this section and suggest an overall construction that is intended to il-lumine not only the passage, but also the conceptual and ideological framework ofthe work as a whole. 5. For a translation and detailed discussion of I 1–36 (Incantation One), see Abusch, BabylonianWitchcraft Literature , x-xii and 85–147.6. From Zabban he calls again upon the gods of the sky for their support in this further venture.For a detailed presentation of this interpretation of I 37–72, see “Socio-Religious Framework, PartII,” 477–80; for a discussion of Zabban, see ibid., 484–90.7. This study has its genesis in the many attempts that I made to interpret this section of the textand create a framework in which to understand these incantations. I have constructed and rejected anumber of different interpretations. Perhaps it is too much to hope that the present interpretation is“correct,” but I hope that at the very least it represents a significant step towards an understanding of Maqlû .

Focusing especially, but not exclu-sively, on Incantations Two–Four, I note some of the more obvious problems: In-cantation Two: Why are er ß etu and Gilgamesh invoked and to what does m a m i tu refer? What is the identity and nature of the addressees in lines 39–41, and whatidentity does the speaker himself assume? What acts have the witches performed?To what is the speaker referring when he says that there will not be a releaser? In-cantation Three: What and where is Zabban, and what role does it play? Why doesthe speaker turn to the gods of the sky, and who, precisely, are they? IncantationFour: What and where are the quay and pass? What cosmic structure is here as-sumed? Why are both the heavens and the netherworld involved, and why is theresuch strong emphasis on the netherworld? Why is B e let- Íe ri invoked, and what isthe substance of the speaker’s request to her? Why are the various forces of natureinvoked in the fifth incantation, lines 61–72? 10 These questions must be answered if we are to gain a fuller understanding ofthe setting, plot line, and meaning of these incantations. The difficulties encoun-tered in these incantations are caused or exacerbated by a number of factors.(1) This passage cannot be understood simply in the context of normative rep-resentatives of the witchcraft corpus nor interpreted in terms of the thematic vo-cabulary of that corpus. The themes found in this passage are relatively rare, andeven where their formulation recalls themes found in other witchcraft texts, theirmeaning here is different from that of similarly worded themes in those texts. For 9. I understand the ox and sheep here as offerings to the (divine) judge.10. These questions will be addressed in the course of “Socio-Religious Framework,” Parts I and II.

But here, in line41, the speaker actually asserts that what the witch had done cannot be released,that there will be no one to release them. The incantations and themes are atypicalof the corpus, and we must find another context against which to read this material,a context that employs a different understanding of the image and its meaning.(2) Moreover, here in Maqlû the nature of the section I 1–72 only compoundsthe difficulty of reading already difficult material. The section is introductory andrepresents a dramatic progression. In contrast to central parts of the ceremonywhere a theme is often repeated in a number of variations, each of our incantationsis a separate and unique speech, a part of a progressive series that is not repetitive.In contrast to myths that may also contain speeches, our text does not have an ex-plicit narrative frame, the very rhetorical device that often allows us to find senseeven in a series of unique speeches.(3) Furthermore, the incantations have a cosmic setting, thus differing frommost other witchcraft texts. Moreover, this cosmic setting itself contains elementsthat are unique: a cosmic heaven–netherworld frame that encircles a singular point,“Zabban” (I 42ff.). III. Witches: Their Natures and TreatmentsA. IntroductionThere are difficulties in lines 37–41 (as well as in the following incantations) ofboth a general and specific nature. It is difficult to know, for example, the meaningof the oath mentioned in line 38 as well as the nature of the judgment. Moreover,why are the netherworld and netherworld deities mentioned in lines 37–38, 53,and 60, and what is the meaning of the netherworld connection? Furthermore, theidentity of the second person addressees in lines 37–41 is unclear, as is the natureboth of their activities and of the activities undertaken against them.But the single most perplexing and almost intractable difficulty is that of defin-ing the nature of the witch in this section of Maqlû. Are we to understand theadversary as a live human being or a dead infernal creature? Our problem is com-pounded by the fact that both human as well as supernatural forms of the witch arefound in Maqlû.12 Thus, we are left to wonder whether the witches in I 37ff. arehuman, spectral, or perhaps even demonic.And there is also the related question of the treatment to which these enemiesare to be subjected. Certainly, one of the purposes of Maqlû is to get rid of or expelthe witch. But how is this done, and whither is she sent? If the witch is a live human11. Contra previous readings.12. Elsewhere we have observed that in Maqlû witches sometimes take the form of live humanenemies, but at other times appear in demonic, even cosmic (i.e., meteorological and astral) form.

Having done so, we will take up the nature ofthe witch in the introduction to Maqlû, and then the treatment of the witch inMaqlû itself.In cases involving the ritual killing of the witch, we can document two majortypes of execution or treatment: in the one, she is killed, her body destroyed, andshe is thus kept out of the netherworld; in the other, she is killed, buried, and con-signed to the netherworld. The consignment of the witch to the netherworld is de-rivative; it came about, in large measure, when the functions of the exorcist wereexpanded to include anti-witchcraft responsibilities that were originally outside ofhis sphere, or (assuming that anti-witchcraft activities were originally part of hissphere) when the exorcist’s anti-witchcraft rituals were assimilated to his other func-tions.14 More original, however, is the treatment reflected in a Sumerian incantationknown already from the Old Babylonian period and attested in both unilingual andbilingual versions.15 There the speaker asks that Gilgamesh not integrate the witchinto the netherworld, that Nergal, lord of the netherworld, not reckon her ghostto those of the ghosts of the dead, and that Ningiszida deny her water.16 Thus, in13. It is well known that in Mesopotamia burial of the body is generally a requirement for futureexistence in the netherworld. For a recent discussion, see Abusch, “Etemmu,” in Dictionary of Deitiesand Demons in the Bible (DDD), ed. K. van der Toorn et al. (Leiden, 1995), 588–94, and “Ghost andGod: Some Observations on a Babylonian Understanding of Human Nature,” in Self, Soul and Bodyin Religious Experience, ed. A. I. Baumgarten et al. (Numen Supplement Series 78; Leiden, 1998),372–78.14. With their incorporation and/or assimilation, the witchcraft materials are reshaped by and as-similated to the exorcist’s standard treatments of and attitudes toward demons, ghosts, and other non-human supernatural powers. For a detailed treatment of this topic, see my “Considerations WhenKilling a Witch: Developments in Exorcistic Attitudes to Witchcraft,” in Dynamics of Ritual Change(Heidelberg [in press]).15. This incantation was first edited by A. Falkenstein, “Sumerische Beschwörungen aus Bogaz-köy,” ZA 45 (1939): 8–41 (the incantation is edited there on pp. 12–15). It has been reedited, withthe addition of new material, first by C. Wilcke, “Sumerische literarische Texte,” AfO 24 (1973): 10–13, and more recently by M. J.

(Occasion Publications of the Samuel NoahKramer Fund 2; Philadelphia, 1989), 193–205.16. Lines 27–49u of the incantation read:. . . so that the magic which he [scil. the patient] has in (his) body may flow away like water, so that (the magic) in his body (var. the spell in her possession) may evaporate like sweat,(when) the winds have wafted it away.As for her sorcery, magic, and the evil praxis:when Gilgamesh will have broken that spell and bonds,and once he has buried (it), she cannot approach (the victim’s) body.The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch8approaching the witches of our incantations, we should remember that, originally,Mesopotamian witches were usually not consigned to the netherworld for purposesof punishment, riddance, or expulsion; rather, they were excluded from it. In light of the two forms of treatment that we have just noted, we may re-formulate the two sets of questions regarding the nature and treatment of witchesnoted above and ask whether the witch in this section and recension of Maqlû is(1) a human witch who is killed and sent to the netherworld, (2) a human witchwho is killed but kept out of the netherworld, (3) a ghost or dead witch who is sentback to the netherworld, or (4) a dead witch—perhaps a ghost of a witch—whohas reappeared among the living and must not be allowed back into the nether-world.17 The very recognition and formulation of these questions constitute an advancein understanding. But my own extended attempts to choose one of these alterna-tives and to comprehend the text in terms of only one image have taught me thatit is insufficient or at least unproductive to so limit the choice, that it is incorrect toformulate the problem in terms of a single image.B. Nature of the AddresseesLet us now take up the question of the nature of the witches in more detail.The second incantation (lines 37–41) reads:erßetu erßetu erßetummadGilgames bel mamitikunu17. Another possibility, which I leave out of the discussion, is that the addressee is simply a de-mon or ghost sent by the witch. I have looked into this possibility, but it has not proved fruitful.As for her expertise, magic, and evil praxis:may she gnaw at her own fingers like cheese,may she always pronounce her words like pitch,and may (her) womb drip beer like a fermenting vat.May Utu, judge of heaven and earth, decide a bitter [fate] for her.May Nergal, lord of the Netherworld, not reckon her dead spirit as a proper ghost.May Ningiszida, throne-bearer of the Netherworld,cut off the cold water (offering) to her dead spirit.. . . . . . . . . . gap . . . . . . . . . . .May Gilgamesh(?) break her spell.May a cage cover her spell and hex like young animals, and even the corpse of this witch.Like heavenly lights may (the victim’s) heart not weaken,and may her own sorceries plague the witch like a baby scorpion.May they dig into her white flesh as (with) a stake,and may (the witch’s) own sorcery prey upon her.May she bite her breasts in her (folded) forearms,and may she gnaw at her own fingers like cheese . . .The translation of lines 27–49u is that of Geller, “A New Piece of Witchcraft,” 199–200; for the text,see Wilcke’s edition, lines 26–39 // Geller’s edition, lines 27–40, and Geller’s edition, lines 41uff."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I9mimmû attunu tepusa anaku idemimmû anaku eppusu attunu ul tidâmimmû kassapatiya ippusa egâ pa†ira pasira la isâ Netherworld, netherworld, yea netherworld,Gilgamesh is the enforcer of your (pl.) oath.Whatever you (pl.) have done, I know,Whatever I do, you (pl.) do not know,Whatever my witches do, there will be no one to overlook, undo, release.To the best of my understanding, the addressees, referred to in the second-personplural, are either a group of witches or, perhaps, a larger group of which the witchesform a part. The witches occur here in conjunction with netherworld features and figures.Since in the opening incantation of Maqlû, the focus seems to have been on theconflict between the speaker and live human witches, we might suppose that thewitches in the immediately following second unit I 37–60 (= 37–41, 42–49, 50–60) would also be human beings who are to be killed and sent to the netherworld.Indeed, since Maqlû was performed at the end of Abu, when the spirits of the deadand accompanying netherworld gods appeared on earth, a suitable opportunity forjudging the witch and dispatching her to the netherworld was at hand, for thenetherworld gods would then have been available to judge the live witch and totake or send her to the netherworld together with the returning spirits.18However, I am now skeptical of this explanation because of the informationthat we have regarding both the identity of the witch and the treatment accordedher. The existence and primacy of the method of execution whereby the witch iskept out of the netherworld raise doubts, and these doubts are strongly supportedby the evidence presented below regarding the identity of the witch.In the first incantation (I 1–36), the witches seem to be human, but I proposethat in the second (I 37–41), they are spectral. While Maqlû certainly enjoined thekilling of live witches, the ceremonial and cosmic setting suggest that the conflictalso functioned on another level and is also directed against supernatural enemies.We note that there are textual features in the second incantation that suggest that18. In “Nature of Maqlû,” 260, I noted that the “ultimate purpose” of the first division of Maqlû(Tablets I-V) “is the transformation of the witch into a ghost and the expulsion of that ghost from theworld of the living and its banishment to the world of the dead.” (I do not now remember if by“world of the dead” I meant netherworld, steppe [see IX 95, see below, n. 22], or some conflationof the two.) I would now modify this opinion, at least as regards Maqlû, for I have come to believethat the purpose of Maqlû is to destroy the witch utterly and make sure that the witch does not finda place in the netherworld. But, of course, as I noted in “Considerations,” some texts do have as theirpurpose the banishment of the witch (or, rather, her ghost) to the netherworld. In addition to thetexts cited there, see e.g., LKA 144 (and duplicates), edited by W. Farber, Beschwörungsrituale an Istarund Dumuzi (Wiesbaden, 1977), 218–59, and BBR, no. 52.The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch10the addressees are not live witches, but rather ghosts. In lines 38–40 of our incan-tation the “witch” is addressed not in the usual feminine singular, but rather in themasculine plural: mamitikunu “your (m. pl.) oath” (38)attunu “you” (m. pl.) (39)attunu “you” (m. pl.) (40)When placed alongside the invocation in lines 37–38 of the netherworld (erßetu),the “oath” itself (mamitu), and Gilgamesh its enforcer, this masculine plural suggeststhat the speaker here addresses the witches not as human females but rather as, oras part of, a group of “male” ghosts, and that this address is part of an exorcistic ad-juration. The witches have merged into a group of undifferentiated dead, a collec-tive in which they lack individuality.19 In support of this conclusion, I note that the witches are similarly addressed inthe second masculine plural form in the last incantation in Tablet V.20 That incan-tation marks the end of the first division of Maqlû and of the original Maqlû cere-mony. At that point, the witches had certainly already been killed and are treatedas ghosts or spirits21 that are to be exorcised and adjured to remain apart (in accor-dance with their expulsion into the steppe,22 outside the community).19. Cf. J. N. Bremmer, “The Soul, Death and the Afterlife in Early and Classical Greece,” inHidden Futures: Death and Immortality in Ancient Egypt, Anatolia, the Classical, Biblical and Arabic-IslamicWorld, ed. J. M. Bremer et al. (Amsterdam, 1994), 101:Yet, these speaking persons are exceptions to the rule, and when the early Greeks spoke ofsouls of the dead they referred to them as “the wasted ones”, “the outworn ones”, or “thefeeble heads of the dead”. Important here, it seems to me, is the plural. The dead are clearlyconsidered to be an enormous, undifferentiated group. . . . This idea of the dead, then, asan anonymous, countless group perfectly fits the early Greek concept of death as an un-avoidable, natural process.20. Maqlû V 166–184 read:Be off, be off, begone, begone,Depart, depart, flee, flee!Go off, go away, be off, and begone!. . . . . . .By the oath of Shamash, the honorable, be adjured (tamâtunu),By the oath of Ea, lord of the deep, be adjured (tamâtunu),By the oath of Asalluhi, magus of the gods, be adjured (tamâtunu),By the oath of Girra, your executioner, be adjured (tamâtunu),From my body you shall indeed be separated!21. See my “Early Form,” 22–24. Perhaps these spirits were never human; originally, this incan-tation seems to have been directed against demons or ghosts (see “Demonic Image,” 45, and “EarlyForm,” 52, 53, n. 98, and 54). 22. The incantation recited by the exorcist immediately following V 166–84 adjures the spiritsto go off to the steppe: “Thereafter, you (the priest) recite the incantation ‘Evil demon, to yoursteppe’ all the way to the outer entrance” (IX 95)."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I11Especially in view of the mention of mamitu in I 38, we notice the several oc-currences of tamâtunu, a form of tamû, in lines 180–83 of the last incantation ofTablet V. And in further support of seeing the addressee in I 37ff. as a ghost who isexpelled, I note that in many texts spirits of the dead are similarly addressed whenthey are adjured to separate and not return. So, for example, “By the oath of thenetherworld may you be adjured; by the oath of heaven may you be adjured” ([niserßeti lu tamâta] nis sam[ê] lu tamâta (BAM 323 [= KAR 184]: 37). Similarly, in BAM323 (= KAR 184): 79–88 // K 4508 + 6648,23 we read:If the ghost of a man’s father or mother keeps seizing him on the twenty-seventhof Abu, . . . On the third day, the twenty-ninth, when the ghosts are providedwith food offerings, you . . . say: “From the body of NN, son of NN, be 3600double-hours distant; be far away, be distant, be distant. By the oath of the greatgods, you are adjured” (tummâtunu).24At the beginning of Maqlû (I 37ff.), then, the witches are treated like the deadand are addressed in terms drawn from rituals of expulsion of ghosts and demons.This non-corporeal form agrees with and is perhaps supported by the occurrenceelsewhere in Maqlû of a demonic image of the witch.The non-human quality of the addressee (= the witch) and the speaker’s claimto extraordinary cognitive powers in I 37–41 recall such other incantations as VI120–27, 128–35, 136–44, 145–51. In these incantations, the witch is said to par-take of the qualities of wind or fire that send witchcraft in the form of clouds,smoke, dreams.25 The connection between I 37–41 and the aforementioned in-cantations from Tablet VI is made even more explicit by the emphasis upon thespeaker’s cognitive powers in I 39–40 of our incantation (mimmû attunu tepusaanaku ide / mimmû anaku eppusu attunu ul tidâ), for also in these other incantions wefind a similar claim to superior knowledge: as in the assertion anaku ide of I 39, soin each of these other incantations, the speaker asserts anaku idima attakal takalu (VI123 // 131 // 139 //148), thus claiming knowledge and setting up a protection. Hethereby claims to recognize such phenomena as wind, smoke, and dreams as formsof the witch and witchcraft and asserts that the witches cannot disguise themselves23. For this ritual, cf. Abusch, “Nature of Maqlû,” 257, n. 15; and Farber, Beschwörungsrituale,207–17 and pl. 18.24.

Their identity and demonic character are recognizable evenwhen they are disguised.26 Accordingly, the incantation Maqlû I 37–41 should be read in connection withother addresses to “normal” ghosts who had been given over to the netherworldand were under the control of the netherworld and of Gilgamesh. The addresseesin our second incantation seem to include ghosts of witches who had already diedprior to the onset of the ritual and who are for that reason addressed as specters.But, although the second, third, and fourth incantations in Maqlû exhibit nether-world affinities, we ought not assume that the witches there are being consigned tothat realm. For, as noted above, the normal course is not to relegate the destroyedwitch to the netherworld; indeed, more typically she is kept from entering it. Thus,in principle, even if the witch in our incantations appears in the form of a shade,such a being, also, might suffer exclusion from the netherworld, an exclusion thatconveys the sense of complete destruction. This is also what the evidence of thetext suggests.But before turning to that evidence, let us conclude our discussion of the na-ture of the witch with the observation that the witches in Maqlû should be re-garded as both alive and dead. Sometimes the witch is alive, as in the firstincantation in Tablet I; at other times, she is the ghost of a dead witch, as in thenext three incantations. The text’s approach to the witches as comprising twogroups—those who are dead and those who are alive—should not surprise us,since such a dichotomy agrees with and perhaps even continues basic ideas and linesof division in the very material from which Maqlû was formed. For, as noted else-where,27 the original Maqlû ceremony was created by the joining together of twosets of materials, each with its own image of evil—the one a human witch, theother a ghostly and/or demonic force that was (or could be identified with) a deadwitch or, rather, the ghost of a dead witch. Thus, given the nature of the materialsthat went into the formation of Maqlû, the existence of both live and dead witchesin the final version of the text may represent the very sort of development that wewould have expected; that original material may even lend support to our findingthat Maqlû combats both live and dead witches. We return to this theme in an Ex-cursus (pp. 33–34).C. TreatmentIn Maqlû are to be found several different ways of killing and disposing of thewitch. All of the methods are intended to ensure that the witch does not find aplace in the netherworld. As we shall see, the existence of these different forms oftreatment agrees with and supports our claim that Maqlû is directed against bothlive and dead witches.26. Similarly, our speaker in I 37–41 may be addressing infernal witches and asserting his abilityto recognize them even when they assume the form of dreams, clouds, or smoke, or even of wind orfire itself.

Among other treatments, the text of Maqlû pre-scribes that the witch is to be burned or fed to animals.Burning.Particularly in the first part of Maqlû (see especially I 73–IV 95) em-phasis is placed upon and importance accorded to burning the witch and destroyingher body.28 According to one Mesopotamian belief, burning the body makes it im-possible to give the dead person proper burial rites, with the consequence that itsghost cannot go to the netherworld. Thus, for example, in Gilgamesh, Enkidu, andthe Netherworld, Enkidu responds to Gilgamesh’s question, “Did you see him whowas set on fire?” with the answer, “I did not see him. His smoke went up to thesky and his ghost does not live in the netherworld.”29 Similarly, in Maqlû, the burn-ing witches are enjoined: hula zuba u itattukaquturkunu litelli samêlaªmikunu liballi dsamsiliprus hayyattakunu mar dEa masmasuDissolve, melt, drip ever away!May your smoke rise ever heavenward,May the sun extinguish your embers,May the son of Ea (Asalluhi), the exorcist, cut off your emanations.I 140–143 // V 152–15530Thus, the witches’ ghosts do not enter the netherworld; rather, their beings rise upas smoke into the sky and are there scattered. Note, by contrast, that in rituals in-tended to return troublesome ghosts to the netherworld, their representations arevirtually never burned.31 Hence, burning is intended to destroy the body and toprevent the witch from finding a place in the netherworld. 28. For a discussion of burning, see also my “Ghost and God,” 375–77, and “ConsiderationsWhen Killing a Witch,” §I “Transformation of the Old.”29. A.

Lang, Heaven: A History (New York, 1990 [PB Vintage Books]; originally published New Ha-ven, 1988), 49:The same ardent belief in bodily resurrection formed the center of the Christian Creed asprofessed by the Martyrs of Lyons. This was well understood by their persecutors, whoburnt their victim’s mutilated bodies “in order that they may not even hope of a resurrec-tion.” After having thrown the ashes into the Rhone river, the persecutors remarked, “Nowlet us see if they will rise again, and if their god can help them.” 30.

Moreover, burning in Maqlû seems to be the mode ofexecution meted out to a live witch.

I felled with the sword 800 of their combattroops, I burnt 3000 captives from them. I did not leave one of them alive as a hos-tage. . . .

The penultimate incantation and ritual in Maqlû (VIII 81–89 //IX 183–87) describe how the witch is fed to eagles, vultures (zibu),33 and dogs.34In ritual actuality, images made of dough embedded in bread are fed to dogs.

For our purposes, moreover, it is particularly significant that this punish-ment is prescribed at the very end of Maqlû, immediately prior to the concludingapotropaic incantation (atta ßilli atta basti, “You are my protection, you are my vi-tality” [VIII 90ff. // IX 180ff.]). Since there is no ceremonial time left at this pointfor burial, this final position in Maqlû proves that the injunction to feed the witch’sbody to animals is to be taken literally as the final destructive act of the ceremony.Here, too, then, the witch is not buried and is not given a place in the netherworld.As with the burning ritual, the feeding ritual parallels and perhaps reflects prac-tices known from Neo-Assyrian inscriptions.36 Similar treatment is meted out bythe Neo-Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal to especially detested ene-mies. For example:The corpses of his warriors I did not bury but fed to vultures. (Esarhaddon)37As for the remaining men, while they were still alive . . . as his funerary offering(scil.

In both cases,the corpse is destroyed and the witch is deprived of the possibility of ever beingburied. Disinterment.But there is yet another form of punishment that seems to haveescaped notice. A witch may also be disinterred and in this way deprived of a graveand a resting place in the netherworld. Maqlû II 118–22 provides evidence of thisform of treatment. This is surely a reasonable interpretation of what is otherwise anenigmatic passage. In Meier’s edition, the aforementioned lines are read and trans-lated as follows:dannu makkursunu sulqi [su-b]il44 busasunu ekkemaeli manahatisunu habbata surbißgirra ezzu gitmalu rasubbuina ekur asar tallaktika tusapsahsunuti adi surrisEinen Gewalttäter lass ihren Besitz wegnehmen![Lass rau]ben ihr Eigentum einen Räuber!Gegen ihre Wohnungen lass einen Plünderer sich lagern!Wütender Gira, Vollkommener, Gewaltiger:In Ekur, wo du einhergehst, beruhige sie eilends!45Lines 118–22 are part of an incantation addressed to Girra (II 104–24). In this in-cantation, Girra is called upon to judge in the stead of Sin and Shamash (106–7)and to destroy the witches by fire (108ff.). In lines 118–20, Girra is then asked tocause thieves to take away the witches’ furnishings and resting place. Meier’s inter-pretation of line 122 is questionable. It surely makes no sense to ask Girra to set thewitches at rest immediately after having asked him to take away their resting place.In fact, line 122 has been misread; K 2713 + K 5658 + K 14208 + 83–1–18, 435+ 83–1–18, 496 (Sm 695 belongs to the same tablet) has: e tu-sap-sih-su-nu-t[i].46Meier thus omitted one sign, the negation.

The use of the verb pasahu in this context certainly supports our interpreta-tion, for pasahu is used to describe the rest of the dead in their burial place.48 ButI think that we need to venture a bit further. While translations usually treat thepossessions and thieves mentioned in lines 118–20 as this-worldly,49 I think thatthese lines should be construed as referring to grave furnishings (makkuru, busû) andeven to the resting place, the tomb (ma-na-ha-te/[t]i?-sú/[s]u-nu50), and to the grave-robbers who plunder the grave and undo the burial. Thus the witch’s grave is to beplundered and her remains unearthed and burned. This witch is thereby deprivedof a resting place in the netherworld. In the context of Maqlû, then, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the witchwhose grave is plundered and who is deprived of a resting place in the netherworldmust have already been dead and buried; the remains, the bones, of this dead witchwere unearthed and destroyed by fire. Leaving corpses of the dead unburied and even destroying them is known fromAssyrian sources.51 Assurbanipal treats the grandson of Marduk-Baladan in thisway; he does not allow his burial and even desecrates his body:Seine Leiche gab ich nicht zur Beerdigung frei, ich machte ihn noch toter als zu-vor. Seinen Kopf schlug ich ab und hängte ihn an den Nacken des Nabûqatißabat,47. Ekur is both a prison and a designation for the netherworld; see. S. M.

In fact, they are notunlike what Assurbanipal himself sometimes did, especially in his Elamite cam-paigns: as in our Maqlû passage, enemy corpses were sometimes disinterred, that is,skeletons were removed from tombs and destroyed. For example, the dead Elamitekings who had once rebelled against Assyria are treated in this fashion:Die Grabstätten ihrer früheren (und) späteren Könige, welche Istar, meine Herrin(var.: Assur und Istar, meine Herren), nicht fürchteten und die Könige, meineVäter, beunruhigten, verwüstete und zerstörte ich, zeigte sie dem (Sonnengott)Samas.

None of the forms of execution central to Maqlû involves sending the witchto the netherworld;56 rather, in Maqlû, burial is withheld from the witch. The treat-ment of the witch is patterned on the treatment of those humans who were deprivedof burial: they were either left unburied or, if already buried, they were disinterred. The different treatments or punishments that we have noted in Maqlû are con-gruent with the existence of different classes of witches. It is reasonable to supposethat the witch who was to be executed and burned and/or fed to animals was aliveor had just been killed, while the witch who was to be disinterred had already beendead for some time.57IV. Calendrical SettingThe destruction of the witch, sometimes as a being who is to be killed and de-stroyed immediately at death and sometimes as one who must be attacked afterdeath, certainly supports the observation that the image of the witch in Maqlûseems to be sometimes that of a living person and sometimes that of a ghost or evena demon. But how are we to explain this concern with both live and dead witches?It seems to me that Maqlû’s approach to and treatment of the witch fits wellwith, and is explained by, the calendrical setting of the Maqlû ritual: Maqlû wasperformed at a festival at the end of the month of Abu, a time of year when ghostsreturn from the netherworld.58 At that time, the living and the dead interact, and56. One further manner of destruction that has not been taken up here is that of drowning (cf.,e.g., III 118–39); occasionally, the witch seems to be sent thereby to the Apsû (e.g., VIII 33ff. // IX174, which prescribes washing over a representation of the witch. Generally, washing is a symbol ofcleansing and transference, but here it also represents the dousing and drowning of the witch).57. Thus, the corpse of the witch who is executed for performing witchcraft is destroyed andnothing is left for burial. The remains of a witch who had died naturally and had been buried are dis-interred and destroyed, and the witch deprived of a permanent place and existence.It is true that not providing burial might subject the living to the attacks of unfettered ghosts,and one might object, therefore, that the contention that the witches were denied burial cannot becorrect. But the danger to which society would thereby be exposed is no greater than that occasionedby expelling criminals rather than imprisoning them. And in any case, there are periods and/or situ-ations where the deprivation of burial serves a political, social, and/or psychological need that is so im-portant as to outweigh other considerations. The fact is that the Assyrians often did not bury theirenemies. On the relationship of the deprivation of burial to the fear of the unburied dead, cf. West-enholz, “berutum,” 30–31; note Westenholz’s concluding remark on p. 31: “. . . or alternatively, thatthere was a shift in emphasis in the Old Babylonian period, in which the dread on the part of thewould-be criminal of remaining unburied became stronger than the fear of the spirits of the unburieddead on part of the society.”58. See my “Nature of Maqlû,” 259–61. There (p. 261) I noted the netherworld character ofAbu, observed that the performance of Maqlû in Abu would be partially explained by “the cultic-calendrical association of Abu with Gilgames in his netherworld capacity and with the appearance ofghosts and their return to the netherworld,” and in n. 34 I collected passages referring to these phe-nomena. Note that contrary to the impression that might be received from Scurlock, Magical Means,The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch20there can be judgments in this world by netherworld deities who have power overthe dead. The contact of the living and the dead renders this both a dangerous andan opportune time. It is dangerous because of the blurring of boundaries and thegreater ease for the infernal to seize the living and for the living to go down to thenetherworld in an untimely manner. It is an opportune time because it provides anoccasion to enlist the aid of gods of the dead as well as of deceased members ofone’s family for the purpose of disposing of human, demonic, or ghostly threats. Itis a time like Halloween, “when barriers between the human and supernaturalworlds were broken. Otherworld entities, such as the souls of the dead, were ableto visit earthly inhabitants, and humans could take the opportunity to penetrate thedomains of the gods and supernatural creatures.”59More than any other hypothesis, this netherworld character explains the infer-nal qualities of the witch not only by the end of the Maqlû ceremony, but alreadyin I 37–41, the second incantation of the work, and, therefore, in effect, at the be-ginning of the work. This netherworld association explains, moreover, both thethreefold invocation in I 37 of erßetu, “netherworld,”60 as well as the call on godsof the netherworld in the second and fourth incantations, so very close to the be-ginning of the ceremony. In line 38, Gilgamesh is the administrator of the oathbecause he is a netherworld god, an official who returns with the dead and func-tions as a judge during the festival of the dead in Abu.61 Similarly, it is because of59.

The speakerthere turns to Belet-ßeri, the scribe and keeper of the records of the netherworld,because her approval is necessary for entrance into the infernal realm. She guards,at least figuratively, the entrance to the netherworld. She is the guardian, moreover,of those who are in limbo and await determination of whether they are to enter/reenter the netherworld.62 It is appropriate that the witch be confronted and judged at this time, for oneof the purposes of Maqlû is to prevent witches from having proper burials. Somewitches are imagined as being alive. The festival is a good and effective time tojudge and execute live witches. And it is an especially fitting and appropriate timeto judge dead witches. For the witches who had died natural deaths are imaginedto have taken the form of ghosts, like all the other dead. At the annual reappearanceof ghosts, the manes of these dead witches come back together with the otherdead. Now the dead witch who had escaped judgment in her lifetime may finallybe judged.63 And while the other dead will return to the netherworld at the endof the festival, the dead witches must not be permitted to return; they must be keptpermanently out of the netherworld. Thus, the dead witches and whatever agentsthey may send—ghost, demons, dreams—are to be distanced and destroyed.64The purpose of the ceremony, then, is to judge and destroy live witches and tocapture and destroy the ghosts of dead witches. In this construction, all witches aredeprived of burial, for they must be kept from being integrated or reintegrated intothe netherworld; they are thereby denied a place in the cosmic state. For the nether-world and the heavens form a connected structure—perhaps even a continuum—and to be part of the netherworld is to be able to ascend to the earth and affect theupper world.65Witches must be expelled and kept outside the organized social and cosmiccommunity. Hence, the destruction of the witch’s corpse by burning or feeding toanimals, on the one hand, and the removal of her bones from the grave, on theother. In these ways, the witches’ remains are totally transformed and disintegrated.Such utter destruction insures that the witch will never be able either to enter or toreturn to the netherworld and thereby to join the broader social community of theorganized universe.62. For Belet-ßeri, see “Socio-Religious Framework, Part II,” 475–76, n. 20.63. Moreover, at this time of year, the dead witch must be neutralized because she straddles theline between the living and the dead and threatens the social and cosmic order.64. For a further discussion of the spectral witch, see “Ascent to the Stars,” 26–29, and notesthere, pp. 35–37.65. Ghosts and demons travel back and forth between the netherworld and the upper world (seemy comment in “Socio-Religious Framework, Part II,” 475, n. 19). Also, the ghosts of dead witchesmay return to this world, especially, but not only, at the time of the festival at the end of Abu. Thedead witches must now be kept from returning to the netherworld, for otherwise they will again beable to threaten harm.the Anunnaki, and the ghosts of the patient’s family, he is called upon to take action against witches.Cf. ibid., 261, n. 36.The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch22V. Legal Context66Oath and Compact.What is the justification for the destruction of witches andtheir permanent exclusion from the human and cosmic community? To be sure,both live and dead witches need to be eliminated so as to prevent them from harm-ing living members of the community; thus, also the shades of dead witches mustbe prevented from threatening the living when they rise up together with the otherdead. Moreover, living and dead witches must not be allowed, respectively, to enteror reenter the netherworld, for they would then be able to threaten and harm hu-man beings when in subsequent years they reappear on earth. But these, I think, are not the primary, and certainly not the only, reasons fortheir treatment. Simple separation from and protection for the living are not suffi-cient explanations for the imagery used in the work and for the extreme treatmentmeted out to the witch.67 Rather, we must examine the controlling legal metaphorof the work for a fuller explanation and justification of the basis for the indictmentand for the kinds of punishments that we have identified. Already in the opening incantations of Maqlû there are indications that theceremony operates in a special juridical context. The introductory section centers66. A much-abbreviated discussion of the legal context has been incorporated into the introduc-tory section of “Socio-Religious Framework, Part II,” so as to provide the necessary background forthe textual explication there presented.67. One may wonder whether this kind of treatment of the witch might not be an extension, ora particular application, of the concept noticed by B. Alster, “Incantation to Utu,” ASJ 13 (1991): 27–96, esp. 27–32, and “Corrections and Additions to Incantation to Utu,” ASJ 14 (1992): 425, ad lines146–47. On the basis of that text, Alster proposes that all dead were judged prior to their integrationinto the netherworld; that this judgment may have taken place only on an annual basis and that thosewho had died between festivals and were therefore not judged at the time of their death were judgedat the annual festival that occurred subsequent to their death; and that dead men who were felt tohave grievously sinned against their sons (or who, at least, were perceived as having done so by theirliving heirs), as well as those others to whom great evil was imputed, were kept out of the nether-world and thus excluded from the cult of the dead (in this context, Alster, “Incantations to UTU,”36, n. 4, cites the Sumerian incantation quoted above in §III.A). M. J. Geller, “Very Different UtuIncantations,” ASJ 17 (1995): 102–9, has objected to Alster’s construction. Although Geller’s argu-ment is provocative, I do not accept his premise that incantations are only intended to help living vic-tims. While I am not certain about some of the details of the text, I find that in the main I still preferAlster’s interpretation.Alster and I seem to have come to some of the same conclusions independently. Alster’s inter-pretation of the Utu text agrees with the inferences drawn above in §III.A from the Sumerian incan-tation quoted there as well as from other texts, and with the ideas developed in this paper about thedestruction of the corpse so that the “evil” dead not enter the netherworld, and about the disinter-ment of those who had managed to be buried although they did not “deserve” to enter the nether-world. The aforementioned Utu text provides further support for the idea that exclusion from thenetherworld may be the standard punishment in Mesopotamia not only of witches but, as expected,of other criminals as well. Alster’s conclusions also agree with my idea that the witches were judgedduring an annual festival of the dead in Abu.Subhead dropspread is 6 points short"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I23on the indictment of the witch in anticipation of her subsequent judgment andpunishment. While judgment and punishment are not uncommon in witchcraftceremonies and even appear in the opening incantation (I 73ff.) of an earlier formof Maqlû, here in the new introductory section (I 1–72), the composer adds an in-dictment of the witch, an invocation of natural forces, and an allusion to a contrac-tual relationship, all themes that recall treaties and witnesses. The direction for a more specific answer within Maqlû is provided by theoccurrence in the second incantation (lines 37–41) of the term mamitu (line 38).This incantation invokes the “oath” mamitu and builds on and proceeds from thisadjuration. From its position and emphasis, it is clear that mamitu here bears partic-ular significance. The speaker invokes the netherworld and then declares that thewitches are under an oath enforced by Gilgamesh; hence, it is an oath sanctionedby the netherworld (i.e., mamit erßeti). In the preceding incantation (I 1–36), thespeaker had implicitly invoked an oath sanctioned by the gods of the heavens whenhe called upon the gods of the night sky, accused the witches of having performedevil witchcraft against him, and received a favorable hearing from these gods. Theoath by the netherworld is thus perhaps part of the standard pattern of adjurationby the pair heaven and netherworld: zi.an.na hé.pàd zi.ki.a hé.pàd: nissamê lu tamâta nis erßeti lu tamâta “Be you adjured by heaven, be you adjured byearth.” In any case, in the second and fourth incantations, the mamitu is placed ex-plicitly under the sanction and execution of netherworld authorities, Gilgameshand Belet-ßeri. The use of the term mamitu in line 38 of our second incantation, as well as thevariety and totality of punishments later in the series, suggest the operation here ofa social/ideological framework different from that of the normal anti-witchcraftceremony.68 What exactly does mamitu here signify? It is not sufficient to see themamitu simply as an oath supporting or demanding exorcism and separation, as isadmittedly often the case in magical rituals where the invoked demons or ghosts arerequired to take leave from the human victim and not return.69 Nor is it sufficientto see it simply as an oath that enforces a line beyond which the witches and theiremissaries cannot go, a barrier set up so that evil forces not be able to make contact68. The primary (though not exclusive) purpose of the latter was to rid the victim of witchcraftand to kill the witch. 69. See, e.g., LKA 84, rev. 3–6:You shall not come near my [bo]dy again. You are expelled (and) dr[iven out].(Samas), let him (the ghost) be adjured by your [o]ath, let him be adjured by the oath of Eaand Asalluhi,Let him be adjured by the oath of the great gods of heaven and the netherworldNot to approach my body again.Translation: Scurlock, Magical Means, vol. 2, 273, with minor modifications (of punctuation and thereplacement of “be put under” with “be adjured by” and “earth” with “netherworld”).

I propose thatit also designates a code of behavior and that it refers to the oath taken and thecurse or punishment threatened in support of a set of rules. This mamitu designatesan agreement or compact that governs relationships, a series of stipulations to whichall members of society, including the witches, have been bound by oath under thethreat of punishment. This agreement is authorized and guaranteed by the powersof the heavens and the netherworld. And by bringing down curses on those whobreak the oath, the mamitu is meant to deter its subjects from breaking the terms ofthe agreement—the rules of society—that allow the living to form a communityand the living and dead to be part of one cosmos. The mamitu in Maqlû is not unlike the mamitu, the oath and compact, betweenthe snake and the eagle in the myth of Etana. Note especially the similar mamiterßetim found there. The late version, in Kinnier Wilson’s translation, reads:(Then, one day) the eagle spoke [unto the serpent, (saying)]:“Come, let us [make] friends.“Let us become (hunting) partners, you and I!”[The serpe]nt opened his mouth and [spoke unto the eagle, (saying)]:“[Evil] is he who [breaks] a friendship in the [sight of Shamash].“By your evil you would [grieve his] spi[rit],“An abomination of the gods, [a forbidden thing would you have done].“Come, let us indemnify ourselves [ . . . ]“Let us swear an [oath] by the nether[world].”(So) before Shamash-quradu they swore an oath, (saying):“He who [transgresses] the boundary of Shamash,“May Shamash [deliver] him as evil into the hand of the Slaughterer.”He who [transgresses] the boundary of Shamash,“May [the mountainland] remove afar [its] entr[ance] from him.“May the ‘wandering Weapon’ make straight towards him,70. See, e.g., the incantation Sag.ba sag.ba, recently reedited by W. H. P. Römer, “Eine Be-schwörung gegen den ‘Bann’,” in Studies Sjöberg, 465–79.71. It does seem likely that the mamitu here reinforces an enclosure, for according to lines 50–51, the witches are enclosed and imprisoned in a transit area—the quay and ford. By being confinedin a holding area, the witches are kept from escaping and are made available for the upcoming trial.The transit area is here closed off so as to keep those who would enter the inhabited world confinedand unable to move forward into this world or back into the netherworld. The witches are thus keptboth from attacking humans and from escaping back into the netherworld.

Itprobably required obedience and loyalty to the divine, governmental, and socialauthorities and structures.74 But most of all, it prohibited behavior of an anti-social,seditious nature, behavior that may be construed as, or at least includes, the perfor-mance of witchcraft. All members of society are bound to abide by the rules of so-cial order; this obligation seems to underlie or be implicit in the frequent accusationin prayers and incantations that some individuals have committed evil or variousforms of witchcraft,75 a complaint that has on occasion been expanded to includethe charge that the witch has performed witchcraft (= evil) against the victim al-though he had not performed witchcraft against her.76 By disregarding the terms ofthe social compact through their hostile behavior, the witches have broken amamitu guaranteed by the heavens and the netherworld and are to be punished andexcluded from the organized community of humanity, a community that encom-passes the living and the dead.7772. See J. V. Kinnier Wilson, The Legend of Etana: A New Edition (Warminster, 1985). I have re-produced Kinnier Wilson’s translation (pp. 88–91), with the exception of his “(Nergal)” in line 18.For a similar translation, with minor differences, see B. F. Foster, Before the Muses: An Anthology ofAkkadian Literature (2d ed.; Bethesda, Md., 1996), vol. 1, 449–50. A somewhat different translationof these lines, with the replacement of “oath by the netherworld” by “oath on [the net of Sha-mash(?)]” in lines 15 and 23, is given by S. Dalley, Myths From Mesopotamia (Oxford, 1989), 191–92.I note that S. Langdon, The Legend of Etana and the Eagle (Paris, 1932), pl. I, and Kinnier Wilson,pls. 13–14, show a clear ki-t[ì]. Kinnier Wilson reads these lines as: ni-it-ma-a erßeti[m rabitim? ma-mitu](15), is-tu ma-mitu it-mu-ú erßeti[m rabitim?] (23). Cf. the Middle Assyrian Version, I/B, lines 6 and 9 asrestored and translated by Foster, 443: “The netherworld will h[old you fast]! . . . The netherworld[will hold you fast]!”73. In addition, I need hardly mention the many mamitus/acts listed, for example, in Surpu (andrelated texts) that relate to social behavior (e.g., Surpu II 20–68, III 24, 34).74. Of course, human society is implicitly based on a social compact. What we are saying is thata structure that is often implicit in Mesopotamian culture has here been made explicit, and that some-times formal ceremonies were performed in support of this understanding of society and of the obli-gations that it entailed.75. For example: assu ipusa lemneti isteªa la banâti “Because evil did she perform against me andharm has she sought against me . . .” (Maqlû I 18). There are many additional examples; see, simply,the examples cited in W.

Perhaps they are judges and render a verdict. But,in any case, they serve as an audience and prevent the witches from interferingwith the plaintiff’s presentation.80The Immutability of the Oath.Having been accused of breaking the social com-pact, the witches, for their part, would wish to cancel the mamitu: its oath, obliga-tions, and curses. It is to this that the speaker refers in line 41: mimmû kassapatiyaippusa egâ pa†ira pasira la isâ (var. ul irassi), “Whatever my witches do, there will beno one to overlook, undo, release.” One of the best supports for our constructionof the text comes from this line. This line has previously been misunderstood,81 inpart because it was misconstrued grammatically, but mainly because it was never readagainst the right backdrop or set into the appropriate context. The statement in line41 does not mean that the speaker will be unable to find someone to release thewitchcraft. Such a reading is contrary to what is normally said to a witch and wouldbe nonsense in an anti-witchcraft incantation, for there the victim of witchcraftnormally seeks the release of what the witch has done and expresses the belief thatthe effects of her magical acts can indeed be released. Rather, its context is that ofthe earlier invocations of the oath in the first incantation in Maqlû and in line 38 ofthe second incantation: knowing what the witches are doing (lines 39–40) and thatthey will try to render the oath inoperative (line 41), the speaker now assures thewitches that no matter what they do, they will not find anyone who will disregardor revoke the mamitu and absolve and free them from its oath, obligations, and curse.Accordingly, our construction of a compact explains and is confirmed by whatis otherwise an enigmatic line. Line 41 refers to the fact that the mamitu cannot benullified or canceled. It introduces (and also explains) the various speeches and actsof the speaker in the following incantations, where he becomes a messenger of theheavenly gods and travels to the entrance of the netherworld in order to persuadeBelet-ßeri to side with him, not with the witches, and to convince her to upholdthe ban and not let the witches into the netherworld.82Statements comparable to line 41, to the effect that a mamitu will be maintainedand not undone, are found in addresses to ghosts.83 But, even more significant is80. Cf. the discussion of the role and significance of the powers of nature in the biblical cove-nantal lawsuits (rîb) in, e.g., H. Huffmon, “The Covenant Lawsuit in the Prophets,” JBL 78 (1959):292–93, and G. E. Wright, “The Lawsuit of God: A Form-Critical Study of Deuteronomy 32,” inIsrael’s Prophetic Heritage, ed. B.

Note, moreover, thewitchcraft connection of that law. After stipulating that a man or woman who hadbeen proven guilty of performing witchcraft be killed, the law takes up the case ofan eyewitness who first reports that he had seen the commission of the act but thendenies it: A man who heard from an eyewitness to the witchcraft that he witnessed thepractice of the witchcraft, who said to him, “I myself saw it,” that hearsay-witnessshall go and inform the king. If the eyewitness should deny what he (i.e., thehearsay-witness) reports to the king, he (i.e., the hearsay-witness) shall declare be-fore the divine Bull-the-Son-of-the-Sun-God, “He surely told me”—and thus heis clear. As for the eyewitness who spoke (of witnessing the deed to his comrade)and then denied (it to the king), the king shall interrogate him as he sees fit, inorder to determine his intentions; an exorcist shall have the man make a declara-tion when they make a purification, and then he himself (i.e., the exorcist) shallsay as follows, “No one shall release any of you from the oath you swore by theking and by his son; you are bound by oath to the stipulations of the agreementto which you swore by the king and by his son.”86The eyewitness is required by a civil obligation sanctioned by some form of oathto give evidence of a crime that he witnessed. Here, too, the power constrainingthe citizen derives from a mamitu; here, too, this oath and obligation cannot be re-scinded (mamita sa ana sarre u marisu tamªatani la ipassarakkunu . . .). A similar stip-ulation is found in Leviticus 5:1.87The witches, as all members of society, are under the jurisdiction of the mamitu.Witchcraft and Neo-Assyrian Ideology.Throughout this essay, I have been citingparallels from Neo-Assyrian governmental texts that record the ideology and be-havior of that empire. This is neither an accident nor a coincidence, for what weare dealing with in Maqlû is not unlike the treaty forms, ideology, and procedures86. Translation: M. Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor (SBL Writings fromthe Ancient World Series 6; Atlanta, 1995), 172–73.87. Lev 5:1 reads:If a person does wrong: When he has heard a public imprecation (against withholdingtestimony)—and although he was a witness, either having seen or known (the facts)—yetdoes not testify, then he must bear his punishment.Translation: J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (Anchor Bible 3A; New York, 1991), 292.The adjuration or imprecation in Lev 5:1 is rooted in and draws its force from the obligation ofmembers of a community to abide by societal laws and norms. The obligation is sanctioned by thecommunity and its institutions. The obligation to fulfill one’s social responsibility may have been as-sumed by means of a formal ceremony; in biblical religion, the obligation is a consequence of Israel’shaving entered into a formal covenant. Cf. M. J. Geller, “The Surpu Incantations and Lev. V. 1–5,”JSS 25 (1980): 185–87, for a similar approach to communal obligations but a different approach tothe sin involved in Lev 5:1 (Geller takes wésaméºâ qôl ªalâ wéhûª ºed ªô raªâ ªô yadaº as referring to thecovenant ceremony itself rather than to the crime being published by the announcement.)The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch30of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.88 There, too, the members of society entered a cov-enant and assumed obligations.89 There, too, the individual who had broken thepolitical or social agreement had to be punished regardless of whether he was stillalive or had already died. The crime is absolute and the punishment, too, is abso-lute; punishment must always be meted out, for all treaty crimes must be punished(at least in theory). Hence, the execution and corporeal destruction of treaty trans-gressors and the disinterment and destruction of those transgressors who had seem-ingly escaped by dying prior to capture; thus, the bodies of the living and deadwere destroyed.90As an example of the treatment of dead vassals, let us recall the passage fromAssurbanipal’s Prisms (B vi 93ff. // C vii 111ff.), quoted earlier, that dealt with thegrinding up of the bones of Nabûsumeres, the governor of Nippur. He was one ofthose who had rebelled against Assurbanipal and had supported Urtaka’s originalrebellion. Earlier in the prisms, we are told that he died subsequent to that rebellionand was therefore not immediately punished (“Nabûsumeres, der Gouverneur [scil.von Nippur], der den Vertrag nicht wahrte, zog sich Hydropsie, (d.h) Wassersuchtzu”91). But he still required punishment because he had broken his oath, as the text88. There is a large literature on the treaties. In addition to the items mentioned in earlier notes(Parpola/Watanabe, Neo-Assyrian Treaties; Watanabe, Die adê-Vereidigung; and Parpola, “Neo-AssyrianTreaties,” 161–189, esp. 161, n. 3), see, e.g., M.

See, e. g., Parpola/Watanabe, Neo-AssyrianTreaties, xxiv: “The Assyrian solution to the problem was to set up a mechanism geared to detect andnip all treacherous activities in the bud: pacts of loyalty obliging every Assyrian subject to accept andprotect the sovereignty of the ruling king (or his heir apparent) and to immediately report any activitiesundermining this sovereignty to the king.” Cf. also H.

Had he been captured alive, he would have been killedand his body mistreated and left unburied. Having been buried, his remains had tobe disinterred so that he could be punished and destroyed. Hence, after a latercampaign his bones were exhumed and taken to Nineveh where his sons wereforced to grind them up.Like the Assyrian vassals, the witches in Maqlû are under an obligation. Thewitches addressed in Maqlû have broken the rules and have not abided by the socialcontract, a contract that applies to the whole community of the living and thedead. They threaten and transgress a social order that is maintained by cosmicforces of nature; consequently, the invocation of the heavens, the netherworld, andthe forces of nature. They are treated no differently than vassals who have commit-ted sacrilege and are for that reason punished and totally destroyed.It is no coincidence, therefore, that similar forms of punishment are meted outto those who have broken the terms of their agreement in both Maqlû and the trea-ties. Like live vassals, live witches are killed and their bodies are destroyed by beingburned or by being fed to animals. Like dead vassals, the bones of witches who haddied before being punished are removed from their graves and destroyed.92 Even anatural death does not protect the witch from punishment, for witches who haddied before being punished were like criminals who had sinned but had escapedretribution while alive.93 Like the vassals, the witches are not to find peace below,for their punishment would not be complete were they not also expelled from theorganized cosmic community. Hence, they are permanently eliminated from thecosmos, a punishment tantamount to exclusion from the empire. It may even bethat the witches of Maqlû are meant to symbolize the internal and external enemiesof the Neo-Assyrian Empire.94Both human society and the universal community of the living and the deadare organized and structured by means of a social contract, a contract whose formsare reflected in treaties of the first millennium. Hence, whether living or dead,witches who are accused of acting as criminals are treated as traitors and are punished92. After working out this explanation for the destruction of the witches, I noted that others hadalready noticed the connection between the reports of the destruction of dead bodies in Assyrian royalinscriptions and the transgression of and punishment threatened by the vassal treaties. In particular, seeCassin’s illuminating discussion, “La mort,” 355–72, esp. 358–59.93. This is the explanation and justification for the treatment of witches in I 37ff. The manes ofcriminal witches are treated not as roaming ghosts, but rather as nefarious evil-doers who had brokenthe code. Rather than being allowed back into the netherworld, they are to be deprived of the burialthat they had already received and cast out into the wild.94. It should be noted here that I postulate a relationship or similarity between the descriptionof witches in Maqlû and that of enemies in the Neo-Assyrian inscriptions. Elsewhere I shall investigatethe possible relationship that obtains between the epithets and descriptions of witches in Maqlû andthose of enemies in the royal inscriptions. It should be clear that I believe that Maqlû was a constructof the Neo-Assyrian period; one may wish to refine this thesis by examining whether the text linesup as well with the treaties of the second millennium.The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch32accordingly. They have broken the rules and are, therefore, to be permanently ex-cluded from the cosmos.95Thus, without denying that Assyrian treaties draw on magical conceptions andprivate rituals96 or that Maqlû shares some thoughts with other magical texts, thesimilarities between Maqlû and the Neo-Assyrian treaties and royal inscriptions sug-gest rather the more significant conclusion that the Maqlû passage and the Assyriantexts are the result of common literary activity and share a world of social thought.VI. ConclusionThe purpose of the introduction to Maqlû, Tablet I, lines 1–72, is to enlist theheavens, the netherworld, and the forces of nature as allies of the human protago-nist so that they may give testimony to and support the assertion that both live anddead witches are under an obligation sanctioned by oath and that they must bebrought to trial for allegedly breaking the terms of an agreement. In lines 73ff. thejudgment itself begins, with the intention of destroying the witches and not allow-ing them to find a place in the netherworld.What seems to distinguish the final version of Maqlû from most other anti-witchcraft rituals is the fact that its purpose is not only to kill, transform, and expela human witch but also to prevent dead witches, the supernatural witch, fromfunctioning as part of the integrated world that encompassed the night sky and thenetherworld, and to send them off to such places as the chaotic steppe, a regionwhich is part neither of the world of the living or the dead, nor of the gods ofheaven or the netherworld.In trying to tease out the image of the witch, we have considered both the hu-man witch along with her community and the supernatural witch along with thebroader cosmic community of heaven, earth, and netherworld, and have learned to95. But such total destruction of witches during an annual festival that brings together the livingand dead serves more than one purpose. As noted, it punishes those who have broken the social com-pact and threatened society. Furthermore, it serves to educate and inculcate social values of obedi-ence, conformity, and loyalty. It illustrates and thus teaches what happens to those who break thesocial contract: total exclusion.Additionally, it serves to scapegoat a group and to restabilize the community by defining a groupas anti-social and worthy of punishment. It thus provides a focus for hostility. Ridding the communityof witches once a year thus would have served the communal need of concretizing and eliminatingpotentially destructive social enmity; the hostility was given the form of witches—their destructionand expulsion served to cleanse the community. But the belief that an infernal witch reappeared at the time of the return of the dead may wellhave also served yet one more social need. One way of dealing with the ambivalent feelings engen-dered by the return of the dead and the danger thereby suggested was to project onto a segment ofthose who returned the image not of family but of witches, beings who are on the margin and areperhaps even outsiders—outsiders to the family and perhaps to the community and to humanity ingeneral. In demonic guise these beings are surely enemies who deserve punishment.96. Cf. Parpola/Watanabe, Neo-Assyrian Treaties, xxxvii–xxxviii."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I33think in terms of both. For, if nothing else, here in Maqlû we have a text which op-erates in punctual, linear time and focuses on the individual, but at the same timehas as its arena durative, cyclical time and focuses on an integrated cosmos. It rep-resents the integration of an anti-human-witch ritual into a calendrical ceremonyin which the living and the dead meet and resolve their tensions. Maqlû is a witch-craft ceremony that has been overlaid by demonic and infernal imagery and set intoa cosmic context, a context informed by many of the thoughts and forms of the po-litical and social ideology of its day.Excursus: AntecedentsTreaty or covenant ideology of the Neo-Assyrian period and the calendrical fu-nerary setting of the Maqlû ceremony in Abu explain, in part, the strange nature ofthe work—namely, the unexpected and initially perplexing appearance of deadwitches as an object of the ritual, and the bringing together of both living and deadwitches in one ritual and the performance of the ceremony to destroy both. Butperhaps we should also approach this problem from a diachronic point of view, forit is possible that additional factors that provide some missing links may be found ifwe look back to the very creation of the work itself.97Let us recall that the present lengthy ceremony grew out of an earlier short rit-ual.98 In the course of its development, the ceremony was transformed and restruc-tured, and assumed the new forms, images, and goals that typify it and set it offfrom most other magical texts. Moreover, the very section—lines 1–72 of the firsttablet—that occasioned the difficulties that this essay addresses was itself not part ofthe original text of Maqlû and was only added to the work when Maqlû was trans-formed into a nighttime ceremony. It should not surprise us, then, that we can per-haps solve the problems posed by the text—namely, the treatment and nature ofthe witch—by recalling aspects of the history of Maqlû and then approaching thefinal version not only on its own terms but also with the sensitivity gained from anunderstanding of its history. Thus, we may perhaps understand the nature of thewitch by noting the forms of evil in the oldest segments of the text, forms whichcoalesce in the image of the witch in our final version.The early short version of Maqlû was originally constructed out of two inde-pendent rituals. Already in that early version, there were two separate images of97. Another contributing factor may be the evolution of a “state” approach to the dead, that is,an evolution from an early family situation, wherein parents who mistreat children were excludedfrom membership in the community of ghosts of dead family members, to a situation where membersof society who are evil are excluded from membership in the organized world of the dead. This seemsto be an expansion of social nexus and obligation comparable to the development of the biblical “cov-enant/berith” from a compact holding together a clan or patriarchal family to one which held to-gether the Israelite polity in the form of the Deuteronomic covenant.98. The earlier version is isolated and reconstructed in my “Demonic Image,” 41–45, and “EarlyForm,” 1–57.The Socio-Religious Framework of Maqlû, Part I"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Tzvi Abusch34evil, each corresponding to one of the ritual sets. In the first set, the image of theenemy was that of the normal human witch; in the second set, the enemy assumeda demonic or ghostly form.99 In the combining of the two ceremonies, we have amerger of anti-witch incantations involving judgment and burning with generalanti-demon incantations involving rites of burning, dousing, and expulsion. Twoforms of evil—the human witch and the demon—were brought together.As noted already in the conclusion to §III, the later version of Maqlû thusevolved from an early version where the human and the spectral/demonic had al-ready been brought together. It seems more than a coincidence that important, al-beit complex, features of the final version of Maqlû fit nicely with features of theoriginal version, and that the human witch and the ghostly and/or demonic forceof the early version may be associated with the live and dead witches, respectively,of the later version. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the later configuration and useagainst the company of live and dead witches applied already in the early version.Thus, it seems judicious to end our present discussion with a question: are the olderanti-witch and anti-demon/ghost tendencies of the original short version the directprecursors of the purpose of the final recension as a ritual directed against both liv-ing and dead witches, or are these features of the old version simply a fertile groundwhich allowed the development of the later bifurcation? Or is it simply a coinci-dence that both versions have similar features?99.

Every detail, including several collations, has beenscrutinized, so it would be futile to repeat the whole discussion in the hope thatsomething substantial could be added to it. Yet, a number of contributions by vari-ous authors illustrate how the gradual clarification of dubious points may, step bystep, be possible in a process that never seems to end, so it may still be worthwhileto reconsider some crucial points. In this spirit, this study is dedicated to the mem-ory of Thorkild Jacobsen, a master of interpreting cuneiform literature. It is an at-tempt to provide new insight into the Atrahasis Epic and is inspired by one ofJacobsen’s main strengths: never to see things in isolation, and never to lose sight ofa wider coherent and meaningful context. In the present case, the solutions to besuggested here have been anticipated by others, in particular, by Karl Oberhuber, 1 1. K. Oberhuber (1982). Cf. also A. D. Kilmer, Or 41 (1972): 164, who explained d Wê-ila as wêlu , from awîlu . My major point of disagreement with Oberhuber is that I do not find it necessaryto look for a “philologische Beweisführung” (p. 279 n. 4) and to revert to unlikely sign values, suchas /aw/ for wa , in * aw-e-i-la (I 223, cf. p. 280) in order to make things look like etymologies that areacceptable to modern standards, when puns, and not modern philology, are intended by the ancienttexts. One must keep in mind that such a fundamental phenomenon as the Semitic root was notknown before the Arabic grammarians, who were inspired by the Greeks centuries later. The modernlinguistic concept of etymology was completely unknown in ancient Mesopotamia; all attempts tofind an awareness of such a concept are mistaken. Puns were simply the “etymologies” of those days.The use of homonyms, synonyms, and anagrams as a compositional principle in Enuma Eli s wasdiscussed by P. Michalowski, “Presence at the Creation,” in Lingering over Words . . . Studies Moran , ed.T. Abusch et al. (Atlanta, 1990), 381–96, esp. pp. 386 ff. However, I disagree with Michalowski if thatuse is to be taken as an indication that the Mesopotamians were as capable of “reflexive analysis” asthe Greeks but only expressed this through a different “narrative technique.” Play with linguistic ex-pressions became a common phenomenon in the late lexical series Nabnîtu , Erim h u s , and Antagal , but "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Bendt Alster 36Stephen A.

L. Moran, who has published some outstanding studies on the Atrahasis Epic. 5 By relating the name of the god (I 223) from whose slaughtered body the firsthuman being was created to the opening lines of the poem (I 1), I hope to set theproblems into a wider perspective, relating them to ancient epics in general and tothe prose epics of the Pentateuch in particular, which in so many ways are themat-ically related to the Atrahasis Epic.The name was read and translated as follows by Lambert/Millard, I 223: 6 d we-e-i-la s a i- s u- ª ú º † e 4 - e-ma, “Wê-ila, who had personality.” This name was long con-sidered a crux. Of course, one might expect such a name to be significant, but hereagreement stops, both with regard to the reading of the name and the interpreta-tion of the complete phrase. Yet, with all reasonable degree of certainty, we cannow say that “personality” is a mistranslation for “plan,” “inspiration,” or the like,i.e., an instigation to lead the rebellion against Enlil, and that the “one” god whois slaughtered to create mankind is in fact the leader of the rebellion and preciselythe one named d we-e ( -i-la ) in I 223. 7 The newly created human being preserved a 2. This study was written before those of S. A. Geller (1993) and T. Abusch (1998) becameknown to me. Geller sees line I 1 of the Atrahasis Epic, ilu-awîlum, as a compound term, “god-man,”comparable to lullû-awîlum , “human-man,” an original unity of god and man. In I 223 “the god Wê(ila) was chosen to be slaughtered because his name contained the phoneme /w/ through whichthe new creature, man ( awîlum ), was to be distinguished from divinity ( ilum )” (p. 41). So this originalunity was split into two parts with the result that man and god became distinct. To support this in-terpretation, a Late Assyrian creation myth is quoted (p. 67: W. R. Mayer, Orientalia 56 [1987]: 55–68), in which lullû-awîlum is seen as “common-man,” as opposed to maliku-amêlu , “ruler man.” WhileI appreciate the general approach and in particular the recognition of puns as a compositional princi-ple in the epic, I allow myself to comment that to me the gist comes too close to Plato’s dual natureof mankind to be convincing for an Old Babylonian epic.3. Abusch (1998) has a detailed discussion of Atrahasis I 192–226 (pp. 364–72). He also empha-sizes the great significance of puns, thus between awîlu , “man,” and the god’s name wê ( - ) ila , fromwhom “mankind receives both its life and its name” (p. 368).4. Jacobsen translated line 1 as “when Ilu (i.e., Enlil) was the boss” in The Treasures of Darkness ,117, as well as in Essays on the Ancient Near East in Memory of Jacob Joel Finkelstein , ed. M. de Jong Ellis(Hamden, 1977), 117, which translation I find most unlikely.5. Cf., e.g., Moran 1970: 52 n. 14.

Lambert/Millard 1969: 58.7. This was first clarified in Moran’s short but penetrating study, 1970: 51–52. The word † e 4 - e-ma anticipates a pun on e † immu (I 228), the “spirit” of the slaughtered god remaining in mankind, asseen by J. Bottéro (1982: 28). This does not mean that an etymology is intended! (Cf. now Abusch1998: 368–69, who also recognizes a pun between † êmu , “intelligence,” and damu , “blood.”) this still has nothing to do with etymologies.

First, why would a meaningless apparent Sumerogram,which does not even make sense in Sumerian, appear in this context, where everysyllable is beautifully suited to a rhythmical pattern? 9 Yet von Soden’s reading raisesa more serious problem, namely, is i-la part of the name, d we-e-i-la , or is it a separatenoun, which would then be the accusative of i-lu ( m )? The former solution was chosen by J. Bottéro, who translated “Et le dieu Wê,qui avait de l’‘esprit’ ”; 10 in other words, i-la was separated from Wê and taken inapposition to it. A different solution was chosen by B. Foster, who translated “They slaughteredWe-ilu, who had the inspiration, in their assembly.” 11 Here i-la is taken as part ofthe name, which is not understood as a fixed form, but as a noun whose nomina-tive form is We-ilu . He supports this by saying that “ We-ilu may be a pun on theAkkadian word for ‘man’ ( awêlu ),” 12 as already suggested by K. Oberhuber. 13 This study proposes a modification of the interpretations already offered byOberhuber and Foster. Whether We-e ( - ) i-la is an undeclined noun or a noun withan accusative apposition would make little difference once we recognize the allu-sions involved. If we accept the assumed nominative form of the first part of I 223,* we-e ( - ) i-lu ( m ) , the connection with the very opening line of the epic is obvious(I 1–2): in u ma il u aw i lumubl u dulla izbil u s up si kku When gods were men,14they bore the burden and suffered the toil. In other words, in I 223 we ilu(m) is a play on awilum ilu, the reverse order ofI 1: ilu awilum. Thus, we ilu(m) is not meant as an etymology, but is just what itappears to be, a pun. So, is we-e(-)i-la the accusative form of a declined noun, anundeclined noun, or a noun with apposition?

An ancient epic of this type may be suggestive of a number of possi-bilities, rather than just one. After all, that is why they keep puzzling us, and thatis why they use puns to create an atmosphere of unspoken allusions. What makesthe interpretation suggested here different from those made earlier is not that it pro-poses a new reading or the like, but that it sees the name of the god as a consciousreversal of the pattern with which the poem starts. This makes good sense in the context. The poem starts with the gods havingto do hard physical work—one may understand this as “as if they were men,” or“like men,” as a later version has it, but this makes little difference as long as onekeeps in mind that mankind was not yet created. Now the gods were relieved fromhard work by the human being created in I 223. So, the initial situation “gods-men” is reversed to “man-god,” expressed by the reversal of the order of the twocorresponding parts of the pun.15 With this in mind, it is worthwhile to reopen the discussion of the two partlybroken passages in which the name dwê is likely to occur for the first time. First, inI 47, the traces suit the sign -e of dwe-e very well (CT 46, pl. II 47), so the proposedrestoration may be considered a good choice, unless one wants to drive skepticismbeyond all reasonable limits.16 Second, in I 144, there is certainly not enough roomto restore dwe-e-i-la, but, with Pettinato and Moran,17 there are good reasons to re-store dwe-e. If so, the form dwe-e is indeed the name of the god, and ilu is a separatenoun used in I 223 in apposition to dwe-e, as already suggested by Bottéro. We still are at a loss to provide an etymology for dwe-e or to explain what itmeans. Perhaps the solution is surprisingly simple: The name would be a mysteryto any reader, ancient as well as modern, when it occurs, presumably for the firsttime, in I 47 and I 144, and probably it has no specific etymology. It is only withits appearance in I 223 in the phrase dwe-e ila that its full implication as a pun on*awilum ilu would become evident to ancient readers. That names play a great rolein the Atrahasis Epic appears readily from the renaming of the mother goddess,Mami as Belet-kala-ili, “Mistress-of-All-the-Gods,” in I 247.18 From a larger perspective, punning on names is a well-known phenomenon,perhaps best known in Akkadian literature from the seventh tablet of Enuma Elis,with its puns on the name of Marduk.19 Yet, one may go back in time and note,15. This does not in any way imply that I accept J. van Dijk’s concept of “der Gott-Mensch”(RlA 3: 538 a). 16. Collation by Lambert, Atrahasis, pl. 11. The traces do not fit [dwe-e-i-l]a, but once we rec-ognize that the name is dwe-e alone, further discussions of the restoration seem unnecessary. 17.

It is therefore most unlikely that the name of the mother-goddess should be restored as db[e-le-et ì-lí . . . ] in the Old Babylonian text, I 189. Nothing prevents the restoration dm[a-mi, or dn[in-tu(E = CT 46, pl. XXII obv. III 2), since virtually nothing remains of the sign following the divinedeterminative. 19. Cf. J.

As is the case with Genesis, it should be read as a dramain which every trick counts and is accepted with pleasure, so long as it serves agood purpose, even if by modern western standards the moral values may some-times seem somewhat dubious, and deities as well as fellows may be deceived andbecome the object of derision. Like Genesis, the Atrahasis Epic encompasses thewhole mythological history of mankind, including the creation of man, the firstcouple capable of propagating themselves, drought, famine, the story of the Flood,and overpopulation.22 Select BibliographyAbusch, T.1998 “Ghost and God: Some Observations on a Babylonian Understanding of Hu-man Nature.” Pp. 363–83 in Self, Soul and Body in Religious Experience, ed.

I hope this might have appealed to Thorkild Jacobsen,scholar and poet, whose vivid imagination of Mesopotamia was stimulated by seeing and livingamong these landscapes. He was pre-eminent among those who have had that privilege. Landscape is all around us, but it is not the same as the environment. The en-vironment is full of space, and spaces; but (as has been said) it is only when merespace becomes place that the environment becomes a landscape. Landscape is “theworld as it is known to those who dwell therein.” 1 It can be natural or man-made;or it can be made by the gods. It includes sights but, while by imagination most typically we understand visualimagination, landscape also includes sounds and smells—if not, perhaps, taste ortouch. 2 It includes weather—especially extreme weather, such as floods and storms, 1.

It shapes our thoughts and ways of seeing things.No inhabitant of the modern world needs to be reminded that landscape canchange. As one recent commentator has put it, “One cannot extrapolate from thepresent despoiled environment of southern Iraq to the Mesopotamian past and onecannot compare Sumerians with Marsh Arabs.” 4 It is a matter of record that thereedbeds, channels, and lagoons of the Marshes have been changed even more dra-matically in the very recent past. In ancient times, for a different habitat of the re-gion, it has been deduced that on the hilly flanks and higher ranges of the Zagros,oak and pistachio forest-steppe gave way very gradually to dense oak forest as tem- peratures rose and dryness declined up to ca. 3400 b.c. , while elsewhere vegetationcover was stripped away by the grazing of animals and the activities of man overseveral millennia, yielding imperceptibly a wholly altered set of vistas. 5 Neverthe-less, there are important ways in which other elements of the landscape have sur-vived the centuries and often can even be localised. The weather and the widehorizon of the sky endure, too. By contemplating such features in the Iraq of todayit is possible, with appropriate cautions, to use landscape as one way of recreatingthe Sumerian cognitive framework.The anthropologist Eric Hirsch refers to “the meaning imputed by local peopleto their cultural and physical surroundings.” 6 That is to say that the meaning oflandscape is culture-dependent. Malinowski, and his students in the “Britishschool” of anthropology, made a point of subtly heightening the contrasts betweenthe local interpretation of surroundings and what the same environment might ormight not signify to twentieth-century Western outsiders. The southern Mesopo-tamian environment may appear to us (academics of the Western tradition) bareand featureless. It has no meaning until meaning is conferred on it by people, whotranslate it into a significant landscape; it was certainly not bare and featureless forancient Mesopotamians. For, like the Australian desert described by Howard Mor-phy, 7 the Mesopotamian plain was vivid with the mythology of its inhabitants.Of course, Assyriologists cannot ask living informants, as an anthropologistmight. The source of my information will be the literature in Sumerian, fromwhich we can learn how some “Sumerians,” at least, construed their surroundings 4.

The usual cautions must be urged—individuals, groups, local traditions,each must be treated as independent voices; “the literature” does not present a uni-fied “Sumerian” view extending over several centuries.For landscape is also a feature of literature, a cluster of images with both a localand a chronological extension. In this connection, the Russian critic M. M. Bakhtindeveloped the concept “chronotope” to refer to a feature of literary art wherebyplace and time fuse to become a single metaphor. 8 To a large degree, the creationof mythic narratives in the world of the mythic imagination uses as its buildingblocks “everyday” landscape (even when the compound of mythic elements whichresults is purely fantastic). And just as the literary imagination feeds on objective re-ality, so the physical landscape which was perceived by early Mesopotamians as sur-rounding them in their everyday lives could come alive as the scene of mythicalnarratives unfolding through time and be understood in terms of those myths, andgiven a meaning by them. Yet the reconstruction of that significant ancient envi-ronment cannot be separated from our own perceptions of the landscape that webelieve the Sumerians experienced—a point to which I return below.Unlike the scholars of our own century, the Sumerians had no interest in thequestion of where “the Sumerians” in particular, as opposed to any other people,had come from. They very rarely write about “the Sumerians.” 9 On the otherhand, they knew that mankind, in general, had not inhabited the earth since thevery beginning of time—there had been a time when there were no humans—andthey knew that the very first men had lived in an uncivilised state like animals.They realised that civilisation had been a later development. It fascinated them tospeculate about how the world had come into being and how things had been atthe beginning of time. The very oldest of all Sumerian literature is that of the Early Dynastic Period. 10 It is not very extensive, and it is extremely difficult to read. But recently, scholarshave been struggling to make sense of it, as in a highly interesting study by BendtAlster and Aage Westenholz discreetly tucked away in a recent issue of the journal Acta Sumerologica under the title “The Barton Cylinder.” 11 The object itself (theBarton Cylinder, so-called because it was first published by George Barton in 1918)is a beautiful example of late Early Dynastic calligraphy. It begins: 8. Drawn on by P. Michalowski in “Mental Maps and Ideology: Reflections on Subartu,” in TheOrigins of Cities in Dry-Farming Syria , ed. H. Weiss (Guilford, Conn., 1986), 129–56.9.

But they are linked to a known loca-tion—in this case, the city of Nibru (Nippur). Nibru here is both the scene of amythic drama and, at the same time, the familiar city in northern Sumer. It is trans-figured by this drama to a symbolic status—like Jerusalem, Byzantium, or Rome—which makes it far more than a mere city. The location becomes a metaphor.The gods, too, had come into being at a certain point, at that primeval timebefore heaven and earth had been separated. In The Debate between Sheep and Grain the landscape location where that creation occurred is described as “the h ursa F (hill)of Heaven-and-Earth”—neither a flat plain nor a mountain, but a hilly landscape: 12 h ur-sa F an ki-bi-da-ke 4 . . .

They lived up onit, and mankind lived down below. The imaginative stimulus for the idea of a singleHoly Mound—a dul or tell—must have been the numerous ruin mounds that dotthe surface of the Mesopotamian plain, with evidence of ancient habitation. No-body lived on them, but you only have to investigate them cursorily—if your vil-lage is next to one and you stroll up there of an evening—to realise, from theceramic remains and the occasional skull or bone, that they had been inhabited inthe past. But by whom? The mythic imagination tells us that this is where the godslived in the most distant past, with their feet on the ground but close to the sky.16A mythic image or metaphor such as the Holy Mound, then, is a single cosmiclocation derivable from generalised elements of the landscape, such as uninhabitedruin mounds, that are multiple and ubiquitous.Other myths are located instead at specific unique locations in the “real” land-scape.17 It is instructive to study the geography of the relative locations of mytho-logical and cultic sites in the light of divine family relationships. For instance, Enlil,the god of Nippur, travels to nearby Eres (perhaps modern Abu Salabikh?) to seekthe permission of its goddess, Nisaba, to marry her daughter Sud, the goddess ofSuruppag, which is also located close by.18 Geographical locations and the familyconnections of the gods cannot be separated. Anthropologists have recorded howthe myths of Australian Aboriginal people typically take the form of journeys of an-cestral beings across known land. Similarly, the Sumerian journey myths such asEnki’s Journey to Nippur19 and Nanna-Suen’s Journey to Nippur20 unfold in a worldpopulated exclusively by deities, but where these deities travel from one well-known human city to another by the human means of sailing downstream, or be-ing rowed or towed upstream in a boat.In Enki’s Journey to Nippur, the god first builds his own temple in the city ofEridu and then boards his boat, which of its own accord conveys him to Nippur,2116. This interpretation seems plausible to me, though I am aware that Thorkild Jacobsen, argu-ing against S. N. Kramer’s proposal that the Holy Mound was a sort of Weltberg, proposed half a cen-tury ago that the Holy Mound was located in the foothills of the Zagros mountains, whose fertileclimate may in a very real sense have contributed to the development of human civilisation, see “Su-merian Mythology: a Review Article,” JNES 5 (1946): 141.17.

Thesiger described a particular lagoon in theMarshes, appropriately named Umm al Binni:24 A fishing camp of the Berbera. When I was there in Oct.

In the technical language of scientific geology, the Zagros chain is anancient part of Africa that was pushed up over a suture formed by the closing up ofan ancient ocean that lay between what were then Africa and Asia, approximately15 to 20 million years ago. This explanation of the geological landscape might besatisfying in twentieth-century terms. The Sumerians, starting equally from thepremise that the Zagros had not always been in existence, could use mythologicallanguage and make that landscape meaningful by describing it as a heap of stones—a heap of dead stone warriors—piled up by a god whose aim, ultimately, was toinitiate agriculture for mankind: an interpretation of landscape which views it ashaving been shaped in the way that it is for human purposes.Figure 5. “The Qandil Range (up to 11,000 ft.) from Aina village, in May.” (Vol. 19: S.

This wholly imaginativescene, despite its formulaic quality, derives ultimately from real landscape:A shaggy wild bull, a fine-looking wild bull, a wild bull tossing its horns, a wild bull in hunger(?), resting, seeking with its voice the horned wild bulls of the hills, the pure place —in this way(?) it was chewing aromatic simgig as if it were barley, it was grinding up the wood of the cypress as if it were esparto grass,it was sniffing with open mouth at the foliage of the senu tree as if it weregrass.It was drinking the water of the rolling rivers, it was belching from ilinnum, the pure plant of the mountains.

Of course, wildmountain landscape has an interesting history of cultivation in modern Europeanliterature, especially during the Romantic era.

Ofcourse, as an imaginative locale the landscape of the inner Zagros may have beenknown only, or mainly, by repute to the Sumerian poets. It is not necessary to as-sume that many had traveled there to experience it first-hand. Anyway, these moredistant locations, in particular, are mental constructs: they have no necessary con-nection with the topography of particular places. Part of the structural function ofsuch scenes in these poems is to be what Piotr Michalowski has called “paradig-matic representations of the superiority of the culture of Sumer”: we are intendedto contrast the mountains with the desirable world at home.32 Symbolically, thislandscape is seen in exclusively negated terms. The Sumerians chose to regard travelin the mountains as downright dangerous and probably fatal.For my final landscapes, I move to the suburban countryside. First, the un-cultivated, rural landscape. Covering large areas in some parts of the country, reed-beds in particular were immensely meaningful to the Sumerians (as demonstratedin detail most recently by Gwendolyn Leick)33—they were places of refuge, wheresecret sexual encounters took place, such as those between the gods Enki and Nin-hursaFa and a whole series of young female deities.34 Various gods (in different ac-counts An, Nintu and Enlil) are said to be responsible for the birth of different typesof vegetation. The short poem about the sumunda grass was published by S. N.Kramer in 1980, but has not attracted much attention since.35 It is an incompletelypreserved narrative involving the lover deities Inana and Dumuzi. At the time ofthe Flood,Heaven impregnated, Earth gave birth,she gave birth also to the sumunda grass.Those who were fortunate enough to survive the Flood subsequently faced anothertribulation in the sumunda grass. This plant, most probably a wild grass such as es-parto (Stipa tenacissima),36 could be used for weaving baskets, in boat building andfor making flimsy shelters. It was connected with Inana because it was used for her32. “Mental Maps and Ideology,” in Origins of Cities, 133.33. Sex and Eroticism in Sumerian Literature (London/New York, 1994), esp. 32.34.

But it was a weedwhich had to be removed from fields and canal banks, a pestilential weed which re-quired back-breaking labour to remove.

When made into a shelter,one moment he stands up, one moment he lies down.Having kindled a fire, he spreads it wide.The passage is more than a series of statements about the uses and nuisances of aparticular species of grass: it incorporates a set of human responses to the rural land-scape—uncultivated, full of wild vegetation, maybe dangerous in hot dry weather,but nevertheless lived near and worked beside.Figure 8. “The central marshes in spring.” (Vol. 27: S.

An excellent new edition of the narrative poemInana and Su-kale-tuda was produced by Konrad Volk in 1995. The composition re-lates a series of encounters between the great goddess and a humble gardener’s boywhose name appears to mean “Spotty.”37 Of course, he is the precursor of one ofthe goddess’ lovers whose inhumane treatment by her is the subject of Gilgames’staunting in Tablet VI of the Babylonian Epic of Gilgames. Although it may be pos-sible to interpret the narrative on one level as a political allegory, the simplest andmost direct reading of it describes a rural agricultural landscape and life in Sumer—anybody’s vegetable garden, a place in which tasks are performed, weather condi-tions experienced and times of day pass.Su-kale-tuda is working in the garden. Apparently, he is not even a very goodgardener’s boy, since none of his vegetable plots thrive, and he appears to have thehabit of pulling up the plants which he has sown earlier. This rural scene is not pre-sented as a wholly idyllic environment: a typical scene involves a sudden dust-storm(which is when he catches sight of the goddess Inana):. . . Su-kale-tuda (“Spotty”) was his name indeed. This man, the son of Igi-sigsig . . . wanted to water garden plotsand build an irrigation installation for vegetables.Something which no longer existed in a single plot—what was it that nolonger existed? —he had pulled out, roots and all, and chewed it up. What had the stormwind then brought? It blew the dust of the mountains into his eyes. When he tried to wipe the corner of his eyes with his hand, he got some of it out. There seemed to be no end (to the dust-storm). He raised his eyes to the lower land. He sees the high gods of the landwhere the sun rises. He raised his eyes to the upper land. He sees the high gods of the landwhere the sun sets. He directs his glance to a single ghost. He recognised a single deity by her phenomenon. He saw her who was there to perfect the me. He paid attention to her for whom the destiny of the gods is decided. (91–106)In the hot Mesopotamian sun, the exhausted goddess looks for somewhere to havea sleep, and lights on a corner of Spotty’s vegetable garden. The scene resonateswith the long shadows of the late afternoon:By a plot which he had approached many, many times, there stood at that place a single shady tree. 37. K.

A worried adolescent,he goes off to tell his father. The rural location which forms the landscape back-ground of the narrative is emphasised by his father’s advice. In the country he willbe easily tracked down and identified; the best thing will be to go to the nearbytown, where he can quickly become invisible among the crowds (lines 139–84):The boy went to his father in the house and spoke to him.

The woman did not find him in all the lands.These are my Sumerian landscapes. From an analytical point of view, somemyths can be characterised as narratives which happen to have as their setting a par-ticular landscape. This may be the mountains (as in Lugalbanda in the MountainCave), or it may be the cultivated suburban landscape (as in Inana and Su-kale-tuda).By contrast, some narratives have a crucial explanatory function which lends a cen-tral role of significance to their landscape settings (such as Lugale, one of the over-arching themes of which is the generation of the mountains; or the opening ofSheep and Grain, with the mythologeme of the gods living on the Holy Mound inthe earliest times). Looking at it from another perspective, landscapes can be separated into thespecific and the general. It is possible to say that some narratives are concerned withactual, unique (and often named) landscapes, e.g., the various Journey myths (whichbegin and end with, and pass through, specific identifiable cities and canals inSumer); the fecundity of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (in the passage from Enkiand the World Order), and the rocky hillsides of the Jebel Himrin (in Lugale). How-ever, other myths are concerned with more generalised landscapes, e.g., Lugalbandain the Mountain Cave (unpopulated mountain landscape), The Sumunda Grass orInana and Su-kale-tuda (respectively, the uncultivated and the cultivated rural land-scape of the suburban countryside); or they are inspired by, or imagined in termsof, a more generalised landscape, such as the Holy Mound, which has a unique lo-cation only in the world of mythology but is imaginatively derived from wide-spread features of the everyday landscape. Landscape is a crucial element in giving meaning to words, because all narra-tive and all rhetoric uttered by humans must be imagined with a background in alocalised and visualised setting, however unconsciously formulated by the author orspeaker as well as by the reader or hearer. The experience of landscape, or theimagination of it, is an unavoidable factor in the reading of literature; it is not pos-sible to read ancient poetry without some visual imagination of its landscape set-ting, nor should we affect to do so.At the same time, I have argued that, historically, for those Mesopotamianswho were familiar with the mythical narratives preserved in the literature of Sum-erian high culture, their experience of the real physical landscapes of their dailylives would have been transfigured by their own familiarity with that literature.They inhabited and moved through a world which was also the world of their be-liefs. This aspect of ancient cognition cannot now be communicated to us, but it isimplicit in written sources and can be inferred from living cultures. In this respect,a modern anthropological investigator has the advantage of live informants who canbe questioned.There is a third consideration. A postmodern perspective reminds us that whilethe conventions of scholarly endeavour encourage the reconstruction of a view of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Sumerians in Their Landscape61Sumer as if through Sumerian eyes, we also cannot escape seeing it through ourown eyes. Landscapes which exist today or existed recently in the modern NearEast are (to a large degree, and with certain important reservations) the same land-scapes that ancient peoples saw and which stimulated their imagination. Just as theylived among their familiar surroundings, so modern study of the ancient Near Eastis equally an attempt to dwell in that world. To perceive a landscape involves re-membrance and recognition; to have experienced those landscapes in actuality, andto export them from the Near East for re-creation at a distance, can only enrich ourreading of what Mesopotamians wrote. While such experience may be derivedfrom personal presence on the ground, more likely it will be mediated by the ex-perience of others through photographs or maps in books. In fact, the great major-ity of present-day readers experience Mesopotamia only textually, at second-hand.We “read” the strange words, new to us, by recourse to available and familiar pub-lished images.

Rather thanattempt to combine the features of /d/ and /g/ into a hypothetical phoneme, onecan assume that the alternation represents a consonant cluster. The closest parallelis the name of the measure *litku, also a Semitic loanword15 and written li(d)da orlí-ga.16 Thus, Semitic *tirik/qtu could have given rise to both ti-rí-da and ti-rí-ga in Sumerian. That the Akkadian translation of ti-rí-d/ga is something otherthan tirik/qtu constitutes no objection. Something similar happens with keser—tuku, which apparently is semantically close to ti-rí-d/ga (from [4], [5], and [7]).I would propose (a) that mus(u)ku is, in fact, a variant of (m)usukku, and (b) that thelatter is not a borrowing from Sumerian but rather a Semitic loanword from thesame root as Akk. esehu, esek/qu.17 This is not the place for a full phonological andsemantic discussion of /ú-zuh/ : /ú-zug/.1811.

One can now translate:[1] “You are an outcast, (but) I will feed you; you are an outcast, (but) I will giveyou drink; you are my son, (even if ) your god is against you.” [6] “Behind a thief, (there is always) an outcast/outlaw.” [8] “One who has the looks of an outlaw.”The broken contexts [9] and [10] are probably similar to [7]: “the sons(?) of Nip-pur, uncontrolled fugitives.” From the final lines (38–40) of this text, it appears thatNippurites had been deported to Uruk and its dependencies, and then set free togo back to Nippur.19[11] seems to be related to proverb [1], and can be translated (text of C and D):“He had water poured in the open libation pipe, at the grave, he not being an out-cast of (his) god.”20I will not venture a translation of [2] and [3]; suffice it to say that “king/lord ofthe ethical barriers/taboos” is not inconceivable, and that su-um could include theverb déhi discussed above.214.

A. Cavigneaux, ZA 85 (1995): 29, proposes “sans que le terita fût un dieu,” disregarding thegenitive. The following, parallel line (cf. ZA 85 [1995]: 22) is not understandable; if the variant tak4of Tell Haddad (MA 12) is genuine and means something like “rejected,” it would be a meaningfulparallel to the line with ti-rí-da.21.

The Two Verbal StemsIt is well known that grammatical texts and lexical lists know two terms, ham†uand marû, to designate related verbal stems. Their analysis has given rise to a con-siderable literature.23 So far, all attestations have been post-Old Babylonian. Therecan hardly be any doubt that the logograms lagab24 and bu, which in the presentOB tablet accompany dug4 and e, respectively, are designations of the two supple-tive stems. Their obvious translations are “short” and “long,” with the readingslu-gud and gíd, respectively. Compare the scribal use of these terms in the signnames sagittu (< sa-gíd) and salguttu (< sa-l(u)gud),25 of sa “the long sa” and di“the short sa,” respectively. It is likely that the terms refer to the morphologicalshape of the stems but not necessarily to alternations in vowel quantity; rather,“long” seems to refer to the addition of the affix -e, reduplication, and other possiblechanges.26 Affixation and reduplication result in “longer” forms, phonologically andmorphologically, by the addition or repetition of a morpheme. It may not be quiteclear at first glance how du and Fen, and dug4 and e could differ in “length,” butthere is a plausible explanation for such cases. Assuming that the short/long stemalternation applied across the board, according to some basic, simple rules (seeabove), these rules would be well known to native speakers, and thus there wouldhave been no need in the “regular” cases to make explicit this morphological processin lexical and grammatical lists. Only in stem suppletion or alternation and in other23. The literature up to 1984 can be found in M.-L. Thomsen, The Sumerian Language (Copen-hagen, 1984), 123. In the same year, J. Black’s monograph, Sumerian Grammar in Babylonian Theory,(Studia Pohl: Series Maior 12; Rome, 1984) presented extensive summaries and criticism of previousstudies and opinions on the subject. While some of Black’s conclusions may be questionable, his his-torical presentation of the question is the most complete available. For more recent bibliography, seeAttinger, Eléments de linguistique, 185 §119. Add the important article of J. Krecher, “Die marû-Kategorie des sumerischen Verbums,” in Vom Alten Orient zum Alten Testament: Festschrift für WolframFreiherrn von Soden zum 85. Geburtstag am 19. Juni 1993, ed. M. Dietrich and O.

See my remarks in OrAn 21 (1982): 10 on the possible phonological shape(s) of this word.26. Krecher, AOAT 240, 147, proposes a phonological interpretation similar to the one givenhere. In the “regular” verbs, the contrast between “short” and “long” was possibly more complexthan a simple /CVC/ versus /CV-Ce/. The addition of the affix -e modifies the syllabic structure ofthe stem, leaving the nuclear vowel of the first syllable open to changes. Cross-linguistic parallels showthat oppositions of this sort in verbal stems are very frequently marked by subtle changes in tone,vowel or consonant quality, etc."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Miguel Civil70exceptional cases, where it is likely that the “length” contrast did not literally apply,did the scribes add a notation identifying the stem. In other words, in suppletivestems, the contrast is merely functional, while in the rest of the stems it had a pho-nological and morphemic basis. Thus, dug4 is “short” not because of any phono-logical feature, but because it behaves morphosyntactically like a regular “short”stem. As a corollary, the alternation short/long does not apply, as sometimes claimed,to the Akkadian verb, which has a more complex system of oppositions.27 And, fi-nally, the long form, corresponding to the incompletive/present, seems to have beenthe marked one.28This is not the place for a detailed discussion of the ham†u/marû problem, but Iwould like to conclude by noting that the long/short contrast is not contradicted bythe notorious letter UET 5 78:8–11 (see MSL 4, 21*, and Black, Sumerian Gram-mar [Rome, 1984], 103f.). Landsberger’s translation “I intend to go to Esnunna;(but) I do not know whether I shall move slowly (and arrive late) or move quickly(and arrive soon),” can be faithfully paraphrased “I do not know (yet) whether Iwill take the long road or the short road.”AddendumThe reading of um as tehe, proposed above, is confirmed by a textual variantin an OB letter, purported to be a copy of an Ur III letter of Amar-Suen to theking, presumably Sulgi (sources: A = Ni 3083 ii! 2u–9u2 [ISET 2 115]; B = N 2901;C = Ralph 16 [copy Pinches]).

It is possible that, given the difficulty at timesof keeping apart dub and um, a closer examination of some Sumerian literary pas-sages would detect further instances of the verb tehe. Perhaps Gudea Cyl. B iv 24is one of these cases. The town is waiting, in the middle of the night and with theutmost silence, for the arrival of Ninurta. His arrival is described in a single, difficultline: lugal-bi mu-um gá-e, which could be translated “the master (of the newtemple) approaches (shouting) ‘it’s me!’ ” The logogram um in some dream tablets(A. L. Oppenheim, The Interpretation of Dreams, 290ff.; Iraq 31 [1969] 157) can nowbe taken as representing †ehû in its sexual sense.27. Cf. W. G. Lambert’s remarks in ZA 81 (1991): 7–9.28. This implies taking the shorter stem as the basic one, from which the longer is formed byaffixation. Note, however, that an alternative analysis which considers the shorter form to be second-ary, and to have been formed by truncation of a longer, basic one, is traditional in the analysis of somelanguages; see, e. g., R.

Cooper In 1930, the 26-year-old Thorkild Jacobsen published “How Did GilgameshOppress Uruk?” 1 We learn from the autobiographical essay “Searching for Sumerand Akkad,” 2 written shortly before his death, that he spent the time between re-ceiving his Ph.D. in Chicago (probably June, 1929) and joining the Diyala expedi-tion ( January, 1930) in Copenhagen, so it was probably there that he wrote aboutGilgamesh. Looking at a photo taken in Iraq just a few years later of a tall, handsomeJacobsen, 3 it reminds me of Jacobsen’s description of Gilgamesh’s great strength and“enormous . . . vigor,” whose “body is all of it loaded with kuzbu ,” difficult to keepin check. 4 Jacobsen argued that the elliptical passage in SB Gilgamesh I ii describing Gil-gamesh’s oppression of Uruk can be fully understood through the help of the fig-ure of Enkidu. The latter was created as a foil for Gilgamesh, to distract him fromhis oppressive behavior. If, as “it has generally been assumed . . . he oppressed themby forcing the men to labor at the walls of Uruk and by abducting the youngwomen to his harem,” 5 there is nothing about Enkidu to suggest he would inter-rupt Gilgamesh’s building activities, and Enkidu’s history with the harlot indicatesthat he might well become one more sexual predator loosed on the young womenof Uruk. The key to the relationship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Jacobsen continues, is inthe dreams that foretell Enkidu’s coming: “Gilgame s sees an axe, with which he 1. Acta Or . 8 (1930): 62–74.2.

To satiate this he violates his unhappy subjects male andfemale at random. . . . Aruru hears their prayers and creates Engidu, a being whosesexual vigor is as strong as Gilgame s ’s, so that they, when falling in love with eachother, may neutralize each other and the inhabitants of Uruk may return to tran-quility. 8 At the end of the article, Jacobsen suggests that there may have been an early “pop-ular view, which considered bisexualism a token of superior strength.” 9 The 1930 article was not reprinted in the 1970 collection of Jacobsen’s work, Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Mesopotamian History and Culture , 10 and his interpretation of the relationship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu in The Treasuresof Darkness of 1976 was very different: From our first meeting with the young Gilgamesh he is characterized by tremen-dous vigor and energy. As ruler of Uruk he throws himself into his task with zeal.He maintains a constant military alert, calls his companions away from theirgames, and harrasses the young men of the town to the point where it gets blackbefore their eyes and they faint from weariness, and he leaves them no time fortheir families and sweethearts. . . . Gilgamesh’s superior energy and strength sethim apart and make him lonely. He needs a friend, someone who measures up tohim and can give him companionship on his own extraordinary level of potentialand aspiration. 11 The “vigor” of 1930 is still there, but it is no longer “sexual.” And the dreams thatare the key to the 1930 interpretation are not even mentioned in the twelve-pagesynopsis of Gilgamesh in Treasures , though they do appear later on in his discussionof the epic’s meaning. For Jacobsen in 1976, Gilgamesh is no longer a sexual preda-tor but rather Peter Pan: Throughout the epic Gilgamesh appears as young, a mere boy, and he holds on tothat status, refusing to exchange it for adulthood as represented by marriage andparenthood. Like Barrie’s Peter Pan he will not grow up. His first meeting withEnkidu is a rejection of marriage for a boyhood friendship. 12 6.

Concludes Jacobsen: “The GilgameshEpic is a story about growing up.” 13 Jacobsen returned to the Gilgamesh Epic in 1990. 14 He revisits the nature ofGilgamesh’s oppression of Uruk, connecting the pukku of Gilg.

Foster (Enkidu’s “friendship with Gilgamesh. . . has no sexual basis at all.”) 18 and rejected by W. G. Lambert (see immediatelybelow).

And this “myth of male friendship” is accompanied by a more perniciousstereotype of women as “unable to form friendships,” either single and vying witheach other for men’s attentions, or married and absorbed by family and domesticlife, 25 a stereotype quite familiar to students of Sumerian and Akkadian literature.D. Halperin, in “Heroes and their Pals,” 26 focuses on the three classic ancientfriendships cited by Hammond and Jablow: Gilgamesh and Enkidu, David andJonathan, Achilles and Patroclus. These are not, he emphasizes, sexual relationships;rather, “conjugal . . . and kinship relations” are used to define friendship betweenmales. 27 The sexuality of the language foretelling the meeting of Gilgamesh andEnkidu underlines that “Enkidu’s friendship affords Gilgamesh a proleptic taste of 20. “A Note on an Overlooked Word-Play in the Akkadian Gilgamesh,” in Zikir s umim . . .Studies . . .

He forces them to playcontinuously, so that their mothers and sisters have to bring them food and drink(156f.). Similarly, in the Akkadian epic, Gilgamesh would get the young men outof bed to play ball and not let them go home. The potential violence of the Meso-potamian ballgame is revealed in the late Elevation of Ishtar:42e-lagellag gis-dù-a-gim nin mè-a ur-a-ra sì-sì-ga-ba-ni-íbkima pukku u mekkê belet tahazi sutamhißu tamharuO queen of combat, let battle clash like ball and stick.Historical and ethnographic literature bear witness to bloody and even fatal ball-games.

However, erotic as-sociations are present, not only in the unsubtle symbols of ball, stick and weaponsat the ready, but also in the very verb, tebû, used to describe Gilgamesh’s raisedweapons and roused companions in lines 54f. cited above, and then used soon afterin Gilg. I iv 21 (~ P ii 6–8) to describe Enkidu’s superhuman sexuality: 6 urri u 7musi Enkidu tebima Samhat irhi, “For six days and seven nights Enkidu remainedaroused and had intercourse with Samhat.” In the Sumerian “Gilgamesh, Enkiduand the Netherworld” Gilgamesh is u5-a “mounted” on the widows’ sons (154,above; also 161), a verb also used for animal copulation. And there is the matter ofGilgamesh’s dreams, so crucial to Jacobsen’s argument in 1930. Gilgamesh sees anax, loves it (râmu) and “embraces” (hababu) it “like a wife.”48 The verb râmu, ofcourse, need not denote sexual love, and, perhaps, as Lambert suggests, “wiveswere not necessarily the best sexual partners,” and the choice of “wife” and“woman” may have been to “emphasize the steadfastness of the love,”49 but theverb hababu when used for human activity always denotes sexual intercourse.50 Theovert sexuality of this passage is reinforced by the covert eroticism present in thepunning discovered by Kilmer.51 And yet, as Lambert insists,52 the text of the epicas preserved nowhere portrays sexual contact actually taking place between the twoheroes; the homoerotic language, both explicit and implicit, may indeed be a de-vice to, on the one hand, connote the insistent, compulsive and violent nature of43.

Did Gilgamesh oppress them,too? In the Sumerian “Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld,” women are onlyoppressed because their sons or brothers are suffering. The widows and youngmaidens who cry out in lines 162f. are the mothers and sisters (156f.) who havebrought bread and water to Gilgamesh’s victims in lines 154f. Could the youngmaidens, daughters, and spouses in lines 61–63 of the SB Gilgamesh cited abovealso simply be the relatives of the unwilling ballplayers, compelled to be spectatorsat the royal sport? If this were all we had, the answer would be affirmative, but weknow from Gilg. II ii and P iv–v that Gilgamesh claimed the brides of Uruk forhimself on their wedding night.53 In the Akkadian epic, the women of Uruk areoppressed in their own right.In fact, the history of Gilgamesh’s troubled sexuality, which plays such a pivotalrole in the Akkadian epic, is completely absent from the Sumerian tradition. “Gil-gamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld,” as we have seen, presents women only asindirect victims of Gilgamesh. Entirely absent in the Sumerian tradition is the por-tion of Akkadian epic that tells the early history of Enkidu, his initiation by theprostitute, and his meeting with Gilgamesh, where Enkidu blocks Gilgamesh fromexercising his droit de seigneur by engaging him in an athletic contest (wrestling),thus forging a close friendship with him.54 The turning point of the Akkadian epicoccurs in Tablet VI, when Gilgamesh viciously rejects Ishtar’s sexual advances, cat-aloguing her former lovers and the terrible fates she prepared for them. When Gil-gamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull of Heaven, loosed on Uruk by an angry Ishtar, andthen throw its severed leg at her, Enkidu is doomed to die, and his death becomesthe motor of the entire second half of the epic. In the Sumerian “Gilgamesh andthe Bull of Heaven,” Gilgamesh’s quarrel with Inana is quite different; sex, at leastin the parts that are preserved, is never an issue.55 The Akkadian Gilgamesh epic isabout growing up, as Jacobsen came to believe, but Gilgamesh’s friendship withEnkidu and his rejection of Ishtar were not part of a refusal to grow up, as Jacobsen53. Cf. Tigay, Evolution, 182–84. In Jacobsen’s later discussions of Gilgamesh, he followed anunfortunate suggestion of Landsberger that these passages refer to Gilgamesh’s own wedding (Trea-sures, 199 and 218; “Tragic Vision,” 237). Landsberger’s suggestion comes in a long article on virginityand sexual intercourse (“Jungfräulichkeit: Ein Beitrag zum Thema ‘Beilager und Eheschliessung,’ ” inDavid AV, 41–105) in which he rails against the idea of the jus primae noctis as an example of “ ‘por-nographische Tendenzen’ unter den Assyriologen” (81 n. 2 part c): “Dieses ‘Gemeingut der Assyriol-ogie’ wird insbesondere von W.

The entire paragraph reads:In Mesopotamia true enough paederasty was forbidden in the Assyrian laws, butthis does not mean that the same was the fact in Babylonia and in older times. Thekuluªu, the cinaedus, is often mentioned as associated with the Istar-cult, and inthe omen literature we have in any case one omen referring to paederasty whichis a lucky one: ‘If a man draws near to the anus of his comrade, that man will takethe leadership of his brethren and his family.’ This may reflect an older, popularview, which considered bisexualism a token of superior strength.57The evidence for Mesopotamian homoerotic practice is not as scanty as this para-graph might make it seem; the dossier compiled by J. Bottéro runs to nearly tenpages.58 Nevertheless, with the exception of Jacobsen’s kuluªu and similar culticfigures characterized by a variety of inversions, like the assinnu and kurgarrû, homo-sexuality seems to have been a pretty marginal affair in ancient Mesopotamia.59Since the cultic figures just mentioned have been treated at length recently,60 Iwould like to touch on the two other major sources of information on Mesopota-mian male homosexuality mentioned by Jacobsen: laws and omens.Of course, no one writing today would blithely use the word “pederasty” as asynonym for homosexuality.

Dover has discussed in great detail the specialGreek institution whereby a mature man would woo and become lover-mentor ofan adolescent boy; the latter would somewhat reluctantly allow his older lover sex-56. “The Craftsmanship of Sîn-leqi-unninni,” OLP 21 (1990): 64f. See the very interesting sug-gestion of Leick, Sex and Eroticism, 268, whereby Gilgamesh rejects Ishtar/Inana because “Gilgames’libido is as boundless as that of a woman; he identifies with Inanna’s insatiable appetite. . . . It wouldtherefore be illogical for him to seek a feminine counterpart; his real Other is Enkidu.” However, Iprefer the interpretation (if not always the mode of expression) of E. Neumann, The Origins and His-tory of Consciousness (Princeton, 1954): “The stronger the masculine ego consciousness becomes, themore it is aware of the emasculating, bewitching, deadly and stupefying nature of the Great Goddess”(p. 63). The mythological expression of the emergence of the male ego from the domination of theGreat Goddess, that is, from an adolescent-like sexual vulnerability, is found in male-friendship motifslike that of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, in which the close “relationship strengthens consciousness and in-vigorates the ego principle” (p. 181).57. “How Did Gilgames Oppress Uruk?,” 74.58.

TwoMiddle Assyrian laws discuss intercourse, certainly anal, between males.62 The first,MAL A 19,63 concerns a man who falsely says of his “comrade” (Akk. tappa’u), thatis, a fellow citizen, “they all fornicate with him.” The punishment includes beating,forced labor, and a fine. MAL A 20,64 the law referred to by Jacobsen, states thatif a man fornicates (as the active partner) with his “comrade,” again, a fellow citi-zen, that man shall be gang raped and castrated.Bottéro interpreted 19 as meaning that a man is accusing another citizen ofbeing a habitual passive homosexual, virtually a male prostitute; in 20, he sees thehomosexual rape of one citizen by another.65 Homosexuality itself is not beingcondemned. Lambert sees matters differently: In 20, it is consensual homosexualintercourse that is being condemned, since if rape was meant, the adverb emuqamma“by force” would have been added, as it was for heterosexual rape in 16. Thus, itis homosexual activity itself that is being proscribed, and 19 refers simply to anaccusation that another “is a persistant homosexual,”66 that is, that he engages inimmoral activity.The real meaning of these Middle Assyrian laws emerges from a study of theGreek attitude toward homosexual intercourse, as set forth by Dover.67 Crucialhere is the “specific offense called ‘hubris’ in Attic law . . . an offence against thecommunity as a whole,” whose penalty could be death. For an act of violence toqualify as “hubris” rather than simple assault, “it was necessary to persuade the jurythat it proceeded from a certain attitude and disposition on the part of the accused. . . to establish a dominant position over his victim.”68 Unwilling homosexual submission was held to be the product of dishonest entice-ment, threats, blackmail, the collaboration of accomplices, or some other meanswhich indicated premeditation . . . and automatically put the aggressor in dangerof indictment for hubris.69In addition, any citizen who prostituted himself, that is, willingly allowed anothercitizen to penetrate him in return for money or other favors, “was debarred from61.

Locher, Die Ehre einer Frau in Israel (OBO 70;Göttingen, 1986), 370.62. The word for intercourse is nâku, “to fornicate,” used only for sexual relations outside ofmarriage. 63. M.

Cooper84addressing the assembly, and from many other civic rights,” as was “any citizen whohad maltreated his parents, evaded military service, fled in battle.”70But the Greeks went one step further. Any citizen who willingly submitted toanal penetration was regarded as a prostitute, whether or not he received anythingin return:(I)n what circumstances does a male in fact submit to anal penetration by anothermale, and how does society regard his submission? . . . in Greek eyes the malewho breaks the ‘rules’ of legitimate eros detaches himself from the ranks of malecitizenry and classifies himself with women and foreigners; the [male] prostitute isassumed to have broken the rules simply because his economic dependence on cli-ents forces him to do what they want him to do; and conversely, any male believedto have done whatever his senior homosexual partner(s) wanted him to do is as-sumed to have prostituted himself.71Thus, whereas there was absolutely no stigma attached to active homosexual be-havior with male prostitutes or slaves, the anal penetration of a fellow citizen, if inany way unwanted, was a crime against the community and potentially a capital of-fense, while allowing oneself to be penetrated without duress was “to resign one’sown standing as a citizen.”72Although Greek civic institutions were very different from Assyrian ones, thegeneral attitude toward homosexual acts was similar, namely, that it is shameful tobe penetrated by another male, and it is a grave offense to penetrate a fellow citizen,thus shaming him. Whereas Lambert is correct that MAL A 19 does not refer toprostitution specifically, Bottéro is probably right to assume that any Assyrian citizenwho allowed himself to be penetrated with regularity was, like the Greek citizenwho behaved that way, considered to be a prostitute by his fellows. And MAL A 20means either that the victim was forced or constrained in some way to submit toanal penetration,73 or that using another citizen as a passive partner, whatever thecircumstances, was regarded as gravely offensive. Thus the Assyrian laws are not a“condemnation of homosexuality,”74 but neither can we say that a homosexual re-lationship with another citizen “n’a rien de plus blâmable ou déshonorant quel’amour hétérosexuel.”75 Male citizens, as well as their wives and daughters, werenot to be the object of sexual penetration. There was no free love in ancient Me-sopotamia; a free male’s sexual opportunities were limited to his wife, his slaves, and70.

As in ancient Greece, the slaves and prostitutes could be male or fe-male,76 and a “normal” Assyrian may well have frequented both.77The omen cited by Jacobsen should be interpreted in this spirit. The reasonthat a man who anally penetrates “his equal,” that is, sexually shames a fellow citi-zen, “will take the lead” among his brothers and kin is not because his deed haswon their approval; to the contrary, no one wants to stand in front of him and riskbeing his next victim!It is a measure of the enormous change in attitudes toward human sexualitythat the notion of an erotic relationship between Enkidu and Gilgamesh could haveseemed “strange and grotesque” in 193078 but now seems perfectly acceptable ifthe philology supports it.

My own hand copy of the inscription was published in the samearticle, but the small format of the journal meant that the copy was reduced in size,and this rendered the signs difficult to read; moreover, several signs failed to beprinted in col. vii.As Sjöberg had worked from the cylinder itself, the hand copy represented anentirely independent reading of the cylinder.

Jacobsen later sentme his own transliteration, translation, and commentary on the text.

Oyou Inanna, queen—from days of yore, paladin, hero, soldier!’ ” Jacobsen’s res-toration assumes a repetition in the opening lines, a pattern which he elsewherereferred to as a “particularizing stanza” (see T. Jacobsen, Toward the Image ofTammuz and Other Essays on Mesopotamian History and Culture, ed. W. L. Moran[Cambridge, Mass., 1970], 335), in which a person or thing is referred to firstin general terms, and then by name. In order to restore the lines Jacobsen notedthat the signs in line 2 following -]li-a-ta were reduced in size, in order to fitthe space. Jacobsen’s restoration of ul-li-a-ta is convincing, but gàr-du (in-terpreted as an Akk. loanword) is less so, although not to be excluded."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Free Library Inanna Prism Reconsidered932 The epithet sul mes gi4-gi4 most likely refers to Inanna. Although techni-cally masculine, it may in fact reflect Inanna’s bellicose nature and her associa-tions with war and the battlefield. In Nin-me-sár-ra 17, for instance,Inanna is referred to as kur-gul-gul, “destroyer of lands”; see also ibid., 26:igi-mè-ta níg ma-ra-ta-si-ig, “everything is struck down by you in theface of battle.” Similarly, the Akkadian hymns to Istar collected by B. Grone-berg repeat similar themes, referring to the goddess in her “manliness”(zikrutu), (Agusaya Hymn—see Groneberg, Lob der Istar, 75 ii 2), as well as“heroism” (e†lutu), and she is called a “hero” (quradu, ibid., 76 iii 4, and see thediscussion pp. 66f.), which is characteristic of Agushaya. Masculine epithets,however, would not necessarily imply hermaphrodite characteristics, althoughfor another view, cf. B. Groneberg, “Die sumerisch/akkadische Inanna/Istar:Hermaphroditos?,” WdO 17 (1987): 25–46, and idem, Lob der Istar, xvi–xix. 3 The reading of this line is a variation of Jacobsen’s suggested restoration of theend of the line as “[su-dagal] du11-ga an-[na-ke4], ‘amply provided for byAn.’ ” For the form and attestations of mí-du11-ga, see P. Attinger, Elémentsde linguistique sumerienne: La construction de du11/e/di “dire” (Göttingen, 1993),603–18, although Sjöberg, JCS 40, 169, translates the line as “through(?) thecommand of An.”The restoration é-d[u6-kù-g]a is hypothetical, based upon a shrine ofEnlil by this name in Nippur, although a du6-kù was also known from Eriduand elsewhere; see A. George, House Most High: The Temples of Ancient Mesopo-tamia (Mesopotamian Civilizations 5; Winona Lake, Ind., 1993), 77. 4 The grammar of the verbal form gál-la-e is a crux. Sjöberg, JCS 40, 165 n. 2,analysed this form and similar forms in this cylinder as third-person suffixes,synonymous with -/ni/ or né/na, e.g., lá-a-e (lines 7 and 16), gar-ra-e(line 9), ku5-da-e (line 10), bad-da-e (11), du11-du11-ga-e (15), basedupon parallels in Gudea Cyl. A. Jacobsen, however, interprets the verbal formas a vocative addressing the goddess: “O you, having An’s holy turban placedon the head.” He writes:For the construction, see Poebel SG ¶ 714. The /e/ of an-[na-ke4] is thevocative -e, for which see Exaltation of Istar l. 3, a-a dìm-me-er-e-ne-ke4 [RA XI (1914) 144–45], cf. also the late version of the myth Lugal-e[IV R2 9 obv. 5], an-gal-e // da-num rabûu, and Sjöberg, Mondgott, 50.Note that the vocative -e follows a passive participle in -a here and through-out the section from line 2 to line 15.We prefer to see these forms as representing the subordinating pronominalconjugation consisting of the verbal base + a (+ak) + postposition, cf. Attinger,Eléments, 303f., and note that a similar form is cited by M.-L. Thomsen, TheSumerian Language (Copenhagen, 1984), 93, first mentioned in J. Krecher,“Zur sumerischen Grammatik. 1. Isolierende Postpositionen. 2. -(e)n nachVerbalwurzeln,” ZA 57 (1965): 28–29. The grammar follows a distinct pattern"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"M. J. Geller94in lines 4–6 and lines 7–10: Clauses with passive participles ending in final -eare followed by a clause having a passive participle ending in -bi. All of theseclauses are subordinate. Although Sjöberg, JCS 40, 170 n. 6, rejects the reading me-en in favourof àga, nevertheless the reading of the signs as me-en looks more convincing. One could translate this line and the following with Sjöberg, “the holycrown of An has been placed upon (her) head, the holy ba-garment has beendonned upon (her) body” (JCS 40, 169). There appears to be, however, an in-tentional distinction between these two lines and l. 6, in which the sceptre ofAn is specifically placed “in her hand” (su-na). The subtle distinction suggeststhat it is not Inanna who is being dressed, but a cult statue; hence in lines 4–5the description is of the head and torso of the statue being adorned with deco-rative items, after which the statue in lines 6ff. is recognisably an image ofInanna.5 Jacobsen suggests that the doubling of kù probably indicates a plural form ofthe noun, as in Reisner, SBH, 78, 33–34: túg gal-gal-la (cited CAD L, 17).Sjöberg reads túg-ba, which he translates as a “ba-garment,” although such agarment is not attested, and the sign appears to be too small for túg. Our read-ing is based upon B. Alster, “Sumerian Love Songs,” RA 79 (1985): 136:28–29: túg gisba-an-gim su du-ma-ni túg gisba-sì-ki-na-gim su dar-dar-ma-ni, “put (your) hand onto a garment as with an awl(?), spread(?) thegarment with (your) hand as with a spatula(?)” (translation Alster). The trans-lations “awl” and “spatula” assume that the words are tools, an assumptionbased upon poorly attested Akkadian equivalents (see Alster’s note: ibid., 138,and PSD B, 1, and differently 82); in the love song context both the gisba(-an)and gisba-sì-ki-na might represent decorative items. See now Y. Sefati, LoveSongs in Sumerian Literature (Ramat Gan, 1998), 358. These implements may becomparable to the ritual objects carried by the male and female priests in theIstar-Louvre hymn, in which the man carries female implements (such as a hairclasp) while the woman carries male objects (e.g., a throwstick, a sling, andslingstone); see Groneberg, Lob der Istar, 17 and 27. 6 Jacobsen comments: “the -bi at the end of line 6 is adverbial and indicates cir-cumstance: with such and such going on / being the case. See Poebel π703.” 7 See Inninsagurra 59: mah-di [un]ken-[n]a zà-gal ba-e-dúr-ru, “theexalted in the assembly, sitting on the seat of honour” (translation Sjöberg).Sjöberg here reads mah-a tus-[a dúr]-gar-ra-e, although there does notappear to be enough space in the gap for two signs, [a] and [dúr]. Jacobsen’sreading differs considerably:mah-a lu-[úb]-gar-ra-e, “(you) are equipped with knapsack.” The kuslu-úb is a part of standard military equipment as may be seen from ki kuslu-úb-gar, “place where the knapsack is put on,” which develops the meaning“army,” since that is where the troops gather before a campaign. The wholesection to and including line 9 deals with Inanna as a warrior."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Free Library Inanna Prism Reconsidered958 It seems likely here that “kur” is a metaphor for the temple, in the same waythat Akk. sadû is used metaphorically, see CAD S/1, 57b. Jacobsen commentsthat “the comparison is with passages like those cited by Gelb in MAD 3 105,ì-nu DN di.kud-su i-ti-nu-ma. Battles were seen as lawsuits judged by Enlil orother gods, in favour of the victor.”9 Jacobsen reads: “ga-es8 mah kur-kur-ra bé-da-e, ‘O you, merchantprince gone far away into all lands!’ ”10 Jacobsen translates and comments: “ ‘O you that in your lighting up in the skylike a lamp, as (you) Inanna are seen in splendour.’ For this epithet, note its usewith Enlil (CT 15, pl. 10), . . . since the text is a lament, not a hymn to Enlil’spowers; he is the banker calling to account.” See also the comments on the lat-ter text by M. Civil, JCS 28 (1976): 72f.11–14 Jacobsen admits here that “syntactically this section is difficult, since thereis no clear noun for the vocative to refer to.”14 The line may well be a literary allusion to the temple epithet kur hé-gal-lafound in temple hymns, see Sjöberg, TCS 3, 19: 42, and p. 59, and commonlyemployed as an epithet for several temples, cf. Falkenstein, SGL, I 50. 15 Syntactically one expects this broken line to present (finally) the main clause ofthe context, following upon the previous series of subordinate clauses endingin -e or -bi.16 One might compare here Inninsagurra 206: es-bar ab-bé bí-in-du11-ga-z[u] an-ki-ta nu-kúr-ru, “when you have spoken your judgement in thewindow, it is unchangeable on heaven and earth.” An alternative reading mightbe bùlug/dim4 for the signs read here as kúr-kúr, although the context istoo damaged to decide the reading.17 Jacobsen notes that “after these lines begin Inanna’s self-praise,” and thus inter-prets the verbal suffix -me as first person singular. Sjöberg also translates subse-quent lines in columns ii and iii as first person, assuming these lines to bespoken by Inanna herself, and Sjöberg (JCS 40, 165) regards this use of me for/me-en/ as evidence that the prism was written in the Ur III or early Isin pe-riod. The first person orientation is supported by the unambiguous -mu suffixin lines ii. 8–9: ti-la-mu-dè, “while I lived . . . ,” and iii 3: sà-mu hi-ligi4-im-si, “let me fill my heart with joy” (see also iii 5); these passages appearto be Inanna’s own words. Another argument in favour of interpreting theselines in the first person is the Emesal term gasan in line 17 (if read correctly),since one might expect Emesal dialect to be spoken by Inanna herself.The arguments against a first person monologue in lines ending with -meare both grammatical and contextual. This verbal form with a second personsuffix pronoun is paralleled by Gudea Cyl. A iii 3: nin ama lagaski gar-ra-me(-en) (see Thomsen, Grammar, 267 ex. 782), “you are the lady, the motherby whom Lagash was founded,” to be distinguished from the alternative for-mulation, gar-ra-zu-dè (the so-called pronominal conjugation), whichwould have had a slightly different nuance, i.e., “you having founded.”"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"M. J. Geller96Inanna is also referred to throughout the prism in the third person, whichwould not fit well with statements of self-praise; it is unlikely that Inannawould praise herself and then refer to herself in the third person (see lines 2–15, 18; ii 18–22; iii 8–10). Interpreting the statements ending with -me as asecond person address to Inanna, enumerating her virtues, would be consistentwith the view that this prism is a votive object meant to praise Inanna. Theusual form of hymns of praise describes Inanna’s attributes and ends with a re-frain: dinanna za-a-kam // ku-um-ma dis-dar, which is typical of Akk. hymnsto Istar as well; see S. Sjöberg, “Inninsagurra,” ZA 65, 161–253, passim, andB. Groneberg, Lob der Istar, 22–26. It is possible that the relevant lines in ourprism which would have had this refrain are missing in the large breaks. There appears to be an erasure before the second /du8/ sign. 20 Jacobsen suggests provisionally restoring the line as “a-gi6-[gi4-i]m [d]u7-ªdu7º-me, ‘I am one levelling like a floodwave,’ ” based upon the parallel ex-pression du7-du7 // sapanu, said of floodwaves, cf. CAD A/1 s.v. agû.col. ii1 The assumption here is that this line is a continuation of the final line of col. i(line 22), with the key phrase being su . . . zi-ga, “raising the hand” (in prayer). 2 Jacobsen translates: “I am the glassy girin stone from the mountains, set up tobe admired,” although he notes that “shiny” may be preferable to “glassy.” 3 Jacobsen’s translation, “Hung with glassy lapis lazuli from the mountain crestand ‘nests’ of igi-sanga,” is based upon kur-mus as polysemy for kur-mùs,which is doubted by Sjöberg in his notes on this text (JCS 40, 172). Jacobsen’sobservation, however, is worth considering: “mùs, ‘crest’, fits all recurrences asan emblem of the en, as the temple’s place on platforms, as the top of moun-tains. The combination kur-mùs is Poebel’s ‘partitive apposition.’ ”For Jacobsen’s translation “igi-sanga,” see Sjöberg, JCS 40, 173 n. 7. Ja-cobsen further comments on the reading giusub, which comes from Proto-Diri 405 (cf. CAD A/1, 110, s.v. adattu). According to Jacobsen, Proto-Diricompletely misunderstands the meaning of the word: gidiri(si.a) “reed float,”“raft,” “bird’s nest in the marshes”; the latter meaning was then used for“nests” of minerals. Note also gisusub as a “nest” for a brick.5 Sjöberg (JCS 40, 168) read a broken sign before gál which I did not see on theoriginal. 6 Jacobsen suggested reading: “ªgestinº-pa-ba al-e-a-a-me, ‘I am thegrapes desirable on their vine,’ ” agreeing with Sjöberg’s suggested reading pa-ba “on their branches” (JCS 40, 174). Neither reading is convincing. One ex-pects in the context some type of agricultural activity, which is why the phrasehere might possibly be related to the term káb-du11-ga, discussed in greatdetail by M. Civil, The Farmer’s Instructions (Barcelona, 1994), 153–63; accord-ing to Civil, the verb indicates the taking of some type of measurement. 7 Jacobsen translates: “I am the dates in their panicles laden with allure.”Spread is 18 points long"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Free Library Inanna Prism Reconsidered978 Jacobsen reads dag-bàra-ga, since “a plural dag-dag does not make senseto me especially since the next line has dag only.” There is a shift in lines 8–11 to first person verbal forms. These forms are interpreted as a mark of a directspeech of Inanna, describing her wedding with Dumuzi. The syntax shifts tofirst person verbal forms again in col. iii 3–5, which may also intend to giveInanna’s own description of being wed to Dumuzi. These lines could be a lit-erary allusion to an Inanna-Dumuzi hymn as a counterbalance to the praisesaddressed to Inanna elsewhere in this text (see above, note to line 17). 11 Jacobsen comments: The form in-gá?-an-pà-da-dè is a bit of a poser. The infix n-ga- is ev-erywhere else written with g rather than F. Its meaning “also” likewise mayindicate that Inanna too was selecting Dumuzi as her preferred suitor. As forthe stem I suppose that vowel assimilation (cf. Poebel SG ¶ 728) caused achange from /pad-ed-e/. This should make the form indicate imperfec-tive/duration before an event, “he was in the process of selecting.” Cf. Jacob-sen, AS 16 98f. See also Sjöberg, JCS 40, 175 n. 11.13 The narration again shifts to third person verbal forms, reporting on Inanna’sactivities for much of the remainder of the legible text.18 Sjöberg (JCS 40, 175 n. 17) suggests reading the verbal form here as bí-in-ga-ga, meaning “to carry away (as booty),” cf. Akk. salâlu (CAD S/1, 196f.).For á-zi-ga, cf. SGL I 36f., 134.20 The sign for ukkin resembles the same sign used above in i 7, and althoughmah is also possible, it is not easy to see how the phrase mah-a-ni would fitthe context. It is tempting to read usumgal here, as in the following line,while Jacobsen read guru7 nun-na, “Granary of the Prince,” although nei-ther solution appears convincing. 21 Jacobsen reads: ses-a-ni Usumgal-e ªna-e11º(?). The signs comprising thename usumgal are reasonably clear, but one does not expect a sign betweenusumgal and the second part of the name, an-na. One might read suffix-dam here, instead of the -ra postposition, representing a comitative -da plusthe enclitic copula, although this would not harmonise well with the infix -naof the verbal form in line 22. The simile here, if the damaged signs are cor-rectly read, suggests that Inanna carried off something to her shrine just like shehad Dumuzi carried away. 22 The verb is read by Sjöberg (JCS 40, 175) as mu-na-biz-biz, although thetraces look more like ga than bi. Cf. above, line 18.col. iii3 Sjöberg (JCS 40, 176) explained gi4 as a cohortative preformative, which hasbeen adopted here, although Jacobsen preferred to read gi4-im as phonetic for/gim/, translating, “my heart filling with the likes of desire.”4 Jacobsen prefers reading túg -[mu4], and consequently translates “would[clothe(?)] Ululu in Dusuba.” For Ululu as an epithet of Dumuzi, cf. Sjöberg,JCS 40, 176."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"M. J. Geller987 Since the ta-sign appears to be long, one might see an intervening suffix pro-noun before the -ta. Jacobsen translates: “My . . . heart after he let the day slipby.”8 Instead of se-ga, one might also read ªur5º?-g[im?], “in this way,” althoughthe verbal form remains untranslatable. Jacobsen understands the line differ-ently, as uru12-ùn(bàd) ur5-d[a] mu-si-gu-ú-gu-ú, “(Inanna) will on thehigh roof become enraged at him,” interpreting ur5 as equivalent to Akk. lib-batu, “anger”; see Erimhus V 176 [= MSL 17 74], ur5-gukaxne = lib-ba-a-tum(cited CAD L, 163). Jacobsen’s translation fits the context nicely, although onemust assume a phonetic writing related to the noun /murgu/ “anger.” 9 The correspondence between /su-dub/ and †epû is only attested lexically (seeAHw 1388), but the meaning fits the context and contrasts nicely with /tur-tur/ of the following sentence.

Geller I This essay will explore the view of the relationship between nature and pietyin a group of psalms reflecting the biblical wisdom tradition at a time of particularcrisis. Understanding that crisis means comprehending the special role of nature inthe wisdom tradition. To be sure, the dominant authority mentioned in wisdomtexts is tradition, passed on by elders to the young. But tradition itself was based ul-timately on experience, not just of human relations in society, but also of the natu-ral world. Already Solomon, the archetypal biblical wise man, spoke parables about“trees, from the cedars that are in Lebanon to the hyssop that emerges from walls. . . about beasts, fowl, creeping things and fishes” (1 Kgs. 5:13). Of course, whatis meant here by “nature” is not the modern, or even Greek, understanding of thatterm as a systematic and comprehensive order of all things that can be apprehendedand penetrated by the human intellect. Rather, in the Bible “nature” is conceivedof theistically, as creation by God. There is a Hebrew verb for “create” ( b a r a ª ) butno term for “nature,” or even “world, universe,” unless it be the hendiadys “heavenand earth.” However, if one limits the range of the term “nature” to something like“the way things work, the ordering of things by God in a manner that humans canunderstand by observation,” then the semantic range of “nature” is covered, in avery general way, by the Hebrew term derek , “way, manner of acting.” In this sensenature is a key factor in wisdom books like Proverbs, which deals with proper hu-man behavior, as well as in books like Job, in which physical nature, from the heav-enly bodies to the realm of the great beasts, plays a crucial role. Although imagesdrawn from nature occur also in other biblical traditions, 1 it is primarily in the wis-dom tradition that the link between natural and moral orders, between the physical 1. In the covenant tradition, nature, especially as an appeal to “heaven and earth,” appears as awitness to the covenant and agent of divine punishment for breach of covenant; cf. Lev 26; Deuter-onomy 28, 32; Isa 1:2; Mic 6:1–2, etc. In addition, the prophets sometimes make use of natural evi-dence or imagery; cf. Amos 4:13; 5:8; Isa 1:3–4; Jer 8:7, etc. Only in Deutero-Isaiah do creationthemes play a central role: Isa 40:12–14; 21–26; 42:5; 44:24; 45:18, etc. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" Stephen A. Geller 102 world and the human realms of society and of personal piety, is of central concern.Simply put, wisdom is really interested in the world, almost, it seems at times, forits own sake, not just as evidence of the greatness of the creator. However, closerexamination of context usually shows that this interest in nature is actually part ofa particular pattern of argumentation about the character and function of piety.Behind the role assigned the natural world there seems to lie a nascent wisdomtheology 2 that was common to the international wisdom tradition in the ancientNear East. The order of creation, referred to in Egypt as “truth” ( maªat ), in Meso-potamia as “right” ( m es arum ) and in Israel by such terms as “justice” ( ß edeq ) and“truth, stability” ( ª é met ), manifested itself in the essential unity of natural and moralrealms, including the working of the state and the legal system. Creation formed aseamless whole, constantly menaced by the chastised but still lurking forces of chaosthat manifested themselves as disorder, societal upheaval, natural disasters likeplagues, droughts and famines, and, not least, the disruptive power of sin. The pur-pose of state and cult was to maintain the stability of created “justice,” not just bylaws and good administration but also by providing for the needs of the gods in thesacrificial cult, undoing the negative effects of sin, and passing down the correctdoctrines to the young. The latter was the function of the wisdom tradition.Israel shared this set of beliefs and assumptions, especially in its form of the wis-dom tradition, which we may term Old Wisdom. It was always the least particu-larly Israelite and most international sphere of Israelite culture. But in the Eighthand Seventh Centuries b.c.e. a new form of Israel’s ancient covenant traditions de-veloped, probably under prophetic influence. 3 This new form, the DeuteronomicMovement, culminated in the great reform of Josiah in 621 b.c.e. It was a radicaland uncompromising expression of absolute monotheism and cultic centralization:one God, one shrine. It demanded total devotion—in love—to God and rejectionof all foreign gods and ideas. It attacked Old Wisdom and replaced it by a NewWisdom, which focused on Torah. Teaching, the role of master and pupil, wasstressed by Deuteronomic religion. This was the beginning of that emphasis onstudy that characterized later rabbinic Judaism. But the only right thoughts werethose that centered on God’s revelation. Nature had no role, except as witness toGod’s power of creation and, negatively, as an inciter to idolatry. Raising one’s eyesto the sun, moon and stars was itself dangerous, lest one’s thoughts be led astray bythem. For correct thought was essential to what one might call the New Piety ofthe Deuteronomic movement. Its ultimate appeal was to the mind of each individ-ual man and woman. Both individualism and a (relative) upgrading of the status ofwomen were important aspects of deuteronomic theology and law. 2. See Roland Murphy, The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature (Grand Rap-ids, Mich., 1990), chap. 8. The role of nature in wisdom thinking is debated. See especially James L.Crenshaw, Urgent Advice and Probing Questions: Collected Writings on Old Testament Wisdom (Macon,Georgia, 1995), especially chap. 20.3. See my Sacred Enigmas: Literary Religion in the Hebrew Bible (London and New York, 1996),chap. 9."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms 103Old Wisdom was challenged by this new, militant theology. The response wasvaried. Some wisdom teachers accommodated themselves and, abandoning natureand excluding everything foreign, bent themselves to the study of revelation andTorah. Psalm 119 is a document of this kind of reaction. Some remained stubbornlyaloof, continuing to be faithful to the nature- and experience-rooted traditions ofOld Wisdom with little or no reference to Israel’s covenant faith. Ecclesiastes is thelatest, and purest, expression of this stubbornly unreconstructed reaction. But mostwisdom teaching seems to reflect varying types of intermediate reactions, blendingthe new ideas of covenant religion with the tenets of Old Wisdom. Much of thefirst chapters of Proverbs (“the fear of the Lord is the beginning”—but not theend—“of wisdom”) and many so-called “wisdom psalms” like Psalm 37 reflectsuch intermediate positions. What might be termed a hybrid wisdom-covenantalpiety developed that usually avoided overt reference to covenant and spoke, as OldWisdom did, in seemingly universal terms of nature, man, and God, and expresseda rather rigidly mechanistic cause-effect theology. This is the kind of faith that seemsto be espoused in the Book of Job by the friends who came to comfort Job. Theauthor of that work seems to attempt to remain closer to the nature-centredness ofOld Wisdom and to present the emotion of awe at the sublimity of creation as an“answer” to the problem of suffering. 4 The magnificent divine speeches describing the works of creation in chapters38–39 of Job are the most grandiose and ambitious treatment of the role of naturein the literature of the Hebrew Bible influenced by the wisdom tradition, but it isnot the only one. There is a small group of psalms in which, as in the Book of Job,nature, i.e., creation, plays a major role. 5 They reveal an underlying dynamic andtension that might elude the interpreter unaware of the religous and intellectual cri-sis of their time. Reference here is to Psalms 104, 8, 19, and 139. Unlike Job, noneof them deals explicitly with the issue of suffering or theodicy; but each does havea reference to sin and sinners that points to the collocation of nature and piety char-acteristic of the wisdom tradition. 6 Each psalm reflects, in varying degrees, the crisisof the Seventh–Fifth Centuries b.c.e. and differing reactions of wise men to theirnew situation. It is as documents of their time that we shall now examine them. 4. See my Sacred Enigmas , chap. 5, and my forthcoming essay, “Nature’s Answer: the Meaningof the Book of Job in Its Intellectual Context.” 5. This essay does not intend to present a comprehensive treatment of the role of nature in theHebrew Bible, or even in the wisdom tradition. There will be no discussion of Qoheleth, a work thatreflects substantially later viewpoints, or even of an important passage like Proverbs 8, which presentsa semi-mythological view of wisdom as preexistent at creation.6. However, these psalms will not be labeled “wisdom psalms,” a term about which there is con-siderable debate; see A. Hurvitz, Wisdom Language in Biblical Psalmody ( Jerusalem, 1991; Hebrew). Ofthe four psalms studied in this essay (8, 19, 104, and 139), only Psalm 19 is viewed as a “wisdom psalm”by the majority of scholars in the synthetic chart Hurvitz gives on p. 128. The wide disagreementamong scholars testifies to the lack of objective criteria for determining what a “wisdom psalm” reallyis. Here, the psalms in question will be viewed as literary creations that contain evidence, in languagebut also in themes and ideas, of having been composed by poets influenced by the wisdom tradition."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" Stephen A. Geller 104First, something must be said of the approach taken here to these psalms,which may loosely be termed “literary.” The notion of “literature” has been madeto bear an enormous burden of theoretical discussion in modern times. Here “lit-erary” signals only an approach that is sensitive to language, nuance, allusion, and,especially, context. Much study of the biblical psalms contents itself with identify-ing the putative literary genre and Sitz im Leben . Psalms may be categorized ashymns, petitions of the individual, songs of thanksgiving, royal psalms, wisdompsalms, etc. All except the last mentioned are associated with cultic occasions in thelife of ancient Israel, often with the most sparse evidence. Little attention is oftenpaid to literary and broader cultural context. But, in fact, relatively few psalms are“pure” in terms of genre. Most contain evidence of two or even more literaryforms, each with its own train of associations. Why does a supposedly cultic psalmcall on wisdom imagery? Why does a wisdom psalm use cultic terminology? Whatdoes reference to kingship mean in decidedly non-royal contexts? These are thesorts of questions a nuanced interpretation, a truly literary approach, must attemptto answer. It is also necessary to understand, as the Rabbis did, that the Bible, likeall ancient texts, often creates meaning by the simple juxtaposition of topics. Thus,a text that seems to a source critic to be a jumble of fragments, and to a form critican incoherent mixture of genres, may actually bear a meaning that depends pre-cisely on the kind of texture of subtle allusions and associations that scholars tendto hate but poets, alas, love. In the final analysis, a literary approach means nothingmore than giving a psalm its due as poetry. II Of the four texts to be considered, the one closest to traditional Old Wisdomis Psalm 104, the great creation hymn of the Psalter. Its general similarity to thefamous Aten Hymn of the Akhenaten heresy in Egypt (and other henotheistichymns of the ancient world) points both to the continuity of such traditions in theancient Near East, and to the remarkable internationalism of Old Wisdom. Theentire poem is a majestic hymn in praise of God as creator, the longest sequence ofnature poetry in the Bible outside of Job 38–41 and, in a different vein, the Songof Songs. But at the very end a seemingly discordant note enters: “May sinnerscease from the earth // and the wicked be no more” (v. 35). There is no reason toregard this verse as intrusive. Given the association of nature and piety in the wis-dom tradition as essential aspects of created order, it is appropriate and necessarythat allusion be made here to sin and sinners, the one feature of the world that dis-turbs the perfection of God’s work. 7 It is, in fact, an aspect of the chaos that pre-ceded the ordering of creation and which, as cosmic ocean, but also as evil and sin, 7. Among other collocations of creation and piety are Psalm 19, to be discussed below, Prov.3:3–18 and 19–20, etc."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms 105 continues to threaten the order of the cosmos, as Jon Levenson has so forcefullyargued. 8 Or is this the case? An interesting question is the grammatical mood of v. 35:is it jussive or indicative? Is the psalmist praying “may sinners cease from the earth!”(as translated above); 9 or is he stating his assurance that such will be the case: “Sin-ners will cease from the earth . . .”? In the latter case the mention of evildoers doesnot really detract from the hymnic tone of the psalm. The poet is simply registeringthe presence of evil in God’s creation at the same time that he expresses his cer-tainty that someday it will be removed, thus perfecting the world. The former in-terpretation is more dynamic in that it implies a more emotional response, indeed,a questioning of the order of God’s work of creation due to the continued presenceof sin. 10 Since the Hebrew allows both interpretations, this uncertainty must be viewedas a literarily meaningful ambiguity, i.e., not either/or but both/and. The Psalmistis perplexed and confident simultaneously. He is awed and enraptured by the con-templation of creation but cannot forbear to mention that he is also aware of—andperhaps disturbed by—the blemish of sin and the threat it poses to divine order andrule. Despite this underlying uncertainty, the tone of Psalm 104 is exultant. It isone of the grandest works of the international Old Wisdom with its dominant fo-cus on nature-creation. III Psalm 8 also expresses awe at creation, and also refers to sinners, but introducesa new focus: humanity. The poem is, for all its brevity, or because of it, very com-plex in its imagery and web of allusions. For this reason a brief exegesis of thewhole psalm will be presented before we examine the specific relationship betweennature and sinfullness in it. 11 Psalm 8 makes use of traditional themes but with striking new emphases, whichare often signaled by clever use of ambiguity and juxtaposition. The first line, v. 2,expresses wonder at the “awesomeness” of God’s name in all the earth, whose“majesty” is placed on the heavens. 12 The language, rich in biblical associations, 8. J. D. Levenson, Creation and the Persistence of Evil : The Jewish Drama of Divine Omnipotence (New York, 1987).9. And continuing the mood of the preceding verbs.10.

An emendation of ª ås er t é nâ to ª as îrâ-n a ª isnot necessary. Hymnic style favors strings of participles describing God’s attributes. Expected herewould be hann o t e n hôdô . However, the poet wanted to stress the agency of God’s praise, as comingfrom a most unusual, indeed, astonishing source: babbling infants. The result is a somewhat twistedsyntax, but one that reinforces the uniqueness of the idea to be expressed. The relative marker ª ås er"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Stephen A. Geller 106indicates the common theme of divine exaltation, in which God’s “name” or“fame” is lauded by the assembled choirs of angels (Ps 29:1–2, 89:6–7; Isaiah 6,etc.). This praise is often in a creation context or, at least, in association with crea-tion motifs, especially the divine battle against the cosmic waters.How surprising, in such a context of praise, are the first three words of v. 3:God’s majesty is proclaimed “by the mouth of infants and sucklings!” So peculiaris this idea that tradition preferred to join these words to the following ones (hencethe verse division), but the context clearly points to a link with the preceding line,as many commentators have noted. The reference to infants is therefore a Januselement, but an ironic, even paradoxical, one. What could be more peculiar thanthe notion that the praise of God should come not from angelic choirs but nurseriesof babies, from those who cannot produce coherent speech?! 13 The other direction of the Janus expression “by the mouth of infants and suck-lings,” its connection to what follows in v. 3, is equally strange. The statement thatGod has “chastised 14 with might 15 on account 16 of (His) foes, to make the enemyand revengeful cease” would normally, in the context of heavenly praise, be takenas a reference to the cosmic battle motif that frequently accompanies creation im-agery in the Hebrew Bible. As such, one therefore expects the “foes” to be theusual watery opponent of God in the well-known creation myth, namely, Sea,River, Leviathan, etc. 17 But after the preceding reference to the “mouth of infantsand sucklings,” which is grammatically, at least, a Janus element, the image becomesmost peculiar, indeed. The stock motif in passages dealing with the theme of Godthe warrior is that He shatters His foes with His gigantic, thundering voice. That 13. Are we dealing here with an early form of the idea that God’s praise is sung by infant putti ?Cf. the rabbinic identification of cherubim with infants ( ke-rabyaª ). Also worth playing with is thepossibility that the imagery of Psalm 8 might be influenced by the common “cippi of Horus,” stele-like amulets that portray the child Horus treading on crocodiles or other reptiles, and holding wildbeasts.14. Reading, with many, yissart a , “you rebuke, instruct,” rather than MT’s yissadt a , “you lay thefoundations.” The latter makes sense in the context of creation, since the “foundations of the earth”is a stock theme, and the thought that these foundations should be “mighty” ( º o z ) is an equally stan-dard image. But after the reference to the “mouth of infants and sucklings” a verb of speech seemsappropriate. Does the poet perhaps intend a pun on yissar/dt a ?15. Or “instructed with praise”—also a sense of º o z (cf. Ps. 29:1: h a bû lyhwh k a bôd w a º o z , “Givethe Lord glory and might”).16. Cf. Ps. 5:9, l é maºan s ôr é r a y . Or, does l é maºan perhaps have here some of its literal sense of“answer, respond to,” continuing the verbal imagery, and an image of power that goes nicely with º o z ?17. Ps. 89:10–11; Ps. 74:13–14; Isa. 27:1, etc. plus verb takes the place of the definite article plus participle. To be sure, nitt a n is expected instead of t é nâ , which, as it stands, can only be a variant of the usual infinitive construct of n a tan , t e t (like r é dâ for redet , Gen. 46:3). The literal translation is “(You) the placing of whose majesty is from the mouthof infants and sucklings.” “Placing” or “giving” majesty or other attributes is a synonym of “praise,”as in Ps. 29:1–2. Note also ºal ha ssa mayim k é bôdô (Ps. 113:4).

In covenant religion, observation of the heavens leads onlyto idolatry, worship of the sun, moon, and stars (Deut. 4). But v. 4 consists only ofthe protasis of a temporal clause; there is no “then” to complete the “when.” It is,in fact, an anacoluthon, breaking off in favor of a cry of wonder that returns to thepattern of v. 2 and is clearly intended to contrast with it: the awesomeness of God’s“name,” on the one hand, and, on the other, the insignificance of weak mankind(ªénôs). Yet this weak creature has been made “little less than divine, crowned withglory and majesty!” The words evoke royal language openly. Once again, a standardtheme is reinterpreted by the poet. Traditionally, creation and divine combat arepart of a complex that celebrates God as king, and which in the Bible is found mostopenly in “enthronement psalms” like 93. Here, the royal majesty of the divineking, won at creation in battle with the cosmic foe, is transferred to humanity. Itsfeet are “set over everything, all sheep and oxen, also the beasts of the wild, birdsof the heavens and fish of the seas, who traverse the sea paths.” The final emphasison the watery realm perhaps evokes the defeated cosmic enemy of tradition, Sea.It is likely that an Israelite would have recognized here a twist on the languagetraditionally used to hymn the relationship between God and the Davidic king. InPsalm 89 it is even said that God places the king’s hand over the sea, an idea notdissimilar to that of Psalm 8.18 In the latter, the royal reference is not to the Davidicmessiah, but to humanity as a whole. Thus, the wisdom tradition has appropriatedand reinterpreted a traditional idea. That God’s majesty is shared by kings is hack-neyed; but that humanity is royal, though paradoxically also weak, is a strikinglynew notion, one shared, to my knowledge, only by the Priestly account of human-ity’s creation in Genesis 1, a passage clearly similar in key respects to Psalm 8.19The final line of the poem, v. 10, repeats the opening line, v. 2a. But a newsense emerges. What, in fact, is God’s “name” over all the earth that is referred tohere? If the heavens are the truly divine realm, is not the earth itself placed underhuman sway by God Himself? Is not God’s “name” placed on mankind itself, byreason of human semi-divinity? Is not mankind itself an aspect of God’s “name” onthe earth? This nuance stems from the royal language of the psalm. The king was18. Even the motif of royal sway over animals is perhaps not irrelevant; cf. Jer 27:6; 28:14. Is themessianic imagery of Isaiah 11 related to this complex of themes?19. But it also may lie behind the prospecting and mining imagery of Job 28, in which these hu-man activities, symbolic of the search for hidden wisdom, are described in terms usually reserved forGod.

Geller108viewed as God’s adopted son, and could, in this sense, be termed God’s name inthe sense of “posterity”; although, admittedly, there is no biblical reference to theking as the “name of God” explicitly. But God promised David He would give hima “name like the name of the great ones of the earth” (2 Sam 7:9). Here “name”means, as often in the Bible, “fame, reputation.” Through God’s “name” the king’s“horn will be raised” (Ps 89:25). But there are hints that the mortal king mighthave been described as ªélohîm, or, at least, as sitting on “God’s throne” (Ps 45:7; cf.1 Chr 25:23). Referring to the king as sharing God’s “name” is therefore at leastpossible. Psalm 8 then extends the notion of quasi-divinity to all humanity.Psalm 8’s use of traditional creation and royal themes to express the idea of hu-man greatness does not make it a Sophoclean or Shakespearean “paean to man,”because throughout the poem humanity’s supremacy is constantly contrasted withits weakness. This, of course, is the primary sense of the puzzling image of “infantsand sucklings.” It is possible that an image of a royal child is hovering in the backof the poet’s mind (cf. Isaiah 9 and 11). But it is more likely that the reference toinfants is primarily intended to be a radical heightening, almost a reductio ad absur-dum, of several traditional themes. One of these may indeed be royal. Ps 89:20states that God “placed a stripling20 over a warrior, raised up a youth from thepeople.” That God can win victory by the use of seemingly weak agents is also astock theme of the biblical holy war tradition in its covenantal form. For example,Gideon states that he comes from the poorest clan of Manasseh and that he is theyoungest in his family, as David was also ( Judg. 6:15). Psalm 8 sharpens these tra-ditional notions by choosing the most obvious image of innocence and helplessness(cf. Isa 11:6, 8).Moreover, the image of infancy was attractive to the poet from a wisdomstandpoint also. Indeed, one cannot really understand the irony of the image prop-erly unless one comprehends the wisdom context of Psalm 8. The obvious contrastto the wise man and woman is, of course, the fool, not the child. But in Psalm 8the poet has adopted the literary genre of the hymn.21 The wise also producedverse as part of their “instruction” and their skill (Ps 78:1–2; cf. Ps 45:1–2). The“mouth” of the trained poet, perhaps a member of the Levitical psalm-writingguilds, composing intricate verse, is best contrasted not with the foolishness of theingenuous but with the inarticulateness of the infant babbler.22The image of infant praise and power is a barb that is intended to catch thereader’s attention. But to what end? It obviously is meant to prepare the ground forthe pattern of essential contrasts and dualities in the poem. These contrasts and du-20.

It is hardly likely that the genre is here more than a literary device. The standard form-critical view that Psalm 8 had a cultic Sitz im Leben, and was perhaps recited at night (“when I see theheavens . . . the moon and stars,” v. 4) strikes me as highly unlikely in the case of a hymn of suchstriking unorthodoxy as Psalm 8!22. Isaiah uses a similar image for a different reason in Isa 28:10ff."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms109alities are incorporated in a triple parallelism between (1) the majesty of God andthe insignificance of infants, (2) the wonder of God’s creation of the heavens (and,by extension, of all nature) and human weakness (the literal sense of ªénos, “weakmankind”), and (3) within humanity, the depth of that very weakness and the royalsway humanity holds over other created beings. The perplexing Janus reference toinfants in v. 3 can now be seen to have the function of establishing and reinforcingthe later parallel contrasts of the poem more firmly in the reader’s mind. Is Godreally praised by babbling infants, through whom He can also gain victory overmighty foes? Yes, we humans, we weak mortals are those children, nothing asregards God, but ourselves gods over the rest of animate nature. In sum, Psalm 8represents a wisdom appropriation of royal themes to humanity to highlight theduality of the human condition as part divine and part weak flesh.23In light of this interpretation of the infancy image in the first part of Ps 8:3, wemay ask what is the signficance of the reference to the enemy in the second part ofthe verse. We saw that in the context of heavenly praise it might allude to the cos-mic foe of creation. In the context of human royalty, it may refer to the king’s ene-mies. But, once the creation context of Psalm 8 is solidifed, from v. 4 on, the “foes”would most likely be what we said the “sinners” were in Psalm 104: an element ofchaos which continues to threaten God’s ordering of the cosmos. To this extentPsalm 8 may be said to allude, like Psalm 104, to an inherent imperfection in God’swork. But here the doubt is totally submerged by awe. Even toddlers could stillsuch foes!If this interpretation is correct, then Psalm 8 must be viewed, like the Book ofJob, as an attempt by a wisdom teacher and poet to break the bonds both of OldWisdom and the newer hybrid wisdom-covenantal pieties by appealing over theirheads, as it were, directly to emotion, to the power of poetry itself. From this pointof view perhaps the most important literary device in the psalm is the anacoluthonof vv. 4–5. The very lack of logical consequence between the sight of the starryheavens and the emotion that bursts forth from the poet, “What is man . . .” is thecore of his message. Not reason, or even faith, but feeling is the answer to suffering.It is an emotion that is universal to mankind when gazing at a starry heaven, a feel-ing of awe combined with a sense of man’s insignificance—and yet pride in thevery privilege of being allowed to wonder. The image of infants is doubly apt: Itcatches both human frailty and the feature that children most notably possess: theability to wonder, and also to be an object of wonder, even in their helplessness.But there may be a more specific polemical intention in the reference to thedestruction of “vengeful foes” in Psalm 8 if one views it in the context of the crisis23. See especially Levenson, Creation, chap. 8. This duality survived from its ancient Near East-ern roots into modern times as part of the doctrine of the king’s “two natures.” Note the close parallelto Psalm 8 in Psalm 144, in which the royal context is explicit. The duality is appropriated for Israelas a whole in Genesis 32, through Jacob’s prevailing over ªélohîm and being awarded the name Israel,“he wrestles with divinity.”"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Stephen A. Geller110in the wisdom tradition described above. The other biblical occurrence of thephrase ªôyeb ûmitnaqqem is in Ps. 44:17, where it parallels “the voice of the scoffersand revilers”—in context, the nations that mock suffering Israel. Many commen-tators, both traditional and modern, have suggested that in Psalm 8, because thecontext is one of speech, the reference is also specifically to those who mock God.It seems to me that in the intellectual and religious background of the wisdomtradition, the foes that Psalm 8 may really have in mind are “atheists” in the biblicalsense, i.e., those who deny Providence, the belief that God knows or cares abouthuman behavior, and who therefore give themselves over to unrestrained sin (cf. Ps14:1: “The fool says to himself, ‘There is no God.’ They act corruptly, abomina-bly”). Job’s friends eventually accuse him of being just such a mocking, atheisticsinner. But Psalm 8 represents a viewpoint that seems to be close to the final emo-tion of Job and presumably represents the standpoint of the author of that book.Can it not be possible that the poet of Psalm 8 is once again radically reinterpretingand heightening a traditional idea; specifically, that the “foes” of Psalm 8 to bestilled by the mouths of babes are the wise men who represent the position of Job’sfriends?If the reference is to opposing wise men, then the reference to “infants andsucklings” is just the sort of sharpening of a stock image we noted above. Wisdomwas associated with age: “Wisdom is with the hoary, understanding in length ofdays” ( Job 12:12). Elihu, the young upstart, holds his silence for as long as he canout of awareness of his callow youthfulness, compared to the aged wisdom of Job’sfriends ( Job 32:6–9). Psalm 8 extends youthful ignorance back to infancy, a su-preme irony in the worldview of the sages. The refutation of such “foes” (= thewise) requires no extended argument by intellectuals trained in the traditions of theacademies. Even an infant’s incoherent argument could confound them, becausethe essential argument is not verbal at all. One need only gaze at the heavens to re-fute these “wicked” sophists. The twist in Psalm 8—a poem of many twists—maybe that the great enemy is not chaos itself, not even chaos in the form of evil andsin, but failure to stand in simple awe at God’s manifest work. Moreover, it is pre-cisely this sense of child-like, unquestioning wonder at the sublimity of creation,most manifest in the sight of the starry skies, that saves humanity from the dangerof hubris inherent in the duality of its position in the cosmos. Awe implies feelingsof insignificance as well as rapture. If man is aware of his divinity, he must also con-stantly be cognizant of his all-too-human weakness.In other words, the message of Psalm 8, like that of the Book of Job, is anti-intellectual. Of course, the strongest deriders of intellect are usually former intellec-tuals themselves. But the psalm is not opposed to the use of intellect for the samereason that the new Torah pietists were: because of a belief that study of Torah isthe only true wisdom. After all, the Torah scholars valued intellect itself, providedit confined itself to covenantal law and was restrained by faith. Rather Psalm 8 andJob argue that emotion is the highest wisdom. Psalm 8 makes explicit what is onlyimplicit in the divine speeches of Job as I interpret them: a sense of awe at nature,"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms111which does not intellectually answer the problem of evil and suffering, but makesthem irrelevant in terms of a swelling emotion. Sin and pain are inherent in hu-manity, but insignificant for so long as one is lost in wonder at the beauty and orderof the cosmos and enraptured by a sense of man’s privileged position in creation, assimultaneously both in it and royally over it. Indeed, perhaps it is this ability towonder that forms the chief part of human supremacy over nature.Psalm 8 treats the problem of sin even more dismissively than Psalm 104 did. Itviews it as something to be defeated even by babies, if one can achieve a babe-likesense of wonder. It also changes the focus of creation from its manifoldness, as inPsalm 104, to the dual, heavenly-terrestrial, divine-human status of humanity. Thefocus will be sharpened and narrowed even further by the next poem to be consid-ered, Psalm 19. There, the theme of the glory and praise recited by the heavens isexpressed even more paradoxically than the idea of the praise offered by inarticulateinfants in Psalm 8—it is, in fact, silent, wordless praise! Moreover, the real interestwill be not in humanity as a whole, as in Psalm 8, but specifically in the innerworld of the individual.IVPsalm 19 consists of three sections so intertwined in terms of language and im-agery that any source- or form-critical talk of its being a mere patchwork of frag-ments of three originally unrelated poems must be viewed with suspicion. The firstpart deals with nature, the second with covenantal, Torah-based piety; the third isa personal plea for inner purity from sin. Running through the poem are images ofphysical light and intellectual enlightenment. Again, we shall present a brief se-quential exegesis of the psalm and then return to discuss the issue of the relation-ship between nature and piety.The poem opens with a statement, v. 2a, that “the heavens recount the gloryof God,” which any Israelite would undoubtedly take as referring to the commontheme of angelic praise of God as king and creator. Ps 89:6 is especially close: “Forthe heavens praise your wonders, O Lord: // Yes, your faithfulness, in the assemblyof the holy beings.” But the parallel line, v. 2b, immediately presents a surprise:“and the work of his hands the firmament relates.” The surprise is that the firma-ment, the plate that was believed to form the curve of the sky, is elsewhere pre-sented itself as God’s handwork (Genesis 1)! In other places where the theme ofdivine praise in heaven occurs, the parallel or context makes it clear that the angelsare meant (as in Ps 89:6b, just quoted). Here the parallel is strikingly self-referentialand can be taken to mean that the firmament declares, by its very existence, that it,itself, is the work of God’s hands. Nature has been, if not demythologized, at leastde-angelized, so to speak.Verse 3 is similarly self-referential: “day pronounces speech to day, and nightexpresses knowledge to night.” Reference is probably to the two main lights thatwere believed to be affixed to the firmament (cf. Genesis 1), the “greater light” of"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Stephen A. Geller112the day, the sun, and the “lesser light” of the night, the moon. The point is thesame: the sun and moon praise God by their simple being.24 The demythologiza-tion continues in v. 4, for even the image of audible praise itself is denied: “Thereis no speech, there are no words, Inaudible is their voice.” Nothing could make thepoint more clearly: It is the mere existence of the heavens, the physical heavens offirmament with its heavenly bodies that attests to God’s glory.25Verse 5 presents a paradox: soundless as this heavenly praise is, it extends overall the earth from the heavens: “(Yet) to the whole earth their sound goes forth, tothe ends of the world their utterances.”26 The paradox of silent praise is reminis-cent of the “thin, whispering voice” of 1 Kings 19. The demythologization of thestock theme of thunderous angelic praise of God has proceeded as far as it can go:it is as purely natural elements that the heavenly bodies attest to God’s greatness.The effect is almost Pre-Socratic in its attempt to clarify something purely physical,but how different from the Greeks! Here nature is stripped of divinity to praiseGod with a new, silent language.Mythology floods back abruptly and surprisingly in v. 5b: “For the sun He seta tent in them (the heavens) // Now, he is like a bridegroom emerging from hiscanopy,// He rejoices27 like a warrior to run on a path.// From one end of theheaven is his emergence,// his course is to their (other) end,// and nothing is hiddenfrom His sun.”28 A wealth of mythic images involving the ancient theme of thesolar hero is evoked, a theme with sexual overtones.29 This sudden turn to myth iscertainly striking after the highly demythologized language of the preceding verses.Why the emphasis on the sun? The image of speech extending to the ends ofthe earth evoked the image of the chief heavenly body that also extends from oneend of the sky to another, whose rays also, necessarily, reach to the ends of thewhole earth. The image is almost Ra-, even Aten-like.30 Most likely, the focus is24. Although it is possible that yôm léyôm . . . wélaylâ lélaylâ are elliptical for miyyôm léyôm . . .ûmillaylâ lélaylâ, “daily . . . nightly” (cf. Num 30:15 and especially Ps 96:2). In this case the subject ofthe verbs is haraqîaº. However, this interpretation is less likely than the self-referential one.25. There is no reason to take these words as a later gloss. The popular alternative reading thattakes v. 4 as the predicate of 3b: “There is no speech, no words whose voice is inaudible,” which im-plies the stock theme of crashing sound, seems to me less likely on syntactic as well as thematicgrounds, but would affect the general interpretation offered here only slightly, chiefly in regard to theamount of departure from mythologically rooted images one posits in the first part of Psalm 19.26. Qawwam should not be emended to simple qôlam, “their voice.” The translation is on the basisof the parallelism, and will suffice for the discussion here.27. Or “rushes”; cf. Job 39:21.28. Probably a play on the literal sense of ̇ammâ, “hot one,” i.e., “his heat”; cf. Sir 43:2.

One cannot deny that solar imagery, primarily in the form of the winged solar disc, playedan important role in Israelite iconography; see O. Keel and C.

This forms the link to part two of the psalm, in which thetheme is Torah, often itself associated with light.32 The statement that “nothing ishidden from His sun” prepares the poetic ground for part three, where a pun onlight imagery is employed: “Also your servant is admonished (nizhar; pun: “illu-mined”) by them (the laws).” There, also, the theme of “hidden sins” (v. 13) willcontrast with the penetrating rays of the sun, from which “nothing is hidden” (v. 7). Suddenly, in one of the most striking non-sequiturs in biblical literature, thedescription of nature breaks off and is replaced by a Torah doxology. The dyna-mism of the previous verses is replaced by a fixed pattern of six repeated, shortverbless clauses of identical pattern. In each the Tetragrammaton appears in thesame position as the second member of a construct chain: the A of yhwh is B, C-ingD, in which A is a term referring to some aspect of piety, B is an adjective, C is aparticiple. Only D is varied in grammatical function.33 The effect of great regularityis surely intended to mimic that of the heavenly bodies. The message is that theTorah has the stability and immutable order that traditional wisdom had discernedin nature. The silent praise of the heavens is succeeded by the audible instructionof God. Old Wisdom gives way to the new Torah piety.Does Old Wisdom give way for Torah piety, or does it make space for it? InPsalm 19 does Torah piety succeed Old Wisdom or attempt to complement it?There is no hint of an overt anti-nature polemic in Psalm 19. Both nature and lawattest to the same divine origin; hence the penetration of light imagery into theTorah doxology (especially in v. 9b). Where should Psalm 19 be placed along thecontinuum of the viewpoints we have been examining? On the basis of the firsttwo sections of the poem, it might be viewed as the expression of a wisdom pietythat attempts to retain the link to nature, while also accepting the new covenantalorientation totally. Logical ordering is replaced by mere juxtaposition of the twolanguages, those of nature and of Torah. But before making a judgment on thismatter, the evidence of the third part of the psalm will have to be considered.The third section of Psalm 19 turns inward. In v. 12 the psalmist makes hisfirst-person appearance: “indeed, your servant is illumined/warned by them (thelaws), // in keeping them is great reward/consequence (ºeqeb).” The two puns in thisverse, noted by the slashes, are striking. The first is, as noted above, a final echo ofthe light imagery of the psalm. But its other sense, “warned,” is ominous, for warn-ing is more than merely instructing. It hints at possibly negative consequences. The31. Is ªohel a play on hll I, “flash light, be radiant?”32. This inner-biblical association seems to be more likely than that the image of the Mesopota-mian sun deity Shamash, also the god of justice, plays a role in the imagery of Psalm 19. The sun isalso a symbol of natural regularity in Qoheleth, but how different his weary use of the image is fromthe joy of Psalm 19!33. Only the last in the chain, v. 10b, is varied in syntax, to mark closure.ikonographichen Quellen (Freiburg, 1992). But the recent spate of speculation on the solar nature ofYahweh Himself seems forced, since there is only one explicit reference to Him as “sun” (Ps 84:12)."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Stephen A. Geller114second pun is equally two-edged. As “reward,” ºeqeb continues the theme of thevalue and desirability of the commandments (v. 11). But as “consequence” it con-tains an element of foreboding. That foreboding does not wait long to be ex-plained: v. 12: “Inadvertent (sins) who could comprehend, // acquit me of hidden(sins).” This is the worm in the apple of the new Torah piety: the possibility of un-willed, unwitting sin, unknown to the pious, which yet might bring down on themdivine wrath as a consequence.It must now be apparent that Psalm 19 is an expression of the type of hybridwisdom-Torah espoused by Job’s friends, part 1 (vv. 1–7) being the wisdom com-ponent reflecting the nature orientation of Old Wisdom, and the second part(vv. 8–11) being a doxology of covenantal Torah piety. The third section (vv. 12–15) reflects the strict cause-effect doctrine of the hybrid piety of Job’s friends(hinted at by the use of the unusual term ºeqeb, “consequence,” in v. 12b). The lat-ter was, as stated above, a result of the blending of the ancient concept of orderedcreation with a new, perfervid belief in ineluctable reward and punishment, and itmade the possibility of hidden, unconscious sin the main inner fear of the pious.One must search oneself to discover what the cause of one’s suffering, even if seem-ingly unmerited, might be. This is precisely the course urged on Job by his friends.The psalmist can but pray that, should his greatest efforts at introspection fail to findsuch crime, God will still forgive him. The new Torah piety placed great emphasison confession. The psalmist here confesses in advance of punishment, so to speak.The inner uncertainties of the new piety of the Seventh-Fifth Centuries are heremanifest. The necessity of inwardness and constant demand for self-searching, whatmight be termed, accurately if anachronistically, the puritan heart of Torah piety,were magnified by the wisdom traditions of the hybrid wisdom piety.But deeper fears are to come, the core of true puritanism itself: v. 14a: “Alsofrom presumptuous sins34 keep your servant back, let them not have sway overme.” This is the source of proto-Calvinist gloom, the piercing awareness of humansinfulness, that sin is the demon “crouching at the door” of the soul, lusting afterone (Genesis 4). The evil yeßer (Gen 8:21) is a constant threat and it comes fromwithin. The dark core of Torah piety in its wisdom-influenced form contrasts withthe joy of the solar imagery earlier in the poem. What a difference in mood be-tween the exalted, if silent, praise of the heavens and the spectacle of the joyouslyracing sun, and the disturbed heart of the penitent, contrite already for crimes yetuncommitted!One can see why the fully developed Torah piety, say, of Psalm 119, aban-doned wisdom’s old interest in nature. As piety turned inward, by its necessary dy-34. Literally, “presumtuous, arrogant ones.” In context, this is much more likely to be a referenceto sins than to sinners, although the latter sense is the only attested one elsewhere in the Bible. Thepoet here makes use of the theme, traditional in psalms of petition, of persecution by the wicked. Butit is important in such cases to recognize the significance of subtle new shifts in standard meanings,the essence of the literary approach. Such a shift is apparent in the nuance of zedîm here as referringto the inner foe of sin itself rather than external sinners. There is no need of an emendation to zadôn."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms115namic (for that is where the core of the ultimate chaotic element lies, namely, thehidden urge to sin), a focus on everything outside had to blur and fade. One cannotboth look at the heavens and constantly search the ground for stumbling stones.The psalmist can only pray for divine help, because only God can keep oneback from one’s innermost urges. The goal is complete purity, outer and inner:v. 14b: “then I shall be perfect (lit.: “whole” [ªêtam]) and be cleared of gravecrime.” The first epithet of Torah in the doxology was its perfection (v. 8: tôratyhwh témîmâ). The believing self must be correspondingly perfect. But, of course,one can never be completely perfect or whole, because one may have inadvertantsins hidden even from oneself which one cannot therefore confess and for whichone cannot atone. They are “hidden” from oneself; but they are known to God,from whom, as from His sun, nothing is hidden. They may be minor sins; but tothe puritan mentality all sin is pesaº rab, “grave crime.”Old Wisdom had preached continuity between nature and morality in theseamless web of creation, although, to be sure, the ever-present danger of chaos/sinmarred the perfection of created order. Yet chaos and sin could be contained, evendefeated. But the new puritan conscience had no such confidence. From this pointof view, the striking lack of consequence between the nature and Torah sections ofPsalm 19 reflects not only the psalmist’s leap of faith, but, simultaneously, hisawareness of the lack of such continuity. After all, one needs to have faith onlyabout things concerning which there is doubt. The more doubt, the more faith isrequired. Added to the uncertainty is the dichotomy between the urge to whole-ness, which was the goal of the Old Wisdom dispensation, and the awareness of theimpossibility of that ideal, magnified by constant fear of chaos in the form of theinner urge to sin. The psalmist stands over an abyss and knows it.35Wholeness was also an aim of the cult, in which sacrifical animals had to beperfect in all details. Psalm 19 ends with cultic language: “May the words of mymouth // and the thoughts of my mind find favor before You, // O Yahweh, myrock and my redeemer.” “Favor,” raßôn, is the technical term for the desired resultof cultic actions, all of which must be performed with complete exactness andcompleteness before God. It is the cult that was traditionally believed to demandperfection in all things, an imitatio dei that demanded that the faithful be as totallyholy as God. The cultic turn at the end of the psalm is partially a literary relic ofthe cultic Sitz im Leben of the psalms of petition, which the pleas of part three echo.But there is a deeper reason.Above, we asked if the juxtaposition of parts one and two of Psalm 19, of na-ture observation and revealed Torah, repectively, should be viewed as implying acomplementary or conflicting relationship between the two. As is usual in the lit-erary approach, the answer is both simultaneously! The psalmist, aware of the inner35. Does he secretly blame covenantal Torah piety and its constant demands for this inner fear?Certainly, the contrast between the refulgent joy of the nature section of the poem, reflecting OldWisdom, and the rigid Torah doxology, plus the gloom of the final section, is striking."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Stephen A. Geller116tensions of his intellectual and religious situation, conscious of the lack of congru-ence between Old Wisdom’s rootedness in nature and the demands of the newinward-looking Torah piety, can only beg God to view his very statement of theproblem, it all its lack of wholeness, as an act of sacrifice, even praise.Nature is silent, its speech stilled by the new centrality of the word of Torah astext. The wholeness of nature and piety postulated by the Old Wisdom tradition isperhaps shattered. But the psalmist will not let go of wisdom or nature. He statesthe problem, and reveals the inner torment caused by his awareness of the impos-sibility of ever finding spiritual wholeness in the new puritan dispensation for thoseto whom nature still has a message, however silently expressed. He prays that Godwill accept the very statement of his anguish as an offering that, by finding “favor,”will transcend wisdom to produce, somehow, a sense of perfection. The wisdompiety of Job’s friends is revealed in Psalm 19 in its deeper aspect. To be sure, thetendency towards self-righteousness and inquisitorial zeal is present; but the formeris an aberration common to all faiths and the latter is at least, in Psalm 19, turnedon oneself. This kind of religion may indeed have had mechanistic tendencies be-cause it so feared chaos, and even, as the author of Job paints it, encouraged a kindof sophistry. But like later Stoicism, the main impulses of which it forshadows, wis-dom piety could be, in its highest forms, a faith of real nobility, because that faithwas achieved through inner struggle.36VPsalm 139, as mixed in regard to literary genre as Psalm 19,37 is the ultimatebiblical expression of the intense inwardness that marks the type of proto-puritanismdescribed above. Yet the psalm still clings to nature, still has not renounced it infavor of sacred text; but nature has shrunk here from the cosmos as a whole to theperson of the psalmist. The individual focus we saw introduced in Psalm 8 (v. 4),and developed mightily in the final section of Psalm 19 (vv. 12ff.), expands to fillPsalm 139 completely.The essential link to the wisdom tradition is introduced in the very first words:“Yahweh, you have searched me out ( ̇åqartanî) and know (me).” “Searching out,”“examining” is a term favored by wisdom to describe its efforts at knowledge, evenmost radically, of the secrets of creation.38 Here it is an individual who is the objectof God’s study. The language that the covenantal Torah piety applied to the study36. Psalm 51 shows a configuration of cultic, wisdom, and pietistic themes not unlike Psalm 19,but what is missing is the important role of nature.37. Some form critics, while not denying the obvious wisdom elements, classify Psalm 139 as apsalm of petition and assign it to a cultic Sitz im Leben involving a ritual test in the sanctuary. I wouldview it as an individual meditation making use of wisdom and cultic themes. No more than was thecase with Psalm 8 (or Psalm 19) can one imagine such a poem being actually used in the cult.38. Cf. Job 9:10; 11:7; and especially Job 28, on which see my discussion in Sacred Enigmas,chap. 5."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms117of God’s covenant, most famously in the Shema, is here applied to God’s examina-tion of the psalmist: “You know my sitting and rising, // observe(?) all my ways.”The platitude of searching out the “ways of wisdom” or walking on the paths ofrighteousness is upended: it is God who examines human “ways,” by which ismeant not just “conduct, behavior,” but also “human nature.” Some of the imageryis almost claustrophobic: “You hem me in behind and before, // place your handover me.” While these images can signal divine protection, they are also close tomotifs used elsewhere in the Psalms to describe persecution by one’s enemies.Similar is the language the psalmist uses to express the impossibility of escapingfrom God: “Whither could I go away from your spirit, // and whither flee fromyour presence?” God could find him even if he goes, like Jonah, beyond the re-motest sea, even if he goes down to nethermost Sheol.These expressions would be those of relentless persecution (and are similar tosome of Job’s complaints about God),39 were it not for the statement that “suchknowledge is too wonderful (pélîªâ) for me, // too exalted, I cannot (comprehend)it.” Now, “wonderful” is a term used in most of the Hebrew Bible for the super-natural and miraculous. In covenant religion, it refers to the wonders God per-formed to rescue His people. But in wisdom texts “wonderful” refers to themysteries of creation, which the human mind cannot comprehend.40 Here, it alsorefers to a very specific and personal aspect of creation, namely, God’s total under-standing of the individual. Verses 13ff. speak directly of the central issue, the crea-tion not just of mankind, but specifically of the psalmist: “For you created myinnards, // covered me in my mother’s womb. // I praise you because I am won-derfully conceived. // How great are your works!” The latter reference to “yourworks” reminds one of Ps 104:24, but there the qualification was “how many areyour works!” Here, it is “how wonderful!” In the former passage the object is thewhole of creation. Here, the reference is to the speaking self: “as I (napsî) knowvery well.” The psalmist describes how his body was “stitched together in the neth-ermost parts of the underworld.”41 Verse 16, the text of which is disturbed, seemsto be a statement of God’s foreknowledge, and perhaps even predestination, of thepsalmist’s whole life.Verse 17 marks a shift of focus. Up to this point, the psalm dealt with God’scomplete knowledge of the self, from its creation to the end of life, in all places, atall times. Now the poet reverses direction and speaks of his thoughts about God,which are almost as infinite as God’s thoughts of him: “For to me how precious arethoughts of you, // how mighty is their sum! // If I try to count them, they are morethan the sands, // if I could come to the end of them42 I would still be with you!”39. On Job’s persecution by God, cf. Job 16.40. See the discussion of the term niplaªôt in my Sacred Enigmas, pp. 102–3.41. Probably a mythical reference.42.

Geller118What the poet has accomplished is a subtle introduction and an even moresubtle transmutation of the demand of Torah piety that one’s thoughts be entirelyfocussed on God’s covenant law. But in Psalm 139 a shred of the creation contextof Old Wisdom is retained, although narrowed to the personal relationship of Godand the believer. Both aspects of knowledge, God’s knowledge of man and man’sof God, are juxtaposed and equated. Humanity can approach infinity, but only ifits thoughts are confined to God.Verses 18–21 are famously disturbing. One almost wishes the text were corruptenough to be incomprehensible. Apparently as evidence of his complete identifica-tion with the mind of God, the psalmist exclaims: “If only you would kill thewicked, O God! . . . Do I not hate those who hate you, Yahweh? . . . I hate themwith an extreme hatred, // they are my enemies.” After such sublime inwardness,this outburst is doubly repulsive. The new inner puritanism manifests its mostnegative side. From a form-critical aspect this section reflects the theme of persecu-tion by the wicked that is characteristic of the psalms of complaint and petition.God is normally asked by the psalmist to destroy his persecutors, who are, ofcourse, also God’s enemies. But here, what hubris! It is God’s enemies that are thefocus, and the psalmist offers to give God his moral support, so to speak!The last two verses return to the beginning of the psalm: “Search me out, God,and know my heart, // test me and know my thoughts.” Confronted by a God whoknows one’s every word and thought, total vigilance is required, constant intro-spection and testing. The zealous God of covenant Torah piety demands the sameexclusive zeal from His worshipers. He requires not just right deeds but rightthoughts; hence the focus of covenantal Torah piety on the study of sacred text lit-erally authorized by the Deity, which one is to ponder day and night.In Psalm 139 the type of hybrid wisdom piety represented by Job’s friends andalso by Psalm 19, as interpreted above, proceeds even further on the path towardinwardness and the exaltation of individual conscience. To be sure, as we have seen,concern for nature as creation has not yet totally disappeared, but it has shrunk tothe formation of the individual human to be a receptacle for God’s thoughts andthoughts of God. The proto-puritanical aspects are much more pronounced thanin Psalm 19, although, to be fair, one must remember that the burning hatred ofthe wicked that flares up from vv. 18–21 is really the negative aspect of the positivecovenantal demand of the Shema to “love God with all your mind and life, to thefullest extent.” The final verse is especially poignant: “And see if the path of grief is in me; andlead me on the eternal path.” What is meant by the striking expression “path ofgrief ” (derek ºoßeb), here paralleled by “eternal path” (derek ºôlam)? Certainly, the lit-eral sense is “path that leads to trouble,” i.e., sin and suffering. From this point ofview “path” here means, as is usual in wisdom literature, “conduct.” The psalmistassures God that he is free of sinful actions that might cause God, and himself, grief,pain and suffering. But, as noted above, derek, as “conduct,” can also approach thesense of “nature, the way things work.” It seems likely that the poet is trying to"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms119assure God that through mental and spiritual identification with Him the inner hu-man tendency to sin, the bugbear of the incipient covenantal puritanism, has beenessentially overcome. He welcomes the divine inspection that is the main theme ofPsalm 139.43What the psalmist seems to be saying is this: “See if I share in the sinful natureof humanity, I whose thoughts are no longer really human because they consist to-tally of You.”44 What the poet of Psalm 19 feared, his own unconscious sin and,worse, his inner urge to sin, the poet of Psalm 139 states he has overcome throughidentification with God’s mind.45Free from derek ºoßeb the psalmist can proceed along derek ºôlam. In creationcontexts ºôlam has a cosmic nuance, the primeval order established in the begin-ning, the path fixed from of old. In wisdom terms, the “eternal path” means therelationship within the created order between the natural and moral realms.46 Assuch, ºôlam refers also to the indeterminate future. The “eternal path” stretches un-changing in regard to its demands and rewards, from the time of creation to themost distant future, so long as the world exists. Both of these traditional ideas aresurely implied by the final line of Psalm 139. But, in view of the humble hubrisimplied by the psalmist’s self-identification with the mind of God, is it not possiblethat the “eternal way” implies also the path to divine immortality, to that eternallife that later religion would make a dogma for all believers, but that in Psalm 139is offered as yet only to the faithful few, perhaps to the psalmist alone? He is thewisest of God’s servants, because all his thoughts are of his creator and are almostas infinite as his creator’s.47VIIn this essay we have examined two main types of reaction by wise men to theTorah piety. One group of sages responded by incorporating from Torah piety itszeal and emphasis on faith, but attempted to retain something of the old role ofnature, both cosmological and human. Some, like Job’s friends, did not referopenly to covenantal law at all. Everything was still put in general human terms,43. Perhaps ºoßeb recalls the ºißßabôn and ºeßeb placed on Adam and Eve as a result of their sin.44. Alternatively, the first part of the verse may be taken as the protasis of a conditional sentenceand the second as its apodosis: “if the path of grief is in me, then lead me on the eternal path.” In thiscase, the psalmist is not claiming that he has overcome the sinful condition of humanity but onlypraying that he may do so, with God’s help.45. The idea of human sinfulness is more directly expressed in Ps 51:7: “I was born in transgres-sion, // and it was in sin that my mother conceived me.”46. Such seems to be the sense in Jer 6:16 of nétîbôt ºôlam and of sébîlë ºôlam in Jer 18:15; cf. alsoJob 22:15, ªora ̇ ºôlam, which refers to the ancient and eternal conduct (and resulting punishment) ofthe wicked.47. It is also possible that ºôlam here is meant to echo the use of that term adverbially, which canoccur without a preposition (cf. Ps 61:8; 66:7, etc.) as a kind of closure to the poem: “lead me on thepath (of ) forever!”"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Stephen A. Geller120with appeal to the natural order of things. That God Himself might have becomefor these savants part of that natural order they probably did not suspect. But thatHe was a sage like themselves they never doubted. They knew that cause and effectruled all things, and that certainty combined with the zeal of Torah piety to forma doctrine of inflexible retribution. It was simultaneously mechanistic and pietistic.Yet, as we have seen, this hybrid wisdom piety was not without a certain stoicnobility, for it forced the individual to accomodate himself to the rigid order of thenatural and moral cosmos. Upon him the burden fell, and he could respond onlyby turning ever inward in the manner of Psalm 139. The wise constantly searchedfor secret sin that would disturb the order of things, as they conceived it. His wis-dom orientation prevented this type of wise man from simply throwing himself onGod’s mercy and asking forgiveness, as unmerited as it might be, from a lovingDeity (although the ending of Psalm 19 perhaps hints at a desire to do so, at leaston the part of its author). How could he? To him God was, in essence, a Principle,however much he spoke of Him as if He were a Person. Principles cannot love, orhate.Opposed to this intellectual endeavor stood the emotional reaction of the au-thors of Job and of Psalm 8. They neither affirm nor deny Torah piety. They standoutside the realm of ordinary piety entirely, because their reaction to the cosmosexcludes everything but a swelling sense of wonder and of poetry. For them nature,as creation, offered an immediate association with God that sober covenant couldnever offer. Suffering became something irrelevant, as it is to anyone in the grip ofan overpowering emotion. It may not be entirely absurd to present them as the dis-tant spiritual ancestors of Wordsworthian romantics or Concord transcendentalists.Their religion was also individual, like that of Job’s friends and of the author ofPsalm 19; but rather than leading to a lifetime of introspection and self-examination,it excited in momentary bursts of enthusiasm and what seems to be close to pro-phetic inspiration. God spoke to them, as to his prophets, from a storm cloud ( Job38:1). Needless to say, such a religion of lyrical thrill has little to do with the routinesof daily life.The attempt to save a meaningful role for nature in biblical religion failed. Thevictory of Torah piety was complete; although it, too, could not solve the ancientwisdom problem of theodicy until it accepted, in the Hellenistic era, the new doc-trine of resurrection and judgment of the dead. In the world to come all the moralinequities of this world would be made good. The risen corpses would acknowl-edge and acclaim God’s justice. Torah piety, starting with Deuteronomy, acceptedthe techniques and much of the language of Old Wisdom in regard to study andmeditation, applying them to Torah; but it excluded interest in nature in favor oftotal concentration on the history of God’s relationship to Israel.The traditions of Old Wisdom, which attempted to comprehend the order ofthis world, both in terms of its natural and moral dispensation, on the basis of in-tellect and introspection, struggled for several centuries. Qoheleth demonstrates thatnature-rooted Old Wisdom survived, at least in him, and with a gently embittered"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Nature and Piety in Some Biblical Psalms121and cynical tone, into the late era. Otherwise, by then, nature was relegated to thebackground, literally. Sirach shows the pattern. To be sure, he devotes a chapter(43) to the wonders of God’s creation, but only as a prelude to the famous, andmuch longer, paean to famous pious men. Creation becomes merely a setting forHeilsgeschichte, woven into the pattern of historical salvation (as in Psalm 136 andNehemiah 9). Nature also played a role in the more cosmological forms of apoca-lyptic literature and mysticism, but there, too, only a subordinate one. Rabbinic ex-coriation of those who admire a tree for its beauty instead of meditating, as theyshould be, on Torah, shows how much a feeling for nature had faded in the wise.

Indeed, marriage, uniting unrelated individuals from two separatefamilies, requires that intimate family status be conferred upon outsiders; and futurechildren o f the union will become heirs to family wealth and responsibilities.Changes such as these must therefore proceed in an orderly and deliberate fashionin which all parties, insofar as possible, know their rights, privileges, authorities, andstatuses.The gradualism (or stages) that we propose for Babylonia reflects a view ofmarriage that is compatible with what one finds in other pre-industrial societies. 1.

As an historian o f ancient Chinese marriage has noted: “Inmost societies weddings are great occasions for displaying status; sometimes more isspent on the ritual festivities than on durable items that end up in the dowry asfamilies perform the rites elaborately to confirm or enhance their status.” 3 Oneshould thus carefully study religious and ceremonial rites as well as any economictransfers between the parties. In ancient China, marriage incorporated an elaborateseries o f formal activities: divination to determine i f the match and timing wereauspicious; initial inquiry between the families; petition of the groom to make hisbetrothal; sending betrothal gifts to the bride’s family; inquiry by the groom to hisancestors before fetching the bride home; fetching the bride by groom or his rep-resentative; sending o f f o f the bride by her parents; escort o f the bride to her hus-band’s home by her relative or representative; formal transfer of the bride to thehusband’s family; visit to the husband’s ancestral temple before consummating themarriage; visit by the bride to her parents a fter a period o f time to inquire o f theirhealth and report on her new life. 4 The Chinese practices need not o f course betaken as paradigmatic for Babylonia but there are, as we will see, many striking par-allels. In Babylonia, as in China, “inchoate marriage” was more than the two-staged process that has often been assumed. We are able to describe five successivestages o f “inchoate marriage” for which we propose the terms: deliberative, pre-nuptial, nuptial, connubial, and familial. Cuneiform scholars have focused much at-tention upon the “prenuptial” stage because o f the bridewealth gi fts and the sexualtaboos affecting the future wife (see presently below). In their discussions, the con-tinuing “inchoateness” o f the “connubial” and “ familial” stages has been largelyoverlooked. 5 But there is more. Scholars have resisted assigning legal weight to the ceremo-nial and symbolic acts occurring in these successive, inchoate stages, even whenthese acts are mentioned within the laws!

Ceremonies and symbolic acts can be more than ornamental; for the an-cients they were often fundamental and constitutive actions, symbolic markers oflegal change. 6 We must therefore also explore ceremonies and symbolic rites asso-ciated with each one o f the stages o f marriage as part o f our investigations. In thediscussion that follows we will endeavor to do so, in the hope of allowing the stageso f “inchoate marriage” that can be found both in and outside o f the laws to bemore vividly seen and their impact and consequences appreciated. “Inchoate Marriage” in the Laws The stages o f “inchoate marriage” appear in the Old Babylonian laws primarilybecause o f their impact on marital property. Marital property includes bridewealthcontributed by the husband or his family, dowry contributed by the bride and herfamily, and other assets that may devolve to husband, wife, their siblings, their ownchildren, or other relatives. The laws focus upon the pre-nuptial, nuptial, connu-bial, and familial stages of “inchoate marriage.” 7 The paragraphs o f the laws de-scribe the boundaries or transitions between these stages, where unanticipatedevents or intrusive actions interrupt the marriage and conflicts develop over therights to and ownership o f marital property. CH §§159–61 take place in the “prenuptial” stage. The prior “deliberative”stage, during which the families negotiated and planned, is past, since the futurehusband has already sent or delivered his bridewealth gifts 8 to the home o f his 6. Westbrook, OBML , 1, referring to our earlier study, “Ceremonies,” asserts that “the conclu-sion o f marriage was attended by many more ceremonies than was necessary in law for its validity.”He goes on to say: “. . . it is only in terms o f rules o f law that marriage is defined. To know whatmarriage is, therefore, it is necessary to have recourse to legal norms alone . . . before . . . social, eco-nomic, or other aspects can be discussed.” I believe, however, that law, at this point in civilization,had not yet fully separated itself from the formal actions and rites that are described in the laws as wellas in other sources. (Cf. further on this point the quotation from Max Weber cited below.) The im-pact and consequences o f customary (required?) rituals and ceremonies there fore must be explored.Besides, most ancient “legal norms” that we modern scholars identify are, after all, constructs of ourown minds, since the abstract legal rules we search for are usually embedded in casuistic form ratherthan being overtly expressed. 7. There are a number o f Akkadian terms that appear to reflect the stages o f marriage that wehave identified. Em u tum and h ada ssu tu/ h ad as u are used to describe the “nuptial” stage; see notes 32 and49 below. Ha ªirum, hi rtum , formed from the verb h iª a ru “choose,” reflect the “prenuptial” stage o f mar-riage, although the terms are also used to describe husband and wife later on in their marriage. Theterm a ssu tum u mut u tum , which may perhaps owe its duality to Sumerian nam.dam. s è, seems none-theless to reflect the “connubial” stage or experience. The correspondence o f Akkadian terms to stagesof marriage merits further investigation. For textual references, see Westbrook, OBML , 11, 18–20.8. The OB bridewealth gifts, termed tir h atum (majority o f cases), biblum , or more rarely zubullûm and su bultum , are discussed in “Bridewealth,” 65–85. mu.túm, apparently to be read su rubtum , oc-curs as a term describing deliveries o f bridewealth in ARM 26, 11:32–36.

These cases deal with thedisposition o f the bridewealth gi fts when this happens. LE §25 parallels the case described in CH §160; the future husband wishes toproceed with the nuptials but is refused: I f a man calls out ( for his bride) at the house o f his ( future) father-in-law 9 but hisfather-in-law cuts him (off) 10 and gives his daughter to [another], 11 the father of thedaughter shall return in double measure the bridewealth gift he received. Driver and Miles noted important features that mark this “prenuptial” stage of in-choate marriage: the father of the woman is already identified throughout as emum “father-in-law (of the future husband)”; in CH §161, the woman, though still re-siding in her father’s house, is called a ss atum “wife”; and her prospective husband,as far as any outsider is concerned, is the b e l a ss atim , the legal husband or “masterof the wife.” The “inside parties” at this stage could cancel the marriage and sufferonly property loss; but the “prenuptial” stage had more serious consequences forany outsider who attempted to have sexual relations with the future wife after thedelivery of the future husband’s bridewealth gift. According to LE §26 and CH §130, outsiders would suffer the death penalty as rapists or adulterers. The “prenuptial” stage is contrasted with the “connubial stage” o f marriage in LE §§17–18: 9. The expression ana b i t emim s asû has been compared with ana b i tim/b a bim s asû , which comesto mean “to claim”; see CAD S /2, 160. In discussing the passages cited by CAD and others, Yaron, LE 2 , 58, 191–98 and Westbrook, OBML , 39–41 overlook the close Sumerian parallels noted by mein “Contract,” 521 78 and also by T. Jacobsen, “Religious Drama in Ancient Mesopotamia,” in Unityand Diversity: Essays in the History, Literature, and Religion of the Ancient Near East (eds. H. Goedickeand J. J. M. Roberts; Baltimore, 1975), 65–97. The Sumerian passages have also been discussed byC. Wilcke, “Familiengründung,” 277–79. The Sumerian parallel phrase é.e gù.ba.an.dé “call outto the house” is followed by the spoken words é gál.lu/ é gál.ù “open the (door o f) the house,”suggesting that there was an actual ceremony or event taking place here and not just figurative lan-guage o f claim. As Jacobsen (ibid., p. 65) notes: “The rite is patterned a fter the normal Ancient Me-sopotamian wedding ritual, which had the bridegroom appear with his wedding gifts of edibles at thedoor o f the bride’s paternal house asking to be let in.”10. Our translation o f this verb, written ik- s i-su-ma , is based on a possible link to ka sa tu “to cutoff ” (CAD K, 287). This reading, faithful to the signs as they appear on the photograph, was suggest-ed by J. Van Seters, “Jacob’s Marriages and Ancient Near Eastern Customs,” HTR 62 (1969): 377–95 (on p. 381). It is interesting to note that the Hittite Laws §§ 28–29, which deal with situations verysimilar to CH §§160–61, employ the verb tuhs-, which literally means “to cut off.” See Harry A.Hoffner, Jr., The Laws of the Hittites: A Critical Edition (Documenta et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui23; Leiden, 1997), 37–39 and 304.

I f (however) he took her and she entered his house (and then) either the‘taker’ or the ‘bride went to (his/her) fate,’ he shall not collect everything that hebrought; he shall take back only what is left over.12 The wife’s dowry, consisting of clothing, jewelry, household items, and some-times even slaves and real estate, was usually much larger and more valuable thanthe husband’s bridewealth gift.13 The dowry typically came with the woman whenshe left her father’s home and entered her husband’s house.14 This event inaugu-rated the “connubial” stage o f marriage. But the marriage was still “inchoate” withrespect to dowry; the assets of the dowry were intended for the wife and her futurechildren, not for her husband. CH §§163–64 describe how, i f the wi fe died with-out children, the dowry reverted to her family; the widowed husband was, how-ever, then also entitled to a re fund o f the value o f his earlier bridewealth gi ft.However, i f the woman bore children to her husband be fore her death, then thedowry belonged to them and nevermore to her father or his heirs. This change,brought about by children, inaugurates the “familial” stage of marriage. The mar-riage is no longer “inchoate” but completed. CH §162 declares: I f a man has taken a wi fe (and) she bore him children and that woman ‘went toher fate,’ her father shall make no claim upon her dowry. Her dowry belongs toher children.Marriage, in antiquity, as now, was “for better or for worse, for richer orpoorer.” In CH §117, a husband beset by debts was permitted to sell his wife (aswell as his son or daughter) into debt slavery. A tragedy o f this sort could not betotally prevented; it could befall a woman already during the “connubial” stage12. These law paragraphs, as preserved in what appear to be school texts, are awkwardly draftedwith respect to the subject o f the verbs “collect” and “take back”; the subject appears to be the hus-band; yet he would be unable to collect if he and not his wife died, as the phrase before suggests asone o f the possible mishaps. I understand the last phrase “what is le ft over” as limiting the husband toreclaiming only inedible items; perishable or consumed items could not be recovered, just as is thecase in MAL §§30–31, 43. Other scholars have attempted to interpret this phrase as somehow havingin mind the return o f a dowry a fter deducting the bridewealth as in CH §§163–64 (discussed below).But there is no mention o f dowry in LE §§17–18! For more discussion, see “Bridewealth,” 68–69. 13. A clear statement o f comparable value is found in ARM 1, 46, with improved readings o fJ.-M. Durand, “Le dames du palais de Mari à l’époque du royaume de Haute-Mésopotamie,” MARI4 (1985): 403–4. The king anticipates receiving back a dowry o f more than twice the value o f thebridewealth that he will be giving on behal f o f his son.14. This transition is clearly described in CT 8, 50a, a document in which a woman’s father setsaside a future dowry for his daughter. In lines 8–11, he states: um mutum ihazzusi qati mutisa ißabbatmaana mutisa irrub, “On the day a husband takes her, she shall take hold o f the hand o f her husband andenter her husband’s house (with this dowry).” Other texts that connect the transfer of dowry to thehusband with the entry o f the wi fe into his home are BE 6/1, 101; CT 47, 83; CT 48, 50; Dalley,Edinburgh, 15.

I f the woman’s (drop) is dis-turbed(?), the woman will die.17Evidence for the “deliberative” stage is scarce since any marriage plans are still verytentative at this point in the relationship.15. In MAL §32, this liability—responsibility for her husband’s debts—could befall a womaneven before she entered her husband’s house (lu ana bit emisa laqiªat lu la laqiªat) i f her husband be-stowed upon her a marriage settlement (nudunnûsa tadnat). The husband’s settlement was a customarycontribution o f “indirect” or complementary dowry. This gi ft signified that the “connubial” stage hadstarted; the woman therefore became liable for his debts and obligations. For further discussion, seeDriver and Miles, Assyrian Laws, 202; and G.

Important evidence for activities taking place dur-ing the “prenuptial” and later stages o f marriage is found in UET 5, 636, whichrecords many rites and ceremonies that accompanied these stages, at least for themost wealthy, elite families. Families of lesser status may very well have marriedwith less fanfare; for in less affluent settings, as we note presently below, even a fu-ture husband’s bridewealth gift might be absent.18 One may compare, for purposeso f illustration, the description o f a most modest wedding in China o f the ImperialPeriod: “just three cups o f weak tea and a bow at the family shrine.”19 The familiesin UET 5, 636 celebrated a far more elaborate wedding; the preserved documentis a record of expenses—food, drink, gifts—that was kept for the father of thebride. The entries (I–XII) in the document help us to reconstruct the sequence ofevents beginning during the “prenuptial” stage and taking us to the beginning ofthe “connubial” stage, when the bride left Ur to begin her new life with her hus-band in his home at Larsa.20 Pre-nuptial Stage. Entries I–II (lines1–8) take place during the “prenuptial”stage; they include the woman’s father sending gifts of garments, gold, and silver toa person who is apparently the future husband and, in addition, offerings to the godsin Larsa and Ur. The character o f these religious rites is not clear; they may havebeen intended to secure divine blessings upon the couple prior to the wedding.21 Entry III (lines 9–17) records the arrival o f the future husband’s bridewealthgift at the home of the woman in Ur; there are outlays of food and oil for anoint-ing given to the persons who brought the bridewealth and, in addition, what mayhave been a small counter-gift of food to be given to the husband’s family and car-ried back to Larsa by the husband’s brother.22 The arrival o f the future husband’sfamily at Ur is recorded in Entries IV–V (lines 18–25).

The bridewealth gift is here called biblum; the counter-gift of food was placed upon a tray orportable table, which may have been the same one upon which the husband’s biblum was placed. Forother occurrences of foodstuffs upon a table or tray given as bridewealth, cf. “Ceremonies,” 59–61.See also D.

For Sumerian níg.dé.a (counterpart to Akkadianbiblum) consisting of foodstuffs, see “Bridewealth,” 77–82.

Entry IV (lines 18–20) records the arrival o f two women, apparently honored guests; a sheepwas slaughtered for them. Entry VI (lines 26–28) records the slaughtering of a sheep plus beer andflour (for bread) for the groom’s mother upon her arrival. Wilcke, “Familiengründung,” 270–73 re-stores the arrival o f the groom’s father in Entry V and similar largesse for him.24. Such rituals were typically performed by the asipu, who was a professional exorcist. However,simpler rites and incantations might be performed by non-specialists and even the affected personhimself. In a discussion of namburbi rituals, J. Bottéro, “Rapports sur les conferences: Antiquitiés Assyro-babyloniennes,” Annuaire de la IVe Section de l’École pratique des Hautes Études (1973–1974): 87–122 (on pp. 100–101), points out an incantation to be recited by a person who wakes from a baddream; this text is KAR 252, i 7–12, treated by Oppenheim in Dream-book, 300a.

In “Ceremonies,” 57, I translated the verb as plural butpointed out (pp. 61–62) Sumerian parallels where Inanna bathes before allowing Dumuzi to enter herhouse and consummate their marriage. The bride, in ancient times as in modern times, is the centralfigure in a wedding. Subsequent readers have followed Landsberger, “Jungfräulichkeit,” 78–79, intaking the verb as singular with “irrational” length. I have deferred to them here but do not reallyunderstand why the groom should not also have bathed prior to his nuptials. Cf. on this point theconcurrence o f J. J.

Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed., s.v. “bridal.” The “pouring” and “drinking” o f kirrum maybe a custom somewhat distantly related to the rich folk tradition found among many peoples wherebride and groom share a common cup or dish o f food as part o f their wedding ceremonies; for ex-amples, see E.

If he ar-ranged a marriage pact and ‘bride-ale’ for her father and mother and took her (inthis appropriate manner), she is a wife. The day she is caught with another manshe shall die; she shall not live.CH §128 addresses the same situation in briefer fashion, omitting the requirement for parental consent and the drinking o f “bride-ale”: “I f a man took a woman anddid not arrange a marriage pact, that woman is not a wife.” The omission of kirrumin CH §128 has caused scholars to overlook or doubt its legal importance.30 Is thereany reason to regard CH §128 as depicting the formation of marriage in a mannerfundamentally divergent from what is described in LE §§27–28? It is important, first o f all, to recognize that marriages could take place in a lesselaborate as well as in a more elaborate fashion. There are, e.g., two places in thelaws where the woman is described as “wife,” first, after the bringing of bride-wealth, as in LE §26, CH §§130, 161, and again, after the marriage pact with (orwithout) “bride-ale,” as in LE §27–28, CH §128. When bridewealth was given andaccepted, the future wife “became a wife” in a limited sense, i.e., to outsiders; butthe marriage could still be dissolved by the parties. However, not every marriageinvolved the giving o f bridewealth gi fts. This is clearly seen in CH §§138–139,which describes marriages without bridewealth; and this omission, apparently in-volving families of lesser status or means, is further confirmed by the OB marriagedocuments, which record numerous marriages without mention o f bridewealth.3129. The full Akkadian phrase is kirram u riksatim ana abisa u ummisa iskun. The construction hascreated some awkwardness for translation; the verb sakanum elsewhere (e.g., CH §§122, 128) takes rik-satim as its object; there is no attestation o f the use o f this verb with kirrum, for which the only verbattested is sapakum “pour” (cf. F. R. Kraus, “Briefschreibübungen im altbabylonischen Schulunter-richt,” JEOL 16 (1964): 16–39 [see pp. 24–25]; TCL 17, 64:16; CT 4, 18b: 5–6—cited in “Cere-monies,” 63–65—and additional references added in n. 26 above). In UET 5, 636:33 the bride’sfather supplies the beer for the kirrum (as does the cloister for the incoming novice priestess in CT 4,18b—a dedication ceremony patterned after marriage). The preposition ana must therefore derivefrom the other obligation for the future husband, in other words, the marriage pact (riksatum) inwhich he is the initiating party, as reflected in CH §128 and in Stone, Nippur, 34 (see text withnn. 32–33 below), where the parent(s) o f the bride respond(s) to the husband. The awkwardness o fformulation is discussed by Westbrook, OBML, 29, 3122.30. Yaron, LE2, 200–205, ponders the different formulations and suggests that they may be dueto a different focus within each law collection. On p. 202, he considers the possibility that either kir-rum or riksatum alone might have been sufficient.31. Cf. “Bridewealth,” 76. OB texts recording marriage without bridewealth include: ARN, 37and 54; Meissner, BAP, 89; BE 6/2, 48; CT 2, 33 and 44; CT 6, 26a; CT 6, 37a; CT 8, 22b; CT 8,their mutual satisfaction and accord. ARM 26, 404:60–64 relates how the kings “After they deliber-ated and made the pact (riksatim irkusu) and the ass was slaughtered, they each one to another had theoath sworn and sat down to the cup. After they quaffed the cup, they offered gifts one to another.”"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Samuel Greengus132The same may be true o f kirrum. Evidently, a man and woman could not begin thesocially recognized “connubial” stage o f their marriage without nuptials, which in-cluded a formal marriage pact or riksatum. The drinking o f “bride-ale” may havebeen an option, necessary to express parental consent for those women who re-quired it. There is an OB document that appears to record a formal expression of paren-tal consent to marriage: “Concerning the wedding o f Istar-lamassi and Sin-abusu—‘as for (his) taking (in marriage) my daughter who is (still) young,’ Nannatum an-swered ‘yes.’ ”32 A list o f 14 witnesses follows, including among them Istar-lamassi,her mother, and Sin-abusu, the future husband. After the witnesses, just before thedate, the text states: “1 1/3 shekel silver worth o f beer these witnesses drank; 1 literoil (for) their anointing.”33 Thus, we have preserved in this record the consent ofboth parents as required by LE §§27–28: the father’s consent expressly stated; andthe mother’s consent (and the daughter’s agreement to marriage) indicated by theinclusion o f their names in the witness list. The document also records what ap-pears to be the drinking o f “bride-ale” by the witnesses. Defining the Marriage Pact.The marriage pact (riksatum) that appears along withthe drinking o f kirrum or “bride-ale” in LE §§27–28, was not a betrothal agree-ment, i.e., an agreement to wed at a future time, as has been suggested.34 Formal32.

Stone (p. 64)points out that two years later, in BE 6/2, 42, a relative o f Sin-abusu reclaims documents left withNannatum who appears to be the father of Istar-lamassi. Stone believes that this transaction may bethe reason why this ceremony was recorded in writing. The syntax o f lines 1–5 is not smooth; it ispossible to read the verb in line 5 as i-pu-lu(!), suggesting that mother (and daughter?) also answered“yes.” Stone calls this document a “betrothal.” But emutu in all other contexts relates to the nuptialsor wedding; cf. CAD E, 162. It is unusual to see these proceedings recorded in a written document.See, on this point, references cited in n. 46. 33.

Westbrook, OBML, 31–32, 58–59, has argued that riksatum is a betrothal contract only;marriage itsel f needed no contract; it was, rather, a change o f legal status. The payment o f bridewealthgave the future husband the right to complete the marriage by taking legal control of the woman.Westbrook’s hypothesis (p. 31) is challenged by the fact that in UET 5, 636, the kirrum was drunkat the time o f the wedding (i.e., “nuptial” stage); one cannot there fore maintain its connection with37d; CT 48, 49; Gautier, Dilbat, 14; PBS 8/2, 155; Speleers, Recueil, 230; Stone, Nippur, 1; TCL 1,61; TIM 4, 48–49; TLB 1, 229; UET 5, 87; VAS 18, 114; YOS 12, 371; YOS 15, 73.

The omission o f bridewealthmay be due to the fact that many o f these marriages involved women who were o f lower social status;they were adopted or manumitted or sometimes remained unfree, as was pointed out in “Contract,”512, nn. 31–32. Another factor may have been a second marriage for one or both of the partners; thisis the case in Stone, Nippur, 1, TLB 1, 229, and VAS 18, 114."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Redefining “Inchoate Marriage” in Old Babylonian Contexts133betrothal agreements are well attested for Sumerian marriages in the Ur III period,but evidence for them is scant for the Old Babylonian period.35 Clearly, someagreement needed to take place between the families during the “deliberative”stage, especially before sending or bringing bridewealth gifts; but formal records ofsuch agreements are lacking. A letter, AbB 12, 63:5–8, relates: “Concerning thematter o f Amat-Sin: at the time when she was young, Nana promised the son o fthe gentleman that he could take her (in marriage).”36 The letter goes on to discussother matters but indicates that the marriage between Amat-Sin and the son o f thegentleman had already taken place at the time this letter was written; Nana was ap-parently Amat-Sin’s father.37 Note that the “betrothal” agreement is here notcalled riksatum, “pact or contract,” but simply qabûm, “promise.”It is difficult to attach much importance to OB “betrothal agreements”—suchas they may have been—since the laws begin to deal with marriage only in the“pre-nuptial” stage when a gi ft o f bridewealth was given and received. I f agree-ments were made but no bridewealth given, or i f the bridewealth was re fused, thensuch agreements were evidently dissolved without legal or financial consequences.38We can see the tentative nature o f the situation that existed between the parties whowere still in the “deliberative” stage in a SB tamitu, where the “betrothed” husbandseeks divine consultation prior to bringing his bridewealth gift:35.

In OBML, 34–60, Westbrook begins his discussion o f what he terms “standard inchoatemarriage,” that is, a marriage where bridewealth was given; but he does not explain how the futurehusband acquired the right to complete the marriage in situations where no bridewealth was given,situations that Westbrook (p. 55) recognizes as having also occurred. This is problematic since he(p. 34) also agrees that a betrothal agreement alone (i.e., without payment o f bridewealth) would notmake the future bride an assatum, one who is subject to the penalties o f LE §26, CH §130.riksatum, which he takes to be a pre-nuptial or betrothal agreement. Westbrook attempts to argue thatkirrum in UET 5, 636 is different from the kirrum in LE §§27–8, since it was provided by the woman’sfather and not by the husband (arguing from ana—but see n. 29). Alternatively, he argues that theparties in LE §§27–8 agreed on the kirrum during the pre-nuptial stage (i.e., betrothal) but did notactually drink it until the nuptials took place. He insists (p. 56) that riksatum in LE §§27–28 and inCH §128 was “separate from the act of marriage.” While Westbrook (pp. 32–34) argues for riksatumbeing a betrothal agreement, he does not deny that the extant marriage documents were writtendown at a later time, “upon completion o f the marriage.” (I would assume that the documents werewritten down at or near the time o f the nuptials.) Westbrook asserts that the written marriage docu-ments give us information about the terms of the contract but that it is difficult to distill the essenceo f the contract, since the written documents vary so much in content. Westbrook (pp. 16, 31, 48, and60) argues that, at the very least, whether written or not, the “betrothal agreement” gave the man theright to “take control” (i.e., ahazum), o f his wi fe; he does so when they “complete the marriage.”When is a marriage completed? Westbrook (pp. 48–53 and 100), after denying legal validity to allceremonies (including verba solemnia, domum deductio, copula carnalis), admits to some uncertainty onthis important point."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Samuel Greengus134[O Samas, lord] o f judgement!

[This] is what I ask Samas and Adad.39 The entire marriage could be called off by the bride’s family simply refusing toaccept the prospective groom’s bridewealth gift. If, however, the bride’s family ac-cepted the groom’s bridewealth gift but the nuptials were delayed, then—and onlythen—can we speak o f the couple being in any sense “betrothed.” We can considerthem to be betrothed because of the legal consequences that followed from accep-tance o f the bridewealth gi ft by the bride’s family, as has been previously discussed.The Sumerian betrothal agreements, by contrast, had more legally binding power;in them, oaths were sworn which became the basis o f court actions; and monetarypenalties were paid i f the sworn betrothal agreements were cancelled. So what was the Old Babylonian riksatum? I maintain that it was an archaicform of contract, entered into at the time o f nuptials, which created the bonds o fmarriage between the parties: the husband on the one side and the wife on theother side. The main purpose of the ancient marriage pact or contract was thus to effect andsignify a change in the status of the parties.

Adoption has been well discussed; one findsparallels with marriage involving the recitation o f verba solemnia, a well-attested for-mal mechanism by which a new status o f marriage (or adoption) could come intoexistence or be dissolved.41 A rich documentation concerning OB treaties has cometo light from Mari. Treaty partners can be described by the terms “father” or“brother,” and the status o f solidarity and friendship between the parties is the goalas summarized by the key phrase: itti nakriya lu nakrata itti salamiya lu salmata andvariations.42 We find the use o f the phrase riksatam sakanum to describe treaty for-mation, which takes place through a variety o f related activities. These activities in-clude drawing up documents listing names o f the gods by whom parties swear andtexts o f the agreements reached; symbolic acts such as “touching the throat,” “rais-ing the hand,” sacrifice o f an ass, drinking the cup.43 The phrase riksatam sakanum,“to make a treaty,” embraces all o f the symbolic elements and actions which wentinto forming the treaty and the new relationships and responsibilities that werethereby created.Analogies can be drawn with marriage in that riksatam sakanum here likewisedescribes a bundle o f activities that create this new status with its obligatons. Thisis why CH §128 can use a single term, riksatum, to describe the creation o f a bind-ing relationship between the spouses without enumerating all o f the acts and ele-ments that went into doing so. LE §§27–28 specifically adds kirrum because it is aceremony linked with conveying parental consent, which is the main point o f thelaw paragraphs there. The marriage contract, like the treaty, needed to include andconvey in a decisive fashion the agreement of the contracting parties and their legalrepresentatives. 41.

Weber, for example, in his es-say after the quotation given above, continues with a discussion of how oaths wereoften used as a vehicle both in “status” and “purposive” contracts. Oaths, in fact, are sometimes found in Old Babylonian marriage; in two (orthree) documents oaths were sworn by the groom in the king’s name, apparentlyduring the nuptials.45 Oaths do not appear to be associated with every marriageand apparently arose from special circumstances; they were apparently added to se-cure per formance o f some or all o f the contractual provisions that are recorded inthe written marriage documents in which the oaths are found.46 There may be another, indirect reference to the use of oath with the marriagepact in an OB document from Larsa. The document states:Sat-Marduk swore an oath by the life of Samsu-iluna the king concerning Ahunison o f Ilsu-ibbi as follows: “Unto Ahuni son o f Ilsu-ibbi—I do not hold him; Iam not besworn unto him.

Westbrook, OBML, 31–32 and 56, maintains that marriage came aboutthrough the act o f ahazum, separate from the making of the contract, which in his view is only a pre-liminary, betrothal agreement (see n. 34). Yet his theory must then also explain the broad use ofahazum in LE §§27–28 and in CH §128, where the verb is used even when legal marriage status isdenied! Cf. also the similar broad use of hiarum in the rape o f Ninlil and the postponed legal recog-nition o f usus marriages in MAL §34 and Ur-Nammu Laws §5 (“Contract,” 521). In my understand-ing, ahazum is a general, non-specific term capable o f being used to describe any or all o f the actionsnormally performed during the nuptial phase of marriage—including consummation and “making thecontract,” i.e., the riksatum. 45.

The statement made by Sat-Marduk seems to re-fer back to and cancel a previous oath, apparently made in connection with themarriage pact at the time o f their (ill- fated) nuptials.47 According to the laws, legal responsibility for making the marriage pact restedupon the groom. The role o f the bride was more passive; she may not have spoken,rather she would have shown her acceptance o f the obligations o f the marriagethrough her willing participation in the marriage pact rites and ceremonies thatwere performed.48 The End of Nuptials and Afterward.Consummation apparently took place afterthe making o f the marriage pact; it was part o f the nuptials; but its customs and con-duct are more fully described in ritual and religious texts than in legal and economicrecords.49 There may be a prelude to consummation in several OB references that47. The text is BM 13912, no. 8, in M. Anbar (Bernstein), “Textes de l’époque babylonienneancienne,” RA 69 (1975): 121–25. In line 6 the woman states: la kalâksu la tummâksuma “I do nothold him; I am not besworn to him.” The document is witnessed and sealed by 8 witnesses. Thiswoman, after beginning and breaking off the nuptials, was apparently seen as a legal adult, no longersubject to the jural authority o f her father. Such independence is recognized by Westbrook, OBML,31, where he asserts that “the legal obligations o f marriage . . . are between the bride and groomalone.” Ai 7 ii 43–iii 3 suggests that divorce would be necessary, following the nuptials, in a situationwhere the couple had opportunity to have sexual relations. See Landsberger apud J. J. Finkelstein,“Recent Studies in Cuneiform Law,” JAOS 90 (1970): 243–56 (at p. 245). 48.

Insome o f the royal marriages at Mari, the bride came to the palace o f the groom, where the weddingand consummation took place.

There is an echo o f the pomp surrounding such journeys in the MB in-stallation rite for the priestess of Hadad at Emar. When she leaves her father’s house to enter the templeafter seven days of celebration, they cover her head with a colored headdress “in the manner o f abride”; two female attendants conduct her “like a bride” in a torch-lit night procession accompanied"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Samuel Greengus138may describe a ceremony o f the groom removing the fibula or pin fastening thebride’s dress. This reminds one o f the present day custom where, a fter the weddingceremony, the groom, with broad and deliberate gestures, removes the bride’s garterand throws it to the male bridallers who seek to catch it for good luck.50 The nuptial celebrations often included a honeymoon for the new couple, aperiod whose duration depended upon the wealth and circumstances o f the fami-lies; the story o f Atrahasis suggests that nine days was typical. This was a time forcelebration and getting to know one another, free from the necessity of work andeveryday pursuits.51 Entry XII (lines 46–50) describes the end o f the nuptial celebrations and thebeginning o f the “connubial” stage: “the day they (husband and his attendants) ledher away (back to his home in Larsa).” This important transition was also the occa-sion o f seeking divine guidance through divination.52 The arrival o f the bride ather new home was again an occasion for celebration.53 There the couple returned50. TIM 4, 48:7 speaks o f the groom opening “the fastening pin o f her virgin(?) (garment)—dalla (giß.igi.dù) nu-mu-un-zu-na in-du8.” See “Bridewealth,” 76 and n. 45 above. In “NewDuplicates to SBTU II,” AfO 30 (1988): 1–23, M. Geller has published duplicates to nos. 6–7, wherethis same event o f removing the fastening o f the woman’s clothing is paralleled by the “maiden whohas never been deflowered, never had sex in her husband’s lap.” A variant o f this phrase appears inS. Lackenbacher, “Note sur l’Ardat-Lilî,” RA 65 (1971): 119–54, where we have the sequence: “themaiden whom like a woman, a man has not deflowered her, touched her charms, stripped off her gar-ment” (p. 136). Another formulation (p. 124) has the sequence “the man who in the bosom of hiswife did not touch her charms, strip off her garment, who was forced to leave the house of his wed-ding (ina bit emutisa sußâ).” See also in CAD Í, 193 ßillû, lex. section. A different(?) form of needleceremony may be at the root o f line 187 from the Nanshe Hymn published by Heimpel, JCS 33(1981): 65–139, which states: bulug-nam-dam-ma tés-bi ba-dab5, “He joined them togetherwith the needle o f matrimony” (cited in Sumerian Dictionary B, 174). In his article “ßillâm pa†arum ‘ToUnfasten the Pin’, copula carnalis and the Formation o f Marriage in Ancient Mesopotamia,” JEOL 32(1991–92): 66–86, M. Malul argues (p. 70) that this act, rather than being a ceremony, was “clearlya euphemism for the act of copulation.” I disagree with his conclusion and would argue that suchceremonies are the public preliminaries to actual consummation that follows and takes place in pri-vacy. Malul also states (p. 85) that consummation “bore the legal consequence o f sealing an inchoatemarriage.” But, as I have already noted, a state o f “inchoateness” extends even beyond the nuptials. Inthis same vein, the sequence or story in Ai 7 ii, 47–51 suggests that an act o f formal divorce is re-quired after the bride has entered the groom’s house, even if consummation has not yet taken place.Cf. perhaps the events in CT 45, 86 described below. 51.

They all deal with the breakdown o f marriage. In CT 45, 86, a man car-ries out a ceremony o f divorce against a woman who is living in his father’s house.He is ordered to make an appropriate financial settlement. FLP 1340 records a pro-cedure under oath; one man (the woman’s father) states that he did not receive anybridewealth; the other man states that he will not “take” the daughter in marriageand that one should “throw her in the river.” BE 6/2, 58 closes a ten-year relation-ship between the parties with divorce action and payment o f (divorce) moneysome years after delivery and augmentation of the dowry (BE 6/2, 40 and 47).55The dissolving of marriages by formal divorce actions suggests a time after the“connubial” stage o f marriage had begun. The delivery o f dowry prior to the di-vorce in BE 6/2, 58 supports this determination. The procedure in FLP 1340 seemsto have occurred during the “prenuptial” stage. The woman’s father claims that ahouse was not purchased with bridewealth money; the man refusing to marryclaims that the would-be bride was involved in some sexual misconduct with an-other man. Their claims appear to mirror the “prenuptial” situations described inthe laws, LE §§25–6, CH §§130, 159–61 discussed above.54. The birth of a child was a time for festivities and rejoicing, as seen in a number of Ur IIIdocuments cited by Wilcke, “Familiengründung,” 293–95, and, earlier, at Ebla; cf. “Bridewealth,” 63.55. Westbrook, OBML, 43–45, 69, and 114–16, describes CT 45, 86 and BE 6/2, 58 as “incho-ate” marriages.

As in most o f the six model court cases already published or summarized, thetrial takes place in Nippur, specifically before the assembly ( pu-ù h -ru-um ), 29 in thecase o f the inheritance text 30 more specifically in ub- s u-ukkin-na . 31 Whether theking presided over the assembly is not clear here; in the homicide trial, the king inIsin explicitly remanded the case to the assembly in Nippur, 32 and that also seemsto have been the case in the inheritance case. 33 In the new inheritance case, the(unnamed) king figures only in the final promissory oath.Like the other examples o f the genre, indeed like a number o f other genres in-cluding, notably, royal hymns and royal correspondence, the new case can be saidto derive from authentic originals of neo-Sumerian (Ur III and early Isin I) date.This point o f view was implied by Finkelstein when he included the trial for ho-micide (i.e., case a) among “documents from the practice of law” (without furthercomment) in ANET (3d ed., p. 542), and when he wrote “that the Nippur case(i.e., case c) is one that came to trial.” 34 It was made most forcefully by Greengus,who concluded his study o f the “textbook case o f adultery” (case e) by saying: “Weneed not . . . doubt the essential historicity o f the trial and the penalties.” 35 As far as these undated texts can be dated on internal grounds, they belong tothe early Isin I period in the 20th century b.c. The inheritance case from Nippuris brought before King Ishme-Dagan of Isin (ca. 1953–1935 b.c .), while the homi-cide case is taken before his second successor Ur-Ninurta (ca. 1923–1896 b.c .). Inthe adultery case from Isin(?), the name of the maskim-commissioner, Ishmedagan-zimu, implies a date after, perhaps well after, the accession of Ishme-Dagan.The unnamed judges o f the new text (line 16) are typical o f neo-Sumeriancourt cases in general,36 but its prosopography ties it securely to Old BabylonianNippur. Since part o f the disputed inheritance involves the o ffice o f “anointedpriest o f Ninlil” and “elder,” it is worthy o f note that these o ffices existed only inNippur, where they are frequently attested in tandem, according to the exhaustivesurvey o f Renger.37 In particular, one may note that an A-ab-ba-kal-la and his sondEn-líl-mas-zu served in one or both o f these capacities;38 the former functioned in28.

Ten (or twelve) years a fter his own death, his youngerbrother Anne-babdu filed suit in the assembly o f Nippur against his sons (lines 6–9), the nephews o f Anne-babdu who, as grandsons o f Enlil-mashsu, would havebeen entitled to the full share of their deceased father.56 Only one o f these grand-sons is identified by name, the others merely as “his two brothers” (line 30), but allthree are designated as “heirs” o f Ur-Suena (line 30).

For a male slave gored to death by an ox, for example, the Lawso f Eshnunna provide compensation to the owner at 15 shekels, the Laws o f Ham-murapi at 20 shekels.58 Responding for the defendants, Aabba-kalla deposed that infact the plaintiff ’s heart had been satisfied with “that money” (i.e., presumably, the20 shekels) “at that time” (i.e, presumably, at the time o f the division o f the inheri-tance [lines 14–16]).

Hallo150Faced with this conflicting testimony, the judges turned the defendant over tothe gate o f the divine Ninurta for the oath (lines 17–20). Apparently the contend-ing parties were induced to come to terms (lines 20–21), although on balance thecompromise reached may be said to have favored the plaintiff. By mutual consent,he was given four shekels of silver by the defendant (lines 22–26), and while thissum represented only one fi fth o f his claim, it was supplemented by 8 “rods” o f or-chard given to him by the defendant and his two brothers in lieu (or in view?) ofthe shares o f inheritance not yet(?) adjudicated (lines 27–32). In return, the plainti f fhad to renounce, under oath and for all time, any further claims against the defen-dants, even i f in keeping with an old record involving their share (lines 37–41).Such claims included, in the first place, the o ffice o f guda-priest o f Ninlil and theland allotment that went with it and, further, all other real estate, slaves, or move-able property o f any kind from the patrimony (lines 33–36). A somewhat different interpretation is offered by Martha Roth.60 She suggeststhat Anne-babdu sued only for non-delivery of the slave-girls and that Aabba-kallawas sent to the oath ordeal for lack o f proo f that this debt had been long satisfied,though the heirs settled out o f court, so to speak, i.e., without the oath being ad-ministered. The real estate o f lines 27–31 was a separate issue. Having remainedundivided hitherto, it was given to Anne-babdu who, now that he had no futherproperty in common with the other heirs, could renounce any further claimsagainst Aabba-kalla on the inheritance.It is interesting to note the two different kinds of oath involved in the courtcase, the nam-erim2 oath and the mu-lugal oath. According to D. O. Edzard, the dis-tinction between them is one o f “timing,” with the nam-erim2 oath an asseverationregarding an action in the past, and the mu-lugal oath the promise o f an action tobe taken or avoided in the future.61 But a detailed review o f Ur III texts from Nip-pur by Izumi Yoda has shown that the distinction was rather one o f jurisdiction: thenam-erim2 oath invokes divine sanction, the mu-lugal oath royal sanction.62 (Therarer examples o f mu-dingir oaths must belong to the former sphere.) In the presentcase, Ninurta was invoked to decide between two conflicting testimonies, whilethe future observance of the compromise agreement arrived at was put under royalauspices.The new text is a valuable addition to the sparsely attested genre o f model courtcases. Like the other examples o f the genre, it probably owes its inclusion in thescribal curriculum o f Nippur (and o f schools elsewhere which took their cue fromNippur) to the belie f that it illustrated some particularly interesting points o f law.We can only speculate what those points were. Two may be proposed here, onepositive with negative implications, the other negative with positive implications. 60. Letter o f March 7, 1996.61. D. O.

By implication,this seems to rule out what we today might call a “statute o f limitations,” at leastwith respect to inheritance.On the negative side, however, the plainti f f obligates himsel f under oath to layno further claim to any part o f the patrimony, even i f in the future an older docu-ment should turn up to substantiate such a claim. That seems to be the import ofline 37, though it is not phrased with quite the degree o f explicitness associated, forexample, with the possible appearance o f a document sealed with a lost seal, wherereal and model contracts agree in specifying: “should any sealed tablets be lost andthen found again, they are to be destroyed,”63 or variations o f this formula.64 Com-parable explicitness is associated with the appearance o f a fraudulent tablet (†uppusihtu) which, i f it turns up, is to be considered false (sar) and destroyed (ihheppî).65Such Akkadian usage even left its mark on later Aramaic formulations, as shown byA. Skaist.66 Implicitly i f not explicitly, however, the concluding agreement in thenew case puts an end to further litigation and frees the defendants in perpetuityfrom the threat of new lawsuits.One final reason may be suggested for the selection of this particular case forthe scribal school curriculum, or canon in the sense in which I use the term,67 fromthe presumably vast stock o f authentic court cases on deposit in the archives o fNippur. It illustrates nicely a broader principle enshrined in another, and probablyearlier, stage o f that curriculum, namely the proverb collections.

Jacobsen was his ability to see a world behind amere sliver of evidence and to illuminate astonishing depths of view. It is not al-ways clear whether that which he saw is reality; but even where it might not be,his insights advance the process that will lead us eventually to a piece of reality orto the realization that we have too little information to reach it. The following con-siderations are based on very little information, and this writer, while being con-vinced that the reality of their subject cannot yet be reached, is encouraged byJacobsen’s work to yield to the lure of a treasure of insight in the darkness of pre-history into which the subject of Ningirsu’s name leads. 1. The Meaning of the Name Ningirsu The Sumerian name of the male city-god of Girsu, Ningirsu, means “Lady ofGirsu.” Already in 1932, A. Jeremias thought that this was due to the original bi-sexual nature of the god. 1 Yet there is no female trace in his nature. On the con-trary, he is the image of testosterone-laden maleness. He is god of the plow andirrigation, and he battles fearsome monsters who threaten the sown. How, then,shall we explain the name?Concerning this problem, A. Falkenstein (CRRAI 3 [1954] 46) observed: “Einappellatives n i n ‘Herr’ is nirgends bezeugt und ausserdem ist das Element n i n inden genannten Götternamen (i.e., Ningirsu, Ningizzida, Ninazu) sicher nicht iden-tisch mit n i n ‘Herrin,’ da die Emesalform dafür umun lautet, nicht g a s a n.” Thelogic of this argument is difficult to follow. If n i n in male divine names is not iden-tical with the word n i n which is the generic term for that which we translate as“lady” and if a generic term n i n with the meaning “lord” does not exist, what thenis that n i n which is neither? Emesal writings of divine names indeed replace theelement n i n according to gender of the bearer of the name by umun or ga s an,but they also replace lugal by umun, as in Umunbanda = Lugalbanda, and e r e s 1.

We certainly do not want to concludethat lugal does not mean king because it was rendered in Emesal by umun = lord.In his “Introductory Considerations” to the topic of pantheon in Mesopotamia,W. G. Lambert, like Jeremias before him, was tempted to explain the problem interms of alleged bisexual divine nature. Considering the meaning of the elementn i n in the case of Nin s ubura, he stated: “While as a common noun n i n means only‘lady’ or ‘mistress,’ in divine names it can be masculine: ‘master’ ”; and he continueson the nature of Nin s ubura: “Up to the reign of Hammurabi the gender of thisvizier is variable. Rim-Sin’s inscriptions attest the deity in both genders and so farthere is no explanation of this phenomenon.” 2 We have to realize, however, thatwhat we might understand as one god with a particular nature was, in this case, reallythree gods, three images standing in three different shrines. They were all viziers ofmaster gods, but they surely differed in the identity of the master, in looks and dress,and in gender. The Nin s ubura of Rim-Sin 8 was female, and her shrine was calledE 2 -nin-bi-túm, “House-fit-for-its-Lady.” It was located in Ur, and was presum-ably not a temple, as translations have it, but a room in the sanctuary of an Inanafigure. The Nin s ubura of Rim-Sin 12 was male and lived in E 2 -á F - F á-sum-mu,“House-providing-Instruction,” also in Ur and presumably a room in a sanctuaryof An. The Nin- s ubura of Rim-Sin 13 finally was again male and lived in E 2 -me-kìlib-ba-sa F - í l a, “House-raising-the-Head-in-total-Power” in Girsu. 3 There isno reason to believe that any of these or other Nin s ubura figures bears any bisexualtraits. The gender difference was presumably the result of the identification of Nin- s ubura figures with viziers and of the custom for a master to have a vizier of thesame gender.D. O. Edzard thought that n i n designated the title of a ruler and was originallyneutral in gender; later, but still prehistorically, it was limited to female gender as ageneric term, while keeping its gender neutrality in divine names. 4 The hypothesisagrees with the fact that many Sumerian designations of persons do not distinguishgender: l ú “person,” dumu “child,” e n “en-priest” and “e n-priestess,” and withthe fact that religion is a highly conservative environment, in which much pre-history survives. Yet it does not convince in the case of n i n because the sign withwhich the word was written includes a representation of the female pubic triangle.The sign can be traced back to the earliest stage of writing. 5 It is likely, then, thatalready at that early stage the word was identified with female gender.A. Westenholz thought that he had actually found two instances of n i n as a ge-neric term designating males in Early Cuneiform Texts in Jena (1975), nos. 3 and 67, 2. Or 45 (1976): 12.3. The inscriptions are quoted according to D. R. Frayne, RIME IV (1990).4. RLA IV (1975): 336 sub “Herrscher.” The argument is based on F. R. Kraus, JCS 3 (1951):66–67 and n. 11.5.

Itis not quoted in discussions of the meaning of n i n, doubtless because it is so pa-tently suspect. The reference may be added here as a curiosity. UET I 40 is a handcopy by C. Gadd. According to the copy, Ur-Nammu would have built a housefor the male moon-god d Nanna nin-an-na nin-a-ni, “Nanna, the lady of thesky, his lady.” No original of this “inscription” has been located despite the state-ment of the authors of UET I that the inscription was found on numerous bricks. 7 It was probably created when Gadd hastily transliterated the inscription in whichUr-Nammu commemorates building the house for Inana Kununa ( d Inana Kù-nu n -n a), misread his handwritten Inanna as Nanna, and replaced erroneouslyK ù -nu n -n a by a n -n a when he transferred the transliteration to cuneiform, as isthe method of copying cuneiform texts occasionally used by scholars. 8 P. Mander, comparing the Early Dynastic III godlists from Tell Abu Í alabih andFara, identified the entry d Nin-urta in Fara with d Nám-urta in Abu Í alabih underthe title “Nomi verosimilmente riconducibili tra loro che si presentano con variantigraphiche, concettuali o in lacuna,” without specifying whether he regarded thevariants as graphic or conceptual. 9 G. J. Selz proposed that the name d Nám-urtaand two more divine names having n á m as first element “should perhaps be un-derstood as “Lord (of ) x/y” etc.” 10 The proposition raises the possibility of finallyexplaining why the element n i n in divine names can describe males. Perhaps the 6. Text 3 is a list of names. After three personal names, the word n i n is found; then follow twomore personal names, which complete the text. The notation n i n may indicate that the three personslisted before it belonged to the staff of a queen. Text 67 is a list of parcels of land and persons. Thepersons were probably the recipients of the land. The text is not well preserved and has a complexformat. The notation n i n É follows a list of 4 parcels and associated names. The last of the names isPuzur-A s tar, presumably a male. Westenholz seems to have understood n i n É as a designation ofPuzur-A s tar’s occupation. It may refer again to the queen as head of a household. Perhaps É n i n,“household of the queen,” is meant.7. UET I (1928), p. xi. See the comment of H.

Notethat the entry is flanked by divine names beginning with the element n i n and thatthe text is in the habit of listing such names in groups. 2. Socio-Historical Hypothesis It appears then that we cannot dispose of the difficulty of a male god with thename “Lady of . . .” on philological grounds. If we look for a social model thatwould explain the name Ningirsu “Lady of Girsu,” we do not have to look fartoday, when women are beginning to occupy formerly all-male positions. Just aswomen become chairmen, so male gods may have moved into positions formerlyheld by female gods. 12 These were conceivably positions of city-gods, which mayhave been occupied by females as a rule in prehistoric times. It is noteworthy thatmany city-gods were female throughout Babylonia and especially in the conserva-tive territory of Laga s : Gatumdu of Laga s City, Ninmar of Guªaba, Nan s e of Nina,Dumuzi-Abzu of Kinunir. Male were Ningirsu of Girsu, Lugal-Uruba of Urub,and Nindara of Kiesa. If we could penetrate the dark long stretches of time beforeED III, we might find that city-gods were originally all female and that males en-tered such positions as time went by. While this is possible, it may be wrong, anda documented case is needed. I cannot offer such a case, but I believe that I havefound a feature of the relationship between Ningirsu and Bau in Girsu which indi-cates a change from female to male in divine supremacy in Girsu and a circum-stance of that change. 3. Bau as Lady of the Holy City In my article “The Gates of Eninnu,” 13 I proposed that Gudea Cylinder AXXV 25—XXVI 14 describes the gates that are also shown on the architecturalplan which Gudea has on his knees on Statue B; that one of these gates, Tarsirsir, 11. As pointed out by W. G. Lambert in OrAnt 20 (1981): 94–97.12. If so, the ancients did not change the title. The modern female chairman became a chair, orchairperson; the slayer of dragons and tiller of soil was proud to be the “lady” of Girsu.13.

He is mentioned in connection with the Holy City just once in the ED IIIperiod by Eanatum who “built the wall of the Holy City for Ningirsu.” 15 It is re-markable that Gudea in his numerous inscriptions, including Statue B and the cyl-inders which describe in considerable detail the building and restoration ofNingirsu’s temple Eninnu White Eagle, never mentions the fact that this templewas located inside the Holy City. Even when he detailed the work on the six gateshe did not mention that they were the gates of the wall of the Holy City. Yet hecommemorates building “for Bau her wall of the Holy City.” 16 It seems as if Gudeawas reluctant to mention the primary position of Bau within the Holy City in con-nection with his construction on the temple of Ningirsu. He may have been sensi-tive to the possibility of insulting the pride of Ningirsu by stating plainly the factthat on the soil of the Holy City, where Ningirsu’s temple stood, Bau was Lady. 4. Evolutionary Model That Eanatum built the wall of the Holy City for Ningirsu and that about 300years later Gudea did the same for Bau appears to indicate a shift from male to fe-male in ownership of the central sacred precinct of Girsu, not a shift from femaleto male, as the hypothesis proposed here demands. Yet how little do we know! Ina span of about 300 years, we have two episodes when ownership of the Holy Citywas spelled out. And how easy it is to invent scenarios into which these distantislands of knowledge can be fitted! For example, it may have been an iconoclasticact of Eanatum to assign the wall of the Holy City to Ningirsu, an act that was laterrepealed. Later rulers, among them Gudea, may not have wanted to repeat the mis-take. Whatever the true reason for the change in ownership of the Holy City mayhave been, the name “Lady of Girsu” of the male city-god of Girsu propels us to 14. In addition to the arguments for locating Etarsirsir inside the Holy City proposed in theaforementioned article, the Ur III text from Girsu published by G. A. Barton as no. 28 in HaverfordLibrary Collection of Cuneiform Tablets (1918) and collated by T. Maeda in ASJ 2 (1980): 207, is relevant.It lists wool rations for menial workers in various temples. The temples were identified as 3 houses ofBau, 2 houses of Ningirsu, and single shrines and summarized as “these houses (are) 14, Holy City”(é-bi 14 uru-kù). It is not conceivable that none of the 3 houses of Bau was Etarsirsir. The meaningof Tarsirsir is unclear, a fact that has led many scholars to read t a r as sila “street” despite the spellingÉ-dàr-sír-sír in AO 6775. A full discussion of the problem is given by G. J.

It may have proceededas follows: The principal deity of Girsu was originally Bau. Her first temple stoodon Tell A overlooking the Tigris not far from where the river arm leading to Ninabranched off. 17 At some point another temple was built for her on lower terrain tothe southwest, closer to the center of the city. Her image in that temple was differ-entiated from the image in the old temple by the addition of the epithet “Lady ofGirsu.” The epithet described her specific function as divine overseer of the affairsof the city. This function was taken over by a male divinity, who may have beenher husband, or antagonist, or both, and who continued to use the title Lady ofGirsu. Step by step, this male Lady of Girsu gained in power at the expense of Bau.The latest phase of this process is historical. In ED III Bau still owned considerableareas of agricultural land, 18 but by Ur III she had lost them all, and the last remnantof her erstwhile power was her titular ownership of the Holy City.It goes without saying that the explanation of the name Ningirsu cannot be ap-plied to all names of male deities beginning with the word n i n. One could arguethat some of these names have been wrongly interpreted and actually fit the pat-tern. For example Ningizzida may not mean “Lady of the Good Tree” but rather“Lady of M iszida,” understanding the second element as the designation of a place.Yet such explanation cannot convince in the case of Ninazu, which seems to mean“Lady Leech,” and in innumerable other cases where the second element is not inthe genitive and obviously not a geographical name.17. See my reconstruction in “The Gates of Eninnu.” Note also that Tell A was the highest ofthe tells in the ruin of Tello, which indicates that it was settled first.18.

Poebel presented an exhaustive study of the common Akkadianverb izuzzum/uzuzzum ‘to stand’, 1 in which he concluded that the forms of theverb were not, as had been generally maintained previously, aberrant forms of aroot *nzz but rather reflected the N stem of a middle-weak root *z-w/y/ª-z . In thecourse of his discussion, in a lengthy footnote, 2 he also argued that the allegedlyirregular verb it u lum/ut u lum ‘to lie (down)’ was actually the Gt of ni a lum/nâlum , averb with similar meaning. A few years later, in 1952, W. von Soden published astudy entitled “Unregelmäßige Verben im Akkadischen,” 3 having worked throughthe attested forms of izuzzum and it u lum and other difficult verbs for his fundamen-tal Grundriss ( GAG ), which would also appear that year. As the title of his articleindicates, von Soden concluded that Poebel was mistaken, that izuzzum and it u lum were instead to be considered irregular verbs “deren Formenbildung aus keinemder bekannten Paradigmen ganz abgeleitet werden kann” (p. 164). Von Soden’sview, naturally presented as well in GAG (§107) and still maintained in the re-cently published third edition of GAG , 4 has in the intervening four decades be-come canonical, with few dissenting voices heard. 5 1.

"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" John Huehnergard 162But Poebel was right: izuzzum is indeed the N of a root *zwz ; it u lum is simplythe Gt of ni a lum (root nyl ).Von Soden was certainly correct to point to a number of problems in Poebel’sstudy of izuzzum . Poebel was sometimes not careful to distinguish forms of indi-vidual dialects from each other. His proto-forms are often unlikely from a Semitis-tic point of view, and the derivational processes he assumed are frequently ratherforced; he relied almost entirely, for example, on phonological developments, someof them quite dubious.But von Soden’s fundamental complaint about Poebel’s hypothesis was the lat-ter’s assumption of a triradical root underlying the forms of izuzzum . Von Sodeninsisted instead that most weak verbs—both in Akkadian and in Semitic gener-ally—were originally biradical. This is equally strained, and led von Soden to positequally dubious paths of development. Thus, for instance, he suggested ( ZA 50,165) that the best explanation of the frequent doubling of the final radical in formsof izuzzum was that the root was originally biradical, *ziz ; yet the most likely con-tenders for original biconsonantal status in Semitic and Akkadian, namely, certainroots I– w , such as *(w)rd ‘to descend’, never double the final radical in their inflec-tion. 6 In fact, as is well known, the only roots in Akkadian that regularly doublethe final radical in their inflection are hollow roots, such as mâtum ‘to die’, with Gdurative 3mp imutt u and S infinitive s umuttum .To explain forms with doubling of the first z , such as the durative iz-za-(a-)az and the preterite iz-zi-iz , von Soden was forced to invoke an ill-defined root aug-ment n . If there was such a morpheme (and I doubt it), then it must have appearedon other originally biradical roots as well, as von Soden indeed claimed, in GAG §102a–b. But then why is the inflection of those roots not parallel to that of izuz- 6. In contrast to von Soden and a number of others, I myself am a firm believer in the originaltriradical nature of most “weak” roots in early Semitic (except perhaps for certain verbs “I– w ,” as justnoted). I am, however, willing to admit that the situation may have been more complicated at a pre-Semitic, or early Afroasiatic, stage. Yet there has been no adequate explanation of how Semitic rootsmight have “acquired” the “extra” radicals they exhibit. I am not at all convinced, for example, bythe reconstruction of monoconsonantal root augments proposed by C. Ehret, JAAL 2/3 (1989): 107–202. Nor is there, to my knowledge, a reasonable explanation of why w and y alone should beexcluded from the roster of original consonants that go into the composition of Proto-Semitic roots,especially when known Semitic phonological processes allow us to derive nearly all attested forms ofverbs “middle weak” and “final weak” in the descendant languages from roots X-w-X and X-y-X androots X-X-w and X-X-y , respectively. Indeed, contrary to the view held by von Soden (see, e.g., GAG §§50c, 73a–c), Akkadian is one of the Semitic languages, along with Geºez, that most clearly indicateroots with w and y rather than with vocalic elements.In any case the analysis offered here is based on known Akkadian morphology and phonologicaldevelopments and on well-established analogical processes. It proceeds from paradigms of so-called“hollow” roots as these are attested in Akkadian and does not depend on whether these are consid-ered originally to have been CvC or Cw/yC . being based on a root *zwz , used, like quadriliterals, in the IV stem for the normal meaning.” I.

We may not assumethat prehistoric languages behave differently than known languages.Von Soden also dismissed writings such as durative iz-za-a-az, with an extravowel-sign, as pausal forms; yet such writings are indeed typical of hollow verbs7and rarely met with otherwise, even “in pause.”Finally, von Soden’s alternatives to Poebel’s proposals concerning these verbsare linguistically unsatisfying, for at least two reasons. First, they require the assump-tion, for both izuzzum and itulum, of a set of nearly homophonous suppletive roots,ziz/nzz/siz/tiz for the former and nil/til for the latter; while suppletive roots are acommon enough phenomenon, even in Semitic (e.g., ntn/yhb in some Aramaicdialects), the near homophony of these biforms suggests a failure in analysis andreconstruction. Secondly, von Soden’s alternatives assume, obviously, “irregular” ornon-paradigmatic verbs for Proto-Akkadian, and thus probably for Proto-Semitic,when it is otherwise unnecessary to posit such forms for other early Semitic lan-guages or, therefore, for common Semitic.The question of non-paradigmatic forms requires some comment.8 Althoughvery few, if any, forms of itulum are non-paradigmatic (i.e., fail to conform to theexpected paradigm of the Gt of a root n-y-l; see further below), it cannot be deniedthat in nearly all the dialects the forms of izuzzum do not conform to any oneotherwise-normative paradigm. This does not, however, mean that such forms (orthe paradigm of izuzzum in general) were irregular in origin. Indeed, when we7. See also the comments of C. Wilcke, ZA 80 (1990): 298: “Schreibungen wie diese ([iz]-za-a-az) [in VS 22 20:6u] zeigen, daß izuzzum, das (im Präsens) wie die Verba mediae vocalis vor Vokalden letzten Konsonanten längt, analog zu diesen das Präsens ohne vokalische Endung mit langem a(oder â) bildet.”8. Besides izuzzum and itulum, the other allegedly irregular verbs discussed by von Soden in ZA50 (and resumed in GAG §107n–v) are (3) nadanum ‘give’, (4) naªadum ‘pay attention’ and nâdum‘praise’, (5) Assyrian *naßß ‘carry’, and (6) utlellûm ‘raise oneself’. The only non-paradigmatic forms ofnadanum are the Assyrian durative iddan, which is undoubtedly formed on the analogy of alakum (illik: iddin :: illak : X; see V. Christian, WZKM 33 [1926]: 143), and imperative din, which has apparentlylost its initial i-; the Assyrian nominal forms, infinitive tadanum, participle tadin- and verbal adjectivetadin-, must have arisen because of the ambiguity of the finite forms: the preterite iddin and the perfectittadin, at least, may be analyzed as forms of either n-d-n or t-d-n. As for naªadum and nâdum, vonSoden himself admitted (ZA 50, 174) that they are essentially regular, if subject to some confusion.The Assyrian forms of an apparent verb *naßß have of course been insightfully explained by S. Parpola(Assur 1/1 [1974]: 1–10) as the phonological reflexes of nasaªu ‘carry’, pronounced in Assyrian[nasa:ªu], with, e.g., perfect 3mp [ittasªu] = ittaßßu (see also R. Voigt, “A Note on the Alleged Middle/Neo-Assyrian Sound Change sª(*sª) > ss<ß>,” JNES 45 [1986]: 53–57). Finally, utlellûm is now prop-erly noted as the Dtr (Rt) stem of elûm in GAG3 §107v."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"John Huehnergard164look to other Semitic languages, we find no examples of “irregular” verbs whoseirregular features cannot be explained as the results of developments within thoseindividual languages. It is highly unlikely that only Akkadian inherited from com-mon Semitic one or two verbs with irregular inflections. Thus, we are led to try todiscover the original, paradigmatic nature of such verbs.Despite the difficulties encountered in von Soden’s view of these verbs, we arenevertheless grateful for his careful arrangement of their forms by both form and di-alect and for his discussion of the problems in Poebel’s presentation.As noted above, von Soden claimed that forms of izuzzum cannot wholly bederived out of any known paradigm. In fact, however, with the recognition of afew straightforward and well-motivated analogical developments, the attested formsof izuzzum can indeed be assigned to the conjugations that Poebel so insightfullyproposed.Let us begin, not with the unusual infinitive form izuzzum (see further below),but with the most commonly attested forms of the verb, the preterite iz-zi-iz andthe durative iz-za-(a-)az, both of which are attested, indeed, normative, in all dia-lects. Writings of the preterite form iz-zi-iz and pl. iz-zi-zu (the form with dou-bling of the second z, iz-zi-iz-zu, is uncommon in the early period; see furtherbelow) can of course be analyzed in several ways: as G of a verb nazazum, as Gt ofa verb ziazum, or as N of a verb zuazum/ziazum. The durative form iz-za-az (lessoften iz-za-a-az) might be Gt of zuazum or N of zuazum, or a form based analog-ically on illak ‘goes’. The intersection of these possibilities is the N of zuazum, i.e.,root *zwz/zyz (or, in von Soden’s terms, *zuz/ziz); this is confirmed by the formsof the durative with vocalic ending, in all of which the final radical is doubled, asit is in the durative of all stems of middle-weak verbs; in other words, pl. iz-za-az-zu corresponds to G forms such as idukku ‘they kill’, iqissu ‘they give’, and N formssuch as izzuzzu ‘they will be divided’9 and iqqippu ‘(which) is believed’. The me-dial vowel of izzazzu points to a verb that is inflected not like zâzum ‘divide’ anddâkum ‘kill’ with medial -u-, nor like qiasum ‘give’ and qiapum ‘entrust’ with medial-i-, but rather like bâsum ‘be ashamed’ and bâªum ‘walk along’, which exhibitthroughout their G stems a medial -a-10 and would thus be expected to exhibit amedial -a- in the N durative as well, were it attested for these verbs. For the N pret-erite, however, as for all other verbs with -a- in the G and N duratives, we expecta medial -i- (e.g., durative G ißabbat and N ißßabbat, but preterite N ißßabit), thus *id-dik (no examples yet attested), iqqip, and, accordingly, the common form izziz.Thus, the most commonly attested forms of izuzzum, found from the earliestdialects onward, conform precisely to the expected paradigm of a middle-weak,a–a class verb in the N stem: durative izzâz, pl. izzazzu; preterite izziz, pl. origi-nally izzizu (later also izzizzu on the analogy of the S and D stems of other middle-weak verbs; see further below).

L. Cagni; Naples, 1984), 225–55, esp. p. 252.This is formally quite unlikely, however."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"izuzzum and itulum169Clearly there are a number of forms that deviate from what is expected in theN, Ntn, and S stems of a middle-weak root.23 Most of these deviations can, how-ever, be accounted for by assuming three sets of uncomplicated and well-motivatedanalogical developments.(1)Doubling of the final radical z in N forms other than the durative, and thei of the N perfect ittaziz, are due to analogy with the corresponding S forms ofizuzzum and other middle-weak verbs.On the basis of the close affinity between the G and the N stems in the par-adigms of other verbs, we should expect the G and N stems of middle-weakverbs to pattern similarly. Thus, since in the G of middle-weak verbs onlythe durative forms exhibit doubling of the final radical with the addition ofa vocalic ending (e.g., plural dur. idukku, vs. pret. iduku, perf. idduku, imv.duka; infin. dâkum, verbal adj. dik-), we should assume that the same wastrue of the forms of the N.24 The common early spellings of the N preteriteas iz-zi-zu, therefore, probably reflect the expected original form izzizu (soalso for the participle, on which see further below), whereas the doublingof the final radical in rarer, later writings of the preterite as iz-zi-iz-zu, andin the more frequent examples of the imperative (izizza), perfect (it-tazizzu), infinitive (izuzzum, etc.), and verbal adjective (e.g., with 3fs sub-ject, nazuzzat), is unexpected. This innovative doubling was undoubtedlyprompted by analogy with the S (and D) stem of middle-weak verbs, in-cluding the S of izuzzum, in all forms of which the final radical is regularlydoubled before a vocalic ending; thus, for example, given the S durative :preterite contrast usmat/usmattu : usmit/usmittu and uszaz/uszazzu : usziz/uszizzu, the corresponding N forms could be re-formed as izzâz/izzazzu :izziz/X = izzizzu. Analogy with the S (and D) stem is also the source ofthe unexpected i-vowel in the perfect of izuzzum: on the basis of the soundverb pattern ittapras, in which the vowel between the last two radicals is thatof the N (and G) durative, the form *ittazaz is expected; in ittaziz (etc.; forthe later forms, see below) we find the vowel of the preterite izziz, as is thecase in the S perfects (ustamit, ustaziz).23. Note that, apart from forms of izuzzum and the ubiquitous iddâk in CH, N forms of middle-weak verbs are quite rare, so that there are a good number of lacunae in our knowledge of the para-digm. It may be suggested that since such forms were relatively uncommon, the paradigm of izuzzumcould be perceived to be almost sui generis from the start; thus, the likelihood of new analogical for-mations, bringing it into line with more common structures, would have been quite high.24. This is the case with the Gt verb itulum: as the examples cited below indicate, only forms ofthe durative double the final radical (thus, e.g., 3mp ittillu vs. preterite ittilu). But forms of Gt itulumoccurred alongside G forms of the same verb (nialum/nâlum), whereas a G of the N verb izuzzum israrely attested (for possible examples, see further below). Thus, speakers could more readily associateforms of izuzzum with the corresponding—and well-attested—S stem, in which the doubling wasnormative (inherited from Proto-Akkadian)."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"John Huehnergard170(2)Certain S forms of izuzzum with an unexpected extra syllable after thestem-augment s, such as OA usazzaz rather than uszaz, are the result of analogieswith corresponding S forms of alakum; the Ntn of izuzzum has been similarly af-fected by the Gtn of alakum.S forms such as OB/SB durative uszaz and OAkk/OB/MB preterite uszizcorrespond to S forms of other middle weak verbs, such as usmat and usmit(as do the solitary SB St and peripheral MB Stn forms). Other forms inOAkk, OA, NA, and MB/SB/NB exhibit an a between the stem-marker sand the initial consonant (in MB with a > e as in similar forms, i.e., usapris> usepris). The OAkk writings such as preterite u-sa-zi-iz may denote /usa-ziz/, /usazˆz/, or /usazzˆz/; the second and third of these possibilities will beconsidered presently, in conjunction with OA forms; the first normalizationis admittedly unlikely, but could, theoretically, at least, reflect either an ar-chaic pattern that has failed to undergo syncope for some reason, or an in-novative pattern formed on the analogy of the sound verb, usapris. In theOA forms, the a does not undergo vowel harmony and is therefore prob-ably not a short vowel in an open syllable.25 Further, in the durative pl.form ú-sa-zu-zu the penultimate syllable does exhibit vowel harmony, indi-cating that the final z is single. Since a form */usazuzu/ from */usazaz/ hasno analogues, we are undoubtedly to understand /usazzuzu/ from /usaz-zaz/, a form that must have been generated on the analogy of usallak, the Sof alakum, an analogy made possible by the similarity of the basic forms ofthese two verbs: durative illak : izzâz, preterite illik : izziz.26 It is not clear25. Contrast the OA S imper. f. sg. of zuazum ‘divide’: sí-zi-zi = sizizzi < *sazizzi; see GAG3,p. 54*, Ergänzung to Paradigm 28.26. For Assyrian, it is also possible to propose an analogy with forms of tadanum ‘give’: G/N du-rative iddan : izzâz, preterite iddin : izziz, perfect ittidin : ittiziz, thus S usaddan : X = usazzaz. Butthis analogy does not obtain as thoroughly in OAkk and in Babylonian, where the durative inaddan/inaddin retained its original trisyllabic shape. (Indeed, it is likely that Assyrian iddan also came into be-ing by analogy with illak; see n. 8 above.) An analogy with alakum thus has broader application andgreater economy, being available in all stages and dialects of the language.The phonologically unexpected double -ll- in the G preterite illik (already attested in OAkk inwritings such as il-li-kam, tal-li-ik) and the double -tt- in the G perfect ittalak and in Gt and Gtn formsof alakum, rather than the single consonant and preceding long vowel expected in compensation forthe loss of the preconsonantal *h, as in other verbs I–ª (i.e., *yvhlik, *yvhtalak should have yielded**ilik, **italak), is difficult to explain but is almost certainly Proto-Akkadian. The G perfect/Gt pret-erite form ittalak of course calls to mind corresponding forms of active verbs I–w, such as ittarad,where the double -tt- is probably due to a Proto-Semitic phonological rule *wC > CC when C wasa dental (see C. Brockelmann, Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der semitischen Sprachen [Berlin,1908–13], vol. 1 §64; cf., e.g., the Arabic Gt of w ̇d, as in yatta ̇id- < *yawta ̇id-; further, probably,Hebrew yißßor < *yvwßur ‘fashion’ and similarly with a number of other Hebrew roots I–y and II–dental). But other parallels between alakum and verbs I–w are lacking. (The fact that both exhibittheme vowels a–i, which von Soden mentioned in ZA 50, 165, as of significance for izuzzum, is notrelevant. Since the a–i class must be reconstructed for Proto-Semitic, and since *hlk and at least someverbs I–w must have belonged to that class, as in Hebrew, the feature is simply vestigial and does not"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"izuzzum and itulum171whether the remaining S forms in OA are also patterned on the analogy ofsalukum, thus perfect /ustazˆz/, imperative /sazˆz/ and participle /musazˆz-/,or whether there is a doubling of the initial radical, thus /ustazzˆz/, /sazzˆz/,and /musazzˆz-/, as in later dialects (NA and MB/SB/NB), in which suchdoubling is graphically indicated, and which are the result of analogies toverbs I–n (see the next paragraph).27 Also analogous to forms of alakum arethe OB/SB iterative forms of izuzzum, in which the initial radical z is againunexpectedly doubled (the sound verb Ntn pattern ittanapras leads us to ex-pect *ittan(a)zâz); here too, the parallel illak : izzâz could readily have sug-gested ittanallak : X = ittanazzâz (and similarly imperative itallak : itazzaz,infinitive italluk- : itazzuz-, participle muttallik- : muttazziz-).28(3) Other forms with unexpected doubling of the first radical z arise throughanalogy with verbs I–n.As was just noted under (2), a number of S forms in late dialects, such as Spreterite usazziz, pattern after verbs I–n. There are at least two sourcesfrom which such forms could have arisen, i.e., forms that could have been(mis-)analyzed as I–n and thus generated other I–n-type forms analogically:there is first of all the basic preterite izziz, which might have been analyzedby some speakers as a preterite of a verb nazazum; more likely, however,the source is the S durative usazzaz, which, once it had been created on theanalogy of alakum, could also be taken as the S durative of a verb I–n,allowing an entire I–n-type paradigm to come into existence. A similarprocess, probably proceeding from the preterite izziz, may be responsiblefor the nominal forms mazzazum and mazzaztum (compare, e.g., iddin andmaddanum [rare], maddattum; ikkis and makkasu), in which the doubling of27. Similarly with the MA infinitive sa-zu-zi: /sazuz-/ or /sazzuz-/.28. But note that unlike the corresponding S and Gtn forms of alakum on which they are based,many S and Ntn forms of izuzzum continue to double the final radical, like most forms of the basicN paradigm of the verb.tie these verbs together in any historically meaningful way. The fact that *hlk and verbs I–w under-went phonological processes that made them paradigmatically unusual, in both Akkadian and Hebrew[and Aramaic], meant that these verbs escaped the general abandonment of the a–i class in those lan-guages. It is tempting nevertheless to compare this I–w-like form in Akkadian with the apparent I–wbehavior of Hebrew halak, but the similarity is probably fortuitous: in Hebrew the I–w behavior pro-ceeded from the imperative, where *hlik > *lik, after which the prefix-conjugation forms were re-shaped on the analogy of the corresponding verbs I–w [i.e., *rid : *yvrid :: *lid : X = yvlik], whereasin Akkadian the I–w behavior is restricted to the perfect and other -t- forms, which do not occur inHebrew.) Provisionally, I would suggest that the -t- forms of alakum, like those of verbs I–w, are theresult of a similar sound rule, viz., *ht > tt (e.g., in *yvhtalak > ittalak) and that this doubling was an-alogically transferred to the preterite as well, so that *yahlik was replaced by *yallik; it must be admit-ted, however, that other verbs I–*h are not similarly affected in their -t- forms (e.g., atwûm ‘to speak’,pret. itawu). (One might also think of a sound rule to explain the preterite, i.e., *hl > ll, but this iscontradicted, e.g., by alum ‘town’ < *ªahlum.)"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"John Huehnergard172the initial radical is otherwise difficult to explain, since N stem nouns withan m- prefix, apart from the N participle (mupparis-), are unknown inAkkadian.The noun nazzazum (later nanzazu) is, as von Soden suggests (GAG §56h), aninstance of the relatively rare napras pattern, the few examples of which are clearlyassociated with N finite verbs (naplasum, nalbabum).29 In nazzazum, too, as inmazzÅz(t)um, the doubling of the initial radical is unexpected and must have comeabout because some forms of the verb could be interpreted by speakers as derivingfrom a root I–n. In this case, however, the precise line of development is unclear;nazzazum has the appearance of an N stem noun of a root *n-z-z (unlike mazza-zum, which has the appearance of a G stem noun), and yet the only forms in theverbal paradigm that may be analyzed as N of *n-z-z are the late verbal adjectivenanz ̈z and the unique OB lexical form in-na-an-zi-iz. nanz ̈z may have come intoexistence alongside the earlier nazuz if the latter was perceived to be similar to Nforms of verbs I–ª, which in SB exhibit biforms such as nemud/nenmud (see GAG§97f). The OB form in-na-an-zi-iz appears in a grammatical text (OBGT X 73 =MSL 4 113:73), near the end of a list of equations of Sumerian gub with Akkadianizuzzum; the form, which is equated with Sumerian ba-ra-gub-bé, is apparentlyintended as a durative, like the following form and the preceding seven forms in thelist. As J. Black notes in his study of grammatical texts, both sides of the equationhere are unexpected;30 there seems to have been an attempt to “make up” an Nform of a verb that was no longer perceived, by this particular scribe at least, to bean N itself; i.e., innanziz must be a back-formation from izziz felt by the scribe tobe a G preterite of *nazazum.The participle vacillates between muzzazum, found in OAkk and OB, andmuzzizum, also attested in OB as well as in OA and MA. Since the participle in theAkkadian derived stems normally has the same base as the preterite (N ipparis/mup-paris, D uparris/muparris, S usapris/musapris; also in middle-weak verbs: D Bab.ukin/mukin, S usmit/musmit), the expected form is muzziz, with the same vocalismas preterite izziz. But the OAkk/OB muzzaz exhibits the same pattern as the Ar-abic N participle munqam, and may perhaps reflect an earlier Semitic form.31Certainly the most curious forms of the paradigm of izuzzum, attested innearly all of the dialects, are those with initial i-, namely the imperative iziz (pl.29. In GAG §56h (17a), von Soden suggested that napras functions as an alternative N infinitive,and in AHw, 773a, he listed three instances of nazzazum as N infinitives of izuzzum. In none of thecontexts do these forms function verbally, however, and so they should simply be considered verbalnouns, like naprust forms (GAG §56h (18b)).30. J. Black, Sumerian Grammar in Babylonian Theory (Studia Pohl, series major 12; Rome, 1984),30. Black says that “the form ba-ra-gub-bé = innanziz (X 73) is completely mystifying.”31. It must be admitted, however, that Arabic munqam shares its pattern with the prefix-conju-gation forms, such as the imperfect yanqamu, a pattern that also appears in Hebrew yikkôn < *yvnkanu.Further, Arabic munqam is both the active and the passive N participle. Thus, its value for comparisonwith the Akkadian muzzaz is uncertain."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"izuzzum and itulum173izizza), the verbal adjective izuz (with 3mp subject izuzzu), and of course the in-finitive itself, izuzzum, which von Soden termed “ganz unregelmäßig” (ZA 50,166). (Forms with initial u-, viz., infinitive and verbal adjective uzuzzum, as haslong been recognized, are secondary, the result of vowel harmony: i...ú > u...ú.32)Von Soden and others have, not unreasonably to be sure, compared the imperativewith forms of verbs I–n; thus, just as we find preterite iddin and imperative idin, wefind izzˆz and izˆz, as though the root were *nzz. But that comparison does notaccount for the forms of the infinitive and the verbal adjective with initial i-. Onthe other hand, those same forms would seem to present a major stumbling blockto Poebel’s interpretation of the paradigm as the N stem of a root z-w-z or z-y-z,for which we might expect imperative *naziz, and infinitive and verbal adjectivenazuz-, on the analogy of the sound verb forms, napris and naprus-, respectively. In-deed, although an imperative *naziz is not attested, we do find the verbal adjectivenazuz- in a few OB literary texts (altered to nanz ̈z- in later dialects, as notedabove); and one recently-published OB hymn offers the infinitive na-zu-u[z4-z]um(OECT 11 1:16).33 But how do we explain izuzzum? The answer, I believe, hasrecently appeared in an intriguing paper by D. Testen entitled “The East SemiticPrecative Paradigm.”34 It will be recalled that there are a number of Akkadian ver-bal forms that have apparently lost an expected initial n-, viz.,G imperative of verbs I–n: purus but uqur (naqarum); piqid but ikis (nakasum);Gtn imperative, infinitive, and verbal adjective of verbs I–n: pitarras butitaqqar; pitarrus- but itaqqur-; similarly in Gt forms of verbs I–n;Ntn imperative, infinitive, and verbal adjective of all verbal root types: itap-ras for expected *nitapras, itaprus- for expected *nitaprus-.Testen plausibly suggests a simple phonological rule: Proto-Semitic initial clusters#nCv became *iCv in Proto-Akkadian.35 I would propose that the forms of izuz-32. Besides the examples just mentioned, viz., uzuzzum < izuzzum (in the infinitive and verbaladjective; note that the imperative, iziz/izizza, never shows initial u-), and the corresponding utul(um)< itul(um), several other instances of this assimilatory change may be noted: the Gt imperative of qâlumin an OB name from Iscali, qutul for expected qitul (Greengus, OBTIV, p. 84), as noted by von Sodenin ZA 71 (1981): 150; the month name Elulum/Ululum; and the noun ußurtum ‘plan’, which appearsas ißurtum in OA and is thus originally a parus-t form *yaßurtum (Hecker, GKT §11a).33. See O. Gurney’s note to OECT 11 1:16, ibid., p. 18.34. JSS 38 (1993): 1–13.35. See ibid., p. 10. Testen actually suggests Proto-Semitic *n- > u / #__Cu... and > i /#__Ci/a..., to account for *nqur > uqur; I would suggest, however, that the rule was simply *n- > i /#__Cv..., and that the resulting *iqur became uqur either by a type of vowel harmony (as in izuzzum> uzuzzum, etc., for which see above, n. 32) or by analogy with sound verbs, in which the first vowelnearly always echoes the second (piqid, ßabat, purus).Babylonian Gt forms of verbs I–n do not fit the sound rule as Testen has written it, since, e.g.,the infinitive has the form pitrus-, so that itqur- would seem to derive from *nitqur-. But comparisonwith the Assyrian counterparts suggests that the bases were originally *ptarus- and imperative *ptaras,and so in verbs I–n *ntaqur- and *ntaqar; see Testen, loc. cit., p. 9, and R.

If thisline of development is correct, then iziz and izuz reflect the original, phonologi-cally historical forms of the imperative and the infinitive/vbl. adj. of the N ofzwz/zyz. It follows that nazuz-, the infinitive and vbl. adj. forms with na-, are sec-ondary developments; they would have arisen, as already hinted at above, throughparadigmatic leveling on the basis of the sound verb: naprus-, therefore nazuz-.37One form that does not fit the development just outlined for the forms withinitial i- is the OA infinitive, which is written i-zi-za-am (in the accusative).J. Lewy, in discovering this form, analyzed it as the G of a root *yzz and normalizedizezum.38 But the pattern iReRum is not attested for the infinitive of roots I–y inOA.39 Further, most other forms of the paradigm do not conform to a root I–y.Thus, Lewy’s interpretation of this form must be rejected. I must admit, however,that I am at a loss to explain the medial -i-.40In MB and later we find forms of izuzzum in which the root seems to be*sw/yz: perfect ittasiz, pl. ittasizzu; imperative isiz, pl. isizza; infinitive isuzzu; ver-bal adjective usuz, with 3mp and 3fs subject usuzzu, usuzzat. In NA, on the otherhand, we meet with forms in which the initial z is replaced by t and the final zsometimes appears as s: perfect ittitiz/s, pl. ittitissu (and a ventive form with anoma-lous loss of a medial long syllable, ittitzi, alongside the expected ittitizzi); imperative36. Comparing the verbal adjective nazuz-, W. G. Lambert, in Fs. Reiner, 196, also suggests thatizuzzum is derived from *nizuzzum “with dropping of the n- before -i, as regularly in the IV/3 in-finitive of the strong verb and in parts of verbs primae nun.”37. Despite the fact that only nazuz- is attested for the verbal adjective before MB, when izuz-/isuz- makes its first appearance. The rarity of these forms in general (since the durative izzâz was usedin all dialects in place of the predicate verbal adjective) means that we cannot state categorically thatizuz- did not occur in the earlier dialects.38. Von Soden also writes i-ze-za-am in AHw, 408–9; Hecker, GKT §100c, however, writesi-zi-za-am.39. See Hecker, GKT §93a (isarum), §97d (idaªum), and his note 3, ibid., p. 173.40. Von Soden, in the additions to AHw, 1564, suggests that izezum also occurs at Mari, in ARM2 55:12. The context is broken, however, and the copy militates against reading the first sign after thebreak in line 12 as i. [Addendum: Durand, Documents épistolaires du palais de Mari, vol. 2 (LAPO 17;Paris, 1998), 453, n. 57, reads line 12 as [a-ki-il ka-a]r-ßißí-ia im-ti-du-ma]."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"izuzzum and itulum175itiz/s, pl. itissa (and again an anomalously shortened ventive form: itzi < itizzi); in-finitive itussu. Several explanations for these forms have been suggested, but vonSoden was undoubtedly correct to see in them simply cases of dissimilation (ZA50, 166).41 In fact, if we may assume, as seems likely, that the writings in these di-alects in which the earlier z...z appears are archaisms or historical spellings, we maypropose that the newer forms reflect pronunciations resulting from the consistentapplication of a sound rule that operated in the same environment in both laterBabylonian and later Assyrian, but that produced a different result in the two maindialects, viz., z > Bab. s, Ass. t / v __ vz; in other words, the dissimilation takesplace only when the first z was intervocalic and not doubled.42 The Assyrian vac-illation between z and s as the final radical is probably simply a facultative devoicingof the final consonant, extended eventually as well to other forms of the paradigm.If we are right that the forms of the basic paradigm of izuzzum are N verbs, andthe iterative forms Ntn rather than Gtn, then the OB durative examples of the formi(t)-ta-za-az(-zu), which von Soden labels Gt verbs, must instead be Nt verbs. TheNt is an exceedingly rare stem; it did not appear at all in the first edition of GAG,and even the third edition calls its existence only “wahrscheinlich” (§95d*). Cer-tainly it is an Akkadian innovation within Semitic;43 in some instances it seems tofunction, like the Gt of certain G verbs, as a stem denoting the separative nuancefor verbs that appear lexically or commonly in the N stem, such as naprusum andnenmudum. Although von Soden normalized these OB forms ittazzaz, with the firstz doubled, none of the writings indicates a doubled zz; thus, perhaps the formshould be normalized as ittazâz (pl. ittazazzu), as we would expect from other Ntduratives (ittapras).Two last forms remain to be accounted for, viz., the precative forms li-za-zu(3mp), in an OAkk text, and la-za-az (1cs), in an MA text; these are unusual inhaving a medial a rather than the i that is both expected on the basis of the preteriteizziz and the imperative iziz and indeed found in several dialects, including anOAkk example (albeit written li-zi-iD; see below, n. 52). I would suggest that theseare vestigial G forms, lizazu and lazaz, exhibiting the same theme-vowel as the Ndurative izzazzu. We may note by way of comparison that the root p-l-s ‘see, look’,which occurs overwhelmingly in the N (naplusum), is also rarely attested in a very41. S. Bloch, Or. 9 (1940): 326, also suggested that the MB forms with s were the result of dis-similation.42. Woodington, Grammar of the Neo-Babylonian Letters, 149, proposes a similar rule for the NBforms. A probable exception to our rule is found in the MB text UM 1/2 16: 33a-na pa-an be-lí-ia a-naú-zu-uz-zi 34ma-am-ma ia-nu mu-sa-ªx-tu/liº ma-la be-lí i-du-ú 35it-ta-ßú-ú ‘there is no one to “stand”before my lord; all “those who stand(?),” whom my lord knows, have left’. The form in question isread mu-sa-ªzu-tuº by J. Aro, StOr 22, 116, followed by von Soden, AHw, 409a. The damaged thirdsign as copied does not resemble ZU in lines 33 and 35 closely, but it must be admitted that the read-ing makes good sense.43.

The non-occurrence of the verb in the G (with the possible ex-ceptions of the OAkk and MA precatives in a, just noted), is interesting, but by nomeans unique; we may compare, for example, naprusum, which is also found onlyin the N and the S.44 Though paradigmatically regular originally, the seemingly un-usual forms of izuzzum (unusual because N forms of middle-weak verbs wereotherwise uncommon) were prime targets for reanalysis as members of other para-digms, and analogical processes thus produced new forms not proper to the N andS of a middle-weak root, such as doubling of the final radical in certain forms ofthe N (originally proper only to the durative) and doubling of the first radical incertain forms of the S.45As to the precise shape of the original root, Poebel vacillated between *zwz,*zyz, and *zªz, preferring the first of these. Certainly the last can safely be dis-counted immediately, since in Assyrian, in which verbs II–ª and verbs II–w/y areconjugated differently (the former generally exhibiting a strong ª, as in isaªªulu),44. See GAG §90g; further, D. O. Edzard, “Die Stämme des altbabylonischen Verbums in ihremOppositionssystem,” in Studies . . . Landsberger (ed. H. Güterbock and T. Jacobsen, AS 16; Chicago,1965), 111–20, esp. pp. 115, 117 on N/S verbs. Hebrew also exhibits a number of lexically N-stemverbs: nôtar ‘remain, be left’ ~ hôtîr ‘leave over’, nißßab ‘stand’ ~ hißßîb ‘station’ (note the semantic par-allel with izuzzum); nisbaº ‘swear’ ~ hisbîaº ‘adjure’; see P. A. Siebesma, The Function of the Niphºal inBiblical Hebrew (Studia Semitica Neerlandica; Assen/Maastricht, 1991), esp. p. 96.45. Such “paradigm-shifting” is attested for other verbs in Akkadian. For example, the uncom-mon verb *sianum ‘urinate’ (Semitic root *q-y-n) is attested once in the G (SB, infinitive sânu) andseveral times in the Gt durative, istân and (subordinate) istinnu; at some point, the preterite Gt (or per-fect G) istin was reinterpreted as istin, the preterite of a root s-t-n, from which a new durative isattinwas generated. We may also point to a number of verbs originally II–guttural that have shifted to II–w/y, such as maªadum ‘be much’ (Semitic *m-ª-d), whose preterite imªid became imid and whose verbaladjective maªdum became madum in dialects such as OB; these were understood to derive from a verbmiadum, so that the perfect shifted from imtaªid to imtid and the durative from imaªªid to imiad; simi-larly riabum ‘replace’ from an original root *r-ª-b (irªib > irib, etc.), râdu ‘shake’ probably from a root*r-º-d (*yvrºud > irud), and Assyrian ruaqum ‘be distant’, from *r- ̇-q (which developed as expected inBabylonian into requm, and in the Assyrian D stem into reªªuqum); on these forms, see my study “Fur-ther South Semitic Cognates to the Akkadian Lexicon,” in Semitic Studies . . . Leslau (ed. A. S. Kaye;Wiesbaden, 1991), 697, 700. Conversely, the II–y verb hia†um is re-formed in OA as a II–ª verb,haªa†um (see Hecker, GKT, 158 n. 1), probably because of the ambiguity of the preterite ihi†, whichcould be analyzed as ihªi†. Similar metanalysis and paradigm-jumping is also attested in other Semiticlanguages in which individual forms are morphologically ambiguous, i.e., subject to interpretation asmembers of more than one paradigm; thus, e.g., in some Aramaic dialects the imperfect of geminateverbs is reshaped on the analogy of I–n verbs, because the m. sg. of their imperatives fall together (ºol‘enter’ < *full and pol ‘fall’ < *npul); many examples may also be cited from Hebrew, Geºez, and mostof the modern Semitic languages."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"izuzzum and itulum177izuzzum follows the pattern of verbs II–w/y. To decide between *zwz and *zyz ismore difficult. Since the inflection of izuzzum is like that of bâsum, the identity ofthe medial consonant is obscured (i.e., ibas may in theory derive from either*yvbwÅq or *yvbyÅq,46 unlike ikun < *yvkw ̈n and isim < *yv¶yˆm); the nominal de-rivatives of the root are likewise ambiguous with regard to the identity of the orig-inal middle radical.47 An etymological connection with zuazum ‘to share’, mootedby Poebel (pp. 179–82), seems most unlikely.48 We are thus forced to turn to possible cognate evidence for the etymology ofizuzzum. Poebel (pp. 182–89) compared the Mishnaic Hebrew/Jewish Aramaicverb zwz ‘to move away’ and the noun mÉzûza ‘doorpost’ (also in Jewish Aramaicas mÉzuzta); despite von Soden’s reservations (ZA 50, 169 n. 1: “wenig wahr-scheinlich”), this seems to me a very plausible suggestion. Further, it is bolstered bya probable Ugaritic cognate. In a persuasive article entitled “A Note on Ugariticndd–ydd,” published some fifty years ago, M. Pope suggested that the verbs in anumber of Ugaritic passages were best understood as N forms of a root d-w-d.49Most convincing are two passages in which this verb is in parallel to, or associatedwith, q-w-m ‘to stand’ (suffix-conjugation qm ... ndd in KTU 1.3 i 4, 8; prefix-conjugation ydd wyqm in KTU 1.10 ii 17);50 it seems clear that ndd/ydd in thesepassages also means ‘to stand’, and the parallel with Akkadian izuzzum, likewise Nof a middle-weak root, is striking.51 The Mishnaic Hebrew and Ugaritic verbs, if46. In the case of bâsum, of course, as probably also in the case of izuzzum, cognate evidenceshows that the root is II–w.47. Cf., e.g., makaßum < *makwaßum and the DN madanum < *madyanum.48. Poebel (pp. 176–79) also suggested a connection with a “pre-Akkadian” and Sumerian wordfor ‘base’, which he normalized zâzum; later spellings, however, show that the word is actually sassum(see the dictionaries) and thus not related to izuzzum. P. Haupt, “Ass. zâzu, halve, and Eth. azzáza,command,” Beiträge zur Assyriologie und semitischen Sprachwissenschaft 10/2 (1927): 264–67, also sepa-rated the roots of the verbs ‘divide’ and ‘stand’, but considered the root of the latter to be nz.49. JCS 1 (1947): 337–41. As Pope noted in an addendum at the end of his article, the samesuggestion had also been proposed some years earlier by F. Rosenthal in Or. 9 (1940): 293 n. 1 (re-view of C. Virolleaud, La déesse ºAnat). I wish to thank W. R. Garr for bringing Pope’s article to myattention.50. See M. Smith, “Poetic Structure in KTU 1.3 I 4–21,” UF 22 (1990): 317–19, esp. 318.51. Most later Ugaritologists seem to have overlooked, ignored, or tacitly rejected Pope’s sugges-tion for these (and other) passages, since his article is generally not cited (but see, inter alia, J. C.de Moor, The Seasonal Pattern in the Ugaritic Myth of Baºlu According to the Version of Ilimilku [AOAT 16;Kevelaer/Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1971], 71; C. L’Heureux, “The Ugaritic Rephaim Texts: CTA 20–22.Translations and Philological Notes,” Society of Biblical Literature 1977 Seminar Papers [ed. P. J. Achte-meier; Missoula, 1977], 287 with n. 16; J. C. L. Gibson, Canaanite Myths and Legends [2d ed.; Edin-burgh, 1978], 144; and the study of M. Smith cited in the preceding note). In a 1988 study,J. Tropper and E. Verreet, apparently unaware of Pope’s study, proposed precisely the same interpre-tation of the verbs discussed by Pope, as well as verbs in a few other passages, and also connected theUgaritic verb etymologically with Akkadian izuzzum; see their “Ugaritisch ndy, ydy, hdy, ndd undd(w)d,” UF 20 (1988): 339–50, esp. 346–47, 349."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"John Huehnergard178they are indeed cognate, as seems entirely likely, obviously indicate a commonSemitic root *D-w-D.52*****The case of itulum is considerably more straightforward than that of izuzzum.As noted above, Poebel, in a footnote to his izuzzum study (p. 105 n. 1), as-serted that itulum was simply the Gt stem of *n-y-l, a verb also attested in the G (asnialum and nâlum; see below), Gtn, D (rarely), and S stems. Poebel did not claimpriority for this view, but referred to Ungnad;53 Poebel did, however, flesh out thedetails in his long footnote.Von Soden’s response to Poebel’s discussion of itulum is puzzling. Stating thathe had to depart from “Poebels nicht in jeder Hinsicht zutreffenden Bemerkun-gen,” he simply reiterated his own belief that the root of itulum appeared in severalvariations (*nil, *nal, *til, and sometimes *nªl), without addressing at all Poebel’sclaim that the apparent *til forms were simply Gt verbs. And yet, as has alreadybeen suggested, nearly all forms may indeed be gathered under the cover of a singleroot n-y-l.

The Jewish Aramaic forms adduced by Poebel are undoubtedly loans from Hebrew. TheSemitic root *D-w-D would thus apparently be homophonous with the root from which Akkadianzuazum ‘divide’ is probably derived; see W. F. Albright, “Notes on Assyrian Lexicography and Ety-mology,” RA 16 (1919): 173–94, esp. 181, who associated the latter with Arabic Dada (dissimilatedfrom *DaDa) ‘drive, remove, ward off’ (cited by Poebel, p. 180, n. 1). It is tempting to suggest that thetwo OAkk examples in which a final stop is written, precative li-zi-iD and durative i-za-aD, mightreflect a similar dissimilation (presumably in a dead-end dialect), viz., lizzid ~ lizziz and izzâd ~izzâz. This at least seems to me more likely than that the writings reflect the original interdental D, aswas apparently hinted at by A.

As we have seen, vonSoden interpreted this alternation as reflecting two roots, *nil and *nal. It is muchsimpler, however, to suggest that these forms reflect but a single root, n-y-l, whichexhibited a variability in its theme-vowels, i.e., earlier *yvnyil- > inil or *yvnyal- >inal.61 There is a discernible dialectal distribution of these alternants: OAkk, OB,MB, and SB for the most part exhibit forms with -i-, whereas Assyrian and laterBabylonian (under the influence of Assyrian) generally have forms with -a-.62 It iswell known that other Akkadian verbs exhibit such variation across dialects.63In ZA 50, 169, von Soden suggested that in OB only the alleged root *til oc-curred. In the meantime, however, the verbal adjective nil- (both attributive nilum,in a lexical list, and predicative, subordinate nilu) has been attested; further, as sug-gested above (see n. 54), OB ittilam and ittilu in Gilg. P. are best taken as perfects ofnialum (although *tialum is of course not ruled out formally). Finally, OAkk nowattests the durative tanial. To be sure, forms of itulum are much more common thanforms of nialum in OB, but it does not then follow that the former is not simply theGt of the latter. Indeed, in most of the examples of itulum in the early dialects, es-pecially OB, the meaning is reciprocal, ‘lie with (itti) s.o.’, rather than simply ‘liedown (to sleep)’.64As to the forms of itulum itself, these correspond, as Poebel noted, precisely towhat we expect of a Gt verb from a root I–n and II–y.65 With the infinitive andverbal adjective forms itulum may be compared, e.g., the II–y form situmum, withits pattern R1ituR3um, and the I-n form itmusum, in which the initial radical n does61. In other words, the preterite inil reflects the a–i class, like qiapum, whereas inal reflects thea–a class, like bâsum. As in bâsum, the expected durative form of the a–a class has been replaced ana-logically; i.e., for bâsum we expect **ibuas < *yvbawwaq, but the latter has been superseded by analogywith preterite forms: iqis(u) : ibas(u) :: iqias/iqissu : X = ibaas(ibâs)/ibassu. Similarly, once preterite inalis extant (see the next note), expected inial < *yvnayyal is supplemented by inâl/inallu.62. It is unlikely that the variation in theme-vowel patterns goes back to Proto-Akkadian.Rather it is probably a development within the dialects. Note the OA verbal adjective nal, which isundoubtedly original. It may be suggested that the G forms of the verb were originally similar to thoseof †iabum, viz., pret. i†ib(u), dur. i†iab/i†ibbu, verbal adj. †ab; thus, pret. inil(u), dur. inial/inillu, verbal adj.nal. The parallel between nal and bas could well have triggered the rise, in Assyrian, of other forms ofnialum patterned on the corresponding forms of bâsum, thus inal(u), inâl/inallu; conversely, the lesscommon pattern of the verbal adjective nal could readily have given way in Babylonian to the moredominant one of nil. In both cases the developments are essentially paradigmatic levelings.63. See J. Aro, Die Vokalisierung des Grundstammes im semitischen Verbum (StOr 31; Helsinki,1964); B.

The form ittatil with its two ts, attested severaltimes in CH, is simply the Gt perfect (iptatras). Thus, both semantically and for-mally, there can be no doubt that itulum is the Gt of nialum.Gtn forms were listed by von Soden under itulum in AHw and GAG (§107j),though he noted elsewhere (ZA 50, 171) that at least some Gtn forms could be as-signed to either of his alleged roots *til or *nil. Again, we may simply note that theattested examples exhibit the forms expected of the Gtn of nialum. The few formswith medial ª, such as NA pret. atteªªila and SB ptcpl. muttaªªilutu, are of coursepatterned after verbs II–ª rather than verbs II–y, but some overlap between thesetwo root types in the derived stems is not uncommon in the later dialects.67 A soleexample, SB li-ta-til, attested twice in the Sultan-tepe copy of “Nergal and Ereski-gal,” does not fit this view, but is hardly sufficient grounds to dismiss it. As with theLB S form lultil, discussed above, this Gtn form was probably coined by a scribe onthe analogy of ittil, taken to be from an ad hoc root *tâlu (*tialum).68A number of examples of *n-y-l are attested in the lexical lists from Ebla.

M. Krebernik, however, has arguedthat both of the last two examples are to be assigned to a root n-h-l or n- ̇-l.73No etymology is proposed by von Soden for itulum, nâlum, or nialum. Un-doubtedly, however, P. Fronzaroli is correct that we are to connect Akkadian n-y-lwith Hebrew and Ugaritic l-y-n ‘to spend the night’, and that both in turn are de-rived from *layl(ay)- ‘night’, with dissimilation of one of the two ls.74The question naturally arises as to whether the average speaker of, say, OB rec-ognized izuzzum as the N of zwz and itulum as the Gt of nialum. It might be sug-gested that the presence of izuzzum and of itulum as infinitives in lexical listsindicate that the sense of the original paradigms had been lost. But itulum may cer-tainly be compared with other Gt infinitives that appear in lexical lists, including,for example, the following:atmû (ª-w-w) ‘speak’ (see CAD A/2, 86);itmusu (n-m-s) ‘move away’ (see CAD N/1, 220b);situlum (s-ª-l) ‘consider’.75And if, as argued above, izuzzum is only marginally dissimilar from the phonolog-ically expected shape of the N infinitive of a verb II–w, then we may at least com-pare its presence in lexical lists to that of other lexically N verbs, such as naprusumand naplusum.76 On the other hand, the number of analogical innovations to whichthe forms of izuzzum were subject suggests that the etymological origin of the verbmay not have been apparent to most speakers. And quite probably the made-up“neo-N” form innanziz in the OB grammatical text indicates that forms like izzâzand izuzzum were not perceived, by that scribe at least, as N forms. In the end, onehas the sense that the original nature of itulum as part of the paradigm of nialum wasnot forgotten, but that izuzzum rather early became detached from its etymologicaland paradigmatic moorings.72.

I 63–91). 2 The oppression episode is first narrated by the poet (63–77) and is then placed in the mouth of the gods, who repeat it almost verbatimwhen they bring the people’s complaint to Anu (81–91). The oppression episodeappears here as the ultimate cause for the creation of Enkidu, whose role in the epicis to challenge Gilgame s and put an end to his tyrannical conduct.The other source elaborating on the theme of the oppression is the Sumerianepic “Gilgame s , Enkidu and the Netherworld” (GEN), where Gilgame s is de-scribed as oppressing the young men of Uruk through some sort of game or athleticcontest that was played with two objects of unknown nature, called in Akkadian pukku (Sum. F i s ellag) and mekkû (Sum. F i s e.kid -ma). At the complaint of thepeople, the gods caused the pukku and the mekkû to fall into the netherworld(GEN 149–67). This, in turn, brought about the death of Enkidu, who volun-teered to descend there and retrieve the above objects for his master (GEN 177ff.). Both sources have long been available in relatively reliable editions: The Akka-dian source has been recently edited by Wilcke in his survey of the prologues ofAkkadian epics; 3 for the Sumerian source, see Shaffer’s careful edition of GEN, 1. This study is a revised version of a paper, read before the 203d meeting of the American Ori-ental Society, which took place in Chapel Hill, April 1993. In my lecture, I dedicated the paper toThorkild Jacobsen, who had officiated as the President of the AOS during the previous year and at-tended my lecture. I now duly dedicate the paper to his cherished memory.2. Line numbering follows my own reconstruction of the Gilgame s epic (cf. S.

This stateof matters may be justified for the Akkadian source, which is still slightly damagedand can therefore not be fully reconstructed. For its part, the Sumerian source, inspite of its completeness, has for a long time defied a connected translation; 5 onlyin its most recent translations has it acquired a reasonable sense. 6 In the following discussion I would like, first, to indicate briefly the various hy-potheses put forward concerning the nature of the oppression according to theAkkadian epic. Following this, I will suggest an improved and more complete ren-dering of the oppression episode in the Sumerian source. Finally, I will take a newlook at the problem of the relationship between the late Akkadian version of theoppression motif and its earlier Sumerian parallel. In my survey of the various in-terpretations of the Akkadian source I am greatly indebted to Tigay’s aforemen-tioned discussion of the “oppression” episode in his study of the Gilgame s epic. 7 As Tigay points out, one of the most elusive problems of the Akkadian Gil-game s epic is the question: how did Gilgame s oppress Uruk? The most commonview has been that the oppression involved the imposition of corvée labor. 8 Tigayrejects this view on the ground that the epic does not use any of the standardAkkadian terms for corvée labor. 9 4.

On the one hand, he admits that “the text does not specifythat the purpose for which the girls are taken is sexual; conceivably they weredrafted for domestic service.” 11 On the other hand, he states that “it is hard to be-lieve that jus primae noctis is not at least part of what is suggested in I, ii, 7–28.” 12 But, whether or not we restore [ ana ha ªiri s a ] or [ ana umm is a ] at the end of Gilg.I 72 (=90), or take m a rat qur a di hi rat e † li (line 77) as the direct object of the verb uluma ss ar , the whole passage cannot possibly refer to the sexual abuse of the brides,since after exercising the jus primae noctis , Gilgame s did release the brides to theirhusbands!

The onslaught of his weapon verily has no equal” (Gilg. I 63–65).Thus “he constantly terrifies the young men of Uruk by (his) tyranny” (line 67).

Note that Roll-inger translates the key terms lirum3 and Fespu2 (Fesba2) as “Wettlauf ” and “Ringkampf,” respec-tively.

I believe that, after a careful reexamination of the Sumerian source, wecan arrive at a more balanced view as to the relationship between the two sources.A new study and a revised translation of the pukku and mekkû incident in GEN149–68 lead to the following reconstruction of the plot:Gilgames cut down the huluppu-tree and had its trunk made into a throne anda bed for Inanna. Subsequently, he fashioned from the base or roots of the tree apukku, and from its branches, a mekkû (lines 149–51). Landsberger first interpretedthe pukku and the mekkû as a “drum” and a “drumstick,” respectively. Later, hechanged his mind and opted for a “hoop” and a “driving stick.” Finally, he pre-ferred to see in the pukku a kind of wooden ball or puck, and in the mekkû, a stick,a type of mallet, suggesting that these served as playthings for a game such as poloor croquet.21 In agreement with Landsberger, Jacobsen, Tigay, and Ann Kilmer, Iassume that the Sumerian text appears to refer to a game similar to polo, croquet,or hockey.22 In my opinion, the most suitable candidate for identification with Gil-games’s game is polo, which apparently originated in prehistoric Egypt and later20. Tigay, Gilgamesh, 191.21. “Einige unerkannte oder verkannte Nomina des Akkadischen,” WZKM 56 (1960): 124–26;57 (1961): 23. The instrument rendered by Akk. pukku corresponds to Sum. Fisellag in all sourcesfrom all periods. Note that T. Jacobsen, who generally accepts Landsberger’s hypothesis as to the na-ture of the game, reads the above Sumerian word with a final nasal /F/ (i.e., FisellaF), and assumesthat it refers to a kidney-shaped wooden puck; cf. “The Gilgamesh Epic: Romantic and Tragic Vi-sion,” in Lingering Over Words, ed. T. Abusch et al. (HSS 37; Atlanta, 1990), 234 n. 7. This identifi-cation, however, may be erroneous because Akk. kalitu “kidney” is always equated with ellaF2(= bir), never with ellag (= lagab). Note, further, that Sumerian Fisellag occurs only two moretimes in monolingual Sumerian literary texts. In SP Coll. 5.93 (= 3.95) we read: ur-gi7 Fisellag (var.Fisillar) ra-gim dum-dam ì-íb-za, “she grumbles like a dog hit by a ball (var. by a throwstick)”(cf. B. Alster, Proverbs of Ancient Sumer [Bethesda, 1997], 97, 138, and 387). The other attestation ofthis word is in Sulgi B 106, where Sulgi boasts of his expertise in hunting with missile-like weaponsthat are thrown by hand (cf. G. R. Castellino, Two Sulgi Hymns [Rome, 1972], 40:107; text citedfrom G.

Possibly the first organized sport ever played, the game may havebeen connected to fertility rites23 or training for war.24In light of the above information, it is not impossible that the game that wasplayed with the pukku and mekkû was originally connected with the cult of Istar,the goddess of fertility and love; but this is not at all certain.2523. Cf. Henderson and Kelley, “Polo,” 325a-325b: There are references to the so-called polo before and shortly after the beginning of theChristian era, in Egypt, Arabia and Persia, but the earliest authentic account of polo waswritten about the year 860 a.d. by al-Jahiz, who described events some 800 years before histime. These early games sometimes had as many as a thousand on a side. Cumulative evi-dence indicates that these large assemblies were not games, but folk fertility rites, usuallypracticed in the spring-time of the year . . . with the ball as a symbol of fertility. Started indim, prehistoric days in Egypt, where the ceremonies were on foot, they spread eastwardthrough Arabia and Persia. There the rites were adapted to the equestrian habits of the Per-sians. Later historians, writing hundreds of years after the events they recorded, undoubted-ly interpreted the earlier stories in the light of contemporary practice, by which time theexpert Persian horsemen were beginning to convert the religious rite into a secular game.24. Cf. “Polo,” The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. 14 (1974), 760:Polo . . . is the oldest of all equestrian sports and, according to some authorities, the oldestorganized sport of any kind. Definite historical references establish that polo was beingplayed in Iran (Persia) during the 1st century ad. Some scholars claim an even earlier birthof the game and credit the Persians (i.e., the Elamites?) with its invention as far back as2000 bc. In any case . . . the game is definitely of Oriental origin. In its early forms, it wasless a sport, in the modern sense of the word, and more a training game for Oriental cavalryunits, usually to the king’s guard or other elite mounted troops. Indeed, to the warliketribesmen, polo was a miniature battle with as many as 100 “players” to the side.25.

CAD M, sub mekkû A). Cf. Groneberg, RA 81 (1987): 121ff.Note that Kilmer, Zikir sumim, 129f., tends to see in the pukku and mekkû male sexual symbols,symbolizing the insatiable energies and the (homo)sexual appetite of Gilgames, and she assumes thatthis game is particularly connected with wedding ceremonies.recently also by Tournay-Shaffer, Gilgamesh, 47 note x; 255 note m, and George, Gilgamesh, 183. VonSoden keeps Landsberger’s first rendering of pukku and mekkû and sees in them a drum and a drum-stick, respectively (cf. AHw 642, 878). According to M. Duchesne-Guillemin, drums in the ancientNear East were never played with drumsticks. In her opinion, the above terms should rather refer toa type of “scraper” (i.e., to “an implement with a series of notches cut in”) and a stick that served formaking a rattling and rhythmic noise (cf. “Pukku and Mekkû,” Iraq 45 [1983]: 151ff.). For a recentbut inconclusive discussion of these terms, see B. Groneberg, “Tilpanu = Bogen,” RA 81 (1987): 121ff.It is interesting to note that the ball for outdoor polo is usually made from willow root (cf. R. D.Henderson and R. F. Kelley, Encyclopaedia Americana [1969], vol. 22, 325b, sub “Polo”). Gilgames, ac-cording to the Sumerian epic, also fashions the pukku (ball) from the roots of the huluppu-tree. Al-though there is a tendency to identify this tree with the “oak” (see the Akkadian dictionaries), sincethis tree grew on the bank of the river, the possibility cannot be excluded that in our myth it shouldbe identified with the willow."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Jacob Klein194Gilgames is very proud of the new playthings. He takes them out to the citysquare and there plays proudly (lines 151–52)26 and vigorously with them togetherwith the young men of his city (line 153) from morning until evening. It seemsthat he never tires in his play and easily wins all the games. Why?The reason he prevails in the game seems to be given by line 154, which readsas follows:e-ne erin2-dumu-nu-mu-un-su-a-ke4-ne íb-ba u5-a27I propose to translate this line as follows: “While he (= Gilgames) was riding/mounted on the backs of a group of widows’ sons . . .”28As has been pointed out above,29 polo is assumed to have been played in an-cient times on foot, then later, on horseback. Now, if we are justified in identifyingGilgames’s game with polo or its antecedent, it was certainly played on foot. Theonly one who had the privilege of playing the game while mounted was the king,Gilgames. However, instead of riding on a horse or on a donkey, Gilgames seemsto have been mounted on the backs of his subjects, one at a time, while playing thetiring game. We may further assume that Gilgames did this by pressing his feetaround the hips (íb) of the human “horse,” holding on to his neck (gú) by his left26. We take the verbum operandi d u11-du11(-g) in lines 151–53 as denoting “to play,” perhaps el-liptic for e-ne du11(-g), Akk. melulu (see already Shaffer’s rendering in “Sources,” 106, line 153).im.di (var. ka.di) is to be read ní-silim, which corresponds to Akk. tasrihtu, sutarruhu. It is not im-possible that in line 152 we have the full form of this word: ní-silim du11-du11(-g); cf. J. Klein,Three Sulgi Hymns (Ramat-Gan, 1981), 215f.For a radically different rendering of GEN 151–52, see Pascal Attinger, Eléments de linguistiquesumérienne: La construction de du11/e/di “dire” (Göttingen, 1993), 676. Attinger equates ní-silimdu11-du11-ge in line 152 with Akk. sutarruhu, and takes al-du11-du11-ge in lines 151 and 153 as aparticipial form of the compound verb al-du11(-g), Akk. eresu. Consequently, he renders lines 151–52 as follows: “Lui qui désirait sans cesse un ellag, joue de l’ellag au carrefour, lui qui ne cessant defaire son propre éloge fait son propre éloge au carrefour.”Tournay-Shaffer, in their recent translation of GEN 151–52 (Gilgamesh, 254), take the verbdu11-du11(-g) as a synonym of dím in line 150 and accordingly render lines 151–52: “Il faconna laboule et l’apporta sur la grande place; ayant faconné le (maillet), il l’apporta sur la grande place.” Theabove translation seems to ignore the obscure complex im.di (var. ka.di), which recurs twice in line152.27. This line, according to Shaffer’s edition (”Sources,” 67), is furnished by three texts:3N-T124:26 (P): e-ne erin2 dumu-nu-mu-un-su-a-k[a í]b?-íb u5-aBE 31, 55:20 (S): [e-n]e erin2 dumu-nu-mu-un-su-a-ke4-ne íb?-x ªu5º?-[x]UET 6, 56:27 (r): e-ne erin2 dumu-nu-mu-un-su-a-ni íb-ba u5-a.28. Literally: “he—of a group of widows’ sons—on their hips mounted” (note the “anticipatorygenitive”). íb = qablu; u5 = rakabu. Shaffer consistently reads the complex íb-ba-u5-a as a finite ver-bal form with the prefix chain i-ba-. In his 1963 edition of GEN, he failed to translate this allegedverbal form. In their 1994 translation of GEN, Tournay-Shaffer render the line as follows: “lui, ilmonte à califurchon sur les jeunes enfants des veuves!” (Gilgamesh, p. 254).For a radically different interpretation of this whole episode, see Jacobsen, Treasures, 212.29.

Thus he never grewtired and was able to play from sunrise to sunset without stop.30 But alas, the hu-man horses, the poor orphans, became extremely tired, if they actually did not passout; they constantly complained: “Oh, my neck, oh my back!” (line 155). The ty-rannical Gilgames paid no heed to their complaints, and he did not give them a restall day long,31 so that the mothers and the sisters of these orphans had to providethem with food and drink on the playground (lines 156–57). When evening came and it grew dark, Gilgames marked the place where theball had stopped (lines 158–59), probably in order to resume the game the next dayat that point. Then he picked up the precious ball and carried it home for thenight.The poor orphans could not bear this oppressive athletic game, and at nighttheir mothers (the widows) and sisters (the young girls) cried out to the gods forhelp (lines 162–63). The gods, in accordance with the universal rules of justice andthe literary pattern of oppression, outcry, and divine response,32 responded to theoutcry. As a result, the next morning when Gilgames came back to the markedplace in the city square and mounted the orphans’ backs in order to continue hiscruel game (line 161), the gods caused his ball and mallet to fall to the bottom ofthe netherworld (line 164).33 Thus they put an end to the orphans’ suffering.Frustrated, Gilgames tried to reach out for the instruments with his hands andfeet, but without success (lines 165–66). Having realized that he had lost his play-things, he sat down at the gate of the netherworld34 and began to cry and lament(lines 167ff.).35In view of the above interpretation of the Sumerian source, I cannot agreewith Landsberger and those who follow him that the Akkadian poet completelymisunderstood his Sumerian source and misinterpreted the term pukku in this30. See also Tournay-Shaffer, Gilgamesh, 255f. note n, for a very similar interpretation of the na-ture of Gilgames’s conduct in this game. 31. The poor boys were probably taking turns carrying their master in the game.32. For the pattern of “oppression, outcry, and divine response,” see Tigay’s discussion, Gilga-mesh, 180.33. Reading dúr-kur-ra-sè. dúr = suburrum, isdum, saplum, and warkatum. Shaffer (“Sources,”69) read tus-kur-ra-sè and translated (ibid. 106) “to the realm of the netherworld.”34. Cf. line 167: abul-ganzir igi-kur-ra-ka dúr im-ma-ni-in-Far. This line is inter-preted by Shaffer (“Sources,” 106) as referring to the pukku and mekkû. Accordingly, he translates: “Atthe gate of Ganzir, the ante-room of the netherworld, it came to rest.” For the present interpretation,see the following note.35. If we are right in assuming that the pukku and the mekkû fell to “the bottom of the nether-world” (line 164; cf. n. 33 above), it seems unlikely that they came to rest at its front. Hence we haveto assume that line 167 refers to Gilgames and is to be translated: “At the gate of Ganzir in front ofthe netherworld he sat down” (= dúr im-ma-ni-in-Far). For the literary cliché of sitting downand crying, see also Gilgames and Huwawa 152f-152g (D. O. Edzard, “Gilgames und Huwawa A.

I ii10) of the epic as follows: ina pukkisu tebû ruªusu “On account of his ball (game) hiscompanions are (constantly) aroused!”37 If the above rendering is correct, and if webear in mind that the lines in the Akkadian epic that refer to the oppression of theyoung men of Uruk (lines 63–74) concentrate on nothing but the physical strengthof Gilgames, we come to the conclusion that both the Sumerian epic and the lateAkkadian epic basically refer to the same theme: the oppression of the people ofUruk through athletic contests.However, in spite of the basic similarity between the Sumerian prototype andthe Akkadian epic, there are still fundamental differences between the two sources.The Sumerian epic portrays Gilgames as a petty ruler of a small, provincial city-state who oppresses only one limited social group of his citizens through his obses-sion with athletic contests. Since he does not possess absolute power, he oppressesand exploits only the orphans, a socially weak and vulnerable group, who have nopaternal protectors. With these acts he neglects, violates, and abuses his royal du-ties, since in ancient Mesopotamia it was the duty of the king especially to protectorphans and widows.38 Furthermore, the whole oppression episode in the Sumer-ian epic seems to have lasted only one day. The quick and efficient response of thegods to the people’s complaint is self-understood, if we bear in mind that the out-cry came from the widows, a social group under special divine protection.In contrast, the late Akkadian epic portrays Gilgames as a great king of a pow-erful city-state, with absolute power over the entire population. According to thissource, Gilgames subjugates and oppresses the entire population, and his tyrannyaffects both men and women. The oppression of the males still consists mainly ofathletic and military contests, and the special pukku and mekkû game is still echoedin one concise line of verse (line 66). This line refers only to the pukku “ball,”36. Landsberger reads in line 66 ina puqqisu and translates the line accordingly: “seine Genossenstehen (in Bereitschaft), seiner Befehle harrend” (WZKM 56, 125 n. 49). Similarly, Tigay (Gilgamesh,190): “his companions stand (in readiness) heedful of him.” This erroneous interpretation gained pop-ularity among recent translators of the epic; cf. M. Gallery Kovacs, The Epic of Gilgamesh (Stanford,1989), 4:55; J. Bottéro, L’épopée de Gilgames (Paris, 1992), 67:55; Tournay-Shaffer, Gilgamesh, 46:12.37. So already A. D. Kilmer, Zikir sumim, 130. Similarly von Soden translates this line: “Durchseine Trommel sind daurend im Gang seine Gesellen,” Das Gilgamesch Epos (Reclam3; Stuttgart, 1989),17:10; so also C. Wilcke: “Durch seine Trommel sind [seine] Genossen (stets) aufrecht,” ZA 67(1977): 207:55; and F. Malbran-Labat, “A son tambour, ses compagnons doivent se lever,” Gilgamesh:Presentation, traduction et notes (Paris 1992), 9:10.38. This motif is attested in Sumerian and Akkadian law codes, reform texts, and literary textsfrom the time of Urukagina of Lagas and Urnammu of Ur. Cf. Ukg. 4, 12:23–25 (= 5, 11:30–12:1)nu-siki nu-ma(-nu)-su lú-á-tuku nu-na-Fá-Fá-a, “That the orphan and the widow not bedelivered to the mighty man”; Codex Urnammu 162–65: nu-siki lú-níF-tuku-ra ba-ra-an-Far nu-mu-un-su lú-á-tuku-ra ba-ra-an-Far, “The orphan was not delivered up to thewealthy man; the widow was not delivered up to the mighty man” (cf. J. J. Finkelstein, “The Lawsof Urnammu,” JCS 22 [1969]: 68).

On the other hand, one can hardly detectin the whole episode an explicit or implicit reference to heterosexual or homo-sexual abuses. Finally, it should be observed that there is a perfect correspondence betweenthe problem created by Gilgames’s behavior and its divine solution. Since, accord-ing to the Akkadian epic, the oppression takes gigantic proportions and involvesmore than a particular game with a particular set of implements, its elimination re-quires more radical measures: The insatiable and energetic tyrant has to be re-strained. This aim can be achieved only by creating a match for him, a man whosephysical strength equals that of the oppressor and whose friendship and love willtake possession of him and absorb all of his attention. This is the special and sophis-ticated role that Enkidu plays in the Akkadian epic, which has no counterpart inany of its Sumerian sources.Appendix1.

The pukku and mekkû are a formulaic pair of words, and hence, associatively, the pukku canstand for both of them. This assumption is borne out by the Sumerian epic itself. At the main turningpoints of the story, both terms appear in parallelism (cf. GEN 149–50; 164; 169; 175–76; 179–80).Occasionally, however, the poet refers only to the pukku, e.g., when he describes the game on thebroad square (lines 151–60), or when he quotes Gilgames’s lament of the loss of his playthings (lines170–71)."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Jacob Klein198161 á-gú-zi-ga-ta ki Fis-hur in-hur-ra íb-ba u5-a162 su-dù-dù-a nu-mu-un-su-a-ta163 i-dutu ki-sikil tur-ra-ta164Fisellag-a-ni ù Fise.kid-ma-ni dúr kur-ra-sè ba-da-an-sub165 su-ni mu-ni-in-du11 sá nu-mu-un-da-du11166 Fìr-ni mu-ni-in-du11 sá nu-mu-un-da-du11167 abul ganzir(igi.kur.za) igi kur-ra-ka dúr im-ma-ni-in-Far168 dgilgames ír im-ma-an-pà sex(sig7)-sex(sig7) ì-Fá-Fá149 He, himself, has made its base/root into his ball,150 Its branches he made into his mallet. 151He plays with the ball, he brings the ball out in the broad square.152 He plays with it proudly, he brings it out proudly in the broad square.153 The young men of his city, who were playing with the ball—154Since he (= Gilgames) was riding on the backs (lit. hips) of a group of widow’s sons—155 Lament: “Oh, my neck, oh, my back (lit. hip)!”156He who has a mother—she brings her son bread;157 He who has a sister—she pours water for her brother.158 After evening had arrived,159 He drew a mark at the place where the ball settled down.160 He lifted the ball before him, and brought it to his house.161 At daybreak, while he was (again) riding on their backs at the place where he had drawn the mark,162 At the widows’ complaint,163 At the young girls’ outcry,164 His ball and his mallet fell down to the bottom of the netherworld.165 He stretched out his hand—but he could not reach them,166 He stretched out his foot—but he could not reach them;167 At the gate of Ganzir, in front of the netherworld, he sat down.168 Gilgames burst into tears, was grievously crying: . . . 2.

G. Lambert A hitherto unpublished fragment of text is given here in honour of one whowould have delighted in its manifold problems and would have (no doubt) solvedmore than are solved here. It is the upper portion of a tablet in the British Museum,published by kind consent of the Trustees of that institution. It is BM 54716, fromthe 82-5-22 collection, for which collection see J. E. Reade in E. Leichty, Catalogueof the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum VI (London, 1986), xxxii–xxxiii. Ac-cording to this information our tablet could have come from Babylon or Sippar,but that is no help for the interpretation of the text. The lines on the reverse arecontinued on the left edge, but there is no colophon. Thus paleography and or-thography are the only means of dating the tablet. From the large but somewhatclumsy script and the spelling conventions of the Sumerian, it would appear thatthis is a late Old Babylonian or early Cassite-period tablet. The ni regularly lackingthe vertical wedges favours an early Cassite-period date, as does also perhaps the éwritten with three wedges (obv. 1), since this is not a cursive hand. Note that nin is written as sal + s u , and dam as sal + ma .The content is Sumerian and exorcistic. There is only one column on eachside, and more than half of the length of the tablet is preserved, so the completetablet may have had some 50 lines, of which the whole or part of 34 remain. Theobverse is devoted to Ki-sikil-líl-lá, the female demon, Ardat-lilî in Akkadian, andclosely related to the much later Lilith. There was a bilingual incantation seriesdealing with this demon in the late libraries, the remains of which are edited byS. Lackenbacher in RA 65 (1971): 119–54 (to which add K 13341?), but they offernothing directly relevant to our text. However, it is always possible that this seriesdid include a late duplicate of our piece that has so far not been recovered. Thewords which follow each mention of this demon in lines 2–10 of the obverse seemto offer praise. Though s u-tag-ga in line 4 could be either “adorned” or “af-flicted,” line 5 “she made charm/pleasure” is complimentary, as is the mention of“(being?) given ladyship” in line 6. The section is too damaged for a purposefultranslation, until a duplicate is found.The reverse offers a z i . . . h é-pà “be exorcised by” listing, covering the wholepantheon very briefly but with many obscurities. Since it is better preserved than "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" W. G. Lambert 204the obverse, a translation is given, but it is meant to be used only with the noteswhich follow.The question which arises from this tablet is whether the two sides come froma single incantation, from two related incantations, or from two incantations not ofthe same category. It is possible that the demon to be exorcised should be listed inlitany fashion with a string of epithets, one for each recitation of the name, and thatthen this demon should be exorcised by a listing of benevolent gods, with some fi-nal phrases to achieve the end sought. The final lines after the z i . . . h é-pà sec-tion, though not restorable so far, make a perfect conclusion to an incantation. Thefirst suggestion, then, is entirely possible. The other two possibilities take accountof the fact that z i . . . p à listings became a self-contained genre, at least for thelonger ones. E. Ebeling edited the three longest in ArOr 21 (1953): 357–403, as“Gattungen I–III” (Gattung IV is not related). The first and second are bilingualand in their present forms probably not older than the late second millennium b.c. But Gattung III is unilingual Sumerian and late Old Babylonian. However, it ismuch longer than our listing could have been when complete. The shorter z i . . .p à lists occur in incantations of different kinds, e.g., in an Udug- h ul incantation, CT 16, 13 11–28, dupl. LKU 28 1–5. Thus one must allow the possibility that inthe gap in our text a new incantation began, either about Ki-sikil-líl-lá, or of anentirely different category. In Ugarit, tablets have been found which offer togetheron one tablet incantations which belong to different genres in the late libraries,where the material is more systematically organized. Ugaritica V 17 is an example ofsuch diversity on a single tablet.One matter of general interest occurs. Gilgamesh appears among the nether-world gods, as would be expected. His name is written d gi s .gim -m a s as in theBabylonian pieces from Boghazköy, but the epithet “man of the boat [ . . . ]” isotherwise unknown. Gilgamesh is associated with a boat in the standard late ver-sion of Tablets X and XI, but there he uses the boat to cross the waters of deathand then abandons it and returns to Uruk. However, there is a general traditionthat Gilgamesh at death became a netherworld god, so perhaps in this tradition hereplaced Ur- S anabi as boatman of the netherworld river, ferrying people (mostlydead) across the waters of death. This idea can be supported from Tablet XI of thelate version, since Ur- S anabi was ordered off from his work with the boat and ac-companied Gilgamesh back to Uruk. Clearly another boatman was needed at thatmoment, and the position could have been kept ready for Gilgamesh. Urra = h ubullu IV 341–42 knows a boat of Gilgamesh: gi s má- gi s -kal-tuku =e-lep d gi s .gín -ma s gi s má- gi s -tuku = min min MSL V 179 However, all the boats of the immediately preceding gods listed in this source werethe ceremonial barges actually used in the cults in Babylonia at some period, or pe-riods, in history, and it is at least possible that there was a boat of this type for a cult"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" A Rare Exorcistic Fragment 205 of Gilgamesh in some town, perhaps Uruk.

Line 3 deals with Enlil’s and Ninlil’sultimate ancestors, Enki and Ninki, of which pair the second one seems to havedropped out here. For this ancestry, see the present writer in Ancient Cosmologies,ed. C. Blacker and M. Loewe (London, 1975), 50–55. Gattung II at the beginningoffers first Anu’s ancestry, then Enlil’s in En- Nin- pairs (E. Ebeling, ArOr 21[1953]: 381f.), but Gattung III, unfortunately damaged for the first seven lines,hardly has space for both ancestries, and the preserved “lands” in lines 5–6 cer-tainly allude to Enlil. Probably Gattung III had only Enlil’s ancestry in a short form,since it was traditional in Sumerian texts from at least the Fara period onwards (see"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"A Rare Exorcistic Fragment207P. Mander, Il Pantheon di Abu-Íalabikh [Naples, 1986], 109, 1–14 and 29, 273–88).Thus our text begins when first intelligible with Enlil, but the only other identifi-able god in the first nine lines is Utu/Samas in line 7. One could have expected atleast Sîn before Utu/Samas, and perhaps Iskur/Adad and Inanna/Istar after Utu/Samas. But instead there are the mysterious, repeated n a-du and pa-na, not tomention lá-búr-x in line 9. Without more knowledge speculation would be pur-poseless. The sun-god is written with an extremely rare name and sign, so it wouldbe unwise to dismiss n a -du and pa-na as corruptions at the present time.Rev. 7: For this name of Samas see the present writer in RA 76: (1982): 72, 6and note; also in BiOr 52 (1995): 89 (on p. 186 n. 341).Rev. 10–14: For the comparable netherworld section of Gattung II, seeE. Ebeling, ArOr 21 (1953): 387–88, lines 52–80, and for Gattung III, ibid., 396,lines 61–69. The latter, however, is extremely difficult to read, and Ebeling merelyemended the copy of Lutz in PBS I/2, 112. Thus, we offer here our own readingof the tablet, with a corrected line-numbering:63zi dnè-eri11-gal den-líl uru-gal-la-ke4 h[é]-64zi dnin-ki-gal-la nin-líl ki-gal-la-k[e4 hé]-65zi dnin-gis-zi-da gu-za-lá kur-ra-ke4 [hé]-66zi dnam-tar na-gal-mah kur-nu-gi-gi-da-k[e4 hé]-67zi dhus-bi-sa agrig kur-ra-ke4 hé-68zi dsár-sár-bi-id gír-lá kur-lam-ma hé-69zi dè-ta-na sukkal è-kur-idim-ke4 hé-70zi dil-ti-lam? a hi x x (x) hé?-71zi dig-sa-ur/ib/líl lú-si-gar igi.kur.za-[ke4 hé]-All the gods given in our tablet also appear in Gattung II (rev. 10 = 52; 11 = 56; 12= 70; 13 = 75; 14 = 79) with, however, others interposed. But while Gattung IIIhas nine gods to only five of our text, only three of the five are certainly the same(rev. 10 = 63; 11 = 64; 12 = 66). Our rev. 13, Bidu, might be the same god as themysterious dig-sa-ur/ib/líl of Gattung III 71, in view of similar function. Also III70, if monstrously corrupt (what we have read lam might possibly be -m e s), mightparallel rev. 14, but it is much too uncertain.An earlier Old Babylonian listing of netherworld gods occurs in one of the el-egies published first by S. N. Kramer, Two Elegies on a Pushkin Museum Tablet (Mos-cow, 1960), 54, lines 91–98, re-edited with duplicates by Å. W. Sjöberg, “TheFirst Pushkin Museum Elegy and New Texts,” JAOS 103 (1983): 315ff.

N. Kramer, “The Death of Ur-Nammu and his Descent to the Netherworld,” JCS 21 (1967): 114–15This was presumably composed soon after Ur-Namma’s death and so reflects Ur IIIideology. The high status of Gilgamesh in this list confirms the Ur III ideology,since he was intimately associated with the Ur III royal family. The lack of Etanahere is also perhaps significant, since he was a king of Kish, outside the cultural zoneof Sumer as understood during the Ur III dynasty. Thus, one may conclude thatthe incantation studied in this article was not composed under the Third Dynastyof Ur in Sumer. The Death of Gilgamesh also assigns an important position to Gil-gamesh in the netherworld pantheon, since its listing is: Gilgamesh, Ereshkigal,Namtar, ddìm-pi-kù, dbí-ªitº-ti, Ningiszida with Dumuzi, and finally Enlil’s ances-tors Enki, Ninki, etc. (A. Cavigneaux and F. N. H. al-Rawi, Gilgames et la mort:Textes de Tell Haddad VI [CM 19; Groningen, 2000], 23, 8–18). But the promi-nence of Gilgamesh here may simply reflect the fact that he is the centre of the text. While Gilgamesh’s position in the netherworld is well known, Etana’s has re-ceived less comment, indeed the most recent edition of the Akkadian legend, J.

One must surelyassume that both Gilgamesh and Etana received their special offices in the nether-world as consolation prizes for having failed to achieve personal immortality.Rev. 12: Note how e n is developed from an epithet to being part of the name,just as in the Sumerian King List the king of Kish is en-me-(en)-bára-ge-si,but on contemporary inscriptions the name appears as me-bára-si (D.

Ca-vigneaux and F. al-Rawi in RA 76 (1982): 189–90; K. Deller in NABU 1991/18;and K. Nashef in NABU 1991/97. The important evidence is the variant writingszi dne-du8 ì-du8-gal kur-ra-ka and z i bi-tu ú-du-gal kur-ra-ka in twocopies of an incantation from Tell Haddad (A. Cavigneaux and F. al-Rawi, ZA 85[1995]: 198, 42 = 23u) and dbi-†u-hi-du-gul in a funerary inscription for a royalconcubine of the time of Ashurnaßirpal II (A. Fadhil, BagMit 21 [1990]: 463, 19).The writings bi-tu/†u-(h) confirm that the normal orthography is to be read dbí-du8/d uh, but do not settle the etymology. Deller opted for an Akkadian origin ofthe name, an imperative peti/petu(h). The only evidence in Akkadian for a -u vowelfor this verb offered is SBH, 75 ii 18–19: ga-na ì-du8 é ma-al-ù = a-tu-u bitape-tu-u. Since the reverse of the same tablet (iii 14) offers a regular form of this verbin the phrase é t a g4 nam-mi-in-lá? = bita ip-te-sim-ma, it is especially unwise topress into service an isolated form such as pe-tu-u as proof of a possible form iptu*.This pe-tu-u is no doubt a scribal error influenced by the immediately precedinga-tu-u. A couple of passages in later Syriac are irrelevant, and in any case have beenexplained by C. Brockelmann as an inner-Syriac development, as alluded to byNashef. The latter also rightly referred to the Akkadian divine name dip-te-(eh)-bi-tam as parallel, but we see it not as proof of an Akkadian etymology but as proof ofa Sumerian etymology: dbí-duh/d u8/t i is Sumerian, “He opened.”"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"W.

Having reached D e r, I lookedinto this matter: Bunuma-Addu did not capture Aparh a ; it is Hadurah a thatBunuma-Addu captured. But the scribe who wrote Hamman’s tablet madea mistake. He wrote “Aparh a ” on a tablet and, without getting (it) heard,encased it in a clay envelope. In no way was Aparh a captured; Hadurah a he did indeed capture. 1 The background of this letter is not of immediate relevance; suffice it to saythat during Zimri-Lim’s reign, Bunuma-Addu repeatedly tried to break out from 1.

The two towns mentioned in the letter, Aparh a and Hadu-rah a , must be located in the same territories; but we know something only aboutthe former. Once the seat of an independent kingdom ruled by Larim-Numaha,Aparh a seems to have bordered on Yamhadian territory. With Yamhad’s blessing,the town was brought under S am s i-Addu’s control. 3 We presume that it remainedunder Zimri-Lim’s protection, as that would explain his interest in its welfare.Of Hadurah a , so far there is no other mention; but this should not make it atown of lesser magnitude, whether or not Mari would have greeted its fall with lessalarm than that of Aparh a .Let us first reconstruct Ibalpi-El’s own narrative of events. According to him,Hamman, having learned of Bunuma-Addu’s conquest, relayed to Ibalpi-El newsabout a defeated city. Ibalpi-El had his scribe include this information in a letterthat he ordered dispatched to Zimri-Lim. A curiosity is Ibalpi-El’s decision not toforward the original letter that he received from Hamman, as was normal in suchcircumstances.In telling about his next activity, Ibalpi-El did not dwell on how much timeelapsed between the posting of his letter and his arrival at D e r; nor did he justify 2.

This is worth observing because, or-dinarily, Mari officials and diplomats did not shy away from elaborate narrative ra-tionalization. By cluttering letters with news of interim activities, they kept theking focused on their own alacrity and zeal. Ibalpi-El’s abrupt change of locus,therefore, deserves notice, for it gives the impression that a gnawing suspicionabout the accuracy of Hamman’s tidings was at the root of his travel to Der.Once there, Ibalpi-El promptly carried out an investigation that brought tolight the true state of events. The error, he discovered, originated with a scribewho, in fact, stood accused of two lapses: First, that he wrote “Aparha” when heshould have written “Haduraha”; second, that he sealed the tablet without check-ing its contents. After a brief excursus, I will take up seriatim each of these missteps.In the Mari archives as elsewhere, dub.sar (†upsarrum) is the normal term for“scribe,” although it is frequently bound to another noun when the context re-quires the mention of a specialist.4 To a lesser extent, dumu é dub.ba (mar bit†uppim) is also used, and the two designations can even be found in the same con-text (as in ARM 1, 7:32–43). If a distinction is to be made between the two des-ignations, however, it should not be on the basis of maturity or experience, for thetwo terms attract a similar range of adjectives such as taklum, “reliable,” nawrum“outstanding,” naßrum “discreet,” and ummenûm “masterly”; rather, at Mari dub.sar seems to be the more inclusive term, while dumu é.dub.ba seems more ap-propriate to administrative contexts.

Mukan-nisum, so well known to us as a factotum at the Mari palace, is given that designa-tion, although he is also called a satammum.6 Therefore, with the Mari testimonyabout the relevant terminology being decidedly equivocal, it is difficult to resolvewhether or not Ibalpi-El was intentionally slighting the culprit when he labeledhim a “dumu é.dub.ba”; but it is worth noticing that even after personally mak-ing inquiry in Der, Ibalpi-El refrains from naming the scribe about whom hecomplains.There are some fine studies in Assyriology that reconstruct the training ofscribes, recreate the scribal school curriculum, and even debate the technology ofcuneiform script.7 But the routine of chancellery scribes—how they took dictation,how they prepared their letters, and how they verified their contents—remains6.

It is unlikely that, over the many centuries of cuneiform history, scribes fol-lowed a single modus operandi in handling correspondence, and it would not doto corset Mari scribes into one. Still, there is a corpus of small Mari tablets whichsuggests that, despite the Sumerian quip about scribes who were so talented thattheir “hand matches the[ir] mouth,”8 palace scribes did not take dictation in oursense of the word. That is, they did not transform, verbatim and instantaneously,sound into signs; nor apparently did they convert what they heard into shorthand.98.

Such a hypothesis would elucidate how the scribe knew (more or less anyway)what size tablet would be needed to cover the relevant topics.12 It could also clarifyhow previously received letters were quoted with significant, but rarely complete,10. Two studies by F. Joannès are the fundamental collections for memoranda, “Textes No 91 à245,” in Archives administratives de Mari 1; Archives royales de Mari XXIII, ed. G. Bardet et al.

Additional examples may also be published as ARM 23, 592 and ARM 26, 406. Durand, “Ad-ministrateurs de Qa††unân” (full reference above, n. 5), 95–96, refers to a number of thick, inelegant-ly written tablets from the Yasmah-Addu period that likewise begin with assum but end with formulasregarding Mari’s safety. Badly preserved, these documents probably had a very brief shelf-life.A number of Mari administative documents display aide-memoire characteristics; these includeARM 25, 785–86 (assum, in medias res), ARM 23, 83 (assum, at end), ARM 21, 386, ARM 23, 561,562, 593; ARM 24, 220 (no assum); ARM 7, 260 (using sa); ARM 8, 92.For Rimah examples of the same (OBTR 326–28, where scribes used the sumerogram mu forassum), see P. Abrahami, “Memorandum à Tell al-Rimah,” NABU 1988/37, 26. On the propositionthat Neo-Assyrian scribes may have kept “war diaries” from which they created annals and monu-mental inscriptions, see, lastly, De Odorico, Numbers and Quantifications in the Assyrian Inscriptions,117–20.11. Joannès, “Nouveaux Mémorandums,” 105–6. Remarkably enough, a (near) duplicate of thistext is extant (M.13705), F. Joannès, “Un nouveau mémorandum de Mari,” NABU 1987/29, 15–16.I have no clear notion of what it means to have a duplicate of a draft document.12. Even when exchanged between the same correspondents, “Mari” letters can differ apprecia-bly in size, shape, and thickness, see D. Charpin, “Corrections, ratures, et annulation: la pratique desscribes mésopotamiens,” in Le texte et son inscription, ed. R. Laufer (Paris, 1989), 58–59.

They could be generated by the au-thors of letters rather than by their scribe. Thus, when a bureaucrat writes on thesame topic to people of authority over him, the formulation may differ appreciably,even if the contents generally remain the same. The same can be said when an ad-ministrator, finding himself on the defensive, takes up a topic about which he hadpreviously written, but alters its contents significantly when quoting his earlierformulation.13More difficult to evaluate are stylistic idiosyncracies that occur in the corre-spondence of bureaucrats. Thus, N. Wasserman has noticed that in using the par-ticle assuri, Bahdi-Lim consistently gives asurri . . . -ma, his colleagues Kibri-Dagan,Ibalpi-El, Yamsum, and Sammetar almost never do so, while Yaqqim-Addu andYasim-El use either form. As long as the assignment of palace scribes (whether tospecific individuals—bureaucrats, diplomats, royal family—or to specific tasks) re-mains poorly understood, such a stylistic discrepancy could be cogently assigned toscribes or to administrators. Similarly ambiguous in their origin are the conventions(if that is the correct term) that control how different topics were sequenced in thesame letter or how lists of personal and place names were arranged.14Regarding scribe-generated discrepancies in recopying documents, the evi-dence is much more forthcoming when assessed from administrative archives.15 Asfar as epistolary texts are concerned, any conclusion will have to await careful com-parison between a quoted passage and the original from which the quotation is pre-sumably derived. Two letters that Durand recently edited as FM 2, 55 (A.682) and56 (A.856) may be lightly treated here to contrast the types of discrepancies thatoccur when generated, respectively, by authors of letters and by scribes.16 13.

Soonafterwards, Laªum realizes that he misunderstood the king’s message and naturallyworries about his witticism (jest?). He therefore writes again (FM 2, 56), quotingthe king’s original message, but this time giving it a straightforward answer. As ithappens, the letter Zimri-Lim sent Laªum is available to us (FM 3, 138), and itscontents sharpen the magnitude of Laªum’s offense:17I am just now conveying a tablet to Ibalpi-El. The bearer of the tablet,together with the tablet that he is carrying, (should . . . ) with you(about x lines missing) and make his way toward Ibalpi-El.

If messengers from Hammurabi, king of Kurda—that is “donkey-riders” [i.e., dignitaries]—have reached Qattunan, the bearer of my tablet together with the tablet that he is carrying should make his way toward Kurda, to Ibalpi-El. But if the messengers of the Kurda king have not arrived, detain with you until the pagra’û-festival the bearer of my tablet, together with the tablet he is carrying. 20] This is what my lord wrote to me. Perhaps my lord has had a lapse in memory: Kaªala-El has already made his way to Kurda. With Ibalpi-El staying at ˇabatum, my lord’s tablet that he has sent to Ibalpi-El has made its way (there) in the usual way.27] Now, however, Sin-ismenni, Yakun-asar, and Yasub-rabi, Kurda messengers, have come here with Kaªala-El. Kaªala-El, having taken their lead, has made his way to my lord. They are also bearing for my lord his (sacrifice) share from the Elunum festival.5] Previously, my lord wrote to me stating, I have now conveyed a tablet to Ibalpi-El. If Kurda messengers—that is “donkey-riders” [i.e., dignitaries]—have reached Qattunan, the bearer of my tablet together with his tablet should make his way toward Kurda, to Ibalpi-El. But if the messengers of the Kurda king have not arrived, the bearer of my tablet, together with the tablet he is carrying, should be detained with you until the pagraªû-festival.20] This is what my lord wrote to me. Because Ibalpi-El (is) in ˇabatum, my lord’s tablet has made its way (there) in the usual way.23] Now then, the Kurda messengers have made their way to my lord and I have sent a notice about them to my lord. As to the bearer of the tablet that my lord has sent to Ibalpi-El, I had detained him; but he has already set out to my lord."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The Burden of Scribes219Despite the missing lines, Zimri-Lim’s directive is clear. He had already sent ordersto Ibalpi-El directly, and he wants Laªum to dispatch an amendment to that earlierletter that depended on whether or not a delegation from Hammurabi (of Kurda)reaches Qattunan. (We are dealing therefore with two letters addressed to Ibalpi-El.) If the ambassadors arrived, the courier was to take the king’s (amended) messageto Ibalpi-El. Otherwise, the courier was to wait until the pagraªû were complete be-fore returning with the tablet to the king, presumably because this festival, itselflinked to celebrations honoring Istar, took the king elsewhere.18 Again despite themissing lines, we notice that the king is not placing Ibalpi-El at Kurda; in fact,Zimri-Lim’s words imply that (new?) instructions were to reach Ibalpi-El only ifKurda sent a delegation to Zimri-Lim, and we might imagine that, given the volatileconditions of the time, Zimri-Lim was orchestrating counter-actions to Hammu-rabi’s political maneuvers.Laªum’s trespasses were therefore many. He presumed that his king had a faultymemory of Ibalpi-El’s whereabouts and that he no longer recalled who accompa-nied Kurda’s delegation; so he took it upon himself to correct the king’s plan. FM2, 55 implies that although a delegation came from Kurda, Laªum sat on the tabletbrought by the courier rather than sending it to Ibalpi-El.It is not necessary to quote the original Akkadian to note how Laªum reshuf-fled his thoughts.19 Presumably, Laªum wrote his letter after the pagraªû festival, butit is equally possible that he wrote it sooner, when he caught his gaffe. FM 2, 56lacks the opening reassurance that everything is well in Qattunan: perhaps he wasin a hurry to enter the topic at hand; perhaps he was no longer in Qattunan whenhe caught his error. In the quotations of FM 2, 56–57 given above, I highlight inbold the passages in FM 2, 55:21–34 that were not repeated in FM 2, 56:21–30.Noteworthy are the absence of the witticism, the lack of details on the members ofthe Kurda delegation, the suppression of any reference to Kaªala-El, whom theking is (falsely) accused of confusing with Ibalpi-El, and to the gift that Kurda wasbringing to Zimri-Lim. In italics, however, are portions that are new to FM 2, 56. In them, Laªum un-derplays his notice in FM 2, 55 about the Kurda messengers, and he alerts the kingabout sending back the courier and his message as though nothing were untoward.He offers no apologies for his failure to dispatch them both to Ibalpi-El upon thearrival of the Kurda delegation.The above episode illustrates the errors of administrators who have not suffi-ciently reflected on orders sent to them in written form.

Because Laªum was literate, we may presume that he no longer had theking’s original message at his disposal when acting on it.20 In fact, the letter wasfound in Mari, presumably brought back to the capital upon the king’s return.In contrast, the types of discrepancies that are scribally generated can be assessedby paralleling the two versions of Laªum’s (faulty) recollection of the king’s originalmessage as embedded in his two letters:Unlike the discrepancy created by Laªum’s recollection of FM 3, 138 (theking’s original message), the differences in the above passages can be attributed tothe scribe whose job it was to give context to Laªum’s two replies. FM 2, 55 wasundoubtedly sent out earlier than FM 2, 56, but given how widely the formulationsdiffer from Zimri-Lim’s letter, we can suggest that the scribe relied on Laªum’smemory of FM 2, 138 when composing the first letter but that he had a draft ofFM 2, 55 when composing FM 2, 56.To explain differences between their citations of the king’s order, I had thoughtthat FM 2, 56 was narrower than FM 2, 55. But photos kindly placed at my dis-posal (courtesy J. M. Durand and B. Lafont) do not support the notion. For reasonsthat are difficult to untangle, the scribe framed the quotations within the samenumber of lines (perhaps he was emulating the original format); yet he tightenedthem in FM 2, 56 by removing words or signs that do not affect contents or com-prehension (in bold above, at FM 2, 55:10, 13, 17, 19).

Thus, when Asmad, Ibalpi-El’s assistant, neededto broadcast essentially the same document to seventeen regional leaders, his scribemust have slaved late into the day working out the necessary adaptations and inter-polations.22 And if their work included copying from another text, they relied ona colleague to read aloud from one text while they checked the other. This, appar-ently, is the meaning of the term mustassûm, which is applied to one of the two part-ners in the enterprise.2321.

The first is in a colophon to a Samsi-Addu“Chronicle,” reading “SU Habdu-Malik mustassû Limi-Dagan”; M. Birot, “Les chroniques «assyri-enne» de Mari,” MARI 4 (1985): 232. Here the choices are either that Limi-Dagan dictated the text(so Durand, apud Birot, 232 n. 9) or that he helped Habdu-Malik confirm it as a correct copy. I foundthe first notion less plausible, if only because chronicles are not likely to be created but are compiled"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Jack M. Sasson222With this in mind, we can get back to Hamman’s scribe and his alleged lapses.The claim is that he heard Aparha but wrote “Haduraha.”24 While in documents24. The verb rasabum (construed with accusative) occurs in A.2701, a text Charpin has publishedin “‘Lies natürlich . . .’,” 48–50. Hulalum writes to a king, likely Yasmah-Addu:5] Among the tablets that were brought from Qatna to the king [Samsi-Addu], there wasone tablet that was to be brought to my lord [= Yasmah-Addu], but Qatna messengersmixed it up and presented it to the king.14] I opened it and, observing it to have been written to my lord, I did not recite it to theking. I am herewith getting this tablet sent to my lord.As Charpin himself notes in “Errare humanum est (à propos de verbe rasabum),” NABU 1995/28, 23–24, the verb rasabum occurs also in AbB 7, 110:28 (about a field mistakenly mentioned in a sealed tab-let) and in AbB 10, 192:22 (about a theft, contrasting how the writer mistakenly took something [inala idim arsubma elqe], and how someone else made a mistake but continued to speak without knowl-edge [irsumma ina la idim iqbi]).D. Charpin refers to another document that seems to have gone astray, the unpublished A.977(“Tâwîtum »libellé, formulaire«,” NABU 88/85, 58–59). General Samidahum writes, “Yasim-El camefrom a number of documents. I would therefore translate the colophon, “Work of Habdu-Malik;Limi-Dagan (being) the reciter.” Habdu-Malik may well be the same as the scribe who operated dur-ing Zimri-Lim’s reign (8, 33:23). None of the published references to a Limi-Dagan (menials ortribesmen) is likely to correspond to Habdu-Malik’s colleague.The word mustassûm makes a more ambiguous appearance in M.7481 (= Florilegium marianum 2,17, Maul, “Die Korrespondenz des Iasim-Sumû,” 48–50), a letter Yasim-sumu sent to the king:5] I am herewith sending to my lord an inscription (narûm) for the chariot of Nergal and aninscription for the palanquin of Itur-Mer. 11] The inscription for the chariot of Nergal, should it be written on the chariot’s face(“breast”) or the rear (“tail”)? My lord should consider the matter; yet this inscriptionshould be written on the rear (“tail”), where the weapon is set, so that reader and recitercould read it ([sas]um u mustassûm istanassû).22] As to the inscription for the palanquin that god [Itur-mer] rides, it could be written (ei-ther) on the face (“breast”) or back. Whatever his decision, my lord should write me so thatbefore my lord sets forth toward here, these inscriptions can be written.In this document, both palanquins and chariots have a “breast” (irtum); but palanquins have backs(warkatum) and chariots have a “tail” (zibbatum) on which the divine weapon is secured. narûm seemsto refer to some sort of (wooden or stone) inscription that could be fixed on chariots and palanquins,rather than to a clay tablet, with a draft of the text to be copied on the vehicles. In this case, sa†arum[N] should be taken metonymically: once the inscriptions are fixed, chariot/palanquin will have beenwritten. That a narûm could be comparatively small is known already from literary texts, see J. G.Westenholz, “Writing for Posterity: Naram-Sin and Enmerkar,” in kinattutu sa darât: Raphael KutscherMemorial Volume, ed. A. F. Rainey et al. (Tel Aviv, Occasional Publications 1; Ramat Aviv, 1993),213–16.Still, the positioning of the inscriptions is critical here. Yasim-sumu is of the opinion that, as faras the palanquin is concerned, the inscription could be set front or back, but he advises that it shouldbe set toward the rear of the chariot, nearer the weapon. His reason has something to do with ease ofreading. But why mention two types of readers when the verbal conjugation precludes making achoice (“reader or reciter”)? Does the reading involve antiphony (“read to each other”)?I have used M.7481 to clarify 2 Sam 6:2 in “‘The Lord of Hosts, Seated over the Cherubs’,” inRethinking the Foundations: Historiography in the Ancient World and in the Bible.

Consequently, I am reasonably satisfied that if there wasan error, it would not have occurred during a copying process, not when the scribecreated the letter I cite above after consulting his own notes, and not when he cop-ied the information from a letter reaching Hamman with news of Bunuma-Addu’striumph. (For that matter, I might excuse on similar grounds Ibalpi-El’s own scribe,unpracticed though he may have been, when he copied the information fromHamman’s tablet.26) Rather, the mistake was likely to have happened a step or twoearlier, during an oral transfer of information—either when the scribe misheardwhat Hamman was telling him to write Ibalpi-El or when Hamman himself washearing news of Bunuma-Addu’s victory. 25.

Sasson224Now I will admit to lacking an inner ear for the native pronunciation of “Ha-duraha” and “Aparha,” given the many possible phonemes represented by the con-sonants in the cuneiform orthography. Still, the phonetic difference between thetwo names does not seem wide enough to believe that a scribe would have putdown “Aparha” just when Hamman was telling him “Haduraha.” This commentalso means that I strongly doubt what essentially is Ibalpi-El’s second charge: thathad the scribe only recited his text (to a colleague, but especially to Hamman) toaurally verify its contents, he would have caught the error and made the neededcorrection before dispatching the faulty letter to Ibalpi-El. So, while Ibalpi-El re-mains technically accurate when implicating the scribe, the transmission of false in-formation must have taken place before Hamman called him in for dictation.27 Inother words, when a letter to Ibalpi-El about Bunuma-Addu’s conquest was firstdrafted, everyone in Hamman’s circle placed it at Aparha and not Haduraha. Still, while exonerating a scribe from a crime against the profession should initself be a noble goal for any of us, there is nevertheless need to offer a plausibleaccounting for Ibalpi-El’s own motivations in drafting his corrective letter toZimri-Lim.In the Mari age, people high and low wished to be first with the latest, com-municating what they learned not only to the king, but also to those who had theking’s ear; for the game was to keep themselves in the king’s mind, and thereforein his favor. Consequently, officials did not hesitate to plagiarize the latest news,even when forwarding the tablets from which they themselves learned that news.Perhaps they imagined that only their own version of account would stick in theking’s memory.In doing so, these officials were hardly frugal with their supply of clay. Oneepisode drawn for illustration has the king complaining that when he sought a cer-tain Yahadum, he received instead information on Yadiha-abum. A close reading ofthe text allows me to reconstruct the exchange of at least nine tablets via teams ofmessengers shuttling among Terqa, Qattunan, and the king’s quarters. In addition,at least four lasimu were entrusted with an oral version, if not versions, of the orig-inal request.28 This whole undertaking suggests an administration with little disci-pline for ordered exchange. Yet, I might add, this Rube Goldberg style in stateadministration, with its consequent webbing of recycled information, is precisely27. Occasionally, one reads of the reticence of correspondents to send material before checkingits accuracy; but they seem to be excuses rather than formulation of policy. In ARM 26, 304:9–10,Yamßum writes, “News that I hear here or there or that I witness, I am not sending it to my lord untilI have confirmed it. It is possible that once in a while I have not checked on some news; but it is inno sense a lie. I cannot lie to my lord.” Iddiyatum is less verbose in 26, 521 when he claims that hedoes not send what he writes until he sleeps on it and checks it out.28. The choice of messengers is occasionally discussed in the texts, e.g., ARM 26, 318:5–7,where Zimri-Lim is quoted as saying, “Write me above all whatever news comes to you, but makesure that your message carrier remains vigilant (ana wabil †uppika nuªªidma lidnin).”"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Burden of Scribes225what gives Mari its thick texture but also confers upon its world an intimacy that israrely matched elsewhere.The dossier is treated by Charpin, “‘Lies natürlich . . .’” (50–54) and includestwo letters, A.2453 and ARM 3, 68. I give them in the chronological order inwhich they were written. (My rendering of the final paragraph in A.2453 is notcertain; Charpin understands it differently.)[ARM 3, 68 = LAPO 18: 1068] To “my lord,” from Kibri-Dagan, “yourservant”5] Regarding Yadiha-abum, a Sahri man about whom my lord wroteto me, I promptly wrote to Yaqqim-Addu, giving him strict instruc-tion. Yaqqim-Addu wrote to Yapah-Lim, a royal agent at Sahri, andtownsmen searched for this man—imposing oaths where there was atown—but this man was not to be found.15] Now, the tablet that Yapah-Lim conveyed to Yaqqim-Addu, Yaq-qim-Addu had it conveyed to me with urgency telling me, “send thisletter to my lord so that he can hear it.”23] Now, then, my lord should hear this tablet: this man has not beenfound in Sahri.[A.2453] To “my lord,” from [Yaqqim-Addu], “your servant”5] My lord wrote to me, “I have written you about Yahadum, [a Sahriman], but you wrote to me about Yadiha-abum.” This is what my lordwrote to me.9] No (royal) courier ever came to me! Instead two men from Terqacame to me to say, “Kibri-Dagan has sent us with urgency to you say-ing, ‘write to Sahri for them to search for Yadiha-abum, then send himto me.’” This is what they told me.19] Promptly I sent two of my servants to Yapah-Lim, the royal agentat Sahri and this man wrote to me, “I have toured the province, butthere is no Yadi!-abum.”24] But I minded the oath of my lord; [the men?] did not pronounceYahadum’s (name).

Inspecting thisdossier carefully, however, leads me to believe that the initial error took place inthe first communication between the king and Kibri-Dagan: If the commissionwas made by letter, then the error was likely the king’s (or his secretary’s), sinceKibri-Dagan always looked for a “Yadiha-abum” (see ARM 3, 68:5–6); but if thecommission was done orally, then any of those involved (king, messenger, orKibri-Dagan) could have made the error. The possibility that there was an oral/au-ral lapse gains if nicknames had been used during the commission: Yadiha-abum =Yadihum vs. Yahadum = Yahad-abum/DN. Each of these spellings of names (as wellas others coined on the same verbal roots) is attested in Mari documents.We know from other correspondence that Hamman himself was in direct con-tact with Zimri-Lim; but neither he nor Ibalpi-El was the king’s only reader ofevents in the Balih area. Events were very fluid throughout the Mari age and in-formation flew fast and hard.29 Moreover, the region leaked like a sieve, as far asthe trade in news was concerned, and the likelihood is great that the king wasmade aware separately of Bunuma-Addu’s activity. In fact, it is also likely thatIbalpi-El himself must have learned the true account of Bunuma-Addu’s conquestfrom the same types of sources. So he went back to Der because he needed toconfirm the news before correcting it; but he also needed to finesse his way out ofembarrassment, and I believe that the main aim of the letter I presented above isto do just that. But Ibalpi-El’s real scapegoat is not the scribe, who remains protected by ano-nymity, but Hamman himself. Worth noticing is line 5, which reads, †uppi Hammansa ana ßeriya usabilunim. Now in Mari as elsewhere in OB texts, the third-person plu-ral was used as an indefinite subject to facilitate focus on an activity when there wasno particular interest in who was responsible for it. But in the royal correspondence,29.

In contrast, the king isinvited to compare Hamman’s unprofessional behavior with that of Ibalpi-El who,as is shown in lines 6 to 8, takes full responsibility for transmitting the latest news.This episode, in fact, is not the only one in which Ibalpi-El gives an unflatter-ing portrait of Hamman. In A.2995, an unnamed suqaqum of a neighboring townshares with Hamman highly sensitive news about Baßßum, a trusted officer ofZimri-Lim who nevertheless was apparently in cahoots with the same Bunuma-Addu. The next day Hamman hides three witnesses behind a door despite havingtaken a solemn oath never to betray the suqaqum’s secret. Incredibly enough, Ham-man persuades this gullible leader to repeat his incriminating information. Ibalpi-Elrelays this whole episode to Zimri-Lim; but while he is subtly disapproving ofHamman’s behavior, Ibalpi-El does cloak the identity of the suqaqum, a potentialvictim, in the same way as he does that of the scribe of A.427.31In this example, as well as in the text featured above, Ibalpi-El has done morethan report on regional events; he has also taken aim against a potential competitorfor the king’s attention, launching another salvo in a never-ending campaign to30.

He called this man from Ardawan, and began toquestion him as follows, “Go back to the words you spoke yesterday.” This man proceededto tell Hamman, “If you reveal this conversation to anyone, I will die beyond doubt!”Hamman proceeded to place himself under oath for him, “I shall not reveal your words toanyone.”28] Because he placed himself under oath for him, [the man from Ardawan] went back tothe words which he spoke the day before, “For 2 years now, Baßßum has been continuallybeholden to Bunuma-Addu.” Dada, the resident-agent, Yasub-Lim, and Yaptuna-El of Dercould each hear these words from behind wooden double-doors. 35] As for me, having come to Der, Hamman set matters before me, “[From] there, he can-not [protect] nor preserve the city.” My lord should pay careful attention to these mattersand answer me one way or another.

Not surprisingly, Ibalpi-El and Hamman contin-ued to occupy their high positions throughout Zimri-Lim’s relatively brief reign.As to Hamman’s scribe at Der, I do not know what eventually happened to him;but protected by the anonymity Ibalpi-El conferred on him, I am sure he contin-ued to ply his trade long after Zimri-Lim had given up the ghost.32.

E. Cohen, Lamentations 2 (Potomac, Md., 1988), 648:41, trans-lated as “my (of Inanna) diadem” (p. 649). However, the meaning of sag-mu s is notknown and the translation “(radiant) crown” is uncertain.sig-sig (si 11 -si 11 ) has been interpreted by Jacobsen as corresponding to Akk. s a-p a lu D: s uppulu . mu s as “snake” or [z]u 2 -mu s (Akk. tultu ) is, in my opinion, ahighly doubtful interpretation. 3 2. sig-sig is connected with snakes in S ulgi R 14: gi s -mi-ri 2 -za-zu-u 3 mu s -sig-sig, trans. byJ.

Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis2 (Chicago, 1954), 68, as “When heaven had been separatedfrom the earth, the distant trusty twin,” understanding tab as “twin” (otherwise Sum. mas-tab-ba) fol-lowing a suggestion by Jacobsen (see JNES 5 [1946]: 143 n. 24). If the translation is correct, thenthere was a conception, otherwise not known to us, of An-Heaven and Ki-Earth as twins.The separation between heaven and earth is mentioned by Berossus; see P. Schnabel, Berossus unddie babylonisch-hellenistische Literatur (Leipzig-Berlin, 1923), 245ff. et passim; Heidel, The BabylonianGenesis,2 77f.; J. J. van Dijk in AOAT 25 (1976), 125.10. In the Barton text, quoted above, the “shrine Nippur” (es3 nibruki) is mentioned before the“conversation” between An and Ki, while in the text treated above, Enlil and Ninlil did not yet exist. In Acta Antiqua Acad. Scient. Hungaricae T. XXI. (Budapest, 1973), 40, G. Komoróczy states thataccording to the earliest Sumerian concept sky and earth separated into two parts automatically, with-out any external power; this means, Komoróczy says, that the Sumerians regarded the developmentof the universe in its elementary form as the self-movement of the principium. However, it should benoticed that in OIP 99, 136 iii 1u-3 and OIP 203 ii 3u–5u Enlil (u4.gal.nun; 203 ii 3u)([u4.gal].nun) separates the heaven from the earth; however, in our Text 1 Enlil does not yet existwhen the separation takes place.11. It remains uncertain whether some cosmogony lies behind the Epic of Gilgames V iii 15 (al-so VII iv 15): ilsû samû qaqqaru irammum “the heavens roared, the earth resounded” (in a descriptionof a dream). I also refer the reader to a Ugaritic text: The Palace of Baal C 19–22 (see J. C. L. Gibson,Canaanite Myths and Legends [Edinburgh, 1977], 49; R. F.

BiOr 37 [1980]: 277 on text 3 C iii 24—rgm[1] “tale,” [2] “word, matter,” but in context has overtones of “thunder”). M. Dahood, Psalms 2 (An-chor Bible 17; Garden City, N.Y., 1968), 3f. on tªant assumes a root ªny (comparing Hebr. ªana(h) III“be opportune, meet,” “to face”; Baumgartner Hebr.

Kramer in his Sumerian Mythology (rev. ed.; Philadelphia, 1972), 39 assumed that therewas a Weltberg in Sumerian mythology; so also J. J. van Dijk, Sumerische Götterlieder (Heidelberg,1959), 17. Jacobsen, however, denied its existence, see JNES 5 (1946): 141 (“there is . . . no evidencefor a Sumerian Weltberg”). While Kramer and van Dijk interpret hur-sag-an-ki-bi-da in Tree andReed line 1 (also quoted above in the comment on Text 2, lines 12–13) as Weltberg, Jacobsen inter-prets hur-sag (in hur-sag-an-ki-bi-da) as “the range of mountains bordering the Mesopotamian plainon the east.

In our Text2:1, the heaven is illuminated, but the earth is dark. One should note that in Genesis, heaven seemsto have light. It might be difficult to harmonize Gen. 1:3–4 with 1:14ff., where God, after having letthe earth produce vegetation, creates sources of light to shine upon the earth, the sun to dominate theday, the moon to dominate the night (cf. H. Gunkel, Schöpfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit [Gött-ingen, 1895]; English translation Creation in the Old Testament, ed. B. W. Anderson [Philadelphia,1984]), 31; cf. A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis2, 101f.: Primeval darkness, Light before the lumi-naries. Also in Text 1, the earth is a cool, green garden and comes forth with deeps full of water, notonly before the gods came into existence but also before the creation of the sun and the moon. Theremight be some connections between our Texts 1 and 2 and the beginning of the story of creation inGenesis 1. (Cf. D. T. Tsumura, “I Studied Inscriptions from Before the Flood” [1994], 323f. for a discus-sion on the ºor “light” and the meªorot “luminaries” in the OT creation story.)In Text 2 we read that before the creation took place there were no deeps to draw water from,that the earth did not bring forth produce; the earth was dark, and there was no vegetation. In thisconnection I refer the reader to Prov. 8:22–29, an amazing tale with a strong mythological coloringabout the “Beginning”: “Wisdom” was together with the creator before the “Beginning” and duringthe creation of the world; the text is worth mentioning: she was fashioned meºola, “at the beginningof time,” meros miqqadmê-ªareß, “at the primeval times of the earth”; seas did not exist and there wereno springs filled with water; the foundations of the mountains had not yet been laid, and there wereno hills; the creator had not yet made earth with its open fields and lumps of earth. “Wisdom” waspresent when the creator set the heavens in place, and placed a crossbar(?) upon the sea, when he letfountains gush forth, when he assigned the sea to its limit, and she was present when the creator laidthe foundations of the earth.ii 29u: u4-ma-dam mu-he2-gal2-la ti [. . .]; we would have expected u4-ma-dam-ma (note -he2-gal2-la) in the latter passage, although not necessarily in the Gudea passage. hißbu A “abundant yield, pro-duce”; however, h. referring to the day(light) is not attested.

If van Dijk’s restoration of line 12 is accurate, the line, and the following line 13, refer to atime when the gods of heaven and earth did not yet exist. An-Heaven was the father of the anunna-gods, see Ewe and Grain 1–2: hur-sag-an-ki-bi-da-ke4 an-ne2 dingir-dingir-a-nun-na im-tu-de3-es-a-ba, “when, at the ‘mountain’ of Heaven and Earth, An-Heaven had created (engendered) theanunna-gods.” Enlil, after the separation between An-Heaven and Ki-Earth, placed the anunna-godson the earth: den-lil2 a-nun ki mu-gar-gar, “Enlil placed the anunna-gods on the earth,” Zame Hymns11–12. (B. Alster, JCS 28 [1976], 121: “Enlil who placed the Anunna gods below sic earth.”) How-ever, it should be noted that in the translated lines from this Early Dynastic hymn, Nippur and Enlilare not connected with the separation between Heaven and Earth, but Enlil’s city, Nippur, is in thishymn described as uru an-da mu2 an-da gu2 la2, “city which is grown together with Heaven, embrac-ing Heaven” (lines 1–2): Nippur is, like Earth before separation, united with An-Heaven. This con-ception is partially reflected in one of the names of that city: dur-an-ki, “the Bond of Heaven andEarth.” In this connection, Alster (see JCS 28, 122; also AOAT 25, 18) refers to an Early Dynastic text(A. Westenholz, Old Sumerian and Old Akkadian Texts in Philadelphia I [Malibu, 1975], 124, no. 4 ivu8u: dur sur an la2-gin7) which Alster translates as “the twisted rope to which heaven is secured,” as-suming that it is possible that the passage hints at the time when Enlil, by separating heaven and earth,established dur-an-ki as the navel of the earth. However, it is far from certain that this passage refersto Nippur at the creation of heaven and earth. Text 1 ii 4–5, Enlil and Ninlil did not yet exist; in theBarton Cylinder i, the “shrine Nippur” exists in the real “Beginning” when storms and lightning oc-cur in Nippur (cf. B. Alster, JCS 28, 122). We might add here that in the “Nippur-theology” the godEnlil separated Heaven from Earth: see also OIP 99, no. 136 iii 1u-3u (quoted in PSD B, 36, bad B3.); for Enlil as the deity who separated Heaven from Earth, see especially Creation of the Hoe 4–5(quoted in PSD B, 8). In our Text 1, the separation between An-Heaven and Ki-Earth takes placebefore Enlil (and his spouse) yet existed, even before the older generations of gods existed, which iscontrary to the Nippur conception.29.

Hamlet , 1, 2 Among Thorkild Jacobsen’s many pioneering contributions to Assyriology, hisstudies in the historical and cultural development of early Mesopotamia occupy anespecially prominent and important place. Perhaps no other scholar has been moreresponsible for fashioning our image of those formative stages—be it in the area ofpolitical history, religion, or belles-lettres. For better or for worse, the shape of earlyMesopotamia as it exists in books today is to a significant extent the product ofJacobsen’s mind—a combination of exemplary deduction, great intuition, and freeimagination. As is so often the case in matters early Mesopotamian, it is to Jacobsen that weowe the first cogent argument for the existence, in the late prehistoric through theEarly Dynastic periods, of a supra city-state institution that united all of Sumer intoa single political and religious body. 1 According to Jacobsen, this hypothetical in-stitution—dubbed by him the “Kengir League”—was centered around the city ofNippur, which served as the league’s meeting place, as well as the religious capitalof all Sumer.Part of the evidence adduced by Jacobsen in support of his proposal was agroup of “puzzling jar sealings” from archaic Ur, which bear multiple depictions ofcity names. 2 As Jacobsen reasoned, “since such collective sealings imply collective 1. “Early Political Development in Mesopotamia,” ZA 52 (1957): 106–9.2.

Matthews, Cities, Sealsand Writing: Archaic Seal Impressions from Jemdet Nasr and Ur (Materialen zu den Frühen Schriftzeug-nissen des Vorderen Orients [= MSVO] 2; Berlin, 1993), 40–47 and figs. 12–125. There also survivesa similar sealing from Uruk (W. 11456), apparently of the same date as the Ur examples, for whichsee Matthews, op. cit., 39 and fig. 10b.

An obvious parallel is thebala deliveries of later times.” 3 Ten years after these words appeared in print, yet another—and even earlier—collective city seal became known. The seal in question is impressed on a numberof Uruk III tablets, all of which, except one, come from the site of Jemdet Nasr. 4 Ever since Jacobsen offered his discussion of the city seals, these completelyunique documents have continued to fascinate scholars—philologists and archaeol-ogists alike—challenging their interpretational skills. This is hardly surprising, sincethis is the only evidence of a potentially historical nature that survives from lateprehistoric times. Most of the scholars who have written on this subject tended toside with Jacobsen’s original idea that the city seals attest to some sort of formalizedarrangement, be it political, religious, economic, or commercial. 5 The most recentexemplification of this approach is the monograph by R. J. Matthews, who repub-lished and extensively discussed all the existing city seals. 6 Matthews concluded that 3. ZA 52 (1957): 109. See also ibid., 109 n. 35: “Collective seals such as those to which the frag-ments of impressions published by Legrain attest are most easily understood as used for sealing deliv-eries from a common fund of goods, created for a common purpose by individual contributions fromthe cities collectively sealing, i.e., league funds. Whether such collective seals would normally have thenames of all the members of the league, or only the names of a group contributing, e.g., during a cer-tain period of the year, or at a specific point, is not clear from the evidence.”4. See B. Buchanan, Catalogue of Ancient Near Eastern Seals in the Ashmolean Museum 1 (Oxford,1966), 8 no. 9. The first person to recognize that this seal names cities was M. Lambert, RA 64(1970): 189.

But, as hewas careful to stress, the precise nature of this arrangement remains elusive: The formal basis of this cooperation is likely . . . to have been military and defen-sive albeit rooted, perhaps, in an already existing religious and ritual network. . . .Our sources for archaic city cooperation do not permit much elaboration in inter-preting its nature but, at the least, the sealed tablets from Jemdet Nasr indicate arole for the city grouping as an authorization or guarantee body for transactions in-volving foodstuffs in such small quantities that some symbolic, perhaps religious,factor is involved. Further, the city group clay sealings from Uruk and, later, Urshow a concern with the storage and redistribution of unspecified goods. Thesefunctions, vague as they are, suggest a role beyond the purely military and defen-sive, including administrative elements. 7 But there were also two dissenting opinions, one of which saw in the city sealsmerely the manifestation “of an ideology of self-conscious cultural similarity” thatwas shared by the city-states named in the seals, 8 while the other denied these sealsany historical reality altogether, explaining them instead in purely semiotic terms. 9 Is it possible, with the evidence presently available, to reach a better under-standing of the city seals? This is rather unlikely in the case of the Ur examples,since those survive only as jar sealings, which is not enough to determine the natureof the administrative context in which they functioned.

Indeed, it maymake perfectly adequate sense to regard these seals, which record the names of various cities, as pre-senting an idea, specifically the idea of a common cultural structure among city-states that were po-litically independent.”9.

See especially the following conclusions: “One may view these data as evidenceof an otherwise unattested political league or trading association, or one may simply prefer to inferthat the routing of goods was indicated on the closing mechanism by means of cylinder seals on clayand that this routing was routine, otherwise there would have been no need for a permanent seal tobe cut with the city names integrated into the designs. It is unnecessary, in my view, to reconstructpolitical or socio-economic institutions in order to explain the data at hand; this is a needlessly com-plicated postulate for the situation we find. It is easier to propose a semiotic explanation of the ‘cityseals’ ” (p. 128)."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" Piotr Steinkeller 252might potentially elucidate the background of the respective transactions. To besure, a correlation between the seal and the tablets was sought already by Matthews.But, as I believe, further significant progress can still be made in this area.Important new light on this whole issue is thrown by the recently republishedarchaic tablet MSVO 4, 15. This document, which was originally included inATU 1 as no. 656, belongs to a group of illicitly excavated tablets that almost cer-tainly come from the cite of Tell ºUqair = ancient Urum. 10 This identification is as-sured by the frequent mention in these tablets of the sign-group ur 2 . ̆a .“ rad ,” awriting of the name of Urum. 11 What is so significant about this tablet is that itbears an impression of the same city-seal that appears on the Jemdet Nasr docu-ments studied by Matthews. 12 Writing about this document before the appearance of MSVO 4, Matthewswas incredulous that it could have come from a site other than Jemdet Nasr. 13 Hisreasons were the absence of other cases of identical sealings found on tablets fromdifferent sites 14 and the fact that the tablet allegedly does not name the toponym ur 2 . ̆a .“ rad ”. However, the toponym in question does in fact appear there, as isnow made clear by Englund’s hand-copy.This new datum calls for a reexamination of all the pertinent sources. The Jem-det Nasr tablets with a city seal belong to a group of seventeen documents whichare closely linked to each other by contents and structure. 15 The documents form- 10. See M. W.

The identification, in the archaic writing, of the last sign (= ZATU-432) as “ rad ,” whichwas suggested by Green, ATU 2, 264, is very doubtful. Most likely, ZATU-432 is a separate sign ofunknown reading which, sometime during the archaic period, coalesced with A (= ZATU-1). 12. Englund, MSVO 4, 13 and pls. 8–9, no. 15.13. MSVO 2, 36.

For example, impressions ofthe same seal of Sau s atar of Mitanni survive both from Nuzi and Tell Brak. See I. L. Finkel, “Inscrip-tions from Tell Brak 1984,” Iraq 47 (1985): 193; N. J. J.

For this phenomenon, note also the following Ur III examples, brought kindly to my attentionby Dr. Rudi Mayr: the seal of Babati, impressed on bullae from Puzri s -Dagan (BRM 3 37 and 38;B. Buchanan, Early Near Eastern Seals in the Yale Babylonian Collection [New Haven, 1981], 250–54no. 654) and on a tablet from E s nuna ( JCS 28 [1976] 178–79 TA 1931-T615); the seal of Úrim ki -ki-dùg muhaldim, on tablets from Ur (UET 3 252) and Puzri s -Dagan (BIN 3 585); and the seal of d Suen-a-bu- s u sagi du 10 -ús nam-dumu, on tablets from Ur (UET 3 242) and Puzri s -Dagan (SigristTENUS 210; PDT 2 916).15.

As for theircontents, all of the documents record quantities (usually identical) of figs, apples,wine (or grapes/raisins), and a certain fish product. 16 Similar commodities also ap-pear in the ºUqair tablet MSVO 4, 15. 17 As Englund notes in reference to this doc-ument, “not only are these products the same as those known in accounts fromJemdet Nasr bearing the same seal impression, but also the final column containsnotations exactly parallel to those in the final column of the Jemdet Nasr texts.” 18 As they appear in the Jemdet Nasr texts, these notations (with the exclusion ofcertain variants 19 ) are as follows: ni.ru Inanna/dingir 20 3 ( ) Unug. In the corresponding ºUqair tablet (MSVO 4, 15) the same notations read: ur 2 . ̆a .“ rad ” ma ̆ x na dingir 3 ( ) pap Unug. When discussing these phrases, Matthews was unable to reach any conclusionsabout their precise meaning, suggesting only that “the occurrence of unug a onthese tablets may signify the participation of Uruk itself in whatever transactions arebeing dealt with.” 21 As I would suggest, an improved understanding of these nota-tions is now possible. I submit that the phrase Inanna/dingir 3 Unug is to betranslated “triple Inanna/deity of Uruk.” 22 In all probability, the “triple Inanna/de-ity of Unug” is none other than the three forms of Inanna to whom offerings were 16. Written as: pè s “fig,” h a sh ur, “apple,” ukkin+din, “jug (ukkin) of wine/grapes/raisins(din),” and ga2+“geßtug,” the last item very likely representing the fish product /adakuªa/, usuallywritten with the signs ZATU-173, 174, 180, 181 (see Steinkeller, Review of M. W. Green and H. J.Nissen, Zeichenliste der Archaischen Texte aus Uruk, BiOr 52 [1995]: 701). In some instances, figs aremeasured in ZATU-735 (formally related to éß, “rope”), which may be an early writing of eitherníg-dù-a or se-er-gu, both meaning “string.” In two instances (MSVO 1, 172, 173), the food-stuffs also include dug+aß (a type of beverage?) and su2 (meaning unknown).17. These are: din, “wine/grapes/raisins,” pès, “figs,” hashur, “apples,” suhur, “carp,” ZATU-759+ku6 (a fish product, possibly related to /adakuªa/), sar (possibly to be read nisig, “vegetables”),plus two unknown items (ZATU-737+su and ZATU-648), both measured in “jars” (dug). Whileresembling the foodstuffs appearing in the other texts, this listing is sufficiently different to indicate aseparate origin of the tablet in question (thus corroborating the conclusion that the tablet comes fromTell ºUqair, and not from Jemdet Nasr).18. MSVO 4, 22.19. In several texts, the list of foodstuffs is followed by various sign-groups, possibly representingpersonal names and titles: su(vertical).ki.nun (MSVO 1, 165, 166?, 167, 170, 171, 172), en.ße+sarud ni.ru en pap 1(vertical) (MSVO 1, 169), en ªxº [ . . . ] (MSVO 1, 173), and ªX.Xº.ßu (MSVO1, 176). The poorly preserved text MSVO 1, 178 seems to have had a different structure altogether,but it ends in Unug and is sealed with the city seal. It possibly mentions en ni+ru in ii.20. dingir replaces Inanna in MSVO 1, 167; possibly also in MSVO 1, 173.21. MSVO 2, p. 38.22.

But we need first to examine the legend of the seal itself.The seal is divided into two registers, which may originally have recorded asmany as twenty toponyms. The names of some eleven toponyms now survive, ofwhich the identifiable ones are Ur (Urim2 = ßeß.unug),25 Larsa (ud.unug), Za-balam (muß3.unug), Urum2 (ur2. ̆a.“rad”), bu.bu.na2,26 and probably Kesh.27Matthews hypothesized that also Nippur, Uruk, and Kutha are named in theseal,28 but these identifications–if not completely impossible–are extremely un-likely.29 The latter three readings are clearly forced, as they were motivated by23. See Szarzynska, “Offerings for the Goddess Inanna in Archaic Uruk,” RA 87 (1993): 7–26(especially 8–22). Inanna nun could alternatively be explained as “Inanna of Eridu/Enki.” There ex-isted, in archaic Uruk, yet another form of Inanna, called Inanna kur, “Inanna of the mountains/Netherworld,” but no offerings were made to her. See Szarzynska, RA 87 (1993): 8.24. For the identification of ni.ru as the ancient name of Jemdet Nasr, see Englund, MSVO 4,12 n. 22; idem, “Grain Accounting Practices in Archaic Mesopotamia,” in Changing Views on AncientNear Eastern Mathematics, ed. J. Høyrup (Berlin, forthcoming). Cf. also Steinkeller, review of MSVO4 (BSOAS 62/1 [1999]: 115–17).25. For the writing, see most recently Steinkeller, BiOr 52, 705 under no. 388, 710 under nos.595–96.26. bu.bu.na2 is probably to be read arinax. See D. R. Frayne, The Early Dynastic List of Geo-graphical Names (AOS 74; New Haven, 1992), 122 n. 279; Steinkeller, BiOr 52, 699 under no. 58.This toponym appears also in the Uruk City List, line 14 and in an economic tablet from Uruk(A. Cavigneaux, Bagh. Mitt. 22 [1991]: 78, W 24004/3b). For the last attestation, see also below,p. 256 and n. 32. 27. This toponym was interpreted by M. Lambert, RA 64 (1970): 189, as either Umma or Ak-shak. Identification with Kesh was suggested by Green, ASJ 8 (1986): 77. Matthews, MSVO 2, 34–35, analyzes the grapheme in question as “two signs, perhaps the jar with lid.” The “jar” is more likelya “womb,” related formally to the “omega” symbol of Ninhursag = uterus with ovaries, for which seeJ. Black and A. Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia (Austin, 1992), 146–47. Thesecond sign is probably ßu2 (= ZATU-534). This writing is conceivably a precursor of keß3, whichunquestionably appears on several of the Ur sealings (Matthews, MSVO 2, fig. 12, nos. 1, 5, 6, and7), either in its complete form en2(=ßu2+an).ßag4 (nos. 5 and 6) or defectively as an.ßag4 (nos. 1 and7). A possible meaning of the latter logogram is en2 “incantation” (Akk. siptu) + sag4 “womb,” i.e.,“the one of womb/birth incantations,” referring to Ninmah/Ninhursag, the goddess of Kesh. (Herenote that the spelling en2. ̆ixgad, for which see G. B. Gragg, “The Kes Temple Hymn,” TCS 3, 159,is a later—probably ED–—development.) Unfortunately, the name of Kesh is not preserved in theArchaic City List, and so the identification of the grapheme in question as Kesh cannot be verified.28. MSVO 2, 34–37.29.

Whereasthe city seal attested to a specific political situation, limited to a particular time andplace, the geographical list served as an exhaustive scholarly catalogue of all the ma-jor “Sumerian” cities, arranged hierarchically according to their size and impor-tance. It is imperative, therefore, that the seal be treated with utmost caution, sinceany attempt to impose readings on it could distort its unique purpose. How are we to explain the function of this seal, in the light of the informationprovided by the Jemdet Nasr and ºUqair documents? As the later sealing practicehad it, sealed documents were almost invariably receipts for movables, with the re-cipient acting as a sealing party.31 Such receipts would be deposited among therecords of the issuing party, to serve as proofs of expenditures. If, as seems highlylikely, the documents considered here are receipts as well, we would have to assumethat the city seal identified the recipient of the foodstuffs destined as offerings forInanna of Uruk. In other words, that person or persons acted as an official collectorof such offerings. Since the seal is impressed on tablets both from ni.ru = Jemdet30. For this list, see R. K. Englund and H. J. Nissen, Die lexikalischen Listen der archaischen Texteaus Uruk (ATU 3; Berlin, 1993), 145–50. Although Matthews does not say so explicitly, his recon-struction of the toponyms on the city seal apparently assumes that this document is a version of theUruk City List. Such, at least, is the opinion of Englund, MSVO 4, 14 n. 37, who talks of the “ver-sion of this list contained in the Jemdet Nasr ‘city seal.’ ” But, as I argue below, there is no reason tothink that this is the case.31. As a matter of fact, this is true of legal documents as well. The loan document is but a receiptfor loan issued (silver or grain); the sale document, a receipt for price paid; the hire document, a re-ceipt for wages paid; etc. For this point, see Steinkeller, “Archival Practices in Third MillenniumBabylonia: Some General Considerations and the Specific Case of the Archives of Umma in Ur IIITimes,” to appear in Ancient Archives and Archival Traditions, ed. by A. Bowman and M. Brosius (Ox-ford, 2001).second sign as nun is very questionable. However, even if the signs were indeed en.nun, there wouldstill be no reason to suspect that Nippur is meant here (the underlying assumption is that nun standsfor E2, as in the so-called ud.gal.nun orthography of the ED period, but there is no evidence thatthis orthography was known already in Uruk III times). Here it is important to note that Nippur’sname is spelled correctly (en.e2) in the contemporaneous Uruk City List, line 2 (for the interpretationof the second sign as E2, see Steinkeller, BiOr 52, 700 under no. 142). The same writing also appearson at least one of the Ur sealings (MSVO 2, fig. 12, no. 1, probably also fig. 14, no. 16), as well as ona sealing from Uruk (ibid., fig. 10b). In this connection, note further that the sign-group en.nun (if,in fact, this is the correct reading of the signs in question) is otherwise very common in Uruk IIItexts. See, e.g., “Officials,” line 14 (ATU 3, 87) and the occurrences in economic tablets from Uruk,where it is often written as a ligature (ATU 2, 198 under no. 135; ATU 5, 119–20).As for the occurrence of Uruk, the complicated sign which Matthews reads as unug is certainlynot unug (ZATU-583). If anything, it is uru (cf. the Uruk IV forms of ZATU-597); for the sign-form, cf. also ATU 5, pl. 71 9579, cd.The sign which Matthews interprets as Kutha could indeed be ZATU-219 (= alim) (seeSteinkeller, BiOr 52, 701 under no. 219), but Kutha’s name would be expected to be written ZATU-219.unug.

As the facts can best be reconstructed, a representative of that in-stitution traveled to ni.ru and Urum, collected the offerings for Inanna, and leftbehind receipts sealed with his official seal.These conclusions, if correct, would obviously be of great importance, for theywould provide us with the first tangible evidence of a pan-Babylonian organiza-tional scheme in the Uruk III period. All one can say at present about this arrange-ment or “organization” is that it involved a number of major Babylonian cities andthat it imposed on those cities an obligation to provide ritual offerings for the chiefdeity of Uruk. Among the cities belonging to this organization apparently were Ur,Larsa, Zabalam, Urum, bu.bu.na2, Kesh(?), and ni.ru = Jemdet Nasr. Very impor-tantly, this system embraced the entire Babylonian alluvium, as shown by the in-clusion in it of the northern Babylonian cities of Urum and ni.ru. Unfortunately, the fact that the seal is preserved incompletely makes it impos-sible to determine whether ni.ru’s name was originally recorded on it. If it wasnot, we would find here an indication that many other cities, apart from thosementioned in the seal, may have been involved.Further evidence for this organization may be provided by a fragmentarily pre-served tablet from Uruk,32 which appears to be a list of slave-women that were do-nated to Inanna’s temple at Uruk (ès) by various cities.33 Among those cities, thenames of Ur, Larsa, and bu.bu.na2 survive, which, incidentally, are also named inthe city seal.Although our evidence attests only to ritual obligations on the part of themember cities, it does not exclude the possibility that the organization in questionalso had economic, as well as political and military objectives. However, it is im-portant to keep in mind that no such evidence is likewise available for the EarlyDynastic “Kengir League,” whose existence was so imaginatively postulated by Ja-cobsen.34 With the data at hand, it appears unlikely that the latter organization—ifit existed at all—could have amounted to much more than an amphictyonic ar-rangement of purely religious nature.While agreeing broadly with the earlier interpretations, our understanding ofthe organizational scheme reflected in the city seal does, however, differ signifi-cantly in one respect. It now becomes clear that Uruk, rather than being merelyone of the participating cities, was the focus and beneficiary of the system.35 That32. A. Cavigneaux, Bagh.

Here it should be emphasized that this league remains largely hypothetical. The only evi-dence suggesting its existence is the bala institution of Ur III times, whose roots plausibly (but notnecessarily) went back to the Pre-Sargonic period.35.

If one con-siders Uruk’s paramount position in Late Uruk times–as evidenced in the physicalsize of Warka vis-à-vis other contemporaneous sites, the role Uruk played in thedevelopment of writing and scribal learning, and the archaeological record surviv-ing from there–this is precisely the situation one might expect. With all due caution, it may be suggested that the “organization” thus recon-structed was an antecedent of the later “Kengir League.” Although that amphicty-onic organization remains a largely hypothetical construct, it would seem likelythat, as indicated by the Ur III data pertaining to the so-called bala institution, itsfocus was the city of Nippur and its chief deity Enlil. This leads us to the unavoid-able conclusion that, sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic period, theoriginal Urukean organization underwent a dramatic transformation, by which itsfocal point was transferred from Uruk to Nippur. Such a development appears tobe entirely plausible, for there exists independent evidence of the rise, roughly atthat time, of Enlil to the position of the head of the Sumerian pantheon, which wasconcomitant with the decline of the importance of the cults of Enki and Inanna.Undoubtedly, this religious transformation reflected political changes which hadtaken place either at the end of the Uruk period or at the very beginning of EarlyDynastic times: the ascendance of the city of Kish and its region to power, as a re-sult of which the center of gravity of Babylonian politics had moved from the areaof Uruk and Eridu to the region of Nippur.This brings us, finally, to the issue of the city sealings from Ur, which providedsome of the inspiration for Jacobsen’s “Kengir League.” In light of what we nowknow about the Uruk III seal, it will not be unreasonable to assume that these seal-ings attest to a similar arrangement of amphictyonic nature. But around which par-ticular city and cult did this arrangement center? The fact that the sealings seem todate to the ED I period36 should probably favor the choice of Nippur, since it islikely that, already then, Nippur enjoyed the status of religious capital of Babylonia.But without any corroborating evidence, this whole question must remain open fornow.36.

The Sumerian word /ku(g)/ is usually translated as “shining, bright, clean,pure,” or “holy, sacred,” or “free (of claims), noble.” 2 In its first meaning it is fre-quently used for objects, for the body (often in connection with fragrant oils), forshining things (such as light or the face), and for the cultic status of a person. Thethird meaning is limited to legal practice; it is used for persons but also for real es-tate. It is the second meaning, “holy, sacred,” which interests us here. In general, itcan be used in this sense for priests, kings, and gods, referring to their bodies, theiractivities, their qualities, their abodes, their possessions, etc. It is obvious that thedifferences between the first two meanings are not always clear-cut. Yet as an epi-thet 3 for a person, the second meaning will generally be the correct one. And it isused relatively seldom as an epithet. The goddess most frequently referred to withthe epithet ku(g) is Inana, whom we regularly meet as kug- d inana. That this isan epithet rather than a description is shown by the uncommon, even irregular, 1. I was able to examine most of the tablets cited in this paper in the Babylonian Section of theUniversity Museum in Philadelphia. Heartfelt thanks therefore go to the generosity of Prof. ÅkeSjöberg, Curator of the Babylonian Section, who allowed me to quote from the unpublished pieces.The gist of this contribution formed part of invited lectures for the Departments of Near EasternStudies and Comparative Literature of the University of Michigan, and for the Departments of NearEastern Languages and Civilizations and Fine Arts of Harvard University in the spring of 1995.2. See, e.g., CAD E, s.v. ellu (which is the Akkadian equivalent), 102–6. The meaning “bright,pure” combined, one supposes, with the aspect of “noble” is also responsible for a rather technicalmeaning of ku(g), viz. “precious metal,” which can be yellow (kug-sig 17 “gold”) or white (kug-bab-bar “silver”). The interminable discussion as to whether we are justified in translating ku(g) as an epi-thet of persons and some objects as “holy” is, to my mind, fruitless, irrelevant, and even nugatory,especially in the light of the often neglected fact that our “holy”/ “heilig” (Old English h a lig , Gothic hailag = “holy,” whereas Old English geh a l and Gothic hails = “healthy”) is etymologically “whole,healthy,” as in “wholesome.” And yet since Ulfila’s time nobody has ever worried about the aptnessof the word as a translation of either sacer or sanctus or both, or of Greek hagios . Moreover, the mainpoint of my argument is that Lugalbanda’s career, his qualities, and his function make him into whatwe recognize as a “holy man” and that this typological identification does not depend on the way weguess ku(g) should be translated.3.

Where itdoes not—and the adjective ku(g) is almost the only adjective regularly so used—this always indicates a “frozen” adjective, or an epithet not to be separated from itsnoun or name. The only non-divine being referred to with the epithet ku(g) withrelative frequency is Lugalbanda. 1.2. Who is Lugalbanda? The name literally means “small/young/junior(banda) king (lugal).” It does not have the connotation of “crown prince” or thelike; that would be “king’s (eldest) son.” We suspect that the name itself might bea kind of epithet turned into a name. 4 We have four types of evidence about him, to wit: (a) the Sumerian King List ; 5 (b) documents relating to his divine status, which starts in the Ur III period (ca.2110–2004 b.c.e ); 6 (c) later references to his heroic or legendary status; 7 and(d) two long narrative poems in which he is the central hero. It is this last evidencewhich particulary concerns us.According to the Sumerian King List , Lugalbanda was a king of the city ofUruk; his predecessor was king Enmerkar, the main personage in all the narrativesthat treat the Matter of Aratta , 8 of which our Lugalbanda narratives are also part, andindeed he was Lugalbanda’s overlord. Lugalbanda was considered to be the humanfather of Gilgame s , whose mother was the goddess Nin-sun. If they are “historical” personages at all, he and his dynasty might tentatively beplaced somewhere between 3200 and 2800 b.c.e ; but we really know nothing 9 about the dynasty’s history or historicity. 1.3. The Lugalbanda narratives are part of a larger cycle which we may call the Matter of Aratta . In two of its poems king Enmerkar and his enemy, the Lord of 4. This happens frequently in royal onomastics (or perhaps, more correctly, titulature).

Still,both the setting at the beginning and the solution at the end imply and indeedpresent the same framework of a contest between Enmerkar and his opponent. Thematerial we possess for these tales is much alike in shape, quality, and distribution.What we have is mainly Old Babylonian, but one tale 11 had a version or a fore-runner in Ur III times. Indeed, it is plausible that the cycle originated in Ur IIItimes, since the dynasty then ruling over southern Mesopotamia traced its origin tothe rulers of Uruk. The compositions were held in high regard: there are well-written exemplars of the complete text, as well as partial editions on good four-column or single-column tablets; there are very few exercise extracts. The materialcomes mainly from Nippur, although Ur has yielded some very fine pieces as well,and several other sites have provided a few additional fragments. 2. The Story—or Stories 2.1. One of the tales, here referred to as LB II, or Lugalbanda and the ImdugudBird , was edited in an exemplary fashion by Wilcke (1969). 12 The other poem,LB I, or Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave, preceded LB II, since it shows the begin-ning of the conflict into which Lugalbanda’s adventures are woven, and it seems tohave no real conclusion. Unfortunately, there is no edition as yet of LB I, althougha number of specialist studies allows us to reconstruct much of the story. 13 A single outer frame encompasses both stories. This frame is a rather abstractone. The story goes thus: Enmerkar undertakes a military campaign to subdue Aratta. On the march to-wards Aratta, Lugalbanda is abandoned by his comrades. He manages to survive,to acquire special powers, and to find his comrades again, in time to be instrumen-tal in breaking the deadlock caused by Enmerkar’s ineffectual siege of Aratta, andin bringing about in this manner the ultimate submission of that city to Uruk. 10. Or is he? The central part of Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta consists of the seven journeys amessenger has to undertake between Uruk (i.e., Sumer) and Aratta (over seven mountain ranges) inorder to deliver a triple challenge, three seemingly unsolvable riddles, and their unexpected solutions.It does not take a mathematical genius to see that the “magic number” seven is thus obtained mechan-ically. One of the requirements of the messenger is that he be “miraculously swift of foot”—whichhappens to be precisely the supernatural power Lugalbanda acquires during his tribulations.11. The poem here indicated as LB I. Note that its twin, LB II, has two (bilingual) fragmentsfrom the Kuyunjik collection, which is basically the royal archive and library of the Assyrian kings ofthe first millennium b.c.e. This might seem unexceptional in view of the enduring fame of Enmerkarin later tradition, but, in fact, it happens only very rarely that a classical Sumerian composition survivesthe commonly presumed Kassite literary revolution in the latter half of the second millennium b.c.e. 12.

L. J. Vanstiphout 262 This unified and unifying frame, to my mind, clinches the argument for regardingthe two narratives as one story to be told and traduced in two installments. Despiteboth the ingenuity of the defenders of the “two poems” theory, 14 and the unmis-takable way in which the ancients themselves treated the two halves as separate“tablets” or volumes, it is one story. Put somewhat succinctly, 15 my arguments arethe following. (a) As two independent poems, LB I has no ending, and LB II has no begin-ning.(b) The opening scenes in LB I mean not merely to explain how Lugalbandacame to be abandoned but also ultimately to prepare us for his miraculous returnwith just the right kind of supernatural power needed by the Urukeans at this junc-ture. If the scheme of the framework were torn asunder, the strong parallelism orreciprocity between the beginning of LB I and the finale of LB II would lose itsrelevance and its very logical and smooth progression towards a resolution at theend of the second installment of a difficulty introduced in the beginning of the first.(c) The abstract scheme of the framework is nearly identical with the frame-works of the two narratives that have Enmerkar as their hero, viz. Enmerkar and theLord of Aratta 16 and Enmerkar and En su ̆ ke s dana 17 —but only if the Lugalbanda storyis understood as a whole. (d) The references, formal and conceptual, between the two texts are so obvi-ous and permeating that LB II makes little sense without LB I; but what is perhapseven more important is the fact that both texts constantly refer to the frameworkas such, and as a united framework.(e) Lastly, although our competence in Sumerian narrative poetry is not sogreat as we would wish it to be, we can identify some strikingly close stylistic andformal correspondences between LB I and LB II that are not shared by the En-merkar stories. 18 14. Wilcke 1969: 5–8 marshalls the arguments in favour of the unity of the two narratives butcomes to the conclusion that the matter cannot be settled as yet. This position invalidates a numberof points raised in the long refutation by Kramer 1971, which, to be fair, starts from Wilcke’s recon-struction and interpretation of the plot of Lugalbanda and the Imdugud Bird as such, not merely fromhis pp. 5–8. Alster 1990: 63 n. 17 seems to misunderstand Wilcke. Wilcke’s original sentence is aquery, not a statement, and it goes: “Sind es zwei selbständige Epen, die in einem Zyklus aufeinanderfolgen, oder gehen sie ohne Füge ineinander über?” Wilcke then continues: “Diese Frage muss so-lange der Schluss von ‘Lugalbanda im Finstersten des Gebirges’ nicht enthalten ist, offen bleiben . . .”Falkowitz 1983: 104f. actually argues for two independent poems, but cut up in a different way, thusgoing thoroughly against the ancient tablet division.15. The matter deserves a renewed and detailed treatment, not in the last place because of ourgrowing understanding of the poem’s immanent and overt structural features. This is not the place todo so.16.

This matter too deserves full and detailed treatment. But at least one hint can be given: bothLugalbanda stories show a penchant for mixing relatively long “descriptive” or “explanatory” passagesSpread is 6 points long"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" Sanctus Lugalbanda 263For all these reasons, I cannot concur with Alster’s proposed analogy 19 with theHomeric poems. Surely the “relationship” between the Iliad and the Odyssey isdifferent in both intent and structure. The analogy would only apply if the goal ofOdysseus’ travels were not Ithaca but Achilles’ tent before Troy, and if Odysseusbrought back some miraculous or unexpected power which would break the dead-locked situation of the Greek army.Meanwhile the fact remains that our story is much more about Lugalbanda’sadventures than about the conflict between Uruk and Aratta and its resolution. Buta short presentation will show that the two cannot really be separated. 2.2. The first part, Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave , is still unedited; 20 it runsas follows: It describes how Lugalbanda, the eighth and youngest brother of the commandersof Enmerkar’s host, falls ill in the mountain regions. His brothers leave him in acave in the mountains with some provisions, and promise to take him with themon their return journey—if he should still be alive. Lugalbanda spends a wholenight in prayer to a succession of great luminaries: the setting sun, the evening star,the moon, and the rising sun. He recovers, leaves the cave, and manages to stayalive by catching wild animals, (re)inventing fire and the cooking of bread andother food, while not forgetting to offer part of this food to the gods who haveprotected him. Night comes again; the powers of darkness arrive and presumablythreaten the hero, who is saved by the reappearance of the morning star and thesun. The text breaks off near the end, so that we do not know precisely how thisfirst part of his adventures ended. 2.3. The second half, Lugalbanda and the Imdugud Bird , 21 begins at a point notfar from the end of the first story in spatial and temporal terms. Lugalbanda seems to be stranded at the foot of mount Sabum, in southern Iran.He stumbles on the nest of the Imdugud-bird, and finds that the bird’s young is allalone in the nest. He takes it out, treats it to fine food and generally takes goodcare of it. Upon returning, the parents are upset at not finding their young, andconsequently very happy when Lugalbanda suddenly produces it in fine condition.Imdugud wants to recompense Lugalbanda with all kinds of fine gifts; Lugalbandarefuses everything but superhuman speed. Thus equipped, he very soon rejoins hisbrothers at their ineffectual siege of Aratta; he keeps silent about his newly ac-quired quality. Enmerkar is in a quandary; he wants a messenger to go to Inana in 19. Alster 1990: 63.20. See above, n. 13.21. Often referred to as Lugalbanda and Enmerkar .

No one daresto undertake the lonesome and dangerous journey. Then Lugalbanda volunteers;he travels to Uruk and brings back Inana’s solution (she prescribes a magic ritualthat will grant bloodless victory to Enmerkar) in an incredibly short time. Arattasubmits; its beauty is praised, as is Lugalbanda’s heroism—or holiness. 3. Lugalbanda’s career 3.1. Structure: “rites de passage” It is easy to recognize here an almost classical formulation of the rites de pas-sage.22 Separation, transition and (re)integration, or, if you prefer, the preliminary,liminary and postliminary moments are obviously there in the tripartition whichstructures the story. The encompassing passage structure (dereliction by companions§ sojourn in the wilderness § return) is clear. But much more is at hand.3.1.1.First, the phase of transition—the sojourn in the wilderness—is actu-ally the central subject or topic of the text as a whole. This phase is long and highlyarticulated. It consists of two main episodes, providing the redactional rationale fordividing the story into two parts. Furthermore, both episodes are very elaborate, somuch so that each of them can be broken down further into subsections. And thesesubsections themselves provide replications of the tripartite passage structure. Sucha phenomenon was foreseen and even explicitly indicated by Van Gennep him-self,23 but in our case this replication has a specific shape and function. That is tosay, the central, or liminary, part (sojourn in the wilderness) is subdivided into sev-eral stages that repeat the tripartite structure and use details which are known fromsundry manifestations of the rite de passage. Thus one can recognize at least fourreplications of the general structure, arranged in a linear and progressive sequence.(i)First there is the “healing” episode. The separation is obvious: Lugalbandais left while he is deadly ill, and his companions somewhat ceremoniously preparea resting place for him:A couch they prepared for him as a nest;Dates, figs, cheeses,Sweetmeats as for the ill . . . (All this) they put by him as a dish prepared for the sacred, the most preciousplace.24 22. See in general Van Gennep’s classic study 1966 (1908). I have used the English translation(1966). The structural feature of the poems as rites de passage was first noticed by Robert Falkowitz1983: 105. Since he did not work out the details, one can have some sympathy with Alster’s scepti-cism (Alster 1990: 66 n. 28). But a close reading of the central episode as one big passage divided intofour subsections, as will be presented here, refutes Alster’s objection.23. Van Gennep 1966: 11.24. Lines 88–91 LB I:88. nig2-dag gud3-gin7 mu-na-se3-ge-ne89. zu2-lum gispes3 X-du7 ga-ar2-ra ga-ra-[]"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Sanctus Lugalbanda265Also they promise that they will take him back to Uruk—dead or alive—on theirreturn journey.The transition is articulated in (a) a fourfold series of prayers,25 (b) sleep with adream predicting safety and even a new status,26 and (c) recovery27 with the helpof Utu: Then the righteous one, who soothes Enlil’s heart [Utu?], grew the plant of life; The swift stream, the foster-mother from the hills, brought the water of life.The plant of life he [Lugalbanda] placed in his mouth. The water of life he scooped up.28The reintegration takes the form of Lugalbanda regaining his life-force by securingsubstistence and offering a feast to the gods who have succoured him.(ii)To be sure, the specific separation in the first episode was the separation ofLugalbanda from his companions; but, in fact, it was also the threat of the most ab-solute separation: that from life itself. In the second episode we again meet with athreatened separation: that from the normal and ordered universe. The location, adesolate region in the wilderness, amply indicates this. What is more, Lugalbanda,though he has reentered the realm of the living, is now threatened by the forces ofdarkness and chaos. In a remarkable study Franz Wiggermann has analyzed theconcept (and motif ) of these dark forces.29 His central idea is (correctly) that the25. See below, section 3.2.26. Vanstiphout 1998.27. In fact one recognizes here a replication within the replication. By the combination ofprayers and dream the reintegration is requested and then granted; on the level of action (healing sleepwith a favourable dream) the reintegration is illustrated by the actual cure and the consequent secur-ing of subsistence, and sanctioned by the feast offered to the gods. This type of telescoping or specular(“mirroring” in the sense that a mirror repeats its image endlessly) narrative technique, for which onecan now fruitfully consult L. Dällenbach, Le récit spéculaire (Paris, 1977), is frequently used in Sumer-ian poetry; it is rarely noted, however, and even more rarely understood for what it actually is. Asplendid (but totally unrelated) example of this technique in the grandest manner has been discussedby the present writer in Vanstiphout 1992b.28.

L. J. Vanstiphout266Mesopotamian Weltanschauung posits an unbridgeable chasm between the complexof order, civilization, divine rule, ordinary humanity—in short, (ideal) Sumerianculture—on one side, and disorder, upheaval, lack of control, unruly demonicpowers, irrational savagery—in short, everything that poses a threat to the idyllicPax Sumerica—on the other. For these inimical powers Wiggermann has coined thefelicitous term “The Shadow Side.” It is precisely this Shadow Side which nowthreatens Lugalbanda, and tries to impede his return to civilization.Although we can hardly understand the difficult last part of the first Lugalbandastory,30 it is probable that the passage structure is repeated there as well. Lugalbandais still separated from the civilized world; the manner in which he counters thethreat, again with the help of the luminary gods, is also a transitional or liminarystage. In any case, he ends up in a new situation, and a new territory.(iii)He now arrives in liminal territory par excellence: the regions bordering onthe “civilized” world as we know it, whence probably the more or less precise geo-graphical identification.31 This is real border country in all senses, for it lies close tothe everyday world, but is nonetheless peopled by beings from the shadow side,such as the bird Imdugud. In this episode something quite extraordinary happens. While Lugalbanda atthis moment is still in liminal territory, he is, so to speak, on the road back to re-integration into his society; furthermore, Lugalbanda himself applies the passagetechnique quite consciously at this point. He takes the young Imdugud from itsnest, prepares a feast, and adorns the fledgling. When Imdugud and his wife returnfrom the hunt, the nest is eerily and ominously silent:When the bird stalled,When Imdugud stalled,And screamed towards his nest,His young gave no answering call from the nest!Again the bird screamed towards his nestBut the young gave no answering call from the nest.Up till then, whenever the bird had screamed towards his nestThe young had always given an answering call from the nest.But now, when the bird screamed towards his nestThe young gave no answering call from the nest.32 But when they finally arrive, they see the young bird in its nest, sated, well caredfor, and, one presumes, happy. Thereupon Lugalbanda appears and tells them whathe has done—with an explicit allusion to the “inverted” integration of the young30. See n. 13.

And so it happens; Imdugud offers him a num-ber of superhuman qualities or gifts, which by right are in Imdugud’s special power.Lugalbanda refuses everything but superhuman speed, alike unto that of Imdugudhimself. Thus Lugalbanda succeeds in partaking partially of the world of the super-human powers by accepting Imdugud’s young into his own society in a rituallyprescribed way. It is clear that Lugalbanda at this point has himself become a liminalfigure: nominally he is situated between this world and the Shadow Side; and hepartakes of both worlds.(iv) (Re)integration is the topic of the fourth episode in the over-arching34 pas-sage structure. Lugalbanda’s return is presented as happening very suddenly:As when somebody out of heaven alights on earthLugalbanda suddenly stood in the midst of the array of his companions.35Abruptly Lugalbanda reappears in the midst of the troops, who are still besiegingAratta without any effect. Here we have again an inversion of the scheme: Insteadof their fetching him upon their return, Lugalbanda has returned to his friends. Hehas joined them to their utter amazement. But he is greeted with mistrust and dis-belief. They do not understand this sudden return, and they do not believe hisexplanations:36 “What is this, Lugalbanda, that you are back?The troop left you as if you had fallen in combat!”37 . . .“How did you come back from the hills, where no one travels alone?From there no one could return to civilization by himself!”38 . . .Lugalbanda’s peers and companionsdismissed in their heart the words he spoke.3933.

The passage has been completed.3.1.2.This feast highlights one of the most striking crimson threads runningthrough this very rich texture: that of the feast or (communal) meal. Van Gennepalready marked the meal of communion as a characteristic feature which symbol-izes, effectuates and sanctions the reintegration.40 The significance of this motif andits function of incorporation into a number of heroic adventures and related poeticenvironments has been indicated in a masterful recent study by J.-J. Glassner.41 Inour case this rather transparent and not always well-articulated motif is used in avery subtle manner: over and over again, in the varying contexts, it takes on newshades of meaning. In combination these points of sustenance-in-repose repeat andillustrate the sequence and the telicity of the different phases and forms of the tran-sition of the hero from one stage to the other.(i)In the first instance it is clear that the food left by the companions at theside of the gravely ill Lugalbanda is meant as a viaticum or a funeral meal.42 This isstrikingly confirmed by the fact that after the series of prayers this food is replacedby the plant-and-water-of-life, which the gods themselves mete out.43 This epi-sode can be explained very plausibly as meaning that (“human”) food first denotesseparation; but then afterwards (“divine”) food brings about incorporation: hisfriends “buried” him; the gods brought him back to life.(ii)In the next episode, which is strongly reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe,44Lugalbanda rediscovers fire-making, hunting and cooking. Divinely inspired bymeans of a dream,45 he now prepares a feast for the gods. This theme receives ex-tensive treatment. First, he reinvents the making of fire:Shining flints he took in handand struck them together.46. . . 47 he put in an open space.40. Van Gennep 1966: 29: “The rite of eating and drinking together, which will be frequently men-tioned in this book, is clearly a rite of incorporation, of physical union, and has been called a sacramentof communion” (my italics).41.

With as much justification one couldpoint to Jules Verne’s L’île mysterieuse for the motif of the abandoned one who reinvents just abouteverything necessary for survival on his own, but with fullest confidence in the Supreme Being. Theimplied parallel between nineteenth-century ideology of positivist technological “progress” and Su-merian cultural attitudes is tempting, but, in view of the stark cynicism and overwhelming humanismof, for example, the Disputations, it is probably misleading.45. This dream is very interesting in its own right. See my study in Vanstiphout 1998, in whichI argue that the dream is the precise moment of Lugalbanda’s election by the gods or, at any rate, ofhis realization that he has been elected.46.

Incidentally, this feature also reinforces the link between LB Iand LB II. Furthermore, this feast leads to the “recompense”; Lugalbanda asks for and re-ceives the superhuman power of swiftness, which will enable him to meet hisbrethren again as well as to become the necessary mediator between the king andhis goddess Inana. And it is surely not a coincidence that this passage is introducedby the lines:No traveling [provisions did he take with him];He only took his weapon.In the air Imdugud flew;On earth Lugalbanda ran. In the air Imdugud looked up and saw the troop;On earth Lugalbanda looked up and saw the dust raised by the marching troop.57(v)Finally, the reintegration episode uses the motif thrice. In a first instance, thebrothers are astounded that Lugalbanda—who was without food—has survived:“You were unable to eat the wholesome cream of the byre; 58You were unable to drink the pure milk of the stall.How did you manage to return from the mountains, where no one can travel alone,And from where no one can return to civilization by himself?”Again his brothers and companions pressed him with questions without end:“The mountain brooks may be mothers of abundance,But their banks are remote from where the water is—59How could you drink from them, how did you get to the water?”60It is clear that the companions are convinced that the absence of food would nor-mally have meant separation from life itself. Lugalbanda’s reply is intriguing; he lies:“The mountain brooks are mothers of abundanceThough their banks are remote from the water.But I slid down their sides(?), and drank as from a water skin.I howled like the wolf, and I ate plants.As the wood pigeon I picked over the earth, and ate acorns.”61Still, despite their disbelief, the companions accept him again in their midst:57. LB II 203ff.58. Somewhat unclear; does it mean: “. . . as we can do”; or is it: “. . . when we left you, youwere not able to even . . . ”?59. In the mountains, the streams run in deep canyons so that the water cannot be reached fromthe banks.60. LB II 229ff.61. LB II 239ff. Lugalbanda’s reply is manifestly nonsense. He does not betray the secret; and thissilence was ordered by Imdugud himself. See below."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"H. L. J. Vanstiphout272As if he were the chick of a gam-gam bird62 still in its nest,They gave him food and drink,And thus they chased away the weakness of holy Lugalbanda.63Although we have not identified the bird in question, line 248 is an unmistakableallusion to the episode where Lugalbanda cares for the young of Imdugud. Line250 on the other hand takes us back to the very beginning of Lugalbanda’s sojournin the wilderness. And the link between these two passages is line 249, which dealswith food and drink! It is very plausible to interpret this reintegration scene as a poetic reworkingand even extension of the concept of the meal which sanctions and symbolizes thereintegration. This brings us to a general feature of the manner in which the rite depassage is used as the core of the piece: this happens by way of a conscious poeticaltransformation.3.1.3.For it cannot be denied that this reintegration scene, which, after all,deals with a subtopic, albeit a central one, of the whole story, consists of a poetic/narrative reworking of a cultic or sociological motif, which reworking lays thefoundation for the story. The intrinsically simple scheme of separation § liminality§ reintegration is not only sequentially repeated; it is also hierarchically repeated. Thelong sojourn in the liminal regions itself consists of a series of smaller passages, withtheir own structure and meaning. Moreover, these reworkings of the basic schemeshow a surprising variation. The motif is reversed as well as applied directly: Lugal-banda’s care for Imdugud’s young functions as a mirror image of his (Lugalbanda’s)own earlier tribulations; later, on his return, it is referred to again on the textual, aswell as on the situational level. A minute analysis of the poetic strategies that are athand here would take us too far astray.64 But the fact that it happens here, and inthis manner, has some further relevant implications.First, it means that the poet is fully conscious of the poetic possibilities of thisstructure. And this, in turn, means that he experiences and uses the originally ritu-alistic scheme as material, or as an instrument, or both—but not as the substance ofhis poem.A second implication, which follows from the first, is that the rite de passage nolonger functions as an isolated, independent whole. It becomes part of a larger lit-erary structure, and its details are worked out according to the requirements andintentions of that larger structure. In other words, however clear and transparentthe liminality process, the poeticization of only this structure cannot have been the62. Not identified. 63. LB II 248ff. The last line is somewhat unsatisfying: Lugalbanda was healed a long time ago,and by his own efforts though with a little help from his gods. A late and clumsy addition? Or doesit mean that Lugalbanda is still weakened from the arduous journey? Or must we understand that theyassume that Lugalbanda is still weak? Or is he dissembling here as well? 64. But such an analysis will certainly be of the highest importance for a better understanding ofStandard Sumerian literary technique and practice."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Sanctus Lugalbanda273poet’s only intention. The poem is not a literalized rite, nor the literary descriptionof a sociological process per se. On the contrary, it is a poetic composition whichuses, among other material, a sociological process in order to construct its own im-manent structure.Third, there is the matter of the seemingly exaggerated emphasis on food andeating. This too is an example of what the poet intended with his creation. Food,and consequently eating, is presented here as the prime symbol of the problem in-herent in the passage structure. This is the reason why it is used so frequently andin so many modes. And in a way, the poet seems to want to lead us up the gardenpath in this respect; it appears that Lugalbanda’s main aim is simply to stay alive; theimportant role of fasting and abstention in most ritual passages notwithstanding, thisrather rationalist poet seemingly points out that in this case food is of prime impor-tance. But at the same time it is clear that even this is not the real subject; Lugal-banda’s “meaning” cannot be restricted to the mere feat of staying alive underimpossible circumstances.And finally, the elaborate passage of the hero is, in its details, manifestly directedtoward a specific, not a general, goal. His endurance in all these deprivations anddifficulties only makes sense because they finally enable him to acquire a propertywhich his companions do not have, and whose very existence is to remain hiddenfrom them. From this two further insights appear. On the one hand, the passagestructure is needed in order to prepare Lugalbanda explicitly and pointedly for hisnew function. Thus the general intention of the passage is particularized, because thehero has to become not merely a full member of society, as would any other young-ster, but specifically a special person. What is at stake is a strictly personal and uniquecareer and position. Second, we must also note that the goal (reintegration) is in-terpreted here in a totally unexpected sense; instead of reincorporation into a groupof peers, Lugalbanda has become so uncommon that there can be no question orpossibility of reintegration into a peer group. He cannot be wholly incorporated intohis earlier society, for he remains in personal communion with the non-humanother world. He has attained a unique status, which in effect separates him muchmore than before from his erstwhile brethren. This signifies, in a sense, a blowingup of the transition ritual; he becomes the ultimate median figure, a liminal figure,between the world of the gods and that of men. To be understood as a journey, thepassage between these worlds can be undertaken effectively only by him, and onlyby means of the supernatural powers which he has acquired during his adventures.The poem is about Lugalbanda’s transformation into a mediator between the twoworlds. 3.2.Linearity: transformationIt is a paradox that it is precisely this somewhat baroque elaboration, by meansof conscious adaptations, of the simple passage principle that allows us to track arather straight line of transformation of the hero’s personality.6565.

Therefore he putshis trust in a higher power: he utters four touching prayers to the great luminarieswhich appear in turn in the skies.First he addresses the westering sun, praying that he not be left there, helpless,as one without a family:“Utu, I greet you—let me not stay ill!Hero, son of Ningal, I greet you—let me not stay ill!My brothers are now climbing the mountain passes;Let me not stay ill in this cave, this most horrible place on earth!74(This is) a place where no mother or father stands ready (for me);A place where no acquaintance or neighbour stands ready; My mother says not ‘Oh my son!’My brother says not ‘Oh my brother!’ ”75But there is a progression in this series of prayers. To Inana, the evening star, he praysthat this desolate spot may become a living place for him. This is an intended am-biguity. Lugalbanda says that he wishes to exchange the cave for “his” civilizeddwelling place, i.e., the place where he came from. But, at the same time, he wishesthat the cave would become habitable for him. The imagery he uses shows this:“Oh, that this were my house, that this were my city,That this were the town where my mother bore me, That this were even as the hole for a snake,That this were as the crevice for a scorpion!”7674.

Thus gradually, in four stages, Lugalbanda regains his full life force. First, ingracious response to his prayers, the sun god grants him life as such.80 This lifeforce is somewhat abstract and general: the terminology (“plant of life” and “waterof life”) is that of the creation stories and related pieces of mythology.81 At firstsight, this might not look spectacular; but it is, for in reality it means that, in fact,Lugalbanda is presented here as being created anew, and that his survival is, at thesame time, the creation of a new human being.Yet the gods are careful; they will not allow Lugalbanda to return to the hu-man world with the reckless boldness and arrogance of one who has withstood im-possible dangers. Also, they appear to show a special interest in Lugalbanda, andpossibly even a special calling for him in his new life. This calling may be seen inthe very act of a “second creation.” But being born again is not enough; he has toundergo another series of trials. These trials are not just aptitude tests; while under-going them, he acquires a number of properties which will stand him in good steadin his future career. At the same time, his new status of a special relationship to thedivine world grows apace. Thus he must immediately demonstrate that he can again fend for himself. Ina passage quoted above,82 he reinvents a number of elements of culture which willenable him to survive: fire, cooking, hunting. But as the text has it, “still he wasalone; no one, not even the sharpest eye, could see him.”83 In an ominous dream,which is specifically meant for Lugalbanda alone, he is told—indirectly—that hehas to sacrifice the animals he has caught to the gods.84 He carries out the impliedinstruction, showing that he is able to understand the intentions of the gods.85 Inpious gratitude he prepares a banquet for the gods: 79.

Unfortunately this episode is at present too badly preserved and toopoorly understood to be of much use. What we do know is that he now comes un-der attack from the forces of darkness, and that he is able to withstand this attackwith the help of the gods. It should be noted that the enemy this time is not hisown physical weakness (illness) or natural danger (the desolate mountainland), butthe forces of evil which threaten him. In other words, under the protection andwith the aid of the gods, he now conquers external evil. 3.2.6.Now Lugalbanda’s time of trial and apprenticeship is almost over.When he reaches the region of mount Sabum, home of the bird Imdugud, heagain approaches the borders of the world inhabited by humans. But his special re-lationship to the world of the gods will now also enable him to integrate into theworld of supernatural or, at least, superhuman forces. The first episode in LB II ismanifestly a reversal of the last episode in LB I (the attack by the forces of darkness).There are two aspects in this development that are striking.(a)The super-natural or, at any rate, non-natural88 being Imdugud is pre-sented here as ethically neutral, which presentation contradicts some other tradi-tional sources.89 But the point is much more that Lugalbanda’s treatment of theyoung of Imdugud90 deftly parallels the banquet he prepared for the gods in LB I;however, it simultaneously contrasts with his own first deliverance by the gods.91In a sense, he acts here as both a human being and a superhuman force. (b)It may be more significant from the point of view of his personal meta-morphosis that this episode ends again in a kind of trial—this time a moral one.The lavishly decked-out passage, wherein the bird Imdugud offers Lugalbanda allkinds of presents, must surely be read as a temptation scene. Imdugud’s first tenderconsists of a wealth of agricultural produce:86. This is what both extant manuscripts have; but the context makes it very plausible that “by”is meant.87. Lines 376–78 (LB I).

The motif is not heavily accentuated101; yet it may well imply anew kind of temptation, this time of a moral order: the temptation of pride and/orthirst for revenge.3.2.7.However that may be, we now find Lugalbanda fully equipped with su-pernatural speed, ready to depart on his way to the Urukean troops.102 Before part-ing, Imdugud adds a word of advice:The bird spoke to holy Lugalbanda:“Well then, Lugalbanda mine,I will advise you; take my advice.I will say a word; listen to what I have to say:What I have told you, and the properties I have granted you,Do not mention that to your friends;Do not reveal it to your brethren.It is a fact that favour often causes evil envy in others’ hearts.I am off to my nest now; you go to your troops!”103With this counsel Imdugud tries to protect Lugalbanda against jealousy; but, at thesame time, he points out the advantages of reticence, secretiveness and possibly alsomodesty.3.2.8.Upon his return, or reintegration, Lugalbanda acts accordingly, as wesaw earlier. But in the meantime things have come to a crisis; the siege remains in-effectual, and Enmerkar, the commander, has requested volunteers to return toKulab in order to ask Inana’s advice. In fact, the message Enmerkar wants to sendto Inana in Uruk shows that he is somewhat nettled. He reproaches Inana that shehas not made an unequivocal choice between himself—or Uruk—and the lord ofAratta, and in his message he demands a clear decision. Nobody volunteers; in astrongly formulaic series all troopers refuse: “Nobody said: ‘I shall go to Kulab!’;nobody said: ‘I shall go to the city!’ ”104 Thereupon Lugalbanda offers his services:Only Lugalbanda rose in the midst of the men and said:“Sire, I shall go to the city; no one has to come with me! I shall go to Kulab; no one has to come with me!”1053.2.9.Lugalbanda’s companions are sceptical about his offer, and they re-proach him for being reckless, vain and proud:101.

Literally “neck.”107. The companions are irritated; they think Lugalbanda acts foolishly by attempting some-thing which he should know is impossible. It is possible, but not certain, that there is another reasonfor their impatience: They might be forgiven for thinking that Lugalbanda is trying to rise in theking’s favour, and this in a blatantly unjustified way (since his proposal is doomed to fail).

The poem ends with the praise of Lugalbanda,the holy one. And this is only as it should be because in the last episode the wondrously swiftjourney in and of itself is not the only noteworthy feature. Even more important isthe implied fact that Lugalbanda is the indispensable mediator between the divineand the human worlds, thanks to his personal status and his miraculous powers, be-stowed upon him by the higher powers. He, and only he, has become the go-between between these worlds. Reviewing the whole narrative from the end-pointof his hardships and tribulations, and the resulting transformation, we perceive howevery detail in the previous stages of his development has worked towards thisapotheosis.1164.Lugalbanda’s HolinessGiven the application of a specific epithet (ku(g)) to Lugalbanda alone, we mustnow see to what extent our analysis of the text allows us to call Lugalbanda a “holyman.” This question can be answered in several ways, and on several levels.4.1.A first observation: that Lugalbanda is marked out from all his heroic ri-vals by the consistent use of the epithet ku(g)—however we wish to translateit117—is obvious. It is abundantly clear that the reason why the Mesopotamiansused the epithet for Lugalbanda is that they perceived him functionally to share thisattribute with a number of sacral objects, places and beings.118 And therefore ku(g)in this context is best understood as “holy.” The Mesopotamians themselves calledhim that; so why should we not? In general one can easily verify that Lugalbanda shows a number of qualitieswhich are universally perceived as belonging to the category of holiness, whateverthe contingent terminology, and which belong in greater or lesser degree to all thatis holy:• Election (illustrated by the notion that the gods in fact almost raise him from the dead and re-create him),• Devotion (his prayers full of faith),• Communion with divinity (the banquet for the gods),• Exclusivity (distance towards his fellow human beings at his return),• Mystery (secrecy towards his fellows119)• Unknown and even miraculous power (swiftness, Otto’s energicum!120).Still, this is not completely satisfying, since these qualities as such are somewhatstatic and might have been “granted” for the nonce to other figures as well. We116. It is one of the most striking poetical features of this piece that the recursive or even cyclicalformat of the rite-de-passage structure is welded to the strictly linear development of the least importantpersonage into the most important one, and this seamlessly. 117. See above, n. 2.118. See in general Wilson 1994: 5–34.119. This would fit Otto’s mysterium perfectly (Otto 1917). 120. See preceding note."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"H. L. J. Vanstiphout284need to return to the story as such in order to see whether its structure and devel-opment can shed light on the matter of his status as a saint.4.2.In the first place, it is abundantly plain that the story as a whole is not justan exciting adventure. It is a Werdegang, or a Bildung, that governs the narrativestructure as well as the choice of narrative detail. Lugalbanda becomes a saint in thecourse of the story. And the pattern of this evolution is highly interesting.It has often been observed that the hagiography121 of late antiquity and medi-eval times, whether Christian or not, shares many features with the heroic epic andromance122—so much so that one might speak of a structural relationship. There-fore, it is relevant to compare some basic features of the Lugalbanda story to itsnearest kin: the heroic tales of the same period, essentially the Enmerkar and Gil-gamesh cycles.The treatment of the Aratta material in the aforementioned heroic tales showsthat the framework, being the opposition Uruk ª Aratta, is very important; andthis same framework manifestly encircles our story as well. Still, the difference instatus is unmistakable. In the Lugalbanda story the framework is just that: a frame,as of a painting. The real subject and the main personage is Lugalbanda, and thereal story is his evolution. In the closing episode it is therefore Lugalbanda, not En-merkar, who personally communes with Inana in order to secure the saving words.Moreover, Lugalbanda does not act in his own interest: on the contrary, all hisexertions have as their intention the performance of a great and useful task for thecommunity (of course, his community), and not the realization of personal ambi-tion. This opposes him to a “purely heroic” figure such as Gilgamesh. Also, Lugalbanda’s treatment of a liminal figure (Imdugud) is completely dif-ferent from Gilgamesh’s promethean act against Huwawa: He at least allows Hu-wawa to be killed, in flagrant and open transgression of the will of the gods.Finally, there is the constant communion with the world of the gods and othersupernatural beings—communion which grows in intensity as the story develops,and which influences, even creates, Lugalbanda’s extraordinary personality. This isin stark contrast to the rest of the epic material, where such contacts function much121. See in general Bray 1992, Cox 1983, Elliott 1987, Henken 1991.122. The distinction, first elaborated (even invented?) by Ker (1896), is in any case, and notwith-standing N. Frye 1957, very doubtful. For all that, it still holds sway over a disproportionately greatpart of the analytical discourse about narratives in older literatures. It should be noted that P. H. Frye1908 alluded to a different division: On the basis of the genre of tragedy he proposed that epics witha positive outcome for the main heroes are to be called “romance,” while the “pessimistic” epicshould be called “tragedy,” to which it is much more akin. For “epic,” see basically Bowra 1952, DeVries 1963, Haymes 1977, and for “romance” Vinaver 1971, N. Frye 1976. In recent scholarship, thedistinction is not given much weight, and indeed it has been shown that the distinction between“Germanische Heldendichtung” and “Höfische Epik” is non-existent on the textual level. For themanifest generic affinity between heroic poetry and the vitae of the saints, see Elliott 1987: 16–76, andfor common motifs, Bray 1992. Bray 1992: 14 writes: “The closest parallel to a vita sancti in Irish nar-rative tradition is the hero tale.”spread is 4 points short"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Sanctus Lugalbanda285more as a background or a motor than as the story itself. This is not to say that thestory is devoid of important structural elements and motifs present in the other he-roic songs. These are abundantly there. But in our case they are extremely specifiedfor this single, unique purpose: the construction of the personality of Lugalbanda.This is a heroic tale of a very special kind.4.3.From this point of view it is not absurd to point out a number of similar-ities between our story and known structures from early Christian and medievalhagiographies.There is the encompassing central motif (or perhaps even theme) of the vita asa journey. A journey with a double meaning: in the vitae, as in the Lugalbandastory, the journey is a “real” voyage as well as an internal, psychological, ethical one,and it has a specific object. Moreover this journey has in both cases a specificrhythm: it is divided into a descensus and an ascensus. In the case of Lugalbanda thisrhythm is subtly diversified, but in the main the threats in LB I are reflected andsolved by the victories in LB II.123 This basic pattern is also present in many vitae.124Also, the sojourn in the wilderness is a well-known motif from the hagiogra-phies, particularly those from Egypt and the Near East. The motif of the saint as apre-eminently liminal personage is obviously combined with the sojourn in thewilderness.125Finally, our story shares a number of significant subsidiary motifs with the vitaesanctorum. It may suffice to mention the provision of food for the hero by others,or by the hero for others;126 the loving communio with animals which are otherwisevery dangerous—in our case the Imdugud episode;127 miraculous methods oftravel.128 All these are very well known from medieval hagiography.5.Concluding RemarksStill, some circumspection remains advisable. Motifs do not by themselves gen-erate a structure or a story. According to structuralist orthodoxy, the selection, se-quencing and organization (or hierarchization) of these motifs must be deemed tobe more important than the motifs themselves. Nor is every vita the same. Thereare many different types of saints, and every type has its own specific type of storyor narrative structure. In our case we certainly do not have to do with the saint asmartyr, or the saint as an “athlete of the spirit,” or the coenobite who forswears allearthly things. It seems difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to find a precisepersonal analogue (or homologue?) for Lugalbanda in hagiography. But even if onemight find such a thing, this would not seem particularly relevant to me, and it is123. This might be the reason for dividing the stories in two halves.124. See, e.g., Elliott 1987: chapters 5 and 6. She explicitly compares the saint’s travels to theQuest in romance. 125. See Elliott 1987: chapter 7.126. See Henken 1991: 74–79.127. See Henken 1991: 80–96.128. See Henken 1991: 97–101. On p. 97 she states: “Transport and travel are another sphere inwhich a saint’s miraculous powers are displayed.”"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"H. L. J. Vanstiphout286by no means necessary. For the thesis I am trying to defend here is that the Lugal-banda story has laid down the general directives, as it were, for a distinctive type ofstory which in later and other cultural traditions served as a kind of adaptable stencilfor the exceedingly rich production of similar stories.For this story is marked to a very high degree. This is not an untidy accumu-lation of curious motifs. On the contrary, these motifs, many of which in them-selves are widely known from heroic epic and romance but also from folk tales, areselected and organized in such a way that every part contributes to a highly specificcentral narrative line. This line can be summarized as follows: (i)selection, by the grace of the gods, of an unlikely individual to be savedfrom great danger;(ii) isolation of that individual from common humanity in the form of anextraordinary voyage and a sojourn in the wilderness;(iii) utter and exclusive devotion of that individual to the gods;(iv) a series of trials during which the individual acquires not only strengthto survive, but also extraordinary powers;(v) special communion with the non-human world; (vi) integration into and participation in the divine or at any rate superhu-man world;(vii) reintegration into the human world as a mediator between the divineand the human worlds;(viii) functioning as the saviour of his human society in crisis.This ordered sequence makes the “hero” into a saint, who is to be revered by hiscontemporaries but also by posterity—in both traditions.As a narrative structure and as the poetical expression of the underlying con-cept of how and why very uncommon individuals can participate in the divineworld in order to save humanity, the Lugalbanda poem may therefore be seen as anarchetype, or perhaps even a prototype, of much later literature in precisely thesame mode.ReferencesAlster, Bendt1976 “Early Patterns in Mesopotamian Literature,” in Kramer AV, ed.

Wirerhalten so einen Hinweis auf mögliche Ergänzungen am Anfang der Inschrift. Die Fluchformeln der Urnamma-Inschriften zeigen gemeinsame Merkmale,die sonst nur noch bei Gudea und in Text D erscheinen, woraus ich die Zuordnungzu Urnamma erschlossen habe (Wilcke 1993: 37 Anm. 45). Ein zweites Argumentunterstützt die Gründe von Michalowski/Walker (1989) für Urnammas Verfasser-schaft des CU: der Katalog der befreiten Orte in Z. 125ff. taucht z.T. im Kataster-text Urnammas wieder auf und ist mit Urnammas Sieg über Puzur/Kutik-Insusinak von Ansan zu verbinden (s. Steinkeller 1980a; 1987: 19 Anm. 1; Wilcke1987: 108–11). Ein drittes ist das Maßsystem in Z. 135–49: es weicht vom unterSulgi von Ur üblichen, aus der Akkadzeit übernommenen Standard ab. Die Ratio1 ba-rí-ga = 60 sìla; 1 ba-an = 10 sìla entspricht zwar dieser Norm; nicht aber dieGleichsetzung 1 sìla = 1 ma-na “1 Pfund”; s. auch unten, Anm. 66–67.Denn—Wasser als gemessene und gewogene Materie vorausgesetzt—das sìlaSulgis ist doppelt so groß (ca. 1 Liter, also ca. 1 kg Wasser). Das Maßgef äß sìla istebenso wie die Gewichtseinheit ma-na “Pfund” in 60 Schekel, das Schekel in je-weils 180 Korn (= Gran) unterteilt. Mißt nun ein sìla ca. !-2 Liter und faßt 1 PfundWasser, sind Hohlmaßsystem und Gewichtssystem direkt aufeinander bezogen. DasUmrechnen aus einem System ins andere und die Normierung oder Kontrolle vonGewichten durch Hohlmaße und umgekehrt ist denkbar einfach. Das hier standar-disierte ba-rí-ga-Maß, der “Scheffel” zu 60 sìla, ist also halb so groß wie das für dieAkkad-Zeit und die Zeit Sulgis und seiner Nachfolger errechnete;23 das gilt dannauch für das Kor zu 5 Scheffel, das dem alten Lagas-Kor von 144 sìla erstaunlichnahe kommt, falls dort das sìla dem Liter-Maß entspricht. Damit tun sich aber neueSchwierigkeiten auf, da die in den §d5–7 aufgeführten Rationen/Lohnzahlungen,soweit die Beträge erhalten sind, sehr gering ausfallen würden. Diesen Fragennachzugehen, kann hier der Ort nicht sein.Das im CU vorgestellte Maßsystem verknüpft wohldurchdacht und sinnvollHohlmaße und Gewichte. Wenn die Theorie über das Verhältnis von Hohlmaßen22. Der Ergativ in xii 34 (in 6N-351 erhalten) deutet auf einen Wechsel der grammatischen Per-son, in der von König Su-Suªen die Rede ist. Oder soll man im Original ke4 als Schreibfehler tilgen?23. Powell 1984: 54 möchte die Relation von Gewicht und Hohlmaß über Gerste bestimmen(10.800 Gerstekörner = 0,6 Liter) und sagt: “The Ur III sila is about the size of the present day Ba-varian Maß, but neither of these is the natural size for a drinking cup. They are rather the result ofmetrological evolution including doubling of basic units (in which the basic unit disappears from therecord) . . .” (Hervorhebung C. W.). Ähnlich, wieder über ein Doppelmaß, bestimmt er (1989/90:508f.) die Kapazität des sìla nach der Akkadzeit als die von 1.000 Gramm Wasser—gestützt einerseitsauf die in die Akkadzeit zurückreichenden Ziegelmaße und die Standard-Gewichtsrelation von Zie-gelgewicht zu Wasser und andererseits auf die Bestimmung des sìla als 63 Kubikfinger."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Der Kodex Urnamma (CU): Versuch einer Rekonstruktion297zu Gewichten in der Akkadzeit und von der Zeit Sulgis an das Richtige trifft, ist esnicht das Sulgis.

Ersteht mit der Berufung auf die göttliche Wahl des Herrschers und, wie schonKramer (1954) sah, mit der Beschreibung früherer Mißstände und deren Beseiti-gung im göttlichen Auftrag in der Tradition der “Reformtexte” Irikaginas von La-gas, bringt aber eine wesentliche Neuerung mit der kasuistischen Formulierungvon Gesetzen, die “an diesem Tage” Gültigkeit erhielten und zweifellos auch be-halten sollten.“Dieser Tag,” das zeigt der Text (C52) sehr deutlich, wurde mit Opferfesten imganzen Lande (“an den Ufern von Euphrat und Tigris”) begangen, und dafür sindeigens von königlichen Obergärtnern zu betreuende Gärten angelegt worden. Esist ohne Zweifel der Tag der Errichtung der Statue mit dem Gesetzestext undseiner öffentlichen Bekanntmachung.Damit liegt eine eindeutige Aussage zu der in der Literatur heißumstrittenenFrage vor, ob die altorientalischen “Gesetzestexte” jemals und wenn überhaupt,wann sie promulgiert wurden (Renger 1994: 28f; 50).24 Denn dem bei Frayne1997, Urnammu 20, nach Z. 181 fehlenden u4-ba des Kodex Urnamma entsprichtdas inumi-su “zu dieser Zeit” des Kodex Hammurabi (CH) unmittelbar vor den Ge-setzen.25 Ihm geht in beiden Texten eine summarische Aussage über die Schaffungvon Gerechtigkeit im Lande voraus. (Im Kodex Lipit-Estar (CL) ist die Schwellezwischen dem Prolog und den Gesetzen nicht erhalten.) Es wäre sehr erstaunlich,wenn dieses inumi-su des Kodex Hammurabi ganz anders zu verstehen wäre als dasu4-ba des Kodex Urnamma,26 wo es entweder ein den Bedingungssätzen der Ge-24. Der Ansicht Rengers 1994: 50, “die akzeptierte ‘unvollständige’ Natur dieser Gesetze würdedie Promulgation und Wirksamkeit der Gesetze auf die behandelte Rechtsmaterie beschränken,” wirdman bei einer weiten Fassung des Begriffes “Rechtsmaterie” zustimmen können; denn derartigeGesetze sind darauf angelegt, analog für jeweils konkrete Fälle interpretiert zu werden.25. Hurowitz 1994: 15f. Anm. 32 sieht diese Parallelität (er liest irrtümlich u4-bi), zieht aus ihraber keine Konsequenzen.26. Hurowitz 1994: 15 mit Anm. 32 sieht inumi-su in CH v 25 parallel zu seinem Gebrauch inRIME 4 Hammu-rapi 2, 25–33//28–35; 7, 38–41 und möchte es unmittelbar mit CH xlvii 9–10:Hammurabi sarrum gitmalum anaku verbinden und die Gesetze und die “title lines” (xlvii 1–8) tilgen(“to excise the laws along with the title lines”). Mit dieser m. E. nicht aufrecht zu erhaltenden An-nahme steht und fällt die zentrale These seines an vielen geistreichen Beobachtungen reichen Werkes.Renger 1994: 51f. stellt die Steleninschrift des CH zu den “Kommemorativinschriften,” indenen “der Bericht über den Bau des Tempels . . . verschiedene Erweiterungen erfahren [hat], indenen weitere Taten des Herrschers beschrieben werden . . .

Sie ist nur Teil dessen, was Hammurapi die Nachwelt von seinen Taten wissenlassen will. Die . . . Verschriftung rechtlicher Normen, wie sie die Rechtssätze des CH darstellen, hättesomit eine kommemorative Funktion.” Darum kann er, obschon er die gegen die Gesetzesnatur desCH angeführten Beweise entkräftet, “überzeugende Argumente” für “einen gesetzgeberischen Akti[m] Zusammenhang” mit den auf den Stelen aufgezeichneten “Rechtssätze[n] . . . nicht erkennen.”Das Schaffen von Recht und Gerechtigkeit ist freilich die einzige im CH berichtete Tat des Herr-schers; der appositionelle Epitheta-Katalog des “piety register” (Hurowitz 1994: 71ff.) ist kein Taten-bericht. Die “Rechtssätze”—41!-2 von 51 Kolumnen—sind keine “weitere Tat”; denn sie explizierendie in v 14–24 berichtete Ausführung des göttlichen Auftrages von i 27–59: “Als Marduk michbeautragte, die Menschen zu lenken und dem Lande Sitte angedeihen zu lassen, legte ich Recht undGerechtigkeit in den Mund des Landes und trug Sorge für das Wohlergehen der Menschen” (Über-setzung: Borger 1982). Renger 1994: 32 sagt zu Rs. xxiv 59–xxv 47: “In der zitierten Passage geht es weniger um diemöglichen Rechtsfolgen für den Recht Suchenden, sondern vielmehr um Ruhm und Segnungen fürHammurapi.” Im Text der Stele selbst erkenne ich aber keine Gründe für eine unterschiedlicheGewichtung der beiden Interessen des “Autors” der Stele. Der Wunsch nach Ruhm und Segnung istebenso explizit ausgesprochen wie der, daß der “geschädigte Bürger, der von einem Rechtsfall betrof-fen ist (sic: sa awatam irassû), meine Stele ganz genau laut lesen (oder sich vorlesen lassen: Gtn und Stngleichlautend) und meine überaus kostbaren Worte hören” solle und daß “meine Stele ihm denRechtsfall aufzeige und er das ihn betreffende Urteil (sic) ersehe (awatam likallim-su din-su limur). BeideWünsche sind miteinander verknüpft, denn den Preis und die Segnung soll nicht ein zukünftiger Be-stauner des Denkmals, sondern eben der aussprechen, der im Text der Stele sein Recht gefunden hat.Die Schutzgottheiten und der Tempel EsaFila sollen diese guten Worte über Hammurabi vor Mardukbringen (Rs. xxv 48–58). Ein “kommemorativer,” Ruhm schaffender Wert von detaillierten Rechts-sätzen zu ganz konkret beschrieben Fällen kann doch nur darin gründen, daß diese Regelungen fortanGeltung haben (sollen). Ein gesetzgeberisches Interesse hat man für den CH im Streben nach einer für ein aus ver-schiedenen Teilen zusammengewachsenes Reich verbindlichen Rechtsgrundlage gesucht. In gleicherLage fand sich auch Urnamma. Renger 1994: 32–34 führt gegen das Motiv “Rechtsvereinheit-lichung” das Gewohnheitsrecht und nebeneinander bestehende, unterschiedliche Rechtskreise an.Gerade in letzterem liegt aber das Motiv für einen Gesetzgeber, ihm essentiell erscheinende Bereichedes Rechtswesens zu vereinheitlichen, was z. B. das große Interesse des CH an den rechtlichen Ver-hältnissen der zu öffentlichen Dienstleistungen Verpflichteten erklären kann. Ob dieses Streben vonErfolg gekrönt war, ist für die gesetzgeberische Intention irrelevant, bedarf aber noch eingehendererUntersuchung. Die gesetzgeberische Absicht sollte sich in den Selbstaussagen der Herrscher äußern; darauf gehtRenger aber nicht ein. Hammurabi nennt (i 27–49) den Auftrag der Götter An und Enlil an ihn,Gerechtigkeit zu schaffen, als ihr einziges Motiv, ihn zum König zu erwählen. Die Ausführung diesesAuftrages ist für ihn Anlaß, die Stele zu errichten (Rs. xxiv 59–78). Er hat bei seiner Rechtssetzung“Sumer und Akkad” (v 8–9; Rs. xxiv 50–51), die gesamte Welt (ii 3–4; v 11–12 “die vier Weltsek-toren” [Übersetzung: Borger 1982]) und “das Land” schlechthin (i 33; v 17; Rs. xxiv 6) im Auge,und das “piety register” umreißt das weitgespannte, aus mehreren ursprünglich selbständigen Staatenzusammengefügte Herrschaftsgebiet Hammurabis. Urnamma nennt seine Absicht, Recht für das unterihm vereinte Land zu setzen, ausdrücklich im zà-mí-Lied TCL 15, 12: 27–28: dUtu ka-Fá inim ba-ni-in-Fál, di ku5-ru-Fu10 ki-en-gi ki-uri ka tés-a bí-in-sè, “Utu legte das (verständige) Wort in mei-nen Mund, ließ durch mein Rechtsprechen Sumer und Akkad einmütig reden,” und ibid. 33–34: nísu-a bí-ús-sa-Fu10-ei-na x-x-ri-ja, di ku5-ru-Fu10 ki-en-gi ki-uri ús as-a mi-ni-ib-dib, “Die Furcht (vor"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Claus Wilcke300kann27 oder aber zu einem Nominalsatz mit getilgtem Prädikat (“galt” oder “warGesetz”) gehört, dessen Subjekt die folgenden, kasuistisch formulierten Gesetzebilden. Die Entscheidung für letztere Lösung legt der Kodex Hammurabi nahe, derein Prädikat auf das Gesetzeskorpus folgen läßt: (v 24ff.) inumi-su, summa awilum . . .(xlvii 1–8) dinat misarim, sa Hammurabi sarrum leªûm ukinnu-ma matam usam kinam uridam damqam usaßbitu, “An diesem Tage galt: »Wenn jemand . . .« sind die gere-chten Rechtssprüche, die der tüchtige König Hammurabi festsetzte und damit dasLand einen sicheren Weg und gute Führung ergreifen ließ.”Nur hier wird von Hammurabi in der 3. Person gesprochen. Die Gesetze mitfolgendem Prädikat erweisen sich so deutlich als ein Zitat aus einem anderen Kon-text, d.h., aus der zeitlich von der Abfassung des Textes der Stele getrennten, ur-sprünglichen Verkündung der Gesetze (vielleicht im Jahr Hammurabi 22).Trotz dieser Gemeinsamkeiten bestehen auch große Unterschiede zwischenden beiden Kodizes. Der Kodex Hammurabi macht keine detaillierten Aussagen inder Tradition der Reformtexte Irikaginas über beseitigte Mißstände, und er beginntnach den Gesetzen nicht unmittelbar mit der die Inschrift schützen sollenden Fluch-formel. Vielmehr folgt auf das erwähnte Prädikat des Nominalsatzes, dessen Subjektdie Gesetze sind, zunächst eine Aussage über die Aufstellung der Gesetzesstele undihren Zweck (Rs. xxiv 9–78), die mutatis mutandis vielleicht mit der am Anfang desTextes des Kodex Urnamma stehenden Weihung der Statue verglichen werdenkann. Darauf folgen allgemeine Wünsche für das Bekanntwerden von HammurabisGerechtigkeit, die Beständigkeit der Inschrift und den guten Namen des Königs(Rs. xxiv 49–xxv 2), gefolgt vom konkreten Wunsch, daß der Rechtsuchende dieGesetzesstele zurate ziehen und den König dankbar preisen solle. Erst nach demeindringlichen, mit Segen und Fluch bewehrten Wunsch, zukünftige Herrschersollten das auf der Stele aufgezeichnete Recht pflegen und nicht abschaffen, kommtdie Sicherung der Inschrift durch ausführliche Segenswünsche und Flüche.Einige der Neuerungen des Kodex Hammurabi finden sich nun bereits im Ko-dex Lipit-Estar, der ebenfalls nach den Gesetzen und vor dem Fluch einen teil-weise zerstörten Passus (xix 6–17; 1u–4u) über die Inkraftsetzung der Gesetze (ohneZeitangabe) enthält: “Sumer und Akkad ließ ich die beständigen Gesetze (wie) ausdem wahrhaftigen Munde des Sonnengottes ergreifen” (xix 6–8), gefolgt von all-gemeinen Aussagen über die Rechtssetzung und ihre Folgen für das Wohl desVolkes und, nach einer Lücke, der Aufstellung der Stele (xix 2u-4u).27. Dagegen spricht sich m. E. zurecht Hurowitz 1994: 15f. Anm. 32 aus.Spread is 6 points longden genannten Strafen), die ich (den Menschen) eingeflößt habe, ließ durch mein Rechtsprechen Su-mer und Akkad in einer Spur gehen.” Im CU ist der Herrscher von An und Enlil wegen seinerRechtschaffenheit und Gerechtigkeit zum Könige erhoben worden (36–46) und hat mit göttlicherUnterstützung Gerechtigkeit im Lande geschaffen, das Sumer und Akkad umfaßt (103–113). DerText spricht (A 125ff.) von einem von fremdem Joch befreiten Gebiet; die Ortsnamen zeigen es zuAkkad gehörig. Eine ähnliche Wendung findet sich auch im CL 54–68 (A iii 9–23), der ebenfalls dengöttlichen Auftrag an den König, Recht zu setzen, als Motiv für seine Auswahl durch die Götternennt (24–36)."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Der Kodex Urnamma (CU): Versuch einer Rekonstruktion301Zeigt der Kodex Lipit-Estar so Neuerungen gegenüber dem Kodex Urnamma,die der Kodex Hammurabi weiterführt, so unterscheidet er sich von letzterem aberdurch den fast gänzlich zerstörten Katalog von beseitigten Mißständen. Kraus(1984: 21ff.) hat in diesem Katalog einen Vorläufer der uns von Samsu-iluna undAmmi-ßaduqa (in Bruchstücken) vorliegenden “Königlichen Verfügungen” er-kannt; die Gemeinsamkeit äußert sich dabei auch—Kraus hebt es nicht eigens her-vor—in der Formulierung; denn dem den Erlaß der Leistungspflicht in denEdikten ausdrückenden (w)ussurum entspricht im Kodex Lipit-Estar das Verbum su-ba(r).28 Vielleicht hat Hammurabi auf den Einschluß seiner Maßnahmen für densozialen Frieden im Lande in den Text seiner Gesetzesstele verzichtet, weil er diesevor seiner Statue “König der Gerechtigkeit” hat aufstellen lassen, auf der sicher einesolche “Königliche Verfügung” aufgezeichnet war. Damit war die literarische Tren-nung von Erlaß und Gesetzeskodifizierung vollzogen.Der Stil der kasuistisch formulierten Gesetze entspricht dem, was aus den spä-teren Rechtssammlungen bekannt ist: quasi zur Entscheidung anstehende exem-plarische Rechtsfälle werden als Bedingungssatz (perfektiv) stilisiert, gefolgt von derim Indikativ im kursiven Aspekt ausgedrückten Rechtsfolge im Nachsatz dazu. Ineinigen wenigen Fällen weicht der CU von diesem Schema ab und formuliert dieRechtsfolge ganz oder teilweise im Prekativ (§24 B iii 3u. 7u; §c4 D i 12). Keinerdieser Prekative gibt einen Wunsch wieder, sie sind vielmehr in konzedierenderFunktion gebraucht, auch wenn in §24 B iii 7u eine Forderung mitzuschwingenscheint: Die Möglichkeit, sich der Verpflichtung, eine Sklavin zu stellen, durch eineSilberzahlung zu entledigen, wird eingeräumt, wenn die Sach-Leistung unmöglichist. Die innere Ordnung des CU, soweit er sich z. Zt. wiederherstellen läßt, folgtdem von H. Petschow (1965, 1968a, 1968b) für die Gesetzestexte entdeckten undauch schon für den CU vermuteten Prinzip der Assoziation, unterscheidet sich aberin Vorgehen und Detail stark von dem zum CH zu Beobachtenden. Vor allem drei miteinander verwobene Hauptstränge scheinen das Werk zudurchziehen: das Interesse am Rechtsfrieden und der Ahndung von Verbrechenund Vergehen, das Interesse an der Familie, zuvörderst der Ehe, und schließlichSonderfälle aus dem Recht der Sklaven. Dazu kommt das starke Bestreben, in“Tarifen” Gebühren, Preise und die Höhe von Wiedergutmachungs-Zahlungenzu regeln.Dem Beginn mit den Strafen für Mord, Raub und Freiheitsentzug (§§1–3)folgt das Problem des freigelassenen verheirateten Sklaven (§4) und das von Statusund Erbrecht von Kindern aus der Ehe eines Sklaven mit einer Freien (§5), daranwerden wieder strafrechtliche Bestimmungen aus dem Bereich der Ehe angeschlo-ssen (§§6–7), daran einerseits die Bestrafung/Kompensation für die Vergewaltigungeiner Sklavin (§8) und Fragen des Ehescheidungsrechts (§§9–11 oder 12), gefolgt28. Beides wörtlich “freilassen”; s. auch Kienast 1982: 35f. mit Anm. 25 zu su-bar = wussurum inneusum. Briefen und altass.

Daran schließt der Paragraph über den zurückgewiesenen Schwiegersohn an(§15u), was nahelegt, daß an üble Nachrede als Ursache des Geschehens gedacht ist,wenngleich, anders als im §161 CH, nicht expressis verbis von calumnia die Redeist.29 Auch §16 (Sklavenflucht innerhalb der Stadt) kann in diesen Kontext ge-hören, falls es wie im §12 CL und §16 CH um Sklaven-Hehlerei geht, denn diesewird am ehesten durch Nachbarn bekannt. Der außerhalb der Stadt ergriffeneflüchtige Sklave schließt sinnvoll an (§17). Es folgt das große Kapitel “Körperver-letzung” mit einem “Tarif ” für unterschiedliche Tatbestände (§§18–26), an dessenEnde einerseits die Auslösung von Fehlgeburten bei Freien und Sklavinnen undandererseits die Ehr- und Körperverletzung der einer Ehefrau gleichgestelltenSklavin steht.Beim Wiedereinsetzen des Textes nach einer größeren Lücke folgen 2 Para-graphen über das Verhalten von Zeugen vor Gericht (§§a2–3) gefolgt—Stichwort-anschluß: “Prozeß”—von dem abermals durch eine kleinere Lücke unterbroch-enen Kapitel “Flurschäden und Feldarbeiten” mit einem “Tarif ” für die Tiermiete(§a8’). Warum mit §§a9u–10u nun das Erbrecht von Töchtern abgehandelt wird,kann ich nicht erkennen.Nach einer Lücke unbekannter Größe folgen Regelungen unter dem Stich-wort “Haus,” zunächst die Haftung des Hausbesitzers betreffend (§§c1–2), danachwieder ein “Tarif ” (Lohn für Baumeister?) in §c3, gefolgt von zwei Paragraphenaus dem Eherecht (Konkubinat mit Sklavin?), vielleicht weil das Haus-Personalbetroffen ist. Dann folgt nach einer weiteren Textlücke ein weiter aufgefächerter“Tarif ”: zunächst Arzthonorare, (§§d1–4), dann Lohn/Rationen für das weiblichePersonal in Staatsbetrieben (§§d5–7), gefolgt von Regelungen im Kreditwesen(§§d8–10), für die Feldpacht (§d11) und schließlich, nach einer neuerlichen Lücke,genormte Preise für den Hauskauf und die Hausmiete. Ein ins Einzelne gehender Vergleich der drei Gesetzestexte (und des Kodex Es-nuna) hinsichtlich der in ihnen behandelten Rechtsmaterie würde hier zu weitführen; er würde aber auch zeigen, daß die beiden sumerischen Kodizes einanderergänzen, der Kodex Hammurabi aber, wie es scheint, den Versuch unternimmt,das Material der früheren Kodizes dort, wo sich Überschneidungen ergeben, neuund umfassender zu behandeln.Kodex Urnamma Ai [dEn-líl][(Dem Gott) Enlil,][lugal kur-kur-ra][(dem) Herrn aller Länder—]29.

Ich vermute eine unterschiedliche Folge der Para-graphen über Sklavenflucht in A und B, da die erhaltenen Reste in A 315ff. zu B ii 24ff. parallel sindund weil ich eine Analogie zu CL §12 erwarte. Dementsprechend unterscheiden sich auch Lesungenund Ergänzungen.Die Größe der Lücke in Text B zwischen ii 35 und ii 1u schätzte Finkelstein als “consisting ofonly one line.” Bei unserer Rekonstruktion entspricht sie A vii 303–315, der letzten Zeile von A vii(Z. 324) und den ersten drei von A viii, d.h. ca. 15 Zeilen von Text A. Der Lücke zwischen B i undB ii stehen 25 Zeilen von A gegeüber. B ii 1uff. umfaßt 19 Zeilen; deren Zuordnung zu A 224ff. istnicht ganz deutlich, da B den Text der Paragraphen jeweils kürzt. B läßt auch schon A 321 aus; es istdarum zu erwarten, daß B auch den Text in der Lücke gekürzt hat. Aber oft entsprechen zwei Zeilenvon B nur einer in A. Darum rechne ich mit einem Abstand von ca. 10 Zeilen zwischen B ii 35 undB ii 1u (Kolumnenlänge ca. 66 Zeilen)."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Der Kodex Urnamma (CU): Versuch einer Rekonstruktion317[ . . . ][ . . . ][ . . . ][ . . . ](310) [ . . . ][ . . . ][ . . . ][ . . . ][ . . . ]A315[tukum-bi x x]-ªa?º§17u Wenn in? . . .Bii24f t[ukum-bi], x[x-a], A316ªgéme úrduº [x x]-ader oder die entflohene Sklavin oderBii26f gé[me úrdu], ba-[zàh-a]SklaveA317ki-sur-ra ªiriº-na-kadie Grenze ihrer/seiner Stadt Bii28f ki-[sur-ra], i[ri?-na-ka]überschrittenA318f íb-te-bala, lú ªimº-mi-gurhat, und jemand sie/ihn zurückbringt,Bii30f í[b-ta-bala], lú [im-mi-gur], A320lugal saF-Fá-ke4wird der Eigentümer des SklavenBii32ªlugalº [ . . . ]A321lú im-mi-in-gur-rademjenigen, der ihn zurückgebrachthat,A322f [2] gín kù-babbar, ì-lá-e2 Schekel Silber abwiegen.Bii33f 2 gín [kù], ì-n[a-lá-e]A324f tukumbi, [lú lú-ra]§18u Wenn jemand jemandemAviii2ff [ . . . ], [x x]-a-ni, mit [ . . . ] sein [ . . . ] abschneidet?,[ba]-ni-in-ku598Bii0u-2u [x x-a-ni], [x x-t]a, [íb-t]a-ku5 98.

Zu der genauen Entsprechung zum §111 CH siehe bereits Michalowski/ Walker 1989: 390.“5 Liter” statt “50 sìla” bei R. Borger 1982: 55 ist ein Versehen.127. Die Ergänzung nimmt mit Michalowski/Walker 1989: 387 und Roth 1995: 38 den in derUr III-Zeit üblichen Zinsfuß für Gerstedarlehen und in §d10 den für Silberdarlehen an.128. Vom §L des CH (und Section 18A des CE) unterscheiden sich dieser und der folgende §durch die eindeutige Aussage, daß die Zinsen auf ein Jahr berechnet sind. Die Höhe der Zinssätzeentspricht dem seit Alters in den Urkunden Üblichen. Skaist 1994 und Van de Mieroop 1995 fragenob der Zinssatz auf die Laufzeit von einem Jahr berechnet sei. Van de Mieroop hält das für ausge-schlossen, erklärt aber nicht, warum die genannten Zinssätze unabhängig von der Laufzeit des Dar-lehens stets konstant sind. Skaist läßt die Frage offen, ob jährlich oder nicht, kann aber auf Beispieleaus der Rechts-Ethnologie verweisen, denen zufolge feste Zinssätze unabhängig von der Dauer desKredits vorkommen. In der Tat läßt die Formulierung offen, ob der Zinssatz sich—sehr unwahr-scheinlich—auf das laufende Kalenderjahr bezieht, auf ein mit der Auszahlung der Kreditsumme be-ginnendes Jahr, während dessen Dauer der Zins (in voller Höhe) gefordert werden kann, oder um aufden Zeitraum eines Jahres kalkulierte Zinsen, die bei kürzerer oder längerer Laufzeit anteilig umge-rechnet werden. Wilcke 1996: 56–58 kann jährliche Verzinsung einer Schuldsumme für die prä-sargonische Zeit nachweisen. Jährlich berechnete Zinsen dokumentiert auch das Ur III-zeitlicheUrteil (Amarsuena 7 i) NRVN Nr. 2 (Wilcke 1990: 483–84), in dem die Formulierungen “wird erihm, von diesem Zeitpunkt an Zinsen darauf legen” und “von da an, daß es übergeben wurde, wirder Zinsen darauflegen” für eine anteilige Berechnung der Zinsen sprechen."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Claus Wilcke326Diiiu3u [tuk]um-bi 1 sar é [lú in-sa10]§e2(/q) Wenn jemand 1 sar Hausgrund[kù-b]i [ . . . ][kauft], [ist das Silber da]für [ . . . ].Diiiu5u [tuku]m-bi 1 sar ki[slah]§e3(/r) Wenn jemand 1 sar Hof[lú] in-sa10 kù-bi kauft, [ist] das Silber dafür 1 Schekel1 gín ªkù-*babbarº-[àm]Silber.Diiiu7u [tuku]m-bi 1 sar é-dù-ª*aº§e4(/s) Wenn jemand 1 sar gebautes[nam-ga]-ªtusº-e lú in-huF129Haus zum Bewohnen mietet, 1 gín kù-babbar ì-l[á-e]wird er 1 Schekel Silber abwiegen.Diiiu9u [lú m]u-sar-ra-ba su Wer diese Inschrift austilgt,130bí-íb-ùr-ru-amu-ni bí-í[b]-sar-re-aseinen Namen dorthinschreibt,[ás bala-a]-ba-ke4-es lú-kúrwegen dieses Fluches einen Anderensu ba-an-zi-zi-adie Hand erheben läßt,[mu-s]ar-ra-ba su sodaß dieser veranlaßt ist, dort, wo erbí-íb-ùr-ru-adiese mu nu-ªsar-dèºInschrift austilgt, einen nichtin-na-ab-*[s]ar131zu schreibenden Namen zu schreiben[lú-b]i lugal hé-a en hé-a —sei dieser Mensch ein König, ein“Herr” oderénsi hé-ªàmºsei er ein Stadtfürst—[Fisgu]-za gub-*b[a-ta s]ahar-ra von seinem hingestellten Thronhé-éb-t[a]-an-[tus]herab(gestürzt) soll er im Staubsitzen![iri-n]i gi-ªzúº-ta Seine Stadt soll ihn unter dem hé-eb-ta-dag-dag-geBaldachin weg vertreiben!Diii15u [iri]-ni iri dEn-líl nu-se-ga Seine Stadt soll zu einer Stadt gemachthé-awerden, der Enlil nicht wohlgesonnen ist![abull]a iri-na-ke4 ªFálºDie Stadttore seiner Stadt soll man[h]é-[é]b-ta6-ta6132öffnen! 129.
