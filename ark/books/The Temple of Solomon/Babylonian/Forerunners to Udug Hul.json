Although the general picture of incantation literature from the second millennium is not substantially altered, many new details emerge. It should be emphasized that the present volume is only one part of a larger project, which is now in progress, to publish all the Udug-hul incantations, in which many of the problems posed by these literary masterpieces will be more generally discussed. The presentation of this book, however, presupposes a specialist knowledge of Sumerian and Akkadian, as well as of the intellectual context in which these texts were composed and transmitted. Four scholars have made significant contributions to this volume, namely Thorkild Jacobsen, W.G. Lambert, D.O. Edzard, and I.L. Finkel, each of whom read the manuscript in its various stages and made many corrections and suggestions. I am grateful not only for their collaboration and advice, but also for the hospitality extended to me in Munich, Birmingham, and Bradford (N.H.). These scholars deserve credit for many of the insights into these texts, although the responsibility for errors is entirely my own. Access to this material was originally given to me by Prof. B.

Geller London, 1984 Forerunners to Udug-hul Introduction The incantations known as Udug-hul-a-kam rank as one of the most important collections of incantations from Mesopotamian antiquity, with exemplars spanning from the Old Akkadian to the Seleucid periods. These incantations have long been recognised for their philological and literary interest, and passages have been extensively quoted in the Akkadian dictionaries and in the secondary literature. In the many years that have elapsed since Reginald Campbell Thompson produced copies of these incantations in CT 16 and 17 (1903), with an accompanying edition of these texts in his Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia (1903-4), Campbell Thompson's work has never been superseded or replaced, despite the wealth of new sources which have been identified since his day. The present work is intended as a first step towards a scientific edition of the complete Udug-hul Series, known also by its Akkadian title, Utukku Lemnutu, which was compiled into a series consisting of sixteen tablets. The incantations edited in this volume comprise the Forerunners to Tablets 111-VIII of the Udug-hul Series, the tablets of Udug-hul best documented from second millennium sources.1 Many of the texts in this corpus were utilised by Adam Falkenstein in his analysis of the structure of Sumerian incantations, in his Haupttypen der Sumerischen Beschworung (LSS NF 1, 1931), although Falkenstein worked from inadequate photographs, which obscured many of the details of these incantations. Thanks to Professor B. Kienast, the author was able to make provisional copies from Falkenstein's photographs, which were later collated and corrected from the original tablets to produce the plates in this volume. Remarkably, many of Falkenstein's conclusions are still valid, but the material can now be evaluated on a more sound basis, from direct study of the tablets. It is somewhat unfair to the literary achievement of the Sumerian authors of these incantations to refer to them as \"forerunners\", with a retrospective arrogance which assumes that the literary pinnacle was the creation of a bilingual recension. No such slur is intended. The term \"forerunner\" serves merely as a convenient label, since the material is best known from Late Assyrian and Late Babylonian sources. On the contrary, studying the Forerunners to Udug-hul separately, rather than merely incorporating them into a Partitur of the Series, is intended to focus attention on the Sumerian of these incantations, and particularly the grammar and literary parallels, independent of the late duplicates.:! Most of these incantations will of course be re- edited together with the late Series, but with an entirely different emphasis. The Manuscripts The manuscripts of the Udug-hul Forerunners require special scrutiny, since they provide important evidence for the literary composition of Sumerian incantations. When taken together, they are witnesses to the fact that compilations of incantations were already taking place in the Old Babylonian period, although no evidence yet Preface 2 PREFACE The incantations included within this volume represent a harvest of new information concerning the languages, literature, and religion of Mesopotamia.

Geller London, 1984 3 Forerunners to Udug-hul Introduction The incantations known as Udug-hul-a-kam rank as one of the most important collections of incantations from Mesopotamian antiquity, with exemplars spanning from the Old Akkadian to the Seleucid periods. These incantations have long been recognised for their philological and literary interest, and passages have been extensively quoted in the Akkadian dictionaries and in the secondary literature. In the many years that have elapsed since Reginald Campbell Thompson produced copies of these incantations in CT 16 and 17 (1903), with an accompanying edition of these texts in his Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia (1903-4), Campbell Thompson's work has never been superseded or replaced, despite the wealth of new sources which have been identified since his day. The present work is intended as a first step towards a scientific edition of the complete Udug-hul Series, known also by its Akkadian title, Utukkii Lemniitu, which was compiled into a series consisting of sixteen tablets. The incantations edited in this volume comprise the Forerunners to Tablets III-VIII of the Udug-hul Series, the tablets of U dug-hul best documented from second millennium sources.l Many of the texts in this corpus were utilised by Adam Falkenstein in his analysis of the structure of Sumerian incantations, in his Haupttypen der Sumerischen Beschworung (LSS NF 1, 1931), although Falkenstein worked from inadequate photographs, which obscured many of the details of these incantations. Thanks to Professor B. Kienast, the author was able to make provisional copies from Falkenstein's photographs, which were later collated and corrected from the original tablets to produce the plates in this volume. Remarkably, many of Falkenstein's conclusions are still valid, but the material can now be evaluated on a more sound basis, from direct study of the tablets. It is somewhat unfair to the literary achievement of the Sumerian authors of these incantations to refer to them as \"forerunners\", with a retrospective arrogance which assumes that the literary pinnacle was the creation of a bilingual recension. No such slur is intended. The term \"forerunner\" serves merely as a convenient label, since the material is best known from Late Assyrian and Late Babylonian sources. On the contrary, studying the Forerunners to Udug-hul separately, rather than merely incorporating them into a Partitur of the Series, is intended to focus attention on the Sumerian of these incantations, and particularly the grammar and literary parallels, independent of the late duplicates) Most of these incantations will of course be re-edited together with the late Series, but with an entirely different emphasis. The Manuscripts The manuscripts of the Udug-hul Forerunners require special scrutiny, since they provide important evidence for the literary composition of Sumerian incantations. When taken together, they are witnesses to the fact that compilations of incantations were already taking place in the Old Babylonian period, although no evidence yet Preface 2 PREFACE The incantations included within this volume represent a harvest of new information concerning the languages, literature, and religion of Mesopotamia. Although the general picture of incantation literature from the secondmillennium is not substantially altered, many new details emerge. It should be emphasized that the present volume is only one part of a larger project, which is now in progress, to publish all the Udug-hul incantations, in which many of the problems posed by these literary masterpieces will be more generally discussed. The presentation of this book, however, presupposes a specialist knowledge ofSumerian and Akkadian, as weIl as ofthe intellectual context in which these texts were composed and transmitted. Four scholars have made significant contributions to this volume, namely Thorkild Jacobsen, W.G. Lambert, D.O. Edzard, and I.L. Finkei, each of whom read the manuscript in its various stages and made many corrections and suggestions. I am grateful not only for their collaboration and advice, but also for the hospitality extended to me in Munich, Birmingham, and Bradford (N.H.). These scholars deserve credit for many of the insights into these texts, although the responsibility for errors is entirely my own. Access to this material was originally given to me by Prof. B. Kienast, who sent me the photognfphs and his own transliterations of these texts, and I am grateful for his efforts as editor of the Freiburger Altorientalische Studien. I am particularly grateful to Veysel Donbaz and Fatma ytldlZ, and to the Director of the Istanbul Arkeoloji Müzeleri for many kindnesses and for permission to republish these tablets.

The following general observations can be made: Manuscripts G, H, I, and J in this corpus are all single-column tablets containing only one Udug-hul incantation. These tablets are all of similar appearance, and may in fact originate from the same literary archive, perhaps in Sippar. These manuscripts suggest that Udug-hul incantations existed individually prior to being collected under a general rubric (cf. Falkenstein, LSS NF18), since none of these incantations contains the rubric, ka-inim-ma udug-hul-a-kam. Similarly, Ms. L contains a single Udug-hul incantation on the obverse, but snake incantations on the reverse. The likelihood that these manuscripts were extracts from a collection of incantations is reduced by the fact that they lack Udug-hul rubrics. The multi-column library manuscripts from the Khabaza Collection and Nippur archives (Mss. A, B, C, D, E and F) represent literary compilations of Udug-hul incantations which are comparable to manuscripts of the later Series. Although most of the incantations can be identified in the Udug-hul Series, the sequential arrangement of the Forerunner incantations differs considerably from the arrangement of the sixteen-tablet Series, since most multi-column Forerunner manuscripts contained incantations from more than one tablet of the late composition.

The above factors in no way suggest, of course, that Ms. C should be disqualified as a Forerunner to Udug-hul. This tablet is only partially bilingual, since the glosses, written in a smaller script than the Sumerian, neither appear for every line, nor often translate more than merely the salient words in any one line.3 Moreover, the composition of the manuscript has much in common with other Forerunners. All incantations in Ms. C begin with the full en 6-nu-ru introductory formula, followed by the incipit, rather than the abbreviated single sign en which introduces incipits in late texts. More significant, even, is the complete absence of Udug-hul rubrics on the tablet, although the incantations themselves are mostly duplicated in CT 16 and are without doubt Udug-hul incantations; the only rubric which appears in full near the end of the tablet cannot be identified. Ms. C contains at least one line of text which appears in another Old Babylonian source but in none of the late duplicates (Cf. note to UHF 744). Finally, the order of incantations in Ms. C closely adheres to the sequence in the late duplicates, except for the fact that C contains incantations from Udug-hul Tablets VII and VIII (which is a single-incantation Tablet), and one final unidentified incantation. This follows the pattern of other multi-column Forerunners, all of which contain incantations from more than one Udug-hul Tablet grouped together in the same manuscript.4 Ms. C, like the other Forerunners, displays no evidence of belonging to a series or lengthy composition, although the sequence of incantations in C suggests that it may be a witness to the early formation of the Udug-hul Series. On these grounds one may suppose that Ms. C, probably dating from the Middle Babylonian period, represents a revised edition of an older Udug-hul textual tradition. 4) Ms. E (CBS 591) contains two incantations from UH VII, and one unidentified incantation. The following incipits of these incantations are known: UH VII a (CT 16 24:l): udug hul sila-ba a-ur-da Du-Du e-sir-ra Su-Su; duplicated in Mss. B, C, I, and J. UH VII b (CT 16 25:42): udug hul a-la hul 1u ge6-sa(var. bar)-a-de sila-a gib- ba; duplicated in Mss. B and C. The incantation in col. vi is unidentified. The tablet has not been recopied, since the surface is now more damaged than indicated on Lutz's copy (PBS I12 127). 5) Ms. F (CBS 1532) contains five incantations, of which one is unidentified (col. iv). The incantations are known with the following incipits: UH VII d (CT 16 37:14): udug hul an-edin-na DU-a; also duplicated in Ms. C. 9 Forerunners to Udug-hul UH VI g (CT 16 32:156): udug hul-gal gidim cialla edin-na unidentified incantation [. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .I with incipit lost. UH VI a (CT 16 30:l): udug hul-gal gidim idim kur-ra UH VI b (CT 16 30:66): udug hul-gal nam-ba-te-geZ6-e-de The tablet has not been recopied, since pieces have broken off since being copied by Lutz (PBS 112 1281, which leaves Lutz's copy, despite some errors, as the best remaining record of the tablet. 6) Ms. H (BM 78 185) was previously copied by Pinches and reproduced in CT 44 3 1, but although remarkable for its time, Pinches' copy was only preliminary, and so many corrections were required that the tablet has been recopied (Pl. 15-1 6). The manuscript is extremely important, not only as the sole surviving Old Babylonian exemplar of this incantation, but because the verbal forms with complete suffixes are meticulously written. This manuscript also resembles the opening lines of Inanna's Descent. 7) Ms. L (IM 21 180) is the only exemplar among the Forerunners of this incantation from Udug-hul V. The writing e-ne-ne (UHF 362 and 369) for late e-ne-ne-ne (CT 16 12:12 and 28) may point to an older orthography. Furthermore, Ms. L lacks many of the grammatical elements which appear in the Sumerian of the Iate duplicates: an-na rgur5 bi-ibl-bur rki-karl bi-'ib-sigl (=UHF 361) an-na gur5(-ru)-ui bi-in-bu-ru-US ki-ta kar-ra bi-in-sig-g[a] (= CT 16 12:9-10) Grammar These incantations are of the utmost importance for the reconstruction of Sumerian grammar of the Old Babylonian period, since the morphology conforms to the paradigms in the grammatical lists, with grammatical elements more fully preserved than in corresponding late duplicates. Consequently, studies of Sumerian grammar which rely heavily upon CT 16 or 17 for attestations may require some revision in the light of these sources. It must be stressed, however, that morphological or orthographic differences between the Forerunners and late duplicates may not a priori prove that the late forms are incorrect, misunderstood, or carelessly copied, since late texts from Babylon, Sippar, or Kuyunjik may retain alternative grammatical forms which may differ from Nippur traditions, but have equal validity. A systematic comparison between the Sumerian grammar of the Forerunner and late duplicates must await the publication of the Udug-hul Series, with a complete notation of all variants, but the following examples should indicate general categories of grammatical differences between early and late texts: Introduction 8 different from Ms. F (cf. note to UHF 828-831). Moreover, like late duplicates, Ms. C omits the repetition of the \"diagnosis\" within the framework of the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue (cf. Falkenstein LSS NFl 54), in contrast to Ms. F (cf. UHF 809-825). These factors suggest a date for Ms. C later than that of the Old Babylonian sources, A, B, E, and F.

More significant, even, is the complete absence ofUdug-hul rubrics on the tablet, although the incantations themselves are mostly duplicated in CT 16 and are without doubt Udug-hul incantations; the only rubric which appears in full near the end of the tablet cannot be identified. Ms. C contains at least one line of text which appears in another Old Babylonian source but in none of the late duplicates (Cf. note to UHF 744). Finally, the order of incantations in Ms. C closely adheres to the sequence in t1!.e late duplicates, except for the fact that C contains incantations from Udug-hul Tablets VII and VIII (which is a single-incantation Tablet), and one final unidentified incantation.1fhis follows the pattern of other multi-column Forerunners, all of which contain incantations from more than one Udug-hul Tablet grouped together in the same manuscript.4 Ms. C, like the other Forerunners, displays no evidence of belonging to a series or lengthy composition, although the sequence of incantations in C suggests that it may be a witness to the early formation of the Udug-hul Series. On these grounds one may suppose that Ms. C, probably dating from the Middle Babylonian period, represents a revised edition of an older U dug-hul textual tradition. 4) Ms. E (CBS 591) contains two incantations from UH VII, and one unidentified incantation. The following incipits of these incantations are known: UH VII a (CT 1624:1): UH VII b (CT 1625:42): udug hul sila-ba a-ur-da DU-DU e-sir-ra su-su; duplicated in Mss. B, C, I, and J. udug hul a-I a hullu ge6-Sa(var. bar)-a-se sila-a gib-ba; duplicated in Mss. Band C. The incantation in col. vi is unidentified. The tablet has not been recopied, since the surface is now more damaged than indicated on Lutz's copy (PBS 1/2 127). 5) Ms. F (CBS 1532) contains five incantations, of which one is unidentified (col. iv). The incantations are known with the following incipits: UH VII d (CT 16 37:14): udug hul an-edin-na Du-a; also duplicated in Ms. C. 9 UH VI g (CT 16 32:156): unidentified incantation with incipit lost. UH VI a (CT 1630:1): UH VI b (CT 1630:66): Forerunners to Udug-hul udug hul-gal gidim dalla edin-na [ ................ J udug hul-gal gidim idim kur-ra udug hul-gal nam-ba-te-ge26-e-de The tablet has not been recopied, since pieces have broken off since being copied by Lutz (PBS 1/2 128), which leaves Lutz's copy, despite some errors, as the best remaining record of the tablet. 6) Ms. H (BM 78185) was previously copied by Pinches and reproduced in CT 44 31, but although remarkable for its time, Pinches' copy was only preliminary, and so many corrections were required that the tablet has been recopied (PI. 15-16). The manuscript is extremely important, not only as the sole surviving Old Babylonian exemplar of this incantation, but because the verbal forms with complete suffixes are meticulously written. This manuscript also resembles the opening lines of Inanna's Descent. 7) Ms. L (1M 21180) is the only exemplar among the Forerunners of this incantation from Udug-hul V. The writing e-ne-ne (UHF 362 and 369) for late e-ne-ne-ne (CT 16 12: 12 and 28) may point to an older orthography. Furthermore, Ms. L lacks many of the grammatical elements which appear in the Sumerian of the late duplicates: an-na rgurs bi-ib1-bUr rki-karl bi-qb-sig1 (= UHF 361) an-na gurs(-ru)-us bi-in-bu-ru-us ki-ta kar-ra bi-in-sig-g[a] (= CT 16 12:9-10) Grammar These incantations are of the utmost importance for the reconstruction of Sumerian grammar of the Old Babylonian period, since the morphology conforms to the paradigms in the grammatical lists, with grammatical elements more fully preserved than in corresponding late duplicates. Consequently, studies of Sumerian grammar which rely heavily upon CT 16 or 17 for attestations may require some revision in the light of these sources. It must be stressed, however, that morphological or orthographic differences between the Forerunners and late duplicates may not a priori prove that the late forms are incorrect, misunderstood, or carelessly copied, since late texts from Babylon, Sippar, or Kuyunjik may retain alternative grammatical forms which may differ from Nippur traditions, but have equal validity. A systematic comparison between the Sumerian grammar of the Forerunner and late duplicates must await the publication of the Udug-hul Series, with a complete notation of all variants, but the following examples should indicate general categories of grammatical differences between early and late texts: Introduction 8 different from Ms. F (cf. note to UHF 828-831). Moreover, like late duplicates, Ms. C omits the repetition of the \"diagnosis\" within the framework of the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue (cf. Falkenstein LSS NFl 54), in contrast to Ms. F (cf. UHF 809-825). These factors suggest a date for Ms. C later than that of the Old Babylonian sources, A, B, E, and F. The above factors in no way suggest, of course, that Ms. C should be disqualified as a Forerunner to Udug-hul. This tablet is only partially bilingual, since the glosses, written in a smaller script than the Sumerian, neither appear for every line, nor often translate more than merely the salient words in anyone line) Moreover, the composition of the manuscript has much in common with other Forerunners. All incantations in Ms. C begin with the full en e-nu-ru introductory formula, followed by the incipit, rather than the abbreviated single sign en which introduces incipits in late texts. More significant, even, is the complete absence ofUdug-hul rubrics on the tablet, although the incantations themselves are mostly duplicated in CT 16 and are without doubt Udug-hul incantations; the only rubric which appears in full near the end of the tablet cannot be identified. Ms. C contains at least one line of text which appears in another Old Babylonian source but in none of the late duplicates (Cf. note to UHF 744). Finally, the order of incantations in Ms. C closely adheres to the sequence in t1!.e late duplicates, except for the fact that C contains incantations from Udug-hul Tablets VII and VIII (which is a single-incantation Tablet), and one final unidentified incantation.1fhis follows the pattern of other multi-column Forerunners, all of which contain incantations from more than one Udug-hul Tablet grouped together in the same manuscript.4 Ms. C, like the other Forerunners, displays no evidence of belonging to a series or lengthy composition, although the sequence of incantations in C suggests that it may be a witness to the early formation of the Udug-hul Series.

A full treatment of the variations will have to take into account conflicting manuscript traditions in the late copies. Finally, the third plural marc verbal suffix -NE is always rendered as -de in this corpus, following Jacobsen's suggestion in AS 16 9919, for which supporting evidence is cited in the Commentary below. The Role of Asalluhi in Forerunners to Udug-hul In Falkenstein's classic study of the literary patterns of Sumerian incantations, he assumed the roles of Enki and Asalluhi to be identical with those of Ea and Marduk, even referring to the ubiquitous dialogue between Enki and Asalluhi as the \"Marduk- Ea-Typ\" (LSS NFI 44ff.). Since no attempt was made to separate the Forerunners from later duplicates, Falkenstein's treatment begs the fundamental question as to whether Enki-Ea and Asalluhi-Marduk can be assumed to be identical gods in incantations from early periods. The discussion has most recently been taken up by W. Sommerfeld (AOAT 21 3 16- 18), who argues that Asalluhi and Marduk were identified in the Old Babylonian period, partially because '\"eide Gotter sehr ahnliche Ziige hatten\" (ibid. 16), and because at least one Old Babylonian bilingual incantation, CT 4 8a, translates Asalluhi's name with that of Marduk. The problem with this focus on the identification of Asalluhi and Marduk is that it obscures some of Asalluhi's individual characteristics, partially because of Marduk's rise to prominence in the Old Babylonian period. The Forerunners to Udug-hul offer some insights into Asalluhi, independent of his Marduk connections. Forerunners to Udug-hul It must be noted, first of all, that no positive evidence has yet appeared to corroborate Asalluhi's role in incantations as an exorcist. In the Temple Hymns, for instance, Asalluhi of Ku'ar is referred to as 1u kal-kal \"the esteemed one\" (Sjoberg TCS 3 25: 140)5, in contrast to Ningublaga, Baba, and Ninisinna, who are called mag-maS or a-zu-gal (ibid. lines 150,268, and 390). Similarly, the Old Babylonian hymn to Asalluhi of Ku'ar (UET 6 69) makes no specific reference to him as exorcist or healer. The silence of these sources may be entirely coincidental, since Asalluhi may have been \"esteemed\" (kal) as a healer, but thus far incantation texts comprise the only surviving sources on Asalluhi as an exorcist. Nevertheless, the possibility may be entertained that Asalluhi's role as exorcist may have stemmed from the proximity of Ku'ar to Eridu,6 which resulted in the merging of the Eridu and Ku'ar pantheons, with the two patron gods of each city, Enki and Asalluhi, becoming associated as father and son.7 Once Asalluhi of Ku'ar was known as a citizen (or son) of Eridu and chief son of Enki, he shared the tasks of exorcism with Enki, whose own participation in incantations and magic is unquestionably early.8 The above hypothesis contradicts a theory posited by van Dijk, that since Ku'ar was a city known as \"non-Sumerian speakingW9 as well as the city of Asalluhi, \"Grossexorzist von Eridu\", it is tempting to identify Ku'ar as the home of the non- canonical incantations in Subarian-Elamite languages.10 Van Dijk's arguments, however, are partially based upon a miscopied sign in CT 16 6:239-240 (collated) which reads: eridukl ku7ar(A.H~)kl-Si: mu-un-na-ri rhk?l-me-en Sci ina eri4-durO u ku-ma-ri 'rel-hu-ti ana-ku The reading ku-ma-ri (= kuwarilKu'ar) is supported by ku-mar (CT 51 10521-22)11, although van Dijk, following Gelb (Hurrians 94ff.) read Su-ba-ru, associating A.HA~~ with Subaru, and hence with the Subarian-Elamite incantations. Once this reference to Ku'ar as Subaru is removed, van Dijk's argument is weakened, since Ku'ar cannot be definitely associated with the incantations at all, nor can Asalluhi of Ku'ar be considered on apriori grounds a god of exorcism, before his adoption by Enki into the Eridu pantheon. It is clear that by the Ur 111 period, Asalluhi appears prominently in incantations, together with Enki and Ningirimma, by virtue of his titles as \"son of Enki\" and \"son of Eridu\", but in a position which was relatively subordinate to the senior gods of exorcism. Falkenstein drew attention to an Ur 111 example of the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue, in which Asalluhi personally introduced the patient to Enki: dasal-lu-hi-e den-ki-Se 1u mu-Si-in-gi4-gi4 \"Asalluhi introduced the man to Enki\",l2 while in a late incantation Enki himself noted the patient's discomfort, without benefit of Asalluhi as intermediary.13 These illustrations of Asalluhi's subordinate role are supported by evidence from the Udug-hul Forerunners, in which Asalluhi's name is on several occasions omitted in an Old Babylonian manuscript, but his name is supplied by late duplicates.

The Role of Asalluhi in Forerunners to Udug-hul In Falkenstein's classic study of the literary patterns of Sumerian incantations, he assumed the roles of Enki and Asalluhi to be identical with those of Ea and Marduk, even referring to the ubiquitous dialogue between Enki and Asalluhi as the \"Marduk-Ea-Typ\" (LSS NFl 44ff.).

Finally, Asalluhi's name may even be omitted in the late Series, as in two unpublished duplicates to CT 16 37, with variants which read: [ga-e 161 dasal-lu-hi (var. eriduki-ga) me-en. Although Asalluhi's name does appear elsewhere in UHF in Legitimationstyp sequences (cf. UHF 160,201,212), it is nevertheless apparent that the Old Babylonian text perceived a slightly different role for Asalluhi to that which appears in the late Series. The decisive difference is that in the late Series the incantation priest claims to be the representative of Enki, Damgalnunna, and Asalluhi, while in the Forerunners the incantation priest identifies his own role with that of Asalluhi, as personal messenger of Enki and Damgalnunna. In UHF 6 and 36, for instance, the incantation priest recites that he is the man of Enki and Damgalnnunna, or that he is the man of Enki (\"I am his messenger\"); for both passages the corresponding late duplicates read \"I am the messenger of Asalluhi\".~4 In UHF, the incantation priest himself assumes Asalluhi's role as the messenger of Enki. Similarly, the oft-repeated line, \"the great lord Enki has sent me\" (UHF 38 et passim), expresses the incantation priest's claim to be sent directly by Enki, in the same way that Enki so frequently says, \"go my son, Asalluhi. . .\"I5 Moreover, the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue itself is intended to identify the incantation priest with Asalluhi, particularly in its early form in which Asalluhi introduces the patient to Enki, much as the priest might do, or as the suppliant was 15 Forerunners to Udug-hul introduced to the deity in cylinder seal representations (e.g. von der Osten, OIP 22, plates 12-13, 15-16). Enki's polite question to Asalluhi in the dialogue, \"what do I know that you do not already know ?\" was intended to enhance the prestige of Asalluhi and the incantation priest so as to inspire confidence in the patient, although in reality the correct remedy is transmitted directly from Enki himself. The Enki-AsaIluhi dialogue in its original form was not a discussion between colleagues about diagnosis, but instructions from the divine exorcist to his servantlson. Thus Asalluhi's role in these incantations cannot be equated with that of Enki's. The evidence, in fact, from UHF suggests that Asalluhi originally acted as a functionary, able to apply Eridu incantations, but he lacked independent authority as an exorcist. This view of Asalluhi which emerges from the Forerunners (but not the late Series) of Udug-hul has a bearing upon the question of the identification of Asalluhi and Marduk. There is unambiguous evidence from UHF that Asalluhi and Marduk are not identified, since they occur together in one passage in distinctly different postures. The passage (UHF 178- 179) reads that although the patient was already on his way to the Netherworld, \"Marduk cannot release him . . . .\", while just at this point Asalluhi noticed the patient's plight, and hastened to his father Enki (UHF 180-181). The juxtaposition of Marduk and Asalluhi here highlights the contrast between Marduk's powerlessness or refusal to assist the victim and Asalluhi's effectiveness in securing a remedy from Enki.16 Introduction UHF A) 4-6: [ga-e lu deJn-ki-ga me-en [ga-e lu dda]m-gal-nun-na me-en [ga-e lu kin-g]i4-en-am B) 36-37 [ga-e lu] den-ki-ga me-en [ga-e]lu kin-gi4-a-ni me-en C) 102 Late UET 691:2-4 ga-e lu den-ki-ga me-en ga-e lu ddam-gal-nun me-en ga-e lu kin-gi4-a dasal-Iu-hi me-en CT 162:65-67 ga-e lu den-ki-ga me-en ga-e lu ddam-gal-nun-na me-en ga-e lu kin-gi4-a dasal-Iu-hi me-en CT 166206 ga-e lu kin-gi4-a dasal-Iu-hi me-en 14 Even where mentioned, a reference to Asalluhi in UHF may not correspond to the late duplicates, as in the following extract (UHF 59-60, duplicated in CT 17 48 e-g): UHF [aFda-pa1 [abgal eriduk]Lga me-en [ga-e lu(?) das]al-lu-hi me-en Late a-da-pa abgal eridukLga me-en ga-e lu mUrmu7 den-ki-ga me-en ga-e lu kin-gi4-a dasal-Iu-hi me-en The late text transformed the passage into a traditional Legitimationstyp sequence, whereas the Forerunner associated Asalluhi with the legendary Adapa, who had no status within the hierarchy of divinities. Finally, Asalluhi's name may even be omitted in the late Series, as in two unpublished duplicates to CT 1637, with variants which read: [ga-e lu] dasal-lu-hi (var. eridukLga) me-en. Although Asalluhi's name does appear elsewhere in UHF in Legitimationstyp sequences (cf. UHF 160, 201, 212), it is nevertheless apparent that the Old Babylonian text perceived a slightly different role for Asalluhi to that which appears in the late Series. The decisive difference is that in the late Series the incantation priest claims to be the representative of Enki, Damgalnunna, and Asalluhi, while in the Forerunners the incantation priest identifies his own role with that of Asalluhi, as personal messenger of Enki and Damgalnunna. In UHF 6 and 36, for instance, the incantation priest recites that he is the man of Enki and Damgalnnunna, or that he is the man of Enki (\"I am his messenger\"); for both passages the corresponding late duplicates read \"I am the messenger of Asalluhi\".14 In UHF, the incantation priest himself assumes Asalluhi's role as the messenger ofEnki. Similarly, the oft-repeated line, \"the great lord Enki has sent me\" (UHF 38 et passim), expresses the incantation priest's claim to be sent directly by Enki, in the same way that Enki so frequently says, \"go my son, Asalluhi ... \" 15 Moreover, the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue itself is intended to identify the incantation priest with Asalluhi, particularly in its early form in which Asalluhi introduces the patient to Enki, much as the priest might do, or as the suppliant was 15 Forerunners to Udug-hul introduced to the deity in cylinder seal representations (e.g. von der Osten, OIP 22, plates 12-13, 15-16). Enki's polite question to Asalluhi in the dialogue, \"what do I know that you do not already know?\" was intended to enhance the prestige of Asalluhi and the incantation priest so as to inspire confidence in the patient, although in reality the correct remedy is transmitted directly from Enki himself. The Enki-Asalluhi dialogue in its original form was not a discussion between colleagues about diagnosis, but instructions from the divine exorcist to his servant/son. Thus Asalluhi's role in these incantations cannot be equated with that of Enki's. The evidence, in fact, from UHF suggests that Asalluhi originally acted as a functionary, able to apply Eridu incantations, but he lacked independent authority as an exorcist. This view of Asalluhi which emerges from the Forerunners (but not the late Series) of Udug-hul has a bearing upon the question of the identification of Asalluhi and Marduk.

The notion of the incantation priest being sent directly by the god(s) has a late parallel in a Syriac incantation bowl from Nippur, which reads: mry' smys elk slJ:my syn' sdrny by pqdny nn'y 'mr ly wnbw tbyz kbynh wnyryg yhb ly b[Y]1' d'zyl elh wei rwb' byst' \"Lord Samail dispatched me to you, Sin sent me, Bel appointed me, Nanay ordered me, and Nabu ... , and Nergal gave me the power, that I might go against her (the demon), and against the evil spirit\" (l.A. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur 36:2-4, and pl. xxxii). 15An alternative scheme might be that the incantation priest views himself as the incarnation or embodiment of Asalluhi. The Sumerian is ambiguous, since one cannot distinguish between Asalluhi and Asalluhi(k), \"(I am the messenger,) Asalluhi\" or \"(messenger) of Asalluhi\". Although the Akkadian translation always reads \"messenger of Asalluhi\", the former notion could be understood in the statement \"the great lord Enki sent me\", i.e. the incantation priest in the identity of Asalluhi. Furthermore, in CT 16 6 237-244, the incantation priest clearly speaks as if in the person of Asalluhi: \"I am the incantation priest who is born in Eridu, I am he who was spawned in Eridu and Ku'ar. As I approach the sick man, may Enki, lord of the Abzu watch over me\". This description can only apply to Asalluhi, the incantation priest par excellencp. 16The distinction between Asalluhi and Marduk may be implied in the late incantation (BAM 510 iv 38) which reads EN dasal-Iu-hi EN damar-utu EN dnin-gi-rim-rna EN EN. Introduction 16 Footnotes to the introduction IThe present collection does not include all known forerunners to the whole ofUdug-hul, since the isolated forerunners to other Udug-hul tablets do not constitute a single lengthy compilation, as do the Forerunners to Udug-hul UI-VIII. It is not certain, moreover, that an of the sixteen tablets of the late Series had forerunners, since some tablets may contain later compositions added to the early core of incantations. Middle Assyrian forerunners to Udug-hul are known, namely KAR 24 and Iraq 42 44-45, and one unpublished Middle Babylonian forerunner, 12 N 228, will be published together with the late Series. Other examples are known of Old Babylonian tablets bearing the rubric ka-inim-ma udug-hul-a-kam, such as TCL 1663, or YOS 11 70 and 72, but the content ofthese manuscripts is not sufficiently like other Forerunners to Udug-hul or like the late Series to be edited here; they are discussed in the commentary. 2When dealing with bilinguals, one is always tempted to explain th<; Sumerian on the basis of the Akkadian translation. The dilemma is how to use the Akkadian as valid ancient evidence for textual interpretation, but concomitantly to treat the Sumerian independently, as far as the limitations of our knowledge of Sumerian vocabulary and grammar allow. 3The fact that a tablet is bilingual cannot serve as a basis for dating, since at least two Old Babylonfan incantations exist which contain complete interlinear translations (CT 4 8a, and PBS 1/2 122). One can only use such information as a general guide, since glosses in a sm aller script are a common feature of Old Babylonian Sumerian literary compositions, while complete translations are common in the late periods. 4Cf. Reiner, Surpu 5-6 on the discrepancies in Kuyunjik sources for designations of tablet numbers. The problem is quite different for Udug-hul, since such discrepancies between tablet designations do not exist in Kuyunjik sources, and the combinations of incantations from different tab lets on a single manuscript seem to be characteristic of the Forerunners only. 5Cf. the early reference to the god in Biggs OIP 99 47:33-34: ku'ar(HA.A) nun ir dasar lu kaI 6Cf. Jacobsen AS 11 705, in which Ku'ar appears as a variant for Eridu, and TCS 3 25:135, in which Ku'ar is associated with the Abzu. 7W.G. Lambert, UnDiv. 193f. This assumes, of course, that at one time Eridu and Ku'ar were separate cities, each with its own pantheon. 8Enki and Ningirimma are the two deities most frequently cited in Ebla incantations. Cf. Pettinato OA 18 349 No. 24:6ff.: nu-nu dnin-girimma den-ki lugal abzu-ta tuxCUO)-duu-ga dnin-girimma. 9Cf. VAS 17 9, and van Dijk, apud H. Nissen and J. Renger BBVO 1,97.

The incantations follow, as far as is possible, the sequence from the late Series. The line numbering, therefore, is not intended to represent either a connected text of a single composition or the numbering of lines on any single manuscript, but merely a convenient designation for lines of the UHF text, and the line numbering is consequently provisional. Missing text within a line is schematically indicated by dots between square brackets, without attempting to represent the exact number of missing signs. The rulings setting off the ka-inim-ma rubrics do not in many instances reflect rulings on the manuscript, but merely represent the conventional manner in which many scribes designated the end of an incantation. The restorations are based almost entirely upon a Partitur of all of the late duplicates, without any attempt to alter late grammatical forms to conform to the Forerunner texts. Any theoretical restorations are discussed in the Commentary. Many of the late duplicates are awaiting publication as part of the late Udug-hul Series, so that references to CT 16 and published sources are often supplemented by unpublished duplicates, which are not specified in the Commentary. All published texts have been collated, wherever possible. Finally, since the present edition is intended to focus on the Forerunners only, gaps which can be restored from late duplicates are supplemented in the Commentary, but with few exceptions, lines are not restored in the edition itself when no traces of the line are preserved in Forerunner manuscripts.

Finally, since the present edition is intended to focus on the Forerunners only, gaps which can be restored from late duplicates are supplemented in the Commentary, but with few exceptions, lines are not restored in the edition itself when no traces of the line are preserved in Forerunner manuscripts."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"{-la an-na mu-un-nigin-nlgln-naJ mir-gin7 ki-a mu-un-du7-du7-a] ug hul-gal-e sila mu-un-gurl 0-gur lo-ra] lad hul-gal-e uls-lu-gin7 mu-un]-rdal-dul-dul-la -hal-la mu-un-da-ru-u]S lu-ulu!-bi ba-an-gaz-eS -bi nu-un-zu ki] tu-ra ba-nu [ga-e lu deln-ki-ga me-en 5 A (i 5) [ga-e lu ddalm-gal-nun-na me-en 6 A [en-gal den-ki-ke4 mu-un-Si-in-g]i4-en-am 7 A [lu-tu-ra-56 mu-un-Si-in-te-g]e26-en-na 8 A [k-na mu-un-Si-in-k]u4-re-en-na 9 A [Su-mu sag-ga-na mu-un-Si-in-ga]r!-re-en-na 10 A (i 10) [sa-6-Su-giri-bi mu-un-zu]-zu-un-na 11 A [nam-Sub eriduki-ga mu-un-Si-in-gall-en-na 12 A [lu-tu-ra nam-8ub mu-un-Si-in-sum-m]a-ta Gap of 14 lines in the late text (see Commentary) B [den-lil-la lugal kur-kur-ra-ke4 e-ne-ne-ne] 1[u kin]-g[i4-a-me51 [udug hull edin-na lu-ra ba-a[n-gaz] 'a-lal(?)

According to Yoshikawa (Or NS 43 18-21), the marc can be expressed either through reduplicating the hamtu-root (mu-R-R-a), or through hamfu-root + /e/ (mu-R-e), so that in this instance /ga-gal and /gal-e/ or /gar-e/ would all be alternative marc forms. No explanation is offered, however, to explain the difference between these forms. Particularly interesting variant verbal forms with gar appear in Gilgamesh and Agga 8 and 14 (cf.

Jacobsen AS 16 73): There seems to be a syntactical relationship expressed here which does not conform to our standard grammar. One possible solution to the problem of the verbal forms in our UHF text is that consistency is not intended in the Sumerian text, but rather that a sequence of events is introduced by verbs in the \"punctive\" aspect, and then resumed by \"durative\" verbal forms (cf. Jacobsen AS 16 98b for a similar case). The punctive/hamfu forms would thus serve as a \"future-perfect\" form, i.e. \"as I approach . . . when I (will have) enter(ed) . . . after I (will have) place(d) my hand . . . then I will know. . .\" The use of gar + /e/ as a type of \"future-perfect\" was not understood by later scribes, since no such distinction in verbal aspect could be indicated in the Akkadian translation, and duplicates recorded the verbal form simply as mu-un-Si-in-gar-ra (UET 6 391:7 and duplicates). The verbal form appears to be nam-Sub-sum rather than nam-Sub-si, despite the Akkadian translation ina nadgja (CT 16 1:7). Similarly cf. KAR 3 1%-4: tu(j ku-ga-bi ba-ra-ab-sum-mu-US // Sipassunu elletu iddinunimma, indicating sum = nadznu. Cf. also UHF 230 (tug-sum).

The MaSkim demon, as counterpait to the maikim \"court bailiff', may represent the misuse of authority to terrorize innocent victims. Restored from CT 16 1:26-3: 107(+ CT 17 47). For a hint to the character of the Galla demon, cf. AfO 7 274:21 gal5-la = sahds'u, which appears to be synonymous with ba'zru \"to catch (people or animals)\" (cf. AHw 1008), explaining the role of the Galla demons as the Netherworld gendarmes [Jacobsen]. The verbal form ba-ni-dab5-dab5-ba indicates either plurality of the subject or repetition of action in the hamfu mode (cf. Edzard ZA 61 228, Jacobsen AS 16 96), in contrast to the form in late duplicates, ba-ni-ib-dab- dab-bt // ikammz2 (CT 16 1:32), which is marii (durative). For a reading of d~i~.~~ as dgabagku, cf. Tonietti Or NS 48 308. For the use of /ED/ in the \"Normalform\", cf. Edzard ZA 62 2 and ZA 66 46. The difficulty is that if /ED/ indicates a marc form, the verb /bu-bu-ed-eS/ in this context occurs in a sequence of verbs in hamfu plural mode: mu-un-na-te-e5 (1 9) mi-ni-in-gar-re-e5 (20) im-mi-in-gar-re-ei (22) etc. Jacobsen's explanation (AS 16 98) of a prospective or \"pre-actional\" /ED/ might fit our context, i.e. the ghost, \"about to roam about in the desert\", approached the victim. The verbal form i-bu-bu-dBeS appears differently in later texts: al-bu-bu(var. bu-bu)-de-di: // ittanaSrabbi.tzi (CT 17 4: lO/STT 192:5), which may indicate an alternative \"Normalform\" third plural ending in /dk/ as well as /eS/ (so Jacobsen AS 16 99a). In bilinguals, the distinction between forms with and without /ED/ cannot be indicated in the Akkadian translation; cf. for example, lil-gin7 i-bu-bu // ittanairabbi~zi (CT 17 295). For an explanation of Iu pap-hal-la (= muttalliku) which differs from the dictionary definitions (AHw 689b, CAD M* 306), cf. J. Proseckjr in the Commentary 86 12 Yoshikawa proposes to analyse such forms as gar and gal above as hamtu-root + lei, representing an alternative maru category (cf. MSL 4 87). According to Yoshikawa (Or NS 43 18-21), the maru can be expressed either through reduplicating the hamtu-root (mu-R-R-0), or through hamtu-root + lei (mu-R-e), so that in this instance Iga-gal and Igal-el or Igar-el would all be alternative maru forms. No explanation is offered, however, to explain the difference between these forms. Particularly interesting variant verbal forms with gar appear In Gilgamesh and Agga 8 and 14 (cf. Romer AOAT 209/1 24-25): 8) nam-ba(-an)-ga-ga-an-de-en, (nam-)ba-an-gar-re-en-de-en, nam-ba-an-gar-re-en-ze-en, 14) nam-ba-ga-ga-an-de-en, ba -an-gar-re-en-{ en }-de-en, ga-am-ga~ga-an-de-en, ga -am-sig!-sig-ge-en-de-en! nam-ba-an-sig-ge-en-de-en [missingj ga -am -sig!-sig-ge-en -de-en nam-ba-an-sig-ge-en-de-en nam-ba-sig-ge-en-de-en The difficulties with gar (and sig) not only appear in the alternative forms ga-ga and gar + lei, but also in the use of cohortative ga-with maru-roots ga-ga-and sig-sig, which theoretically should not occur (cf. Jacobsen AS 16 73j~. There seems to be a syntactical relationship expressed here which does not conform to our standard grammar.

AHw 1008), explaining the role of the Galla demons as the Netherworld gendarmes [Jacobsen]. The verbal form ba-ni-dabs-dabs-ba indicates either plurality of the subject or repetition of action in the hamtu mode (cf. Edzard ZA 61 228, Jacobsen AS 1696), in contrast to the form in late duplicates, ba-ni-ib-dab-dab-be II ikammu (CT 16 1:32), which is maru (durative). For a reading of dDIM.ME as dgabasku, cf. Tonietti Or NS 48 308. For the use of IEDI in the \"Normalform\", cf. Edzard ZA 62 2 and ZA 66 46. The difficulty is that if IEDI indicates a maru form, the verb Ibu-bu-ed-esl in this context occurs in a sequence of verbs in hamtu plural mode: mu-un-na-te-es (19) mi-ni-in-gar-re-eS (20) im-mi-in-gar-re-es (22) etc. Jacobsen's explanation (AS 1698) of a prospective or \"pre-actional\" IEDI might fit our context, i.e. the ghost, \"about to roam about in the desert\", approached the victim. The verbal form i-bu-bu-de-es appears differently in later texts: al-bu-bu(var. bu-bu)-de-de I I ittanasrabbi!u (CT 174: 10lSTT 192:5), which may indicate an alternative \"Normalform\" third plural ending in Idel as well as le'Sl (so Jacobsen AS 16 99a). In bilingmils, the distinction between forms with and without IEDI cannot be indicated in the Akkadian translation; cf. for example, IiI-gin7 i-bu-bu I I ittanasrabbi,tu (CT 17 29:5). For an explanation ofliI pap-hal-la (= muttalliku) which differs from the dictionary definitions (AHw 689b, CAD M2 306), cf. J. Prosecky in the Commentary 86 12 Yoshikawa proposes to analyse such forms as gar and gal above as hamtu-root + lei, representing an alternative maru category (cf. MSL 4 87). According to Yoshikawa (Or NS 43 18-21), the maru can be expressed either through reduplicating the hamtu-root (mu-R-R-0), or through hamtu-root + lei (mu-R-e), so that in this instance Iga-gal and Igal-el or Igar-el would all be alternative maru forms. No explanation is offered, however, to explain the difference between these forms. Particularly interesting variant verbal forms with gar appear In Gilgamesh and Agga 8 and 14 (cf. Romer AOAT 209/1 24-25): 8) nam-ba(-an)-ga-ga-an-de-en, (nam-)ba-an-gar-re-en-de-en, nam-ba-an-gar-re-en-ze-en, 14) nam-ba-ga-ga-an-de-en, ba -an-gar-re-en-{ en }-de-en, ga-am-ga~ga-an-de-en, ga -am-sig!-sig-ge-en-de-en! nam-ba-an-sig-ge-en-de-en [missingj ga -am -sig!-sig-ge-en -de-en nam-ba-an-sig-ge-en-de-en nam-ba-sig-ge-en-de-en The difficulties with gar (and sig) not only appear in the alternative forms ga-ga and gar + lei, but also in the use of cohortative ga-with maru-roots ga-ga-and sig-sig, which theoretically should not occur (cf. Jacobsen AS 16 73j~. There seems to be a syntactical relationship expressed here which does not conform to our standard grammar. One possible solution to the problem of the verbal forms in our UHF text is that consistency is not intended in the Sumerian text, but rather that a sequence of events is introduced by verbs in the \"punctive\" aspect, and then resumed by \"durative\" verbal forms (cf. Jacobsen AS 16 98b for a similar case). The punctive/hamtu forms would thus serve as a \"future-perfect\" form, i.e. \"as I approach ... when I (will have) enter(ed) ... after I (will have) place(d) my hand ... then I will know ... \" The use of gar + lei as a type of \"future-perfect\" was not understood by later scribes, since no such distinction in verbal aspect could be indicated in the Akkadian translation, and duplicates recorded the verbal form simply as mu-un-si-in-gar-ra (UET 6 391:7 and duplicates).

The Akkadian translation renders nam-ti silim-ma-mu as ana ba-la-ti-ia u Sh-la-mi-ia (CT 16 3:90), which assumes a Sumerian infinitive form silim- ma-mu-d&.

Sassukkatu). This tradition may be reflected in Sumerian literature, since GeStinanna offers herself as her brother Dumuzi's substitute in the Netherworld (cf. Falkenstein BiOr 22 281). For Sargonic traditions regarding GeStinanna, cf. Carrod Or NS 50 121-136. The -ka genetival ending of dgeStin-an-na-ka may imply an ergative form, \"recited by GeStinanna\". 49 The verbal form ht-e-p8 (hi + hamtu) may be either affirmative or precative, depending upon whether the verb is transitive or intransitive (so Edzard ZA 61 21 3-21 6). In UHF 49, the verb pad appears to be transitive, following the subject marked with e-agentive (gigtukul-ke4), suggesting an affirmative verbal form \"has indeed calledladjured you\". More usual examples in this corpus of zi. . . .ht-pa are intransitive, hence precative (Edzard ibid. 213), corresponding to Akkadian lz2 tamcita.

This tradition may be reflected in Sumerian literature, since Gestinanna offers herself as her brother Dumuzi's substitute in the Netherworld (cf. Falkenstein BiOr 22 281). For Sargonic traditions regarding Gestinanna, cf. Carroue Or NS 50 121-136. The -ka genetival ending of dgestin-an-na-ka may imply an ergative form, \"recited by Gestinanna\". The verbal form he-e-pa (he + hamtu) may be either affirmative or precative, depending upon whether the verb is transitive or intransitive (so Edzard ZA 61213-216). In UHF 49, the verb pad appears to be transitive, following the subject marked with e-agentive (gistukul-ke4), suggesting an affirmative verbal form \"has indeed calledladjured you\".

Note the use of Ibi-tal for Ibi-dal (Poe bel GSG §37 and §401.), although another possibility is suggested by the Akkadian translation ofhul-bi-ta as lemnu (CT 162:46-47), taking hul-bi-ta literally as \"from their bad ones\", i.e. \"the worst\".

The translations of \"guilt\" and \"misdeed\" for nam-tag-ga are based upon the Akkadian meaning of both arnu and sertu (CT 16 2:49-50). F~r the reading ara9, cf. the note to 1. 570 below. The lack of a plural ending is not significant, since it appears that in sequences of plural verbs, -es is not obligatory in every line. Cf. notes to UHF 629-630, and 651 below.

Edzard ZA 61 226,229 and ZA 66 47). The verbal form ga-ga could perhaps represent the hamtu plural form of another root, which may appear in PBS 1/2 122:23, za-se im-GAM-GAM I I ahiisu kuss[a]. The -ka of den-ki-ka is difficult to explain; the late duplicate reads den-ki-ke4 (CT 162:61 and dup1.). The late duplicate reads ba-an-si-es, \"they went straight for (the victim)\" (CT 16 2:63).

The Akkadian translation renders nam-ti silim-ma-mu as ana ba-Ia-,ti-ia u sa-la-mi-ia (CT 163:90), which assumes a Sumerian infinitive form silim-ma-mu-de.

For these forms, cf. Poebel § aso 364, Edzard ZA 62 14ff., and Farber-Flügge St Pohll0 71f. The difficulty is that although the distinction between forms without and with IEO/ is ascribed to a ham!u-maru distinction, two sets of examples cited above occur in the same line: te-ge26-da-mu-de ... us-gar-ra-mu-de (85), and dib-be-da-mu-da ... gen-na-mu-de (219). Since in both cases the form with IEO! occurs before the form without IEO!, the difference between forms may not represent maru-hamtu or present-preterite, but something more akin to Jacobsen's \"pre-actional aspect\" (AS 1698). Cf. below, note to UHF 339. The later duplicate (CT 16 4: 151) reads su us-gar-ra-mu-de, perhaps a conflation of roots su-us and su-gar.

In these examples, therefore, in which the marQ can be adequately expressed either with or without /ED/, the particle /ED/ does not itself indicate the marii, but is used in conjuncti<on with the marii base.

Late duplicates to our line read ki-gub-ba-mu (dupl. ki-gub-bu-d2) // aSar azzjzzu (CT 16 6:220) and ki al-DU-a // aiar i1lakz.i (CT 16 6:224), illustrating the ambiguity of the Sumerian phrase.

UHF 116 is unduplicated in the late sources. The incantation is lacking in CT 16. The text reads KAXBAD for tug which is interesting in view of the fact that KAxBAD (ull and KAxLI (tug) occasionally appear to be interchangeable (cf. Wilcke AfO 24 10:7-9; 15; 29; 32). This rubric, which occurs several times in UHF (168, 208, 233), also appears in BiOr 30 169. The reading /dib/ can be assumed from bilinguals which translate with bri'u (cf. CAD B 178f.).

This incipit appears in two short duplicating incantations inscribed on single column tablets: pisma-nu dim an-na glima-nu 'dim-ni?' an-na [rubric: ka-inim-ma glsma-nu-kam] (VAS 17 18:1) and ma-nu di-ma-na ma-nu-[x] (phonetic Sumerian, VAS 10 192:1), and in an incantation catalogue (Wilcke AfO 24 14:6). These incantations do not duplicate our text. The line is not completed, because of the formulaic character of the dialogue (cf. Falkenstein LSS NF1 54). The verbal pattern in these lines is u-me-ni-si. . .u-me-ni-p8. . .hC-gen, that is verbs with preformative u- (futurum exactum) followed by a verb with hC + hamtu. The pattern is discussed below in the note to UHF 673. The reading ge6-sa(-sa) is preferred to the alternative possibility ge6-di-di (literally \"night walking\") because of variants ge6-zal/sa9 = iumizi (cf. AHw 1274), and one lexical entry zal = ma56 (CAD M1401a). One might argue, however, for ge6-di(-di) after CT 1627:22-23 ge6-a DU-DU // mut-tal- lik mu-Si, since di-di can correspond to aliiku (Izi C iv 28), as a variant to Du-Du (cf. CAD A1 302a top, and CAD M2 292a). Note that in this first \"Legitimationstyp\" sequence in which his name is mentioned, Asalluhi appears between Enki and his spouse Darngalnunna. Cf. UHF 199-201, in which the usual sequential order is Enki, Damgalnunna, and Asalluhi. It is possible that in the Old Babylonian period, these formulaic sequences were not as fixed as in later bilingual texts. The verbal form is treated as an orthographic variant a-ur-dabs for a-ur- dabs, corresponding to Akkadian puzra ahiizu (cf. JCS 20 1193), as it appears in Angim 127: da-nun-na-ke4-e-ne pel-gin7 a-ur-bi im-da[bs-be-de] (Cooper AnOr 52 76). The incantation is lacking in CT 16. Cf.

This raises the question about the distinction between /ED/ and /e/ in parallel verbal forms (cf. note to UHF 108 above), since the syntax of all of the sentences (UHF 170-173) appears identical. Note, however, that only 1. 170 is nominalised (nam-tag-tag-dBa, but not in 182), which may indicate Commentary 94 in the UHF line.

In these examples, therefore, in which the maru can be adequately expressed either with or without IEDI, the particle lED I does not itself indicate the maru, but is used in conjunctipn with the maru base.

The pattern is discussed below in the note to UHF 673. 158 The reading ge6-sa(-sa) is preferred to the alternative possibility ge6-di-di (literally \"night walking\") because of variants ge6-zal/sa9 = sumsu (cf. AHw 1274), and one lexical entry zal = masu (CAD M! 401a). One might argue, however, for ge6-di(-di) after CT 1627:22-23 ge6-a DU-DU I I mut-tal-Uk mu-si, since di-di can correspond to aliiku (Izi C iv 28), as a variant to DU-DU (cf. CAD A! 302a top, and CAD M2292a). 160 Note that in this first \"Legitimationstyp\" sequence in which his name is mentioned, Asalluhi appears between Enki and his spouse Damgalnunna. Cf. UHF 199-201, in which the usual sequential order is Enki, Damgalnunna, and Asalluhi. It is possible that in the Old Babylonian period, these formulaic sequences were not as fixed as in later bilingual texts. 167 The verbal form is treated as an orthographic variant a-ur-dab5 for a-ur-dabs, corresponding to Akkadian puzra ahiizu (cf. JCS 20 1193), as it appears in Angim 127: da-nun-na-ke4-e-ne pes-gin7 a-ur-bi im-da[bs-be-de] (Cooper AnOr 52 76). 169 The incantation is lacking in CT 16. 170 Cf. UHF 182, the repetition of the incipit, which confirms the -de suffix on the verbal base. The parallel verbal forms in the sequence all have pre-radical Inl with suffix lei: in-su-su-e (171,183) in-AK-e (172,184) in-kar-kar-re (173,185) followed by ham!u forms ba-gi4 (174), nu-gi4 (175), etc. The sequence appears to be maru base + IEDI + lei (i.e. Ina-m-tag-tag-ed-e-a/), followed by three verbs with 3rd person singular maru base + lei (without lED/). This raises the question about the distinction between IEDI and lei in parallel verbal forms (cf. note to UHF 1 08 above), since the syntax of all of the sentences (UHF 170-173) appears identical. Note, however, that only 1. 170 is nominalised (nam-tag-tag-de-a, but not in 182), which may indicate Commentary 94 in the UHF line. A Mt par~i, however, is known from an inseription of Tukulti-Ninurta I (King Tn. I 7 39). 108ff. The verbal patterns are interesting: nam-mu-da-te-ge26-de-en (108) nam-mu-da-hul-de-en (109) nam-mu-da-us-e-en (110) ba-ra-gub-bu-de-en (111) ba-ra-duru-de-en (112) ba-ra-ku4-ku4-de-en (113) ba-ra-an-ta-bal-de-en (114) nam-mu-da-us-e-en (115) The verbal forms with lusl (110,115) indieate unambiguously that all forms are 2nd person man} singular with either lei or IEDI following the verbal base. In these examples, therefore, in which the maru can be adequately expressed either with or without IED/, the particle IEDI does not itself indicate the maru, but is used in conjunctipn with the maru base. 111 For ki-DU, cf. Lugale 91, ki-Du-ba I ki-DU-bi (= asar illaka). Late duplicates to our line read ki-gub-ba-mu (dup!. ki-gub-bu-de) II asar azzizzu (CT 16 6:220) and ki al-DU-a II asar illakü (CT 16 6:224), ~ iIlustrating the ambiguity of the Sumerian phrase. 116-117 The textual problems are not solved by the eorresponding la te text (CT 16 6:224-226): ki al-Du-a ba-ra-al-Du-a ki kU4-ku4-r da?-mu?-sC?l ba-ra-an-ku4-ku4-de The duplieate suggests that ki could be restored in the erasure in I. 117. UHF 116 is unduplicated in the late sources. 120 The incantation is lacking in CT 16. 127 The text reads KAxBAD for tU6 which is interesting in view of the fact that KAxBAD (us!!) and KAxLI (tu6) occasionally appear to be interchangeable (cf. Wilcke AfO 24 10:7-9; 15; 29; 32). 128 This rubric, whieh oeeurs several times in UHF (168, 208, 233), also 130 appears in BiOr 30 169. The reading Idibl ean be assumed from bilinguals wh ich translate with b(j'u (cf. CAD B 178f.). The ineantation is laeking in CT 16. This ineipit appears in two short duplieating ineantations inseribed on single eolumn tablets: gisma-nu dirn an-na gisma-nu rdim-ni?l an-na [rubrie: ka-inim-ma gisma-nu-kam] (VAS 17 18:1) and ma-nu di-ma-na ma-nu-[x] (phonetic Sumerian, VAS 10 192: 1), and in an ineantation catalogue (Wilcke AfO 24 14:6). These incantations do not duplieate our text. 95 Forerunners to Udug-hul 132 Cf. Inninsagurra 49: u4 zalag kukku an-bir9 mul-sigrse mu-un-du-x \"(Inanna) darkens the bright daylight, turns the midday light into darkness\" (Sjöberg ZA 65 182). 140 Cf. the ineipit in CT 17 14 (K 8386): 1: en sag-gig mul-an-gin7 an-edin-na gurud-da nu-ub-zu. The ineantaiion is laeking in CT 16. 148-152 Restored after UHF 164-167 below. 153 The line is not eompleted, beeause of the formulaie eharaeter of the dialogue (cf. Falkenstein LSS NFI 54). 156-158 The verbal pattern in these lines is u-me-ni-si ... u-me-ni-pa ... he-gen, that is verbs with preformative u-(futurum exaetum) followed by a verb with he + hamtu. The pattern is diseussed below in the note to UHF 673. 158 The reading ge6-sa(-sa) is preferred to the alternative possibility ge6-di-di (literally \"night walking\") beeause of variants ge6-zal/sa9 = sumsu (cf. AHw 1274), and one lexical entry zal = masu (CAD M! 401a). One might argue, however, for ge6-di(-di) after CT 1627:22-23 ge6-a DU-DU I I mut-tal-lik mu-si, sinee di-di ean eorrespond to aläku (Izi C iv 28), as a variant to DU-DU (cf. CAD A! 302a top, and CAD M2292a). 160 Note that in this first \"Legitimationstyp\" sequenee in whieh his name is mentioned, Asalluhi appears between Enki and his spouse Damgalnunna. Cf. UHF 199-201, in whieh the usual sequential order is Enki, Damgalnunna, and Asalluhi. It is possible that in the Old Babylonian period, these formulaie sequenees were not as fixed as in later bilingual texts. 167 The verbal form is treated as an orthographie variant a-ur-dab5 for a-ur-dabs, eorresponding to Akkadian puzra ahäzu (cf. JCS 20 1193), as it appears in Angim 127: da-nun-na-ke4-e-ne pes-gin7 a-ur-bi im-da[bs-be-de] (Co oper AnOr 52 76). 169 The ineantation is laeking in CT 16. 170 Cf. UHF 182, the repetition of the ineipit, whieh confirms the -de suffix on the verbal base. The parallel verbal forms in the sequenee all have pre-radieal Inl with suffix lei: in-su-su-e (171,183) in-AK-e (172,184) in-kar-kar-re (173,185) followed by ham!u forms ba-gi4 (174), nu-gi4 (175), ete. The sequenee appears to be maru base + IEDI + lei (i.e. Ina-m-tag-tag-ed-e-a/), followed by three verbs with 3rd person singular maru base + lei (without IEDj). This raises the question about the distinetion between IEDI and lei in parallel verbal forms (cf. note to UHF 108 above), sinee the syntax of all of the sentences (UHF 170-173) appears identieal. Note, however, that only 1. 170 is nominalised (nam-tag-tag-de-a, but not in 182), whieh may indieate"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"subordination in relation to the succeeding sentences, i.e. \"when the evil Udug is about to make contact. . .\" This notion may also be suggested by the use of the so-called \"presumptive volitive\" na- prefix (Jacobsen AS 16 734). Cf. UHF 186, the repetition of this line, which differs slightly. The sudden switch to hamfu (punctive) in UHF 174f. begins the actual narrative of what occurred when the demons attacked. The lu-ge6-sa(-sa) is treated here as a type of demon, not as the lu-ge6-bar (= muSamSz2) who appears as the victim in CT 16 25 i 42: udug hul a-la hul lu-ge6-bar-a-gd sila-a gib-ba // utukku lemnu a16 lemnu fa ana mufamSi ina sdqaparku, \"the Udug and Ala demons who obstruct the street for the man walking at night\". For a description of the new moon, cf. 4 R 9:22-23 gi-rin ni-ba mu-un-dim- ma // inbu Sa ina ramaniiu ibbanii, \"(Sin) is the fruit which is formed by itself' [W.G. Lambert]. A similar expression occurs in Lugale 166, describing the scene of battle between Ninurta and the Asag demon: dutu la-ba-gub dzuen ba-an-tud, \"Utu did not wait, (but) Sin was born\" i.e. the battle was waged by moonlight. For an alternative interpretation, cf. van Dijk Sumer 18 27. Gibil's role as one who lights the way in the Netherworld appears in %rpu IX 107-1 18, and Surpu Appendix rev. 6-29. It is clear from this passage, as well as from the repetition in 1. 191, that Marduk (damar-utu) and Asalluhi are not identified as one and the same deity. Marduk is not mentioned in connection with the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue, which is quoted in this same context, nor can the statement that \"Marduk cannot release him\" appropriately refer to the effective magic of Asalluhi. The juxtaposition of Marduk and Asalluhi is entirely coincidental, caused by the introduction of the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue. The expression igi-si in this context is always translated as ippalissu (cf. Surpu V/VI 17-18 et passim), although a common synonym igi-bar (= palasu) frequently occurs (cf. CT 16 18:7-9; 33: 179- 180). The reading igi-si rather than igi-sum (as Falkenstein LSS NFl 54) is supported by the incantation in phonetic Sumerian which reads a-sa-a[l-lu-hi] i-gi im-ma-an- si (Wilcke AfO 24 11: 13), and by a gloss in an Old Babylonian incantation: igi im-ma-an-sizi (van Dijk Or NS 44 63 = VAS 17 33: 14). Cf. also the Old Assyrian idiom e-nu-tum nu-ad-a \"notice is taken\" (Kienast ATHE 62:36). This line, which repeats 1. 170, adds Iu before the verb. Similarly, 1. 184 differs slightly from the earlier version in 1. 172 above, and 1. 186 differs from 1. 174. The text has d < BIL > .GI. Cf. 1. 153 above, which is similarly abbreviated. The incantation is lacking in CT 16. Forerunners to Udug-hul 210 16 is written over an erased sanga sign. Cf. CT 16 28:46: lu(var. omits) singa-mah me ku-ga. 214 The line is possibly corrupt, intending either to read 1u dnanie or 1u ninuaki, or perhaps a conflation of lu dnanSe ninualu (cf. Frankena AbB 2 29:19). 220 Although the first sign, [udulg, seems too far from the beginning of the line, nevertheless udug is the expected first word in the well known sequence of demons. The spacing may have been caused by an erasure or corruption in the text, noticeable in the following lines (UHF 222-224). 223 The break should contain ki-sikil before ud-da-kar-ra, but there is insufficient room to allow for the restoration. It is surprising that such an oft-repeated formulaic passage should be badly corrupted. The number of erasures and peculiar writings indicate that the scribe had difficulty with the lengthy sentence extending between 11. 220-225, but his difficulties subsequently increased 11. 234-244, in which an entire incantation was erased. One wonders whether this tablet was intended as a draft or finished product. 224 For the restoration, cf. Sollberger, Iraq 24 pl. 26, No. B 2:3.

AHw 1219a), which appears to be the last sign in UHF 224. It is tempting, of course, to render the second clause in Greek as la tzib Siri (cf. AHw 1393), but the Greek clearly indicates a reading of tab, not tdb, and the dabs-sign in UHF 224 cannot correspond to Siru \"flesh\" (AHw 124%). 232 t.n &nu-ru is written over an erasure. 246-295 This incantation is duplicated in CT 16 9-1 1. 247 For ki-in-du, cf. van Dijk, HSAO I 252; 254, and UHF 367 below, which reads ki-in-da. 248-249 The meaning of this clause follows closely upon the previous statement that demons are born like human children, and hence are nursed in the same way as humans. Later corresponding duplicates provide a slightly different interpretation, that the demons are progeny of the Netherworld who are suckled by the \"nursemaid of evil\" (cf. CT 16 9:1-6, UET 6 392:8-10, LKA 82:8-10). Our Old Babylonian tradition is closer to the idea expressed in Lugale 28, which refers to the Asag demon as dumu um-me (var.

The lu-ge6-sa( -sa) is treated here as a type of demon, not as the lu-ge6-bar (= musamsu) who appears as the victim in CT 1625 i 42: udug hul a-la hul lu-ge6-bar-a-se sila-a gib-ba / / utukku lemnu alU lemnu sa ana musamsi ina süqa parku, \"the Udug and Ala demons who obstruct the street for the man walking at night\". For a description ofthe new moon, cf. 4 R 9:22-23 gi-rin ni-ba mu-un-dim-ma / / inbu sa ina ramänisu ibbanu, \"(Sin) is the fruit which is formed by itself' [W.G. Lambert]. A similar expression occurs in Lugale 166, describing the scene of battle between Ninurta and the Asag demon: dutu la-ba-gub dzuen ba-an-tud, \"Utu did not wait, (but) Sin was born\" i.e. the battle was waged by moonlight. For an alternative interpretation, cf. van Dilk Sumer 1827. _ Gibil's role as one who lights the way in the Netherworld appears in Surpu IX 107-118, and Surpu Appendix rev. 6-29. It is c1ear from this passage, as weIl as from the repetition in 1. 191, that Marduk (damar-utu) and Asalluhi are not identified as one and the same deity. Marduk is not mentioned in connection with the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue, which is quoted in this same context, nor can the statement that \"Marduk cannot release hirn\" appropriately refer to the effective magie of Asalluhi. The juxtaposition of Marduk and Asalluhi is entirely coincidental, caused by the introduction of the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue. The expression igi-si in this context is always translated as ippalissu (cf. Surpu V/VI 17-18 et passim), although a common synonym igi-bar (= paläsu) frequently occurs (cf. CT 16 18:7-9; 33: 179-180). The reading igi-si rather than igi-sum (as Falkenstein LSS NFI 54) is supported by the incantation in phonetic Sumerian which reads a-sa-a[l-Iu-hi] i-gi im-ma-an-si (Wilcke AfO 24 11: 13), and by a gloss in an Old Babylonian incantation: igi im-ma-an-sizi (van Dijk Or NS 44 63 = V AS 17 33: 14). Cf. also the Old Assyrian idiom e-na-tum na-ad-a \"notice is taken\" (Kienast ATHE 62:36). This line, which repeats 1. 170, adds lu before the verb. Similarly, 1. 184 differs slightly from the earlier version in 1. 172 above, and 1. 186 differs from I. 174. The text has d < BIL > .GI. Cf. 1. 153 above, which is similarly abbreviated. The incantation is lacking in CT 16. 97 Forerunners to Udug-hul 210 lu is written over an erased sanga sign. Cf. CT 16 28:46: lu(var. omits) sanga-mah me ku-ga. 214 The line Is possibly corrupt, intending either to read lu dnanse or lu ninuaki, or perhaps a conflation oflu dnanse ninuaki (cf. Frankena AbB 2 29:19). 220 Although the first sign, [udu]g, seems too far from the beginning ofthe line, nevertheless udug is the expected first word in the weIl known sequence of demons. The spacing may have been caused by an erasure or corruption in the text, noticeable in the following lines (UHF 222-224). 223 The break should contain ki-sikil before ud-da-kar-ra, but there is insufficient room to allow for the restoration. It is surprising that such an oft-repeated formulaic passage should be hadly corrupted. The number of erasures and peculiar writings indicate that the scribe had difficulty with the lengthy sentence extending between H. 220-225, but his difficulties subsequently increased 11. 234-244, in which an entire incantation was erased. One wonders whether this tablet was intended as a draft or finished product. 224 For the restoration, cf. Sollberger, lraq 24 pI. 26, No. B 2:3. This late tablet (BM 34816) with a Greek transliteration on the reverse duplicates UHF 222-224. Collation of the tablet reveals the correct reading of lines 3-4 as rd1nam-tar hul-gal a-< sag> gig tu-ur nu-[dulO-ga ... ] / / rdlnarn-r tar 1 lern-nu a-sak-ku marGIG la [ta-bu seru], which is confirmed by the Greek transliteration of the line, which reads: [vafLß]ap A€fLV aaax fLovpa [Aa] :'!-ß aELp The Greek text alone preserves the word seru \"angry\", corresponding in late texts to dab5 (cf. AHw 1219a), which appears to be the last sign in UHF 224. It is tempting, of course, to render the second clause in Greek as lä .tüb üri (cf. AHw 1393), but the Greek clearly indicates a reading of .täb, not lüb, and the dab5-sign in UHF 224 cannot correspond to s/ru \"flesh\" (AHw 1248b). 232 en e-nu-ru is written over an erasure. 246-295 This incantation is duplicated in CT 169-11. 247 For ki-in-du, cf. van Dijk, HSAO I 252; 254, and UHF 367 below, which reads ki-in-da. 248-249 The meaning ofthis clause follows closely upon the previous statement that demons are born like human children, and hence are nursed in the same way as humans. Later corresponding duplicates provide a slightly different interpretation, that the demons are progeny of the Netherworld who are suckled by the \"nursemaid ofevil\" (cf. CT 169:1-6, UET 6 392:8-10, LKA 82:8-10). Our Old Babylonian tradition is closer to the idea expressed in Lugale 28, which refers to the Asag demon as dumu um-me (var. [um-me]-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Commentary ga, um-me-ga-18) nu tug-a nc? ga gu7-a \"the son who, although not sitting on the (lap of the) nursemaid, imbibed the nourishment of the milk\". The Lugale example is of interest, moreover, for the orthography of our line, since the variants um-me-ga, um-me-ga-la and um-me are the same 254 variants which occur in duplicates to UHF 249. This notion may also be alluded to in zi-pa incantations: um-me-ga-la urn-me-ga-la ga 181-e um-me- ga-la ga sis-a // muSCniqtu MIN Sa tuliiSa ~Zbu MIN Sa tulfiia marru \"O Nurse, Nurse, whose milk (Akkadian: breast) is sweet, Nurse, whose milk (Akkadian: breast) is bitter\" (Borger, AOAT 1 5:35-37). Cf. also the photograph of the Old Babylonian incantation (not edited) in Genava 16 110 11. 6-7, which reads [ulm-me-ga-la ga nu-si-sBme8 um-me-da bulug si- sh nu-reg \"the nursemaid's breasts are not bitter, the nurse does not lead her charge correctly\" [courtesy I.L. Finkel]. The first few lines of this incantation are also duplicated on an amulet which, if not itself Old Babylonian, might be based upon an Old Babylonian original. The first few lines of the amulet (Lambert Iraq 38 60) read: en e-nu-ru a-an-ne ri-a / dumu ki-in-du tu-da .urn-me-da SeS-e ad-a 'um-me SeS-e ga zi gu7-a The amulet text follows the late tradition in describing the nursemaid as SeS \"evil\" (late lemutti in CT 16 9:6). Moreover, Lambert suggests a-6 as a phonetic writing of 8-6 \"to rear\" (Iraq 38 61), which cannot be confirmed by UHF 248, which reads ga '6'-da-a-rneS. The amulet, in fact, may be interpreted as \"liquid is drawn out at the (tit of the) bitter nursemaid, true milk is ingested at the (tit of the) bitter nurse.\" The amulet's reading ga zi gu7-a might serve as an alternative restoration for UHF 249, as um-me-ga rsi-na gal z[i g]u7-a-meS, although the sign KAxX, in 1. 249, if correctly drawn on the copy, is not perfect for either sub or gu7. Finally, the nursemaid's \"si\" in these lines may refer to a more concrete image than \"fullness\"; since si denotes a projection like \"finger\" or \"horn\", it may refer here to the \"nipple\", i.e. \"they were drawing out milk from her Forerunners to Udug-hul bits\". The emendation to /zi-ir-zi-ir/ is further suggested by the reduplicated verbal form /dig-dig/ in the following line (UHF 254), in a parallel context. The late duplicate UET 6 391:10 contains a gloss, mu-un-digdi-di-gedig-e- dit, indicating /didig/ as the mar8 form. Although kalam has a locative postposition, it is construed as the logical object of /ur4/, as in UHF 2. Alternatively, one might translate as \"they caused panic/paralysis in the land\". The meaning of kiSib-gal as \"seal-bearer\" referring to demons would correspond to similar \"official\" titles of the MaSkim and Galla demons; cf. above, notes to UHF 12 and 16. Since neither bur-zi-gal nor the Akkadian loanword burzigallu are elsewhere attested with s [CAD B 345b3, the readings of this word and [dugbulr-si (= pursitu) in the following line are conjectural. The verbal form appears to be phonetic [bu-re] for /bur-el. Presumably gi(-b) for /gib/ (= pardku). Cf. UHF 18. The corresponding duplicates (cf.

The emendation to Izi-ir-zi-irl is further suggested by the reduplicated verbal form Idig-digl in the following line (UHF 254), in a parallel context. 254 The late duplicate UET 6391:10 contains a gloss, mu-un-digdi-di-gedig-e-de, indicating Ididigl as the maru form. 255 Although kalam has a locative postposition, it is construed as the logical object of lur4/, as in UHF 2. Alternatively, one might translate as \"they caused panic/paralysis in the land\". 258 The meaning of kisib-gal as \"seal-bearer\" referring to demons would correspond to similar \"official\" titles ofthe Maskim and Galla demons; cf. above, notes to UHF 12 and 16. 263 Since neither bur-zi-gal nor the Akkadian loanword burzigallu are elsewhere attested with s [CAD B 345b], the readings of this word and [dugbu]r-si ( = pursltu) in the following line are conjectural. The verbal form appears to be phonetic [bu-re] for Ibur-ej. 270 Presumably gi(-b) for Igibl (= paräku). 271 Cf. UHF 18. 272-277 The corresponding duplicates (cf. CT 169:20-34 and duplicates) preserve the foUowing lines which do not conform to the traces on Ms. A viii 1-15: 277 (20) [nig-ur-limmu-ba dsakkan a]n-r na-ke41 gu mi-in-ru-us (22) ugu-b[i? du]g gestin-na gaz-za-gin7 hur-sag-ga bi-in-sur-re-es (24) [m]a-da ma-da-bi mu-un-su8-sus-ge-es (26) ki-sikil ama-a-ni-ta ba-ra-e\\\\-de (28) gurus e usbar6-a-ni-ta ba-ra-e-de (30) dumu e ad-da-a-ni-ta ba-ra-e-de (32) turnusen ab-Ia-bi-ta ba-ra-an-dab-dab-be-de (34) burus a-bur-bi-ta ba-ra-e\\\\-de (= UHF 277) (20) They subjugated [the quadrupeds of Sakkan]-of-heaven, (22) they broke their skulls on the mountain like a smashed wine jug, (24) they went about in every country.

There is some difficulty in the interpretation of a-bur which is translated as i~~üru ina abrlsu uselll1 (CT 169 i 35). The attested abru \"wing\" (cf. AHw 7) is rejected by CAD Al 64 in favour of a-bUr 11 abru \"hiding place\", based upon this Udug-hul context and a similar passage in the \"Curse over Agade\" (cf.

Although the interpretation in CAD A1 64 has been provisionally adopted in UHF 277, the meaning of \"wing\" for a-bur // abru may in fact fit this context, literally \"they cause the birds to rise with their wings\".

Thus, since NingeStinna, the scribe of the Netherworld, is unavailable to record the patient's entry into the Netherworld, he is (temporarily) spared. The use of ki for \"Netherworld\" is supported by the late duplicate reading (phonetically) e-sir kur-rake4 // suli erseti (CT 16 9 ii 8). Because the corresponding lines in the late duplicates are ali broken at this point, the UHF text is restored from the closing lines of the following incantation in UH IV (= CT 16 10 iv 12-18). This procedure is justified by the repetitive nature of these successive incantations, and enough remains of the UHF text to regard the restoration as virtually certain. The rubric is extremely important, since individual incantations on Ms. A have not been designated as \"Udug-hul\", and hence this rubric is the only indication in a Forerunner text that these were incantations of the same type grouped together. This does not imply, however, that the incantations were thereby considered to constitute a \"series\", particularly since not all are even duplicated in the later library editions of the UH Series, Tablets 111 and IV. This lines could be a catchline, ending in . . .I-Sub/ru. The incipit and opening lines of this incantation closely resemble the opening passage of Inanna's Descent to the Netherworld, which repeats the phrase \". . . an-gal-ta ki-gal-5e geStu-ga-ni na-an-gub\". The UHF incipit, Forerunners to Udug-hul restored after late duplicates, differs only slightly, reading an-gal-ta ki- dagal-Se, although ki-dagal may well be a late corruption of ki-gal, since the two expressions are not synonymous: ki-gal refers to the Netherworld, while ki-dagal refers to the earth's surface, and our incantation is concerned primarily with the Netherworld and ghosts. The similarity between the incipits of the Udug-hul incantation and Inanna's Descent is noteworthy, particularly since the composition \"Inanna's Descent\" was known by its ancient title as \"an-gal-ta ki-gal-$& (UET 6 10 colophon, and Kramer PAPS 124 310). Moreover, similarities between the UHF incantation and the Sumerian version of Inanna's Descent may not be entirely coincidental. Both compositions deal with similar motifs, in particular the passage into the Netherworld and the re-emergence as a ghost, with Inanna serving as an epic ghost whose very presence threatens her former associates, and especially her husband Dumuzi. One might equally wish to extrapolate from Inanna's Descent by suggesting that, in Udug-hul IV, pernicious ghosts who haunted former companions or even casual acquaintances were seeking substitutes for themselves in the Netherworld. These thematic similarities between the two compositions may explain the literary parallels, which are noted in the commentary (cf. notes to UHF 300, 305, 352, 371-373, 475 and 800). Note also the similarities in the opening four lines of Nanna-Suen's Journey to Nippur (Ferrara St PohI SM 2 44).

In this incantation it is Enki who \"turns his attention from the great heaven to the broad Netherworld\", presumably to focus on the release of Inanna. The incantation, in fact, says that Enki turned his attention to the \"hierodule\", namely Inanna herself (cf. note to UHF 305), which fits well with the mythological background. The main intention, however, of the incantation is to list the various types of ghosts who might oppress the victim (UHF 3 11-327), which completes the picture: Enki, who engineered the release of Inanna from the Netherworld, bears some responsibility for the danger which she subsequently posed as a ghost, although the terms of her release - that she find a substitute for herself in the Netherworld - were actually set by the Anunna (ID 289). The incantation therefore calls upon Enki, as the architect of Inanna's release, for protection against other ghosts who may emerge from the Netherworld, with a purpose similar to Inanna's. Cf.

Interesting new evidence for nu-gig /! qadistu \"hierodule\""},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"occurs in Ebla bilinguals, which read nig-gig = qa-di-Sum (Pettinato MEE 4 207:lOO) suggesting a close philological link between nig-gig (= ikkibu \"sacred, taboo\") and nu-gig, cf. Krebernik ZA 73 4. 307 The god name dnin-ug appears in CT 24 31:76 = An-Anum III 129. Although the reading dnin-pirig is also possible, the name dnin-ug may serve as a pun on ugs \"to die\", which is contextually suitable here [W.G. Lambert]. 310 For the reading of KI.E.NE.DI, cf. below, note to UHF 775-776. One hesitates, however, to find a \"place of play\" or merriment (cf. CAD M2 15 mt?lultu) in the Netherworld. One might alternatively read ki e-ne di-dug4 \"the place where he pronounced judgement\", but the combination of signs most suggests ki eSemen-ka. The meaning, however, of ki eSemen in our context may be explained through a reference in an ergernma to Enlil, ki eSemen lil-la-am e-si \"it is the ghost (who) filled (his) 'playground\"' (4R 28* 4:67, cited CAD Z 59a, and cf. CT 15 12 bottom), where eSemen refers to the god's sphere of activity. Similarly, the metaphorical reference in Lugale 137 ki eSemen dinanna-ka/ke4 a-zu ba-ra-ni-zi \"do not raise your armlmight on the 'playground' of Inanna\", i.e. the battlefield, refers to Inanna's traditional bellicosity. Hence, the phrase in UHF 3 10 dag ki-gal- la &i eSemen-ka describes the Netherworld shrine as the centre of (cultic) activities of Netherworld deities, such as EreSkigal and the others mentioned in the context. The intention of the passage UHF 306-310 is to contrast Netherworld and earthly cultic practice, since presumably the rituals governing the washing and mouth-rinsing of statues would not apply in the Netherworld. Thus, an offering made in the Netherworld temple, perhaps a metaphor for the victim's death, would not be accompanied by the usual purification rituals. Hence the use of the -e postposition (dnin-hursag-ak-e, dnin-azu-ak-e) meaning \"at\" Nin-hursag or \"at\" EreSkigal (versus -ra \"to, for\") supports the idea of an offering made at the goddess' statue, suggesting a Netherworld cultic scene. 312 The usual orthography in bilinguals is lil-la-en-na (cf. CAD L 190 s.v. lilzi), although in this context the lil(-la) appears to be a class of ghost, parallel with those who die a violent death, lack a permanent tomb, or are neglected. It may be noteworthy that the mythical figure of Martu, who is not buried when he dies, is referred to as the 16-lil-la hur-sag-ga tuS-a, \"'demon' dwelling in the mountain\", since he knows neither house nor city (cf.

The late duplicate to our text reads [ki- siklil nu-un-zu-dm ht-me-en \"whether you are the maiden not yet known (sexually) (CT 16 50:19). The term Su-du7, however, may mean \"suitable\" (= Akkadian asHmu / SUsumu) as well as \"perfect\" (= Suklulu), probably implying \"ripeness\" and the reaching of puberty. Late texts translate guru: a nu-18 differently. The late duplicate to our line translates the term as eplu mu$-te-en-nu-u \"a lad not yet changed (by puberty)\" (CT 16 10 iv 46 and 50:21, cited CAD M2288b), while another text translates the same phrase as e!lu la ~u-um-[mu-du] \"a lad not yet yoked\" (Falkenstein LSS NFl 382). The latter term summudu refers to the seeder plow in lexical texts (CAD § 247a), suggesting that the lad's sexual organ is not yet developed. Cf. Edzard ZA 62 25-29, for the forms of ~A~-ada hamru participles. One might also translate Sub as \"fell\" or \"collapsed\". The scribe has written GUL for dul. Cf.

The meaning of gaz in UHF 318 may have another sense rather than \"killed\", but closer to the usage in Edzard SR 32a B + C 11'-12': kak-bi KA.KA e-gaz \"der betreffende Nagel . . . gestossen\". Cf.

Cf. also ur = nZu (A VII/2 95 [MSL 14 4631, Rh XIV 63 [MSL 812 111). The late duplicate (unpub.) reads ur-girls here. If the infix -ra is correctly restored, it reflects the \"neuter elative\", described by Jacobsen in AS 16 92-93. Cf. Zimmern ZA 3 1 1 1625 lag nam-ba-e-Sub-e // kurbanna la tanassuk \"do not throw a clod\". Cf. Ms. ID (Appendix): 11 l'f., for the restoration of this and subsequent lines describing possible points of contact between the patient and persons who later died and could haunt the victim. The meaning of the ga-profix in this context is not cohortative, but rather has the same meaning ascribed by Jacobsen to hit-, namely \"potentialis\", or Commentary 102 307 310 312 313 occurs in Ebla bilinguals, which read nig-gig = qa-di-sum (Pettinato MEE 4 207: 100) suggesting a close philological link between nig-gig (= ikkibu \"sacred, taboo\") and nu-gig, cf. Krebernik ZA 73 4. The god name dnin-ug appears in CT 24 31:76 = An-Anum III 129. Although the reading dnin-pirig is also possible, the name dnin-ug may serve as a pun on ug5 \"to die\", which is contextually suitable here [W.G. Lambert]. For the reading of KLE.NE.DI, cf. below, note to UHF 775-776. One hesitates, however, to find a \"place of play\" or merriment (cf. CAD M215 melultu) in the Netherworld. One might alternatively read ki e-ne di-dug4 \"the place where he pronounced judgement\", but the combination of signs most suggests ki esemen-ka. The meaning, however, of ki esemen in our context may be explained through a reference in an ersemma to Enlil, ki esemen lil-hi-am e-si \"it is the ghost (who) filled (his) 'playground'\" (4R 28* 4:67, cited CAD Z 59a, and cf. CT 15 12 bottom), where esemen refers to the god's sphere of activity. Similarly, the metaphorical reference in Lugale l37 ki esemen dinanna-ka/ke4 it-zu ba-ra-ni-zi \"do not raise your arm/might on the 'playground' of Inanna\", i.e. the battlefield, refers to Inanna's traditional bellicosity. Hence, the phrase in UHF 310 dag ki-gal-la ki esemen-ka describes the Netherworld shrine as the centre of (cultic) activities of Netherworld deities, such as Ereskigal and the others mentioned in the context. The intention of the passage UHF 306-310 is to contrast Netherworld and earthly cultic practice, since presumably the rituals governing the washing and mouth-rinsing of statues would not apply in the Netherworld. Thus, an offering made in the Netherworld temple, perhaps a metaphor for the victim's death, would not be accompanied by the usual purification rituals. Hence the use of the -e postposition (dnin-hursag-ak-e, dnin-azu-ak-e) meaning \"at\" Nin-hursag or \"at\" Ereskigal (versus -ra \"to, for\") supports the idea of an offering made at the goddess' statue, suggesting a Netherworld cultic scene. The usual orthography in bilinguals is lil-lit-en-na (cf. CAD L 190 s.v.lilu), although in this context the HI(-lit) appears to be a class of ghost, parallel with those who die a violent death, lack a permanent tomb, or are neglected. It may be noteworthy that the mythical figure of Martu, who is not buried when he dies, is referred to as the hI-IiI-lit hur-sag-git tus-a, \"'demon' dwelling in the mountain\", since he knows neither house nor city (cf.

Alternatively, the verbal form may be treated literally as a description of the ghost, \"whether you are a 'let me eat with him' (ghost)\", or \"whether you are one (who thought) 'let me eat with him7\", as if the ghost were a beggar asking to be fed, anointed, and clothed. As for u4-Su-US-e (probably to be analysed as /uSu-Se/, the translation \"daily\" is based upon the Akkadian translation Cma (cf. AHw 141 lb), although the meaning may in fact be \"towards sunset\" (cf. u4-Su = ereb s'ams'i[m] = OBGT I 818), since the activities of eating, drinking, anointing and dressing may have all occurred at sunset [Jacobsen]. 33 1 Cf.

Cf. also kalmatu laptu (CAD K 86-87). 333 The form of ga-ba-da-an-mu4-d& looks suspect, since theoretically the profix ga- should be incompatible with /ED/ (cf. Sacobsen AS 16 73a), although Edzard (ZA 61 225) cites the problematical form ga-ba-ni-ib-gur- ru-de. Since all of the forms in Ms. H for UHF 328-333 are restored, it may be that all the verbal forms in this sequence originally had ga- with /ED/, and that this form represents ga - potentialis. Cf. however, the variant in Ms. D (Appendix) 120' a-Sed7 tag-ga-mu-d& tug ga-ba-an-da-an-mu4 hi- me-en, duplicated in CT 16 1 1 v 51 (+ dupl.), a-Sed7-d& tag-ga-mu-d& br-ra- na tug ga-ba-da-an-mu4 hC-me-en // lu-u fa ina 'kul-si-ia ina uj-li-s'i su-ba- tu KI-S2i lul-ta-bis'at-ta, which may be rendered as \"whether you are the one (thinking), 'since I am cold, let me don with him the cloak on his lap\"'. Cf. note to UHF 328 above. 337 Cf. Edzard ZA 61 218, for the point that the form ba-ra-an-da-ab-nag-e contains an \"incorrect\" form of mar& which should be /nag-nag/, confirmed by Ms. D (Appendix): 167' and 180' [bla-ra-an-da-ab-nag-nag- an. One possible explanation for nag in our line is analogy with gu7 in the previous phrase (ba-ra-an-da-gu7-e). Note that the suffix -en applies both to gu7 and nag. 339 Cf. Pinches JTVI 26 155 iv 13 (= Lackenbacher RA 65 128: 13'), which reads, [ba-ra-ab]-$6-Su-dk-en // telemme, and [ba-ra-ab]-Su-Su-d (CT 16 11:65), in contrast to the Old Babylonian verbal form ba-ra-ab-Su-Su-d6- dk-en, which appears to be the verbal base + /ED/ + first person plural suffix -e(n)den. Such a form is not only inconsistent with the second person 105 Forerunners to Udug-hul singular -zu suffix in 11. 341-344, but with the other verbs in the passage which fall into the following groups (omitting forms with restored endings): A ba-ra-an-da-gu7-e (337) B ba-ra-an-da-nag-en (337) na-ab-il-en (344) C nam-ba-gB-ga-d&en (341) nam-mu-da-bal-d6en (347) nam-mu-un(-da)-ku4-ku4-de-en (348-349) nam-mu-un-da-gi4-gi4-dk-en (350 restored, but almost certain) Although the forms in group D are problematical, and may be corrupt, the remaining verbs are all marQ base + /ED/ + second person singular suffix. It is instructive to compare the parallel verbal forms in Ms. D (Appendix), which appear as follows in an identical context: ba-ra-an-da-ab-gu7-e-en (1 71 ', 184') ba-ra-an-da-ab-nag-nag-an (1 72', 185') na-ab-il-e-en (1 77') ba-ra-an-da-ab-gB-gi-an (1 68'- 170') na-an-Si-in-bar-re-en (178') na-ab-gid-i-d6en (176') These forms a11 confirm second person singular marQ, noting -gu-/-e-en and -il-e-en with durative /el, but mostly lacking /ED/. These parallel verbal forms indicate the non-obligatory character of the /ED/ suffix in marti forms, the precise meaning of which remains unclear. 343 The expression gh gid-i, \"to stretch the neck\" (cf. Akkadian elZpu), has various analogous verbal forms, as can be seen from Ai I1 ii 5-8 (MSL 1 21): Su gid-i, Su gid-gid-i, Su in-da-an-gid, compared with gid-i (Lanu A 182) and gid/gid-gid (= el?pu/alZipu, in Antagal I11 137- 138). Presumably, these distinctions are between hamtu/marii, but a paradigm is nevertheless difficult to establish which takes into account all of the forms gid, gid-i, gid- gid, and gid-gid-i, especially since a root bu-i may be known (cf. A VI/1:192, Nabn. 32 iii 20' [MSL 14 439; 16 2531). In our line, for example, the verbal base gid-i represents the marc base, which is required with the NA-prohibitive (Edzard ZA 61 219), and supported by the form in Ms. D Commentary 104 the \"mere allowance for it as a possibility\" (cf. AS 1673, and Edzard ZA 61 222-5). The use of the first person verbal forms represents the incantation priest reciting formulae or making declarations, as if the patient himself were speaking. Alternatively, the verbal form may be treated literally as a description of the ghost, \"whether you are a 'let me eat with him' (ghost)\", or \"whether you are one (who thought) 'let me eat with him''', as if the ghost were a beggar asking to be fed, anointed, and clothed. As for U4-su-us-e (probably to be analysed as lusu-se/, the translation \"daily\" is based upon the Akkadian translation uma (cf.

The word (uzu)a-za-ad in lexical texts, however, refers either to the head or nose (cf. MSL 9 6:3, 8a, 9), while the identification of a-za-ad with furuppli \"cold\" appears to be attested only in this context (CT 16 12: 1-2). The idea intended here may be that during the sterility of nature's winter, evil remains fertile. mourning garment, which seems uncharacteristic for demons. One possibility is that the demon causes the mourning garment to be worn, but the expression is too rarely used to inspire confidence. Another difficulty is that the late text treats this line as plural, referring to demons in general, reading an-na gur5-ru-US bi-in-bu-ru-US ki-ta kar-ra bi- in-sig-ga // eliS ik~u@rna SapliSkarra iddzi (CT 16 12:9- 1 I). In UHF 361, the absence of plural suffxes suggests that Namtar is the subject of the sentence, followed by a general description of demons.

Since Ms. L lacks sufficient space to accomodate dnin-nennimusen of the duplicate (CT 16 12:20), one is forced to seek an alternative reading, such as nin-na LAGAB~ES = eS-Se-bumusen (Ea I 98 = MSL 14 1 8 1).

The late duplicate reads mu-un-s~r-s[ur-re]-~e-d&~ //it-ta-[na-id-la-lu (CT 16 12:32), which suggests reading the verbal form Du.Du as /lah-lah/, based upon Antagal G 232 ~u.~ula-ah MINDU.DU = i-taS-lu-[lu] (cited CAD N2 55b). ef.

The reading S1 for SUM is based upon lexical evidence cited in MSL 3 73:7' S1 = paqadu, which corresponds in turn to the bilingual duplicates to our line, which translate the verb as pi-qid-su (CT 16 11 vi 39, Surpu VII 85). 358a F or the late corresponding sources, cf. CT 16 12-16. The late source (ibid. 12: 1) reads ba-nigin-na, which is attested in bilinguals in this passage only, although su-nigin is attested lexically (Ea VI B 4, Nabn. 0 286 [MSL 14432; 16 295]). Cf.

Benito EWO 29:89-90 mur-gig-ga sa-gig-ga lipis-gig-ga su-ni a-za-ad hi-la ka-bi-se ninda nu-gar. .. , \"his lung was infected, his heart was infected, his viscera were infected, a-za-ad seizes his body, food could not be placed in his mouth . . . \" Benito, in his notes (p.70), relates a-za-ad here to the disease mentioned in MSL 9 89 lu-sa-la-la = sa karSa pehu, \"the one who is blocked up at (lit. as to) the belly\". The word (uzu)a-za-ad in lexical texts, however, refers either to the head or nose (cf. MSL 96:3, 8a, 9), while the identification of a-za-ad with suruppu \"cold\" appears to be attested only in this context (CT 16 12: 1-2). The idea intended here may be that during the sterility of nature's winter, evil remains fertile. 107 Forerunners to Udug-hul 359 CT 16 12:2 reads a-ri-a, which shows the same variation discussed by Sjoberg in HSAO I 208-209. 361 The expression gur5-us-bUr is discussed by Sjoberg in TCS 3 132. The meaning of kar-s1g is attested in bilinguals from this incantation (CT 16 12:9-11, UET 6392: 16), and supported by lexical entries, such as tug mu-sir (Hh XIX 240 = MSL 10 134) and lu tug-Ia (Lu IV 194 = MSL 12 135); cf. also [si-ig] [si] = nadu sa karrum (A III/4 218 = MSL 14342, cf. CAD K 222a). The difficulty is in explaining why an aggressive demon should don a mourning garment, which seems uncharacteristic for demons. One possibility is that the demon causes the mourning garment to be worn, but the expression is too rarely used to inspire confidence. Another difficulty is that the late text treats this line as plural, referring to demons in general, reading an-na gurs-ru-us bi-in-bu-ru-us ki-ta kar-ra bi-in-sig-ga II elis ik~u~uma saplis karra iddu (CT 16 12:9-11). In UHF 361, the absence of plural suffixes suggests that Namtar is the subject of the sentence, followed by a general description of demons. 362 The meaning of bUr is similar to that of su-bar in UHF 365, but quite different from the meaning of the corresponding duplicate, which reads e-ne-ne-ne dim-rna e aral[i-m]d \"they are the creation of the Netherworld\" (CT 16 12: 12). 366 Since Ms. L lacks sufficient space to accomodate dnin-nennimusen of the duplicate (CT 16 12:20), one is forced to seek an alternative reading, such as nin-na LAGABxES = es-se-bumusen (Ea I 98 = MSL 14 181). 367 Cf.

One may perhaps read kun4-ba as kun4-se. 351 The form he-pa-as, if correctly rendered on the tablet, is problematical, since one expects he-pa-de-es. 352 The late duplicate reads inim den-ki-ke4 (CT 16 11:31), instead of \"word of Ereskigal\". The appearance of Ereskigal in this context, although unexpected, is not unsuitable, since it reflects the similarity between this incantation and Inanna's Descent to the Netherworld cited in the notes to UHF 308-310 above.

The reverse of Ms. L contains snake incantations, unrelated to UHF. The gap should presumably contain the remainder of the incantation, (cf. CT 16 12:48-I3 ii 64). Since the Old Babylonian evidence for UHF only resumes again for the fifth incantation of Udug-hul Tablet V ( = CT 16 15 iv 40-59), it is not possible to ascertain whether all incantations in UH Tablet V had Old Babylonian forerunners, although it is likely that they did. 377 This short incantation is restored after CT 16 15:40-59, and BAM 508 iv 18- 25, which is one of the few examples of an UH incantation duplicated in a me*dical text. One restores [tn 6-nu-ru] for the sake of consistency. The term nig-k nig-k is translated in the late duplicate as haj~&u haj~itu \"watching watchman\" (CT 16 15 iv 41), although nig-it actually means \"(one) watching something\", judging from the lexical evidence it = ha-a-tu (Nabn. V 9 = MSL 16 95), and e = hi-a-tzi (Proto-Diri 225, cited CAD H 159a). The term is another instance of demons forming the Netherworld police force, and the misuse of authority which that implies, similar to the MaSkim and Galla demons. The reference in Lu I1 i 11 to lu-ge6-a-~u-DU = ha-i-tu (MSL 12 116) is reminiscent of the lu-ge6-sa demon encountered in UHF 158, and may designate in our context a \"night watchman \" demon. 379 The writing sa7(s1c7)-lirn may be a unique phonetic writing for SIG7-ALAM ( = /zalam/, corresponding to Akkadian salmu); cf. MSL 16 50: 1-4, and especially Hh XIX 272 tug-gu-za-alam = iri sal-me (MSL 10: 135). 380 Unpublished duplicates to this line translate it: ki-ma KUR-i ia-ab-'ti1 bu- un-n[a-an-ni . . .3, which fits well with other references to destroyed mountains (kur/hur-sag gul, cited CAD A1 42a). 383 For gaba-Su-gar, cf. SjSberg Mondgott 37, although in our line the unusual orthography gaba-KA is baffling; one possibility might be to read gaba-Sur \"angry breast\". The late duplicates add: hul-dub zi an-na hit-p[a zi ki]-a hit- pa (CT 16 15 iv 58 and dupl.). 385-389 The incantation can be found in CT 16 15 iv 60ff. The corresponding late duplicates give a lengthier rendition of the opening lines of this incantation For SeS-gal as a professional title, cf. Edzard SR 78a:13, as well as Falkenstein's comments (ZA 56 59) on SeS-gal dingir-re-e-ne me-en \"I am the tutor of the gods\" ( = Benito EWO 89:71). The late duplicate (CT 16 15 v 12) readsmerely SeS-a-meS (= lemnctu iunu), although the word order is the same, with den-ki-ke4 as an anticipatory genitive. Cf. Falkenstein ZA 55 18, on gu-za-la an den-lil-la \"Sesseltrager Ans (und) Enlils\", but in the incantation context it refers to Netherworld police. The form gub-bu-me: (like gub-gub-bu-me3, UHF 473) contrasts with the late form gub-ba-me5 in the duplicate (CT 16 15 v 14), which reflects the same distinction in non-finite verbal forms ~AL-eda and ~A~-ada (cf. Edzard ZA 62 25-31). It is difficult to predict when participles in our text take the form base + meS, base + a + me:, or base + e + me:. The corresponding late duplicate reads mu-un-sus-sus-ge-eS (CT 16 15 v 16), considered by Krecher to be a confusion in late bilinguals between the roots su(-g) and su(-b) (WdO 4 7-9), although Civil suggests the possibility of [b] and [g] as allophones in Sumerian (JNES 32 57-61). Civil rejects ma(-g) and sug(-b) as examples of phonemic alteration (ibid. 5.2), since in earlier periods the roots mean \"to go (plural)\" and \"to stand (plural)\" respectively without being confused, although in later periods the two roots may have become conflated because of analogous cases of [b] - [g] in final position (ibid. 3.1). A similar idea is reflected in the Hendursanga Hymn 44-45 (cf. Edzard and Wilcke AOAT 25 146): When one invoked Hendur-sag's name, he could walk along the safe quiet street at night. This statement alludes to Hendur-sag's epithets, nimgir sila si-ga and nimgir ge6-u-na, which appear in our text and in CT 16 49:304 (= Iraq 42 31:183'). Commentary 108 dam ur lu-ke4 and dam Iu urJke4?1 (cf. CT 16 12:36), translated as assata ina utli ameli itarrii \"they turn to the wife in the man's lap\". 375-376 An interesting parallel occurs in the Instructions ofSuruppak 49: u-nu-kin-ga-se udu-zu sag(PA.GAN) nam-me, \"auf einer unbekannten Weide sollst du deine Schafe nicht auseinander laufen lassen' (Wilcke, ZA 68 204). These lines can only be understood if taken together as a single sentence. The late duplicate (CT 16 12:44-46) is badly corrupted in the only complete manuscript (K 3121 coll.), with the confusion arising from the fact that the commonplace phrase lu-ulu dumu dingir-ra-na has been divided between two lines. The reverse of Ms. L contains snake incantations, unrelated to UHF. The gap should presumably contain the remainder of the incantation, (cf. CT 16 12:48-13 ii 64). Since the Old Babylonian evidence for UHF only resumes again for the fifth incantation ofUdug-hul Tablet V (= CT 16 15 iv 40-59), it is not possible to ascertain whether all incantations in UH Tablet V had Old Babylonian forerunners, although it is likely that they did. 377 This short incantation is restored after CT 16 15:40-59, and BAM 508 iv 18-25, which is one of the few examples of an UH incantation duplicated in a m6dical text. One restores [en e-nu-ru] for the sake of consistency. The term nig-e nig-e is translated in the late duplicate as hajjii.tu hajji.tu \"watching watchman\" (CT 16 15 iv 41), although nig-e actually means \"(one) watching something\", judging from the lexical evidence e = ha-a-.tu (Nabn. V 9 = MSL 1695), and e = hi-a-.tit (Proto-Diri 225, cited CAD H 159a). The term is another instance of demons forming the Netherworld police force, and the misuse of authority which that implies, similar to the Maskim and Galla demons. The reference in Lu II i 11 to lu-ge6-a-Du-Du = ha-i-.tu (MSL 12 116) is reminiscent of the lu-ge6-sa demon encountered in UHF 158, and may designate in our context a \"night watchman \" demon. 379 The writing sa7(sIG7)-lim may be a unique phonetic writing for SIGrALAM (= /zalam/, corresponding to Akkadian ~almu); cf. MSL 1650:1-4, and especially Hh XIX 272 tug-gu-za-alam = sa ~al-me (MSL 10: 135). 380 Unpublished duplicates to this line translate it: ki-ma KUR-i ia-abJtz'l bu-un-n[a-an-ni ...

It is difficult to predict when participles in our text take the form base + mes, base + a + mes, or base + e + meso The corresponding late duplicate reads mu-un-sus-sus-ge-es (CT 16 15 v 16), considered by Krecher to be a confusion in late bilinguals between the roots sue-g) and sue-b) (WdO 4 7-9), although Civil suggests the possibility of [b] and [g] as allophones in Sumerian (JNES 32 57-61). Civil rejects SU8(-g) and sU8(-b) as examples of phonemic alteration (ibid. 5.2), since in earlier periods the roots mean \"to go (plural)\" and \"to stand (plural)\" respectively without being confused, although in later periods the two roots may have become conflated because of analogous cases of [b] ~ [g] in final position (ibid. 3.1).

Since the Old Babylonian evidence for UHF only resumes again for the fifth incantation ofUdug-hul Tablet V (= CT 16 15 iv 40-59), it is not possible to ascertain whether all incantations in UH Tablet V had Old Babylonian forerunners, although it is likely that they did. 377 This short incantation is restored after CT 16 15:40-59, and BAM 508 iv 18-25, which is one of the few examples of an UH incantation duplicated in a m6dical text.

The term nig-e nig-e is translated in the late duplicate as hajjii.tu hajji.tu \"watching watchman\" (CT 16 15 iv 41), although nig-e actually means \"(one) watching something\", judging from the lexical evidence e = ha-a-.tu (Nabn. V 9 = MSL 1695), and e = hi-a-.tit (Proto-Diri 225, cited CAD H 159a). The term is another instance of demons forming the Netherworld police force, and the misuse of authority which that implies, similar to the Maskim and Galla demons. The reference in Lu II i 11 to lu-ge6-a-Du-Du = ha-i-.tu (MSL 12 116) is reminiscent of the lu-ge6-sa demon encountered in UHF 158, and may designate in our context a \"night watchman \" demon. 379 The writing sa7(sIG7)-lim may be a unique phonetic writing for SIGrALAM (= /zalam/, corresponding to Akkadian ~almu); cf.

The interpretation of the late text is unlikely, not only because it is unsupported by the Old Babylonian text, but also because the Seven are associated with the Abyss in this incantation, and not with heaven.

The gap should contain [min-kam-ma . . .I. The length of the gap of three lines can be calculated from the reverse of the tablet, Ms. B columns V-VI (11. 616f. below).

The sequence of seven is a literary motif building up to a climax, since the approach of each demon increases the victim's awareness of his plight, until at last he reconciles himself to his death. Cf. the note to UHF 398 above. The tablet reads gig-nu-na-na. The verbal forms follow the pattern discussed in note 339 above, that fully suffixed forms need only appear in the initial verb of a sequence, as here, gu7-e-en followed by -nag-e(-en).

The sequence of seven is a literary motif building up to a climax, since the approach of each demon increases the victim's awareness of his plight, until at last he reconciles himself to his death. 441 Cf. the note to UHF 398 above. 445 The tablet reads gis-nu-na-na. 448 The verbal forms follow the pattern discussed in note 339 above, that fully suffixed forms need only appear in the initial verb of a sequence, as here, gU7-e-en followed by -nag-e(-en). 449 Later texts (CT 16 11:61 and 13:58) identify Enlil as the engendering parent (gisbansur-a-a-ugu-zu-den-lil-hi-ke4 \"on your parent Enlil's table\"), treated grammatically as one connected phrase. 451-466 The incantation can be restored after von Weiher SBTU II 6 20-35, as well as Lackenbacher RA 65 146:1 'ff. (cf. photo fig. 13), and CT 16 16 vi 1-25. This incantation may have been incorporated into UH because of the udug hul cited in the incipit, as well as the intriguing presence ofInanna adjuring the demons. This same incantation was included within the compilation of incantations against the li/ftu demon (with the rubric ka-inim-ma ki-sikil-lil-la-kam, SBTU II 619,35, and RA 65144:3), but in this latter case the ki-sikil mentioned in the incipit was the victim of the ki-sikil-lil-la demon. The verbal form appears in the late duplicates as mu-un-da-ru-us, which appears as a singular form in another incantation context, translated with ih-me-su \" ... lamed him\" (CT 17 19 i 13-14). 458 For gi6-par as the dwelling of the en-priest/priestess, cf.

The interpretation of the late text is unlikely, not only because it is unsupported by the Old Babylonian text, but also because the Seven are associated with the Abyss in this incantation, and not with heaven. One possible solution to the~ Old Babylonian text is to assume the personification of the idim abzu, thus: \"The Source of the Abzu (I dim Abzu) and the Seven are they, the Seven are his adornment, they are brought out from the (Netherworld) apartment by Idim Abzu\" [Jacobsen]. A related description reads imin-bi kur-ta e-a-mes \"the Seven of them came out of the Mountain\" (CT 1645:131). The cosmological connotations of the terms idim and kur are also reflected in the Kes Temple Hymn (1. 52), e an-se kur-ra-am ki-se idim-ma-am \"at its height it is the mountain, at its bottom it is the abyss (Sjoberg TCS 3 170).

Commentary 112 Likewise in our text the gipar appears to be Inanna's, since she is mentioned in the very next line, and the sanctuary seems to serve as a place of refuge, even from attacking demons. 459 A similar line occurs in an unpublished Ur III incantation: an mu-da-dub ki mu-da-sig (IM 61440, courtesy LL. Finkel), with similar passages cited in CAD NI 348a. 460-461 The late duplicate (SBTU II 6 28-30) reads: 468 gaba-gaI-a dinanna-ke4 an-na gu mi-ni-in-[d6J ki-a gU mi-ni-in-r[aJ bi-in-ra lZI im-ma-an-zA[R] 'in arrogance, Inanna cried out in heaven, cried out on earth, struck out, and flashed fire.' The [en e-nu-ru] rubric is added for the sake of consistency. The following incantation, although not duplicated in CT 16, is included here because of the thematic similarity between this incantation and other incantations in UH Tablet V, and because the tablet bears an \"Udug-hul\" rubric. The same incipit ga1s-la-e-ne ga1s-Ia-e-ne appears in three other Old Babylonian ißcantations, CT 4,4 (Bu 88-5-12, 7) [which has been recopied here as Ms. K, plates 19-20], TCL 1663, and YOS 11 68, as weIl as the Late Assyrian duplicates copied and edited by Mrs. D. Linton (MA thesis, Univ. of Birmingham, 1975, unpublished), 277ff., although no Akkadian translation of this incantation has yet appeared. Three of the Old Babylonian incantations with this incipit (UHF Ms. G, YOS 11 68, and TCL 16 63) have rubrics identifying the incantation as Udug-hul.

The reading kes, however, can be identified with certainty in the following glosses: he-eke-eskes (= ?ki~~ar) A 29975 (unpub., cited CAD A2 111 b) nu-mu-ne-kesik'-si (AOAT 25 216:15) ka-keski-sLDU (Or NS 44 62:4) i1-kekMes (Izbu Commentary 246) su-ki-issU lO-KES U/ tiqnu) (ArOr 37 485:83) Poebel argued for the root ofthis word as either *kes(d) or *kes(s) based upon the appearance of KES and KES.DU in texts of the Ur IÜ period and earlier (AS 2 35-36). Nominal forms, for instance, are regularly KES.DU, corresponding to later /kesdaj: gis-KES.DU (SAKI 364:2) compared with gis-kesdajkes-da (or gis-giridjgiriu-daJ (Erimhus II 61 and 238; cf. Hh IX 316 (MSL 7 52]), and gi-KES.DU (JCS 2037) compared wit.h gi-gis-kes-da (Hh IX 318 (MSL 752, and 195: 172]). Poebel (op. eil.), foIlowed by Bauer (WdO 8 5), cited Old Sumerian verbal forms i-KES and ka e-da-KEs, as weIl as verbal forms in KES.DU: i-KES.Du-a e-ne-KES.Du-am6, e-ta-KES.DU, nu-ta-KES.DU. Particularly significant, however, are those forms in which KES.Duparallels KES-de: cf. sakan KES-de (Eames p. 155 No. 8*) and sakan KES.DU (UET 3 1767 rev. ii 13), as weIl as the form KES-de-de (UET 3 873:5). If all of these forms represent the same root, the obvious conclusion is a root ending in /d/, which is only expressed under certain phonemic 115 Forerunners to Udug-hul conditions. The difference between forms KES and KES.DU, and the conditions under which /dj is expressed, can only be explained by reading KES.DU as kes-ra, as a nominalised form of *kesdjr. A root *kesd/r has already been proposed on other grounds (cf. Hallo YNER 3 81), but can be substantiated by tbis orthography, since conventionally -ra follows the trill consonant dir, and hence the writing kes-ra always represents a nominalised or non-finite verbal form, in contrast to KES or KES-de (= KES + /ed/ + e). Krecher (ZA 58 54) bases the readings kesex-d and kesex-r, upon a restored passage, (e kejkaJ-sa-ad-da = bi-tu ra-ak-su (KUB 308:4), and upon sag kes-se-ra-ab = ki-i~-sa-ar (OBGT XII 5 = MSL 4 119), although this second example can be alternatively interpreted as an imperative form, EZEN-se-ra-ab. Krecher himself remarks (ibid. n. 32): \"Trotz dieses kes-se-r bleibt die Lesung vieler Stellen mit KES-r unklar, da auch sIr und girlI überliefert sind\". The reading of *kesd/r for EZEN is not exclusively used, even in Ur III texts. A \"cordmaker\", for instance, is called a lu-sa-sir-ra (UET 3/2 124), related to a \"bundle\" sa-sir-ra (UET 3/2 147), and other Ur III and Old Babylonian forms suggest a reading of sir/sir for EZEN: ba-an-sirsär.sirsar.re-es (UHF 479) la-ba-an-na-sir (vaL rsir1) (Lambert JNES 33 292:8) mu-e-sir-ra (UET 3 1575:3) suku sir-ra (UET 2 368 and 371) with further evidence supplied by the late texts: ba-an-sir(var. sar)-re (Borger JCS 21 5:37) hu-mu-ra-ab-SAR-ra (CT 16 37:35) [= rakäsu] The question is whether this supposed distinction between EZEN-d and EZEN-r (kesdjr versus sir) is merely orthographie rather than phonemic, since recan also have the value des (as rendered in CAD K 251a, e.g. in-kes-kes-des and he-ni-ib-kes-des-e-de). The difficulty in reading EZEN-d/r can be demonstrated in the following rubrics in Old Babylonian incantations: ka-inim-ma idim ka-kes-da-kam ka-inim-ma munus kes-da-kam ka-inim-ma nim-ma-ka ka-sir-re-da-kam (Finkel AfO 27 38:22) (ibid. 40:20) (YOS 11:6) Similar ambiguities occur in the following examples: suh-slr-re (YNER 3 14:3) vs. su-ki-isSU IO.KES (ArOr 37 485:84) mu-un-na-sir-re-dt\\ var. -kes-d[a-de] (Alster Mesop. 1 74: 184) sir-re-de, var. kes-da-gin7 (Wilcke Lugab. 113:246)"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Commentary and similarly for ka-EZEN: a-S$-ga ri-a ka-sir-re (Ur 111) Or Ns 44 55:21 a Sa-ga ri-a ka-k6Ski-si-ra (OB) ibid. 62:4 (pupl. to above) SB ka-KES-~~ 6-a (late) MSL 1- 6520 ka-gir (= kalti Sh m&) [= phonet~c MSL 16 122:250 ka-giril MSL 16 122:250 Another candidate for EZEN is the reading &rill, which was read as /girid/ in the late period, based upon the following late forms: giril 1-dagl-ri- fu-di: (I/ tu-ta-ag-gu-ni-ka) (SBH 69:l I), and giSki-ri-idgirill (Hh VI 7 = MSL 6 51).

Wiggermann kindly drew the author's attention to Zimmern's note in VAS 2 xviii, citing V AS 2 97 (V AT 1343) as part of this same tablet, and Mr. J. Marzahn has confirmed that there is no directjoin. The gap ofthree lines at the top of the reverse ofV AT 1343 shöuld contain three lines of the \"Marduk-Ea formula\" (cf. LSS NFl 54-55, and UHF 195-198). The juxtaposition of im abzu-ta with alam in ritual contexts can be found in STT n 173:50-53, CT 1729:30-30:32, and ibid. 30 K 3518 rev. 2-3. Cf. also Lackenbacher RA 65 138 iii 9-14. 495 The position within the incantation of the zi-pa formulae corresponds to the brieflist in TCL 16 63 40-43, even though the same gods may not have been invoked. Cf. similarly the series of zi-pa formulae in UH Tablet V passim (CT 16 13-15), as wen as the long list in PBS 1/2112 (note Udug-hul rubric!), to be edited by W.G. Lambert. 506-507 Cf. above, UHF 354,355. These futurum exactum forms (not actually imperatives) are usually considered to be incompatible with suffix -e or /ED/ (cf. Jacobsen AS 1677), which may suggest that the restoration based upon late duplicates i8 incorrect. 508 The gloss on the verbal form suggests /me'esi/ as the intended normalization of the verb. 510 The rubric is written in a unique manner, with udug rendered phonetically, cf. J. Klein, Three Sulgi Hymns (1981),106221. The same rubric appears at the end ofTCL 1663:56 (presumably read udug-hul!-Ia'-kam), and at the end ofYOS 11 68. Although all ofthese texts have \"Udug-hul\" rubrics, this incantation does not seem to have been incorporated into the later UR Series. 511-645 Cf. CT 1630-34 and duplicates, although the order ofincantations differs. Cf. also Falkenstein, LSS NFI 83ff. 512 This li ne seems to equate the Udug demon with the Gidim as in Gilg.

The reading is confirmed by cdlations of both the author and Dr. Sally Moren, despite the note in Wilcke Lugalb. 150 that the sign should be read as \"Sid\". Many examples of the related verb SIG~ gi4(-gi4) \"to cry, shout\" are cited by Falkenstein in GSGL I p. 30. Because a similar semantic range can be demonstrated for [KA x SID/BALAG/LI] gi4-gi4 (cf. Gordon SP 331), Falkenstein (GSGL 1 p. 30) assigned KAxLI the value sIGl4 as synonymous with SIG~. This latter value was changed to Si,, based upon the reading in Gelb MAD 2 No. 307a SIG~ = /Six/, which has won wide acceptance as part of the verbal form Six gi4-gi4 (cf. inter alia Sjoberg TCS 3 77). Heimpel, however, bases his reading Six upon the following duplicates (cf. St Pohl2 49 1): UET 6 203: 17 SBH 82: 1 1 and cf. pirig-e a-gal-a Se e-ni-ib-gi4 (Genouillac Trouvaille 1 3-4). Both of these examples are parallel to s1G4(Seg12) gi4-gi4 in form and meaning, and suggest a reading /Se(g)/ for KAXSID. Cf. also Lugale 11 and 520. This reading for KAXSID clearly contradicts the phonetic writing a-ra in UHF, which has, however, some support in lexical texts. The sign KAXSID is found in Nabnitu as a nominal form (Nabn. B 209-21 1 = MSL 16 261f.): KAXSID = (rigmu) ia ir-ti KAXSID-KAXSID = MIN fa ir-ti a-18 = MIN $a ir-ti Forerunners to Udug-hul and MSE 16 260f.: gu-ra-a[h] = rigmu (11. 149, 155, and 194) This last form may be related to the verb gu ra-ra \"to shout\", which is synonymous with KAXSID gi4-gi4 (cf. Cohen Enmerkar 122, Hallo YNER 3 18:29), and it is conceivable that both a-I8 and gurah might represent aliomorphs for /ara/. One possible solution to our problem is to consider SIG~ gi4-gi4 and KAXSID gi4-gi4 as separate but synonymous, related to the general notion of speech, as in inim gi4-gi4. As a clue to the difference between these two words, cf. the following examples: ~u~~u(KAxNE)-~~ d-dub \"when her anger causes trembling\" ZA 65 180:17 im-dugudmuien-gin7 SIG4 gi4-a-bi-Se an im-di-dub-dub \"like the Anzu-bird, when it cries, shakes the heaven\" Gud Cyl A 9 14 Since SIG~ has both the values murgu and mur7, one might reconstruct the verb as mur7-gi4-a-bi-Se \"like the Anzu-bird, when angry, it shakes the heaven\". This reading of mur7 is supported by lexical evidence: [~IU-~~MUR = ri(gmu] (MSL 3 221 ii 7') and by words for \"voice\" in Ugu (MSL 9 55112-115): gd-HAR-mu gd-kiri6-mu za-pa-kg-mu The reading gii-kiri6 is clearly phonetic for gu-kiri (KA), a \"nasal voice\", and by analogy, the previous line may be read gii-mur-mu for \"voice\" of some type, perhaps related to shouting.

Cf. above, note to UHF 30. The literal meaning of 16-ra igi-bi+a nu-un-zu(-US) would be \"they are not recognizable in their faces to the man\". 647 This incantation is found in CT 16 24: 1-25:40. The meaning of Ms. B differs from the duplicates, reading simply \"the evil Udug-demon is silent in the street. . .\" Cf. UHF 396 (also Ms. B): [zi dhendur-sag-gal nimgir sila si-ga he-pa, i.e. a night watchman is required since demons lurk in quiet streets.

A III/5:130 (MSL 14 347). A similar case of alternative readings occurs in Lugale 74, in which one Old Babylonian manuscript reads ba-e-el *-d2 // re7re-eS. 648 One problem with this line is the precise meaning of S~-gi(~), which can correspond to Akkadian habcisu (\"niederschlagen?\" AHw 303a) or ham@u \"to rob, strip\" (AKw 315b, although both words are treated as phonetic variants in CAD H 60a). In this case the suggested meaning would be that the demon does not strip or rob the robber in the no-man's land of the steppe, but allows the thief to keep his ill-gotten gain. The alternative meaning adopted here is suggested by the fragmentary late duplicate, Forerunners to Udug-hul which reads [US] nu-gu7 (// [ZJG ipaddzi) \"show(s) no pity. . .\" (CT I6 24:4). Cf. Su-gi4 as Akkadian Sullumu \"to preserve\" in MSL 13 118:139, SBK p. 141 215-216. In all of the manuscripts, IipiS is written AB + SA rather than ABxSA.

In both B and I, the plural /eS/ has been omitted in the second verb since it immediately follows a plural verb with /eS/ expressed (mu-un-da-ru-US); cf. the late duplicate ba-ni-in-sd-eS (CT 16 24: 10). The verbal form in Ms. I i-bal-bal-e-en appears to be causative, \"you push that man away from his vitality\". Although sag is missing from the corresponding line in CT 16 24: 12, the noun sag-zi can nevertheless be restored after HruSka ArOr 375 19 (sag-zi = agzi), and Antagal F 55-56 [salg-zi = (a-gu-u) gal-tu, corresponding to the Akkadian translation of our line in CT 16 24:14 (kima agg. These two lines are only found in Ms. C and in the late duplicate (CT 16 24:12-15), which may perhaps suggest that text C is later than the other Forerunners. The issue is not clear cut, however, since the Late Babylonian duplicate includes an additional line which does not appear in Ms. C or any of the Forerunners, and the Late Babylonian text also abbreviates the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue (cf. CT 16 24:16-17), in contrast to all of the UHF sources. Cf. above UHF 647, in which Ms. E reads sila si gig-ga \"infecting the quiet street\", while here further elaborating the fact that demons lurk because streets are silent. For this use of gin7, cf. Wilcke Eugalb. 149, \"-gim nach nominalisierten Satzen in der Bedeutung 'demgemass, dass', 'weil\"'. Cf. above UHF 652, in which Ms. B reads i-bal-bal-e instead of lu bal-bal-e. Restored after Falkenstein LSS NFI 54. The repetition of the line with the god's name in Ms. E (but not in B) is a typical pattern of Sumerian poetry, but this repetition is not universally employed in the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue of Old Babylonian incantations; cf. Ms. K (= CT 4,4):24-25 (dumu-mu. . . dasal-1G-hi. . .) versus CT 4,8:27 (only dumu-mu. . .). The syntactical use of the ii in this passage requires further elucidation, since its usage here as a conjunction seems superfluous. Poebel, GSG $408- 409 renders this form as \"pleonastic u\" with either bi-da/ta or n-ga, citing this line from the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue as the only example of u used in Commentary 124 624 626 628 629-630 647 648 For the reading emeda, cf. the following: e-me-da UM.ME e-me-da UM.ME ta-ri-tum Proto-Ea 186 (MSL 1439) Proto-Aa 186:1 (MSL 14 96) An alternative reading ummeda is known from the following: um-me-da DUB.ME ta-ri-tu4 Aa UI/5:27 (CT 12 14:27 MSL 14344) Cf. also MSL 14312, 315; the example from Aa 1II/5:27 looks like a scribal error for UM.ME, although quoted in a sequence of DUB entries.

T~e verbal forms ba-ge6-ge6 (CT 1632:139 reads ba-an-ge6-ge6) and nu-un-zu are both treated as third person plural hamtu (punctive) forms with final-d/us not indicated, since the final-es of the preceding clause (1. 628) is intended to apply to these lines as welL Cf. above, note to UHF 30. The literal meaning of Iu-ra igi-bi +a nu-un-zu(-us) would be \"they are not recognizable in their faces to the man\". This incantation is found in CT 1624: 1-25:40. The meaning of Ms. B differs from the duplicates, reading simply \"the evil Udug-demon is silent-in the street. .. \" Cf. UHF 396 (also Ms. B): [zi dhendur-sag-ga] nimgir sila si-ga he-pa, i.e. a night watchman is required since demons lurk in quiet streets. The variant su-su II tar in Ms. I appears to be a gloss providing an alternative or synonymous verbal root, since su and tar both correspond to Akkadian pararu.

A III/5:130 (MSL 14347). A similar case of alternative readings occurs in Lugale 74, in which one Old Babylonian manuscript reads ba-e-ell-de / / re?re-es. One problem with this line is the precise meaning of su-gi(4), which can correspond to Akkadian habii~u (\"niederschlagen?\" AHw 303a) or hama~u \"to rob, strip\" (AHw 315b, although both words are treated as phonetic variants in CAD H 60a). In this case the suggested meaning would be that the demon does not strip or rob the robber in the no-man's land of the steppe, but allows the thief to keep his ill-gotten gain. The alternative meaning adopted here is suggested by the fragmentary late duplicate, 125 Forerunners to Udug-hul which reads [us] nu-gu? (1/ [l]a ipaddu) \"show(s) no pity ... \" (CT 1624:4). Cf. su-gi4 as Akkadian sullumu \"to preserve\" in MSL 13 118: 139, SBH p. 141 215-216. 650 In all of the manuscripts, lipis is written AB + sA rather than ABxSA.

Surpu VII 25 ze-ta ba-an-su-su (var. -su-ge), which supports the reading of ze-su in Ms. I to ze-us in Ms. B. In both B and I, the plural/esl has been omitted in the second verb since it immediately follows a plural verb with /es/ expressed (mu-un-da-ru-us); cf. the late duplicate ba-ni-in-su-es (CT 16 24:10). 652 The verbal form in Ms. I i-bal-bal-e-en appears to be causative, \"you push that man away from his vitality\". 653-654 Although sag is missing from the corresponding line in CT 1624:12, the noun sag-zi can nevertheless be restored after Hruska ArOr 37:519 (sag-zi = agu), and Antagal F 55-56 [sa]g-zi = (a-gu-u) gal-tu, corresponding to the Akkadian translation of our line in CT 16 24:14 (klma agl). These two lines are only found in Ms. C and in the late duplicate (CT 16 24:12-15), which may perhaps suggest that text C is later than the other Forerunners. The issue is not clear cut, however, since the Late Babylonian duplicate includes an additional line which does not appear in Ms. C or any of the Forerunners, and the Late Babylonian text also abbreviates the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue (cf.

Ms. K (= CT 4,4):24-25 (dumu-mu ... dasal-Iu-hi ... ) versus CT 4,8:27 (only dumu-mu ... ). 668 The syntactical use of the u in this passage requires further elucidation, since its usage here as a conjunction seems superfluous. Poe bel, GSG §408-409 renders this form as \"pleonastic u\" with either bi-da/ta or n-ga, citing this line from the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue as the only example of u used in Commentary 124 624 626 628 629-630 647 648 For the reading emeda, cf. the following: e-me-da UM.ME e-me-da UM.ME ta-ri-tum Proto-Ea 186 (MSL 1439) Proto-Aa 186:1 (MSL 14 96) An alternative reading ummeda is known from the following: um-me-da DUB.ME ta-ri-tu4 Aa UI/5:27 (CT 12 14:27 MSL 14344) Cf. also MSL 14312, 315; the example from Aa 1II/5:27 looks like a scribal error for UM.ME, although quoted in a sequence of DUB entries. The tablet is incorrectly joined, so that the beginning and end of several lines in this passage do not match on the tablet. This line is restored after UHF 554, and confirmed by CT 16 32:136 [k]zma mini ina me isahhalU. Although ga-hab can be read kisim (= kisimmu \"soured milk\") in Hh 24 101 (MSL 11 81), nevertheless.the repetition of hab in our text virutally rules this reading out, especially since hab alone means \"malodorous\" (= bzsu, cf. CAD B 270b). T~e verbal forms ba-ge6-ge6 (CT 1632:139 reads ba-an-ge6-ge6) and nu-un-zu are both treated as third person plural hamtu (punctive) forms with final-d/us not indicated, since the final-es of the preceding clause (1. 628) is intended to apply to these lines as welL Cf. above, note to UHF 30. The literal meaning of Iu-ra igi-bi +a nu-un-zu(-us) would be \"they are not recognizable in their faces to the man\". This incantation is found in CT 1624: 1-25:40. The meaning of Ms. B differs from the duplicates, reading simply \"the evil Udug-demon is silent-in the street. .. \" Cf. UHF 396 (also Ms. B): [zi dhendur-sag-ga] nimgir sila si-ga he-pa, i.e. a night watchman is required since demons lurk in quiet streets. The variant su-su II tar in Ms. I appears to be a gloss providing an alternative or synonymous verbal root, since su and tar both correspond to Akkadian pararu. Cf. van Dijk HSAO 262:49 (OB royal ritual): igi-bi tilla-a dug-gin? he-su-su (f I kzma DUG lipparir) \"may it be smashed like a pot in the street\", and for tar = purruru, cf. A III/5:130 (MSL 14347). A similar case of alternative readings occurs in Lugale 74, in which one Old Babylonian manuscript reads ba-e-ell-de / / re?re-es. One problem with this line is the precise meaning of su-gi(4), which can correspond to Akkadian habii~u (\"niederschlagen?\" AHw 303a) or hama~u \"to rob, strip\" (AHw 315b, although both words are treated as phonetic variants in CAD H 60a). In this case the suggested meaning would be that the demon does not strip or rob the robber in the no-man's land of the steppe, but allows the thief to keep his ill-gotten gain. The alternative meaning adopted here is suggested by the fragmentary late duplicate, 125 Forerunners to Udug-hul which reads [us] nu-gu? (1/ [l]a ipaddu) \"show(s) no pity ... \" (CT 1624:4). Cf. su-gi4 as Akkadian sullumu \"to preserve\" in MSL 13 118: 139, SBH p. 141 215-216. 650 In all of the manuscripts, lipis is written AB + sA rather than ABxSA.

Surpu VII 25 ze-ta ba-an-su-su (var. -su-ge), which supports the reading of ze-su in Ms. I to ze-us in Ms. B. In both B and I, the plural/esl has been omitted in the second verb since it immediately follows a plural verb with /es/ expressed (mu-un-da-ru-us); cf. the late duplicate ba-ni-in-su-es (CT 16 24:10). 652 The verbal form in Ms. I i-bal-bal-e-en appears to be causative, \"you push that man away from his vitality\". 653-654 Although sag is missing from the corresponding line in CT 1624:12, the noun sag-zi can nevertheless be restored after Hruska ArOr 37:519 (sag-zi = agu), and Antagal F 55-56 [sa]g-zi = (a-gu-u) gal-tu, corresponding to the Akkadian translation of our line in CT 16 24:14 (klma agl). These two lines are only found in Ms. C and in the late duplicate (CT 16 24:12-15), which may perhaps suggest that text C is later than the other Forerunners. The issue is not clear cut, however, since the Late Babylonian duplicate includes an additional line which does not appear in Ms. C or any of the Forerunners, and the Late Babylonian text also abbreviates the Enki-Asalluhi dialogue (cf.

Jacobsen AS 16 77, and Poebel GSG p. 268-270). The interesting pattern here is the futurum exactum followed by hk f hamfu, since Jacobsen states that the form is \"usually followed by a durative (pres./fut.) in -em (AS 16 77). The possibility presents itself that he + hamtu may be neither affirmative nor optative, but a clause of result, implying \"when (something) is done, so that (something else) may (potentially) happen\". Cf. UHF 156-158 and 785-788, and Lugale 473 and 478 for other examples of this same pattern, and Gragg JNES 32 131-133. 673 The ambiguity of sig in this context may have indirectly .led to the more precise wording in the late duplicate, which reads lu-u18-lu-bi a u-me-ni-su \"sprinkle that man with water\" (CT 16 24:22). The verb sig is treated here as synonymous with Akkadian paSiihu, which is supported by MSL 3 66:13, and CT 17 33:19 (he-en-ib-sig-ga // lipiah), as well as Ea I 225 (MSL 14 188): si-ig SA~ = paiiihu. The variant nig-narn in Ms. J is probably intended as an orthographic variant to nig-na, since the writing nig-nam for nignakku occurs similarly in BAM 214 ii 1.

The writing ka-la of Ms. N may be phonetic for gal-la. These lines have been discussed by Cooper AnOr 52 150- 154. Cooper's reading gistukul before an-na-ke4 (ibid. 15 14) is incorrect. za-pa-ag as \"voice9' occurs in Ugu (MSL 9 55: 1 15), although in this context it represents a sound which frightens demons. Cf. InninSagurra 11 (ZA 65 1 78): za-pa-ag dugud-da-ni-56 dingir kalam-make4 ur dm-ma-ur4-ru-d12 \"the gods of Sumer fear her enormous roar\", which is similar to van Dijk SGL 2 8:49: za-pa-ag-zu di[ngir na-me] slag nu]-mu-un-de-ga-ga \"no god is able to oppose your roar\" (cf. also KAR 101 ii 7). Falkenstein, SGL 1 105, observes that in literary contexts za-pa-ag usually refers to noise made by gods. As for the verbal form, the late source reads za-pa-ag me-lam-a-ni hu- luh-ha nig-hul ba-ab-bu-ra Su u-me-ti \"take the (drum) which, through the terrifying noise of his! radiance, drives away any evil\" (CT 16 24:25-26). Cooper, AnOr 52 1525 proposes that the late verbal form ba-ab-bu-ra is merely an auditory error for ba-ab-ur-re, which is unlikely, however, in the light of UHF Ms. B which reads bi-ib-bu-re. Two separate verbal roots appear in this line, either bu(r) or ur. The first root bu(r) \"to tear, rip out\" (cf. Eridu Lam. 2: 18 [Green JCS 30 1341) corresponds lexically to A VIIIj2 173 (MSL 14 501): bu-ur BUR = nasahu ia surrum \"flaking of flint\". For ur, \"sweep away\", cf. Sjoberg ZA 65 219 (citing Akkadian maiiiru and Mu), Gragg Infixes 94, and Romer SKI 46: 12 1. In Ms. B, DU is written over SUM (hence u-me-ni-tum instead of u-me-si in Mss. E and J), corresponding to u-me-ni-dt (= arc \"to lead\") in CT 16 24:29. Hence, the reading u-me-ni-~~(var. dC) may point to a reading de6@u) for arc, although only the reading tum is attested lexically (CAD A2 3 13). Cooper's treatment of sag-tu-uk as the equivalent of rabi~u (AnOr 52 1528) is adopted here, although in other contexts the word is written as sag- tuk(u) (cf. Sjoberg RA 60 91 and Falkenstein NSU ii 160:38 and iii 155). The late duplicate reads a-tah-zu (for a-tah-zu) \"your helper\" (CT 16 24:29). The late source reads za-pa-ag me-lam-a-ni hu-mu-ra-ab-dah-e \"let it increase for you his! awe-inspiring noise\" (CT 16 24:32). Cf. Cooper AnOr 52 1522. The u prefix of Ms. E is confirmed by collation. Cf. CT 16 49:298 (Iraq 42 31: 177'): udug ddim-me uSl 1 lu-ra su-su (\". . . spattered the man with poison\").

Although the u-preformative (u-me-ni + root) is the typical form of ritual instructions, it is not actually an imperative (as translated by the Akkadian), but the futurum exactum \"when ... then ... \" (cf. Jacobsen AS 1677, and Poebel GSG p. 268-270).

The interesting pattern here is the futurum exactum followed by he + hamtu, since Jacobsen states that the form is \"usually followed by a durative (pres./fut.) in -e\" (AS 1677). The possibility presents itself that he + hamtu may be neither affirmative nor optative, but a clause of result, implying \"when (something) is done, so that (something else) may (potentially) happen\".

Cooper, AnOr 52 1525 proposes that the late verbal form ba-ab-bu-ra is merely an auditory error for ba-ab-ur-re, which is unlikely, however, in the light of UHF Ms. B which reads bi-ib-bu-re. Two separate verbal roots appear in this line, either bu(r) or ur. The first root bu(r) \"to tear, rip out\" (cf. Eridu Lam. 2: 18 [Green JCS 30 134]) corresponds lexically to A VIII/2 173 (MSL 14501): bu-ur BUR = nasahu sa .surrum \"flaking offlint\". For ur, \"sweep away\", cf.

Hence, the reading u-me-ni-Du(var. de) may point to a reading de6(DU) for aru, although only the reading tum is attested lexically (CAD A2313). Cooper's treatment of sag-tu-uk as the equivalent of rabi~u (AnOr 52 1528) is adopted here, although in other contexts the word is written as sag-tuk(u) (cf.

The personal singular suffix on Sa-ni is also difficult to explain, unless it refers to the victim. The solution proposed here is that the demons leave the Netherworld and Duku only to reappear (2 = apli) in the victim's body. For du6-ku, cf. Barton MBI No. 8 and Chiera SRT No. 25, in which the Duku is described as the home of the Anunna, and the birthplace of Lahar and ASnan (cf. also CT 16 14 iv 30). The Duku also serves as an epithet of the Eridu temple, and a synonym for the Abzu (cf. Malku 1 290, Green Eridu 209). Likewise, the kur-idim is translated in Bit Rimki as the Sad naihi \"mountain of the (primordial) source\" i.e. the Abzu (JCS 21 3:2-3), and is also associated with Eridu (CT 18 29 ii 26 [group voc.], cf. CAD D 47b). Hence, the same irony applies to both the Abzu and Duku, both of which are described as the origins of fertility (both agricultural and animal) and as the birthplace of demons. 772 It is difficult to distinguish precisely between sipa and udul (UHF 773); cf. zi dnin-dara udul ab-lu-lu-u-a he-pi (CT 16 13:40), which is quoted in a medical commentary as zi dnin-dar-a sipa ab-lu-lu-u-a he-pa (Civil JNES 33 332:22). 775-776 These lines have close parallels in bilingual texts: ki-sikil ama-a-ni-ta ba-ra- ell-dd // ardatu ina maitakiia uiellg \"they remove the maiden from her chamber\" (CT 16 9 i 26), and di4-di4!-la KI-E-NE-Dl-ta nam-ma-ra-ab-2-dB en // sehriitu aiar mFlulri lii tuie;;ci \"do not remove the young from the playground\" (Smith Misc. Assyr. Texts 24:24 [Nergal hymn]). In both instances, el 1 (// SulQ) and 2 (SujG) correspond to ra in our text, which raises the question whether the verbal root ra used together with postposition -ta could indicate \"remove\", literally \"to strike away/off' the playground, battlefield, or bedroom, etc. Cf. Gragg AOATS 5 34, using ra with infix ta for \"motion away\": a he-em-ta-ra-ra \"throw (away) into the water\". For the reading eSemen, cf. Diri IV 272f.

The solution proposed here is that the demons leave the Netherworld and Duku only to reappear (e = apu) in the victim's body. For dU6-ku, cf. Barton MBI No.8 and Chiera SRT No. 25, in which the Duku is described as the home of the Anunna, and the birthplace of Lahar and Asnan (cf. also CT 16 14 iv 30). The Duku also serves as an epithet of the Eridu temple, and a synonym for the Abzu (cf. Malku I 290, Green Eridu 209). Likewise, the kur-idim is translated in Bit Rimki as the sad ncl'gbi \"mountain of the (primordial) source\" i.e. the Abzu (JCS 21 3:2-3), and is also associated with Eridu (CT 1829 ii 26 (group voc.J, cf. CAD D 47b). Hence, the same irony applies to both the Abzu and Duku, both of which are described as the origins offertility (both agricultural and animal) and as the birthplace of demons. 772 It is difficult to distinguish precisely between sip a and udul (UHF 773); cf. zi dnin-dara udul ab-Iu-Iu-u-a he-pa (CT 16 13:40), which is quoted in a medical commentary as zi dnin-dar-a sipa ab-Iu-Iu-u-a he-pa (Civil JNES 33 332:22). 775-776 These lines have close parallels in bilingual texts: ki-sikil ama-a-ni-ta ba-ra-eu-de II ardatu ina mastakisa usellu \"they remove the maiden from her chamber\" (CT 169 i 26), and di4-di4'-1a KI-E-NE-DI-ta nam-ma-ra-ab-e-de-en II ~ehrutu asar melulti Iii tuse~~a \"do not remove the young from the playground\" (Smith Misc. Assyr. Texts 24:24 [Nergal hymn]). In both instances, ell (f / sulU) and e (su~U) correspond to ra in our text, which raises the question whether the verbal root ra used together with postposition -ta could indicate \"remove\", literally \"to strike away/off\" the playground, battlefield, or bedroom, etc. Cf. Gragg AOA TS 5 34, using ra with infix ta for \"motion away\": a he-em-ta-ra-ra \"throw (away) into the water\". For the reading esemen, cf. Diri IV 272f.

The nig-gig, corresponding to marus'tu, may describe this flour as \"unpleasant to the ghost\", in order to discourage the ghost from entering the magic circle. The fuller version of this line occurs in the late duplicate (K 166+), which adds zigig-ba nig-gig dingir-ra-ke4 (qFm kibti ikkib ilcni), which is interpreted in CAD I/J 55b as \"wheat flour is forbidden (as an offering) to gods\".

(II 5), or ikkib(NiG.G~~) diSu ttakal (11 95) is not eating what is taboo to his god but rather \"he who ate what was reserved for hisbd\", or \"sacred in his city\", i.e. he ate food which was already pledged or offered to a deity. Hence, the second type of flour mentioned in the late duplicate, namely flour \"reserved for a god\", is off-limits to the ghost, and again discourages the ghost from entering the magic circle. The reading dib is based upon the Akkadian translation s'u-ti-riql in the late duplicate [K 166+]. The late duplicate can be found in CT 16 37:2-8. It is not possible to be certain whether the rubric in Ms. F (PBS I12 128 ii 1) belongs to this incantation or not, since the first column containing the incantation is completely lost. The incantation can be found in CT 16 37 14ff. The writing Sa Sci in the gloss may be intended for asakku Sa mursa Sa ina gri ikassz2, with only selected words rendered in the gloss, rather than the entire line. Moreover, the gloss ikassli shows that Ms. B interprets the verb la as transitive, i.e. preserving illness in the steppe, whereas late duplicates translate las-a intransitively as ittene'elz? \"wander around\" (CT 16 37: 18- 19). The use of Serzid as an epithet of Enlil seems most inappropriate, since the term traditionally refers to the moon god, just as Akkadian namru or namirtu aptly describe Sin, SamaS, or IStar. Cf. Sjoberg OrS 19-20 146:8, ZA 63-29, and Mondgott 67, for Se-er-zi \"moonlight\" as an epithet of 133 Forerunners to Udug-hul ASimbabbar. Consequently, the original Vorlage for this passage may have cited Enlil, Nanna (Serzida), and Enki as the three gods who joined the Anunna in passing judgement, later changed to the more usual sequence of An, Enlil, and Enki. This hypothetical reconstruction of Enlil, Nanna, and Enki as the three gods intended here would fit well with parallels between Inanna's Descent and Udug-hul, since these three gods were consulted about Inanna's fate in the Netherworld, although the unfavourable judgement of the Anunna was eventually altered by Enki's magical intervention (ID 288-290). Similarly, in this UHF passage the gods pass judgement, allowing the demons to attack, until Asalluhi takes note and secures Enki's magic. 80 1 For Enlilbanda, cf. Tailqvist, StOr 7 303, and Green Eridu 90f. The variant in Ms. C is presumably an error, since Enkibanda is unattested. The important gloss niifiku \"prince\" (cf. CAD N2 282b) refers to Enki, translating the epithet den-lil-ban-da quite. literally: den-lil corresponds to Akkadian illilu \"god of the highest rank\" (CAD I/J 85b), while ban-da is \"younger\", \"of the lesser rank\", as in dam ban-da (cf. CAD S 179bff.). \"Prince\" thus serves as an appropriate epithet for Enki, as \"'junior god of the foremost rank\". Cf. van Dijk MI0 12 62, and CAD D 189a (s.v. duppussz2). 803 The reading of -ba (rather than -zu) is supported by the late duplicate, which has the suffix -bi (cf. CT 16 37:24).

Sjoberg's treatment of ni- teg as \"cool off, refresh\" (related to \"fear\") may not apply to this particular UHF context, since the bilingual evidence assumes ni for ramZnu and teg for tehli (CT 16 37:25). Note in the gloss the use of TA for ta, as in OA writings of this word (cf. AHw 1384f.). Moreover, the translation Znihu \"weary\" for ni-dub is unusual, since the Sumerian equivalent to ~inihu/aniihu is usually kuS-u in bilingual texts, while ni-dub corresponds to tapfuhtu, \"rest\" or nap5Su \"to breathe freely\"; cf. for example, Nabn.

Sjoberg OrS 19-20 146:8, ZA 63-29, and Mondgott 67, for se-er-zi \"moonlight\" as an epithet of 133 801 803 805 807 Forerunners to Udug-hul Asimbabbar. Consequently, the original Vorlage for this passage may have cited Enlil, Nanna (serzida), and Enki as the three gods who joined the Anunna in passing judgement, later changed to the more usual sequence of An, Enlil, and Enki. This hypothetical reconstruction of Enlil, Nanna, and Enki as the three gods intended here would fit well with parallels between Inanna's Descent and Udug-hul, since these three gods were consulted about Inanna's fate in the Netherworld, although the unfavourable judgement of the Anunna was eventually altered by Enki's magical intervention (ID 288-290). Similarly, in this UHF passage the gods pass judgement, allowing the demons to attack, until Asalluhi takes note and secures Enki's magic. For Enlilbanda, cf. Tallqvist, StOr 7303, and Green Eridu 90f. The variant in Ms. C is presumably an error, since Enkibanda is unattested. The important gloss nissfku \"prince\" (cf. CAD N2 282b) refers to Enki, translating the epithet den-Iil-ban-da quite. literally: den-lil corresponds to Akkadian illilu \"god of the highest rank\" (CAD I/J 85b), while ban-da is \"younger\", \"of the lesser rank\", as in dam ban-da (cf. CAD S 179bff.). \"Prince\" thus serves as an appropriate epithet for Enki, as \"junior god of the foremost rank\". Cf. van Dijk MIO 12 62, and CAD D 189a (s.v. duppussU). The reading of -ba (rather than -zu) is supported by the late duplicate, which has the suffix -bi (cf. CT 1637:24). Cf. also UHF 816, the repetition of our line, in which -ba is omitted entirely (not as copied by Lutz PBS I!2 128 ii 22). Cf. Sjoberg TCS 3132, and especially Gud. Cyl. B XIV21-22: e-ki-nu-a ki ni-te-ge26-a-ba nu mu-ni-gub \"in the bedroom, where they withdraw/refresh themselves, he set up a bed\". Sjoberg's treatment ofni-teg as \"cool off, refresh\" (related to \"fear\") may not apply to this particular UHF context, since the bilingual evidence assumes ni for ramiinu and teg for .tehU (CT 16 37:25). Note in the gloss the use ofTAfor ta, as in OA writings of this word (cf. AHw 1384f.). Moreover, the translation iinihu \"weary\" for ni-dub is unusual, since the Sumerian equivalent to iinihu/aniihu is usually kus-u in bilingual texts, while ni-dub corresponds to tapsuhtu, \"rest\" or napiisu \"to breathe freely\"; cf. for example, Nabn. III 66 (MSL 1664): ni-dub-dub-bu = (napii§u) sa miinahti\"to relax from toil\", which has the opposite meaning to iinihu in our line. This line refers back to the Udug, Ala and Asag demons referred to in UHF 797-799, since these demons carry out the divine judgement decided by An, Enlil, and Enki. The gloss is problematical, since su ir-bi-~u may be out of place, and actually refer to the following clause ur-ra mu-ni-in-us, which may be Commentary 132 787 788 789 793 791-794 795 797 799 800 Amore specific ritual instruction is given elsewhere as: a nam-sub ka-zu ba-an-si (j / me sipti ana pika iddi) \"he placed the water of the incantation into your mouth\" (4 R 25 iv 14) the idea being that the incantation is magically dissolved in water, and then administered. Cf. also above, UHF 671-676. For the verbal form u-um-ma-gar-gar (futurum exactum with an ingressive form of the hamtu), cf. above, note to UHF 673. The late duplicates read alternatively su-na or su-bi ha-ba-an-zi-zi, meaning either \"may they depart [intransitive] from his body\", or \"may they remove [transitive] their body\". The nig-gig, corresponding to marustu, may describe this flour as \"unpleasant to the ghost\", in order to discourage the ghost from entering the magic circ!e. The fuHer version of this line occurs in the late duplicate (K 166 + ), which adds zigig-ba nig-gig dingir-ra-ke4 (qem kibti ikkib iläni), which is interpreted in CAD I/J 55b as \"wheat flour is forbidden (as an offering) to gods\". No supporting evidence, however, is available for prohibited grain offering. In Surpu, for instance, the culpable act described as ikkib (NtG.GIG) ilfsu i:kulü (Il 5), or ikkib(NiG.GIG) älisu ftakal (Il 95) is not eating what is taboo to his god but rather \"he who ate what was reserved for hisgod\", or \"sacred in his city\", i.e. he ate food which was already pledged or offered to a deity. Hence, the second type of flour mentioned in the late duplicate, name1y flour \"reserved for a god\", is off-limits to the ghost, and again discourages the ghost from entering the magic circle. The reading dib is based upon the Akkadian translation su-tiJ iq 1 in the late duplicate [K 166 + ]. The late duplicate can be found in CT 16 37:2-8. It is not possible to be certain whether the rubric in Ms. F (PBS 1/2128 ii 1) belongs to this incantation or not, since the first column containing the incantation is completely lost. The incantation can be found in CT 1637 14ff. The writing sa sa in the gloss may be intended for asakku sa mur~a sa ina ~eri ikassu, with only selected words rendered in the gloss, rather than the entire line. Moreover, the gloss ikassu shows that Ms. B interprets the verb Ja as transitive, i.e. preserving illness in the steppe, whereas late duplicates translate las-a intransitively as ittene'elü \"wander around\" (CT 1637:18-19). The use of serzid as an epithet of Enlil seems most inappropriate, since the term traditionally refers to the moon god, just as Akkadian namru or namirtu aptly describe Sin, Samas, or !Star. Cf.

Note in the gloss the use ofTAfor ta, as in OA writings ofthis word (cf. AHw 1384f.). Moreover, the translation änihu \"weary\" for ni-dub is unusual, since the Sumerian equivalent to änihu/anähu is usually kus-u in bilingual texts, while ni-dub corresponds to tapsuhtu, \"rest\" or napiisu \"to breathe freely\"; cf. for example, Nabn. m 66 (MSL 1664): ni-dub-dub-bu = (napäsu) sa mänahti\"to relax from toil\", which has the opposite meaning to änihu in our line.

He should bring out a censer, in which some of their mountain incense is brought, (decorated with) the ibex horn ofthe mountain go at with a wild ox hoof, which has been led out from the corner. He should recite together with this the speIl ofwisdom, the speIl of Ensimah. Then your father, lord ofthe gods, will have removed [the oath]. I am the man of Enki, I am the man of Enlil, I am the man of Lugalurra, I am the man of AsaIluhijEridu. Note that in one of the late manuscripts, Asalluhi's name is omitted. Literally, \"they caused me to purify hirn (the victim)\". For the causative verbal form, cf. Jacobsen AS 16 94. The restoration of [dnin]-mah-e is based upon the late Akkadian translation, be-let DINGIR.MES be-let sa-di-i (unpub. duplicates]. The Akkadian translation in the late duplicates [unpub.] reads r x lori sb ina E mar-~i-ka us-bü \" ... who stayed in the house of your sick person\". The late corresponding sources [unpub.], which resemble Ms. C, differ considerably from Ms. F. here: 135 834 835 837 839 842-843 844 Forerunnersto Udug-hul nig hul-gal-e sil7 igi-mu-ta udug hul a[la hul gidiJm hul gals-Ia hul e-ta ha-ba-ra-e bar-ta-bi-se ha-ba-ra-an-gub-ba u-bi-zi hul-dub zi an-na he-pa zi ki-a he-pa These lines re fleet the stereotyped formulae which occur at the end of incantations, calling upon the demon(s) to stand aside and be adjured by heaven and earth. The fact that the late textual tradition supplies a broadly different formulaic ending from that found in Ms. Fis not surprising, since one formula can replace another; more significant is the fact that Ms. C resembles the late sourees. The incantation is known from unpublished duplicates, which fit CT 1625 111. The late corresponding source [unpub.] reads g[idim hul g]aI5-la hullu-ra gar-ra, for which there is insufficient room in Ms. C. The gloss is theoretically restored after late duplicates [unpub.], which read re l-ltim-mu lJem-nu gal-Iu-li lem-nu s6 a-na LU is-sak-nu. The late source (CT 1625 iii 17) reads sIr-ku-[ga] as a variant for mas-mas-gal, and the identification of the sir-ku(g) as an incantation priest is confirmed by the late duplicate [unpub.], which translates sir-ku-[ga] as [mas-mas-g]al-Iu; cf. also UHF 94. The use ofSir-ku(g) as incantation priest argues for the reading of sir corresponding to Akkadian siptu; cf. CT 16 37:42-43 sir galam-ma sIr densi-mah 11 sipat nikilti sipat dM IN (text cited in note to UHF 819-822 above). The gap can be restored from late duplicates and from ASKT p. 79:26-29 (cf. Reiner Surpu 53:26-29): udug hul a-Ia hul gidim hul gals-la hul dingir hul maskim fhul' sil7 igi-[mu-taJ zi an-na he-pa zi ki-a he.fpa1 IU-U1S-Iu dumu dingir-ra-na ba-r[a-an-te-ge26-deJ an-gin7 he-en-ku-ga ki-gin7 he-en-sikil-la sa-an-gin7 he-en-dadag-ga eme hul-gM bar-se he-em-ta-gub ka-inim-ma [udug hul-a-kamJ \"(Demons) depart [from] before [meJ, be adjured by heaven, be adjured by earth.

May he bepurified like heaven, cleansed like earth, and polished bright like the firmament, so that the evil tongue stands aside.\" The beginning of the incantation is restored from abrief late incantation found in CT 178: 12-21. The remainder ofthe incantation can be found in CT 1625 iv Iff. For kusa-ga-Ia = naruqqu, cf. Hh XI 79 [MSL 9 197], and MSL 7 216:59. Ms. C, however, follows the unusual procedure ofboth translating kusa-ga-la as na-ru-uq, and incorporating a second gloss na-de-e-ka, \"your"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Commentary 13 waterskin\" (cf. CAD N1 100). Although the orthography of nu-de-e-ka with plene e is unexpected, nevertheless the reading of the signs as a gloss [Jacobsen's suggestion] is attractive, since nadu corresponds to ~~S~-EDIN- la, which is similar to the kuia-ga-la. It is conceivable that the scribe of Ms.G copied the standard translation of kusa-g8-la as naruqqu, but inserted an alternative translation of nadu. As for the use of the kuia-ga-18 in our context, it is noteworthy that the leather bag is employed in conjunction with the Suku (food)-offering. Hg A [MSL 7 1491 148-154 lists various types of pouches, for gold, silver, salt, alkali, or a stylus, so that similarly the kuia- ga-la may have contained herbs or spices which were pleasing to the spirit or demon, and thus appeased him.

The verbal root may be hypothetically restored as [bal-bal-e] after the Akkadian gloss e-te-bi-i[r], since bal corresponds to eb2ru in a similar passage: lipiS a-ab-ha-ke4 ba-ra-an-da- bal-e // ina qereb tcimtim lZ tebbirfu (UHF 294 = CT 16 10 iv 18-19). The gloss has omitted ekeppi, and should be reconstructed as kima eleppi itebir, \"crossed over like a ship\". 860 The gloss is problematical, since the late duplicate reads u-far-lpa-du] (cf. CT 16 27331, i.e. the k?a demon causes the victim to \"wander about\", like in a dream. In Ms. C, however, the gloss is divided between two lines on the tablet, leaving insufficient room to restore [ti-Sar-pa]-du, as well as leaving NIN unexplained. The solution adopted here, therefore, is to assume that the scribe split the word nen-[mu]-du in an unorthodox fashion between two lines, with the gloss meaning \"afflicted (as in) a dream\". 862 The Iate duplicates (cf.

The late duplicates are fragmentary, allowing only for the restoration 01' gin? and he(-me-en) with certainty. The verbal root rnay be hypothetically restored as [bal-bal-e] after the Akkadian gloss e-te-bi-i[r], since baI corresponds to eberu in a similar passage: lipis a-ab-ba-ke4 ba-ra-an-da-bal-e // ina qereb tamtim lä tebbirsu (UHF 294 = CT 16 10 iv 18-19). The gloss has omitted eleppi, and should be reconstructed as klma eleppi ftebir, \"crossed over like a ship\". The gloss is problematical, since the la te duplicate reads u-sar-[pa-du] (cf. CT 1627:33), i.e. the Ala demon causes the victim to \"wander about\", like in a dream. In Ms. C, however, the gloss is divided between two lines on the tablet, leaving insufficient room to restore [u-sar-pa]-du, as weIl as leaving NIN unexplained. The solution adopted here, therefore, is to assurne that the scribe split the word nen-[mu]-du in an unorthodox fashion between two lines, with the gloss meaning \"afflicted (as in) a dream\". The late duplicates (cf. CT 1628:36) are restored in CAD 1/J 60b as la-la hul musen-ge6-a-gin?]. Note, however, that UHF reads igi kukku-[ga] instead of ki kukku-ga (jj asar ikleti) of the late sources. The appearance of e-ba-al in the gloss (versus katimti in the late text, CT 16 28:39), corresponding to sa-dul, is a rare attestation of ebelu/habälu (C), \"to"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Commentary 138 ensnare (in a net)\"; cf. AHw 18 1 b, 302b, and CAB E 8a, H 7a. The difficulty is its use in the construct state. 864 The gloss seems to have an erased i- followed by u-sa-ha-pu (or possibly is- sa-ha-pu), corresponding to i-sah-ha-pu in CT 16 28:41. 866 Although corresponding late sources have variants du-du, du7-du7, and dug-dug for the verbal form (cf. CT 16 28:44), the lexical lists give ~U~(BUR) as the authentic root (cf. MSL 14 501:163, and CAD D 58a citing Diri and Antagal), in contrast to other bilingual texts which employ drilu to translate either di-di or du-du. 867 For the reading Sim-mu, cf. the note to UHF 93 above. The gloss appears to be more literal than the translation of late sources, which read Zipu 5angammdhu mullil par~i Sa Eridu andku (cf. CT 16 28:47). 868 The evidence for the pronunciation of IGI.DU comes from Proto-Diri and Diri (cited CAD A1 344f., A2416, I/J 43b), which read IGI-DU phonetically as i-gi-i5-tu, a-Sa-ri-id, ma-ah-ra, and pa-li-il. Of the lexical equations, the latter three can be identified as Akkadian loanwords from aiaredu, mahru, and palilu, whereas only the first entry, igeStu, can be identified in other lexical lists: cf. Emesal Voc. I1 24 (MSL 4 14): i-[bli-eS-du KGI.DU = a-lik mah-ra, or Sb Voc. I 360 (MSL 3 127): ge-eS- tu = a-ia-re-du, which would fit well with an etymology of /igi-Sk-du/, \"going towards the face/front3'. The difficulty in our text is the -ra which resumes IGI.Du in UHF and all later corresponding duplicates (cf. CT 16 28:48), which might indicate in this instance a resumptive jr], i.e. igeStu(r), or a phonetic complement, i.e. rnahrara. The absence of corroborative evidence compels us to leave the matter undecided. 869 The restoration [didim] is based upon spacing, since there is insufficient room to accomodate [den-ki-ke4] (cf.

Alternatively, one might restore the gloss as [ana har-ba]-a-tim, which also corresponds to Sumerian a-ri-a, as in UHF 877 (= CT 16 29:98-99) a-ri-a I/ harbu. Restored after CT 162996-100. This rubric indicates that Ms. C, like other UHF sourees, does not represent an extract of an Udug-hul series, and hence most probably antedates the compilation ofthese incantation into the unified composition known as Utukkü Lemnütu."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Appendix Appendix Ni [. .......... .] dim-ma [. .......... .] su?-ra .........
