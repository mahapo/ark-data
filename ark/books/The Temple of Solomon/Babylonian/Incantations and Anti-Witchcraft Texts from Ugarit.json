Therefore ithas seemed suitable to present them together in order to enhance the signifi-cance of this type of magic literature at Ugarit, a literature so overwhelminglypresent in the Mesopotamian world. The dependence of the Ugaritic texts onthis literature is clear in many a respect, but even so clearly differentiatingfeatures are evident.2A series of contrasted digital photographs have been provided in orderto facilitate the epigraphic control of those sometimes badly damaged andfragmentary texts. The photographs of Ugaritic texts were taken in the Damas-cus National Museum on the first days of March 2011 by professional photogra-phers (Mr Fansa Saad and Mr Dibbo ed-Dibbo) under the author’s personalsupervision, who took advantage of this opportunity to collate the controver-sial readings. The quality of these photographs means that hand-copies of thetexts are unnecessary. Nevertheless, they have been included, and were madeby my friend and colleague at the I.P.O.A., Prof. Lluis Feliu, an Assyriologistwho has experience in copying Sumero-Akkadian texts. His copies are far bet-ter than mine. To him I express my sincere thanks. In contrast, no hand-copiesof the Akkadian texts are provided, since the present circumstances do notallow a personal collation of the tablets and the photographs are not satisfac-tory enough for this purpose.3The reader can use to the hand-copies providedby Nougayrol and Arnaud in their text editions.The aim of this presentation is to provide a kind of monograph or hand-book of the Ugaritic ritual magic incantations against impending dangers1See “Bibliography” for details. All these studies, except that of KTU 1.178 [RS 92.2014], werealready dealt with inCanaanite Religion(1999/2004); this treatment has now been supersededby this new analysis that will be summarized in the forthcoming third edition of this work.2The term “conjuration” has been avoided in this context, since in English it seems to havea connotation of “summoning up a ghost”; see in this regard Scurlock, J. 1999:77, n. 49.Instead, Spanish “conjuro” corresponds to English “incantation”, as does German “Beschwö-rung”.3The photographs of all the Akkadian texts were provided by the “Maison de l’Orient” (Lyon)and also by the Damascus Museum. However, those of tablets RS 94.2178 and 94.2964 are notpublished, respecting in this way the priory right of the forthcoming official edition of thecomplete set of Akkadian tablets from the RS seasons 1994–2002."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"viPrologue(mainly snakebite) and anti-witchcraft texts, placing all of them in the generalcontext of ancient Near Eastern magic literature. As an illustrative supplement,some additional articles and philological notes have also been provided, thatdeal with aspects approaching those touched in the texts analysed. On thecontrary, the presentation of the divinatory and prophylactic texts, like KTU1.114, has not been included, since they have all already been dealt with inCanaanite Religion according to the liturgical texts of Ugarit4and nothing sig-nificantly new is available.As for the Akkadian incantation texts from Ugarit, I completely agree withClemens’ critical assessment of the “irrelevance” and “neglect” these haveexperienced among the scholars who have dealt with this kind of literature.5I have always been in favour of looking at Akkadian prototypes to obtain areliable understanding of the genre and my interpretation of KTU 1.96, putforward in 1992, is a good example of this.6It is true that I have never dealtwith those texts nor have included them in the corresponding section ofCanaanite Religion, as this work was limited to the consonantal texts. Never-theless, I took into account, somewhat intensively, the most important of themin the latest revision of KTU 1.96.7Consequently, I decided to complement the studies on the incantationtexts in alphabetic Ugaritic with those in Akkadian as well, in an attempt togive a provisional response to Clemens’ complaint:no comprehensive study of the incantations discovered at Ras Shamra exists, althoughthey represent with the letters and legal documents one of the most readily comparablegenres for which publications exist in both languages. Thus, the issue of the relationshipbetween the Ug. and Ug.-Akk. documents of this genre has scarcely arisen. Due to thecontent of incantations, typically including both mythological and ritual material in vary-ing proportions, the exact extent and composition of the Ug. incantation corpus has neverbeen defined rigorously, which represents one precondition for such a comparison; asa result, studies of such texts tend to be selective and to distribute them in differentpublications.8For the reading and interpretation of these texts, which is not directly withinmy competence,9I initially made use of the new edition (transcription, transla-4See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:290–304 (“Religion and Magic”).5See Clemens, D.M. 2001:577–605.6On the presence of the Mesopotamian tradition in the Ugaritic incantation texts see Clem-ens, D.M. 2001:731, 746–747.7See Del Olmo Lete, G, 2010a.8See Clemens, D.M. 2001:597–598, 1114ff.9After following an Akkadian introductory course given by Prof. Karlheinz Deller (Rome,1964), my personal study of the Akkadian grammar and syllabary allows me to read transliter-ated texts and to check the various values of the cuneiform signs."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Prologueviition, commentary and hand copy) of the main Ug.-Akk. incantation texts (fif-teen in number) published by D.

But besides that, I could not do withouttaking a fresh look at these texts on the basis of the new set of photographskindly put at our disposal by Dr Valérie Matoïan, Director of theMaison del’Orient et de la Méditerranée(Mission de Ras Shamra-Ougarit) (texts from the“La Maison d’Ourtenu”) and by Mme Muyassar Fattal Yabrudi, chief curatorof the epigraphic archives of the Damascus Museum (the rest of the texts),since direct collation of the tablets is out of the question at the moment. Thetask (first-hand transcription and translation with philological commentary)was carried out by my friend and colleague Ignacio Márquez Rowe, researcherin the Ancient Near East division of the CCHS/CSIC (Madrid), an internation-ally recognised expert in the Akkadian of Ugarit. Starting from his translationand transliteration, the content of the texts was set in the general perspectiveof the Ugaritic incantation texts and practice.In this connection, one thing becomes apparent: in spite of the manifoldcorrelations and lexical loans, the two sets of texts maintain a clear-cut inde-pendent structure and set of mythological motifs, as well as their own panthe-ons. We have not come across any Ugaritic consonantal text that could betaken as a translation from a known Akkadian prototype. In this connection,the role that these Akkadian texts could have played in Ugaritic religiouspraxis (as was the case of the ritual texts in Hurrian) remains a debatableissue.11In any case, it is hoped that the combined presentation of all these textsin this monograph will be useful for those interested in the subject.I do not want to close these introductory remarks without expressing onceagain my deepest gratitude to my above-mentioned friends, Mme Yabroudi,Dr Matoïan, Dr Márquez Rowe and Prof. Lluis Feliu, for their invaluable helpin the completion of this work.

According to the nature of the effect produced, an initial globaldistinction should be made between: witchcraft or so-called “black magic”,sorcery (kispū; Sp. “brujería”), and “white magic” (āšipūtu; Sp. “magia”), con-sequently between the sorcerer/witch and the magician, according to the mod-ern anthropological pattern. With the first sort of agent collaborate the “evilspirits”, who cannot be either prayed to or appeased; with the second, “somegods”, specialised in this kind of situation. This antagonistic rivalry sets openthe primordial ambiguity of the “supernatural” world with two opposed“divine” systems of forces at work.3The “evil spirits” andgeniiare divine byorigin, what means that have been “created” by the supreme creator god andare under his control, but nevertheless are “evil” and harmful by nature andactivity, which they carry out in an autonomous way. This antinomy reflectsthe basic experience of human world and the unavoidable aim to overcome it.On the other hand, one must bear in mind that the domain of “magic” inMesopotamia, as we will see, has an enormous number of texts that is missingfrom Ugarit, in both absolute and relative terms. Moreover, Mesopotamianmagic has a mythico-cosmological conceptual foundation apparently absent1See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:1ff.2For a detailed analysis of the terminology in this connection (ēpišu/ēpištu, bēl/bēlet dabābi;ipšū/upšāššû, ruḫû/rusû, etc), as well as with the various kinds of witchcraft (zikurudû,kadabbedû, dibalû, zīru, rāmu, ušburruda, ... and the corresponding anti-witchcraftnamburbirituals and amulets, anti-ghost rituals and rituals for soothing the anger of the gods, etc.) seeAbusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:2–5, also 11, 14–16, 17–20; for multiple agents of witchcraftsee Schwemer, D. 2007:76, 82f., 204, 249–250, 277–278.

Consequently the theistic and holistic spheresare not so clearly distinguished and the intervention of the concomitant agents(geniiand demons) is very much restricted, although not altogether absent (ltnand company,yṭpn, ảklm/ġzzm, ḥby(?), ...).5Demons or evil spirits (e.g.lamaštu; the “seven Demons”)6act on theirown or collaborate with warlocks/wizards and witches in carrying out the evil“machinations” (upšāššû) that affect their, in principle, innocent victims, ashas been pointed out. Also to counteract such effects there are specific deities.Leaving aside the supreme god (Anu), from whom this twofold system of forcescomes and who is thought to control them, the fight against witchcraft (actu-ally taken very seriously as an objective cosmic system of forces) is considereda question of “knowledge”7and consequently placed under the patronage ofthe god of wisdom, Ea-Enki. This god, in turn, delegates this function to hisepicene son/daughterAsalluḫi, a deity who has his epiphany in theedin, thesteppe (see RS 17.155:rev.14’)8, the proverbial habitat of demons and evil spirits.These deities are in possession of the effective incantation formulae that theytransfer to theāšipu, the recitation of which is an essential part of the ritualperformed to break free from witchcraft attacks. The father-son relationship inthis connection gives way to a topical dialogue in whichAsalluḫiresorts toEnki, asking him to bestow the requisiteknowledgeto solve a difficult effectof witchcraft. The answer is invariably that he has already communicated tohis son everything that he knows, so thatAsalluḫiis able to carry out therequired ritual and pronounce the suitable incantation formula.9This is some-times expressly defined as “divine”, the property of such and such god, towarrant its efficacy. Another very significant deity in this context isŠamaš,also a wisdom deity, the supreme judge from whose sight nothing escapes. He4See in this respect the illuminating paper by Binsbergen, W. van, F. Wiggermann. 1999, inparticular pp. 21–23 and 28 for a very well set out summary articulating all these elements.Witchcraft may interfere by changing thešỉmtuof a person by way of a bad “omen”; seeAbusch. Tz., Schwemer, D., 2011:7. In this connection, the treatment by Schmitt, R. 2004:80–83, must be taken with caution.5See below pp. 205ff. on the coordination of the two systems at work in Ugarit according toKTU 1.100 and 1.107.6See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:6; Geller, M.

Such texts are most often called “incantation texts”, bearing in mindthat “incantation” (én,šiptu) properly refers to the “magical formula” theyinclude, the recitation of which brings about the magician’s victory over thesorcerer/witch.12The classification of a text as anincantationis determined bya series of parameters present in these texts clearly singled out as such andthat consequently may be taken as prototypes of the “genre”.13The most con-spicuous examples in this regard can be found in large collections such asMaqlû(“burning”, to destroy) andŠurpu(“burning”, to purify)14along withthe moderncorporaof such texts.15The following parameters seem to be deci-sive. First of all, the mention of thedivine agent, who is asked to intervene10See in this regard Maul, St.M. 1999:124, 129; Finkel, I.L. 1999:220–222: “Gula, ‘you are aphysician, an omen expert, a healer o Gula!”; also the ancestors (ilī bītim) can be involved;see Van der Toorn, K. 1999:145f. In the anti-witchcraft performance “the personal god” was tohave a special role; see later. For a reconstructed staging of such a performance see Abusch,Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:1–2.11See in this connection the splendid explanation by Van Binsbergen, W., Wiggermann, F.1999:1–34.12We speak then of “incantation” in the case of magic texts containing a formula, more orless well defined, against an aggression caused by a unjust agent; otherwise it is “therapeuticmagic” for an illness that has not been maliciously induced. Then there will normally be aprescription without a formula, although trust in its “magic” efficacy will be also present. Seein this regard Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:22.13For a detailed structural analysis of the incantation texts see Cunningham, G. 1999:7; for“The formation of the Some Witchcraft Incantations” see Abusch, Ts. 2002:197ff.14See Reiner, E. 1970:2–3; Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:6.15ForMaqlûsee the standard edition by Meier, G. 1967 and the critical study by Abusch, Tz.2002:99–292 (Part II/III: The Nature and History ofMaqlû/ Meaning: The Religious and Intel-lectual Setting ofMaqlû).

This god must also be appeased, sincehe may be hostile and the main agent of the evil suffered, inflicted either asa punishment for sin or merely by a random decision.16Consequently, witch-craft, originally autonomous, becomes incorporated into the world of religion.Mention of this god gives way tomythological developmentsor the commemo-ration of the exploits and power of the deity. This is an almost unavoidablemotif, present in the incantation texts, making them into polemical texts,opening up the primordial or cosmic antagonism that opposes the forces ofgood and evil, in a confrontation that involves the gods. Thehuman protago-nists, the exorcist and the victim, instead, may be anonymous, but even soalways taken for granted. They are the ones who will recite the incantation.17In turn, the patient will count on the assistance of thepatron gods of magic,mentioned above, sometimes implicitly. Therefore, the presence ofprayer18and invocation of that deity (in opening or closing hymnic sections) will betypical in such texts. But above all, the mention of the counterpart orantago-nistof the divine agent mentioned, the evildoer, thesorcereror more fre-quently thewitch, the actual agent ofblack magic,19will be as significant asthat of the divine agents in defining the text as “incantation”. The witch caninflict any kind of suffering on her victim by means of any kind ofipšū/upīšū/upšāššûsorceries and machinations. Also, by stirring up the anger of his per-sonal god against him, above all by means of unjust accusations and slandersthat deprives him of divine favour.20Thedescription of the evilto be overcome,the actualeffectscaused by the intervention of the evildoer, as well as adescription of its immediate cause (snakebite, illness, but also “curse” and16See Cunningham 1997:3 andpassim.

Schwemer, D. 1999:6–7, considers the designation “black/white magic” as inappropriate for Ancient Mesopotamia. In general, such designation hasbecome obsolete among the scholars.20See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:7, 21. andinfrapp. 183f."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"“Incantation”: a definition5bad “omen”),21may accompany the textualformula, the actual “incantation”,the recitation of which will ensure the solution of the problem. The formulawill be accompanied by theritualor prophylactic action, the moment for theasûto act.22Consequently, combined anti-witchcraft activity by theāšipuandasûbecame a ritually recognised and legitimate form of dealing with a wide-spread belief fully incorporated in the accepted religious and mythical ideol-ogy, thus avoiding adjudication on an illegal activity that would be very diffi-cult to prove in a court of law. These parameters are very clear inMesopotamian literature, where this kind of text is prominent. There thesequence of these parameters is quite fixed and includes also, as a very impor-tant element, thediagnosisby theāšipuof the impending evil and its causes.In fact, it is the diagnosis23that gives way to the incantation formula, also thetask of theāsipuor magician, who has received it from the patron gods ofmagic. On the contrary, in the meagre set of Ugaritic texts at our disposal,these parameters are all jumbled together.24We can arrange them as follows:GOD(S)↓↑sorcerer (kaššāpu/kaššaptu) → ← magician (āšipu/asû)symptoms → diagnosis → prayers → ← incantation → prescription → ritualThe description of the symptoms affecting a patient usually comes first (?) inMesopotamian anti-witchcraft texts (“If a man ...”). It is followed by the diag-nosis, which repeatedly explains that they are the result of a sorcerer’s inter-vention (“this man is bewitched ...”),25sometimes specifying the kind of blackmagic method used (“he has eaten, drunk ...”).26Ocasionally, divination willbe needed to ascertain the causes.27After having clarified the situation, themagician (āšipu) proceeds to remedy it by invoking the help of the gods, those21See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:6–7, for the various kinds and ways of evil-doing.22See Abusch, Tz. – Schwemer, D. 2011:14.

Several times this invocationor prayer forms part of the actual incantation formula, known only to themagician. The repetition or recitation of this formula will resolve the prob-lem.28Afterwards, the incantation will normally be accompanied by the appli-cation of a remedy, when the role of theasûcomes into play (ingestion ofplants, rubbing with their juice, etc.), and by purification rituals. Frequentlythe performance of certain destructive ritual actions (washing, burning, bury-ing, handling and smashing figurines and amulets, mostly of the witch, etc.:“Bildzauberritual”) takes place a number of times before Šamaš, followed bythe appropriate offering to the gods.29As a consequence, the ritual becomes ameans of combating sorcery. A motif that frequently accompanies these sym-bolic rituals is the prayer for turning the sorcery back onto the sorcerer/witchas a punishment.30Still under the “magic” intervention of the gods the “sor-cery” may suffer itself the intended harm. As for the systematic differentiationof those moments in the structure of the incantation texts, it is worthwhilementioning the separation of the two moments – word and gesture, formulaand ritual – that is applied in theMaqlûcollection: the first eight tabletsinclude the incantations with all the textual elements that surround them,while the rituals are collected together in the ninth tablet, usingincipitstorefer to the corresponding incantation formula.31Therefore, the identification of an incantation text in Akkadian presentsno problems, especially as we have well-known collections of such texts. Theyare also to be found in the periphery: in Ebla32, in Emar33, and even in Ugarit34.We can even advance a definition centered on therecitativepart as its moredecisive element, which sets the whole process in motion, the aim of the divinestory on which the efficacy of the remedy depends. An “incantation is a for-mula of 1) divine origin, known only to the gods and revealed by them, effec-tive against 2) an evil inflicted on or incurred by an individual, resulting in 3)the destruction of that evil and of the evildoer (or the absolution of the sin28See Abusch, Tz. 2002: 5ff.

Normally in the half-dozen Ugaritic consonantal texts that we taketo be incantations proper, the elements quoted appear mixed up and some-times are merely hinted at. KTU 1.178, for instance, begins by singling out theritualised action, while in KTU 1.100 the application to the gods occupies themain position along with the search for the actual formula and remedy. Bothelements are largely dramatised at the end of this prototypical text. On theother hand, in KTU 1.96 the agent and effect are identified and their descrip-tion is embedded within the formula in such a way that the whole text hasbecome an incantation formula. In the compilation texts KTU 1.107 and 1.169,this mixture is even more conspicuous.3 The structure and division(s) of the genreTemporality is the parameter that makes human existence so fragile and soexposed to any kind of danger. The present is the victim of the revealedpresent-past and is threatened at the same time by the opaque future, the onetoo obvious and the other too obscure. Faced with this situation, gods andmen alike have recourse to a force that shows itself able to undo the past andilluminate the future: magic. It always presupposes theactiveinterventionof man and is in principle effective by itself and consequently “atheistic”,independent of the will and power of the gods, who can also neverthelessaccess and control it, at least some of them: the gods of magic.Toilluminate the futureand to foresee its threatening calamities, man haslearned to read certain signs or omens (Sp. “agüero, presagio”) that in thecourse of time have proved themselves trustworthy in this respect. This read-ing is the outcome of a long apprenticeship and training, transferred anddeveloped from generation to generation. This is the field ofprospective magic35For the standard sequence of these motifs see Cunningham, G. 1997:1–4, repeated after-wards with each diachronical series. However, his definition of incantation is somewhatgeneric and circular: “By incantation is meant any text with an opening formula, closingformula or subscript containing terms which we translate as incantation and any text of simi-lar content” (p. 4).

Consequently, the fight against sorcerybecomes a sort of judicial process before the gods, with Šamaš as the main agent, in whichthe cause is revised, the victim’s innocence proclaimed and the witch’s malefic sorcerousintervention, through which she has subjugated gods and demons to her evil purpose, dis-solved. Once deprived of the personal god’s protection, the individual is an easy victim ofwitchcraft. In any case, the anger of Yahweh and of the Greek gods is a well known topic.

In fact, its agents will make use of the same procedures. Thesemay consist, in the case of the warlock/witch, in “actions” of many kinds, butalso in evil “words” (eme-ḫul // ka-ḫul,lišānu lemuttu/pî lemuttu) and“sight” (igi-ḫul,īnu lemuttu)55. This situation therefore will oppose twokinds of agent in possession of such a force: the sorcerer/witch (kaššāpu/kaššaptu...), the agent of “black magic” and the magician (āšipu, asû), theagent of “white magic”, as was pointed out above.The sorcerer and above all his feminine counterpart, the witch, will bringabout calamities on their fellow men out of unjustified bad will and hate bymeans of mimetic acts of contact (touching, feeding, giving to drink ...) anddistant actions (sending out effects, modelling figurines56of the victim ...),basically transfer actions; also by words, both direct (incantation and spell)and indirect (slander, libel), or by the power of sight (the evil eye)57. Thesemalicious interventions will let loose the pernicious agents that will hurt thevictim. In the first place, sicknesses of many types, clearly classified, andwhose origin is often expressly declared to be witchcraft/sorcery (“If the manhas those symptoms ... this man is bewitched”). Natural phenomena can alsobe induced by witchcraft. But there is a special evil that, due to the ecologicalconditions of ancient Near Eastern society and the peculiar symbolic weightinvolved, occurs frequently in the magic literature and even generates a pecu-liar kind of magic with its own agent (mušlaḫḫu), namely, serpents attackingand biting.The magician will fight against those evils and evildoers, always backedby the power of the gods, recorded and invoked, first by the diagnosis of thesituation and of its cause. Afterwards, by seeking to neutralise it by thedestruction of the cause. In the first place, by pronouncing the incantationformula that will be a vehicle for the divine magical power; a formula onlyknown to the gods, who will reveal it to the magician. The primary effect of54See Abusch, Tz. 1999:14ff.; 23ff.; and, in general, Van Binsbergen, W., Wiggermann, F.1999, an excellent description of the conflict of cosmic forces implied in witchcraft, as statedabove.55On these last sorcerous devices see Cunningham, Gr. 1997:104–105, 129, 140, 146, 172, 177f;Schwemer, D. 2011:6, 67f.; Abusch, Tz. 1999:56ff.; Thomsen M.L. 1992:12 andpassim; Schmitt,R. 2004:137ff., 145ff.56See e.g. Schwemer 2007:113.

In this regard, the modellingof figurines of the witch, as already pointed out, and their rough handling arequite normal, as it was also a normal means of inducing sorcery by the handsof its agent.Centuries of empirical experience have also taught the magician, in thecase of sickness, to complement the word with a gesture and to combine theincantation formula with the application of a remedy. These remedies mainlycomprise a blend of medicinal plants, minerals and sometimes animal ingredi-ents, whose efficacy comes also from divine knowledge and revelation andforms part of the magical technique, this time commended to a specialist magi-cian, theasû. This combination of magic and experience in dealing withhuman bodily processes was to last many centuries before they were emanci-pated from each other and it demonstrates the invasive character of religionat this stage of human history.59As a consequenec, magical intervention wasto end with a sacred ritual of some kind mainly, offerings.This last point bring us to ascertain the opposite movement: just as ritualmakes itself present in magic, magic also enters the cultic sphere. We havethen to take into accountcultic magicand the presence in the cult of ritualactions with a clear magical structure and content. In fact, it is almost impossi-ble to separate magic from cult as common and normal expressions of religion.The same supreme act of cultic religion, sacrifice, contains and has as itsobjective a magical bias. Nevertheless, from the social and literary point ofview, a fairly clear separating line can be drawn.4 Towards a differentiation between magic and cultMagic and sorcery are by definitionparticularin their addressees, they concernthe individual and his or her own problems.

Of course, theindividual can apply also in it to the gods, but then are prayer and privateoffering the normal access way. Naturally the king will be the first individualto take benefit from this magic praxis and to be protected by and against it.In fact there is a progressive political appropriation of this kind of literatureto benefit of the palace.Magic and sorcery areconcretein the kind of evil they face or cause, aboveall sickness of any sort, but also attacks by animals (scorpions and snakes),slander by a fellow evildoer, etc. In the cult, rituals aim normally at the over-coming of public andgeneral calamities, above those affecting fertility andhealth, such as drought, pestilence and so on.In these rituals the mythical scenery is normally the primordial fightbetween the gods of life against the god of death. These can also be called“demons”, but of a higher rank than the maleficgeniiof sorcery. In magictexts also the invocation and recalling of the gods’ power and primordialexploits are present as their starting point, but usually in aconciseand allusiveway. On the contrary in cultic rituals the whole mythology of primordial con-flicts is developed as to take the larger part of the text. Normally there is notincantation formulas in these stories, recitation of the myths taking its place,being the incantation included in the closing description of the cultic ritual.61Magic and sorcery are by definitionsecular. They take place outside thesacred place, the temple, normally in the victim’s house or in the “steppe”,62while the cult cannot be developed outside the sanctuary, a place divinelychosen and defined. Nevertheless, as we will see later on, magic cannot oper-ate only in a strict profane or secular sphere according to our own moderncategories. In this regard, Cunningham is right when he say that incantations“complement temples as the primary place of mediation between the humanand the divine”.63In this connection, Saul consulting the dead through thesoothsayer or necromancer of Endor (1Sam 28:7ff.) and David consulting hisgod through the’ēfōdhandled by the priest (1Sam 23:9ff.) illustrate the differ-ence of the two mediation practices, magic and cult, as far as place and meansgo. In this regard, Ugaritic magic seems to be completely profane or secular,unconnected with the cult, except for the possible mention of prospective sac-rifices.60On the “nature” of this “god” see Abusch, Tz. 2002:48–49.61See Graf, F. 2001.62See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:21f.63See Cunningham, Gr. 1997: 4."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Towards a differentiation between magic and cult13Magic and sorcery are by definitionatemporal, depending basically on thepersonal vicissitudes of the individual,64while the cult is intrinsically regu-lated by a calendar that must be followed inflexibly. Outsidefeaststhe godsdo not receive the folk in their presence. Place and time are untouchable coor-dinates of the sacred. Even the rituals pertaining to life-cycle events (birth,wedding, death ...) have their own intrinsic conditioning as far as time andspace are concerned.Magic and sorcery are free andspontaneous. In principle anybody canbecome a sorcerer and a magician and the practices to be applied are plentifuland freely available. Instead, the cult is strictly regulated, the rituals are fixedand well defined, the priestly officiants are established in their office by strictrules of genealogy, gender and ethnic affiliation. Whereas priestesses are theexception in the cult, in sorcery witches are the norm.Finally, in the cult the supremepower of the deityis celebrated andinvoked, so thatmagic power, a force that appearsindependentand oftenbeyond the reach of the gods, cannot be brought into competition with it.Also, cultic rituals exhibit an automatism bordering on magic. We can say thatmagic has crept into the cult or that it has been ritualised, so as to remainunder the control of the deity. Remember the god’s consulting and the divina-tion practices carried out in the sanctuary and under the control of the priests.Divine blessing or curse, divine pardon65or punishment all depend normallyon ethical behaviour or from the completion of cultic duties. But cultic ritualshave assumed an infallible efficacy, provided that the actions are carried outaccording to the norms, bringing them very close to magic. But this efficacydepends intrinsically from the spiritual stance of the faithful, on his gooddisposition to follow and obey the claims of the divinity.66That is what distin-guishes magic from sacrament. But also what dangerously make them closeto each other.67Magic, on the contrary, and black magic obviously, is function-allynon-theisticin some sense and amoral, if not immoral. It operates outside64See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:21.65See Thomsen. M. L. 1992:6. The world is surrounded by evil from which the gods provideprotection, provided sin is not present. The sorcerer/witch activates this evil, alienating divinehelp. Abusch, Tz. 1999:89–91. “Curse” appears to be the most elementary, formulaic, auto-matic and so magical, form of unleashing evil on someone, pronounced by the gods, thesorcerer and persons with power. Its opposite is “blessing”. As fixed formulae, they may beconsidered germinal “incantations”; see Clemens, D.M. 2001:677ff. (KTU 1.16 VI 54–58; RS16.238: 18–22); Schmitt, R. 2004:123ff.66See Cunningham, Gr. 1997: 44ff. andpassim.67In this connection, Cunningham, Gr. 1997:181, recalls that the Catholic Church includes“exorcism” among her rites and the “exorcist” among her “ministers”, although they are"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"14Introduction: Magic and Witchcraftthe field of ethics. Only in case of a harmful effect produced by “the owngod’s anger” is the personal responsibility called in cause and we will havethe opportunity to meet such situation. But this moralised magic probablyrepresents a late and syncretistic evolution stage that unites two differentlevels of religious behaviour.68We assume, then, the existence ofcultic magicwith many different rituals,but it must be clearly differentiated from the actual practice of magic.5 Magic and MedicineThe intrusion of magic is also evident in the province of medicine. We can saythat, from its very beginning, the practice of ancient medicine incorporatedmagical elements, and perhaps originally was purely magical, both sorcererand magician having the same sphere of action.69Sickness was a question ofspirits/demons,70powerful entities that could be overcome only by means ofmagical procedures. In Ugarit, this is evident in the report concerning thehealing of king Kirta by the supreme godˀIlu(see later). But even from verythe earliest times, man learned to deal with illness by means of empiricalremedies taken from the plant realm. In this regard, we see how the ritual thatcloses most magical texts combines both elements: incantation and empiricalremedy, very often said to be the fruit of secret, divine knowledge. Therefore,we find human agents of magic working together in this connection: theāšipuand theasû.71We can even establish at Ugarit, as was the case also in Mesopo-tamia, a clear evolution of the genre through a sequence of four texts: KTU1.16 V 25ff. (divine healing ofKirta, infrap. 18ff.), KTU 1.178 (magical incanta-tion against snakebite,infrap. 175ff.), KTU 1.114 (empirical prescription for acure of the effects of drunkenness, divinely guaranteed,infrap. 95ff.) and“minor” ones, thus assuming the autonomous existence of an evil “demonic” force able tooperate as an agent of sorcery. That is however under her divine ministry.68See Cunningham, Gr. 1997:179. In Finkel’s words, quoted by Van Binsbergen, W., Wigger-mann, F. 1999:25, “the great mass of Mesopotamian omen material was basically non-theistic”.The whole of magic in general may be taken as an originally popular non-theistic and amoralactivity, as a challenge to theistic, moral ideology. Later on, it was incorporated into thereligious, even cultic system through the intrusion of the gods of magic. For the possible motifof sorcery in the Ugaritic cult see KTU 1.40:11ff.,infrap. 103ff.69See Abusch, Tz. 2002:84f.70See Cunningham, Gr. 1997:178f. andpassim.71See above."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Magic and Medicine15KTU 4.767 (a simple medical prescription).72From absolute magical predomi-nance to the complete absence of magical elements, through the combinationof both in different degrees of supremacy.One feature of this kind of documentation, in which religion – magic –witchcraft with their respective agents (gods – demons – wizards – magicians)are confused, is its progressive systematisation and standardisation over thecenturies. A codification that first took shape in the various types of compen-dia or miscellaneous tablets,73samples of which have also been found in Ugar-itic, and ended with the great ritual synthesis ofMaqlû. In this composition,magic and anti-witchcraft literature as a whole is transformed into a single,composite ritual ceremony that sanctions and takes over at the same time itspower, introducing it into the official and sacral domain once and for all.74The political and royal significance of the process cannot be ignored.72See McGeough, K.M., Smith.

So the divineand natural system of forces are intimately embedded. The natural order, the cos-mos, comes out of the divine primordial source:ˀIluorganised it by distributing itsambits among his three primordial sons:Môtu, Yammu, Baˁlu. Within these ambitsthe rest of the gods, also sons of the primordial couple, possess their own place,either on earth or above in the sky. Those are the so called astral deities (Sun,Moon, Dawn and Dusk, theKaṯirātuand the “steady Stars” [KTU 1.24:54]). Someof them, above all the Sun (Šapšu), collaborate with the three main deities in main-taining the tripartite cosmos. Thus nature is firm and steady, like the divine orderfrom which it depends. Within this frame, the gods can be prayed to and propiti-ated by sacrifices, and they answer with their “blessing”1, above all in respect offertility,2the ultimate goal of the organised Ugaritic Cosmos.3Three kinds of forcespresent in and controlling the reality emerge from this frame: the forces of nature,the effectiveness of the magic and the power of the gods/devils. This threefold sys-tem of forces woks with complete autonomy, but at the same time show someinterferences. For example, the gods can bestow the blessing of fertility upon theirfaithfuls, but, as we will see later on, in front of an illness all the gods, even thesupreme godˀIlu, may be impotent. On the contrary, there is, like in Mesopotamia,a god of magic capable of overcoming any kind of evil effect. Who is he?a)Kôṯaru, mistaken for a magicianHowever, into this established order, from “outside”, there creeps a new forcebrought by a foreign deity, who is never called a “son ofʔIlu”, although incor-1A blessing may be taken as the first form of a spell or incantation, just as a “curse” is thefirst type of word witchcraft (suprap. 13, n. 65). See in this regard the classical “curse” pro-nounced by KingKirtaon his rebellious son (KTU 1.16 V 54ff.). Contrast this with the “bless-ing” of Jacob by his father Isaac (Gn 27:27ff.) and its automatic and irreversible effect and ingeneral the theme of “blessing” in the biblical history of Israel as well as the significance of thedialectics of “blessing/curse” in deuteronomic theology. On “curses” and “oaths” as “powerfulwords” and their inner force see Clemens, D. 2001:1081ff; see also Kitz, A.M. 2014.2Both the epic legends ofKirtaandDanīˀilu/ˀAqhaturevolve around the king’s fertilityobtained by a divine blessing.3See in this connection De Moor, J.C. 1971; Margalit, B. 1980; Del Olmo Lete, G. 1981:143ff;Sigrist, M. 2010;"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Magic and Myth17porated into the national pantheon of the “seventy sons ofˀAṯiratu” and alwaysready to collaborate with gods and men. He is the godKôṯaru, native to Crete(kptr). He can fabricate infallible weapons (maces and bows), definitive in theenterprises of gods (Baˁlu; KTU 1.2 III 11ff.) and men (ˀAqhatu; KTU 1.17 V 12ff.),weapons coveted even by the gods (ˁAnatu; KTU 1.17 IV 6ff.), as well as gor-geous furniture (KTU 1.4 I 23ff) and palaces for the deities (KTU 1.4 VI 16ff.).But they are always technical achievements to be used by others. It is theirpeculiar design, the know-how to set them up, not the nature of their compo-nents (material for the palace, for the bow) that is unique. This god, then,shows a degree of ability in dealing with empirical “appliances” that is higherthan any other, god or man, for the purpose of facilitating his pupils in theirown enterprises and neutral in regard to their evaluation from any point ofview.Kôṯaruis therefore a god who is highly specialised in the control of instru-mental activities, the “wisest” god in this regard, but fully integrated into thedivine force world, like the Greek god Hephaistos. Sometimes, his activity ispossibly crucial, yet secondary in the tripartite world order. In any case hecannot be assigned to the category of “magic” as its god. He works with hishands (he is thehyn d ḥrš ydm,“Hynthe ambidextrous craftsman” (?)), he doesnot make use either of incantation formulas or of magic tools, plants and soon. He is able to shape infallible weapons (like those forged by Hephaistos forAchilles) and to transform raw materials into beams and bricks. His dealingswithBaˁluabout the building of a window in the design and construction ofhis palace reveal empirical and rational planning rather that a “magic” inter-vention. On the other hand, it is clear from KTU 1.100:45ff. that, like the othergods, he is unable to carry out a magical intervention and to dictate the appro-priate spell if asked to do so. The assimilation ofKôṯaruto the great godEa/Enkiin the Akkadian version of the Ugaritic pantheon (RS 20.24:15;Baˁluisassimilated to an inferior god,Adad) forms part of a formal and artificial literaryparallelism to project their own system of religion into the great and prestigiousMesopotamian system, but not according to the same hierarchy. A simple lookat the positions and roles assigned to each deity in their own respective panthe-ons is enough to show the equivalence to be erroneous.

To overcome certain disfunctions of life, the majorityof the gods, even the great ones, are incapable of resolving the situation, aswe have said and as will be seen in KTU 1.100, discussed below.

Faced withthis situation, the supreme godˀIludecides to intervene, but not through apersonal decision, a “blessing”, that will counteract his wife’s “curse”. Thatwould be ineffectual, as the two divine interventions are on the same level.Therefore, he decides to resort to a new force of a different kind with its ownefficacy, to act as a god of magic. But not by delivering an incantation whoserepetition by the magician would dismiss the incumbent evil. Instead, hedecides take on the latter’s role and perform the ritual normally carried out bythe magician (āsû) in Mesopotamian magic and anti-witchcraft practice. Thisway of acting is unusual in this ambit. In it the god of magic assures the rightprocedure to the human magician, but it is this one who carries it out.Unfortunately, in this case (KTU 1.16 V 30ff.) the text is hopelessly brokenand we cannot completely make out the stepsˀIlufollows in his intervention.But enough of it is preserved to understandˀIlu’s procedure. One thing is clear:ˀIlucannot solve the situation by a personal and independent decision as hedoes when for instance, at the request ofˀAṯiratuand the other gods, he estab-lishesBaˁluas the king of the gods (KTU 1.4 IV 40ff.) or curesKirta’s orDanīˀilu’s lack of descendants, by “blessing” them (KTU 1.14 II 6ff, III 46f.; 1.17I 34ff.:ybrk), in the last case throughBaˁlu’s intercession. Now, it seems, hehas to resort to the well-known magical technique of moulding a figurine. Butcontrary to Mesopotamian usage, the figurine is not a substitute representationeither of the victim or of the witch,8but an animate being,9a sort of Golem,10who will carry out the magical procedure consisting in striking the sick man’shead. In this way, the situation seems quite complicated. It exceeds divine7See above n. 1 and Lewis, Th.L. 2011:207ff. A divine curse is effective in itself and is “magi-cal”, both powers coinciding in this case. Seeinfra Danīˀilu’s curses.8Seesuprap. 6, 10, n. 56.9Note the similarities with the biblical account of Adam’s creation (Gen 2:7). In this narrativethere are many other “magical” motifs (the tree, the snake, the word, knowledge, love ...), butthey are too generic for any conclusion to be drawn.10See Sholem.

This is none other than the godMôtuwho, like a “spirit/demon”, has taken possession of the king, thus providingthe mythological motif that is always present in incantation texts, as we haveseen.11The force of magic, then, is underˀIlu’s control, but at the same timebeyond his personal reach: he performs the act of healing through anotheragent.

This kind ofmagic was accepted (and even developed) by Jewish tradition and is taken forgranted in the whole system of magical procedures absorbed by the Hebrewbible22as prescriptions of a God from whom it is supposed derive its efficacy.Once more the two force systems seem to be combined to some extent: if thegods need to resort to magic to intervene in human affairs/misfortunes, themagician needs divine assistance in order to display his power.In Mesopotamia, also, a spell/incantation23derives its efficacy from thegods of magic who actually “know” and “shape” them: the incantations are“theirs”, not the magician’s. But once the correct formula is handed over, itautomatically takes effect when pronounced by him. It is interesting to men-tion, in this connection, the epithet ofDanˀilu’s daughter,Puġatuthe magi-cian, namelyydʕt hlk kbkbm, “she who knows the course of the stars” (KTU1.19 II 7)24. It anticipates by many centuries the close connection betweenmagic and astrology that was to reach its climax in the Seleucid era. In turn,this has long been an explicit feature of Mesopotamian magic and anti-witch-craft incantation texts. The astral deities, especially Šamaš, preside over themagical rituals and receive the prayers of theāšipu.To put an end to this intervention of the magician, Sheikh/KingDanīˀilu,he utters two more curses/imprecations. These are directed at the eagles whomay intend to disturbˀAqhatu’s sleep (KTU 1.19 III 42–45a) and at the twotowns (KTU 1.19 III 45b–56), apparently the scenes of the crime, and so respon-sible for it (!), although it is plain that the plot came from ˁAnatu.

It is evidently a projection of behaviour in humansphere. Of course, this imprecation is ineffectual: the two invoked deities haveno power in the divine realm. To overcome his godly enemyBaˁluneeds thehelp of the technician god,Kôṯaru, who provides him with the arms suitablefor breaking the equilibrium of forces between the two great gods, once againrecalling Vulcan’s intervention in the Illiad.However, this imprecation formula is not by itself a magic procedure; sim-ply,asinDanīˀilu’s invocation ofBaˁlu’s intervention against the eagles, itrepresents a resource to divine punishing intervention against the evildoers.It participates rather of the nature of a passionateprayer, its efficacy hangingfrom the divine justice and benevolence towards his faithful servant. It men-tions, nevertheless, a God,Ḥôrānu, who will later appear much in contact withthe magic world. And at his side the goddessˁAṯtartuis also invoked, as ifmagic was the affair of a divine couple.27On the contrary, also in the epic Legend ofKirtawe have a good example,although fragmentary, of a magic incantation and ritual against drynessinduced by the king’s illness (KTU 1.16 III 1–4a.), as was the case with theˀAqhatu’s murder. In a context of lamentation, persistently repeated by theking’s sons, the moment comes to resort to the magic sympathetic interven-tion. It is to be assumed that the person who carries it out is the chief exorcistor magician of the kingdom as the circumstances demand it. Such interventionis formed by a ritual enactment:25See in this regard Lewis, Th.J. 2011.26See Del Olmo Lete, G. 1998:205, nn. 111–114 for this and other possible versions.27See below on this question, pp 32f."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"28The Ugaritic Gods and Magic1.yṣq.šmn.b ṣʕ.w yHe poured oil in/from a plate,ʕn.tr.ảrṣ.w šmmlooked around earth and sky,sb.l qṣm.ảrṣturning round to the edges of the earth,l ksm.mhyt.to the extremes of the prairies.This libation andcircumspectioare followed by the solemn delivery of theincantation formula (KTU 1.16 III 4b–11), in the shape of a doxology in honourof the rain god,Baˁlu:................ʕn5.l ảrṣ.mṭr.bʕlA source for the earth isBaˁlu’s rain,w l šd.mṭr. ʕlyAnd for the field the Most High’s shower!nʕm.l ảrṣ.mṭr.bʕlSimply a delight for the earth isBaˁlu’s rain,w l šd.mṭr. ʕlyAnd for the fields the Most High’s shower!nʕm.l ḥṭṭ.b ʕnA delight it is for the grain in the furrows,10.bm nrt.k smmin the ploughed field it is like a perfume,ʕl.tlm k. ʕṭrṭron the hills it is like a diadem!28The outcome was not successful and resorting to the assembly of the godsseems inescapable (KTU 1.6 IV 1ff.), provokingIlu’s intervention that has beenalready commented on.On the other hand, in the ritual texts a formula is used repeatedly that, asI suggested some time ago, referred to theroyal functionof the cultic oracle.It isṯṯb rgm, “the transmission of an answer”.29The hypothesis has not foundgreat acceptance and remains in any case simply a working hypothesis.

They belong mostly to the category of “divination”, of whichwe spoke in the previous chapter and will not occupy us her; others are of nointerest to us. In these texts, the absence of gods is paradigmatic, as waspointed out above.31In fact, divination turns out to be the sort of magicalpractice that has the most complete autonomy of this system with respect tothe deities. Now, leaving apart those divination texts and the quoted glimpsesfound in the mythological and epic literature we have some, very few indeed,texts that represent magical intervention against past-present calamities thathave not affected already, but that may also affect someone in the future. Inthem the question does not concern knowledge of this future, but the preven-tion and above all the release of an impending evil. These texts have beencollected and commented upon in the following pages, intended as a kind ofUgaritic Guide to Prophylactic Magic/Incantations: some fifteen to seventeen insyllabic Akkadian and six in consonantal Ugaritic (among them, texts againstsnakebite are prominent).The Akkadian texts may be classified as follows:a) Miscellaneous incantation texts: RS 17.155 (evil spirits, head disease, fever,embrocation, dog bite, see also RS 15.152, RS 34.021); RS 25.129+ (vomiting,diarrhea, paralysis, red disease); RS 25.422 (all diseases); RS 94.2178 (fever,sick eye); RS 94.2067 (gall bladder disease);b) Texts with one or more incantation against a specific harm or danger: RS20.006 (sick eye); RS 25.418 (sick eye); RS 25.420+ und RS 25.513 (aginstLamashtu; cf. also RS 25.457); RS 25.436 (for a woman in labour, see alsoRS 17.081).c) Fragmentary unclassifiable texts (RS 16.416bis; RS 20.161+; RS 25.418; RS25.422; RS 25.436; RS 25.511A; RS 25.513; RS 34.021; RS 94.2067; RS 94.2964)d) Assimilated texts: RS 25.457 (an amulet).These texts follow Babylonian models, some of them are even copies of textsthat are classical in this tradition. Their structure and formulary are typicallyBabylonian. The gods present and invoked in them are those mentioned in theprevious chapter in this connection.The Ugaritic texts fall into two categories:a) Incantations against snakebite: 1) the canonical incantation text (KTU1.100); 2) effectual incantation texts (KTU 1.82; 1.107; 1.178).b) Anti-witchcraft incantations: 1) a miscellaneous incantation text (KTU1.169); 2) an incantation text against the “evil eye (sorcerer/witch)” (KTU1.96).31See in this connection Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:47ff."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"30The Ugaritic Gods and MagicTo some extent, these texts imitate the Babylonian genre and above all borrowmotifs and lexical formulae from that tradition. They are under its influence,but do not translate any known Babylonian text. They show an autonomoustradition of their own. And in particular these texts appeal to their own godsand their avatars.The Ugaritic word for an incantation formula seems to bemnt(var.mntn[?])corresponding to Akkadianšiptu, Sumerian en₂. The word occurs several times inKTU 1.100.32b) The Ugaritic God of MagicThe Akkadian Ugaritic texts feature a pantheon similar to the one that appearsin the Mesopotamian incantation texts. We refer in this connection to theexplanations given in the previous chapter.As for the Ugaritic consonantal texts, we have seen that the only Ugariticgod who acts as a magician in themythologicaltexts is the supreme godˀIlu.It is he who controls this system of forces, although indirectly, by “magical”,autonomous means. The other gods display their divine powers to benefit orharm humans; but they declare themselves unable to remove the evil effectsthat have happened to men and nature, when motivated by other divine inter-ventions and the fatal consequence connected with them. IsˀIlu, then, theUgaritic god of magic? As we shall see later on,33ˀIluis also declared unable,like the other principal gods, to defend men against snakebite: he too is igno-rant of the required formula. Therefore, in our quest for an answer to thisproblem, we have to turn our attention to the magic ritual texts quoted above,and see which gods are mentioned and entreated in those texts.In this regard, it is surprising to find that two short texts (KTU 1.96 and1.178), both very well preserved, neither invoke nor even mention any deity.The first is a mere incantation formula against the “evil eye” (seeinfra), to berecited by the one affected by this attack through witchcraft, whereas the sec-ond seems to be a composite text in descriptive form (seeinfra). We maydistinguish in it the prescription and the incantation: the anonymous magicianpoints out the appropriate ritual to be carried out in this case (in keeping withthe indication of the canonical text against snakebite, KTU 1.100:64–69) andsuggests the accompanying formula, which is simply the verbalisation of its32See DULs.v.for the various meanings ofmnt; also Clemens, D.M. 2001:222.33Seeinfraon KTU 1.100."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Magic at Ugarit31effects along with the mention of the evildoing witchcraft agents who will beaffected.Both texts lack the opening and closing sections that normally mentionand invoke the gods and usually frame the operative part (the incantation).KTU 1.169, a compendium text of various anti-witchcraft incantations, isvery similar. In the first section, the godsBaˁlu(line 2) andḤôrānu(line 9)34are invoked to act against the “foul-mouthed (sorcerers) of youth” on hearing“the voice of the exorcist/magician”, who recites the incantation.35It is thisrecitation that sets in motion the divine/magical intervention. In this way, thedivine and the magical power appear to be interwoven, prayer and incantationgo together, as was frequently the case in ancient Mesopotamian texts of thisgenre, as pointed out above and as established in the later stages of the genre.Here, for the first time, we encounter the godḤôrānuwho will also be presentin the other three texts (all incantation texts against snakebite), although in adifferent position. In KTU 1.82, he is one of the gods invoked, along withŠapšu, Baˁlu, theRapaˀūma(?),ˁAnatuandẓẓ wkmṯ.36In this text,Baˁluseemsto be the main divine protagonist in ensuring the efficacy of the incantation,as it was the case in KTU 1.169. The other gods invoked apparently play asecondary or complementary role. The appearance ofẓẓ wkmṯat the end leavesus without precise knowledge as to the role this composite deity, who isunknown in Ugaritic ritual praxis, plays in this kind of anti-witchcraft magicagainst snakebite.37As in KTU 1.169, here too the incantation takes on theform of a prayer.We are now left with two contrasting texts. In KTU 1.100, which we defineas “the canonical” formulation of the efficacy of this kind of magical activity(and as such, it is thehieròs lógosoraetiologyof the genre rather than aneffectual incantation text) only the godḤôrānuis the actual effective powerable to solve the situation. He is the only one who knows how to deal with thiskind of danger and keeps its formula that he shares with his female partner ofobscure personality. The other god active in some way in this situation isŠapšu, who has the role of mediator between the suppliant and the godḤôr-ānu, and so becomes an essential part of the solution.38Nevertheless, her role34The mention ofˀAṯiratuin line 16 is merely literary, as part of an oath formula.35This divine “couple” also occurs in the cultic consultation KTU 1.124; seeinfrapp. 97f.36Here too, the possible mention ofMôtuin line 5 is indirect and in any case he is one ofthe evildoers.37Frequently, the DNkmṯhas been linked with the Moabite godkemôš. In this regard isworth while mentioning the Balaam episode (Nm 22–24), theāšipuacting on behalf of theking of Moab, as a typical scene of an incantation spell frustrated by a “curse”.38It is surprising in this regard to read in De Moor, J.C. 1987:30, n. 128: “(Ḥôrānu) god ofblack magic, master of evil demons”. I do not believe this to be his present opinion."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"32The Ugaritic Gods and Magicis a subordinate one, as a mere intermediary, participating in the same generaldivine powerlessness.39In fact all the other gods (ˀIlu, Baˁlu, Dagānu, ˁAnatu,Yarḫu, Rašpu, ˁAṯtartu,ẓẓ-kmṯ, Milku, Kôṯaru-Ḫasisu, Šaḫru-Šalimu) great asthey may be, are emphatically discarded as incompetent, one by one, in con-trast with the collective exclusion by the godˀIluin the case ofKirta’s illness(see above). As we will see later on,40this text becomes definitive to under-stand the ideology and praxis of magic at Ugarit as a sort of programmaticformulation of its origin and functionality.On the contrary, in apparently dialectical opposition to the former, themain agent in KTU 1.107 isŠapšu; the rest of the gods, the very ones disquali-fied in KTU 1.100 (includingḤôrānuwho appears as one more divine being,although he is mentioned in first position together withˀIlu) and listed in thesame order, are also summoned, this time in couples, to collaborate in theremoval of the threatened evil. Is it possible to suggest here a sort of differen-tiation or distinct magical praxis among the specialist personnel in Ugarit?41On the other hand, incantation and prayer come together once again.The evidence is too scarce and fragmentary to allow conclusions to bedrawn regarding the actual patron god of magic at Ugarit. Provisionally andtaking as a starting-point the Mesopotamian pattern, we may suggest a diagramthat systematises in a synchronic level the roles of the three godsŠapšu, BaˁluandḤôranuin the field of magic and anti-witchcraft practice; in a diachronicperspective, in view of KTU 1.100,Ḥôrānuwas possibly the most outstandingand original character. The other texts (KTU 1.107 and 1.169) may represent acompromise and adaptation to the normative mythological scheme. This pro-cess is also apparent in the curse formula (KTU 1.2 I 7–9; 1.16 VI 54–58) quotedabove, whereḤôrānuis coupled withˁAṯtartu. But this goddess is qualified asšm bʕl, thus unifying once more the two force systems as the source of magicalpower: the chthonian and the divine. This coupling, however, becomes signifi-cant in the light of KTU 1.100, whereḪôrānuis also coupled with a certainủmpḥl pḥlt. This unknown deity, however, cannot be identified withˁAṯtartu, sinceshe is excluded by the same text because of her impotence in this field, perhapsin an emphatic and polemical way (in KTU 1.100:20 along withˁAnatuandseparate in le.e.).42But in fact the pattern of a divine couple is also present inthe world of magic in Mesopotamia and only through theogamy could the dei-39In my opinion, it cannot be asserted that “werde hier (in KTU 1.100:1–2) die Göttin Šapašan die erste Stelle der Götter gesetzt”, as head of a different theogony; see Dietrich, M., Loretz,O. 2000a:312–313. She is not even taken into consideration as a possible example of a helper.40See below on KTU 1.100.41For this issue and the dialectical relationship between the two texts see later on p. 209.42See later pp. 191ff."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Magic at Ugarit33ties acquire the control and patronage of magic. The anonymous character ofthe female partner is possibly an indirect way of showing the inability of anyknown deity in the official pantheon to assume the role of patron of magicalactivity.This is a possible parallel projection of the Mesopotamian and Ugariticsystems of patrons of magic:Mesop.UgaritAnuˀIlu||Enki // ŠamašŠapšu// (Baˁlu)||Asalluḫi//Marduk +Ningirim//IṡḫaraḤôrānu+ủm pḥl pḥlt//ủsḫry(?)However, in spite of all these approaches, the Ugaritic religious system provesto be independent and unique.

Naturally, a general distinction has tobe made between the term denoting a magician or exorcist and terms for awarlock/witch. As for the first, according to KTU 1.169:2 it is theṯʕy(ṯāʕiyu)who pronounces the incantation (lpn ql ṯʕy). The wide semantic range of thisterm is well known, both in administrative (= sukkal?) and in cultic affairs(“sacrificer”; see KTU 1.161:27–30)43.

As we have seen48it defines the intervention ofˀIluasa magician and it is used as a nominal form in KTU 1.19 IV 60, whereDanīˀilu’s“knowing” daughter,Puġatu, tries to influence the abode of her brother’sassassin by casting “spells” (ḫršm) on it. As a nominal formḥršis well attestedin the Semitic languages (NWS and Eth.) with the meaning mentioned,49whilethe verb seems to be a denominative derivation used in the reflexive verbalpattern (Gt: /ḫtrš/).50Originally the base had the meaning of “to work” solidmaterials (metal, stone, wood). The semantic proximity between “craftsman-ship” and “magic” must be very old indeed and may be present in the descrip-tion of the godKôṯaruashyn dḫrš ydm, understood either as “DN the ambidex-trous craftsman” or as “Ea of the artisans”, as was pointed out above.51However the nominal form is not used in Ugaritic to denote either a magicianor a wizard.It is rather surprising that a clear specific Ugaritic term for “magician” asthe expert in the field of magic divination in its different aspects (seesupra45See later on p. 184ff.46See later on p. 130, 143ff.47See later on p. 183f.48See p. 18.49See DUL 370f.

The evidence implies the activity of a body of professionals,known asbārûin Akkadian, Heb.qosem, rôʔēh(bakkābēd) or even Ar.kāhin-.The archaeologists of Ras Shamra, on the other hand, have named the “Houseof the Magician-Priest” where lung and liver models were found.53The onlyisolate and indirect designation is that of Hurrian originprln, “diviner”, oneof the titles of the great OfficialʔAttānu[ (KTU 1.6 VI 55; 1.17 VI le.e; 1.179:40;see also the fragmentary ivory inscription 6.47:1) in the colophon of the textswritten byʔIlimilku,a term not attested elsewhere apart from the plurilingualvocabularies.54It seems then that the word designates an honorific title ratherthan a common noun for the profession. In the colophon the word is immedi-ately complemented or glossed byrb khnm(KTU 1.6 VI 55–56). This title isalso inscribed on votive weapons belonging to the hoard discovered in the1929 campaign (cf. KTU 6.6–10). Here we have a body of professionals, namely“priests” (khnm) who do not appear acting in the ritual texts and whose chiefis symbolically linked to military or war activity as a first rank official, beingin the first place aprln, “a diviner”. In originbārûtuwas certainly concernedwith war, and the diviner,no doubt the “chief of the diviners”, accompaniedthe “general” in the battle field in a similar rank position.55The combinationof the archaeological and literary data immediately suggests thatkhnis in factthe missing designation.56Once more Ugaritic would reflect Arabic semantics,reinforcing in this way the mutual pertinence of both languages. But in accord-ance with the Amorite tradition57it is also possible that the common term inuse for “diviner” was borrowed from the Akkadian tradition (bārû) on whichthe Ugaritic practice seems to have largely depended.5852The connection of the royal titlegṯrwith an hypothetical oracular royal function is a mereguess. See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014a:138, 290. In any case this term cannot designate the “com-mon diviner”.53See Yon, M. 1977:121; Dietrich, M. – Loretz, O. 1990:2.54See W.E.

Most of them have Mesopotamian parallels and their Sumero-Akkadian phrasing and structure are clearly patterned after Mesopotamianoriginals. The hostile demonic powers whose actions they describe (such asLamashtu) as well as the deities whose helpful intervention is sought (such asEnki and his son Asalluḫi) belong to the world of Mesopotamian, not Ugaritic,religion. And the same holds true for the accompanying magical and medicaltreatments. As a matter of course, this would not exclude the possibility thatexorcists at Ugarit could try to ease the sufferer’s harm by using such Babylo-nian spells, however imperfectly understood (Asalluḫi, for example, is calledthe daughter of Enki in one text2). But the parallels found in other contempo-rary peripheral sites such as Emar or Hattusha and the fact that the RasShamra texts were discovered in private houses as part of assemblages of tab-lets predominantly including lexical lists show that copying Babylonian incan-tations was a part of the curriculum of scribal learning in the western periph-ery around the 13th century BC.3This observation is confirmed by the mistakesand misunderstandings that exhibit some of the tablets, the cases of substratelanguage influence in writing Akkadian, namely Middle Babylonian, and theinexperience of the scribes in dealing with Sumerian.4The recent volume published by D. Arnaud on the Sumerian and Akkadianlibrary texts from Ugarit provides copies, transliterations and translations ofmost of the incantation texts.5About half of them had been previously editedby J. Nougayrol,6and one of them had been published by S.

New readings based on thephotographs or parallels are not discussed in detail given the scope of thepresent book. These and a more thorough treatment of some of the texts willbe dealt with in a series of forthcoming partial studies.The Babylonian incantation texts from Ugarit fall into different groupsaccording to the criteria of structure and of type of source. One tablet can beinscribed with one individual incantation (RS 20.006, RS 25.513, RS 25.436) orwith various incantations. Among the latter compendia, there is one large tab-let with Lamashtu incantations (RS 25.420+); another one brings togetherspells against different but possibly related demons (RS 17.155); still anotherone preserves two incantations with the same motif (RS 25.418); and otherscombine independent spells against different and distinct afflictions (RS25.129+, RS 25.422, RS 94.2178). In some cases the accompanying ritual followsthe incantation (RS 25.129+, RS 25.418).Because of the format and content of the fragment, it is possible that RS17.081,8omitted in Arnaud’s volume, preserves part of the incipit of an incanta-tion that was to be recited during the ritual that is partially intelligible. Thisis the reason why the text has been included in the present edition. On theother hand, a number of tablets and fragments included in Arnaud’s chapteron incantations have been excluded here for several reasons. The tablet RS94.2964 presents a badly effaced surface; following the collation of two setsof photographs, it has not been possible to decipher the words that wouldhelp identify this damaged text as an incantation.

Withthe exception of one fragment,14they have all been discovered in differenthouses within the Late Bronze Age city of Ugarit. As already stated, thesehouses served as scribal schools as shown by the large number of lexical tab-lets they contained. The largest number of incantation tablets, about half ofthe corpus, was excavated in the House of the Lamashtu texts obviouslynamed after some of the texts themselves. Three texts come from the Houseof Urtenu; and the Houses of Rashapʾabu, Rapʾanu, and the Scholar haveyielded one text each.The order in which the texts edited in this chapter are presented is arbi-trary, following the Assyriological convention of placing first those incanta-tions belonging to what will become in the first millennium canonical magicalor ritual series.A series of incantations against Lamashtu (RS 25.420+)Copy:Arnaud, D. 2007:pls.

Geller, M.J. 2007:xi n. 3), namely its first incan-tation. Because this was not known to any of the scholars who havepreviously dealt with the text, many new restorations and readingsare here presented for the first time. Some notes follow on more orless punctual aspects. A more thorough treatment of this importanttext will be offered elsewhere.5.Note the shift of intervocalicntoʾinšāʾina(<šānina).5–9.It is now possible to safely suggest the original source of the Sume-rian syllabically written text as follows:ḫul.gal₂ sil₇.la₂ igi.mu.ta ga₂.e me.en ga₂.e me.en ur.sag ᵈasal.lu₂.ḫidumu sag eriduki.ga.ke₄ nig₂.nam ḫul nig₂ nu.sig₅.ganig₂ nu.til.la.gu₁₀ su nu.du.ga.gu₁₀ ag₂.u₆.li?ᵈen.ki.ke₄ a.ra ga.ra.ab.zi.11.The canonical text haslissuḫas final verb.12–45.The second incantation is a “forerunner” to the first-millenniumseriesMuššuʾuTablet 5, namely its fourth incantation (see Böck, B.2007: 25, 42–43, 191–196, 209–210, subMuššuʾuV/d). The parallelshave provided new readings and potential restorations.16.The tentative restoration at the end of the line is based on the first-millennium parallel text; note that the text has other examples ofcrasis writing.17.Both the writing of manni-nu-u₂-niand the verbal form are aberrant,as already pointed out by Nougayrol, J. (1969:36), who proposed toread itišannanûni. Could one read itiznunūni? Note that the textexhibits a high degree of confusion in the representation of sibilants.For demons raining like a drizzle, cf. e.g. Šurpu VII 15f.22–30.A similar list of demons is partly preserved in RS 34.021:1–10 (seebelow).38.Von Soden, W. (1969:190) already suggested the mistakenaškaptifornašpanti.40.KA-a-niis clearly written at the end of the line. The imperative ofkâʾu/qâʾu“to vomit; flow out” suits well the context.Rev. 7'.Von Soden, W. (1969:190) proposed to understandlip-ḫu-du₂as theAkkadian precative of an alleged Ugaritic verb meaning “to dread,fear”; so also Huehnergard, J. 1987:166."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"A collection of incantations against various demons and diseases (RS 17.155)578’.Forarrabu<errebu, see Von Soden, W.:1969 190.13’.Perhapsi-na u₂-ši-šuforina ūsišu?

Forlu-ša-ziz-za<u₂-ša-ziz-za, seealready Nougayrol, J. 1968:38 (who read however KU instead of LU).16’–19’.The incantation is a “forerunner” to first-millenniumMuššuʾuVIII/r(see Böck, B. 2007: 63, 296). The formḫa.an.da.bu.restands forSumerianḫe₂.en.da.bur₂.re, asalready pointed out by Nougay-rol (1969:38); see also Krecher, J. 1969:155.17’.Perhapspi.in.du for bi₂.in.du₁₁.18’.The interpretation ofni.ig.gi.ri.ma.re.eš.mu.um.mu.ke asᵈnin.girim ereš.mu₇.mu₇.ke₄ was putforward by Krecher(1969:155).20’–27’.The fire or, rather, fever incantation was first re-evaluated in thelight of first-millennium versions by Lambert, W.G. (1970:44). Aduplicate and roughly contemporary text from Emar was later pub-lished by Tsukimoto, A. (1999:188–200), providing important newreadings and restorations, and a new parallel came to light in the1994 campaign of excavations in Ras Shamra (see RS 94.2178 below).21’.The sign dagalₓis written PISANxLA. Isa-ma-ba-a-raan aberrantsyllabic writing of ambar? Cf. the also aberrant variant forms in theEmar and Ugarit parallel texts (Tsukimoto 1999:188–200 line 28, RS94.2178:2; see below).23’.The complementina tulêšuis probably a corruption forina sūnišu;note the masculine genitive suffix. Lambert, W.G. (1970:44) and CADT 468 preferred to restore at the end of the previous line the wordšerraand accordingly correct the suffix; the restoration here viz.mi₂ki.sikil is based on the (also corrupted) versions of the Meskeneand Ras Shamra tablets. See RS 94.2178 obv. 3 below.26’.On the basis of the Emar duplicate,sinuntuis very probably to berestored at the end of the line.28’–45’.The last incantation is a “forerunner” to one of the incantations ofthe first-millennium series Sag-gig, as already pointed out by Nou-gayrol (1968:39). To the manuscripts quoted by Nougayrol oneshould add now KBo 14 26 and SpTU II no. 2 148ff.29’.The beginning of the linelu.ug.gin₇ mu.un.du.dushouldprobably be understood asu₁₈.lu.gin₇ mu.un.du₆.du₆.34’.Here and in line 37’ Asalluḫi is said to be the daughter of Enki; notealso the feminine form of the genitive suffix in line 33 and the verbin line 34.

Spells, theirsubscripts, and rituals, are all properly divided by horizontal ruling lines. Thefirst two incantations are intended to stop vomiting (the ritual to the secondone presents two additional, alternative treatments). The third spell is againstdiarrhea. The fourth is directed againstšimmatudisease according to its sub-script,18although interestingly the spell speaks ofmaškadudisease. And thefifth spell is againstsamānudisease.

The RasShamra text provides insightful restorations and a better understand-ing of the Kuyunjik texts (studied by Scurlock, J.A. 2005:431–433).Note that the Kuyunjik incantation (which will be treated elsewhere)is directed against the Hand-of-the-ghost.24.This formula is to be added to the list of attestations collected anddiscussed by Schramm, W. 2001:13–18. Note that the presence of thecomitative noun in the Ras Shamra text supports his interpretation ofthe formula.29.The tentative restoration of the ingredient is based both on the tracesof the cuneiform signs and the fact that it appears in other recipescombined with sulphur andruttītu-mineral."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Incantation against eye disease (RS 20.006)69Incantation against eye disease (RS 20.006)Copy:Nougayrol, J. 1968:379:no. 19.Edition:Nougayrol, J. 1968:64–65:no. 19; Collins, T. 1999:200–203; Fincke, J.2000:93 n. 717, 167, 203, 302.Literature:Foster, B. 2005:967 (translation of the text); Clemens, D.M.2001:844–847 (with previous literature); Arnaud, D. 2007:88:no. 22.Find-place:The House of Rapʾanu.This fifteen-line incantation text is inscribed on a single tablet in landscapeorientation.

Arnaud(2007:88) also favoured the idea of a scribal mistake so as to avoid boththe hybrid form ofelûand its meaning, but could not find any satisfactorysolution. Foster’s translation, like the one adopted here, follows Nougay-rol’s (1968:65).7–9.Like Nougayrol (1968:65) and Foster (2005:967), I would like to under-stand these lines as referring to the remedy (Collins’s suggested parallels[1999:202] and Fincke’s different reading [2000 167 n. 1256] would insteadpoint to the disease being still described). For the reading of the first verband sentence (lines 7–8), see van SoldtapudCAD Q 59 (the interpreta-tions of Nougayrol, Foster and Arnaud are based on unnecessary correc-tions); it is unnecessary to correctkītokīma.

The number of thesetexts (spells, exorcisms, etc.) is particularly small in Ugaritic literature, if wecompare it with Sumero-Akkadian tradition, as was pointed out above. Butamong the texts of religious practice, there some that apparently exhibit magi-cal functions and that sometimes have been defined as “incantations”, withoutsufficient reason in my opinion. To assess this classification we have to com-pare them with the pattern provided by Mesopotamian literature, the bestdeveloped and that was so well-known at Ugarit (see the previous chapter onUgaritic syllabic incantation texts). So, leaving aside the texts treated here asclearlyincantation(oranti-witchcraft) texts (KTU 1.82, 1.96, 1.100, 1.107, 1.169,1.178)1, from their form and contents, which will be commented onin extensolater on, the following texts from the category KTU 1 have been suggested asalso belonging to the same class, namely: KTU 1.12, 1.13, 1.23, 1.24, 1.75, 1.82,1.96, 1.108, 1.113, 1.114, 1.161, 2.31 and more dubiously KTU 1.20–22, 1.65, 1.83,1.86. Let us consider them briefly here2and assess the arguments put forwardin this connection.3KTU 1.12According to Dietrich/Loretz, this text would comprise a Baalmythand a ritualofhydrophory, forming a single compositional unit4. The sense of the text isdefined as follows: “Tod und Rückkehr Baals sichern die Ernte” (p. 1). Thevarious attempts at interpretation can be classified into three groups: 1) schol-ars who connect the text with the (agrarian) cycle of seven/eight years; 2)those who see it as a reshaping of theSeasonal Patternand finally, 3) thosewho see it as a ritual Baal myth, independent from the Seasonal Pattern and1See most recently Lewis, Th.J. 2011:227.2For a more detailed list of scholars and opinions in this regard see the remarks of Clemens:for De Moor are incantations: KTU 1.13, 1.23, 1.24, 1.82, 1.100, 1.107, 1.108, 1.113, 2.31 (Clemens,D. 2007:93, n. 440); for Dietrich–Loretz–Sanmartín (KTU²): incantations: KTU 1.13, 1.23, 1.82,1.100, 1.107, 1.114 // ? 1.20–22, 1.65, 1.86 (Clemens 98, n. 466, see also p. 100 n. 477, 134 n. 638).I will leave aside their assessments and criticisms that will not produce worthwhile results inquestions of classification so highly debatable.3For a general introduction to the subject see Spronk.

A summaryof some twenty interpretations by various scholars in this last group is pro-vided. In my own reading of this text in 1983 I took it as a variant version ofthe Baalictheomachy: a “fight between the fertility god and the destructiveforces of it coming from the desert”.5An interpretation that still seems validto me and could belong to the third group.While the colometric arrangement of the text does not leave much roomfor disagreement with the analysis by Dietrich-Loretz, the lexical interpretationand consequently the final meaning of the text turn out to be more hypotheti-cal and objectionable. Here this discussion will be omitted6to focus attentionon the overall interpretation and classification of the text.According to Dietrich-Loretz, the first part of the text (I 1–II line 55a) is amythical report that speaks of Baal’s death and his return to life as a guaranteeof fertility (water and grain) that “als Einleitung zur folgenden Hydrophorie inII 55b–61 dient. Der Mythos begründet die magisch-kultische Handlung, sodass KTU 1.12 bezüglich seines gesamten Aufbaus insoweit mit 1.114 paralleli-sierbar ist” (p. 124). The conclusion is clear: “KTU 1.12 bezüglich seiner Gattungzur priestlichen Beschwörungsliteratur gehört und in Beziehung zum Neu-jahrsfest zu sehen ist” (p. 125).But even taking II 53–61 as an incantation formula7according to this inter-pretation (in fact it seems rather to be ahieròs lógosin an aetiological narra-tive) the expected ban against Baal’s enemies who have caused his downfall,namely the “evil spirits” or demons (the “brethren” or theảklm//ˁqqmof thebeginning)8, is missing. So there is a clear disparity between the mythicalrecord and the presumed incantation. In any case, the text would ratherbelong to the category of sympathetic magic, not to the kind of magic (anti-thetic, polemical, anti-witchcraft) we are dealing with here.9For me, thedescriptions of Baal’s defeat and of the victory of theảklmas well as themeaning of their birth, forms a mythological account of its own in which the5See Del Olmo Lete, G. 1981:478.6For a detailed lexical assessment of Dietrich–Loretz’s options see cf. Del Olmo Lete, G.2007a:155–168.7The scholars stand by their version in TUAT 6/IV (Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 1997:1200) whichis more nuanced and they speak only of an “Anrufung des siegreichen Wettergottes... DieseAnrufung habe man wohl mit der Durchführung von Riten, wie z. B. Wasserschöpfen in Tem-pel zu verbinden ”. The text certainly complements the Baal Cycle.8Certain “demons” do feature in the Ugaritic texts: KTU 1.10, 1.12, 1.24, 1.114 (ḥby)... but notin the context of magical literature. In myth and epic literature, apart from anti-Baal monsters,characters such asŠaˁtiqatuandYatipānuare present.9See above pp. 7ff."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"KTU 1.1283fight between them is the actual subject of the narrative. Those demonic char-acters along with Baal are the actual protagonists of the mythical account.For a discussion of the semantic and morpho-literary options put forwardby scholars, we refer to the analysis mentioned above. Let us only summarisesome overall objections concerning the supposition of ahydrophoryritualhere.10In this connection, no Mesopotamian parallels are available for such aritual nor does it appear to be a New Year Festival, which is supposed to beits setting. The evidence adduced (the Adonis myth and some Ugaritic andbiblical references) comprises mere literary, descriptive, typological elements,but not specific ritual texts ofhydrophory.In fact, no manual or encyclopaedia of Mesopotamian religion, as far as Iknow (Oppenheim, Haussig-Edzard, Sanmartín, Durand,RlA) mentions such aritual; nor does it appear in Phoenician religion (Lipiński, Moscati, Ribichini).Among the Hittites, there is definitely a ritual “Wasserbecken”, on which Hasscomments: “Die Anlage erinnert an eine mittelhethitischen Instruktion, derzufolge jemand (zur Strafe) dreimal Wasser aus dem ‘Wasserbecken desLabarna’ schöpft und in den Tempel (des Labarna) bringt”.11It is not a ques-tion then of “libation” but of “transfer” (“bringt”), as supposed by the Greektermhydrophória.And it is precisely in this context that we find the ritualisa-tion of such a practice, the festival ofhydrophoryat Athens. Its sense is linkedto the Greek myth of the “Flood” and its hero Deukalion, as well as withthe sacred crevice through which it was absorbed.12The same mythical motifunderlies the story recorded by Lucian of Samosata on thehydrophoryper-formed in the temple of Aphrodite in Hierapolis.13Although the literary motifclearly comes from the east, the ritual is not quoted as a loan in Greece eitherby Burkert14, West15or by Astour16. The Danaides are the closest in this sense,but they arethesmophórai, loutrophórai, nothydrophórai; their function assuch is to be punished in Hades. Of couurse, we know that in Greece therewere water libations for the benefit of the dead and incantations intended tomake rain fall that are closer to the genre proposed by Dietrich-Loretz for KTU10In any case, there is a ruled line separating the two sections of the text as in KTU 1.114,which is in the same category as KTU 1.12.11See. Haas, V. 1994.627. On water in the Hittite cult in general, see Erbil, Y., Mouton, A.2012.12See Burkert, W. 1997:125; Parker, H.W. 1987:179.13See Camps i Gasset, M. 1966:174.14See Burkert, W. 1992.15See West, M.L. 1999:489ff.16See Astour, M.C. 1967."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"84Dubious and Incorrectly Identified Ugaritic Incantation Texts1.12, but they are no longerhydrophóriai. At most they are, according to Burk-ert, “freilich ‘Zauber’ nicht in Gestalt sympathetischer Magie, sondern wie-derum aus dem Grundsinn der Libation genommen: Erhebung zum Hoffendurch gelassene Verschwendung”.17The usual temple spring and the connected rites of hydrophory are nor-mally linked to purification rituals by water18and fire. This is the same contextto which the disputed Jewish ritual of the Second Temple belongs,śimḥat bêthaš-šôˀēbāh, celebrated during the Sukkot festival,19in which water waslibated after the morning sacrifice.20The bible makes no mention of such aritual, in spite of Is. 12:3 (a literary topos that speaks of “taking out”, not of“bringing” or “pouring”). All in all, the meaning of an entreaty for rain (afertility rite) does not seem primary, either in this or in any of the quotedcontexts, although it cannot be ruled out that they were to some extent linkedto the New Year Festival, as Jewish usage implies.I retain, then, my interpretation21of this last section of KTU 1.12 as thecolophon that describes the situation of dryness and barrenness affecting thecountry as one of the forerunners of the Baal Cycle whose protagonists are the“greedy/devouring”genii// demons on the one hand, andBaˁluon the other,as a kind of mythical lament song or hymn. No doubt other myths that werealso forerunners ended in tragedy. Instead, this one rather than rounding upthe canonical myth (KTU 1.1–6), in another sense betrays one of its key epi-sodes:Baˁlu’s death. There, the opponent wasMôtu, here the “devourers”.Nevertheless, accepting Dietrich-Loretz understanding of the KTU 1.12 as ahypothesis, a place could be made for it in the magic literature of Ugarit.22Insuch a fluctuating field as the interpretation of Ugaritic literary texts, onecannot claim absolute certainty for one’s own point of view.In their turn Caquot-Sznycer, after a lengthy evaluation of various previousinterpretations, conclude: “BH serait un texte de circonstance, expliquant lanaissance des sauterelles et les ravages qu’elles peuvent provoquer, et expo-sant les moyens de s’en défendre, à l’instar et sous l’égide de Baˁal, tout enayant allure d’un texte liturgique, acompagnant certains rites au moment del’invasion des sauterelles et, peut-être, susceptible également d’être utilisé pré-17See Burkert, W. 1997:125.18See Burkert, W. 1997:132ff.19See Sukk. 5:1.

The second,fragmentary part describes Baal’s death and the ‘cosmic mourning’ which fol-lows. An atonement element appears to be present (see especially l. 46 of col.ii), and the text ends with a ritual instruction”.24This is not an incantation.KTU 1.13De Moor does not include this text in hisAnthologyin the section labelled“Incantations”, but under the more general category of “Myth and Ritual”25.However, in a previous study, entitled “An Incantation against Infertility (KTU1.13)”, together with KTU 1.12, 1.23, 1.24, 1.100, 1.114, he sees in this text a sortof combination of myth and incantation26in the form of a hymn, together withan embedded “prayer” and a promise. Since there is no allusion to an incanta-tion in the version of this text provided in theAnthology, it can be concludedthat De Moor has abandoned his previous classification in favour of the moregeneral one of ritual text, with elements of both genres.This text is also labelled as an “incantation” by the editors of KTU.27Instead, Wyatt takes this text to be “A Hymn to Anat”.28In my opinion, this text must not be classified either as a “hymn”, sincethe distinctive elements of the genre do not appear in it, or as a prayer-incanta-tion against infertility. Instead, it is a partial mytheme that develops an aspectof the basic mythological sub-cycle ofˁAnatu-Baˁlu: the mytheme ofˁAnatu’sclassification as “Baˁlu’s heifer” and her later delivery, while in KTU 1.5 V 18–21, and even in KTU 1.10–11, this identification is not openly stated and23See Caquot, A., Sznycer, M. 1974: 330.24See Wyatt, N. 1998a:162.25See.

In a previousstudy De Moor criticised this too large notion of “incantation” outside the magic genre; seeDe Moor, J.C. 1977:366. For the texts once De Moor considered to be “incantations” (KTU 1.13,1.23, 1.24, 1.82, 1.100, 1.107, 1.108, 1.113, 2.31), see above n.2.27See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O., Sanmartín, J. 1995:35 (“incantation, myth, scribal exercise”).28See Wyatt, N. 1998a:169–173.

In this regard, its turns out to be a rather“heterodox” and more developed text that aims at presenting a kind of myth-ico-dogmatic synthesis ofˁAnatuas a goddess of war and fertility, simplybringing together her virginity and motherhood. Here her motherhood seemsto be the result of her ability as a violent fighter for life embodied in herbrotherBaˁlu’s destiny whose defence carries her to a violent confrontationwith Death (Môtu) itself. After such an effort she receives as a reward (fromwhom?) a heavenly abode to rest. The text thus forms part of this group ofminor myths that expressly develop the myth of (animal and human) fertilityconcealed in the classic cycle under the direct symbolism of the power struggleamong the gods, although in the end it is symbolic of the power of life. Likethose, this brief summary or mytheme has all the possibilities of having beenlargely used in the manifestations of popular religion and frequently recited.Perhaps the present tablet is a crudely made copy and little cared for amongthe many copies that may have existed.29KTU 1.20–22Among the commentators on these texts, only KTU²,30and in this case hesi-tantly, labels them as an “incantation”(?). But later on, two of the scholars whoedited KTU² – Dietrich-Loretz (1997)31– adopted an eclectic position in respectof the classification and incorporation of these texts into theˀAhqatulegend,considering them as an epic with elements of royal ideology and the ancestorcult. In his excellent edition of the text,32Pitard does not go into the questionof classifying its genre, his main interest being the correct epigraphic readingof the tablets. Pardee, although somewhat more attentive to the literary ques-tions, is no more explicit either on the classification issue; but since he consid-ers that these texts comprise a fourth tablet that continues theˀAhqatuepic, itis obvious to presume that he takes them to belong into this literary genre;there is no allusion to and incantation.33The same position was taken by schol-29See Del Olmo Lete, G. 1980:49–62; 1981:487–494; 1998:143–144.30See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O., Sanmartín, J. 1995:62 (“legend (Rāpiˀūma), ritual, incanta-tion?”).31See Dietrich, M. – Loretz, O, 1997a:1306–1316.32See Pitard, W.T. 1992.33See Pardee, D. 2011.

KTU 1.161”.My opinion, already put forward in 1981, can be summarised as follows:“Halfway between myth and epic legend we find the “Saga of theRāpiʔūma”,which can also be defined as a mythical ritual, fragmentarily preserved”.39KTU 1.23This text also is labelled by KTU as “myth, incantation”. This opinion was alsoexpressed by De Moor (1980) in an unequivocal way: “The best known exam-ples (of incantation) being KTU 1.23 and 1.24”40. Nevertheless, as was the casewith KTU 1.12 and 1.13, he includes this text in hisAnthology(1987) under theheading “Myth and Ritual”, not under “Incantations”41, asserting: “Among thetablets of Ugarit there are several that combine a mythological narrative witha ritual or an incantation” (p. 117). Here the accompanying element would bea hierogamic ceremony developed during the New Year Festival, without anincantation. Other scholars followed him. Let us quote only two of them, sinceit is not worth dwelling on this question, the motive for this classificationbeing rather meagre and inconclusive, unless “incantation” is taken in a verywide and vague sense.Included among the myths and legends, for Caquot-Sznycer42this text is“un mythe culturel, grâce auquel nous entrevoyons comment des penseursing pages (411–414) different possibilities of linking together such compositions are laid out.However, the colophon of this cycle (KTU 1.19 IV 63) alludes to a repetition of a text close initself than to its continuation in a following fourth tablet. This issue is recognised as impossi-ble to demonstrate. Such a continuation then is a mere guess. This is not the place of courseto assess the other textual, linguistic and literary details of Pardee’s ingenious paper.34See Virolleaud, Ch. 1936; Virolleaud, Ch. 1941. We can safely ignore the pioneer studiesand anthologies of translated Ugaritic texts: Gordon, Jirku, Aistleitner, Gray, Driver, Rin,Caquot-Sznycer, Gibson, etc. and the same applies to the following comments on other texts.35See Caquot, A., Sznyczer, M. 1974:471–480 (463).36See Spronk, K. 1986:161–196.

Even they translate the introductoryỉqrả: “Ich beschwöre”. It is clear,therefore, that here “beschwören” assumes a meaning very close to “to in-voke”, as is also the case in KTU 1.24. On the other hand, the cosmic meaningfound here as well as the fertility defense are the general bearing of the Baalmyth and in this sense its recitation has also apotropaic intention withoutbeing because of that to be taken as a text of magic literature or an “incanta-tion” text. When in this kind of texts the cosmic hostile forces are quoted inthe Akkadian incantations, it is normally in an enumeration of evil doingscaused by a known or unknown enemy of the individual in whose benefit theformula is proclaimed. Nothing of that is here patent. We will comment moreextensively on this issue later on.In a brief introduction to his version of the text,45Pardee (1997) keeps itin the category of myth, although calling the attention to the ritual aspectsand suggesting that a harvest festival would be the most appropriate momentfor such a liturgy and the evocation of the connected myth. He is howeverreluctant to accept De Moor’s proposal that it is a hierogamy.Wyatt46, somewhat more receptive of De Moor’s theory and well aware ofthe “royal” bearing of the text, defines this “narrative poetry” adequately as“a mythic paradigm ... which is used here to convey basic notions about theconcern of the chief deity for the created order”.But the most recent and stimulating analysis of this text is by Smith,47which I have scrutinised in a rather prolix review article. In this text, Smith43See Cutler, J., Macdonald, J. 1982:33–50 (33).44See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 1988:328–357 (329) (”4. Beschwörungen gegen die schädlichenNaturkräfte (KTU 1.23)”).

M. Smith carries outas follows a close reading of this text, “of the rather complex representationof what the myths and rituals ‘are’ and ‘do’” (p. 8). It is in this ambit of “Mythand Ritual” where the scholar sets the text, namely, in that of the enactedmythology in a solemn and official liturgical setting, with the King at its head.The cosmic conflict it enacts cannot be “conjured/exorcised” by any kind ofincantation formula, it is something structural. One must get into it and acceptits ambivalent rhythm, trying to favor the equilibrium of the polar forces atthe stake. An incantation formula on the contrary aims at the destruction ofthe evil-doing force that has overridden the normal and innocent life courseof the individual. The text presents two sections, clearly differentiated (a ritualand a mythological narrative). The myth provides the sense of the rite, butdoes not get involved in it, except for the recitation level, but not for that ofits staging. The King’s presence is explicit in the text, no as an officiant, likein the sacrificial texts, but as a president and earthly guarantor of the rolethe myth develops. The King presides over and in this sense actualizes thereconciliation of the opposite forces that shape the fertility cycle, in a similarway like the supreme god presides over and sanction their reconciliation andharmonization at the end of the baalic myth (KTU 1.6 VI), introduced by theSun’s own “conversion”: fromMôtu’s obliged collaborator toBaˁlu’s defen-dant, according to her ambivalent nature of force that burns and ripens at thesame time. “What is celebrated in both the rituals and the mythic narrativesis agricultural fertility” (p. 140). This is the central idea that M. Smith developswith complete lucidity, I would even say, with great elegance.The “decodification” of this text is carried out in an ultimate manner inthe last paragraph from the starting-point of a large and illuminating intertex-tuality in which the agents as well as the scenery and alimentary code of theconfrontation are put into relief. A confrontation that, unlike theBaˁlumythand the substitute ritual of the “scapegoat”, M. Smith sees rather as an integra-tion than as a conflict.But the conflict exists, embedded in the same reality, as was pointed out.M. Smith himself realises the ambiguity/ambivalence even of the desert. Thesame godMôtuisˀIlu’s son, belong into his family, likeBaˁlu, their own sonsareŠaḥru/Šalimuas well as the devoringỉlm nʕmm, which M. Smith considerdifferent couples, what I believe unnecessary. Precisely it is starting from thispolarity of nature and its vital cycle, as the Canaanite mythical thinking con-ceives it (life+death,Baˁlu+Môtu), that it must be considered “one” but at thesame time intrinsically “dual”. And it is in the cult where the staging andreconciliation of this binary/polar opposition takes place, as M. Smith devel-ops quite well."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"90Dubious and Incorrectly Identified Ugaritic Incantation TextsUgaritic mythology (as well as other several mythologies and theologies)figures out the configuration of the cosmos by means of a play of oppositionsof what we are used to interpret as positive and negative forces of good andbad, life and death, of the two oceans ... The most appealing dramatic perform-ance of such a contrast is provided by the baalic myth (KTU 1.1–6) with itsdouble fight betweenBaˁluandYammu, and betweenBaˁluandMôtu. A minorversion, perhaps more popular and close is provided by KTU 1.12 (see above).In their turn, each of those gods shows his own polarisation and ambiva-lence of forces. But it is above all the godŠapšu, the Sun, the deity that bestexemplifies this ambiguity of the divine, as already mentioned. She (the Sunis feminine in Ugarit) is decidedly a collaborator ofBaˁlu, of life (KTU 1.6 I 8–15, IV 17–20, VI 22–29), and life-giver to the dead (KTU 1.6 VI 45–48; 1.161:18–19), but at the same time a manifest and necessary collaborator of death, ofMôtu, carrying out his function of destroyer of life (KTU 1.4 VIII 21–24; 1.6 II 24–25). The Sun ripens the seeds and the fruits, but at the same time scorches theplants and the fields; she causes both harvest and drought. Both functions areintrinsically correlative to such a point that one cannot exist without the other.In this sense, the ripe grain may be considered a gift ofBaˁluas well as ofMôtu/Šapšu. Môtuhimself, the prototype of death and the irreconcilable antag-onist ofBaˁlu, was fittingly shattered and put to death (death’s death!) byˁAnatu, and so becomes the principle of life (KTU 1.6 II 30–35).If we take into account this structure of the divine personality in theCanaanite religion of life and death, I think that the coupleŠaḥru/Šalimuandthe “devouring”ỉlm nʕmm, sired byˀIlu, the same personalities, in their doublefacet of beneficent deities, ofˀIlu’s family, and of harmful scorching Sun’s col-laborators, lord of the scorched land (mdbr), to which ambit they are attached“beside the Sun and the Stars” (KTU 1.23:59), are just a single couple. Theyshare consequently the Sun’s ambiguous nature, as avatars of her ambit48(Dawn and Dusk); likeNikkalumay be taken asYarḫu’s avatar (his brightness;see KTU 1.24:38). That not means that a celestial body has to be found thatrepresents them. We could say that they are not “astral” but “celestial” deities.If M. Smith’s suggestion is accepted, KTU 1.23 would put in scene thereconciliation of both facets of those deities, as a cultual experience of theclear consciousness of the mutual implication of life and death, that the myth-ological conception of the fertility cycle shows up in Ugarit. It would be onemore variation on the same and fundamental theme of which KTU 1.12 wouldbe another version. The parched steppe gods are admitted to enjoy of the fruitsthat ripen under their heat. They, like the Sun, are deities, unavoidable forces48Seesupraprevious p."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"KTU 1.2491that must be propitiated to guarantee their benefit and escape their excess.They are ambiguous but indispensable deities. And it is precisely this ambigu-ity, inherent in their function, that allows and counsels taking them asnʕmm,“goodly gods”.This hymnic and commemorative liturgy celebrate them with several ritu-als that enhance their beneficent function. To such manifold ritual celebrationthehieròs lógosis attached that explains their origin and justifies as followstheir commemoration: they areˀỈlu’s sons,Šapšu’s assistants. However, thetext does not allow us to decide whether this mytheme was recited as a partof the ritual or was simply taken for granted. Taking into account the redun-dant nature of ancient Near Eastern cults, the first suggestion turns out to bethe most likely.The suggestion that this text may either be or contain an incantation is nolonger even mentioned by scholars.KTU 1.24We have already seen De Moor’s first opinion (1980), but as in the case of KTU1.23, he places also this text in hisAnthology(1987) under the section “Mythand Ritual”, and takes it, evidently, as a text comprising a mythological sectionand a final hymn, the whole to be recited “while the bride-price was beingweighed out”. Its classification as an “incantation” is completely set aside. –For Caquot-Sznycer (1974)49also the text was made out of a beginning and aclosing of hymnic nature that enclose a narrative recitation ofYarḫu-Nikkalu’swedding. – Similarly Wyatt (1998).50– In their turn, Dietrich-Loretz are cate-goric: “KTU1.24 gehört ... zum Genre der mythologischen Texte”.51In their finalassessment they cling to this way of thinking speaking of a text used in wed-dings, although allowing that in the hymnic last part theKaṯirātuwere also“beschwört” and that even the mythical recitative “diente dem Zweck, dieFruchtbarkeit der Ehe zu beschwören”.52This position seems to derive from,or at least coincide with the approach to the question maintained by the lastcommentator on this text whom they sum up, G. Theuer. According to Dietrich-Loretz this scholar sees it as “die Kombination von mythisch-erzählendem Teil49See Caquot, A., Sznycer, M. 1974: 383ff.50See Wyatt, N. 1998a:336.51See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2000a:145 (with a complete survey of previous opinions); seealso Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2001:203–207; Del Olmo Lete, G. 2007a:155–160 (162–164).52See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2000a: 212.

Consequently theclassification of this text as myth must be revised. Its structure presents it asa “Beschwörungsritual” to guarantee a happy childbirth. Actually Theuer nei-ther in the “Erläuterungen zum Text” nor in the “Literarische Analyse” of lines40–50, “Fazit” and Interpretation of “Beschwörung derkṯrt”, substantiateshis opinion, rather he gives for granted that we have here a “Beschwörung”,introduced by the hymnic invitationảšr.54The only serious textual argumentshe affords is the parallelismspr/mntin lines 45–47: “Diese Kennzeichnungder folgenden Zeilen als ‘Rezitation’ und ‘Beschwörung(sformel)’ leitet die nunfolgende Anrufung der Eigennamen der siebenkṯrt-Göttinen im Sinne ihrerBeschwörung ein”.55But this cursory (nine lines) semantic simplification doesnot take into consideration the polysemy ofmnt, pointed out by the lexicogra-phers,56dictated in this case by the two-direction parallelism (//spr) and aboveall by the contents of the formula: simple invocation/enumeration of divinenames, without any injunction against any evil or evil-doer. The repeatedbringing near of “Anrufung” and “Beschwörung” clearly points out that weare facing here a question of linguistic correspondence, German “Beschwö-rung” being the equivalent of English “conjuration” (invocation of presence)57not of “incantation” in the precise sense we assume here in respect of magicand witchcraft. So the text will be fit better into the category of ritualisedmyths than in that of magic literature, like previous texts.KTU 1.65The question mark in KTU (“incantation?”) has no textual and formal supportwhatever; this classification comes from the first editor’s interpretation.58Actually, Dietrich-Loretz classify it as an “Opfer”.59Other scholars suggest arange of classifications: Obermann: “Psalm of thanksgiving”;60Xella: “preghi-53See Theuer, G. 2000:135–249.54See Theuer, G. 2000:158, 185–194, 199–200, 216–217, 234.55See Theuer, G. 2000:192 and n. 345.56See DUL 564f.57See above p. v, n. 2.58See Dhorme, É. 1933: 231–35.59See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 1988:318f.60See Obermann, J. 1936: 1 (“An Antiphonal Psalm from Ras-Shamra”)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"KTU 1.8393era” (?);61Wyatt: “Prayer for the security of Ugarit”;62Pardee: “Deity list”.63See Del Olmo Lete for his classification of this text as a litany prayer.64KTU 1.75The text is entirely fragmentary and nothing reliable can be asserted regardingits genre; the mention of ]mnty[ anddbḥmit is not enough to warrant anyhypothesis beyond a mere guess.65Nevertheless, it hints strongly at the exis-tence of many more texts of this kind than the very few recognised as such.KTU 1.83As in the previous text, the presence of several lexical items (ym, lḥk, lšn,ḫt...) in this fragmentary text is not enough of a criterion to classify it as an“incantation”.66It is almost unanimously considered to be a mythical fragment(see KTU 101)67, except by De Moor,68with his idiosyncratic translation of thetext. G. Massini also follows this opinion, pointing out the ESA substratum ofthe mythological motif.69“In fact, I commented in my analysis of the text, there are also some othertexts very close to it in meaning, for instance, KTU 1.4 VII 52–57; 1.5 I 1–7; 1.8II 5–7.

Its repetitive character (seven repeti-tions, perhaps) suggest that it is a type of liturgical hymn that was a perfectentry-song or invitatory for the second part or reverse of the tablet.”77To myknowledge, only De Moor had suggested the classification of this text as an“incantation” in an early paper (1970),78but it is not included in hisAnthology(1987) under this label.KTU 1.114This text, found in the 1961 campaign, was published by Virolleaud under thetitle “Le festin du Père des dieux”.79Many scholars have treated the text, nota few taking it as a piece of burlesque literature (Loewenstamm, Margulis,Pope, Xella, Margalit, De Moor, Caquot).80However, Caquot ends his introduc-tion to the text with these words: “... le texte, en racontant comment le dieuEl s’était enivré et remis, avait en luí-même une vertu medicinale: la recetteétait bonne, sans doute parce que le grand dieu l’avait éprouvée”. Its classifi-cation as an “incantation” was natural and easy. In fact it was included underthe heading “Tablettes mythico-magiques”. This opinion is repeated in KTU81(“incantation for medical treatment”) and more clearly still, in Dietrich-Lo-retz’s version it has been called “Beschwörung gegen Folgen der Trunken-heit”.82Consequently, “Angesichts entsprechender Parallelen aus Mesopota-mien haben wir es bei KTU 1.114 mit einem Text jenes Genre zu tun, dasKrankheitsbeschwörungen bietet: Eine mythologische Einleitung mit nachfol-gender medizinische Instruktion.” But these scholars are fully aware of theinadequacy of the parallelism quoted and add in a note: “In Mesopotamienist, anders als hier, eine Verbindung beider Abschnitte durch Hinweise aufeine Beschwörung und ein Ritual belegt”. That is to say, what is missing hereis precisely the “Beschwörung”, the “incantation”, the specific intervention oftheāšipu, this time also without the compulsory diagnosis, only implicit inthe mythical narrative, which usually does not have such a prominent place77See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:143–146.

This is either the degen-eration a literary form or rather another type of text that can be labelled myth-ico-magical(-medical) (seesupra).Looking attentively at the two Mesopotamian texts quoted by Dietrich-Loretz, the difference with KTU 1.114 is obvious, regarding the incantationgenre. The mythico-cosmic evocation has a completely different bearing, theinvocation or recourse to the deities by a human is completely missing. Theclassification of the situation as provoked by an “evil-doer” has disappearedand the remedy becomes generic, irrespective of any enemy attack or personalsin that may have provoked it. On the other hand, the mythical motif has lostits epic-tragic tune recalling the power and fight of the great gods against theforce of evil, spirits and wizards, and their seclusion in the netherworld. Whatwe have now is a burlesque narrative in which the supreme god loses hisdignity and power, an anthropomorphic representation of the divine that isvery reminiscent of Greek mythology. More significantly yet, the evolution ofthe genre and its practice appears above all in the lack of injunction clausesinvoking the destruction and reversion of evil on the evil-doer, an aspect sostrongly manifest in the actual incantation formulas. These usually react notonly against the evil, but first of all against its agent. I do not think that herethe “Therapeut” is supposed to assume the function of a “Beschwörer” (at themost that of theāsû) and that the recitation of the story has “die übernatür-liche Kräfte für das von ihm eingesetzten Heilmittel”.83The force, I think, liesin the remedy itself whose divine origin and efficacy the story guarantees. Thegoddesses go in search of the remedy and find it. They neither create it norteach people to pronounce an incantation formula in this connection. Thestory has the role of ahieròs lógos, which explains and establishes the efficacyof such a medical and gestural/ritual procedure. So the text turns out to be asort of mythico-medical aetiology. We are quite remote from strict incantationsor magic literature.Leaving that aside, the coincidence with the analysis of the text providedby Dietrich-Loretz is almost complete, principally its function in terms of mythand magic. In fact, medical texts as a whole are essentially magic, sometimesincluding “incantation” formulas, but already the evil situation has becomeneutral and impersonal and its solution is a generic remedy for anybody touse. The transition from one moment to the other is very fluid, and theevilspiritscontinue to be the actual agents of illness.

In this perspective, Caquot thinks, asalready mentioned, that “la recette était bonne, sans doute parce que le granddieu l’avait éprouvée”.87The story then is just “exemplar” in genre. Pardee inhis turn, after his protracted textual and lexical analysis, briefly sums up themeaning of this “para-mythological” text as an “occasional” myth “dont le butétait de garantir l’éfficacité de la recette”88. In this regard, Wyatt’s definitionof this text as “a medical text” is quite correct.89In his turn, Lewis does nottake a clear position on this issue.90KTU 1.124This is a unique example among the Ugaritic ritual texts and as such its classi-fication is not easy to determine. I follow the opinion that considers it to be a“cultic consultation” carried out by the king in the context of the dynastic cultof the dead royal ancestors.91It belongs then within a specific cultic contextthat is closer to divination than to magic incantation praxis. In fact, no incan-85Very interesting are the suggestions on themarziḥuas a “königlicher Ahnenkult”, whichincluded the consumption of wine: “Von diesem kultischen Hintergrund her wird deutlich,dass dasmarziḥudes Königs von Ugarit als ein Abbild der himmlischenmarziḥuEls verstandenwurde” (p. 488).

I think that to classify a text like this, we have to start from itsaimwhich refers to a well-known functional and literary magical genre of the ancient NearEast (see e.g. the fine anthology of “Texte zur Heilkunde” provided inTUATNeue Folge 5,2010) and not from the “historiola”, which has a mere functional and subordinate, althoughvery colourful role (Pardee 2002b:167–170). I find more adequate, although somehow exagger-ated, this scholar’s opinion who sees here “a serious attempt, even a scientific one... at dealingwith the after effects of an evening spent on the benches of themrzḥ” (see Pardee,D.1997d:303; see also Pardee, D. 1988:74). On the other hand, its position in the index underthe heading “Divination” does not seem very suitable in this case.89See Wyatt, N. 1998a: 404–413.90See Lewis, Th.J. 1997:193–196.

The action prescribed in the first place (the bringingof different plants as an offering for two temples) may correspond to theentreaty or prayer formula and the final offering that we also find in the incan-tation texts. But the most surprising aspect in this regard is to have here thegodsḤorānuandBaˁlu(in that order) as the deities to be entreated jointly andwhose role we know is decisive in the incantation texts.93KTU 1.124 combines,then, elements of cult divination/consultation, incantation text and prophylac-tic praxis as an outstanding example of the overlap of cult, magic and medi-cine and their literary and functional elements as mentioned earlier.94Bytransposing these elements, we can conclude that the “patron deities” areḥrn+bʕl.

It could be interpreted as a kind of “formaland national” claim.

The king of Ugarit is asked “to judge the case of the widow and theorphan” (KTU 1.17 V 7–9; see also 1.16 VI 33–34), but no mention is made of the “residentstranger” (gr) in this connection. The mention of thegrin KTU 1.40:35 (18) occurs in combina-tion with the “sons and daughters of Ugarit” as equal subjects ofmšr,“redemption/expiation”without any opposition between them. They appear as full citizens of Ugarit and some admin-istrative texts suggest they were even officially recorded in the census. The opposition appearsbetween these foreign residents (gr ḥmyt ủgrt) and the foreign peoples mentioned subse-quently. The different relationship with these two groups may be reflected in the biblicalattitude towards thegērîmand the foreign nations addressed by the prophetic oracles. TheHittites, at least, must have had the means to defend and enforce their own rights, alreadypolitically guaranteed by a treaty. For the opposite situation in the ANE and in Israel in thisregard, see Zehnder, M. 2005; Aschenbach, R., Albertz, R., Wöhrle, J., eds. 2011. In ancientIsrael, the attitude towards foreigners oscillates between the programmed annihilation andbanishment of the enemy as a policy during the conquest together with prophetic curses onoppression by the empires and surrounding peoples during the period of the kingdom (alongwith the rejection of any contact in the postexilic community) and a humanitarian attitudeafter Israel had settled in the land. A late example of this (the Khirbet Qeyafa inscription) canbe seen in Galil, G. 2009:196; Naˁaman, N. 2010; Puech, É. 2010; Aschenbach, R. 2012."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Appendices105those foreign nations.

Prob-able we are here face to the commontóposof the “seven enemies”, so well-known among the peoples of the ancient Near East,111with no relationshipwhatever to the actual political situation.Another possible interpretation is provided by witchcraft literature. As wehave seen above, the evil-doer, either a witch or a warlock, can slander aperson and spread calumnies that may induce the gods’ anger against thevictim of the slander as if he really had committed such sins. That was thefunction of thedābibu/bēl dabābiin Mesopotamia,112also present in Ugariticincantation texts (KTU 1.169:1, 9; 1.178:9, 11:kšpm dbbm).

First come the ritual attempts to get rid of thesekinds of imputed sin having the force of witchcraft and so more insidious thanpure moral responsibility, which comes second; finally, cultic faults are listed.However, culpability, from less serious to most grave, can be evaluated ineither direction. But beside this lexical equivalence, we have support fromMesopotamian literary practice.

Perhaps the people of those nations wereconsidered particularly “zauberkündig” as Thomsen suggests,117but moreprobably it was assumed that their military power was backed by witchcraftactivity, which provoked the enemy’s own national god to abandon them.Political activity is always viewed as the outcome of opposing divine forces. Itis one’s own god who gives victory. In this connection, Tz.

In the case of KTU 1.82, the distribu-tion of the text into different units, separated by empty spaces and ruled lines,leaves no doubt in this regard. Drawing on De Moor-Spronk’s pioneeringstudy,3Caquot stressed this point some time ago, qualifying the text as “unrecueil de formules magiques”.4He even makes what seems to us to be a verysignificant assertion, namely that in this text, in contrast to KTU 1.100, “il nesemble pas y avoir continuité d’un paragraphe à l’autre, et il n’est pas mêmecertain que dans un paragraphe ilyaunenchaînement cohérent de phrases”.5On the other hand, Virolleaud thought that “il s’agit, autant qu’on enpuisse juger, d’une dialogue entre Baal et Anat, au lendemain de la victoireremportée par Baal sur le dragon Tannin”. This mythological perspective wasfollowed by other scholars.6Following my first provisional interpretation,7I assume that this tabletcontains a miscellaneous text comprising perhaps eight8magical incantation1Leaving aside the large text collections such asMaqlûandŠurpu, for miscellaneous incanta-tion texts see for instance Ambusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:v–viii (“Contents”).2For the syllabic texts cf. Nougayrol, J. 1978:29f.; Arnaud, D. 2007:77–88 (nº 21: “Collectiond’incantations [RS 15.152 // 17.155]”); Arnaud, D. 2007:90–96 (nº 25–26: “Recueil de rituels etd’incantations” (RS 25.456 B) planche XII); “Incantations et rituels médico-magiques” (RS94.2067, planche XIII); and perhaps also Arnaud 2007: 98s.

The first collation of this text wasprovided by Virolleaud (1957:3–7). Van Zijl’s set of articles was never finished and dealt onlywith lines 1–7. In general in this paper I will not point out the differences in reading andinterpretation put forward by the different scholars in each case. This is not very helpful in atext as damaged as this one and encourages guesswork and undemonstrable hypotheses; Iam also well aware of the hypothetic character of my own suggestions.7See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:320–326.8The damaged state of the heading on the reverse precludes any definite conclusion."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"110KTU 1.82: A Miscellaneous Incantation/Anti-Witchcraft Text against Snakebiteformulae against snakebite, a genre of magic literature that is well representedat Ugarit.9But unlike texts such as KTU 1.169, also a miscellaneous text, KTU1.82 does not belong to the category of anti-witchcraft literature, that is, textsto ward off the effects of maliciously induced snakebite,10but rather to thegenre of magic prophylactic incantation formulae, much in line with KTU1.107.11As is well known, texts of this kind include many elements of prayerand entreaty to the deities invoked, but also elements of ritual and prescriptionto cure the harm and oracles or words of those deities. These elements areusually separated by ruled lines.12The actual magical texts have a much moredeveloped structure and possibly their prototype is to be found in the ritualsagainstzikurudū-witchcraft13and in its parallels the “Serpent-namburbis” fromthe first millennium.14Additional and very significant support for this suggestion is provided bythe use of the same vocabulary and the same motifs as those present in thecanonical Ugaritic texts of the genre. We will emphasise them in the transla-tion, enhancing the lexical elements that are most important in this regard.For the readings we rely on a new autopsy of the text carried out in earlyMarch 2011. The new photos, taken on this occasion by the deposition ofammonium chloride method, are particularly useful in view of the poor stateof the tablet, especially in its burnt black part, which has made its studyparticularly difficult in the past.15In the following pages we present the new collation of the text along withits lay-out and a brief epigraphic and philological commentary, without spend-ing much time on the various interpretations which, as we said above, aremainly the result of the different readings. These I will attempt to emphasiseand make clear.9See Clemens, D.M. 2001:699f.10See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:399–424.11See Clemens, D.M. 2001:598, 614ff., 699f., 741ff., 1114 n. 124.12See Clemens, D.M. 2001:219.13See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:15f.14See Pientka-Hinz, R. 2009:212.15Neither Xella, P.

II, III a–g)Lines 1–2:The initial /m/ is a mere guess: the tablet is erased at this pointand the traces do not guarantee this reading17(Pl. III a–b); in this case, lackingepigraphic evidence, we rely on contextual congruence (see later on: “2. –Lexical and philological analysis”). The following sign is correctly read /ḫ/ (seell. 36–37:ảḫt, drḫm). But what seems at first sight to be a misreading is theword /bʕl/: its first sign appears to be a /ṭ/. The normal form of this signappears in line 7 (prṭl, ṭmṯ), while a clumsy /b/ like this is also seen in thefourth sign of line 4 (bqr), thenormalsign form /b/ appearing in lines 3 (bn,lbh)and4(b ḫlb), making allowances for a certain divergence in the scribalhandwriting. The final /l/ is in turn a reconstruction, since we have only twovertical wedges (/ṣ/), the presumed third one actually corresponding to theborder of the following erasure. Nevertheless, the reconstruction seems reason-able. So the reading /bʕl/, in spite of the anomalies, can be taken as accept-able.The final horizontal wedge of a /k/ or /r/ can still be seen (there is spacefor two signs at least in the erasure), which may simply be read as /t/, followedby -yand three other signs. These are read in Virolleaud’s collation astnn,Tunnānu. Once again the presumed contextual preconception dictates the epi-graphic transcription. In fact, the signs could also be read as /tản/, /ttn/ oreven /ảản/ (Pl. III c–d), taking into account the traces of wedges that the threesigns show (see the sequencelttnin line 43 (Pl. III e) and the writingtnnin17The sign /m/ is clearly formed everywhere else in the text. Here, instead, the traces pointto the reading /ṣ/, with the separator a little lower than usual."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"114KTU 1.82: A Miscellaneous Incantation/Anti-Witchcraft Text against SnakebiteKTU 1.3 III 4018). But to read the second one as an /n/ seems unjustified, sinceno trace of a triple wedge is to be seen. On the other hand, a fourth closingsign /t/ should not be ruled out. Let us leave the reading open for the moment.The last complete word is unanimously read aswynsk, but the last signappears to be a /w/, the two series of horizontal wedges being quite visible.But the contextual meaning (see later “4.Lexical and philological analysis”)argues in favour of the accepted reading. The trace of a separator afterwynskis very slight, while the attached line may correspond to a /t/ (?) followed bya wedge read as /ʕ/; of a /d/ there is no acceptable trace. However, once weaccept the mythological reference, a parallel restorationʕ[tk(see KTU 1.3 III 41/44), the name of another primordial monster, could be suggested.19The rest of the text does not present particular difficulties. The reconstruc-tion [ỉ][d]y(KTU) is based on the parallel presence of the lexeme later in theline.Lines 3–5a:The readings in these lines are quite clear. Nevertheless, the read-ingḥẓis dubious, as it is based more on the presumed lexico-mythologicalcontext (Rašpuand the arrows20) than on epigraphic evidence; the sign /ẓ/ ispartly erased. On the other hand, there seems to be no clear separator betweenbnandkmand the first word could also be read as /bt/. The beginning of line4 is also unclear and a readingbqrseems epigraphically preferable (see alsoline 40) tobġr(Virolleaud, KTU), a reading that the parallelism (//ḫlb) never-theless favours.Lines 5b–7:epigraphically, the readingbrtk(KTU) is clear, consequently thesuggested readingbrqkmust be excluded. The readingd/bgdis also quiteclear (the accepted readingủḫdis impossible)21, but the interpretation is verydifficult. Taking into consideration the possible parallel pair (prṭl)22, we favourthe readingbgd, hinted at already by the double lower horizontal stroke,18For different writings oftnnsee KTU 1.3 III 40 (Smith, M.S., Pitard, W.T. 2009:CD) (seePl. III g) and KTU 1.6 VI 51 (cf. CTA, pl. xii–xiii) (Pl. III f). As a simple guess, either of thesuggested readings could be accepted, both within the semantic field of “sight” (/ʕ-n-y/) andof mourning (/y-t-n 〈ql〉/): For this meaning of /y-t-n/ see DUL 991 (ytn g),652 (ntn); see alsotảnt, “groaning” (DUL 855). On the meanings of “voice” fortnn, see DUL 873.19De Moor’s reconstructionʕ[dt], “menstruation” (Heb.ˁiddāh; see below line 7), is also verypertinent. See in this regard the version by Schmitt, R. 2004:81. His reading of line 1 (mḫs.b?)reflects the difficulties discussed above.20See Fulco, W.J. 1976:69; Van Zijl, P.J. 1974:86–89.21See Miglio, A.E. 2013:41f., who retains this reading, arguing from a “subsequent effacementof the tablet” (/ḫ/ > /g/). He also prefers the readingbrqk(p. 39). See Del Olmo Lete, G.2014b:forthcoming.22For a possible Akkadian parallel (piriduluš) see De Moor, J.C. 1984:240."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Epigraphic commentary (Fig. I–II; Pl.

For the readingảṭm prṭlsee line19.23Lines 8–14:The preserved text exhibits no problems, apart from the numerouserasures, and the grammatical sense of the clauses is reasonably clear. As inline 1, the traces and the congruence of the subject speaking (1 p. sg.24) wouldsuggest the reading [ỉ]dbr: “[behold,] I proclaim: my offering is two rams”. Inline 11, the reading ]tʕ.qsrm, when enlarged (200%), is clear for epigraphicreasons (the traces in the tablet after /t/ cannot be taken as a separator, whichappears after the /ʕ/). Notice, however, the crack in the tablet that prevents aclear image of the sign /q/, while the first traces, usually read /ʕn/, are lessthan certain. There is an erasure that deforms a possible sign /n/. On the otherhand, the readingšzrmseems quite improbable, epigraphically and semanti-cally, at least as far as the sign /š/ is concerned.Lines 15–19:The autopsy and the new contrasted photos, suitably enlarged,allow a different reading of the beginning of line 15. In contrast, the readingḫrp/ḫkpin line 18 and the reading of the rest of the line are mere guesses.Provisionally, we assume the previous reading and interpretation (see further).For the reading and interpretation ofảṭm prṭlcompare line 7.Lines 20–30:This section is of special interest because the burned surfacedoes not allow either an easy autopsy or the possibility of clear photography.The photo obtained by the contrast method is especially helpful and allowsus to put forward several divergent and more convincing readings. But thegeneral meaning remains beyond our reach.The reading ]lmntsupposes that the state of the tablet was different fromthe present one: the first character seen today is a clear /g/, the presumed /m/is a reconstruction, and there is no trace of the /l/.There is no point in insisting on the new readings, since the fragmentarystate of the text does not allow any semantic validation. A close look at thephotos provided may help us to decide between them.Lines 31–37:The first point to mention regarding this section of the text isthat the traces of a ruled line between lines 34/35 are very slight; thosebetween lines 35/36 are clear indeed, but much feebler than those of the lines23A mere guess; cf.

This means thatthe reverse of the tablet most probably had four sections like the obverse,taking into account the upper part of the text that is lost.Lines 38–43:the variant readings put forward in this section are not verysignificant.

Possibly a /k/ wasintended at first but it remained incomplete (see line 10lpny]). And of the endof line 41 there is no trace visible afterḥrnand before the /k/ in the edge; atthis point there is a crack in the tablet.

In any case, themythological motif and situation are the same, as is the semantics of /mḫš/ and /mḫṣ/.27See Virolleaud, Ch. 1957:3.28See Finkel, I.L. 1999:226f; Abusch, Tz. 2002:189. As in the case of the readingʕntinsteadofʕnnin the heading of KTU 1.96 (seeinfrapp. 129ff.), Virolleaud’s reading of the first signsas [x]mḫṣ.bʕl[ has determined the mythological bias that has guided the interpretation of thetext as a whole. But this reading is far from certain as the autopsy and the photo of the tabletcertify.[Had the reading /ṭ/ for /b/ been accepted, as suggested above,Baˁluwould disappear fromthe scene in this line.

The motif is not infrequent there either (see KTU 1.100:68–69).29Inthis regard, the new anti-witchcraft text against snakebite KTU 1.178:12 pro-vides the most significant parallel to our text:yšp[k].k mm.arṣ, “May (the foul-mouthed sorcerers) be poured out like water on the earth”.30On the otherhand, the subject/object here are a mere guess.This section introduces a concept,ảlt, basic in this genre, which has itsparallel in Akk.mamītuin its double meaning of “oath” and “curse” (AHw599f.; CAD M/1 189ff).31An exclamatory spell very close to our text can befound in theUšburruda Heilmittel RitualsA₂ obv. 1:49’:mamītu mamītu ullalkiscribe incises these multi-headed vertical wedges. The resulting text ][m?].ỉṣ.ṭʕṣ[ is indeedincomprehensible, so that the alternative readingỉṣ{.}ṭʕṣ[ could be suggested (starting fromthe dictum “when a Semitic text is not understood it is because it is badly read”), assumingan erroneously placed separator, an scribal error found elsewhere in Ugaritic, an error thatpossibly is also present in the readingmḫṣ, since traces of a possible separator before theassumed /ḥ/ are visible. This reading may seem strange at first sight, but plainly it is lexically,morphologically and thematically guaranteed. A nominal base /ṣ-ʕ-ṣ/ occurs in Ugaritic andspecifically in our text (lines 18/41) in the context of snake attack (see later). It could beunderstood as a 1 p.(?) Dt pconj. (or verbal noun) with the corresponding regressive assimila-tion of /t/ to /ṭ/ in contact with /ṣ/. We have here the reduced form /ṣ-ʕ-ṣ/ of a reduplicated /ṣ-ʕ-ṣ-ʕ/, derived from the simple base /ṣ-V-ʕ/. This is occurs frequently in Arabic (*ṣ-w-ʕ/ṣ-y-ʕ) with the basic meaning “to disperse” (AEL 1745, the meaning “to measure, collect”, isdenominative) as a result of a sudden attack “from the sides” and the concomitant “frighten-ing” (according to theQāmusand theˀObāb, as recorded by Lane: “to frighten”); in passive-reflexive formstaṣawwaʕa, ˀinṣāʕa, “to be scattered, to go away quickly” (“suddenly”, Sp.“estampida”),taṣayyaʕa, “to become in a state of commotion” >ˀaṣyaʕ-, “to be in an state ofcommotion, of exceeding commotion”. The reduplicated form usually reflects the basic mean-ing better (see Del Olmo Lete, G. 2010d:79):ṣaʕṣaʕa, “disperser” and “remuer”,taṣaʕṣaʕa,“être remué, agité” (see DAF 1339; De Moor, J.C., Spronk, K. 1984:244); Syr.ˀṣṭʕṣʕ, “to attack”(SL 1296; W.E.Watson’s private communication). Consequently, we can assume the meaning“fright, dread, terror” (< “attack”) forṣʕṣand that of “to be distressed by fright, terror” forỉṣṭʕṣ. This reflects a basic category in Akkadian anti-witchcraft literature where incantationsoften begin with a man’s dread.

It can be understoodconfidently as “divination, omen”, Akk.bārûtu,42which supposes the consul-tation of a diviner (bārû) in daily life, of common use in the world of magicactivities and so it appears also in the Akkadian of Ugarit: “le roi d’Ougaritécrit au roi de Sidon à propos d’unebārûtupour son bateau qui n’est pasbonne”.43In this contexttġrmcould be interpreted according to the Arabic semanticsofġarama: “to pay, to become obligatory upon him”, or otherwise, assuminga form D (?) “to make one pay, commit him to”: “if your forecast makes pay/commits/ascribes (you) toMôtu/death...”; namely, in either formula: “if youare condemned to death”.44The mention ofmtcorresponds to the cry addressed toŠapšu: ḥw, “savelife!”,45which has a splendid reconstructed parallel in the anti-witchcraft textfrom Boğazköiana pišerti kišpī, 115:šu limūt-ma anāku lubluṭ, “let him (thesorcerer) die, but let me live!”.4641See G.

On the other hand the Semitic base may correspondto Akkadianḫarảmu/arāmu/erēmuthat has a general sense “to cover” (CAD A II 228f.) andin this case an expression like Ludlul II 81: [ri?]-du-ut mūtu i-te-rim panija, “Death’s persecu-tion has covered my face,” (See W.G. Lambert,Babylonian Wisdom Literature, Oxford 1975,p. 42) become highly close in meaning to our text: “if your forecast to death covers (you) ”. Asecondary meaning of this base is also in Akk. “to place a tablet in a clay case”, namely, “toseal it, declare the case settled” (CAD A II 229):ina ṭuppi išṭur e-ri-im ib-r[i-im], “he wrote (theoracle query) on a tablet, put it in a clay case, sealed it”; “the act seems to have had definitelegal connotations”. Then a possible version would be: “if it is sealed to death your forecast/omen”, namely, “if a death sentence has been passed on you”. For linguistic reason I haveadopted the first proposal as the most simple and straightforward, not without some reserves.Nevertheless in regard to this question of linguistics correspondences it must be taken intoaccount the full and perfect semantic parallel between Akk. (ḫ)a:erā:ēmu, “to stretch, place(a membrane, skin) over an object, body”, and Akk.qarāmu, “to overlay” (CAD Q 127) , “über-ziehen mit” (AHw 902) , with good Sem. parallels: Aram.qrm, “to form a film, crust”,qerāmā’,“membrane, thin skin” (DJBA 1043); Heb.qrm, “to cover” (HALOT 1144). That led me stray ina first moment (readingyqrm) and prompted me to propose the translation: “if your constitu-tion is covered with the skin of death”. Are we in front of two allophones?

Similarly it is likely that, as it will beseen later on, KTU 1.107 is also an incantation/prescription against snakebite,but its condition is so poor that no further definition is possible. The presenttext could be considered a Ugaritic composition in the wake of the Mesopota-mian incantation/ritual texts againstzikurudûwitchcraft, which uses smallrodents as a vehicle for its evil-doing:zikurudâ ša ṣēri šikki arrabi pirurūti,“(Lebens)abschneidung mit Hilfe einer Schlange, mit Hilfe eines Mungos, mitHilfe einesarrabu-Maus, mit Hilfe einespirurūtu-Maus ...” (Maqlû IV 61).64As in the case of the Akkadian texts, the main sections of this series ofmiscellaneous texts are indicated by a ruled line separating them.65In turn,each section is formed by several sub-sections that are homogeneous in lengthand stichometric structure (protasis/apodosis, tricola, bicola), sometimesintroduced by the conditional/temporal functorhm(Akk.šumma), as far as itis possible to verify its presence in the preserved text.661.The first section (lines 1–7) is formed by three subsections (the conjunctionhmis only extant in the second), which show a thematic progression.According to the general opinion that we accept here (with the provisosmentioned above), the first part (lines 1–2) appears to open with a genericreference to a mythological motif (the victory ofBaˁluover the serpentine mon-sterTunnānu/Lôtānu(?) (KTU 1.5 I 1–3) (seeˁAnatu’s victory over the sameprimordial animal; also KTU 1.114)).67This intervention is the best way to avertthe impending danger and its effects: the (divine) curse as a punishment forthe culpability induced by an act of witchcraft, presumably in this case the62See already Virolleaud, Ch. 1957:7.63See Veldhuis, N. 1999:35–48.64See Schwemer, D. 2007: 63, 155; Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:15–16.65See Clemens, D.M. 2001:219 and 742ff. for the thematic sequence.66See Caquot, A. 1989:64 for line 5b; see also in this regard KTU 1.127:26ff.67The recent study of Miglio, A.E. 2013, develops this issue, possibly too systematically."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124KTU 1.82: A Miscellaneous Incantation/Anti-Witchcraft Text against Snakebitepresence of a reptile in the house.68Mythological introductions of this kind toanti-witchcraft series are frequent in this genre in Mesopotamian literature.The second sub-section (lines 3–5a) seems to allude to a divinely causedillness affecting a member of the household (a bicolon, the protasis). Prayerto the gods is proposed as the way to avert this calamity (two bicola, theapodosis); another possibility would be to look for remedies (cf. KTU1.114:22ff.; see later for the use of plants to this effect). The use of prayer andof plant remedies is also common in Akkadian literature of this kind.The third sub-section (lines 5b–7) supposes that the situation has becomedesperate (colon, protasis). Divine intervention by the deities charged withthis task, the godsŠapšuandBaˁlu, is called for (apodosis; bicolon+tricolon).The text strongly recalls the language of KTU 1.100:2ff., the canonical textsagainst snakebite (ql l špš...;l bʕl...),69while the reference to the “serpents”(bṯm/nḥš) makes plain the situation and context of the incantation, which inthe first two sub-sections remained concealed.For the mention ofḥwin line 6 see line 19 (ảḥw). Forql špšsee KTU1.100:1 as already pointed out. From this text and from KTU 1.107, the specialintervention of the deityŠapšuin incantations against snakebite is evident.70Assuming the haplography of [l]špš, the expression is remarkably similar to:qrỉt lšpš ... ql bl ...(see KTU 1.100:2). In fact, we do not need to assume thisomission or a coalescence if we parseảrrnas a factitive form with a doubleaccusative or else we analyseql špšas a syntagm in the construct state: “thecry for help of/toŠapšu”, as a prototype of resorting to magic which KTU 1.100develops (cf. the Hebrew constructionweṣidqātekā yerannēnû, Ps. 145:7). Alsorelevant is the rendering of Gilg. XII 199(27) proposed by Tournay-Shaffer:“le cri vers le dieu Soleil s’emparerait de toi”71. It is a “cry” for assistanceaddressed to the divine judgeŠapšuin times of difficulty.2.The next section (lines 8–14), which can be taken as a concomitant ritual(offering) and prayer addressed to the patron deities, asks for their favouragainst the impending danger.72We have already pointed out this alternation68See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011:15: “another feature particularly associated withzikur-udûis the interpretation of rodents as evil-portending messages of witchcraft sent by thewitch”.

The subject seems to be, as in thefirst section, the “mother” who takes care of her “house”, as formerly sheprayed for her “son”. She is described as a “shocked mother”. “My father” isthe god summoned by the faithful person who utters the incantation, as isimmediately made clear: “unto thee”.73Possibly we have here (“in front ofme”) a reference to the startled “mother”, in the presence of the serpents,appealing to the protective deity to guide her steps (cf. line 38, below, for asimilar clause). There is already an example of a mother resorting to her(divine) father in KTU 1.100:1–2. And to resort toBaˁluit was necessary “to goup” (ʕly) to his temple (cf. KTU 1.119:33), as supported by archaeology. Sheasks forBaˁlu’s help to open up the way so that he may deliver her from adanger connected with “dust”, since dust is supposed to be able to conveywitchcraft. In this connection, the relationship of snakes with dust in the spellsand anti-witchcraft incantations of this genre is well known.74As mentionedabove, the possibility of translatingyr-k, “(with) your rain” should be takeninto account also:Baˁluwith his rain may clear up the scene (for water as ameans of resolution see KTU 1.100:66–69).The restorationḥ[rn] is too facile and fits too well, and so seems suspect.Nevertheless, it may be a direct reference to KTU 1.100:61:bḥrn ... bnwth,andto line 41 below, where thesebntare supposed to be eliminated by theʕbdḥrn75. But other reconstructions are possible (e.g.ḥ[r ḥr bṯn ...]). If we assumethis,Baˁlu(orḤorānu) would be asked to take hold of the “creatures” andlines 12–14 would be a continuation of the previous prayer; or more probablya continuation of the divine oracle/answer (or simply an instruction), askingthe faithful mother to clean the dust in her house in order to chase out the“creatures” (line 12; see for similar clause later on line 40:qr btk ygršk). Thelast lines 12–14 seem to be a prayer of the faithful or an injunction ofBaˁlu,asking for the definitive intervention of the god of serpents,Ḥorānu, to takehold76of them and carry them away (?). But the text is too fragmentary to be73Alsobtk, later in the text, could refer to the mother’s house as the house of his god also,in order to make the prayer more cogent.74See Schwemer, D. 2007:136.75According to the text quoted, this is the god who takes hold of the serpents and is able to“donate” them as a nuptial dowry. In our text, however, the functions as the “god of theserpents”, not as their exorcist, is a role which seems instead to belong toBaˁlu. For thepresence and function of these deities in this genre of texts see Clemens, D.M. 2001:738, 1103,n. 68, 1105, n. 79.

At the beginning there is a description of an evil-doer witheffects on the forehead (b[nʕ]nk(?)) and palms of the hand (kpt) of theaddressee or praying person. This evil-doer is described asbnt ṣˁṣ/bnt ḫrp(seeline 41), which refers us back to line 13 and to the definite context of snakeattack. In response to that a life assurance, so central in this kind of texts andhere alluded to already in line 6, is coupled with the commitment to carry outthe apotropaic magical action already presupposed in line 7.4.In this last section of the obverse of the tablet (lines 20–30), the terminology(ảqšr) again places the text in the context of a snakebite incantation. Its firstpart seems to deal, as always in these incantations, with the pernicious effectsof a dangerous enemy on the household and the supplicant. The interventionofḤorānu, the great god of serpents, is called on, possibly through the devas-tating and purifying power of water (mdbm) in his hands (see KTU 1.100:66–69; above lines 1–2, 10).5 (7).The reverse of the tablet is badly damaged and the two possible firstsections have disappeared. So the first extant section of the reverse, namelythe fifth (lines 31–37) in the series, would actually be the seventh section ofthe original tablet. It is also very fragmentary but provides some new interest-ing data that fit quite well into the assumed composition frame. The speakerseems to be the deity invoked (Šapšu?); so the text becomes an oracle/response, quite normal in this sort of texts. But now “the cry of theRapaˀūma(ql rpỉm)” is added, which recalls “the cry of/toŠapšu” (line 6) and introducesthe call to the ancestors and the corresponding cult of the dead into the listof divine protecting entities against this danger. They can take away the“anguish” (mṣr) and fear (see above) it causes and procure “life”.77But aboveall, it is now clear who the attacking enemies are: the serpents (bṯnm/bṯnt).Against them a water ritual (mṭnt) may also be applied in this case.But another surprising novelty of this text is the mention of a person, thesisterPapašarratuandPapašarru,78who may be the addressee of this anti-witchcraft incantation/spell.79That is no longer surprising after the appear-ance of the text KTU 1.178, an incantation of this kind recorded for the benefit77See Caquot, A. 1988:41: “et elle vivra heureuse”.78See Caquot, A. 1988:41.79The possibility that this is a West Semitic form of Bab.papsukkal, the vizier of the Under-world, is less likely in my opinion; cf.

The section closes with what seems to be thepromise of an animal offering (drḫm) and a pilgrimage to the temple of theaddressed god, going its own path (ntbt, see KTU 1.119:33) and holding inone’s hand the proper apotropaic plant (see KTU 1.100:64–66; 1.178).6 (8).The last section (lines 38–43) is perhaps the best preserved and dealswith the extreme situation of having trodden upon a serpent (brḥ) describedagain as one of thebnt ṣˁṣ(cf. line 41). In this case, only direct divine interven-tion (byˁAnatuorḤorānu’s servants) can be of help and can expel the animal,while the suppliant is invited/ordered to leave the house and its walls (?) toescape/remove the danger/attack. However the meaning ofqr btk ygrškis notclear; perhaps the person concerned is to be excluded from his vicinity forfear that the curse might affect others (see line 2).80In turn, the invoked deity is ready to intervene beside other deities whomay also assist in this case, making a rather cryptic reference to a well-knownmotif in the Baal myth (cf. KTU 1.3 III 22–23:rgm ʕṣ w lḫšt ảbn), although hereit is not clear whether it refers to the deities who are not usually engaged ininterventions of this kind and may even be unable to carry them out, the silentdeities, or on the contrary, to the deities that hold the voice of nature, namely,the power of magic81; there may also be a reference to the apotropaic instru-ment used to remove the danger.The text ends with the general intervention of the gods:Baˁlu, ˁAnatu,Ḥorānuand their servants, implying furthermore the entourage of the supremegodˀIluin a fight against a dangerous enemy who acquires cosmic relevance inthis way. In this regard, the reading of the Baal myth in line 1 has a contextualjustification, and even a structural one.6 ConclusionWe have made frequent use of Akkadian anti-witchcraft literature, mainly textsdealing with serpents and similar animals, in order to elucidate KTU 1.82. Theyrepresent an extremely abundant corpus that was copied and imitated all overthe ancient Near East, as shown by the presence of such texts in Boğazköy,Emar and Ugarit itself. It is impossible (and irresponsible) to ignore this evi-dence, which ascertains at the same time the strong presence of the Akkadianscript and culture at Ugarit. We can be fairly sure that the scribes and magi-cians from Ugarit followed the steps of their Akkadian elder brothers, and may80See Virolleaud, Ch 1957:6.81See on the deitiesẓẓ wkmṯabove p. 31 n. 37."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128KTU 1.82: A Miscellaneous Incantation/Anti-Witchcraft Text against Snakebiteeven have translated, or in some cases accommodated, the texts of thosescribes into their own religious framework.

Linguistically, Ugaritic may have been an Arab-type lan-guage,82but culturally Ugarit, via its master Hatti, was under Mesopotamianinfluence.83However neither the external prototypes nor the internal parallels are suf-ficient to warrant a trustworthy translation of a text as fragmentary as this.Consequently, the present attempt has been to try to provide the general con-textual setting into which the text may become comprehensible rather than topresent a literal translation based on its lexicon and grammar.82See Del Olmo Lete 2012b.83For the contrary view see Pardee, D. 2008:19–20; but see Del Olmo Lete, G. 2010a:51."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"KTU 1.96: An Incantation against the “Evil Eye”An easily justified but still quite bold textual correction nevertheless (ʕntforʕnn) has fired the imagination of scholars interpreting KTU 1.961in search ofmythological motifs2to explain the strange relationship between the goddessˁAnatuand her “brother”, mentioned next, presumed to be the godBaˁlu,although he is not named in the text.

In any case,the relationship with Ar.baṯiyy-is semantically satisfactory and phonologi-cally more orthodox.mḫr, pḫr, ṯġr:there is also great variety in the interpretation of these lexemesamong scholars.26However, prior to its semantic meaning, its assonantal andalliterative nature has to be emphasised as peculiar to this type of text.27Inour opinion, they denote victims whose “eye” is affected by the “evil eye” orthe eye of the “malefic”. Forṯġr, “gatekeeper”, we have evidence from Ug. (cf.KTU 1.78:3,ṯġrh ršp). Both this and the meaning “potter” forpḫr(“a Babylo-nian word”, Akk.paḫāru) had already been proposed by De Moor,28and curi-ously, the Sum.-Akk. incantation VAT 10018:8 mentions it among the victimsof the “evil eye”:šalúBAḪARtáḫ-te-píUDUN-šú, “you have broken the ovenof the potter”,29together with other workers (“fisher”, “sailor”, “weaver”) anddraught animals. As formḫr, Akk.maḫāru, “to meet”/ “to receive”, providesmany possibilities, e.g.maḫīru, “collector (of money, tribute)” (cf. AHw 578,584; CAD M/I 50ff.

Wehave chosen “tax collector” (Spanish,alcabalero, which has a clear Semiticroot and imitates the semantic calque very well); possibly here there is anecho of the Akk. syntagmīnam maḫāru, “correspond, to be pleasant to” (cf.25See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2001: 295–297, given in anappendixto this section; cf. also thefollowing treatement (“Once again”), with special attention to the exclusion of the suggestedmeanning “calomniateur” (Pardee, D. 2008a:16ff.).

In this connection, Lichtenstein31sees a pro-cess of “reversion” here, organised using the literary device ofhýsteron próte-ron, similar to the one in the myth of the “Descent of Ishtar” “whereby eachof seven items removed from the person of the goddess at her descent throughthe seven gates of the netherworld is restored to her in reverse order as sheexits through the same gates at her ascent”. The last phrase turns out to bephonologically a “jeu de mots”, a palindrome.32In De Moor’s interpretation,which is the same syntactically and semantically, these lines are left hangingand it is not clear to where these “eyes” have to “return” (ˁAnatu(?)).Line 14:the restoration is pure conjecture, modelled on YOS 11, 70 I 14’.333 FormIt has always been supposed that belief in the “evil eye” or “bad eye” waswidespread in the ancient Near East.

This interpretation has had a mixed reception.44A significant point of it is the etymology and meaning of the Ugaritic termbṯy, “evil-doer, sorcerer, wizard”, related there either to Ar.baṯiyyu, “syco-phant, impostor”,45or with Aram.byšˀ, Akk.bīšu, “bad” (in Aram. said specifi-cally of the “evil eye”)46.More risky from the phonological viewpoint, but semantically more con-vincing, would be to relate it to Ethp.budā, “one who causes harm by meansof the evil eye” (CDG 86).47The base seems to be Afroasiatic.48The Ethp.realisation (lengthening of the final vowel) points instead to a proto-Semiticbase /b-d-y/ or better still, /b-ḏ-y/, bearing in mind the, frequently more origi-nal, Tigre equivalentboz(z)ā(ay), “magician” (WTS 295:budā/bozā, “sorcerer”,ˀabzaza, “to stare (with one’s eyes wide open)”; CDG 115:boza, “be dull,become bleary (eyed)”).49The same base is seemingly present in the Aram.hapax bwdynh (budyān), which Naved-Shaked tentatively translate “sorcery”(?).50Now, such a base in Semitic provides a “cluster” of related bases that aresemantically and phonologically akin (b + [inter]dental voiced/unvoiced)which could explain the fluctuation of the different realisations.

However, it is also true that these languages do not use such basesto denote a “sorcerer”, outside the quoted usages in Ethp. and Aram.Such phonological correlations could help to explain the particular Ugari-tic realisation (interdental voiceless consonant for a voiced consonant), anallophone that would occur also in Arabic. Actually, Ar.baṯiyyu, which has nosemantic relationship to /b-ṯ-w/,53would turn out to be an allophone ofbaḏi-yyu, with a very similar meaning, in a semantic field (viz. magic) deeply cultur-alised and accordingly open to irregular realisation as “loanwords”, bearingin mind its ancient Afroasiatic pedigree. The difficulty of the Ugaritic realisa-tion of proto-Semitic /ḏ/ is well known (> /ḏ/ y /d/: sliding of the articulationpoint to maintain the voicing). In this case, the articulation point (interdental)would be kept with the loss of voicing.

In general, in Ugaritic literature, sexualityretains a controlled and sometimes even a romantic tone (see KTU 1.14 VI 25–35, 1.24:49–52). It is difficult to imagine a god, who hates “shame (bṯt) with9To find and follow an hermeneutical model in order to interpret isolated data of a corpusof texts is a sound and unavoidable procedure, if one wishes to determine their meaning; onlythe unshakeable and unyielding faith T. shows in his own opinion is highly objectionable insuch a fluctuating field as Ugaritic semantics, clearly manifested in this case by the divergentopinions put forward by so many respected experts (T. 454), each of them certain of his ownposition. But such a model must be linguistically sound and not farfetched, and must fit thegeneral clear scheme of Ugaritic mythological ideology. Both elements seem to me to be miss-ing in Tarazi’s interpretation. On the need of a hermeneutical model see my digression in DelOlmo Lete, G. 2006:272–273. In this connection N. Frye’s opinion is worth quoting: “Unthink-ing people often accuse scholars in every field of finding only what they previously wantedto find, as though all genuine discoveries resulted from ignorance or pure chance” (Frye, N.1990:7). Also A. Avanzini states: “I am firmly convinced that in order to get the meaning ofan epigraphic text, it is important to understand what the text is trying to ‘communicate’overall to the reader” (Avanzini, A. 2004:34).10This line of interpretation is derogatively labelled by Pardee as “un feu d’artifice” (P2 12).However, he neither quotes Tarazi’s paper nor does he adopt any position in respect of hisstudent’s (?; “the amazing professor”, T. 445 n. 1) opinion. Possibly, in spite of the respectivedates of publication of the papers (2004/2008), they were unaware of each other.11But see already also Lipiński, E. 1965:45–73."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"KTU 1.96 Once Again143slaves” (KTU 1.4 III 20–22), indulging in such practices and having his peniseuphemistically calledʕn bṯt, “spring of shame” (T(arazi). 465). On the otherhand, the same god collects the waters in his palace (KTU 1.4 V 6–9)12andfrom there sends them to the earth, without an intermediary cloud/messenger(ʕnn) of any kind. And of course, in no case is fertility carried out through“springs” (T. 499 n. 102, 503 n. 108), which play no role in this regard inBaˁlu’smythology13and turn out to be completely irrelevant in the actual agriculturaleconomy of the zone (T. 502). Nor do the “waters of the netherworld” (T. 499,n. 102), which is rather the domain of the godsYammu/Môtu, play any role inthis mythology either.14Consequently, in my opinion the ingeniously devel-oped “history of the traditions” of theBaˁlu’s fertility myth (T. 502 n. 108) turnsout to be fictitious.But let us now assess the semantic options put forward by the scholarsquoted.ʕnn:The interpretation of this lexical unit asʕn-n, “the eye” (P(ardee)1;P(ardee)2; F(ord).; W(yatt).) has given way to the new understanding of thistext as an incantation against the “evil eye”, as we saw in the previous section.The linguistic analysis fits well the distinctive use of the /‑n/ of specification/generalization in this kind of text in a main clause (apodosis).15The fact thatin Ugaritic its use is limited basically to the omen texts is an indication of theliterary form of the text through the concurrence of grammar and lexicon. Itis this form that must guide the syntactic analysis of the lexical elements,12See Smith, M.S. – Pitard, W.T. 2009:537, 542, 556–561.13The presumed etymological relationship ofˁAnatuwithˁn, “spring”, is an unprovedhypothesis (see above n. 5).14The interpretation of the “clay pipe” as a funerary installation (T. 500, n. 103) was discred-ited long ago by Pitard, W.T. 1994:20–37.15The function of the postposition /‑n/ as a deictic/determinative functor goes parallel tothe same function carried out by the postposition /‑m/ (in this regard see Del Olmo Lete, G.2008:25–59), with a good parallel in Akk. /‑m/ (see Von Soden, W. 1995: § 123/12:5: “-man,aA-min...“wohl” ist eine Irrealispartikel vor allem in konditionales Satzgefügen --- Im Nachsatzund in Hauptsätzen ohne konditionalen Vordersatz wird –man/‑minan das Wort gehängt, aufdem der Hauptton liegt”, with a clear-cut topicalising function, mainly in the apodosis (seeTropper, J. 2012:823f (§ 89.11–12)), as is the case in thešumma izbuprognosis with the Akk.mimation form (‑um). Also the Arabic postpostion of (in)determination /‑an/ is possibly veryakin to Ugaritic usage: generalization and species determination (/a king/, /the king/ = /anyking/) are semantically very close to each other. In any case /‑n/ has been considered by meas enclisis or a postpostion, never as a nominal formation in /‑ān/ of masculine gender (!), sothat the criticism made by Gianto, A. 1999:296f. and Gzella, H. 2007:555f. is totally irrelevantand completely misses the point. For the syntax of this sentence of the omen text see thebibliography quoted in Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:298, n. 73, 75, and P2 13, n. 55."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"144KTU 1.96 Once Againwhich in themselves are often vague and ambiguous. Moreover, in this casewe have a similar Sumero-Akkadian formula that confirms both the grammarand the genre of the Ugaritic text:înu lemuttu muttalliktu.16In this case, it isnot only the formula but also the composition of the Ugaritic tablet with anAkkadian lexical text on the reverse that indicate an Akkadian context in thetraining of an Ugaritian scribe. This text could well be a translation from thatlanguage. And it is precisely the correlation with the Sumero-Akkadian modelsthat was emphasised in the second part of my article (1992a), although somescholars (P1; P2; T.) have paid no attention to it.17Also, the interpretation ofʕnnas “cloud” (T(arazi). 51f.) is to be excludedcompletely. First, from the grammatical point of view, sinceʕnnis masculinein gender in Ugaritic and second, in view of the following verbs. T. is wellaware of these problems. To suppose here aconcordantia ad sensum(>ˁAnatu,the cloud-messenger ofBaˁlu) (T. nn. 29, 72) without any previous referent, isa priorihighly improbable.18It sounds more like apetitio principiior circularreasoning. Furthermore the lexeme is rather rare in the Ugaritic mythologicallexicon, limited to a specific meaning in theBaˁluCycle; in this connection tocompare the “mission” ofgpn-ủgrwith the one assigned here toˁAnatuseems16See Thomsen M.L. 1992:24; D. 9; F. 203–207, 211, 216, n. 45; Watson, W.G.E. 2007:73; Formu-las and literary structures indicate the genre of the text. Once this is identified, the under-standing of the sense of the text has to be sought within its historical setting. To restrictoneself to one’s own narrow circle in this type of literature, for which we have so few Ugaritictexts, is methodologically unjustified (T. 454; P1 166; P2 19f.). In this connection, F.’s studybecomes prototypical and widens the hermeneutical approach. Mere lexical analysis does notconstitute a valid criterion for anyone acquainted with modern discussions on lexical seman-tics. In this sense, to start from the termaḫhas a proof of reference toBaˁluis unsatisfactory.The relationship is too generic. In any case, the syntagm is related tonʕmand its parallels.Nowhere in the myths ofBaˁluis he praised for his beauty, but he is praised for his strengthin his fight againstYammuandMôtu(cf. KTU 1.3 IV 27; 1.6 VI 20–22). On the other hand, theterm “brother” does occur in the lexicon of incantation texts (see Thomsen, M.-L. 1992:24:inabi-ritŠEŠ.MEŠ-e, “between good brothers”), also in the broader concept of a “neighbour” (D.10:enāt še’i,“eyes of a neighbor”; cf. Akk.še’u, AHw 1222še-’e bābī-ya; for the parallelšeˀu//aḫu,‘neighbour // brother’, see CAD Š/2 363). On the other hand, in no case do I maintainthat “this is the other eye of the pair” (W. 375, n. 3); it would be “her sister” (P1 15). Seeinfran. 41.17For instance, F. 20,1 n. 1 relies only on the summary given in Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014(1999–2004), 1999/2004, although he quotes the Sumero-Akkadian texts directly from Thom-sen’s article; P(ardee)1/P(ardee)2 does not take this perspective into account; nor does T. seemto use the long version of my article or the Sumero-Akkadian texts.18The cases adduced from Waltke, B.K. – O’Connor, M. 1990 are not valid: epicene nounsfor animals with the “plural” ending /ôt/, a morpheme not unequivocally fem. (p. 107); andthe formation quoted on p. 109 imply precisely the opposite and have no connection to thiscase (“collective” or “abstract”)."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"KTU 1.96 Once Again145to me completely out of order.19In this cycle, the “Baalic” word for “cloud” isʕrpt, whereasʕnnis never used with this meaning (as noticed also by T.), andit is by means of theseʕrptthatBaˁlusends rain accompanied by thunder. Inmy opinion and in the opinion of many others, there is only oneBaˁlu’s para-digm (T. 453, n. 29). According to T.’s interpretation, KTU 1.96 would be a kindof text of the “MinorBaˁluCycle”, like KTU 1.10–11, 1.12 or 1.13. But in none ofthese texts doesˁAnatuhave this epithet nor does she carry out the functionassigned to her by T. This semantic option determines the lexical analysis thatfollows, but it has no serious basis, in my opinion.20Also to imagine that the“water” is “insideBaˁlu” sounds rather fanciful (T. 463f.).21wšnwt.tp ảḫh:The formšnwtis not a lexical but a morphologicalhapax; formeaning nuances see Wyatt, N. 1998a:375 n.2; Watson, W.G.E. 2007:143. In thisregard, T(arazi).’s discussion of the formšnwtas deriving from /nw/ is devel-oped with grammatically correct logic, nevertheless it seems purely specula-tive to me. The whole argument is guided by the need to meet a text fittingˁAnatu’s supposed function (not to speak of his interpretation of the formšntin KTU 1.3 IV 33). Since we have already rejected T.’s interpretation ofʕnnand,as recognised by T. (456, n. 35), in Ugaritic there is already a basešn(w) whosemeaning fits well the contents of the literary form envisaged in the text, wewill not enter into further discussion of T.’s hypothesis. Instead, we willdevelop our own options from the point of view of that base.2219Instead, cf. the relationshipʕn + hlkin the parallel Akkadian syntagm (supra). On theother hand, in the presumed parallel text KTU 1.4 III 32 (ifʕnnoriginally meant “cloud”) /hlk/would not imply “to roam”, but to go to a fixed place (T. 453 n. 29).20The speculation on the etymology ofʕnn(T. 29) can be omitted since it does not apply toˁAnatu; Baˁlu’s cloud is calledʕrpt, as stated above. The relationship linking “cloud” and“messenger”non liquet. Cf. the same view expressed in Cho, S.Y. 2007:147–152 (“smoky figures”(?)); and W(yatt). 422. And of course we reject the analysis ofʕnas “spring” in this text (T.463 andpassim; for the various opinions see D.-L. 239; alsosupran. 13).21As a general appraisal, one could say that T. forces the semantic shift beyond reason, aswhen he asserts: “Here (KTU 1.3 IV 38!) a bull is likened to a virile male man, and the bull’shorns to the male phallus”, and “the animal’s natural fighting ... very similar to what a mandoes with his phallus during sexual intercourse” (T. 465 n. 61).22I think the hollow “root” /nw/ does not exist either in Ugaritic or in Semitic in general.We could speak of a biliteral primary base /nw/, expanded to III-w:y, but the glide expansionof the /nw/ into hollow /nūw/ (and I am tracing the development and alternation of thesebases systematically; see Del Olmo Lete, G. 2004a, 2006a, 2007b.), although possible, is pho-netically highly improbable, while in the only extant lexical evidence it is always in the formof an expanded III-y (see Hebrew nominal and verbal forms; the parallelism with /rmm/ inEx 15:2 seems to be against T.’s thesis). Although the incompatibility laws for Semitic verbal“roots” are nor so well established as Greenberg’s laws of nominal bases, such an expansionseem phonetically unlikely. For the rest we cannot speak of III-y roots in the case of hollow"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"146KTU 1.96 Once AgainI takešnwtas a present participle (so P(ardee)1 164f., n. 15), which togetherwithhlktforms a pair of adjectives (seeînu lemuttu muttalliktu) and at thesame time introduces the evil effect it produces, as is normal in “evil eye”incantations. To take them as twoqatalforms is also quite possible (F. 216f.),so as to make a pair of verbal synonyms (such redundancy in coordinate epi-thets however simply does not occur in Sumero-Akkadian “evil eye” texts) asa kind of independent title, while the rest of the verbs in the text are of theformyqtl(that is an option, but F. does not “demonstrate” anything in thisrespect as P2 14 asserts). This alternation is not impossible, but in view ofthe homogeneous verbal forms in the Akkadian texts, it seems to me an infe-rior option, irrespective if it entails the specific meaning given to this form:“to roam”/“dart”. The Ugaritic verb, regardless of its etymological relationshipwith Akk.šanû, has the contextual basic meaning of “to change”, like Heb.šānāh, applicable to either form or place (W. 375 n. 2).23In this case, thesemantic option is determined by the connection of this verbal predicate withthe following syntagms, taken as its subject complement:šnwt tp ảḫh, whichI see as a semantic borrowing of Akk.ša bu-un-na-né-eLÚú-ṣab-bi-tú//ú-nak-ki-ru, “the one who seized/changed a man’s features”, worded as two synony-mous syntagms, as happens frequently in lists of attacks by the “evil eye” (asargued alreadysuprap. 131) and not refuted by anybody. Much more explicitin this connection is the new text BM 47451, edited and studied by Schwemer:“(The sorceries)change(emphasis mine) the countenance, destroy the fea-tures” (zi-i-mi ú[nak-ka-ru bu]nun-na-né[e ub-ba]-tu₄ ...

The referen-ces quoted at the end of the quoted note are irrelevant for the subject under discussion.23See Sp. “cambiar de aspecto”/“cambiar de lugar” (> “marchar”), as in KTU 1.3 IV 33,paceT.; see DUL 834.24See Schwemer, D. 2009:46–58.

The semantic derivation from “to trot” to “to roam” in general is not obvi-ous. Akkadian lexicography defined the term with the general equivalencealāku(m); see VonSoden, W. 1936:237 (line 92). Possibly here we have a case of Palache’s “semantic chain”: “tomarch by alternately changing steps” > “to trot”, according to COD 1372: “trŏt. v.i. .... 1.

This semantic option is confirmedby its use in KTU 1.40:28 and par.:šn yp, already quoted also in my firststudy and to which no attention has been paid. These two syntagms cannotbe separated from each other.25Following this way of thinking, initially I preferred to trust the readingw-(Virolleaud, KTU, Lewis) instead ofk- (P1 163 n. 11; P2 10; F(ord). 202; butT(arazi). 481 n. 78; S(mith). 22526), two characters that are easily confusedepigraphically.27But my own collation of the tablet in the summer of 2005 anda thorough analysis of the photos (see below) taken on this occasion and laterled me to dismiss the presence of any traces of two superposed horizontalwedges, which would guarantee such a reading. In the long run, a possiblescribal error could be presumed, but it is not necessary. The reading /k‑/ iscertainly too linked to the parsing oftpas a verbal form, that I do not accept,and would echo Gen. 1:4; 49:15 (rāˀāh kî ṭôb), thus making it more persuasive(P(ardee)1 165 n. 16). But even accepting the readingk, another parsing ispossible: that ofkas an emphatic particle,28with a double duty function oftp:“the beauty of its brother so comely, the beauty of its brother so handsome”. Inthis case the double duty (tp ảḫh) is stichometrically balanced by the greaterlength ofysmsm(9/9; see in this regard D(ietrich).-L(oretz). 229).

According to one of the principles of the “Held Method”:“One must be aware of corresponding idiomatic phrases even when correspondence involvesonly semantic and non-etymological equivalence”; see Cohen, C. 1989:13. For Palache’s theory,see Del Olmo Lete, G. 2008:87–88. – For the Akkadian evidence see Thomsen, M.-L.1992:22and 25, along with the semantic coupling of cause-effect. For the appraisal of the victim’sbeauty see also F. 223 n. 70, 226–228, especially n. 92 with the quotation fromMaqlûIII 8(partly parallel to BM 47451): “as for the handsome young man, she robbed ...” (šá eṭli damqidu-us-su i-kim). The text continues with a parallel colon said of the “young girl”, that can beenvisaged as corresponding to the internal parallelism supposed in our own interpretation(“roams // robbed”). The text goes on to assert that the activity of the sorceress is carried outby “looking at” (ina nikilmiša, ippališma).25Furthermore, for the parallel root pair *wpy//*nʕm in Hebrew see F. 221 n. 68.

Never-theless, the beginning of this text (CT 17, 33:1–4) uses quite different verbsrelating the “evil eye” to its victim: “to distress”, “to bind”, “to ensnare”, “tocause illness” (Th(omsen). 25).

The situation is well recognised byFord (229 n. 93: “Morphologically, *WPY/*YPY ..., are, of course, the mostevident candidates”; and pp. 255f.), who uses eight pages to comment on thecomparative and historic-religious pertinence of the activities of the “evil eye”,but only thirteen lines to justify the morphological derivation oftp<phy(F. 229; in no case “irrefutable”, P2 15 n. 73; see F. 256).That is well justified and methodologically very sound, given the scarcityof internal Ugaritic evidence; the material gathered in favour of a predicate “tosee” in this context is really impressive, but I do not think it sufficient to dis-qualify my own point of view. The text quoted, KTU 1.19 III 14 (P2 15), is a clearcase of scribal error certified by his parallel text and already noted in the textedition as such (F. 229 n. 97). The regressive assimilation supposed (F. 229; P116430; P2 15) is not proven. My verification of this root pattern (/ʔh/, /ʕh/, /bh/,/dh/...)31never certifies the radical /h/ as assimilated.32The assimilation quotedoccurs only in a non-vocalic pronominal suffixed sequence (/‑ehnu/), never atthe root end and after the III-y has been dropped.33The only acceptable solution would be to suppose here another scribalorthographic error /tp〈h〉/ (or better said a substandard spelling of the norma-29But see also F. 230f., 235, where the base *ʔkl, “to devour”, appears in the same contextof the “evil eye”’s action.30The base *ṯwy is completely irrelevant here, unless “anything is possible”.31See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2004a, 2006a, 2007b.32See for instance the phonetically close biconsonantal cluster *bh > *bahaw:ya, Ar.bahā,“to be beautiful”, Ar.bahiya, “to be empty”/; Del Olmo Lete, G. 2007d:211–212.

In any case, a derivation from *ypy/*npy is to be preferred; it maybe taken as the same c. n. astp, “beauty” > “countenance” (see Del Olmo G. 2014:301, n. 79).For an analysis of the base *phy, see the fundamental study of Coote, R.B. 1974:1–5 also DULa.v.: “face”).33In this regard, see the quoted reference to Sivan, D. 1997:33–35; as forḏrt/ḏhrt</ḏuhrat‑/,see Hb.zoh(a)r, Ar.zuhrat."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"KTU 1.96 Once Again149tive /tph/ according to F. 255 n. 176; P2 15); in P1 there is no comment in thisregard; for D.-L. 241, who suppose the base /pny/ here, the correction wouldbetp〈nn〉. But this solution, to suppose an scribal error, which is clear in thecase of KTU 1.19 III 14, taking into account the sound parallel text, turns outto be very suspect in the other presumed cases (elsewhere in Ugaritic the /h/is maintained; see DUL 667), while there is no objection to a derivation from/wpy/, which has the support of a similar pattern in KTU 1.40:28 and par.(šn yp), well attested in Semitic. Although “anything is possible”, to base aninterpretation on such a hypothetical and unfounded datum is too hazardous:the regressive assimilation (of actual pronunciation we know nothing) ofglotto-laryngal /h/ to bilabial /p/, is a phonetic phenomenon that is notrecorded in any Semitic language or in comparative Semitic grammar.We will not discuss either the idiosyncratic derivation oftpfrom /tpp/, “tospit” (for me a non-existent base; in Ugaritic the confirmed base for “to spit”is *wpṯ, although a synonym cannot to be ruled out) or its parsing as anadverbial infinitive (accusative of means) proposed by Tarazi (T. 459ff.), sinceit follows a choice of argument we have already dismissed. Formally, the gram-matical analysis is correct (in this regard “anything is possible”, even the ver-sion of /halakat/ as a present tense), but semantically it sounds rather strangewithin the common and obvious understanding ofBaˁlu’s mythology, asalready mentioned.As for the definite poetic parallelism *nʕm //*wsm, we have to take intoaccount that here we are not dealing with a poetic composition in the strictsense (rather it is formulaic) and so the arguments from parallelism and sti-chometry are secondary (see the extant difficulties and divergences made clearin this regard by D.-L. 229f., 234ff., 248; see also differently T. 447, 472 n. 71).The three roots are present (*yph and *nʕm // *ysm) cumulatively, in my opin-ion, as lexemes of the same semantic field.tspỉ/tšt:The question of the voracity or harmlessness of the “evil eye” isambiguous.

So I would maintain my option (/pnn/, “to change, distort”; D(el OlmoLete). 11), although now a derivation from *pny, “to face” (W. 376, D.-L. 249)does not seem to be so objectionable and I would favour it for lexical perti-nence (W. 376 n. 8, who quotes Sum. [ba-te],“approached”; for the discus-sion see F. 219 n. 69, 255–256, against D.-L.’s /pny/ “to face”).36This new verbcontinuesthe destructive activity introduced by the previous verbs (*spʔ, *šty).To assert that the “evil eye”, after having already “seen” and “eaten” itsbrother, “sees” him again, is rather redundant, although not impossible, Imust admit.The question of the structural arrangement of the following elements is ofgreater significance.37F. understands that we have five kinds of “evil eyes”,all of them the subject of the aforementioned verbtp〈h〉nn(F(ord). 237–238, 242,248–249 n. 163), while I (in this sense following a suggestion of Lichtenstein’s)consider the first two “eyes” to be the subjects (“eyes” of all the possiblesorcerers, both masculine and feminine) and the other three, as the objects ofthe “evil eye”’s intervention. Besides mentioning the victims in this way, as isso frequent in the Sumero-Akkadian texts, and as recognised by F. himself(F. 238), the text itself provides a clue by dividing the group into two parts bythe repetition of the verbtpnn. This kind of distribution is certainly missing,for instance, from the list in the text cited, VAT 10018, 3–4. But whereas sucha list of “evil eyes” is quite rare, the mention of victims is normal.38So Iprefer the distribution proposed, recognising at the same time that no cogentargument can be advanced in this kind of literary/linguistic analysis, we arespeaking only of hypotheses. Of course, in the long run the spell functions inthe same way, taking away (F. 248 n. 163) power from the evil-doing eye and36See also in Ebla: “Auf diese GA.SAR-PflanzerichteteEnki den bösen Blick” (Krebernik, M.1984:61). I have to accept that the Sumero-Akkadian example quoted by F. 220 is also impres-sive. But in the long run, “to face” or “to direct (the sight)”, said of the “eye” is an equivalentof “to look”, inevitably with a bad and harmful intention/effect, as it fits an “evil eye”.37For an idiosyncratic discussion in this regard see T. 480f. n. 78, who considers the text tobe a “Psalm”.38The majority of the texts adduced come from too late a tradition to consider them asproviding proof. It is better to look at the Sumero-Akkadian source tradition of the genre. Seein this regard, the list of the “one(s) casting the Evil Eye” and the “list of harmful eventscaused” at the same time, in Geller, M.J. 2003:118."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"KTU 1.96 Once Again151restoring natural force to the victims, in this case to the victims’ eye. Certainly,we have no other texts that speak of a specific attack by an eye on anothereye, but this is only a negative argument that cannot rule out this specificmention. In this connection, it is worth remembering that the Romans calledthis evil-doing eyeoculus fascinus, and its effect,fascinumorfascinatio,39which naturally applies to the victim’s visual perception.On the other hand, why should these three categories be mentioned asprototypical evil-doers? On the contrary, one of them is specifically presentedas a victim of the “evil eye” in his daily activity: “You (evil eye) have brokenthe oven of the potter” (Th(omsen). 24), while another text refers to this crafts-man in the context of the evil eye’s destruction: “may it go to pieces (like) thepotter’spursītu-pot” (Th. 32). We may confidently presume that this class ofworkers was prototypically involved in the semantic field envisaged by thiskind of spell. Possibly this is because they need an especially “good eye” tocarry out their tasks (D. 12).40Furthermore, one could ask whether the mention of the “eye” here is con-nected with thetpof theảḫin line 2. In other words, whether the “brother”is so beautiful because of his eye, not merely as a “fellow member of thesocial group” (F(ord). 230) / “the neighbor” (D. 10).41On the other hand, theexpression is one of esteem, able nevertheless to have a pernicious effect (seeF. 258–260). In fact, this kind of harm can be induced either through “envy”/Lat.invidia// Gr.baskánia/ (conscious bad regard or attitude towards thevictim) or through “admiration” / Lat.ad-miratio(benevolent regard withoutevil intent). So in folklore, we frequently see mothers using special amulets toavert the “evil eye” cast upon their child by friends approaching him with“What a pretty baby!” or the like.42I will not insist on this particular hypoth-39See in this regard the classical treatise attributed to a certain Engelbert (14th cent.),Tracta-tus de fascinatione, and the one by the Marqués de Villena (1425),Tratado de aojamiento ofascinología, edited by Fr.

My own latestopinion on the possible Semitic, even Afro-Asiatic, etymology of this lexemehas been set out above (pp. 138–139), indicating the presence of a commonbase of this kind in many Semitic languages within the semantic field of“witchcraft”. I am now more inclined to give these terms a technical meaning,i.e. “sorcerer”/“sorceress” (see above p. 35),44in keeping with the followingnomina professionis, with contracted /‑iy(y)at/ > /‑at/, where the /‑y/ is eithera radical phoneme or marks an extension.45In his turn, P2 16–18 tries to find a Semitic etymon here as well, with thesemantic support of the lexicon provided by the Ugaritic texts of this genre,in this case seeing inbṯy/bṯta parallel todbb,46“celui qui parle, accuse,attaque par la parole”. But duplication of technical terms for the same functionis rather suspicious; one would expect to seedbbused here, were this themeaning of the text. P. founds the lexico-semantic support in one of the mean-ings proposed by Cohen’s comparative dictionary (DRS) for the root *bṯw,“dénoncer” (P2 17; see DRS 91). As is well known and as proved by persistent43I must acknowledge the exquisite correctness, even benevolence, with which Prof. Forddeals with my opinions regarding the interpretation of this text, even when he disagrees withthem. As for the syntagmˁynˀ byštˀ/byšˀin “evil eye” spells, see J.

So it must be used care-fully. In this particular case, the meaning “dénoncer” seems to correspondsemantically to the general meaning of “divulguer, répandre une nouvelle” forthe primary base *bṯ(t),47mainly in its II and III forms, to be distinguishedfrom the hollow base *bṯ. But there is no hint of the meaning “dénoncer” >“calomnier” under that base. Such a meaning is not listed in any of the classi-cal dictionaries.48It appears, however, in the venerable lexical compilationsLisānu-l-cArabandTağu-l-ˁArūs. In this connection, theLisān, under the head-ing, adduces the idiom49with the basic meaning,“to sweat”. It is also quoted by theTağ. It is here that the meaning “todenounce” appears. There could be (?) a metaphorical semantic shift: “sweat”> “to make flow” > “to denounce (?) something to the authorities”, as is sug-gested by, “water running ...” (AEL 1485; see the Sp. idiom “hacer correruna noticia”). In any case, it is an idiosyncratic, secondary, derivative semanticArabic shift that cannot be taken as a starting-point for an ancient WestSemitic technical term deriving from the original meaning of the base. But itis rather difficult, not to say impossible, to relate “dénoncer” semantically to“suer”. This is to say, the possible Arabic verb *bṯw, “dénoncer” (DRS), asnoted above, would belong to the same basic seme of base *bṯ(ṯ), “to spread”> “to reveal, publish”, and in the last instance “to complain to” (see AEL 151,“to complain”, and the rest of the lexical sources); as a secondary derivativeexpanded form (/‑w/) its first physical meaning is “to sweat” (< “to makeflow”) with the secondary derivation “to spread a secret/complain” > “todenounce”.Already put forward by myself,50the lexeme was assumed under the sameheading as De Moor’s: Ar.baṯiyyu, “flatterer” > “sycophant, impostor”, by47See SD 33:BṮṮ, “announce, declare”. The base *bṯṯ is also recorded by DRS with themeanings “disperser, disséminer, divulguer”. See also AEL 151; DMWA 52; LAL I 83. The baseis also recorded in Mauritan Arabic; see DHF 52.48DAF, the reference dictionary, along with DMWA, used by unqualified Arabists (i.e. Hebra-ists, Ugaritologists and Assyriologists), on p. 85 records onlybaṯā, “suer”; also AED 21,baṯā,“to sweat”; LAL 84,baṯā, “sudavit”; it is completely ignored in AEL 151; etc., etc.49See Ibn Manẓûr,Lisānu-l-ˁArab, ed. Beirut 2005⁴, I, p. 17 (with entries listed by their initialletter).50See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2007b:229. I trusted Cohen’s proposal uncritically (semantically it isclear that it does not fit the basic seme), unable at the time to find his source (I thank mygood friend A. Lonnet for his help in this regard). The proposal has to be reformulated, aswell as the derivation of Ar. *bṯṯ frombiṯan, “ash, dust” (instead it is the other way round),according to the new analysis put forwardsuprapp. 138–139 (appendix)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"154KTU 1.96 Once Againextended semantic shift.51But the resort to this kind of lexeme (either from*bṯy or *bṯw) as well as to the etymologizing parallel withbdd, has to beabandoned as the source of a technical term for a “wizard” in the context of“evil eye” sorcery. We have to take into account that since “eye sorcery” (sightsorcery) is different from “mouth/word sorcery” (seesuprap. 10 on these kindsof sorcery), the normal corresponding term for its practitioner, its wizardshould reflect that distinction. To speak of a “calumniateur” in the context ofKTU 1.96 makes no sense.52I maintain then my proposal of finding here a veryold and universal Semitic technical name for this profession connected withthe basic meaning of “doing evil or harm”, mainly in the field of “evil eye”sorcery.53mḫr/pḫr/ṯgr:(See D.-L. 250). Both Thomsen, M.-L. 1992:24 and F(ord). 244f.emphasise the presence of “specific” members of professions as subjects orperformers of the spells. In this connection, the interpretation ofmḫras “mer-chant” (F. 244f.), according to the textual evidence, as well as its equivalentin the Akkadian lexicon (F. 245), sounds very persuasive; and like my sugges-tion (“tax-collector”)54, it also comes from the semantic field of economy, pri-vate rather than public. However, F. is not sure of the proposal, taking it onlyas provisional (F. 246). Contextually also, Cohen’s proposal (“cook”) soundsvery suitable (F. 246, n. 154). In any case, the classification of all three aspossessors or “casters” of the “evil eye” is acknowledged as a generalisation51See De Moor, J.C. 1979:639–653 (647f.). The Ar. lexeme, recorded by Hava and modernlexicographers, is ignored by Lane and Wehr and even by Dozy’sSupplément; Freitag andKazimirski list the “passive” sense:baṯan, “qui multum laudatur”, “qui est l’objet d’élogesuniversels”.52See in this regard the Akkadian text VAT 35, 1:[aṣ]-bat pà-ki ú-tab-bil lišān-k[i]; Schwemer,D. 2007:130. On the “evil (black/hot) mouth” # “evil eye” in the various traditions see Maloney,C.L. 1976a:332 (index). P2 18 confuses both kinds of sorcery. From an anthropological view-point, it makes no sense to assert: “Les termesbṯy/bṯtexpriment donc un fait général, celuiou celle qui, parses calomnies(emphasis mine), lance le Mauvais œil contre son ‘frère’”. P1162 leaves the term untranslated, although P1 165 n. 18 suggests “a by-form of the hollow rootBṮ, ‘to be ashamed, shameful’”. This is also T.’s option when he intepretsˁn bṯtas the “springof shame”, namelyBaˁlu’s penis (see above); so also S. 226 n. 15 (“sex”). For the variousproposals, see D.-L. 249–250, who prefer to see a toponym here.53To the linguistic evidence supplied can be added the description of thebudain the Ethi-opic tradition by Reminick, R.A. 1976:85–101. One can even ask whether Tagalogbatiis alsolinguistically related, as a sort of “wandering word”. See in this regard En. Flores-Meiser, “HotMouth and Evil Eye”,ibdm. pp. 149–162.54When I proposed Sp. ‘alcabalero’ as the translation of Ug.mḫr(Del Olmo Lete, G. 1992:12),I was unaware of the NWS equivalence of Akk.maḫāru, maḫīruwith Aram *qbl. On this seeRabinowitz, J.J. 1961:55–76 (“2.

The list of possessors of this sorcery mustbe recognised as unique (F. 247 n. 156), whereas the return of the eye to itsmaster is well documented in this genre. In these circumstances, F.’s treatmentof the question can be held up as a model: he does not “swear” by his ownproposal. In his turn, Pardee (P2 19f.) “ne trouve aucun indice de ce passagedesbṯy/bṯtmaléfiques auxmḫr, pḫretṯġrqui seraint les objects de l’attaque”.However, it is possible that he was able to find some indications outside thispassage, e.g. in the presence of persons and things as the “object” of the“evil eye” in Sumero-Akkadian texts. Instead he suggests an etymologisingconcoction of three new Ugaritichapaxes: “celui qui fixe le prix”, “maître del’assemblage”, “celui qui garde la porte” as the “mots descriptives des étapesde la liberation du Mauvais œil” (P1 165f.; P2 19f.)According to P.’s restrictive linguistic method, at leastṯġrshould havebeen retained its straightforward Ugaritic meaning. But no Semitic text dealingwith this sort of sorcery speaks of such “étapes”.55The presumption is radi-cally false that the person casting the “evil eye” needs to be employed by acontract and paid for, that he needs to “rassembler les instruments de la sor-cellerie” and finally that he must be freed to “sortir de sa cage pour courrir àl’attaque” (P(ardee)2 19–20). Even in our text, the “evil eye” is presented asroaming and wandering, attempting to direct a pernicious glance upon itslovely brother. Anthropologists who deal with this popular phenomenon andits descriptions will certainly remain astonished at this analysis. The “evil eye”always appears as the spontaneous and sometimes even unconscious powerof a person who does not need to be forced or assisted to go into action. Themere attentive reading of the many examples, from Sumerian to Mandaicpraxis, quoted by Ford would convince anyone of that. Although not docu-mented anywhere in this type of literature, if this presumed process did exist,it would remain outside the spell formula itself.56As for the chiastic structure of the lines, it was put forward by myself inall its elements, as F. recognises (F(ord). 248 n. 163; not by P2 19) and it doesnot preclude the assumption of groupingbṯy/bṯttogether as the subjects ofthe attack and ofṯġr, pḫrandmḫras its object, taken from Lichtenstein (seeF. 248f., nn. 162–163). The other solution that sees here five subjects of the“evil eye”, “can hardly be said to be conclusive”, as honestly recognised by55Certainly not in the collections and texts of “evil eye” spells (see F. 202 n. 1).

There is no apparent reason why these categories of profession-als should be charged with being prototypical perpetrators of the “evil eye”,as pointed out above. On the other hand, the “restoration” of the victims maybe seen as implicit in the effectiveness of the spell itself.57The refusal to resortto Sumero-Akkadian magical literature in a genre that is well documented inthis sphere (unlike the case in consonantal Ugaritic), and from which it canbe analysed fittingly (on a tablet which has a copy of an Akkadian syllabaryon its reverse!) forces the interpreter to an absolutely improvised proposal.Restricting himself to Northwest Semitic, he fails to interpret the text in areasonably acceptable way. On this point also I prefer then to maintain my firstproposal since the alternative (by which I mean F.’s), while not improbable(particularly as can be deduced from the list of casters of the “evil eye” inlater texts; see F. 238–241), turns out not to be cogent.I maintain then my proposed version of KTU 1.96 (see above pp. 130).57The texts cited by F. for the return of the “evil eye” to its masters are impressive and verypersuasive (F. 249–251). But in the practice of general sorcery, the “return” of the damned tohis primitive or normal state followed by the liberation from his attacker is a well-known topicof the genre (seesuprapp. 6, n. 30; 11, n. 58)."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"KTU 1.107: A Compendium of Incantationsagainst Snakebite1 IntroductionThe text KTU 1.107, found in 1961 in the “Maison du prêtre aux modèles depoumon et de foies”, is in many respects similar to KTU 1.100 and representsan incantation against snakebite, with the notable intervention of the godsŠapšuandḤôrānu, as in the latter.1It includes the well-known repetition ofentreaty formulas calling on a series of gods, in pairs, as in the other quotedtext. The fact that both texts contain an identical sequence shows a stablefunctional use. The entreaty to the gods is very similar to a litany, as in otherprayer texts like KTU 1.65 and 1.123. However, as the text is in fragments, it isdifficult to interpret. Although not as clearly as in KTU 1.100, the godḤôrānuhas a very prominent place in this text as he is paired with the supreme godˀIlu(line 13) and is mentioned in other places that are unfortunately broken(lines 3, 6).Epigraphically, the script on the preserved parts of the text is clean andclear, as seen in the autopsy and the new photos (see pl. VII–VIII). Digitalenlargement ensures that the reading of the script is accurate and, to a largeextent, makes a copy dispensable. In the long-run, copies provide no morethan a testimony of the epigraphist’s individual reading of the text. As well-defined photos are now available, the idea that such copies could be dispensedwith has begun to emerge among Assyriologists who have copied the cunei-form texts as an almost sacred duty up to now.2Obviously it is more useful tolook at a digital reproduction of the original than at a drawing or copy. In fact,1The classification of this text as “(para‑)mythological” or even as “historiola” (see D. Pardee,D. 1988:80, n.41) is, I maintain, completely out of place. The divine intervention is operative,non-narrative and very different in this regard from that found in texts such as KTU 1.114. Onthe issue of classifying these texts in general, see Clemens, D.M. 2001:92ff. (different classifica-tory attempts; pp. 145–575: possible “incantation” texts among the categories KTU 1–2). Thelexical and contextual connection with texts like KTU 1.100, 1.107, 1.169 and 1.178 and withthe Akkadianzikurudûritual and other anti-witchcraft texts in which the presence and inter-vention ofŠamašis so preeminent, place it clearly in the field of incantation literature. Seealso Xella, P. 1981a:245, whose differentiation between KTU 1.100 and KTU 1.107 is very muchto the point. One has to bear in mind that the presence of mythological elements that aredeveloped to a greater or lesser extent is customary in this kind of texts (see De Moor, J.C.1977:366;suprap. 4).2See, in this regard, the last volumes of the series “Mémoires de N.A.B.U.

However, I will maintain the established norm of copying the table(Fig. VI–VII).Here, we will avoid dwelling on the elucidation of fragmentary signs atthe edges (dispensable again and replaceable by a suitable manipulation ofthe digital material) of the broken lines. These are sufficiently justified, I think,by the copy and transcription of what I believe to be the good reading. Norwill I indulge in any polemics or refutation of readings proposed in this regardby other authors who have dealt with this text.3The technical means at ourdisposal today allow anyone to verify the readings that are proposed here, ifthey consider it worthwhile to insist on the possible form of isolated and bro-ken wedges that are semantically meaningless. In this regard, our Assyriologistcolleagues offer us a good example of sobriety and rationality. If this epigraphyof the edges was also unavoidable for them, numerous text editions of Akka-dian texts would have to be thrown out and remade.4The whole text is transcribed next, although only the beginning of theobverse (lines 5–14) and the final section of the reverse (lines 32–43) will betranslated and briefly discussed. For a general lexical analysis, we can referback to DUL. The rest of the text is too fragmentary for a meaningful likelyinterpretation to be made. It is enough to read Pardee’s “Commentary” toreach this opinion. He honestly and almost exhaustively gathers all the extantreadings and interpretations, but plainly and constantly confesses that it isimpossible to support any of them.53I agree almost completely with Pardee’s collation, except for some separation wedges whosepresence I feel is not clear at all (f.i. lin. 16 beforeảmn:erasure). The only significant readingdisagreement is found in lin. 46. Here Pardee recognizes beforetzd“un clou vertical et le borddroit d’un autre: lire donc {ṣ, l}”, while I see only a vertical wedge corresponding to a /g/ (seelin. 39:dgn) and preceded by the separator (see Pl. VIII); normally the vertical wedges of/l, ṣ/ are thinner. The outcome, I must confess, is completely unintelligible. In any case thedisagreement is absolutely irrelevant.4See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2004:542, n. 10. Although sometimes fruitful, this epigraphy “at theedges” is usually useless and even misleading. In general, it does not compensate for theefforts made; see Del Olmo Lete, G.2006:271. In these cases, the suitability of the contextwould offer enough and better guidance. For a different opinion see Pardee, D. 2012. For thestandard assyriological method in epigraphy see Dietrich, M., O. Loretz. 2010a:128; 2012:159f.In Ugarit both cuneiform script systems coexisted and were possibly developed by the samescribes, as can be verified easily by tablet like KTU 1.82 with its copy on the reverse of thecuneiform syllabary as a scribe exercise; the consonantic and syllabic texts have the sameductus.5Without doubt, Pardee, D. 1988:227–256, summarized in D.

Therefore, the godŠapšuraises his “voice” (ql; see KTU 1.100:2 andpassim; 1.82:6) this time, in answer to the weeping/cry of the faithful. Thisanswer oracle begins with an interrogative/exclamatory clause, according tothe literary scheme that is also at work in the cases of the distressedKirta(KTU 14 I 38ff.) andˀAqhatu(1.17 I 15ff.). In this context, the presence of thegodsŠapšuandḤorānufrom the very beginning and in an enhanced positionin the text is notable (see lin. 9, 15, 31), as is their inclusion in the “litany”that follows on the reverse of the tablet. Nevertheless, this interventionexofficiodoes not seem to have been effective.1918Seeinfrap. 176, 184ff.; already Astour, M. 1968:34.19This fact is duly recorded by the authors who search to justify it, specifying the functionof each deity in this field; see Astour, M. 1968:32; Caquot, A. 1989:96; Pardee, D. 1988:251f.,256; Pardee, D. 2002b:179, 191."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Brief commentary163The mention of an individual (not of an inexpert serpent charmer) in thetext has surprised commentators. However, we now know that the personalisa-tion of the incantation for the benefit of a person whose name is given at theend is a normal feature in this kind of texts:ˀUrtēnu(KTU 1.178:14),Papašar-ratu(KTU 1.82:36).20Consequently, we can assume that the divine remedyagainst these creatures (lin. 13,bnt; see KTU 1.82:18, 41) was delivered in thebroken lin. 12–13. Moreover, the clause of repetition in line 14 and the ruledline21also mark the end of the preceding textual unit. Lin. 15 would open upa new unit (lin. 15–27), withŠapšusending his “cry/voice” (špš bšmm tqrủ gh)22against what can also be supposed to be a serpent bite/attack, as supportedthematically by the following text (lin. 28–54). Thus, the preserved text is anincantation miscellany orcompendium tablet,23with three units; althoughthere may have been six textual units originally.24In this regard, the obverse/reverse arrangement becomes irrelevant, as it is based on inclusive arguments.The other readable obverse part (lines 32–43) is an entreaty addressed firstof all to the godŠapšu(lines 32–36), whose invocation will also close thesection in a form of inclusion that enhances the significance of the deity facedwith this kind of danger. Such preeminence is common in the anti-witchcraftliterature from Mesopotamia (Šamaš)25and was also encountered in KTU 1.82(seesuprap. 124). There follows a sort of litany in which the rest of the deitiesare invoked in pairs and in the order already laid out in KTU 1.100.26Theformula takes the form of a cliché prayer asking for the removal of the poison,thus implying that the person has already been affected by the snakebite, asthe situation ofšrġzzallows us to presume. The formula is in this case simplerthan that of KTU 1.100, but its iterative character and function is the same.However, it is impossible to decide whether there was a composition sequencebetween the textual units or whether these are independent incantation texts,20See the Akk. generic formula innamburbitexts: “ich, dein Diener N.N. der Sohn des N.N. ...dessen Gott ... stehe jetz vor dich wegen des Unheils von der Schlange ...”; Maul, St.M.1994:297, for instance.21The line is omitted by Pardee in his version, creating the impression of an ongoing text.It is present nevertheless in the copy and transcription; see Pardee, D. 1988:230f., 241.22See Pardee, D. 1988:242–248; Caquot, A 1989:97–98. To some extent, this lament corre-sponds toủm pḥl pḥlt’s “cries for help” in KTU 1.100:1 and par.; see Pardee, D. 1988:256.There, her “cry” (qrỉt) is a summons to a superior god.23See Cunningham, G. 1999:7 andpassim.24See Pardee and others on the likely original dimension of the tablets.25See Abusch, Tz., Schwemer, D. 2011: 270ff.; andsuprap. 34.26For a comparison of the two lists, see Xella.

The importance ofthese texts may only be second within the magic literature at Ugarit to thatshowed by the extispicy texts. This shows the significance of such a danger tothe Ugaritic society, which was already well known in the much more abun-dant Babylonian literature of the genre (see in the bibliography the M.-L.Thomsen’s, W. D. Schwemer’s and Tz. Abusch-D. Schwemer’s works). This dan-ger also found its way into the Hebrew desert tradition (Nm. 21:6–9), wherethe solution involved a magic serpent image which continued to be worshipedor at least recurred to in the same Jerusalem Temple (2Kg 18:4) during the pre-exilic times of the Jewish people."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"KTU 1.169: A Compendium of Incantationsagainst Word SorceryThe interpretations of the Ugaritic text KTU 1.169 (RIH 78/20)1have experi-enced a great deal of fluctuation,2due basically to the unsuitable understand-ing of some lexemes (among themdbbmandtgḫṭk). In this regard, the newtext KTU 1.178 and Ford’s interpretation, maintaining that KTU 1.169 “speaksof the exorcism of some type of sorcery”,3have substantially aided its elucida-tion as an incantation or exorcism against agents of “black” word sorcery(dbbm), who may harm young people. As such, the sexual connotations mustbe taken for granted, without defining the incantation as specifically against“impotence”.4The text was found in one of the royal archives of the kings ofUgarit, as evidence of their concern for the protection of their subjects, in thiscase a youth, faced with socially harmful practices.5I assume this interpretative point of view, abandoning my first translationand understanding of the text.6While relying largely on Ford’s semantic sug-gestions, here I put forward some views of my own regarding the overallarrangement of the text and some semantic and morpho-syntactic options. Thetext seems to be incomplete, although it is not possible to ascertain how manylines are missing.71 Arrangement of the textIn respect of the arrangement of the text (to speak of “structure” would be outof proportion in this type of text) and taking into consideration only what hasbeen preserved, the “incantation” seems to be complex.

This distinction of agents is already clear in KTU 1.178 (seeinfrapp. 181ff.). Both exorcisms against the “foul-mouthed sorcerers”, or theslanderous accusers, have a similar pattern in as much as both, in an appar-ently miscellaneous or composite formula, join in them with the actual sor-cerer as his implicit collaborators in “black” word sorcery (“todas las malaslenguas”, as the Sp. colloquialism describes it in such a lively fashion). Infact, the present incantation turns out to be a unit of composition aimed attotally preventing a sorcerous attack against the possible victim, a youth inthis case, whatever its possible source may be.8See Arnaud, D. 2007:55–99 [90–96];suprapp. 63–69."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Text and translation (Fig. VIII, Pl.

I understand theexpression as a threat to the sorcerer (the one addressed in this section) onbehalf of the exorcist. This evokes the function of the rod,ḫṭ(which is reminis-cent of the mediaevalmalleus maleficarum), brandished by the “expeller” tobanish the illness from kingKirta’s head (KTU 1.16 VI 1ff.).16For a slightlydifferent interpretation, see Ford,17who also takes both verbsnqhandqrb(D)as active forms (“grasped”/“brought near”) with the client/victim as subject.It is obvious that the “rod” must be brandished by someone.tmnt:cf.

Never-theless, there is the possibility of parsingtmntas the pl. of Ug.tmn, “frame,form” (//pnt; see DUL 871), making it in this case similar in form and meaningto the Akk. lexememešrētu,“members” (pl. tt.).ḫlṣ:for this meaning see Del Olmo Lete, G. 2013c:213ff, nn. 31–32.

In this way, the rather unusual syntacticfunction of the preposition /l/ as governing the acc. is avoided on the one hand and on theother the personal subject (“you”) will be perfectly in keeping with the following distich andthe general structure of the text in this regard.17See Ford, J.N. 2002b:169–172.18On Pardee’s objections to this proposed meaning oftmnt(Pardee, D. 2002a:884, n. 64) seeDel Olmo Lete, G. 2004b:639.19See Ford, J.N. 2002a:146–147; Ford, J.N. 2002b:174.20See Ford, J.N. 2002b:178: “in distress”, by metathetic varation between the bases *ḫlṣ and*lḫṣ, according to the Heb., Ar. and Akk. lexica; Pardee, D. 2002a:877, 886 (“une boisson faitede figues macerées”).

In this context of foodscarcity (hunger and thirst) as punishment of the sorcerer, a reference to thelack of the main Mesopotamian drinking product, beer (“bread” // “beer”;water is not in question here), would be in place; the scarcity would be theconsequence of a poormateria prima, the (barley) draff, which is too “dry”and so unfitting to let the squeezed liquid flow from which the beer will beprepared. As Stol asserts: “Ihrer Natur nach sind die (Darrmalz) Treber (Eng.‘draff’, Sp. ‘orujo’) alsonass” (Stol, M. 1971:170). In this connection, cf.

In this regard, it is important to pay attention to the “dried outbillatum”, a by-product in the production of beer (Stol, M. 1971:169).

Furthermore, beside breaking thequoted semantic parallelism of our text (//ẓm), the meaning of “drinking without a cup” asa serious punishment is not apparent and the semantic relationship with KTU 1.96:4b–5a isabsent; in this text the expression has no meaning of affliction at all.22See Pardee, D. 2002a:887f., nn. 81–82 (“les garçons ayant l’intelligence [de sorcelleries]”)for fluctuations in the interpretation of the syntagmġlm dʕtm.

The formulation, as will bethe case throughout the whole text, is binary, the second clause fixing thecorrectness of the technique to be used. In a previous note on these two firstlines of the text,9I suggested the possibility of an alternative synonymousversion (“The expert will say ... also I say ...”), setting up the parallelsdy lydʕ//ảnkandủzb//ʕṣ qdš10as confirmation of the appropriate incantationdevice.

No special justification for this alternation of the subject in directspeech is needed.11Lines 3b–8a:the performance formula follows. Still addressing the possiblevictim, “you”, the injunction is made to carry out the incantation technique(“you will not allow ...”), although the precise manner of doing so is not speci-fied: burning, carrying or just depositing the plant in question somewhere.The repetition of the formula (in itself binary), aside from its emphatic literary8See Ford, J.N. 2002a:119.9See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2010b:134–135;infrapp. 184ff.10See Hawley, R. 2004:52.

Instead,Ford sees here an opposition between the two formulations, pronounced bythe sorcerer and the exorcist respectively, and also gives the opposite meaningto the particle /l/.13To me this seems rather improbable, in view of the clearusage of a repetitive formulary in magic, in spite of the well-documented oppo-sition between the two speakers in Akkadian sources. For a complementaryopposition is to be seen between this formula and the next. The short verbalD form (seeảmrmrn, tqnn, tủdn) presumed here, could be either indicative orjussive (taˁallî), and in any case is understood as a consecutive or result for-mula (“[so] you will not allow ...”), which is more in line with the function ofthe negation particle /l/ + /yqtlø/, while the prohibitive (imperative) functionwould be better formulated using the negation particle /al/.14This milder juss-ive (affirmative and negative) meaning is also expressed in many languagesby the future form (see especially the periphrastic English construction).15Ifthe common version “(so) that the serpent does not spring up on you” weregrammatically possible (taˁlû), it could be either a consecutive formula (“sothe snake will not jump ...”)16or an incantation formula to be pronounced bythe magician himself (cf. “upon you”). That would be quite possible, if weaccept a feminine gender forbṯn/ʕqrb(on this see below) or an agreementadsensumand a collective/plural17function for “snake” and “scorpion”. How-ever, since this text seems to be a health certificate or preventive prescriptionto be retained and used by the addressee whenever necessary, I favour the firstsuggestion, clearly bearing in mind that there is no apodictic interpretation ofthese texts. Ford’s version of /l/ as an affirmative particle is the logical resultof his taking the sorcerer as the speaker.18Lines 8b–11:the incantation formula comes next.

(“Lexical Appendix”). I accept theanalysis (/d+y/) of /dy/ put forward by Pardee23and also assumed by Trop-per24and Ford25as correct. However, I do not share the well-argued parsingofdyas an imperative form of *ydy, suggested by Hawley,26which does notfit my overall interpretation of the text. For other examples of /d/ as an abso-lute subject see DUL 258 (notably KTU 1.114: 7–8:w d l ydʕnn). Possibly aspecial copulative function can be assigned to the postposition /‑y/: “the onewho is unskilled”.

Ford has suggested, as ahypothesis, seeing here a root *ṣḥḥ with the meaning “to purify” (see Syr.bzupak lešany ḥallel).31But such a root is unknown in Ugaritic and the sug-gested meaning is not well attested in Semitic.ủzb:“hyssop”: this solution, put forward by Hawley,32is unquestionably cor-rect in my view. Instead, the readingủzb, and the meaning “se mettre à27See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2009a:68.28Unfortunately, I could not collate the tablet during my stay in Damascus during the firstdays of March 2011. The tablet was nowhere to be found in the National Museum. After appro-priate inquiries, the tablet appeared in Damascus and a few months later I obtained a newphotograph, this time taken by direct light exposure, not enhanced by chemical dispersionpreparation. Now the digital enlargement of both kinds of photographs allows a better checkof all the traces on the tablet and I must confess that I am unable to appreciate “ein enggeschriebenenyvor dasdgesetzt” (Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2009a:68). In any case, the newpossibilities provided by the digital technique and the new photographs obtained by chemicallycontrasted exposure, both falling upon the object itself, present a serious alternative to directviewing with or without magnifying glass, that affects the subject’s visual organ, not to speakof the newly developed methods of three dimensional and cupola-global exposure. So thedilemma autopsy/photograph as an epigraphic approach should be questioned seriously (seePardee, D. 2008b:215–219). Autopsy remains a fundamentaldesideratum, but we must not for-get that even the most neutral observation of an object is always an “interpretation”, dependingon and starting from the mental model of the sign system we are trying to read (see Del OlmoLete, G. 2006b:272–273; 2007c:318, n. 18); to ignore that is to be obstinate. In this perception,the new digital and chemical techniques may prove to be highly profitable and seriously com-pete with the classical methods of epigraphic control used so far, providing better and clearerresults. I take this opportunity to thank Mme. Yabroudy for her incredible kindness and unfail-ing willingness to assist our research in the least favourable of circumstances.29See Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2009a:67 (“rufen”).30See Hawley, R. 2004:56–60.31Private communication.32See Hawley, R. 2004:30, 34–41, 64–65."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"178KTU 1.178: An Incantation against Snakebite for Personal Useécumer”,33said of the serpent, turns out to be epigraphically exceptional, ifnot unusual (no word divider),34morpho-syntactically strange (/ủ/ for /w/),35semantically very awkward (Ar.zabba)36and not in agreement with the genderof the subject concerned.37In the same way, to assume the exclamatory parti-cle /ủ/, “oh!”38makes little sense here. The meaning adopted is not only lexi-cally the plainest and most clear-cut, but also the most suitable both literarily(parallelism) and “formgeschichtlich” (“incantation”). In this regard, see thetext KTU 1.100:64–66 already quoted. Resorting to magical plants is normal inpractical incantations against any kind of attack using sorcery.39In thisrespect, hyssop was known in biblical Hebrew as a normal means of purifica-tion (e.g. Ps. 51:9,teḥaṭṭeʔēnî beʔēzôb weˀeṭhar),40but we are not likely to findthis term mentioned in Babylonian witchcraft literature, since Akk.zūpu(LB)is a loanword from Aramaic (AHw 1538). Nevertheless, “Heilpflanzen” werealso used in Babylonian sorcery spells, specifically against snakebite (CADS 83).41We have here the second major epigraphic peculiar reading put forwardby Dietrich and Loretz who readủsbinstead ofủzb. This time the epigraphicevaluation of the second character I find has a stronger weight.

On the function of “water” as an eliminating elementin cases of incantation against a bite from a serpent, see KTU 1.100:66–6776and the Akkadian text quoted by Ford.774 ConclusionTo arrive at this version or interpretation, a firstprima faciephilologicalapproach has opened the way towards a formal contextualisation of the textwithin a broader literary tradition, in this case the ancient Near Eastern tradi-tion of magic and incantation, as was outlined in the first chapter of thismonograph, in search of a preliminary understanding (Vorverständnis) of it.Starting from this contextualisation, a model has been obtained into which thephilological elements have been set. They have demonstrated their semantic as71See Ford, J.N. 2002a:142; also Tropper, J. 2008:34. Instead, here Dietrich, M., Loretz, O.2009:71 readgġrtas an allophone of /gˁr/; bothghrtandgġrtturn out to be hapax in Ugaritic.In this case, the comparison of /h/ with the same sign in the following terms (phm/špthm)proves its identification.72See Ford, J.N. 2002a:143.73See Avishur, Y. 2009:57–71. In this connection, Dr W.G.E. Watson suggested in a privatecommunication to analyseghrtasg+hrt, “voice of harm, strife” (//hwt ršʕ), for which Syr.hirtaˀ, “quarrel”, “harm”, offers linguistic support (SL 355f.).74See Ford 2002a, 144.75See Tropper, J. 2012:433–438.76See Del Olmo Lete, G. 1998:292; also Tropper, J. 2012:164, 321, 888; his interpretation(p. 760) of /l/ as “weg von” is not necessary.77See Ford, J.N. 2002a:145.

This is also the procedure followed by Ford, which makeshis interpretation so consistent, although in my opinion, it fails to account forthe very first line of the text. We believe that this interaction between linguis-tics and hermeneutics is the proper way to understand a text correctly (as wasthe case with KTU 1.96). A purely lexical approach is doomed to generatingphantom proposals. The dictionary alone is not an adequate tool for under-standing ancient texts. This approach runs parallel to the new method of tex-tual syntax developed to achieve a coherent understanding of the grammaticalforms, instead of the other way round.78In this regard, a clear-cut distinction has to be established between (black)sorcery and (white) magic. The genre ofincantation(preventive-curativemagic) exhibits two main procedures: either magic action or ritual and incan-tation formulae. Instead, sorcery has three operative modes: through inductiveaction (“budu” and imitative actions), words (curse, calumny, “malaventura”)and sight (“evil eye”) (see above p. 10). In this text, we have word sorceryrather than a word-formula incantation.79Lexical Appendix1 dbb(m) (II), n.m. “adversary, quarrelling, accusing, foul-mouthedsorcerer”Among the contexts in which the lexemedbb(m) appears in Ugaritic are thecontexts of incantation and spells, in apposition tokšp(m). It appears as adeterminative rather than a complementary lexeme, given the permanentabsence of parallelism and of copulative conjunction:dbbm d ġzr(KTU1.169:1),kšpm dbbm, (KTU 1.169:9);dbbm kšpm/kšpm dbbm(1.178:9, 13). Thelexical correlation with Akk.dabābu, “to talk, say” (verb and verbal noun) hasbeen established for some time.80But it is not merely a lexical correlation: itis an element of the technical vocabulary of magic and incantation in thesemantic field of the “word”, as Prof. Ford correctly understood.81The mean-ing in Akk. may be negative; the correlate of the Ugaritic term is Akk.dābibu,78See Piquer Otero, A. 2007:93.79For the classification of this text as an “incantation” see Dietrich, M.,Loretz, O. 2009:73;above p. 81.80See Avishur, Y. 1981:17: “enemies”, “evil words”; Caquot, A. 1989:54 n. 122:“paroles”, 57n. 141 “qui parlent”; Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 1988:335: “Die Reden”.81See Ford, J.N. 2002b:136ff., 157."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"184KTU 1.178: An Incantation against Snakebite for Personal Use“Prozessvertreter” (AHw 148), orbēl dabābi, “Prozessgegner”, namely, “adver-sary, quarreler” (CAD D 3f.: endabābi dābib-, “who brings a suit against”),who harms with his words, who blames someone and in this way justifies hispunishment, either in parallel or in conjunction withkaššāpu, “the sorcerer”.82So the expressionydy dbbm(KTU 1.169:1) turns out to be a calque or semanticborrowing from Akk.ṭarad bēl dabābi, “Vertreibung des Prozessgegners”, asin the heading of the small ritual (KAR 171)83for the 29th of the month (Abu),whilst the hendiadyskšpm dbbm/dbbm kšpm(KTU 1.169:9; 1.178:9, 13) wouldcorrespond to “adversaries, quarreling sorcerers”,84understanding this kindof witchcraft caused by words as a kind of insidious, malevolent judicial pro-cess (see above p. 9, n. 53). The latter text defines this semantic field very wellwith its explicit reference tohwt, “word” (line 13). In turn, Ford understandsthe expression in an abstract sense as “sorcerous accusations”, aspl. tantum,which, though perfectly valid from the morphological point of view, is in myview less probable. In contrast the functional value ofdābibu/dbballows boththe hendiadysdbbm kšpmand at the same time the independent elliptical useofdbbm. The “expulsion” that these incantations formulate is usually aimedeither at the pernicious effects or the beings that cause them (evil spirits,demons, sorcerers). Actually, cause and effect may bear the same denomina-tion (“incantation”/“enchantment”).2 The (in)expert magician: dy l ydʕIn the incantation literature there is an insistence on the fact that the magicianor conjuror must be competent, an expert “who knows” (edû) the practicesand formulae for each incantation. The godAsalluḫi, Enki’s son (Marduk inBabylonia) is the holder of such wisdom and from him is it to be obtained.The Mesopotamian incantation stressesknowledge85that guarantees that theformula is the correct one, that ofAsalluḫi:82See Schwemer, D. 2007:71f., 127–132. In this connection is worthwhile recalling Ps. 120:2.“O Lord, save me from the treacherous lips (śefat-šeker), from a deceitful tongue (lāšôn remiy-yāh)!”.83The text can be consulted in Ebeling, E. 1931 nº 5, 24ss.; Schwemer, D. 2007:128. The verbdabābu(m) may have also a neutral value “to recite” (on behalf of the “patient”) in thoseconjuration texts, as Cynthia Jean explains (Jean, C. 2010: 337–346).84See Ford 2002a:137, n. 94.

Go my son ...” (YOS 11, 71 4ff.).The tradition is also well known in Ugarit:88“My son, what do you not know? What can I add to you? ...

Therefore, we shall start fromthis detailed discussion of the text as provided by various scholars, withoutrepeating their arguments, but in our turn arguing briefly for the specificdetails of our own version and interpretation, which in several points divergefrom those given by other scholars.1 Text lay-outThe text is arranged in three parts: 1) the request for the divine “charmer”, ableto cast and perform the incantation ritual, actually effective against snakebite,repeated and addressed twelve times to as many deities, with a negative resultthe first eleven times (lines 1–60);22) the positive and effective reaction of thegodḤôrānuto that request (lines 61–69); 3) a happy ending: the cooperationinitiated among the deities ends in a wedding, a divine theogamy which legit-imizes the efficacy of the power of the magical incantations emitted from thesanctuary of the supplicant deity, now wife of the god who demonstrated thathe had such power.3The opposition between the first two parts is clear: the1The goddessŠapšu, the actual twelfth, must be counted also among the impotent deities inthis affair; in fact she is the divine messenger in search of an effective “charmer”, and so thebest witness of the impotence of the whole pantheon.2The repetitive system of magic also occurs, with simple repetition, in the case ofBaˁlu’sattempts to defeatYammu, KTU 1.2 IV (although not strictly a “magical” intervention in thiscase), or with triple repetition, as in the case ofDanˀilu’s attempt to find the remains of hisson, KTU 1.19 III.3See for instance Pardee, D. 1988:227–256; 1997a:295–298; 2002c:179–191; De Moor, J.C.1987:146; although our interpretation is not necessarily in agreement with their views. Anexcellent recent survey is provided by Dietrich, M. – Loretz, O. 2009:85–86, 88."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Text lay-out189passivity and silence shown by the gods invoked contrasting with the sensi-tive, swift and effective action of the godḤôrānu, made evident by the rubricat the end of each of the first eleven repetitions of the “cry for help”, butmissing from the last.4The situation strongly reminds us of the request pre-sented byˀIluto the gods in order to find one able to cure kingKirta’s illness(cf. KTU 1.16 V 10ff.).With regard to form, the first part is in the “message style” (although theformulary is different from the classical formulary of literary texts5) andworded at the instant of his “command” and supposed “transmission” by themessenger, the goddessŠapšu, as is clear from the second part (Ḥôrānu’s reac-tion), though in none of these transmissions do we have a “reply”. However,of course, the repetition of the command supposes that the messenger, orperhaps it is better to speak in this case of an “intermediary”,Šapšu, hasreturned. The other deities remain in their “seat-dwelling”, whereas the“charmer”/“exorcist” of snakes (mlḫš), unable to neutralise them, sits downwaiting for the effective incantation, formula and ritual, to be brought to him,in other words, waiting for the assistance of the actual god of magic in theirpossession. This clause (actually a formulaic syntagm6) stages in a rather pop-ular way the failure ofŠapšu’s successive mediation and the long wait of theuseless charmer for the appropriate formula (see Sp. “esperar sentado”), atthe same time enhancingḤôrānu’s prompt answer.4This opposition, of course, is given different meanings, depending on the interpretation ofthe whole; see for instance two contemporary opinions: Pardee, D. 1988:207–209, 214, 223 andDietrich, M., Loretz, O. 1988:345.5Cf. Del Olmo Lete, G. 1981:54–55.6See KTU 1.4 V 46:tʕdb ksủ wyṯṯb, “a throne was prepared and they seated (him)”. See thesame syntagm in thenamburbitext found at Hama, which belongs to the Neo-Assyrian period:[GIŠ.GU.Z]A.MEŠ.KUG.MEŠ[a]-na a-šá-[bi]-ku-nu ad-di, “pure [chai]rs I have set forth, on whichyou can sit”; see Laessøe, J. 1956:62f. In this case, the deity Šamaš is the beneficiary. See inthis regard Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:307, n. 99.

But there is no sense in performing a magic gesture when no suitableincantation formula, of divine origin, is at hand from which this performancewould derive its efficiency. But this second injunction lies outside the directrequest to the respective deity asked fromŠapšuby theủm pḥl pḥlt, as itsabsence in the request addressed toḤorānuin lines 60–81 leaves clear. It issimply a common action that must accompany the incantation formula. Thissyntactic parsing is imposed by the newly proposed and assumed analysis ofthe verbal formyṯq(the second crux of this bicolon) as derived from /ṯqy/,Akk.šaqû, “to be high”, D “to elevate”,49in parallel with /šlḥ/, as proposedby Dietrich-Loretz, that I now assume to be the most feasible. Or a descriptive/indicative formulation would require a formyṯqy, whileyṯqnormally repre-sents an abbreviated/volitive verbal form. I am full aware that one cannotforce this argument too much.50But in this case, the regular verbal morphol-ogy seems to make good sense and we can dispense with applying an irregularuse. On the other hand, I cannot accept the semantic interpretation that viewsthis magical action in accordance with the biblical episode of the Bronze Ser-pent (Nm 21:8–9). We can think of a bronze or rather a clay figurine used inthis gesture, but in no Mesopotamian incantation text of this kind (Namburbi/Ušburruda, etc.; and we are surely within Mesopotamian tradition if weassume the East Semitichapax/ṯqy/) is an living serpent or its figurine usedas a positive apotropaic means to avert snakebite.51On the contrary, it isalways used as a magical object to be destroyed, with the intention of return-ing to it the curse it intends to produce.52The biblical parallels can be found49This is an old proposal already recorded in DUL s.v., but recently put forward by Bor-dreuil, P. 2007:35–36, and endorsed by Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2009b:75ff., in keeping with theBiblical narrative about the “bronze serpent” and the episode of the plague of serpents in thedesert (Num 21:4–9). Nevertheless, it is a lexicalhapaxin Ugaritic with no parallel in anyother West- or South-Semitic language, and so a clear East-Semitic loan.50See Tropper, J. 2012:695ff.; Verreet, E. 1988:61ff.; also below on line 62.51See the texts quoted by Finkel, I.L. 1999:231f (“crush it”). Caplice R.I. 1974:11 sums up therites to remove the incumbent evil, in this case a snake attack: “we can single out four domi-nant themes that underline many of them: destruction, obstruction, substitution, and simula-tion (destructive also)”. On the apotropaic use of figurines/amulets see Braun-Holzinger, E.A.1999. But these scholars do not deal with serpents in incantation texts and even so, only two“mythological” serpents appear on apotropaic amulets found in excavations (pp. 166–167)52“[Die Schlange (or das Figürchen der Schlange) he]bt er hoch und ...spricht er: Trage fortdas von dir (ausgehende) Unheil ...”; see Maul, St.M. 1994:299.

He is the subject of these verbs,57in the volitive (yṯq, yšlḥ) andindicative moods (yˁdbandyṯb). On the other hand, the contrast betweenḤôrānuand the other deities entreated lies in their non-appearance or in theirfailure to react to the request in the face ofḤôrānu’s rapid reaction.

In turn, the cityd qdmmust be the dwelling-place of “Šapšu’s daugh-ter”, who is, consequently, an astral deity. In this context may be placed “thehorses of the Sun” mentioned above (see n. 39). Like the bulls and cows attri-buted to the moon-godSinin Mesopotamian mythology,60horses seem tobelong in the circle of the other great astral deity,Šamaš/Šapšu, through herunknown daughter, theủm pḥl pḥlt.61The “reaction” would thus be limited to the first colon of the tricolon andthe other two cola would explain it, according to the pattern of cause/effect.On the other hand, the mention of the “City” (ˁr)isprolepticand gives way toḤôrānu’s intervention by coming to the rescue of the supplicant, opening withthe well-known clause of travelling (in the “fulfilment” moment),62specifyingby name the city approached,ảršḫ(ˀAraššihu) and here reproduced by a stand-ard tricolon. The city was of course well-known to all the gods of the pantheon.I do not think it necessary to take this section as a quotation introduced as a“redaktionelle Einschub”.63In fact it represents the climax of the text inas-60See Del Olmo Lete, G. 1992:70.61See Loretz, O. 2011:131ff., 242ff.

It is therefore to be credited with a primordial significance in theaim, structure and development of the text, incompatible with the characterof “eine Einschub”. The pattern developed here prototypically is the one foundin this type of magic intervention: striking with a rod or the branch of a specialplant and dissolving the venom in water or carrying it away by a flood (seeKTU 1.16 VI 8; 1.169:5; 1.178:1–3). This statement forms aninclusiowith thetheme of venom at the beginning of the text. It is now a question of transmit-ting to the supplicant the power manifested and exercised by means of a magicformula that encapsulates it. This is dealt with in the following section.64Having cleared the City of serpents and their venom,Ḥôrānuapproachesthe palace of the supplicant from whose environs the danger had also disap-peared following his crushing intervention and in which her titular hasenclosed herself (possibly out of fear?). With this scene we reach the last epi-sode of the text. A ruled line singles out this last motif of the third sectionwhich shows a thematic correspondence to the rubric in line 7 in the firstsection, in respect of the petitioner’s behaviour (note theinclusios:ˁdb, mnt,nḥš). But now, instead of receiving the god who has responded and removedthe poison, the door is closed. However, the gesture is not one of rejection,but the typical hiding/bargaining of courtship and nuptial agreement,expressed by means of an exchange of dialogue. The understanding betweenboth deities ends in a wedding, a divine theogamy, the particular saving act,as a permanent condition achieved by the deities who cure snakebite.Ḥôrānuasks the palace to be opened to him, a building he defines as “the house ofincantation”, showing in this way his desire to make it the seat of an effectivefight against snake attacks and the place where to look for the effective incan-tation formula, depositing in it his power in this respect.65But the inhabitantof the palace, surely theủm pḥl pḥltof the opening lines, wants to have aformal guarantee and formalise the meeting as a permanent wedding agree-ment, offering herself asḤôrānu’s wife, which will without any doubt assureher a share in his power.

In this case, thegod can also enter the house, otherwise closed, but not before asking loudly(ytn gh w yṣḥ) “who is in the house?” (m bbt).

It is impossible to deny a relationship between both texts.But before going into a more detailed comparative perspective, let us firsttouch on a small question related to classification. It has been suggested thatour text belongs to the category of Mesopotamiannamburbiincantations.68Certainly, some of these actually aim at preventing and “solving” snakeattacks, but possibly the coincidence stops there. KTU 1.100 not being a par-ticular text to be used in the practice of magic as such (see on the contrary KTU1.82, 1.96, 1.178), but rather a “foundation” or aetiological myth, its structure isvery different, although both models share some motifs. Thenamburbigenreis actually preventative and future-oriented, but it depends on a previous“omen” that it attempts to invalidate,69while our text and the concrete modelit prefigures do not operate on actual episodes of snake attacks nor dependon a previous omen. A simple comparative look at the texts makes this clear.7066See Caquot, A., Dalix, A.-S. 2001:401.67For this version see also Márquez, Ig. 2008:471.68See the references in Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2000c:266ff.

It is in this context that the textmay reveal its whole significance. In this connection, W. van Binsbergen andF. Wiggermann, in their significant study on magic in the Ancient Near East,71have made explicit the duplication of powers that encompasses the “religious”life of the Mesopotamian people; a view that continues into our own times inmany societies. In order to cope with the difficulties and oddities of any kindthat they encounter in their lives, people have recourse to the gods and theirpowers and to magic and its mechanisms. It seems that “at the beginning”there were two independent transcendent power systems72and that later,“magic” was in some way subsumed under the “divine”, in this way gainingaccess to the cult and temple.73But even so, magic remained the exclusivedomain of certain patron deities while the rest of the pantheon had no accessto it, either positively to activate it or negatively to fight against it. KTU 1.100is an outstanding formulation of this ideology.71See Van Binsbergen, W., Wiggermann, F. 1999:1–34.72An echo of this duplication of powers can be also heard in the story of Gn 2–3 in thefunctionality of both, the “serpent”, Gods’s creature and his adversary (Gn 3:1–5), and in the“tree of life”, that even if planted by Yahweh (Gn 2:9), can produce its effects against his willand decision (Gn 3:22).

As is well known, all the great gods of this pantheon (includingits head, the supreme godỉl, and the skilfulkṯr wḫss) are discredited as incom-petent to heal or prevent snakebite. It is extremely surprising in this connec-tion to see that the goddessˁAnatu, who in the Baal myth boasts of havingslain primordial monsters, including thebṯn ʕqltn, šlyṭ d šbʕt rảšm(KTU 1.3 III41–44), is unable, like the other great gods, to acceptŠapšu’s request to pre-vent snakebite. In the “Epic ofKirta” this “theological” provocation is solvedto some extent (by healing an illness): here it is the godˀIluwho acts as thegod of magic, the rest of the silent gods again confessing themselves unableto intervene (KTU 1.16 V 10ff.). Also a correction of this attack on the canonicalsystem and the preeminence of the supreme father god supposed in KTU 1.100is provided in another text, this time of magical praxis against empiricalsnakes biting (KTU 1.107:38). The litanic invocation of deities asked “to removethe poison” begins withỉl wḥrnas the first couple of the series. It may be seenhere as an attempt to harmonise the two power systems, “divine” and “magic”(the main “thesis” of KTU 1.100), as such this coupling is completely alien tothe canonical mythological system of Ugarit. In it, the supreme god couplesonly with his consort,ảṯrt(cf. KTU 1.65:5), the mother of the gods (her “seventysons”) or presides in first position in the sequence of Ugaritic deities, in thepantheon lists and in the ritual texts as well.2In this connection also, a textsuch as KTU 1.82, although very fragmentary, becomes particularly interesting.In line 6, the same afflicted person utters the “Sun’s cry” (ql špš): ḥw, “livesafe”, directed towards the godBaˁluso that “the serpents, with the coriander,Baˁlu, [let him take them away] with theprṭl-plant”. In other words, hereBaˁluis given the same role and magic technique that areḥrn’s in KTU 1.100:64ff.,a role for whichBaˁluwas unable to give a positive answer in lines 8–13. Asimilar situation obtains in KTU 1.124, where the answer to the cultic consulta-tion in search for a prophylactic remedy on behalf of a royal infant (probably),refers to the “joint” patronage of both gods,ḤôrānuandBaˁlu, but each one1See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:47–49.2See Del Olmo Lete, G. 2014:53–60."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206Conclusion:ı̉landḥrn: Divine Power versus Magicacting from his own temple.3This a clear evidence, on the one hand, for theunification of the two power systems mentioned earlier and on the other, oftheir differentiation. One gets the impression that, on the one hand, the issueof the assimilation of magic into religious praxis was not definitively settledat Ugarit and, on the other,Ḥôrānu’s exclusive patronage did not easily gainthe upper hand.In KTU 1.100, on the contrary, the only god able to respond to the requestfor intervention isḥrn, a god who does not have a place in the Ugaritic pan-theon, which means that he is not recognised as a referent in the canonicalreligion and cult of Ugarit. In fact, he is neither invoked nor included inanycultic text. Instead, he is invoked in various incantations (besides KTU1.100:58ff. cf. KTU 1.82:27, 41; 1.107:31, 38; 1.169:9; also KTU 1.124:6 and1.179:33) and as the subject of the curse formula (KTU 1.16 VI 55; cf. 1.2 I 7),a classic instrument of magic with immediate and autonomous effect. He isnevertheless a “god”. But even so, likeỉlin KTU 1.16 (Kirta’s illness), he alsohas to make recourse to some magical “instrument” (cf. KTU 1.100:64ff.) whichreally contains the power. The deity has the “know-how” to set the process inmotion, although the power is not his but the instrument’s (plant or figurine-genius).Therefore,ḥrnrepresents a primordial situation, parallel to the one thatỉlgoverns and commands. Consequently, we are invited to interpret KTU 1.100in a mythical setting4and to take it not merely as an incantation againstempirical snake bites but rather as a canonical mythical text, as becomes clearfrom its closing theogamy.5In this myth, the chthonian godḥrn6acquires ashis wife a daughter of the astral goddessšpš(the “Sun”), uniting in this waysky and earth, Heaven and Underworld, the astral and the chthonian, andreceiving the “serpents” as her wedding gift. These consequently acquire thesignificance also of a primordial threatening power, able to attack the Sun’soffspring7as a symbol/token of any other pernicious attack they are able to3Seesuprap. 97 (on KTU 1.124).4See Dietrich, M., O.

In fact, most of the anti-magic Ugaritic textsappear in the form of incantations against snakebite (KTU 1.82; 1.107; 1.178 aswell as 1.100). As in many a religion, in Ugarit also, this primordial evil powerhas a serpentine shape (KTU 1.5 I 1 and par.:ltn bṯn brḥ: Lôtānu/Leviathan).Another aspect that proves the mythical character of KTU 1.100 is the ques-tion ofḥrn’s abode. It is unmistakably called amṣd,8while the dwelling of thesupplicant daughter of the Sun has the nameảršḫ.9Both these divine abodes,like all the others, must belong to mythical geography and do not occur inempirical sources. Moreover,ủm pḥl pḥlt’s abode (which will becomeḥrn’salso), is qualified asˁr d qdm, frequently translated as “the city of East”,10asuitable residence for the offspring of the Sun. Butqdmmay have also a tem-poral meaning: “the City of Ancient Times”, bearing in mind that we are deal-ing with a primordial confrontation of powers in a time (and space) outsidethe empirical one.11In this aspect, space and time coincide and such a qualifiercould well correspond to theuru-ul-la of theSumerian pre-Anugod-list ofTCL 15 10 (I:33), present in the DNDen-ur-ul-la,12“the lord of the city of oldtimes” (see alsou₄-ri-a, “in illo die”).Such an epithet would correspondto the primordial character (“pre-Anu/ˀIlu”,13“before” the creation/generation8The TNmṣdis a mythical or mythologized TN, like the rest of the divine abodes cited inKTU 1.100(mbk nhrm, ṣpn, ỉnnb, lrgt(?),bbt(?),ḥryt(?),ʕṯtrt, šmm), except for the real, ancientplace-names (ttl, kptr, mr)and also the mythologized TNN denoting the abodes of foreign(dgn, kṯr) or interpolated (ʕṯtrt)deities. In keeping within the chthonian character of the deity,it must be considered as a designation of the Underworld. It has been interpreted either as“fortress” (cf. Heb.meṣûdāh) or “steppe” (cf. *ṣyd (?)); see Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2000b:339ff.;Pardee, D. 1988:213 n. 69; Caquot; A. 1989:89 n. 275; a connection with Akk.maṣādu, “meltingpot”, is unlikely, taking into account the Semitic conception of the “Underworld”.9Apparently, this TN corresponds to Hurr.-Akk.Araššiḫu, the river Tigris. But seems unlikelythat such a well-known real name of a river would be applied to a mythical city (see Diet-rich, M., Loretz, O. 2000b:342, 356f.). This TN, of artificial formation, is possible modelled onthe phonetic pattern of the Sumerian wording: ur-sag(‑an-na), “pristine (heavenly) city” andur-sag(‑mah), “ancient capital”, or even of the name of the Sumerian god of magic a s a r -lú-ḫi /Asalluḫi. Cf. Hallo, W.W. 1996:15. In Mesopotamian tradition, the abode of N i n - g i r -i m a , the incantation goddess, is called m u - r uk, alsoˀIšḫara(yu)’s palace. See Krebernik, M.1984:259f.

Here we have two independenttranscendental power systems that our text is attempting to harmonise.The primordial Serpent(s) was(were) well-known to the Ugaritians: it(they)appear(s) in the Baal myth under the image of the primordial “Dragon(s)”assistingYammuin his fight withbʕl(KTU 1.5 I 1–3:bṯn brḥ/ʕqltn) and ofwhose destructionˁAnatuboasts (KTU 1.3 III 40–46:tnn...), as was pointedout above. Their creation or filiation is not accounted for and they appear tobelong to the primordial Chaos prior to the divine procreation of the pantheon.The primordial serpent will also appear in the biblical story of thegn ʕdn:itis incomprehensibly a “creature” and at the same time a slandered “adversary”ofyhwh(Gn 4:1ff.): the unification of the two systems (this time in an ethicaldisguise) remains clumsy. This primordial “conflict of Yahweh with theDragon” (the classic “Chaos-Kampf” motif) will be solemnly commemoratedin Hebrew lyric (Pss. 24:1–2; 74:12–17; 89:10–13; and the literal eschatologicaltransposition in Is. 27:1).16Also the enigmatic figure of thenḥštn, incorporatedinto the Yahwistic temple cult, is a reflex of a primordial power. This powerwas historicised, like any other element of Canaanite religion adopted by bibli-cal religion, by the connecting reference to an episode of the wandering in thewilderness, connaturally focussed on an empirical snake biting, as was alsothe case in Ugaritic anti-magical praxis. Does it imply that this danger was soprominently significant at the time as to conceal other dangers? In an urbancivilisation, that is not easily presumed. This textual evidence is only accept-able under a prototypical value of its elements, above all of its main actant,the “Serpent”.But in any case it is clear that the primitive two-power system is incorpo-rated, more or less, in the religious conception: in Ugarit, by accepting anindependent magical power; in Israel, by rejecting it. Yet for centuries itremained active in religious praxis and was ingrained in Israel’s conceptionof origins and of the resulting ethical world: the origin and persistence of“evil” is affirmed through the assumption of a primordial agent/system thatcannot be easily reduced to a unique divine protagonist. In its turn, Ugaritcet univers était conçu comme une ville, le ‘u r u - u l - l a ’, la ‘cité de jadis’”. Cf. Van Dijk, J.1996:1–59 (13).14In this regard see p. 203 above; Horowitz, W. 1988:277: “be exorcised by Enurulla andNinurulla of ‘The Earth of No Return’”.15See Van Dijk, J. 1996:39–41 (AO 4153/NFT 180:1).16See Day, J. 1985; Mettinger, T.N.D. 2007:29f., 80ff."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Conclusion:ı̉landḥrn: Divine Power versus Magic209also re-established the “orthodoxy” of the mythological system, as has beenpointed out above, on the one hand, by makingỉluthe main and only magicianamong the gods (KTU 1.16 V 10ff.) and on the other, by linking him withḥrn(KTU 1.107:38–44) as the deity to be invoked, along with the rest of the deities,although in KTU 1.100 they are all declared powerless in this respect, i.e.against the biting “snake”. It is difficult not to see here a polemical confronta-tion of texts.KTU 1.100, then, is much more than a simple incantation17for “use” inmagic: it is the actual “myth of magic”, the unveiling of the power of incanta-tion: itshieròs lógos, its mythological aetiology, “das göttliche Urbild/Vorbild”from which the incantation’s efficacy depends.18The power of these incanta-tions is the power of a god, now conferred on a goddess, the patron of suchacts, who rules over any “serpent” and can prevent their attacks and neutralisetheir venom when her sons (the prototypical horses), are bitten. The mythemeis important, for it shows that in Canaan, magic was not considered as a forcecompletely independent of divinity, but in some way linked to it, although notjust simply available to any god. It was what the activity of the craftsman godKôṯaruled to suppose, whose weapons were decisive in resolving theBaˁlu-Yammuconflict in favour of the former (KTU 1.2 IV 11ff.), but was also impotentin the case of snakebite, i.e. magic in general, according to lines 45–46. Inthis way, “divine” and “magic”, each originally with its independent andopposite myth, come to an agreement in presenting magic as tied to divinepower and in some way to the divine will, which can be reached by prayer,exactly as shown bypḥlt’s repeated plea to the gods. The fact of the matter isthat not every god is able to do everything.This, then, is a magico-mythical record (like KTU 1.114, and to some extentlike KTU 1.23 and KTU 1.24) in which the magical activity of the incantation isto the fore, so justifying its inclusion among texts of this kind. Now, in viewof the lack of Ugarite data in this connection and leaving aside long distanceperspectives that would take us too far away and would not solve the philolog-17See already in this regard Tsevat, M. 1979: 759–778 (767ff.).18See in this respect Dietrich, M., Loretz, O. 2000c:263–402,passim; 2008:119–140; 2009b:89,99–100.

But I do not find it appropriate tospeak in this connection of a “historiola”; see Pardee, D. 2002b:167; Kutter, J. 2008:106, 121–122. The classification of this text as “myth” had already been insisted on by Young, D.W.1979:839–848.

There, magic activity is the specific field ofthe divine coupleEnki-Asalluḫi(/Marduk) in the II millennium,20while in theIII millennium, the goddessNin-girima, fromEnlil’s circle, is the actual deityof magic.21This conflict of competences will be resolved as usual by makingher the daughter of Enki and so the sister ofAsalluḫi.22Her magical activity isstill recalled in the Ugaritic syllabic text RS 17.155:18’,23along withEnkiandAsalluḫi, as the “lady of incantations” (nin.girima. ereš.mu₇.mu₇.ke),which recalls the function ofủm pḥl pḥltin thebt mnt, “house of incantation”,quoted above (KTU 1.100:71), and the titlemlkt mnt, “queen of incantation”(KTU 1.179:34).

Butḥrn, her prospective husband and19From various indications in the text, it has been suggested that its immediate origin isrecognisably Hurrian, probably connected with the care and cult of “horses”, which the Hurri-ans probably took from the Indo-Aryan stratum of its population and transmitted to the Hittiteworld; see Loretz, O. 2011:126ff. This means that the many parallels with Indian literatureprovided by the text are justified, apart from other possible Mesopotamian and Egyptian influ-ences. See Pardee, D. 1988:224; Dietrich, M., Loretz, O, 2000c:377–387. I believe, nevertheless,that the form of the text is typically west-Semitic, built “in parallel” to the east-Semitic model,texts of which were well-known at Ugarit. Other parallels may be coincidental.20See in this regard Dietrich, M. 2012:183–223 (216f.):21A thorough description of the personality of this goddess can be found in Krebernik, M.1984:233ff.22See Krebernik, M. 2003:365.23See Krebernik, M. 2003:239.24The difficulty of inserting the Mesopotamian deity of magic, well-known at Ugarit, intothe Ugaritic pantheon is well appreciated by Dietrich, M. 2012:217: “Die Tatsache, dass Marduk(//Asalluḫi) anders als sein Vater Enki/Ea in Ugarit keine Bedeutung erlangen konnte undihm folglich auch kein eigener Kult eingerichtet wurde, hing wohl davon ab, dass er in derneuen Heimat kein geistig-theologisches Pendant, kein Numen gefunden hat, mit dem ihn dieUgariter verbunden konnten”. On the contrary, the identification ofkṯrwith é-a/Enki corre-sponds to the generic qualification of this deity as “wise”, not to his specific “magic” capabil-ities that KTU 1.100 excludes; such identifcation is in contradiction with KTU 1.100:45–49.Futhermoreḥrnshould be consideredkṯr’s son (!), according to the Mesopotamian pattern.
