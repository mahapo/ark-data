Miquel Civil, Francisco Gracia, Manuel Molina, Juan Oliva and Gre-gorio del Olmo Lete. First of all, I must thank Prof. Dr. Joaquin Sanmartin, in his capacity as director of the thesis and the Institute of the Ancient Near East of the Univer-sity of Barcelona, under its Head, Prof. Dr. Gregorio del Olmo Lete, for the efforts they have made on my behalf and the excellent working conditions they have provided, without ever denying me anything that I needed —and that was available to them— for the progress of this study. In second place, I wish to thank the team of the Institut del Proxim Ori-ent Antic of the Universität Autonoma de Barcelona, under the direction of Prof. Dr. Jordi Cors Meya, for opening the doors of instruction to me and their continual support, helpfulness and interest in this book. Even though the library of the Institut del Proxim Orient Antic includes an outstanding collection on Assyriology, my work on this thesis has re-quired the consultation of many works that cannot be found in Catalan librar-ies. Each of the following individuals has assisted me to a greater or lesser extent in making good these gaps in the bibliography from a range of cities (Chicago, Heidelberg, London, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Tübingen): Prof. Dr. Alfonso Archi, Dr. Juan Belmonte, Dr. Jaume Llop, Dr. Ignacio Mar-quez, Dr. Adelina Millet, Prof. Dr. Manuel Molina, Dr. Juan Oliva, Salva-dor Ramirez and Dr. Carmen Valdés. On the other hand, I must thank espe-cially Adelina Millet for her many comments, corrections, improvements and suggestions for various drafts of the book. I am grateful to Profs. Daniel E. Fleming, Manuel Molina, Marcel Sigrist and Dr. Betina I. Faist for several consultations on matters of detail. It is unnecessary to add that all the mis-takes contained in the book are mine and mine alone. I also wish to thank Brill for accepting this book for publication, as well as Prof. Dr. Agusti Alemany for making the initial contact with the pub-lisher. On the other hand, I wish to thank Dr. W.G.E. Watson for agreeing to translate this work from the original typescript in Catalan. Beyond the strictly academic realm, I wish to thank all my family, espe-cially my father, Jordi Feliu, for the support they have always given me, particularly at the initial stages when it seemed to be such a risky project with very little future. On the other hand, the constant support of my wife, Ester Massanés, has been the decisive and vital factor in bringing this vessel to a safe harbour.

He is already well attested in the oldest cuneiform texts found in Syria and is frequently documented in almost all the deposits where cuneiform texts of the third and second millennium have been found in that region. In spite of all that, he is a god who has not yet been well described. The geographical spread of the sources and the wide chronological range that they cover make it diffi-cult for a complete study, and in fact for seventy years no-one has made the attempt. There are several ways of classifying the deities worshipped by the peo-ples who lived in the Ancient Near East. The commonest system is to set up ethno-linguistic classifications that are still a matter for discussion, and accordingly to speak of 'Sumerian', 'Akkadian', 'Babylonian', 'Human', 'Semitic' deities, etc. By and large this is the system most used by modern scholars. The bibliography is replete with such expressions as 'Human pantheon', 'Semitic deity' or 'Sumerian mother goddesses'. Obviously, this comment is not intended as a criticism; on the contrary, the reader will be able to verify how this terminology is used unreservedly in the present work; we have to make ourselves understood in some way. Another possible system for classifying deities is to group them accord-ing to their chief attributes and in this way it is possible to break the barri-ers by setting up classifications based on ethno-linguistic geography. We may speak, then, of 'creator deities', 'underworld gods', or simply of 'mother goddesses', and in this way the perspective is purely diachronic and, as a result, we require a specific place and time in order to define the deities to which we are referring.1 There is also another label that can be hung on the various numinous be-ings of the Ancient Near East; we can say that there are 'explained' and 'unexplained' deities. When we refer to the first group, we are indicating any such numen adequately described by the ancient sources. Basically, they are deities who take part actively in myths, legends and epic poems, where they appear with a specific and more or less three-dimensional character, that gives a clear indication of the role that deity in the general framework of his or her pantheon. In this way, modern scholars start from sufficiently 'firm' foundations in order to be able to work on and digest the non-literary docu-mentation which, although it comprises the largest proportion of the mate-rial, in fact is very meagre when it comes to making a 'stable' profile of the deity. The cases of An, Enlil, Enki, Inanna, Marduk, Adad or Nergal are good illustrations of examples of 'explained' deities. The other group, the 1 On these two ways of classifying deities cf. Β. KlENAST, Or 54 ( 1985) 106f."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"set of 'unexplained' deities comprises a whole series of numina that do not appear in the literary texts and are not described in any ritual, though some of them, at least, seem to be very popular in specific regions of the Ancient Near East. There is no doubt that this 'classification' does not contribute anything to our knowledge of the religions of the Ancient Near East, but corresponds to pure empirical observation of the facts. Even so, it is clear that we are dependent on the possible discovery of new material that illumi-nates and transforms into 'explained', deities that up till now were not, but in these disciplines who is not dependent on the chance of a new archaeo-logical find? There is no need to say that Dagan belongs to the second group. There is little evidence of him in Babylonia,2 and the main documentary quarry comes from Syria,3 the origin and principal focus of his cult. That is why we have chosen this region in order to delimit our study in terms of geogra-phy. Syria is the marrow of the bone in devotion to Dagan; all the material that lies outside this region will be illuminating when there is no Syrian material, but the little material on Dagan from Babylonia and Assyria only provides a small retouch to the general portrait of the god. From this point of view, the fact that most of the material comes from Syria illustrates, to some extent, why Dagan continues to be an 'unexplained' god. In contrast to the almost suffocating wealth of sources from Babylonia and Assyria, with a respectable amount of literary texts that describe the life and character of the gods, Syria is, for the moment, much more parsimonious when it comes to providing textual material and even more in respect of literary texts of local tradition. The Ugaritic myths are virtually the only excep-tion.4 Unfortunately, Dagan's role in this collection of literary texts is prac-tically non-existent, a fact that makes it difficult to establish a faithful portrait of him.5 Dagan is a little known god because he is a 'marginal' god from the Babylonian viewpoint. In spite of that, he is 'central' in the eyes of Syria. This had already been noted by H. SCHMÖKEL the first (and so far the last) scholar to write a monograph on Dagan.6 This work and the later summary published in RIA in the thirties were to be the foundation and main source of information about Dagan during the first half of the twentieth century. There is no need to add that the references to Dagon in the Bible and in 2 In this book the geographical term 'Babylonia' refers to the region that other scholars call Sourthern Iraq or the land of Sumer and Akkad. Conscious that this terminology could be unsuitable, especially in respect of the period before the Old Babylonian period, we use it as being the simplest and easiest to understand, especially if we are looking at matters from the Syrian or 'western' point of view. 3 By 'Syria' we mean the region that runs from the West of Babylonia as far as the Mediterranean, and the Anatolian high plateau as far as the Arabian desert. 4 If we leave out of consideration some Hurro-Hittite rituals that must certainly follow Syrian mythological models and the texts of the Old Testament, that provide a somewhat negative view of the religiosity that surrounded Yahwism. 5 The absence of Dagan from the literary texts of Ugarit is due to reasons that need not be discussed here; cf. 5.2. below. 6 H. SCHMÖKEL, Der Gott Dagan. Ursprung, Verbreitung und Wesen seines Kultes, Leipzig 1928, 2f. (doctoral thesis, Heidelberg, directed by Α. Götze)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Philo of Byblos would generate a number of studies on that god, especially in biblical encyclopaedias and in studies on the works of Philo. Neverthe-less, the first work that was to make full use of all the cuneiform material available to him was by H. SCHMÖKEL. After the thirties, the important epigraphical discoveries in Ugarit started to change the 'fixed' description of Syrian religion, and in particular, the portrait of Dagan that had been con-solidated with the contribution made by H. SCHMÖKEL. The first to make a step forward and realise the need to turn to the study of Dagan in accordance with the new material was F.J. MONTALBANO,7 who provided a systematic survey of the material from Babylonia from the third millennium to the Old Babylonian period, analysed the Canaanite sources (basically from El cAmarna, Ugarit and Philo of Byblos), and finally attempted to establish a general portrait of the god, as well as discussing the unavoidable problem of his etymology. Almost at the same time E. DHORME8 published an article on the god Dagon, based principally on evidence from the Bible and Phoe-nician and classical sources, as well as studying the documents from Baby-lonia and Syria, making important contributions especially in respect of the texts from Mari. From the start, the Ugaritic texts and Dagan's marginal role in Ugaritic myths was to cause concern among scholars that quickly was reflected in scholarly discussion. J. FONTENROSE was one of the first to tackle this problem in an article devoted exclusively to the relationship between Dagon and El, on the basis of the paternity he apparently shared with Bacl.9 During the sixties, comparisons with Dagan continued to be made exclusively from the biblical and classical viewpoint,10 but the publi-cation of new material from Ugarit (Ug 5), especially the god-lists, was to provide important data for the study of the Ugaritic pantheon in general and for Dagan in particular. In this connection particular mention must be made of the contribution by E. LAROCHE who showed that Dagan was to be identified with Kumarbi.11 The first to make an in-depth synthesis of Syr-ian religion that included the material from Ugarit was H. GESE, whose study, with an outline portrait of each deity, has stood the test of time and today is still useful for scholars.12 Although not exclusively devoted to Dagan, the contribution by J.J.M. ROBERTS in connection with our god revived the atmospheric thesis —based on identification with Enlil and an etymology related to Arabic— and especially, it was to introduce the thesis of the underworld character of the god,13 which was discussed by J.F. HEALEY in a lengthy article.14 Already in the eighties, N. WYATT, follow-ing the new trend started by ROBERTS of considering Dagan as having an 7 CBQ 13 (1951) 381-397. 8 RHD 745-754.

D.O. EDZARD for Mesopotamia and M.H. POPE for Syria each attempted an important summary, for the time, in two entries on Dagan in the dictionary of mythology16 that even today is still an indispensable refer-ence work. The next important contribution in connection with the figure of Dagan was to come from the hands of the duo G. ΡΕΤΊΠΝΑΤΟ - H. WAETZOLDT, who devoted an article to the study of Dagan in the third millennium. G. PETTINATO focused on the Eblaite sources, which comprise very important documentary evidence for the level of worship of Dagan in this period in the Middle Euphrates, but unfortunately not all the proposals made by PETTINATO remain valid today. H. WAETZOLDT's contribution is focused basically on the Sargonic and Ur III periods. The documentation available to him was much more stable than the Eblaite sources that PETTINATO had to deal with. Both the study and the conclusions reached by H. WAETZOLDT can still be considered valid today.17 The publication of the Middle Babylonian texts from Emar was the final great leap forward that we have made in the last twenty years, since the archives preserve a large number of ritual texts in the Syrian tradition that help to complement and define more precisely the data from the texts of Ugarit.18 The fundamental contributions of the nineties have been by D.E. FLEMING for Emar, J.-M. DURAND for Mari and A. ARCHI for Ebla.19 On the other hand, some arti-cles from a biblical viewpoint20 that appeared in the last ten years, or the portrait of the god by scholars already mentioned21 are other works that do not contribute anything new to our knowledge of the god.22 It is clear, then, that since the summary written by H. SCHMÖKEL in the twenties, there has been no comparable attempt to update and redefine the portrait and character of Dagan using all the new sources that have appeared over the years. It is evident that a monograph on that god, from both the synchronic and diachronic aspects, is fully justified. The extremely impor-tant epigraphic finds in Syria in the second half of the twentieth century have far exceeded the work by SCHMÖKEL and a large part of later contribu-tions. The partial studies that have been made on Dagan do not cover all the aspects or sources that are available to us; as a result, it is necessary to make a study using all the documentation in an attempt to draw a portrait of the god that is as definitive as possible.

Many of the conclusions of CROWELL concur with those of the present work."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"cal and chronological limits chosen for this book. The basic motive for deciding to study Dagan in Syria in the Bronze Age is that, in terms of place an time, the period and the region chosen are 'central'. Syria is the original homeland of the god and the principal sanctuaries of his cult are there; the worship he was to receive outside Syria is marginal and does not contribute decisive facts for study of him. On the other hand, the Bronze Age is a period that is particularly rich in documentary evidence from Syria and coincides with the time when the cult of Dagan was most widespread. During the first millennium, Dagan virtually disappears from Syrian sources, indicating perhaps a decline in his worship. The cuneiform sources from Syria are the central nucleus for the study of Dagan and, in conse-quence, fully justify the chronological limits we have established for study of him in this book. Of course, whenever necessary we shall refer to first millennium sources, but always to illustrate or contrast with the 'central' data from Bronze Age Syria. The backbone of this book is formed by the sources from Ebla and Mari for the third millennium, the sources from Mari for the Old Babylonian period and the sources from Emar and Ugarit for the Middle Babylonian period. Of course there are other archives that supplement the contribution made by these sources, but, without the important quarry of the archives we have just mentioned, it would have been difficult to write this book. Fortu-nately, these four archives cover almost the whole of the Bronze Age and help to provide a diachronic view, but unfortunately, none of the archives mentioned covers the whole chronological range that interests us, which would have given us a development of the cult that is much more reliable, whereas we have to resign ourselves to the snapshots that each of these archives provides. The evidence, then, is fragmentary and we are unable to have an overall synchronic view. It is risky to try to relate the evidence provided by Ebla in the third millennium to the documentation from Ugarit or Emar; each still has to be studied separately. In spite of everything, there is no avoiding an attempt at making a general portrait, collecting together all the partial stills and reconstruct a hypothetical film with some continu-ity. Once the partial portraits for each of the periods studied have been drawn, in the final chapter, this attempt at reconstruction will be made in the guise of general conclusions. * * * The system of bibliographical references followed in this book is the one traditional in Assyriology. Full citation of the titles of monographs and articles has been avoided. For monographs cited more than once an abbreviation is used. Reference to articles is by the abbreviation of the journal, the year and the page number; the abbreviation 'p.' (page) is used before the page number only when this could be misunderstood or confused, generally with a text number; thus ARM 26/1 207 refers to text 207, but J.-M. DURAND, ARM 26/1 p. 407 refers to the page in question. When there is no possibility of confusion, the abbreviation for 'page' is not given. The use of expressions such as op./art. cit., ibdm., etc., for references to works"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"already cited in the book is avoided; the works are always cited in the same manner. A special way of numbering is provided for citing the texts studied (MA:T 1 = Mari Text no. 1, etc), for ease of internal references within the book; however, the complete text reference is given at the beginning of the transliteration in a footnote. The keys for these abbreviations are given in the section 'General Abbreviations'. As for Old Babylonian proper names and names from Emar, a specific abbreviation is used for texts published outside these collections; this means that when the proper name Dagan-nērī in Mari occurs in various texts, one of which is published outside the series ARM, so as not have excessively long bibliographical references citing author, journal, year, page and line, we have preferred to cite by tablet number and line, e.g. A.3562: VII 29'. In the case of texts with an extremely long or unknown tablet number we have resorted to a bibliographical abbreviation, e.g. ASJ 12/10: 23; the key to finding the specific publication of texts A.3562 or ASJ 12/10 is in the section 'Abbreviations of texts'. The same applies to Old Babylonian proper names and names from Emar that comprise the principal part of the onomastic material that we shall study in order to economise on space and time. * * * During the final stages of preparing this book for publication, three works have appeared that could not be taken into consideration.

The almost complete absence of epigraphic material in Syria in this period —a few inscribed votive objects from Mari comprise the appropriate exception— have forced us to begin our research in later periods, leaving this period in the obscurity of the 'prehistory' of Dagan. The earliest document that was available to H. SCHMÖKEL, in his pioneering study on Dagan, was the bilingual inscription of Sargon of Akkad and the next oldest was the in-scription of Tūra-Dagan, Sakkanakkum of Mari, moving on next to analyse the Code of Hammurapi and the inscriptions from Mari from the OB pe-riod.1 The great discovery of the royal archives of Ebla and the publication of the few, but valuable pre-Sargonic tablets from Mari have made possible a wider and more accurate view of Syria in the second half of the third mil-lennium. The existence of other important archives of the same period in lower Mesopotamia2 has made it possible to compare two great literary centres immmediately prior to the Sargonic period. In recent years there has been a new find of documents from this period, or slightly later, in Tell Beydar in the upper region of the yābūr. Fortunately, most of the corpus from this deposit has already been published.3 2.1. Ebla Ebla (modern Tell MardTh), a large site about 65 km south of Aleppo, was to supply the Assyriological community with an archive of some 20,000 catalogue numbers of cuneiform tablets and small fragments of tablets dat-ing approximately to the middle of the third millennium. This discovery has allowed first hand information to be gained about a period (the third millennium) and a region (Syria) for which previously there was very little documentation. Over the last twenty-eight years of research (the first group of 40 texts came to light in 1974, and during 1975 most of the tablets were discovered), a large number of texts has been published, many of them surrounded by arguments and personal suspicions that have not been very illuminating. However, leaving aside such bitter disputes, today it seems 1 Cf. H. SCHMÖKEL, Dagan 3, 13f. 2 For the texts from Abū-Sa1ābīb cf. R.D. BIGGS, Inscriptions from Tell Abū Salābīkh. OIP 99.

Most of the documents are texts of an economic and administrative na-ture, and deal with business transactions of various products, textiles, met-als and animals being the most numerous. There are also documents that are particularly relevant for religion, such as those referring to offerings for the cult. The administrative texts are a good quarry for gathering theophoric proper names that will help us to see what the 'popular pantheon' of the period was. Other types of text are the lexical texts. These can be divided into two types: monolingual lists, which comprise long lists of words ar-ranged by semantic field in the traditional Sumerian manner, and bilingual lists, that are vocabularies with a Sumerian word and its corresponding Semitic translation. The lexical lists are one of the most important sources for knowing the character of certain deities at Ebla, since one section of the bilingual vocabulary is devoted to listing various deities with both their Sumerian and Semitic forms. Thus, this is an extremely valuable tool for knowing the reading of many divine names that in context are only written logographically. The literary and historical texts are very difficult to inter-pret, but in spite of that many of them will be of great importance for the reconstruction of Eblaite religion. The presence of Dagan in the archives from Ebla seems to be meagre, in fact it only appears to be attested in the personal names; in spite of that, the identification of Dagan with <d>BE is the key to undertsanding his role within the pantheon, what his attributes were and what was the extent of his cult. First of all we shall see what references there are to (d)BE in context and in the personal names, as well the documentation on Dagan in the proper names (the only context where it is written out syllabically: Ada-gan or da-ga-an), to be able to see whether the identification is always possible or in some cases it needs retouching. G. PETTINATO was the first to identify (d)BE with Dagan,4 considering it to be an epithet of the god, 'il Signore', but, in the same work, dBE bù-la-nu ' was already translated 'Dagan di Bulan(u)' by the Italian scholar, who interpreted dBE virtually as if it functioned as a logogram. Previously, he had interpreted BE in the same way, translating é - d u r U5-BE 'rione di Dagan' and in this way he established that there was a gate (not documented) and a quarter of the city with the name of Dagan.5 In his study of the Eblaite calendar, G. PETTINATO interpreted the month BE-/Í as the commemoration of a festival dedicated to the king (the lord) or a feast dedicated to Dagan, who, according to G. PETTINATO, is 'The Lord' par excellenceLater, in MEE 2 G. PETTINATO translated the syntagm é : BE 4 OA 18 (1979) 103. 5 G. PETTINATO - P.

In MEE 2 14 obv. II 12 dBE du-du-lu' is translated 'Dagan di Tuttul'. In an article on Dagan in Eblaite texts, G. PETTINATO provided the reasons for the interpretation and identification of <d)BE with Dagan.8 The principal reasons, according to the author, are the following: a) The Eblaite vocabulary (VE)9 gives the following equivalents in the AN section: VE 795a: dBE KALAM-TIM = Tl-lu ma-tim VE 795b: d<BE> KALAM-TIM = BE-lu ma-tim PETTINATO interprets BE-/w ma-tim as 'lord of the land' and reads Tl-lu (VE 795a) as ti-lu, relating this term to Semitic tl 'dew',10 relating it to the presumed character of Dagan as a weather god. On the other hand, he also connects BE-lu ma-tim with the dl u g a 1 ma-tim of Mari, who is identified with Dagan by G. DOSSIN.11 b) The presence of dBE du-du-lu/la\" in the texts from Ebla, interpreted by PETTINATO as the 'Lord of Tuttul', that could not be any other god except Dagan. c) The possibility of the variant spelling of a proper name of the same person using BE and Dagan without distinction (Enna-Dagan = Enna-BE). These three reasons are the basis for the systematic identification that make PETTINATO equate almost all the <d)BE of Ebla with Dagan.12 In the second edition of his monograph on Ebla, the author reasserts his conviction that 'all' the dBE are to be identified with Dagan, even proposing henotheism in the Eblaite religion, given the 'abstract' concept of the name for the principal god of the pantheon ('the Lord').13 In later works, G. PETTINATO has continued to revise his translations and recently, in the latest volume of his publication of the Eblaite texts, he translates dBE GN 'il Signore di GN'14 or 'divino Be di GN',15 without specifying the god to which it refers. In spite of all that, in his latest mono-graph on Ebla he again reasserts his earlier arguments, identifying 'the Lord' as head of the pantheon.16 be-li for the lit is impossible since in the III millennium the 'normal' spelling is be-lt (cf.

ARCHI was also inclined, at first, to identify dBE with Dagan, interpreting it as a 'logogram'17 or as an abbreviation of bêlu, a special epithet of Dagan.18 The volumes of ARET in which A. ARCHI has collaborated gloss over the problem of the reading and interpretation of this sign, varying between reading an interpretative dBE and a more neutral dBAD.19 In spite of this doubtful approach, ARCHI was to provide definitive proof for the interpretation of 1 BE as a logogram for Dagan. The PN of a musician from Ebla called Enna-Dagan (written syllabically) appears in one text written en-na-BE, accompanied by the same persons as in the other texts.20 This must be the almost conclusive proof of the identification between BE and Dagan (we shall come back to this topic later). In spite of this fact, A. ARCHI is dubious about applying the equation (d,BE = Dagan globally, and only applies it when it refers to Tuttul, the known cult centre of that god,21 doubting the relationship with the dBE of VE 795a/b.22 In recent works, A. ARCHI again asserts the idea of associating dBE with bēlum and interpreting it as a hypostasis of Dagan only in specific instances (Tuttul and Ganana').23 Other scholars have followed one of these two positions with greater or less 'fidelity': L. CAGNI followed G. PETTINATO's proposal without any changes, translating all the dBE as Dagan;24 P. XELLA also did the same, at first,25 as did P. MANDER;26 I. SINGER27 also accepts PETTINATO's identification. We now move on to see the references to dBE, both in context and in the onomasticon, in the second set together with the PNN with Dagan written syllabically. 2.1.1. <d)BE in context Recently A.

MILANO, ARET 9: dBE. E. SOLLBERGER (ARET 8 10) is more explicit as he interprets dbe as an abbreviation or logogram of bēlurn '1ord(-god)'.

Thus there are no references in the rituals (type B) or in the legal documents (type C). This information is important in order to establish to what extent the god is involved in each sphere of religion. 2.1.1.1. Offering lists of the 'official cult' These texts comprise twenty documents in which are recorded, at the begin-ning of each, the sheep that have been sacrificed to the various deities by the king, his family and other members of the royal court. The remainder of the texts record other consignments of goods and food to various people. They are, then, administrative documents in which there is 'concentrated' informa-tion about offerings to deities, but we have to bear in mind that their rele-vance for the study of Eblaite religion is purely circumstantial, and that they are by no means 'religious' documents nor do they 'speak about religion'. Out of these only four have been published by G. PETTINATO.29 According to A. ARCHI the texts are very stereotyped30 and possibly the publication of the whole corpus would not contribute more than is provided by the four texts at our disposal. Thus they are give a partial picture of what we may call the religion of the palace,31 the religion of the members of the royal family to the extent that heads of a 'state' and persons with a prominent 'political office', which need not be exactly the same as the religion of the piety of 'ordinary people'. In the lists of offerings we find that BE occurs seven times: EB:T 1 Two sheep in the month of A.

MEE 5 p. 79 §70). According to PETTINATO the term s a -ζ a,1\" refers to the administrative centre of Ebla ('governatorato'); this interpretation has been followed by several scholars, cf. P.

Other scholars do not provide a translation and even do not confirm the reading, cf. D.O. EDZARD, ARET 2 116 i.v. 'SA'+...ki. For the current position cf. M.

KREBERNlK's interpretation of the VE 1154: SIKIL = àr-<dal>-tum Iwardalum(P.)I Akk. wardatu 'Mädchen' (ZA 73 [1983] 31). At first, G. PETTINATO explained the term as a kind of 'festival' or 'ritual' of purification (cf. OA 18 [1979] 122; WGE 309f., and recently MEE 5 p. 110 §93 v. XI 7).

Local dedications of'BE and the cult In the texts published so far, the following local dedications to (d)BE occur: - dBE Buran(u): is only documented three times in the archives from Ebla. It is the cult centre of the god NIdabal. M. BONECHI locates it near the Orontes.113 - dBE Gaga: Unlocated place-name, occurs only once; we do not know whether it has any connection with ga-kamt or whether it is possibly a mistake for Ganana.114 - llBE Ganana('i/um): the reading and location of this place-name has been the subject of fierce debate. G. PETTINATO has always defended the identification with Canaan.115 A. ARCHI proposed identifying the place-name with a city close to Gasur in the middle Euphrates valley,116 or more specifically, close to Emar.117 D.O. EDZARD locates it in north Syria.118 We are inclined towards A. ARCHI's interpretation, which seems more prudent. Its location depends on the location of Gasur, which is possibly situated north-west of Mari,119 so that it is possible to consider a location in the Middle Euphrates region.120 - dBE Ma'NE: the place-name also occurs in connection with the god dŠa-nu-ga-ar, who is completely unknown, and especially with Išbara.121 - dBE Sa'ad: unidentified and unlocated place-name. There are very few references.122 - dBE ŠiNEš(u): only connected with dBE.123 113 Cf. A. ARCHI, SEb 1 (1979) 107f.; RGTC 12/1 81. 114 Cf. ARES 2 227. M.

In the light of these facts from Mari in the old Babylonian period we may venture an identification with Uakkulan, cult centre of Dagan, including a temple tentatively located some 25 kilometers north of Emar, on the left bank of the Euphrates, but it would require the change in name of the city to be explained. For this location cf. F. JOANNÈS, MARI 8 (1997) 396. 121 On Išbara and Ma'NE and the possible location of the place-name on the route between Ebla and Mari cf. D. PRECHEL, Išbara 17; for a location north of Emar, on the Euphrates cf. ARES 2 234. For a possible location close to the middle Euphrates (east of Ebla) cf. M. BONECHI, RGTC 12/1 227. 122 Cf.

In the texts of Ebla, Tuttul is connected with dBE (with the variants lugal/dingir Tuttul125) and with dŠa-a-ša,l2(> i.e. Ša1aš,127 the consort of Dagan and later of Kumarbi.128 - dBE Uguad: unidentified place-name. There are two more texts that record gifts to Isfoara and to the consort of NIdabal (dBE-m i). Possibly to be located in a region near Ebla.129 - dBE Ziwidu: Occurs only once. Possibly located in north-west Syria.130 P. MANDER has proposed the reading sí-bì-ša4, connecting it with s/-NE-swkl (reading si-piysú).131 The devotion for the divine statue is documented in texts EB:T 7 and EB:T 28 in respect of dBE of Tuttul, and also for dBE of Ganana in texts EB:T 13 andEB:T 17e. Possibly there was a statue with the most important local epithets in Ebla itself, so that it seems that there was an image of dBE of Tuttul and of Ganana at Ebla. We cannot be certain whether the various gifts and offerings were intended for the Eblaite images or for the original temples of cult. According to A. ARCHI, most of the cultic acts described in the texts were performed in Ebla.132 The existence of a temple of dBE of Ganana at Ebla seems assured from the allocation of clothing made to the temple singers (EB:T 56), but in spite of that, there are cases where it seems clear that the offerings are made to the 'original' temple of the god, as in text EB:T 11 that records the donation of some clothing to dBE of Ganana, through the inspector of the king of Emar. Certainly the inspector, on re-turning to Emar, made the donation to the temple of Ganana. The references to the temple of dBE of Tuttul (EB:T 47 and EB:T 54) always refer to the original temple, and there is no reason to think of the existence of a temple to this god in Ebla. The temple of dBE ma-tum (EB:T 55), seems to be located in Ebla. As for the personnel of temples, there is a reference to a maid servant of the temple of dBE of Tuttul (EB:T 57) and two smiths of the lies in the interpretation of the first sibilant, M. BONECHI states that the š is represented by the signs that begin with s, and the ζ in signs with s or z, accepting a possible interference between the signs of the series š and ζ (RGTC 12/1 XXXIf.). It seems possible, then that the two variants refer to the same place-name. 124 Cf. the article on Tuttul in Ebla by A. ARCHI, Fs. Küpper 197f. Cf. also ARES 2 202f.; M.

The pāšišu (written PA4.ŠEŠ133), literally 'the anointers', are a type of priest at the service of various deities and also of members of the royal family. There is evidence for a pāšišu-priest of llBE of Tuttul (EB:T 59) and one of dBE of Sa ad (EB:T 60), the references are too meagre for conclusions to be drawn.134 The temple of dBE of Ganana was provided with singers to perform the cultic ceremonies, EB:T 56 documents the consignment of clothes for these singers. Also well documented is the purification ritual of dBE of Tuttul (EB:T 10) and of dBE of Ganana (EB:T 33b), the latter accompanied by the purifica-tion of Adda, of Alu of Zigu, of Rasap of Adadu and of two local dedica-tions of NIdabal, NIdabal of (L)arugadu and NIdabal of Luban. We do not know whether this purification ritual (s i k i 1) was regular or unusual, or whether the 'purification' was performed on several deities simultaneously or only on one. In the case of Astabil, a purification ceremony of this god in the month that bears his name is well documented.135 There is also a ritual of 'purification' of the king's house.136 According to P. MANDER,137 fol-lowing G. PETTINATO, this ceremony was performed to cure someone who was ill. In our opinion, this hypothesis has been well refuted by F. POMPONIO. The fact that there is a regular s i k i 1-ritual, in the case of Astabil, invalidates the hypothesis of an illness.138 EB:T 5 delivers various consignments of textiles and metal objects among people of various regions. One of the deliveries describes the offering made by the leaders of the team for the journey of dBE of Ganana, possibly towards Ebla. Naturally, it was the journey of the image of the god from Ganana to Ebla where he was given a religious festival of some kind. EB:T 63 may also document a jour-ney of BE to Armi, but unfortunately the text is difficult to interpret.139 This custom of taking a divine image on a journey is documented for other deities at Ebla, cf. the case of Astar sarbat.140 The ceremony of the oath (nam-kus) is well documented in connec-tion with the temple of dBE of Tuttul.141 According to A.

In the oath of the king of Nagar and the Eblaite chancellery at the temple of dBE of Tuttul two other 'sovereigns' (the e η - e n) also take part who were possibly under the tutelage of the king of Nagar.146 This oath performed in Tuttul emphasises the importance of the temple of dBE for the whole region, and explains the later visit and prostration of Sargon of Ak-kad before the same sanctuary when he conquered the Middle Euphrates region as far as the cedar forest and silver mountains.147 2.1.2. Dagan and BE in the onomasticon Dagan is well attested in the Eblaite onomasticon. It is the only context where the god('s name) is written out syllabically ('d)da-gan —the more common spelling— or da-ga-an). Alongside this there is a fair number of proper names with the element BE that, as we have seen, some scholars identify with Dagan. 2.1.2.1. Dagan in the onomasticon 1.

The distribution of this PN is the following: seven PNN of persons from Mari,165 three from Tub,166 two persons from Ebla167 and one from each of the following towns: Emar,168 Karmu,169 Gilidu,170 yalsum,171 Sur'ub,172 Tuttul,173 Urša'um and Uzamu.174 Of the nineteen proper names, two come from localities that are on the banks of the Euphrates (Mari, Emar and Tuttul). Now we shall try to determine the pantheon of the onomasticon in each of these localities, where Dagan occurs in the proper names of its inhabitants, in order to determine the role of that god within the various onomastic traditions: - Emar: the onomasticon from Emar allows us to draw a fairly accurate picture of the popularity of the deities.175 Dāmu176 is the most frequent divine name, occurring in six names, followed by Malik with five and then Aštar, BE, Dagan, II, KUra and Llm with only one personal name each. Evidently, the picture is very diferent from Mari, where Dagan only occurs once; it is possible that the considerably smaller number of proper names from Emar at Ebla gives a somewhat distorted impression, but even so, 125 names seems a high enough number to be able to draw some firm conclusions. Particularly noteworthy is the contrast with Emar of the middle period when there was an overwhelming preponderance of proper names with Dagan. 164 In some cases it is difficult to determine whether the same personal name indicates the same person in different texts so that the identification we have proposed is tentative and subject to a more rigorous prosopographic study of the texts from Ebla, which is not even remotely the aim of the present book. Even so, the facts, while largely indicative, may be useful and meaningful for our purposes. 165 1. Buda-Dagan 1 ú - k a r ma-rt'. 2. Enna-Dagan 1 ú - k a r ma-ri\". 3. Enna-Dagan 1 u g a 1 ma-n4.

Using the index provided by A. ARCHI,178 with a total of 290 proper names, we obtain the following picture: the best represented deity is II, with twenty proper names, the second is Dagan, with seven7,179 third BE, with five180, and then Utu, with three occurrences, Malik and Dāmu181 with two and lastly Enki182 and KUra with one. - Sur'ub: the best documented name in this city is Malik, with eleven names, followed by II with four, BE and Dāmu with three and lastly Kamis and Dagan with one. The location of the village remains uncertain.183 - Tuttul: identified with modern Tell Blca. There is one PN with Dagan, one with II and one with Malik.184 - Tub: is probably related to the Tūbā of the second millennium, identified by P. MATTHIAE with Umm el-Marra, 47 km. from Aleppo.185 Of the theophoric personal names from Tūb,186 Malik is the god with most occurrences (four) followed by Dagan (three), Dāmu (two) and Aštar, Il and Šamagan (one each). - Ursa'um: identified with the Ursum of the second millennium, is a village located west of Carchemish.187 There are few theophoric personal names in the texts from Ebla.

Babylon. This possiblity is much less likely due to the presence of other deities also atested with the same type of personal name (Ir'am-d[i n g i r]/Malik (MAD 3 230). On the other hand, to consider KURkl =šadû as an epithet that is closely connected with Dagan in the third millennium is contradicted by names such as e-a-SA-TU, a/-/ar-SA-TU or' TM-SA-TU (cf. MAD 3 264). Later, in OB Mari there occur the personal names Dagan-šadûni, but cf. also Ea-šadûni and Šadìma-EI (cf. C.G. RASMUSSEN, SAPN 368).

ARCHI, the frequency of Dagan and of BE in the onomasticon is very similar,256 however, what is not similar are the elements that accompany them, only Enna- and Puzur- coincide with both Dagan and BE, which is completely normal if we remember that these two elements are those most represented in the onomasticon of Ebla.257 An analysis of the facts available to us begins to indicate that Dagan and <d)BE are completely different. Of the proper names with BE, all those that have a possessive suffix do not refer to any specific divine name and still less to Dagan, who, as we have been able to see, never has a possessive suffix on personal names writ-ten syllabically. In the case of BE + suffix, it seems more reasonable to explain its as an appellative: 'his lord'. 2.1.3. \"\"BE and Dagan at Ebla The reading bēlum or ba'lum of BE is well enough documented in VE 795a/b, where the equivalence BE-/w258 allows no doubt about the reading. A. ARCHI259 proposes the reading bax of BAD accepted by several scholars.260 VE 795a with the reading Tl-lu is only a scribal mistake for BAD due to the similarity between the two signs.261 W. G. LAMBERT provides proofs for the reading be 'al (or rather ba 'al) due to the occurrence of dba '-ak KALAM-TIM in a literary text.262 The reading belum / ba'(a)l of BE is by no means strange in the pre-Sargonic period in lower Mesopotamia; see the proper names of Abū-Sa1ābīt( BE-íí-ga;263 the proper names, also of Abu-Sa1ābīb, BE-ŠINIG and &?-e/-ŠINIG from the Old Babylonian period;264 or the evidently logographic reading BE DUB 'owner of the document' at Abu-Sa1ābīb·265 In pre-Sargonic Mari there occurs the name BE-su-dùr (BAD) 'His lord is the fortress.'266 At Ebla we can contrast the reading BE in the text published by G. PETTINATO, and later by M. KREBERNIK, where the following passage occurs: áa-dar-wa-an / BE / t i8muäcn-t i8mu5en 'Adarwan, the lord of the eagles.'267 The question as to 256 Cf. Fs.

The only fact that supported this possibility was the presence in Ebla of a musician whose name was written with Dagan and with BE (cf. page 2, above), but M. V. TONIETTI, in his studies on the η a r at Ebla, established an internal chronology of the texts and a sequence in the lists based on the rank of the musicians (n a r - m a b 'expert musician' and η a r -1 u r 'apprentice musician'). According to this rigid order for listing the η a r, Enna-Dagan is cited for the last time as a nar-maj), where as he no longer appears in the next list. Instead, in this same list, Enna-BE features in the group of η a r -1 u r. This fact, a backwards step in the career of a η a r that has no known parallel, shows quite clearly that, from prosopographic criteria, Enna-Dagan and Enna-BE are not the same person.269 Adding this fact to the evidence from the onomasticon, where BE occurs with possessive suffixes —which rules out the reading or ascription of the epithet to a specific deity, suggesting the generic interpretation 'his lord'— and the very clear case of the name Samagan-BE 'Samagan is the lord',270 completely excludes the reading 'Dagan' of BE due to an equivalence that is not at all documented at Ebla. From the point of view of theology, the identification made by G. PETTINATO of dBE KALAM-TIM of the VE 795a/b with the BëlQ u g a 1) mātim from Mari is feasible, but what has been queried, sensibly, is the equivalence with Dagan proposed by G. DOSSIN. J.-M. DURAND queries this equivalence. According to him, the real 'King of the land' cannot be Dagan but could be Enlil.271 S. DALLEY identifies the Bēl(Ì u g a 1) mātim with Itūr-Mēr, who, according to DALLEY, is a king of Mari of the old dynasty who has been deified.272 Later, J.-M. DURAND returned to the topic and proposed identifying the Bēl( 1 u g a 1) mātim with the Syrian Storm-god, namely Addu, and more specifically with Addu of Aleppo.273 V. HAAS, HB 125; V.

Cf. also QdS 16 118. A. ARCHI (ARES 1 272) continues to support 'possible' identification of BE and Dagan in the person of the musician Enna-Dagan. 270 Against this statement can be adduced the argument set out by W. VON, SODEN (EDA 89f.) in the sense of interpreting these PNN in parallel with Dagan-Dāmu 'Dagan (and) Dāmu' or KUra-Dāmu 'KUra (and) Dāmu'. These names have parallels in the OB period (e.g. Sîn-u-Šamaš, according to J.J. STAMM comparable to the catholic PN 'Jesus-Maria', cf. ANG 135) but at Ebla they only occur with Dāmu, llum or Urn or other elements that, as we have been able to prove above, have to be interpreted as common nouns or epithets that do not correspond to any particular god or specific cult. 271 Cf.

DOSSIN, then, has no solid foundations and is based on a simple comparison with other gods (basically, Aššur and Marduk274) and on the ascription of the temple of the lions to Dagan, an identification that has been rejected, with sound judgment and conclusive proofs by J.-M. DURAND.275 We shall return to this topic later. If we restrict ourselves to the documentation at our disposal, we can only conclude that Dagan, as such, does not occur in quotations in context in the texts from Ebla. Only the dBE of Tuttul 'The Lord of Tuttul' is Dagan, with almost complete certainty. Even so, no case is specifically named. The sanctuary of Dagan at Tuttul is very well documented from the Sargonic period and during the whole of the second millennium. The most logical conclusion, then, is to think that 'the Lord of Tuttul' is Dagan, and thus, in the light of the documentation from Ebla, Dagan was worshipped at Ebla under this local dedication.276 The presence of a divine statue of the goddess Ša(1)aš, as the consort of dBE in Tuttul (EB:T 18), is further proof for identifying 'The Lord of Tuttul' with Dagan, since in later tradition(s), Dagan has Salas as a consort. This goddess is documented in three other texts from Ebla, but in these cases connected with the god Wada'an(u)277 and with Karramu, which, according to A. ARCHI, is a town to the north-east of Ebla, beyond the Euphrates Valley.278 It is a different matter to consider that all the occurrences of dBE followed by a geographical name are different local manifestations of Dagan, as PETTINATO does. The textual evidence does not allow us to support this hypothesis in any way. There is no apparent connection between the various 'Lords' of the various cities. The facts concerning the various place-names are very meagre and unfortunately we cannot delinate a clear portrait of the various local pantheons. Nevertheless, it seems logical to think that when we have 'Lord ( BE) of Buran(u)' documented, which is the cult centre of NIdabal, it refers to that god and not to Dagan.279 Nor are the cases where dBE occurs without any geographical references attributable to Dagan in any way. The dBE d i n g i r - d i n g i r, on the basis of the documentation available to us, has to be interpreted as a divine epithet that is, unfortunately, unspecified.280 To ascribe them to Dagan, merely because they are written with dBE, is unfounded. Nor is there any fact that allows us even to propose that Dagan was the head of the Eblaite pantheon. KUra, Utu and Adda are the deities that occur in the legal texts or in international treaties. KUra, NIdabal281 and Adda are the gods that occur most often in the 274 Cf. G. DOSSIN, Syria 21 (1940) 229. 275 Cf. MARI 5 (1987) 61 If. 276 Cf. W.G. LAMBERT, MARI 4 (1985) 529 η. 4. 277 F.

For a similar example and an opinion comparable to the one proposed here defended by D. SCHWEMER, Wettergott 113 n. 788. 280 According to G. PETTINATO it is the same deity (Or 54 [ 1985] 238). 281 Recently, P. FRONZAROLI, has suggested identifying NIdabal with Adda based on the reading 'a5-da-BAL Ihadda-ball (MARI 8 [1997] 288f.). M. BONECHI has also proposed a new reading and interpretation of dKU -ra as šuX-ra /Tugra/ \"(The deity of the) victorious"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"administrative texts.282 In the light of these facts, there is no reason to identify Dagan or even dBE with the head of the pantheon.283 A. ARCHI poses the possibility of identifying the dBE of Ganana with Dagan, as he locates Ganana on the Middle Euphrates, and the principal deity of the Middle Euphrates region is Dagan.284 This is certain, but the rule of three does not always have to function. In the ancient city of Ekalte (modern Tell Munbāqa) located in the Middle Euphrates region, a few kilometers north of Emar, a small number of documents of the middle age have been found in which, in the onomasticon, the best documented deity is Dagan285 (also with the spelling dk u r, as in neighbouring Emar). In spite of that, the local deity of the city is Bablaka (àba-af}-la-kâ).2i(> This is a good example to refute ARCHI's arguments, Dagan is the principal deity of the Middle Euphrates region, but does not have to be the head of the various 'local pantheons' of the cities of the region. Dagan could be the 'Lord of Ganana' but there is nothing to substantiate this. Otherwise, the texts document a series of offerings to dBE of Ganana diferent from the rest of the local dBE's, the ox-horns (EB:T20) or 'the sun' of the temple in Ganana (EB:T 21) have no parallels with other liBE's and in particular with the one from Tuttul; in fact the Storm-god (Adda) is the one that habitually receives offerings of ox-horns287 and on one occasion there is reference to the sun of the temple of Adda,288 so that it is possible that the dBE of Ganana continues to be only a local manifestation of the Storm-god. dBE is, then, a generic epithet —'Lord'— that applies to various different local deities, all of them with a cult that is more or less important to Ebla. The different ways of writing dBE in the quotations in context (which is practically uniform except for EB:T 63, a text in an 'irregular' script) and the spelling BE in the onomasticon must also be emphasised. Possibly the divine determinative indicates that we are speaking of a very specific 'Lord', with temple, statue and cult, who is 'disguised' behind a generic denomination. The occurrences of BE in the proper names are generic in reference: 'lord', in the same way that il refers to 'god' without specifying which god it is.289 When one wishes to specify which 'God', the divine determinative is used, e.g. the DN of Mari áil-ba-labX(LAM) (also d i n g i r Weapon\" identifying it also with an epithet of Adda (MARI 8 [1997] 500f.). F. POMPONIO and P. XELLA, (DE 287f.) have proposed the reading ayda-bal, interpreting the DN as /yada-bal/ 'The Lord knows' with a theophoric structure similar to the other Syrian deities such as Itūr-Mēr or Yakrub-El, would simply be a special manifestation of the god Bacl. 282 Cf.

Another fact to emphasise is the almost complete discrepancy between the local forms of dBE and the place-names, where there are some proper names with BE or Dagan. Only Tuttul has a sanctuary dedicated to BE and also onomastic evidence with Dagan. 2.2. Mari The epigraphic documentation from the pre-Sargonic period of Mari basically consists of a total of 42 administrative tablets that record deliveries of various items to the temple or offerings to deities.291 The other epigraphic source of this period comprises the votive inscriptions. There is no documentation in context of Dagan in any of the documents from this period in Mari. The only occurrence is Lugal Terqa: MA:T 1 Sixteen sikil-loaves for Lugal Terqa.292 MA:T2 χ tables, two sheep (and two ) jugs for Lugal Terqa.293 The existence of a temple of Dagan in Terqa is well documented in texts from the Amorite period. Dagan is called 'Lord of Terqa' in a letter from Dām-burāsim to Zimri-Llm.294 The equivalence of 1 u g a 1 with bēlum is well attested in the duplicate texts T.142 and ARM 24 263. In the first text, lugal ter-qá occurs (line 9) and in the second text —in more modern writing— dbe-el t[er-qa '] (line 9).295 Thus it is a local epithet of Dagan that is closely connected with the region, a case that is parallel to the 'Lord of Tuttul' from Ebla. As for the onomasticon, Dagan occurs in only one name: ME-dda-gan.296 D. CHARPIN suggests explaining this name as Simat-Dagan, 290 D. CHARPIN, MARI 5 (1987) 99 and d i n g i r ba-labx(LAM) 81 nr. 22 iii 6. Cf. also W.G. LAMBERT, MARI 6 (1990) 641 and A. ARCHI, OLZ 91 (1996) 145; Or 63 (1994) 250. Cf.

DOSSIN transliterates and translates: [bi'-i]t? d[d]a-gan / [i-na ter)-qa\"' / [ι'-ί]ι-/> '[Le temp1e(?)] de Dagan [à Ter]qa [est en or]dre'. J.-M. DURAND translates this fragment as follows: 'He puesto en orden el templo de Dagan, Serior de Terqa' (MROA 2/1 447). Unfortunately, the transliteration of (line 17: [be-el ter]-qa'' ?) is not added; probably a collation of the text is the reason for the change in translation. 295 Cf. J.-M. DURAND, MARI 4 (1985) 162; MROA 2/1 167 and 172f. 296 T.52 ι 3 (=MARI 5 [1987] 70 nr. 4)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"without providing further information.297 The Eblaite onomasticon provides interesting facts for the interpretation of this PN. Mī-DN 'Who is DN'298 is a type of personal name that is well attested in Ebla. One fact that supports this interpretation is the presence of someone from Man called MT-Dagan in the texts from Ebla. Thus the facts from the onomasticon are meagre, but it should be remembered that there are seven names with Dagan of persons from Mari documented at Ebla.299 2.3. Tell Beydar Tell Beydar, located in the upper yābūr, about 20 kilometers north of Hasakā, has recently provided a small corpus of cuneiform tablets (with 140 catalogue numbers). The date of these tablets is approximately 2400 BCE, with a possible synchronism with Iblul-Il of Mari and also with Igris-yalab of Ebla, according to the chronology proposed by A. ARCHI.300 Both the writing and the language are evidence of influence from lower Mesopotamia and from Ebla. The evidence is not very large, given the administrative nature of most of the documents, but it seems that the religious tradition is also completely different from that of Ebla. Dagan does not occur in context in any documents published so far. Most of the deities are connected with the names of the months: Šamagan, Is^ara or Utu are already known and occur in the calendar, the last two also with the cult documented at Beydar. There is also a series of 'lords' ( BE-/i'm, BE- li su-lurn\\ dBE-lí ŠÚ-SA-/a, dBE-/i' ZI) all occurring as month names or giving their name to a gate/district (k á) of the city. Noteworthy is the almost complete gulf between the Eblaite pantheon and the pantheon of Beydar; most of the deities attested in Ebla do not occur at all in Beydar (KUra, NIdabal, Astabil, Rasap, Adda or Aštar).30' As for the onomasticon, the only 'fully' theophoric personal names attested are: Lú-Šamagan and Ina-Dagan302 'Dagan is mercy'.303 Note-worthy are the presence of the spelling BE for balum, according to PH.

Conclusions In the pre-Sargonic period there is no occurrence in context of Dagan written syllabically^ At Ebla, the (d)BE documented in context and in the onomasticon have to be interpreted as epithets ('the L/lord') and a systematic identification of this epithet with Dagan must be excluded; possibly, given the discrepancy between the evidence from the onomasticon and the evidence from the occurrences in context, they refer to the various local deities of each town. Only the dBE of Tuttul in the sources from Ebla and the Lugal Terqa from Mari are certain evidence for a cult of Dagan during this period. In the case of the Lord of Tuttul, the official cult is documented in the offerings lists (EB:T 2). A 'purification' ritual (s i k i 1) of the Lord of Tuttul is also documented (EB:T 10). The cult is also documented by persons who have come from places that are some distance from Tuttul to swear the 'oath' to the temple (EB:T 54), which shows that it was an important regional sanctuary.305 It is possible that there was worship of a divine image, also in Ebla, as one text dpcuments an offering to the Lord of Tuttul received in Saza (EB:T 8). This passage also documents the cult of other deities as in the case of Aštar, Astabil, NIdabal and Rašap, etc.306 Already in this period there is evidence of a possible consort of the Lord of Tuttul, namely Salasa, who of course is to be identified with the Ša1aš of a later period (EB:T 18).307 As for the onomasticon, Dagan is well represented in the three archaeological sites that have provided epigraphic documentation of this period. The evidence comes from as far away as the upper region of the tJābūr (Tell Beydar) with only one document, although it is valuable, given that there are only two theophoric PNN in this site. Accordingly, in this period the popular cult of Dagan had spread throughout the whole of Syria, from the upper yābūr right up to the more westerly regions documented in the onomasticon of Ebla.308 305 Cf. an 'oath' (n a m - k u5) in the temple of KUra (MEE 7 49 obv. i 1-10). 306 Cf.

In spite of this, Babylonia is particularly rich in documentation for this period, especially during the third dynasty of Ur. Since the aim of this book is to study the central nucleus of the cult of Dagan (Syria), when we do not have enough epigraphic information we shall have to look for it where is such material. In that case, both the kings of the Sargon dynasty and the very abundant economic and administrative material from Ur ΙΠ will allow us to access the documentation on Dagan from the Syrian periphery, since in that case the terms are reversed and the centrality of the cult and worship correspond to Syria, which from the Babylonian point of view, has always been considered as peripheral. We are forced, therefore, to resort to Babylonian sources. In respect of Syria, the information available to us is meagre, the inscriptions from the period the Šakkanakkū of Mari comprise the only documentation that is at our disposal. The chronology of these sources has remained uncertain for some time, and is usually attributed to the third dynasty of Ur. Thanks to the studies of J.-M. DURAND it has been possible to establish an almost certain synchrony between the various Šakkanakkū and their contemporaries in Babylonia. Lastly, the chronology spans the period from the reign of Narām-Sîn of Akkad (2254-2218) to the end of the third dynasty of Ur and the following intermediate period called the period of Isin-Larsa. The period of the Šakkanakkū, then, covers almost three historical periods (the Sargonic, Ur III and Isin-Larsa). However we have preferred not to divide the dynastic period of Mari on the basis of the periods established for Babylonia and to consider it a 'single historical period'. 3.1. Dagan in the Babylonian sources 3.1.1. Sargonic Period Generally, the Sargonic Period is understood as the time between Sargon Akkad's accession to power (2334) and the final dynasty of the Guti (2113).' The economic and administrative documentation is relatively meagre for this period (especially if we compare it with the Ur III period) and Dagan only occurs in the onomasticon. The other important source of epigraphical documentation for this period are the royal inscriptions of the kings of the Sargon dynasty. 1 Cf. D.R. FRAYNE, RIME 2 3."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"3.1.1.1. The Sargonic royal inscriptions The Sargonic royal inscriptions2 have reached us along two great routes. The first is the discovery of original inscriptions, most of them in Susa, due to their removal by the Elamites who came to sack Babylon (ΧΠ century) and who carried away a large quantity of precious objects to their capital. In spite of this sack and the irreplaceable loss of original material, the inscriptions were to remain in Babylon for over a millennium, before the Elamite pillage, already as antiques. This was to cause a whole sequence of 'research' concerning these texts. One of the results of this process of research, then, was that many inscriptions from this period were systematically copied by scribes of the Old Babylonian period.3 Thanks to this 'interest in historical philology' by the Babylonian scribes, today we have at our disposal a much larger amount of royal inscriptions from this period than we might have expected. Many of these inscriptions record campaigns carried out in various areas of the Near East. Elam and Syria were two of the principal objectives of the kings of this dynasty. The references to Dagan in these inscriptions comprise the earliest documentation that we have on the god in context and in syllabic spellings. This bilingual text (Sumerian-Akkadian) of Sargon forms part of two collections of inscriptions by the kings of Akkad made by the scribes of Nippur. One of the colophons appended by the scribes tells us that the original text was written on a statue with an uninscribed base. The other colophon tells us that the text was inscribed on a base. Bab:T 1 (...) Sargon, the king, will prostrate himself before Dagan, in Tuttul. He (Dagan) will give him the Upper Lands: Mari, Yarmuti, Ebla as far as the forest of cedars and the mountains of silver.4 2 The now classic edition of the inscriptions of the kings of Akkad was completed by H. HIRSCH (AfO 20 [1963] 1-82), in a reference work that for many years has been essential when citing these sources. With time, however, a revision of the texts published by H. HIRSCH is required, together with the publication of new textual material. In 1990, I.J. GELB and B. KlENAST and W. SOMMERFELD published all the Old Akkadian royal inscriptions of the third millennium in a single volume (FAOS 7) (cf. also B. KlENAST, GAK and the reviews D.R. FRAYNE, JAOS 112 [1992] 619f.; H.

Some scholars locate it east of Mari, in a logical path from Babylonia, up the Euphrates, between Mari and Ebla.12 But the very same 'logic' makes them attempt mistakenly to identify Tuttul, the centre of Dagan worship, with the Tuttul of Hit, on the bank of the Euphrates, east of Mari, which would the 'theoretical' entry to the 'Upper Land.'13 Thus, the location of Yarmuti between Mari and Ebla is logical but not certain. In the text BAB:T 3 Dagan is presented as surrounded by the oldest Sumero-Babylonian deities. This fact seems astonishing. However, there is a plan to globalize and cover the maximum 'territory', both geographical and 'theological'. Dagan appears in this inscription to universalize the request. All the principal deities of lower Mesopotamia are represented there, but Dagan is there 'to represent' the western regions some distance from the Babylonian 'centre'. All the deities have a specific geographic reference and in the case of Syria, which deity could best represent a sanctuary of ancient worship and recognized prestige? Only Addu of Aleppo could compete for popularity, but it seems that the kings of the Sargonic dynasty paid no attention either to the city or to the god.14 Another fact to be remembered is Dagan's position in the sequence in which the various deities are listed. Generally this sequence corresponds to fixed and well established theological canons. First of all there is Istar; it would be more normal to expect Anum or Enlil in first position, but the kings of the Sargonic dynasty have a special devotion for this goddess as the patroness of the dynasty and of the city of Akkad.15 Next come Enlil of Nippur, the great 9 Cf. the oath of the king of Nagar in Tuttul p. 21 EB:T 54 and p. 25f. above. 10 For a comparison between the kingship granted by Enlil in Nippur and the concession of the bank of the Euphrates by Dagan cf. J.N. POSTGATE, CANE 400. 11 Cf, D.O. EDZARD - G. FARBER - Ε. SOLLBERGER, RGTC 1 120. 12 Cf, D.O. EDZARD - G. FARBER - Ε. SOLLBERGER, RGTC 1 76; H. KLENGEL, Syria 3000 33. 13 Cf. Ε. SOLLBERGER - J.-R. KUPPER, IRSA 99; A. ARCHI, SLE 232; cf. the correction in Fs. Küpper 199. 14 The identification of Armānum with Aleppo (cf. D.O. EDZARD - W. FARBER - Ε. SOLLBERGER, RGTC 1 18) has been rejected by W.G. LAMBERT (MARI 6 [ 1990] 641f.) in the light of pre-Sargonic Syrian documents (Ebla and Mari). For a possible identification of Armānum with the Armi of Ebla cf. M. BONECHI, RGTC 12/1 54f. 15 Cf. Sargon's inscription RIME 2 1.1.2: 1-11 (p. 13f.) where IStar precedes Anum and Enlil: šar-ru-g i /1 u g a 1 / a-kà-dèkl /maškim-gÌ4/dinanna/1ugaI kiš / pas-ses a n/l uga 1/ka la m - makl/é ns i Iáen-líl \"Sargon, king of Akkad, the 'procura-tor' of Ištar, king of the world, the anointed of Anum, the lord of the land, the governor of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"executive god of Mesopotamia. The logical sequence would place Enki or Ninbursag next, but in our text Dagan is inserted between Enlil and NinJ)ursag,16 this situation in the 'list' corresponds to a desire to place Dagan on a par with Enlil, right from this moment, an equivalence that would become much more explicit in later periods.17 There is no other reason for placing Dagan between Enlil and one of his consorts, breaking in this way a theological canon that was to continue, with a few modifications, right to the end of the Seleucid era.18 The reference to Dagan's weapon (BAB:T 2) is not a sufficient reason for considering Dagan to be a warrior or a god of war.19 In other royal Sargonic inscriptions there are references to the weapons of several gods (Enlil, Il-aba and Nergal20), but it does not mean that they were warriors. It is difficult to extract a portrait or clear attributes of Dagan using the data from these inscriptions. The most significant fact is the clear 'regionality' of the god —he is always connected either with Tuttul or with Syria— and the identification with Enlil (BAB:T 3), which is strengthened by the parallel between the expression \"When Dagan pronounces sentence (for) Narām-Sîn (...)\" (BAB:T 2) and \"When Enlil pronounces his sentence (...).\"21 Enlil and Dagan (together with Ištar-Annunītum, patroness of the dynasty22) pronounced sentence in favour of some of the kings; they are the only ones to make this type of 'decision': Enlil, because he is the executor god, and Dagan, because he is seen from Babylonia as the Syrian god with a similar capacity to act. 3.1.1.2. Dagan in Sargonic onomastics H. WAETZOLDT23 has studied personal names with Dagan that occur in texts from the Sargonic period, without differentiating between material that comes from Mesopotamia and material from Syria.

She is a mother god-dess and Sumerian tradition places her together with An, Enlil and Enki in various god lists. Some traditions make her the consort of Enlil and others, the sister of Ninlil (cf.

Ur III period This period is marked by the large amount of epigraphic material that is available to us; all the museums with cuneiform tablets in their showcases have a high percentage of texts from this period. Most of the texts are economic and administrative in character and, unlike the preceding period, they are largely written in Sumerian. The references to Dagan in context are rare and always occur in texts that record the movement of goods (usually animals) for making offerings to deities.

Nearly all the PNN in this text are Semitic and there are even two Hurrian names.

On many occasions these animals were intended as offerings in honour of some deity. The only text that does not come from this archive is BAB:T 19, which comes from Nippur, and is also the only text in our corpus that does not record the issue of animals but records two types of flour for a ritual (s ί s k u r) to Dagan. We do not know whether the flour formed part of the same ritual or was simply a payment for the person who performed it. Two of the seventeen offering texts we have just discussed record the direct intervention of a member of the royal family (BAB:T 4; BAB:T 8; BAB:T 9; BAB:T 10; BAB:T 12). On three occasions the person responsible for the offerings is Abī-simtī, the queen mother, Amar-Sîn's widow, when the documents were drawn up (BAB:T 7; BAB:T 11; BAB:T 13; BAB:T 14 and BAB:T 16)68 BAB:T 4 records an offering of animals from the queen mother (m u n i η - š è) who, during the eighth regnal year of Amar-Sîn, may have been Abl-simtī.69 Babati, Šū-Sîn's uncle and Abī-simtī's brother,70 makes an offering to Dagan in his house, and so provides evidence for private worship by a member of the royal family. The expression lugal k u4 - r a 'the king's contribution'71 referring to an offering made by the king in person, occurs twice in our texts, and in one of them it is specified that the ceremony was performed in the palace (BAB:T 9 and BAB:T 10 s ί s k u r š à é - g a 1). This type of offering (cf. also BAB:T 1172) is repeatedly 67 PDT 2 1358 rev. 8-13: 1 g u d n i g a I udu niga s i [g5 ...1 / 1 [...1 /dda• g[an]I lgud niga 1 udu 'nig a'-[...] /1 udu niga x-[...j fiš-ba-[ra]. 68 It seems that a consensus has been reached concerning Abī-simtī and his connection with Amar-Sin and Šū-Sîn, on this cf. the bibliography given by W. SALLABERGER, KKUZ 1 61 n. 259. 69 However, this identification is tentative since the title n i η 'lady' is usual for Abl-simti in texts dating to the reign of Šū-Sîn. It is possible, then, that the title n i η applies to the queen mother. However, this means that the wife of Šu1gi (the king before Amar-Sîn), called Sulgi-simtl, ceases to be documented precisely during the last year of her husband's reign, which has led some scholars to identify Šu1gi-simtī with Abï-simtï (cf. S.T. KANG, SACT 1 267f. with bibliography). Other scholars have proposed that Šu1gi-simtī died suddenly, just after the death of her husband (P. MICHALOWSKI, Or 46 [1977] 223f.). However, on this cf. P. STEINKELLER, who accepts the hypothesis of Abï-simtï as Šū-SÎn's mother (ASJ 3 [1981] 79f.; on the whole problem cf. W. SALLABERGER, OBO 160/3 184). Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the n i η cited in this text was part of the royal family. It should be noted that there is an unpublished text (M. SIGRIST, Toronto 546) that also lists some kinds of offerings to Dagan by Abï-simtï, cf. W. SALLABERGER, KKUZ 1 107 η. 488; Η. HILGERT, JCS 46 (1994) 32 η. 8. 70 On this person cf. the bibliography in M. HILGERT, JCS 46 (1994) 36 n. 16. 71 W. SALLABERGER (KKUZ 1 30) gives a secondary interpretation of the expression and translates '(bei) Anwesenheit des Königs'; cf. also S. OH'E, ASJ 5 (1983) 122. 72 It is possible that BAB:T 6 also records a ceremony of this kind, given the special par-ticipation of the king and his consort, and the offering made to dn i η - é - g a 1; cf.

The deities who receive the offerings are also very varied, with Inanna and Nanna as the ones worshipped most.73 According to W. SALLABERGER,74 the 'rituals in the garden' (s ί s k u r s à gläk i r i6) (BAB:T 12 and BAB:T 13) possibly it was also performed in the palace and it is therefore included in the 'palace rituals'. Thus we have a palace cult of Dagan, well established in the Ur III period, chiefly during the reign of Sū-Sîn, a period in which the ceremonies of the palace and the 'garden' were concentrated as well as special devotion to Abī-simtī and his brother Babati. The text BAB:T 5 documents and erubbatum-ceremony in the temple of Dagan and Is^ara. This ceremony —literally 'the Entry'— is also attested at Ur in two documents that list sheep and goats for 'the Entry' of Annunītum and U1mašīmtum, dated years 36 and 46 of Sulgi's reign.75 According to W. SALLABERGER, the ceremony was performed when the god entered his temple after having been in the palace (possibly to perform rituals in the palace [s à é - g a 1] and garden [š à s' k i r i6]). Unlike these two texts, BAB:T 5 lists cattle (oxen) and in each of the three documents there is no fixed date for the celebration of the ritual. M. HILGERT maintains that the 'Entry' ceremony was not exclusive to the city of Ur and, as our text shows, it was not a festival restricted to Annunltum and U1mašīmtum.76 This means that the most interesting fact of this text is the explicit reference to the temple of Dagan and Isftara, as it is the first time that a temple of Dagan is recorded in an Ur III text.77 The tablet makes no geographical reference to locate this temple, but H. HILGERT, on the basis of the context of the document and especially the intervention of Igi-Enlilse in the transaction —a person is very closely linked to the city of Nippur— proposes locating the temple in this city.78 From the strictly theological point of view, this hypothesis is also plausible since Enlil is the patron god of Nippur, with whom, as we have been able to prove above, is to be identified with Dagan since the Sargonic period. The special veneration for Dagan and Išj)ara by the royal family of Ur poses the problem of the origin of his cult in the court. W. SALLABERGER suggests that the cult of Dagan came in with the marriage of Tarām-Uram, daugher of Apil-kln, king of Mari, with Sulgi while his father, Ur-Namma, was still on the throne.79 She would have carried this new cult from Syria, 73 For this type of ritual and the deities taking part in it cf.

Dagan in Syrian sources The title šakkanakkum (usually written g ì r - η ί t a) is usually translated as military governor or lieutenant124 and gives its name to a period that is poorly documented in the sources from Mari, where this city is ruled by kings who bear this title. According to a study by J.-M. DURAND, which determines the chronology of these governors of Mari and the synchrony of each with the various Mesopotamian kings, this period goes from the end of the Sargonic period (reign of Ididiš 2266-2206, a contemporary of Narām-Sîn of Akkad) to almost the close of the Ur III period (with the reign of (H)anun-Dagan 2016-2008, a contemporary of Ibbi-Sîn).

Given that this quotation comes from the last years of Sulgi, it is possible that it is the same person; cf. P. MICHALOWSKI, Fs.

The administrative texts published in ARM 19 and initially ascribed to this period have been dated to a later period by J.-M. DURAND, immediately prior to the reign of Yabdun-Līm (1815-1799).'26 Accordingly, in this section we shall only analyse the evidence from the seals and the royal inscriptions. 3.2.1. The royal inscriptions from the Sakkanakkum period Two plaques of Ištup-I1um, Sakkanakkum of Mari, consecrate the foundation of a temple to a god called Bēl(d 1 u g a 1 )-ma-tim 'Lord of the land.'127 This god was identified as Dagan by G. DOSSIN. The reasons he put forward for this identification are as follows: a) Dagan is the most important god of Mari and therefore the 'Lord of the land' (Bē1-mātim) must be Dagan just as other gods such as Aššur or Marduk who have the title 'King of the land' in Assyria and Babylonia respectively. b) The presence of some sculptures of lions in bronze in the temple of Bē1-mātim and the reference in two year names of Zimrl-Llm to the positioning and 'exit' of the lions in the gate of the 'temple' of Dagan.128 c) The presence of a temple of Dagan in ARM 19 383, together with the temples of Ninegal and Ninbursag. Most scholars accept G. DOSSIN's identification,129 but J.-M. DURAND supports his own arguments with the following proofs: a) The offering lists of the period before Yabdun-LIm make a clear distinction between Bē1-mātim and Dagan, who occur successively in the two lists.

At first, J.-M. DURAND proposed identifying Bē1-mātim with Enlil,131 but later he preferred the identification with Addu of Aleppo.132 The most relevant fact, though is that this 'Lord of the land' is not Dagan, but corresponds to an ancient Syrian epithet already documented in pre-Sargonic Man133 and Ebla ( BE KALAM-TIM) that does not necessarily have to correspond to one of the known regional deities. Possibly it is an epithet that was becoming weaker over the centuries. The later offering texts called 'pantheons' connect Dagan, Bē1-mātim and Ninbursag.134 J.-M. DURAND has proposed the identification of Ninbursag with Salas in the role of Dagan's consort.135 We shall see, later on, how this hypothesis is confirmed, so that we have a divine couple comprising Salas (Ninbursag) and Dagan following, in this way, the tradition of Ebla, where the consort of Addu of Aleppo is the goddess dija-a-ba-du,x 36 and the consort of Dagan is Ša1aš.137 We shall return to this topic in the next chapter. The only mention in context of Dagan in the royal inscriptions of the dynasty of the Sakkanakkū is the statue of Puzur-Istar (2050-2025) dedicated to Enki: MA:T3 Tura-Dagan, govern[or] of Mari, Puzur-Ištar, governor of Mari, his son, has dedicated his sta[tue] to [Enki], lord of [the assembly, for his life].

Conclusions During the Sargonic and Ur III periods the epigraphic documentation in Syria is very meagre. The texts of the kings of Akkad that record the cam-paigns to the west show that Tuttul and the temple of Dagan there to be central both as a religious sanctuary and as a symbolic place. The kings of this dynasty use the figure of Dagan to legitimise their conquests of the region, choose this god and not another (for example, Addu of Aleppo) for his special importance as a Syrian deity and the comparison they make with Enlil, the executive god of lower Mesopotamia. This comparison is not based on the similarity of their attributes so much as on their equivalent positions in both pantheons. During the Ur III period there was an important palace cult of Dagan. Very distinguished members of the royal house of Ur repeatedly worship Dagan; nevertheless, outside this aristocratic elite the cult does not seem to exist. The Babylonian theologians reinterpret the relationship between Dagan and Išfoara (two Syrian deities) based on their origin and created a link between both deities without parallels in Syria. In the texts from Syria there is only one reference to Dagan in a text from the Šakkanakkū period of Mari, in which Dagan occurs in the curse formula of a statue together with Ištar and Enki (MA:T 3). The onomasticon shows that there was a cult of Dagan at this period in Mari, especially in respect of the PNN of the Šakkanakkū of Mari. as WS; M.

It has been possible to recover several archives and the amount of epigraphic documentation at our disposal is enormous. Recently, texts have been found at Tuttul (modern Tell Bfa) corresponding to the reign of Yasma^-Addu. At present the number of documents published is not very high, but the publication of a volume devoted exclusively to the epigraphy of this site has been announced.1 Another site that has provided epigraphic material is Terqa (modern Tell al-CAšāra). Throughout the whole of the 20th century, by means of official or clandestine excavations, the amount of written material from this site has continued to increase and the publication of a volume with the new texts from Terqa has been announced.2 The chronological span, however, is very wide and runs from the beginning of the second millennium (with very few texts), concentrated to the end of the Old Babylonian period, until well into the Middle Babylonian period.3 In spite of this, the dynastic continuity, and especially, the worship of particular deities did not undergo much change. In view of this continuity, we have chosen to include in a single chapter all the documentation from Terqa. Beyond the bank of the Euphrates, other Syrian sites have provided epigraphic material from this period, cases in point being the texts from Alalab (modern Açana),4 on the bank of the Orontes, or Nagar (modern Tell Brak)5 and Šagar Bāzār,6 in the yābūr triangle, that provide little information for study of the god Dagan, contributing a small number of theophoric personal names.

This applies equally to the Babylonians and to modern scholars. The first texts were found in 1933, and from that moment between 15,000 and 20,000 tablets or tablet fragments have been unearthed,7 spanning chronologically a period between Yaggid-Līm and Zimrī-Līm.8 Most of this material comprises administrative texts, but one of the characteristics of the Mari archives is the large number of letters (more than half of all the documents) sent between various kings of Mari and their vassals or officials in neighbouring areas. These letters are of fundamental importance and relevance in the attempt to reconstruct many aspects of the history and culture of Syria from the beginning of the second millennium. However, it is certain that in many cases the most obscure part of the information concerns the city of Mari itself, since most of the affairs with which these letters deal correspond to problems of international politics or matters of the local administration of the cities that were under the control of Mari or closely connected with that city. Thus, the letters from Mari provide us with more information about the area surrounding Mari than about the capital. Since the textual material from Mari is by far the largest for this period in Syria, we shall not differentiate it from texts that come from other sites, basically Terqa and Tuttul, as they are contemporary and completely complementary. On the other hand, it would be absurd to deal in different sections with the Mari material and the texts from Terqa or Tuttul since part of the documentation found in Mari originates from these two cities (for example, the correspondence of Kibri-Dagan, governor of Terqa). We shall include all the evidence available to us without differentiating the archaeological origin of the evidence, though we do note it in quoting the various texts. It is not the purpose of this book to provide a reconstruction of the history of Syria in the second half of the second millennium; we shall simply give a short historical outline that will be used as a framework for everything relating to the cult and worship of Dagan. 9 After the period of the šakkanakkū of Mari, who ruled Mari independently, at the very least during the period of the third dynasty of Ur, there is a period when the city was abandoned for over a century. At this moment, the Amorite Sim'älite tribes arrived in the Middle Euphrates region from the upper Balîb region 7 Cf. J. MARGUERON, RAI 30 141. This material is still in the process of being published. Most of the texts are published in the series ARM, also, numerous texts have been published in an infinity of articles in various periodicals and Festschrifts; for a summary of these publications cf. H. KLENGEL, Syria 3000 p. 46f. 8 On the third millennium texts from Mari cf. above 2.2. and 3.2. 9 We shall not cite here the immense bibliography generated by study of this historical period.

This king was succeeded by Ya{)dun-Līm, who was to continue the expansionist policy of his father and, according to his own royal inscriptions, ruled the whole of the Middle Euphrates region as far as Tuttul and from there reached the Mediterranean in one of his military campaigns. Yabdun-Līm elevated Man to the capital of his kingdom and established a change in the writing system of the kingdom, moving from a system that was clearly linked to the writing norms of the third millennium to new rules that came from Ešnunna, which were used during the whole of the Old Babylonian period. At the same time, another Amorite chief, called Šamšī-Addu, inherited the throne of his brother, Aminum, as king of Ekallâtum, a city on the bank of the Tigris, very close to Aššur. After exile in Babylonia, due to the expansionist policies of Narām-Sîn of Ešnunna, he returned to Ekallâtum in about 1811. He conquered Aššur and annexed the upper Uābūr region. At this moment he came into conflict with the interests of Yabdun-Lim of Mari, who was defeated by the army of Šamšī-Addu and then assassinated in a palace conspiracy. Šamšī-Addu seized his kingdom and founded what modern scholars call 'The Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia', that covered the region of the mid-Euphrates and the upper Tigris. This period in the history of Mari is known as the eponym era, since the computation of years ceased to be made through the traditional system of year-names and moved to computation by eponym names, a system that was used only in the upper Tigris region, and in later periods was to become paradigmatic of the kingdom of Assyria. Once he had completed his conquests, Šamšī-Addu retired to Subat-Enlil, and left the kingdom in the hands of two of his sons, Isme-Dagan, who took charge of Ekallâtum, and Yasmab-Addu who set himself up in Mari and controlled the Middle Euphrates region. At this moment, Sumu-epub of Aleppo seemed to be a threat to the great kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia, and Samšī-Addu attempted to neutralise the power of Yambad by means of an alliance with Išbi-Addu of Qatna, sealed by the marriage of his daughter, Beltum, with Yasmab-Addu. After a series of armed conflicts against Yambad in the west and against Ešnunna in the east, the kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia was broken up: Šamšī-Addu died (1776) and in Mari, Yasmab-Addu disappeared. During the whole period of Šamšī-Addu's rule over the mid-Euphrates valley, the family of Yabdun-Līm, who had been king of Mari, had taken refuge in Aleppo. Taking advantage of a difficult moment in the kingdom of Šamšī-Addu, Zimri-Līm, nephew of Yabdun-Lïm regained control of Mari with the support of Yarim-LIm of Yambad. Zimrì-Līm stabilised the situation in Mari and with difficulty regained control of the Middle Euphrates region, confronting the Benjaminite 'bedouin'. Later he was to extend his control over the whole of the yābūr. However, further to the south, things were changing, Ešnunna made an attempt at recovering the kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia, but the intervention of the Elamites, with the help of Mari and Babylonia, caused the capital to fall in 1766. After a confrontation among the old allies, tJammurapi of Babylonia, once he had put the Elamites in their place,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"seized Larsa —governed by Rīm-Sîn— to the south of Babylonia, gaining the old title of 'king of Sumer and Akkad'. At this moment, tJammurapi made his objective the area of the Middle Euphrates region: in 1761 he conquered Mari and in 1759 he destroyed it completely. Finally, Babylonia controlled the banks of the two great rivers up as far as Emar and the Euphrates, and more to the north, Niniveh, also controlling the region of Ida-maras, the yābūr and the region of Elam to the east. 4.1. Rituals, festivals and liturgical acts The Old Babylonian Syrian archives in general and the archives from Mari in particular have not provided a large amount of information about the rituals and the various cultic acts of the period. Only a group of tablets from Mari correspond to what scholars call 'rituals'. These texts are no more than simple instruction manuals on the correct way to perform the liturgy and follow each step of the ritual. The detailed, step-by-step description of the ceremony and of the various acts that had to be performed are of inestimable value for reproducing the liturgy of the time and for determining the attributes and function of the various deities of a pantheon. Unfortunately, none of this group of texts describes a ritual specifically devoted to Dagan.10 In spite of this lack of evidence in the strictly ritual texts, the large quantity of written material from Mari provides several references to ritual ceremonies or liturgical acts, both in Mari and in the various districts that were in contact with the capital of the Middle Euphrates region. In spite of being indirect, these references, are very valuable for gaining an idea of the ritual and cultic profile of Dagan. 4.1.1. Dagan and the kispum ritual The kispum ritual11 was one of the most important in the cycle of festivals in Mari. In essence it was a family cult ceremony to dead ancestors. This ritual, well documented in Mari, also occurs in other regions of the Near East during the Old Bablyonian period. This seems to indicate a certain cultural 'unity' during this period in the whole of mid-Euphrates valley, the region of the Diyā1ā basin and in Babylonia.12 The ritual was celebrated twice a month, during the full moon and the new moon.13 In spite of the 'private' or family nature of the ceremony, a ritual document has been 10 Cf. the study and edition of these rituals by J.-M.

First, several ewes were sacrificed, among them, one ewe to the lamassātum17 of Sargon and Narām-Sîn, in what was called 'The hall of thrones'.18 Next, the flesh of the sacrificed animals was offered to the god Šamaš, and at this moment kispum-ritual proper began.

At this point, the text that describes the ritual is broken.

HEIMPEL - A.D. KILMER, RIA 6 447f.). M. BIROT (RAI 26 146f.) preferred to explain the lamassātum of Sargon and Narām-Sîn as the actual statues of the two kings. A. TSUKIMOTO (Kispum 74) follows the same interpretation as M. BIROT. J.-M. DURAND (MROA 2/1 287) interprets the word as the (protector-)deities of the two kings, who are not to be confused with the etemmum which is simply the spirit or ghost of a dead person. 18 On this cultic topos as the seat of dead ancestor-kings cf.

The presence of Dagan in the ritual, is unfortunately, blurred because of the broken context where it occurs. At all events, it seems clear that he is closely connected with the bumtum. Unfortunately, this tablet ritual of the kispum is not dated, but the various scholars who have studied the text agree that it belongs to the reign of Šamšī-Addu. Details in the names of the months as well as certain peculiarities of writing confirm this view.22 In two administrative documents from the palace of Mari there is a reference to the frumtum, using almost the same terms as in the text of the kispum-útuaÌ.

MA:T 6 provides no clear fact for this consignment of wine, but as the previous consignment that is recorded in the same text is dated 28/XII/ZL6', it is logical to conclude, then, that the following issue records a later operation, already in the new year, and refers to a feast for the beginning of the year.25 The fact that these documents belong to the reign of Zimri-LTm is important, since, in spite of the change of dynasty between Samšī-Addu and Zimri-LTm, it ensures the continuity of the kispum, if only in the particular aspect of the jjumtum-ceremony.26 22 Cf.

FLEMING notes the possibility that the ritual tablet of the kispum was a copy made in Mari of a ritual that actually developed in Ekallâtum or Subat-Enlil. The main reasons he gives are: the reference to the 'bedouin' Yarādum and Numt)ā, who are not connected with the region of Mari; the lack of any clear reference to the 1 u g a 1 - m e š and the ma-li-ki, well attested in the administrative texts in connection with the kispum, and the uncertain reading of Dagan at the end of line III 18 in the text.27 There are no data to prove this hypothesis, the presence of Dagan seems clear in the copy and the administrative parallels (cited above) with evidence for the entry of the ljumtum into the temple of Dagan seem to prove the presence of Dagan in the ritual; a presence that would be difficult to explain if the ceremony were celebrated in Ekallâtum or Šubat-En1i1. The absence of the 1 u g a 1 - m e š and the ma-li-ki is not certain, the text is very corrupt and there are important lacunae (almost half the obverse is missing). Finally, the presence of the 'bedouin' Yarādum and Numbā has been explained fairly well by J.M. DURAND as a reference to two kinds of 'bedouin' people.28 Evidently there are many foreign elements in this ritual, but it does not seem sufficiently clear that it has to be ascribed to Ekallâtum or Subat-Enlil. According to the dictionaries,29 basically the term bumtum refers to two things: it occurs as a month name, attested in Drēhim during the reign of Ibbi-Sîn and in the Old Babylonian period,30 and as the name of a festival dedicated to Šamaš in the late period.31 Most scholars have explained the etymology of ljumtum from the root bamātum III 'to burn'.32 J.-M. DURAND interprets the term in connection with the root fjamātum II with the meaning 'to hurry'.33 The term also occurs in an inscription of Šamšī-Addu which refers to the sacrifice in the jjumtum festival to the sun-god and the Storm-god, celebrated in Arrapba.34 In Mari it is very different. The three references known to us are connected with the king's entry into the temple of Dagan. MA:T 5 uses the verb wasûm in the Š stem, that is to say 'to cause to enter'. However, the text describing the kispum ritual uses the eponym period (cf. M. BIROT, RAI 26 147f.) and nothing suggests that in this period an ancient tradition was not followed. 27 D.E.

Note, however, that the last named scholar disassociates the ljumtum of Mari from the other texts, citing as proof that a reading with the emphatic is impossible in Mari. In spite of this conservative position, the OB Mari syllabary allows the signs DIM and UD to be read with an emphatic without any problems, cf.

Generally, this formula expresses the idea of leading a group of people, animals, or things,35 and is particularly common in Mari in connection with troops.36 The text that describes the bumtum ritual refers to sacrifices made by the king (inûma šarrum ana fyumtim inaqqû) and the prayer that the priest recites. Next the ftum/w?« is raised (ištu (jumtam ittašû), some songs are sung and then they climb onto the terrace where the sacrifice is made and the act of Upturn (consecration?) and the ikribum (blessing) between a series of songs with titles in Sumerian.37 It seems, then, that the king brought some sort of symbol (frumtum) or cultic object into the temple accompanied by a group in procession to celebrate the new year of spring. Another text explicitly connects Dagan with the funerary kispum-úlual. It is a letter sent from Terqa by Kibn-Dagan to Zimrî-Līm in which the governor demands that the king be present in the kispum-ritual for Yajjdun-Llm, the father of the ruling king: MA:T 7 To my lord say. Thus says Kibri-Dagan, your servant. Dagan and Yakrub-El are well. The city of Terqa and the district are well. The day that I sent this tablet of mine to my lord, a mubbûm of Dagan came to me and said these words to me: \"The god has sent me, hurry up (and) write to the king: he should conse-crate the kispū-rìtes to the spirit (etemmum) of Ya()dun-Līm\". Thus said this mubbûm to me and I have written to my lord. May my lord do what he pleases.38 The translations of J.R. KÜPPER and J.-M. DURAND39 interpret etemmum as a plural, i.e. 'mânes'. This interpretation contradicts the reconstruction proposed by both scholars when they transliterate the text with a clear mimation of the singular (i-te4-em-m[i-im]). The nuance is important for establising the 'actual' cult (singular) of Ya^dun-Llm that is claimed to be made or the cults ('plural') of Yabdun-Lîm's ancestors. Most scholars have understood this 'spirit' in the singular, as a cult that the king had to perform to his father.40 35 Cf. the examples in AHw s.v. pānu I 15; CAD S s.v. sabātu 8 panu a (p. 28). 36 Cf.

The pagra'um The pagrâ'um-ceremony comprises the offering of dead animals to the deity in honour of the dead. The word pagrâ'um is related to the WS root lp-g-rl and to Akk. pagrum, with the meaning of 'corpse, dead person, cadaver';41 and was used in various periods of Akkadian literature to denote the body of a dead animal.42 Pagrâ'um is a derivative form and, as yet, is only attested with this vocalisation in Mari and denotes the specific ceremony of offering corpses. Nearly all the occurrences of the term pagrā 'um known to us are connected with the god Dagan.43 One of the most outstanding and more explicit occurrences for understanding the relationship between the ceremony of the pagrâ'um and Dagan is a text written by Dām-burāsim to Zimri-Llm: MA:T 8 Another matter: may Dagan, the lord of the pagrâ'û, and Itūr-Mēr, the king of Mari, fill your hands with your enemies and your adversaries.44 Dagan is 'the lord of the pagrâ'ïC, the god who is the vehicle for the devotion of the faithful for the dead. This ritual was a ceremony of some importance. At the end of a letter from Zimrî-Līm to Asqudum, which deals with a number of diplomatic matters, the king of Mari invites the king of Qatna to attend a pagrâ'um-ceremony to Dagan: MA:T9 On the other hand, you are invited to the pagrâ'um sacrifices of Dagan and the sacrifices of Ištar.

He is accompanied by two goddesses, Salas and yebat. The former may perhaps be Dagan's consort. Hebat has been interpreted as 'the Aleppan woman', an etymology that would fit the consort of Addu, the great god of the city of Aleppo. The etymology proposed by J.-M. DURAND, 'the beloved', is also possible, without one etymology excluding the other, as this is a case of polysémie etymology that is ancient.48 All the same, we find Dagan accompanied by two goddesses by no means alien to his 'family circle', which is perfectly understandable if we remember that the ceremony was performed in Aleppo. Salas and yebat form part of the pagrâ'um ritual because of their proximity to Dagan and the city of Aleppo, the former as Dagan's consort and the latter as the sister-wife of Addu,49 the son of Dagan. Their role, then is to accompany the principal god, the 'patriarch'. The pagrâ'um ceremony was celebrated as part of a (h)idirtum, a mourning ceremony,50 but even so, the ceremony was a celebration and included a banquet that was clearly festive, in spite of the funerary nature of the act.51 This text is essential for corroborating the 'funerary' nature of the pagrâ'um which had been disputed with various arguments by several scholars,52 who saw in this ceremony a simple offering of dead animals (pagrâ'um) to the deity, without being specifically funerary. The fact that its setting is the mourning of Sumu-epub, however, vouches for the obituary nature of the ceremony.53 The god could decide when the pagrâ'um was to be performed. In a letter from Kibn-Dagan, governor of Terqa, to Zimri-LTm, there is a description of the instructions given by Dagan, through the mouth of a mufyljûm, for the performance of the ritual, specifying the day and month of its celebration: 47 A.2428: 3-6 = J.-M.

The administrative texts show that the offering of the corpse did not necessarily have to be an offering of a complete corpse, since there is evidence of the distribution of pieces of an animal60 and even of the fat of an ewe61 for the pagrā 'um. It is also interesting to note the destination of one of the pieces of a pagrä'um was the 'bedouin' (a-na 1ú-meš jja-na).62 However, the god could refuse pagrā 'um, possibly because of the bad quality of the meat offered. In this case, better meat was demanded and of better quality to carry out the ritual.

The urubātum of Dagan The urubātum-ceremony occurs three times in the published texts from the archives of Mari. One text connects the urubāturn-ceremony with the goddess Bē1et-Agade.73 In another document, Šamšī-Addu refers to the urubātum of his city (possibly Subat-Enlil), without however making any reference to any deity.74 Only one text mentions the urubātum of Dagan.

DURAND, this particular urubātum ritual was performed in Tuttul.76 We know very little about this rite. One possible etymology connects it with Akk. urubātu II with the meaning of 'lament, complaint', which only occurs outside Mari in late lexical lists that equate the term with bikītum 'lament'.77 On the basis of this etymology it may be related to the ritual with some type of ceremony around the cultic cycle of ancestors.

J.-M. DURAND suggests a possible connection based on the West Semitic context and a common etymology of the two terms with the word sürubtumß2 4.1.5. Other rituals We know that there were processional journeys of the divine statues or symbols of the gods for their respective towns, or that they were moved through the area of varying size of the territories where they were worshipped.83 The evidence for the journeys of Dagan in this period is very poor, but even so we can state that they took place. A letter from a priest, concerned about the changes in the calendar after Zimrī-Līm came to power, describes for us the most important cultic acts prescribed for the following days: MA:T 17 Ahora estamos, pues, en Urabtjum. El dieciocho el pais ha sido purificado. (...) El ventidos del dios... debe entrar [...]. El [...], la diosa Eštar saliô de Bit Mâ[)irim. El veintiocho el carro de Dagan irá a Uaddatum. Que mi Senor me escriba qué se debe hacer con él.84 In translating this text, J.-M. DURAND interprets the word yaddatum as a place-name. This term only occurs three times in the corpus of texts from Mari that have been published. An administrative text records amounts of oil for the banquet-sukultum to yaddatum.85 A similar text, published 78 J.-M. DURAND, MROA 2/1510. 79 Cf. J.-M. DURAND - M.

It is difficult to determine the etymological connection between erubbatum (DURAND erubātum) and urubātum\\ the second word, with the meaning of 'lament, complaint' does not seem to have any connection with erēbum 'to enter', from which erubbatum and šūrubtum are derived. Another possibility is to derive urubātum and erubātum from the same root as urubātu II, which is of unknown etymology (AHw 1436). As an hypothesis a possible etymology is the Semitic root f}rb 'to lay waste, devastate'. 83 On the movements of statues in Mari cf. J.-M. DURAND, MROA 2/1 305f. Cf. in general Α.

The term is ambiguous and the wording of the texts is also ambiguous, as it allows the term to be understood either as a place-name or as a ritual.

Dagan and the worship of Betyls The worship of betyls is well documented throughout Syria from the third millennium to well into the first. The evidence collected over many years by historiography are the references to the masseböt in the Bible.90 Archaeological finds and the discovery and study of texts from the Ancient Near East have continued to show that there is very much more than the negative view given by the Bible.91 The oldest written evidence for betyls in Syria comes from the lexical texts from Ebla, where the Semitic term sí-kà-na-tim occurs, equivalent to Sumerian η at-n a4.92 A. PARROT discovered what is the oldest archaeological evidence of a betyl; located in the temple of Ninni-Zaza in the pre-Sargonic period, it is a stone, one and a half metres high.93 This archaeological evidence has been confirmed by the written sources, also from Mari, from the Old Babylonian period. In these texts there are references to stones called sikkanum,94 identified as the betyls of archaeological finds. 86 Cf. D. DUPONCHEL, FM 3 (1997) 223 nr. 42: 8 (15/X/ZL 2) and n. a. 87 MARI 7 (1993) 316. 88 Cf. the chariot of Dagan (dBE) of Tuttul in Eblaite sources above EB:T 17.

The stones, that were worshipped as deities or as dwelling-places of the gods, sometimes have a specific reference to a god. MA:T 110 records the offerings of a lamb to three numina, one sacrifice to the pirikkutn of Dagan, one lamb for Dagan and one lamb for the betyl. It is not surprising to consider that the three offerings were made to the same god, even though this is not explicitly stated in respect of the betyl. This view is strengthened by the special relationship between Dagan and the betyls that occurs in other texts from Mari. The following letter refers to problems encountered in erecting a betyl of Dagan and a betyl of Addu: MA:T 19 \"(...) and the betyl of Addu that he may cause to arrive[...] the betyl of Dagan was erected and the betyl of Addu was not erected.

We do not know whether it was a real place (a dependency of the temple?) or only imaginary: Ma:t20 [...] in his dream an old man lived in the place of the betyls of Dagan, before Itūr-Mēr, to bow down and —the old man— said: \"In whom do you trust? The dead! I spoke to you but you did not listen to my words\". On hearing (this), Itūr-Mēr answered him as follows: \"Listen Dagan and Ninbursag! Today an old man will be the equal of two young men!

'nose') may be a cape or a rocky outcrop on the banks of the Euphrates from which stone could be extracted, which is very scarce in this region of the Euphrates.97 The presence of betyls in Syria goes beyond the evidence from the Mediterranean coast in the first millennium and the archaeological and written evidence from the third millennium and the first half of the second (Ebla and Mari). The sources of the middle period provide evidence of an important cult of betyls in Emar and Ekalte, where Dagan once again had a significant role.98 We do not know the use and significance of these betyls. A letter from Saggarātum stresses the importance of the presence of a betyl in the sacrifice of Ištar (nīq ša Ištar).\" It is also interesting to note the idea of the god possessing the betyl; the texts refer to the betyl 'of (sa) Dagan or Addu, but not to a betyl 'to' (ana) the deity. Accordingly, we can state that the betyls were stones 'of the god' and not simple votive objects or objects erected in his honour. The presence of these stones seems to be evidence of a certain 'aniconic' cult in Syrian religion, a facet that has its roots deep in the third millennium and later was to have one of its last refuges in the Bible and by extension in Islam.100 4.3.

Can we extrapolate from the data to determine the pantheon of Man? Or is it merely a 'partial pantheon' restricted in both time (only two months and a fragment) and space (the palace cult)? J.-M. DURAND117 attempted to resolve these questions by interpreting this group of texts as a set of offerings to the deities worshipped more by the women of the palace which would explain the large number of goddesses who receive sacrifices in these texts, and the preponderance of 'political' deities in the offerings. W.G. LAMBERT, in his study of the same corpus of texts (to which can be added the texts that were published later in ARM 23) concluded (with great prudence) that it is possible that the cult is not only of the palace but a cult of the various deities of the temples of the city by the king (and not so much exclusive to the women of the palace).118 B. LAFONT proposed a solution halfway between the religion of the palace and of the temple.119 I. NAKATA also studied this archive and queried the view of DURAND in connection with the strict relevance of the dossier to the women of the palace and also the specific and exclusive attribution of the evidence to the royal palace of Mari.120 However, the archive of Asqudum is not the only dossier recording sacrifices (nīqum) to Dagan. Two letters refer to sacrifices made to this god. MA:T 31 To my lord say, thus (says) Mukannišum, your servant. I went to offer a sacrifice to Dagan for the life of my lord.121 In this text we can see how Mukannisum offers a sacrifice 'for the life' (ana balāt bēlīya) of the king. We do not know whether this sacrifice was performed on the initiative of the official on the king's orders (Mu-kannisum) or whether the order was from his own king. Usually, however, when Mukannisum obeys an order that has been given by letter, in his reply the official refers to a previous letter from the king 'as for what my lord has written to me' (aššum...belī išpuram).122 From context, the letter seems to have been written from Tuttul, in the continuation of the letter there is a reference to the Dagan of Tuttul,123 so it is logical to suppose that the sacrifice was made in his temple.

Bring one ox and six lambs\". Meanwhile, the sacrifice of my lord arrived in the city in good condition and was sacrificed before Dagan. The land ate and all the city was very happy because of the sacrifice of my lord.124 This text is a letter sent by Lanasūm, who represented Zimri-Llm's interests in Tuttul.'25 The king commanded the sacrifice of one ox and six lambs; however, the animals were not sent from Mari, and Lanasūm had to acquire them. Once the fate of the sheep had been decided, they are no longer referred to as animals but the letter simply speaks of the 'sacrifice' (riiqum) in a generic way. Once they had been sacrificed in front of the Dagan of Tuttul, the meat was shared out among the people to be eaten (mātum iptun) in what other texts call the '(sacrificial) banquet' (naptanum). In a letter from Lanasūm to Zimri-LTm, the king's informs him of Bunuma-Addu's intention to make a sacrifice to Dagan of Tuttul: MA:T 33 Bunuma-Addu wrote to Yakbar-Lîm as follows: \"I wish to go and make a sacrifice to Dagan\".'26 Yakbar-Llm was the religious leader of Tuttul, and most probably he was the high priest of Dagan and possibly the leader of the city.127 Bunuma-Addu, king of Zalmaqum,12« requests permission from the priest of Dagan to sacrifice in the famous sanctuary of the god in Tuttul. The remainder of the letter describes how Yakbar-Līm is uncertain about the intentions of the foreign king, and asks advice from the people of Emar; they reply that if Bunuma-Addu enters with only twenty men he can make the sacrifice. This letter shows how the intention of making sacrifices in a temple, no matter how famous, was not always welcomed by the 'holy' cities, evidently because there had been cases of invasion or pillaging of villages that had received 'pilgrims', with the excuse of making an offering to the local god. The preventative measure of limiting the number of people accompanying the king seems to have been a wish to avoid this happening. '24 ARM 26/1 215: 1-14 = J.-M.

In a letter from Babdi-Līm to Zimrī-Līm, he gives instructions about when and why the king has to sacrifice to Dagan: MA:T 34 May my lord make sacrifices repeatedly before Dagan, may the god give good oracles to my lord.129 The context of this letter is quite important: four trusty men of the king (Babdi-Līm, Kibri-Dagan, Yaqqim-Addu and Yaslm-Sumu) advise him about the steps he should take during a military campaign. The text is very interesting because the king has to make sacrifices 'before Dagan' (pān Dagan) during the campaign. It was not necessary to make the sacrifices in a sanctuary or in the royal palace, it was possible to make the sacrifices outside the city, even though the sacrifices were 'before Dagan'. Thus, the deity was present outside strictly cultic places. Another text refers to the sacrifices that the king has to make to Dagan. In this case it is a literary text, the 'Epic of Zimri-LTm', an epic poem written in Akkadian. Unfortunately, there is as yet no edition of the text, but some fragments of it have been quoted in various publications. This passage corresponds to the end of the Epic, when the king triumphantly enters the temple of Dagan:130 MA:T 35 Once the king obtained his objective, he came into the presence of Nunamnir, in the Ekisiqqa offered his sacrifice, within Terqa, the beloved of Dagan. Zimrī-Līm asked Dagan for 'life, prosperity and strength'.131 In this case, there is a description of the sacrifice offered by the king to the Dagan of Terqa. Of interest is the epithet of the city, 'the beloved of Dagan' (narāmat Dagan) and the identification of Dagan with Nunamnir, one of the epithets of Enlil. We shall return to these two aspects of the text later. In this case the king requests a good future after having obtained a victory in a military campaign.132 4.4.

The other aspect of this study, however, is to see the relationship between these types of administrative texts and the possible reconstruction of the 'pantheon' within the world of Syrian religion. The sequence and repetition of the deities are data that may be useful for determining which deities were venerated most and what the relationship among them was. 4.4.1. The pantheon of the palace When G. DOSSIN published the 'Pantheon of Mari'133 he initiated a 'subgenre' within the literature from Mari that we can call the 'Pantheons of Mari'. As is evident from the start, these texts are nothing more than lists of sacrificial offerings made to the deities.134 However, these two texts are not the only two 'pantheons' in the archives of Mari. The oldest 'pantheon'135 known is the text MA:T 36/37 that is dated to an earlier period than the 'Babylonization' of Mari, that is to say, it is a document written in a script that has generally been called 'the Sakkanakkum period' script, but which in fact corresponds to the reign of Yaggid-Līm or of Yaj)dun-Līm (1820-1799).136 There is a duplicate of the same document in a 'Babylonian version', that is to say, it follows the writing rules that were adopted by the Mari scribes on the model of the Ešnunna script, which became the 'typical' model of the archives from Mari during the Old Babylonian period.137 There is another 'pantheon' in a pre-Babylonian type script, which is very much shorter. Although it follows a model very like the text described earlier. It is not our intention to analyse these 'pantheons' in detail; we will only examine how they treat Dagan in each of these texts and his relationship with the other deities that are included. 133 Cf. G. DOSSIN, Studia Mariana 4If.; text already cited, cf. above 79 MA:T 21. 134 The texts have been cited above in connection with sacrifices to Dagan; cf. above 4.3. 135 We shall continue to use the term 'pantheon' since it has become the traditional term for this type of text, reluctantly altering their original meaning; on this cf. J.-M. DURAND - M. GUICHARD, FM 3 (1997) 26 η. 40. 136 G. DOSSIN called this text'Pantheon of Ur III'(RA 61 [1967] 97f.), cf. the comments on the text by J.-M. DURAND, RA 74 (1980) 174f.

Comparative table of the 'pantheons of the palace' of Mari. First of all, we should note where this 'Pantheon of the ancient period' was composed. The fact that there is a version with script of the pre-BabyIonian type indicates that these texts were written in Suprum,141 the capital of the dynasty during the reign of Yaggid-Lîm, Zimri-Lîm's grandfather. When he transferred the capital from Suprum to Mari, there was also a change in the writing system. This explains certain peculiarities in the text, such as the very secondary presence of Itūr-Mēr, the patron god of Mari.142 In first position there are three goddesses. Ištar Dērītum, that is to say, the local form of Ištar in Der, the region from which the Sim'alites came, the region of the wells of Ballb·143 She is followed by Annunïtum, a goddess who 138 As we have said, this text comprises two manuscripts, each of them broken in different sections of the document and because the two texts complement each other it has been possible to reconstruct a composite text that, in all probability provides the complete sequence of the deities. Cf. an excellent reconstruction in J.-M. DURAND, MROA 2/1 167f., and also his partial reconstruction in MARI 4 (1985) 162f. The main differences in writing of the two manuscripts in these first nine lines are as follows: the first four lines of the 'old' pantheon are reconstructed on the basis of the text of the 'recent' pantheon. In the'old' manuscript, Bē1-mātim and Bē1-Terqa are written with the sign lugal, whereas in the 'recent' text bel- is written syllabically as be-el. The sequence Bêlet-ekallim, Nikkal of the 'old' manuscript is reversed in the 'recent' version (Nikkal, Bêlet-ekallim). Noteworthy also is the reference in the 'old' manuscript to sheep and offerings of bread to the gods at the close of the document (line 36-44; cf. G. DOSSIN, RA 61 [1967] 100), this does not appear in the 'recent' text, where there are only some vertical wedges at the beginning of each line and an indication (nr. 10) on the tenth line of the obverse. We do not know whether the vertical wedge of each line simply introduces each entry (as in school texts) or whether it refers to the offering (sheep?) recorded in the document (cf. W.G. LAMBERT, MARI 4 [1985] 529). The existence of the 'old' parallel shows that this new manuscript is a simple copy of the text. It seems that with the change in normative writing, some documents were recopied in the new format, so they give us an idea of how important this document was in the administration of the time. 139 M.

Annunītum was worshipped in Akkad as a nickname of Ištar (Ištar-Annunltum) and as patroness of the Sargon dynasty,144 It is possible that the reason for the presence of this goddess in Mari was the 'cultural' influence of the Babylonian region on the city, as shown by the change in the writing system (Esnunna) and the presence of the kings of the Sargon dynasty in the kispum-ritual.145 To summarise, the pantheon is headed by three goddesses (Ištar) one 'generic' and two 'local'. In the case of MA:T 37, the structure is very similar and the only variant is the absence of the goddess of Der. The first male god in both texts is Dagan, who is in this position as king of the 'pantheon' of the region. The first section of both 'pantheons' ends with Dagan.146 Of interest in the second is the god called Bē1-Terqa ('Lord of Terqa') one of the commonest epithets of Dagan as patron god of that city. However, it is interesting to note the conceptual continuity between the first section, ending with Dagan, and the first two deities of the second section: Bē1-mātim and Ninbursag. The second is a goddess who is very closely connected with Dagan, as we shall show below. Bē1-mātim conceals something that is much better known. As we have seen above, this deity appears already in the third millennium in the lexical texts from Ebla, written dBE KALAM-TIM.147 This 'Lord of the land' has been identified with various gods.148 If we accept the most reasonable proposal, put forward by J.-M. DURAND, beneath this epithet we have to see Addu, the Storm-god. The absence of this god from these two pantheons would be inexplicable, if we consider that he is one of the most important gods in Syria, with a famous sanctuary in Aleppo. Also, it should be noted that (after Dagan) Addu is the second most common god to occur in the proper names from Mari. Thus the identification seems clear. The position of this god in the two 'pantheons' also indicates this identifcation. The close relationship between Dagan and Addu is well known. The latter is called Bacl in the Ugaritic mythological texts, where the epithet 'son of Dagan' (bn dgn) occurs several times.149 The sequence, then, would seem to be father (Dagan) - son (Bē1-mātim-Addu) - mother (Ninbursag). J.-M. DURAND claims that the second section represents the cult in Terqa. This statement is valid for Bêl-Terqa but not for the other deities in that section.

At all events, MA:T 37 provides a clear parallel in respect of the sections of the 'pantheon(s)'. 147 Cf. above 2.1. 148 Cf. above 2.1.3. 149 POPE, WdM 255; DLU 110 s.v. bn 2b; J.-M.

If sacrifices are offered to Addu in Terqa, or if the weapons of Addu are deposited in the temple of Dagan in that city, there is nothing unusual; on the contrary, it is perfectly logical, given the father-son relationship between the two gods.151 The presence (after Ninbursag and Bêl-Terqa) of a goddess who is very closely connected with the royal palace (Bêlet-ekallim 'Lady of the palace') and of a goddess as difficult to interpret as Nikkal,152 does not strengthen the ties with Terqa. It seems more reasonable, then, to consider that in the list there is continuity between the first and second sections. After the three goddesses comes the god-king, accompanied by his son and wife. It is possible that the division of the text into sections is due not so much to strictly theological and geographical criteria as to simple administrative criteria in connection with the offerings or the cultic cycles, for the most part unknown to us. In fact, the attribution of the second section to the cult in Terqa does not stand up to a comparison with text MA:T 22, in which the local cult of Terqa is clearly represented. Text MA:T 37 follows the same model as MA:T 36 but with a more simplified structure. Noteworthy is the sequence Dagan, Bē1-mātim(-Addu), Ninbursag, Bêl-Terqa, which comprises a 'family' unit. First comes Dagan in his generic form, and the same god occurs in final position, but in his local Terqa form. The other great 'pantheon' (MA:T 21, a text from the dossier of Asqudum) belongs to a later period (the first year of Zimri-Lim's reign153) and has a particular purpose, the sacrifices for the palace cult. The final annotation to this text has been the main reason why it was considered as possibly a complete 'pantheon' of Mari: 'Total: 87 ewes sifrirti bit ilāni ('the totality of the temples of the gods'). W.G. LAMBERT has shown that this statement is not to be understood in a literal sense, since in the other administrative documents from Mari there occur many other deities not recorded in this text. He suggests translating the term sifjirtum as 'circle, circumference', with the meaning of the 'sacrificial round' that had to be made to various deities, or a succession of niches or chapels of the palace consecrated to different deities.154 At first, J.-M. DURAND suggested seeing in this text the reflex of the cult of the women of the palace of Mari, given the special importance of both the political deities and the goddesses.155 Recently, the same scholar has modified his view, interpreting this text and 150 Cf.

In spite of that, we should remember the temple that Yabdun-Llm built for Samas, commemorated in his famous foundation inscription.158 4.4.2. The pantheon of the women of the palace A series of letters written by women or ex-wives of the kings of Mari, as well as a large number of administrative documents connected with the offerings that the women of the royal harem made to the deities, provide us with a general overview of their particular cult and the identity of the most prominent deities in this context. The main source for knowedge of this particular cult comprises the lists for the distribution of oil in the eponym period: at the beginning of these lists there is an allocation of oil for various deities. The sequence that can be derived is as follows: 1. Dagan, 2. Addu, 3. Itūr-Mēr, 4. Šamaš, 5. Bêlet-ekallim, 6. Ištar, 7. Ištar Irradan, 8. tfanat.159 The hierarchy to be derived from this seems the most logical, with Dagan in first position as head of the pantheon, Addu as his son, and then Itūr-Mēr, the polyadic god of Mari, closing the section of gods. The section of the goddesses is headed by Bêlet-ekallim, as the protector goddess of the palace, Istar is the local dedication Istar Irradan160 and lastly, comes yanat.161 This sequence of deities corresponds quite closely to the 'minor pantheon' invoked by Šîbtu in a letter addressed to Zimrï-Lîm.162 Gabiatum, a maidservant of Yasmab-Addu, invokes Dagan and Šamaš to resolve the problems of the king: 156 J.-M.

It follows the sequence used in the lists from the reign of Yabdun-Līm,164 with a significant difference in the deities worshipped, particularly by the people of the north in contrast with the disappearance of the local goddess of Ekallâtum.165 Even so, most of the lists for the distribution of oil from Zimrî-Lîm's reign have the sequence Bêlet-ekallim in first position and Istar in second.166 MA:T 39 Half a litre of oil for Bêlet-ekallim, half a litre for Ištar, half a litre for Dagan. Total: one litre and a half of oil for the god.167 4.5. Dagan and Nin(jursag in the texts from Mari The occurrence of many gods in the archives from Mari with logographic writings suggested, at first, that there had been a important cult of Sumerian deities in the Mari pantheon. Gradually, it has been possible to discern many local deities behind these Sumerian forms. One of these deities, with a Sumerian form but very probably of Semitic content, is Ninhursag. The goddess as such, in the Sumerian world, is one of the most important female deities in the third millennium together with Inanna. The goddess of fertility and wild animals, etymologically, her Sumerian name means 'Lady of the mountain'.168 Recently, J.-M. DURAND has proposed that under this Sumerian form lies the goddess Ša1aš, Dagan's consort according to god lists of the late period.169 The proofs that he provides are quite weak but he seems certain 163 ARM 10 1 =J.-M.

In six texts of this corpus the goddess Ninbursag appears, and of these six texts, only one records an issue exclusively for the goddess,171 the other issues are for Ninbursag with other goddesses or with Dagan, the only male god to accompany her in any of the documents.172 The texts from the eponym period or by Zimrī-Līm provide us with a little more information about the goddess. There are several references to the temple of Ninbursag, both in letters and in economic documents. A letter from Ablmekim173 to Zimrî-Līm refers to the storehouse of the temple of Ninbursag.174 ARM 25 281 includes a transaction in silver for craftwork recorded within the temple of Ninbursag. ARM 24 172 records a possible offering of silver items to the temple of Ninbursag of Mari (sa Mari). An economic text from the reign of Zimri-LTm records a sequence of garments for various deities, including Dagan and Ninbursag. Ma:T40 One šabfjum-garment of Dagan. One of Ninbursag. One garment of Taški-Mamma. One garment of Nergal. One garment of Admu. One garment of Ištar of Nubtum. One garment of Ninkur.

The statue of the goddess in the city of Terqa also received jewels and various ornaments as recorded in the economic documents.180 At the purely administrative level there is a record of payment of grain in exchange for silver of Ninbursag.181 The largest amount of documentation on Ninbursag is connected with the offering of sacrifices to the goddess. One text refers to the 'day of the sacrifices of Ninbursag'.182 Most of the references, however, come from the administrative texts, all belonging to the archive of Asqudum and they list various numbers of animals for sacrifice.

One further text should be mentioned, cited above (MA:T 20), in which the god Itūr-Mēr exclaims: 'listen, Dagan and Ninbursag' (Dagan u Ninbursag šimê) almost as if it were a set phrase. However, the reading remains uncertain and J.-M. DURAND proposed reading Salas, Dagan's traditional consort. This position is supported by MA:T 10 which records some pagrä'um-sacrifices to Dagan, Ša1aš (written syllabically) and yebat. As we have noted above, the fact that the sacrifices were made in Aleppo explains the presence of yebat, who, according to the etymology proposed by A. ARCHI, is closely connected with that city, as she is the sister-wife of Addu of Aleppo. It is logical that Dagan, as lord of the funerary offerings, would continue to be worshipped. Salas appears, then, in her capacity as his wife. It is logical to consider reading Ša1aš for Ninbursag. Even though, in the published texts, there is no reliable proof to confirm this, all the indications point in this direction. The data from the onomasticon do not throw much light on this question. There is no proper noun that alternates between the two spellings (Ninbursag/Ša1aš)186 so it is difficult to bring conclusive data for identifying the spelling Ninbursag with the goddess Salas on the basis of the onomasticon. There are, however, other spellings that also invite her identification with Ša1aš.

Local dedications of Dagan As we said above, the texts from Mari tell us more about the world surrounding the great capital of the Middle Euphrates region than about the actual metropolis from which the documents come. The texts that refer to Dagan also reflect this distorsion. On the other hand, the particular importance of the local dedications of Dagan —especially those from Terqa and Tuttul— force us to set the information into groups and attempt to reconstruct each of the various aspects of the cult and the peculiarities of each dedication separately. In most cases, the text describes perfectly the local dedication to which it refers explicitly. In spite of this, there are some texts that do not mention a specific centre of worship, although the context (sender's name, cross references to other texts, etc.) gives a clear indication of the local epithet of Dagan in question. In this section we have included most of the texts from this period that come from direct excavation of cult centres outside Mari (especially, Terqa and Tuttul), and in spite of the scarce documentation, they represent a good supplement to the mass of texts found in Mari. 4.6.1.

The temple of Dagan in Terqa and the cult personnel The earliest reference available to us to the temple of Dagan in Terqa is in an inscription of Samšī-Addu that commemorates the construction of the temple. As we have seen above, in the third millennium there already was a god called 'Lord of Terqa', who in all likelihood is to be identified with Dagan.195 It is not unreasonable, then, to think that he already existed at that time in an important sanctuary in Terqa consecrated to Dagan. The text of Šamšī-Addu probably celebrated a restoration or extension of the temple and not a completely new construction.196 TE:T2 Šamšī-Addu, king of the totality, the one chosen by Enlil, the devotee of Dagan, the governor of Aššur, builder of the Ekisiga, 'The house of his silence', the temple of Dagan in Terqa.197 This construction or improvement of the temple by Šamšī-Addu is also recorded in one of the pseudo-year-names of the eponym period:198 MA:T 1 Year in which Šamšī-Addu defeated Mār-Addu and built the temple of Dagan.199 If the building of this temple of Dagan is the same as in the inscription that commemorates the temple of Dagan in Terqa, we may state that this work 193 D.R.

In fact, ki-si-ga means 'place of silence/calm', an interpretation that is corroborated by the 'translation-explanation' in Akkadian in the same incription (bit qūltišu).202 However, the Sumerian name for the temple was only an erudite touch, since in other texts the temple is called 'Ekisiqqa',203 a Semitic form of the Sumerian, which removed the etymological meaning of the name by writing, for example, the sign e instead of writing é, as was to be expected in the name of a temple. During the reign of Samšī-Addu the statue of Dagan of Terqa was moved to Mari to be worshipped within the palace. This did not prevent the cult from continuing as usual in Terqa.204 This move was a way of strengthening the control and loyalty of the lands recently conquered by the king of Upper Mesopotamia. Other local deities were also moved to Mari for the same 'political' reasons, as in the case of Šamaš of Manunum or Addu of Mabanum.205 The effects of the later return of the statue of Dagan of Terqa during the reign of Zimrî-Līm can be appreciated in a dream, as related by Addu-düri to the king of Mari. In the dream, she goes into the temple of Bêlet-ekallim and finds the sanctuary empty: Ma:T42 (...) Dada, the priest of Ištar of Bišrā stood in the doorway of Bêlet-ekallim and a hostile voice did not cease shouting as follows: \"Come back Dagan! Come back Dagan!\". Thus (the voice) shouted without stopping (,..).206 The letter is from the beginning of the reign of Zimrî-Līm, when the political situation was still unstable and the return of the statue of Dagan to Terqa could be interpreted as a show of weakness on the part of the new king of Mari.207 200 por the correspondence between this 'year-name' and the eponym of Aššur-Ma1ik cf.

As for the house of the previous priestess, my omens are favourable and the god has answered me 'yes'. I have started work to put this house in order and supervise the imperfections. The priestess whom my lord brought to Dagan shall live in this house.210 The priestess had to wait until a series of oracular tests had been made before being able to take up residence in her new house and be installed in her office. The oracular consulation and the whole affair in general were very important because the governor of Terqa was following the instructions of his king (Zimrí-Līm) and the governor in person dealt with the matter. 208 A.4244 = J.-M.

Not only was it an administrative procedure that had to be resolved but there was also a religious problem in selecting a suitable place where the priestess was to live.211 The case of this priestess, however, is different from the case of certain women who were destined for the 'contemplative life'. Dām-J}urāsim was Zimri-LTm's first wife until Šībtu arrived. It was thought that Dām-burāsim was relegated because she occurs in the texts in connection with religious matters and with the Dagan of Terqa. N. ZIEGLER (FM 4 452f.) and J.-M. DURAND (LAPO 18 p. 298) changed their view on this matter and it seems that Dām-{}urāsim was never relegated in Terqa. In a letter sent by Dām-(jurāsim to Zimrī-Līm, the ex-wife wishes the best in the field of battle and recommends the arrival of the king to Terqa to worship Dagan. Ma:t45 Another matter: may Dagan, the lord of Terqa, fill your hands with your enemies and your foes. Come in peace to kiss the kindly feet of Dagan, your lord.212 In another letter Däm-jjuräsim expresses favourable wishes for the king, accompanied by Dagan and Itūr-Mēr: Ma:t46 [Another matter]: may the [lord of Ter]qa [and Itūr-M]ēr, [king of Ma]ri stand at your right and at your left.213 Kunšī-mātum, Šamšī-Addu's daughter and Yasmaft-Addu's sister, was consecrated to the god Dagan as a priestess.214 This fact is explained as a political undertaking by Šamšī-Addu, after the conquest of Mari, to strengthen the ties of the royal family with the new territories conquered. A strategic location for doing this, undoubtedly, was the temple of Dagan in Terqa. This was common practice in many royal families throughout Mesopotamia, as in the case of Enfoeduanna, daughter of Sargon of Akkad consecrated to Nanna of Ur or Enninsunzi, daughter of Lipit-Ištar, enthroned as priestess by Gungunum.215 The women of royal blood who become preistesses are named with the formula d a m + DN.

Ma:t47 I pray for you before Dagan, the house that I made belongs to another: why have you made me leave your heart in this way? Entrust (the matter) to your experts and let them inspect your house. What have I taken from your house? You do not know my affairs. These are my constant prayers before Dagan: May Yasmab-Addu be well and may I prosper in his shadow.218 There is another type of priestess called qammatum consecrated to Dagan. Initially the term qammatum was interpreted as qabbātum, derived from the verb qabûm with the meaning of 'the female speaker'.219 This interpretation was also followed by the dictionaries.220 New texts from Mari have shown that the correct reading of the term is qammatum with doubling of the m. J.-M. DURAND suggests connecting the term with the verb qamāmum 'to dress hair',221 where the name for the priestesses would be based on their hair-style. A letter from Inibšina to Zimri-LTm refers explicitly to the qammatum of Dagan, in a prophetic context. MA:T48 Previously, Šē1ebum, the assinum, gave me an oracular message and I wrote it to you. Today, a qammatum-priestess of Dagan of Terqa came to me and spoke to me as follows: \"The friendship of the man from Ešnunna is treachery. Under the straw water runs and with the net with which I surround (him) I will collect him. I will destroy his city and I will destroy his property from ancient times\". 216 This name also belongs to pure Mesopotamian tradition, and we can see how Sargon of Akkad was called 'An's elder brother/brother-in-law' or Adad-apla-iddina was called 'Nanna's father-in-law' when he consecrated his daughter to Nanna of Ur, cf.

It is possible that the vision took place in a dream, in which case the priestess did not have a particular 'specialization' in prophecy.223 Later on we will be able to see how a qammatum of Dagan of Terqa counsels the king about the political situation in Esnunna and the Yaminites in a letter where the king is informed about the prophecies of Dagan in various sanctuaries. It is possible that these two texts refer to the same affair, since the context seems similar and part of the reply is identical: \"under the straw water runs\". A partial edition of the same orcular message in both texts cannot be excluded.224 The texts from Terqa mention a priest (s a n g a) of Dagan called Kinanu who occurs as witness in a contract dated in the reign of Kašti1iaš.225 Another office connected with Dagan occurs in a contract for real estate, in which a series of persons and their offices (professions) are listed: TE:T3 Field of Ill-dumqi, iggal, daughter of Idinyān igigallatu of Dagan. To I1ī-dumqi iggal, daughter of Iddinyān igigallatu of Dagan, the owner of the field, Puzurum, son of Namašu, has bought the field.226 The term igigallatu may be related to igigallūtu which means 'wisdom', the abstract form of igigallu 'wise', a term borrowed directly from Sumerian i g i - g á 1 with the meaning of 'prudent, far-sighted'.227 Thus the term is deeply Sumerian in origin and probably had a cultic connotation. There is no parallel to the south of Mesopotamia in connection with the name for a 'profession'.

The cult of the Dagan of Terqa 4.6.1.2.a. Regional centre The temple of Dagan in Terqa was also a centre of regional cult, a reference point for other cities and cult centres.230 The journeys of the deities or of their symbols were relatively common events in Syria. In a letter from Sumu-ila, servant of the king, he asks Zimrì-Līm for instructions after he had received and deposited the weapons of Addu in the temple of Dagan: MA:T49 To my lord say: thus (says) Sumu-ila, your servant. The weapons of Addu of Aleppo reached me, I shall keep them in the temple of Dagan in Terqa to do what my lord may tell me.231 The weapons of Addu went to Terqa to take part in the myth of the combat between the Storm-god and the god of the sea,232 this ritual, of which little is known, was connected with the king's coronation and his ascent to the throne. During the ceremony, the fight between the gods was re-enacted, one representing order, the other chaos. Addu granted kingship to the king during this ritual, handing to him the weapons of the king, and he was anointed with what was called the 'oil of victory' (šamnum ša namrirrūtim233), that had to be used to anoint the combatants in the man to man fight.234 The connection of this mythical dramatisation with the Ugaritic myth of the fight between Bacl and Yam is obvious. In Babylon, the reflex of this western myth is to be found in the ceremony of the New Year, during which the Enūma elis was recited, the epic poem that tells of Marduk's victory over Tiāmat, the goddess of salt water.235 The fact that this ritual, in which the king gained kingship, was performed in the temple of Dagan of Terqa, is not due to chance. Terqa was the holy city of the region and Dagan was the father of Addu, the Storm-god. It was logical to accede to kingship in the holiest city of the Mari region. Dagan, however, has a passive role in the ceremony; he is the host, the 'father', who to some extent blesses the act, receiving him and giving him approval. Nevertheless, 230 Cf. J.-M.

When Zimrī-Līm returned from his military victories he went to the temple of Dagan in Terqa to give thanks for his triumphs and give them legitimacy. The 'Epic of Zimrī-Līm' gives a full account of this, as we saw earlier.236 In this text, Dagan is given the Sumerian epithet Nunamnir, which is one of Enlil's traditional epithets in Babylon.237 It is, then, a clear comparison in the Babylonian style, on which a learned aspect has been imposed, partly by the type of text, which describes, in a tone of epic praise, the heroic deeds of the king of Mari. However, he was obliged to go and worship Dagan after having gained his victories. As we have already seen above, Dām-burāsim herself demanded that Zimrî-Līm come to the temple of Dagan of Terqa.238 The king of Mari was not the only one who had to worship Dagan; other kings of the region also had to do so and they made the pilgrimage to Terqa to prostrate themselves before the god. A letter from Kibri-Dagan, governor of Terqa, describes this situation very well: MA:T 50 Another thing: Zimriya, the king of Zurrā, the day that I sent this tablet of mine to my lord, go down to Terqa in the evening and go and bow down before Dagan.239 Zurrä was an independent city located between the south-east of Gebel Singār and the Tigris.240 These pilgrimages, however, were not exclusive to kings. The tribal chieftains also travelled as far as Terqa to worship their polyadic deity. A letter from the governor of Terqa explains this: MA:T 51 Dādī-badum me ha escrito en estos términos: 'Quiero venir a sacrificar ante Dagan'. Yo he dado a su mensajero un pretexto de esta clase: 'Los sacrifi-cios que (se ofrecen) por (gentes del) pais son numerosos. Ven dentro de très días y sacrifica por la noche'.

M.L. THOMSEN, SL §53). Note that in this text the epithet is written syllabically without the use of logograms which would give an etymology for the name.

In spite of this, the governor asks the king for instructions about the sacrifices that Dādī-badum wishes to make, since he is a Yaminite chief, whom Zimri-LTm had to confront in a military campaign.242 Another letter records the presence of Dādī-badum in Terqa, at the same time as the sacrificial offering made to Addu on the 25 day of the month.243 This shows the special devotion that the Yaminite people had for Dagan, both in the sanctuary of Terqa and in the one in Tuttul.244 Kibri-Dagan, the governor of Terqa, after attending to a series of internal matters, demands that Zimrî-Līm come to worship Dagan: MA:T 52 May my lord come in the goodness of his heart and kiss the feet of Dagan his beloved.245 Also documented (in a very broken text) is the journey of gods (probably their symbols) to the temple of Dagan in Terqa from places as far away as, for example Kafoat, in the tJābūr triangle, near Nagar.

We also have evidence of a kinūnum in connection with Bêlet-ekallim in two economic documents from Mari that record an amount of oil for the purification of the goddess during this ritual.249 It should be pointed out that an administrative text dated the 4th day of the month of kinūnum records a quantity of oil for the 'bathing' of Dagan and other deities: MA:T 55 Half a litre of oil for the 'bathing' of Dagan and Il-aba. Half a litre of oil for the 'bathing' of Mārat-i1tim. (4/vii/ZL 4').25° This 'bathing' (rummukum) ritual with oil, is probably related to the ritual of the kinūnum, or if not, with its preparations, as in the case, already mentioned, of the goddess Bêlet-ekallim. Thus, there would be a previous stage of cleansing and/or purification of the statue with the oil. The administrative archives of Mari record several consignments of oil (perfumed and not perfumed) for the gods. The particular case of 'bathing' rummukum occurs with other deities;251 mention must also be made of a record of oil for cleansing (ana mesî) the feet of the god (d i n g i r).252 Perfumed oil, as a quality product of prestige, was used chiefly by the royal family and the gods, as well as by high officials of other cities and in some cases, was used as a diplomatic gift.253 In spite of this meagre information from the texts from Mari, we do have material about the kinūnum from other periods.

The first references date to the Ur III period, where it occurs as a proper name. In the Old Babylonian period (Mari, Ešnunna and Tell Rimāh) it occurs both as a name for the seventh month of the calendar and as a ritual, and in Nuzi it is the name for the ninth month of the calendar. At the close of the first millennium it also occurs in a kinūnum-ritual in Uruk and Babylon, and in the Neo-Assyrian period it is the name for the tenth month of the calendar (kanūnu).255 4.6.1.2.c. Sacrifices to the Dagan of Terqa There are not a great many references to sacrifices to the Dagan of Terqa in the texts from Mari. The texts MA:T 23, MA:T 24, MA:T 21, MA:T 36 and MA:T 37 record various amounts and types of sacrifices to Dagan (or to the lord) of Terqa. MA:T 22 illustrates very clearly what we may call 'The Pantheon of Terqa'. The end of the tablet preserves the expression si[jirti bit ilāni, parallel to MA:T21, called the 'Pantheon of Mari'.256 According to J.-M. DURAND, this text records a ceremony in the temple of Dagan. The absence of any deities that are well attested in the cult of Terqa, for example, Itūr-Mēr, shows that the expression sijjirti bīt ilāni does not refer to all the temples but denotes the chapels of a religious complex.257 We have already seen several pages earlier how there was a cult specific to the Dagan of Terqa in the city of Mari; an example is MA:T 14, which records sheep for the Upturn of Dagan of Terqa in Mari. A text from Terqa, dated towards the end of the Old Babylonian period, records a year-name of the reign of ŠunuJ3ru-ammu, one of the kings of the local dynasty;258 this year-name commemorates a sacrifice (riiqum) to Dagan Sa ÜAR-n: ΤΕ:Τ4 Year in which Šunu5ru-ammu, the king, offered the sacrifice of Dagan ία HAR-r/.259 The key to understanding the sacrifice is the term yAR-ri, which has several interpretations: F.

ANBAR (MARI 5 [1987] 653) suggested that this document records the entry of the deities into Terqa, in parallel with ARM 23 328 and ARM 6 73 (cf. below MA:T 88). This hypothesis was formulated before the cleaning and collation of the text where the expression sifjirti bīt ilāni can now be read. 258 For the sequence of the Icings of yana mentioned cf. A.H.

GELB, who proposed the reading Dagan sa frur-ri 'Dagan of the yurrians', taking it as an epithet of Tesup.262 Later, on the basis of the identification established between Dagan and Kumarbi,263 this text was considered as referring to an epithet of Kumarbi as the 'Hurrian Dagan'.264 This reasoning has a parallel in Assur's 'classic' epithet as the 'Assyrian Enlil'.265 However, this interpretation is very uncertain. The key to the problem lies in the interpretation of the sign yAR and how it is to be read. A Middle Babylonian text from Emar records the presence of a dk u r en foa-ar-ri that we may translate as 'Dagan, lord of the hole/pit';266 the same epithet may also occur in another broken text from Emar.267 The writing fja-ar-ri in Emar shows a to be the vowel of the sign yAR in Terqa, and eliminates the hypothesis of an epithet of Kumarbi as the 'Hurrian Dagan', as the evidence from Terqa is a clear forerunner of this epithet of Dagan in Emar.268 A different question is the interpretation, once the reading in u has been discarded, of the term frar-ri. The vocalisation in a suggests identifying this word with Akkadian harrum 'water channel, irrigation ditch'.269 However, the semantic and morphological similarity with frurrum 'hole'270 makes it possible to understand the epithet, tentatively, as 'The Dagan of the pit'.271 This interpretation could find confirmation in the following line in the text Emar 6/3 384, where, after [dk u ] r en fja-[ar-ri], there occurs dinanna a-bi. As yet, the term a-bi has not been given a satisfactory translation and its meaning is much discussed. One of the interpretations that has been proposed is 'pit', based on Hurrian a-bi.272 Unfortunately, however, it is 261 Cf. H. SCHMÖKEL, Dagan 18. 262 I.-J. GELB, Hurrians and Subarians.

DURAND, are the gods who would have returned to their original places of worship after Šamšī-Addu took them to Mari after he had conquered its territories and, in this way, assured his control of those regions, cf.

It is quite possible that there was a political will in all this cultic activity beyond the city, Zimri-Llm needed to strengthen his kingdom, because when he seized power he had very limited territory. The assistance he received from Aleppo or the alliances he later made with other minor kings explain the many ex-votos the king offered to local deities. This is, then, a clear case of 'political religion', in which local devotion and tradition are mixed with external politics.288 There is no doubt that the throne of Dagan of Terqa is the most significant ex-voto recorded in writing, but it is not even remotely the only offering that the god received. A text records the acquisition of a kullānum289 for making a statue of Zimri-Llm for the Dagan of Terqa: MA:T63 X minas of bronze for a kullānum for the work on the statue of the king for Dagan of Terqa that I1ī-usranni made.290 In spite of this, sometimes it was the Dagan of Terqa who brought the material to make a bronze statue of the king that had to go to Aleppo as an offering to Addu.291 We cannot be certain whether the copper 'of Dagan' was part of the metal that belonged to the temple of Dagan of Terqa or whether, instead the copper was removed from the actual divine statue.

The governors are substituted by the various deities of the cities involved in the conflict (Dagan for Mari/Terqa, Tispak for Ešnunna and yanat for the city with the same name of which she is patron324). In this text, Yakrub-EI acts as intermediary for the words of yanat, the representative of the land directly threatened by the troops of Ešnunna (symbolised by Tispak); his role is to inform the chief god, Dagan, of what yanat said.

Yakrub-El is closely related to the city of Terqa; yanat is the local deity of Su()ûm, the region close to Mari, down the Euphrates. Dagan, then, has an executive and primordial role, even higher than Tišpak's, since he has to pronounce sentence upon him (šiptam luddin). This role of executive and principal god is emphasised by the fact that on two ocasions the text cites Dagan as the god (Hum: lin. 7 and 8) without specifying that it is Dagan.325 A legal text from Terqa, that is still unpublished, mentions a sentence pronounced by Kibri-Dagan and a judge 'of the king' (dayyān šarrim) before the gods Yakrub-El and Lāgamā1.326 The texts from Mari and Terqa show us clearly that Yakrub-El is a god worshipped only in Terqa. We cannot state, however, that Yakrub-El is the polyadic god of Terqa as this privilege is exclusive to Dagan.327 What, then, is Yakrub-El's role within Terqa and within the 'pantheon of the Middle Euphrates region' in the first half of the second millennium? The form of the name is clearly parallel to theophoric personal name, in this case formed with El ('The god blesses'). In spite of its structure as a proper name, this god also occurs in the onomasticon,328 parallel to Itūr-Mēr in Mari.329 In all probability, this is a god that occurs in Terqa in the second millennium and, like other gods with names having the structure of a personal name —Itūr-Mēr or Aštabi-E1—, is a Sim'alite god, who originated as a tribal chief deified by the members of his clan.330 The traditional greeting formula used in the correspondence of Kibri-Dagan (MA:T 77) places the two gods (Dagan and Yakrub-El) in parallel with two geographical references: the city and the 'district' (Walsum)·, this construction could indicate this 'dual' reality of the society of the Middle Euphrates region during the first half of the second millennium, since in this greeting formula, Dagan would refer to the urban city (ālum), whereas Yakrub-El would refer to the district (fjalsum), not only in the strictly administrative sense but rather as referring to the people outside the city, though under its control, those we would call, somewhat reductively, 'nomads'.

The Dagan of Terqa and political affairs Prophecies from the deity have a decisive influence on political events of the region. The Mari kings consulted the god for any important event or even receive information about the visions of certain people who could be connected with the political events of the time. One of the best known cases is the famous letter from Itūr-asdu to Zimri-Llm, informing him of the message given by Dagan of Terqa in a dream of a person called Malik-Dagan. MA:T 80 To my lord, say: Thus (says) Itūr-asdu, your servant. The day on which I sent this tablet to my lord, Malik-Dagan, the man of Šakkā, came to me and spoke to me as follows: \"In my dream, I and a man with me, from the district of Saggarātum (and as I was) in the district above, he suggested to me to go to Mari. Previously, I had entered Terqa: on entering I went into the temple of Dagan and prostrated (myself) before Dagan. While I was worshipping (him), Dagan opened his mouth and spoke as follows: 'The kings of the Yaminites and their troops are in peace with the troop of Zimri-Llm, who went up?' I (spoke) thus: 'They are not in peace'. Before my departure he spoke to me as follows: 'Why there are not constantly messengers of Zimri-Llm before me and why does he not give his full report to me? Did I? Not fill the hand of Zimri-Llm with the Yaminite kings many days ago? Now see, I have written to you. Thus shall you say to Zimri-Llm: 'Send your messengers to me and present your complete report to me to shake the kings of the Yaminites in a fisherman's basket and place them in front of you'. This is what this man saw in his dream and thus he explained (it) to me. Now, then, I have written to my lord. May my lord decide about the matter of the dream. Another matter: if my lord wishes it, may my lord present his report before Dagan and may the messengers of my lord be continually before Dagan. The man who explained this dream to me shall give a pagrum to Dagan. I did not send it and as this man is trustworthy I did not take his hair or his hem.332 331 Cf.

Dagan reproaches the king for the poor attendance of his messengers, and for the few offerings made by the king to the temple. In compensation, the god promises victory over the Yaminites and the subjection of their leaders.333 It should also be noted that Malik-Dagan is a man from Sakkā, a city within the district of Mari, and not from Saggarātum, as thought at first.334 Above we were able to see another text where Dagan intervenes in foreign political affairs, taking on the role of Mari against Tispak, god of Ešnunna.335 4.6.2. The Dagan of Tuttul Situated on modern Tell al-Blca, almost at the outlet of the BalTb into the Euphrates, Tuttul was the other great centre of the cult of Dagan. As we have already seen above, it was the main sanctuary of Dagan in the third millennium —according to the archives of Ebla— and it was where Sargon of Akkad prostrated himself before Dagan on his military campaigns in Syria.336 In the Old Babylonian period, its fame as a holy city is still present in the texts, but in this case, somewhat blurred by the importance of the Mari texts, much more 'dependent' on the holy city of Terqa than on distant Tuttul. The political and religious links with Terqa make the royal archives from Mari emphasise the importance of the cult of that city. In spite of this, the cult of the Dagan of Tuttul is well documented. The city was a Yaminite kingdom that formed an alliance with Emar and Abattum337 during the reign of Yabdun-LTm of Mari.338 During the period bi-im [Í]O zi-im-ri-li-im / ša i-le-e-em / [i]s-li-mu-ú / [u]m-ma a-na-ku-<ma> ú-ul ìs-li-mu / i-na pa-ni wa-si-ia ki-a-am iq-bé-e-em / um-ma-a-mi d u m u - m e š ši-ip-ri / sa zi-im-ri-li-im / ka-ia-ni-iš ma-al)-ri-ia a-na m[i]-nim [l]a wa-aš-bu-ma / ù te4-em-šu ga-a-m-ra-am ma-al)-ri-ia am-mi-nim / la-a i-ša-ak-ka-an / ú-ul-la-ma-an iš-tu u4-rni ma-du-tim /1uga1-meš-ni ša d u m u - m e š [ia]-m[i]-na / a-na qa-at zi-im-ri-li-im um-ta-al-li-šu-nu-ti / i-na-an-na a-li-ik áš-ta-pa-ar-ka / a-na zi-im-ri-li-im ki-a-am ta-qa-ab-bi um-ma at-ta-a-ma / d u m u -m e š ši-ip-ri-ka a-na se-ri-ia / šu-u[p-r]a-[am-m]a ù te4-em-ka ga-am-ra-am / ma-a[b-ri-i]a [š]u-ku-un-ma / ù1uga1-me í-[ni íadumu-m]eš ia-mi-na i-na %Úsú-us-sú-ul / 1 ú - š u - ρ e [š- a lu-ša-a]p-ši-il-šu-nu-ti-ma / ma-afr-ri-ka [lu-uš-ku]-un-šu-nu-ti / an-ni-tam 1 ú šu-lú] Ii-n]a šu-ut-ti-šu it-tú-ul-ma / ù a-[ia]-ši-im id-bu-ba-am / i-na-an-na a-nu-um-ma a-na se-er be-lí-ia áš-tap-ra-am / wa-ar-ka-at šu-ut-ti-<im> an-ni-tim be-lí / li-ip-ru-us / ša-ni-tam šum-ma li-ib-bi be-lí-ia / be-lí te4-em-šu ga-am-ra-am / i g i äda-gan li-iš-ku-un / ù d u m u - m e š ši-ip-ri ša be-lí-ia / a-na se-er^da-gan lu ka-ia-nu / 1 ú ša šu-ut-ta-am an-ni-tam / [iq-b]é-e-em pa-ag-ra-am a-na dda-gan / i-na-ad-di-in-ma ú-ul at-ru-da-aš-šu / ù aš-íum I ú ša-ú ták-lu ša-ra-sú ù sí-sí-<ik>-ta-šu / ú-ul él-q(. 333 Cf.

For the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"in which Šamšî-Addu ruled Upper Mesopotamia, Tuttul was under the control of Yasmab-Addu, who had two large districts in his power: Mari and Tuttul.339 During the reign of Zimri-Llm, the situation does not seem to have changed much, even though the control of Tuttul from Mari became more difficult. The fact that it lay on the western border of the kingdom made control of the region difficult, especially at the beginning of Zimrî-Lîm's reign, when the situation in Mari was much less stable. A votive inscription of Yasmab-Addu was dedicated to Dagan of Tuttul. Unfortunately, the tablet is very damaged and we can only read the beginning of the text: MA:T 81 To Mullil, who listens to prayers, who dwells in Tuttul, Yasmab-Addu, son of Šamšī-Addu, when on the bank of the Euphrates [...].·340 Mullil is the name of Enlil in Emesal,341 in this case written syllabically. This is a 'cult' name of Dagan, due to his equivalence with Enlil. We are tempted to connect this 'learned' name of a Babylonian type for Dagan of Tuttul with Samsï-Addu's 'Akkadian' origins;342 however the epithet Nunamnir that the Dagan of Terqa is given in the Epic of Zimrī-Līm advises against this interpretation.343 Even so, this is a name that came from the south and was adopted by the Mari scribes. It is possible that the inscription commemorates one of Yasmab-Addu's victories in the region of Tuttul, on the western Euphrates.344 A letter from Lâ'ûm to Yasmab-Addu records the departure from Tuttul of the 'vessels of Dagan'. These boats formed part of the administration of the temple of Dagan in Tuttul; however, we do not know the reasons for the journey or the destination of the vessels: MA:T 82 To my lord say, thus (says) Lâ'ûm, your servant. As for the earlier boats of Dagan, I have written to my lord. The servants of my lord are informed and these boats have already left. But I have detained them all in Tuttul.

The presence of Šamšī-Addu in Tuttul is also documented in other administrative texts of the city that record quantities of food for the king's meals.347 Other texts from Tuttul record the presence of experts in extispicy from the temple of Dagan in this location.348 The other references to the Dagan of Tuttul correspond to Zimrî-Lîm's reign. In the same way that in Terqa, the Dagan of Tuttul also had a role in prophecy, there are several instances of the instructions that this god gave and that the king's trusty men sent to Mari. The first text in chronological order belongs to the second phase of the prophecies of Zimrî-Lîm's reign, at the time of his confrontations with the Benjaminites and with Ešnunna:349 Ma:T 83 To my lord say, thus (says) Sammētar, your servant. Lupābum, the āpilum of Dagan, has arrived from Tuttul. He brought a message that my lord was asking about him in Saggarātum: \"Do the (oracular) counterproof (lit. examine me) regarding me before Dagan of Terqa\". He answered him as follows: \"Wherever you go you always receive happiness. A battering-ram and a war-tower are given to you. They will go at your side (lit. 'sides'). They will go to help you\". This (same) message they replied to him in Tuttul and from his arrival in Tuttul will make him go down to Dēr. He brought my lock to Dēritum. Before, he had brought the šernum (saying): \"The šernum is not trustworthy, the waters (have) wet (it), strengthen the sernum\". Now he has brought my lock and this is the message: \"I fear (oh Dērītum!) that you trust in peace with the man from Ešnunna and that you will be idle. Your guard must be stronger than before\". And to me thus he said: \"I fear (lit. perhaps) that the king will make a treaty with the man of Ešnunna, without (asking) the god\".

This is the message that Lupābum spoke to me. Afterwards, the next day, a qammatum of Dagan of Terqa came and thus said to me: \"Under the straw water runs. They do not cease writing to you to make peace, their gods send you, however in their hearts they are preparing a second betrayal. The king must not make any pact without consulting the god.\" She asked for a lafjarum-garment of ordinary material and a nose needle.

Lupābum, an āpilum35i of Dagan of Terqa or of Saggarātum, is sent to Terqa to confirm a prophecy inspired by the Dagan of Tuttul.352 The god's reply in Terqa seems to agree with the reply given earlier in Tuttul and in both cases is favourable to the interests of the king of Mari. Once the consultation in Terqa was complete, Lupābum went to Der, under guard on the order of the governor of Terqa, to visit Dērītum carrying an object that symbolised the matter on wich he attempted to obtain an oracle.

The expression 'entry of Dagan' (erēb Dagan) describes the entry of the divine image into the temple after a journey or a pilgrimage celebrated in honour of a god, in which the god, represented by his statue, was the main object of worship. The moving of gods is relatively common in the archives from Mari. The journey of the Lady of Nagar through the region of Apum, with its capital in Subat-Enlil, is well documented.359 We have already seen above, when discussing the Dagan of Terqa, the journey made by Addus' weapons as far as Terqa. Also documented is the moving of gods such as Lāgamā1 or Iksudum.360 In the case of Dagan, we have already seen an entry ceremony (erubbatum) during the Ur III period in honour of Dagan and Išbara.361 The following text is a letter from Lānasūm that describes the entry of Dagan of Tuttul into Emar. The area of influence of the Dagan of Tuttul is more restricted in the western region of the mid-Euphrates, and there is no text that records a journey with the same characteristics of Dagan of Tuttul in Mari, in contrast with the intense relationship there was between Mari and Terqa. However, we do not have to set the two cults of Dagan against each other; the two are complementary and simply cover different geographical areas. The complementary nature of the two cults is apparent from MA:T 83, which shows how an oracle from Tuttul is ratified in Terqa:362 MA:T 87 The people of the city went to Emar because of the sirqātum of silver that had been given for the meals of the entry of Dagan.363 The relationship between Emar and Tuttul, in this case, is parallel to the one between Mari and Terqa.

After sixteen days, Dagan entered Tuttul and I sent this tablet of mine to my lord.367 In speaking about the sacrifices to Dagan we have already mentioned the evidence we have of sacrifices in Tuttul: MA:T 33 describes how Bunuma-Addu, king of Zalmaqum requests permission from Yakbar-Līm to make a sacrifice to Dagan of Tuttul in the same way that Zimrī-Līm orders a sacrifice to Tuttul and Lanasūm informs the king how the sacrifice and the following banquet went.368 He have already seen how Yakbar-Līm was the high priest of Dagan in Tuttul and possibly also the local head of the city. His predecessor in this office was Yašūb-Dagan, who has the same attributes as Yakbar-LTm.369 A letter sent by LanasOm, Zimrî-Lîm's representative in Tuttul, explains to the king the uneasiness among the people of Tuttul due to the presence of a bassânum, the title given to the representative of the king (of Mari) in a territory that was under his protection.370 In the case of Tuttul, the bassânum was Lanasūm. This unease of the people of Tuttul was such as to affect the running of the religious life of the city. 364 On the structure in 'pairs of cities' cf. D. CHARPIN, J.-M.

The text is a very good description of the close relationship that existed between Tuttul and Emar, and the rebel stance held by the 'traditional' chief of the city. It is interesting to see, in this connection, how in Tuttul there seems to have been a strong link between the temporal and religious powers, since both aspects were concentrated in the same person.372 It is possible that the clergy of Tuttul and the temple of Dagan, as an institution, were a strong redoubt against an external power that was attempting to dominate and make a vassal of the city through LanasQm, the Ìjassânum of the king of Mari. In this case, the Dagan of Tuttul represented the city as opposed to submission to Zimrī-Līm. If the relationship between the Dagan of Terqa and the royal house of Mari was very close and cordial, the Dagan of Tuttul was erected as a symbol of resistance. These difficult relations between the local chiefs and the Mari administration are well documented in the text just quoted and also in the problems LanasQm had in collecting Yakbar-Llm's tribute,373 and the particularly difficult relations that were maintained between them.374 In some cases it was difficult to keep control over the people and a letter from LanasQm to Zimri-LTm explains how the people of Tuttul ripped out the doors of the temple of Dagan.

Nor do we know who preceded or followed him, but whether or not the name Yašūb-Dagan is suitable for a high priest of Dagan, the name Yakbar-Lïm seems to be a 'concession' towards the dynasty of Mari, called the dynasty of 'Līm'.

Perhaps the doors were an offering from the king of Mari, or perhaps the king wished to take them away.377 A broken text describes the effects of torrential rain with rockfalls and damage to crops. In two lines of the text, a bubrum-sacrifice of Dagan of Tuttul is mentioned, but unfortunately the tablet breaks off at this point and we cannot know what its function was; there is a parallel in the bujjratum-sacrifice of Addu:378 MA:T91 [...] the bufjrum-(sacrifice) of Dagan in Tuttul, Iddi, the man [...].379 4.6.3. The Dagan of Mari Even though most of the written material from this period referring to Dagan comes from the royal archives of Mari, we have very few references to the local dedication of Dagan in the capital of the Middle Euphrates region. It is a commonly known fact that the archives from Mari provide more information about the area surrounding Mari than about the capital itself, which is logical if we remember that most of the texts available to us are letters sent by subjects and servants of the various kings of Mari from outside the capital.

The generic references to the 'temple of Dagan' are difficult to locate with precision. It is reasonable to think that in many cases these are references to the temple of Mari since, being administrative texts written in Mari, there was no need to give the exact geographical location for the temple. This principle applies in many cases, but in others, when persons intervene who are clearly involved in the affairs of another local Dagan (generally of Terqa or Tuttul), it is better to situate the texts with references to other local 'Dagans' outside Mari. We have tried, therefore, to determine, as far as we can, whether each document that refers generically to the temple of Dagan could be part of the affairs of a temple of Dagan outside Mari, and if not we have to ascribe this reference to the temple of Mari. The pre-eponym texts (the so-called sakkanakkum texts) record the temple of Dagan several times, but in no case do we have a definite geographical reference to determine where the temple was located (Mari or Terqa). Whichever the recipient temple was, the texts do not indicate any cultic use of the animals and so these records must belong to the administrative requirements of the temple and of its personnel.381 An undated text, probably from the reign of Zimrî-Līm, records the payment of various amounts of silver and food to various recipients, among them the temple of Dagan: MA:T 92 Half a shekel for the purchase of one ewe, half a shekel for bread and beer for the temple of Dagan.382 Another document, one of the memoranda called aššum, records the issue of silver for (the temple) of Dagan: MA:T 93 One shekel and a quarter from (the temple o)f Dagan.383 As for the temple personnel, there is a delivery of animals for the work of the diviners of the temple of Dagan.384 In connection with the correspondence, two letters inform us of the problems there had been with the doors of the temple of Dagan.

The only cultic topos that we know is called the pirikkum of Dagan. The pirikkum is an ambiguous term and could be interpreted, on a first reading of the texts, as a ritual, but it is very likely that it is connected with a cultic topos. The term occurs only once in connection with Dagan in the texts from Mari. ARM 23 284 records a series of sheep sacrificed in the pirikkum of Dagan and in the betyl (sikkānum). Ma:T 110 Five lambs for the sacrifice in the pirikkum of Dagan. One ewe in the betyl. One lamb to Dagan. Total: seven dead lambs in Mari. (6/xi/).409 The meaning of this cultic term is difficult to determine. At first, J.-M. DURAND proposed that the term denoted a place, a feast or an object,410 without attempting to translate the word.411 In his review of the administrative texts from Mari, W. VON SODEN, suggested a connection with Akk. parakkum 'sanctuary'412 The appearance of texts from the intermediate period of Emar have provided new occurrences of the word. D. ARNAUD does not attempt any translation; R. ZADOK connects the term with WS *brk 'pool'.413 On the basis of these new texts, J.-M. DURAND continued to propose connecting the term with a place or with a sacred symbol of Syrian temples 414 D.E. FLEMING related the term to Istar (sa) bi-ri-GA-ti of Emar,415 which J. OLIVA suggested connecting, through pirikkum with Akk. pilakkum 'stiletto'.416 Lastly, D. CHARPIN and J.-M. DURAND, explain the term as a structure where libations were made to the god.417 Apart from the connection between Dagan and the pirikkum, the term occurs in Mari in association with two other deities: Sîn and yibirtum, both 408 ARM 22 100: 30 m a - n a s ί g u š / si g - b a n i n dda-gan / ζ i - g a / mû-sur-a-wa-sú (13/?/YA 15). 409 ARM 23 284 = B.

DURAND proposed the derived meaning of 'to consecrate a priestess', but always retaining the original meaning of (cultic) place.421 Accordingly, the pirikkum would be, among other things, the place where priestesses were consecrated. The texts from Emar also seem to indicate that the pirikkum was a cultic place where sheep were sacrificed to the Storm-god: 'One ewe to the garden of the pirikkum of dIM' 422 J.-M. DURAND proposed a new reading of Emar 6/3 28: 5-6 'Before they confront each other in the pirikkum' 423 in this case the term would be used in a legal context, it is possible that the pirikkum was a place where an oath to the deity was sworn. However, a literary text from the Old Babylonian period also includes this term: 'Their homes were heaped with grain, their pirikkū with...', where the word pirikkum occurs in clear parallelism with šubtum 'dwelling'.424 Another literary text from the same period describes, among other things, the king's desire to build a temple in honour of Erra. In the first line of direct speech, the king refers to the pirikkum (in a broken context) when listing the various works he is thinking of doing for the deity. In this text the pirikkum is also clearly in parallel with other temples or rooms and (cultic) chambers of the sanctuary.425 We may conclude that Dagan received sacrifices of animals in the pirikkum,426 a cultic chamber where, at least conceptually, the element of water was predominant for making libations and consecrating (certain) 418 ARM 21 34 1-3: 3 u d u - n i t a - b i - a / i-na pí-ri-k[i)m ša %i-bi-ir-tinv, ARM 23 290: 5-6 = MARI 5 (1987) 388 (copy): 2 s i 1 a4 i-na pí-ri-ki-im / ša dEN-ZU. 419 Text which describes a request to the god Itūr-Mēr, for omens for a sick child once the god has appeared: \"J'ai fait déposer à Abattum le pirikkum d'Itūr-Mēr et le petit enfant a offert un sacrifice.(...)\" Cf.

The cult of Dagan of Mari There is good evidence for sacrifices to Dagan and other deities that were performed in Mari. There are cases in which it is difficult to know whether the sacrifice was in the same city or simply a record of animals that have left Mari for other places where the sacrifices were made, or whether the animals were intended for the local cult of Dagan.428 As for the cultic ceremonies, we have to note royal intervention in the jjumtum-ritual which, according to the ritual tablet of the kispum, was performed to introduce the fyumtum, some kind of standard or divine symbol, together with an accompanying procession inside the temple of Dagan 429 4.6.4. The Dagan of Subātum Besides the two great sanctuaries of Dagan located in Terqa and Tuttul, and of Dagan of Mari, there are references to other cities that document a temple dedicated to Dagan. However, the references are very scarce due to the lesser importance of these other cult centres. One of these sanctuaries was in Subātum, located on the left bank of the Euphrates in the vicinity of Mari.430 The sources do not provide much information on the cult in the sanctuary of Dagan in that city; most of the quotations come from the administrative texts, except for a letter from Zimrī-Līm to his mother Addu-dūrī.43i Ma:t 112 I have listened to the tablet that you sent me, (you gave me) news about the woman whom Dagan reclaims.

The Dagan of Hakkulān The city of yakku1ān is mentioned in seven texts from Mari,455 and all the references are in connection with the journey that Zimrī-Līm made to Ugarit. Of the seven texts, five refer to the temple of Dagan. It has been possible to reconstruct this journey of the king of Mari on the basis of about eighty economic texts that record the expenses of journey for each day, in each place through which the king and his retinue passed. In spite of the meagreness and laconic nature of these texts, in some cases we can even reconstruct some of the actions carried out by the king at each stage. The route that Zimri-Llm followed brought him first of all to Terqa and then he went up to the yābūr as far as the upper region of the river; from there the retinue turned west to reach the mid-section of the Ballb, going downstream as far as Tuttul to meet the Euphrates again and continue going up the great river. A few days after passing through Tuttul, the caravan reached yakku1ān, where the king of Mari had a meeting with Yarlm-LIm, king of Yambad, and his wife Gašera.456 Ma:T 128 One g u r in e jewel of gold encrusted with lapis-lazuli with a weight of one mina of gold —except the lapis-lazuli—; two rings with a weight of one third of a shekel of extruded gold for Yarim-Lïm, king of Yambad, to the temple of Dagan of Hakkulan, during the summit.

Later, however this site was identified with the city of the middle period of Ekalte called Yakaltum or Eka11ātum in the texts from Mari, cf. W. YUHONG, NABU 1992/51; D. CHARPIN, NABU 1993/32; P.

There is, then, a political background to both religious ceremonies. It is quite possible that Yarim-Llm's entry into the temple of Dagan of yakkulân also entailed some kind of purification ceremony by the king of Aleppo; however, it has not been possible to confirm this from the royal archives of Yambad that one day, perhaps, it will be someone's privilege to discover. 4.6.7. The Dagan of Saggarātum There is no explicit reference to the Dagan of Saggarātum in the texts from Mari published so far. In spite of this, a letter from Yaqqim-Addu, governor of Saggarātum, addressed to Zimrì-Līm, describes the structural problems of the temple of Dagan there: MA:T 131 To my lord say, thus (says) Yaqqim-Addu, your servant. The day that this tablet of mine was sent to my lord the supporting wall (that is) in front of the temple of Dagan, collapsed, one suppum (in length -about 30 metres), that had never suffered any tremor.464 This suggests that this temple was very close to the river, which would explain the problems caused by the rising flow of water over the structures of the sanctuary. J.-M. DURAND also cites similar kinds of problems with the temple of Dagan of Saggarātum during the eponym period.465 On the other hand, note also the existence of an āpilum of Dagan called Lupābum, although we are not certain whether he practised in Terqa or in Saggarātum.466 4.6.8. The Dagan of Zarri-amnān Only one reference proves the existence of a local Dagan in Zarri-amnän.

The most common usage was to make a seal impression and ensure the completion of a deal. This deal could be made in a private context, as a simple contract of sale and purchase between two individuals, or in a great diplomatic pact between nations. In either of these contexts, where we find an oath, the gods feature as a reference point for both parties, and for this reason, the gods had to be represented by the two parties who signed the agreement and swore an oath. At all events, the oath had to be made in the temple of the god or in front of his symbol, which caused problems in moving several people who were some way from the great sanctuaries; in such cases, one could swear by the local gods or even await the arrival of an expedition that carried the divine symbol.476 One of the gods who customarily presided over oaths in the texts from Mari is Itūr-Mēr, who went with the king to bear witness in resolving disputes.477 The importance of the role of the gods in an oath is evident from the name given to the oath: nīš ilim or ilāni, literally, 'by the life of the god/s'. The oldest evidence we have of the presence of Dagan is a contract for the sale of slave that includes the oath formula, to avoid reclamations: MA:T 134 He had sworn by Dagan, Šamšī-Addu and Yasmab-Addu.478 This is the almost fossilised formula that was to persist in Syria until the end of the Middle Babylonian period. The only variations, dependent on period and place, were the gods and, of course, the name of the king. In a legal document there is a good description of an oath with royal intervention. The action takes place in Saplratum, about 130 kilometres from Mari, down the Euphrates, and very close to yanat.479 A person called Pulsl-Addu and his clan claim the right to a field that belongs to the palace. After a meeting in Saplratum, Zimrī-Līm gives a verdict in the temple of yanat. 37 persons confirm and swear in the temple of Itūr-Mēr that the field is royal property. After he has determined the borders of the field and punished whoever claimed the king's field, there comes the oath formula together with a clause about eating (something). MA:T 135 He 'has eaten' the oath by Dagan, Itūr-Mēr, Hanat and Zimri-Llm.480 476 Cf. J.-M. DURAND, Méditerranées 10-11 (1997) 64. 477 Cf. J.-M.

Even though it was a local afair in a town far from Mari, with an important local god, Dagan is present in the oath because it also features the king and because he is the chief god of the dynasty. In spite of this, the pairing of Dagan and yanat is not unique to this text. A letter from Buqāqum, an official of Zimri-Llm in the region of yanat, when sending a letter to a colleague, uses the formula 'Dagan and yanat are well',481 and in this case the roles of the deities are clear: Dagan is the supreme god of the the Middle Euphrates region and yanat is the local deity. A letter from Kibri-Dagan, governor of Terqa, addressed to Zimrī-Līm, shows how the king demanded control of the region of Terqa by his subordinate. Kibri-Dagan answers as follows: MA:T 136 Meanwhile, in Zurubbān, yišamta, Himmarān and Hanna, I have assigned a reliable man in each city and have made them swear by Dagan, Itūr-Mēr and my lord.482 The four cities he mentions lie in the neighbourhood of Terqa and are under its control. The governor of Terqa makes the people entrusted (ebbûm) with the royal task swear loyalty by the chief god of the pantheon and the patron of Terqa, by the god responsible for oaths and polyadic god of Mari and by the king.483 However, subordinates are not always the ones who have to swear an oath; sometimes it is the king himself who has to make a pledge before the gods. A letter from Zimrī-Līm to Nâ'imum, a Yaminite chief, throws light on the oath that Zimrî-Līm made in the temple of Dagan of Terqa by the wish of Nâ'imum: Ma:t 137 Naguère, Ilî-nê'im est venu me faire tuer l'ânon. Dans un second temps, Yâzi est venu me dire: 'Prête serment par le dieu dans le temple of Dagan!'. Yâzi m'ayant tenu ce discours, je t'ai envoyé une lettre pour te demander: 'Yâzi est venu me dire: \"Prête serment par le dieu dans le temple of Dagan\". Dois-je (vraiment) le prêter de cette façon?'

Je n'ai rien refusé de ce que tu as réclamé, je n'y ai mis nul obstacle!484 In this text, the Yaminite sheikh, through his messengers, orders Zimrī-Līm to make an oath in the temple of Dagan. The king of Mari accedes to this request; however to some extent he shows surprise at the act requested of him and stresses that no other king had done it before. In Mari, it was most common to swear an oath by Itūr-Mēr, since he was the god responsible for such matters. The special devotion of Nâ'imum, as a good Yaminite, for Dagan explains the exceptional nature of the request. After sacrificing a donkey, the oath by Dagan in Terqa, would be the guarantee necessary for a Yaminite.485 After the destruction of Mari by Uammurapi of Babylon, the hegemony of the Middle Euphrates region moved to the city of Terqa. The contracts found in that city, after the fall of Mari, include a penalty clause against anyone making a claim after the oath sealing the agreement. The witnesses of the oath are three major gods and the king who was on the throne when the contract was drawn up. The structure of the oath is as follows: TE:T 5 He who claims, because he consumed an oath by Šamaš, Dagan, Itūr-Mēr and PN, the king, shall pay x minas of silver to the palace.486 The three main gods of the oath are the most logical in this context. First comes Šamaš, as god of justice, the principal guarantor of the oath. In this 484 A.2078 = ARM 26/3= J.-M. DURAND, Méditerranées 10-11 (1997) 63f. Only the translation of the text has been published; the complete edition is to appear in ARM 26/3. The ceremony of 'sacrificing a donkey' (ana bârim qatālum) symbolised not only the 'political' alliance between two leaders but also a 'family' union, the 'consanguinity' between the two parties, signified by the spilling of blood (cf. J.-M. DURAND, RAI 38 120; J.-M. DURAND - M. GUICHARD, FM 3 [1997] 49). This consanguinity could also be acquired by an incision and the union of the two wounds in a symbolic 'exchange' of blood, cf.

In the oath, the person involved took food or drink that could be transformed into a destructive force if any part of the oath was not fulfilled.

It is he who bestows kingship and is the principal local god of Terqa. Itūr-Mēr represents the god who is a link with the tradition of Mari, now destroyed, and often appears in oath formulae, but has a 'nomadic' background, evident in the same divine name that has the structure of a personal name, being (like Yakrub-El or Astabi-El) a deified tribal ancestor.487 Dagan represents the regional and local god (Terqa) at the same time, and Itūr-Mēr the god of the city of Mari of the 'kingdom' of Mari, even though it no longer existed. In this way the dual nature of the country on the banks of the Euphrates is represented, even after the destruction of Mari, already well into the Middle Babylonian period, in the '\"bedouin\" (,bana) 'Kingdom' of Terqa. This system of ensuring the fulfilment of an oath is also documented earlier, in Mari. In a letter from the eponym period, there is a reference to an unfulfilled oath and the threat it entailed of having 'contravened the sacred command' (assakum).488 Of particular interest is the parallel made in the text between two divine couples and two kings: MA:T 138 The general, the Amorite scribe, the captain (or) the lieutenant who decreases the soldier's booty will have eaten the asakkum of Dagan and Itūr-Mēr; the asakkum of Šamšī-Addu and of Yasmab-Addu.489 The parallel between the gods and the kings is clear enough: Dagan or Samšī-Addu as leaders and Itūr-Mēr and Yasmab-Addu in their local role in Mari.490 4.8. Dagan and communication with worshippers Communication between god and humans has always been one of the most controversial and interesting aspects of study of religion in general. The case of the religions of the Ancient Near East and of Syria in particular in the first half of the second millennium are no exception. Fortunately, the relevant documentation is significant enough for us to be able to reconstruct, with a minimum of verisimilitude, the methods and objectives that the gods had in making contact with their subjects and so indicating the correct path at a difficult time or simply to manifest the more or less 'capricious' desires of the divine will. The techniques and methods for making contact with the gods were extremely varied and it is not the intention of this book to make an in-depth 487 Cf. J.-M.

Also, we are interested in what techniques were used both by humans and by the god to find a 'common language' to be able to interact. 4.8.1. The prophetic message One of the methods for a god to communicate with humans that was used most, and also the most famous, was by means of a prophetic message. This message was transmitted through a person who was, to some extent, 'chosen' to act as the loudspeaker of the divine message among humans. This 'prophetic message' and this person, 'touched' in some way by the god, also has a high profile in texts from Mari from the Old Babylonian period. Of course, modern historiography has created a whole set of links and relationships or greater or lesser intensity with biblical prophecy, which is so much part of our culture.492 Basically, there are two classes of prophet in Mari: the āpilum (variant āplum, feminine āpiltum) and the mujjljûm (feminine mufjijutum). The āpilum is a 'technician', able to come into contact with the designs of a god. He could be a simple communicator of the divine will on the initiative of god or man. That is to say, it could either be the god who 'finds' him and makes him share his message, or else men who ask him to find out what the divine will is. This message was always received in public, on many occasions during a sacrifice or cultic act. Suddenly, the āpilum stood up and gave his message.493 According to the etymology that has been proposed until now, the āpilum was an 'answerer',494 a person acting as the god's spokesman. Recently a new etymology has been suggested that, to some extent, gives us a more specific and nuanced idea of the āpilum but without making substantial changes. G. PETTINATO495 has noted the presence of the word āpilum and other derivatives of the Semitic root 'pi in 491 Here we will not cite the vast bibliography on divination techniques in Mesopotamia. For an introductory text on extispicy cf. I. STARR, The Rituals of the Diviner, Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 12, Malibu 1983, especially the introduction with an extensive bibliography; cf. also the more recent works U. KOCH-WESTENHOLZ, Mesopotamian Astrology. An Introduction to Babylonian and Assyrian Celestial Divination, CNI Publications 19, Copenhagen 1995; E. REINER, Astral Magic in Babylonia, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 85/4, Philadelphia 1995. 492 On these connections between prophetism in Mari and in the Bible cf. A. LEMAIRE, MARI 4 (1985) 553f. with an extensive bibliography. 493 J.-M. DURAND, ARM 26/1 398; MROA 2/1 324; LAPO 18 p. 77. 494 Akkadian apālum 'to answer'; on all this cf. J.-M. DURAND, ARM 26/1 p. 386; MROA 2/1 322f.; D. CHARPIN, BCSMS 23 (1992) 21. In this connection there is an interesting dichotomy established by some scholars who differentiate between the priest who represents the witness and the prophet who represents the answer (L. DUCH, Antropologia de la religio, Montserrat 1997 152f.). However, it is difficult to apply this scholar's view to the data from Mari since DUCH's concept of prophecy is very much influenced by biblical tradition in his definition of a prophet as someone (a revolutionary) who tries to change the official religious system on the basis of a 'revealed' message. 495 RSO 70 (1996) 6f.; cf. also W.G. LAMBERT, MARI 5 (1987) 409."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"the bilingual vocabulary from Ebla with the Sumerian translation e m e -b a 1 a, a term that essentially means 'translator, interpreter'. In this case the āpilum would be the person who has the gift of making the divine will understood, changing the code to make it intelligible to humans. The case of the mu/jfjum is different: whereas the āpilum was an expert specialising in prophecy, the muijhûm was a person who in some way had been 'touched' by the hand of god and who, in an unpredictable way and anywhere at all, received a divine message on entering a trance. After the crisis, the mufafrûm (or the mubbûtum) went to spread the message to the authorities. The term mufjljûm comes from Akkadian maljûm 'to be in a frenzy/to be crazy', referring to the trance into which the subject entered on receiving the divine communication. The term is usually translated 'ecstatic', 'one who goes into ecstasy'. When one of these muijbûm was in a normal state, the texts say that the person is 'in equilibrium', that is to say, that the enthusiasm indicated a clear malfunction of the 'normal' capacities of the person affected. In order to represent this notion of equilibrium, the Akkadian verb šaqālum was used to express the idea of 'balancing, weighing', here with the meaning of 'to balance'.496 The main difference between the two 'prophets' is the desire to 'capture' the divine plans. The āpilum 'answers' a question and 'intervenes' at the behest of an interlocutor who wants to determine what the divine intentions is. The muljljûm instead is 'attacked' by the divine message anywhere at all and in any situation; afterwards, having recovered from the frenzy, he explains his experience to the appropriate person; however, he is never 'asked' about a matter and he never 'speaks' voluntarily through the mouth of a deity. 4.8.1.1. The messages of the mubbû Even though the texts from Mari are not particularly generous in the number of documents that describe 'prophetic' interventions (there are about forty texts), Dagan's intervention in this small group of texts is quite important, both for the prophecies of the āpilū and for the visions of the mu/jljû. In many cases the interventions of the mujjjjû are very pressing, with short phrases and even threats if the divine wishes are not fulfilled. Some of Dagan's interventions through a muljfjûm have already been cited above; very typical is the letter from Kibri-Dagan, governor of Terqa, to Zimri-Līm, which describes the message of a mufrbûm requiring pagrā u-sarcifices to be made;497 or another letter, also from the governor of Terqa, asking the king to perform the kispum-rilual for Ya|}dun-LTm.498 Another text refers to the prophecies of Dagan, describing the message given by a muljljûm during a religious sacrifice, in public; this is one of the few cases of the frenzied ecstasy of a mubfjûm in a place that is apparently 'favourable', suitable for the action of an āpilum. The text has been cited, in part, in the foregoing 496 J.-M.

May my lord purify.500 In this text, as in the two previous texts, Dagan's complaint refers to some kind of ritual act, in this case connected with water, that unfortunately is unknown to us. The following text describes also the message of a mufjïjûm during the assembly of the old men in Saggarātum: Ma:t 140 To my lord say, thus (says) Yaqqim-Addu, your servant. A mubbum of Dagan came to me and thus he spoke: \"In truth, can I eat of Zimrì-Līm? Give (me) a lamb, that I may eat\". I gave him a lamb. He ate it alive before the portal. He assembled the old men in front of the porch of Saggarätum and said as follows: \"There will be 'devouring', order the cities to give back the sacred goods. He who commits any violent act, let them expel him from the city. For the health of your lord Zimrl-Llm, you shall clothe me with a garment\". So he said to me. For the health of my lord, I have clothed him with a garment. Now I have written the omen he said to me and I have sent (it) to my lord.

In spite of that, it is possible that the consumption of the lamb is related symbolically to the epidemic (ukultum) foretold by the muljljûm,504 There are cases in which the mubbû act 'as a team' and with such insistence that they attract the attention of the authorities. This is the case of a letter sent by an official of Terqa that informs the king about the bad omens of the mufrfjû in connection with Sammetar's ruined house who was already dead. MA:T 141 The ecstatics of Dagan speak continually to me about the house of Sammētar, that I had sold previously: \"The god cursed the bricks of this house.

The messages of the apilû The āpilū also have a fair number of prophetic actions inspired by Dagan, and some of this evidence has already been cited above when we studied other aspects of his cult. MA:T 83 is an emblematic text as it illustrates the oracular procedure 'entrusted' to an āpilum·, the text describes how one of these 'technicians', called Lupâ^um, after performing an omen in Tuttul, has to go to Terqa to ratify the message,510 all to confirm a message that was given to Saggarātum. These are the three main sanctuaries of Dagan and in this way Zimrî-Līm attempts to make absolutely certain of the divine message in each of the holy cities. This makes the āpilum closer to the bārû, the divination 'technician' who performs hepatoscopy, who in many cases looks for confirmation of his omens.511 In discussing sacrifices to Dagan above we have already mentioned MA:T 31, cited in extenso as MA:T 86 which describes a sacrifice made by Mukannisum to Dagan of Tuttul 'for the life of my lord'. During the sacrifice, an āpilum interrupts with a 'political' speech against Babylon in a moment of tension between Mari and Jjammurapi's capital; then, in the same ceremony, the āpilum of Bêlet-ekallim intervenes, making a reference to that king, but unfortunately the text is now lost. In a letter from the āpilum of Samas to Zimri-Llm, the sun-god demands gifts for his temple in Sippar, for Addu of Aleppo, for Dagan and for Nergal of yubsalum. When referring to Dagan, the letter mentions his āpilum. 509 ARM 13 114 = ARM 26/1 210 = J.-M.

In many cases we find 'normal' people who succeed in making a connection with the gods without being considered as unusual people to be put in a special category. The most normal vehicles for making the connection are visions and dreams. The category of dreams is one of the most extensive in Mesopotamian literature, from the dreams of Gudea up to the interpretation manuals of the first millennium.521 Sometimes, in the texts from Mari, it is difficult to determine whether a message has been received through a dream or through a vision, as often the vehicle that the deity has used is not specified. However, dreams are very common, and Dagan is also the protagonist of them. One of the most emblematic cases is the famous 'revelation' of Dagan of Terqa who, by means of dream of Malik-Dagan, reproaches Zimri-Llm for his lack of attention and claims that if he had acted differently the war with the Yaminites would already have ended. The letter was sent by Itūr-asdu and has already been quoted above in connection with the Dagan of Terqa.522 J.-M. DURAND has suggested that Malik-Dagan, the dreamer, was an assinnum, on the basis of his personal name, which seems more fitting for the structure of a feminine name than a masculine one, if we consider the alternation between DN-malik (masculine) / Malik-DN (feminine).523 Another text already cited above also describes a woman's dream, which explains how an old man lived in the place of the betyls of Dagan.524 518 T.82 IX 2-4 = ARM 26/1 p. 380: 1bar kù-babbar miš-bi-\"da-gan / a-pi-Ii ša \"da-gan/ša sú-ba-tim\".

When I lived in Ganibātum, I sent Kittum-šimj3iya to Rubbān. While she was travelling they kidnapped her. Then Dagan, your lord, made me sleep without anyone having 'touched' me. Dagan spoke to me as follows: \"Are you happy or sad?\" (lit. Is your face up or down?). I (spoke) as follows: \"Sad (lit. down). I have made the journey and have not seen my maidser-vant. When my lord went to Andarig, rumours (zimzimmū) reached me from Sammētar about my maidservant. I went to him and he said to me 'yes'. He returned and broke (the deal) and did not give me my maidservant\". Dagan spoke as follows: \"While Zimri-Llm does not allow your maidservant to go out no-one (else) will set you free\". Thus, according to Dagan's command, my lord shall not retain my maidservant.526 Zunāna made contact with Dagan by means of a dream, but he specifies that no-one had touched (lapātum) him, that is to say, there was no ritual action to provoke the dream and the vision was a spontaneous act. Most significant, however, is the dialogue set up between the priestess and the god, Dagan asks how she felt and Zunāna explains the cause of her disenchantment. Finally, Dagan supports the cause of the priestess and she has the audacity to demand a satisfactory solution from Zimrí-Līm.527 4.8.2.

One of the persons has the qualifier bārûm, unfortunately, we do not know whether the term refers to all the pesons mentioned in the document or only to the last one.

Dagan, then, accompanying Šamaš and Addu. Zimrī-Līm has to find out what the will of 'his' god is from an almost political point of view but in the background there is an intimate connection between Dagan and the Middle Euphrates region, in the same way that when in the first millennium the oracular consulation is individual takes into account the 'personal' god of the client or patient. Other texts do not specify what means the god is going to use to communicate with his subjects. In a letter of which the sender and a large part of the tablet is missing, instructions are given for some kind of ritual; next, the sender of the letter records what Dagan's message was in relation to certain troops: MA:T 151 Dagan has informed me, (he said) as follows: Ί want to open the weapons! I touched the forehead of the servants of Zimrî-Līm. I sent (them) to you. (If ) they have not arrived, on day four they will arrive safely'.541 In the light of the prophetic and divination material connected with Dagan, and bearing in mind the other evidence on these matters in Mari, we may conclude that Dagan is the god cited most in these contexts. The messages from the various local forms of Dagan, whatever path they followed, occur most often in the texts. 4.9. Dagan and kingship In this section we shall study not only the royal inscriptions in which Dagan occurs but also texts that throw some light on the relationship between kingship and the god. There is no need to say that most of the occurrences are in the royal archives of Mari, but in this section the evidence from Terqa is also of relevance, due to the quantity of seals with the royal titulary that have been sound on this site. 4.9.1. Yafjdun-Līm The oldest royal inscription from the Old Babylonian period in which Dagan occurs belongs to reign of Yabdun-Līm, commemorating the king's military victories over the 'bedouin', establishing himelf as king of the banks of the Euphrates, and describing the irrgation works and the building 540 Cf.

At the beginning of the inscription, and to close the titulary, Dagan appears as a god who proclaims kingship and gives legitimacy to royal power and conquests: MA:T 152 Yat)dun-Līm, son of Yaggid-Llm, king of Mari, Tuttul and of the country of the 'bedouin', strong king, who controls the banks of the Euphrates. Dagan proclaimed my kingship, gave me the powerful weapon that fells the kings, my enemies.542 Dagan's role is to be the god who gives support to the king in his conquests. It should be noted that at the end of the inscription, the deities invoked in the curse formula are Anum, Enlil, Šamaš, Ašnan and Šakan. All five deities are clearly from the Sumero-Babylonian tradition and are mentioned in the inscription to give it a Babylonian flavour. In some way we can say that their presence in the inscription is, to a certain extent, anachronous. The curse, then, belongs to a stereotype that does not actually reflect Syrian religion. Instead, the reference to Dagan in the 'body' of the inscription is much more relevant in providing real 'facts' about Syrian religion. The later explicit reference to the banks of the Euphrates is not due to chance, after Dagan had been made the guarantor of Yabdun-Llm's kingship. We have to consider, then, the presence of the gods of the curse as purely rhetorical, in Babylonian vein, and for the same reason, understand the absence of 'purely' Syrian deities.543 4.9.2. The eponym period The largest number of royal inscriptions belong to the eponym period and most of them are votive inscriptions of Šamšī-Addu and Yasmaj)-Addu. We have already seen, above, in speaking of the Dagan of Terqa, the foundation inscription that Šamšī-Addu dedicated to him in reference to that god's sanctuary in Terqa.544 Another inscription commemorates the offering of two cups to Dagan. Unfortunately, after the royal titulary and a description of the banquet, and after referring to the god Aššur, the text is missing: 542 AO. 18236: 1-14 = F. THUREAU-DANGIN, RA 33 (1936) 49f. = D.R.

Even so, his invocation does not 'Syrianise' the gods who accompany him; on the contrary, it is they who make Šamaš appear as a Sumero-Babylonian god. On the possible reading SaJjan of Sakan in Mari cf. J.-M. DURAND, MROA 2/1 210. He postulates a 'real' presence of these gods in the Mari pantheon, based on a place-name. Even so, he does not seem very certain of the exact location of this toponym and its extremely rare occurrence in Mari sources does not allow any conclusion to be made. 544 Cf. above 95 TE:T 2."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"MA:T 153 Šamšī-Addu, the strong king, appointed by Enlil, the deputy of Aššur, the beloved of Dagan, the unifier of the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates, prince of Mari, king of Eka11ātum, governor of Subat-Enlil: A pair (of cups) for Dagan and the banquet [...] Aššur for [...].•545 The titulary of Šamšī-Addu in this inscription includes the appellative \"beloved of Dagan\" (narām Dagan) together with Enlil, that links the king with his immediate origins to the south (probably with Akkad) and with Aššur, economically the most important city in the vicinity of Eka11ātum and above all, the holy city of the region. This means that we have three gods who accompany the king and connect him with three different geographical regions, Enlil to the south, Dagan on the Euphrates and Aššur to the north.546 This structure in the titulary is the same in most of the royal inscriptions from the eponym period just as we have seen above in our analysis of the inscription that commemorates the building of the temple of Dagan of Terqa. As for the tu 'amū, the main object of the offering, it seems that it was a kind of cup used for rituals, in this case a cultic banquet {šākultum).547 A very broken letter provides another example of Dagan's role in the official titulary of Samšī-Addu: Ma:t 154 To my lord, the king of Akkad '. appointed by Dagan and [...].548 If the reading šaknum of g ì r - η ί t a proposed by D.

CHARPIN suggests that these two deities are the two principal patrons, one of the city (Dagan) and the other of the ruling dynasty (Istar).553 The seal of a servant of Yasmab-Addu also calls the king 'appointed (šaknum) by Dagan': MA:T 156 Yasmab-Addu, appointed by Dagan, Anāku-i1umma is his servant.554 A letter from a musician of Yasmab-Addu also gives the titulary of the king, in which Dagan has an eminent role: MA:T 157 Di a mi Senor, rey de Agadé, gobernador de Dagan y de Mari: así habla ŠUL-I1abra, director-de-música del rey del Universo, tu servidor, tu servidor, tu servidor (...).555 On this occasion the titles of the king are the same as in the titulary of Šamšī-Addu that appears in a very broken letter and may be used to 551 Cf. above 119 MA:T 81. 552 M.8455 = D.

Šamši-Addu has the most ambiguous titulary as it corresponds to three different geographical directions: Aššur in the high region of the Tigris with the famous sanctuary of the god with the same name; Enlil in connection with the region of Akkad, with which Šamšī-Addu had a strong connection, and lastly, Dagan representing the Middle Euphrates region with the sanctuary of Terqa as main religious pole. The titles 'appointed (šaknum) by Enlil' and especially 'deputy (iššiakkum) of Aššur' recur constantly in his titulary and reinforce, in some way, his origins and his personal preference for the upper Tigris region, a wish that is described in his 'retirement' as king to Ekallâtum. The only references to Dagan in the titulary of Samšī-Addu are in matters directly connected with that god but without ever foregoing a mention of Enlil and Aššur with the traditional epithets: in one case as builder of the temple of Dagan of Terqa557 and in another in the commemoration of the offering of two cups to Dagan.558 The titulary of Yasmab-Addu is very much shorter, chiefly due to the scarcity of royal inscriptions. In an inscription on a statue, Yasmab-Addu is called 'appointed (šaknum) by Enlil', following, in this way, his father's tradition.559 On one occasion he occurs together with the goddess Istar560 and on another he is the 'deputy' of Dagan and Istar.561 Dagan appears as the only god in the titulary on the seal of a servant of the king who is called 'deputy of Dagan'.562 The enormous number of letters from Mari also throw light on Yasmab-Addu's relationship with Dagan. The deity intervened in the dominion and defeat of the enemies of Mari. MA:T 158 My lord will not neglect the death of these enemies. When Dagan and [...] help my lord, the enemy will not be able to escape from the hand of my lord.563 556 Cf. above 159 MA:T 154. 557 Cf. above 95 4.6.1.1. TE:T 2. 558 Cf. above 159 MA:T 153. It is interesting to see how this 'loyalty' to the upper Tigris region is reflected in a commemorative inscription of the building of the temple of Aššur, known from various copies, inscribed on stamped bricks, in which the king appears only as 'deputy of Aššur', without any reference to another god, not even to Enlil (RIMA 1 0.39.9.

VILLARD reconstructs d i n g i r [(be-li-ia) ] and translates, 'When Dagan and the god of my lord...'. This translation is based on the parallel expression that we find in a letter, from the eponym period, that Zibbatum addressed to Abba, in which he expresses his anxiety about the proximity of the fight in which his brother Abba is involved. In a passage of the letter the sister prays to the gods, as they can do more than she can in this bad situation: MA:T 159 May Dagan and your god, who is at your side, come to help you.565 The parallel is clear, but we have already seen some examples in which Dagan and Addu were paired, so that neither of the two reconstructions is certain from the aspect of epigraphy, and if we accept P. VILLARD's copy, the reconstruction with Addu seems the more plausible. Lastly, a letter from Ibal-pî-El to Yasma(3-Addu connects with the old tradition of seeing Dagan as the god who bestows kingship, a tradition that we have already seen in the inscription of Ya^dun-Llm: Ma:T 160 To my lord say, thus (says) Ibal-pī-El, your servant.

The presence of Enlil in the first two seals can be explained by the identification made between the two gods and also a touch of prestige by connecting Mari royalty and its principal god —Dagan— with the principal god of the south, the polyadic god of Nippur, the great religious and cultural capital of the land of Sumer. There is, then, a play of assimilation and confusion intended by the Mari theologians set up by the interchange of appellatives (šaktium1narāmum) between the two gods. However, of most significance is the pre-eminence of Dagan in the Mari royal titulary, both in the eponym period and during the reign of Zimri-Lim. Of interest, however, is the seal of a shepherd under the command of Zimri-Llm, called Dabi'um, in which the king is called 'appointed of Addu' (šakin Addu).573 It is surprising to find this god in a position that, up to now, was occupied exclusively by Dagan. There is no clear explanation for this presence of Addu. Nor is what we know about the owner of the seal of much help. Dabi'um was a shepherd entrusted with fattening sheep and goats and we know about him from a small lot of tablets that record the contribution of animals made to him by various people, some of them high officials in the royal court. The consignment of animals was to Mari and to Terqa, and there is no element in Dabi'urn's character that explains the presence of Addu on his seal.574 However, in a letter from an āpilum of 569 D.R.

We may conclude that when gods occur in the titulary of Zimri-LTm, Dagan is always present, as the norm.577 When Dagan is accompanied by another god, it is always Enlil, alternating with the epithets 'beloved' (narāmum) and 'appointed' (šaknum). Here the 'centrality' of Dagan in the royal titulary is complete, comparable to Assur's role in the titulary of Samšī-Addu. In some way Dagan's presence strengthens in the first instance Zimri-LTm's bond with Mari and its holy capital, Terqa, and in the final instance with the whole Middle Euphrates, establishing a link with family members who preceded him as kings of Mari, who have no divine connection in the strict royal titulary, although the dynasty was proclaimed sovereign of the Middle Euphrates by Dagan.578 The close relationship between Dagan and kingship is also reflected in the correspondence of Mari. His role is particularly important in helping the king defeat enemies in his military campaigns.

In spite of everything, Itūr-Mēr represents a more local facet, strictly belonging to Mari, whereas Dagan radiates his power and influence from Terqa throughout the whole Middle Euphrates at least as far as Tuttul, seat of the god's other great sanctuary. In another letter, where someone complains of not having able to see Zimri-LTm, this divine pair is again mentioned: MA:T 169 I did not see my lord's face, even though I was thirsty, to whom Dagan and Itūr-Mēr will give a strong weapon and a lasting reign.580 Dagan and Itūr-Mēr feature here not as gods who support kingship but as gods who bestow it: weapon and kingdom, power and territory, the essential attributes of a king.

TE:T7 Iggid-Llm, deputy of Dagan, king of the country of the 'bedouin', son of Išar-Līm, servant of Il-aba and Dagan.595 The seal of the next king of the dynasty follows the very same model as his father's. TE:T8 Isib-Dagan, deputy of Dagan, king of the country of the 'bedouin', son of Iggid-Llm, servant of Il-aba and Dagan.596 The seal of yammurapi of Terqa, who ruled a generation after IsiJj-Dagan,597 also preserves the same formulary and the same structure. 592 When we speak of the 'bedouin' kingdom of Terqa, we are generally referring to what is called the land of 'Uana'. This 'land' and the 'Haneans' are in fact the non-sedentary population living in the neighbourhood of the Middle Euphrates region (chiefly Yaminites). According to the etymological proposal of J.-M. DURAND, the term banûm is related to the Semitic root hn' 'to camp' (cf. Hb. hnh HAL 319), so that banum refers to a person who camps, that is to say, one who has no fixed abode, or more specifically, the 'bedouin'. The term bonâ (ba-na) is the collective: land of the 'Bedouin' (cf. RAI 38 113; MARI 7 [1993] 47; LAPO 17 p. 417f.; cf. previously G. DOSSIN, ARM 5 p. 128 who had already identified it with the WS verb bonûm 'to camp' in Mari, in spite of a mistake in reading the text; cf. the correction by J.-M. DURAND, LAPO 17 722 n. 88; cf. also previously I.J. GELB, JCS 15 [1961] 37). For an opinion against this proposed etymology cf. M.P. STRECK, AOAT 271/1 93. 593 Cf. Α.H.

This shows that the temple and cult of the sanctuary of Dagan continued to exist during this period. The principal novelty of these seals concerns the royal titulary of the kings of Mari is the inclusion of Il-aba as protector god of the king. He is already mentioned on the seal of a servant of Kašti1iaš, an earlier king of Terqa from the Old Babylonian period. This seal calls the owner 'servant of Il-aba and Kašti1iaš'.599 Il-aba, one of the more important gods of the Sargon dynasty, paired with Dagan in an inscription of Narām-Sîn,600 is now to be found, suddenly, in a privileged position in the royal titulary of the first rulers of Middle Babylonian Terqa. In spite of everything, we have not completely lost track of him. A text from the beginning of the Old Babylonian period (one of the so-called sakkanakkum type texts) records some amounts for various gods and different rituals, among them Il-aba.601 It is also cited in an administrative text from Mari giving the boundaries of a field,602 from which we can deduce that he held some kind of property in his name and thus a temple. Another economic text records a quantity of oil for the bathing (rummukum) of the gods Dagan, Il-aba and Mārat-i1tim.603 This is well represented in the onomastic corpus we have from the Mari archives with nine names; in some cases we can determine where these persons came from, in this case they are people from the region around Mari or from the districts of Terqa and Saggarātum.604 It 597 Cf.

The new kings of Terqa took up again worship of this god even placing him in the highest section of the pantheon, in company with Dagan. It is possible that Il-aba has the role of protector god of the ruling dynasty and in this role appears on the seals of the kings of Terqa. 4.9.5. The 'Bilingual Pantheon' of Mari We have called a text in praise of Zimri-LTm written in the form of a letter addressed to the king the 'Bilingual Pantheon' of Mari. In this text are listed the various deities who protect the king of the Middle Euphrates region. The text, a Sumero-Akkadian bilingual, follows a clear Babylonian model, both in the deities it mentions and in the form. There are, however, details and possible 'second readings' or 'indigenous readings' that enrich the interpretation of the document. The text begins with the typical formula that heads letters addressed to the king. When given the royal titulary, the sovereign is defined as 'the just king, the beloved of Nunamnir'.605 The epithet Nunamnir, typical of Enlil in Babylonia, is applied to Dagan as a detail peculiar to Mari, as we saw above in discussing the sacrifices to Dagan in the Epic of ZimrT-LTm.606 Accordingly, it is an ambiguous epithet, clearly in the Babylonian style, if we keep strictly to the text, in the style of Mari —via the equivalence Enlil-Dagan— if we look at the context.607 The syncretism is obvious. Next there is an explicit reference to An and Enlil as gods who have bestowed kingship on Zimrī-Līm. The text continues with an invocation to Enki, in this way we already have the three male gods of the Sumerian pantheon cited at the beginning of the text, preceded only by an 'Enlilian' epithet attributable to Dagan. The following deity to appear is a goddess, the Mother Goddess, written as Nintur in the Sumerian text and as Ninbursag in the Akkadian text. It should be noted that Dagan is the god who follows Nintur/Ninbursag. We have already seen above how there is a close relationship between the goddess written as Ninbursag —that possibly we may have to read Ša1aš608— and Dagan. This 623: 31 Rabbān (near Mari, cf. J.-R.

Some of them have very obvious 'Enlil-type' parallels, others seem genuinely to belong to Mari or Syria. The first of them all 'The Great Mountain' (kur g&MSadû rabû) is Enlil's epithet par excellence to the extent that his famous temple in Nippur was given the name é kur 'the house of the mountain'.610 The second epithet 'father of the great gods' (a - a dingir gal-gal-e-n e/abi ilāni rabûtim) equates him with the great 'generator' gods of the neighbouring pantheons. The title of father of the gods for Dagan is not exclusive to this text; the curse in an Old Babylonian inscription found in the citadel of Aleppo mentions him as follows: AL:T 1 May Dagan, the father of the gods, curse him, may Nergal curse him, May [S]în, the lord of the first-born, take away his first-born and his name, may Išbara..., may Šamaš cover his eyes.611 609 A.1258+: 9-11 (= D.

Note that the text comes from Aleppo, seat of the principal temple of Addu, son of Dagan. Probably, this text is the same as the unpublished text that G. DOSSIN cites to prove Dagan to be the father of Addu (RAI 3 129; cf. also J.J.M. ROBERTS, ESP 75 n. 98; D.O. EDZARD, WdM 49; H.

SCHWEMER, Wettergott 220 n. 1520."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"In this curse, Dagan comes first, followed by Nergal, Sîn, IšJjara(?) and Šamaš. The inscription, then, reinforces this portrait of Dagan. To the south, An(um) is depicted as father, head of the family and therefore of the whole pantheon and his 'marginal' role in carrying out the divine will, which belongs to Enlil. The identical roles of An(um) and Dagan explain the late pairing to be found in some texts in the Babylonian literary canon and in some royal inscriptions.612 'He who puts the AnunnakQ in their place' (n a - d es da - n u η - n a1wāšer AnunnakX) is an epithet that is later generally applied to Marduk and Nabu.613 We have no knowledge of the use of this epithet in a text contemporary with or older than this manuscript from Mari. It is, therefore, the earliest evidence for the title (W)āšer Anunnaki. Is its origin Babylonian or Syrian in this case? It is quite clear that the reference to the AnunnakQ originates in the south, although the epithet could have come from Syria considering how old the evidence from Mari is and the difference in time from the other witnesss of the title. After being called 'Powerful god' (dingir a 1 i mJilum kabtum), Dagan is again given the two epithets of creator god: 'Creator of the heavens and the earth' (an ki mu-un-d ù/bāni same u ersetim) and 'father begetter of the gods' (a-a ugu dingir-e-n dabum muwallid ilāni), mother goddesses such as Mummu or generator gods such as Anšar, Anum, Enlil or Marduk have similar titles.614 See two of El's 612 There are several texts that place Anum and Dagan in parallel: one literary text, of which we have several late copies, but which possibly was composed in the second dynasty of Isin, calls the king '(one) chosen by Anum and Dagan' (nibīt Anim u Dagan cf. W.G. LAMBERT, JCS 21 [1967] 128 line 14); it is intersting to see that the Sumerian translation offers the following version: [an d e η - 1 í]1 - b i - d a m u - n i - i n - s a4- a, also placing Enlil and Dagan in parallel. In the Epic of Erra there is also a reference to this divine pair: Erra IV 33: ša sābē kidinni ikkib Anim u Dagan kakkēšunu tazzaqap 'You have made the privileged citizens bear arms, those sacred to Anum and Dagan' (cf. also tablet Illc [3]). The Myth of Anzu also pairs Anum and Dagan several times cf. Κ. HECKER, TUAT 3 75If.; C. WILCKE, APDA 61. The royal inscriptions from the end of the second millennium and during the whole of the first, both in Babylonia and in Assyria, also include the presence of this pair. An inscription of Itti-Marduk-ba1ātu, the second king of the second dynasty of Isin, records the epithet of chosen (nibitu) of Anum and Dagan in the royal titulary, cf. G. FRAME, RIMB 2 2.2.1 (p.7). A royal inscription of Simbar-Šipak, the first king of the dynasty of the country of the sea, dedicated to Enlil, calls the sovereign 'he who puts in order the paths of Anum and Dagan, he who preserves their rites' (muštēšir alkakāti Anim u Dagan mušallimu mēsīšunu cf. RIMB 2 3.1.1: 8 [p. 72]). Assurnasirpal II of Assyria is declared beloved (narām) of Anum and Dagan (cf. A.K. GRAYSON, RIMA 2 0.101.1: I 10-11 [p. 194]; 0.101.28 I 8 [p. 284]). In an inscription dedicated to Ninurta, Šamšī-Adad V calls the goddess Kutušar (mother of Ninurta and equated with Ninlil, cf. W.G. LAMBERT, RIA 6 389) 'the lady equal to Anum and Dagan' {bēlti Zinnat Anum u Dagan, cf. A.K. GRAYSON, RIMA 3 0.103.1: 18-19 [p. 182]). Sargon II of Assyria is defined as 'the one contemplated by Anum and Dagan' (nišīt inē Anim u Dagan, cf. M.-J. SEUX, ER 208). Sargon II also refers to the people of Anum and Dagan (sāb Anim u Dagan, cf. A. FUCHS, Sargon 32 line 6, 46 line 14-15; 55 line 7-8, 62 line 10, 269 line 12; cf. also M.-J. SEUX, ER 339f.). There is no doubt that this pairing of Anum-Dagan is also due to the identification of Enlil with Dagan; the presence of Dagan together with Anum may be interpreted as a type of 'substitution' of Enlil in the pair An-Enlil, common in Babylonian literature. 613 Cf. K.L. TALLQVIST, AGE 35; CAD A/2 sv. ašāru A le (p. 421 ). 614 Cf. K.L. TALLQVIST, AGE 68f.

An and Enlil, as heads of the traditional Sumero-Akkadian pantheon, named him king from the maternal womb. Enki, the god who determines destinies, decrees a good destiny and eternal life. Ša1aš, in her role as mother goddess, from her pure hands616 raises him to princedom. Šamaš, god of justice, grants him the sceptre of justice. Addu, the Storm-god, grants him a powerful weapon, and finally, Istar, in her warrior guise, bestows pre-eminent battle. All the attributes are related to the character of each deity. Dagan is no exception: he elevates him to kingship (nam-1uga1-šè mu-un-í Varia šarrutim iššušu). Dagan's character is quite clear, he is a supreme god who bestows kingship, who decides who is to be king. If Dagan had had a more 'concrete' or even a different character, this would be reflected in the attribute bestowed on the king. After the Sumerian gods and their consort, who acts as a bridge between the Sumerian triad An-Enlil-Enki and the Semitic deities (note that Nintu/Ninbursag=ŠaIaš), Dagan is the first god to be mentioned because he is the head of the pantheon, father of the gods and, as such, the one who bestows kingship. This is his principal and probably only characteristic. 4.10. Dagan and menology Some month names in the calendar of Mari contain names of deities. Unfortunately, we do not know the reason for this attribution to each of these gods.617 It is possible that festivals or rituals were celebrated in honour of the deity after whom the month is named. Dagan 'acts as sponsor' in the eighth month of the calendar of Zimri-Līm, however, a month name with the name of Dagan already occurs in the pre-Babylonising texts of the reign of Yaggid-Lïm or Yabdun-Līm.618 4.11. Dagan in the onomasticon The richness of the epigraphic material from Syria in the pre-Babylonian period and the genre of many of these documents (contracts, administrative documents, lists of persons, letters etc.) have enabled us to collect a great number of names. Of this extensive onomastic corpus, a large are theophoric names, the deities that who occur most often are Dagan, Addu and El. In what follows we shall list the names with Dagan, with translation, and afterwards we shall provide a comparative analysis with the other deities. As 615 Cf. M.H. POPE - W. RÖLLIG, WdM 280; E.T. MULLEN, DC 13f.; however, cf. the translation 'owner of heaven and earth' in L.K.

However, in order to gain more accurate view of the situation we also need to know the context of these groups of PNN, that is to say, who the other deities are that accompany him in the onomastic corpus of the various regions in order to establish and determine in a more reliable and exact way Dagan's 'real' influence. There are cases in which the relevance of this information is weakened by the scarcity of names, but in other cases we have a good indication for seeing the various local pantheons in the onomasticon. Accordingly, we have studied those villages in which Dagan occurs in the onomasticon. We shall now list them in alphabetical order, setting out the pantheon derived from each based on the names of the people from each of the various villages. - Alalab: under the control of Yambad, the capital of Orontes shows a large predominance of names with Addu, with a total of tweny-three,795 followed by Ištar796 with six, Isbara797 and yebat798 with five names each, BU-[ ]-dda-gan ARM 24: 229 II 15. \"da-[gan- ] ARM 8: 3 6. 22: 38 15'; 68 6'. 26: 59 6; 301 1\". \"da-gan-ad-x[ x] ARM 7: 280 16.

This reference to El has to be interpreted, in this period, as the name for a god in the abstract. There is no temple or ritual or cultic act connected with a god called El (or Il/Ilum). Nor does he appear in any of the lists that catalogue the chief deities of the Syrian pantheon from the first half of the second millennium. El, as father of the gods of the Ugaritic pantheon, has not yet taken shape within Syria during this period. Thus we have to interpret all the references to this El in the onomasticon as the appellative of an impersonal god, none other than the path towards a later 'personalisation' of this divine being who was to become the father of the gods. In short, here we have the frozen image of an intermediate stage; the final picture is already to be found in Ugarit, in the Middle period.1196 Dagan is clearly the main god of territories along the banks of the Euphrates. The district of both Mari and Saggarätum have a clear majority of names with this god (15,5 and 21,8% respectively); in the case of the district of Terqa, the evidence is even more transparent, since Dagan even equals the percentage of names with El, with about 21,1%. In the region to the north of the Euphrates, the region we have called Euphrates-Balib, even though less represented, also has a similar profile, with El and Dagan with two names each, as the famous sanctuary of Dagan in Tuttul is the strong point of popular worship of our god. The region to the south of Mari, downriver, that is called the land of SuJ)ûm, does not have many personal names, in the data available to us. Addu is the principal god with six names, followed by El and Dagan with four each. The meagreness of the data, however, does not allow us to obtain a very trustworthy profile of this land. In all the regions lying on the river bank, Addu is the god closest to Dagan with a percentage of about 15%. If we move away from the Euphrates basin, the data referring to Dagan changes substantially. In the region we have called the 'yābūr Triangle', however, which has a larger area (and includes the district around the Singar), Addu is the best represented god with about 18% of the names, Dagan drops to third position, with about 10%, overtaken by Istar with about 11,9%. Dagan, then, is a god who is very well represented in this area, however he is far from being the 'central' god, as in the Middle Euphrates region. The other region that is remote from the river and is important enough for any conclusion to be drawn is Yambad. Even though it has very few names in the archives from Mari, it has a good onomastic quarry in the texts from Alalab VII. There, Addu is the central god, with an undisputed percentage of the names, about 46,2%, followed at some distance by the second important deity, i.e. Istar with about 8,9% and then by Isftara and yebat with about 7,4% each. Dagan appears in fourth position alongside Šamaš, with about 5,9%. To summarise, Dagan is very well represented in the Syrian onomasticon of the Old Babylonian period, with the centre of his cult chiefly in the Middle Euphrates region, in a strip that runs from the Emar region to the 1196 On this problem, centred principally on the information from the Mari archives cf. J.-M. DURAND, MROA 2/1 152f., where in a convincing way he explains this impersonal reference to El in this period."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"land of Sut)ûm. He shares his 'kingdom' with other central deities such as Addu or the celestial gods Samas and Sîn. Outside this central zone, Dagan has an important presence in the region north of the yābūr; however, he loses the central position that he has in the Euphrates to the detriment of Addu. This god has the most homogeneous distribution throughout Syria at this time, from the Orontes basin up to the Tigris, and from Ida-maras to Qatna. 4.12. Conclusions The evidence for this period, chiefly from the royal archives of Mari, but with important contributions from Terqa and Tuttul, provides us with a portrait of Dagan as the main and central god of the Middle Euphrates region. He takes part in one of the most important rituals in the cultic calendar of the time, the kispum-ritual, in the ceremony of the 0M/H(MW. He is given the epithet of 'Lord of the Funerary Offerings (Bel pagrê)\\ offerings that were made not only in the city of Mari, but are also documented in Aleppo, with Dagan as the main protagonist, together with Salas and yebat. The rituals and cultic ceremonies involving Dagan do not end here, as he also takes part in the Upturn of the urubātum-ceremony and in processions and journeys of the divine statue, all of them, however, poorly attested in the sources for a detailed description of them. All this cultic activity generated a bureaucracy to check the number of animals to be sacrificed in the various ceremonies and religious acts. The sacrifices (riīqum) to Dagan are very well documented in the administrative texts that allocate a specified number of animals for each deity, generating what have conventionally been called 'pantheons'. In general, these texts do not represent a 'total' and complete pantheon of the Syrian religion of the period, but they do reflect 'partial pantheons': the pantheon of the palace or the pantheon of the women of the palace, in which Dagan is also central. As for Dagan's consort, there is no explicit definition in any text from Old Babylonian Syria. However, there are reliable indications that Ša1aš is Dagan's consort in this period as well. The fact of appearing written under the disguise of Ninbursag has meant that her presence has gone unnoticed until J.-M. DURAND identified her recently. The presence of Dagan together with Salas and yebat in Aleppo, the forerunners in Ebla and later tradition (chiefly the list An=Anum) strengthen this hypothesis. The worship of Dagan rooted in the Middle Euphrates region is reflected in the texts by the importance of his various local dedications. Terqa excels as the main sanctuary of Dagan in this period in the light of the texts from Mari. The city is called 'Beloved of Dagan (Narāmat Dagan)' and the kings intervenes there to restore the temple or make sacrifices after a military victory. In this sanctuary they celebrated various ceremonies, among which stands out the re-enactment of the combat between the Storm-god and the god of the sea. The fame of the temple of Dagan of Terqa is also evident in the arrival of various chiefs and kings to sacrifice. The importance of the sanctuary also generated important administrative documentation that tells us all the artesanal work that was done around the figure of Dagan and his"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"statue, including the making of a throne that merited being named after one of regnal years of Zimri-LTm. The other great sanctuary of Dagan was in Tuttul, already known since the third millennium in the archives from Ebla. The documentation from Mari is not so generous as with the Dagan of Terqa, but we do know of a journey by Yasmab-Addu to this city and the dedication of a votive inscription by the same monarch to Dagan of Tuttul. The domination of this city by Mari was not well received by the priesthood of the temple of Dagan, who saw in the representative of the king of Mari (bassânum) a threat to their leadership. The other temples dedicated to Dagan, like those of Mari, Subätum, Urab, yakkulän, Saggarätum, Zarri-amnān and Dašrān have much fewer texts, generally describing administrative matters (the issue of material for the sacrifices) or daily problems of temple life, such as the supply of certain products or the manufacture of items for the maintenance of the sanctuary. Of particular interest is Zimri-Lîm's stay in the temple of Dagan in öakkulän with a meeting with Yarim-Llm, the king of Aleppo and his consort Gasera. The fact that this encounter took place in this temple has an important symbolic meaning. The presence of Dagan in the oath formulae strengthens this central position that he held in the religious and administrative life of the Middle Euphrates region. He occurs there almost always and only the deities change or the kings who accompany him. Itūr-Mēr, as polyadic god of the city of Mari, is one of these deities who often occur in the oaths accompanying Dagan; there are cases, however, where the local deity of the place where the matter is to be settled is added, for example yanat in Saplratum. One of the most prominent features of Dagan in this period is his important presence in matters relating to prophecy. Dagan appears very often giving messages to individuals (generally the āpilū and the mu^/jû) that they subsequently transmit to superior institutions. Dagan's intervention by means of these messages in the affairs of state is important and in certain problems of foreign policy the god intervened to give his vision of the matter and offer a solution. Divination and extispicy in particular also had their role in Syrian religion in this period, and some texts from Mari and Tuttul document this activity of personnel belonging to the respective temples of Dagan. Being the principal god, Dagan received special treatment from the monarchy, both of Mari and of Terqa. There are various royal votive inscriptions by these kings. In all of them, Dagan has a special role, so much so that he went on to become part of the royal titulary, the king was 'The beloved of Dagan (Narām Dagan)', 'The deputy of Dagan' (iššak Dagan)' or 'The one appointed by Dagan (šakin Dagan)'. Dagan accompanies the sovereign in battle, bestowing on him a powerful weapon and a lasting reign. His identification with Enlil is evident from the use of traditionally 'Enlil' epithets such as Mullil or Nunamnir. Dagan's central position of leader within the pantheon of the Middle Euphrates region is reinforced in the 'Bilingual Pantheon' of Mari, in which Dagan has all the attributes of a sovereign god and father of the gods, equivalent to the duo"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"An-Enlil in Sumero-Akkadian tradition or the western El of the middle period. This portrait as father god is confirmed by the inscription from Aleppo and was to be continued later in the texts from Emar. The information from the onomasticon only clinches the matter. Dagan is the best represented deity in the theophoric names of the region that goes from Tuttul to Su|)ûm, only Addu is at his level and at a certain distance. Beyond the Euphrates the panorama changes and Addu is elevated to the principal deity. Nevertheless, Dagan does not cease to have a significant role in regions far from the Euphrates such as yābūr."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"THE MIDDLE BABYLONIAN PERIOD If the textual material of the Old Babylonian period in Syria was basically centered in the lower area of the Middle Euphrates region, with the abundant information from Terqa and especially of the royal archives of the city of Mari, the Middle Babylonian period in Syria has its basic textual source in the upper part of the Middle Euphrates region and the western region of the continent with Ugarit on the coast and A1a1aft on the bank of the Orontes. As in the study of the god Dagan, they are the two principal poles of our research. On the one hand, the abundant material found in the city of Emar and neighbouring centres, such as Ekalte and Azu, on the bank of the Eu-phrates, provide us with an amount of information that is important enough to obtain a (partial) portrait of Dagan and of his context in Syrian religion in the Late Bronze Age. The discovery of texts in Emar in the seventies has provided almost a thousand documents and fragments of tablets. Clandes-tine and official excavations carried out in the region neighbouring Emar have provided dozens more texts. On the other hand, and away from the Euphrates, the city of Ugarit, one of the commercial metropolises of the Mediterranean, is the other great source of information for this period. Un-fortunately, the city of AlalaJj provides us with very little material on Da-gan, its only relevance being its contribution to increase the volume of onomastic information of the period. The tablets found in El-cAmarna, ancient Aftetaton, in middle Egypt, only provide a single name from Syria, the only reference to that god in those archives. 5.1. The Middle Euphrates region In this section we shall study the texts from the three main epigraphic sources of the Middle Euphrates region during the Middle Babylonian pe-riod, that is to say: Azu (Tell a1-Hadīdī),1 Ekalte (Tell Munbāqa)2 and Emar (Maskana Qadīma).3 In view of the large amount of material that has been found out of context in clandestine excavations, we have preferred to study all the material from these three sites together. In spite of everything, the 1 All the epigraphic material from this site (fourteen tablets) remains unpublished; cf. R. Whiting's report cited by R. H. DORNEMANN in AASOR 44 (1977) 145f„ and MoE 218f. 2 Most of the epigraphic material (about one hundred texts and fragments) from this site remains unpublished; cf. W. VON SODEN, MDOG 114 (1982) 71-77.

MAYER, UF 21 (1989) 133-139. 3 Most of the eight hundred texts (out of a total of some nine hundred fragments) have been published by D. ARNAUD in Emar 6; however, clandestine excavations have brought to light a large number of texts from Emar or from neighbouring sites; for the publication of these texts cf. the bibliography in D. ARNAUD, MROA 2/2 39f.; cf. also the texts published later by G. BECKMAN in TVE."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"proximity of the villages, and the similarity, both in content and in the formulary of the documents, allow a combined study without impairing the final picture. To all this must be added that the texts from Emar make up the bulk and are the basis for our approach to the Middle Euphrates region during the Middle Babylonian period. At this time, the city of Emar was under Hittite control4 since Suppiluliuma had conquered the land of Aštata towards the middle of the XIV century. Later, Mursiii II rebuilt the city and Emar remained under the control of the province of Karkemis. Emar retained a local monarchy,5 possibly with very few powers, in spite of that, however, the city continued to be economically and administratively active and, on the other hand, kept its local traditions. Fortunately, part of this activity can be reproduced thanks to the epigraphic finds in Emar and neigh-bouring cities. In this way, a city on the edge of the Hittite Empire provides us with a valuable picture of the Middle Euphrates region in the Late Bronze Age. 5.1.1. The writing dk u r One of the characteristics of the texts from the Emar region is the peculiar writing that was adopted for the god Dagan; alongside the classical syllabic writing (dda-gan) that is well attested from the third millennium, the texts from Emar and from the smaller cities in its vicinity often use the logographic writing dk u r to denote the chief god of the pantheon in the Middle Euphrates region. The reading Dagan of this sign was first proposed by D. ARNAUD6 and later confirmed by R. WHITING without knowing ARNAUD's conclusions.7 At first this identification was based on the read-ing of names written in cuneiform and in hieroglyphic Hittite;8 prosopogra-phy, however, is enough to be able to prove how the same persons with a theophoric name with Dagan occur in some tablets with the syllabic writing and in others with the logographic writing dk u r.9 What is the reason for this 'regional' writing of Dagan and what is its origin? We have very little information to answer these questions. A god dk u r is well known in Mari, however there is nothing that allows us to identify him with Dagan. J.-M. DURAND has proposed identifying Mari dk u r with an underworld god yubur.10 The most likely hypothesis is to connect the writing d k u r in Emar with one of the epithets common to Dagan and Enlil: k u r - g a 1 'The Great Mountain' already to be found in the Mari of Zimri-LTm in con-nection with Dagan.11 At Emar, Dagan is called k u r - g a 1 in a list of 4 Cf. a short summary of the history of Emar in this period in S.

It occurs in Azu, Ekalte, Emar and, indirectly, in Karkemis since a person from this city preserves this local writing in his name, found in a document from Ugarit.14 As for the two scribal traditions of Emar15 it seems that there was a clear tendency to use dk u r in texts of the 'Syro-Hittite' type, whereas 'Syrian' type texts more generally used the syllabic writing.16 5.1.2. The rituals from Emar The contribution of the archives from Emar to the history of Late Bronze Age Syria is fundamental, since this period is particuarly poor in epigraphic finds in this region. There is, however, a distinctive characteristic of these finds in Emar, the texts include a large number of economic and administra-tive documents, as happens in any other epigraphic find in the cuneiform world, even though the archives from Emar provide us with a series of in-digenous ritual texts that assist us in understanding better the religion of the time and in some way complement the mythological and ritual documents from Ugarit.17 These Emar rituals have been and continue to be, an inex-haustible source of information and have led to a torrent of studies and, to some extent, have changed the view of Syrian religion that had been held. Next we shall study each of the rituals in which Dagan intervenes in some way. Considering the length of some of these texts and the number of du-plicates preserved, in many cases we shall refrain from reproducing the com-plete ritual, limiting ourselves to making a summary of its main characteristics and will only cite the passages that we consider most rele-vant. 5.1.2.1. The zukru festival What is called the 'zukru festival (e ζ e n)' in the texts from Emar is the most important festival of the cultic calendar of Emar of the middle period, the most elaborate and the longest lasting. The term that gives the festival its name has no clear etymology. One of the explanations connects zukru with Akkadian zikarum 'male'.18 The most plausible suggestion and the one that has been most accepted by scholars, however, is the one that con-12 Cf. below230EM:T6. 13 Cf.

Nevertheless, there is also a badly damaged manu-script that describes the zMÄrw-festival as an annual festival and it is possible that this source corresponds to a much older version of the ritual.21 The basic structure of long version of the ritual and most complete is as fol-lows:22 the festival took place at the new year in the seventh year of a seven-year cycle. Dagan was the principal god of the ritual, even though the text systematically mentions almost all the deities of Emar pantheon in compiling the list of sacrificial offerings. The long version (Emar 6/3 373) emphasises the role of the king as the principal offerer, unlike the short version (Emar 6/3 375) where the king has no specific role. The beginning of the long version is missing, however the simple ver-sion preserves the beginning of the text which has the title of the ritual and stresses the dedication of the festival to Dagan: EM:T 1 Tablet of the ZM&rw-festival. When the city of Emar offers the ZM^ru-festival to Dagan.23 According to this version, the first offering is of four ewes to Dagan on day 14 of the month of Zaratu (the twelfth month24). Given the bad condition of the manuscripts of the long version, it is not possible to determine in which month the first offering was made that we can read in the text. In parallel with the short version, most scholars restore the same month, Zaratu. How-ever, in his new edition, D.E. FLEMING, prefers to reconstruct the date as day 24 of the month of Niqalu (the second month) of the sixth year.25 After a distribution (zâzu) of food by the king to all the gods, a lamb is offered 19 R.

On day fifteen [line 44], the day of Saggar,28 Dagan, Ninurta and Saššābētu, Bêlet-ekalli, Sîn and Šamaš of the palace go in procession towards the gate of the betyls. There are offerings of animals, food and drink for each of the six deities who take part in the ceremony. After the banquet, the stones are anointed with oil and blood. Before evening the statues of the gods return (šūlû) to the city and the ceremony of homage (kubādu) is per-formed. On the seventh day [line 75] of the zwAru-festival, all the gods of Emar are revered (palāÌju). At this stage the text [line 77] becomes a list of the various deities to whom offerings of sheep, goats and cattle are made, as well as offerings of food and drink. The first to be mentioned is Dagan [lord of the offspring], followed by the Storm-god (dIM), Dagan (without epithet) and eleven further deities and then immediately Dagan of the palace followed by dedications of Istar. Afterwards, ewes and cereals are offered to Dagan, lord of the hole' (bel barri), and after the mention of another deity, offerings are made to four successive dedications of Dagan: the 'two' Dagans, the Dagan, the lord creator (bēlu qūni), the Dagan, the lord of the camp (bēl karāše), a Dagan with a lost epithet and Dagan, the lord of inhabited regions (bēl dadmī). Next, eleven additional deities are mentioned. After specifying a new quan-tity of sheep and goats, food and drink and offering it first to the lord of Gabba, there are four offerings, followed by four dedications of Dagan: as lord of the valley (bēl amqi), and as the lord of SQmi, Buzqa and Yabur. 26 For the translation and interpretation of this (and other) epithets of Dagan to be found in the texts from Emar cf. the section on epithets, below 5.1.9. 27 Emar 6/3 373 15 = TE 236 18: dk u r en s i g4 us-sa i g i-ίιί kut-tu-mu. 28 For an interpretation of this day as the full moon, cf.

The text continues with four more deities and finally, the tablet is broken at this point and some 25 to 30 lines are missing. At the beginning of the fourth column, the text [line 163] describes how the wagon [of Dagan] passes through the middle of the betyls. Also Sciššabētu and Ninurta are involved and the little ceremony of homage is performed and the anointing of the betyls with oil and blood. At this point the text is clearly different as it leaves a blank of about eight lines.30 Next [line 169], it describes the procession of the statues of the deities, how Dagan, lord of the offspring, is brought out with his face covered and the litttle ceremony of homage is performed. After a banquet, Dagan's wagon passes through the middle of the betyls, followed by Nin-urta. Afterwards, the animals are purified and Saggar leaves the temple of Ninurta in procession towards the city of Emar. Day 25 of Niqali [line 180], in the sixth year, Dagan and all the gods leave in procession to the gate of the betyls with their faces covered, both there and back. Dagan's wagon passes through the middle of the betyls, followed by Ninurta and when the offerings are finished, they return to the city of Emar. The following year [line 186], on day 14 of the first month, animals are distributed to the gods. On day 15, Dagan, lord of the offspring, leaves in procession with his face covered, together with all the gods and the Saššabēyānātu, for the gate of the betyls. There the appropriate offerings are made. The same day, Dagan, the very father (abuma), goes out, and Saggar also. Before the evening, Dagan passes through the middle of the betyls with his face covered, the ritual is celebrated and the food is returned to the city. On the sixth day, animals are distributed to the deities. The following day [line 202'], Dagan and all the gods of Emar and the Saššabēyānātu leave in procession with their faces covered. The prescribed rituals are per-formed and all the food goes back to the city. Dagan's face is uncovered and the wagon is made to pass among the betyls; afterwards Ninurta does the same, and the prescribed rituals are performed. Lastly the tablet makes a final total of the animals used during the whole festive cycle: 700 lambs, 50 cows and 12 sheep. This ritual is fundamental for knowing the Emar pantheon and the epi-thets and dedications of the deities. Also, it was the most important ritual of liturgical calendar of Emar, since all the deities of that city took part in it. D.E. FLEMING (TE 133f.) connects the Emar zukru with the rituals of the akītu of lower Mesopotamia and with certain Hittite rituals. Common to all 29 D.E. FLEMING'S edition differs in the reconstruction of this passage since it places source Β (Msk. 74290d + 74304a = Emar 6/2 608) immediately after line 135' of ARNAUD's edition in Emar 6/3 373.

As for Dagan, of significance is the reference to him and his individual presence in many passages of the ritual, since it was celebrated in his honour and he features in it as head of the pantheon. He shares many passages with Ninurta, the local god of the city of Emar, in this way they form a duo: 'head of the pantheon' - 'local god', that we have already seen in other centres of the Middle Euphrates region, such as Mari, with the 'duo' Dagan - Itūr-Mēr. 5.1.2.2. The kissu festival to Dagan A series of tablets found in Emar correspond to four rituals called kissu and dedicated to five deities: the first three to Dagan, Ereskigal and Ea respec-tively, and the last to the couple Išfoara and Ninurta. The etymology of the title of the festival does not clarify the real purpose of the ritual. Various etymologies have been proposed but without a satisfactory result.31 The kissu festival was celebrated in the city of Satappi, which may lie south of Emar.32 The most elaborate ritual is the one that, according to the text, belongs to Dagan33 although in fact it seems that the main protagonist was Ninkur, his consort. The festival proceeded as follows:34 The first day is the day of consecration (qaddusu) to the gods with per-fumes, bread and beer [line 4], Afterwards, the statue of the goddess Ninkur is taken down to the temple (of Dagan35) and an ox and an ewe are sacri-ficed. At this moment the nugagtu-priestess36 enters on the scene and makes the appropriate 'cries' or 'moans' (b u n-ši). Part of the sacrificed animals is offered to the goddess and four tables are prepared, one for Da-gan, one for Isbara and Ninurta and two for Alal and Amaza. The following day [line 10] offerings of bread and meat are made to the gods of Satappi and two lambs are sacrificed, a part being offered to the gods. Those charged with the consecration (šarrū^) prepare a banquet and sacrifice the lambs in 31 D.E. FLEMING suggests connecting it with Akkadian kussû 'throne' (HSS 42 258), even though one of the manuscripts of the festival calls it e ζ e η la, possibly related to Akk. lalû 'abundance' (cf. HSS 42 259). For a possible connection with the Semitic root k-s-y 'to cover oneself, conceal' (DLU 228 s.v.) or with Hebrew kese' ('full moon' cf. HAL 463) cf. D. ARNAUD, MROA 2/2 24. Cf. also M.E. COHEN, CC 351f. A. TSUKIMOTO (ASJ 14 [1992] 299) transcribes and transliterates the term kissu, implicitly connecting it with Akk. kissu 'sacred place, sanctuary, cella' (AHw 489 s.v. kissu I; CAD Κ 443f.). Cf. a summary of proposals in E.J. PENTIUC, HSS 49 102f. (he suggests translating it 'throne'). 32 Cf. D. ARNAUD, MROA 2/2 13; for a possible etymology of the toponym cf. R.

ARNAUD interprets the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"the temple during the three days. Then the high priestesses (nin-d i n g i r) of the Storm-god of Šūmi and of Šatappi offer bread and bever-ages. The fourth day [line 21], they get Ninkur up and in the evening the two damsels (é - g i 4- a) of the second day return to the temple of Ud[ja with bread and beer. The singers (zamniārū) enter and sing to Suwala and Ugur. In the fc/j5M-festiva1s to Ereskigal and Ea,38 Dagan is not explicitly men-tioned in the text. Some scholars have claimed to see an epithet of Dagan in the title 'Lord of the house',39 however, there is no parallel to indicate that this identification is certain; D.E. FLEMING has identified this 'lord of the house' as a participant in the ceremony who is dedicated to preparing the animals and sacrificing them, as in the festival of the n i η - d i n g i r. It is possible that they were heads of clans, without being 'professionals' of the religious rituals.40 At the end of the text that describes the kissu to Ea there is a reference to offerings of bread to Dagan in his temple, however, the text is very broken and, in fact, we do not even know whether it belongs to the same ceremony as the kissu to Ea.41 In the case of the kissu to Iš])ara and Ninurta, the reference to Dagan is explicit in making the statues of Is^ara and Ninurta return(?) to the temple of Dagan.42 There is another ritual connected with the kissu, however, that does not specify the deity towards whom it was directed.43 In the title the text speaks of the day of the consecration of the &mu-festivals in the temple of the 'Lord of the house'.44 The beginning of the ritual describes practi-cally the same ceremony as the kissu to Dagan, with Ninkur added, the priestess nugagtu uttering her 'moans' and laying the four tables. On the same day, sacrifice is made to Suwala and various offerings of vegetables are made. On the second day, sacrifice is made to the gate of the betyls, in front of Dagan 'Lord of the valley' (bēl amqi). The remainder of the text is dam-aged; however, it seems to be a more complete version of the kissu to Dagan that we described above. The kissu festivals are the most difficult rituals to interpret in the whole of the Emar liturgy. D. ARNAUD has proposed seeing these festivals as a commemoration of the god(dess)'s descent to the underworld and his later resurrection. The fact of laying down the statue of Ninkur was a symbolic gesture of the burial of the goddess. The presence of the 'mourning-woman' term as singers (Emar 6/3 p. 381) followed by A. TSUKIMOTO, ASJ 14 (1992) 303. M.E. COHEN connects it with the king (CC 353); V. HAAS and D. PRECHEL do not venture any translation (die šarru-Ku1tfunktionâre/die ía/ru-Leute) cf.

Afterwards, on the fourth day the goddess is made to reappear (lit. 'raise' tebû S). Following ARNAUD's interpretation, the underworld part would be personified by deities such as Se'ôl (dšu-wa-la) and Rašap (du - g u r).45 From another point of view, the fact of laying down the statue of Ninkur in the temple of Dagan may simply mean the sacred marriage rite between the divine couple. The presence of the priestess nugagtu may also take the same route. There is no clear indication to see this person as a 'mourner', the etymology of her name provides no conclusive data since the relation with Akk. nagāgu 'to shout' does not specify the type of shout made, whether a lament or simu-lated cries of pleasure.46 On the other hand, the connection between Suwala and Sc'ôl ^šu'āl) is possible, but not certain;47 Suwala may be equated with Nabarbi, Suwaliyat's consort, an Anatolian god identified with Ninurta.48 D. ARNAUD strengthens his argument for the existence of gods who 'die' by means of the onomasticon, as there are theophoric names with the element yamūt- which, according to D. ARNAUD, in principle may be related to a WS root mwt 'to die'.49 This interpretation has been questioned by J.-M. DURAND, who suggests connecting yamut with mutum 'hero' and, as a result, the names would have to be interpreted as 'DN is the hero'.50 Re-cently, however, he is more cautious and prefers to leave this type of name as uncertain.51 Whatever the interpretation may be, the connection with the root /m-w-t/ is very unlikely. For all these reasons it is possible to connect the kissu-ritual with some kind of rite related to the commemoration and remembrance of the marriage of the divine couple Dagan and Ninkur.52 A more cautious interpretation is the one proposed by D. E. FLEMING who considers the kissu rituals as a simple commemoration ceremony of the enthronement of the deities, more specifically the 'thrones' (kussû) of the gods.53 45 For D. ARNAUD's interpretation, cf. MROA 2/2 24f.; cf. also D.E. FLEMING, HSS 42 171f., who is inclined to the view that it is the 'symbolic' death of the goddess. 46 On this possibility cf. M.E. COHEN, CC 352; D.E. FLEMING (HSS 42 173) clearly opts for a lament, based on Akkadian ikillu. 47 B.B. SCHMIDT, IBD 126 n. 388. Cf. however the identification of it also made by E.

The enthronement of the mas'artu We know this ritual thanks to a single manuscript,54 which describes the enthronement of the mas'artu-priestess55 of Istar. The text follows the model of the enthronement of the priestess n i η - d i n g i r of the Storm-god: first of all it begins by indicating the preperations to be made on the eve of the enthronement. Next, the enthronement begins, followed by seven days in which follow the ceremonies and offerings of various products. On the second day of the enthronement (malluku), 'when (the sun) shines' {kītna inammir), a powerful bull (g u d ^w-ur-za),56 a pure lamb and a she-goat are sacrificed in the temple of Dagan, in front of the god, afterwards, cups of Dagan are filled with wine and the rest of the food is prepared.57 The same offerings are made on each of the following days, but to different deities, on the third day to the Storm-god, the fourth to Ninurta, the fifth to the gods (d i n g i r - m e s) and the sixth to Ea.58 During the fifth day men of com-bat perform some (kind of) ceremony in front of the door of Dagan (bāb Dagan)\\ unfortunately the text is broken and we do not know what kind of ceremony or feast was celebrated.59 5.1.2.4. The ritual of the imištu Known from a single and quite damaged manuscript,60 it seems that this ritual revolves round the king (i-mi-iš-ti sa lugal kur ία u [ru...]) who has to make sacrifices and offerings in the temple of Dagan (a-na é-ti ük u r sa ru-ujjfja-te) and, possibly, in the temple of Anna. It is the only royal ritual from Emar. We do not know the meaning of the word from which the ritual takes its name. D. ARNAUD interpreted imištu in relation with Akk. amertu 'inspection';61 it is possible also to connect it with the evening, the late hour when the ritual was celebrated62 (a-na pa-ni nu-ba-at-ti). We can say little more about this ritual as the state of the text does not permit any further conclusions. 54 Emar 6/3 370. 55 For an etymology related to Akkadian ša'āru II 'to be victorious, to win; to vanquish' (AHw 1118; CAD Š/1 2) based on the connection of the priestess with the warrior aspect of Ištar (Ištar tābāzi), cf.

The ritual of the benpa of the oxen This ritual known from a single exemplar63 that is quite damaged, espe-cially at the beginning, records a series of offerings to Dagan consisting of various kinds of bread, a lamb' and a silver cup. The ritual was performed inside the temple of Dagan.64 The term benpa, which would provide basic information for the purpose of the ritual, remains uncertain. D. ARNAUD translates frenpa as 'prospérité', proposing a Semitic root lh-n-bl 'to blos-som',65 unquestionably related to Akk. banābu 'to grow abundantly'.66 According to this interpretation, the ritual would be connected with the prosperity of the oxen. Nevertheless the form frenpa is very irregular and D. ARNAUD's interpretation is rather hypothetical. D.E FLEMING suggests that this ritual is another fragment of a fo'ssw-festival to some deity unknown to us,67 and the basis for this possible relationship is the similarity between the last fragment of the kissu to Ea68 and this ritual of the frenpa. 5.1.2.6. The ritual of the '''W-ú-ri This ritual was defined by D. ARNAUD in his edition of the text as 'the ritual of the oracular stones',69 and this interpretation of the text is provided by the presence of {d)ar-ú-rP° that D. ARNAUD related to the Hebrew root Ie-w-r/ 'to be awake, stir'71 that in Habakkuk 2:19 is connected with stones.72 As we may infer from the edition of D. ARNAUD, the <d)ar-ú-ri are stones that were used as a way of interpreting the divine will and their interpreters were the nāgirtu (nāgirti ša ar-ú-ri). In fact we can say little if we keep to what the text says; we do not know who exactly the {d)ar-ú-ri are, nor whether they are singular or plural. About the nāgirtu all we can say is that they are the feminine forms of Akk. nāgiru, which means 'herald', and there is no reason why they are specifically interpreters of an oracle. What is clear is that the ritual was performed around the goddess Ninkur, even though other deities receive offerings, including Dagan who receives naptanu-breadJi Unfortunately, the text is very broken and it is impossible to specify where the ritual was celebrated and what the original name of the ceremony was. 63 Emar 6/3 394. 64 Emar 6/3 394 37: inaé0 k u r k ú na [g. 65 Emar 6/3 p. 397 η. 31.

The yidašu of Dagan During the month of yalma, what was called the new moon (f}idašu)74 of Dagan was celebrated. In this ceremony, a lamb from the city was sacrificed and the divine dagger stayed in the temple. On the eve of the 3rd day, sacri-fices were made in the temple of Dagan, cups were filled and a bird was burnt. This ceremony is only attested in a single document: a liturgical calendar that describes the main cultic activities grouped according to month. The section of the new moon of Dagan runs as follows: EM:T2 The month of Halma: the second day, the ceremony of homage will be cele-brated in the temple of Dagan. In the evening they shall fill the tašītu-cups with wine. A bird will be burnt. The third day (is) the new moon of Dagan. A lamb of the city. The god's dagger shall remain in the temple. The skin of the lamb (is) of the diviner.75 Probably there was some kind of procession, since the text stipulates that the god's dagger is to remain in the temple, unlike what happens in the same month on day eight, when yalma goes out accompanied by the dag-ger.76 The act of filling the tašītu-cups and the burning of the bird are liturgical actions that occur very rarely in the texts from Emar; they occur in another liturgical calendar, in this case a monthly calendar, that describes daily cultic activities but, unfortunately the month is not preserved: EM:T 3 The day of the opening of the doors: one lamb, one litre [...].

In this way the months of Marzafoäni and Abu may be considered equivalent; they are two names for the same month.82 The same text, Emar 6/3 452, describes how on day 26 of Abu the doors were shut (gläi g-meš e-da-lu) and Emar 6/3 463 describes how, on the first day of the month, the doors were opened (cf.

In his edition of the texts from Emar D. ARNAUD interpreted the term as 'sea' on the basis of pairing of Ištar sa abi with dia-a-mi in the zukru-festival.88 2. Another possible interpretation is to relate it to a type of pit or hole89 as a way of being connected with the next world.90 3. It has been connected with Semitic abu 'father, ancestor'.91 With this interpretation only the etymology of the term would be changed, however the source of the ritual would be the same as in the case of 'hole': the cult of the dead. 4. Another interpretation based on the underworld is to see a-bi-i as a tumulus, imitating those on tombs, in order to make contact with the next world.92 5. W.T. PITARD claims to see in the term a-bi-i a type of person (abbū) in charge of the temples and other buildings (kallu and bit tukli) who re-ceives yearly provisions during the month of abu.9i 6. E.J. PENTIUC tentatively proposed understanding this term as a kind of porch at the entrance of the temple, where the offerings were laid out.94 Given the close relationship of the month of Abu with the cult of the dead, the most plausible interpretation seems to be that abū (a-bi-i/a-bi) was connected in some way with the underworld; what we cannot know is the type of cultic topos in question. A hole seems the most likely. However, as 85 W. SALLABERGER, KKUZ 1 205f. 86 Cf. W. SALLABERGER, KKUZ 1 206 η. 980. 87 Apart from the connections with Dagan, there is an a-bi-i in the temple of Ninkur (Emar 6/3 452 33'), one in the temple of Alal (Emar 6/3 452 41'); one in the palace (Emar 452 6/3 39' a-na a-bi-i ša é-kál-lì) and another in the bit tukli (Emar 452 6/3 32' and 52'. For the various interpretations of bit tukli cf. D.E. FLEMING, HSS 42 115 with bibliography; W.T. PITARD translates 'abu of the storehouse' cf. EHRC 130f.). Text 446 also records an offering a-na a-bi é d i n g i r (Emar 6/3 446 79'), but unfortunately the state of the text does not allow us to know the month during which these offerings were made. 88 Emar 6/3 373 92; cf.

PITARD has pointed out95 the expression 'before (ana pāni) the a-bi-i' seems to indicate that the offering was not libated, it was not poured into the hole as would be expected. In spite of everything, there is only one reference to offerings before (ana pānî) the a-bi-i, the other references are always offerings 'to' (ana). It should also be noted that the use of the verb naqû (s i s k u r) is restricted to connections with deities and/or the dead. Nevertheless, in Emar there is only one occurrence where the verb naqû is applied to living people,96 on the other hand, the fact that the great cere-mony of homage is celebrated 'in the gate of the cemetery'97 is one more indication for interpreting the ritual in connection with the cult of the dead.98 In this way, and returning to the new moon (fridasu), the pattern of rela-tionship among the three texts is as follows: 446 463 452 Day 16 Marza(jani Ištar's 'round' (sa-du). Day 16 Abu Istar's 'round' (sa-du). Day 26 Abu Closure of the doors. 1 Halma Day 1 month χ Opening of the doors. 1 bird to Dagan. 2 of Halma kubadu in the temple of Dagan. Cups are filled.

The ceremony of the new moon-/jidašu of Dagan, during the month of Abu/Marzabāni represents the transition from a period dedicated to the forces of the next world to a better and more favourable time to the living and nature, and, paradoxically, is an 'annual' new moon. It is the most impor-tant new moon of the year and Dagan, as head of the pantheon and father of 95 EHRC 136; cf. also D.E: FLEMING, HSS 42 300. 96 Cf. W.T.

Dagan and the divine dagger A fragment of an annual liturgical calendar describes a ceremony involving Dagan and the divine dagger. This ritual is attested in three tablet fragments that describe the same ritual although they are not duplicates, making diffi-cult its reconstruction with certainty. In his edition of them, D. ARNAUD, made a composite transliteration of the three manuscripts, but there are some passages that are difficult to place and the basis of the following translation is manuscript A: Em:T5 [...] The divine dagger (C) [...] the ox, the lambs, four calves (C: 1 calf) they shall eat before Dagan [...] the betyls, on the seventh day, like? the day [...]. Before Dagan and the gods and the divine dagger of the god(s) [...]. Dagan and the gods7 shall go out; they shall eat and drink [...].\" Some lines later, already in a very broken context, it again refers to Dagan: 'they shall approach the temple of Dagan'.100 D. ARNAUD reconstructs line 5' of the composite text with the god Ea making a pair with Dagan. It seems more plausible to reconstruct 'the gods' (d i n g i r - h i - a) in line 5' of the composite text, as in line 4' of the composite text. Dagan and Ea only appear in connection with the lists of sacrifices101 and in the zukru-rilual, where they are mentioned, followed by the inventory of offerings.102 5.1.3.

Comparative table of the hierarchical lists of offerings in Emar. What stands out most from this series of divine names is the order in which they are cited. The list is headed by 'Dagan, Lord of the offspring', followed by Ninlil who occurs here accompanied by Dagan of the offspring.105 It is quite clear that here Ninlil is the consort of the god Dagan, by means of the known identification between Dagan and Enlil, attested from the third mil-lennium. Unfortunately we do not know for certain the 'indigenous' reading of the writing Ninlil. On the following line there is another epithet of Dagan 'The Great Mountain' (šadû rabû), an 'Enlilian' epithet par excellence that here evidently refers to the principal god of the Middle Euphrates region.106 This epithet is already connected with Dagan in the Mari text A. 1258+ (MA:T 177), as we saw above. We have, then, the first three lines dedicated to Dagan, his wife and one of his more ancient epithets. Both the reference to Ninlil, and the mention of 'The Great Mountain' indicate the text to be 'learned', with clear Babylonian influence on the form; however, the source is totally Emar. After the three lines dedicated to Dagan, the text mentions the Storm-god accompanied by his wife öebat, and he is followed by an-other famous couple: Ea and Damkina, followed by the two principal astral 104 Emar 6/3 378 1-8. 105 Ninlil also occurs in the Emar exemplar of the Weidner list accompanied by Enlil (Emar 6/4 539 Γ-2\"). In this same list Dagan occurs, very broken (Msk 74165j II 17' = Emar 6/2 p. 422), followed by an extra line of which only the d is preserved and next Da[mu] oc-curs, as expected. 106 Cf. D.E.

Some lines further on, after a dividing line that separates the text, EM:T 6 (= Emar 6/3 378) lists the deities of the palace (very broken) and various (local) dedications of a number of deities, includ-ing 'Dagan of the name' (line: 17: Dagan zikri) and 'Dagan lord of Miš1ā' (line 24: Dagan bēl Mišlā). The other lists of sacrifices do not correspond to a hierarchical sequence like EM:T 6. Emar 379 is a list of deities, without specifying whether it really is a list of sacrifices since there is no indication of the kind of offer-ings. The common denominator of the list is the geographical zone of the deities, on the last line of the text there is a reference to the 'gods of the high cities' (dingir-meš uru-m[e]š a η -1 a), so it is a list of local deities. Texts 379 to 382 are clearly connected and, since most of the deities are repeated in each of the lists, the difference lies in the type of offering, in text 380 birds (m u š e n) are offered, and in 381 lambs (u d u).

Inventory of cultic material One administrative text related to the cult lists a series of cups108 of various deities: Dagan has two frizzibu-cups,109 two fjubu-cups (Dagan of Tut-tul),1 10 one frizzibu-cup (lord of the camp)111 and two bizzibu-cups (lord of the riverbank ).'12 The text does not seems to exhibit any hierarchy in list-ing the deities or the number of cups. On the other hand, line 20' refers to the city of Tuttul, but unfortunately, the text is very broken and cannot know whether this material was connected with that city.113 5.1.5. Cult personnel connected with Dagan There are three zābi[ju-priests of Dagan: one called Ellatl-Dagan114 and two of unknown name, one of whom we know a zabifru of Dagan of Tabniya115 and another simply a zabifru of Dagan.116 In the first text the zābibūs of the Storm-god and of Ninurta also occur. Possibly, the zäbifju priest was in charge of the ritual sacrifice of the animals given the relationship with root lz-b-hl 'to sacrifice'.117 There is also a priest (I ú - s a n g a) of Dagan called Abi-bamm! in two ration lists,118 another priest (s a n g a) of Dagan called Tuku-Ebursag119 and the son of a priest of Dagan in a list of witnesses.120 5.1.6. Curses in the administrative texts Apart from the purely cultic texts, in some cases the texts from Emar and the surrounding region include a curse against breaking the oath sworn in a contract.

In fact, the model is very similar to the one we have already seen in studying the oaths in the texts from Mari where Dagan occurs repeatedly with Itūr-Mēr, the local god of the city of Mari.132 This is one more proof of the importance Dagan had as head of the pantheon in the Middle Euphrates region during the Late Bronze Age and a sign of continu-ity with the data from Mari and Terqa. Leaving aside the curse formulae, there is some evidence of the adminis-trative tasks performed in the temple of Dagan in Emar or in one of the neighbouring cities, fortunately a document has been preserved that corre-sponds to a loan of metal which refers to a deliver of some specific material for the palace to the temple of Dagan. Since the text was not found in con-text we do not know from which particular site it came and therefore we do not know which temple of Dagan it is, even though it is a text from Emar or one of the surrounding cities. EM:T 15 He who was sealed by the palace has been delivered to the temple of Da-gan.133 5.1.7. The seal of Ninurta What is known as the 'seal of Ninurta' occurs basically in sales of real-estate by Ninurta and the elders of the city who represented the 'citizen' power of Emar.134 Unlike the 'dynastic seal' the seal of Ninurta has the following legend: a pair that often occurs in the documents from Ekalte (cf. EK:T 2). However, the copy does not seem to show this divine pair with certainty. If we do read Dagan in line 35 of the text, it would be without the divine determinative, something that never happens in any of the other writings of Dagan, who occurs on the same tablet in various personal names (cf. lines 18, 37, 38, 39 and 42); on the other hand, in all these occurrences, the sign DA is written in the standard way and very accurately, whereas the supposed DA of line 35 is very doubtful (following the copy of the text). All this indicates a possible alternative such as: dI[M] u d7[u t ]u?. However, the text is very damaged. 131 For Ninurta as patron god of the city of Emar cf. D.

The epithets of Dagan 5.1.9.1. Lord of the offspring The epithet dk u r en bu-ka-ri occurs in the texts from Emar in the zukru-festival158 and also in a hierarchical list of deities.159 The term bu-ka-ri always occurs in connection with the god Dagan, the principal god of the zwfcru-festival, and the first god to be mentioned in the hierarchical list. Basically, this epithet has been interpreted in two different ways. D. ARNAUD connected the term with Semitic bqr 'cattle'.'60 D.E. FLEMING proposed a new interpretation of the term in connection with the word bu-kru, which in Semitic denotes the firstborn son or, more generally, son, offspring. It occurs in Ebla, and in Akkadian, Hebrew, Arabic and Ethio-pie.161 In all his translations D.E. FLEMING translates bukāru as 'First-born', following, in this way the tradition of west Semitic and also of Akkadian, according to W. VON SODEN.162 Nevertheless, as is pointed out in CAD, it seems that the Akkadian has a wider use of the term, since in many cases it is used to denote 'offspring' as a collective, without expressly mentioning the firstborn son. This case is particularly common in references to divine offspring, chiefly in literary texts.163 According to this interpretation of the term as 'son' or 'offspring' we may reinterpret the bukāru of the Emar zukru festival as a reference to the sons, the god's own offspring; Dagan would be 'The lord of the offspring'. In this way his role as father god of the pantheon of the Middle Euphrates region would be confirmed. In the zukru-festival Dagan is also called 'the lord creator' and 'the very father'.164 5.1.9.2. The lord creator The title 'Lord creator' (Bēlu qúni)[65 occurs in the zukru-festival and in three lists of sacrifices,166 there is no other god in the texts from Emar who 158 Emar 6/3 373 9 passim = D.E: FLEMING, TE 234 line 12; 374 20'. 159 Emar 6/3 378 1-2. 160 Cf.

This argument is"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"shares this epithet with him. This title has a clear parallel with the classic epithet of El that occurs on several west Semitic inscriptions167 and in the Bible,168 in this way it confirms Dagan as a 'generator' god, as we have already seen in the epithets 'Lord of the offspring', or 'the very father'.169 5.1.9.3. The very father It occurs only once (Abuma), in the zukru-ritual, in fact.170 This epithet confirms Dagan's role as father-begetter of the pantheon of the Middle Eu-phrates region. It already occurs with a similar epithet in Mari171 and it occurs in the curse of a royal inscription from Aleppo;172 this evidence from Aleppo is quite important as it strengthens the tradition in the texts from Ugarit of identifying Dagan as father of Bacl-Addu in the city in which was the main cult centre of the Storm-god. We may infer that this father-son relationship between Dagan and the Storm-god probably already existed in the Middle Euphrates region in the Old Babylonian period, especially as Dagan was The Father, in capital letters. 5.1.9.4. Lord of the valley This dedication (bel amqi173) occurs in the zwÄru-festival in two offering lists and in the fo'ssM-festival.174 This epithet refers to Dagan's principal dominion as lord of the valley of the Euphrates, there is no parallel for this epithet in conection with any other deity. We have already proved that Da-gan is intimately connected with the Middle Euphrates region and princi-pally with the cities that lie on its bank(s), most of which have a temple or show a preference for Dagan, the title 'Lord of the valley' only strengthens this portrait of lord and master of the Middle Euphrates region and its peo-ple.175 neutralised if we interpret the term as a participle (pāris), with the shift from ā>ā that has already been noticed in the texts from Emar (cf.

The option proposed by A. TSUKIMOTO207 is more sensible, as he connects gi-na-ti with garden, orchard,208 with the feminine ending t, as in Dagan of ru-ujj-lja-te.

Dagan's consort in Emar If we except the hierarchical list EM:T 6 (Emar 378), where Ninlil occurs alongside Dagan lord of the offspring, the texts from Emar and its neigh-bourhood make no explicit reference to a consort of Dagan. It is quite clear that, in the hierarchical list, Ninlil is attested as Dagan's consort; the equa-tion is very simple since Ninlil is one of the traditional consorts of Enlil, the god with whom Dagan was already identified in the third millen-nium.223 However, there is no other reference to Ninlil in the texts from Emar (if we except the 'Weidner list' of deities224); all this suggests, how-ever, that Dagan's consort is concealed behind one of the goddesses of the Emar pantheon.

As we saw above (cf. above chapter 3 n. 83) this connection between both deities is probably due to their Syrian origin, which led the Babylonian theologians to a pairing that is not attested in Syrian sources al-though it would explain the later inclusion of Išbara in the circle of Enlil and Dagan in the Babylonian list An =Anum, (Cf. R.L. LITKE, AN 43f.) where the connection with Dagan is not specified; nevertheless Išbara occurs there earlier on, equated with Nissaba (R.L. LITKE, AN 55: 301 [DÙ-DÙ] and 146) and recurs in the fourth tablet of the series An =Anum (R.L. LITKE, AN 166; cf. also D. PRECHEL, Išbara I70f.). On the other hand, a husband of Išbara is not known for certain, the only comparable fact is in the series An =Anum where Šaggar and A1mānu appear as husbands of the goddess (cf. R.L.

FLEMING also refers to the possible etymology of Išbara based on Semitic *sār 'grain, barley' proposed by T. JACOBSEN (HSS 42 253 n. 209; Fs. Moran 237 n. 9; see also D.R.

Ninkur already occurs in a text from Mari of the pre-Sargonic period receiving an offering of 40 s i k i 1 breads, inmediately before Lugal Terqa (= Dagan).227 The texts from Old Babylonian Mari record a goddess called Ba'alta-mâtim connected with Emar, and it is possible that it is the indigenous reading of dni η -k u r.228 As for the texts from Emar, a name of a month in the Emar calen-dar bears the name of the goddess Ninkur.229 A street of the city bears her name.230 The goddess and her temple have a prominent role in the en-thronement of the priestess n i η - d i n g i r,231 and priests of Ninkur are mentioned in the texts from Emar.232 She is one of the protagonist deities in the kissu rituals, where she has a special relationship with Dagan. In the ritual of the dar-ú-ri he receives various offerings233 and in a monthly litur-gical calendar there is a a-bi-i of Ninkur.234 In the zukru-festival she re-ceives various offerings of food, beverages and animals235 and she also occurs in various lists of sacrifices. As for the epithets shown by Ninkur in Emar, is the 'Lady of the brook';236 'Lady of the circle'.237 The epithet 'lady of the quiver'238 is what connects her more obviously with Dagan, as they share the same epithet and appear together in the zukru-festival. Every-thing seems to suggest, then, that Ninkur was Dagan's consort in Emar.239 The goddess of the same name from Babylonia does not occur very often in the south. In the Sumerian myth of Enki and Ninbursag she occurs as the daughter of Enki and Ninnisiga and the mother of Ninimma or of the spin-ning goddess Uttu according to the manuscript.240 Ninkur's role in this This etymology of Išbara is dubious; there is no epithet of the goddess that gives her an agri-cultural character (cf. D. PRECHEL, Išbara 185f.), on the other hand, and strictly from the etymological point of view, if the b of the divine name represents an c, why is it written ušljr(y) in Ugarit and not *us r(y)1 Accordingly, all this suggests that the pairing of Dagan and Išbara did not exist in the homeland of both deities and we cannot claim to see this goddess as Dagan's consort in Emar and the neighbouring region. 227 Cf.

It is clear that this goddess Ninkur forms part of Enlil's genealogy; in spite of the distance in space and time from the list Kn=Anum,24t it could ex-plain the reference to Ninkur for writing the name of Dagan's consort in Emar, in view of the well-attested equivalence between Dagan and Enlil that has existed since the third millennium. On the other hand, in the same list An=Anum Ninkur occurs as Uttus's 'wife' (dam-bi), adopting to some extent the tradition of the Myth 'Enki and Ninbursag'.247 There are, then, two references to Ninkur in An-Anum, the first is a goddess who belongs to the genealogy of Enlil, essentially based on the etymology of the names of 3/3 374f.; cf. also D.O.

In spite of everything, this difference is of little relevance when we refer to the Ninkur of Emar. Having explained Ninkur's role as Dagan's consort in Emar, it is now necessary to determine which deity lies behind this learned and Babylonian-style writing used by the scribes of the upper Middle Euphrates during the late Bronze Age. There is no definite fact that tells us who the goddess Ninkur really is; as Dagan clearly lies behind the writing dk u r, the case of Ninkur, together with other divine names from Emar, such as Ninurta, is different and therefore we have to move in the realm of hypothesis, without bringing any conclusive textual data that could ensure the correct reading. If we accept that Dagan's traditional consort in the third millennium and in the Old Babylonian period was the goddess Ša1aš, there is nothing to prevent us thinking differently during the Late Bronze Age, especially considering that, surprisingly, the goddess Salas practically never occurs in the whole textual corpus from Emar and its neighbouring cities, if we except one occurrence in a fragment of the Anatolian rituals where she is receiving offerings of flocks;248 the fact that these rituals may have been translations of originals written in Hittite would explain the syllabic writing of the goddess's name.249 The colophon of a lexical text could have given us the key to knowing the husband of Salas in Emar, unfortunately, however, the broken condition of the text does not permit any firm conclusion to be made. The colophon mentions a series of divine couples, all with a Babylonian flavour. It lists Nabu, Nissaba, Marduk, Zarpānītum, Ea, Damkina, Sîn, Šamaš and lastly, in all probability, the goddess Salas appears, but unfortunately the text does not preserve her companion. D. ARNAUD reconstructs dk u r in his edition of the text, but with reservations, indicating that the presence of dIM is also possible.250 Fate seems to be against us since another colophon of a divination text mentions Dagan and a deity that has not been preserved.251 Other indications, completely circumstantial, may indicate that possibly we are on the right road. The proper writing dn i η - k u r, apart from an evident relation with the writing dk u r, may also be connected with dn i η - h u r -sag —very probably a Sumerogram for Ša1aš in Mari— given that the Sumerian words k u r and h u r - s a g could be considered, in part, as synonyms.252 If that were so, we could consider that in Emar Ninkur is nothing other than a variant of well known Ninjjursag of Mari; that would suppose a continuity in the religious tradition of Dagan and his consort in the valley of the Middle Euphrates. 248 Emar 6/3 480 3'. 249 Cf.

The writing e n-^da-ganfk u r poses problems of reading; the sign EN, read bēlu in clas-sical Akk., also has the reading WS baclum in Emar, as shown by hieroglyphic Hittite seals (cf. E.LAROCHE, Akk 22 10 nr. 14 and 15). In this case the ambiguity of the writing, both in cuneiform and in Hittite, does not allow a certain reading, on this cf. W. MAYER, MDOG 118 (1986) 129. What does seem clear is the lack of the Is' pers. sing, possessive suffix I in some of the cuneiform versions of this name, given that they occur in some of the transcriptions in hieroglyphic Hittite (cf.

J.-M. DURAND (NABU 1989/112 88; RA 84 (1990) 61) translates 'Dagan - seigneur des Prophètes - a appelè/crié/convoqué' against D. ARNAUD (Emar 6/3 152 n.l) who prefers to read dda-gan-be-el-na-pí-il-sí, relating it to a 'non-classical' form of palāsu Ν 4 ('(freundlich) anblicken' AHw 814). On the other hand, F.M. FALES (FS. Garelli 84 n.22) connects the name with napištu and bēl napišti (cf. CAD N/1 300 and 304). DURAND translates nabû as prophets, based on a meaning found in Mari but not in Emar, even so, his solution seems the safest. 272 Emar: dda-gan-e n: Emar 6: 52,33; 143,[6]; 144,4; 150,37; 156,8,17,24,27; AuOr 5/17:29.

In Mari, there was a large number of texts that referred to regions far from the Middle Euphrates, and thus it was interesting to be able to know where the bearers of the various names came from, and to see what were the various areas of influence of each deity. However, in Emar the situation is very different. The archives are very restricted and private in character and as a result the persons who appear there are mostly from the environs of Emar. Thus, we do not have a mosaic of cities far from Emar but a portrait of the city and the small neighbouring villages.409 What we may infer from the data from the onomasticon in Emar and its neighbouring cities is that Dagan also has a central position in the onomasticon of this period in the upper Middle Euphrates, since he is the deity most invoked in the names available to us. After Dagan, the second most attested deity is the Storm-god, followed by Nergal/Rasap and Sîn.410 As for specific names with Dagan, there is a continuity in the onomastic tradition of Mari. There is a strong preponderance of the west Semitic element and, what is new, an increasing number of names with Hurrian elements.411 reading dimrum of the sign LI in Emar cf. the hieroglyphic Hittite seals in H.

Ugarit The city of Ugarit, on the Mediterranean coast in present day Rās Samra (Syria) some fifty kilometres south of the mouth of the Orontes, has been the coastal site that has provided a huge number of texts of the most varied kinds, since not only were texts in syllabic cuneiform unearthed there but documents were also found in a local cuneiform alphabet.412 This varied documentation has enabled us to see the cosmopolitan character of the city in which there was basically a population that largely spoke the local lan-guage (Ugaritic) and an important Hurrian-speaking population and yet, alongside these two languages, they also wrote in Akkadian, the lingua franca of the time. As for genres, there are all types of texts, from adminis-trative documents to literary texts, including rituals, and legal, school, lexical texts, etc. All this documentation dates to the Late Bronze Age, during the closing stages of the XIV century and the first quarter of the ΧΠ century.413 Of course, the texts that will occupy our attention in this section will chiefly be the literary texts and the rituals, in which there is the basic information for knowing the religion of Ugarit in the Middle Babylonian period. Even so, some information can be found in the other texts, espe-cially in connection with the onomasticon. 5.2.1. The literary texts The very extensive literature from Ugarit,414 that describe the lives of the gods and heroes in a series of myths and epics, have been fundamental for the study of the religion, not only of Ugarit, but of the whole of Syria. It would be deceptive if we claim to find in it the role and character of a god as important and famous as Dagan was in Syria in the Bronze Age. Since the discovery of the texts and their decipherment, the absence of Dagan in an active role in the myths, legends and epics of Ugarit has been a matter that has not gone unnoticed by most scholars. In spite of everything, Dagan occurs obliquely in the literary texts of Ugarit. Two of the epithets of Bacl415 are bn dgn 'son of Dagan'416 and htk dgn 'lineage of Dagan'.417 Dagan, then, occurs in them in a secondary way, without having any role in or influence on the events narrated in the literary texts. This explicit absence of the deity who performs no actions, shows the 'secondary' or 'marginal' role that Dagan had in Ugarit. Nevertheless, this is the only explicit men-412 For the history of discovery cf. G. DEL OLMO LETE, MLC 23f.; MLR 13f. 413 Cf. W.

Ν. WYATT has made a very daring suggestion in re-interpreting the epi-thets of Bacl in a completely different way. On the basis of an etymology for Dagan related to Arab, dagana, 'to be cloudy, rainy', he gives the god the character of a weather-god. Forcing the meaning of bn beyond that of family relationships, he decides to translate bn dgn as 'the rainy one'; in this way, according to WYATT, Bacl and Dagan would be two hypostases of the same deity, the Storm-god.418 On the other hand, and in an attempt at squaring the circle, N. WYATT, also re-interprets the term htk as 'to rule, hold sway, dominion'419 and, as a result, translates htk dgn as 'Lord of the rain' in parallel with the known epithet of Bacl rkb crpt 'rider of the clouds'. The circle, then, is closed and the troublesome 'double' sonship of Bacl, (traditional son of El and bn/htk dgn) is resolved. This suggestion by N. WYATT has been questioned by several scholars,420 and recently, N. WYATT himself has changed the translation that he had proposed, but with-out surrendering the spirit of his hypothesis, continuing to identify Dagan and Bacl as two weather gods.421 N. WYATT's argumentation has its weak points in the a priori nature of his theory; if the etymology of Dagan has no connection with Arab, dagana the rest of the hypothesis would no longer be tenable; Dagan would lose his weather character and his equivalence with Bacl would be deprived of mean-ing. In fact, the etymological relationship of Dagan with Arab, dagana is difficult to prove.422 On the other hand, even accepting the a priori nature of the etymology of Dagan proposed by N. WYATT, we hit new reefs; if Bacl and Dagan are two hypostases of the same deity, it is difficult to ex-plain his appearance separately in the many cultic texts from Ugarit, where both gods receive offerings separately.423 The other argument that N. WYATT brandishes to confirm his hypothesis is the difficulty of reconciling BaTs double sonship, as son of El and of Dagan. Here WYATT errs by an excessively 'rationalist' attitude that sometimes is not appropriate for relig-ious phenomena. Evidently, an historicising explanation is possible, how-ever, the theological fact exists and co-exists without great contradictions among the faithful. Nevertheless, an explanation of a double filiation of Bacl is possible on the basis of the identification of Dagan with El produced by 418 Cf. Ν.

They are two 'com-parable' but not 'assimilated' gods. We shall come back to this topic in the final chapter. 5.2.2. The ritual and liturgical texts The texts from cultic practice425 are the complement necessary to confirm or reject the portrait given in the literary texts which, whether we like it or not, arouse more interest among scholars. The ritual texts correspond to daily practice and document for us the real cult. Accordingly, they comprise more reliable evidence for reconstructing day to day religion and so enable us to determine the role of each deity. Conversely, as against the 'clarity' of liter-ary narrative, the texts from cultic praxis answer a practical need that, some-times, does not require an explicit description of all the ritual acts. Generally, they are guidelines or checks of what must be done or has been done. The function of the ritual texts is to prescribe/describe the cultic act to which they refer; they have a directive and executive function; they specify and set out the content and the protagonists, both the actors and the recipi-ents.426 As for Dagan's appearance and his role in this type of text, the contrast with the literary texts is noteworthy. In the literary texts he has no role at all, whereas in the texts from cultic practice, Dagan occurs quite frequently, even though he is by no means one of the most cited gods in this type of text. Dagan occurs basically in the 'pure complex ritual sacrifices'.427 These texts record the ritual actions in a (particular) month, the various places of celebration or the various types of offering or sacrifice: UG:T 1 Two lambs and one bull to ..., [to DN], [...] one lamb, El one lamb, Bacl one lamb, Dagan one Iamb, [... cAt]tar and Attapil ' one cow, Sapān one ewe.428 424 In the words of N. WYATT, the first to cut the Gordion Knot was J. FONTENROSE, (Oriens 10 [1957] 277f.) by identifying Dagan with El; afterwards, G. DEL OLMO LETE, proposed identifying both gods on the basis of the identification/fusion of two pantheons, Canaanite and Amorite, cf. MLC 69f.; CR 74; MROA 2/2 71; CCC 82; MLR 23; H. NlEHR, RIU 30 and 47. Cf. also the proposal of J.C. DE MOOR, who sees Bacl as a newcomer, the son of Dagan ofTuttul and son-in-law of El, ARTU 195 n. 19; RY71.D. SCHWEMER (Wettergott 544) proposed the fusion of Dagan in El, with the result that Dagan disappeared from the myths. 425 Cf. principal editions in P. XELLA, TRU 1; A. CAQUOT - J.-M.

After indicating the offerings to the Hero (f ) and to the god of the house, a communion sacrifice (šlmm) is offered.429 The following text corresponds to another ritual related to the lunar cy-cle, in this case the full moon (ym mlat). During this ceremony, animals were sacrificed to various deities, in this case the text records the place where the sacrifices were performed and explicitly mentions the king as principal officiant of the ceremony. After sacrificing in an unspecified place, holocausts (šrp)4i0 are burnt in the temple of Bacl to Ilib, El, Bacl, cAnat of Sapān and Pidray, afterwards, in communion sacrifice, Ilib, Bacl of Ugarit, Ba°l of Aleppo, Yaraft, cAnat of Sapān, Pidray and Dadmiš receive offer-ings. Immediately afterwards, the text is as follows: UG:T2 And to the urbt, Ilib, one lamb; Bacl one bull and one lamb; Dagan one lamb; the helper gods, one lamb; Bacl, one lamb; cAnat, one lamb; Rašap, one lamb, in communion sacrifice ,431 We know very little about the urbt,432 a cult installation with no parallel. It seems to be some kind of window, a sort of small sanctuary necessary in the temple. Another multiple ritual prescription is KTU 1.162, a ritual published re-cently, that describes the sacrifices to the 'gods of the country' (il bldn). The first part of the text refers to 'the offering of the shield';433 afterwards lambs are sacrificed to Ilib in holocaust, and then: UG:T 3 Two oxen and two lambs to Ilib; to El one lamb; to Bacl one lamb; to Da-gan one lamb, to Yarah one lamb, to Yam one lamb.434 There follow the helper gods of Bacl, BaM, °Anat, Atirat',435 the family of El, the assembly of Bacl on Sapān.

A litany, possibly to be recited in a ritual, with the intention of universal invocation, tries to include all the deities of the pantheon: UG:T6 Hail father and gods!

Both texts are incantations against the bite of a snake and in the two incantations, Hôrân is the principal protagonist and hero, while the other deities, including Dagan, have the role of simple ex-tras, since none of them solves the problem until the arrival of Hôrân.

There is, then, in these texts, the intention to be complete. The order of the deities is clearly hierarchical: the first to be cited is Ilib, the father-god/ancestor, understood as 'god of the father' related to family relig-ion454 or to the prototype ancestor of the gods, in effect, the ancestor of El.455 The following deity is El, as head of the pantheon and father of the gods.456 El follows Dagan, before Bacl, which is explained by the father-son relationship between both deities and by the more than likely identifica-tion between El and Dagan. These lists emphasise his privileged position within the pantheon of Ugarit, in spite of his lack of an active role in the myths and his rare presence in the ritual texts.

DUSSAUD,466 and later they have been studied by several scholars with some important differences in the interpretation and reading of the steles.467 Recently, however, it seems that a certain consensus has been reached: UG:T 16 Stele that Tarryelli offered to Dagan: a /?gr-sacrifice, and one ox for eat-ing.468 UG:T 17 The pgr-sacrifice that cUzzinu offered to Dagan, his lord, and one work-ox.469 These steles prove that Dagan continued to be the recipient of the pgr-sacrifices, well attested in Mari of Old Babylonian period, sacrifices that gave the god Dagan the title of bel pagre. We have already seen above, in speaking of this sacrifice in Mari, how some scholars have cast doubts on the funerary nature of this liturgical act.470 The documentation from Mari and in particular the pagrâ'um that was celebrated in the court of Aleppo during the mourning for the dead king confirm its funerary character.471 Nothing prevents us considering that a similar situation applied to Ugarit during the Middle Babylonian period. The fact of erecting some inscribed steles commemorating the sacrifice indicates the 'memorable' nature of the event.472 With the steles the death of the king was commemorated as well Šassūrātum and various mother godddesses (Nintu; Bē1et-i1ī, never explicitly with Ninmah, cf. references in CAD Š/2 146). 465 Cf. bibliography in H.

However, it is difficult to specify his career or whether he belonged to the royal family or not.475 The presence of Dagan in this celebration confirms his image as an ances-tral god and father of the pantheon, this relation with the pagrā 'um and his funerary character is not a reason in favour of his infernal character.

There are serious doubts about the connection of the steles offered to Dagan with a temple consecrated to him and the possible occurrences of the sanctuary in the texts, once analysed, result in nothing. What, then, is the temple associated with the two steles dedicated to Dagan? The temple of El is mentioned in three ritual texts and two mythological texts,487 so it is logical that this temple belongs to the principal god of the pantheon of Ugarit, that is to say: El. Nevertheless, it is possible that Dagan had some kind of sanctuary or cultic space within the temple of El, as 'guest compan-ion' deity or simply on the basis of the identification between both dei-ties.488 5.2.4.

In this way may appreciate how Dagan was now very far from the lead posi-tion he had retained in the Middle Euphrates region, where he was the god most invoked in the onomasticon. In Ugarit, the god that occurs most often is Bacl, way ahead of the other deities.491 5.3. Mari In spite of the destruction of the local dynasty of Mari and its disappearance without trace at the hands of yammurapi of Babylon, it seems that during the Late Bronze Age there still remained some remnant of the population that retained the name of the 'land of Mari' for its territory. It is not certain, however, that it was exactly the same as the Mari of Zimri-Llm, and it is possible that it refers to a small territory in the lower yābūr region or the Sujium region.492 A letter found in Ugarit possibly comes from this Mari that continued to maintain the religious tradition of its predecessor. The greeting formula of the letter is as follows: UG:T 19 May Addu, Dagan and Itūr-Mēr', the great gods of the land of Mari, protect the life of my lord.493 The three gods correspond to an ancient tradition of the Middle Euphrates region: ItQr-Mēr494 as polyadic god of Mari and Dagan as head of the pan-theon of the Middle Euphrates region. In this case, however, Addu occurs in first position, unlike in the texts from Old Babylonian Mari, where the order was always Dagan-Addu. Had Addu's prominence as head of the pan-theon already occurred in the Late Bronze Age, in the Mari region? Possibly the Storm-god had already 'supplanted' his father and had become the prin-cipal god of the region. Unfortunately, we do not have enough evidence to prove this. 5.4.

Dagan in Egyptian sources The archives found in the Egyptian town of A^etaton (modern Al-cAmarna) only have one reference to Dagan in a single name: This person possibly wrote from some region within Syria, in the border region of Egyptian rule.499 In the texts written in hieroglyphic Egyptian there is a single name with Dagan, i.e. cAbdu-Dagan,500 always described as a foreigner (according to the determinative that accompanies his name). It need not be said that a Syrian origin is more than likely, given the use of Dagan in the name. It occurs in sources from the XVIII and XIX dynasties. 5.6. Conclusions During the Late Bronze Age, Dagan continues to be the principal god of the Middle Euphrates region and retains the unequivocal titles 'the very father', 'Lord of the offspring' and 'Lord creator'; in this way there is a clear conti-nuity of his attributes in relation to the epithet of 'Father of the gods' that he had in Old Babylonian Mari. He takes part in the most important rituals of the city of Emar and its environs, the principal ritual of the Emar liturgi-cal calendar is dedicated to him and the most important new moon month of the year is celebrated in his honour. The hierarchical lists of offerings also place him as leader of the pantheon and he is also the most cited in the offerings. In most cases he accompanies the polyadic god of the cities in the curse formulae of the legal texts, as was the case in Mari with Itūr-Mēr, a fact that proves the pre-eminent role of Dagan in these cities. On the other hand, there is a large number of local dedications and various epithets that demonstrates a wide and diversified cult. In popular religion he is the god cited most in personal names, far more often than the other deities.

However, once we leave the bank of the Euphrates, the panorama changes and, the portrait of Dagan becomes less defined and his role more diffuse. In Ugarit, on the Mediterranean coast, Dagan has no active part in the mytho-logical texts, appearing only in the titulary of Bacl as his father. The texts connected with the liturgy give Dagan a 'low' profile where he has a notice-able but modest presence. In the hierarchical lists, however, his importance is shown from his position in the 'upper' section of the scale, connected with El, with whom he was identifed, and with Bacl, whose father he was. His presence in the pgr-sacrifices creates a direct link with the pagrä'um-sacrifices of Mari and with his epithet as 'Lord of the pagrā w/w-offerings'. There is, then, continuity in one of his most significant attributes from the Old Babylonian period, as the principal god in the funereal mourning for the dead king. In spite of everything, his presence in the popular cult was very limited, given the meagre occurrences in the onomastic material from Uga-rit. We can say little about the other sites in or related to Syria in this pe-riod since, both in Alalab and in Abetaton, Dagan only occurs in the onomasticon and then not very often, which proves that he was barely estab-lished outside the valley of the Euphrates given that in these regions the weight and importance of El and the Storm-god excluded every other foreign deity."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"THE CHARACTER OF DAGAN It is a risky matter to approach the character of Dagan from a diachronic point of view but it remains unavoidable. Ultimately, the spirit and objec-tive of this book —after a series of necessary and unavoidable synchronic studies— is to be able to provide the most coherent portrait possible of the god in accordance with the data available to us. This objective is not easy, given that the laconic nature of most of the textual evidence does not pro-vide well-defined data for drawing a clear profile with no part, aspect or detail left blurred. Nevertheless, it is possible to define the essential charac-ter of the god and also, according to our criterion, to refine the somewhat rough sketch that is the only result of previous studies, as well as discarding some of the features erroneously ascribed to him. 6.1. Etymology and origin When we use the word 'etymology' in connection with the name of a deity, in fact we are not searching for the absolute origin of the word and its con-nection with others that preceded it,1 but instead are simply attempting to determine the meaning of the word. To some extent we claim, often in vain, to squeeze the signifiant in order to extract a distillate: the meaning. In this, naively, we count on finding the very essence of the god; we hope that the name follows a sort of pellet in which the substance of the god lies, in short: the god on a small scale. However, in many instances this hope col-lides with an intractable fact: the relationship between the divine name and its attributes is, if not contradictory, at least distinct. As for the 'etymologi-cal' research into 'Semitic' deities, the examples of Istar, Is^ara or Marduk are paradigmatic in this respect; the various etymologies that have been proposed for the names of these deities either do not fit the god's profile very well or are simply unknown (to the despair of most scholars). So, given that it is not possible to speak of the 'literal' meaning of 'Semitic' deities, that is given to many Sumerian deities, a meaning that also does not coincide with the profile and main attributes of the deities in question, the cases of Enlil, Enki and Inanna are the most obvious.2 All the same, the research undertaken by scholars regarding the original meaning of divine names is justified because at times there is 'success', that is, there is total and agreement between profile and 'etymology'. On other ocasions, this success is partial, given that the profile of the deity has previously been well defined by the textual evidence and its context, when research on the ety-mology is already 'unidirectional', in this way the 'missile' that a scholar 1 Cf. A. ZAMBONI, La etimologia, Madrid 1988, 9. 2 Cf. P. MICHALOWSKI, RAI 43 239f. (about Enlil)."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"launches already has some coordinates and clear objectives it is an 'intelli-gent etymology' given that it already has a pre-set and definite target. In this case, the merit of scholars lies in the selection —within the extensive lexical resources at their command— of specific objective, but which is no longer blind research. A very illuminating case in this regard is the case of the god Addu: the profile of this god was already clearly the weather, well described by scholars,3 that could be rounded off by finding for him an etymology that would fit his attributes.4 Gods that are etymologically transparent, such as Šamaš or Yara{i, who have a clear profile and a clear 'etymology' and in direct relationship are no less of a problem. The main problem lies in deities that have a 'low profile', that is to say, 'unexplained deities', who do not appear in the myths and have no explicit attributes in the texts. In such cases, 'to understand' the name and interpret it correctly becomes one of the main and pressing tasks of experts, even though experience shows that it is not a secure and definitive element in the personality of the god. Dagan belongs to this last set, and his etymology is one of the most delicate and controversial themes in studies concerning him, yet on the other hand, it is crucial, given that it is closely linked with the character and profile that scholars have attributed to him. Dagan belongs to this group of 'unexplained' deities that need a 'discoverer' to illuminate them and make them visible for the other scholars who have tried in vain to obtain a clear image of his profile.5 This desire, almost an obligation, to find a likely and credible meaning for the name has led some to a 'desperate' search for the light and others to accept and follow ('blindly') some of the proposals. Philo of Byblos must be considered the first 'etymologist' of Dagan and as such has also been the most fortunate and the one with the most follow-ers right up to the present day. Philo is cited in the Preparatio evangelica by Eusebius of Caesarea as the translator of a Greek text written in Phoeni-cian by a certain Sanchuniaton, a writer who, according to Philo, lived before the war of Troy.6 In this work, Philo describes Dagon as the grain,7 the discoverer of grain and ploughing.8 In this way Dagan takes on an agrar-ian character, as a god closely connected with agriculture and, as a result, with the fertility of the land. Even though Philo of Byblos does not make an explicit comment it is quite clear that he relates the name of the god with 3 Cf. H. SCHLOBIES, MAOG 1/3 (1925) 4f.; E. EßELING, RIA 1 22f.; É.

SINGER supports this connection with the character of Dagan as god of the land and of fertility.17 Other etymologies have been proposed, such as deriving Dagan from Sumerian18 or simply from a pre-Semitic language.19 Recently, J.-M. DURAND has proposed a new etymology for Dagan based on certain proper names from Mari.20 According to him, names such as AN-da-gan-ma or da-ga-am-ma are not to be considered defective spellings for <d)Dagan-ma<lik> but comprise evidence for the divine name being used as a noun. He sug-gests interpreting the term dagan as a Semitic (Amorite) term that entered the Sumerian vocabulary of the Amorite period with the meaning of 'total-ity'. While it is quite certain that there is a Sumerian term, morphologically identical with the name of the god in question, with this meaning,21 it is very questionable that it derives from Semitic, given that there is no Se-mitic isogloss that proves dgn has this meaning.22 To claim that this word is the real etymology of the divine name is more than dubious; otherwise, the intuition of the French scholar (and previously, G. DOSSIN) is on the right road in attempting to find —insofar as it is an 'intelligent' etymol-ogy— an interpretation of the divine name that fits his category as supreme god, the choice of objective, however, is incorrect. Of the hypotheses that we have described, which is the most plausible? If we focus on the information provided by the texts from the Bronze Age, that represent the period and 'central' area of the cult of Dagan, we have to conclude that no etymological proposal of the ones described above is satis-factory. Philo's proposal, which most follow, has no clear reflex in the written texts. There is nothing explicit or implicit that describes Dagan as an agrar-ian god with a close relationship to grain. Only one epithet in a ritual from Emar could support the agrarian thesis; it is the title 'Lord of the seeds' (be-15 Dagan 10. 16 D.R. FRAYNE, BCSMS 25 ( 1993) 40. 17 I. SINGER, Fs.

DOSSIN, (Studia Mariana 49f.) when he considered Lîm as an Amorite translation of the Sumerian divine name Dagan 'god of the totality, universal god'. 22 Cf. DRS 220f."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"^/numun-me Š).23 This epithet occurs only once in all the texts avail-able to us, in a ritual within a clear 'agrarian' context, because there is the sowing of seed by a diviner. Unfortunately, the text is very badly damaged and the context of the ritual is completely unknown. Even so, in Emar Dagan retains a large number of epithets, many of them occurring several times, it would be very easy to accept this single occurrence as proof of the agrarian character of the god. For the same reason, we could consider him as a war-god as he appears in Emar as 'Lord of the quiver'24 and as 'Lord of the camp',25 even so, there is nothing that proves this. The comparison with Kumarbi has also acted a circular argument that again sustains the possible agrarian nature of the two gods. Dagan is consid-ered a priori as a god of grain and as a result the comparison with Kumarbi strengthens the agrarian character of the Hurrian god; all the same it is also possible to find an argument in the opposite direction.26 The only fact that connects Kumarbi with grain is the replacement of that god with the ideo-gram NISSABA (= goddess Halki/Kait) in the Anatolian katulis,27 Later, in the pantheon of Yazilikaya, the deity who, it is supposed must be a repre-sentation of Kumarbi, carries a plant (an ear?) in his hand.28 Even so, these are feeble arguments to ascribe an uni vocal agrarian character to Kumarbi; especially if we remember that, unlike Dagan, the Hurrian god occurs in various literary texts as one of the main protagonists (and so is an 'ex-plained' god), in which in no case and at no time is he described as a god connected with grain or agriculture. Kumarbi is always portrayed as father of the gods, as a supreme god in conflict with Tešup, the Hurrian storm-god, but never as a god of grain.29 The comparison Dagan-Kumarbi cannot be used to strengthen the hypothetical agrarian character of both gods in either of the two directions.30 The epithet that connects Dagan with any kind of ditch or hole (jjarrum) found in Terqa and Emar has been used to emphasise Dagan's agricultural character.31 We have already seen above how this term is difficult to trans-late and interpret since it can refer to a ditch or a simple hole, which could relate it to an underworld aspect. It must be added that the relationship of 23 Emar 6/3 446 = EM:T 18. 24 Cf. above 243 (5.1.9.12.). 25 Cf. above 241 (5.1.9.6.). 26 E. LAROCHE, Ug 5 524; DM 1 224; E.

To summarise, we cannot base the agri-cultural profile of Dagan on this epithet given that it is difficult to interpret, the proposal of a ditch or hole is a tempting translation.32 The existence of personal names in Mari such as Yazrafr-Dagan 'Dagan sows' or Yatta?-Dagan33 'Dagan-plants', is not argument enough to ascribe an agricultural profile to the god. The first name also occurs with Addu and El,34 and as for the second, it only occurs once in the whole onomasticon, the reading is uncertain, since the name can be read Yatbi-Dagan,35 without a clear interpretation, even so.36 From the aspect of iconography, attempts have been made to relate cer-tain gods represented on cylinder seals with Dagan. One basis of this identi-fication is that Dagan is mentioned in the legend on the seal. On the other hand attempts have been made to see in some of these plastic representations the presence of a plough as an agrarian symbol of Dagan.37 There is no doubt that this would be an important argument in favour of Dagan having an agrarian character, but if we look carefully at the material available to us it is difficult to decide whether the object accompanying the god is actually a plough; a simple stick or a lightning are also possible interpretations, aside from the possible presence or not of a representation of Dagan on these seals. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the plough is also a usual symbol of the Storm-god on many seals.38 Another proposal, derived from the traditional agrarian character is to consider Dagan as a god of grain and agriculture with a pre-Semitic origin who gave his name to the west Semitic word dāgān 'grain, wheat'; thus, the word would derive from the god and not the god from the word.39 In spite of having a clear parallel with the case of Ceres and cerealia,40 this reason-ing is based on a circular argument that continues to trust blindly in the character attributed by Philo of Byblos to Dagan.

The possibility suggested by J.-M. DURAND of finding one day the absolute state of the word *dagnum in context with the meaning'(pile of) grain',41 together with others such as *(h)addum ('storm'), seems very unlikely,42 especially if we remember that we are studying an agricultural society of which thousands of written docu-ments have been preserved, a very high percentage of which are economic and administrative texts in which there is continual reference to all kinds of grain and cereals. It is surprising that this occurrence has not yet come to light. Even so, if it did, it would not be sufficient reason for considering Dagan to be a god of grain; in fact this word already occurs with this mean-ing in the alphabetic texts from Ugarit, without it indicating unequivocally an agrarian profile, as we have attempted to prove.43 The etymology related to Arabic dagana is also possible (a priori) but once again we come against the meagre proof for a possible weather(-god) profile, as derived from this etymological proposal, in the textual material from Bronze Age Syria. The first scholar to give Dagan the character of a storm-god was H. SCHMÖKEL44 comparing Addu and Dagan, since both gods appear in various greeting formulae and curses from Terqa, this makes them, according to SCHMÖKEL, comparable and interchangeable. According to SCHMÖKEL, and to clinch the matter, both gods share Salas as wife in Babylonian tradition. The comparison of Dagan with Enlil also points to Dagan being a weather-god and his mention together with Šamaš and Itūr-Mēr in Terqa also strengthens this profile since, according to SCHMÖKEL, Dagan is between Šamaš, the sun-god and Itūr-Mēr, the god of the earth; in this way he would rule in the space that lies in between, that is to say, the air and weather phenomena.45 The arguments of other scholars do not con-tribute anything new, as they are based fundamentally on identification with Enlil, the father-son relationship with Bacl-Addu and the apparent identical wife as the Storm-god.46 The etymology or relationship of Dagan with Indo-European is even more problematic. First we have to (re)cognize the contacts and loans be-tween both language families. In this case it would not be so much a shared term in Indo-European and Semitic (as postulated by I. SINGER47) but of a loan from the former to the latter, since there is no witness in any Semitic 41 This translation is no doubt influenced by one of the etymologies claimed for Kumarbi, cf. V.

DURAND himself made recently recognising how uncertain are the various etymologies that have been proposed so far for Dagan (cf. MARI 8 [1977] 632 η. 435). 44 Η. SCHMÖKEL, Dagan 49f. 45 Η.

The dubious connection of the 1 u g a 1 mātim of Mari or with the dBE KALAM-TIM of Ebla with Dagan has already been discussed above. On the other hand, it is quite clear that the writing k u r of Emar must be related to one of Enlil's epithets ('The Great Mountain') and not with one of Dagan's attributes in connection with 'land'.49 SCHMÖKEL's interpretation is already obsolete in the light of new mate-rial at our disposal. The fact that Dagan and Addu alternate with each other in certain greeting formulae or curses is not sufficient argument to make them equivalent, both gods are central in Syria cult and it is logical that they appear in this context. Nor is it enough that both gods seems to share wives.50 On the other hand, the comparison with Enlil is based more on the role of each god within his (own) pantheon as king of the gods, than on them both having the same profile of 'weather-god'.51 Lastly, the portrait drawn by H. SCHMÖKEL of the patron god of Mari, Itūr-Mēr, as a god of the earth is completely inaccurate in the light of the material from the ar-chives of the metropolis of the mid-Euphrates, that had not yet been discov-ered when the German scholar wrote his treatise. As for the etymology, the etymological relationship with Arabic dagana has been placed in doubt in a convincing way by several scholars, since, according to his opinion, the basic meaning of this root is 'to be dark', with the meaning in connection with the weather a secondary derivation,52 that only occurs in Arabic and is completely unknown in east and west Semitic.53 Thus there is no epithet or attribute that makes Dagan a weather-god, unlike the case of the Storm-god with some epithets, attributes and domains that are transparent, independent of his etymology.54 Having rejected the various proposals for an etymology, it must be rec-ognised that it is difficult to find an acceptable alternative solution. It is surprising that after more than seventy years since the studies by H. SCHMÖKEL and with the thousands of new documents that are available to us it is still difficult to establish a satisfactory etymology and we have to return to the same argument of the German pioneer: to see in the name of the god Dagan a remote origin in some pre-Semitic language spoken in the 48 For a good critique of this hypothesis cf.

As we have seen above, only the transparent cases are 'secure' etymologies, that provide conclusive data when defining the profile of a god, in these cases everything becomes a simple emphasis of what we already know from contextual evidence. To extract a god's origin from his etymology is a difficult task, consider-ing that there are two aspects that are intimately linked with each other. It is evident that, in the same way that most scholars have opted for a Semitic etymology of Dagan, the same scholars, explicitly or implicitly, suppose its origin to be a more or less ancient Semitic population. The debate among experts has, in general, two main axes: on the one hand the supporters of an Amorite or west Semitic origin,58 and on the other hand, those who defend a pre-Amorite origin.59 It is quite clear that the consolidated and widespread presence of Dagan in the territory during the second half of the third millen-nium, and especially, during the Sargon period, advocates a pre-Amorite origin. The difficulty in ascribing a firm etymology related to Semitic leads us to the conclusion that the origin has to be pre-Semitic, in agreement with 55 H.

The use of ethno-linguistic terminology, especially when it is not perfectly defined, may be equivocal, bearing in mind that in this case there could be important differences of interpretation among the various scholars (on this type of terminology cf. D.O. EDZARD, ZA 56 [1964] 149). We prefer, then, to use strictly geographical terms, such as 'pantheon of the hinterland' or 'coastal', that, even if they are somewhat ambiguous in setting geographical limits, are more neutral in their ethnic and linguistic aspects. 59 T.

Evidently, to determine the specific 'ethnic' or linguistic filiation of the original population that worshipped Dagan is very difficult, in fact, with the evidence that we have at our dis-posal today, and we could say that it is impossible. On the other hand, words such as proto-Euphratic, proto-Tigridian or pre-Semitic are only at-tempts to fill a void but in fact contributte little to the discussion. The texts show quite clear that during the Ebla period, the sanctuary of Dagan of Tuttul was already functioning as a cult centre with his consort Ša1aš. It seems that in the third millennium the temple of Tuttul was the most im-portant, as the kings of the Sargon dynasty refer to it explicitly. Even so, the texts from Mari bear witness to the existence of a Lord of Terqa, who, in the light of later texts could be none other than Dagan, with his famous sanctuary in the holy city of the lower course of the mid-Euphrates. This indicates that the cult of the god had already spread through the whole mid-Euphrates, a cult and tradition that would be maintained during the whole second millennium. The situation, then, is already well described and con-solidated almost to the middle of the third millennium, indicating that we have to look for a chronologically remote origin in the region on the bank of the mid-Euphrates. To close by clinching the matter, it must be noted that neither of the two cities that welcome the main sanctuaries principals of Dagan in the Euphrates has a solid Semitic etymology;60 it is possible that the founding and development of both cities are intimately linked with the cult of Dagan, which would strengthen this 'pre-Semitic' origin or the 'sub-strate' element of the god.61 All the same, it must be recognised that this is a simple hypothesis difficult to contest, the texts prove that most of the followers of Dagan had Semitic names, like most of the population of Syria in the Bronze Age. For this reason we can label Dagan as a 'Semitic' god, if we understand it to mean a god worshipped largely by a Semitic population or one with Semitic proper names; what we have to question is the Semitic origin of Dagan since, etymologically, it is difficult to ascribe a definite linguistic filiation to him. 6.2. Family The profile of Dagan as father of the gods and a creator god places him, together with his wife Ša1aš, at the top of the generation pyramid of the pantheon of inland Syria. Unfortunately, unlike what happens in the south with the learned the distillations that the Babylonian theologians developed 60 M. BONECHl, RGTC 12/1 119. The proposal made by A. GOETZE (JCS 7 [19531 61 n. 64) of relating Terqa with a Semitic root drq (Akk. zarāqum '(be)sprengen, streuen' AHw 1.515) is tentative, unlike many place-names of the Middle Euphrates, with a clear Semitic etymology, cf. J.-M. DURAND, TPH 114f. 61 A. ARCHI sorts them out and classifies the Semitic deities and those of the substrate; he always calls Dagan a Semitic god, while accepting the difficulty of the linguistic filiation of his name, however he calls him Semitic because, basically he was worshipped in regions of Semitic-speaking peoples (Fs. Alp 8; OBO 129 9). Even so, in the light of the facts available to us, perhaps we have to start thinking of Dagan as also being a substrate god given his remote origin and the difficult etymology of his name and of his wife's name."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"in establishing the supremacy of gods before Anum (cf. e.g. Enuma Elis), no Syrian theogony has been preserved that tells us or lists the ancestors of Dagan and his consort.

Wife There are no explicit references to Dagan's wife in Syrian sources from the Bronze Age, but in spite of that, the textual material from Syria and Baby-lonia allow a convincing hypothesis to be proposed and ascribe a 'stable' consort to the head of the pantheon in the mid-Euphrates. We have already seen how the list Babylonian An =Anum ascribes to Sa1aš the role of Da-gan's wife.62 The Syrian sources are much more ambiguous and equivocal. The oldest reference to a possible consort of Dagan comes from Ebla. There we find an offering to the 'Lord of Tuttul' (=Dagan) and a consignment of silver and gold for the statue of the goddess Ša(1)aša;63 other texts from Ebla seem to indicate that this goddess was paired with the god Wada'an,64 even so, the coupling with Dagan seems evident, especially if we consider the information from the textual material of the second millennium. The fact that there was a goddess who continued to be worshipped in Tuttul, one of the holy cities of the cult of Dagan where king Sargon Akkad prostrated himself before the god, added to the consort having the same name in the list Babylonian An =Anum shows there is little margin for doubt. In the Old Babylonian period, during the reigns of Yaggid-Līm and Yabdun-Līm of Mari, Dagan appears to have a special relationship with the goddess NinJjursag with offerings to the two deities in the respective tem-ples. During the eponym period and in the course of Zimri-LIm's reign, this connection between the two deities continues, without there being an ex-plicit reference to the relationship of consort between the two deities, most of the texts correspond to offerings or consignments of goods for various deities among whom Dagan and Ninbursag are mentioned together on many occasions. There is also a statue of the goddess in Terqa. The texts from the archive of Asqudum also document a special relationship between Dagan and Ninbursag. The basic problem, however, lies in the reading of Ninbur-sag. It is evident that behind this learned and Babylonian-style writing of the scribes from the mid-Euphrates is concealed a local goddess who, in all probability, corresponds to Dagan's consort. The key could be in a text from Aleppo found in Mari, in which there is a reference to a mourning ceremony (idirtum) for the death of Sumu-epub, in this text Dagan occurs accompa-nied by the goddesses tJebat and Sa1aš (Wša-la-as)\\ the presence of the for-mer can be explained as she is the wife of the patron j*od of Aleppo (Addu) and as daughter of Dagan. It is reasonable, then, that Salas occurs in the text 62 Cf. R.L. LITKE, An 43 (I 195). 63 Cf. above EB:T 18; cf. also A. ARCHI, Fs. Houwink ten Cate 2.

Other typically 'southern' writings found in Man may also correspond to Ša1aš, such as Ninlil, Enlil's tradi-tional wife in Babylonia, or Ninkugi, who is equivalent to Ša1aš in the lists An=Anum , An=Anum ša amēli and occurs connected with the god Dagan in the Old Babylonian forerunner of An=Anum (TCL 15 10 II 57-58).66 During the Middle Babylonian period, the texts continue to refrain from explicit mention of Dagan with a goddess and to define them as divine consorts. In spite of this, there are clear indications that the wife of Dagan is concealed behind the writing Ninkur and Ninlil in Emar. Ninlil is evidently one of the traditional wives of Enlil and appears at Dagan's side in a hierar-chical god list from Emar.67 The case of Ninkur is distinct;68 she occurs in various ritual texts, in some of which she has a prominent role. The associa-tion with Dagan was provided in the first place by writing, given that Dagan is written dk u r in Emar and the nighbouring cities. It is logical to conclude that dn i η - k u r continues to be his wife. Both deities share the epithet of 'Lord(Lady) of the Quiver' (bēl(et) išpat), they occur together in the zukru-festival and it is possible that the fc/isw-festival to Dagan celebrates a sacred marriage between both deities. More thorny is the question of knowing which deity lies behind this learned and Babylonizing writing of the god-dess. There is no evidence to confirm it in a conclusive manner, however, in view of the continuity of tradition that appears to stem from the evidence from Ebla and Old Babylonian Mari, it seems sensible to connect Ninkur with Ša1aš. There is no evidence in the documents from the south to support this possibility, however the list An=Anum places a goddess Ninkur in a section that is connected with Enlil's ancestors. On the other hand, and as a hypothesis, it is possible that the scribes of Emar took dn i η - k u r as an equivalent of dn i η - h u r - s a g as the second element of the two divine names may be considered according to some traditions as synonyms. In Ugarit there is very little information about Dagan's wife as the presence of that god is very marginal, especially in the literary texts. Even so, by means of the comparison between Dagan and El it may be conjectured that the character of the consorts of both gods was very similar since the two parallel texts, one written in Akkadian and the other written in Ugaritic could asso-ciate Ninmab/Atirat with El. It is interesting to see how Ninmab is one of the names of the Sumero-Akkadian mother goddess otherwise known as Ninbursag, who, as we have already seen, is the writing used in Mari to denote Dagan's consort. 65 MROA 2/1 136; MARI 8 (1997) 278; LAPO 16 230f. 66 For more information concerning the relationship between Dagan and Ninbursag in this period cf. above 90f. 67 Emar 6/3 378. 68 For an exact quotation from the texts concerning Dagan's consort in Emar cf. above 5.1.10."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"To summarise, the univocal attribution of Salas as Dagan's consort dur-ing the Bronze Age is difficult to prove; the information from Ebla shows the association to be ancient and corroborates the material provided by the list An-Anum. It is more difficult to be precise about the case of Mari, however the evidence of the funerary ritual from Aleppo seems to point in that direction. The information from later periods does not prove continuity, but the fact that Kumarbi, with whom Dagan was identified, has the god-dess Ša1a/uš as his wife69 indicates that we are on the right road and that, as a result, Dagan's wife was Salas during the whole Bronze Age. The character and attributes of this goddess are difficult to determine; even so, the use of the writing Ninbursag in Mari seems to indicate that she should be considered a mother goddess, a fertility goddess, a goddess who creates and engenders, a profile similar to the Sumero-Akkadian mother-goddess or to Atirat/Ašerah of the Mediterranean Levant. The origin of the goddess Ša1aš is uncertain, but it is clear that an etymology through Hurrian must be rejected70 as her presence in the texts from Ebla71 advises against it. She is surely a very ancient goddess (possibly as old as Dagan) with a 'pre-Semitic' etymology. One of the problems that remain unresolved is that Dagan and Adad ap-pear to share a wife.72 For this apparent contradiction various solutions have been proposed by the experts. The most common view has been to deduce a certain equivalence of attributes or identification of the two gods.73 Other scholars have preferred to see an equivalence of the two gods by Babylonian theologians;74 others have left the question as inexplicable, the result of traditions coexisting.75 Sala's relationship with Adad is well attested al-ready in the Old Babylonian period76 and continues afterwards, both in the 69 Cf.

From the Syrian material available to us it can be deduced with some certainty that Dagan had Salas as his consort and for her part, yebat was Addu's wife, at least in Aleppo and possibly in the mid-Euphrates, and so the tradition of inland Syria seems 'stable'. The problem is to be found, then, in the information that comes strictly from Assyria and Babylonia. How is this co-existence of the two traditions to be understood? The god-dess who is Adad's wife is consistently written dša-la in Assyrian and Babylonian texts.78 On the other hand, Dagan's wife occurs already in the texts from Ebla written with a final sibilant,79 and the fact that it already occurred in the third millennium with the form Ša1aš is an indication that this ending with a sibilant cannot be explained as a 'Hittite' form of stan-dard *Sala.80 Later Dagan occurs accompanied by Salas on various cylinder seals of Isin-Larsa and OB.81 In Mari, in the text that describes the rituals for the mourning of Sumu-epub from Aleppo, Ša1aš is written with a final s.82 Also in Mari the onomastic material confirms this hypothesis, the PNN with Ša1aš are written consistently with a final š, in the same way that PNN with Sala appear without the final sibilant in all the variants.83 The only case where two names with Sala and Ša1aš could coincide in a single person is Ša1a-ummī84 and dNinbursagga(=Ša1aš)-w/rz/?jr,85 the first (as A.

It is quite possible from the Kassite period in Babylonia there was some con-tamination of the two deities, basically due to the similarity of their names (as has also happened with some modern scholars). Even so, this contamina-tion only seems to have happened in some learned and theological circles. The contamination, then, is not sufficient argument to try to equate the two goddesses retroactively in earlier periods and even less to assimilate their husbands. To summarise: Dagan's wife in Syria was probably Ša1aš (gener-ally written in Sumerian: Ninbursag in Mari and Ninkur in Emar) but she is not to be confused with Sala, Adad's wife, worshipped chiefly in Babylonia and Assyria.100 We have already spoken above about the husband-and-wife relationship said to exist between Dagan and Išbara.101 The material providing the basis for this hypothesis comes strictly from Babylonia mostly from the period of the third dynasty of Ur. The list An =Anum places the goddess Isbara within the orbit of Enlil, in which Dagan is also inserted, however without making explicit a marriage relationship between the two deities. All this suggests that Isbara has no known husband, even though she has a relationship with various male gods, in various periods and different places.102 The relation-ship with Dagan is basically restricted to texts from the third dynasty of Ur, and in particular, to ceremonies and religious offerings involving members of the royal family, that seems to have a special veneration for certain deities from Syria. It is here that we have to look for the reason for this apparent association. Two foreign deities, from Syria, are 'compared' in Babylonia for reasons of (their) origin and not because of a marriage relationship documented in their respective places of origin, not for their original attrib-utes but for their homeland.103 6.2.2. Sons In the light of Dagan's essential epithets as father of the gods, it seems evident that the main gods of the pantheon of the mid-Euphrates were his sons. There is, however, no explicit reference to a filiation, if we except the 98 KAV 172 III 14: dn i η - m e - d ί m - š a4 KI.MIN (but see the parallels CT 25 20 [K.215+]: dm e - d ί m - š a6 [...]; CT 25 21 9: dm e - d ί m - š a6 MIN), cf.

Even so, there are indications for drawing a portrait of Dagan's two principals sons. What is called the 'pantheon of Mari'104 lists Dagan, The-Lord-of-the-land (Bēl-mātim) and Salas (Ninbursag). If we accept the hypothesis formu-lated by J.-M. DURAND of seeing Lord-of-the-land as a hypostasis of Addu, it seems obvious that there is a 'family' enumeration of the three deities, that is to say, Father, Son and Mother: Dagan, Addu and Ša1aš; in this way we already have evidence for a father-son relationship between Dagan and Addu in the first half of the second millennium. It can also be noted that the weapons of Addu from Aleppo are deposited in the temple of Dagan in Terqa in order to perform the coronation ceremony of the king of Mari and stage the mytheme of the combat between the Storm-god and the god of the sea. In this ceremony Dagan had a passive role, was the host of the cere-mony, in this way, however, he gave it legitimacy as father of the gods and in particular, as father of Addu, the main protagonist of the mytheme.105 This close relationship between Dagan and Addu is evident in the texts from Mari that invoke the gods together,106 this evidence, together with the ma-terial from Ugarit, invite proposing this father-son relationship already in the Old Babylonian period. On the other hand, the text from Mari that describes the lamentation for the death of Sumu-epuJ] of Aleppo mentions the deities Dagan, Ša1aš and tJebat in connection with pagra «m —offerings in honour of the dead per-son—,107 From this set of deities a structure of Father-Mother-Daughter can be deduced; as a result, Addu and yebat, besides being a couple,108 are also siblings, the two children of Dagan and Salas.109 This structure fits well with the structure of the neighbouring pantheons, where the existence of divine couples who are siblings and consorts at once is common. The Syr-ian mythological universe includes some of these pairs of deities that are also present in Babylonia, where the theogonies list series of pairs of sib-ling-consorts.1 10 The hierarchical list of the deities of Emar, after the heading of the text with a mention of the various advocations of Dagan and Ninlil (=Ša1aš), list the consort of the Storm-god and yebat (dIM ù álje-ba-at).111 The en-104 Cf.

FLEMING proposed the pairing in Emar of Bacl and cAttart on the basis of indirect evidence, such as the use of the same typology in certain proper names, the existence of two temples, one for each deity and the possible influence that Emar received from the Mediterranean coastal area.113 Even so, the texts show quite clearly that the official consort of the Storm-god in Emar is Hebat, following, in this way, the tradition that had already come from the third millennium in Ebla and that, in view of the evidence from Mari and Emar, was maintained during the whole second millennium. The fact that there is a pairing between Bacl and LAttart-cAnat in the texts from Ugarit and that this relationship continued in later periods on the coast,114 corroborates the proposal of the existence of two 'Semitic' pantheons in Syria, one headed by Dagan in the interior, with its centre in the region of the mid-Euphrates, and the other on the coast, commanded by El, which we can try to glimpse in Middle Babylonian Ugarit. Even so, there is no conclusive evidence to transfer this relationship between the Storm-god and cAttart to Emar. To summarise, Dagan's principal children are the pair of sibling-consorts Addu and yebat who have as principal cult centre the famous sanctuary of the Storm-god in Aleppo. This does not mean, however, that his cult was restricted to that city, the importance of the cult of Addu and, to a lesser extent of Hebat, grew over the centuries and is present in the whole of Syria, in the same way that the local sanctuaries of Dagan, with centres in Terqa and Tuttul, did not prevent veneration for the god spreading throughout inner Syria to reach as far as the coast where the weight of El put a halt to its introduction.115 6.3. Comparison with other deities The important interchange of ideas and people in the Ancient Near East provoked a process of comparison and syncretism among the various deities who feature in the various pantheons that co-exist in each of the metropo-lises and kingdoms of Syro-Mesopotamia. Dagan was no exception and was put on par with various gods of the neighbouring pantheons that comprised the central belt of his cult. They all have a common denominator, sharing the profile of father of the gods and head of the respective pantheons. Šamaš, so the relationship of consort in the first part of the text is obvious even if not made explicit in the text. 112 Cf. Emar 6/3 369 51-52; D.E. FLEMING, HSS 42 185f. 113 Cf. D.E.

Enlil Of the various equivalences and syncretisms which Dagan underwent, the evidence for the relationship with Sumero-Akkadian Enlil is the most pro-fuse, the oldest and the most explicit. The first indication of this compari-son is in the inscription of Narām-Sîn found in Bāsetkī, in which Enlil of Nippur, Dagan of Tuttul and Ninbursag of Keš are listed; a sequence that reveals the identification of Enlil and Dagan as both gods are cited together and are followed by one the Enlil's traditional consorts (Ninbursag) with Sumero-Akkadian tradition, in this way the structure becomes En-lil(=)Dagan (husband of) Ninbursag; the presence of Dagan in this position cannot be explained any other way.116 The atttributes of both gods were also perceived as similar since both 'pronounce sentence' together with Ištar-Annunltum, patron of the Sargon dynasty.117 This comparison has its roots in Syria, but it is in Babylonia that it is most apparent. The list An=Anum puts the god Dagan in the Enlil section and explicitly equates the gods.118 In the Old Babylonian forerunner of the list An =Anum, Dagan occurs in the circle of Enlil.119 This comparison, however, is already well attested at the end of the third dynasty of Ur. A letter sent by Puzur-Sulgi, the governor of Kazallu, to Ibbī-Sîn120 gives news of the message that Isbi-Erra sent to Kazallu demanding surrender; in the lengthy message he says: Ί have sworn by Dagan my god',121 it should be noted, however, that in one of the manuscripts of the text there is the following variant: '[I have sworn] by Enlil, my god and by Dagan',122 both gods, then, are paired and inter-changed as personal gods of Isbi-Erra, who, we must remember, is called 'man of Mari' in a letter from Ibbī-Sîn to Puzur-Numušda.123 Later, one of the successors of Isbi-Erra in Isin, the king Ur-dukuga, restored the temple é-dúr-ki-gar-raof Dagan in the same city.124 In the commemora-tive inscription of the event, Dagan is called en gal kur-kur-ra 'The august lord of the lands',125 an epithet that has a clear parallel with the 116 Cf. above 44 BAB:T 3. 117 Cf.

Other kings of the house of Isin had personal names with Dagan, such as Iddin-Dagan and Išme-Dagan; to the extent that the latter called himself 'son of Dagan',130 even though in another hymn the same king proclaimed himself son of Enlil and Ninlil131 in a clear interchange of roles between both gods. The later literary texts of Babylonian tradition continue to refer implicitly to this comparison. We have already seen how Dagan accompanies Anum in a large number of literary texts and royal inscriptions, equating himself with the heavenly Sumero-Akkadian god and replacing Enlil in the supreme duo of the pantheon of the south.132 Especially illuminating is a bilingual literary text in which the Akkadian text mentions Dagan and in his place the Sume-rian text cites Enlil133 showing that the comparison was complete in Baby-lon; in this case, de η -1 ί 1 is treated practically as a logogram for Dagan. In late tradition this comparison also occurred, Enlil is accompanied by Dagan in various liturgical texts.134 This comparison is also evident outside Babylonia.

In this case the facts are obvious and unequivocal and we can state that the comparison of Enlil and Dagan comes from ancient times, possibly from the third millennium, when the Sargon dynasty used the worship of Dagan of Tuttul to support their western conquests. On the one hand, this identifi-cation has stayed constant during the whole second millennium in Syria, and on the other hand, in Babylonia and Assyria, with more textual material at our disposal, it spread during the whole first millennium. The identifica-tion, then, is certain and correct. The question of the origin and reason for this identification is a problem that is closely linked with the role and position of both gods in their respec-tive pantheons and may be of decisive help in drawing the profile of the Syrian god. Enlil and Dagan are basically identified as heads of the pan-theon, as executor gods and as fathers of their respective divine progeny. The comparison is based on some well-defined attributes in both cases. The use of caiques on 'Enlilian' epithets for Dagan is not to be interpreted as a simple reflection of the Syrian god with his Sumero-Akkadian counterpart. Dagan is not the Syrian copy of Enlil, he is the god of a pantheon that has status and, in part, some attributes similar to Enlil's, the head of the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon, who for cultural reasons and due to the spread of Sumero-Babylonian culture throughout the ancient Near East by means of cuneiform writing, was known everywhere. We may define Dagan as the Syrian Enlil, in the same way that the Assyrians defined Aššur as the Assyrian Enlil; however we may also describe Enlil as the Sumero-Akkadian Dagan; only the cultural might of southern Iraq and the export of its culture, explains that it is difficult for us to make the journey from west to east whereas the journey in the opposite direction seems 'natural'. 137 Cf.

Kumarbi We have seen how there is good evidence for the identification of Dagan with Enlil in the sources and there are even some explicit references to the comparison (such as the quotation of the list An=Anum). The case of Kumarbi is different, we do not have any document that records a compari-son recognised from antiquity, no god-list equates them. Even so, we have enough information to affirm that this comparison really did exist and that there was a process of syncretism beween Dagan and Kumarbi. The clearest information comes from Ugarit, a series of god lists record a stable order in citing the gods who appear in the following sequence: Ilib, El, Dagan.146 In parallel, a hymn written in Hurrian, also from Ugarit, mentions the gods in the same sequence as the lists that we have mentioned, but in Hurrian, so this case the gods are in atn, il, ktnrb, that is to say: Father-god, El, Kumarbi;147 the last mentioned appears in the Hurrian text in the same position as Dagan in the texts written in Ugaritic and Akkadian. In this way there is good evidence for the comparison, the lists have an evident syncretistic intention, and the Hurrian equivalence, even though not a text of the same genre, corresponds to a model of the pantheon that is clearly equivalent. Other indirect facts strengthen this identification. The Babylonian list An=Anum describes Salas as the wife of Dagan,148 the Hurro-Hittite texts from Bogazköy document Kumarbi's connection with the goddess Šalaš/Šaluš.149 On the other hand, the myth of yedammu connects Kumarbi with the city of Tuttul, one of the traditional sanctuaries of wor-ship of the god Dagan attested uninterruptedly from the third millennium in Ebla to the end of the Bronze Age in Ugarit.150 A trilingual god list from Ugarit has the following equation: [Enlil = K]umarbi=Ilum.151 If we were to add a hypothetical fourth column it is quite clear that it would have to concern Dagan given his known comparison with Enlil and the more prob-able identifcation with El. This identification via Enlil is quite obvious in certain Hittite-Akkadian bilinguals in which Enlil is 'translated' as Kumarbi.152 146 Cf. RS 20.24 = J.

As for their agrarian character, we have already seen how the case of Dagan is very doubtful given that this description was basically given through the etymology connected with west Semitic, an etymology is not corroborated by reference to the god in context. We have already seen how Kumarbi's connection with agriculture was due, in part, to his being compared with Dagan. All the same, once Dagan's agrarian character disappears, Kumarbi's attributes as a god of agriculture lessen. Even so, it is not the purpose of this book to sketch out the real portrait of Kumarbi; however, what must remain clear is that if Kumarbi has any agrarian character it is not due to his identification with Dagan. Fundamental to the comparison between the two gods is the almost identical position each has in his respective pantheon, both retain the title 'Father of the gods', have the Storm-god as their pre-eminent son and the same wife. Another matter is to see whether this identi-fication occurs as 'equal to equal' or whether there is some reflection of one god by the other. Considering how old the evidence for the god Dagan is, it is possible to think that Kumarbi is simply his 'Hurrian counterpart'. If we accept that basic structure and pattern of the Hurrian pantheon are foreign, we could propose the hypothesis that at least in part, this structure had a Syrian origin. E. LAROCHE and W.G. LAMBERT155 have already proposed a Sumerian structure for the Hurrian pantheon; it is possible, however, that the basic model was the pantheon of the middle Euphrates, with Dagan as head of the pantheon, father of the gods and father of the Storm-god. 6.3.3. El If the identification of Dagan and Enlil was very explicit in the Babylonian texts and the identification of Dagan and Kumarbi can be clearly inferred from the textual material available to us, the identification between EI and Dagan is an hypothesis that has to be explained and described in more de-tail. The principal facts that support this identification occur basically in the texts from Ugarit, in which, both in the mythology and in the ritual texts, El, with the consent of Bacl, has the character of pre-eminent god. Even so, the god Dagan occurs, both in the texts from the cultic tradition and, to a lesser extent, in the epics and myths. There are basically two facts that relate these two gods to each other: both El and Dagan are stated to be fathers of Bacl in the Ugaritic texts.156 This twofold sonship of the Storm-god has caused concern to most students of the religion of Syria in the second and 153 H.G.

The paradox consists in seeing how a god as important as Dagan had no role in the epic and mythological texts of Ugarit. The first to attempt to resolve the problem by means of identification was J. FONTENROSE,157 who basically used classical sources and the god lists of Ugarit. Other scholars have made more or less similar proposals, varying the degree of identification and the background to the fusion of two parallel pantheons. M. ASTOUR proposed total identification between Dagan and El, even suggesting that Dagan was the god's royal name and El his mere appel-lative.158 More recently, G. DEL OLMO LETE has been one of the principal defenders of the thesis that the two gods are identical, as a reflex of a fusion of pantheons.159 On the other hand, various scholars have made proposals of comparison with various nuances.160 Apart from the twofold sonship of the Storm-god, evidence for a com-parison between El and Dagan is indirect; we have already seen that a god list from Ugarit equates Enlil, Kumarbi and El. It seems to make sense, then, in the light of the comparison with Enlil and Kumarbi, that the hypo-thetical fourth element in the equation should be occupied by Dagan. The equivalence of the atttributes of both gods is striking: both have the role of father of the gods and of generator gods,161 in the case of El with explicit references to particular gods,162 El is the 'Creator of creatures' (bny bnwt)163 and outside Ugarit he is called 'Creator of the earth' (7 qn 'rs).164 On the other hand, two texts from Ugarit place in parallel Atirat , El's tradi-157 In fact, J.

It must be remembered that we only know of the existence of El, with titles, attributes, temple and cult from the Late Bronze on the Le-vantine coast. Earlier references to El (I1um/IIā etc.) are generic names for the god. As J.-M. DURAND says (MROA 2/1 159) it is possible that, in fact, in personalising El, he takes on the attributes of the neighbouring father-creator-king gods and in particular those of Dagan. 159 G.

In the light of the evidence we have set out we may conclude that Dagan had a pre-eminent role within the Semitic pantheon of the mid-Euphrates. He had the same rank as the principal (father)-gods of the neighbouring pantheons, with an evident fatherhood in respect of the Storm-god, who was to become one of the most popular and most powerful gods after the second half of the second millennium. The centre for all this was basically the region of the mid-Euphrates, so we could consider Dagan as a 'local' god, as 'local' or as 'national' as El in the Mediterranean Levant, the Hurrian Kumarbi, Marduk in Babylon, Assyrian Aššur or the Sumero-Akkadian duo An-Enlil. In this way, the comparative structure of the summit of the divine roll of the various neighbouring pantheons is as follows: Sumero-Akkadian Hurrian Syrian Sumero-Akkadian Hurrian Hinterland 'Semitic' Coastal 'Semitic' Husband Wife Husband Wife Husband Wife Husband Wife An An Enlil Ninlil/ Ninbursag Kumarbi Ša1a/uš Dagan Ša1aš El Atirat Adad Ša1a Tešup Hebat Addu-Bacl tiebat Haddu-Bacl cAttart-cAnat TABLE 11. Comparative table of the pantheons. It is clear that there were two 'Semitic' pantheons in Syria: one headed by the couple Dagan and Salas in inner Syria, with main sanctuaries in Tuttul and Terqa, and the other led by El and Atirat on the coast.165 The first with two pre-eminent sons, the pair of sibling-consorts Addu-^Jebat with a seat in Aleppo, who are equivalent to the two couples Haddu/Ba°l and cAttart/cAnat of the coast. These two traditions merged in Ugarit, where Dagan appears in obliquely in the myths as father of Bacl. In this way his role as a god for-eign to Ugarit is evident and at the same time his equation with El is stressed. Even so, Dagan had a cult and a presence in the liturgy of Ugarit, which shows that both gods were considered equal but not assimilated, that is to say, they kept their own status and character even though their profile and position in their respective pantheons were practically identical. Dagan, however, was always perceived as a god foreign to Ugarit, as shown by the two references to Dagan of Tuttul in the text corpus of the coastal metropo-lis.166 165 Cf. G.

The geographical spread of the cult of Dagan The region of the principal cult of Dagan corresponds basically to the mid-Euphrates Valley; this is evident already in the oldest texts, in which the god Dagan appears in connection with Syrian region. Two centres of the cult stand out from the rest: Tuttul, in the upper region of the middle section of the Euphrates, and Terqa, a short distance from Mari, with its famous tem-ple of Dagan called é - k i - s i - g a 'The house, the silent place'.167 There is good evidence for the antiquity of the cult in these two sanctuaries already in the third millennium. The archives from Ebla document the cult of Dagan and his wife Salas in the city of Tuttul, the importance of the sanctuary of Tuttul is confirmed by the testimony of Sargon of Akkad who went to visit and worship in the temple on the occasion of his western conquests and also the testimony of Narām-Sîn when he quoted the god in connection with the famous sanctuary of the Middle Euphrates. On the other hand, the texts from Mari of the pre-Sargonic period already prove the existence of the 'Lord of Terqa' who can be none other than Dagan in the light of the Old Babylonian texts. During the whole second millennium, both Terqa and Tuttul continue to be well documented through their respective sanctuaries of Dagan. The ar-chives of Mari and the texts found in Terqa bear witness to this cult. The temple of Dagan in Terqa is a centre of pilgrimage and a religious reference point for the people of a much wider geographical area. We have already seen how the weapons of Addu from Aleppo were deposited in this temple for safe-keeping. The kings of Mari and other kings of smaller kingdoms came to worship him in Terqa, to the extent that there were problems in finding the suitable moment for being able to make the sacrifices due to the large number of faithful that made the pilgrimage there. On the other hand, the temple expanded an intense administrative activity derived from the important cultic movement, there are very many documents that record the material needs first or the manpower to carry out the different kinds of work connected with the cult of the god. The Dagan of Terqa was also important for his decisive role in political matters, especially through his prophecies and oracles. There is not so much evidence for the Dagan of Tuttul as for the Dagan of Terqa in the second millennium, even so, the texts where he appears come from various archives, some very far from the mid-Euphrates, which gives some idea of how famous the sanctuary was beyond its immediate area of influence. According to the archives of Mari, Tuttul was governed by the high priest of Dagan, who represented the local power against the protector-ate that the king of Mari attempted to exercise through his representative in the holy city. It seems, then, that the traditional government of Tuttul had strong links with the clergy of the temple of Dagan. Later, in the Late Bronze Age, the texts from Emar continue to give evidence of the function and fame of the temple of Dagan of Tuttul, one of the temples with most influence over the city of Emar according Old Babylonina texts from Mari. 167 A.R.

Obviously, these were not the only two sanctuaries of Dagan that existed in Syria during the Bronze Age, but they were the most famous, and the evidence for them in the sources has the most continuity. The texts from Mari document sanctuaries of Dagan in various cities in the Middle Euphra-tes region, such as Mari, Subātum, Urafo, yakku1ān, Saggarātum, Zarri-amnān or Dašrān. The texts from the Late Bronze Age also provide evidence of a temple in the city of Emar and in other villages, the location of which is difficult to determine.168 As for popular devotion and its geographical distribution, the texts from Mari and from Emar provide most personal names in the second millennium in Syria. The facts show that there is a sustained leadership of Dagan as principal god of the popular pantheon during most of the second millen-nium. In Mari, Dagan is the best attested god among the population of the mid-Euphrates. The area of the greatest influence of the cult of Dagan goes from Emar to the land of Sut)ûm, that is to say, exactly the middle section of the river. As we go further from the Euphrates, the facts change and the most popular gods are different, such as Addu. The texts from Emar, even though more local than from Mari, provides a large amount of onomastic material from various cities in the vicinity of Emar, and Dagan is by far the god who occurs most often in the onomasticon. This provides confirmation that cult of Dagan continued to be popular in the mid-Euphrates during a large part of the second millennium. 6.5. Profile and attributes Thus there are difficulties in defining the profde of this god for whom the sources give very little explanation. His active participation is not recorded in any myth or literary text. His cult is basically concentrated in Syria, outside 'classical' Babylonia, where the amount of texts, even though large, cannot be compared with the huge number of documents from southern Mesopotamia and Assyria. In spite of these problems and once all the Syr-ian texts from the Bronze Age that make any reference to Dagan have been studied, it is possible to draw a clear enough portrait of the god, not perhaps with the clarity of other deities in Sumero-Babylonian tradition, such as Enlil, Marduk or Nabu, but with enough clarity to define his main attributes and his domains. 6.5.1. Father creator Dagan occurs in the texts as the father and creator god of the pantheon of the Syrian hinterland and was especially worshipped in the mid-Euphrates. He 168 Cf. above 237f. Outside Syria, a definite cult of Dagan can be detected during the period of the third dynasty of Ur, more specifically within the royal family. It is possible that this devotion for Dagan entered the royal house of Ur through the marriage of Tarām-Uram, the daughter of Apil-kïn of Mari with the then prince Šu1gi."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"is called 'Father of the great gods', 'Creator of the heavens and the earth' and 'Father begetter of the gods'169 in a text from Mari where other deities feature, well defined by their traditional profiles known to modern scholars (An/Enlil-royalty, Enki-destiny, Nintur/Ninbursag-mother-creatress, Šamaš-justice, Addu-hero/weather/warrior and Istar-female warrior), there is, then, no reason for not ascribing this profile to Dagan, when the other deities are well portrayed according to the canons accepted by scholars. This profile is not exclusive to the texts from Mari, in the same Old Babylonian period, Dagan is called 'Father of the gods' in an inscription from Aleppo.170 In the material from Emar of the Middle Babylonian period Dagan is given various epithets, in particular 'the very father', 'Lord creator' and 'Lord of off-spring7'.171 This profile of father god and creator is strengthened by his identification with the father gods of neighbouring pantheons, such as Enlil, El and Kumarbi. Dagan bestows and proclaims the royalty of the kings of the mid-Euphrates, he is the father-god who grants this privilege and gives support to the earthly king, this role is well attested in Mari sources, how-ever the inscriptions of the kings of the Sargon dynasty indicate an older origin of this divine attribute. All this puts Dagan in the position of royal god with executive authority that was maintained during most of the second millennium and probably already had during all the second half of the third. There is no indication of a declined of his cult during the Bronze Age, at least in hinterland Syria in the Middle Euphrates. Evidently, on the coast the weight of El and Haddu-Bacl is very strong and the local tradition pre-vents first class penetration of Dagan.172 All the same, in the interior there is no sign in this period of any initial decline or supplanting of Dagan by Addu, unlike what had already happened at this time in Ugarit between El and the Storm-god. We do not know when the supplanting took place in the interior since the first millennium is particularly poor in texts in Middle Euphrates Syria, even so it must have happened given that Hadad is chief god of Aramaean religion.173 6.5.2. The supposed underworld character of Dagan The principal facts that connect Dagan with the hereafter are his participation in certain funerary rites, the title he is given of bel pagrê 'Lord of the funer-ary offerings' in Mari and the Ugaritic texts that confirm his continued 169 A. 1258+ : 9-11 (= D. CHARPIN, RAI 35 8 = M. GUICHARD, FM 3 [ 1997] 81 = J.-M. DURAND, LAPO 16 22 = MROA 2/1 146f.). 170 Cf. above 171 AL:T 1. 171 Cf. above 239f. 172 Even so, it is on the coast that there are some remains of this cult, such as the cult at-ested in the Bible by the Philistines of Asdod and Gaza (ISam 5; IMac 10 83f.; 11 4; 1Chr 10 10; Judg 16 21-23). For an ideological reading of the 'Ark Narrative' cf. B.L. CROWELL, JANER 1 (2001) 5lf. 173 Cf. H. GESE, RAAM 217f.; J. TEIXIDOR, MROA 2/2 369f. Note, however, the refer-ence to Dagan (together with Melqart and Ešmun) in the treaty between the Assyrian king Aššur-nērārī V (754-745) and Mati'-El, the king of the Aramaean city-state of Arpad, north of Aleppo (S. PARPOLA - K. WATANABE, SAA 2 2 VI 21)."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"relationship with the pgr-offerings.174 This is the fundamental evidence that has led some scholars to give Dagan an underworld profile or, at least, an underworld aspect.175 The ritual of the pagrâ'um consisted basically in offering a corpse to be burnt; this sacrifice was celebrated as part of a mourn-ing ceremony, as shown by the pagrâ'um that was offered on Sumu-epub's death in Aleppo. The main recipient of these pagrâ'um-sacrifices is Dagan, both in Mari and in Ugarit, showing in this way, the survival of the cere-mony over the centuries. The sacrifice was celebrated in honour of the dead person, but the recipient was Dagan.176 The question is to determine why this ritual was intended for Dagan and not a god of clear underworld charac-ter, such as Nergal or Rašap. The answer surely lies in Dagan's main charac-ter, in his pre-eminent role in the Syrian pantheon, if not in the inner Syria of the mid-Euphrates. Dagan is the recipient because he is the creator father god. According to G. DEL OLMO LETE, here Dagan has the role of ancestral god of the Canaanites7, and as such incorporates the other divine ances-tors.177 His role as father of the gods, as the supreme creator god, is reason enough for him to continue as recipient of an offering on behalf of the dead. This does not entail Dagan being strictly an underworld god, in the same way that neither Salas nor Hebat is known to have an underworld character, even though they receive a pagrā «m-sacrifice in the court of Aleppo. Dagan is the recipient of these sacrifices, and ultimately they are intended for him, as he is the supreme god of the pantheon of inland Syria. Dagan has power, government and authority in various spheres; he is the first and last in-stance, the beginning and the end. 174 As for Dagan's possible connections with the underworld in texts from Babylonian tradition from the late period cf. the comments by IF. HEALEY (JNSL 5 [1977] 51) directed at refuting this supposed underworld character. 175 J.J.M. ROBERTS, ESP 19; H. NlEHR, JNSL 20 (1994) 173. The possible underworld connection of some of the rituals of Emar in which Dagan takes part, is difficult to determine. The protagonist of the ii'jju-festival of Dagan is basically Ninkur, his consort. Some scholars have interpreted the ceremony as the commemoration of the descent of the goddess into the underworld, but this hypothesis is not certain, cf. above 5.1.2.2. The reference to terms con-nected with the underworld could also confirm this supposed character of Dagan, but unfor-tunately the terms are quite difficult to interpret to be used in favour of Dagan as an underworld god, cf. the discussion of the terms Ijarrum and abu in Terqa and Emar above 4.6.1.2.c. 176 Cf. G. DEL OLMO LETE, CCC 85. 177 Cf. CCC 84, there is no doubt that the scholar is influenced by Dagan's hypothetical relationship with Canaan in Ebla; on this question cf. above 2.1.1.6. (Ganana)."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ABBREVIATIONS AAAS AASOR 44 ADS ADTB AEM AF AfO AHw AION AIPHOS Akk AkkSyll ALASP(M) ALASP 7 AnSe 2 AOAT AoF APDA ARES 1 ARES 2 ARET ARM ArOr ASJ AULS AuOr(S) BaM Les annales archéologiques arabes syriennes.
