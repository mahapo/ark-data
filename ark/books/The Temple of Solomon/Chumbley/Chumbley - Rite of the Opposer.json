[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Rite of the OpposerBy Andrew ChumbleyThe intent of this rite is solely that given unto it by its practitioner in reciprocation to theintent of the Current summoned through its practice. The functions and applications arerevealed solely through its practice and subsequent adaptation by the practitioner inaccordance with such secret and unique directions as are revealed unto him. The initialdirections are as follows: In a Place of Solitude and at the Hour of Twilight, light a singlewhite candle and place it within the centre of one's shadow. Standing before the shadowand fixating all attention upon the light of the single flame - recite the Prayer of theDesign. This done, pick up the candle and, moving anticlockwise, turn your back towardthe shadow, then proceed to recite the Formulae of the Opposer. This being fulfilled andsuch adjunctive acts as are deemed pertinent being completed, turn about once more, andthus completing one full orientation, wordlessly extend the flame as in salutation towardsthe shadow; with a single breath or orison extinguish the candle. Then, as directed, walkaway from the Place of Solitude and turn not to gaze back from whence you came -forsuch is a custom of Arte. The Prayer of Design may also be used in isolation or as anadjunctive/declaration in other suc h ritual/meditative procedures. An example of thepractical adaptation of the rite as given above: in contradistinction to using toward andagainst the shadow as the determinants of the rite's polarities, employ such stellaranalogues as the Pole-star and the Dog-star. Also the direction of orientation may bechanged from widdershins to deosil in alteration, according to whether the rite isperformed at dusk or dawn - or in the dark or bright fortnight of the lunar month.THE PRAYER OF THE DESIGN: As my Words punctuate the Silence, and the Silencemy Words - so doth their resonance align and magnify Power sufficient to reify theirIntent. As I begin - so doth the Design which at my Words shall Become! My Wordsencipher me and create Reality; As I speak so these Words ensorcel Possibilities. Thatwhich I shall become will transcend aught that hath been worshipped. I will becomeOther than that which hath been named. Chaos is the Primogenitor of my Forms - Fromwhence come my Manifestations. Existence Itself will be eclipsed by my Shadow.Chance is my Circle without Circumference; Fate is my Centre without Position. Magickis my Force: Energy beyond Limitation. My Body is Transition: From Now unto Now.My Words encipher me and create Possibilities; As I speak so these Words ensorcelReality. As I cease - so doth All - but the Design of which I speak. As I cease - so dothAll - but that which I am.FORMULA OF THE OPPOSER: As the Dragon doth coil about the Infinite, and theWheel of Heaven doth turn upon its Heart, so let All revolve upon this Point. As theCircle doth turn through the Seasons of Change, so now do I turn, as the Axis of Fate, tomanifest the Word of mine own Self-Overcoming: In the Day of mine Offering there isNo-one and No-thing whom I will not sacrifice. In the Day of my Becoming there is Nooneand No-thing whom I will not transcend. In the Day of mine Oath there is No-oneand No-thing whom I will not forswear.
