[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Lover’s Call to the Angel of Witchblood I. The First Call: Petition Myself to myself I offer, this Holy Rite to begin. By Lightning­bolt, by Flaming Torch, by the Serpent’s Fire within: Let all that I have attained in eternity be manifest in the Present Moment of I: Absolute. O’ Azra­Lumial! Angelick Soul of the Master Cain! Initiator of the Draconist Mystery, Opener of the Gates to the Crooked Path! Hear my call, for I entreat Thee! The vessel of the Heart is opened unto Thee! Behold I stand alone in Void, within the Empty Circle of the Royal Arte; My Lover’s Call goeth forth to Thee, O’ Angel of the Peacock­quill! The Lamp of the Hermit awaits the Flame of Thy Presence: My Heart awaits the Adamantine Light of Thy initiation! O’ Az’ra­Lumial! Solely Manifest of the Eleven Elder Gods, Thou are XON: Light from all Nullity revealed unto Man. Thou art the Begetter of the Four Sovereign Watchers and The Sixteen Faithful Gods. As Man thou art born – fire amidst clay – from their wiseblood and cunning seed; Self­from self, eight times Thou art begotten on the Wheel of The Year and a Day. O’ Az’ra­Lumial, descend as Flesh, the Living Word; The One of Light, seven times adorned in the rainbow’s promise! O’ Az’ra­Lumiel, arise as Gnosis, the Mind of Heaven: The Great Dragon, seven­headed, crowned and victorious! II.

In the South­east I evoke Thee, in the Saffron Light of the Shining Ones, By the Horns of the True and Chosen Gods!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"By Ash’modai and Azh’terah be summoned! In the East I invoke Thee, in the Amber Light of the Tameless, In the Wild Procession of the Turnskin Gods! By Naamah and Zhamael be summoned! In the North­east I evoke Thee, in the Crimson Light of all Sacrifice, In the Purified Way of Entrance that leads to the Circle of Witchblood! By Tubalo and Lucifera be summoned! From the North I approach Thy Heart, my Lover, my Soul of Souls! Beneath my heels is the Lucifer­Stone, the Hidden Centre of every Land. Above me is the Circle of the Seven Holy Stars, the Crowned Heads of Thee; In their midst is set Thy Secret Throne: Pole of Poles, Star of Stars, The Nail that never cools! Amid the Realms of Shade and Spirit I call to Thee, Intercessor! Ghost­King! Sage and Jester! Man’draku Ezh­hou Sabatraxa! Open the Way for me! Amid the Seven Lands of Earth I call to Thee, Wanderer!

Az’ra­Lumial! Open the Way for me! Az’ra­Lumial, Thy Name I recite til Thou art come – III. The Third Call: Sacrifice for Divine Assumption The Sphere of the Seven Rays shines about me; The Serpent of the Seven Colours uncoils within; The Inmost Gate is made open to Thee. O’ Az’ra­Lumial, Spirit of Witchblood, I bid Thee to enflesh! O’ Thou Spirit ruling the countless Paths of Initiation, Open the Way for me, that I may open the Way for Thee! This rite is mine Oath and Pledge: in passing through all things I shall become the Living Truth. This I entreat Thee O’ Many­masked God of the Royal Arte, Make Thou Thy Shrine and Hearth within me, That I may burn with Thy Gnosis – consumed in the Perfect Love of Thee! The Words of this Rite are as Milk, Blood and Honey to Thee. Devotion I offer: my heart is the Rose that I lay ‘pon Thine Altar. Such are my Words, so shall it be! In Silence to go forth anew! IV: Contemplation: The Seal of the Rite In Hermitage most secret, I make my decree in unsaying truth. In Thought, Word, and Deed a Wayless Fate; unique, from all paths astray: Mine own law – ethos, aesthesis and credo – unknown to mortal gods and men."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This Rite is mine own epiphany, the Lover’s Call of Apophasis: I So Mote It Be.
