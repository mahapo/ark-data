The work of the Column of the Crooked Path was by its nature a collaborative effort, of which the words upon these pages are but a part. Several texts herein were adapted from other, private manuscripts, which remain concealed, both of my own authorship, and in collaboration with fellow brethren. Most especial honour and appreciation must be accorded to Soror P.A.,-a True Priestess, unsurpassed in these Mysteries - for her wisdom, loyalty and exemplary devotion in practise; all of which have been instrumental in the fruition of this present work. Appreciation must likewise be shown to Frater A., for his good counsel and fraternity, and for teaching that which he does not claim to know. Heartfelt gratitude must be expressed to Gavin Semple, for both his courage and incompara-ble insight. Acknowledgement must also be given for collaboration upon the ritual text of 'The Stellar Transvocation', and for kind permission to utilise and adapt the texts of 'The Hypostasis' and the consecration formulae of both the Arthana and Bone-trumpet. Finally, a debt of honour is here paid to Peter Giles for his initial conception of the Draco-nian Gnosis, and equal part in sowing the seeds of intent during the manifest inception of the Column. Acknowledgement must also be given for collaboration on the early drafts of both the Oracle Rite and the Ancestral Rite, as well as the designs for the stellar draconic path of the Second Circle. For all that passed between us in the Viper's embrace, words cannot suffice. For all that has yet to be ... a thousand dreams cannot foretell! Further especial acknowledgement must be given to Robert Fitzgerald, for being the first to incept this Work in America, and for his critical analysis of the text. Similarly, thanksgiving to Daniel A. Schulke for continuing the Work of the Draconian Column, and for bearing this Work unto the Eyes of the World. Lastly, among the Named, untold blessings upon Soror I:. for love, life and liberty! Auspicious Gratitude must also be offered to those True Companions of the Path -both liv-ing and dead, who are far too numerous to name here and yet are held most preciously in mind. For all that led to the utterance of 'The Oracle' and for all proceeding from it, may the bless-ing be upon the Initiator. To Those as yet unborn to the Path, the Scribe prostrates and here offers this work. J.D.K."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I 2 }.I TABLE OF CONTENTS THE ORACLE OF ELDER WORSHIP.

In the Beginning and in the End, throughout Eternity and in each season of time, even within this Very Moment, the Elder Gods cast forth their Spirit from the Void beyond to the Void within ... The Antient One cometh forth through the Secret Fire of Illumination, to burn within the Shrine of the Earth, to here make manifest the Mystery within the Flesh and Blood of the Wise."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"G:rimorium 0~nomoeia Draco'Taus In the fulfilment of prophecy at this present cross-roads of /E,on and Mind, the Elder Gods have cast forth the Secret Likeness of the Void -the Formless Form -into the Circle of the Royal Arte; here to serve as the Perfect Vessel of the Flame, even as the Living Temple of Gnosis, wherein the Initiated Body may convene and conquer all.

For such is the current of many streams, the life-blood of the stars that floweth in the Sorcerer's heart and that formeth, each moment anew, the Body of Our Arcane Tradition.

The Sacred Vessel THE SACRED VESSEL of the Draconian Mysteries is the Placeless Centre of the World. It is the Ytiible image of the Seeker - a mirror of the initiatory path - fashioned in the likeness of an c:nt:hen fetish-urn. It is the athanor for the self-creation of the Mage, wrought for the transmu-arion of all according to the secret and uniquely revealed intent of the Crooked Way. THE MARRIAGE-VESSEL By Thine Arte, O' Sorcerer, procure for Thyself a vessel pure and empty. let it be cleansed from all past taint, purified by the touch of the elements, and be virgin unto the force of intent. For this shall serve as the marriage-bed for Thy most sacred union: the Agapae between Man and the Antient Serpent. THE FIRST MANIFESTATION of the magical urn is known as 'The Marriage-vessel'. In form a should be of sufficient size to contain the blood-filled heart of Man; for that is the sacrifice anbined: the rubeate jewel in the Seeker's own breast. Its substance should be of clay, wood or"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Taue glass; of such matter as may be broken asunder by the hands of fire. The Marriage-vessel is used solely at the inception of the path during the first working of the Hieros Gamos or Ka Rite. Once a suitable form has been obtained the vessel should be conse-crated to this intent and then sealed until the appointed time of its use. The Hieros Gamos or Sacred Marriage is a solitary rite which is practised in order to unite the aspirant to the Crooked Path - to wed Man unto Serpent. The enchantment of the Mar-riage Rite is worked daily for the last lunar month of the solar year - from Dark Moon to Dark Moon. Each day at midnight, the Marriage-vessel is opened and the Rite of Ka is worked. Each day an offering of blood and sexual fluids is made to the vessel; each day the entirety of the aspirant's being is offered to the opened mouth of Azhdeha. At the summation of each daily working the vessel should be closed and at the end of the entire Marriage Rite, that is, at the end of the twenty-eight/twenty-nine day cycle of the Moon, it should be hermetically sealed and wrapped in a black cloth. Upon the day of Midwinter, during the hour bestriding the Black Noon of Midnight, the Vessel of Marriage is to be cast into the burning hearth of the Circle. This offering is the gift of the World's Heart, the sacrifice of All to the pyre of eternity. Its deed reveals the birth-and-death-place for all mortal gods and men; it is the sacrosanct act of primal transgression which ignites Our Path and illumines the Way forth. Within this very deed lies the inmost arcanum, concealed within the Mystery known as 'The Rite of the Black Sun'. The offering of the Marriage-vessel to the fire that burns in the midst of the longest night is revered as the foundation-offering of the Crooked Path; for the slaying of the vessel is the sever-ing of the Seeker's own head. The votive act of the urn's cremation is at one with the complete sacrifice of all consciousness to the primordial source of the initiatory current: the unification of Mind with the Ophidian Flame - the Living Fire of the Elder Gods. By the means of Ka the Seeker enters the Way of the Antient Dragon. O' Earthen Vessel! May the blessing be upon Thee, around Thee and within Thee.

THE DRAGON-VESSEL THE DRAGON-VESSEL IS born from the ashes of the Hieros Gamos and is exalted as the Sover-eign Vehicula of the Crooked Path; it is revered as the Fetish-urn of Purest Diablerie, the Very Image of Sorcery's God. The root of its ineffable empowerment is the point of the Sun's infernal descent -the nigrescent heart of the longest night; for the time of greatest outward darkness is hallowed as the most sacred hour: the epiphany for the secret light of initiation. The urn which is to serve as the Dragon-vessel is to be obtained during the last days of the Hieros Gamos or during the interstitial time betwixt the end of the Marriage Rite and the time of its Midwinter consummation. It should be chosen by the Mage's fate, by the guidance of dreams and the unseen hand of the spirits. In size the vessel should be like unto the very skull of Man, for that indeed is its most perfect form. Elsewise let its substance be of clay, wood or glass, such as is fitting for the feast of insatiate flame. Having been obtained or fashioned by the aspirant, the new urn should be consecrated unto its destined purpose as the focus for the magical path - for the initiatory ordalium of the year and a day that lies between Black Sun and Black Sun. Being duly hallowed as the ordained repository of magical power the newly conse-crated vessel is to be brought -empty and barren - alone or in covine - unto the Circle of the ~lidwinter Rite. At the summation of that most sacred mystery, when the old vessel has passed beyond, let seven offerings of ash be taken from the embers of the pyre and interred in the new and empty vessel.

At the binding of the Midwinter Rite let the Dragon-vessel be sealed and then wrapped in a cloth of crimson silk, even as a child swaddled in the flayed skin of its own begetter. The Drag-on-vessel is hereafter used as the primary external focus of all magical operations undertaken upon the Crooked Path. It is the Idol of Aversity within the Shrine of the Elder Worship. Its visible form shall be the mirror for the Seeker's own destiny and shall serve as the crossroads be-tween the Carnal Vessel of the Sorcerer's Flesh and the Aethyric Vessel of the Dragon's Celestial Body. All shall conjoin within this athanor; for all that is must turn and re-turn to the point of primordial empowerment. Being made according to the methods of Arte, the Dragon-vessel is to be opened by the hands of Man solely at the ordained times of darkness throughout the year:-i) At the solitary working of the Oracle Rite at each Dark Moon. ii) Upon each day of the last lunar month of the solar year -when the annual Covenant of the Sacred Marriage is renewed. iii) During the rare and especial times of the Sun or Moon's eclipse, when the Dragon's lips do close about the celestial orbs of Helios and Luna. At these times, being of subtil alignment unto the Night of the Black Sun, the offering of the World-field shall be made unto the Dragon-vessel's mouth, even the sacrifice of all Existence unto the very lips of the Antient One. By the many deeds of the Path, by the fourteen ordeals upon the hooks and crooks of the Way, the Body of Qayin, the First-born Sorcerer, shall be imaged-forth in the Vessel: the Flesh of all Initiated Entity shall be revealed from the deep in the Star-polish'd Mirror of Azhaka. The many-masked Vessel of the Crooked Way is conceived upon the point of the Black Sun, and is made manifest within the Voidwise Pyre of all Negation. From the Circle of its birth, the path of the Vessel goes forth through the ordeals of the year and the day. Having passed full-circle around the Wheel of Time, it must return unto its own source, to the forge of its mak-ing. Know ye therefore that the life of the Dragon-vessel is that of the Monarch of the World, crowned for but a single year at a time and destined to return unto the place of consecration - to the sacred pyre of its own self-creation. In the heart of Midwinter the throne of the Sovereign shall become the altar of royal execution ... For as the last lunar month of the solar year comes round once more, the Urn of the Dragon shall serve as the Vessel of Marriage for the re-affirmation of the Covenant between the Elder Gods and Man. At that ordained time betwixt Dark Moon and Dark Moon at the end of the year, the Dragon-vessel shall serve as the repository for the Compact of Ka. Thus shall the Promise of the Hieros Gamos be exacted anew. At the Dark Tide of Midwinter the Seeker returns unto the Rite of the Black Sun. Here the aged vessel must be slain, cast down into the forge to be rent asunder by the hands of the fire. And as the old vessel dies, so from the ashen remains it shall be born anew. Seven offerings shall be taken once more from the hearth of the Black Sun and these shall enter the lips of a newly blessed vessel. The Monarch of the Round Arte shall rule once more for a year and a day; the Wheel of the Sacred Year shall turn and turn again. As the Spirit of the Dragon-vessel transmigrates from fetish-urn to fetish-urn, from Midwin-ter to Midwinter, so the path of the Seeker shall transform from year to year - deed to deed, forever turning and re-turning to the initiatory source of the Royal Arte: the Birth-place and the Burial-ground of Qayin Azhaka. ~6"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE SERVITOR VESSELS: the Naked Children of the Dragon 'Ihe EA!o.rdia The Watchers' steps shall fall 'pon Earth and tread to compass the Infinitor's heart, Fourfold in flesh and fourfold in spirit, to keep and to guard the Unseen Flame.

The attendant vessels should be wrought or obtained, in number and in substance, according to the requirements of the practitioner and according to that which they shall contain. For the purposes of magical understanding the attendant vehicula may be perceived as being fourfold in nature.

THE PHOENIX-VESSEL OF THE DRAGON -THE Ever-changing Spirit of the Crooked Path-no fixed form is pos-sible. Such is the teaching of the Sacred Vessel, revealed in its passing to-and-from the Forge of Initiation. Yet of the very process itself, the manifold transmorphosis of Man and Serpent through the alchymic cycle of the ritual year,-of this there are many images cast forth upon the Dragon-road to reveal and reflect the transitory nature of each attained state of the Seeker ... to make known the sacred retinue of gods and spirits that keep and guard the way. Reaching between the stars above and the stars below, the seven-hued nature of the path is revealed and revered in the Name and Image ofDracotaos, the Peacock-winged Seraph of Light. Veiled in the fire at the circle's midst, the Serpent-angel is venerated as the Hidden One, the unseen mediator amongst the fourfold covine of the Watchers. In the realm of the Earthen Circle is the Grand Octrigan Companie of the Witch-fathers and Witch-mothers. They are the Assembly of Faithful Gods, revealing the procession of Mind through the masquerade of all Belief. In their midst, the Idol of Qayin Azhaka stands at the crossroads of the Compass-rose. Begotten of Our Cunning-fathers and Our Wise-blooded Mothers, and yet beyond both Man and Woman, this is the image of the First-born Initiate: the eidolon of the unique aspirant. In the realm of the spirits, in the kingdom of Elphame where dwell the invisible brethren of the serpent's race, in the many subtil domains of ancestral ghost and wandering djinn, there walks the Guardian of the Crooked Path, the Turncoat and Skin-leaper, known unto his chosen in the name ofDraku-Ezhu. The razor-edge of the path is the sword within this spirit's hand; his is the blade of sacrifice, which turns and cuts both ways to transcend the breach of foe and friend. His is the key to open and close each door. His is the secret that transforms all circum-stance -that diverts each and every turning of fate to serve the Seeker's will. All rites begin and end with an offering unto him, for he is the Intercessor between the Ways, the Messenger betwixt the Elder Gods and Man. In the realm of the Year and the Day, in the fourteen-stepped circle of word and deed, the process of transmutation is revealed in the changing masks of the Draconine Power. Perchance, betwixt the changing forms of this masquerade, the face itself may be seen. That the Seeker may attain unto the realisation of this arcanum, the Phoenix-vessel is employed as a visible focus for the gnosis of transmutational process and as a repository for the spirit-mediator of the path. In praxis, the Phoenix-vessel is a magical urn which may be used during a specific phase of the ritual year to augment the transmission of celestial empowerment and to create a visible me-dium for the cognisance of change. In form and construction, it should be like unto the vessel used in the Arcanum of Ka; for indeed its nature is to reflect - to oppose and to balance - the vehicula of the Hieros Gamos. szS"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The~ordia For the purpose of celestial empowerment the practices involving the Phoenix-vessel are begun upon the Day of Thu'ban, June 7th, and continue for fourteen days, culminating at Midsummer, June 21st. During this period, wherein each day is a mirror of time and task, the Phoenix-vessel is revered as the progeny of Azhdeha and is placed as a mask before the Dragon-vessel. As the first-born child it is conceived to incarnate all that may be begotten of the Dragon and as the first-born child it is offered in sacrifice -that the All-begetter may feast upon its own becoming and thus revoke the seeming course of its own destiny. Each day for fourteen days the vessel of the Phoenix is worked with in a manner distinct unto its purpose, tracing the path of the sidereal empowerment, node by node and star by star. The Guardian spirit is evoked and called forth to mount the earthen vehicle of the fetish-urn; likewise, the subtil form of the spirit is assumed in theandric similitude by the earthen vehicle of the practitioner's flesh. Upon the day of Midsummer, during the Sacred Mysterium of Ku, the Phoenix-vessel is sacrificed within the ritual hearth - cast into the solsticial pyre of the White Sun. For thus, in death, its spirit is released to enter and ride the steed of the Sorcerer's body. As the physical form of the vessel is destroyed and the spirit enters the Seeker, the focus for the realisation of trans-formative process shifts from external telesma to actualise itself as gnosis within the innermost point of self-realised consciousness. From the pyre of the White Sun the ashes of this sacrifice are to be gathered; thereafter to be offered unto the lips of the Dragon-vessel at the appropriate time of the closest Dark Moon. The use of the Phoenix-vessel from June 7th, the Rite ofla, to June 21st, the Rite of Ku, serves to transmit the stellar empowerment: the lineage ofla-Ra-Ku. The Rites of the Phoenix and the divers arcana of Ia-Ra-Ku may be used at the appropriate season in each successive year, for such are a potent means of comprehending the synastrian mysteries betwixt Serpent and Man.

Let the Seeker of the Swift Gate employ the Vessel of the Phoenix in a manner like unto the primal urn of Sacred Marriage, yet stepping forth upon the nodes of brightness - from Full Moon to Full Moon - for one complete lunar month prior to the Rite of Ku. As aforemen-tioned, let the vessel be cast into the pyre of sacrifice and the spirit called forth to indwell its Summoner. Those whom the spirit of the path favours shall go forth free, most blessed in the Dragon's sight, and the souls of those whom the spirit deems unworthy shall fall - forfeit to the Dragon's jaws. Those who wish to work the charms of the Phoenix by the path of the Moon for the sole purpose of self-alignment to the Draconian Gnosis should perform the appropriate devotions of the Phoenix-vessel and seal their deeds by the offering of the vessel to the White Sun's hearth. Thereafter let no ashes or relics be gathered from the fire, but let the heart of the Seeker be opened to that which shall rise invisible from the flames."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Grimol'ium Gl?nomosia Draco'Taus Let each and all beware in the Mysteries ofDracotai, the Sacred Vessel.

Such is the Book of Magistry that Thou, O' Seeker, should.st make for Thine own. THIS BOOK WHICH you are presently reading is a visible manifestation of the Subtil and In-visible Grammary of the Sorcerer's Arte. It is a revealed body of the Magical Teachings which have been transmitted through the hands of a Hidden Companie of Initiates, the Column of the Crooked Path. This manifest form of the Aethyric Grimoire exists in order to transmit the manifold empowerment of the Great Dragon Azhdeha and to impart the Magical Quintessence to all whom are called unto the Crooked Way. Because of the intent through which this Grimoire is revealed, the very possession of this book constitutes a unique means of magical succession: the lineage of the Dragon-book.

As the Serpent's seed is spread over the Good Earth, so shall the world be brought into the Unedged Field of Antient Blessing. May each grain in its season reveal the golden compass of Forbidden Eden: the Perfection of Our Sacred Land! The present book, being simply named in the vulgar tongue -'The Dragon-book of Essex', is but one recension of the Crooked Path's Teachings. Though borne through time and spirit-path by many hands - both visible and invisible, the Teachings are here gathered into the semblance of a Whole, and are presently set forth in the manner of a Compleat Enchiridion of the Arte Magical according to the principal artifice of but a single scribe. Yet in truth, the Path cannot be bound by any one such manifest expression; its nature is to transcend, to go beyond the present attainment and to deviate from its own self-revealed definitions. The present book is therefore offered as a foundation -as a cornerstone for the Temple-without-walls. From these pages, let the Journeyman take good counsel for his pilgrimage upon the ever-turning way. As the Eye of Vision has opened for the present scribe, so has he transcribed and here set forth the waymarks which are stationed at the hooks and crooks of the path.

The initiatic cord is therefore of three strands, each of which measures the height 'twixt the head and the heels of the Aspirant. The three strands have various symbolic interpretations. These may defined as the outer, inner, and secret teachings of the cord. These shall here be explicated according to the Arcana of the Crooked Path:-The outer interpretation defines the three strands as the umbilicus, the marriage-thread, and the noose. The birth-cord links the Seeker to the Womb of his Mother and represents the ancestry of the lineage into which he is being initiated. The marriage-thread represents the means for establishing the sacred bond - for tying the Endless Knot between the Initiator and the candidate. The noose is the death-rope and represents the path of futurity that links the Seeker to the grave and beyond. It is also the silent demonstrator of the fatality which befalls all who betray the trust of the Initiator. When woven together, the three strands become one cord and represent the unified power of past, present and future: the self-realised destiny of the initiand. According to the inner interpretation the three strands symbolise the lineal paths of em-powerment deriving from the Primordial Mother, Father and Child of the Crooked Path. The left-hand cord is for the empowerment ofLiliya and transmits the matrilineal succession of the Wise-blooded Mothers through the sisters and daughters ofLiliya to the life-blood of the pres-ent practitioner. The right-hand cord is correspondingly designated as the means for convey-ing the empowerment ofMahazhael, the Father and Corpse-king ofWitchblood. The central cord, analogous to the marriage-thread in the outer interpretation, represents the union of the Mother and Father in the body of the Child, thus the union of Lili ya and Mahazhael in the flesh of Cain. This signifies the coition of Life and Death within the present body of the practitioner. The secret interpretation of the Triple Cord concerns the Arcana of the Three Essences and is revealed within the Circle of Practise. Therefore let Those who would comprehend these Mysteries, step forth to trespass against the edge of all Worlds and by that deed gain entrance into the Blood-acre-the Domain of All-Betweenness. In keeping with the custom of the initiatic bestowal of the threefold cord and in accordance with the self-empowering nature of the Crooked Path, let the Spirit-guardian of the Path be called forth to possess the hand of the Seeker and to guide him in the deed of exacting the Sa-cred Measure by his own intent. Thus shall each Initiate claim the triune thread of destiny for themselves. Having cut the cord according to the measure 'twixt head and heels, the deeds of the path may be numbered there-upon by the tying of knots. By this means we may utilise a simple leathern cord throughout the manifold and divers praxes of the path to keep account of our progression, step by step and day by day. By such means the Initiatic Cord becomes the Witches' Rosary, the so-called 'Ladder of Knots'. Of this there are three principal forms used within this Grammar: the Lunar, the Solar, and the Stellar cord. All should be cut to the same measure, but may be of differing colours appropriate to their function. 3~"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"'Ihe E~ordia The lunar form of the knotted cord has two types. The first - the Rosary of Ka - may be used during the Hieros Gamos to bind and mark each digit of the lunar month. When complete with twenty-eight knots, this cord should be tied to the vessel at the time of its offering to the Midwinter fire. The second type of the lunar cord is the Rosary of the Black ~loon. This is used to mark and number the Dark Moon Rites throughout the year; as each performance of the Oracle Rite is concluded and as the Dragon-vessel is sealed anew, so let a knot be tied upon the cord. With the utterance of the Sorcerer's Cry of Power, let the knot serve to ensorcel and seal the rite. The Rosary of the Black Moon is the principal form of the lunar cord and should be kept year through year, for so long as the Seeker utilises the praxes of the Dark Moon Rite. If so desired a new length of cord may be cut with each new year. As time passes the Black Moon cords will thus increase in number and may be tied together at one end - together with the other forms of knotted cord-to create a scourge. This may then be used during the opening declaration of magical ceremonies to cleave the air asunder and open the way for the spirits to attend - with each utterance of the Sorcerer's Cry the scourge should be cracked as a whip and the lightning-swift pathway cast forth by the power of intent. The Solar cord is used to number and bind the annual celebration of the Midwinter Rite. Ide-ally, only one such cord need be cut in a practitioner's lifetime; for only once each year is a knot tied thereon. It is thus that this form of the Witches' Rosary is commonly called 'The Yearly Cord'. It serves as a record of the number of vessels which the Seeker has offered to the fire and of the number of times the complete Rite of Marriage has been fulfilled. The Stellar cord is used to number the stars ofDraconis: the fourteen digits of the Dragon's celestial body. Throughout the year, many praxes utilise the cycles of the lunar fortnight - pe-riods of fourteen nights - to measure the pathway of the fourteen sidereal zones of the Dragon. In such praxes a cord may be used as a mnemonic talisman, a knot being tied to mark each fulfilled session of practice. This being said, the principal and name-giving form of the Stellar cord is made during the Rite of Thu'ban, when the light of the fourteen Dragon-stars is drawn down into the Earthen Circle and the Sidereal Pact of the Crooked Path is once more revealed and renewed. In the annual celebration of this rite upon June 7th, it is customary for a knotted cord to be tied to number the steps of ritual pilgrimage and to seal the fourteen stellar empow-erments of Azhdeha. As it is so revealed, let the three strands of Moon, Sun, and Star be intertwined, even as the three strands of Time, bound in the Thunderous Scourge of Qayin. By the motion of this crooked flail, let the Aire of Ultimate Existence be rent in twain. Let the Gates of Wisdom be struck with the Serpent's flame and be flung wide to the coursing of our secret intent! 33"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl!nomosia Dra.co'Taus HERE FOLLOWETH THE EXPOSITION OF THE FOUR ELEMENTAL WEAPONS The Sceptre of Arte IN THE GREAT Mystery-rites and throughout the divers praxes of the Path, the Sceptre of Arte is born in the hand of the Seeker as the staff of the pilgrim. Its steadfast impress upon the earth counts the spaces between the Wanderer's steps and signifies the bridging of the way between the stations of the pilgrimage. As the journey is thus made by step and stave between horizon and horizon, the upright axis of the Sceptre continually reveals the secret nature of the pilgrimage: the perpendicular pathway between zenith and nadir. The Mage's staff imparts the manifold lessons of the Pathway Within; it signs the singular route between extremities, the septentrional road of internity that aligns the stars of Azhdeha to the constellated body of the Seeker's flesh in its ever-becoming as the Sacred Isle. Ascending and descending 'twixt the head and heels of the way, the Serpent of Flame is imaged in the graven moment of the Sceptre's wielding. And planted in the skin of the Good Earth, shall not the Wanderer's stave become the Very Tree of Eternity! Many are the forms of the Sceptre. Many are the arcana! Some are here disclosed at the place of the Threshold, and yet others -the true lessons of the pilgrimage - are scattered far and wide throughout this Grammary of Arte. There are three principal forms of the Magical Sceptre:-the Trident-stave, the Two-horned Stang, and the Wand. THE TRIDENT-STAVE THE TRI-FORKED STAFF is revered as the fire-blackened rod of Ka-i'ra, the Fifth and Hid-den Watcher of the Mystical Quadriga. Thus it is honoured as the Royal Sceptre of the Path's Unseen Initiator and as the magical rood-staff of destiny borne by the Spirit-guardian, the Un-known Intercessor of the Dragon's brood. In form, the Trident-stave is a columnic bough topped with three equidistant tines. In height, it is about equal to the measure between foot and shoulder, and in circumference is like unto the wrist of its mortal bearer. By custom, it is to be cut at noon from a hazel or yew tree -or from 34"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"'Ihe E~ordia such wood as is revealed unto the practitioner by dream, omen, or intuition. Once cut, the stave should be hewn, carved and decorated according to the skill and prowess of innate aesthesis. A customary adornment for covine use is to mark the personal sigillick insignia of all initiates upon the main length of the stave. It may thus serve as a memorial record of all who participate in these Mysteries and act as a sign of the unity that must reside betwixt brethren during the ordained times of their convocation. In the Great Mystery-rites of the Draconian Gnosis, the Trident-stave is used as a visible idol of Al Thuba', the World-tree, the so-called 'Tree of Uncounted Boughs'. Within the eidola of the Trident the World-tree is cognized as the manifold route between the stars of heaven and the field of earth, and -by the coursing of its roots -as the means toward communion within the abodes of the Ancestral Dead. Reifying the divine image of Al Thuba', the Trident-stave manifests the thrice-blessed spine of the Dragon and, by its evolving symbolism throughout the ritual year, unfolds the arcana of the World-tree as the conduit for the stellar flames of Wisdom within the rachidian axis of Man. Embodying the channel through which the Seeker is empowered with the ophidian radiances, or kalas, of the Heavenly Dragon, the Trident-stave symbolises both the course of the Pathway Within and the nature of its external counterpart -the Body of Otherness. In this understanding, we may consider the Trident to represent the triple axis oflunar, stellar and solar force between the head and heels of the practitioner and, furthermore, as the body of the ritual consort, the magical partner - priest or priestess, through which the Mysteries are secretly communicated and through which the sidereal powers of the Dragon are reified as the elixirs of the Agapae or Love-feast. In relation to the Agapae, the Arcana of the Three Essences, and the symbolic connection to the three channels oflineal empowerment, we may comprehend the three tines of the Trident-stave in the same manner of designation accorded to the inner teachings of the Sacred Cord. The left-hand tine represents the Powers ofLiliya, the Primordial Witch-queen; the right-hand tine represents the Powers of Mahazhael, the Primordial Witch-king; and thirdly, the central tine - the conduit of sidereal force - represents the Powers of their mystical biune progeny: the child, Cain (Qayin Azhaka). The Trident-stave may also be perceived as the visible emblem of 'The Column', both as the processional phalanx of initiates and as the pillar of celestial illuminance which stretches between the Draconick Pole of Heaven and the hearth of the ritual domain. The latter form provides the basis of mystical comprehension for the hypostates of the Trident-stave -the cen-tral hearth-pillars of wood-which are used in many rites to outwardly display the burning pathway 'twixt star, heart and hearth. In general observance the Trident-stave is unfixed in its position within the ritual domain; for as it is said-it is the Wanderer's Staff. If it is not required until a specific juncture of cer-emony-such as upon the Seventh Dragon-point in the Pilgrimages of Hu and Hua, then let it be planted in the ground at the far north of the ritual domain and there reside as the image of the Pathway beyond Reckoning. THE STANG THE STANG IS the name given to the Two-horned Sceptre of the so-called 'Presiding Devil'; for it is the Very Wand of Qayin, passed from the Time of Beginning to the hand of the Blood-acre's Magister or Magistra - to the Master or Mistress who is appointed as the vicegerent of the Unseen Initiator, thus to officiate at the convocations of the Dragon's brood. Although in all matters of this unique path, Qayin Azhaka is revered as the True Master -the First-born Initiate, and each practitioner alone is vicegerent unto his power, it is deemed 35"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Gl'imol'ium G~nomosia Dl'aco'Taus aright - according to the time-attested manners of the Arte Magical - for one initiate to serve as the chief officiant in rites of covine practise. In general observance, it is deemed that the inceptor or composer of a ceremonial procedure should serve thuswise, presiding in the North-at the so-called 'Place of Power'. In the manner of ritual observance utilised in the Fourfold Circle of the Quadrigan Covine, it is deemed that the appointed officiant should serve for but a year and a day at a time; thereafter the Stang-the emblem of that office -must be passed on to the hands of the appointed successor. Each initiate of a covine may therefore make their own stang, in order that they may rule with the stave of their own artifice; elsewise let a covine possess but a single rood of office and let this be passed on, even as the station of the North is passed on from Master to Master with the turning of the years. The rules of this succession are commented upon further below; see the sections of The Exordia concerning Seeker and Covine. Likewise, greater explication of the Stang and its ritual usage may be found in the appropriate sections within the Commentaries concerning the Three Ways of the Oracle Rite. In form, the Stang is a single bough, crooked or straight according to predilection, topped with two tines like unto the horns of a goat, and of such wood as the spirits decree. The two tines directly represent the horns of the Great Dragon Azhdeha and signify the dual means of Perpetuity and Instantaneity - the mystical 'Double-way' of Attainment concealed within the Arcana of the Crooked Path. In opposition to the attributions of the left-and right-hand tines of the Trident, the two horns of the Stang possess a reversed polarity of symbolism:-The left-hand tine of the Stang is considered to be 'the Horn of the Great Father Opposer' and comports the pathway of initiatic succession stretching from Teacher to pupil, mind unto mind, across the reach of centuries. To cognize this arcanum is to directly apprehend the out-ward display of the masculine force known as 'the Path of the Black Serpent'. This conveys the Teachings of the Undying Torch: the spiritual flame ofWitchblood's lineal catena. The right-hand tine is the 'Horn of the Great Mother Destroyer' and reveals the pathway of sudden intercession, the instantaneous route of divine revelatory gnosis. To cognize this arca-num is to directly apprehend the outward display of the feminine force known as 'the Path of the Red Serpent'. This conveys the Teachings of the Lightning-bolt. The dual means of the Black and the Red Serpent are unified in the body of the Stang to form the single stave of the Magister's power. The meeting of the two horns demonstrates the needful marriage between the continuity of ascetic discipline and the ever-changing course of instantaneous realisation, thus to beget the crossroads of true empowerment within the single-pointedness of the Seeker's Mind. The corpus of arcana relating to the Dual Means of Attain-ment is centralised within the Great Rite of Bha: the Mystery of the Dragon's Horns. In all rites, whether of single circle or ofDouble-ouroboros, the Stang is to be placed in the Northern station of the Blood-acre -the so-called 'First Circle' or 'Circle of Presence'. Thus, standing in the Borean Portal of the Compass-rose, the Stang is to be revered as a visible em-bodiment of Qayin Azhaka, the Grand Heresiarch of the Draconist Temple. In such devotion it should be understood that the presence of the Stang betokens the mindful emanation of the Ini-tiator to the Seeker, and likewise calls forth the mindfully visualised form of the Initiator from within the primordial consciousness of the aspirant. We should thus understand that the body of Qayin is the outward display, the magical appearance, of the Perfect Mind which realises the Quintessential Gnosis of Azhdeha. It is therefore deemed appropriate for each and all, alone or in covine, to offer honorific bows and genuflections unto the North, at both the beginning and the end of all magical ceremonies. In both mind and matter, let all render prostrations unto the Stave-mark'd Door of Septentrion, for thereby shall the Spirit of the Initiator come forth into the realm of manifest presence. 36"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"'Ihe EX!ordia THE WAND THE MAGICAL WAND is used for commanding and directing the spirits and powers that are raised and summoned within the many rites of sorcery. In these Mysteries, the wand has two principal forms. These may be understood as manifest hypostates of the Dragon's horns and may be regarded as mystical emanations from the dual tines of the Master's stang. The first form is the Straight Wand. This corresponds to the sinistral tine of the Stang and directly partakes in the symbolism of the Dragon's left horn. The Straight Wand is thus con-sidered to transmit the spiritual flame, the very numen of initiatory succession, from the First-born Sorcerer to the present practitioner ... and beyond, carrying the force of intent to its chosen destiny. The Straight Wand opens and points the way for the Path of Direction. In accordance with its representation of the direct succession from Master to pupil, the Straight Wand should be fashioned by the hand of one's own magical teacher and should be passed into one's hands during the time of induction into the path. Thus it has been taught of old, in the tradition from whence this Grammary is born. If such manners of the Royal Arte may be observed, then let the Seeker and Covine partake in such means of transmission. Yet, in both the making and the breaking of tradition, let it be here advised - in accordance with the Teachings of the Crooked Path -that the Seeker call forth the Spirit-guardian during the days of Ka and, by the unity of Man and Spirit, cut and fashion the Straight Wand of Arte. For thus shall it be passed in Truth from Master to aspirant, even in the moment of the unique realisation which bridges the divide of all aeons. In form, the Straight Wand should be fashioned from a single bough of wood, and in length should be equal to one's forearm - from elbow to fingertip. It should be taken at Dawn upon the day of the New Moon -cut with a single stroke from a tree deemed precious unto the Seeker's heart. The deed of its taking should be returned by an offering of blood, drawn by the Arthana from one's flesh and offered with thanksgiving unto the place of the severed bough. Once cut, the Wand is very much the image of its maker -rough and unhewn, untouched by either skill or artistry. Thus, as with the discipline of ordeal and task, we may shape ourselves, so with the skill of hand and eye, we may shape the vehicles of our intent. By such devotion as we would exert in our own self-creation, so let us hone and adorn the many instruments of Our Arte. If so desired, the Straight Wand may be made of bone. Such is most advantageous in rites of ancestral communion -whether with Man or Beast. If able, one should obtain the greater forearm bone (ulna) of a man or woman, and best if it be that bone is from the corpse of one esteemed powerful -whether in great hatred or in abundant love. For thus shall the bone be endowed with a spirituous vertu deemed most precious unto Our Sorcerous Arte. The tibia of either Man or Beast will likewise serve well as the Straight Wand and, from such a bone, scrap-ings may be taken at the times of the Dark Moon, to be fed as bone-powder unto the mouth of the Dragon's urn. As the Vessel is thus given of the Dead to eat, so shall the spirits of the Ances-tors be drawn into its depths from the place of their repose; and, in dwelling within the Athanor of Qayin, all Souls shall hearken to the Sorcerer's words -to rise and know breath in pleasure, or else to serve at his bidding. The second principal form is the Crooked Wand. This corresponds to the right-hand tine of the Master's Stang and directly partakes in the symbolism of the Dragon's dextral horn. The Crooked Wand is the vehicle for the powers of the Red Serpent and the Lightning-swift Path of Intercession. It is thus considered that the Crooked Wand may be utilised to convey the forces of sudden aleatory deviation; to augment the transcendent intervention of the sorcerer within a design of ordered nature and thereby to intercede within a seemingly fixed course of destiny, coercing all into unique deviation of intent. As the Straight Wand is used to command and di-rect, so the Crooked Wand serves to ensorcel, to coerce and to bind. 37"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoaia Draco'Taus In dimension, the Crooked Wand is like unto the Straight, being of similar length, but of different form. Ideally, it should be wrought from the bough of a lightning-struck tree, or taken from the twisted roots of the tree from whence the Straight Wand was cut. Elsewise, let it be taken from such a tree as the spirit decrees and let the hour of its birth be Dusk upon the Day of the Old Moon. In accordance with its intent, let it be hewn and adorned. If the sigildry of the Straight Wand be devised in blackest hues, then let the graven signs of the Crooked be stained with red-even with the very blood of sacrifice. Once hewn and fashioned in reflection of the Sorcerer's artifice, the Wands of Arte should be wrapped in silken cloth:-the Straight Wand in red and the Crooked Wand in black-according to the misrule of opposition. From the Grand Sceptre of the Heresiarch many emanations of power issue forth into the Circle of Manifestation, there to take form as the myriad staves held within the hands of the Dragon's brood. From the Triforked Staff of the Wanderer cometh forth the Horned Stang of the Presiding Master; from the twain horns of the Stang, the Wands of the Ascending Flame and the Descending Lightning-bolt; from the dual staves of light the Eightfold Ring of the Greenwood and the uncounted staves of Power held in the hands of Sky and Earth! All as one partake in Thee, O' Al Thuba; O' Thou Tree of a Million Boughs! The Cup THE RITUAL CUP, or Graal, is the wellspring of the Dragon's life-bestowing elixir. To drink from the Cup is to incline one's lips to the womb of one's own begetting, even unto the roseate lips of the Primordial Blood-mother Lili ya; to drink is to acknowledge the Pact of Great Return, to partake in the wine that contains the fullness of this Gnosis and to knowingly enter the Great Year's Wheel - the cycle of Initiatic Self-transmutation. To drink is to receive the Wisdom of the Path in full and, in the same moment, to forget; it is to accept the challenge of the Interces-sor: to turn bane to blessing, to re-member the Wisdom Entire. Whether of finely turn'd wood or oflustrous gold, let the Mind behold the Cup as the im-age of the ever-open vessel of Azhdeha, as a gateway through which one may enter - to sup deep from the Starry Well of the Initiator - to behold oneself mirror'd in the Abyssal Waters 38"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The E~ordia ofKa'ira. To drink and sate oneself upon the blood of all sacrifice is truly to take succour from the Serpent's mouth, to fulfil the promise of the Cup's bestowal: that its form should be as a gift from the Seeker's Beloved. Verily, to drink is to receive the Love beyond all mortal knowing-the Love that transcends aught in Life or Death. Therefore, to the Cup of your own choosing, let the content of your heart be emptied. Thus, by your own deeds, the Cup shall hold the purity or the perfidy of this Path. Upon the appointed occasions of darkness, when the Dragon's Urn is visibly opened, the Cup is used to receive and co-mingle all offerings of blood, sexual emissions, saliva, wine, perfume, ashes, bone-dust and so forth - before they are poured into the Sovereign Vessel. The Ritual Cup is thus revered as the heart of the Crooked Path's Intercessor -as the Instrument of Media-tion between the life-blood of the Servitor-vessels and the open' d mouth of the Great Draco nick Athanor. Even as the Cup of the Seeker shall minister betwixt the mouths of the Elemental At-tendants and the Dragon-vessel, so shall the Graal of the Covine minister betwixt the mouths of the Four Watchers and the fiery tongue of Qayin Azhaka. TheArthana THE ARTHANA rs the name herein accorded unto the Sorcerer's Knife of Conjuration. Also called the 'Athamay', its name signifies 'that which cuts' or 'that which divides'. To contemplate the double-edge of the Arthana's blade is to mindfully approach the realisa-tion of the Crooked Path's essential nature. For it reveals the Path of Sudden Change, the trans-mutative power which may liberate or destroy; and which, like the knife, may cut through the bonds of fateful imprisonment or sever the very flow oflife. As the edge of the Arthana reveals the double-handed means of this swiftly-turning way, so the tip of its blade reveals the focus of intent -the pinnacle uniting and transcending all dualities. Through the ritual gestures of the Arthana - its turning betwixt the flesh of the Seeker and the skin of all Other-the transliminal Way of Betweenness is demonstrated. The Arthana's exaction of the self-sacrificial deed directly reveals the wordless understanding of the Draconick Gnosis unto the body. It is thus that the touch of the Arthana upon the skin of the Seeker por-tends the dance of the Aspiring Mind upon the tortuous route of the great ritual pilgrimage. By the very motion of our body through the ordeals of the Path -by the needful immersion of the Self in the alchymical tasks of the Dragon-road, we are opened to the spaciousness of the \\'oidful Beyond .... to the infinity of Gnosis Within. By the offering of our own blood, both in mind and in matter, we signify the sacrificial divi-sion of all mortal flesh. By such direct means, Man is divided upon the wheel of the seasons and is cast across the face of the Sacred Land. For it is through the fulfilment of the pilgrimage that the body may attain unto its Great Re-membrance: the accomplishment of its mystical entirety as the Isle of the Mage's Perfection. As with the Magical Sceptre, there are three principal forms or hypostates of the Arthana:-the Sword, the Dagger, and the Nowl-spike."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomoaia Draco'TaUtJ THE SWORD THE SWORD IS revered as the greater form of the Arthana's embodiment of the Crooked Path. According to lore, the double-edged sword represents the divine form of the plough-blade or jaw-bone, the weapon whereby Cain, the First-born Child of Liliya, slew Abel, the infidel by whose very death we signify the transmutative sacrifice of all profanity. Throughout the Great Rites of the Year, the sacrificial deeds mystically accorded unto the Sword of Cain convey the esotery of Exile and Resurrection. Similarly, the symbolic process of forging, shaping and hon-ing the sword is used to convey the alchymic transformation of the initiate. In congregational ritual, the chosen sword of a covine should serve as the sovereign weapon of the Circle's Presiding Magister. It should be wielded according to the directions of the spirit, to delineate the motion of intent, and to cut through all obstruction. At the inception of a rite it may be used to trace the outline of the chosen working area, most especially to ceremonially cut the peripheral finitor of the Blood-acre. This is the magical deed of 'cutting the endless furrow' and in its accomplishment Man is known as 'Meimun' - the horse beloved of Cain. The two edges of the Sword-blade reveal the nature of the Path as the Dual Way of Ascent and Descent. The Sign of the Upraised Sword displays the Path of Ascendant Realisation, the instantaneous cutting through of all fields and aires of bound awareness. The gesture of the heavenward blade delineates the course of the Mind penetrating the veils of appearance, the ascent of consciousness to the very pinnacle of dimensionless ipseity. Conversely, the Sign of the Earth-cleaving Blade displays the Path of Descendant Reification; it comports the epiphanic fall of the lightning-bolt, the insurgence of sidereal numen into the incarnative matrix of the Sorcerer's flesh. It is said in lore that the Hidden Gateway at the centre of the Blood-acre is guarded by the Whirling Sword of Azh'ra-il-a blade of limitless reach, continually revolving in all possible directions. None may pass beyond its guard, save those who grasp its secret-who may place their step upon its ever moving tip and attain to the Dance of Leaping Stillness. In this arcanum, the Mystery of Al Zin Surat, the dual means of the Arthana are one. The sovereign role of the Great Sword is further attested by its function as an object upon which oaths of fealty and ascetic discipline may be sworn. Embodying the unyielding nature of the Path, its form is deemed most worthy of this service. In covine practise, it is the duty of the Presiding Magister to wield the Sword in this role, to both receive and bear witness to the taking of an oath. In isolate practise, the Intercessor of the Path is called into the blade and by its touch, the blessing or curse of the Initiator's tutelage is conjoined in the deed of our pact. In all such acts we are as new aspirants standing at the circle's edge, awaiting the challenge of the Blood-acre's Ward: the ordeal of the Invisible Watchers. By the touch of the Sword to our bared breast we realise the penalty of betrayal and yet swear knowingly to the poise of heart needful to our attainment. By the touch of the Sword-point to the crown of our head, we are shown the secret burden of the Royal Arte; and by the touch of the blade-edge to our feet, the narrow way is opened before us -the transliminal route of Divine Trespass which leads into the Kingdom of Qayin Azhaka. THE DAGGER THE DAGGER, OR Short Sword, is the magical weapon most generally used to manifest the dual powers of the mystical Arthana. As the Great Sword of the Magister is beheld as the Jawbone-adze of Cain's primordial victory, so the Dagger of the Seeker is revealed uniquely unto each-to be possessed as a veritable image of a razor-edged tooth from the Dragon's jaw. For as the 40"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"'Ihe&ordia blade of the True Aspirant must cut the World-skin and thus open the way into the Divine Body of the Old Serpent, so the fang must turn - to slay all and aught that is profane unto the blood of Eld. Both as one, Man and Serpent shall murder and marry the Other. In matters of practise, the Dagger is wielded for many and divers purposes, all of which are united in the intent to transect and mediate between the realms of spirit and flesh. The Dagger is thus utilised to cut through the veils of the Circle's subtil aire and to cleave wide the Gates which open betwixt the Worlds. It is used to cut the flesh and let fall the offerings of blood; to cut and to shape the wooden staves of Arte; to trace the God-dreamed Signs of Calling and Sending; and to command and guide the wayward spirits that are held 'neath the Mage's do-minion. In form, let the Dagger be chosen or forged by each practitioner according to need. By Crooked Blade and Straight Blade, the Powers of the Arthana shall be shown to none but Those deemed worthy to receive the blessing of the Antient One's kiss. THE NAIL OR NOWL THE NAIL OR Nowl is a spike of wood, horn, or, most usually, metal. It is fashioned like unto a long coffin-nail or harrow tine, and is uniquely adorned according to the aesthesis of its bearer. In purpose, the Nowl is used to ritually impale a point of ritual focus, such as the middle of a cross-roads or a node within an earth-sign. By the act of driving the Nowl-spike into the earth, one creates a visible zone of empowerment around which an enchantment may revolve and cen-tre itself. The single point of the magical nail opens and transfixes the hot-point of intent and visibly displays the One-pointedness of Mind implicit within the sorcerous act. It is thus that the Nowl is revered as the earthen image of the Axis of Heaven -at one with the immutable location and radiance of the so-called 'Golden Nail', the Antient Draconick Pole-star whose name is Al Thu'ban. A further use of the Nowl is to demarcate an area intended for ritual use. Several such nails are required for this purpose; one for each angle or corner of the field to be hallowed. Each nail is to be driven into the earth at the limits of the chosen plot and then tied by a coloured thread. (For an example see 'The Wreath of Seven Laughing Skulls'.) Before use the Nowl-spike - alone or in multitude - must itself be consecrated. The cus-tomary method is to bind the weapon to the vessel at Midwinter and allow it to pass through the flames - to glow with the fires of the Dragon's pyre and be blessed with the Mystery of the Nail-That-Never-Cools. Further knowledge pertaining to the Arthana is contained within the following enchantment, which is itself to be used as a spell of consecration. Blessed art Thou, O' Arthana: Sword, Knife and Now!! Blessed art Thou by the Running River, cleansed in the flow of Seven Waters. Blessed art Thou, O' Spirit exacting of the Blood-oath.

And as there are many modes and means of such arcana, so are there many forms of the Disk; the principal forms of which are the Coin, the Ring, the Amulet, the Pentacle, and the Paten. THE COIN ACCORDING TO THE custom of our practice, the Aspirant to the Royal Arte should fashion a magical talisman like unto a great coin - being of no worldly currency or fixed denomination. This coin is known as the Sabbatick Token and is intended to serve its Bearer as a Sign of Secret Wealth in the Worlds of Gods and Spirits. It may be wrought of metal, clay, or bone, -of such substance and ornament as befits the aesthesis and artifice of the Seeker and his Brood. In the hypostate of the magical coin, the Disk is traditionally used as a silent means of recognition between the brethren of a covine. One side should bear the Sign of its Maker, whilst the obverse should bear an especial design: an insignia unique unto the covine and its purpose. When time and distance scatter the members of a conclave, when the Pact of the Brood is passed on beyond the knowledge of all brethren, then shall the coin serve well as the Password betwixt the Blessed of Sight. Upon all occasions of formal ritual observance the coin is used as a sign of fellowship be-twixt the Seeker and the Spirit-guardians of an Hallow'd Ground of Arte. Bearing the coin, one should approach the entrance into the circle. One should then kneel and make solemn entreaty unto the Spirit-ward of the site and, when ready, one should pass the coin over the ashen border. Laying the coin upon the ground, one should then stand and enter the circle by the ordained means of the Witches' Step. In addition to the offering of the Sabbatick Token, a secondary of-fering-that of a common and worldly coin - may be made before entry: the coin being cast across the threshold and into the central hearth. (For the inner and outer offerings of the coin and the Deed of the Witches' Step, see 'Teme-nos: The Circle') Upon chosen occasions of a covine's assembly, when so decreed by the Presiding Master or Mistress, an especial form of Sabbatick Token may be required of each aspirant, solely for the distinct purpose of gaining entrance into the concealed domain of a specific rite. In such an instance, the form and design of the token should serve to express the aspiration of the Seeker to enter the rite and should display his intent to gain the secret knowledge that lies within its realm. When so fashioned for the purpose of a single ritual the token acts as a Sign that the Aspirant has fulfilled the necessary acts of preparation for the rightful undertaking of the Mys-terium. For an example of such, see 'The Rite of the Turnskin'. THE RING IN THE WORKING of these Mysteries it is customary for the brethren of a covine to wear a magical ring, most often a seal ring bearing the insignia of the Dragon or some design unique unto the circle of practitioners. In this hypostate of the Disk, the magical ring functions in the same manner as the Sabbatick Token -as a silent means of recognition betwixt the initiates of a covine. 44"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The ERordia For those whom it pleases, let the Ring of the Dragon's brood be wrought, even as a Sign of the Marriage-pact 'twixt the blood-lines of Serpent and Man. Let the Seal of Azhdeha be engraved upon the crown of this precious circlet; and upon the shoulders and band thereof, let the secret name and sigil of its wearer be 'scribed. Let none wear this token of betrothal 'til the Rite of Ka is fulfilled. THE AMULET A DREAM'o SIGN of the Quintessence wrought anew in manifest substance, such is the most noble and powerful form of the Amulet. For it is a visible display of the Arcanum of Incarna-tion: the Wisdom that makes the Spirit to know breath upon the Earth. Yet many are the means whereby the Dream is revealed, not solely by the path beyond the veils of sleep. The signs and objects of power may be shown by the opening of the Eye to the Dance of the Intercessor - by the purification of the Sight unto the revelation of Chance: the augur writ in the patterns of sky and cloud, in earth and stone, in flowing river and shimmering pool, even in the roiling expanse of night and in the hearth-fire that flickers below. Whether made manifest from dreams, wrought by sudden inspiration, or found by chance as an hagstone or bone, the amulet should be intuitively realised as sacred to its bearer and should be worn at all times as a sign of one's residence 'neath the guardianship of the Gods. Those whom are desirous of possessing an amulet filled with the numen of this Path should make entreaty to the Daemon of the Dragon-vessel. When Intent is placed in faithful silence and the Desire itself is fallen into the vessel's mouth, then - as with all such Wishes -it shall become Truth. THE PENTACLE, OR TALISMAN PROPER As THE AMULET denotes the magical blessing freely bestowed by the Gods upon the Seeker and is worn as a sign of protection from all profane forces and influence, so the Pentacle or Spirit-seal denotes the power of the practitioner's intent to bind or direct a force or spirit to serve him in a specific task or function. In practise, the Pentacle is customarily a small metal or waxen disk-about the size of a hand-palm, upon which a sigillic design is engraved and into which a spirit is called forth and bound by the Mage's command. The magical operations for the making of the Pentacle and for the calling-forth of its empowering spirit are to be undertaken at times germane unto their specific qualities and nature. Similarly, the substance used to make the Pentacle must be at one with the nature implicit to the task, and indeed must be most pleasing in quality and form as a residence for the spirit. For instance, if a Pentacle were to be made to bind a spirit belonging to the Conclave of the Great Rite of Tan, the chosen substance would be lead or dark blue wax, the day of its shaping would be Saturday and the hours chosen for its engraving and spiritual empowerment would be between 4.3opm and 7.3opm. (See Tables of Correspondence). Once made and filled with the spirit's power, the Pentacle should be wrapped in a cloth of suitable colour and carried upon the person of the initiate for so long as it is required. Such talismans may be used throughout the course of the Draconick Rites to call forth spirits pos-sessing concealed knowledge germane unto the many ordeals of the Path. ·when the season of the talisman's intent has passed, the Pentacle should be bound into the cloth-wrappings of the Dragon-vessel upon the tide of the Moon's darkness; thus all shall be aligned-season through season -unto the greater design of the Mage's attainment. 45"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Grimoriwn G)!nOmosia Draco'Taus If a Pentacle would be made to serve as the repositoire of a Guardian or Familiar Spirit, then let its form and substance be revealed by dreams and by entreaty unto the Sacred Vessel. When the form has been made in accord with the directions of the Intercessor, the talisman should be charged with the spirit's breath at the time of the Vessel's opening. With regard to the sigils that are to be engraved upon a Pentacle -these are customarily the geometric forms representative of its intended power and the magical names by which its spirit or force is called and directed. The basic or root-form of the Pentacle is the Sign known as the 'Witches' Foot', the Pentagram or Fivefold Star. This serves for the continual purpose of align-ing the five sensory forces of the practitioner's own perception unto the Subtil Aires or Powers of the Arte Magical. THE PATEN FOR THE PURPOSE of formal definition distinctions may be made between the different forms of the Disk. In the unique mode of practise used by each individual such distinctions will merge and overlap. In the talisman known as the Paten the divers forms of the Disk unite in an admix-ture of sigil, geometric design and representative insignia, thereby demonstrating the unitive nature of the Arcana of Manifestation. In simple terms, the Paten is a flat round of wood, clay, wax or metal, about a forearm's length in diameter. Upon its surface the Great Circle of the Initiate's Understanding is to be depicted in the manner of a single design. It thus serves as a mirror for the Crooked Path -both for the Blood-acre 'neath the Seeker's heels and for the Stars of Azhdeha coiling above his head. If made with skill and insight, the Paten should function as a mnemonic for the cycle of the Ritual Year, displaying unto the Eye of its Maker the pattern of the Path from its origin to the present moment. As the arcana of the Disk are revealed beyond these meagre words, so let their magistry be ex-ecuted in all such media of artistry as befits the Seeker's Vision. Upon parchment and paper, let their tracery be 'scribed-that the spirits may find voice in the flames of the Black Sun's pyre. Upon flags and banners of richly coloured cloth, let their sigildry be emblazon'd-thus to show forth the regal harlequinade of Qayin Azhaka, dancing upon the winds of the Compass-rose though all the seasons of the Circle's round. And upon the Good Earth 'neath the Seeker's Step, as Earth-signs for the Spirit-procession, so let the patterns of the Disk's Arcana be cast down from the Starry Heights unto the Substance of Our Carnal Self-begetting! 46"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The EA?ordia.

THE BONE-TRUMPET THE SORCERER'S TRUMPET is to be made from a human femur, best stolen from the grave of a saint or a criminal, elsewise taken from the corpse of one's brother in Arte. If a human bone cannot be obtained, then a femur from a beast such as a deer or dog will serve, otherwise a horn from a goat may suffice. The femur should be cut at the smaller end to form a mouth-piece for blowing and carved at the greater end to form a larger mouth - from whence the songs of the spirits may issue into the air. Once cut and shaped, the bone should be decorated with sigildry and stained with inks, thus to become a worthy stave and instrument for the Mage's power. In many rites the Bone-trumpet is blown to herald the beginning of a convocation and to rouse the spirits to conjoin in the elation of the covine. In rites of ancestral evocation and pro-pitiation, the trumpet is sounded to call the great assembly of gods and spirits to the presence of the sorcerer. Because of its great power, let none but the owner of the Bone-trumpet cause it to speak. Blessed be Thee, O' Trumpet of Bone, for in Thy Calling the Voice of the Primal Ancestor breaks forth from the Tomb. Let Thy Song resound aloud throughout the Aeon, to rouse and summon within the Antient Conclave all those who are born of the Fire. As the Breath passeth from my lips to whirl within Thy Sepulchre, so do I give Life to mine own Death within the Dragons Embrace.

Amongst such objects of sorcerous artistry we may count the day-wrought idols and the wood-en figures of spirits; the waxen effigies used in charms of invultuation; the bead-netted gourds of the Serpent's rattle; the withies and boughs, thread-bound with prayers in the hours of medi-tation; the bone-staves graven with sigils and carved with the forms of beasts; the rosaries and necklaces, strung with beads to count the mantic words of enchantment and remembrance . .\\lany are the fetishes of the Path, numerous as the arcana of the Seeker's intent. The deeds of the Fetish-maker serve to convey the myriad nuances of Understanding through the Body of Flesh as the Unsaying Knowledge of the Heart: the Silent Wisdom of Pure Sensa-tion.

THE BOWL OF OFFERING: THE PAUPER'S BOWL OF PLENTY THE BOWL OF Offering, oft' times call'd 'The Beggar's Bowl', is used in both solitary and covine obsen·ance as a microcosmic likeness of the Magical Circle, even as an image of the Blood-acre's own heart. For thus, in making offerings to the bowl, one places the gifts of the spirit upon the hot-point of the Circle's midst-even into the Fire that burns with the Flame Invisible. The bowl may be wrought of wood, clay, or metal, and in form should be of sufficient circum-ference so as to accommodate a fully adorned vessel, or of such a size that a human skull could rest \"ithin its compass, untouching of the bowl's own edge. It should be carved or engraved with signs depicting the Mysteries of the Eight Directions: the Sigillae of the Great Rites of the Year. In covine observance the bowl may be used in a number of divers manners, most often during rites incorporating a process of ritual pilgrimage. In such a procedure of enchantment, the bowl li placed in turn upon the hot-points of the pilgrimage - the auspicious nodes within the cer-emonial path; this deed is considered to create an alignment betwixt each point in turn and the cenrral hearth of the Blood-acre. Upon each point the bowl is used as a recipient for offerings such as coins, flowers, bread, wine, blood, and so forth - each offering simultaneously feeding boch Circle-heart and hot-point. In solitary observance it is customary for the bowl to stand upon the domiciliary shrine of the practitioner; within it the Dragon-vessel is placed to signify the location of the Sacred Urn n the mystical centre of the Great Magical Finitor."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium 6)!nomo6ia D.raco'TaWJ O' Thou Bowl of Cain, the Royal Pauper, Be Thou the Beggar's Bowl of Untold Plenty!

THE ROBE AND RITUAL APPAREL THE CUSTOMARY RITUAL garment worn by the practitioner of these Mysteries is a robe, a long and flowing hooded gown, sewn of fine cloth and tied with a belt or sash. Since the robe should be made according to the unique artifice of its wearer, its design and colour shall vary from one to another. For some it is best if the robe is of a colour that merges with the hues of the ritual domain -marrying the flesh with both the body of the night and the weave of the land. Yet for others it is best if the robe strikes the eye with clarity, in great distinction from all else -thus to merge the sorcerer with the impress of all Other. The belt used to tie the robe may be hung with bells and other fetish-objects, thus to bespeak the body's motion in dance and step. A magical seal may be used as the buckle, serving as a 5~"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"'Ihe Ei!ordia protection and as an empowerment to the flesh. Sashes may be worn in many ways,-around the waist, slung around the shoulders, or hung-snake-like from the Mage's belt -to form a secondary skirt around the robe. Their colour should be fitting to the Mystery being worked. If so desired, a covine may utilise the colour attributions of the Great Rites and Degrees of Attainment to dictate the colour of the sashes to be worn by its initiates (see 'The Fourteen Steps of the Draconist Temple'). According to season, a cloak may be worn over the main robe. This should be decorated with feathers, beads and bones, and be sewn with signs auspicious to both the Path and the attain-ment of its wearer. Given the duration of the Great Rites it is needful that the chosen ritual apparel be of suffi-cient warmth in the coldest seasons of the year and yet may be simplified-stripped down - to serve in the hottest days of the Sun's embrace. In solitary observance and for those that desire, let all garments be cast aside and let the skin alone be the raiment of power. Whether of cloth or ash-besmeared skin, the apparel of the Mage is the flayed pelt of the World-turned inside out to show the reversal of all in the Magistry of the Sorcerous Mind. THE SKULL IN ALL OF the Great Rites of the Draconian Gnosis the presence of Cain, the First-born Sor-cerer, is signified by a human skull. By Tradition, the skull is set atop the Magister's Staff in the Northern Airt of the Blood-acre. From thence it serves as the Gateway through which the Spirit of Cain may enter the circle and preside as the Invisible Master over all the rites and praxes of the Path. The arcana of the skull are manifold and are revealed as ritual empowerments of knowledge through the course of time as each aspirant wends his way through the ordeals of the Dragon-road. It is best if the skull is passed down through the lineages of the covine, even as the head of the Ancestor passed down to the Children of Today. Elsewise let the skull be obtained by the bless-ing of the Intercessor and by the ingenium of the covine. If a human skull cannot be obtained, then let an image be wrought in wood, clay or wax - thus to serve as the Idol of the Initiator until such a time when the Death's-head shall be revealed in truth.

THE TURNING OF THE DRAGON-WHEEL OF TIME THE TABLE DELINEATES an exemplary model of the procedural sequence by which the aspi-rant may work through the divers arcana of the Grimoire and provides the means to understand how the Dragon-wheel of Time may be turned from year to year. In truth, the table demon-strates the sequence of practices in an idealistic manner, such as befits the Pure and the Perfect Aspirant of the Way. For the sake of our general usage, and given the profound nature of the many ordeals upon the path, it is oft' times deemed wise to make certain adaptations to the practices in order to facilitate their overall efficacy as initiatory processes. It is the custom of Our Arte-observed by those whom have practised these Mysteries through many a year and a day-to maintain the foundations of praxis throughout each year:-the Marriage Rite, the Midwinter Rite, the regular practice of the Stellar Transvocation, the working of the Oracle Rite at each Dark Moon, and the Yearly Convocation of Thu'ban. These are considered to be the needful basics of the Crooked Path Sorcery as expressed through the Mysteries of the Dragon. The arcana of these fundamental aspects of the Path are given in the relevant sections of the book. Aside from these foundation practices there are seven major rites throughout the year. These are known as the 'Seven Revealed Heads of the Dragon' and are referred to by the simple root-names of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua. The subtil tides of power, the currents of time 61"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomoeia Draco'Taus through which the 'Seven Heads of Wisdom' are revealed, are customarily ushered into the Circle of Earth by the celebration of their especial arcana: the Seven Great Mysteries. The full textual forms of these, as given herein, are known as the Grand Oratorial Recensions and con-stitute the initiation-rites of the seven tides. The practised forms of these should vary from year to year by vertu of natural progression and through the deepening of comprehension. In the light of practice and by vertu of much journeying upon the Path, it is advised that the solitary aspirant or covine should undertake the Grand Oratorial Recensions in their exemplary forms at least once before adapting and refining their text and application. For it is only through actuative deed that their arcana can truly be understood. Nonetheless, each tide of the Sacred Year should be marked and celebrated in one manner or another,-whether alone or in covine, by grand rite or by simple offering. Although the Seven Great Rites and their subsidiary practices are presented throughout this book in the manner of a ritual cycle to be undertaken in a fixed period of time, it may be wise for some to approach the whole as a system of initiatory grades. (For which see 'The Fourteen Steps of the Draconist Temple') The full ritual forms of the Mysteries may be then worked as and when deemed appropriate over the course of many years, whilst nonetheless maintaining the foundations of practice and a basic celebration of the sacred tides in each annual cycle. Such attenuation permits a gradual comprehension of the true and unwritten forms of the Myster-ies and should enable the solitary practitioner or covine to partake in the essential vitality and self-evolving nature of the Path. It should be understood that the exemplary texts of the Mysteries are herein presented to serve as gateways into the Wordless Arcana of the Dragon-road, and are intended to open a way of initiation within which one may develop and refine one's own unique mode of practice. Such ritual texts, whether as given herein or as secretly passed on through the lineages of initia-tion, can only ever represent the crystallisation of the way at any one time. As a living tradition of Sorcery, the essence of the Crooked Path lies within the very flesh, mind, and spirit of its children .. .in this present moment and throughout the many generations of its heredity. By one means the ophidic numen of the Path is transmitted through the catena of initiatory succession and, by another, it strikes forth in sudden, unexpected illumination. These are the Two Ways, known in unity as the Double-way of the Crooked Path; they are both opposite and equal, and yet are identical to the One who walks upon the ever-deviating coils of the Serpent. Whosoever truly passes through the Twofold Gate, whosoever truly enters this Way, will know that there can be no fixed form, no scripture or idol that will not pass through the fire of the longest night. All must be sacrificed to the Forge of Qayin - to the very source of initiation. For thus the Eternal Transmutable Point of Our Sorcerous Ancestry becomes the Open Way of Liberation. 6~"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The ENordia Temenos The Ritual Domains of Shrine, Blood-acre and Double-ouroboros THERE ARE THREE principal forms of magically demarcated area used within the Draconian Mysteries:-the personal or domiciliary shrine, the single circle and the double-circle. THE SHRINE SOLITARY AND AUTONOMOUS magical practice forms the disciplinary basis of Crooked Path Sorcery. A personal shrine is therefore necessary, simply as a basic area for the regular practise of the Arte. The shrine is best positioned within a private area of one's dwelling-place, where no-one else may intrude or enter without invitation. In practical terms it may take the form of a low table upon and around which the divers requisites of the Arte may be placed, and before which one may sit and move with ease of body and access. If circumstance so requires, it may be deemed needful to veil or disguise the area of the shrine from the eyes of cowans,-this may be accomplished by guile or by construction. Let it be remembered that the form and appearance of the shrine should befit its purpose as the feast-table of the spirits and to this service it should be dedicated with prayer and with suit-able offerings of incense and libation. An animal-hide, signifying the flayed pelt of all living, may be spread before it, to be used as a seat for meditation and as a floor for ritual dance and posture assumption. Cloths of suitable materials and colours may be used to delimit the borders of the consecrated area and to decorate the surrounding walls. Bones, peacock-feathers and snake-skins are to be placed and hung in abundance; for being most pleasing to the Guardians of the Path, these have become a custom-ary and beloved manner of adornment for the altar of these mysteries. The magical vessel should be placed at the focus of the shrine to create the centre for the subtil horizon of the Arte. A single candle may be placed atop the vessel, or else one at each side, as is deemed appropriate to form and purpose. The candles should be white in hue at the beginning of the path and should be changed in colour to befit the season and nature of one's practice. The lighting and extinguishing of the candles should be used to respectively signal the beginning and end of any working procedure. Likewise the fumigation of the shrine with incense is deemed germane - to both hallow the sacred domain and to propitiate the guardian spirits. All manner of divers effigies and masks, all icons and images of the gods, demons, saints and spirits of the world may be offered upon the shrine; for all shall come to serve upon the Crooked Path through the many seasons of faith. All images may suffice in their time and place, yet of the Dragon - the Ever-changing and All-transmutable - no fixed form or image is possible. Such is the lesson taught in the rise and fall of the Sacred Vessel. According to this counsel and by the unique artifice of imagination, let the shrine be estab-lished in both mind and in flesh; for in every time and place the shrine may be built in freedom as an offering to the Elder Gods. If time and place permit visible manifestation, then let its ap-pearance expound the sublime aesthesis of the Mysteries. If time and place do not permit out-\\\\ClI'd expression, or if but meagre forms are present, then let the world be transformed through imaginal empowerment and let no limit be placed upon the splendour of the mind's creation."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl!nomo6ia Draco1Tau6 Blessed be Thee, O' Shrine of Azhdeha!

Blessed be Thee, O' Shrine of Azhdeha! Be Thou wrought in mind, be Thou graven in flesh; to the Ways of Our Arte Thou art born. THE CIRCLE IN THE TRADITIONAL working of the Cunning Arte, whether alone or in covine, the ritual domain of the magical circle forms the compass of the World-field: the lair of Serpent and Man. In solitary practise the circle is imagined and projected by the mind as a sphere of clear and flawless light encompassing the body of the magician, pervading and purifying all that he so desires. Within this grimoire the teachings used for the praxis of casting and binding the circle are known as 'Hallowing the Kingdom of Qayin'. For the purpose of the covine - the gathering of fellow seekers upon the Path, the knotting and the banding together of compatriots in the Blessed Isle -the magical circle is to be traced out upon the ground using consecrated powders to form a visible boundary. The border of the circle is perceived as the finitor of existence, a transliminal horizon, describing the manifest edge of the omnipotent domain of magick. The circle is the secret kingdom of interstices: a world between each and every realm of being. Its nature is that of a paradoxical divide betwixt all within and all beyond, and yet it is the mirror wherein the totality of the cosmos is beheld and bound unto the earthly design of sorcerous intent. The single circle of Arte is oft' times referred to as 'The Blood-acre'. This signifies its percep-tion as the place of worldly sacrifice and as the domain wherein the Mystery of Betrothal and Betrayal is revealed. The ordained site for the on-lay of the magical circle should be chosen by the guidance of the spirits. One should be led unto its place by such guidance as is born from the augur of dreams and beast-calls, from the wind-moved boughs of the forest and the voice of the sky. It is best 64"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"'Ibe E~ordia for the site to be in some lonely place, such as woodland or forgotten graveyard, in cave or in hollow,-in such a place where no outsider is likely to witness you or trespass upon you during a rite. Careful consideration should also be given to the orientation of the site,-to the position of crees and stones; for such may often serve as a natural demarcation of the compass. To relate from the present observance of Arte and thus illustrate from exemplar, it is custom-ary for the site to lie deep within woodland, in an area to which one must journey for the espe-cial purpose of working. This permits the land to teach the lessons of the pilgrimage through the changing seasons of the year. Upon the day of working the companie should journey to the site with due reverence to their intent; each step of their pilgrimage bringing the mind, body and soul of all to the same place,-co the chosen cross-roads of fate: the meeting-ground of Man and Spirit. On reaching the site it is best to spend some time in quiescence, laying one's soul into the hands of the earth, preparing oneself for the task ahead and entreating the land accordingly. All requisites, instruments and so forth should be left outside of the intended ritual area until certain preliminary tasks have been fulfilled. Then, when all are rightly assembled, the site should be thoroughly swept of unwanted soil and leaves to reveal a bare ring of earth. The circle should be swept from the centre outward, so that when all ritual work has been fulfilled the site may be covered over and lie hidden once again. For the initial clearing of the circle it is best to use one's feet to scrape away the topmost layer; a fallen bough, bracken brush or besom may then be used to sweep and scourge 'til the kingdom lies pure. The entire task should be considered identical to the preparation of the covine and the aspirant's own being: the clearing a\";ay of unwanted states of mind, and the purification of all awareness within the sole intent of the Mystery. For the use of the Quadriga the circle should be about twenty-two paces in circumference. \\\\'hen the naked form of the circle has been clearly established, sufficient fire-wood should be gathered so as to last for the duration of the work in hand. This should be laid in a central hearth to form a pyre-mound, ready to be lit at the ordained time during the rite. Surplus firewood should be laid around the perimeter of the site, to be used as and when required. Ac the centre of the hearth a single upright column of wood is to be placed. This should be forked at the top like a snake's tongue and should surpass the height of any mortal present. The hearth-stave is to serve as a ladder for the spirits of the dead to ascend out of the earth and for che spirits of the sky to climb down to the world of men. At the top of the column a wreath is to be placed,-of flowers, corn, berry-laden boughs or thorns according to the season of the ~-ear. Further decorations of feathers, ribbons and mommets may also tied to the pillar. During che rite, as the fire begins to rise, the wooden column will ignite; its burning axis opening the way between the abyss of height and depth. If weather or purpose dictate that no great fire be needed, candles should be used for the presence of flame. When the pyre-mound has been constructed in the midst of barren circle, the next task is to perform the on-lay of the earth-signs or geoglyphs. These sigillic forms are marked out in or-der co create the visible matrix of the rite which is to be worked. The powders used for this task \"'ill vary in constitution according to the nature of the rite. Customary ingredients are flour, coloured chalk-dust, grave-earth, bone-dust and grain. Ash from the hearth of previous rites or from other ritual sites may also be used, thus ensuring a lineage of manifest continuity from rice unto rite, circle unto circle. The basic procedure for tracing the earth-signs is as follows:-Firstly the chosen powders are emptied into a bowl. They are then dedicated through insuf-flation - an offering of seven breaths -and are blessed through orientation to the four cardinal directions. A pinch of powder is offered to the North to hallow the Gate of Power and then to the central hearth to mark the heart of the world. The border of the circle is then marked out"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl!nomosia Draco'Taus in a deosil direction, beginning and ending at the North-east. The interior sigildry of the circle will then depend upon the ritual to be worked; a basic form is that of the eight-armed wheel of the compass. Candles, to be lit at the inception of the rite, may also be laid out during this process. These should be placed in the stations of the compass and may be coloured according to the elements or the rites of the year. When the sigillic tracery has been completed, offerings of sacred boughs are placed around the circle's edge. These are placed in the eight directions:-Blackthorn in the North, Whitetho-rn in the North-east, Rowan in the East, Willow in the South-east, Yew in the South, Hazel in the South-west, Apple in the West and Ivy in the North-west. The On-lay of the Boughs is used in the nine major rites throughout the Draconian ritual year, but not so for the lesser rites and adjunctive praxes. Usually the eight offerings take the form of small boughs, each about a forearm in length. These are initially planted into the earth-en border of the Blood-acre and are later placed within the fire during the course of the Oracle Rite. It may also be deemed useful, in order to strengthen the circle's empowerment, for the small bough-offerings to be hung around the circle upon longer staves of the same wood types. These greater staves remain at the circle's edge throughout the duration of any working procedure and form a magically protective hedge or fence, known as the 'selion'. A thread, being of a colour appropriate to the season, may be used to connect the staves and to contain the powers raised within. If such a method is used the gateway between the North and the East should initially be left open. For the North-east is the customary point of entry to and from the circle. Its point, being attributed to the hour between Midnight and Dawn, signifies the place for the coming forth oflight. When the selion-fence of bough and thread is used, additional staves may also be required to maintain the circularity of the ritual area's perimeter. When circle, hearth, earth-sign and bough-offerings have been laid in place, the initiates of the companie should robe themselves and lay out the various requisites in their allotted stations of the compass,-ever according to the Way of the Four Watchers. In this task, each initiate should invoke the Spirit-guardian of their appointed airt and, by its guidance, should establish their position in the circle as the Shrine of their Patron Watcher. When all such preliminary tasks have been fulfilled, the ritual participants should vacate the circle and sit aside from it for a period of meditative preparation. When all are ready, and at the summons of the Master or Mistress, let all approach the North-eastern gate of the circle. The Guardian of the North should enter first, followed by the Western, Southern and Eastern Guardians in order. The manner of entry is thus:-Standing at the edge of the circle one should silently petition the spirits of the land and in-wardly ask the Hidden Intercessor to open the way. A single coin, bent and crooked, is then cast inward to the unlit hearth. This offering is made as the token of entry to the lair of the Serpent and as the surrender of the first and last worldly coin to the Keeper of the Ways. As the coin of worldly wealth is offered in outward gesture, so let the inner offering of the Sabbatick Token be made in secrecy, according to the heart's direction. When an initiate has so entered the Field of Qayin, he or she should begin to silently process around the circumference of the ritual domain, following the path of the Presiding Master in one complete circuit of the enhallowed domain. Thereafter each should walk forth to their ap-pointed station in readiness for the rite to begin. Before proceeding with the ritual, the Master should close the gate of the circle by gesture or by tying the last knot in the thread - sealing the garth ofbirthcord and noose. Each word and deed within the circle betokens the motion of power and serves to augur one's self-wrought fate; no act or sound needless to a rite's intent should be made. It is said that one 66"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl?nomoeia Draco'Taus may laugh or weep in freedom, but ne'er speak nor step beyond the seen and unseen way of the compass. Such is the method and manner drawn from the birth-place of this grimoire for establishing and hallowing the Plot of the Devil's Acre. Each practitioner or covine should adapt its example according to their own persuasion and situation. For instance, the eight types of wood should be replaced with those indigenous to the locality of the chosen site. Charm and method should be likewise adapted to need and intent. Each pace about the circle's horizon, each deed that turns the wheel of the year, reveals a let-ter of the magical alphabet. For each step taken through the Working of the Royal Arte trans-lates an arcanum from the Serpent's scales to the Seeker's heart. An unnumbered pace, the fractional or zeroth step, is the leap over the fire. As a spinning jump over the hearth, the transversion of the unended bridge of flame is undertaken at the end of all rites to signify and re-affirm the offering of one's entirety to the initiatory source. Upon the first occasion of this deed, and best it be at Midwinter, a new name may be chosen and shouted out as one jumps over the flames. This is the Oath upon the Pageless Book that lies hidden within the Master's Forge; by one word all else is forsworn. Within this grammar the full ritual form of the single circle is used in isolation solely upon the principal occasion of the Midwinter Rite, elsewise the Blood-acre is used as the first circle of the Double-ouroboros. Aside from its use at Midwinter the basic compass is used in isolation for the adjunctive, solitary and lesser workings of the Crooked Path. THE DOUBLE-OUROBOROS IN THIS MOST especial recension of the Arte Magical the main form of the ritual domain is the Double-ouroboros or twofold circle. Its sigil impresses the glyph of eternity and infinity upon the matrix of time and space, and casts forth the sign of the twice-turning serpent to bind all to the sorcerous way. The single circle, as detailed above, is known as 'The First Circle' or 'Circle of Presence'. The Second Circle is similarly known as 'The Circle of Absence'. In conjunction they form the espe-cial realm of the Double-ouroboros. The size and the method of construction is basically the same for both circles. The preparato-ry tasks are identical, except that the second circle is unbordered by staves and, depending upon the rite, is generally without a central hearth. Its field-the Plot of the Never-setting Stars -is to be swept clean in the same manner as the first circle and with equal reverence; its specific earth-signs should be laid down in their ordained manner and with the appropriate powders. The gate of entry to the Circle of Absence is solely through the Place of Power: the septen-trional portal of the Blood-acre. The place of crossing betwixt the twain is the Midnight Gate and is justly marked by the skull-crowned stave of the Northern Watcher. The stang shall be borne forth or turned by the Magister to bridge the way at the times of transition between the two circles. If made possible by the orientation of the land the threshold of the two circles may be marked by a tree. The entry to and from the second circle is then made to the left or the right of the tree according to the nature of the ritual being worked. The left side is known as 'The Shrine of the Womb' and the right side as 'The Shrine of the Tomb'. If one enters by the way oflife, one must return by death; such is the rule. 68"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Th?ordia By vertu of its significance, the preparation of the second circle should be perceived as the entreaty to the Dreaming-body: the adjuration to the Body of Night -the Other of the Sorcer-ers' Flesh. Within the cycle of the major rites throughout the year, the single form of the circle is used for working the Rite of the Draconian Oracle, the principal Mystery-rite of the Dragon-road. At Midwinter this working is known as 'The Mystery of the Black Sun', signifying the apo-theosis of the Crooked Path in the point of infernal descent. The dark tide of the longest night is thus the primary occasion when the single circle is used. At this time the second circle is left fallow and untouched - even as the shadow beyond the Northern Doorway: the dark shade of futurity cast backward by the year to come. On the occasion of the seven other tides of the year the Rite of the Draconian Oracle is known and used as 'The Rite of the First Circle'. It serves as the means to open the way - to lay down the foundation of gnosis within the double-circle rituals of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua. The text of the Oracle Rite is also used for solitary practice at each Dark Moon and therein is known as 'The Vessel Rite' (See commentary: The Three Ways and the Three Times). The seven numbered rites of the year form the Sevenfold Double House of Azhdeha; their completion establishes the fourteenfold Body of the Dragon within the earthen domain. Upon each of these occasions the Oracle Rite is worked within the compass of the first circle to estab-lish the eightfold basis of the Pathway's knowledge and to affirm the state of magical existence to which the Seeker has attained. Upon the completion of the Oracle Rite, and after due peti-tion to the threshold, the seven rites proceed through the crossing-over from the first circle to the second. This transition marks the going-forth of the aspirant through the 'hot-point', or central arcanum of the ritual, into the field of inner realisation which is unique to each of the double-circle workings. ' In passing over the threshold the Seeker trespasses against the edge of the World-field. His step is the gesture of misrule which seals the deed of the all-offering: the giving-over of the \\Vorld's heart to the fire of initiation. The single step marks the passage of the initiate through the primordial interstice of transgressive empowerment; for in crossing over the divide of all-inbetweenness, he re-enters the dark tide of the Black Sun and passes beyond the Midnight of Time, breaching the gulf of the World-field's death. The measure of his step is the unended bridgeway which transects the horizon of the aeons and leaps the moment wherein the cosmos is perpetually destroyed and created anew. Thus, whilst living, the sorcerer walks forth from the realm of causality, across the border of his own death and into the life beyond life. Passing through the fractional crack between all aeons the Seeker enters the domain beyond the eschaton; the Crooked Path creates the Open Way into the Realm of All-Possible Becoming. \\Vithin the second circle each word and deed of sorcerous intent facilitates the impress of the Elder Gods within the Place of Emptiness. The ingression of gnosis is perceived as theophanic \\ision and is called forth to flesh as the Eden of Primal Exstasis. Every gesture inscribes the cipher of enchantment upon the flayed skin of the sacrificed world and prophesies the nature of its rebirth. For in crossing into the second circle the Seeker takes and turns the pelt of the all-offering; he dons the royal robe of the World-field's death and assumes the nature of the Turnskin: the Hidden Intercessor of Change. By all that occurs within the second circle the dreaming-body is empowered with the poten-tial of self-revelation; the seed of all that would be enfleshed in the world-to-be is strewn far and '1iide within the boundless compass of immanence. Within the Circle of Absence the oneiro-physical vehicle of the practitioner is opened to the Body of all Other by ordeals of magical sacrifice, thereby to transcarnate the insurgent power of the void within the matrix of primordial carnality. This is to attain the marriage of Man with"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"qrimorium G~nomot1ia Draco'Taus the very spirit of the Elder Gods - to realise the Arcanum of the Dracosarkia: the unification of ever-changing flesh and the sentience of the Apophasian Gnosis. In going forth into the realm of negation the sorcerer assumes the ordained form of magical transmission: the Dragon-body. For such is the adamantine vessel of perfect mutability, the athanor of immortality, that has passed beyond the abyss of the world-destroying pyre to serve the Body of Initiates as the sublime vehicle of convocation. When the labyrinth of the second circle has been traversed according to the unique manner of its Mystery the threshold is crossed once more. As the step re-enters the first circle the subtle tide of magical force engendered in the second circle is reified, emptied into the Blood-acre and made flesh in the existant presence of the Seeker. In treading the path of the Double-ouroboros the initiate turns and re-turns, marking the double-way to-and-from the potentiated void, back and forth betwixt the interstice of death, to establish his own unique being as the point of transmission between the Elder Gods and the manifest realm of Qayin Azhaka. In affirmation of this wisdom each rite of the twin circles is begun and concluded with a silent pacing of the twofold compass. Each wordless step is a re-membrance of the past and a pre-cognition of the future: the cross-roads for every parallel way of the dual existent. The Shrine, Blood-acre and Double-ouroboros are the three principal domainst of our secret worship. Let these places be hidden to all, save to those of the Dragon's brood. At such times when moving amidst the world of men, when the Serpent's hiss sounds the call to prayer, then let the Seeker's foot trespass the threshold of mortal warship's realm. Go forth freely, in all honour and purity of intent, straying with great purpose into the temples of the world's belief. By the Sovereign Alchymy of Mind let every sign, symbol and scripture of earthen faith be transformed in the Black Light of Our Wisdom. For the heart is the true domain of our secret worship, wherein Shrine, Circle and Double-horizon are one. The heart of Qayin is hidden to all, save to those of the Dragon's blood. In the Mystery of the Heresiarch, so shall it be. tThere is a fourth ritual domain, known as 'The Field of Sorcerous Ferocity', sometimes used in solitary and votive praxes; for which see -The Teaching and Practice called 'The Wreath of Seven Laughing Skulls'. 70"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"l(A THE HIEROS GAMOS"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo6ia Draco'Taus 7~ Come forth, all ye who would pass within, who would cross o'er the threshold and enter in at the Twofold Gate.

By the Rite of Ka the aspirant binds himself to the sorcerer's way; his every word and deed are as a covenant: a sworn oath to attain liberation upon the Dragon-road. Exacted within the Sacred Vessel of the \\lysteries, the Oath of Ka reveals and opens the Way oflnitiation. THE TIME OF WORKING THE RITE OF the Hieros Gamos is the annual praxis of dedication. It is worked daily during the last full lunar month of the solar year, that is, from the Dark Moon to the Dark Moon for the last complete lunar month prior to the Winter Solstice. The practice should be worked at least once each day during the twenty-eight/twenty-nine day cycle of the Moon. It is best if the practice is undertaken at the same time each day and preferably at one of the four quarter times of Dawn, Noon, Dusk and Midnight. If so desired the practice may be undertaken at each or any of these four stations of the day. Due to the variations of the lunar calendar there may be a number of days between the end of the \\farriage Rite and the Midwinter Rite of Consummation. Upon such interstitial days the aspirant should utilise the diverse adjunctive praxes of Arte, binding together every strand of his web, every facet of his design, into the single-pointed focus of the vessel. In such an instance where the lunar month of the Marriage Rite would begin prior to All-Hallow's Eve, then let the Rite commence upon the day after All-Hallow's and proceed for the ro.stomary period of twenty-eight days. Thereafter let the vessel be sealed until its appointed mne of sacrifice. THE FIRST WORKING OF THE HIEROS GAMOS IT IS MOST important to note that during the first working of the Hieros Gamos the Vessel is ~-ially chosen and consecrated for the sole purpose of the Marriage Rite and that its life -as the primal manifestation of the Sacred Urn of Azhdeha - endures solely for the period of time mcompassed by the praxis of Ka. The so-called 'Marriage-vessel' lives solely for the duration of ame between the inception of the Hieros Gamos and the hour of its Midwinter consummation, Wt is. from the beginning of the last lunar month to the hour of midnight upon the Winter Solstice. As has been disclosed within the pages of the Exordia, the Vessel of Marriage is cremated mpon the dark noontide of the longest night. The first offering of the Sacred Vessel to the fire .:oosritutes the sacrificial basis of the path; it signifies the resorption of the Seeker's individual ronsciousness within the primordial source of all magical empowerment. The initial working oi ~ Hieros Gamos facilitates the means of autonomous initiation into the path; its exaction 1:s therefore of paramount importance and forms the foundation of the Hidden Temple. 75"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gxnomosia Oraco'Taus As aforementioned in the Exordia, the ashes of the Marriage-vessel are taken from the Mid-winter pyre and are then placed within a new body: the Dragon-vessel.

For the Vessel of the Dragon shall reign in the Circle of Arte for but a single year at a time: from the Dark of the Sun to the Dark of the Sun it shall mirror each step 'pon the World-field's round. Each Midwinter-tide it is returned to the forge and there, from its own ashes, is born anew. Thus year by year, through rise and fall of incarnate form, the Vessel of the Dragon shall be cast down into the fire of the longest night and therefrom it shall be raised up, year by year, - each time to transmute and purify the Very Being of its Maker and its Murderer. HIEROS DI-GAMOS: The Second and Successive Workings of the Marriage Rite WHEN THE TIME of the Marriage Rite returns each year, it is to be worked using the Vessel of the Dragon. Aside from the twelve or thirteen Dark Moons throughout the year, the annual obsenrance of the Hieros Gamos is generally the only time when the Dragon-vessel is opened. The Marriage Rite is worked in the same manner each year, although with greater awareness and comprehension with each successive year. Thus it is only at the beginning of the aspirant's work upon the Crooked Path, during the very first working of the Marriage Rite, that the Ves-sel lives for the single moon-month before Midwinter. Thereafter, upon all subsequent yearly workings of the Marriage Rite, the manifest Vessel of the Dragon is used. For He that lives for but a year and day is the Monarch of the Circle. The True Idol of the Draconian Mysteries is the Mirror of Time; it reflects the Compass of the Sacred Year and the many tasks of the initi-ate undertaken in its turning. The making and the breaking of the Idol conceals the mystery of Self-overcoming; for to serve with both hands alike -as both Idolator and Iconoclast-is the nature of this path. Know that it is a custom of the Cunning Arte within the Isle of Albion for the chosen appren-tice to serve for a year and a day by the Count of the Moon - being mystically equal to three-hundred and sixty-five days by the Count of the Sun - before being accepted as a candidate for the full initiation and empowerment. The life of the Dragon-vessel, in being manifest for one year at a time, reflects this path through the seasons of attainment and facilitates the process whereby the Seeker may enter the Way alone and with sole dependence upon the Hidden In-tercessor. By the pilgrimage of the Seeker and the Vessel through the fourteen ordeals, by each step taken in the turning of the Sacred Year, the customary method of teaching is transposed from the hands of Master and Pupil to the hands of the Seeker and the Will of the Path:-this is the Lineage of the Unique Way. Each successive year of treading the Dragon-road reflects the customary period of teaching; each year begins the path anew, perpetually placing the aspirant at the Alpha and Omega of the Way. CONCERNING THE BLOOD-OFFERINGS THE SACRIFICIAL OFFERING of blood within the practices of the path are exacted using the ritual knife or Arthana. During the working of the first Marriage Rite only one's own blood should be used; thereafter the blood of all sacrifice may be used. Women should use both the blood of the Moon and the blood begotten of the knife. 76"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Ka: 'Ihe HieroStGamoe CONCERNING THE SEXUAL OFFERINGS DURING THE FIRST working of the Hieros Gamos it is the customary rule of Our Arte that the practitioner remains magically chaste, engaging in no other sexual activity than that of the auto-sexual congress demanded within the praxis of Ka. With none but the Serpent shall the Seeker lay in carnal pleasure during the month of the first marriage; for the Serpent is the Sole Embodiment of Desire -the Flesh of all Adoration. During the second and successive annual workings of the Hieros Gamos the practitioner may engage in any form and manner of sexual congress they so desire. All embodiments of desire with whom you conjoin, whether in mind or in matter, must be wholly identified with the Ser-pent. All bodies oflust, whether in flesh or in phantasie, should be perceived as an emanation of the Dragon and every emission of carnality be deemed as a sacrifice unto the visible and subtil body of the vessel. For all practitioners, whether man or woman, it is essential to dedicate every sexual act to the path; this is considered needful at all times throughout the year. This is most apparent during the time of Ka, when all sexual effluvia are offered - via the ritual cup - directly to the vessel itself. At other times throughout the year sexual fluids and menses should be placed within servitor vessels and offered to the Dragon-vessel during the Oracle Rite at each Dark Moon. In consideration of the sexual sacrifices rendered to the vessel during the praxis of Ka, it is apparent - from discourse with divers practitioners -that certain practical distinctions must be made for men and women. For both, the basic means of the offering is attained through auto-sexual stimulation. For men, the offering of semen produced by masturbation provides an ample emission of lluidic elixir. It is customary for men to offer their sexual emissions in accord with an observance of the solar tides. The four stations of the day are considered to provide the basic cycle for regu-lating the auto-sexual aspects of praxis during the Ka Rite. For women, the amount of fluidic emission derived from self-stimulation may not always be of a substantial quantity. It is advised that the ritual cup be filled with water and that the hand or other means of self-stimulation should be bathed therein, after orgasm has been attained, to co-mingle the water with the fluids of the vagina. Women should also offer the menses of their womb, both during the Marriage Rite and at Dark Moons; this may be as fluid or as dried powder. It is also customary for women to offer the subtle and invisible currents, the secret utter-ances of the Moon, which issue forth from the vaginal mouth throughout the entire lunar cycle. Awareness should be centred in the womb and the light of the Moon visualised to flow outward from the vagina into the ritual cup or directly into the heart of the vessel. The currents of the ~loon vary in nature and manifest form with each individual day or fraction of the lunation; the diwrs arcana of the lunar digits are cast throughout the many praxes of the path. It is necessary to state that an observance of the visible and subtil tides of Star, Sun and :\\loon should be made by all participants during the Arcana of Ka and throughout the entirety of the Path's fourteen ordeals. The customary ascription of solar and lunar arcana to men and women respectively provides a basis for the first working of the Marriage Rite and for certain other modes of practice. Beyond this it should be remembered that it is an essential aspect of these mysteries for all practitioners to align their work to the many diverse patterns of earth .md heaven - to transcend the ways of mortal flesh and make manifest the Sidereal Body of Azhdeha. 77"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Grimorium Ginomosia Draco'Taus THE PLACE OF WORKING THE MARRIAGE RITE is a solitary praxis of Arte and by its very nature is best suited to the an-choritic enclave of the domiciliary shrine. Such is the counsel of customary observance for the working of the Ka Rite in the flesh. It has been stated that during the ordained period of time the Ka praxis should be worked at least once each day; this formal observance must be performed in the physical medium. As a means of further empowerment the rite may also be observed through the sole exercise of imagination. By this means the vessel may be placed wheresoever the mind may conceive - in any place or time. For the Dragon-vessel, the Idol of the Imageless One, is perceived as the true centre of all possible belief. It may be placed by the gestures of the mind at the midpoint of every mortal shrine -as the subtil body of the Unknown Magical Power -as the Spirit that moves unseen midst the congregation of every graven image. Thus in any temple of the earth, in any heaven or hell of imaginal conception, the vessel may be opened to receive the all-offering: the blood and seed of all that is. For further commentary concerning the working procedures and the nature of the Sacred Ves-sel, the reader is referred to the relevant parts of the Exordia, to the section defining the use and succession of the vessel and also to the pages delineating the cycle of the ritual year. 78"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"I THE RITE OF THE DRACONIAN ORACLE Preliminary Comment The Ritual Text Proper The Three Ways and the Three Times: the Commentary concerning the threefold application of the Oracle Rite:-i) The Midwinter working of the Oracle Rite: The Mystery of the Black Sun ii) The Dark Moon working of the Oracle Rite: the Mystery of the Black Moon w · The Solar and Seasonal working of the Oracle Rite: the Mystery of the Black Earth, being the Foundation Ceremony of the First Circle, as used during the Double-circle Rites of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ia, Ku, La, Tan and Hua."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Grimol'ium G2nomo6ia Dl'aco'Taus Preliminary Comment THE RITE OF the Draconian Oracle is the central mysterium of the Crooked Path. It is the ar-cane focus for the theophanic revelation of the Dragon to the lnitiatic Body of Man. Its intent is the manifestation of the black-golden point of primal initiation, to reveal the Unnumbered or Zeroth Gate of the Void and to open the well-spring of all Wise-blood: the epiphanic source for the Quintessential Power of the Arte Magical. Set at the Alpha and Omega of the Path and upon the nodes of dark alignment, the Oracle Rite reveals the empowering source for the transmission of gnosis from the Elder Gods to the Seeker of the Way. Within its circle the foun-dation-offering of all sacrifice is re-membered in the moment of ritual exaction and the Agap~, the consummation of the Hieros Gamos, is realised as the perpetuity of congress between the Serpent -as the mediatory embodiment of all magical force, and the Sorcerer -as the matrix of all magical reification. The basis of the rite, in form and function, is the Dream of the Hidden Sabbath: the Ouro-boric Feast of all Sorcery. Within this hallowed domain of beauty and abomination the sacrifi-cial banquet of perfect transgression is celebrated by all gods, men, beasts and spirits who are sworn in unity unto the Wyched Path. For in our present observance of the Cunning Arte the wisdom revealed in the oneiric vision and ancestral mythos of the Sabbat is utilised as a vehicle for the expression and encryption of sacred lore, ceremonial procedure and mystical doctrine. The many-natured vision of magick is beheld within by the eye of the self-awakened dreamer and is projected outward through the waking eye of the realised self. The arcana of liberation are attained through the Ordalium and Revel within the illumined Body of Night. That these visions of the spirit may be spoken through flesh, in such forms befitting their essential nature, the secret laws of the Arte Magical are uttered within the backwards cipher of misrule. The day-born wisdom is begotten in the tongue of nocturnal paradise. Within this single web of the Draconine Mystery the countless threads of the World's en-chantment are interwoven according to their own secret design. The year and the day in the Kingdom of Elphame, the twilit whisperings of forgotten gods at the borderlands of every be-lief, the visions of the night-flying horde of spirits and of the earth-wandering procession of the beast-masked dead,-such dreams are here enfleshed and here are dreamed anew. The initiatory force of the Dragon is translated through the form of the Oracle Rite as magi-cal knowledge, as both wisdom and method. With each and every working of its mystery the World, even as the very Body of Man, is devoured and is born anew; an old skin falls away from the surface of perception and a new nature is revealed. The words and deeds of the rite's exac-tion combine within an incarnate realisation of the Dreaming Sabbat to facilitate the reification of the Magical Quintessence. Through the practice of this primal mysterium - by the turn and re-turn of the step upon the point of aureate darkness - the knowledge of the Crooked Path coheres meaning through telary revelation and manifests as the Dragon-body,-the transcarnate flesh through which the energetic insurgence of the Elder Gods becomes the Living Word of Gnosis.

Here endeth the Text of the Rite Proper"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle The Three Ways and the Three Times BEING THE COMMENTARY UPON THE RITE OF THE DRACONIAN ORACLE The Rite of the Draconian Oracle may be accomplished by divers means and in an untold number of ways; whether alone or in companionship, whether by contemplation or by deed, whether by wrath or by peace,-all shall reside in perfect equipoise -as facets of the single adamantine gem -irradiant upon all points of the Holy Trident. THERE ARE THREE principal applications of the Rite of the Draconian Oracle, each specific to rime and purpose:-l The Mystery of the Black Sun, the Feast of the Zeroth Head of Azhdeha, held each year at .\\iidwinter for the death and birth of the Sacred Vessel. II) The Mystery of the Black Moon, the Feast of the Oracle, held upon each night of the full waned moon for the revealing, feeding and re-sealing of the Sacred Vessel. lll) The Mystery of the Black Earth, the Feast of the Blood-acre, held upon the ordained tides of the year as the ceremony of foundation within the Double-ouroboric Rites of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La. Tan and Hua. Upon these occasions the Oracle Rite is named and used as The Rite of the First Circle, therein serving as the basis and root for the heptarchic mysteria of the Dragon's 5e\\·en heads. The basic form of the ritual text is maintained throughout each of the three ways, varying only in the mode of its practical application and in its method of conclusion. The following com-mentaries endeavour to elucidate the knowledge, wisdom and method of the three ways and to gh·e counsel regarding the procedure and conduct of the rite in keeping with the work of both solitary and covine observance. I: The Mystery of the Black Sun THE ~YSTERY OF the Black Sun is the name given to the Rite of the Draconian Oracle when it is worked upon the day of the Winter Solstice. This is the primary application of the rite and it is used as the means to consummate the Arcanum of Ka: the ritual task of the Hieros Gamos. Each year upon the night oflongest darkness, when the enchantment of Ka has been fulfilled, the old vessel -whether it be that of the first marriage or the year-born successor - shall be cast 99"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"(lrimorium G)?nomoeia Draco'Taus down into the pyre of sacrifice, even as the sun into the abyss of deepest night. From the ashes of the old the new shall arise. The untold essence of the mystery, the innermost arcanum of the Black Sun, is communi-cated in the interregnum of the twain, in the time betwixt the fiery death of the old vessel and the transmigration of its spirit into the new and empty urn,-the vessel-yet -to-be. The arcanum is signified by the seed-phoneme of I and is revealed uniquely unto each initiate within the in-terstice, the threshold of transcension, that lies between the fiery immolation of the old vessel and the placing of its ashes within the newly consecrated urn. For in that time of in betweenness there is no vessel of the Dragon other than the flesh itself, no vehicle beyond the voidful self-realisation of I. This secret, also known as the Arcanum ofla-Dr'ka, lies within the fractional divide of all aeons: the eternal ecstasis of All-Creation and All-Destruction, coetaneous within the perpetuity of the single moment. The realisation of this arcanum sustains the continua of gnosis transmitted through the sacrificial mysteries of the entire ritual cycle of the year and therein is centralised within the actuating moment of transition at Midwinter. Upon the axis of this divide the Wheel of the Year revolves, the old year is ended and the new year begun ... PROCEDURE AND CUSTOMS OF WORKING AT MIDWINTER THE MIDWINTER RITE is worked using the single circle: the first circle of the double-ourobo-ros. It may be celebrated alone or in the companie of fellow travellers upon the Dragon-road. The ritual site should be prepared according to the method and manner of the Blood-acre, as previously stated. As a visible banner of the mysterium to the retinue of the stars, as a sign to the invisible companie of all spirits and gods, the earth-sigil should be laid upon the ground in the form of the royal seal of Azhdeha. As it is written, so let it be done. The basic ritual procedure for the use of the fourfold covine is given below. The portrayal of the ritual is drawn from traditional observance in order to establish a truthful exemplar of practice and to provide a basis for adaptation by both covine and solitary practitioners. The stages of the procedure have been gradated and enumerated so as to communicate the custom-ary method of working according to the Lore of the Hendecarch: the Numerick Cypher of Arte. The Teachings of the Hendecarch are used to count the ways of sorcery, to enumerate the arcana of action, form and force. The eleven keys of the cypher serve to demarcate the hidden matrix of magical energy and to geometrically cohere the principles of empowerment which underlie the manifold words and deeds of ritual practise. The first eight keys of the complete cypher combine to empower the basic eight-rayed compass of the circle. This foundation is known as 'The Mystery of the Eightfold Rite'. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle is esteemed as the highest recension of this wisdom. o) The Creation of the Point: Preliminary Gestures. When all have entered the circle and are stationed in their ordained quarters, a single bow shall be made by each initiate unto the central hearth. This gesture signifies the unified honour of the Quadriga to the spirit of the Hidden Initiator and is also a sign of respect by each initiate unto all brethren of the circle, both visible and invisible. A second bow shall then be made by all unto the North; for there the skull resides upon the stang as the Image of Qayin, even as the form of the Fifth and Immutable Body of the Sacred Vessel. All shall then resume their positions and await the sign for the rite to continue. 100"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Rite of the Dl'aconian Orade At the sign and word of the Northern Guardian all shall pace in a deed of silent preparation, bearing forth their sacred vessels - each vessel with a candle lighted upon its top - withershins around the circumference of the Blood-acre. This is the zeroth or unnumbered hallowing of the circle. On returning to their stations and placing the vessels to mark the cornerstones of the circle, the Northern Guardian shall sound a single note upon the ritual bell. This is the magical gesture signifying the thirteenth knell of midnight: the voice of the Intercessor heralding the open way beyond the black noontide - signalling the liberation of the spirit into the Dreaming-flesh of Endless Night. 1) The Encharming of the Point: The Oracle When the sole voice of the bell has unified with silence, the Northern Guardian shall com-mence the rite with the utterance of The Oracle of Elder Worship. This theophanic utterance recapitulates the gnosis underlying the whole grammar of the Draconian Mysteries and creates the point of direct continuation from the oracular source of the Crooked Path. 2) The Revelation and Establishment of the Path The Declaration:-Remaining in their appointed stations of the compass, the companie will then unite in the utterance of The Declaration. This statement opens the way and reveals the bifurcate nature of the path. The Dragon is imaged in the sinistral and dextral signacula of the twin circles and in the dual hypostates of the ophidian power, the Serpent of the Flaming Torch and the Serpent of the Lightning-bolt, depicts the Double-way of Aeon and Instant as co-emergent emanations from the oracular hot-point of the rite's inception. The Declaration delineates the path as the sword-edged route between possibilities: the uniquely revealed way of aleatory unity, perpetually deviating betwixt the twain extremities of the world-field's horizon. 'Bilo Bilo Hu!', known as The Sorcerer's Cry, is used to salute the Dragon, to focus the in-tent. and to rally the manifold forces and legions of spirits to the circle's heart. It is intoned in se'\\·en manners:-as a secret oath - taken and broken in a single breath, as a solemnly whispered summoning of the dead, as a jubilant welcome to the newborn, as a sentence of execution, as a promise of redemption, as a blessing of perfect compassion and as a curse of endless damna-tion. Its utterance is like the recoil and strike of the serpent: 'Bilo Bilo .. .' is the reticulation and resorption of force; 'Hu!' is the striking of the serpent, the envenoming of the moment. The Chant of the Tree:-Moving thrice widdershins around the circle, once for each verse, all ..-ill then conjoin in The Chant of the Tree. This charm reveals the twofold nature of the path in the ~mbol of the upright column: the axis of the world. The way of unity is here shown forth as the tree of numberless boughs that grows between the zenith and the nadir. The tree is imaged forth as the burning pillar of illumination, forming the ladder of souls that stretches between the height of heaven and the depth of hell. The Chant is directed toward the columnic stave of wood appointed in the midst of the unlit hearth and intends the imaginal transformation thereof into an axial pillar of many-coloured flame, connecting the heights and depths of the i:osmos within the central point of the compass. 101"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomo6ia Draco'TaWJ By vertu of these two opening addresses the Crooked Path is revealed as the Double-way of the Non-dual and is delineated as both the crossroads between the horizontal and vertical axes of the cosmos and as the ever-deviating course of the initiate between all extremities. The Sacrifice of the Sacred Vessel-(Observed solely at Midwinter) When the divagant course of the path has been established, and at the behest of the Circle's Master or Mistress, the sacrificial bodies of the old Sacred Vessels shall be placed within the midst of the unlit pyre-mound. Surrounding the hearth the empty bodies of the new and await-ing vessels may be similarly positioned, even as guardians about the unlit bier of their own be-getters. Prior to and during this most sacrosanct deed there may be auspicious signs and gestures of Arte to show the passing-away of the old vessels and the preparation of the new. 3) The First Casting of the Circle: the Triple Exorcisms. The Threefold Exorcism of the Blood-acre is used to purify the sacred domain and to establish the first on-lay or initial empowerment of the circle. By its perfected exaction the ritual com-pass, the infinitor unifying circle, vessel and sorcerer, is aligned unto the primordial domain of magical sacrality. The mundane ring of earth, fetish and flesh is transformed -translated by word, deed and outward projection of imagination -to the very eidolon of magistry: the unbounded kingdom ofWitchblood's first-born child. The triune consecration conceals an enneadic corpus of the most subtle arcana, partaking of both complexity and simplicity. Such matters are disclosed, as much as mere word may avail, within the following commentaries and within the appropriate sections of the grammary. In the basic terms of ritual deed the three exorcisms serve to hallow the circle and all that lies within it by means of consecration according to the three essences of Fire, Salt and Water. This is accomplished by the respective methods of fumigation with incense, the strewing of the circle with consecrated powders, and a libation of the circle's perimeter with water. Procedurally, the ritual texts are incanted over the appropriate substances to dedicate them and then, at the conclusion of each charm, the acts of consecration are performed. The tasks may be divided betwixt the members of the covine or allotted to a single congregant, as it so pleases and suits their predilection. After the first exorcism, the central fire should be lit as the visible beacon to welcome the invisible procession of the spirits. When the three exorcisms are completed, all initiates should participate in the recitation of the Binding Charm. The working of the Triple Exorcisms may be accomplished in many different ways by both covine and solitary practitioner. In lore, it is taught that they are best performed by a Sworn Priestess of the Arte - a true journey-woman of the Crooked Path -and from the example of such the following description of their exaction is given. The manner of working is as follows:-During the preparatory phase of the rite the priestess prepares the requisites of her task:-an offering bowl, often in the form of a large open shell; a long feather, such as that of a swan; and 10~"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle the substances of the three consecrations. For the Exorcism of Fire, the dried leaves of sage are generally used, sometimes co-mingled with various other worts according to the nature and depth of the en-trancement required during the rite. For the Exorcism of Salt, powders formed of dried menses and sexual fluids are the basis, sometimes mixed with ashes, grave-dust and many other salts of the Arte. For the Exorcism of Water, the liquid menstruum from the priest-ess' own kteis is used. The crimson waters drawn from the well of the moon in her most recent season of flower are esteemed as the best medium. Such elixirs are often combined with sexual fluids, blood and the many tinctures of flesh and land. At the ordained juncture of the rite, at the sign and summons of the Circle's Master, (or at her own behest if such Office is held by herself), the priestess shall firstly take up her bowl filled with the divers substances for the transmission of the essence of Fire. Stepping before the ~orthern Guardian, the priestess places the bowl before the feet of the Magister and before the face of the skull. She then offers a full prostration as a honorific and adorative sign of humility. This gesture signifies the beseeching of the Initiator for permission to proceed. The Northern Guardian signals her to continue by beginning the recitation of the ritual consecration. All other initiates shall follow his example. The priestess conducting the deeds of exorcism remains in silent absorption or else echoes the recitation in the manner of a susurrus. \\\\ nen so ordained by the beginning of the consecrating charm, the priestess will light the con-tents of the shell with a candle from the North and then, using the swan-feather, nurtures the glo\\\\ing embers of the herbs, stirring the air to arouse and disperse the clouds of perfumed smoke. The feather is thereafter used as the means to fan the smouldering incense, to feed its 5111oke to the spirits and to waft its scented mist through and throughout the body of the circle. Carrying the shell and feather around the circle, the priestess proceeds deosil from the North. At each quarter, she bows in honour to the Guardian of the Airt. When the bow is returned she proceeds with the purification of the initiate's body, bathing their entirety within the envelop-mg halo of smoke. Between each quarter-station, she bends low and uses the feather to cleanse the peripheral aire of the compass. On completing the fumigation of the circle and its brethren, the priestess returns to the ~orth and offers a bow of consummation. She then turns and offers the remainder of the ashes to the central hearth. Using the flame from the North, she then lights the fire at the circle's Dean; offering thereto the sevenfold breath of empowerment. All initiates conjoin in the recita-tion of the final part of the ritual charm. This seals the first deed of exorcism. When the central pyre has begun to burn steadily, the Exorcism of Salt may begin. The priest-tS5 places an offering of powders within the shell and dedicates it before the Northern Guardian w1th a single bow. Once again, the sign to continue is given by the beginning of the consecrat-mg charm. The priestess moves deosil around the circle, beginning and ending at the North. L-pon each Quarter-guardian she performs a blessing and purification. This is accomplished by a cross-signing-® -of the brow and feet with her powder-besmeared hand and may be rein-ion-:ed by subtle passes of the hand over various focal centres of the initiate's body. An exchange oi blessings and honorific gestures begins and ends each individual process of consecration. Between each station of the compass a little of the powder is strewn around the circle's edge. Ar the end of the second exorcism the priestess concludes by offering a bow to the North md by emptying the remaining powders from the shell into the hearth as a gift unto the Spirit. As \"';th the first charm, all initiates conjoin in the final words of the recitation. This seals the second deed of exorcism. The Exorcism of Water is performed using the same series of ritual gestures, beginning with the bow unto the Northern Guardian and proceeding deosil in the same manner as before. The head and heels of each Quarter-guardian are cross-signed with the elixirs poured forth from the 103"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Grimorium G2nomoeia Draco'Taus moon-pearled shell of the priestess. Each anointment is administered by the subtle passes and gestures of her hand and may be further empowered by the on-lay of her breath as a means of infusing energy into each initiate's body. Within these latter forms of benediction by hand and breath the priestess will often bestow an empowerment specific to the particular recipient for purposes of healing their physical body and invigorating the dreaming flesh. Between each sta-tion and throughout its extent, the circle is attentively libated. Upon the completion of this, her third circumambulation, the exorcism is completed by the customary bow and through the gift of remaining fluids to the fire. With the final collective utterance the third exorcism is sealed. For each exorcism a single deosil circumambulation is performed by the priestess. When the three ways of word and deed are fulfilled, a fourth and silent circumambulation is made to bind and seal her task and to foreshadow the hidden path which emanates from within the threefold arcana. All initiates should, at this time, offer unto her a single bow in thankfulness for the com-pleted task. Thereafter, the priestess will recite the Binding Charm of the Exorcisms. All other initiates will follow her voice in the manner of an echo, catching and susurrating each word, ever in accord with the subtle aire that has been manifested within the circle. From the above example of ritual practice the covine or solitary practitioner may hopefully gain insight into the manner and method of Arte befitting the accomplishment of the Three Exorcisms. By the ingenium and artistry of the Seeker let the Mystery of the Triune Crossways be perfected through love. Through the medium of the fluidic, solid and etheric substances the triune akhymic essences of mercury, salt and sulphur shall combine to establish the matrix whereupon the magical force, the spirit of the Seeker, may be made manifest in perfect equilib-rium - in Will, Desire and Belief-upon all points of the Holy Trident. At the completion of the third stage of the rite the initiates of the Quadriga should be stand-ing at their appointed stations of the circle and in the midst thereof the central fire should be burning strongly. 4/ 5) The Second Casting of the Circle: the Salutation of the Four Quarters and the Empowerments of the Pentalphic Sign At the sign and word of the Northern Guardian the fourth stage of the rite shall commence. Each initiate in turn, going deosil around the circle, shall salute and summon the powers of their respective airt of the compass. The tutelary power of each airt or quarter of the Blood-acre is revered in the form of a ruling spirit: a Watcher. The Four Watchers are honoured as the divine embodiment of the Quadriga: the perfected form of the manifest covine. Through the words and deeds of salutation the four initiates are transformed into the circle-mandala of the Crooked Path's spiritual progenitors. The honour afforded to each Watcher establishes a point of transcarnation between the initiate and the primal circle of the path's inception; a subtle catena of transmission is opened: a lineal succession of empowerment between the Seeker, the retinue of spirits and powers ruling the appointed airt, the manifest counterparts of the initiate in each and every companie of the fourfold covine, and the divine form of the \\Vatcher itself. The wisdom of the Quadrigan transcarnation is revealed solely through the accomplishment of the deeds of salutation and by the means of preparative visualisation. In each direction of the compass the Watchers are to be visualised and imaged-forth in the form of colossal serpents; like royal cobras rearing upward into the sky, in constant readiness to strike at the circle's heart, filled with the power to bestow both blessing and curse. In the East the body of the Serpent-watcher is born from the light of sunrise and is formed through the agency of the air, from the motion of the first breath to the relentless force of the 104"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Rite of the Dl'aconian Ol'acle whirlwind. Its body is perceived to emerge from the dawn in flesh of clear ruby-red light. In the South the body of the Serpent-watcher is born from the light of the midday and is formed through the agency of fire, from the first spark to the holocaustal incandescence of the inferno. Its body is perceived to emerge from the noon in flesh of brilliant albeate light. In the West the body of the Serpent-watcher is born from the light of sunset and is formed through the agency of water, from the first jewel of the dew to the floodtide of inundation. Its body is perceived to emerge from the dusk in flesh of mist and twilight grey. In the North the body of the Serpent-watcher is born from the black light of the infernal sun and is formed through the agency of earth, from the dust of the grave to the ravine-torn moun-tain. Its body is perceived to emerge from the midpoint of the night in flesh of all-absorbing darkness. Through the perceptual basis of these imaginal formations the way may be opened for the \\Vatchers to reveal their concealed forms and likenesses. The accustomed manner of their salu-tation is as follows:-On receiving the sign from the North, the Eastern Guardian shall turn outward to face be-yond the circle's edge. He shall then offer a full prostration in honour to the Spirit of the East-ern Watcher. Then, raising both arms, he shall outstretch his hands - extending his fingers to make the signs of the fivefold star. Emanating outward, in irradiant light of the appropriate elemental hue, an averse pentalpha is imagined to project from the left hand and, similarly, an upright pentalpha is visualised to project from the right hand. This establishes the Double-sign of the Ascendant and Descendant Star. The two pentalphic stars are cast outward to extend and strengthen the boundaries of the circle. When their form has been projected and stabilised, the initiate shall unify their light in a single point and therefrom call forth the Vision of the \\Vatch er. Attaining the unity of emanation and perception, the Eastern Guardian shall silently call upon the Spiritual Power of his Airt to come forth and be manifest within him. At the moment of his inner recognition of the insurgent current, the initiate shall stand and proceed to recite the Address of Salutation. At the appropriate juncture of his adjuration offerings are consecrat-ed and are placed within the fire. Such offerings are made in token of the Quarter-guardian's crown, thus signifying the patronage of the Watcher's sovereignty. As the final part of the charm is spoken the initiate turns and sends forth the power of the \\Vatcher to hallow the body of the entire circle. Throughout his conjuration the other initiates shall face the direction of his summoning and make their own gestures of honour unto the \\Vatcher and its retinue. When the Eastern Guardian has completed his salutation, he shall turn unto the Guardian of the South and offer a single bow as a sign that they may proceed. The procedure for each salu-tation follows on thuswise, each initiate specializing their adjuration according to the especial alignment and rapport with the Watcher of their appointed quarter. When the Salutations unto the Four Watchers have been fulfilled, all shall bow unto the central hearth in unison to seal the manifestation of the Quadriga. By the ingenium and artistry of the covine let the Mystery of the Quaternion Crossways be perfected through honour. In terms of the procedural structure according to the Numerick Cypher of the Hendecarch the fourth and fifth stages are simultaneous: the fourth stage is established by the Salutation to the Four Ways; the fifth stage is the emanation of the Fivefold Star, symbolizing the alignment of the five senses to the path of intent. Both stages conjoin as one to fulfil the second casting of the circle. 105"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium G2nomo~ia Dt>aco'T~ 6) The Salutation unto the Heights, Centre and Depths: the Binding of the Four Ways and the Summoning of the Fifth Watcher. In unison the Quadriga proceed to salute the heart of the circle, calling forth the Celestial Ser-pent of the Heights and Depths as the body of the Fifth and Hidden Watcher. From each initiate the double-sign of the fivefold star is in-turned and the light thereof is perceived to unite within the inflamed centre of the compass. The rays of the fivefold sign marry the powers of the Four Watchers in a single point and therein open the way for the presence of the Hidden Watcher. The four pathways of elemental substance intersect and return unto their source, revealing the circle's hearth as the indivisible point of spirit. Likewise the lineal pathways of initiatic succes-sion and empowerment converge; the body of all witchblood is called forth to attend, to guard the circle and bear witness to the rite. Rising and writhing outward from the central pyre the body of the Fifth Serpent-watcher is perceived as an immeasurable uraeus, combining and transcending the powers of the four elemental serpent-forms. From the a-temporal point of the Magical Quintessence the body of the Intercessor emerges as the Serpent wrought of space and stellar light, its infinite coils scintil-lating with the radiance of peacock-feathers, binding and ensorcelling all perception within the horizon of its illuminant nature. When the form of the Fifth Watcher has been stabilised in the perception of the covine, its allochrous body should be re-unified with the flames of the central hearth to re-affirm and strengthen the earlier imaginal projection of the burning world-axis. The flesh of the Peacock-serpent is reabsorbed into the column of fire and therein is perceived as the burning road be-tween all adversities and as the tree begetting all spiritual potency. The Offering of the Boughs To augment the veneration of the Triple Axis -the pillar uniting Height, Centre and Depths -the image of the Fifth Watcher is honoured as the upright column of primordial magical power and is revered as the recipient of all sacrificial offerings. This is signified by the offering of eight consecrated boughs to the central hearth. The boughs are to be cut from trees which grow in the area surrounding the ritual domain or elsewise from places revered in the faith of the covine. Once gathered by prayer and arthana, the boughs are placed around the circle's edge prior to the rite's beginning-in the manner previously described (see Temenos ). During the appropriate phase of the ritual procedure, they are fed, one by one, to the fire: the edge of the world-field is symbolically drawn to the circle's centre to beget the burning grove for the convocation of the spirits. As each bough is taken from the perimeter and offered to the flames, its corresponding line from the Chant is to be recited. The task of offering the eight boughs may be divided equally between the members of the covine or allotted to one chosen initiate in the same manner as the traditional form of the Three Exorcisms. The recitation of the Chant and its opening and closing charms should be divided accordingly. The eight small boughs used for this offering may be tied with coloured threads to eight larger staves of the same wood varieties set about the circle's edge. At the appropriate time of offering the smaller boughs may be cut therefrom in similitude to their being cut away from the place of their original growth. The larger staves are used to symbolise the hedge or wall of thorns surrounding the world-field. When connected with thread to form a barrier around the periphery of the Blood-acre they may be perceived as the grove of eternity from whence the offertory tokens of the seasons -the limbs of time - are cut and cast forth to the timeless 106"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle point enshrined within the fire. During certain rites through the year the larger staves may be adorned with coloured flags; this should be accomplished as an outward sign of the knowledge contained in the Teachings of Hallowing the Kingdom. At the summation of the eight offerings a final sacrifice, the Crown of the Greenwood, is given to the Intercessor. The form of the crown varies from rite to rite, season to season. In the seven numbered rites of the year this last sacrifice is a wreath of oaken boughs, intertwined with other worts befitting the season - flowers for spring, corn for summer, berry-bearing boughs for the autumn and thorns for winter. The crown is completed with a sprig of mistletoe; for such is revered as the most sacred herb of the isle and is called 'The Skin of the Snake' amongst the Blessed and the Wise. When the offerings of Crown, bough and leaf have been completed and their substance has been consumed within the envisioned image of the Intercessor as the burning pillar of magical power, all congregants shall make ready to perform the third casting of the circle. 7) The Dragon's Rune: the Third Casting of the Circle. The Chant of the Dragon's Rune serves to perform and perfect the casting of the circle. By its utterance the Spirit of the Fifth Watcher pervades the entire circle and transforms the percep-tion of the Seeker to behold the Vision of the Dragon's Flame: the horizon of the cosmos ringed all about with the peacock-hued fire of the stars. Moving withershins around the periphery of the compass the covine shall recite the Circle-chant of the Dragon's Rune, a charm most beloved of the companions upon the Crooked Path. The charm is recited thrice and should be accompanied by dance and musick to exalt the com-panie of man and spirit - as one within the vision of the fire-encompassed circle. During this paean the earth is scourged with knotted cords, with daggers, and with burning staves of wood taken from the hearth. Such deeds are intended to magically cut the burning furrow of the Dragon-road, to quicken the blood within the veins of the world and to signify the scattering of the burning witch-seed from the loins of the serpent. By the on-lay of this empowerment the threefold and fourfold arcana, of the triple exorcisms and quarter-salutations respectively, are aligned in the circle's midst and create the emblazoned point of stellar radiance: the seven-rayed star - the sign foreshadowing the raising of the Dragon's seven heads. At its completion the chant may be closed and focused with the Sorcerer's Cry. All initiates shall then return unto their appointed stations in preparation for the utterance of the mystery \"ichin mystery ... 8) The Charge to the Shadow From beyond the sevenfold radiance of the hearth-star, the Way of the Shadow is cast to breach the darkness of endless night - as the bridge to-and-from the voidwise source of the Crooked Path. This arcanum, the Way of Infernal Descent, is revealed in the eighth stage of the Oracle Rite. Let all conjoin in the exaction of this secret; in unison let the Quadriga pronounce the Shadow's Charge. By the pronouncement of The Charge the twilit gate is opened. An interstitial route betwixt Life and Death is unveiled to reveal the direct path to the heart of the Black Sun: the empower-ing root of initiation. Through this final conjuration the numen of the ritual is imaged as the Spirit-guardian of the Crooked Path, as the Isolate Wanderer, the masquerading dancer upon the divagant ley of the infinite spirit-procession."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium G2nomosia D.raco'Taus Without name, the Sovereign Wraith of the Dragon-road is summoned to lead the Ever-living Souls of the Blessed and to guide the night-rade of the Mighty Dead. The Shadow is called forth as the quintessential embodiment of the Mystery that traverses the manifold vehicula of all sorcerous power. The Spirit is adjured by many means and in many guises, shifting, dividing and unifying the focus of the Seeker's intent between and across the boundaries of force and form. The summoning through divers means is at one with the alchymic transmorphosis of the Seeker's awareness; the identity of being is translated through the transmutative focus of the enchantment. The Charge calls forth the Shadow, the Spirit of the Cemetery, to step upon the hot-point of the Seeker's own death - the gateway opened through his own self-sacrifice, and thereby establishes the place of convergence for every potentiality of his being. At this cross-roads of possibilities all entity unifies within the momentary opportunity for absolute change: the Spirit dances within the heart of Chance, determining the rhythm oflife-blood and guiding the procession of magical powers through the cause-ways of fate. The nature of The Charge is to draw the initiate into the labyrinth of the Crooked Path and therein to augment the realisation of the Voidful Self-existant I. The locus of perception is severed from every fixed attachment and is made mobile through the simultaneous identity of Self and all Other in the many-masked procession of the spirits: the retinue of the Gods, the Living and the Dead. The hot-point, the magically empowered nexus of the Charge, moves the awareness of the Seeker between the visible and invisible congregants of the Blood-acre. The Mysterium of I is communicated through the division and unity of Self within the pres-ent consciousness of the adjurant as it moves from form to form through the infinite angles of Being and Becoming. Each station of awareness is realised as an autonomous ipseity and as a co-emergent dependent, as unique expansiveness and as a constituent facet of the whole matrix. The Voidwise realisation of Self is translated as Gnosis through the motion of perception in freedom beyond the point of absolute immutability. Within the sacrificial fire all returns to its adamantine source; to be destroyed or to pass beyond. From out of the immolatory pyre the liberated numen of the Death-born initiate is identi-fied and addressed as the Lady and Lord of the Path, as the Corpse-queen and King, as his own Witch-mother and Witch-father, as both the extent of the Circle and the Sacred Vessel, and finally - to resolve each and every force and form -is summoned within the body of Qayin as the Turnskin Child: the first-born initiate of the Dragon-road. Through the repeated working of the rite countless views and insights will arise to reveal the Arcanum of the Shadow. Let the focus of its address be changed as befits the predilection of the Seeker, the seasons of his heart, and the shifting temperament of his rites. Its call should be of-fered, even as the feast of the sorcerer's body to the lips of the Dragon's urn. For as the Spirit of the Shadow is summoned anew it shall forever transform itself and its summoner. The many interpretations of this arcanum are both Truth and Lie. 108"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle Concerning the Gathering of the Ashes from the Pyre of the Black Sun (Observed solely at Midwinter) When all have concluded The Charge to the Shadow, it is the ordained time for the collection of ashes from the Midwinter hearth. At the sign of the Circle's Master all communicants of the Black Sun will step toward the hearth, bearing forth their new and empty vessels. As one alone amidst many, each member of the covine shall gather seven pinches of ash from the cremated forms of the old vessels and inter these as an offering within the body of their own newborn urn. Each shall then gather earthen dust from the eight ways of the Blood-acre's compass to bind the circle to their own unique image of magical power. When all offerings have been made from the hearth and circle of the old year unto the heart and idol-the Dragon-vessel of the new year, the initiates shall uplift their vessels in unison. Using the Sorcerer's Cry, each shall offer seven breaths into the mouth of their Dragon-vessel. Then, once more in unison, in a single gesture of hand and mind, they shall seal and bind their vessels -ensorcelling the Black Sun within the Vrn of Azhdeha. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE RITE:-WHEN THE VESSELS have been sealed and all adjunctive personal deeds of Arte have been ful-filled, the Master shall lead the recitation of the appointed charm of consummation. In keeping \\\\ith the words thereof, all shall place a knot upon their sacred cord; for there-upon, with each celebration of the .Midwinter Feast, a new knot shall be tied and this shall serve as a sign of the pact between the Serpent and Man. As is the custom, the Rite of Midwinter shall be ended with a silent pacing of the Circle. The Quadriga shall carry their newborn vessels, thrice withershins about the Blood-acre's edge. At the fulfilment of this deed all shall return unto their appointed quarters. The Master of the Circle shall then signal and declare that all initiates should move one station round in a with-ershins direction: the Old Master shall fall and the New shall arise, even in the manner of the descent and ascent of the Dragon-vessels. For whosoever rises in the place of the North shall assume the vicegerent power of the Hidden Initiator. According to the direction of the Spirit and the motion of their own heart, the newly risen >0Yereign of the Blood-acre shall utter the final words of the rite, even making prophecy for the year ahead. For thereafter he shall lead the covine for a single year, even until the next celebra-tion of the Rite of the Black Sun. In honour of the New Master or Mistress of the Quadriga, all ocher brethren shall offer a single prostration to the North. It is also worthy to give account of certain customs of the Cunning Arte which have arisen in this time of transition:-firstly, there is the Passing-on of the Stang from the Old Master to the New. This is to signal the succession of power from one to another. Secondly, it is custom for the Old Master to bestow .i. personal gift upon the New; both to bless and to demonstrate the good-will inherent in the dttd. of handing-over the task of the covine's governing. \\\\lien all such Words and Deeds of the Rite are done, the covine shall seal the Mystery by bearing their new vessels in hand whilst leaping over the fiery grave of the old year. By the _111hilant utterance of the Sorcerer's Cry, the pyre shall be crossed; the Child shall o'erstep the burning ground of its own Begetter. 109"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo~ia Draco'Taus The Mystery being bound and sealed, the covine should join in a mutual feast of pleasure and sustenance, offering all joy and thanks unto the guardian spirits of the ritual ground. As it is written, so let it be done. Such is the basis of method and manner for the first application of the Oracle Rite. ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY for the First Application Concerning the Sacrifice of the Sacred Vessels:-GIVEN THE SUBTIL nature of this Mystery it is deemed germane for further comment to be made concerning the sacrifice of the Sacred Vessels, both to explicate the basis of knowledge -the Teachings of the Path-and to grant insight into possible ways of practical adaptation. According to custom, the Midwinter Rite consummating the first working of the Hieros Gamos is the occasion for the first formal and ritual convocation of the Quadriga. By the sac-rifice of the four vessels within the single pyre of that rite the four unique paths trodden by the initiates of the covine are made to converge - to meet as one in the interstitial moment. The offering of the Marriage-vessel to the fire creates and opens the point of primal initiation. This establishes the point of both atemporal inception and temporal re-turn. By the communal sacrifice of the vessels at the hands of the Quadriga the union of divers ways and means is obtained. This conjunction of uniquely empowered offerings within the single deed forms the root-sacrifice of the Crooked Path and obtains a mutual empowerment for all of its communicants. And as the four ways meet, so the four ways part. The bodies of the four sacrificed vessels are torn asunder and married together by the hands of the solstice fire. All are conjoined within the death of the old year. When the old vessels have been broken and burned to mere ashes, each initiate gathers embers from the hearth and places these, as the fiery seed of witchdom, within the new and empty forms of the Dragon-urn. This deed is the harvest at midnight and is celebrated by tears and laughter by turns. For at this nuptial funeral each initiate is as merry as the archimime and as solemn as the corpse-bearer, balanced in honour and guile, full-wise in the knowledge of his self-overcoming. When the ordained offerings have been placed with the newborn Dragon-vessel, it is customary for each initiate to take - to jestingly steal - a relic of sacrifice from each companion's fire-broken vessel. Such tokens are tied upon a cord or placed within his own Dragon-vessel as a trophy from the battlefield. The fetish-belt formed of such relics signifies the ambivalent bond of kinship, the cord of perfect trust and the noose of un-yielding treachery, that lies between the children of the snake. When all offerings from the pyre have been interred within and tied about the newborn Dragon-vessels, they may all receive a fresh offering of blood and saliva from each member of the circle. This affirms the covenant that unites and divides the Dragon's brood. Thereafter the appropriate charm of consumma-tion shall be spoken; the rite and the vessels shall be sealed and bound as previously described. As a sign of initiation and to signify the act of direct empowerment from the Hidden Initiator, 110"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"111"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"q.rimo.rium G2nomosia D.raco'Taus the Dragon-vessel should be touched to the feet and then to the crown of the head; the Seeker is thus shod and crowned with the Image of the lmageless One. And as the four ways part, so shall the four ways meet again .... After the first solstitial working of the Oracle Rite the Quadriga may meet at the ordained tides of the year to undertake the many tasks of the path, as befits their predilection. For those that would convene at the times of Hu, Sa, Ba, la, Ku, La, Tan and Hua the basic forms of the rites are given herein and constitute the main body of this grammary. Elsewise let them convene again at each Midwinter. For so long as each fulfils the yearly re-affirmation of the Marriage Rite and is desirous of communal practise, then shall the initiates of the brood gather together each year upon the Night of Longest Darkness to make and re-establish the point of primal initiation. The annual solstitial convocation of the Quadriga creates the point of inception and consummation within the circle of the year and marks the transliminal place of magical communion for the wayfarers of the path within the cycles of time and attainment. Within the midnight of the Black Sun the ways of ancestry and futurity meet at the crossroads of the beginning and the end. The temporal cycles of Helios, Luna, Terra and Sarkia -the wheels of lesser reckoning - attain conjunction and transcendence in the synastrian circle of the Zeroth Mystery: the gyre of eternal reckoning. The Teaching of Extracting the Essence:-THE HOT-POINT OF the Midwinter Rite manifests the crossroads at which all ways may meet, transform and part again. In undertaking this rite the practitioners of every divers kind of magi-cal wisdom may establish a means by which the innermost essence of their own unique path may be unveiled and revitalised. Whether alone or within the Quadriga, the autoclastic deed of offering the Sacred Vessel to the Midwinter fire is the very act whereby the individual's magi-cally empowered being is returned unto its source, to pass beyond, to die, or to be revivified. Every single deed of initiation through which that individual has passed is placed once more upon the root of its creation. The essence of the Seeker's path is extracted within the Point of the Black Sun and receives the root-empowerment of the Magical Quintessence Itself. It is not by a combination of many outer forms that this secret is revealed, but by a return of all paths to their birthplace beyond all time and manifestation. Nor shall a way of uniformity issue from this wellspring, but each unique route of the Seeker to the fire shall give rise to a unique manner of revitalisation. The empowerment granted in this Mysterium creates an initiatory bond-a compact which serves to align the informing currents from the many magical traditions and spiritual lineages of the world within the single heart of the Magical Quintessence. By vertu of their return unto the very source of magical power the many ways are revivified and transformed in unique reali-sations of their inmost nature. Within the black-golden point of infernal descent the initiatory flame of Azhdeha burns as the eternal lumen, the serpent-fire within the adytum of all magi-cal wisdom; therein the many ways of knowledge are perceived to align and transmute,-to be cast forth anew in forms unique unto each wayfarer. By vertu of our dreaming vision each true journeyman of the Crooked Path may obtain the blessing, teaching and empowerment from every divers way that has conjoined within the pyre of this most sacred ordalium. For about the Hidden Circle of the Companions the many Masters and Guardians of Our Arte stand to watch and ward. By the magisterial power of the Antient Dragon, by the pact of the Black Sun, the World's djinn are convened, and as one are sworn to protect and to hone the Teachings of this 1U,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle Ever-turning Path. Throughout all the field of the world the companions of the Dragon's brood shall bring forth their sacrifice unto the many-placed pyre and, with each successive year, many hands shall bear the visible images of the imageless: the corpse-idols of all being. All as one and each as no other, we shall fulfil the Promise of the World-field's End and vouchsafe the Oath of the Sorcerous Rede. With each year the Spirit of the Crooked Path shall give and take anew in the self-trans-formation of its own nature. A single flame burns within the many hearths that shall attain unto these deeds. This is the Vagitus: the birth-cry for the newborn way of the Royal Arte. Concerning the consecration of magical weapons at Midwinter:-BEFORE THE SACRED Vessel is offered to the Midwinter pyre it is customarily shrouded in many layers of cloth. Throughout the course of the year a new cerement is placed about the Yessel at each dark lunar working (See Commentary upon the Mystery of the Black Moon). \\\\'ithin these shrouds certain metal objects such as coins, nails, horse-shoes and daggers may be interred. When the vessel is cast into the solstitial forge it is considered that the empowerment of the Initiator infuses such objects with magical force and consecrates them unto the service of the Crooked Path. \\\\ ben the spirit of the fire so permits, the aspirant should return unto the place of the ritual hearth and collect such flame-blessed objects. It is useful for many coins to be passed through the forge in this manner, for such are often used as talismanic disks during the course of the ocher rites throughout the year. The passing of one's ritual blade through the Midwinter fire is considered to signify the alchymic transmutation of one's own being and to foreshadow the reception of the teaching known as 'The Honing of the Sword with the Light of the Seven Stars'. Concerning the manner in which an initiate should leave the Quadriga:-IF AX IXITIATE wishes to leave the Quadriga, either permanently or for but a season of the bean, then it is deemed that they should appoint another to take their position in the Circle of the Four Guardians. Being found acceptable by the remaining brethren, the new candidate shall enter the path by the fulfilment of Ka and by the offering of their vessel within the fire of the brood. If a companion of the Quadriga should die, then let their vessel be brought unto the fire of :\\lidwinter, even as the very substance of their body. By the passing down of their ashes, even as the \\\\itch-seed to the vessel of their successor, the lineage shall be established from age unto age. Beyond these considerations the Quadriga should ideally be disbanded at the agreement of .ill its brethren. If it be so desired the respective initiates may pursue the path seperately and com·ene at such a time when all deem it needful. All such matters should be exacted according w the subtil counsel of the Hidden Intercessor of the Way. Concerning the Direction of the Path and the Use of the Vessel after Midwinter:-.UTER THE RITE of the Black Sun has been worked the four initiates of the Quadriga shall d,n;de until the appointed time for their next meeting; each shall pursue the path according to their own devising. If so agreed by all initiates the Guardian of the North, being the Master or :\\lisrress of the covine, may determine the cycle of magical praxes to be undertaken between the 113"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"G:rimorium G~nomosia. Dra.co'Ta.us times of convocation. Such matters should be decided and discussed during the informal meet-ings or esbats of the brood. Congruency of practice between the members of the covine will permit a greater comprehension of the many subtil rhythms comprising the ophidian current and will also provide a means for the unitive convocation of the circle within the oneiric realms of the Sevenfold Double-house -the Dreaming Temple ofla-Koluah. Between the times of Quadrigan convocation the Dragon-vessel is used as the focus of the domiciliary shrine. Immediately after the Midwinter Rite the Seeker should engage in a basic mode of practice such as 'Hallowing the Kingdom'. This should be undertaken as a regular con-templative discipline for the days leading up to the next Full or Dark Moon, which ever comes first. Then, at that time, the practice of the Stellar Tranvocation should commence as directed, (See appropriate section). Throughout all such Methods of the Arte the Dragon-vessel is es-tablished and utilised as the centre of the magician's existence: the point about which all things rotate in the design of will. The Lore of Our Arte concerning the opening and closing of the Dragon-vessel must be well noted and dutifully observed by all practitioners; for therein is a great secret concerning the hidden domain of our brethren. Let all remember and take heed. The Sacred Urn of Our Diablerie, newborn from the solstitial hearth, must remain sealed from the end of the Midwinter Rite until the time of the next Dark Moon: the ordained occa-sion for the Mystery of the Black Moon. And thereafter, upon each dark lunar node throughout the year, the Rite of the Oracle shall be exacted thuswise according to the Sublime Teachings of the Lightless Moon. Within the internity of the sealed vessel the sacred time and space of the black-golden inter-stice is ensorcelled as the unique dimension of the sorcerer's power: the transliminal kingdom of the Black Sun's Arcanum. By the opening of the vessel at the ordained times of darkness throughout the ritual year the gateway is revealed to-and-from the Aeon of Negation, the Aeon of all Aeons. Through this doorway of all-sacrifice the Seeker may step outside of all temporal boundaries and re-enter the sacred time manifested through the Midwinter Circle: the sacral chroneme of I. Concerning the Solitary Observance of the Midwinter Rite:-THE WAY OF the Crooked Path befits the soul of the hermit in his loneliness, his all-becoming. For such as He and such as She, the Hieros Gamos may be consummated using the Rite of the Black Sun in a manner like unto that described above. Throughout all aspects of the rite the isolate sorcerer shall undertake each task and step within the Blood-acre at his own direction, even at the behest of the Lone Spirit ofDraku Ezhu. Upon all who undertake this Mystery alone, may the Blessing, the Cursing and the Cunning Be! For indeed, whether in covine or in the outward appearance of solitude, the Crooked Path is forever trodden alone ... all as one and each as no other, do we sojourn in the Companie of the Exiled Wayfarers. For such is the nature of our pilgrimage: the Hermit-Path revealed unto the fugitive souls of all Wiseblood. Such is the Way of Our Divine Return to the Eternal Eden ofKahu. 11.4 Here ends the first part of the Commentary of the Three Ways and the Three Times."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle II: The Mystery of the Black Moon BEING THE SUBLIME TEACHING OF THE LIGHTLESS MOON THE MYSTERY OF the Black Moon is the name given to the Rite of the Draconian Oracle when it is worked at the hallowed times of the fully waned sphere of Luna, that is, upon the eve of each New Moon throughout the sacred year. Upon these dates, being of subtil alignment unto the time of the Black Sun, the Dragon-vessel is opened and the sorcerer may attain unto the re-entrancement of the Zeroth Arcanum. The opening, feeding and re-sealing of the fetish-urn at these appointed times forms the ritual's central act: the Feast of the Black Moon. An akhymic banquet, a sacrificial agapae wrought of flesh and blood, is offered betwixt Man and the Elder Gods upon the altar-table of the Draconic Athanor. The orientation of the entire ritual proce-dure is located about the magical hot-point of the sorcerous urn: the crossways for every path is revealed within the graal-cauldron of Qayin Azhaka. It is thus, in esbatic discourse, that the ritual is simply referred to as 'The Vessel Rite'. As its names and epithets may augur, this especial application of the Oracle Rite is under-taken upon the twelve or thirteen occasions of the fully-waned moon throughout the year and is, according to the lore of Our Arte, performed by each initiate in the state of eremitage,-alone in the presence of the Dragon-vessel. With no other than the Sacred Vessel of Azhdeha shall this mystery be fulfilled. The rite may be worked within the Plot of the Blood-acre, but it is considered most wise for that domain to be kept aside for the nine times of greater convocation. It is therefore commended, by both experience and custom, that the Feast of the Black Moon be celebrated within the iso-late sanctuary of the domiciliary shrine: the Altar of the Home-hearth. The contemplative lo-cation for the compass of the rite may therefore be wheresoever the mind may imagine,-in any quarter of the world, in the deepest caverns of stone or atop the eyrie of the highest mountain, in the scorched bone-garth of the desert or within the whirlpool's isle of stillness. Wherever the Dragon-vessel is placed, in mind or in matter, there lies the heart of the world. Being held at regular intervals throughout the year the dark lunar working of the Oracle Rite serves to punctuate the cycle of all other practices and to re-affirm the essentially solitary nature of the Seeker upon the Crooked Path. With the opening of the vessel at these temporal junctures a crossroads of the timely and the timeless is made and therein the gate of the black-golden interstice is re-opened. The double-way of turn and return within the primal point of empowerment is re-established for each and every wayfarer upon the path. Uniquely alone, and yet as one with the commity of all the Dragon's brood, the practitioner re-enters the sacred aeon: the moment of initiation into the Magical Quintessence. From this timeless time the Seeker steps forth in liberation, his direction deviating anew into the hooks and crooks of the unknowable way. The true purpose of the Mysterium of the Lightless Moon is revealed through its actuation; \\\\ith each working-each occasion of its exaction -the manifold nature of the arcanum is per-ceived anew. Even though it be worked a thousand times its secret can never be wholly divulged."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Grimorium 6)!nomosia Draco1Ta.us RITUAL PROCEDURE THE DARK MOON working is unique to each occasion of its celebration and will differ in its interpretation for each individual practitioner, varying in its method and manner according to the many subtil nuances of the Arte. The turning wheel of heaven shall be reflected within the changing seasons of the earth; the thirteen tides of the lunar year shall be seen within the postural cypher of the body, heart and mind. For the lightless disk of the moon is the mirror of the midnight sun and of all that passes beneath in the Eden of the Night-without-End. The M ysterium of I is the infinite circle of ekstasis, the horizon of every sacrificial negation, ensor-celled by the ouroboros of time-within-time. It is the jewel of unnumbered angles, the diamond of primordial wisdom, wherein the spectrum of perception is cast forth in every possible per-spective of belief. Within this rite the soul is cast down into the Dragon's jaws, even as the very cosmos into the Apollyon nadir; and there, in the athanor of all transmutation, it passes through the eternal moment of change: the Great Ordeal. From the opened mouth of the Antient One the soul returns imbued with the gnosis of the Crooked Path, empowered with the newborn perception of the sorcerous nature. Within this Mystery all action, conception and motion of consciousness are dissolved within the single droplet of the Draconian elixir; the .field of earth is purified in the flood-tide of primal inundation; all worlds are absorbed in the pearl of black light. By the eucharist of the ophionic essence, the dimensionless point is sealed as the heart of the sorcerer: the knowledge of the path is realised as flesh. Yet whosoever would undertake this Communion must know that its tincture may grant the life that is beyond all life or may absolve all mortality in death. The double-edged blade turns anew with each step upon the path. An exemplar of ritual procedure is here given as a foundation for initial observance and as a basis for adaptation:-ln the .final hours of the waning moon, in the time before the unseen waxing of her light, the Mystery of the Draconian Oracle shall be worked in the hermitage of solitude. Therefore let the Seeker prepare himself in the spirit-companie of his shrine, even in the thrice-hallowed Kingdom of Qayin. Being prepared in mind, body and soul, the rite shall proceed thuswise, each according to their own predilection ... The shrine should be illumined with new candles and perfumed with incense pleasing to the spirits. A cloth should be laid out upon the floor in the image of the sacred plot. Its colour should befit the season of the year and the kalas of the stars. The Dragon-vessel should be placed in the centre of the cloth and all around it the divers requisites of Arte should be arranged: arthana, cup, bowl, bell, bone-trumpet, eight staves of wood, servitor-vessels containing offer-ings ... and so forth. Attention and Intent should centre upon the vessel. Throughout the procedure of the ritual the imaginal actions and visualisations may be based upon those used for the Midwinter Feast of the Black Sun; the place of the central hearth being transposed to the point of the vessel. Ad-ditional visualisations are given where relevant. o) The Opening Gestures of Veneration The gift of a single coin should be laid before the Dragon-vessel as the token of one's entry into the circle of the Mystery. A single bow should also be offered as a sign to the Image of the Un-116"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":":Rite of the Draconian Oracle known Initiator. The guardian-spirits of the shrine should then be greeted with the musick of bone-trumpet and drum, together with further offerings of incense and prayer. 1) The Oracle:-When the initial acts of veneration have been completed the Oracle of the Elder Worship may be spoken. It should be recited as both a soliloquy of the Seeker's heart and as an address to the invisible companie of the Dragon's brood. At the close of the recitation the vessel itself should be opened. A single note should be struck upon the ritual bell as a sign of this deed. 2) The Declaration and the Chant of the Tree:-The Declaration should then be recited to establish the dual nature of the path emanating from the point of oracular inception. The opened vessel is visualised as the fiery gateway from whence all emanations arise and into which all sacrifice is offered. The seven utterances of the Sorcerer's Cry should be used to empower the momentum of the sacrifice, to hurl the awareness of the Seeker into the hot-point of the rite. At the commencement of the Chant of the Tree an object, such as a forked stave of wood or a lighted candle, may be placed in the aperture of the vessel to symbolise the Upright Column. Elsewise let the axis be visualised in accordance with the three verses of the charm: as the world-tree betwixt zenith and nadir, as the upright stang of the Master, as the downward path of inver-sion, and as the perpendicular bridge of fire - forever endwise to the world of clay. When the Declaration and the Chant have been completed, the visualisation of the column should be expanded to engulf the entire area of the shrine. At the centre of the burning com-pass of light the mouth of the vessel should remain open, a-gape in readiness for the cycles of sacrificial offering. 3) The Triple Exorcisms:-The three charms of exorcism should then be used; Fire, Salt, then Water. Each charm in turn should be simultaneously addressed -without differentiation - to the Seeker, the Sacred Vessel and to the particular substances of its offering. The exorcisms are thus used to align the states of waking, sleeping and dreaming, and to purify the threefold matrix of essence upon which the substance of physical manifestation resides. Divers offerings are purified within this part of the rite, each being perceived as aspects of the sorcerer's own being:-ln turn, each offering is placed within a bowl, the form of which should be visualised as one's own skull. The charms of exorcism are recited to transform the three substances into the feast-offering of triune essence. The transmuted offerings are finally offered to the Dragon, to the Body of Communion between Man and the Elder Gods. The contact between the bowl and the vessel signifies the lineal succession between the Dragon-vessels of yesteryear and the passing-down of empowerment from the skull of Qayin to the skull of his present-day kin. The offer-ing of the three gifts of fire, salt and water signifies the union of the mind and its various states within the primordial void of the Initiating Psyche."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Grimol'ium Gxnomoeia Draco'Tau.e The basic procedure for the working of the exorcisms is as follows:-I) The Exorcism of Fire For the first exorcism an offering of burning incense and smouldering powders should be pre-pared within the skull-bowl (a bowl of metal or shell). The substance should be kept alight by the fanning motion of a feather and empowered by the insufflatory offering of breath through the trumpet of bone. The charm of exorcism should be recited over the vessel and the substance of fire. Throughout the charm's utterance the vessel should be fumigated with the incense. At the completion of the charm the offering should be interred within the vessel. The gift should be perceived as the fiery essence released from every sacrifice, as the fire of Midwinter, as the smouldering pyre of all fleshly cremation, and as the body of spirits moving within the vortex of the vessel's mouth. 11) The Exorcism of Salt For the second exorcism an offering of salt should be prepared within the bowl. The substance of the salt should consist of bone-dust, graveyard earth, ashes from the Blood-acre's hearth, co-mingled in a base powder formed from the calcination of sexual fluids and menses. The charm should be recited over the vessel and the bowl of powders. During the recitation the substance should be sprinkled within and around the vessel. The nature and form of the offering should be transformed by imagination into the bone-dust of all the Mighty Dead and should be per-ceived as the very bone-seed of the sorcerer, cast forth to be purified for the future generation of all Wise blood. At the completion of the charm the bowl should be emptied within the vessel's mouth. III) The Exorcism of Water For the third exorcism an offering of water should be prepared within the bowl. This offering should ideally be of nine forms, amongst which should be the waters of the sun and moon -sexual fluids and menses; the waters of the flesh-blood, milk, urine, saliva and tears; the wa-ters of the field - oils, wine, rain and dew; and the waters of the seven seas - from ocean, lake, river, pool and well. The offering of sexual fluids and blood should be made straightwise from the flesh at the time of the exorcism and placed directly into the skull-bowl. During the reverie of the sexual fluid's emission a mantic formula or prayerful utterance should be repeated. (See Form Interpretation). The blood-offering should be made using the arthana to open the flesh and therefrom draw forth the libation of the heart. \\Vi thin the skull-bowl, the substance of 'wa-ter' may be transformed by imagination to partake of the blood and seed of all sacrifice and to embody the fluidic essence of all living. It is thus that the lustral offering becomes the oracular mirror, the speculum wherein the beholder may scry the wyrd of the path and foresee the way ahead. When all fluids have been offered to the bowl the charm of exorcism should be recited over them. Throughout the spell the elixir should be used to asperge the vessel and cloth. At the spell's completion the offering should be poured within the opened mouth of the spirit-urn, leaving the bowl devoid of all substance. 118"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle When the three exorcisms have been fulfilled the Binding Charm should be spoken to seal the deeds of offering. This incantation intends the transformation of the triune essences of the sorcerer within the vessel: the unification of the waking, sleeping and dreaming forms/states of the aspiring consciousness with the single, undifferentiated point of the Perfect Mind. The crossroads of the three ways is established within the heart of the vessel. During the Binding Charm's utterance the imaginal form of the offering bowl as the practi-tioner's skull is to be wholly transfered to the Dragon-vessel. The vessel is thus to be perceived as the single form of the skull-cauldron, as the skull of the Initiate and the Initiator, even as the skull of all ancestral bodies, reaching backward in time through the lineages of sentient trans-mission unto the mystical point of the first-slain vessel of the Hieros Gamos. The pathway of this transformation terminates within the realisation that the Dragon-vessel and the Seeker's consciousness are unified as the single body of transmission for the Gnosis of the Hidden In-tercessor. The process of the exorcisms may be perceived as the way of return for the three roads oflife to their source: the sangraal of primordial being. The exorcisms of fire, salt and water delineate the course of the three roads to their point of convergence within the Dragon-vessel. This may be seen as the triple pathway of the flesh backward to its primal birthplace: the womb of the . .\\11-mother. The threefold numeration of this arcanum is reflected in a secret celestial pattern of the lunar cycle, where three nine-day phases may be respectively ascribed to the auspices of the waxing, full and waning faces of the moon. The timely course of the complete cycle is ended and begun anew in the hallowed time of the opened vessel. The Dark of the Moon is the crossways unifying the three powers and, by the words and deeds of Arte, becomes the gateway of their transcendence, leading to the hidden aeon beyond the horizon of time. It is worthy of consid-eration that the periodicity established by the monthly Dark Moon working and the opening of the vessel creates a magical simulcra of menstrual synchrony between all practitioners of the Crooked Path and thereby the great bond of kinship is forged through the sacrificial blood of all the Dragon's brood. The feast-offering of the three essences signifies the realisation of the vessel as the meeting-place for the three roads oflife. The ever-moving point of their unification is the perpetuity of awareness: the paradaisal ekstasis of the black-golden interstice. This is reified as the numen of the lych-light or corpse-sleep, the state of magical consciousness betwixt the three ways of wak-ing, sleeping and mere worldly dreaming. The trance of the rite is the fourth road, the hidden way, leading beyond and between into the nocturnal Eden. With the stabilisation of the unified state the first form of the magical circle is cast and is felt as a distinct en-closing of the ritual domain. The transformation of the vessel into the form of the Master's skull signifies the route of consciousness beyond the point of the triune crossroads. In the transitive stage between the exorcisms and the quarter-salutations the sorcerer is said to walk forth from the mystical point of the three ways to that of the four ways, from the crossroads oflife to the crossroads of death. In the Form Interpretation of the rite this stage is seen as the journey from the womb of the All-mother to the tomb of the All-father. 4) The Quarter Salutations When the third stage of the rite has been concluded the Dragon-vessel should be oriented to the four cardinal directions of the compass. It should be picked up in both hands and offered to the four ways in turn. It should then be returned to the centre of the cloth. The charms of the Quarter-guardians should then be recited, each with suitable visualisations and offerings."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"<lrimo.rium G~nomoeia Draco'Ta.us The contemplative deeds of imaginal transformation should be based upon those advised for Midwinter. If the practitioner is a member of a fourfold covine the forms of the Serpent-watchers may firstly be visualised as the respective members of the circle. Their forms may then be transmuted to the deific natures of the four elemental serpents. During the salutation and visualisation of the divine quaternion further offerings should be made around and within the vessel. The giving of the quarter-offerings should be regarded as the empowerment of the vessel with the auspicious signs of the world's four directions. The ves-sel is here treated as the unique dimension of sorcerous reality wherein all that the practitioner would coerce to his will must be interred. This may be accomplished through imagination or by physical actuation. The forms of such offerings may be thus:-coins for wealth, good fortune and for the payment of the spirits; herbs for healing or poisoning; talismans written upon pa-per - each burned as it is placed in the vessel; wish-fulfilling amulets, signs of desire and need; tokens of aught that would be drawn to the practitioner and tokens of aught that would be sacrificed to feed the spirits of the path; feathers for swift flight in dreams; nails for fixing and hexing; images oflove, mommets of hatred, and every manner and mannikin of remembrance. All should be offered to the point of transformation, for therein all will come to serve the in-trepid journeyman upon the Dragon-road. 5) The Making of the Pentalphic Signs During each of the four salutations the left and right hands are used to make the signs of the averse and upright pentalpha to the directions of the compass. The signs are used to welcome and charge the body of the Divine Quadriga and to signify the alignment of the practitioner's senses to the focus of the rite's intent. The following charms serve to impart the arcana of the double pentalphic sign, to illustrate the correspondences between the senses and the parts of the hand, and may be used as a con-templative means for the initial attainment and empowerment of their magical gestures. In the Out-turn 'd Sign of the Left Hand I summon the Light of the Falling Star and the Ascending Power of the Flame-bearing Horn. Here to illumine the Risen Land and to carve the skyfurrow for the endless path of the midnight-blackened snake. Upon the thumb ... a leaden disk, heavy as the burden of flesh, wrought from the mountain's root. Upon the forefinger ... a bitter-beftowered wreath of thorn, torn from the thicket at the cemetery's edge. Upon the middlefmger ... a drum, fashioned from the skull of a murdered beast, skinned with my own body's raiment and sounded by the beating wings of the corvine flock. Upon the ringfinger ... the skull-cup of my fourfaced witchfather,filled with the dried fragments of my ancestral bodies, the tattered pages of skin and the bones crack'd by the gnashing teeth of passing ages.

In the Out-turn 'd Sign of the Right Hand I summon the Light of the Rising Star and the Descending Power of the Lightning-bearing Horn. Here to illumine the sky and to carve the World-field's furrow for the timeless path of the blood-red snake. Upon the thumb ... a disk of gold, light as pleasure's embrace, wrought from the jewell'd peak of the rainbow's arch. Upon the forefinger ... a sweet garland of life-restoring flowers, o'er-brimming with fragrant balms, pluck'd from the grove at the sun-path's limit. Upon the middle finger ... a trumpet, fashioned from the femur-bone of my lover's body, filled with whispered promise of the world's seduction, ululant with the shriek of all pleasured flesh. Upon the ring-finger ... the skull-cup of my fourfaced witch-mother, filled with the charnel-broth of my unborn children, brimming with spirits eager for birth. In the palm ... the waking eye of my soul, an isle in the ocean of unfettered darkness, shored by the mask and the body of the brightest day. These are the offerings of my Right Hand, made to the Circle of the Watchers Four. These are the Offerings consumed in the flames, in the fire of the Rising Fivefold Star. To the four ways of the Blood-acre I make the double-sign of the Hand and Eye. By the power of imagination I conjoin the twain: I marry the Twin Sigillae of Light-bearer and Night-wanderer upon the hidden altars of the sky. Upon the Altar of the Red Bull's Eye, Al Debaran, so mote it be! Upon the Altar of the White Fish's jaw, Fum al hut, so mote it be! Upon the Altar of the Pallid Scorpion's Heart, Al Kalb alAkrab, so mote it be! Upon the Altar of the Sable Lion's Heart, Al Kalb al Asad, so mote it be! In the Name of the Intercessor that walks between, this Enchantment is done! 6) The Salutation of the Heights, Centre and Depths As each quarter-salutation is spoken the outward projection of the double-sign should be at-tained upon its respective node of the compass. The empowerment of the Watcher is called forth to reflect and return the outward blessing upon the central point of the vessel. When the signs and powers of the four guardians have been conjoined the form of the Dragon-vessel should be imagined as the Master's skull resting upon a crossroads of bone. At this point the binding charms and axial salutations to zenith, centre and nadir may be performed. The skull-form of the vessel should be perceived as though it were wrought of clear adamantine crystal, illuminating the entire area of the shrine. 1~1"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"<lrimorium G2nomosia Draco'Taus The Chant of the Eight Trees:-The rite should proceed by the utterance of the Chant of the Eight Trees. This is to be accompa-nied by the offering of bark and wood-slivers to the mouth of the vessel. As the charm is recited these should be cut directly from eight small staves of the appropriate woods. The powers of all wort-cunning are thus placed within the athanor of the sorcerous reality and thereby the knowledge of greenwood and field shall return unto the deed-fulfiller. This shall come to pass by divers means, by auspicious signs and chance, by dreaming instruction and by the teaching of the dryads' own voice. The eight offerings should be sealed by a gift of mistletoe and oak to signify the crown of the witch-king and queen. The eight staves used upon the occasion of the Dark Moon should each be about a hand's span in length. Aside from their offertory use, they may be employed for sortilege - a method of augury derived from a body of lore known as 'Waylandry'. At the end of a rite the staves should be entreated to reveal the design of chance and thereafter should be cast down upon the floor. The form and pattern of their positions should be copied onto paper and transformed into a sigil. This should be placed beneath one's head at night and thereby slept upon. In dreams, the Waylander's Sign shall bespeak its hidden meaning. 7) The Dragon's Rune When the divers offerings of Crown, bough and leaf have been made the Circle-chant of the Oracle Rite should be recited. The Dragon-vessel is to be picked up in both hands and sym-bolically oriented to the horizon's extent by being moved around in a circular fashion, even as though one were churning the invisible cauldron of the aire. The vessel should be oriented in both deosil and withershins directions, and all the while of its dance the Rune should be spoken in the seven tones of enchantment. The visualised form of the vessel as the skull-cauldron of the Draconian Psyche should be seen to expand to the world's edge, sending forth innumerable rays of the seven colours of the rainbow, even the very radiance of the peacock-feathered serpent. When the Rune has been recited for so long as is deemed needful the vessel should be returned to the centre of the cloth. The seven-hued irradiance of the imaginal form should be withdrawn and should itself be of-fered into the vessel's mouth. Intent should then focus upon the physical basis of the spirit-urn as both the womb and the grave of the practitioner's being. 8) The Charge to the Shadow When the seven stages of the Oracle Rite have been accomplished the concluding enchantment, the Charge to the Shadow, should be spoken to the Hidden Spirit within the Dragon-vessel. The manner in which the Charge is to be worked is unique to all; its mystery revealed anew with each occasion of utterance. During this part of the rite all other offerings of mind and mat-ter should be interred within the vessel or placed around it upon the cloth. Being thus centred amidst the grand array of offerings and requisites the vessel is symbolically enthroned amongst the relics of the dead. It is exalted as the divine image of the first-born sorcerer, raised atop the mountain of a million skulls: the bone-mound of all existence. As the spell is fulfilled the hands of the sorcerer should be placed upon the urn in a gesture of unity. The entirety of one's being should be cast therein to the Dragon's heart, returned unto the forge of all making and taking: the point of initiation into the Magical Quintessence. All spirits 1~~"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle should likewise be adjured to lay their hands upon the vessel and thereupon to swear fealty, to protect and to hone the Teachings of the Path. As the soul is cast down, so in the fleeting blink of an eye, it returns anew. The sacramental essence of empowerment, the invisible tincture of the poison place, is poured forth from the vessel and placed upon the sorcerer's tongue. The ophidian daimon rears upward from its lair and strikes at the heart of its summoner. This is the eucharist of death to all mortal flesh, the communion of the life-beyond-life. By the transmuta-tion of the venom into nectar the Seeker shall attain or shall be cast from the Crooked Path. When the Charge has been worked in completion the summatory charm called 'The As-sumption of the First-born' may be used if deemed needful. Thereafter all manner of personal prayers and deeds may be utilised to direct and enhance the efficacy of the rite. Other spells and formulae of the Dragon-book may be used according to the season of the working. Elsewise let the Seeker follow the subtil directions of those spirits whom attend upon his word. The Consummation:-Before the Consummation is recited all magical implements should be removed from the cloth, leaving only the vessel and the array of offerings lying thereupon. Mantic formulae should be used during this part of the rite to ensure the continued focus of intent. \\Vhen ready to proceed a single knell should be sounded above the vessel as a sign of the rite's imminent ending. A final utterance of the Sorcerer's Cry should be used, breathed out upon the vessel, to bind and fixate all wayward shades and spirits to the locus of the path's design. As the Cry is declared in the voice of power, the seal of the vessel should be placed once more into its insatiable mouth. The cloth should then be drawn and folded about the body of the Dragon-vessel, even as a shroud about a corpse, leaving only the head, the vessel's neck and mouth, exposed for future access. When the cloth has been tied tightly, the customary adornments of the vessel may be remrned: the fetish-belt and talismanic vestments. A single lighted candle may then be placed atop the sealed vessel in remembrance of the Midwinter pyre. The charms of the rite's summa-tion and conclusion may then be spoken. Thereafter, when all is done, the subtil circle of the en-hallowed shrine should be withdrawn into the vessel. Finally, the candle should be extinguished and its light be seen as the final offering of the Black Moon's Feast. When the rite has been completed the Dragon-vessel and all other requisites are returned unto their customary positions within the shrine. As the scribe has shown the manner of his Kcomplishment by word, so may it bestow insight and good fortune upon all who attain unto its deeds. May the Blessing be upon all who partake in the Mystery of the Black Moon. Additional Comment IT MTST BE remembered that the above example of the Vessel Rite is only a single exemplar of Its working. Because of the rite's solitary nature it is known that it may be worked and adapted in an untold number of ways. Each practitioner should refine and develop its method of exac-tion as they progress upon the path. The tabu regarding the solitary nature of the Dark Moon working should be observed by all without compromise. This is a law of the Arte Magical which has arisen from the innate ethos of"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo6ia Draco'Tau6 autonomy, the unique code of self-government esteemed most highly amongst the Companions of the Way. An exception to this rule applies where a man and woman may work the rite together in the season of the woman's menstruation, that being the time of her own alignment unto the dark of the moon. This application of the rite is commended solely unto those well-travelled in these mysteries. Here ends the second part of the Commentary of the Three Ways and the Three Times. III: The Mystery of the Black Earth THE MYSTERY OF the Black Earth is the name given to the Rite of the Draconian Oracle when it is worked as 'The Ritual of the First Circle' within the Double-ouroboric rites of the sacred year. Upon the seven occasions of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua, being the rites numbered as the seven crowned heads of the Dragon, and upon the occasion of the unnumbered or hidden rite ofla, the Mysterium of the Draconian Oracle is used as the foundation-ceremony within the Plot of the Blood-acre. In this application the Oracle Rite is utilised to establish the basis of knowledge upon which the Gnosis of the Heptarchia - the Sevenfold Power of the Aeons -may be raised and revealed. The especial occasions of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua fall upon dates of the solar and seasonal cycle of the year. Each of these rites corresponds to a direction of the compass and is revered as a mystical extension or radix of power emanating from the timeless root of the circle's heart. As aforementioned, these rituals utilise the sacred area of the double-circle. Within the first circle the foundation or initial hot-point is laid down using the Oracle Rite and thereafter the sorcerer or covine is said to walk forth upon, through and beyond its gateway. The subtil journey of the soul through the portal of the circle's heart is ritually depicted by the crossing over from the first circle to the second circle - from the domain of the world-field to the domain of the Elder Gods. The act of bearing forth the Dragon-vessel and transgressing the liminal threshold of the two circles is considered to articulate the Arcanum of the Black Earth. For it is held that in the act of ritual trespass across the threshold one re-enters the sacred time of the black-golden interstice. The deed is therefore perceived to be at one with the central arcana of the Black Sun and the Black Moon. The Midwinter fire-sacrifice, the dark moon opening, and the transliminal passage of the vessel between the two circles are considered to be the three ways of one mystery: the Great Return to the Time-beyond-Time. By vertu of this secret, being the very Mystery of the Black Earth, the primal interstice - the moment in which the initiation of the Magical Quintessence is transmitted from the Elder Gods unto Man -is transposed from the heart of the Midwinter pyre to each of the solar and sea-sonal nodes of the compass. This alignment attenuates the instant of the primal transgression throughout the entirety of the year and marks the horizon of all temporality with the Wych-seal of blood: the sacrifice that is celebrated eight times 'pon the round of the year and the day. Ritual Procedure: In terms of working procedure the use of the Oracle Rite as the Ceremony of the First Circle is basically the same as for the Midwinter Rite, with the obvious omission of the vessel-sacrifice. All other parts of the rite, from the initial utterance to the Charge of the 19.4"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Rite of the Draconian Oracle Shadow, are worked in the same manner. That being said, the basic procedure of the rite at Mid-winter may be elaborated and adapted to the specific purposes and unique intents of each dou-ble-circle working. These ceremonies may be celebrated alone in shortened forms, but given their duration and structure it is deemed that they are best worked within the blessed synomosy of the Quadriga. When the inner force has been realised through practise, the outward forms should be transformed-refined and developed - to reflect the manner of their revelation. Examples of customary adaptations to the Oracle Rite upon the aforementioned occasions are thus:-Entering the Circle Upon all occasions the Quarter-guardian of the North is the first to perform the Witches' Step into the Blood Acre. At Midwinter the sign of his authority, the stang, is positioned in the North at the threshold-point prior to the rite's inception. At the times of the double-circle rites the Magister should carry the stang during his entrance to the circle and, once within, should turn and lay it lengthwise, just within the circle's edge. The other members of the covine will thus have to step across the stang to enter. This deed is used to signify the especial allegiance and fealty of the covine to the Northern Guardian throughout the course of the year. It is utilised upon the occasions of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua, for then the Stang-bearer is revered as the vicegerent of the Hidden Intercessor. It is not used at Midwinter, for such is the time of transition: the interregnum between the old and the new. Neither is this gesture used at the occasion of the Thu'ban Rite, for such is a Mystery of the Interstice, at one with the Arcanum of the Black Sun. Before entering the circle, it is customary that the Magister should use the stang to make a battery of three knocks upon the earth. When all have entered the circle and the silent circum-ambulations have been completed, the Magister should reclaim the sign of his authority and appoint it in the rightful place of the North . .\\(antic Formul~ .\\{antic formul~, or prayerful utterances, may be utilised throughout various stages during the performance of the Oracle Rite, most often during the triple exorcisms and the quarter saluta-tions. These formulae are composed of the 'I' root-phoneme and various divine names. They are repeated in the manner of a mantra in order to maintain the focus of intent and to further the empowerment of ritual activity. It is usual for each formula to include the appropriate phoneme of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ia, Ku, La, Tan or Hua, depending upon the time of working. For example, the manric formulae used during the Hu Rite are as follows:-Fire Exorcism= 1-HU-AGRATH Salt Exorcism= 1-HU-RAHAB Water Exorcism= 1-HU-NAAMAH Binding of the Three Exorcisms= 1-HU-LILIYA Eastern Salutation= 1-HU-ZHAMAEL Southern Salutation= 1-HU-AZAZHAEL Western Salutation= 1-HU-AZHAEL ::\\orthern Salutation= 1-HU-MAHAZHAEL Centre= 1-HU-DRAKU-TA'US"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Grimorium G2nomoeia Draco'TaU9 The divine names used during the exorcisms and quarter salutations are those of the Cardinal Witch-mothers and Witch-fathers respectively. These are revered as the fourfold embodiments of Witch blood's progenitors and are honoured as the parents of Qayin, the Turnskin and First-born Child of the Dragon's brood. These formulae are used as is deemed appropriate during the double-ouroboric rituals of the year. Their function is to sustain concentration during parts of the rite which may directly involve only one or two members of the covine at a time, also to support and empower the deeds of those involved in such parts of the rite. The Offering of the Eight Boughs Throughout the seven tides of the year, and most especially during the season of Ba, when the attendant spirits of the path are convened in the mortal masquerade of our worship, it is deemed appropriate to call forth the winds of the compass to attend and bless the ways of the covine. This is accomplished during the Chant of the Eight Trees. Customarily, as each bough is taken from the perimeter of the circle, its corresponding line from the Chant is spoken. When the spirits of the winds would be called forth and honoured, their names should be declared at the end of each line. As the bough is placed in the fire, let the name of its airt-warden be decreed. The seed-phonemes of the eight rays may also be used, thus to combine the Calling of the Eight Winds of Space with the basic form of Hallowing the Kingdom. Blackthorn for darkness and the veil of the night ...................... Boreas -I! Whitethorn for brightness and the blessing of sight ................... Argestes-Huf Rowan for blood and the secrets within ....................................... Eurus-Sa! Willow for wishes that in our hearts sing .................................... Volturnus -Ba! Yew for the Black One and the Souls of the Dead ...................... Notos -Ku! Hazel for cunning,for the spells we have said ............................ Africanus -La! Apple for the fruit and the harvest of Life .................................. Zephyrus -Tan! Ivy for binding; for Hand, Bough and Knife .............................. Corus -Hua! The above examples of adaptation are customary distinctions in the working procedure of the solar/seasonal form of the Oracle Rite as evolved within the originating enclave of this gri-moire. Further adaptations and refinements should be made to suit the specific directions and insights of those who practise these Mysteries. May the Blessing be upon all who walk within the Circle of the Black Earth. As it is written, so may it be! u,6 Here ends the third part of the commentary of the Three Ways and the Three Times.

THE PRINCIPAL APPLICATION OF THE CYPHER: The Teachings of the Octrigan Mystery IN THE TRADITIONAL observance of the Cunning Arte the basic form of the numerick cypher is used to count the first eight steps of ritual activity,-from Silent Circumambulation to The Charge to the Shadow. These eight steps combine to manifest the matrix of principles known as 'The Mystery of the Octriga' or 'Eightfold Rite'. In essence the eightfold rite is the unwritten conformation of magical lore, the fundamental corpus of wisdom, which is applied as a set of guiding tenets for structuring the divers permutations of ritual praxis and contemplative pro-cedure. It is thus that there are many recensions of the Octrigan Mystery, many examples of its application; all of which revolve upon the geometric foundation of the eight-rayed compass. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle is the principal eightfold rite of the Crooked Path and from its example the Seeker may attain insight into the subtil forces of the octrigan mystery which move through and beyond the outward expressions of its word and deed. Likewise, by vertu of such understanding, the Seeker may clothe anew the essence of this wisdom in the substance and form of his own unique vision,-and ever according to the knowledge such as dreams may reveal to each alone. It is customary for the teachings of the eightfold rite to be transmitted orally and by means of practical example. The most simple method of instruction is by the use of a knotted cord; as each principle is imparted a knot is tied. This creates a form of the Witches' Rosary: a mne-monic tool for the re-membrance of the body of wisdom. This method may be utilised by the aspirant to assist in the process of self-instruction. As previously indicated, the principles of the octrigan mystery are made manifest upon the eight-rayed wheel of the ritual compass: the eight airts of the Blood-acre. The first seven prin-ciples are applied through the preliminary requisites of deed to empower and prepare the ritual domain for the main conjuration. By the exaction of these preliminaries the magical on-lay of the point, path and thrice-cast circle is attained. The forms of incantation and methods of working used during the preliminaries should vary in accordance with the specific nature of the main enchantment: the Conjuration of the Spirit. The deed of the eighth step reveals the hyperborean path of shadow and there-upon its crooked way the many spirits and powers may be called forth. The Octrigan Mystery empowers the magical hot-point of intent and determines the liminal boundary of the point's extension to the ritual horizon of the single circle. The ninth principle is known as 'the step upon the point' and signifies the going-forth of the sorcerer upon the heart of the circle: the mystical centre of intent. The tenth principle is known as 'the path within the point' and signifies the journey of the soul upon the pathway through the circle's heart. The eleventh and final principle is known as 'the path beyond the point' and signifies the way of return: the realisation of the enchantment within the quintessence of the zeroth arcanum. In practices of the single circle the ninth, tenth and eleventh principles are actuated within the unique evolution of a ritual during and after its main conjuration. As the Summoner and 1~8"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"'Ihe Teach.ing6 of the Hendeca.rch the Summoned may go forth by countless routes to meet in the crossways of the circle, so the dual-path of their communion shall be cast forth in every untold manner of revelation. In terms of the Oracle Rite the ninth, tenth and eleventh principles lie concealed within the Charge to the Shadow and are revealed, each time anew, by the Coming-forth of the First-horn's Spirit into the Very Flesh of Man. In practices using the double-circle the journey through and beyond the mystical heart of the Blood-acre is reified through the journey across the threshold and in the pilgrimage to-and-from the Plot of the Never-setting Stars. When known through practise the many subtleties of these arcana may be seen to move through and throughout the labyrinth of all magick, o'erstepping the apparent limina of se-quence to merge and interweave in the sorcerer's web. Herein this grammary the elevenfold cypher is simply used to tell the rosary of the sorcerer, to count the Ways of his Arte. The keys of number are revealed to demonstrate principles of connectivity that weave throughout the entire body of magical knowledge. The application of these principles will beget a unique language for each practitioner. By means of personal ob-servance an understanding of the path will evolve. This will serve to communicate the secrets of the magical alphabet, the theophanic script, whose hidden letters perpetually pennutate and combine in infinite configurations to describe the steps of the pilgrimage - to spell out the lessons of initiatic cognizance and thereby cohere the unique vocabulary of the mage. Wisdom may here impart the enumeration of the path as trodden by many a compatriot of the way, but the words of its direct communication must be heard and told by each heart alone. Once understood, by means of practise and contemplative realisation, the subtil keys ofletter and number may be directly perceived as the matrix of power, the net of enchantment, formed by the vectors of magical force and upon which the outward form of all praxis is built. By this knowledge the secrets of sorcerous perception are structured, permutated and made manifest. By the dual cypher of communication and enumeration, the initiate may apprehend the arcane mete and measure of Wisdom's body,-the circumference, scale, harmony and ratio of magick's manifold gyre. By the interconnection of the twain in gnosis, the marriage ofletter and num-ber in the very Wisdom of their origination, the Seeker shall pass beyond their means to that Knowledge which has no common telling: the holocrypticon of I. In the blood of the true-born, the exchange of the glance across the fire and the leap of vision beyond; there the secret lies ...... And yet perchance the many ways of this knowing may converse amid all difference by the power of this very grammary; to speak as one in the flame's own voice-in the Draconick ~fother-tongue of Sorcery. THE THREE MODES OF INTERPRETATION In comprehending the eleven arcana there are distinct modes of interpretation which are utilised in order to accentuate the different ways in which the cypher may be perceived and applied:-The first or basic mode of interpretation is the View of Action, wherein the cypher is per-ceived in terms of the external deeds of physical ritual praxis. This is the Way of Flesh. The second or intermediate mode of interpretation is the View of Form, wherein the arcana of the cypher are perceived in terms of male and female deific embodiments,-as the form-bodies of magical power. This is the Way of the Lord and Lady."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Grimorium 0)!nomo6ia Draco'Tau.s The third or advanced mode of interpretation is the View of Force, wherein the arcana of the cypher are perceived in terms of the energetic conformation of intent, transcendent of the dual expressions of form. This is the Way of the Elder Gods. BASIC OR ACTION INTERPRETATION The eightfold rite may firstly be undertaken as a procedure of ritual deeds -as acts - which combine to establish the foundation for the initial realisation of the Crooked Path. When first practised, the Oracle Rite should be apprehended in terms of its outward gestures and mo-tions -as steps, stances and bodily en-trancement. The knowledge encrypted within the rite should be perceived via physical performance as the wisdom of action. INTERMEDIATE OR FORM INTERPRETATION In many recensions of the octrigan mystery certain stages of the rite are revered as aspects of male and female deity, and are conceived of as being under the tutelage and governance of such according to accustomed attributions: the Wisdom of Our Moon-horned Goddess is re-vealed through the Arcanum of the Triple Exorcisms; the Knowledge of Our Sun-crowned God through the Salutations to the Four Quarters. The distinguishing characteristic of the Form Interpretation is that the embodiments of magical power are expressed in terms of male-female polarity. The Form Interpretation of the Oracle Rite is indicated in the Commentary of the Three Ways and more fully within the Rite of the Nine Circles, wherein the mantic formulae of the \"Witch-mothers and Witch-fathers are given. The complete mandala of form-bodies is revealed within the Rite of the Dragon's Horns and the Grand Rite of the Agap<e. When the veil of outward deed has been passed and the knowledge of the rite would be re-vealed in Mind, then shall the Seeker call upon the divine retinue of Lili ya and Mahazhael. For by the working of these mysteries in devotion to the Hidden Lords and Ladies the wisdom and method of the Crooked Path shall come forth from the silence of the flesh as direct knowledge. In drinking from the Bloodied Graal of Our Lady and in eating the Bloodied Bread of Our Lord the gnosis of the Serpent shall come straightwise to the moving thought of the Seeker; e'en though no word be uttered as instruction, nor any written letter of grammary be read, the knowledge of the Wych'd Path shall be thine. ADVANCED OR FORCE INTERPRETATION The text of the Oracle Rite is an example of the Octrigan Mystery according to the interpreta-tion of Force and should primarily be viewed as such. By this it is understood that the various stages of the rite articulate the principles of the Octrigan Mystery purely as vectors of energetic transmission. The embodiments of this are revered as the formless forms of the Elder Gods and are imaged-forth through the sacred vehicula of the Dragon as the Quadrigan Circle of the \\Vatchers and, in apotheosis, by the carnal absolution of all within the Body of Qayin Azhaka: the primal incarnation of the Crooked Path in Man. In the Force Interpretation of the Oracle Rite the female and male personifications of the triple and quaternary crossroads are harmonised and transformed through the hermaphroditic forms of the Divine Quadriga. This is reifed during the Quarter Salutations by the offertory 130"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"'Ihe Teachings of the HendecaPch address to the Four Serpent-Watchers. The hidden nature of the Seeker is revealed through the Force Interpretation as the her-maphrodite or bi-une progeny of the Draconic Power. For each present practitioner, each True Seeker of the Crooked Path, is the primal incarnation of the Dracosarkia: the first flesh of Azh-deha. In the name and cypher of Qayin Azhaka, each unique child of the path is its primordial vehicle. Each is the shrine of the sevenfold edenic hyle, born forth from the shadow'd realm of endless night by the spirits of the Corpse-king and Queen, shaped by the many hands of their kindred and wrought in the Circle of Arte as the protean vessel for the Wych-fire of Eld. The comprehension of the Force Interpretation is attained when the outward veil of appear-ance is pierced, when the dual bodies of the Lord and Lady have offered up their empowerment as Knowledge to the Seeker's Mind. For then shall the Powers of the Elder Gods bespeak the Oracle as the Void made Flesh. Whosoever is wise shall attain through the Unity and the Separation of the Three Ways, by time and by interpretation. Let now the Triple Veil be rent by the Trident-blade of Our Intent! The Arcana of the Hendecarch THE PRINCIPLES OF the elevenfold cypher are given below. Their enumeration follows the 5ame sequence as that used throughout the Commentary of the Three Ways. THE ARCANUM OF THE VOID The zeroth number of Arte cannot be told. It is revealed in silence, in the realisation of apo-phasis: the Gnosis of Self-existant Ipseity attained by the Way of All-negation. Its deed is shad-owed-forth in flesh by the wordless pacing of the circle; its secret is whisper'd in the Arcanum of la-Dr'ka. I) THE ARCANUM OF THE POINT The first number of Arte defines the sole focus of magical force. It is the singularity wherein all converges to create the hot-point of sorcerous power. The spatial or chronological position of the point may be wheresoever the operant determines; for it is the sole vehicula of his ener-getic expression, infinite in mobility and omnipotent by intrinsic identity to the source of all existence. The point is ritually identified with the centre of the circle or sacred plot, as the place \"-here all roads may meet or part. In terms of actuative deed the point is initially established, <Jr opened, by the inceptory words and deeds of the working procedure. The making of the hot-point may be considered as the fundamental gesture of magick; for upon its foundation the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomo6ia Dra.co'Taus sorcerer's world may fall or rise. As a magical ceremony proceeds the point is empowered, or made manifest, in a unique and specific way. The specific forces drawn forth from within its locus and which build upon its foundation are determined by each and every gesture of Arte. The especial nature of a rite is thus determined by the divers paths which are called forth by intent to transect and marry within the subtil axis of the monad. The cognizance of this process permits the point to be per-ceived as the place of origin and termination for each and every vector of magical force, and as the nexus for every possible permutation of the numerick cypher. When realised as the centre for the perfected irradiance of the Hendecarch, the point is referred to as an 'aat', meaning a House or Cell of Absolute Magical Power. 2) THE ARCANUM OF THE PATH The second number of Arte delineates the cause-way of magical numen which emanates from the oracular gate of the inceptory point. As the focus of the rite is made, so, by means of en-chantment, its power is called forth and is given direction: the path of intent is made manifest. The route of consciousness beyond the eternal moment of the point is thus opened and its radix is cast forth through time, thereby creating the motion of be-coming: the going-forth of the sorcerer from now ... unto the ever-present. The second number is actuated by a formal pronouncement, known as 'The Statement of Intent', within which the dual nature of the pathway is revealed. The essential duality may be perceived as the Seeker and the Sought, the Summoner and the Summoned,-the Body of Qayin and the Dragon's Flesh. Within the gnosis of the Crooked Path the cause-way of attainment is realised as the double-edged blade, as the Sword of Knowledge which may both free and fet-ter - liberate or destroy. In the text of the Oracle Rite the second principle is expressed by 'The Declaration' and 'The Chant of the Tree'; the blade is thus turned fro~ horizon to horizon and from height unto depth, perpetually turning to guard the forbidden gates of Eden. The duality of the path is termed the Double-way. In terms of action, this signifies the ambiva-lence of the practitioner between good and evil, beauty and abomination, cruelty and compas-sion. For the Seeker should embrace both ascesis and libertinage by turns, to walk outside the boundaries of worldly law and exist in the self-chosen freedom of realised will. This ever-devi-ating path lies balanced between the seeming polarities of every opposition; its tortuous route traverses the borders of all manifest appearance and is unique to each soul that dares to claim it. The Double-way is depicted as the Column of Fire, the razor-bridge betwixt every Alpha and Omega. The nature of this two-edged path is embodied within the twin serpents of the lightning-bolt and the flaming torch. These respectively transmit the powers and teachings of the path by the twofold means of instantaneity and eternity: the swift route of intercession and the age-trodden course of timely succession. In terms of its greater interpretation, the Double-way is realised as the way of presence and absence, as the path that is and the path that is not. As the path evolves, it assimilates its differ-ence, and so the nature of its Other perpetually changes. By the understanding and application of this realisation the path can never be fettered or falsely constrained; for it is the very spirit of change and will either make or break the soul of its initiand. The blade will free all who dance in the self-creativity of these mysteries or else will turn to whet itself upon the mortal heart of man. 13~"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"'Ihe Teachinga of the Hendecarch Moving between the limits of every horizon, its motion guided by the direction of intent, the second principle of Our Arte delineates the principal vector of magical power as the twice-turning path. It stretches forth, no wider than a single hair, no greater than the space of a single intant, as the endless bridge across the abyss of all division. 3) THE ARCANUM OF THE TRIAD: The Hallowing of the Triangle and Triple Crossroads The third number of Arte delimits the first enclosure of magical power and therein focuses the cosmos, hallowing the central point as the meeting-place for the roads of past, present and future. No less than three straight lines are sufficent to demarcate an area of space. It is therefore that the third principle of the numerick cypher serves to delimit the initial area of ritual empower-ment. This is signified in the glyph of 'f', known as the Triangle for the Evocation of Spirits. In terms of ritual deed the third principle is reified by the working of the Triple Exorcisms and thereby functions to ensorcel or delimit the matrix of essence. By the exaction of the three exorcisms the ritual area is bounded by the on-lay of the first finitor; the hidden sign of the oiangle is transposed upon the earthen domain as the first compass of power. It is thus that the three exorcisms are held to cast the first form of the magical 'circle'. Although, in terms of ac-tion, they are performed about the round of the ritual compass, in essence their empowerment is the on-lay of the trimorphic sigil: the triangle, trident or T-cross. It is thus in certain praxes of Arte that the Triangle of Evocation, or some co-valent sign, \\\\ill be traced out upon the earth by water, salt and fire in order to bind and constrain a force or spirit. When exacted throughout the body of the entire ritual area the power of the exorcisms is used to impress the matrix of the triadic sign upon the subtil aire of the site and thereby to focus and intensify all forces that may be transmitted therein. In terms of the Form Interpretation the third principle is considered to reside beneath the auspices of the feminine power, who is revered in this grammary as the Divine Witchmother Liliya, the Queen of the Cemetery. She is to be venerated in love by all who seek her favour. To the companie of her children she is perceived as the Body of all Life. As the Progenitor of Witchblood's Flesh and Blood, she is worshipped as the Boneward: the Gatekeeper of the Noc-turnal Sabbat. In her three principal names and forms the Grand Witch-queen of Our Path is revered as Agrath, Rahab and Nahema. In these three guises she reflects the waning, full and waxing phas-es of the moon and the three times of Past, Present and Future. She is honoured as the Three-faced Guardian of the Cross-roads and as the Gatekeeper of the Place that lies beyond. For hers is the Place of the Dreaming Vision, the Garden of Endless Night. At her scarlet door the three ways of consciousness - the roads of waking, sleeping and worldly dreaming-are said to meet and marry. Her especial sign is the T-crossroads, a glyph traced in her honour upon all points of the compass during the Rite of Ba, and which should be used as an earth-sign whenever her powers are called upon in daily observance. Our Mother Liliya is the Wisdom of the Crooked Path reifying the power of the Dragon as the Sacred Body of Woman: the Mother of Qayin and the Bride of the Serpent. Her hidden image is unveiled in the season of the Black Moon and there, in that very point of darkness, the inundation of her womb destroys and begets the world anew. Emanating from and returning ro this interstice of time the thrice-nine digits, the other twenty-seven nodes of the lunar cycle, mark out the circle of manifestation for the subtle permutations of threefold essence. The Form Interpretation of the third principle is therefore used to call forth and transmit the lunar mys-133"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"qrimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Taus teries of the Dragon-road. In terms of the Force Interpretation the third principle is realised beyond all forms of Lord or Lady. The three vectors of magical power which are manifested by means of the triple exorcistic act are perceived without dual personification, but are warded by the three spirit-guardians of Phoenix, Behemoth and Leviathan. In the View of Force the exorcisms are correlated to divers modes of triality revolving upon the symbol of the trident. Throughout the course of the grimoire the three blades of this symbol are revealed by the follov.ring trinities:-Will, Desire and Belief; Knowledge, Intent and Action; Flesh, Blood and Spirit; Body, Speech and Mind; Past, Present and Future; Mercury, Salt and Sulphur; the water of sexual fluids, the ashes of their substance and the fire of their essence. In summation, the function of the third principle is to delimit the first area of empowerment and to manipulate the threefold matrix ofits subtle energies via the divers modes of ritual, deific and conceptual encryption. 4) THE FOURTH ARCANUM: The Hallowing of Foursquare Plot and Fourfold Cross The fourth number of Arte depicts the translation of force into form, the motion of the path through the process of all-becoming into the stasis of all-being. It is symbolically apprehended by the extension of the single point of spirit into the fourfold cross of matter: the sign of the four physical elements --:-. In terms of action, the fourth principle is actuated by the Salutation to the Four Quarters: the cardinal directions of the compass. This serves to empower the ritual domain with the four elements and to accomplish the on-lay of the four-armed cross and the foursquare plot -+. In the usual manner of ritual observance, the ways of the cross and the four angles of the plot are dedicated in the Names of the Sun-crowned Lord and to the four times of the day. In this grammary the Lord of the Blood-acre is called forth in the fourfold flesh of the Witch-king. In the East he is revered as Zhamael, in the South as Azhazael, in the West as Azhael and in the North as Mahazhael. As is our custom, the Lord is afforded all honour as the Father of Qayin and is perceived in all verity as the God of Death. For his is the Sign of the Cross-marked Skull and the Power of Witcherie drawn forth into the present moment from beyond the door of the tomb. The fullness of this mystery is revealed in the Rite of Ba. In terms of the greater interpretation and in accord with the text of the Oracle Rite, the fourth principle is realised as the Body of the Quadriga, as the Divine Tetrad of the Serpent Watchers. Within the formless forms of the Quadriga the powers of the four witch-mothers and the four witch-fathers are unified and transcended. With each working of the Oracle Rite the Sovereign Spirits of the Four Watchers are called forth to empower the cardinal airts and, in covine observance, to incarnate within the four brethren of the circle. The flesh of the initi-ated body is therefore realised as the sole progeny born from the love-feast of the Sabbat; as the prodigal child of exile, begotten of the fourfold marriage of the witch-mothers and fathers. The perfection of this mystery is attained in the Rite of Tan. 134"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Teachings of the Hendecarch 5) THE FIFTH ARCANUM: The Making of the Pentalpha The fifth number of Arte communicates the principle of sorcery whereby the five senses -the touch, smell, hearing, taste and sight of the initiate - are aligned unto the focal empow-erment of the magical hot-point. By this arcanum the tactile, olfactory, aural, gustatory and visual modes of perception are cohered and modified to apprehend the subtil nature of magical realities,-to perceive the Dream of the Sabbat with the waking eye, to behold the world with the senses of the gods and spirits. The fifth number may therefore be regarded as the means by which perception is guided through the en-trance of the point and transformed to lucidly ap-prehend the open way of the path's direction. The symbol of the fifth number is the Pentagram, herein called 'The Pentalphic Star'. In deed, the fifth number is actuated by every method of sensory engagement which may cause the body to move at will within the spectrum of perceptual freedom and to directly enter the intended sphere of magical reality. Every mode of aesthesis and ascesis, every manner of honing and liberating the flesh is herein gathered under the auspices of the fivefold star. The remembrance of these many ways should be focused and used to empower the ritual gesture of 'Casting the Upright and the Averse Pentalpha'. This is made by the raising and outstretching of both hands, so that each makes the sign of a five-rayed star. It may be used to signify honour and veneration to spirit, power or direction, and is applied to effect the saluta-tions at the four directions of the circle. The secrets of this twofold gesture have been disclosed \\\\ithin the earler sections of this commentary. In the intermediate interpretation of these mysteries the dual signs of the pentalpha are per-ceived to align the sensory body of the initiate to the form-bodies of the Lord and the Lady. In the greater interpretation the dual pentalphic signs are perceived as the sinistral and dex-rral signaculce of the Watchers. The union of the twain emanations within a single point of empowerment signifies the transcarnation of the Watcher and the Body of Manifestation: the transmission of wisdom from the Quaternion Body of the Initiator to the Flesh of the lnitiand. For as the double-sign of the Pentalpha is projected from Man, so shall it be returned unto Him from the Hidden Circle of the Watchers,-in the gnosis of the point where the twain are one. The on-lay of the second finitor, the second casting of the circle, is attained by the unitive gestures of the fourth and fifth principles: the empowerment of the Four Ways by the Ascend-ing and Descending Stars. 6) THE SIXTH ARCANUM: The Salutation to the Column between Zenith and Nadir The sixth number of Arte reveals the route of consciousness beyond the limits of the five senses and the attainment of the power known as 'the Blessed Sight': the clairsentience of the initiated body. This signifies the union of the five senses and their transcendence within the body realised as the vehicle of pure consciousness. This may be called the opening of the subtil eye within the palm of the hand and may be symbolised by the gleaming centre of the five-rayed star. The ritual deed actuating this attainment is the Salutation of the Upright Pillar at the circle's heart. The outward perception of the five sensory paths is thereby in-turned and unified upon the hot-point of the mystery. The body of perception offers itself within the exaltation of the 135"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomo6ia Dra.co'Taus blazing hearth and therein casts off the fetters of mortality to move at liberty upon the vertical road between heaven and hell. This deed opens the upright path of the spirit-procession: the ladder of ascent and descent. In the Interpretation of Form the Salutation to the Axis of the World is depicted as the Way of Intercession between the Lord and the Lady: the thoroughfare between the Body of the Stars above and the Body of the Stars below. In the Interpretation of Force, the sixth principle is perceived in the Body of the Fifth Watch-er: the Hidden One who oversees the Four Ways and the Four Ways between. The Oracle Rite unites all three views in its manner of central address. The pillar of flame is saluted as the temenos for the alchymic transformation of the flesh into the vehicle of the Magi-cal Quintessence; it is honoured as the place of covine for the Lords and Ladies of the Noble Bloodlines, and is adored as the Divine Body of the Intercessor: the Peacock-feathered Serpent of Eld. It must be noted that the Oracle Rite, in distinction to many other recensions of the eight-fold mysterium, augments the sixth stage of the procedure with an additional act of offering: the Chant of the Eight Trees. This is used to further the empowerment of the central axis by symbolically offering tokens from the thicket-wall, the hedge that lies about the world-field's border, inward to the hearth; thereby to nourish the flames of the numinous forge. The banquet of the fire upon the tokens of the world's edge may be likened unto the Grand Feast of the Senses, wherein the entirety of the initiatic body is drawn through the contexture of ritual stimuli and is devoured within the flames of entheal joy. For as the fire shall feast upon the body of the world, so shall the spirit feast upon the body of perception. The spectra of hue in every nuance, the delights of the palate in both poison and nectar, the harmonies of musick and voice, the perfumes of the earth in every season, the contours of gesture, dance and touch, - all are partaken of in both pleasure and aversity, as the communion of flesh within all ecstasis. The body is led about the periphery of its sensory horizon and is offered to the pyre of the soul. The five ways of perception are married in the paradaisal bliss of the spirit: the eye is opened within the palm of the hand. In honour of this arcanum, it is considered meet and right for the com-panie of the circle to partake of some token repast of bread and wine, even in the semblance of mortal flesh and mortal blood. 7) THE SEVENTH ARCANUM: The Way of Seven Stars The seventh number of Arte signifies the perfection of the finitor and is expressed as the word and deed of the Circle-rune: the chant and dance of the witches' compass. In this act the flesh of Man is offered as the steed of the gods by the placing of their common step within the earthen maze of the Great Serpent's coils. As the charm is sung the body of man turns itself through the wheel of existence, rotating upon each node of the eight airts, casting itself into the vortices of gyre-carl and carline, the King and Queen of the Round Arte. As the body of flesh moves in the patterns of those whom minister upon the Dragon-road, the blessed retinue of Lords and Ladies, it is overshadowed and indwelt. By this arcanum the gods are said to walk forth upon the earth. The formal deed of 'Casting the Circle' is enumerated as the seventh principle of the octrigan mystery because it is said to hallow the land with the light of the Heptanomis, to draw down and make manifest the rainbow-hued empowerment of the seven-rayed star. The deeds of the triple exorcisms serve to cast the first form of the circle and to place the on-lay of the three-rayed cross-roads. The deeds of the Quarter-salutations serve to cast the second form of the circle and 136"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Teaching~ of the Hendecarch to place the on-lay of the four-rayed cross-roads. The deeds of the Circle-chant unite the twain and serve to cast the third and final form of the circle. The glyphs of the Lady and the Lord, the T-cross and the X-cross, are mystically combined to form the sign of the sevenfold star. The union of these signs depicts the arcane marriage of Liliya and Mahazhael. The form-body of the circle may therefore be visualised as the round dance of the witch-mothers and fathers, male and female in alternation, conjoined in the revel of the sacred love-feast. In terms of its greater interpretation the Circle-chant serves to orate the mystery of the ze-roth circumambulation, to re-member the deed of silence and to give it voice according to the nature of the ritual being worked. It is thus that there are many recensions of the Circle-chant which may be utilised according to purpose and occasion. Within this present Grammary of Arte, the Dragon's Rune is esteemed as the principal form. It is regarded as a theophanic text of the Crooked Path and is used within all major rites throughout the year to presage the raising of the Dragon's seven heads. 8) THE EIGHTH ARCANUM: The Way of the Shadow The eighth number of Arte reveals the umbrose route beyond the star of seven rays and there-upon its subtil ley the mage may call forth the powers and spirits through the hot-point of original intent and into the circle of manifestation. In customary procedures of working the eighth stage of the octrigan rite is known as 'The Main Conjuration' and forms the principal part of the ceremony. In mystical terms the eighth stage is the Way of the Shadow. It is the enchantment which opens the centre of the circle and permits the summoning of the gods, spirits and powers through the warded portal of the hearth. It is taught that the eighth stage marks the hidden route from the visible centre of power, the hearthstead, to the unseen source which lies beyond the Northern Gate. Within the Oracle Rite the eighth stage is called 'The Charge to the Shadow'. Its purpose is to open the way for the Path of Great Return; for the procession of the Mighty Dead: the ancestral lineage of all witchblood. The Master of the blood-covenant is Qayin, who is revered as the Soul of the First-born Initiate. He is called forth to rally the forms and forces of the spirit-procession and to bestow the primordial empowerment, the initiation of the Magical Quintessence, upon the body of manifestation. For as the Lord of all Horsemen he rides the body of his chosen steed: man and woman alike become the living substance of his mystery. Though oft' revered in ritual texts as the body of man, as the Great Lord of the Mysteries, Qayin is perceived as the primal offspring of the Dragon, uniting the powers of both Lili ya and Mahazhael within the first-formed flesh: the hermaphroditic child of the Elder Gods. Where revered as solely masculine in form the name of the child is herein rendered as Cain; elsewise the divine child - the eidola of the Seeker -is considered to be that which unites and transcends the duality of the male and the female, the Lord and the Lady. Where revered as solely female in nature the child is named Calmena or Azhrun; these being mythical names of Cain's sister and bride. With the fulfilment of the eighth stage of the octrigan ceremony the body of the circle is regarded as symbolically complete. The pattern of the compass-rose has unfolded from the hot-point of pure intent and the on-lay of the eight-rayed cross has been sealed into the subtil aire of the sorcerous domain. Upon the glyphic basis of the eightfold sign the many ways of time, space and power as understood within the Teachings of the Cunning Arte are cohered and mapped out to form the Wheel of Perfected Knowledge. It is thus that in treading the border of the circle one circumscribes the body entire. (see Tables of Correspondence, Ninth Principle 137"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo~ia Oraco'Taus and Appendices). In rites of the single circle the procedure of working leading onward - within and beyond the eighth stage - involves the transmission of knowledge between the Summoner and the Sum-moned. The nature of this mystick communion may not be divulged to any outside the circle of initiation, save at the especial command of the spirit. It is thus that the ninth, tenth and eleventh aspects are known as the concealed steps of the path. When all is accomplished to the pleasure of the seen and unseen, practices of binding and stabilisation are employed to complete the alignment and cohesion of all magical powers. Fi-nally, by means of consummatory charms and circumambulatory ensorcellement, the rite is re-turned to its still centre. The last deed of all is the leap over the hearth; this seals the rite with the tridentate-sign of the concealed step. In rites of the double-ouroboros the secret of the leap is told in the continuation of the path across the threshold. The procedure of such rituals delineates the hidden arcana of the Hendec-arch upon the sigaldric path of the twofold circle and thus makes visible the unseen teachings: the wisdom of the mystical pilgrimage through the Blood-acre's heart. Here follow the Teachings of the Concealed Arcana. To these the Seeker should turn and turn again as dictated by the insight borne of practise. 9) THE NINTH ARCANUM: The Path upon the Point The ninth number of Arte reveals the arcanum known as 'the Path upon the Point'. This signi-fies the movement of consciousness from the perceptual realm of telluric awareness into the very domain of the spirit or power summoned by a rite; it is the stepping of the initiate directly onto the fully empowered hot-point at the centre of the magical compass. Thereupon, the eye of the seer is infused with the rais'd power and is drawn to the en-trance of its ambient mystique. The hand of the spirit leads the mind to join in the appearance of reification: the living dream of the mysterium. By this arcanum, Man and Spirit walk together at the crossways of their dual-existence. The ritual deed by which the ninth principle may be symbolically apprehended is the act of the spinning leap over the fire. This marks the passing-over of the flesh upon the bridge of flame, the transient stepping of the soul upon the mystical point that illumines the central hearth of the Blood-acre. The physical act of the leap may be seen to depict many aspects of magical wisdom and may be interpreted by both the sun and the moon, by the left hand of the Lord and the right hand of the Lady, even by the twain gestures of the Hidden Watcher's power. To attain these interpretations the Circle of Presence must be considered as the geometer of time according to the reckoning of Helios and Luna; and, with regard to mysteries of the Double-ouroboros, the crossing-over into the Circle of Absence must be considered as the leap beyond the count of the year and the day. In terms oflunar arcana, the first circle is perceived to measure the cycle of the lunar month. The Northern Gate is the point marking the Dark of the Moon and about the circle's perimeter the twenty-seven digits of the lunary cycle are laid out in equal divide, with the Full Moon fall-ing upon the place of the Southern Quarter to mark the mid-point between the waxing and the waning phases. The hearth of the circle is perceived as the body of the moon itself, as the point 138"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"'Ihe Teachings of the Hendecarch from whence the twenty-eight rays emanate to the temporal horizon of the compass. The act of jumping over the fire is therefore considered to be the very leap over the moon: the step outside of the twenty-eight rayed circle and into the timeless domain beyond. In the symbology of the Double-ouroboros the leap over the moon marks the traverse of the Northern Threshold and thus the passing of the Seeker through the portal of the Dark Moon. This symbolic apprenhension of the arcanum is reified in the course of our practise at each dark lunar working of the Oracle Rite. Through the opening of the Dragon-vessel at these temporal junctures one reveals the gateway that leads beyond the twenty-eight rays of time and opens into the black-golden interstice: the Void of the Lightless Light behind the veil of the Black Moon. The ninth principle may also be interpreted, by vertu of its thrice-triple nature, according to the mysteries of the Three Exorcisms. To further expound it is needful to conceive of the lunar cycle as being focused upon the node of the Dark Moon. One must consider that the twenty-seven (thrice-nine) digits of the lunar month are centred upon the twenty-eighth or last digit: the point of the Black Moon. Upon each singular digit, each night of the twenty-seven rayed circle, the lunar sphere emanates a threefold essence. These essences are the mystical constitu-ents of the three exorcisms and form the matrix of the initiatic body. The water is the blood, the salt is the flesh and the fire is the spirit. The One beyond the thrice-nine circle of the lunar rime-essences is the Magical Quintessence: the realised soul of the adept. In the symbolic language of the Double-ouroboros the threshold between the two circles marks the liminal interstice dividing the temporal circle of the lunar digits and the a-temporal circle of the Hidden Draconick Power. In the vocabulary of the Form Interpretation this may be perceived as the Black Image of Liliya standing in the Northern Portal, her ligluless splendour reyealing the pathway of transcendence beyond the circle of life. For within Our Arte She is adored as the Corpse-queen, the Sovereign o'er all the companie of the triple-natured witch-mothers. May the Blessing be upon Our Lady of the Opened Grave for her revelation of this arcanum. In the Greater Interpretation the leap over fire and threshold may be known in three ways. \\\\'ichin the mystery of water, it is the ford that must be breached: the river of ancestral blood. Within the mystery of salt, it is the ashen charnel-ground: the empty grave that must be leapt. Within the mystery of fire, it is the funeral-pyre; the burning cremation-mound that must be traversed in a single bound. By the crossing of the three ways the Seeker shall be thrice purified before the Image of his own death. Whosoever would cross this triple bridge must overcome its ordeals and ride fonh upon its guardians: the Leviathan of the Primal \\Vaters, the Behemoth of the Unploughed Land. and the Phoenix within the Flame that consumes all Worlds. May the Blessing be upon che Sacred Bodies of the Thrice-triple Arcanum. 139"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"qrimorium G~nomosia Draco'Taus BY THE RECKONING of Helios, by season and by sun, the ninth principle is realised as the One beyond the eight stations of the sacred year. As may be known, the great rites of the Draconian Wheel of Time are attributed unto the eight directions of the compass and to eight occasions within the cycle of the solar and seasonal year.

Seventh Tide The Rite of the HUA Returning Dead Zenith 71hJune Hidden Tide Thu'ban Rite IA By this understanding the hearth of the Blood-acre is seen as the very body of the sun. To jump across its fire with the ritual gesture of the spinning leap is to step beyond the solar sphere and eclipse the world. The enchantment of this deed is first cast during the Midwinter working of the Oracle Rite, upon the occasion rightly known as 'The Mystery of the Black Sun'. The leap over the fire at this Mystery's conclusion traverses the point wherein the aged body of the Sa-cred Vessel is slain and from whence it arises newborn. The deed of this primal leap hallows the Circle of Presence as the mystical point of the enshadowed earth and prepares the way for the seven rites of the double-ouroboros. Within each of these great rites the primal leap is reified in the deed of bearing the Dragon-vessel across the threshold, to-and-from the Circle of Presence and the Circle of Absence. For in passing through the Northern Gate of the Blood-acre one's step is returned unto the point of the Black Sun. By the correspondence of ritual and time, the empowerment of Midwinter resides within the Northern Portal: the Antient Place of Power. To traverse the threshold of the Double-circle is to re-enter the foundation-point of the black-golden interstice and thereby return to the timeless origin of the Crooked Path. In passing through the Place of Power one's step is placed outside of the solar year to eclipse its measure of time. The traverse of the bridge betwixt the dual realms is exacted by the gesture of the Witches' 140"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Teachings of the Hendecarch Step, used in the manner of a withershins-turning spin - a backward pace across the limina of the circle. Midway through the deed, one's face is momentarily turned hindward to behold the circle of the world in shadow: the Compass of the Black Earth. This bestows the epithet of the Oracle Rite when used as the foundation ceremony of the double-ouroboric rituals. For it is upon those occasions, the times of the seven tides, that the initiate passes across the threshold to reify the journey of the soul through the burning hearth, beyond the circle of the sun, and into the Domain of the Never-setting Stars. The significance of this symbolism is most espe-cially realised upon the occasion of the Thu'ban Rite, the double-ouroboric ceremony of the Unnumbered or Hidden Tide, wherein the stellar mysteries of the Dragon are made manifest. Upon all occasions when the return has been made from the Circle of Absence to the Circle of Presence, the leap across the fire should be used to seal and bind all raised power. The dual act of crossing the threshold and leaping the fire, exacted upon each of the seven numbered tides, establishes the count of the stellar arcana within the Zeroth Mysterium ofla. Within the conclave of this rite the sidereal gnosis beyond the eight tides of the year is concealed. In summation, the ninth principle reveals the motion of awareness onto the hot-point of trans-formation augmented by ritual praxis. Within the especial rites of the Draconian Gnosis this is outwardly depicted by the twofold gesture of the Backward Leap and the Witches' Step. In the View of Form the ninth principle is revealed in the Body of the Hidden Watcher ap-pearing in the twin vehicula of Qayin:-as the Image of Lili ya raised above the Blood-acre's heart in a body oflight, dancing upon the tip of a black-flamed blade; and as the Image ofMahazhael reflected below in a body of shadow, dancing upon the tip of a rainbow-hued blade. Upon all sides this vision is guarded by the Phoenix, Behemoth and Leviathan. In the View of Force the ninth principle is made known by the dual-existent stasis of the Ini-tiate and the Hidden Initiator within the Stellar Body of the Dragon. The motion of sentience toward the point of realisation is perceived as the dual-pathway of the sorcerer and the spirit of Qayin toward the meeting-place above the mystick centre of the circle. In this understanding the ninth principle is seen as the ascendant arc of the leap: the journey of the soul toward the place of union: the fleeting moment of equipoise above the ever-turning blade of flame. IO) THE TENTH ARCANUM:-The Path within the Point The tenth number of Arte reveals the arcanum known as 'the Path within the Point'. In terms of the Force Interpretation, this signifies the indwelling of all within the very centre of the en-hallowed sphere: the all-mobility of consciousness within the unmoving point of omnipresent ipseity. Herein this arcanum all dual expressions of awareness shall be resolved. It is thus that the View of Form is here made manifest by means of its self-dissolution. The dual form-body of the Hidden Watcher, as Liliya above and Mahazhael below, should be drawn into the clear light of the point - resorbed into the fiery centre of Being. Therein the Spirit of Qayin should be realised as the Body of the Sorcerer. The View of Action reifies the tenth principle in terms of actuative sorcerous praxis. Hereby the tenth principle signifies the mutual in-dwelling of Man and Spirit in the subtil aethyr and substance of matter as cohered by the marriage of their dual-existence within a single vehicle of perception. This may be manifest in the flesh as the state of complete possession-trance; or may be realised as the motion of the seer's eye beyond the appearance of manifestation and directly"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomosia Draco'Taus entering within the native domain of the spirit. The tenth principle reifies Spirit in Flesh and rarefies Flesh in Spirit. Both as One are resolved in the Mystery oflncarnation: the Going-forth of Man amid the Elder Gods and the Coming-forth of the Elder Gods amid Man. Herein this grimoire the unified vehicle of transmission is the Body of the Dragon. Such is the ordained vessel of our perfect convocation. In language pertaining to the praxes of the double-circle the tenth principle may be per-ceived as the sacrificial dissolution of the mortal flesh within the hearth of the Blood-acre and the alchymic rebirth of the Seeker in the immortal body of the Dragon at the mid-point of the Stellar Compass. The second circle should be perceived as the macrocosm of the first circle's centre. By this understanding, all activity in the second circle may be considered to reify the subtil manipulations of magical power inside the hot-point of the Blood-acre's heart. It is thus that all magical work within the Plot of the Never-setting Stars is said to reside beneath the auspices of the tenth principle,-to make manifest the Path within the Point. In accord with this interpretation the tenth principle may be identified with the mid-point of the primal leap over the fire, and thus the en-trance of consciousness through the Gate of the Black Sun into the domains of future reification. In the traverse of the Midwinter fire the sorcerer stands poised within the axial moment of transformation. He becomes the dancer upon the turning blade of flame, exalted above the ashes of his own sacrifice and bearing forth the image of his own resurrection. The instant of the leap's apotheosis may be seen as the direct route into the circle's heart and, by symbolic connection, as the swift flight of the soul over the threshold-the Midnight Gate - to the centre of the second circle: the point of rebirth. This symbolic articulation is firstly to be reified through the Rite of Hu and is subsequently refined through all of the Double-circle Rites. The contemplative realisation of 'the Path within the Point' may be attained by the practise of 'Hallowing the Kingdom of Qayin'. For therein the mind resides at the meeting-place of the eight ways of the horizon and the two ways of ascent and descent, even between the ten direc-tions of space and the three ways of time. II) THE ELEVENTH ARCANUM:-The Path beyond the Point The eleventh number of Arte reveals the arcanum known as 'the Path beyond the Point'. At the moment of death it is the secret path ofliberty held sacred to the Kindred of the Antient Serpent. In the deeds of life it signifies the way of return, the earthward step from the celestial heights, the backward traverse of the wych'd step into the world of man. The eleventh principle is at one with the silent treading of the infinite path and is manifest in the Living Flesh of the Draconist. Let this mystery be contemplated by the motion of the mind upon the edge of the Holy Arthana. THE SWORD-EDGE WHICH REFLECTS THE WHOLE FACE. The outward expressions or actuative gestures of the Hendecarch are the conformation of ag-gregrates, the psycho-physical determinants of phenomenal reality.

And yet the blade must turn against itself, must sever any attachment of the Seeker to the means of attainment. The Sword of Knowledge shall rend the veils of its own eidola.

In form, it is constituted of a single main enchantment and a corpus of fourteen spells. In function, its sacred formul~ reveal the fourteen gates of power within the Arcane Body of the Great Dragon Azhdeha. Through the practise of the Transvocation the fourteen gateways of space are opened and the empowerment of the Antient One is borne forth into the sorcerer's flesh, making him the sacred vessel there-of-even as the Living Body of Gnosis. The Transvocatory formul~ are esteemed as the primary mode of magical praxis where-by the Formless Form of the Dragon may be attained. Its fourteen gateways are the irradiant stars \"\\\\ithin the Ophidic Body of the Magical Quintessence: the mediating power-zones of its trans-mission through the continua of the initiatory current. The sorcerer, in assuming the god-form of the Dragon, utilises these foci as the centres of energetic transference between all levels of existence. The subtil centres operate as the focal points of transmission for all magical force and are positioned within and beyond the physical vehicle of the sorcerer in accordance with principles of correspondence and intent. The fourteen zones are referred to in ritual language as 'dragon-points' and are conceived of as ineffable vortices of power, as stars shining simultane-ously within the finite physical body and the infinite body of the celestial void. Each of the fourteen points is a microcosmic facet of the Perfected Dragon-body and is attrib-uted to an anatomical division thereof, ranging from the Tongue to the Tail. Each point func-tions as a nexus for corresponding energies and states of being, as a cross-roads for the powers and entities of the cosmos. The correspondences of each point are therefore divers and may be expressed variously-as spatial, chronological, sidereal, solar, lunar, deific, cognitive, emotive, celluric, ancestral, elemental and chthonic aspects of existence. These correspondences are re-wa.led uniquely unto all through the practices of the Crooked Path. Here, in this Grammary, such knowledge is presented in the manner of an exemplar, reified by the direct experience of those whom have walked the Path through many a year and a day. The dual aspects of all action, form, and force are co-ordinated and transmuted through the ~ing matrix of the Stellar T ransvocation and are wrought anew in the Draconine Body: the Sacred Vehiculum of Azhdeha. The Holy Spirit of the Serpent-god pervades and lies hidden within all that is. Its many heads betoken the perception of all possible worlds.

The fourteen points in total function interconnectively as the Sorcerous Design of Existence; for the Dragon-body is perceived as the anronornian eidolon of perceptual totality. It is the battle-ground and the marriage-bed for the i.ntinite configurations of the Self and all Otherness: I, the Absolute, reified in the unified form of perpetual freedom. The perfect alignment of the Sorcerer and the Draconian vehicle obtains the means to complete identification with and the transcendence of all Nature.

Naught beyond the Silence within the Secret Word of Passing may reveal it. Naught beyond the ear-whispered teachings uttered through the sacred language of initiation may tell of it. Naught beyond the Deeds of Arte, the gestures that mirror the Dream of the High Sabbat, may attain unto its flesh. For the Dragon is the mask of the Void, the Eternal Oracle of the Elder Gods, revealed solely to those whom attain existence within the Circle of the Blessed and the Wise. It is the impress made in all worlds by That-which-is-not, the Idol wrought by Those whom dwell in the Negative Abode. Therefore is the Image of Azhdeha revealed to the Eyeless Eye - to the Realiser of the Arcanum Incarnate: the Primordial Power of Magi ck made Flesh. THE DRACONIAN SYNASTRY In the Lore of Our Arte it is known that certain stellar patternings are of especial magical vertu and correspond directly with nodes of power within the subtil and physical bodies of Man. The stars shining within the infinite void of the heavens cast forth their light upon the Earth from within the void of the sorcerer's flesh. It is thus that the fourteen gates of the Transvocation open in all domains, above, within and below the circle of the telluric realm. The centres of the Dragon-body are of one power, fourteenfold in expression and infinite in the hypostases of their manifestation. Within the praxis of the Stellar Transvocation the causation of identity between the stars of the celestial sphere and their physical analogues is the basis of intent. For it is from the sidereal radiances of the Dragon that the oracular gnosis of the Crooked Path is directly revealed and imbibed. The primary sidereal analogue of the fourteen transvocatory foci is the constellation Draco, the Antient Serpent, whose coils encircle the Never-setting Stars of the North. The visible stars of Draco are correlated to the fourteen body-parts of the Dragon and serve as the celestial cen-tres of veneration. This correspondence forms the practical foundation of the transvocatory formulae. If this constellation cannot be seen from the land of the Seeker's abode, a represen-tative talisman or stele displaying its form may be utilised; elsewise the aspirant is referred to the section of the Grimoire entitled 'The Circle ofBehenu', wherein the outer circle of sidereal gateways is made known. The process of identification benveen the fourteen points within the sorcerer's body and the fourteen outward stellar manifestations establishes the synastrian configuration of the Dra-conian vehicle. Through the imaginal extension of the physique through the faculties of the psyche, combined with the divers means of magical gesture and prayerful devotion, the four-teen points of star and flesh are aligned and realised as singularities of the sorcerous being: the body of the Dragon in heaven is married to the body of Man upon Earth. The practise of the Stellar Transvocation, being the very means of this attainment, has come to bear the title: 'The Pact of Blood and Starlight'. The stars of Draconis, the bodily zones of manifestation, and the initial times for the practise of their union are given below. 146"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"LUNAR PHASE Dark Moon New Moon Waxing Moon . . . . . . . . .

THE METHOD OF DAILY PRACTICE The Transvocatory Enchantment is used as the daily solitary practise of devotion and as the continual means for magical transformation. Gathering himself before Dragon-vessel, set at the heart of the domiciliary shrine and enthroned 'neath the arch of heaven, the Seeker should bow before the visible tokens of the Way.

The basic form of circle-casting known as 'Hallowing the Kingdom of Qayin' is advised as a simple and potent means of beginning and ending the session of practice. THE CYCLE OF PRACTICE The cycle of daily devotion should be observed according to the manner herein advised. The aspirant should commence the practice of the Stellar Transvocation at the first Dark Moon or Full Moon after the Midwinter consummation of the Hieros Gamos. There-after let him continue daily in its practise according to the Count of the Two Serpents. The procedure for a monthly cycle of daily working, beginning at the first Dark Moon, is as follows:-Beginning upon the night of the Lightless Moon, the fullness of the Sacred Form shall be assumed in the darkly bright radiance of the Heavens. At this time of the first Dark Moon, the first lunar Sabbat of the year shall be held. Alone and in secret, let the Rite of the Draconian Oracle be worked. Thereafter, as the means of binding and focusing the power raised through the Black Moon's encompass, let the Pact of Blood and Starlight be recited before the sealing of the Vessel. In the midst of that enchantment, let the mantic formulae of the fourteen stars be pronounced as the means of initial empowerment for the fourteenfold flesh of the Dragon upon the Earth. Upon the following night, the night of the New Moon, let the conjuration of the first lunar digit be pronounced: the Spell of the Tongue-star Al-Shujah. There-after, let him work one conjuration each night - going forth through the Body of the Dragon from Tongue to Tail until the night of the Full Moon. With the fullness of the Moon, let the fullness of the Dragon's skin be assumed. Then, after the time of the complete assumption, going forth from the Tail unto the Tongue until the night of the Old Moon, let him likewise work one conjuration each night. Thus shall the fourteen stars shine forth upon the earth through both the brightness and the darkness of the lunar sphere. There-by shall the elixirs, the poisons and nectars of the ophidian power, reify within and beyond the Vessel of Arte. Paying heed unto this counsel, let the Seeker adapt the manner of his working in accordance with the observable variations in the cycles of the Moon, ever watching for the ebb and flow of her tides. If begun at the first Full Moon of the year, the practice begins with the Spell of the Tail Star and continues thereafter according to the ordained cycle. The time of inception for this practice changes according to the variations in the lunar calendar and the proximity of the appropriate lunar node to the occasion of the Midwinter Rite. The aspirant is referred to the texts and tables charting exemplary patterns of the ritual year. THE CONTINUATION and Adaptation of the Practice The practice of the Stellar Transvocation is continued throughout the circle of the year and is punctuated by the solitary working of the Oracle Rite at each Dark Moon and by the solitary I covine working of the Great Sabbatic Rites upon the occasions of the seasonal mid-points and interstices. For the sake of procedural clarity it may be re-stated that throughout this yearly cycle the Dragon-vessel is opened only at the Dark Moons. Aside from the twelve or thirteen occasions of the Black Moon Rite, it is to be opened each day during the lunar month of the Hieros Ga-"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"ql'imol'ium G_l!nomosia Dl'aco'Taus mos and thereafter solely by the hands of the fire itself at the Midwinter-tide exaltation of the Infernal Sun. At all other times the Vessel is sealed and thus it exists as the hermetic centre of the World. In accord with the season and with the corresponding rituals there-of, the sorcerer should endeavour to utilise the main text of the Stellar Transvocation in conjunction with other ger-mane formulae of Arte. The stellar spells should therefore be integrated or transposed with corresponding formulae from the other series of fourteen spells, such as constitute the arcana of the Hu, Sa (Atavistic), La (Sexual) and Hua (Ancestral) Mysteries. One should also combine the practise of the Transvocation with other formulae of the Draconian Rites, such as those belonging to the Mysteries of the Horns, the Seven Stars, and the Peacock-angel, likewise with the formulae of the intermediary praxes. The corpus of the Transvocation and its fourteen stellar spells is utilised in entirety solely upon one occasion during the year, that being the day of the Thu'ban Rite. The recension of the fourteen stellar spells, as given herein, should not be regarded as a fixed body of ritual text. As one advances in comprehension of the fourteen points, one should utilise the stellar spells in conjunction with the corresponding contemplative formulae ofla (see Thu'ban Rite), eventually using both forms to establish the practical foundation of one's own unique recension of practice and enchantment. The procedural regularity of the Stellar Transvocation, created through alignment to the temporal cycles of the year and the day, obtains the rhythmic pattern of increase and decrease within the awareness of the practitioner. This is most immediately apparent through the align-ment with the digits of the lunar month. The unified cycle of practice is cognate to the growth, maturation and sloughing of the serpent's skin and thus to the process of transmutation glyphed there-by. Through the integration of awareness within this rhythmic juxtaposition of states the sorcerer is aligned unto the ebb and flow of the ophidian magical force, in time becoming at-tuned unto its subtil tides through the medianimity of the Draconian vehicle. Note Bene -During the last lunar month of a yearly cycle of working, that is, one complete lunar month prior to Midwinter, the practise of the Stellar Transvocation ceases or is integrated according to the predilection of the sorcerer; for it is then that the Rite of Marriage must be re-newed. Daily practise of the Transvocation creates an over-arching means of apprehending the many Mysteries of the Draconian Gnosis and establishes a continuity throughout the various other forms of magical discipline pertaining to the Crooked Path. Through the conjunction of the Stellar Pact with the other formulae of the Grimoire, the Dragon-body is reified from its stel-lar source and is made manifest through time in ever greater spectra of consciousness. The process of the serpent-power's uncoiling is systematically attenuated throughout the course of the Great Sabbatic Rites and is cohered by the application of the divers lections comprising the Teachings of the Path. By the focalisation of all magical power within the fourteen points, the Draconian Body constellates the web of the Sorcerous Design: the knowledge, intent and action of the Ever-turning Path. 150"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Ritual Text Proper of THE PACT OF BLOOD AND STARLIGHT and THE FOURTEEN STELLAR SPELLS"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Grimorium G2nomoeia Draco'Taue 15~ The Stellar Transvocation of Azhdeha being THE PACT OF BLOOD AND STARLIGHT O'Azhdeha!

It is intended that these preparatory statements will permit a congruent foundation for the comprehension of the fourteen points; primarily as they are revealed through the practice of the Stellar Transvoca-tion and, secondarily, as gradually apprehended through the diverse praxes constituting the complete Grammary of Arte. I THE TONGUE The Point of the Dragon's Tongue is attributed to the star ~ Draco and bears the name of Al Shujah. From this Point the Oracle of the Dragon is pronounced; this is the Double-word of Antiquity and Futurity: the bifurcate power of the serpent forth-spoken in the Silence between Truth and Lie. Al Shujah is the Fount of the Stars, the well-spring for the stellar elixirs of the Antient Ser-pent. From the divided tongue of the heavenly snake the light of the fourteen points shines forth within each fraction of time and is poured forth to illumine the flesh of Man. From the Arch of the Sky to the Graal of the Earth, from the tongue above to the tongue below, the twofold river of venom and nectar transmits the single elixir: the manifest power of the Draconian Quintes-sence. The living vitality of this Gnosis is the Witchblood, the Sworn Communion 'twixt the Elder Gods and the Initiated Body. Its vehicula of transmission, the Body of the Dragon, is the telaesthetic form coetaneously assumed by the sorcerer and the fetish-urn to serve as the single repository for the bifurcate emanations of the fourteen stars. The elixirs manifest as the transmutative agents of the Quintessence: the sidereal kalas of Azhdeha. These subtle alchymic time-essences are the secretions of the ophidian oracle and are reified through the vessel via the divers operations of the Great Work -the fourteen ordeals of the twice-turning path. The elixirs are thereby made apparent as states of consciousness which are cohered as perceptible zones of the sorcerer's totality. The revelation of this matter is at-tained solely through the practice of the Royal Arte. The physical imagery of the tongue, mouth and fangs are all cohered within this point; the cognate faculties of speech, consumption and envenomment are thus attributed and ruled by Al Shujah. Deeds of Arte such as the votive kissing of the vessel, the swearing of oaths upon its image, the passing-on of secrets, the consumption of sacrifical offerings and the entirety of all spoken enchantments are empowered through this, the First Gate of the Dragon's Power. Additional epithets:-Al Zhu'l-fiqra,-the double-bladed sword Al Shulaz-san,-a dreamed form of the name for the Dragon-point of the Tongue."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Gl'imorium 6~nomoaia Dl'aco'Taus ' II THE LEFT EYE The Point of the Dragon's left eye is attributed to the Stary Draco and is given the epithets of Al Tiriki and Al Tannin. The emanant force of this point transmits the lunar gaze of the serpent. This is the sorcerer's gaze of enchantment, the beguiling stare of allure which draws the sacrifice toward the vessel; the offering of the world unto the Dragon's jaws. Through the focus of Al Tiriki the eye of the sorcerer enters the vessel to behold the incuba-tion of phantasies and dreams; this is the in-turning of the sight-of the Watcher Within -to witness the transmutation of all that has been offered unto the vessel. Within the vessel the eye of the sorcerer is met with the Spirit of the Draconian Pact, the Daimon of the Snake. Through the enantiomorphic union of the twain the sorcerer's eye is out-turned to project the dream-forms into the world. The reciprocation between oneiric introspection and the outward projection of dream-forms creates the ouroboric continua of Al Tariki,-the sinistral eye of the Draconian Body. III THE RIGHT EYE The Point of the Dragon's right eye is attributed to the star u Draco and is given the epithet of Al Darakshan. The emanant force of this point transmits the solar gaze of the serpent. This is the sorcerer's gaze of control, the lucid witness of all that lies within and beyond the vessel. It is the gaze that perceives the interplay of forces and exerts the intent of the sorcerer in accordance with the necessities of its reification. Through the focus of Al Darakshan the eye of the sorcerer enters the vessel to perceive the matrix of the magical current; his eye turns inward to witness the Vision of the Design -the pattern which encompasses the fulfilment of the path. The knowledge of the path, its direc-tion and nature, are revealed in the meeting of the sorcerer's eye with the daimonic gaze of the serpent-spirit within the vessel. Through the eye of the Daimon the insurging power of the Dragon, the mediator of the Elder Gods, is transmitted. Through the enantiomorphic union of the twain the sorcerer's eye is out-turned to exert the will of the Draconian power upon the world. The reciprocation between waking introspection and the outward projection of the initiating force creates the ouroboric continua of Al Darakshan,-the dextral eye of the Draconian Body. There is a cross-roads point, an intersection of magical forces, formed through the interaction of the sinistral and dextral powers within the single field of the Dragon's Sight. This creates the double-ouroboros of non-dual perception, the encompass of the Blessed Sight, where-in all senses are conjoined. 17~"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"IV THE HEAD The Pact of Bfood and Gtarlight The Point of the Dragon's Head is given the epithet Al Halk.a, signifying 'the Primal Circle', and is attributed to the star ~ Draco, which bears the names of Grumium and Genam. Al Halka transmits the cognitive force which mediates between the mind of the sorcerer and the initiat-ing intelligences of the Magical Current. The cognitive force is the Psyche of the Dragon and is glyphed as the 'the edgeless circle': the horizon of the senses where-in the states of the Draco-nian Form are reified. The primal root of the Draconian Psyche - 'the concealed head of the Dragon' -is sacri-ficed within the interstitial void. It is cast forth into the Negated Abode of the Elder Gods and therein serves as a mediatory point between the domains of Presence and Absence -between Being and Becoming. The primal or zeroth head is identified with the Marriage-vessel. The sacrifice there-in signifies the translation of the sorcerer's mind, through the fire of offering, to the Abode of the Elder Gods: the Body of all Other. As from the ashes the new vessel is born, so from the sacrifice of the concealed head the seven crowned and revealed heads of the Dragon are realised. By this arcanum the trans-aeonic continuum of the sorcerous mind is established. The seven heads of the Dragon are the seven states of consciousness attained by the Seeker within the numbered circles of the year: the Rites of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua. A second epithet, Al Manda!, signifying the seven circles or worlds of emanation, is combined with the root-names of these mysteries according to which 'circle' is being evoked in the present con-sciousness of Mind. Al Halka, as the centre of thought between Serpent and Man, is the medium for the knowl-edge of the Crooked Path and the Gateway for the realisation of the Draconian Gnosis. The point of Al Halka completes the circle of the first four centres within the Dragon-body. These unite to form the foundation-point upon which basis the ten other centres each uniquely align unto the transcendent and unitive realisation of the aatic hendecarch. This correlation, which is symbolically explicated within the Rite of the Horns, provides the matrix of commune with the elevenfold power of the Elder Gods. v THE LEFT HORN The Point of the Left Horn bears the epithet of Al Tais and is attributed to the star 8 Draco. This point transmits the eternal and undying fire of initiation. It is the upright fire brand from whence the seed of the Antient One is cast forth from the void; sown across the ages through the sacred lineages of initiation to generate the flesh of witch blood. Symbolically the Left Horn is represented by the Black Serpent and is cognate with the mas-culine personification of the magical force within the Fourfold Body of the Witch-fathers: Ma-hazhael, Zhamael, Azhazael and Azhael. Through the point of Al Tais the serpent-force is cast forth through the sinistral gyre of power and is revealed by the masculine form-bodies of the bifurcate current. This arcanum is expressed through specific seasonal and ancestral mysteries relating to the aspirant's manifestation of the Dragon-body as depicted through the transfor-mative stages of the masculine deific vehicle: the birth, life, death and resurrection of the Witch-king. Upon the focus of Al Tais the form-bodies of the Lord are unified and honoured in the Name of Our Great Father Opposer."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl?nomosia Draco'Taus VI THE RIGHT HORN The Point of the Right Horn bears the epithet Al Sa'aqeh and is attributed to the star E Draco. This point transmits the falling lightning-bolt of magical power, the transilient spark of Gnosis which transcends the limits of temporal and spatial dimension to manifest in sudden and isolate centres of activity. Symbolically the Right Horn is represented by the Red Serpent and is cognate with the femi-nine personification of the magical force within the Fourfold Body of the Witchmothers: Liliya, Naamah, Rahab and Agrath. Through the point of Al Sa'aqeh the serpent-force is cast forth through the dextral gyre of power and is revealed by the feminine form-bodies of the bifurcate current. This arcanum is expressed through specific seasonal and ancestral mysteries relating to the fleshing of the Dragon as revealed through the alchymic changes of the feminine deific vehi-cle: the birth, life, death and resurrection of the Witch-queen. Upon the focus of Al Sa'eqah the form-bodies of the Lady are unified and adored in the Name of Our Great Mother Destroyer. Al Tais, the Left Horn, is the stellar focus of the ceonic continuum of awareness, whereas the Right Horn is the centre of transmission for the continuum of the fractional moment. The inter-action of the twain is reified through the hypostatic relation between the greater and lesser divisions of time. The field of their inter-action is convergent within the Point Al Halka, where-in their conjunction permits the coeval transmission of the trans-<eonic current with the singular moment of enchantment. Within the context of the seasonal and sexual mysteries the Left Horn is symbolised by the Plough and Phallus, and the Right Horn by the Sickle and Kteis. In accord with the normative attributions the genital power-zones of the Dragon correspond to the twelfth and thirteenth stellar foci. It is therefore that the energies transmitted through the Twin Points of the Horns interact with the powers of the stars Thu'ban and Qadam -these being the Points of the Sinis-tral and Dextral Legs of the Dragon. Within the context of this interaction, the Arcanum of the Horns is that of the eternal giving, the perpetual offering of the Seeker -as the Virgo Sabbati - to the visible and invisible forms of the Dragon-vessel. This sacrifice is temporally realised within the 'steps' of the sorcerer upon the Path from day to day, and thus by the solar and lunar gaits of the Witches' Step. VII THE SPINE The rachidian centre within the Draconian vehicle bears the epithet of Al Lataifa. This point is the focus of the triple axis: the tridentate sigil of the Column. The sidereal analogues of the Spine are the three stars -<I» ¢ and x Draco. The triplicity of stellar foci corresponds to the idea of triunity implicit within this, the central or heart-point of the Dragon-body. The Column, representing the body of the perfected initiate, unites the trinity of crossroad-points upon the cosmic axis: the zenith of the celestial, the mid-point of the world and the nadir of the infernal depths. The three crossroads are respectively governed by the Arcana of the Thu'ban, Hu and Ancestral Rites. The powers of the triune mysterium -of 174"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"'Ihe Pact of Blood and Gtarlight Ia-Hu-Hua - are transmitted by the ascent and descent of the serpent's fire between the head, heart and heels of the sorcerer; for in the exaction of these mysteries the lineal empowerment of the Dragon is passed on straightwise from the source of initiation. The psycho-physical basis for this transmission lies within the subtle matrix of the sacred ve-hicula which opens the sidereal gateways within the body of Man. From both hands alike, from both future and past, the Seeker who traverses the fourteen ordeals of the Path may attain unto their complete realisation within the unending moment of the present. For the Timeless Way of the Dragon-road deviates between Yesterday and Tomorrow to enflesh its Eternal Presence in each moment anew. The trinity of the zenith, centre and nadir are connected by the tridentate stave of the World-tree. In the body of Man the three blades of the trident-staff are the left-hand, central and right-hand channels of the ophidian current within the spinal column. It is through these subtil conduits that the lunar, sidereal and solar tides of the magical force are respectively directed throughout the body of the transcarnate vessel and are made manifest in the hot-point of the telluric circle. The many aspects of this triple mystery, its articulation and encryption within the spatial and temporal delineations of the path, are reflected within the Rite of the Draconian Oracle: the Seething, Revealing and Sealing of the Vessel. The rays of the seventh point are the 'vertebrae' of the Dragon's spine, the boughs of the World-tree. The radices of the point correlate to the letters and digits of the sacred cipher, the magical alphabet whereby the manifold power of the Dragon is translated from force to form and is circulated from zone to zone inside its vehicula. This internal correspondence establishes the connective principles between the Points of the Dragon-body; these being the secrets held within the states of awareness attained through the practices of the path. The internal correla-tion between states of consciousness and the 'vertebrae' of the Column is juxtaposed by the external correspondence between the 'scales' of the Dragon's skin and the outward reificatory aspects of the arcana: the deeds of the path itself. The deeds are both the practices themselves and the behavioural stratagems of cunning which are derived therefrom to hone the gait of the sorcerer in the world of man. The 'scales' of the Dragon reflect the state of entity and awareness which is being reified through the vessel of the sorcerer. This reflectivity indicates the subtle transmutative processes occurring within the perceptive state and may be observed by the Seeker as changes of colour, \\ibration and mood - often as distinct atmospheric shifts during ritual and contemplative prac-tice. There is here a co-relation between the lunar divisions of time, the anatomy of the Dra-conian vehicle and the colours attributed to states of consciousness. The internal and external correspondences revolve upon the pivotal a.xis of the Column and express the nature of the unifying energetic locations or hot-points of transference within the vehicle. The attainment of this knowledge begins at the initial moment of placing the step upon the Path; understanding is revealed in going forth upon the Dragon-road. For the spine is the road itself, the bone-strewn way between and beyond both womb and grave. 175"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"G:rimorium 0)!nomoeia Dra.co'Taus VIII THE LEFT CLAW The Point of the Left Claw or Foreleg is attributed to the star ~Draco and bears the epithet Al Dhi'ban. This point relates to the sinistrality of the Witches' Clasp: the sorcerer's beckon unto the Shadow. In this arcanum, the left hand reaches backward and into the abyss of night to draw forth the ancestral host of the dead into one's embrace; unified as the Body of the Beloved. Thus being led, as by the very matriarch of the ancestral pathway, the procession of the dead conjoins with the sorcerer in the marriage-bed of the sacred vessel. Therein is celebrated the nuptial taking of the Mighty Dead as the Consort of the Corpse-queen upon the Path of Infernal Descent. The point of Al Dhi'ban denotes the going-forth of the sorcerer into the unruled company of every obscene abomination, the en-trance into the dominion of elemental genii, and thus the confrontation with the spate of serpent-djinn and spirits,-the undead children born through the sloughing of the sacred vessel. The arcanum of Al Dhi'ban is held within the task of rectification, the alchemical re-align-ment of the poisons which have seethed within the vessel. This task is cognate with the re-vitalisation of the dead and to the methods of resurgence which draw impetus from the dormant strata of consciousness. IX THE RIGHT CLAW The Point of the Right Claw or Foreleg is attributed to the star fJ Draco and bears the epithet Al Auhakan. This point relates to the dextrality of the Witches' Clasp: the sorcerer's gestures of power within and upon the substance of the World. Herein the hand of the sorcerer reaches outward through the sacred vessel and into the World of Substance. Matter is taken as the Be-loved, the object and idol of the sorcerer's embrace. Within this arcanum the sorcerer walks as one with the Sovereign of the World, his every action directs the invisible forces to act upon the visible forms of the Existant. Through the focus of Al Auhakan the sorcerer coheres the resources for his self-recreation. He is thus his own perpetual usurper. Al Auhakan is the centre of perception through which knowledge is extracted, translated and formulated from the energetic interaction of the initi-ate with the forces of the Dragon-body. Through the knowledge cohered from his practices the sorcerer engages himself in the re-determination of his perceptual horizon and thus in the continual refinement of his magical observance, discipline and life. The Left Hand of the Dragon-body establishes the backward out-reach of the sorcerer into the domains of the sloughed forms: the elemental effluvia and ancestral shades born of the path and its practices. The Right Hand of the Dragon-body establishes the forward out-reach of the sorcerer into the domains of the Living: the manifest reality within which he would project and reify his intent. By the Left Hand the forces of magick are manipulated and with the Right Hand the forms of manifestation are fashioned. The twain forces Al Dhiban and Al Auhakan meet in the crossroad-point of the vessel, here the dual out-reach of the sorcerer to 176"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The :Pact of Blood and Starlight the Queen of the Dead and the Lord of All Living is unified as the realisation of both as the extent of One Body. x THE LEFT WING The Point of the Left Wing is attributed to the star e Draco and bears the epithets of Al jenah-i-ahktor and Al Boracan. This point transmits the arcana of sidereal transvection: the knowledge pertaining to the Witches' Flight into the aerial and celestial spheres. Through this point the sorcerer may obtain the power to leap rapidly between stars, to fly between the states of aware-ness demarcated by the points and zones of the Dragon-body. This is reflected in the manifes-tation of physical and oneiric powers of flight, the ability to transform into the desired winged form and therein to traverse the kingdoms of the spirits above the earth. The transilient force emanated through this point establishes it as the connective zone be-tween states of awareness and thus as the centre through which a rapid cohesion may be fa-cilitated between the diverse fields of consciousness encompassed by the Form of the Dragon. Through this point the sorcerer arises in the Body of Light. His rites of intent cast new possibili-ties into the circle of chance and thus, throwing wide the Very Net of Heaven over the World, he prepares the Way amid flesh for the new birth of the Elder Gods. XI THE RIGHT WING The Point of the Right Wing is attributed to the star L Draco and bears the epithet of Al Dhih. This point transmits the arcana of chthonic transvection: the knowledge pertaining to the Witches' Flight into the subterranean and cavernous realms within and below the sphere of the earth. Through the focus of Al Dhih the sorcerer may obtain the power to descend upon the path of the dying sun into the kingdoms of the Mighty Dead. Within the Place of Shades he communes with the states of consciousness belonging to the ancestral powers and spirits. He enters within the tenebrous folds of the ancient psyche - there to behold the vast sweep of antiquity bared by the beating wings of the Shadow that he has become. Al Dhih is the point of cohesion for the atavistic impulses which inform the Dragon-body. Through this point the sorcerer descends in the Body of Shadow. His rites of intent recapitulate the wisdom of the ancestors and draw it forth through the gateway of the tomb, once more into the flesh of the living. XII THE LEFT HINDLEG The Point of the Left Hindleg is attributed to the star a: Draco and bears the epithet Thu'ban. Through the gateway of Thu'ban the sorcerer crosses the boundary of every horizon to place his step within the interstitial Kingdom of Qayin; in the fullness of his attainment to be exalted at its very centre upon the Empty Throne of Al Tan-Ta'us. In ritual terms, the Step ofThu'ban denotes the crossing-over of the circle's edge by the left foot, the traverse of the threshold be-tween the twin circles, and the final leap across the central fire. It simultaneously signifies the Beginning, Middle and End of the Path. Its teaching lies within the deed of attainment, the 177"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomoeia Draco'Taus stepless step within the empty point that makes one to stand fleetingly within the enflamed heart of the Unnumbered Circle. It is through this point that the earthly footsteps of the Dragon are revealed as the nexes of manifestation for the Gnosis, as the Body oflnitiates destined to practise the Great Mysteries of the Serpent. The theandric form of the initiate is enshrined within the body of Qayin, the Turnskin Child of the All-Opposer and the All-Destroyer; such is He and such is She that walks the Crooked Path. To those not of kindred nature, he seems to wear the mask that is both good and evil, fair and foul by turns. For it needs must be that the Seeker upon the Crooked Path is beyond the limits of every fixed way and law. Being beyond all normative perception, this point denotes the backwards embrace of purity: the direct path of voidwise return that is forever coming forth to flesh - the wayward step that leads to the source of all magical empowerment. The Point of Al Thu 'ban is also considered to focus and transmit the phallic sexual energies of the Dragon. This mystery is revealed throughout the grimoire within the especial arcana con-cerning the Agapae of the Witch-king. The arcana ofThu'ban correlate with certain formulae of the Left Horn to form the Cross-roads of the Step and the Plough. The seasonal symbology and significances of this correspondence are contained within the Hu Rite and in the Rite of the Horns (BA). There are also special celestial implications of this point:-Thu'ban is one of the seven stars in the esoteric cycle of the polar circumcession and marks a specific phase within the aeonic con-tinuum of the Great Year. The seven stars relate to the seven heads of the Dragon; the eighth head being their unity or mid-point. The seven stars are the points of transmission for the seven aeonic currents which, in total, comprise the single stream of magical power: the Quintessential Current. Thu'ban-Helios is revered as the gateway to this summit. These arcana are expressed within the Thu'ban Rite (IA) and within the Rite of the Seven Stars (KU). XIII THE RIGHT HINDLEG The Point of the Right Hindleg is attributed to the star K Draco and bears the epithet Al Qadam. This point transmits the female sexual energies of the Dragon and in conjunction with the Point of the Right Horn creates the Cross-roads of the Step and Sickle (see above). The reception of the thirteenth point's psycho-sexual emanations is obtained through the daily votive practice of the Stellar Transvocation, for the sorcerer is thereby aligned to the cycle of the lunar periodicity. The rays of the star are the emanations drawn upon through the vaginal mouth of the vessel. These energies are activated within the awareness of the sorcerer by the synastry established between the fourteen foci and the fractional digits of the lunar cycle. The temporal 'stepping' of the sorcerer upon these lunar digits is reified through the spells of the thirteenth point in opposing terms of a-temporal powers. This mystery is revealed as the Path within the moment, beyond the many cycles of the year and the day. Al Qadam denotes the stepping of the sorcerer both within and beyond the limits of time. Each step corresponds to an attainment of momentary unity with an emanation of the Formless Form. It simultaneously aligns a singular deed of sorcery undertaken upon the Path with the recapitulation of its traverse through the ages and a precognition of its futurity. In ritual terms, Al Qadam is the step upon the edge of the circle and the gait that leads one to walk directly within the manifest point of magistry. 178"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"XIV THE TAIL 'Ihc :Pact of Blood and Gtarlight The Point of the Dragon's Tail is attributed to the star A Draco and bears the name Al Ghauzar, meaning 'The Poison Place'. The Tail-star both rarefies and reifies the emanations of the God-form. It churns the oceanic abyss ofWitchblood, creating the tides of both Past and Future. Al Ghauzar coalesces the emanations of the stellar foci and gives them perceptible manifestation. These are the venomous sloughs of the serpent which are accumulated at the Full Moon and shed at each Dark Moon. In the Count of the Two Serpents the Transvocation of the Tail-star is worked both sides of the plenilunar gateway. Betwixt these two digits of Al Ghauzar the Full God-form is assumed, shining forth in the light of the Full Moon. The sloughs of the Form are shed from both antiq-uity and futurity, and are unified within the perfected assumption of the Draconick Body. The reflex of this act is at the Dark Moon when the God-form is once more assumed in total-ity during the course of the Oracle Rite. Through the plenilunar gateway of the Moon's full-ness the sloughs are focused and are translated to the oppositional gateway of the Dark Moon. During the working of the Oracle Rite the skin of the Form is cast off and regeneration begins as the Moon turns anew. The slough is the astral shell of the vessel: the corpse of sacrifice consumed by the sorcerer. In the Black Moon working of the Oracle Rite all is offered to the vessel; the World is slain to nourish the heart of the sorcerer's power. In this arcanum every illusion must be pierced and severed to reveal and perceive the Clear Light of Reality, every aversity must be turned to virtue, every bane to blessing. The subtil alchymic deed of inner transformation is externally juxta-posed within the ritual act of its equivalence -the offering of mumia to the opened mouth of the vessel. The sacrament is the Feast of Poisons, the imbibing of the dead husks fallen from the stars. As the sorcerer devours the slough of the Dragon, so does he take the turn-skin robe upon his back; and as the vessel is fed with the sheddings of the sorcerer's flesh, it obtains the heart of man. As the vessel is sealed and the Moon is reborn, so the Unified One of Man and Serpent rums anew upon the Path, his Divine Form replenished through the sacrament of transmuta-tion. It is thus that the Tail of the Dragon turns to touch the Tongue of the sorcerer and the Tail of the sorcerer turns to touch the Dragon's lips,-thus the Point of the Poison Place is aligned to che Tongue-star: the Double-ouroboros is cast. 179"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"G;rimorium G)?nomoi:sia Draco'Taus ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY Concerning the Names of the Fourteen Points The names and epithets ascribed to each of the fourteen dragon-points are, by uniformity of custom and in keeping with ancient star-lore, derived from the Persian Tongue. Some of the names used are those accorded by astronomical nomenclature, whilst in other instances the names are those ascribed by vertu and custom of esoteric usage. The epithets, or 'sorcerous kennings', used for a specific dragon-point throughout the course of the grimoire, are primarily adopted as poetic and mnemonic indicators of nature and func-tion within the context of the whole magical system,-thereby serving to impart a particular significance denoting the state/ s of consciousness centralised within and defined by the point as a microcosm of the entire draconian vehiculum. In certain cases of name and epithet, the origi-nally ascribed terms have changed through constant votive use and have transliterated through the psyche of the Dreamer to words new and strange. The Seeker is advised to study the relevant tables of correspondence in order to ascertain the varying names and titles for the fourteen points. Let each and all who undertake the rites of the Crooked Path utilise the knowledge laid down within these pages, but let each and all devise by their own ingenium and by the power of their own dreams, the manner of naming -for in the name of a star its light is given a voice. Concerning the Inner Arcana and Esoteric Functions of the Working Procedure Within each present realisation exists the eternal nature of the Gnosis. The intent of the Draco-nian Grimoire is to facilitate the processes whereby an especial awareness of that eternal nature is attained within the present existence. The potential for the attainment of self-realisation and transcendence is revealed to the Seeker with the first deed of the Path. Through the many devia-tions and complexities of the Great Mysteries, the Seeker is brought full circle through the cycle of initiation necessary for the explication of individual potential. The cycle of initiation does not begin or end within these pages, but lies within the turning of both Path and Circle -from this moment, through and beyond all temporality. The working procedure of the Transvocation integrates the chronotypes of the magical con-tinuum within the telluric sphere of activity. The stellar-aeonic\" solar-seasonal and lunar-peri-odic cycles of time are aligned through the daily empowerment of the psycho-physical centres of the Draconian vehicle and are thus unified within the manifest body of the earthly vessel. Aeon and Instant are one within the turning of the Dragon-year's Wheel. The cycles of tem-porality attenuate the momentary eternity of the circle and the point. Each cycle establishes, by the enumerative division of its respective calendrical rotation, the specialised chronotypes of ritual practise. The cyclical paths of the celestial bodies delineate the hypostates of the Great Circle of Arte and are unified within the timeless singularity of its horizon. As the many wheels of time are focused uniquely in each moment of the magical continuum, so too the moment is cast through and is unravelled within the divers cyclical procedures of ritual praxis. The Seven-rayed Aeon of Gnosis and the Ineffable Instant of Realisation are enfleshed by the stepping of the Seeker through the hidden door of the Ouroboros. The synastrian theandry of the Transvocation unites the interconnecting forces of the Circle of Eternity and the Present Flesh of the Sorcerer as One Body.

Ye are now stood before the Gateway of the Crimson Interstice. Unto you is this Mystery given: the Holy Rite of Hu. Ye that have travelled beyond the Threshold of the Crooked Path who have fulfilled the seven tasks according to the Serpent's design; ye are now summoned to the Twin Circles of Arte: the Double-ouroboros of Hu! INTRODUCTORY COMMENT The Hu Rite is a votive Mystery performed in veneration of the Serpent: the totemic embodi-ment and bestial personification of the Crooked Path. Within the cycle of the ritual year the Mystery of Hu is the first Great Rite or Ceremony of the Double-ouroboros to be celebrated. The customary date for its exaction is February 2nd, the first cross-quarter day of the year. This sacred occasion is known as 'The Crimson Interstice of Time'; to the Initiate knowing of the secret alignments of temporality and eternity it may be realised as a Gateway beyond the Wheel of the Year and the Day-a Gateway leading ever to the moment true-chosen by intent. The Mystery of Hu is to be worked-alone or in the Covine of Four-by those who have ful-filled the required ordeals of the Crooked Path prior to the ordained day of the rite. Only when these ordeals have been surpassed will the Crimson Interstice of Time be revealed. When all are are thus prepared, whensoever that may be, then is the time deemed truly a-right for the step to approach this threshold. Know that the tasks of the Path leading unto the Blood-red Gateway of Hu are seven in num-ber, these are:-the preparation of the Self prior to the undertaking of the Hieros Gamos, the fulfilment of the Marriage Rite, the Ordeal of its Consummation, the Creation of the Dragon-vessel, the accomplishment of the Pact of Blood and Starlight, the working of the Stellar Spells by the Count of the Two Serpents, and, upon the ordained occasions of the Dark Moon, the solitary Rite of the Draconian Oracle. (For further counsel concerning the deeds of preparation 196"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Rite of HU see below: 'Additional Commentary: Daily Practice -Preparation and Clarification) Let none but Those who have fulfilled the Seven Tasks undertake the Rite of Hu. THE WORKING PROCEDURE The Hu Rite has the following tripartite procedure:-1) The Rites of the First Circle:-The Summoning unto the Mystery of Hu. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle, in accordance with the Teachings of the Black Earth. The Enchantment of the Seven Tasks. 2) The Rites of the Second Circle:-Preparatory Address to the Dragon-vessel. The Vagitus. The Formulae of Consecration: the Seven Sacrifices. The Fourteenfold Arcana of Hu. 3) The return unto the First Circle:-The Vagitus IL The Charm of the Forge. The Consummation of the Mystery. FORM AND FUNCTION The following commentary should be read and studied both before and after the working of the Mystery: it may be used as a means to prepare the mind and as a means to clarify the under-standing that is born from deed alone. The function of the Hu Rite is initially to define, and subsequently to transmute, the founda-tion of magical awareness as it has been established in the Aspirant through the fulfilment of the seven initial tasks of the Crooked Path. The rite's purpose is thus to recapitulate the steps of progression upon the pilgrimage taken thus far, and to utilise their present empowerment in order to augment a focal context of change through which the sorcerer may partake in the manifold nature of the Dragon. The hot-point of transmutation created through the Mystery of Hu is attenuated throughout the entire course of its ritual procedure and is revealed through divers modes of enumerative symbolism. In passing through its many deeds the sole purpose is to cohere the matrix of magical perception and thereby facilitate the unified realisation of the Path within the fourteen centres of the Draconian Body. The form of the rite, in terms of its geometrical and procedural structure, reflects the trans-mutative function of its arcana. The twin circles forming the compass of its operation delineate the Self and the Other as the twin domains of Presence and Absence. (See Temenos and other appropriate formulae of the Twin Circles). Furthermore, the Double-circle describes the Self in the dual terms of its Being and Becoming, that is, as the sum of the Past and as the potential of the Future. 197"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium G,l?nomosia D.raco'Tau.s The praxes undertaken within the first circle of Hu serve to define and clarify the present state of the sorcerer at the chronological point of the rite's inception: the self-created birth of the Seeker as attained through the first seven initiatory ordeals of the Path Entire. The ritual practices used to affirm this attainment are 'The Rite of the Draconian Oracle' and a summatory address -'The Enchantment of the Seven Tasks'. The former and principal practice of the Oracle Rite is worked according to the Teaching of the Black Earth and thus serves as a general demonstration of acquired knowledge. The latter practice -'The Enchantment of the Seven Tasks' - defines this acquired knowledge in a specific manner, that is, as an explicit recapitulation of the seven initiatory ordeals thus far undertaken. The praxes within the second circle of Hu serve to transvaluate the state of past attainment-as signified by the incantations and deeds within the Blood-acre -and to reify its potentiality in the telluric form of the Dragon-body. This is primarily achieved through a votive procedure undertaken at the centre of the second circle, during which the seven prerequisite ordeals for the Hu Rite are reflected and extrapolated in a parallel series of seven sacrificial offerings. Once this heptarchic sacrifice has been made upon the central or zeroth point of the second circle, it is repeated-in appropriately specialised forms -upon each of the fourteen nodes or 'altars' located upon the spiral earth-sign which uncoils from the circle's heart. By the Seven Powers, known and unknown, the primordial altars of the Crooked Path are con-secrated; the fourteen points of Hu are raised and revered as the Draconick Shrines of the Earth: the 'Secret Temples' of Azhdeha. By these Grand Arcana the numinous powers of the fourteen shrines are drawn forth from the void and are made manifest as zones of empowerment within the physical medium of the practitioner - as locations within the Kingdom that is yet to be! The fourteen nodes of the Hu geoglyph function as the tell uric hot-points of intent, as the exte-riorised loci of the bodily centres through which the powers of the Dragon are enfleshed. Each point is an 'earthen crossroads' - a thoroughfare between the zenith and nadir of the Triple Axis. For the intent of the Hu Spells is to embody the terrene zones of empowerment which mediate betwixt the celestial palaces and the chthonic necropoles, that is, between the irradi-ant stars ofla in the vault of heaven and the averse foci of Hua within the abodes of the Mighty Dead. One may interpret the Arcana of the Hu Rite as the catalysing medium for the initial manifesta-tion of Qayin Azhaka - the Primordial Sorcerer - whose 'incarnation' is the unique transmis-sion of the Draconian Body of Magical Power to each Initiate. The spells and magical formulae of Hu may thus be practised in order to augment the realisable potential of the Draconian Gnosis as a whole and should be used adjunctively - whenever deemed needful -to reify the various Mysteries constituting its complete manifestation. The primary transgressive nature of the Hu Rite exemplifies the Sorcerer's Rede: the Un-spoken Law of Qayin. The initiatic ordeal of the rite aims to facilitate an understanding of the votive ethos implicit to the Crooked Path as a whole. It is thus that the temporal location of this Mystery-as the first major ceremony after Midwinter - serves to prefigure the matrix of sacrificial arcana for the Pathway-to-be: to prepare and open the Way for the Great Sabbatic Rites that are yet to become manifest upon the Wheel of the Year. Through the Rite of Hu the immutable stars of Azhdeha radiate their powers within and throughout the Domain of the Flesh and there shine forth as the many earthly powers of the Wise. 198"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of HU By the Word 'Azha-Hu' let the Seven Tasks of Preparation be sealed and perfected, let the Manifold Breath of Empowerment gather together the many needful requisites of Our Arte!

The chant is the Logos of the Dragon-point, its vibration the means of aligning and harmo-nising the candidate unto the powers of the Draconick Body. As so desired, the chant should be raised in pitch as an exaltant paean to accompany the lauded utterance of the main formula, or else diminished as a whisper to facilitate absorption in the act oflistening. Furthermore, the chant may be embellished through musick-by drum and by dance.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY TO the Fourteen Arcana of Hu The Mystery of Hu is the Creation of the Fourteenfold Temple of the Dragon upon the Earth. The entire procedure of the Hu Rite vivifies the fourteen dragon-points within the body of the initiate. Through conjunction with the prerequisite and subsequent tasks of initiation it serves w cohere the focal states of transitional consciousness whereby the aspirant becomes the living vosel receptive to the empowering continuum of the Crooked Path. Whereas the Stellar Spells create the ingression of the initiating current through the sidereal points of external focus, the Hu Spells reify the current of gnosis within terms of physicality -as the manifest powers of the Dragon within the flesh. It is the realisation of the 'stars' as physical power-zones which is of primary importance in comprehending the function of the Rite and its composite arcana; for It is through this understanding that the initiating current, incepted through the daily praxis oi the Stellar Spells, is given the mundane context of its reification. In combination with the Sallar Arcana and with the other series of formulae constituting the Draconian Gnosis the Hu Spells serve to focus and direct the manifold ebbing and flowing of the ophidian energies into, ch.rough, and beyond the earthly vessel of the sorcerer. 9.61"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Grimorium 02nomoaia Draco'Ta.us The Point of Communion In practical terms throughout the Rite the singularity of the sorcerer's awareness focuses within 'the Point of Communion'. The one-pointedness of sentience is attenuated in various manners, but it is the fourteenfold hypostasis attained through the telluric dragon-points which forms the primary context of manifestation for the Monad of Awareness: I. In consideration of this understanding it is important to give comment upon the manner in which the One Point is translated to the fourteen specialised microcosmic zones, both within the geomantic linearity of the earth-signs and in the body of the sorcerer. At the beginning of each Spell the sorcerer stands before a virginal point of the earth-sign, a node of the geoglyph transected by a simple cross-signing of powders to signify its appointed position. The point is latent, both in its ritual expression and within the physical body of the sorcerer; it is a power-zone of potentiated force accrued through the ordeals of the path and awaiting the empowerment of'Hu': the word carried upon the breath of the Dragon. The process through which the immanence of each point is realised is specific to the nature of each separate power-zone, but with each point it is begun with a simple formula of consecra-tion:-The one-pointedness of the sorcerer is given form as a coin or votive obulus: a token symbol-izing the transaction between the mortal aspirant and the Serpent. The function of the coin is to create the initial alignment between a node of the physical body, a node of the earth-sign and a facet of the Dragon; the process of its silent consecration functions to achieve this purpose. The coins used for this act should have passed through the fire of the longest night and have been gathered therefrom with the ashes of consummation. The process of the coin's consecration is as follows. Firstly, the coin is blessed without word -it is kissed and thereby receives the breath of empowerment: the stellar breath of initiation. Secondly, it is touched to the appropriate part of the sorcerer's flesh, this is to signify the part of physicality subject to the transmutative procedure of the Spell. Thirdly, the coin is offered at the corresponding node of the spiral geoglyph; it is placed within the 'mouth' of the earth, and there serves as the fee of entrance into the state of communion between Serpent and Man. The coin opens the point and creates its nexus of empowerment. The nexus is then extended to form a zone of votive concentration by the act of tracing a specialised earth-sign around the place of the coin's burial. This zone is then regarded as the Point of Communion in extension and serves as the 'Shrine' or sacred area in which the gestures of the Spell are enacted and upon which the many offerings are sacrificed. The power-zone focalising the communal point is further realised through the placing and lighting of a single candle upon the location of the coin's burial. This literally 'inflames' the point with the substance and essence of illumination. The candle-flame serves as a visible por-tal - a gateway of light through which the current of initiation may effuse all who gather at its earthen crossroads. With the lighting of the waxen taper the Shrine is prepared; the flame is the wordless signal for the Spell to be pronounced. In addition to the alignments established by the coin, earth-sign and candle, the awaken-ing of the physical counterpart to each geomantic dragon-point is most specifically attained through the ritual gestures of the Sacred Blade. For the Sorcerer's Knife, the Holy Arthana, serves as the embodiment of the transgressive sacrality which characterizes the very ethos of the Crooked Path. Its turning betwixt earth-sign, flame and flesh-the microcosmic hypostases of the Monad - delineates the course of sacrifical transformation partaken of by both the Sorcerer and the Ophidian Power. The Arthana is thereby realised as the weapon of intercession that moves between the twain forms of Man and Snake: it is wielded by both against the other and by the Other against both. ~6~"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of HU The Times of the Hu Rite In accordance with the chronomantic arcana of the Sacred Arte and in terms germane unto the nature of the Crooked Path, the time appointed for working of the Hu Rite occurs when the candidate has completed the seven prerequisite tasks of the Path and the first light of il-lumination begins to quicken amid the darkness of his ordeals. Its time is therefore chosen by the omens of attainment upon the Path and by the motion of the Dragon's intent within the aspirant. In the operative lore of the Quadrigan Covine it is the duty of the Presiding Magister to guide his fellow aspirants, to recognize when they have fulfilled the prerequisite ordeals and have sufficiently attained for the next step to be taken upon the Path. It is said that the empow-erment of Hu serves to strengthen the waxing power of the Sun and the Greening of the Earth; this signifies the increase of the initiatory light and the quickening of magical powers within the body. When all are deemed ready by the Seen and the Unseen Intercessor, then only is the true time for the Conclave of Hu to be entered. By the Lore and Tradition of Arte, the day appointed for the exaction of the Mystery falls at the calendrical point of the Crimson Interstice -the Mystical Location of Time when the Heavenly Step of the Dragon is turning from the North toward the East, marking the midpoint berween the Royal Stars of Boreas and Eurus. In the customary sequence of the Great Rites upon the Wheel of the Sacred Year the ap-poimed date for the Hu Rite is Candlemas, February 2nd, but such depends upon the readiness of che candidate/s. If deemed necessary it is permissable for the rite to be postponed until all members of a covine are fully prepared; yet even so, if the augur of dreams reveals that all must dare che ordeal - whether ready or not -then all must step forth. \\\\ ben worked in entirety it is needful that the Rite should be practised during the course of one single day, by both the fire of the aureate sun and the argent glow of the moon,-trespassing rhe border oflight and darkness. In daily practice the especial time appointed for the use of the Hu Arcana is at the midpoint becween the Black Noon of the Dead and the moment of the Sun's rising. Dail~· Practice -Preparation and Clarification The following counsel concerning Daily Practice may be applied both before and after the main working of the Hu Rite - to both prepare and to clarify. The daily practice of the Hu Arcana may be undertaken in conjunction with the Enchant-DX'llts of the Draconian Hypostasis, the Empowerment Practices of Azha-Hu, and with the ~bin Incantation of the Stellar Transvocation. \\\\ben integrating the Hu Arcana with the Practice of the Stellar Transvocation the fourteen Hu Spells are to be worked with -or in place of - the fourteen Stellar Spells. In this context, ~emphasis in the Formula of the Transvocation is upon the establishment of the fourteenfold \"Sa.tet: Temple' as the midpoint between the polarity of'Celestial Palace and Infernal Necropo-lis\". The named order of these three axis-points within the Transvocatory Enchantment should thaefore be altered in accord with the primary context of one's work. If one intends to use the entire sequence of the Hu Rite over a course of a single lunar month-before and/or after the appointed date of the Main Rite - one should commence at the moment of the Moon's turning from Old to New: the hour after the fulfilment of the Black ~loon Rite. One should therefore commence at the instant of the Moon's waxing and thus go tionh from the dark circle of the Oracle Rite to the lucent domain of Hu. One should work the prdiminary acts of the Rite -the Enchantment of the Seven Tasks, the Consecration of the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Grimorium 62nomoeia Dra.co'Taue Seven Offerings et alia ... -at the very beginning of the month, ideally upon the night of the New Moon, and then proceed to work a single spell each night in the customary procedure known as 'The Count of Two Serpents'. If one intends to work the Hu Formulae solely within one fortnight of the lunar month, one should commence at either the New or Full Moon and adapt the procedure accordingly. With regard to the use of the Hu Arcana as the subject of a daily votive procedure there are a number of practical adaptations which must be considered by the aspirant. Primarily, one should establish the focal area of one's personal domicilary shrine as the sum 'Point of Communion'. The single power-zone of votive concentration will thereby incorporate the divers manifestations of the Point which are made apparent through the course of the Rite. The shrine of the home-hearth will thus become the mystical location for each of the fourteen secret temples of the Dragon: a mirror of the Seeker's own being. In order to accentuate the focal nature of the shrine and to fulfil the necessary requirements of the Rite, one may utilise and adapt the following directions:-i) An unmarked square of virgin white cloth should be placed upon the floor before the al-tar. This is the skin that shall be taken by the vessel at the consummation of the Mystery. The cloth should be of sufficient dimension so as to accommodate the necessary requisites of Arte. It should be marked using charcoal and coloured dyes with the sign of the double-circle. Within the encompass of that sign the full adornment of the trident-crossroads and the spiral path of the labyrinth should be traced in microcosm. Each day one may add to the sigildry thereof by tracing in the appropriate sign for the point being worked with. ii) Upon the midpoint of the cloth one should place a bowl of wood, clay or metal. It should be of sufficient size to receive the Offerings of the Rite and thereafter to contain the Dragon-vessel. At the commencement of practice one should place the Dragon-vessel within the empty bowl and perform the initial praxes, whether cited from the text of the Main Rite or from the adjunc-tive praxes of the Transvocation, the Hypostasis, or the Azha-Hu Formulre. Having established the focal area, one should remove the vessel from the bowl and utilise the bowl as the receptacle to receive the Sevenfold Offering of Hu. When the divers substances thereof have been placed within the bowl the Consummation of the Seven Offerings should be recited. Thereafter the sacrifices should be covered over with earth - this should have been taken from the hearth of the circle wherein the Rite of the Longest Night was worked or gath-ered from a burial-ground at the Dark of the Moon. iii) The bowl, having received the Sevenfold Offering and this being covered with the sacred earth, is the microcosm of the World-field. The Dragon-vessel is to be placed therein and a single candle lit upon it at the appropriate juncture of the ritual procedure. The vessel, in being so prepared, becomes the focal point for the communion of the Mystery. The sorcerer should adorn the vessel as directed by the aesthesis and ascesis of the fourteen arcana. An examplar of such adornment is to place around the vessel a number of snake-bone rosaries. The significance of this is to depict the 'compass of encircling coils' as referred to in the summation of each Spell. With each day of practise and each new enchantment, the vessel and bowl move as one upon the tracery of the cloth. At the conclusion of the votive cycle of 14 or 28 days the consummatory parts of the Hu Rite should be used to bind the entire procedure. The offering bowl should be removed from the ~64"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of HU doth and the Dragon-vessel taken therefrom and placed upon the midpoint of the doth. Seven pinches of earth should be taken from the contents of the bowl and these should be placed within the vessel at the next working of the Oracle Rite. The remaining contents of the offering bowl should be taken to the circle-hearth or burial-ground upon the night of the Dark Moon, immediately prior to the working of the Oracle Rite. The cloth is to be used as the means of symbolically binding the whole votive procedure to the vessel and should accordingly be used to wrap the vessel at the time of the Oracle Rite. Within the cloth one should also place a certain tithe of the offerings which have been exacted throughout the procedure. A secondary examplar of daily praxis is to perform the whole ritual structure in microcosm using the cloth and bowl. The method is the same as that given above, but with the following variants. The practice begins at the Dark Moon. i) One should place the Dragon-vessel at the midpoint of the cloth's sigillic tracery -as if at the threshold of the Double-ouroboros. The empty bowl should be placed before it, as if at the centre of the second circle. Throughout the working procedure the Dragon-vessel remains unmoved, whereas the bowl is moved with each successive day, from point to point upon the labyrinthine path of the second circle. ii) The bowl is to be initially consecrated in the same manner as stated above,-filled with the substances of the Sevenfold Offering and covered over with earth. The earth should be flattened and tilled by hand and knife so that its surface is like unto the skin of the World-field. The magi-cal coin, the sacrificial fee or Sabbatic token, is to be buried in the bowl, and the candle which is to serve as the 'altar-flame' should be placed in the midst of the earthen skin. iii) The sigils for each point should be traced both upon the cloth and upon the surface of the earth within the bowl. As the bowl is moved from point to point it is needful that a new sigil be traced within its field. Therefore each day a new layer of grave-earth or hearth-ash should be sprinkled over the bowl's contents so that a new sigil can be clearly demarcated upon the sur-face. The sigils traced within the bowl should be marked using the sacred powders and tokens of wortcunning as used for the main procedure of the rite. As the bowl is moved from the centre of the labyrinth to the fourteenth point the count of days should bring the bowl and vessel together at the Full Moon. At that time one should work the complete assumption of the Stellar Transvocation together with a summatory form of the Hu Arcana. With the count of days from Full to Dark Moon the vessel and bowl may be moved as one, returning inward upon the spiral to its zeroth point. At the time of the Black Moon the procedure will be the same as that given in the first ex-ample of the votive procedure. These two forms of daily procedure are given as examples which may be applied and adapted by the aspirant for specific use when working within the limitations of the domiciliary shrine. The two methods express the positioning of one's awareness in the hot-points of magical transition ~-the motion and position of the vessel and sacrificial receptacle. The first procedure exempli-ties the rransmutative stages of the path undertaken by the aspirant as the embodiment of the Draconian vessel: as the vessel and bowl move in conjunction the aspirant is moved through the sups of the path as delineated by the fourteen dragon-points. The second procedure articulates b_\\-deed the 'going forth' of the aspirant in the Body of the Other: as the bowl is moved through the course of the labyrinth, so the Dream-body of the Seeker is cast forth and transformed"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomoeia Draco'Taue within the fourteen nexes of the Rite. As the vessel is brought in conjunction with the bowl at the Full Moon, so the Dreaming Body and the carnal vehicle of the sorcerer are unified. If so desired, one may apply these two procedures over the course of a single lunar month, one method in each fortnight of the waxing and waning moon. Elsewise let the cunning of the sorcerer conjoin these expressions of the Hu Rite in a direct manner, attaining to the state of gnosis wherein the requisites of the Arte and the Flesh are unified within the subtil body of the Dragon-vessel. Let this be accomplished in both mind and matter-in imagination and in flesh! The Working of the Hu Rite in successive years of practice If it is deemed appropriate for the sorcerer or the co vine to celebrate the Mystery of Hu during successive years of ritual observance, then let them note well the following counsel. And know that before any may seek to utilise these directions the Rite of Hu must have been worked through in completion according to its original text at least once - whether that be in covine assembly or in solitary devotion. Thus, let Those who have attained in the Crimson Interstice of Time, heed well! In successive years of turning the Dragon-wheel of Time, let the Mystery of Hu be worked in full, residing upon the basis of its formal texts - solely from the Oracle Rite within the First Circle until the completion of the Sevenfold Offering upon the Zeroth Point in the Second Circle. Thereafter, in going forth upon the spiral of the earth-sign, no formal observance from the text need be used, but rather the direct transmission of the heart should be revealed. Upon each of the fourteen shrines the customary on-lay of coin, earth-sign and candle should be established, likewise the substances of the seven offerings should be made in both mind and matter. In each year of practice the purpose of these offerings is to empower the potential of the Path-to-be! Accordingly one should exact them with great diligence. In addition, each shrine should be hallowed by its man tic formula and by the spontaneous paean of inspiration. Having fulfilled the pilgrimage of the fourteen shrines, the texts for the consummatory parts of the rite may be retained as appropriate. This manner of adaptation may be applied to all of the Double-ouroboric Rites throughout the year. The Grand Oratorial forms of ritual text as given herein are the means to apprehend the forces of the Dragon. When the Mysteries have been attained within, their outer forms must be transmuted to reflect the progression of the Seeker. SUMMATION The Primordial Sorcerer's birth-cry sounds and re-sounds: the Vagitus at the liminal threshold of the twain circles. Its double call marks the crossroads between Absence and Presence, and hallows the thoroughfare for the spirit-procession across the borderland of time. The moment of the Great Return is voiced within the interstice of space, forever establishing the nature of the axial midpoint as the gap between all worlds of time and domain. Whenever the Spells of Hu are uttered by the sorcerer he stands once more at this unnumbered point between the Acre of Blood and the Empty Circle. One foot is turned to the compass of the unfalling stars and the other to the world of flesh; both await the revelation of his going forth anew by the hooks and crooks of the Way. ~66"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"The Rite of HU With a single step into the Circle of Presence the Mystery of Hu is made manifest, the Self is imaged-forth as the Turnskin Child.

May the Blessing, the Cursing and the Cunning be upon all who partake in this pilgrimage. SEALING THE MYSTERY OF HU \\\\'hen the Mystery of Hu, its Main Rite and forms of Daily Observance, have been completed the following mode of practice may be used to seal its empowerment. Be seated in contemplative stillness before the Dragon-vessel. Let a single blood-red candle be placed and lit atop the vessel; let incense be offered and, with a single knell upon the ritual bell, let the practice commence. Firstly one should establish the ritual domain by practising the basic form of 'Hallowing the Kingdom'. By this means, stabilise one's presence in the centre of the Sphere of all Directions. Secondly, recite the Main Conjuration of the Stellar Transvocation, adapting its text to focus upon the reification of the Fourteenfold Secret Temple of the Dragon. At the juncture of the practice wherein the Stellar Spells are usually recited, perform the entire praxis of Azha-Hu. Thirdly, the Empowerment Practice of Azha-Hu should be strengthened in the following man-ner:-As each short formula is recited a blood-red point oflight should be visualised in the ap-propriate body-part. Then, as the mantic formula of the point is being recited and the Arthana is being touched to the body-part, the point of inner light should be transformed into the ap-propriate sigil from the Hu Rite. As one chants the magical name of the point, one should imagine that the sigil has been trans-formed into the form of a blood-red snake which coils and uncoils within the body-part, trans-forming the substance of flesh into the appropriate facet of the Dragon-body. The chant may be accompanied by musick if so desired, by bell, horn and drum. The visualisa-ti-On should be maintained throughout. When the body-part has been magically transformed in this manner, one should perceive the unagined forms gradually returning - from the expansiveness of the Draconick Form to the an.age of the blood-red snake, from the snake to the sigil, from the sigil to the blood-red point otlight. Finally, the point should be perceived to dissolve into the flesh, its essence vivifying the lxxh-\\\\ith the numina of the Hu Arcana. Fourthly, when the process detailed above has been undertaken with each part of the Azha-Hu Pncrice, one should imagine oneself to be encircled on every side by a vast Serpent of Blood-red"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo~ia Draco'Taus Fire. One should reside in meditation upon this image, chanting 'AZHA-HU' both internally and externally. Finally, one should begin to perceive the Serpent of Fire dissolving from the horizon of one's consciousness inward toward the centre of the body, its incarnadine light pervading and purify-ing one's entirety. As this process of absorption is undertaken, the closing stanza of the Stellar T ransvocation should be recited: 'Jn the seething chaos of the universe new-born, I was. In the dwin-dling twilit death of worlds, I shall be .... '. As the last words of the Transvocation are spoken the Serpent of Fire should be fully absorbed within the physical body and all awareness should be focused upon the final sign of its presence: a seed of blood-red light shining in the centre of one's heart. The seed oflight should be realised as the Quintessence of Hu. With the words 'QA YIN HU-AZHAKA' its empowerment should be made flesh, dissolved wholly within oneself. The candle atop the Dragon-vessel should be extinguished and the session of practice deemed complete. With a single knell, let it be so! In the Name of the Turnskin the Mystery of Hu is sealed.

The Zeroth Offering of I 0 Be gathered in solitude before the Sacred Vessel of Azhdeha. Let this be accomplished internally by the power of imagination and/ or externally by the bodily presence of the fetish-urn. The Zeroth Offering is as follows:-Visualise the Dragon-vessel as a skull-cup formed of clear black light, boundless and empty, yet containing the absolute nature of all Being-the nullific ipseity of all Existence. When the vision has become vast and expansive, its form should be offered in sacrifice to the Elder Gods; the vision should be relinquished from the grasp of Thought and thus be returned to the voidful infinity of the Silent Mind. The nature of the Dragon-vessel and the void should be realised as identical. This realisation actuates the zeroth offering of the practice.

PROCEDURE FOR SUCCESSIVE OFFERINGS At the beginning of each of the following offerings - the contemplative sacrifices of AZHA, MAH, TAN-KHU-SA and so forth-the mind should start with an image of the vessel based upon its natural, physical appearance and undertake the process of its imaginal transforma-tion according to the method of the specific meditative procedure.

This should be projected as a single point of pure white light, shining within the centre of the Dragon-vessel. The light of the illumined point should be seen to expand, filling and empowering the vessel until it has become a universe of clear, albeate light.

In making the four offerings one purifies the moment of one's death and draws its power into the present nature of the Path, thereby liberating one-self from attachment to physical form and augmenting the unification of one's nature with the subtil basis of essence which underlies the substantive world of elemental being. In this outer interpretation the four offerings bestow the empowerments of the Four Witch-fathers. In their inner interpretation, the four offerings of Earth, Water, Fire and Air respectively purify the four greater attainments of the Seeker: the fruition of the path, the actions of the path, the comprehension of the sacred teachings, and the reception of the lore from the powers of initiation. In this interpretation the four offerings bestow the empowerments of the Four Watchers (see Tan: The Rite of the Peacock-angel).

Hear each flame whispering, murmuring the incantations of forgotten wisdom, dispelling all impurities from the faculty of speech. Meditate upon this emanation until a sphere of solid blue fire has been established in clarity of mind. The generation and stabilisation of the midnight-blue circle is the basis of this practice and is traditionally known as 'The Circle of Witch-fire'. It forms the primal sphere of magical protec-tion and functions as a secret sign of recognition - a symbolic indication of initiatory power -between the practitioner of these mysteries and all sentient beings. 2) HU-SHUA When the sphere of midnight-blue illumination has become like an gigantic egg all around you, visualise its form as the pupil of an immeasurable eye, opening wide to behold the extent of the cosmos, blazing forth rays of flawless, blood-red light throughout the compass of all possibili-ties and thereby purifying the field of all perception. This establishes the Circle of Limitless Sight. 3) SA-SHUA All around the image of the blazing eye, behold a mighty skull - a vast temple hewn of ancient bone - irradiant throughout with purifying amber light, and filled with the essence of all Magi-cal Wisdom. This establishes the Circle of Eternal Knowledge. 4) BA-SHUA Visualise streaks of saffron fire and lightning searing over the surface of the skull, striking out-ward, rippling and crackling; each bolt carrying forth the essence of Eternal Knowledge in thunderous words of divine empowerment. This establishes the Circle of the Primordial Speech of the Sixteen Guardians. s)KU-SHUA Imagine the fiery lightning-bolts hurtling outward, striking and empowering a barrier formed of great chains of interlocking snake-hones. Create a vast sphere of protection with illimitable rings of churning vertebrae, gnarled and thorned, locked together in tessellated orbits of bone upon bone. All around the bone-wall swirls a green mist, symbolising the powers of oracular wisdom. This mindful projection establishes the Circle of Knowledge, realised as Stable Under-standing and Protection. 6) LA-SHUA Perceive great hooked claws bursting forth from the mist-veiled bones, a million sickle-blades and scimitars, clashing and rending; each cutting a doorway in the limits of an azure sky; each opening a gateway into the Body of the Unknown. Let the barrier of claws extend farther and farther outward, opening door upon door, breaking down all possible obstructions between the Seeker and the Path of his Intent. This establishes the Circle of Boundless Knowledge, realised as the Foundation for Manifestation and Deed. ~8~"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Opening the Mouth of Enchantment 7)TAN-SHUA Beyond the countless open doorways perceive a mighty, rushing wind-a dark and indomitable stormwind-raised by unseen wings, turning and churning throughout the countless aethyrs of the celestial spaces. This establishes the Circle of Realised Knowledge, of Mindful Clarity liberated into Infinite Possibilities of Attainment. 8) HUA-SHUA Beyond the limitless sphere of the unseen wings moves a vast and unfathomable circle of rain-bow light, a barrier formed from the infinite coils of the Antient Serpent's skin. Upon each shimmering scale is a letter of the magical alphabet: a sigil of the Dragon's Primordial Wisdom. As the coils rasp and move, scale upon scale, the universe is filled with the utterance of the million signs of knowledge. This establishes the Outer Circle of the Infinite Concourses of Wisdom. 9) SHUA-I The utterance of the sigils manifests as a shoreless ocean of midnight-blue light: a limitless void of illumined mind. This is the flame upon the tip of your tongue. This is the empowerment of Gnosis opening the Mouth of Enchantment. In the moment that this arcanum is realised the manifold images of this Vision are dissolved in the form of endless blessing upon the tip of the Seeker's tongue. BILD BILD HU-SHUA AZHA KA! CONSUMMATION To complete and seal the entire cycle of this practice, behold the Dragon-vessel and perceive it to be filled with the black-golden elixir of the Magical Quintessence. The elixir is the pure nature of wisdom established by the divers methods of the whole praxis. From the vessel's heart the elixir is transmitted in two streams of nectar and poison, and flows directly to the tip of your tongue. The two streams proceed to flow and circulate throughout and around your whole being. The entire empowerment of the practice is bestowed within this dual stream. The body of the Seeker becomes the Land of the Two Rivers. In the Void-filled Vessel of Azhdeha, so shall it be done! ADDENDUM This treatise is offered as an exemplar and basis for the contemplative interpretation and ap-plication of all other formulae of the Crooked Path. The first seven offerings may be used as a contemplative form to support and develop the working of the Oracle Rite at each Dark Moon. When so employed additional offerings may be included; for example, an imaginal offering of boughs may be made during the Chant of the Eight Trees. It should also be realised that each specific section of the practice as a whole may be extracted from this present context and used separately as a distinct subject for meditative discipline. The main section, entitled SHUA, may thus be used in isolation; most suitably as a preparatory"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl?nomo6ia Draco'Taus exercise before any rite which necessitates the freedom of the tongue to voice the heart. It may thus be regarded as an exercise of especial devotion to the point of Al Shujah. With regular practice, the Shua Formula may be applied with great efficacy as a means for establishing a sphere of protection around the practitioner before any procedure of ritual or greater meditational discipline is begun. When this basic form has been practised and devel-oped with sufficient clarity to create a ninefold wheel of protection around the practitioner, a further application of its wisdom may be used to empower any of the fourteen centres of the Dragon-body:-One should begin at the ninth visualisation and place it at the outermost limit of perception. One should then work through the phases of the practice in reverse, moving inward with each visualisation toward the designated centre of the body. This process may be worked through for each of the fourteen dragon-points in succession; the primordial spark of the midnight-blue fire being moved in its inward focus from tongue to tail throughout the extent of the Seeker's form. For the empowerment of the Body, Speech and Mind this Treatise is here offered to all practitioners of these Mysteries.

Ye that have travelled beyond the Threshold of the Crooked Path, who have fulfilled the eight ordeals according to the hidden design of Serpent and Man, ye are now summoned to the Twin Gates of Twilight. Ye are now summoned to the Mystery of Sa! COMMENTARY: Opening the Way of Sa Within this domain lies the sacred pelt of the Hidden One, whose true form is never seen and yet is glimpsed upon all beasts. In the Mysterium of Sa let the Seeker of Wisdom behold the nature of the Antient Dragon as the origin and destination of all that has life. Here, within the infinite encompass of the Old One's coils, the immortal initiatic body shall be revealed as the primordial womb, the final grave, and the place of transcendence for every creature of fire, field, sky and sea. The Rite of the Turnskin marks the direction of the Crooked Path for those who have passed beyond the threshold of the Hu Rite and have thus arrived at the state of attainment glyphed by the Image of Qayin Hu-Azhaka, the progeny self-born from both Serpent and Man. This rite may be practised alone or in the blessed companie of the covine, yet ever in the true solitude of the sorcerous way. It is considered needful by Those who have attained upon this Path that anyone, whomso-ever, that desires to utilise the arcana of this rite must have passed through the previous eight ~86"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of GA tasks of the Crooked Way. For thus they will have attained unto the state of empowerment that is duly prepared for communion within these mysteries. In this rightful state of preparation the secrets of the Turnskin may be truly communicated and only thereby may such arcana be wholly integrated within the flesh of the Seeker as the Living Gnosis of the Dragon. The aspirant, having entered the ways of the Turnskin Child through the eight prerequi-site tasks, partakes of the Dragon-body as the Creature newly born of self-will: the living em-bodiment of sorcerous intent. Here the Path of the Self-begotten is shown as the Going-forth through the Double-way of Twilight. Here the ninth task is set before all! Let any who seek to utilise these arcana without heeding the counsel that has been given be most wise and discerning in their work, applying each revealed secret within the sanctity of their own observance of the Royal Arte. The Mystery of Sa is the second Rite of the Double-ouroboros to be celebrated within the cycle of the year. It should be worked in entirety upon the day of the vernal equinox, March 21st; this being known as the Dawn-quarter day of Sun, Earth and Season. Its composite arcana should be utilised in such time and place as is dictated by circumstance and the needs of the Ever-turning Path. According to custom the Spells of Sa are to be worked in the especial hours of twilight, by both dawn and dusk, by both Sun and Moon. PROCEDURE The Main Rite of Sa has the following tripartite procedure:-1) The Rites of the First Circle:-· The Summoning unto the Mystery of the Turnskin. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle, in accord with the Teachings of the Black Earth. Preparatory Addresses before the Threshold of the Second Circle: The Sounding of the Eight Knells. The Assumption of the First-born. The Address unto the Gate of Sa. 2) The Rites of the Second Circle:-Preparatory Address to the Skull of Cain. The Consecration of the Seven Offerings. The Fourteenfold Arcana of Sa. The Seal of the Pilgrimage. 3) The return unto the First Circle:-The Completion of the Mystery. The Theralia. The Blessing of the Dragon-Cross."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"G:rimorium 6_2nomo6ia Draco'Taus FORM AND FUNCTION The Mystery of Sa constitutes the enclavicle of the theriomantic and atavistic sorceries per-taining to the Crooked Path. Subsumed within its domain are the innumerable arcana of the Shape-changer's Arte. These secrets, many and diverse in their forms of expression and modes of attainment, unite within the single intent: the realisation of the Draconine Vessel as the transmutable body of all beasts. In fulfilling this intent there are many intertwined purposes hidden in the single task. The unifying function is to facilitate the self-awareness of the sorcerer as the Turn-skin; as the One unfettered by the flesh of man; as the Journey-man upon the Zo-diak of the Million-bodied Sphinx. The corpus of the Main Rite of Sa builds upon the foundation established in the Double-ou-roboric Mystery of Hu and reveals the consequent steps of the pilgrimage from the Crimson Interstice of Time to the Dawn-quarter station of the year: the Amber Portal of Time. Here, within the enclave of Sa, the two circles express anew the point and path of the Seeker. The first circle defines the point as the state of presence attained through the eight prerequisite ordeals and the second circle casts forth the path of transcendence. Both combine as the ninth ordeal of the Crooked Path. On first entrance to the Blood-acre of Sa the step of aspiration declares its return to the King-dom formerly enhallowed by the Mystickal Body of Qayin Hu-Azhaka. Within the first circle the practitioner must re-member the wayward course that has brought him hither and thereby know his Being as the self-born child of sorcery -as the very incarnation of the M ystickal Body of Attainment. Before him the second circle unfolds as the domain of his Becoming, as the hori-zon wherein the mysteries of his new-made nature shall be revealed. The Seeker must cast down the crown of Hu into the flames of the Blood-acre and there pass through, across the divide, into the Plot of the Untamed. There, in the Place of the Unfalling Stars, the Pantomorphia of Azhdeha is exacted upon the fourteen shrines of the Void-hewn Temple: the Antient Dragon is called forth as the Bearer and the Tearer of every mortal pelt. None but the True-born of the Elder Gods may pass this way. The Mystery of Sa casts the dual horizon wherein the many-faceted nature of the Turnskin is reified. The Main Rite operates as the unifying structure in which all aspects of theriomantic sorcery are interwoven to cohere a procedure of initiation, such as is required of the Wayfarer upon the Crooked Path. Here the aspirant passes through the pilgrimage of Sa to make mani-fest the ordained intent: the revelation of sorcerous entity as the theriomorphic body of power. Within the Spells of Sa no mortal beast is named, yet all are called forth by the cunning of enchantment. In its fullness of words and deeds, the Sa Rite partakes of many guises and is constituted by many formulae of Arte. One may wear but a single mask from amidst this grand array or yet one may wander through the many deviations of its entire procession. Both routes, when walked with a Mage's devotion, may impart the secret which the heart of Sa conceals. Here one may g,88"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"G:rimorium G~nomosia Draco'Taus In example of such gifts which the unseen hand of the path may bestow and in suggestion of all that may be deemed worthy of use in exacting the Spells of Sa, the following words are given in guidance: For the First Spell:-a stave of wood forked like unto the tongue of the serpent, a severed tongue from the corpse of a dog, the beaks of carrion-birds, all teeth, tusks and fangs -and even images thereof wrought of bone and poison'd thorn, and lastly the jaw-bone of an ass-for such didst serve as the first plough and as the murderous blade of Cain. For the Second Spell:-a hagstone to serve as the Eye of the Dreamer (such as is customarily held in a sorcerer's hand whilst sleeping to procure the sight of the Night-wanderer), a stone natu-rally graven with the image of a closed or half-opened eye, the blind left eye of a fallen beast, a chance-found fragment of mirror, a silver coin, and a scrying-bowl filled with water in which the full moon's light has been caught. For the Third Spell:-a hagstone to serves as the Eye of the Waker (such as is held in the sor-cerer's hand whilst conjuring or whilst travelling in search of power upon the leys of meadow and hill), a stone naturally graven with the image of an open eye, the blind right eye of a fallen beast, the mirrored surface of a dagger-blade, a golden coin, and a scrying-bowl filled with water in which the fire of the noontide sun has been quenched. For the Fourth Spell:-the skull of a serpent and of all such beasts as are favoured by the Seeker, a beggar's bowl fashioned from the skull of man, a graven image or mask of animal likeness, and lockets of hair from the mane of the spirit's steed. For the Fifth Spell:-the severed left horns of all fallen beasts, the left horn of a black He-goat, the sinistral antler of a seven-tined stag; and -if it may be obtained-the coulter-blade of a plough. This last offering should be graven with the Signs of the Seven Stars that shine in its heavenly likeness, elsewise let a bough or knife serve in its stead. For the Sixth Spell:-the severed right horns of all fallen beasts, the spiralling horn of a female antelope, the dextral antler of a seven-tined stag; and a sickle-blade, graven with the sigillae for the Seven Stars of the Hunter's sword, or elsewise a knife or bough imaged in its stead. For the Binding Spell of the Two Horns let the sinistral and dextral offerings be brought to-gether and crossed, even the images of the Plough and the Sickle. For the Seventh Spell:-a heart of man or beast, fresh-cut from the breast in offering to the Dragon-road; the cast-off skins of many snakes and the pelts of all such beasts as are favoured by the Seeker; the vertebrae of many creatures - threaded upon a cord in the likeness of the stretching path, and lastly, a coin wrapped in cobweb as a token of the hidden design. For the Eighth and Ninth Spells:-the left and right severed hands of all fallen beasts, all fleshly and skeletal forms of claw, talon and paw taken from life in sacrifice or by fateful end; a bough or root, grown or graven in the likeness of the chosen hand; the nails and hoof clippings from left and right forelegs, and -if such may be found - a stone that bears the likeness of an aged and outstretched finger. For the Tenth and Eleventh Spells:-the wings of bird and bat, the bones of the shoulder, even ~90"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of GA the fins of such beasts as live in river and sea; the feathers - plucked from the appropriate wings, sinistral or dextral - and tied together upon a wand of devotion or sewn together in the like-ness of a fan. For the Tenth Spell, the Seeker should favour the beasts of the daylight hours, and for the Eleventh Spell all such beasts that wake within the hours of the night. For the Binding Spell of the Two Wings an offering of eight black feathers and one peacock-feather is deemed appropriate. For the Twelfth Spell:-the sinistral femur-bone of a man, the bones from the left hindleg of all beasts, most especially of such creatures as do leap and dart in sudden gait; also all hooves and hoof-clippings, all claws and toe bones from the left backleg. For the Thirteenth Spell:-the femur-bone of a woman, the bones from the right hindleg of of all beasts, most especially of such creatures as do stalk, prowl and rush forth in stealth and in swiftness of pace; all hooves and hoof-clippings; all claws and toe-bones from the right backleg. For the Binding Spell of the Two Legs, let the femur-bones of man and woman (or the bone-trumpets belonging to a priest and priestess of the covine) be crossed upon the point of work-ing; thus to make the Sign of the Hidden Gait, Al Safaru'l-fana Sa. For the Fourteenth Spell:-a multitude of tail feathers from a peacock, the severed tail of a serpent, the stinging tails of all poisonous creatures, and the severed tails of such animals as do climb or hunt with speed, agility, grace and guile. The bestial relics which are employed upon the Dragon-points of Sa are firstly to be perceived as offerings, as the sacrificed parts of the communicant's own flesh: the physical vehicle of the Initiate given freely as a feast-gift to the Dragon. By the power of the rite's enchantments the divers offerings are transformed into talismanic repositories of atavistic numen and are accordingly perceived as fetish-objects for spirits and magical powers. It is thus, at the appropriate part of the ritual, that such objects may be re-collected by the offerant, thereafter to be used as amulets in the exercise of skills and powers received through the blessing of the Mystery. The visible objects of bone, feather and claw serve as mediation points for the transference of magical force. They are the 'hand and knife' through which the aspirant offers himself, the gateways through which he traverses the hid-den dominions of Sa-Azhaka and the gateways through which he returns. The re-gathering of the sacrificed bones is the re-membering of the initiate in the Perfected Body of the Turn skin. The Requisites of the Zeroth Point and the additional offerings of Sa For the Enchantment of the Zeroth Point a sevenfold sacrifice is to be made. In consideration of this and of all other offerings to be given throughout the rite, let the requisites of sacrifice be gathered thus:-The iron bit, leather reins and bridle of a horse, to serve as a sign of mediation between the Wild and Tame. Four horse-shoes, one for each initiate of the Quadriga."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"qrimorium 0)!nomofia Draco'Taus The sacred dagger of metal, for the breaking of the skin and the letting of blood. Eggs, for the appetite of the snake. Meat and bread, for the satiety of beasts and spirits alike. Offerings of Wortcunning, for the divers purposes of theriomancy: for trance and for spirit-flight; for luring, jading and halting. A servitor vessel containing water drawn from four rivers, co-mingled with the blood, urine and sexual fluids of the aspirant. The sacred powders of Arte: a red powder of coloured chalk and a white powder composed of flour; both to be mixed with bone-dust, earth, grain and salt, and mingled with the crushed leaves of all such herbs as befit the drawing-nigh and the charming of beasts. Incense and oils, chosen for their likeness unto the pungent spoor oflair and track. A single candle of seven hues, for the guiding light to lead the eye and lure the spirit. Four candles - black, red, white, and grey-for the Four Guardians of the Zeroth Point. Fourteen amber-hued candles for the Dragon-points of Sa, and also many other white candles for the illumination of the entire ritual domain. Thus let the Requisites be gathered-all as fetishes of bone, of pelt and of claw - for such shall bespeak the Dragon's nature unto the sorcerer's heart, such will reveal the Image of Azhdeha through the masque of all atavistic powers. In especial service to the Mysterium of Sa certain auspicious forms of ritual instrumentation may be made or obtained:-a flute carved from a thigh-bone, a bone-beaded rosary, and a form of Arthana carved of horn. This latter weapon, the Knife of Horn, is called 'Sa'kila', and is best used for piercing and marking the earth-signs on each point of the pilgrimage. The Coin of Sa For the fee of entrance to the Domain of Sa, let each candidate fashion a talismanic coin. This should be accomplished as part of one's self-preparation during the fourteen days of the moon prior to the ritual. The substance of the talisman should be taken from the impressed earth of an animal's footprint and mingled with the substance of Man; and thus, by divers means of art-istry, it shall be wrought to combine the natures of both Man and Beast -of Cain and his steed. Upon its surface let the dream-revealed signs of Sa be inscribed to augur the way that leads unto the Gate of this Mystery. Let the Seeker here pay heed and fashion well the Magical Disk to ensorcel and bind the Daemons and Genii of this rite. For the lam en of his own design will serve the Aspirant as the mirror wherein to behold the changing image of his own Being-the transformation wrought of his own enchantments.

Concerning the preliminary Earth-signs of the Mystery When all are prepared with the needful requisites of body, mind and soul, let the twin circles be cleansed and purified by the flail of thorn-boughs and the besom of many tines. At the centre of the second circle a large earthen mound should be formed. This should be built upon the ashes remaining from the fire in the sacrificial hearth of Hu. A candle of seven colours should be placed atop the mound, to be lit at the appointed time during the Sevenfold Offering of the Zeroth Point. At the threshold of the two circles, even upon the sinistral side of the Northern Gate, a shrine should be laid to receive the offering of the talismanic coins. The area of the shrine should be demarcated upon the ground by a circlet of leather, formed by the bridle and reins of a horse, or from a cord or rope in the likeness there-of.

The first, seventh and fourteenth spells should be recited by all. The recitation of all other spells should be allotted to the initiates of the Quadriga by turns. Thus, upon each point of the pilgrimage, one initiate shall function as the principal operant for the recitation and guidance of the en-chantment. At each node of the spiral pathway the initiates shall set down their vessels and the requisites of Arte. At the direction of the principal operant the covine will unite in the appropriate mantic chant. The specific earth-sign for the point should be traced upon the ground with bone-white powder and a candle lit there-upon to mark the focus of intent. The offerings of fetish and feast may then be given. When the area of the point has been enhallowed by the gestures of sigildry and sacrifice its spell should be recited by the appointed initiate, and thereby the covine shall go forth into the subtil aire and trance of the Dragon-point. Throughout the utterance of the spell the other communicants should maintain the mantic chant or sussurrate the words of the spell in the manner of an echo. The litanies of sorcerous kennings or 'Praise-names' in each spell may be extended if so desired; each initiate speaking new names as the spirit reveals them. When the magical work upon the point has been concluded a single line, an arc of blood-red powder, should be traced from its individual focus, backward from the base of the candle and into the central mound of the circle. This process is used to seal the empowerment for each of the fourteen Dragon-points (see illustration facing). The tracing of the Red Pathways denotes the constant turn and re-turn of the pilgrim from the Zeroth Point: the place of primal empowerment. As the Pathways merge they serve to re-veal the course of the four blood-rivers throughout the Body of the Land. As with all deeds, the principal operant of each point is responsible for the on-lay of the blood-sign. His turn and re-turn between the station of the covine's pilgrimage and the Zeroth Point signals the ebb and flow of inundation: the communion of the sorcerer's heart with the life-blood of Sa-Azhaka. In addition to the customary fourteen spells of the Dragon-body there are also binding for-mul~ for the five crossroad-points of the Eyes, Horns, Hands, Wings and Legs. When used, these spells are to be worked upon especial earth-signs which are traced out upon the mid-points between the nodes of the respective intersecting powers, even at the tridentate cross between the white and the red kamea (see illustration facing). The sacrament and mystery of all Spells should be partaken of by divers means of word and deed, specific and germane unto the manifold nature of the Dragon.

So Mote It Be! I THE PRACTICE OF SABA:-ITS METHOD AND MEANS In equipoise of mind and body establish Thyself before the Shrine of the Dragon, even within the enhallowed Kingdom of Qayin. When all is prepared aright, set and light a yellow candle atop the sacred vessel and entreat its flame using the Prayer of Saba. This enchantment pro-vides the basis of the practice and shall serve both to guide Thee and to define the stages of Thy progression. From the lumina, the inmost seed oflight perceived within the candle-flame, and from the yel-low hue of the waxen taper itself, expand a sphere of illumination to encompass Thyself and the Dragon's urn. Let the colour of the imaginal emanation be in accord with the hidden radiance of the season, waxing from deep orange-amber to clear bright saffron.

For the first seven days of its application the Practice of Saba should be used in isolation, as the central subject of one's meditative and ritual discipline. Once the essence of the practice has 339"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomoaia Draco'Taua been understood it should ideally be integrated with the practice of the Stellar Transvocation. This may be accomplished in the following manner:-After establishing the ritual domain via the praxis of Hallowing the Kingdom the Prayer of Saba should be used to open the way-to determine the direction of the Path's intent. Thereafter the main incantation from The Pact of Blood and Star-light should be recited in order to augment the realisation of Al Qaf Saba. In the place of the customary Stellar Spells the divers arcana of the Bha Rite should be utilised within the Transvocatory Practice, most especially the Sixteen Spells of the Witch-fathers and Witch-mothers. This permits the Saba Praxis to cohere all past attainments within the present realisation of the Dragon-body, to draw the future form-body emanations of the Path into its present point of focus, and also to establish a thorough prepara-tory discipline for the Rite of the Dragon's Horns. When utilised in conjunction with the Transvocation and the Sixteen Spells of the Bha Rite the Practice of Saba should be worked according to the cycle known as 'The Unified Count of the Witch-guard'. The 'Black' Count of the Witch-fathers and/or the 'Red' Count of the Witch-mothers may also be employed as cycles in which to integrate the various components of practice. The Tables of Correspondences detailing these cycles are appended to the main corpus of the Bha Arcana.

At all times, whether moving, working or resting, whether arising from or lying down to sleep, one should consider oneself to be the divine form of Qayin Sa-Azhaka, for such is the body of attainment as realised at the summation of the Sa Rite -the form of the practitioner who has undertaken all previous ordeals prior to the Praxis of Saba. To accentuate this realisation one should utilise the Enchantment entitled 'The Assumption of the First-born', together with the mantic formula -Saba-Azhaka-to indicate the direction of the Attainer's motivation. When eating or drinking, or when partaking in sensory perceptions of any kind -whether pleasant or unpleasant, one should consider that all is received as an offering to oneself per-ceived as the Image of the Initiator Qayin Sa-Azhaka. One should consider all deeds to be the acts of the Turns kin. Whenever thinking, speaking, or listening, one should consider all words and sounds to be as one with the mantic formula of Saba-Azhaka - to reveal its nature and secret teachings. When lying down to sleep one should consider that one is the body of the Initiator lying down within the seven-sided vault at the heart of the Sacred Mountain. In dreaming one should strive to arise in the Empowered Body of Attainment and thereby directly partake in the Visions of the Path. Finally, whenever walking, one should consider each step to partake in the pilgrimage toward the dual summit:-each step of the left foot to partake by way of the Instantaneous Path; each step of the right foot to partake by way of the Path of Gradual Progression.

The appearance of this Body to the Imaginal Eye should be bestowed through Dreaming and personal revelation, and should gain cohesion by the natural associations arising between the Body of Force, its atavistic powers, its revealed characteristics or faculties, and the zoomor-phic manifestations there-of.

From the midst of the Star, or shining from the middle of one's brow, a sigil-the Sign of Azh'run, the Shape-weaver - should then be projected in brilliant beams of saffron light. This opens the way to the Saffron Interstice of Time and purifies one in readiness for the next stage of the Path. As the sigil is projected the colour of the aura surrounding the assumed body of Qayin Sa-Azhaka should gradually change from deep orange-red amber to a clear bright yellow-gold saffron. As this kalic transition is accomplished the form and characteristics of the magical body, together with the given form of the Shape-weaver's Sign, may begin to transform. One's practice should be changed accordingly. The Sign of Azh'run is the Seal of the Practice and the Mark of the Consort Within. Through-out the entire season of this practice one may find it useful to mark this sigil upon the back of each hand, thus to act as a continual mnemonic to maintain the imaginal generation of oneself as the Body of the Turnskin.

In the Name of the Witch-fathers and Witch-mothers, so shall it be! Within the cycle of the sacred year the Mystery ofBha is the third Rite of the Double-ouroboros to be celebrated. The customary date of its exaction is May Eve, being the 30th of April: the sec-ond cross-quarter day of the year. By vertu of the chromatic arcana corresponding to the points of the ritual compass, it is known as 'The Rite of the Saffron Interstice'; for such is the hue of the kalic radix emanating from the mystical conclave of its empowerment. During the season of this Mystery, let the Dragon-vessel be adorned in a cloth of this colour and likewise let the subtle aire of the domiciliary shrine be pervaded with the imaginal projection of flavescent light. The Mystery ofBha is ideally to be worked in its complete form by the covine of four; elsewise let its divers formulae be used as is deemed appropriate by the solitary practitioner or the con-vened assembly. According to the ascription between hour and airt, the especial time for begin-ning the praxes of Bha lies between the hours of 7.30 AM and 10.30 AM. Thus, if circumstance permits, the covine should endeavour to commence the main rite during these hours, thereafter continuing in its labours for so long as is needful for the Mystery's whole and perfect exaction. Furthermore, the bright hours of mid-morning are considered to be the most fortuitous time for the various preparative exercises as undertaken during the days before the occasion of the main rite, likewise for the adjunctive application of the Bha rite's constituent arcana upon other occasions throughout the year. During all such operations the aspirant should call forth the powers ofBha-Azhaka from the airt of Volturnus, the South-eastern door of the circle. The initiates of the Quadriga aspiring to work the complete form of the rite, such as is given herein, should have passed through the nine previous ordeals of the path, even through the pre-paratory practice of 'Perceiving the Summit of Saba'. Let Those whom have thuswise attained step forward from the place of their present standing and here seek entry at the gate of the tenth ordeal - here to incline their hearts unto the Wisdom of Qayin Bha-Azhaka.

CONCERNING THE REQUISITES AND EARTH-SIGNS OF THE BHA RITE The four blood-rivers of the Primordial Isle well forth from the Mysterium of Sa, carrying the tides of atavistic force to take form in the Acre of Bha, thus to reveal the Land of Kahu as the Transformed Domain of all Living Flesh, even as the Kingdom of Exile prepared for the epiphany of the Faithful Gods - the Powers of Deity true unto the Path of Azhdeha. As the Rite of Sa reveals the shaping of the Isle of Enchantment and imparts the Gnosis whereby the Spirits of the Good Earth are called from the Caverns of Ancestry to take flesh in the divers array of all Living Creatures, so the Rite of Bha reveals the Pilgrimage of the Believing Mind: the heavenward ascent of consciousness to the one-pointed summit of Creation and the earth-ward descent of the initiatic power into the vessel of the Mage's Being. Thus the Gate of Bha is opened for the Coming-Forth of the Sorcerer's Gods, the entrance is made for the Attainer to the Non-dual Path of the Double-way. The Arcana of this Pilgrimage are firstly revealed in silence; constellated in the sigildry of our present ordeal, in both the earth-signs and the icons of Bha-Azhaka ... In this Mysterium the Double-ouroboros is demarcated in the customary manner, save that the ritual fence surrounding the Blood-acre here assumes its full form and array. As depicted below, the border of the First Circle is to be delimited by three lines. This signifies the three 351"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium G~nomosia D.raco'Taus moats - the three encirclements of essence - which surround the Primordial Mound of Al Qaf Saba. This triple demarcation of the ritual fence is the full form of the so-called 'Selion': the thorn-ring'd wasteland surrounding the World-field's Edge. This triune encirclement is the mystical limbus marking the borderland 'twixt the 'First Furrow', the perceptible limit of the World-field's body, and the Unknowable Beyond, the Place of the Last Furrow. The Last Fur-row is the Grave-lipp'd Womb of Azhaka, the Abode of the Dreams yet to be enfleshed. (This may initially be cognized as the space 'outside' the Blood-acre's perimeter, the region yet to be made manifest-brought 'inside' the circle. Given sufficient understanding this 'Domain of All-Otherness' is ritually figured as the Second Circle, the Compass of the Dreaming Body.). The edge of the selion's outer border is to be marked in the customary manner, using eight staves of wood-one at each of the cardinal and sub-cardinal stations. Smaller boughs of the same wood-types should be hung there-on for use as offerings during the appropriate stage of The Oracle Rite (see Temenos). The greater staves forming this outer fence, or hedge, are to be connected with a thread of saffron silk, thus to clearly mark the protective limit around the Acre of Qayin. Inside the 'thorn-ring' of eight staves, and within the lines of the outer border, it is deemed fitting, for the especial purpose of this Mystery, to place a great display of idols and worshipful imagery. For such denotes the lconostasis of the World's Belief. If so used by the covine, the chosen idols are to be laid out so as to completely surround the Circle of Presence, leaving but a narrow gate of entry in the North-east. The idols and effigies should be arrayed according to the Faiths of the World-each image being placed in an airt according to the direction of its native origin. The magical 'hedge' of stave and thread and the 'grand array' of the World's Belief complete the ordained form of the outermost border. Within the inner border of the First Circle sixteen small earth-signs are to be traced: eight 'T' or Tau crosses and eight X's or crossroad-signs. These form the basis for the greater sigildry of the Witch-guardians, the completion of which is to be accomplished during the formal exaction of the rite. The 'Tau' signs or Triple Crossroads form the basis for the sigildric shields of the Wise-blooded Mothers, the Convocation ofLiliya's brood. The X-signs are correspondingly the basis for the shields of the eight Cunning-fathers, the brethren of the Corpse-king Mahazhael. The Circle of Sixteen Signs forms the Compass of Empowerment for the Pantheon of Bha: the Conclave of the Faithful Gods. Upon each sign certain requisites may be laid out in preparation for the specific empowerments of each deity. The Seeker is here advised to study the ritual text and prepare the site accordingly. Furthermore, let candles and additional offerings be placed in the selion-border - for the blessings offered by Man shall mirror the blessings imparted by the Gods. Within the centre of the Blood-acre, the principal earth-sign depicts the four sacralised paths of ascent and descent to-and-from the Summit of the Isle. This is known as the Sign of the Four-towered Temple and comports the specific manifestation of Al Qaf Saba as the Ever-turning Castle upon the Hollow Hill: the Abode of the Chosen Gods. The Second Circle is to be demarcated with a single border. The earth-sign within reveals the Sign of Azhdeha, the Great Draconick Seal of the Crooked Path. This is traced so that the Tail of the Dragon points toward the far north of the ritual domain and the Tongue reaches forward to the border of the two circles. Fourteen points, each marked with a saffron candle, should be demarcated, as shown, in readiness for the Ritual Assumption of the Draconick Body. The adytum of this arcanum is depicted at the centre of the Second Circle as an inner conclave. This is the Voidful Portal of the Elder Gods and is intended to serve as the dimensionless apotheosis 35~"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"The Rite of B HA of the Sacred Mountain. This inner circle should be traced out and coloured in using blood-red powders, even with the ashen dust of all worldly sacrifice. Once this central region has been traced and consecrated, it is forbidden for anyone to step within its border or to place anything within its compass until the appointed juncture of the ceremony. Conversely, the centre of the Blood-acre should be raised by all hands of the covine, each adding bough and wreath to build the customary form of the pyre-mound. As is custom, the Magister's Stang should be envisaged to mark the Threshold between the Two Circles and at its sides, the two altars -the Shrines of the Womb and the Tomb - should be signified by either earth-sign or the symbolic arrangement of idol and offering. To either side of this dual gate to-and-from the hallow'd regions of Arte, let two pillars be raised. Let each be but a simple pole of wood, but of greater height than any mortal present. These two pillars denote the 'Horns' of the Rite: the Double-way of the Seeker's Attainment.

By applying the divers formul~ of their conjurations, whether in congregational or solitary practise, the body of the Seeker is opened to receive the visionary empowerments ofWitchblood's magical heredity. To the Wise and to the Those beloved of the Intercessor, the deities of Bha shall serve to embody the chang-ing stations of the Believing Mind, to both guide and protect the wayward course of our attain-ment through the iconostatic masquerade of all mortal faith. They are therefore to be called forth for the inner comprehension of all magical teachings and are to be revered in contempla-tive purity as the guardians overseeing the hidden transmission of our gnosis. The sixteen deities are attributed by pairs to the eight airts of the ritual compass. The especial sequence of their arrangement is based upon the traditional correspondence between the eight directions and the points of the Dragon-body (see Table of Correspondences). The conjurations and sigill~ of the sixteen guardians are herein revealed by vertu of oneiric and contemplative revelation. The rubric accompanying the text of the conjurations is primarily given for the usage of the Quadrigan covine. For other purposes, such as solitary contemplation and god-form assumption, the method of working should be adapted accordingly. Ritual Procedure for using the Grand Oratory of the Sixteen Conjurations within the Covine of Four The main body of the ritual text, as given within the following pages of the grimoire, expounds the grand oratorial recension of the Bha Rite. The basic rubric accompanying this complete form of the working procedure is given below. A secondary rubric, for the purpose of truncated workings, is also given - being appended beneath. Each spell is allotted to the charge of a specific initiate. This matter is ordained by the pattern of station and wardenship around the body of the circle. The order of this attribution between the sixteen spells and the four initiates of the covine is given, where appropriate, within the main rubric. The appointed initiate shall be deemed responsible for the exact method and manner"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium Gxnomo6ia D.raco'Taus used in the working of his or her allotted spell. The basic working procedure for each conjuration is as follows:-At the word or sign of the appointed initiate the covine shall turn toward the appropriate di-rection of the compass, such as resides beneath the auspices of the Witch-guardian to be sum-moned (see Table of Correspondences). All will genuflect and offer their prayers in silent devo-tion. The summoning shall thus begin in unspoken entreaty and by heart-felt prayer - even by the secret means of devotion that are mindfully enshrined within. When so directed by omen and inspiration, the appointed initiate shall begin the outward conjuration by reciting the spirit-name of the Witch-guardian. In accord with the officiant's example the covine shall unite in the name's utterance; each reaching forth from their hearts through its whispered incantation. The Deity of Bha shall thus be called forth by the covine to indwell the body of the appointed summoner. By this means the Sacred Retinue of the Mystery shall walk forth upon the earth, taking life within the flesh and blood of the Dragon's brood. The conjuration shall proceed thus:-1) The Sigaldric Shield of the Witch-guardian shall be traced within the border of the circle, thereby completing the sigil of foundation -an X or T-cross-such as was laid down within the selion during the preparation of the ritual site. 2) A candle of the appropriate colour shall be placed and lit upon the earth-sign, together with incense, oils and other offerings befitting the propitiation of the Summoned. 3) When deemed appropriate by outward augur or inward motivation the main text of the spell should be recited. The appointed initiate shall lead the incantation and the other brethren shall follow -in unison or by means of a mimetic susurrus. If so decided, the text of each spell may be divided - verse by verse - between the members of the Quadriga, so that the words of the spell revolve around the circle - beginning and ending with the principal officiant of the conjuration. The intent is to call the Deity into the body of the appointed summoner, that through the vehicle of Man the blessings of the Gods may be revealed. 4) Each spell has an especial cipher of gestures - a means of empowerment serving to com-municate the particular mystery of the Summoned Deity. The officiant of the spell shall exact such deeds according to the direction of the rubric and the guidance of the spirit. As dream and inspiration shall reveal anew, so let the empowerments be bestowed. s) When the words and deeds of a conjuration have been fulfilled the officiant shall seal the entrance of the Witch-guardian by the power of the sorcerer's cry. As these mysteries are exacted by the Magister's hand in the Place of Power, so let these matters be fulfilled by the Quadriga through the perfect rotation of the Circle ofBha. 366"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The :Rite of :B HA Secondary Rubric of Working Procedure, for use in truncated recensions of the Sixteen Conjurations For the purpose of working a shortened form of the Sixteen Conjurations the main body of their textual formulae should be laid aside during this part of the rite. The custom of an initiate being appointed as the officiant of a specific spell is maintained, but in the place of the written word the officiant shall speak forth his or her enchantment as the spirit so inspires. The respon-sibility for tracing the earth-sign and making the offerings upon a specific point remains the same as in the greater oratorial recension. It is deemed germane that the full textual enchantments be used by the participating initi-ates solely as preparatory material in the month preceding the main working of the rite -as the basis for daily contemplative and invocatory practise. The insight and knowledge borne from such preparation will serve to quicken mind, tongue and heart at the time of the main ritual. During the exaction of the main rite, it is found that in this manner of truncated working, it is best for all initiates to gather around the particular area of the selion wherein the officiant is leading the conjuration and for all to unite in the manner and method of conjuration as the of-ficiant directs; all conjoining in man tic orison, song, dance and visualisation as required. Thus, in like manner unto certain praxes of ritual pilgrimage, the covine shall move from shrine to shrine around the perimeter of the Blood-acre. The ordeals may be administered as the Witch-mothers and Fathers so direct their appointed ministers. The use of the ritual salute to signify the succession of power may be employed as deemed appropriate at the relevant intervals be-tween points of conjuration. Upon the first occasion of working the Bha Mystery it is wise for the complete and formal text to be observed. This creates the foundation of knowledge for the Quadriga and the basis of experiential wisdom through which congruent adaptations of the rite may be realised for future implementation. This counsel may be applied to all of the Great Rites of the Double-ouroboros. Here follows the Grand Oratorial Recension of the Sixteen Conjurations.

Concerning the Sorcerer's Salute and the Tools of Empowerment I -An Exemplar of the Salute: The Salute between the Powers of the North and the East The Northern Guardian should then turn to face the Eastern Guardian. Both will walk forward to the North-eastern station of the circle. There they shall bow and perform the Sorcerers' Salute:-Taking left hand in left hand and raising the clasp above their heads, both shall spin - offer-ing back unto back -and turning till once more face is unto face. On completing the turn the left hand clasp is broken. Then, taking right hand in right hand, they shall repeat the gesture in the opposite direction. When both withershins and deosil turns are accomplished, they shall stretch forth both hands toward each other, both crossed at the wrist. Holding hands -right hand to right hand and left hand to left hand - they shall thrice firmly shake the clasp betwixt them. This triple handskake hallows the point of their meeting. Thereafter, maintaining the clasp, they shall turn - pivoting as upon the place of the clasp - so that each exchanges place with the other and so that both are moved into the appointed places for the calling-forth of Lucifera and Tubalo-Lucifer. The dual grasp should then be released and bows exchanged. When the salute is com-plete, both should be standing at the sides of the North-eastern station in preparation for the next two conjurations of the rite. By means of the Sorcerers' Salute, the Northern Guardian -as the embodiment of Maha-zhael - raises the Eastern Guardian to the station ofLucifera, thus revealing the chain of initi-atic genealogy. As a final gesture, given in affirmation of the arcanum of heredity hidden within this deed, the Northern Guardian should pass the Graal-stone, or some token of its presence (see below), to the Eastern Guardian. If so desired the Graal-stone, or Smaragdina, may be passed from station to station, officiant to officiant, at other such times of succession during the course of the rite. The form and manner of the Sorcerers' Salute is used at similar junctures of the ritual proce-dure as that detailed above (such instances are stated clearly within the rubric). The Salute thus serves to reveal the succession of initiatory power from one officiant to the next and thereby display the catena of power from one station to another throughout the entire rotation of the Bha Circle. II -The Graal-stone and the Tools of Empowerment The Graal-stone is a visible embodiment of the Lumina, the initiatic jewel or spark of witch-fire transmitted-or 'fallen' - from the Point of the Golden Nail, the Dragon-star Al Thu'ban. In 374"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The Rite of BHA lore, the Graal-stone is called Al Zhakarah, the Smaragdina or Emerald Stone. It is said to be the ViridianJewel of Magical Wisdom, the Spiritual Diadem of Gnosis which is projected into Matter from the crowned brow of Lumiel-Azh'ra-il, the Peacock-angel, and whose reification in Man is signified by the Initiatory Mark of Cain. Falling earthward from the Celestial Guard-ian of the Crooked Path, the illumined keystone of Heaven becomes the fiery capstone of the World-mountain. The descent of the Smaragdina denotes the fall of the Draconick Light into the body of Man, or, conversely, the ascent of Man to the summit of Magical Creation. In hypos-tasis, the stone is carved-its primal radiance divided-into the divine weaponry of the Faith-ful Gods. Its mystical 'shards' or refractions thus become the 'sixty-four tools of cunning', the primordial instruments of the Mage's empowerment. These tools are visibly displayed unto the Aspirant within the Bha Conclave through the Contemplative Forms of the Witch-guardians and through their Gestures of Blessing and Teaching. The 'sixty-four means of empowerment' bestowed within the Bha Rite are later revealed in the Azure Interstice of the Draconick Year as the 'sixty-four hands' of the Passionate Retinue - the sixty-four modes or 'mystical postures' of the La Rite. Within the Bha cycle of its transmutations the adamantine stone reveals its final hypostate as the Cup of Miracles, the Aureate Graal from whence the stellar elixirs are poured from the Body of Heaven -as both nectar and poison unto the Children of Earth. When the divers forms of empowerment have been fully displayed unto 'mind, heart, and hand', the secret unity of the Smaragdina is communicated: the Arcanum of the Dragon-body's Forging is transmitted in the manifestation of the Grand Athanor, the Manifold Vessel of Great Transformations. For the ritual exaction of these Mysteries to be accomplished a stone, of sufficient integrity and vertu to transmit the Smaragdina's Power, should be located by the directive of omens. Such a stone should be selected from the skin of the world by the hand of the Quadriga's patron spirits, thus to serve as the visible sign of the invisible seed, even as the telesma of the Luciferian Flame. Likewise a cup should be chosen as a worthy vessel for the sacrament of the Smaragdina's Wine. And thus, in like manner, the other instruments of empowerment wielded by the Bha Retinue should be gathered unto the covine's embrace, even by the very revelation of the spirits' knowing. A Secret Gesture of Empowerment which may be used to affirm the Path of the Smaragdina through the Alchymic Cycle of Bha is the Passing-On of a pair of Bull's horns - elsewise a set of antlers or a fully horned skull - from point unto point, conjuration to conjuration. This deed shall reveal the form of the Hidden Lord of the Saffron Interstice and serve well to display the Pageant of the Dragon's Horns: the Double-way of the Lumina's Path. 375"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Taus 3 -THE CONJURATION OF YEMELOI LUCIFERA Sigil: Mantic Formula: I-HU-LUCIFERA Station of Summoning: Sinistral Side of the North-eastern Airt Officiant: Eastern Guardian O' Lucifera, Wise-blooded Mother of the North-eastern Airt, Guardian of the Left-hand Pillar at the Silvern Gate of Argestes, we bid Thee to hear us and to be here with us I Adoration we offer to Thee as the Fallen Queen of Heaven, for Thou dost lead the beauteous daughters of Earth in betrothal to the light of the Morning-star.

The Dream of the Sabbatic Convocation held at the dimensionless point of Al Zhakarah, the peak of Al Qaf Saba, is thus made manifest in the Kingdom of Qayin. The Seeker is hereby said to stand upon the pinnacle of the World-Mountain, upon the placeless zenith of its pyramidal capstone. This teaching is ritually cognized by the Leap of Al Zin Surat, wherein the initiate is momentarily poised above the fire - motionless upon the tip of the forge's upright blade oflight. The lnitiatic Be-ing is here conceived to reside upon the sole monad of reality - to indwell the hermitage of self-existence - whilst all around the Mountain-top the boundless ocean covers the land: the phenomenal realm of duality. The Seeker's path is the dance of perfect equipoise -of existential balance upon the singularity of the capstone's infinitesimal summit. This phase of the Crooked Path is therefore known as 'Dancing without motion upon the Capstone of Al Qaf Saba'. Its temporal span is the season of 'forty days' between the Rites ofBha and la, that is between 30th April and 7th June. During this time the nature of the unmoving dance is to be contemplated in solitary practice. For during the season ofBha-la the initiates of the Dragon's brood are said to dwell apart from the world of clay, exalted in unique attainment above the Domains of all Duality; each alone in the Hermitage atop the Smaragdine Skull-mound of the Faithful Gods. Thus, abiding in this time and place, the Arcane Formulae of the One-Pointed Dance shall be the focus of the Seeker's Path. The 'forty day' period of the Bha-la Practice is initially to be cognized as the mundane period of its discipline; esoterically, it is to be realised as the mysti-cal duration of time which must pass in order for the Dragon-star Al Thu'ban to attain perfect alignment unto the capstone's peak through the great perpendicular axis of the Column. This inner duration of the practice is comprised of the twenty-eight rays of the Moon and the twelve rays of the Sun. By the accomplishment of the Dance through the period of forty sessions of practice, or forty mundane days, the earthen pinnacle of attainment -the lnitiatic Entity of Azha-Qayin -is effused with the solar and lunar radiances of time, which, in union, open the upright stellar road ofla. In order to facilitate the Revealing of the Stellar Path one should, when drawing nigh unto the time of la by a season of some fourteen nights, integrate the Practice of Bha-la in subtil harmony with the formulae and spells of the Stellar Transvocation. By such means, the Dragon-s tar Thu'ban shall be drawn unto its prophesied location of alignment unto the earthen crown ofKahu. II Let this be the means and the method of the praxis:-Seated before the Dragon-vessel, a single candle burning upon its sealed peak, let the initiate visualise the vessel's form as the pyramidal capstone and his own being as poised above the very tip of the candle-flame. This is the basis of the meditation."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo6ia Draco'Taus By varying permutations of sensory alignment and mindful projection, the basic contempla-tive form should be transmuted to encompass perspectives of the Bha-Ia Arcanum as refracted through the compass of the whole ritual year. The incantations given below are offered as a guide for such an attainment, but should be adapted by each practitioner in the light of their direct experience -whether from dreams or meditative revelation. The practice is divided into three main parts, each allowing the basic form of the meditation to be perceived in a different manner. The first part establishes nine contemplative visions of the capstone and the Seeker's poise above it, each image being based upon a specific arcanum within the ritual year; the second establishes subtle forms of the dance according to the facets of the Dragon-body; and the third combines the two to exemplify further possibilities of the practice in application. In the first part of the practice, one should spend sufficient time on each phase of the medita-tion to stabilise the different forms in the imagination. Spirit-guardians may arise during these contemplative visions and should be communed with. In the second part, one should permit the mind to dart swiftly from one point of realisation to the next, grasping each cognitive es-sence without attachment. In the third part-The Wandering of Bha-Ia-the two previous modes are combined to engage the mind in new and greater expressions of the dance. Here the mind should be freed from constraint and permitted to move rapidly through images of the self poised in ascendancy. In each phase of the practice the focus of mind should periodically be returned to the foun-dation image of the self poised above the vessel's candle-flame; all visualisations and sensorial appearances of the dance should be offered as a gift to this point of origination. The meditation should be pursued until all forms of the imaginal dance are realised as the illusory play of Mind enjoying images ofltself moving upon the field of consciousness. Let the Seeker focus upon this realisation until the dance is All and the dancer is No-where. Each session of this practice should be opened and closed by the basic form of Hallowing the Kingdom, uniting all emanations of thought in the single point of the Dragon's flame. 418 The Enchantment ofBha-Ia: The Preliminary Address O' Dracotai, Vessel of Azhdeha, whose name is 'Face of the Void!'

Turn and turn again in this Dance, spinning upon the Point of Intent until the Mortal Flesh is overcome and is cast down into the World-field's embrace. As the flesh is made still upon the earth, so, in opposition, shall the soul be hurled into the vortical pathway of the spinning sky, even beyond the Place of the Golden Nail.

The Upright Path ofla A Preliminary Comment concerning the Rite of Al Thu'ban When the Dragon-star shine th in the zenith of heaven and its light doth hallow the vertex of the Smaragdina, then shall the Dragon~-brood convene for the Mystery whose name is la. BEYOND THE MANY numbered tasks of the Crooked Path, beyond the rays of the octrigan wheel, there is a mystery that has no number: a rite that lies beyond the circle of every season. Set at the timeless centre of the ceons, marking the celestial apotheosis of the Dragon-road, the unnumbered arcanum is enshrined in the Holy Rite of Al Thu'ban. This Mysterium of Arte is so named in honour of the Dragon-star, for when this most ven-erable luminary has ascended to shine in the very height of heaven, its beam is cast down to anoint the summit of the world-even as a crown of primordial gnosis to bless the Seeker's head. This alignment between heaven and earth creates the illumined axis of the upright path, the ladder of ascent and descent between the Star of the Golden Nail and the Capstone of the Sacred Mountain. Upon the axial pathway ofla, the twin alchymic processes of ascendant rarefaction and de-scendant reification attain a simultaneity of expression as the starward purification of the flesh and the earthward manifestation of the stellar flame; both are united to reveal the instanta-neous route of attainment. Herein lies the Gateless Gate, the liminal crack between the zenith and the nadir of existence. This is realised as the Narrowest Way, the spider's strand oflight that leads beyond the monad of one-pointed consciousness into the Voidful Well of the Elder Gods. The attainment of ingression to the upright path is expressed by the coetaneous elevation"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"<lrimorium G)?nomosia Draco'Taus of the initiate's mind toward the domains of the celestial wisdom and the incarnative fall of the stellar gnosis into the vehicle of matter. The sixteen principal deities of the Bha Retinue estab-lish the form-bodies of this arcanum and display its knowledge -as perpetually manifesting through the generations of initiation - via the symbolic embodiments of the Witch-fathers and Witch-mothers. \\Vi thin the Rite of Thu'ban, the duality of motion upon the upright path is revealed through the sidereal vehicula of the enfleshing Dragon and the rising Phoenix. These bodies of magical force unite as the deific medium for the starry radices of Draconis and are revealed in the Great Body of Sorcerous Power, the Peacock-Dragon-here revered in the name of Azh'ta'us. The Gate of Ia is the door which opens through the chosen moment of time and upon the chosen point of space; it is the way which leads beyond the omnipresent monad, the peak of Al Qaf Saba. As the fiery ladder between the summit of the mountain and the summit of the sky, the interstitial route of attainment is imaged as the road of ascension from the Blood-acre to the spaciousness of the heavens. The pilgrimage of the journeyman turns from the Secret Temples of Hu Saba and casts forth the vertical spirit-road toward the Starry Mansions set amid the aethyrs of the sky. With a single bound of exaltation -born from countless steps of task and trial - the soul shall enter the Celestial Palaces of Ia, each a royal shrine to a star of Draconis, each a bejewelled adytum for the sidereal wisdom of the Elder Gods. Here, in this Mysterium ofla, the pilgrimage of the Seeker toward the Dragon-star unites the Witches' Step and the Sorcerer's Leap at the Crossroads of Within and Beyond. At the midpoint of the leap the upright path is revealed as the sole route for the soul up and out - beyond the flesh and the manifest orders of time. Within the ambit of the Witches' Step the soul is cast from the selion-edge to the hearth-fire's centre, revealing the pilgrimage as the journey from the edge of every horizon to the universal focus of the Point-without-position. The Sorcerer's Leap and the Witches' Step meet in the Seeker's entrance to the Palace of the Dragon's innermost coil, for there the Master of the Crooked Path may attain to the Hidden Seat of the Dragon's Power: the Throne of the Innermost Height. According to the customs of our sacred lore, the Conclave of Ia may be entered by all and any that seek the Wisdom and Power of the Crooked Path. Its knowledge shall come readily to those that have fulfilled the ten ordeals that lead to the border of Bha-Ia, more so to those that have undertaken the nightly observance of the Pact 'twixt Blood and Starlight; yea, even more shall it be revealed to those that have walked within and beyond the circle of the year and the day. This rite may be worked alone or amongst the noble companie of the Serpent's brethren; its wisdom is given to each uniquely and alone. Therefore let each and all attain to this Magistry of la with the Blessing of the Unknown Mediator, whose Hand doth guide and serve all whom aspire to Gnosis upon this Ever-turning Way. The Occasion of the Rite's Celebration The Rite of Thu'ban abides in the Zeroth Mysterium of the Draconian Gnosis; it is both the ninth and the numberless Sabbatic Rite within the cycle of the initiatory year. It is said to lie simultaneously outside and within the circle of the eight sacred times, within and beyond the circle of the eightfold rite. The traditional date of its annual celebration is 7th June.

Working Procedure I -CELEBRATORY RECENSION It is customary for the day of the Thu'ban Rite to be marked during each ritual year as a cel-ebration of the Dragon-star's culmination. The two dates of Midwinter and June 7th are held to be the most auspicious in the cycle of the year and even during such years when the labours of the covine or isolate practitioner have forbade the working of other rites, the mystical com-munion of Thu'ban Day is always held. For such is the Hidden Tide of the year, when the step of the Dragon descends upon the world and the stellar pact of the brood is empowered anew. On certain occasions it may thus be deemed germane to employ a simplified recension of the ritual; in example of which the following summary of working procedure may be used:-The Thu'ban Rite is essentially comprised of the Oracle Rite, the Stellar Transvocation and the full corpus of the fourteen stellar spells. The Oracle Rite is used, as is customary, to establish the foundation of the Mystery within the first circle. The Charge to the Shadow is omitted and, in its place, the Enchantment of the Stellar Transvocation is used. This facilitates the assump-tion of the Dragon-body as the means to travel from the Blood-acre to the Stellar Regions of the Elder Gods, thus to cross from the first to the second circle. Within the second circle the labyrinthine path of the spiral pilgrimage is delineated, but in such a manner that the twelfth point - the point ofThu'ban - falls at the midpoint of the circle. Moving from point to point upon the spiral earth-sign, the Seeker indwells the fourteen celes-tial palaces of the Dragon and therein purifies his nature in the stellar radiance which informs the Crooked Path. Upon each point the method of purification is revealed by the utterance of the appropriate stellar spell and the immersion of consciousness in the veiled sentience of Azhdeha. If the full text of the stellar spells is not used, mantic chant and meditative formulae may be employed. As an additional support to the process of the pilgrimage, it is customary for a cord to be used to make a magical rosary. This is achieved by the Seeker tying a knot with the fulfilment of his working upon each successive point. The cord forms the Witches' Ladder of Ia, whereby the soul may ascend and descend at will.

The sixteen principal deities of the Bha Retinue estab-lish the form-bodies of this arcanum and display its knowledge -as perpetually manifesting through the generations of initiation - via the symbolic embodiments of the Witch-fathers and Witch-mothers. Within the Rite of Thu'ban, the duality of motion upon the upright path is revealed through the sidereal vehicula of the enfleshing Dragon and the rising Phoenix. These bodies of magical force unite as the deific medium for the starry radices of Draconis and are revealed in the Great Body of Sorcerous Power, the Peacock-Dragon - here revered in the name of Azh'ta'us. The Gate of Ia is the door which opens through the chosen moment of time and upon the chosen point of space; it is the way which leads beyond the omnipresent monad, the peak of Al Qaf Saba. As the fiery ladder between the summit of the mountain and the summit of the sky, the interstitial route of attainment is imaged as the road of ascension from the Blood-acre to the spaciousness of the heavens. The pilgrimage of the journeyman turns from the Secret Temples of Hu Saba and casts forth the vertical spirit-road toward the Starry Mansions set amid the aethyrs of the sky. With a single bound of exaltation -born from countless steps of task and trial - the soul shall enter the Celestial Palaces of la, each a royal shrine to a star of Draconis, each a bejewelled adytum for the sidereal wisdom of the Elder Gods. Here, in this Mysterium ofla, the pilgrimage of the Seeker toward the Dragon-star unites the Witches' Step and the Sorcerer's Leap at the Crossroads of Within and Beyond. At the midpoint of the leap the upright path is revealed as the sole route for the soul up and out - beyond the flesh and the manifest orders of time. Within the ambit of the Witches' Step the soul is cast from the selion-edge to the hearth-fire's centre, revealing the pilgrimage as the journey from the edge of every horizon to the universal focus of the Point-without-position. The Sorcerer's Leap and the Witches' Step meet in the Seeker's entrance to the Palace of the Dragon's innermost coil, for there the Master of the Crooked Path may attain to the Hidden Seat of the Dragon's Power: the Throne of the Innermost Height. According to the customs of our sacred lore, the Conclave of Ia may be entered by all and any that seek the Wisdom and Power of the Crooked Path. Its knowledge shall come readily to those that have fulfilled the ten ordeals that lead to the border ofBha-Ia, more so to those that have undertaken the nightly observance of the Pact 'twixt Blood and Starlight; yea, even more shall it be revealed to those that have walked within and beyond the circle of the year and the day. This rite may be worked alone or amongst the noble companie of the Serpent's brethren; its wisdom is given to each uniquely and alone. Therefore let each and all attain to this Magistry ofla with the Blessing of the Unknown Mediator, whose Hand doth guide and serve all whom aspire to Gnosis upon this Ever-turning Way. The Occasion of the Rite's Celebration The Rite of Thu'ban abides in the Zeroth Mysterium of the Draconian Gnosis; it is both the ninth and the numberless Sabbatic Rite within the cycle of the initiatory year. It is said to lie simultaneously outside and within the circle of the eight sacred times, within and beyond the circle of the eightfold rite.

This, in essence, encapsulates the basic procedure of the ritual; it should be adapted to the needs of the practitioner, with most especial regard to the function of the working as the point of cohesion and transmission for the stellar powers of the Draconian Arcana. II -THE GRAND ORATORIAL RECENSION The working procedure given below is for the full oratorial recension of the rite, the text of which is given in the following pages of the grimoire. As with the basic recension, it should be adapted according to the usage of the covine or solitary practitioner. The Great Rite of Thu'ban has the following tripartite structure:-1) The Rites of the First Circle:-The Summoning unto the Mystery ofla. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle (excluding the Charge and Address to the Shadow). The Arcanum of the Capstone. Initial Empowerment of the Phoenix Vessel. Preparatory Address to the Spirit of the Threshold. The Stellar Transvocation. 2) The Rites of the Second Circle:-The Crossing of the Threshold. The Assumption of the Four Stations. The Fourteenfold Arcana of the Stellar Spells and the Celebratory Address of Thu'ban's culmination. 3) The return unto the First Circle:-Close Transvocation. The Enchantments of the Phoenix Vessel. Chant of Consummation : Vagitus of Ia. Consummatory Address of the Rite. There are certain distinctions of procedure which characterise the full form of the ritual; these specifically comport the subtil arcana ofla relating to the Upright Path and to the magical ve-hicle of the Intercessor, known and reified as the Vessel of the Phoenix. A basic discourse relat-ing to the formation and nature of the Phoenix-vessel may be found within the section of the Exordia relating to the Requisites of Arte; further knowledge is given throughout the course of the Thu'ban Rite and within the various Teachings and Praxes ofla-Ra-Ku. With regard to the usage of the stellar spells, it is considered wise upon the first occasion of the rite's performance for the customary texts of the fourteen spells to be employed. This will serve to cohere and focus the knowledge which has been accumulated during the daily obser-vance of the transvocatory discipline. As one progresses further upon the path through many years of turning the wheel of the ritual year, it is wise to utilise the contemplative forms of the stellar spells, for these reveal and define the inner arcana of the fourteen points (examples of Contemplative Spells may be found in the IAI text).

As the Intercessor so reveals, so shall it be done. Concerning the Preliminary Earth-signs of the Mystery When all are prepared for the undertaking of this most arcane rite, being duly caparisoned in Mind, Body and Spirit, let the twin circles of the Dragon's Compass be likewise prepared. Let the Subtle Aire be perfumed with offerings of incense, the earthen site swept with besom and flail, and the tutelary spirits of the site entreated with prayers to watch and ward the rite. When all such acts of preparation have been attended to, the earth-signs should be laid down with the powders of Arte. Firstly, let the sign of the Double-ouroboros be marked, thus to de-marcate the border of the twain circles. Then shall the especial signs of this mystery be cast as depicted below:-The Rites of the First Circle Let the Mystery of Ia commence.

Those whom have passed through the Mysterium of Al Thu'ban and have therein fulfilled the initial consecration of the Phoenix-vessel should utilise the following praxes and formulae as the basis for the reception of the Sidereal Initiation of Ra. For upon the fourteen days between the Holy Rite of the Dragon-star and the forthcoming Rite of Ku, the fourteen stellar empowerments of the Phoenix shall hereby be transmitted to the initiate of the Crooked Path. Working Procedure Upon each day of this initiatory procedure let the Seeker be gathered before the Shrine of Azh'taus; and there, upon the altar of the Royal Arte, let the vessel of the Phoenix be placed before the Dragon-vessel - even in the ordained manner of symbolic location revealed within the Consummation of the Thu'ban Rite. Each session of the practice should commence with offerings of light and perfume; candles should be lit and incense used to thurify the vessels. Thereafter, in order to cast the circle of protection, the basic form of 'Hallowing the Kingdom' should be used. The praxis of Shua -'Opening the Mouth of Enchantment' - may also be employed to strengthen the aethyric sphere oflight about the place of working. When the circle of the nine rings and the ten directions has been cast and stabilised, the Phoenix-vessel should be opened and the specific enchantments appointed for the day should be worked through with due care and patience. All offerings of substance, essence and imaginal form should be made with honour and reverence. When the session of practice has been com-pleted, all thought, word and deed should be visualised as entering the mouth of the vessel -dissolving into the divine body of the Phoenix. When all has been so sacrificed, the vessel should be sealed and blessed with the words of the Sorcerer's Cry: 'Bilo Bilo Hu .. .la-Ra-Azha-Ka'. This utterance serves as a means of binding and perfecting the initiatory transmission. The Cycle of the Stellar Empowerments Upon the first day, the five charms of consecration - such as were used in the Thu'ban Rite -should be recited over the mouth of the vessel to reaffirm its initial empowerment. Meditative focus should thereafter be placed upon the fourteen points of the Stellar Convocation, even upon the knots tied in the cord of Ia. The arcana realised through the pilgrimage of Ia should be recapitulated, point by point, and mentally offered to the vessel. Upon the second day, the seven empowerments ofMilcham-i-Azh'rail (see below) should pro-vide the basis of practise. Especial meditative focus should be placed upon the visualised form of the Phoenix. Its force-body should be entreated to manifest within the sphere of inward vision. After contemplation, each revealed form should be mentally offered to the vessel. Upon the third to the seventh day, the seven empowerments of Milcham-i-Azh'rail shourcrbe maintained as the basis of practise. Upon this foundation the working procedure and method should be refined and developed in the light of direct oneiric transmission and contemplative 45~"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Rite of the :PhoenU!Ne66el revelation. Upon the seventh to the thirteenth day, the Seeker should engage in the dual practice ofla-Ra-Ku called 'Honing the Sword with the Light of Seven Stars' and 'Lustrating the Skull-bowl with the Seven Tinctures'. Upon the fourteenth day, the Phoenix-vessel shall be cast into the pyre of the Seven Stars and thus, through the completion of the Ku ordalium, the fourteen empowerments of the Stellar Lineage of Ia-Ra-Ku shall be deemed complete. The cycle prescribed above for the fourteen days is provided as the basis for the initiation and should be adapted according to the additional instructions which may be received by dream or by direct oral transmission. The Offerings to the Phoenix-vessel The primary offerings of essence made to the fetish-urn ofMilcham-i-Azh'rail are imaginative-ly generated forms, the visualisations projected from the Mind, together with the appropriate emanations from the subtil bodies of the practitioner. The primary offerings of substance are blood and psycho-sexual emissions, the life-blood and the menses or semen of the practitioner. Additional offerings depend solely upon individual predilection and are indications of one's unique and personal empowerment. Examples of additional offerings are:-sigils of desire, tal-ismans for wish-fulfilment, hexes for blessing or cursing, tokens of wort-cunning, seeds, stones, coins, feathers, bones, powders, and so forth. The Method and the Function It is taught that the aspirant who attains unto the capstone of the Sacred Mountain is called 'The Phoenix', for he stands at the threshold of the fiery starward path. The symbolic title signi-fies the state of the Seeker as the one who has risen above the duality of the causal realm - the flooded land-to stand upon the monad of one-pointed sentience -the primeval mound or Sacred Isle. His path, which is the perpetual return to the initiatory source, lies within and be-yond the point; this direction of the Seeker's path is outwardly imaged in both space and time. His course of attainment is spatially represented as the Moment-spanning, Upright Way to the Celestial Realms. Temporally, that is, within the season of fourteen days between Ia and Ku, it is represented as the flight of the soul over the land -the motion of consciousness during the 'time' of the stellar body's incarnation. This phase of the Dragon-road is glyphed as the four-teen days of the flood-tide's abatement and signifies the duration of the stellar empowerments' manifestation and the cognate period in which the 'land' or phenomenal body is realised in a new and purified form. The manifold and divers implicits of these arcana are cast throughout the magical formulae within the various rites and adjunctive praxes undertaken during this season of the year. The Phoenix-vessel is the fetish-point or catalyst used to augment and cohere the many aspects of this mystery.

The transmundane function of the vessel is to serve as the medianimic receptacle of the trans-mitted current and as the exterior focus for the astral form assumed by the initiate. As belief is given to the vessel in knowing, the self is diverted from the hidden processes of the transmut-ative empowerments and thus remains poised in the silent gnosis, the bliss of pure unknowing. The culminating sacrifice of the Phoenix-vessel in the ritual pyre of the Ku Mystery is the moment of self-transmutation and the unitive point of cohesion in the matrix of the stellar ar-cana. The true form of the Divine Assumption is realised solely in the ceremonial sacrifice and rebirth of the Seeker; the means to this end is transcended through its own function. Those wishing to utilise the Full Lunation Empowerment of the Phoenix are referred to the appropriate sections of the Exordia and thereafter should adapt the ritual texts of Ra and Ku accordingly. By such means one may align oneself to the Crooked Path and enter herein by the ordeal of the Swift Gate. THE SEVEN EMPOWERMENTS OF MILCHAM-1-AZH'RAIL 1 -The First Empowerment: the Generation of the Phoenix-body The primal empowerment is the generation of the Divine Body ofMilcham-i-Azh'rail:-Gazing inwardly, the aspirant should remember the image of the hearth-fire ofla. Within the luminous image of this remembrance, one should visualise the form of a giant, golden-feathered bird with two arms and a human face -of opposite sex to the practitioner. In its left hand is a long sword, its blade entwined with seven tongues of peacock-hued flame, and in its right hand is a skull-bowl. The sword is the means of the practice; the skull-bowl is identified with Gnosis of the Phoenix-vessel. An identity is also to be made between the sword and skull-bowl and the ritual implements of Arthana and Cup. The aureate bird should be perceived as being born from the flames of the hearth-fire, spread-ing its wings wider and wider as if to bear up the very stars of heaven. The generation of the Divine Phoenix-body from the remembered hearth-fire of the Stellar Convocation unites the vision of the past with the symbol of the future; this is the basis of the primal empowerment. 454 O' Milcham-i-Azh'rail, Phoenix of the Blackest Gold! Thy Sacred Body I entreat to manifest in the Shewstone of the Perfect Mind. Arise from the burning nest of Ia, the God of Light on the Primei•al Mound. Be Thou revealed to mine Eye as the Vision in the depths of the Lapis Smaragdina, as the Keeper of the Angles that open beyond. Thy form I envisage: the Fire-gilded Bird, born from the Dragon-star's pyre. Thy lucent-Jeather'd wings spread wide in majesty throughout the cosmos. Thou art the Resplendent Heart of Wisdom in the abyss of limitless space. Thou art the Summit-attainer amid the fractions of Time. O' Milcham-i-Azh 'rail!

All Hail to Thee, Thou Image born from Yesterday and Tomorrow. All Hail to Thee, O' Milcham-i-Azh'rail! Phoenix of the Blackest Gold! 2 -The Second Empowerment: The Black Feast of Purification When the Divine Body of the Phoenix has been wrought in mind, stabilised in the light of inter-nal vision and perceived as one with the opened fetish-urn, the Seeker should visualise a stream of black blood emanating from his heart and entering into the vessel - even unto the very heart of the Phoenix. This imaginal action establishes the transference of consciousness between the Seeker and the Body of Transmutation. O' Milcham-i-Azh 'rail! I offer unto Thee the black poisons of my being, that I may freely drink from Thee the nectars of Thy blissful nature. As one let us offer the sweet wines of our communion, that as one we may drink the elixirs of the Elder Gods. This visualisation should be maintained until the Seeker's blood-stream has dissolved entirely into the body of the Phoenix. The practitioner is purified by this empowerment and his flesh should be perceived as being of clear and flawless crystal. In receiving the offerings of black blood, the Phoenical Body absorbs and transmutes all into itself. As one the Mage and Image commune. 3 -The Third Empowerment: The White Feast of Purification Above the form of the Phoenix the sphere of the Sun should be visualised, shining as at the very noontide height of its power. The Phoenix should be entreated to raise its sword to pierce the heart of the Sun. A stream of white blood is then perceived to descend, falling from the wound-ed heart in the body of the Sun directly into the mouth of the Phoenix. This establishes the solar empowerment of the Divine Body. This imaginal offering should be continued until the Sun itself has grown smaller and smaller, its entirety being emptied into the Body of the Phoenix. 456 O' Milcham-i-Azh'rail! Lift Thou Thy blade to Heaven, seven times tongued with flame, there to cut open the heart of the Sun, that its lifeblood may flow into Thy mouth; thus to"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Rite of the PhoeniRNessel empower Thee as the A-f essenger Divine -the catalyst for the translation of the Seeker's Mind into the Circle of the Seven Stars. When this visualisation has been completed, the Seeker should imagine that the Divine Body of the Phoenix is enshrined within a burning pyre set at the base of his spine. The sunless sky above the Seeker should be perceived as being of pure dark space and there, within that space, seven points oflight should be seen to emerge from the void. 4-The Fourth Empowerment: the Transference of Mind through the Chromatic Refractions of the Phoenical Light Perceiving the Phoenix enshrined within him, the Seeker should entreat it to ascend to the circle of the seven stars in a series of emanated forms:-One by one, a bird of coloured fire should be seen to rise from the Phoenix's own heart and to ascend through the body of the practitioner -up through the crown of the head and out-ward - toward a stellar point in the zenith of heaven. As the bird ascends through the practi-tioner its flame should be perceived to illumine and purify the body, even to transform a facet of its nature and bear it upward to the Circle of Celestial Wisdom. The star to which the bird of coloured fire ascends should be seen as shining with an identical hue of light. The image of the bird should be seen to dissolve within the star and thereby to actuate the synastrian translation of the Seeker's consciousness. O' Mt'lcham-i-Azh 'rail!

O' Milcham-i-Azh'rail! With the Staff of Al Faqri I knock upon the doors of the Northern Sky; with the Hand of Self-pleasure I open the Southern Gate -the Scarlet Door of Al Qubbah-i-Hawwah. O' Milcham-i-Azh'rail! Manifest Thyself as the Golden-eyed Consort, that I may realise Thy Celestial Wisdom in the Body of Paradaisal Delight-that I may attain the union of Boundless Space and the Ekstasis of Flesh. Ia Ra-Kha/a. After the main exhortation the mantic formula 'Ia-Ra-Khala' should be continued in the man-ner of a chant, and should thus serve as a sublative focus of intent during eroto-aesthetic com-munion. As the mantic spell is thuswise repeated the pleasure-body emanations of the Phoenix should spontaneously arise in the imagination. Therewith one should conjoin in sexual union, uniting flesh unto flesh in blissful equipoise. The physical and psychical emissions of this Aga-pae are to be offered to the ritual cup and should accordingly be visualised entering the skull-bowl in the right hand of the primal divine image of the Phoenix. By such means it is considered that no vital fluid truly leaves the Body of the Seeker, but rather is placed in a magical hypostasis of entity - an arcane extension of Self, wherein all essence is subject to alchymic transformation prior to its astral resorption as the Sacrament of Gnosis. The 'Staff of Al Faqri' is the phallus and is perceived as the stave used to strike upon the seven hyperborean doors of the cosmos, the stellar gates of the North, from which the pleasure-bodies of the Phoenix will come forth to manifestation. 'Al Qubbah-i-Hawwah' signifies the vagina as 'the secret place of Life' and 'the lair of the woman-serpent'; as a celestial focus of the practice 458"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Rite of the :PhoenmNe66el it is identified with b Hydrus, a bright star of the Southern Pole and with the lightless sphere of the Dark Moon. 6 -The Sixth Empowerment: the Matricidal Feast of Ra When the blissful union between the pleasure-bodies of the Phoenix and the Seeker has at-tained fulfilment-either by mindful absorption between the fourteen secret centres or by car-nal satiation of the practitioner's desire -the emanated bodies of the coition are transformed into an offering to the vessel. The primal image of the Phoenix is therefore entreated to raise its sword and to sacrifice the pleasure-bodies which it has projected. The life-blood of the pleasure-bodies is visualised to fall within the skull-bowl and therein to mingle with the sexual emission of the Seeker. As aforesaid, the substance of all emissions should be gathered within the ritual cup, therein to distill and unify in readiness for offering unto the vessel. O' Milcham-i-Azh 'rail! Lift Thy sword to flay the Golden Skin of Pleasure's embodiments, that the seed and blood of coition may mingle in Thy vessel and therein be transmuted to the Living Wisdom of la-Ra-Ku. All mental images of the pleasure-bodies should be seen to dissolve within the skull-bowl of the primal image and therefrom be offered by the Divine Phoenix to the physical form of the vessel. All physical and psychical sexual effluvia resulting from the practice should here be offered from the ritual cup into the mouth of the fetish-urn. As the vessel is fed with the myriad offerings born from the sacrificed pleasure-bodies, so it receives great empowerment and bestows blessings upon its Maker. And as the vessel is fed, so shall the Divine Body of the Phoenix be seen to grow and expand, its form filling and surround-ing the physical form of the practitioner until both are perceived as one in alignment of mind, speech and action. 7 -The Seventh Empowerment: the Spirit-banquet and the Consummation of Ra It is considered that the potent act of union, achieved between the Phoenix and the Seeker through the vehicle of the blissful emanations, serves to attract a great retinue of gods, ances-tors and spirits. An innumerable crowd of entities should be visualised thronging and paying homage around the unified image of the Phoenix and the Seeker, forming ring upon ring of deific forms. To purify the matrix of perception, Man and Angel-Cain and Azh'rail as one in the Phoe-nix-body of Stellar Empowerment - shall wield the sevenfold flaming sword:-Taking up the Arthana in his left hand, the Seeker shall turn its blade throughout the entire company of entities, and as its razored edge touches each form, the body of that entity should be seen to transform into an offering of food. The field of gods and spirits is thus transformed into a feast-offering and should be seen to dissolve into the skull-bowl - even into the ritual cup of the Seeker. An offering of physical blood may here be made to the ritual cup. By this sacrifice it is considered that the illusory nature of such beings is annulled and that their powers are be-stowed as a blessing upon the Mage. 459"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Gl'imol'ium Gxnomo6ia Dl'aco'Taws Unified in the Divine Body called 'The Phoenix-child', the practitioner bears forth his Ar-thana and Cup as the Bloodied Knife and the Bloodied Graal in homage before the vessels of the Phoenix and the Dragon - even before the very mask and face of the arcanum.

It may also be worked, especially as an internal contemplative process, during the Di-gammic workings of the Marriage Rite at the end of each ritual year (see Addendum). Whosoever would practise this Twofold Teaching should pay heed to this counsel of time and suitably adapt its methods according to their own position within the course of the Dragon-wheel's turning. The form of the practice given within the following pages is expounded for use during the Transmission of the Stellar Empowerments within the Phoenix Rite, more specifically during the second week in the cycle of fourteen days between the Great Rites ofIA and KHU. . The practice should commence at noon upon the first appointed day with the working of the Zeroth Enchantment. Thereafter the Seven Enchantments should be worked one each day at midnight, beginning at midnight upon the first day and ending at midnight upon the seventh day. The Eighth Enchantment should be worked at noon upon the eighth day -prior to the working of the Khu Rite. N.B.-Being distinct in both form and method, the texts for the Zeroth and Eighth Enchant-ments are given in full. Betwixt these, only the text for the First Enchantment is given in com-pletion, this is to serve as an exemplar for the formulation of the Second to Seventh Enchant-ments. This manner of exposition is used in order to avoid an over-repetition of incantational texts and rubric which apply to each occasion of practice, differing only in points of symbolism and interpretation. It is the task of each aspirant to formulate the complete form of the Second to Seventh Enchantments for themselves, using the exemplar of the First Enchantment, to-gether with the given counsel and the appended Table of Correspondences. THE PREPARATION AND ASPIRATION Let the practitioner be seated before the domiliciary shrine and there, upon the altar, let the Dragon-vessel be duly appointed as the centremost object. When the practice is being under-taken in the season between IA and KHU, the Vessel of the Phoenix should stand before the Dragon-vessel, even as a mask before the Hidden Face of the Crooked Path.

Concentrating upon the ascendant emanation of the sword, one should use the incantation below to augment the development of the vision. 474"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"'Ihe Bloodied Knife and the Bloodied Q'.raal O' Holy Arthana!

By this Deed I open the First Gate within the Circle of the Never-setting Stars; I pierce the Empyrean Body to reveal the Star Al Danab al Daiajah. In the Field of Midnight I behold the Vision of Hu-Azhaka. The tip of the sword should be visualised piercing the star Deneb -(a Cygni). From the opened point of the stellar gateway an emanation of blood-red light should be seen to fall through the silver blade and immerse all awareness. Man tic formula of the stellar empowerment: AL DANAB HU-AZ,HAKA During this part of the practice, and whilst using the mantic formula, the sword should be absorbed into the stellar point, therein to abide in readiness - like the lightning-bolt of inspira-tion awaiting the moment for its descent. II -The Severing of the First Head: Consecration of the Skull-howl \\\\'ith the final exclamation of the man tic chant let the sword be visualised to fall earthward from the stellar point of Al Deneb, to descend and re-enter the mind from whence its form once arose. The blade should be seen to strike at one's own neck, severing one's head and thus begetting the form of the offering-bowl. One should accordingly contemplate the singular identity of the offering-bowl and one's own severed head. Residing in this meditation, one should perceive the bowl as an upturned skull formed of clear crystal, surrounded by an illimitable aura of glowing blood-red light. To develop this stage of the practice, the following incantation may be utilised. As the Infinite Sphere of the Void doth turn full-circle around me, so now do I turn the blade within, to sever the First Crowned Head of the Dragon. O' Al Danab Hu-Azhaka, by the stroke of the Moon-blessed blade of silver, Thou art felled to lie within the Earthen Circle as the Incarnadine Horizon of Al Manda! Hu.

Having made the offering of blood to the bowl, visualise its substance as the sacrificial out-pour-ing of all bodily fluids and as the especial offering of one's own eyes. In a manner and method like unto that of the Zeroth Enchantment, one should then proceed to meditate upon the deed as the offering of his awareness to the first head of the Dragon: the Conclave of the Hu Arcana. The Great Feast-offering I give for the sake of all Beings in the Conclave of Hu-Azha ... the gift of ceaselessly flowing blood I bestow to fill the veins of all flesh, the gift of my tears and all bodily fluids to sate the thirst of the Spirits, and the especial gift of my eyes to purify the Sight of All. 476"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"1he Bloodied Knife and the Bloodied GraaJ Let these offerings be drawn from my own body and be pour'd forth into the Graaf of a Thousand Miracles as the menstruum for the Turnskin s begetting.

Let each practitioner be most diligent in the accom-plishment of this task, heeding well the counsel of both the Visible and the Invisible Grammary. BASIC WORKING PROCEDURE o) Preliminaries: Upon each day let the praxis begin with the Oath, the Prostration, and the Summoning of the Invisible Host of Gods and Spirits. The preliminary deeds accomplished, let the Eye of Vision be opened to perceive the Point within the Sphere of Luminosity-transforming with each day to the appropriate hue in the prismatic scale. 1) The Assumption of the Arthana's Form: Attaining to the focus of sentience in the Point and Circle of Light, the body should be mind-fully transformed to the Mystical Form of the Holy Arthana. With each day let the sword arise in new substance, attaining the appropriate alchymic form to accomplish the skyward ascent to the Circle of the Great Year. Upon the second day, let the iron sword arise as the unity of every battle-blade, bloodied fang and tooth of predation. By the words of stellar empowerment - 'AL DERAMIN SA', let it as-cend to open the celestial gate of the Dragon's second revealed head. l:pon the third day, let the mercurial sword arise as the unity of every divine and victorious means serving to bear the powers of mortal belief -as one with the swiftness of thought and tilled with the assertion of all righteous faith. By the words of stellar empowerment-'AL KI-BLAH BA', let it ascend to open the celestial gate of the Dragon's third revealed head. l:pon the fourth day, let the brazen sword arise as the unity of every power which has asserted the birth-right of mortal man -as one with every weapon of will which has fought with trust in the sacred folly of destiny. By the words of stellar empowerment-'AL THU'BAN KU', let it ascend to open the celestial gate of the Dragon's fourth revealed head. l: pon the fifth day, let the copper sword arise as the unity of every weapon, instrument and power used for the propagation of the flesh and for the satiation of carnal pleasure -whether for lust, love, or for the sake of procreation.

Upon the seventh day, let the sword of white gold arise as the unity of every power and means striving to conquer Death. By the words of stellar empowerment -'N ASRUVAKA HUA' - let it ascend to open the celestial gate of the Dragon's seventh revealed head. 2) The Severing of the Head: the Consecration of the Skull-bowl: When the sword has arisen and attained absorption into the point of stellar focus, let it be sensed as the unborn lightning of a storm - brooding at the threshold of earthward descent. Filled with the radiance of its guardian star, the sword should be perceived to fall-to re-enter the mind from whence it arose. By this deed, the sword shall strike at the aspirant's neck and, each day anew, shall sever his head. The vision of the severed head should be unified with the physical presence of the offering-bowl; by such means the Graal shall be perceived as the up-turned skull: the manifest vehicle of the Draconick sentience fallen to the F initor of the Earthen Domain. Upon the second day the severed head shall beget the Skull-bowl of Ruby, surrounded with the amber fires of Sa.

(Mantra= HUA IA DRAKU SABATALA HU HUA RAKA) 3) The Lustration of the Skull-bowl: The cup or bowl being mindfully transformed into the reificatory vehicle for one of the Seven Minds of Gnosis, the aspirant should take up the ritual dagger - touch its tip to the candle-flame and instantly realise it to be one with the Sword of Ka-i'ra - and therewith should make an offering of blood unto the Graal. Having made the offering of blood to the Graal, the aspirant should meditate upon his offering 480"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"The Bloodied Knife and the Bloodied qraaJ and mindfully transform its substance into the Sacrificial Feast appropriate to the day. By this means the offering of blood shall become the gift of the aspirant's entire body unto all the gods, spirits and beings within the Conclaves of the Draconick Circle. One should imagine that the Feast is bestowed upon the entities in the appropriate realm and that each being is nourished and perfected thereby - in readiness for the Greater Feast to come. Upon the second day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of brain-flesh, hair and marrow: the Amber Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of Sa. Upon the third day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of bones and sinew: the Saffron Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of Ba. Upon the fourth day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of the heart and its blood, together with one's skin and vertebrae: the Verdant Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of Ku. Upon the fifth day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of one's hands, arms, fat, semen or menses: the Azure Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of La. Upon the sixth day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of one's flesh and muscle stripped from the bone: the Indigo Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of Tan. Upon the seventh day let the offering be perceived as the Sacrificial Feast of one's legs and feet: the Purple Feast of Poisons given to all entity in the Conclave of Hua. 4) The Tempering of the Sword: Having completed the meditative transformation of the bowl and its contents, one should turn one's attention to the Arthana. In accord with the directions and incantations given in the Ze-roth Enchantment, one should hold the dagger in both hands and touch it once more to the candle-flame. In so doing, one should mindfully envisage that its entire form is afire with the appropriate radiance of Time and is being tempered by one's intent at the mystical centre of the Earthen Circle. 5) The Quenching of the Blade The fire-heated dagger should now be used to stir the contents of the offering bowl or cup. This should be accomplished by fourteen withershins or 'star-wise' churnings of the Feast-offering l't'ith the glowing tip of the Arthana. By this deed one should imagine that the offering is trans-formed into the sidereal menstruum of the Dragon. 6) The Consecration of the Body with the Wine of the Graal Once the Arthana has been fully quenched in the contents of the bowl, the envenomed tip of its blade is used to anoint different zones of the body and thus transmit the sidereal numen directly into the vehicle of the Seeker's flesh.

The reificatory path of the celestial serpent's descent is hereby cast forth through the spine of Man, opening the gates into the 'seven jewelled cities' and thus unveiling the Visions of the Great Minds of Gnosis unto the All-seeing Eye of Revelation. On the second day let the iron blade anoint the blessing-point and axial location at the centre of the brow. Let the dual gateway be opened into the City of the lnitiatic Mind-the Timeless Domain of Thought to Thought Alignment between the Seeker and Qayin Azhaka. On the third day let the mercurial blade anoint the blessing-points at the left and right sides of the brow, and also at the left and right horns of the womb. Thereafter let the axial location of the throat be blessed-to open the gate into the City of Perpetual Prayer, whose walls are guarded on every side with the Musick of the Nine Conclaves of Time. On the fourth day let the brazen blade anoint the blessing-point and axial location at the heart. Let the gate be opened into the City of the Seven-rayed Sun, whose outer precincts are gar-landed with the hearts of gods and men, laid in offering upon a million flayed skins and all be-wreathed with chains of crystal vertebr~. On the fifth day let the copper blade anoint the blessing-points of the hands, elbows and shoul-ders. Thereafter let the axial location of the navel be consecrated -thus to open the gate into the City of Adoration, whose walls are disguised by the Thousand Mirrors of Outward Appearance. On the sixth day let the leaden blade anoint the blessing-points of the left and the right shoulder-blades. Thereafter let the axial location of the secret place 'twixt navel and coccyx be blessed-thus to open the gate into the City of the Endless Banquet, whose precincts are filled with the continual funeral-feasts of all living. On the seventh day let the blade of white gold anoint the blessing-points of the thighs, knees and feet for both the right and left legs. Thereafter let the axial location of the coccyx-the root of the spine-be blessed; thus to open the gate into the City of the Revenant,-the Necropolis whose walls are garlanded with the rotting sloughs of every corpse and fallen beast, and yet are as sweet unto the sense of smell as a thousand wreaths of nectareous flowers. 7) The Consummation When the bodily zones have been blessed and anointed, the practitioner should call forth the Sovereign lnitiatic Power of the Named Star - to simultaneously arise from within the flesh and to come forth from beyond the sidereal light of heaven, both as one to enter and empower the Seeker's being. When this has been accomplished, albeit in a fleeting moment of realisation, the practice should be steadily concluded,-all offerings of mind and matter should be given unto the focus of the rite; all as one should be returned to the point of primal empowerment.

As the heptad-the Seven Virgins in the Field of Night-this stellar group may be used an analogue to the Great Circle of Stars forming the Heptanomis of the Khu Rite. In terms of arcana relating to Lili ya, they may be seen as stellar corrollaries of the seven goddesses attendant upon Her as the Corpse-queen in the Bha Rite. The foremost luminary of this group, a star which may be utilised as a focus in rites venera-tive of the Draconick Skull as the Conclave of Mind, is Alcyone -Al Na'ir, 'the Bright' or 'Pierc-ing One'. This star is also called Thaur al Thurayya: the Bull leading the Many. This epithet may be interpreted to signify the Point of Unity from whence the 'Numbers' or 'Fractions of Time' emanate, and may also be seen to denote the Mind as the Governor of the Sensorial Body - the Multitude. Also, in terms relating to Mahazhael, Thaur al Thura;ya may be understood as a name of Horned One, the Bull-masked Magister who leads the retinue of the Faithful Gods. From these various interpretations it may be seen that the Pleiades - as the Behenian ana-logue of Al Halka - can reveal certain 'directions of mystical comprehension' relating to the Mysteries of both the Witch-mothers and the Cunning-Fathers. These subtle implicits are drawn out further in the Arcana of the Two Horns. V) The fifth point of the Dragon-body, the Left Horn Al Tat~•, is aligned unto the star Al Deba-ran, the 'Follower'. This epithet indicates its position as a follower of the Pleiades and thus, by the interpretation given above, Al Debaran may be used to signify the body of senses which is led and honed by the activity of Mind. This interpretation also bears upon the body physical as the Bearer of the Lineal or Progressive Path through time. As the principal star in the constellation Taurus, Aldebaran, is revered as 'the Eye of the Bull': the portal for the visionary powers of Horned One. It is also known as 'The Maker of the Fur-row of Heaven' and thus relates to the left horn of the Dragon as the Plough-blade. The Bull may here be interpreted as a bestial embodiment of the Witch-king, as the Fire-horned God of the North self-transformed into the Wild Ass, the Unridden Beast braying in the desert. This skin-shifting depicts the emanation of the Lord Azh'modai, Presiding Lord ofthe Bha Rite, from the left brow of Mahazhael, the Sovereign Lord of the Witch-fathers. VI) The sixth point of the Dragon-body, the Right Horn -Al Sa'eqah, is aligned unto the white star known as Hircus, the Goat-star. More specifically, this star is called Capella, meaning 'The 49°"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"She-goat', and thus directly corresponding to the hircine form assumed by Liliya as Azh'terah Saba, the Lightning-horned Goddess of Bha. This luminary is also called Cornu Copia -the Horn of Plenty, indicating the nature of Azh'terah's power to bestow fecundity and nurture to those beneath Her auspices. Petitions and supplications rendered unto the sixth Dragon-point may be directed toward this pallid star, yet know that of old it has been associated with the forces of the heavenly storm, and thus with the very bolts oflightning which fly therefrom. In times when intervention is needed, let prayers and incense be burned unto the Goat-star. For thus shall the fiery spears of chance be drawn down -to pierce the ways of Order and Fate. Vil) The seventh point of the Dragon-body, the triune zone of Al La'ta'ifa-'the heart, hide and bone of Azhdeha', is aligned unto the brightest star of the night-sky: a Canis Major, more often known as Sirius, the Dog-star. This star, being visible in both the North and South accord-ing to its seasons, and being perceived with the naked eye to shine with the seven hues of the spectrum, is a fitting luminary to serve as a focus for the Enchantments of the Gnosis Entire. For Those Journeymen of the Way unto whom Draconis is hidden, this star is commended as a worthy point in the heavens upon which to rotate the Wheel of these Mysteries. For is it not known as 'The Heart-star', the threefold orb of Sept! As the principal star in the constellation Canis Major - the Great Dog, Sirius or Sothis can be invoked as Al Kalb al Kabil, the Dog of Cain. In this form it may be revered as the triple-headed dog of bloody coat and claw: the wild and cunning fox, the ally of the Exiled. As the thrice-faced dog of Cain, the Old Trivagant God of Witcherie, Sirius may be imaged as the Watchful Guardian who wards the entrance to the Tridentate Path of the Draconick Spine, who keeps and protects the Way of the Upright Bridge-the Road-beyond-Time which leads up and out from the meeting-place of Past, Present and Future. Rising bright on Albion's autumnal horizon, this star is a Sign of Blessing, a Portent of the Inner Illumination born from the Cursed Rite of Al Tan. As this luminary ascends in the Season of the Shadow's Empowerment, Tan-Azh-Hua, its glinting orb may be revered as the Very Eye of Azh'taus: the Oracle-gaze of the Pavonine Seraph, shining seven-rayed to open the Midnight Way. ,. I I I) The eighth point of the Dragon-body, the Sinistral Claw -Al Dhi'ban, is aligned unto the Behenian star Procyon, the principal star of Canis Minor. By vertu of the customary attribution of the eighth point to Liliya as the Queen of the Dead, and by the cognate association of the star unto a canine form, this luminary may be considered to represent the dark, backward-reaching hand of the Ancestress, shifting likeness with its deathwise gesture to become the black claw of the She-hound. Here again, we may perceive the star to assume significance as a point of emana-tion for Cain's atavistic totem: the wild and tameless dog of black and bloodied claw. Through propitiation, the powers of this star may be called upon to turn the outward skin of the Seeker, to beget the transformation of Man into the pallid She-hound, the Haunter upon the moon-slaked roads of the Spiritous Processions. IX) The ninth point of the Dragon-body, the Dextral Claw-A/ Auhakan, is aligned unto the principal star of Leo: Regulus, Cor Leonis -'the Heart of the Lion'. In contradistinction to the Behenian analogue of the Left Claw and its canine form, the Right Claw assumes a leonine as-pect. Here we may perceive the outreach of the Dragon-body as the red and ruddy paw of the Royal Lion, stretching out five-clawed from the World of Presence into the Unmapp'd Regions of Futurity. Going forth into the World of Becoming upon the Via Behenu - the Road of the Root-stars - the Witch-king Mahazhael assumes the theriomorphic body of the Great Cat, the 491"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Grimorium G2nomoaia Draco'Taua Prowler in the Deserts of the Unbegotten. He becomes Malikiyya, the Kingly One, who strives ever forward into the barren realms of the Earth, to the unruled places of possibility which await the fecund impress of his passing, and thus the patterning of Form and Direction which He bestows. x) The tenth point of the Dragon-body, the Left Wing-Al Boracan, is aligned unto the bright star in the North calledAlcaid, -being known as Cauda Ursae, the Tail of the Great Bear. Ursa Major - the Great Bear, the constellation to which this star belongs, has numerous meanings in the context of Draconian and Sabbatic Mysteries. As a group of seven stars it is di-rectly analogous to the Heptanomis of the Khu Rite (see Table of Correspondences) and may be utilised as a stellar region of votive significance in all manner of rites deriving from the complex there-of. As the Plough, this constellation may be interpreted as the Coulter-blade, the divine weapon of Cain. Here it may be seen as the celestial barrier, the whirling sword, which guards the region of the Heptanomis. As the Wain, Carl's Wain - the Wagon of the King, it may be interpreted as the chariot which bears the Witch-master Mahazhael around the Circle of the Never-setting Stars in the North. Ursa Major is also known as 'The Funeral Bier', and in this context may be seen as the Bearer of the Sacrificed Body of the Seeker-as the Great Coffin of Habil, the Profaner, who is cast down 'neath the blade of his brother Cain or Kabil. This latter interpretation bears upon the specific star in question: Alcaid. Alcaid, as the chief star of Ursa Major, possesses the full name Al Ka 'id Banat al Na'ash, mean-ing 'The Governor of the Daughters, the Chief of the Mourners'. In this context, Alcaid may be understood to represent Azh'run, as the Sister of the Slain One, the Chief of the Sisters or Witch-mothers who mourn his death. Yet it must be remembered that Azh'run is also the Bride and Sister of Kabil, who is the First Magician, the Victor over Profanity. As the Bride of Cain - the Self-Transmuted One, She is the Secret Up-raiser of Habil in the season of Hua, the hour of final resurrection. For the shedding of Her and Her Sisters' tears upon the place of burial - the seasonal falling of stellar dews upon the earth - cause the downcast substance of the Profaner to alchymically transform - to be redeemed from exile and thus be worthy of ascent - to be born anew as the Revenant Qinaya Habil-Zhiva: the Begetter of Qayin at the End of all Days. Thus the Fallen One comes forth anew at the Threshold of Ka, once more to meet his appointed bride: the Serpent-woman Calmena-Azh'run. These arcana, here summarised, are revealed through the course of the Great Rites. As the analogue of the Upraised Wing of Azhdeha, Alcaid is wisely understood as 'The Guardian of all that turns to the North' -as the Sword-feather'd Wing which whirls in Heav-en's height, protecting the Gateway to the Empyreal Palaces of Ia-Kahu. XI) The eleventh point of the Dragon-body, the Right Wing-Al Dhih, is aligned unto the star Ala Corvi-(6 Corvus). This star is upon the right wing of the sidereal raven and may be inter-preted as the Shadow-wing, the hellward flying one Al Ghorab. In this we may perceive a direct correlation between the customary attribution of Al Dhih and its Behenian analogue. The star Ala Corvi may be understood as a celestial point of focus for any magical operations involving the Body of Shadow. Let candles and incense be burned there-to, thus to propitiate the powers of the Umbrose Flesh: the Djinn of S'kia, the Shadow-winged Diver in the Abyssal Waters of Ka. Whosoever turneth from within the Circle of the Dragon-stars to face outward upon the Boundary of the Behenian Stars, let them regard the subtil attribution of ~heir steps. For in so 49~"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"turning, the sinistral step of the Witch-king upon the point of Al Thu'ban shall become as the fecund step of the Witch-queen upon the root-star of Spica. And there-from shall flow forth the starry nectars of the moon's river - being of many tides, known and unknown, seen and unseen. Likewise in so turning, the dextral step of the Witch-queen upon the point of Al Qadam shall become as the fatal step of the Witch-king upon the root-star of Arcturus and therefrom shall issue the outward spate of luminescent seed, thus to fall. .. even unto the earthen field of flesh. XII) The twelfth point of the Dragon-body, the Left Leg-A/ Thu'ban, is aligned unto the Be-henian star Spica-(a Virgo). This star reverses the customary ascription of gender attributes for the twelfth point: the powers of the witch-king are transferred to the Witch-queen; from sun unto moon. Spica is also known as 'The Virgin's Spike' and represents the ear of wheat-the stave of many grains - held in the hand of the Maiden, Virgo. Here we may interpret the Spike as the magical stave which bears the fruits of the year, the bounty of time's circle, and which sheds its grains as the kalas or stellar radiances of the Witch-queen. Virgo, in this context, may be seen as a whole to be a celestial image of the Maiden Witch-mother Na'amah, or as the Chief of the Daughters, Calmena. As 'the Spike' we may also interpret Spica as the Nowl form of the Arthana, as the Nail which impales the Land under the auspices of the Dragon's sinistral gait. An alternative title, Al Khoritos -'the Solitary', compounds this interpretation. XIII) The thirteenth point of the Dragon-body, the Right Leg-Al Qadam, is aligned unto the star known as Arcturus-(a Bootes). Here again the gender ascriptions are reversed; this point now becoming a vehicle for the powers of the Witch-king. Another name of Arcturus is Al Si-mak al Rimah -interpreted as 'the Leg of the Lance-bearer'. Here the Lance may be understood co be the Phallus and its Bearer to be Mahazhael. Arcturus, owing to its position far outside the solar zodiac, has gained the title 'The Outcast'. This may be perceived to indicate Cain as the eternal wanderer in exile. As a correlative of Al Qadam, we may thus interpret Arcturus as a luminary worthy of veneration in rites devoted unto Cain and to the Grand Witch-father Mahazhael-He who out-casts the seed of the solar houses. XIV) The fourteenth point of the Dragon-body, the Tail-A/ Ghauzar, is aligned unto the star Elpheia or Alphecca -(a Corona Borealis). This star is know as 'the Bright One of the Dish' and may be seen as a sidereal eidola for the Cup, the Bloodied Graal filled with the nectars and poisons of Heaven. It may be interpreted as a point worthy of veneration in rites wherein the tinctures are drawn from the envenom'd tail of the Dragon - from the Phallus, or from the nectareous cup - the kteis. In this point the fourteen ways are focus'd and distilled; herein the ~ntessence is revealed. 493"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"<lrimorium G)!nomosia Draco'Taus TABLE OF STARS, DRACONIAN AND BEHENIAN DRAGON POINT OF STAR-NAMES BEHENIAN STAR NAMES AND EPITHETS POINT DRACONIS OF BEllENIAN STAR Tongue 13 Al Shujah Caput Algol: Ra's al Ghul: the Demon's Head. 13 Perseus Asuia al Ghul.

These are Antares -Cor Scorpi-the Heart of the Scorpion, Vega -Vultur Cadens-the Falling Vulture, and Deneb -Cauda Capricorni -the Tail of the Goat. Verily, these stars are as the three envenomed points of the Trident emanating from the Dragon's Tail. In each point of this baneful triad, ye may behold the Mysteries of the Col-umn stretching betwixt the Empyrean Heights, the All-present Centre of Being and the Abyssal Deep of the Under-realm. Verily, from the Star Elpheia, the Bright One of the Dish, shall come forth the tinctures of the Bloodied Graal to lustrate the barbs of the tridentate stave. The Tail of the Goat shall be as the Central Pillar of the Trident's Blade.

For amidst these root-stars are bodies oflight most notable within the Stellar Arcana of Crooked Path Sorcery. These illuminant bodies are namely Vultur Cadens or Vega (a L)ra) and Elpheia (a Corona Borealis). These are, by our custom, ascribed unto certain radices of the Heptanomis. Verily, they are counted amongst the seven heads of the Dragon. Therefore it is most fitting that the Arcana of the Behenian Circle be employed at such a time when the Crowns of the Dragon-sorcerer have been cast earthward from their stations of celestial exalta-tion; likewise they are deemed efficacious in the season betwixt the rite of Hua and the Consum-mation of the Hieros Di-gamos. For verily, when the seven stars and the seven earths have been sacrificed, then shall the Radiant Shadow of Azhaka -as the Spectre of the Falling Vulture - be loosed from its voidful eyrie to cover the scattered bones of the aeons.

This sacred eidola of the way is beyond temporal-ity and spatiality, and yet the very nature of the Path is to perpetually locate the focus of the mind within the present instant-to establish each moment as a direct route to the manifest self-realisation of the Draconick Body. The process that leads to the Dragon's heart is imaged through the course of the fourteen ordeals and is displayed to the Seeker through the transfor-mation of symbolic and deific form. In the aureate image of Milcham-i-Azh'rail the secret alchymic wisdom ofla-Ra-Khu is em-bodied. The Phoenix, as the transient ikon of the Eternal, reveals the hidden transformative process acting within and upon the practitioner's consciousness and symbolically circumscribes the powers of transmutation within cognizable form. As the unity of symbol form and deific force, the theophanic appearance of the Phoenix serves to reflect back to the practitioner's inner perception both his aspiration and the very process of his on-going attainment. Through the masque of magical image the Unknown Intercessor of the Path weaves the spirit-procession, making the invisible visible through the outward displays of d.emonic incarnation, melding the Seeker's heart with the great retinues of the Dragon at each station of the way, and sealing all within the Black Light of the Perfect Mind. THE MYSTICAL LOCATION OF THE RITE The Rite of the Seven Stars marks the eleventh ordeal upon the Crooked Path, and is counted as the fourth Great Rite within the cycle of the solar/seasonal year. The customary date of its working is the 21st of]une; this being the especial date for the celebration of the Summer Sol-stice and falling exactly fourteen days after the fulfilment of the Grand Stellar Convocation of Ia. The principal requirement for all candidates desiring to undertake this Mystery is the posses-sion of the Phoenix-vessel, rightly empowered by the ordained praxes of preparation - whether by Star, Sun or Moon. Within the working of this ritual the Phoenix-vessel is offered to the sacrificial pyre within the Compass of the Never-setting Stars, and solely by this talismanic mi-mesis of self-sacrifice shall the Initiate attain unto the fulfilment of the Heptanomic Arcanum.

In entering the Rite of Khu the Seeker is brought to the innermost domain of gnostic self-comprehension and is simultaneously cast outward from the mortal selfhood of Man to the furthest range of transmundane conscious-ness. The unity and scope of this esotery is glyphed by the motionless equipoise of the initiate, standing upon the centre and yet walking at the horizon of the Circle. The numinous matrix 504"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"The Rite of KHU of magical force which underlies the form and stance of the initiatic being is patterned through the actuation of the Khu Rite and is progressively revealed through the mystical cartography of the Sacred Isle: the unfolding of the Land through the Sorcerer's pilgrimage. The Khu Rite marks the apotheosis for the theurgic flight of the Phoenix: the self-transcending journey of the Seeker to the Great Celestial Circle of the Heptanomis - the Ring of Seven Stars. The alchymic vehicula of the Phoenix rises through the formative arcanae of Ra and bears the initiatic consciousness through the opened gateway of the Dragon-star, beyond the synastrian capstone ofThu'ban-Helios and into the Domain of the Dragon's seven revealed heads. Each head of the Dragon is a star-sealed Conclave of the Primordial Gnosis, a single mandala of the Perfect Mind. The 'revealing' of the seven heads signifies the attainment of the Initiate upon the seven nodes of the Sacred Wheel of Time: the fruition of realisation within the Great Rites of Hu, Sa, Ba, Khu, La, Tan and Hua. By the transit of the Mage through the words and deeds of the Khu Mystery, the grammarie of communion with the Elder Gods -the Highest Initiatory Powers of the Crooked Path-is transmitted to the duly honed and prepared con-sciousness. It is thus that the prerequisite tasks of Ia-Ra-Khu function as a microcosm of the completed ordalium of the Pathway Entire, thereby inculcating the necessary self-potential in the aspirant for the attainment of the Heptanomic Arcanum. The purpose of the Khu Rite is thus to catalyse the potential ofla-Ra-Khu, the accumulated stasis of symbolic apprehension, and to unfold its inner significance as the Seven Visions or 'Star-sealed Scrolls' of the Draconian Gnosis. The sevenfold revelation in heaven's height is at one with the new-born vision of the Sacred Land below. The completion of the rite marks the final abatement of the flood tide, the cessation of the purifying deluge and the subsequent re-cognizance of phenomenal reality: the reification of the Body as the Verdant Kingdom of the Summer Isle. The seven heads of the Dragon are visibly comprehended as points of stellar radiance in the Northern sky. The principal sidereal analogue is the Circle of the Great Year wherein the heads of the Dragon are marked by seven bright stars, each lying within one of the seven principal constellations in the cycle of the polar precession. The names of these stars are given in the preparatory praxes of Ra and their mystical natures are revealed throughout the entire course of the la-Ra-Khu Arcana. A secondary sidereal analogue of the Heptanomis is the circumpolar constellation of the Plough or Carl's Wain. This stellar group is identified in the Summer months with the chariot of Liliya and is also seen to represent her sacred weapon, the sickle-blade, raised high above the World-field to reap the Grain of Life. In the Winter months, when the constellation is low upon the horizon, it is revered as the funeral bier of the Corpse-king Mahazhael and is seen to rep-resent his sacred implement, the plough-coulter, cutting into the World-field and opening the grave-deft of Death. The attributions of its stars to the crowns of the Dragon are given below (see Table of Correspondences below). Through the Perfected Initiatic Mind the seven states of gnostic sentience, as realised through the Great Rites of the year, mediate between the outward synastrian configurations of the Hep-tanomis and their inward reflection -the vortices of power within the physical body of the practitioner. The seven gates in the celestial sphere open within the vehicle of the flesh through the transcarnative 'constellations' of internal radiance: the numen of Azhdeha is transmitted as gnosis through the seven 'states' of Al Halka; as regenerative psycho-physical illumination through the 'seven jewelled cities' in the axis of Al Lata'ifa; and as incarnative wisdom through the fourteen power-zones of the transvocatory Dragon-body.

In the Ring of the Never-setting Stars lies the transcription of the Holocryptic Grammar of Arte. In the skyward outreach of the mind the course of the Dragon-sorcerer's royal ascent is written: a paean to the exaltation of the Unified Psyche of Sorcerer and Serpent, seven times crowned upon the Royal Seat of Azhdeha. By this beatific ministry the Unknown Intercessor shall cleave asunder the skull-graal of Man, sacrificially transforming all mortal conception and thereby raising the offering of Mind to the boundless expanse of the cosmos.

That which has been, is, and shall be achieved through the turning of the Dragon-wheel of Time is ensorcelled and encrypted within the single conclave of the Heptarchic Wisdom. In the Circle of Khu the Dou-ble-way of Time -the means of spontaneous realisation and the means of sequential progres-sion - are aligned so as to demonstrate the atemporal essence of each of the great rites in the Sacred Year. The time of the Summer Solstice is appointed for this culmination of knowledge in order to reflect and juxtapose the Midwinter Rite, the zeroth source of the seven revealed heads. The exaction of the Khu Rite intends the alignment of the Black Sun with the Disk of the White Sun: the syzygy between the twin irradiances of the Longest Night and the Longest Day. As the Black-Light-in-White-Darkness, the nigrescent conjunction of the darkest night and the brightest day shines forth, -as one in the heptarchic temple of the sorcerer's flesh. Here is the Wisdom that reifies the Primal Sentience of the Dragon's Concealed Head: the Voidful Mind of Azha-Qayin revealed in the seven sacred powers of initiation. RETRACING THE PILGRIMAGE AND UNFOLDING THE LAND FROM THE SINGLE STEP In the Mystery ofla the step of attainment is placed upon the Point of Thu'ban-Helios, upon the mystical cross-roads between the Dragon-star's culmination and the course of the Sun. For upon the night of the Dragon-star's zenith the spirit is borne aloft by the power of the Crooked Path's Intercessor; the Seeker is sent forth in heavenward flight, ascending in the form of the Phoenix to the summit of the innermost coil. In the magical comprehension of this ascent the stellar light of the Dragon-star is aligned with the heliacal source of illumination. This is cast in time as the count of fourteen days that lead from the Rite of Ia to the Rite of Khu - from the culmination of Thu'ban to the midsum-mer zenith of the Sun. The fourteen days of Ra count the tasks of the Crooked Path as a whole and enumerate the duration of the Phoenix' flight from its birth unto its death. This is a mirror held to the initiate's pilgrimage and directs the way to the arcane place of Witchblood's initi-atic nativity. For the Phoenix rises from the hearth of the Blood-acre during the Rite of Ia and returns to the place of its greater birth during the Rite of Khu -the fire amid the Compass of the Never-setting Stars. Before moving on to explicate the greater esotery of the Phoenix-vessel, some further com-ment upon the Dragon-star is germane. In the correspondence between the seven heads of the Dragon and the seven stars of the celestial pole, Thu'ban moves from its station as the guardian of the hidden tide of the year and is attributed to the node of Khu, thereby acting as the Opener 506"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"The Rite of KHU of the Way into the Mystery of the Heptanomis upon the day of the Sun's longest reign. It is from the heavenly radiance of the Dragon-star that the Oracle of Elder Worship was first cast down to Man. Thu'ban, as the star of the sinistral foot, leaps forth from la to Khu as the Re-vealer of the Dragon's seven heads; its arcane nature is therefore at the head and the heels of the Crooked Path, between which extremities it is the perpetual source for the passing-on of the First Sorcerer's power. By the birth of the Phoenix through the pyre ofla, the synastrian focus between the Dragon-star and the Sun is attained and realised as the Gateway to the Rainbow'd Causeway of the Heptanomis. In the Consummation of the Khu Rite, where the seven radices of the Year align, the Crooked Path is imaged as the Road of the White Shadow. This signifies the reflexive Way of Return to the initiatory source: the gait of the Opposer turning and re-turning into the Way of the Black Light. At one in the Zeroth Mysterium of the Black Sun, the single point of Thu'ban-Helios is inflamed through the creation of the Phoenix-vessel and thus, through the act of sorcerous and mimetic birth, the vehicula of Ra becomes the gateway for the resurgent powers of the Marriage-vessel of Ka. For after the initial consummation of the Hieros Gamos, the absence of the Marriage-vessel attains an operative significance throughout the continuity of the Path; it is perceived - in its very negation -as the Void-image of the primordial sacrifice, as the Effigy of the Dragon's Concealed Head. Whether in the first year of practice or after many turnings of the Dragon-wheel, the memory of the Ka Vessel is honoured and its absence is contemplated as the eidola of the Elder Gods -of Those-who-are-Not. And it is thus each year, during the stel-lar empowerments of Ra, that the Phoenix is revered as the messenger of the Elder Gods, arising on the fourteen days of its flight from the place of negation, solely to impart the numinous light of Wisdom from the antient pyre of Ka. Through the re-membrant deeds involved in the praxis of the Phoenix-vessel, the Absent One of Ka is awakened as the reificatory source of the Draconian Heptarchy. For it is through the synastrian focus of Ia-Ra-Khu that the primal severed head of the Dragon becomes the gateway for the seven resurgent powers of Time: the seven star-crowned Gods of the JEons. Ka, as the Concealed Head of Azhdeha, is the void-consciousness of the Sorcerer, the Silent Omniscience of the Perfect Mind. It conceals the 'seven stars', the aeonic hypostates of the Ini-tiator, as the potential emanations of Self-realised Gnosis. Within the all-spaciousness of the Hidden Magister's skull it is said that the seven knowing ones sleep, dreaming in death until the 'time' of their appointed awakening. The Pavonine Phoenix of Ra, as the embodiment of the process of revelation, augments the progressive rousing of each sleeper. This signifies the ascendant transformation of the aspirant's mind within the seven times of the Sacred Year. The full process of the sevenfold transmutation is condensed in the praxis of 'Honing the Sword'. Therein the Seeker is mystically beheaded seven times; this signifies the sacrificial of-fering of his mundane consciousness, seven times for the rites of Hu, Sa, Ba, Khu, La, Tan and Hua. The seven skull-bowls begotten of the practice are used to contain the entirety of the aspirant's being. The starward offering of the seven bowls in the Khu Rite is used to demon-strate the elevation of consciousness toward the realised states of the seven great rites and the complete transformation of entity through its congression with the stellar embodiments of the Elder Gods. The primal sacrifice of Ka is therefore perceived to magically exact the initial severing of mortal conception and the transformative unification of consciousness with the Realised Mind of the Initiator, Qayin Azhaka; who is revered as the first incarnation of the primal motivating intelligence of the Crooked Path. In the form-body of Cain, the Initiator is the first murderer of Man. Jn lore, it is taught that he wielded the blade of sacrifice - a plough-coulter or jawbone adze - to behead the Man of Clay, the uninitiated self. The murderous deed of Cain is inter-"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomol'fia Draco'Tau.s preted as the salvific act whereby the profane mind is anulled and the flesh is opened to the ingressing powers of the heavenly Serpent of Fire. The sacrificial symbolism of beheading is used to indicate the fundamentally transgressive means of the Path's attainment, also to signify that the root-empowerment of the Seven Gnostic States of Realisation lies within the black-golden point of Ka-I. This identification locates the eschatonic source of the seven great rites in the hearth of the midwinter consummation. Con-versely, there is a synentasic union, a parallel convergence of the seven magical currents ofl, Hu, Sa, Ba, Khu, La, Tan and Hua, within the illumined focus ofla-Khu at midsummer. The bright point of the White Sun, the Great Disk ofThu'ban-Helios, is raised to its apotheosis amidst the Heptanomis and, in opposition to the Black Sun of midwinter, casts the backward path of the lucent shadow. The albeate focus juxtaposes the nigrescent source. As the Vessel of Marriage falls within the Circle of Presence, so shall Vessel of the Phoenix fall within the Circle of Absence: the Black Light shall shine in White Darkness. The Way of the Seeker's infernal descent, the Great Return to the heart of Black Sun, is delin-eated by the ineffable radix of White Darkness. At the sacrificial zenith of the Phoenix' ascent the seven currents of Time and Space return through the prismatic eidola of their unity-the skull of the Initiator visualised as a shews tone of black diamond - thereby to create the Road of the White Shadow. Like a rainbow merging back into the clear light of the sky, the seven radices of the aeons conjoin in a single beam of illumination. The direction of this, the eight or zeroth ray, indicates the return to the hearth of the Blood-acre and thus to the place of the past and future actuations of the Black Sun's Rite. The road that is born from the apotheosis ofla-Ra-Khu leads forward in time through the ritual year and yet transmits the eternal arcanum of the infernal descent, the pilgrimage of the mind to the point of root-empowerment. The Gnosis of the Zeroth Mysterium is imparted through the triune point of Ka-I-Ra (Note well that Ka-i'ra is used as a name for the Fifth Watcher.) This tridentate focus serves as the a-temporal crossroads between the mysteries of the Marriage-vessel and the Phoenix-vessel - be-tween the darkest night and the brightest day. Here the course of intent flows with the temporal direction of the current, simultaneously turning back to the a-temporal source of the seven streams. Herein is an arcanum for the realisation of the Seeker: a Secret of the Double-way of Non-dual Truth. Within this Mystery of Khu the seven heads of the Dragon are raised, revealed and named as the seven stars of the Great Year. By this arcanum, the sorcerer realises the heptarchia of the trans-~onic force and, bearing witness to the irradiant luminaries of heaven, beholds the earthen city ofKahu, the Nocturnal Eden of the Sabbatick Paradise. From the height of Khu, as from the placeless summit of the empyrean capstone, the Eye may behold the ring of the year and the location of the seven domains of Mystery placed about its compass. The new realisa-tion of the Circle in the light of the Seven Stars signals the possibility for the apocatastasis: the complete re-creation of the Seeker, the transformation of the seven-times slain. The Eye shall be opened to the newborn Isle of the Blessed! THE HEPTAD OF TIME AND THE BODY OF ALL-SPACIOUSNESS Upon the day of Ia, the single point of Thu'ban, the Draconick Cynosure, is aligned with the Sphere of Helios. This opens the door of the sky to the power of the seven aeons: the body of all-spaciousness to the Heptad of Time. From the celestial height of the Dragon-star the Phoenix-child ascends through the solstitial gateway of the Sun to the stellar zenith of the heav-enly year; the Throne of Azh-ta'us becomes the sevenfold seat of the Hidden Ones' Monarchy. 508"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of KHU The matrix of this arcanum is shown in the enumerative co-relation between the heads of the Dragon, the kalic radiances of Time, the fourteen body-points and the divers rites and formul~ of the grimoire.

The Fourth Head is the Vessel of the Green Radiance, the vehicle for the middle stream within the sequence of the seven great rites. In being undertaken at the bright midpoint of Time, at the solstitial illumination of the Sacred Year, the Khu Rite is perceived as the gateway from the present moment into all atemporality,-as the point of trans-formation through which the Path transcends the timely way of sequential progression and passes beyond, ascending into the Timeless Circle of the Elder Gods (The description of other Great Rites as 'Interstices' or 'Portals' -for example 'The Crimson Interstice of Hu', serves to adumbrate this arcanum according to the specific nuances of a given ritual.) The elevation of consciousness into the Realm of the Immortal lnitiatic Powers is beyond the facility of communicable knowledge. None may tell of the Path's Outer Ward, the Guardians of the Path who exist beyond the transient moment of mortal reality. That the mind of aspiration may apprehend the Unknowable by means of symbolic knowledge, the theophany of the Path reveals the alignment between the Hidden Doorways of the Elder Gods and the visible stars of heaven. It is therefore made known, by providence of vision and dream, that the concealed finitor of the Khu Arcanum is conjunct unto the Earthen Circle of Arte through the Sphere of Stars, most especially the Hyperborean Region of the Never-setting Stars. For within the Circle"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomosia Draco'Taus of Heaven's Great Year the Heptarchic Cryptogram of the Antient One is cast before the Eye of the Wise. It is worthy of note that, according to the correspondence between the eight airts and the parts of the Dragon-body, the sacred occasion of the Khu Rite corresponds to Al Lata'ifa -the point of the spine: the seventh node in the Dragon-body. Al Lata'ifa is the magical power-zone through which the seven 'axial locations' are operative; seven times multiplying all that passes into the 'heart' or central channel of the transvocatory body. Furthermore, in the adjunctive corpus of arcana -Al Manda! Ia-Khu-Behenu-Ka -the spine-point corresponds to the Dog-star Sirius, also known as Sept: the Heart-star or Seven-rayed One. With reference to customary attributions, the correspondence between the Khu Rite and the triune point of Al Lata'ifa ( cp, x, and¢ Draco) relates to an identification between the rachidian axis of the Dragon-body and the triple axes of temporal and spatial arcana. In terms of the chronomantic esotery, the actuation of the Khu Rite unites the three times -the views of Past, Present and Future -and evolves their aeonic hypostates to a unitive summit. As the central pyre in the second circle of the ritual is lit, the Eye of Eternity opens at the mid-point of the Heptanomis and gazes beyond the compass of the Great Year. In terms of the spatial demarcation of the I-Ia-Khu Arcan~, the triplicity of Al Lata'ifa is expressed as the perpendicular axis marrying Heaven and Hell in the bed of Earth. Ra, the formulae of the Phoenix, is realised as the thaumaturgic method augmenting the very process which obtains this sacred union 'twixt height and depth. Within this present place of sidereal interpretation, the upright path is thus perceived as the conduit for the transmission of the Ra empowerment-as the tree of interconnection between the celestial, telluric and chthonic power-zones. These are here respectively ascribed:-Khu is the Greater Circle of the Sky and the empyreal shrine of the midsummer sun; Ia is the Way for the Dragon-star's 'stepping' upon the Earth; and I is the Root, the shrine of the Infernal Descent and the place of the Sun's inverse exaltation at the Midnight of Time. It is said in lore that the Phoenix nests atop the highest mountain and that its death-song is the lament heralding the end of time. The Dragon's spine, as the hollow channel which draws down the fire from heaven, is the instrument of the self-same paean: the flute of seven notes upraised in the hands of Man as the phoenical Summit-attainer. These spatial and temporal correspondences are made apparent by silent indication through the depictive media of ritual geometry. The earth-signs in the second circle of the Heptanomic Rite delineate the oppositional alignments of I and Khu by juxtaposing the fourth and eighth/ zeroth radices upon the North-South axis. The hot-point ofla-Ra-Ka is centred at their mid-point within the heart of the sacrificial pyre. Furthermore, to elaborate upon an earlier comment concerning the especial significance of the Dragon-star: the northern extremity of the Double-ouroboros - as the 'Place of Power' in the second circle -is herein ascribed as the hot-point for Thu' ban's transvocation as the fourth or median radix of the Hep tad. In the Rites of Hu, Sa, La and Hua, the same node of the second circle is also attributed to Thu'ban, but therein as the point of the Dragon's sinistral step. Upon this Voidful Place of Power the foundation of the Dragon's step becomes the point for the rais-ing of the Seven Crowned Heads. The oracular empowerment of the Dragon-star is thus passed on between the head and the heels of the way. The aspirant may therefore look to the unspeaking tracery of the circle for the cipher of these mysteries. Therein, amongst the geoglyphic sigildry of Arte, lie the many subtil alignments encrypting the way of the Tridentate Axis and the web of the Dragon's dance. 510"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"CONCERNING THE HEPTANOMIS AS THE CIRCLE OF THE GREAT YEAR 'Ihe Rite of KHU The Circle of the Great Year is the invisible path traced in the Northern Heavens through the aeon-stepped procession of the Pole or Nowl-star. The Pole is the celestial point about whose axis the entire compass of the sky appears to turn. By vertu of the Earthen Sphere's motion the position of the Pole moves through the course of time; the gyre traced through this motion delineates the circumference of the Great Year. The time taken for one complete rotation of the Great Year is approximately 26,000 tell uric years (one tell uric year= 365 earthly days). Within this period, stars fall and rise from the position of the Pole like rulers falling and rising over an epoch of time. Many shall enter the path, but few shall attain to its throne. Seven chosen constellations stand as mansions about the Inmost Court of the Northern Heaven and within each palace is a bright sentinel, a destined heir to the Royal Seat of Power. It is thus, according to the esoteric observance of this Grammary, that seven specific stars are said to occupy the station of the Nowl. Each of the seven stars is appointed as the gateway for a revealed head of the Dragon and each is ordained to reign over a specific duration of time, to be the Heavenly Monarch of an Age. It is thus that the seven stars are referred to in terms of regal symbolism -as 'crowns' or as aspects of the 'Throne' - Takht-i-Tan-ta'us. The seven sides of the sky-throne are the gateways for the <eons, the kalic radiances of Time; each is a point of ingression for a principal initiatory empowerment of the Crooked Path. The radix or subtil lineage conveying the power of each star is the mediatory path of an aeonic ruler; the nature, form and force of which is displayed through the symbolic appearance of the Deities residing in the retinue of Al Mandal Khu. The term 'ceon' refers to both the chronological epoch governed by each star and to the eso-teric concept of seven concurrent streams of magical power,-any one of which may become the dominant line of transmission in a given time and place. Each of the seven stars is thus a focus for a specific stream of illumination or means of realisation within the Quintessential Current. The doorways in the sky are opened through the alignments of time, space and mind; the co-lours of the ingressing radices denote the nature and qualitative resonance of the divine impress from beyond the sphere of the recipient's perception. The purpose of the Khu Rite is to define and transmit the constituent radices of the initiatory continuum, to make manifest the chronomantic forces of the Magical Quintessence within the single body of the initiate. The trans-ceonic unity of the seven radices is uttered upon the eighth or 'unnumbered' radix of the Khu Rite with the lighting of the sacrificial pyre. The flames of Azh-taus declare the Si-lent Word of the Oracle. As one through the seven mouths of the Dragon, the A-logos is forth-spoken and enters into flesh upon the wheel of time through the heptarchic Logoi ofHu-Sa-Ba-Khu-La-Tan-Hua. Beneath the light of the Black Sun the wheaten field of eternity shall ripen upon the earth and shall shine forth in golden splendour. Through the Mystery of the Grain, its sowing, nurturing, reaping and transformation, the body of the Seeker shall be nourished with the shewbread of the aeons and shall grow wise in partaking of the feast at Midnight's Table. 511"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Grimorium e2nomoeia Draco'Taue The correspondence between the seven polestars, the <£ons, and the heads of the Dragon may be stated thus:-PRIMARY CONS TEL-AEON SECONDARY RADIX RADIXt DRAGON-COLOUR STELLAR LAT ION STELLAR (!ST CIRCLE) (2ND HEAD POINT POINT CIRCLE) Al Daiajahl Cygnus Hu Benetnasch North-South-First Blood-red Deneb east west AIDeramin Cepheus Sa Mizar East West Second Amber/ Sun-rise Orange Al Kiblah/ Ursa Ba Alioth South-North-Third Yellow of Polaris Minor east west Morning Al Thu'ban Draconis Khu Megrez South North Fourth Green of the Field AlPheia Corona Bo-La Phecda South-west North-Fifth Sky-blue realis east AlJathiya Herculis Tan Merak West East Sixth Corpse-indigo Nasruvaka Lyra Hua Dubhe North-west South-Seventh Royal Violet east All Seven Circle of the 1 Seven Stars of North South Zeroth/ Black-gold Great Year the Plough Eighth t In the domain of the first circle the correspondence of the seed-phonemes to the directions of the compass is fixed and does not vary throughout the wheel of the year.

The main distinction is that a fire mound should be built at the centre of both circles. Neither fire should be lit before the inception of the ritual. The pyre in the first circle should be ignited during the threefold exorcisms of the Oracle Rite and that in the second circle after the completion of the seven stellar conjurations. Within the centre of each fire-mound a long stave of wood should be set, each to serve as an image of the upright road. Atop the pillar in the first circle a wreath of oak should be placed and upon the second pillar a wreath of evergreen, such as yew or holly. The border of the entire ritual site may be enclosed by a selion-fence. This should be formed of staves and tied together with thread. THE REQUISITES OF THE KHU RITE Let all who would truly enter the Conclave of this Mystery of Khu be prepared according to the deeds of the Crooked Path; let each and all be most diligent to the counsel of the concealed ones whom have walked this Circle beyond the count of the fourteen ordeals. Know that this rite may be practised alone or in the holy covine, according to the predilections of the sorcerer and the quadrigan brood. As aforesaid, the principal prerequisite for any desirous of entering this rite is the initiatory act of creating and working with the Phoenix-vessel. Although this task is customarily inaugu-rated through the Mystery ofla and is partaken of as an integral facet of that rite, it needs must be said that the arcanum and the method of the Phoenix-vessel's construction and usage may be extracted from that context and applied independently as an autonomous formula serving as the preliminary votive observance leading to the Khu Rite. This comment arises from direct experience of practice and is here offered in order that the Seeker may consider the variant ap-plications of this formula. An exemplar drawn from custom is for the basic praxis of the Phoenix-vessel to be used as the preparatory votive discipline for a novitiate seeking entry to the Crooked Path. The basic methods of the Phoenix-vessel are applied in a manner akin to that of the Hieros Gamos, being used as a way of ingress for the new aspirant to the Mysteries of the Dragon-road. The midsum-mer node of the Seven Star's working is here utilised as the Swift Gate, as a means whereby one may enter the Path and walk thereupon outside of the formal sequence of its fourteen ordeals. In a covine well-travelled upon the Way, this variant method may be utilised to permit an initiate from a comparative persuasion of the Arte to align their empowerment unto the Quintessential Radiance-to offer themselves unto the Dragon. In all such instances where the Phoenix-vessel has not arisen from the Mystery of Ia the duration of the practice must be for one complete lunar month before the Khu Rite (see the Exordial Comment concerning the Phoenix-vessel). In such instances where candidates for the Khu Rite may come forth unto the circle of the covine by the way of the Lunar Empowerment, the Magister shall need to adapt the formal procedure of the ritual and serve as the mediator of the aspirants' induction.

The sigillic patterns used for the earth-signs of the Heptanomis are given in the ritual text. These forms are derived from the constellations in which the sidereal foci of the rite are located. Elsewise the earth-signs should be made manifest in accord with dreaming. 3) Once the earth-sign of the Heptanomic radix has been traced, a candle - being of the ap-propriate hue - should be lit from the central seven-hued candle and taken to the stellar point on the circle's edge. Thus the earth-sign is traced inward to the centre and the light is borne outward to establish the limina of the celestial horizon. 4) Once the candle has been appointed as the primary offering of light, further sacrificial gifts -such as coins, eggs, flowers, grain, wine, incense, blood and breath - may be made on and around the point and its earth-sign. Thereafter the ordained conjuration should be recited. The formal text of the conjurations, as given herein, is to serve as the basis for the offering of the Seeker's word; each initiate should endeavour to build upon this foundation according to the ingression and inspiration of the stellar empowerment. ' 5) Upon each one of the seven points, each initiate should visualise their Phoenix-vessel as a skull-bowl, filled with a sacrificial offering of an appropriate nature and colour. The specific qualities and forms of these visualisations are given in the text of each conjuration, and derive from the forms created in the preparatory praxes ofla-Ra-Khu. From the bowl of offering, a sword-ray oflight should be seen to ascend into the sky, reaching upward to the named star of the enchantment. The ray of light is the transmuted form of the arthana-blade as forged during the practise of 'Honing the Sword'. The transformation of the metal, or substantive vehicle, into the radix oflight, or subtil vehicle, signifies the refinement of the knowledge and method of attainment. To symbolically augment and accentuate this process of transmutation, the Phoenix-body-may be projected upward through the beam of light, radiating and emanating with flames of the appropriate colour. As the Phoenix-body ascends all substantive and mindful offerings should be visualised to transform, melding into the radix oflight and thereby carried upward to the celestial focus. 6) Rising to its celestial focus, the radix oflight should be perceived to coalesce space and time, and therefrom generate the form of a vast skull. This should be seen as a colossal vessel of jew-elled bone, expanding in a reflection of the initiate's consciousness to fill the entirety of the sky. The ascending beam oflight and the body of the Phoenix should be dissolved within the skull's interior to form the limitless source of celestial wisdom. Within the heavenly skull-vessel the elixir of the <£onic point is visualised as an ocean of radiant light, a cosmic reservoir displaying the union of the aspirant's mindful offerings and the empowering essence of the Elder Gods. Upon each of the seven points the skull is formed of a different gemstone, the type of which denotes a specific configuration of realised knowledge - a phase of crystallisation within the process of alchymic transmutation. The specific substantial nature of the skull is representative"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomosia Draco'Taus of the circle-mandala which contains the reified wisdom of the star. Its function in the visuali-sation is to serve as the support or vehicula for the kalic radiance emanating from the point of stellar ingression. Throughout the conjurations the seven primary phases of the alchymic process are encrypt-ed using different spectra of symbolism - sidereal, ~onic, geomantic, metallurgic, chromatic and so forth. Each different mode of symbolism is a support for the subtil and interior motion of awareness as it is translated from point unto point. Clear differentiation should be made between the various exterior modes of symbolic representation; each is an outward cipher, a functional means for the inner apprehension of the invisible radices of the Quintessence. 7) Having attained to the visualisation of the skull-vessel, having formed in mind the great celestial mansion around the starry focus of an aeonic power, let the initiate entreat the ap-pearance of his mindful creation as a shewstone for the revelation of theophanic vision. The oracular speculum of the skull-vessel is treated as a skrying-glass for the entire body of one's perception -as the means for the direct perception of Gnosis. According to the specific symbolism of each enchantment, let the Quadriga project the ma-trix of their mindful imagery to receive the impress of knowledge from the ingressing powers of initiation. In the shewstone of Man's own skull, let the Great Dreams of the Elder Gods be made manifest. At this juncture in each enchantment, the mind should be opened to the reception of new empowerment. All oracular transmissions should be heeded carefully and, if so directed, should be written down by an appointed scribe of the covine. See 'The Key to the Star-lock'd Casket of the Seven Scrolls', appended to the main text of the rite. Point by point, star by star, let the visions of the Heptanomis be contemplated to attain the gnosis of the seven great rites within the Dragon-wheel of Time. The Heptanomis is here to be realised as the cipher for the entirety of the Draconian Grimoire. 5) Each in its own turn, the self-arising embodiments of the seven heads should be perceived to unify with the mind of the Seeker. By the unity of Thought, Word and Deed, let the conjuration of the radix be bound. Let all be dissolved within the singularity of Void and Flesh in Ekstasis. At the behest of the Magister, the companie shall pass onward, from star unto star, until the seven principal conjurations are fulfilled. To seal and perfect the Rites of the Second Circle, all shall unite in the Unnumbered Enchantment-in the Words and Deeds of the Phoenical apotheosis.

Let the Initiate be seated before the Dragon-vessel, a candle of green wax burning upon its sealed top. Firstly, let him open the way and establish the Sphere of the Ten Directions through the basic form of Hallowing the Kingdom. Thereafter let the Stellar Transvocation be worked, adapting its text for the Body Entire of the Draconick Power.

The timeless form of this fire should be united with a temporal likeness from the past: the remembered image of the sacrificial pyre as used in the second circle of the Khu Rite. When the luminous heart of the Dragon-vessel has become one with the image of remembrance, let the Seeker perceive the form of his sacrificed Phoenix-vessel to stand intact 5'4°"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"'Ihe Casket of Geven CeleetiaJ Gcrolle within the fiery core of the visualisation. The subtil image of the Phoenix-vessel shall thus be per-ceived to dwell within the heart of Azhdeha. Thus shall the foundation of this practice be laid. THE MAIN PRACTICE: The Actuation of the Heptanomis, being-The Generation of the Celestial Retinue of AzhdehaAl Mandal When the image of the PhoenL'(-vessel has been established and stabilised, the Seeker should undertake the main part of the practice:-Working one conjuration each night, let him work through the Enchantments of the Seven Radices. This should be accomplished using the known methods of visualisation and mindful projection to transform the Aethyric Phoenix-vessel within the heart of the Draconick Athanor. The body of the Dragon-vessel should be imaginatively expanded to contain and ensorcel the complete visualised imagery arising through each conjuration. At the apotheosis of each enchantment, at the stage wherein the form of a jewelled skull is perceived and is entreated as a shewstone to reveal the Vision of a specific aeon, the Seeker shall implement the appropriate additional visualisations to generate the Celestial Retinue of the Heptanomis. Upon each of the seven days, when the Celestial Gates of the Heptanomis are opened in turn and the great skulls -the elevated images of Mind-are revealed one-by-one in the expanse of heaven, let the mantic words of power resound to call forth the Sidereal Deities of the Seven Revealed Heads. The kalic radiances, the great oceans oflight which surround and permeate each of the seven skulls, should be perceived to condense and dissolve within the innermost point of the vision. Within the centre of each jewelled skull, the body of an immense Pearl-white Serpent should then be seen to arise, a thousand times coiled with a heart of blackest diamond, rearing upward in serene dignity like unto a royal uraeus. Upon the first day, the blood-red radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Ser-pent with the words AL MANDAL HU: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with the head of the Seeker. Upon the second day, the amber radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Serpent \\\\ith the words AL MANDAL SA: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with the head of the Seeker's totemic beast. Upon the third day, the saffron radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Serpent with the words AL MAN DAL BA: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with the head of the Seeker's personal god. Upon the fourth day, the viridian radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Ser-pent with the words AL MANDAL KHU: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with a mirror for a head-to reflect the unified time and space of the Khu Rite's manifestation. Upon the fifth day, the azure radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Serpent \\\\ith the words AL MANDAL LA: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with the head of greatest beauty and yet of greatest abomination - foul and fair by turns. Upon the sixth day, the indigo radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Serpent \"ith the words AL MANDAL TAN: the Deity shall arsie as the Serpent with the head of a peacock. Upon the seventh day, the violet radix shall dissolve into the scales of the Pearl-white Serpent v.ith the words AL MANDAL HUA: the Deity shall arise as the Serpent with the head of the Seeker's own future corpse."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium G)?nomo6ia D.raco1Ta.u6 Each day a single radix of the Heptanomis shall dissolve its light into the shimmering scales of the Serpent and there, upon the billion-scaled body, the sigillic scriptures of the starry fo-cus shall be seen through the Blazing Eye of Revelation - inscribed in fire upon the sky-broad parchment - unfurling from within the casket of the Dragon's Concealed Head. This is the Revelation of the Seven Scrolls: the Theophany of the Magical Teachings lock'd by the Mind of Qayin within the Circle of Heaven's Great Year. When the form of each deity has been attained in clarity, it should be entreated to impart the Gnosis of its Aeon. One should realise that to perceive the deific form is to purify the mind: to behold the outward eidola of divine appearance is to apprehend the manifestation of its Gnosis. The mindful appearance of Deity incepts the reification of the Wisdom that is being aspired to, this being the essential knowledge transmitted through the seven Great Rites of the Dragon-wheel of Time. SEALING THE PRACTICE To seal and bind the practice upon each of the seven days, one should proceed thus:-The heart of each deity should be visualised as an egg of adamantine darkness, within which an infinitely minute point blazes with golden light. The entire form of the vision should be made to vibrate with the utterance of the appropriate seed-phoneme and should be perceived to dissolve within the inmost singularity of perception. By the thundercrack of the sorcerous cry, let all be absorbed into the seed of golden light. For this light is the sacrificial flame established within the foundation of the practice and is at one with the physical flame that burns atop the Dragon-vessel. Realising this unity, the Seeker shall utter the final section of the Heptanomic Enchantment and then, to finally bind the session of practise, he shall recite the closing stanza of the Stellar Transvocation. Before extinguishing the candle-flame upon the vessel, the basic form of Hallowing the King-dom should be used in the reverse order-KA-IA-I-HUA-TAN-LA-KU-BA-SA-HU ... all shall thus be returned unto the primordial source of the Path. Upon the day after the seven enchantments have been fulfilled the practice should be under-taken using the symbolism of the eighth or zeroth radix:-Within a great skull of black diamond the sevenfold light of the rainbow shall emanate from the scales of the Seven-headed Serpent-the Retinue of Al Mandal shall arise as one from the Palace of the Concealed Head. If it be so desired, one may pursue this practice for a greater period of time than the prescribed seven or eight days. If deemed germane to the greater comprehension of the Heptanomic Arca-num, the practice should be maintained daily until an appropriate lunar node: the Full or Dark Moon following the completion of the Khu working. Then, at such a time of the Moon's transi-tion, the praxes of the Stellar Trans mission should be concluded and the preparatory pra.xes for the La Rite should begin. 5¥"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"1he Casket of Gwen Celestial Gcrolls EXHORTATION OF AL MANDAL IA-RA-KHU Open!

Thereafter the rites shall be exacted according to the instructions given in the main body of text, each according to its time and place in the cycles of reckoning. Upon each of the fourteen digits during the dark fortnight of time, the Seeker shall perform the sacrifice called 'The Great Oblation of the Sixteen Hearts'. By this means he shall gain en-trance into the greater mysteries of Ku-La and shall partake in the secret eucharist: 'The Com-munion oflmmortal Hearts'. By such enchantment he shall accomplish the Preliminary Transvocation of the Concealed Retinue; the Eye of Vision shall be opened within the Gardens of all Forbidden Ecstasie and therein shall behold the Companie of the Tameless Ones -the Fourteen Secret Deities of Azh'rakinah. The Praxes of Consummation and Perfection. Upon all occasions of practising the rites of Ku-La, stages 9 and 10 are to be used to bind, com-plete and seal the point, path and circle of its arcanum:-9) Placing the Landmark:-the Planting of the Lumine in the appropriate Dragon-point, hand-digit, talismanic focus, and location upon the land. IO) The Realisation of the Lumine as the Hidden Polestar. In the final days of preparation before the Great Rite of La-Azhaka, the divers aspects and tasks of the whole practice should be unified through the Transvocatory Enchantment called 'The Communion of Immortal Hearts'. In the Body Entire of the Dragon, let the Arcanum be fulfilled. Before the practice of Ku-La is begun, it is imperative to carefully read through the entirety of its text. The requisite details for each stage of its working procedure are included therein, and are expounded upon throughout the divers commentaries which accompany the ritual incan-tations. Let each interpret and actuate the words of Ku-La according to their insight and skill. THE CYCLES OF PRACTISE In order to prepare for the Great Rite of La on August 1st, the praxes of'Catching the Silence .. .' are to be undertaken as the focal mode of the Seeker's magical discipline. The Mystery-rite of La is the sacred occasion for the Harvest-tide and Agapae -the veritable Love-feast of the Crooked Path. It is therefore needful to ready the aspirant for this rite by means germane unto its esoteric nature. The basic function of the Ku-La Formulae is thus to draw upon the emo-548"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Catching the Gilence Between Heartbeats tional and sexual spectra of the practitioner's entity and to harness the divers forms and forces thereof to the single direction of intent: the attainment of directly realised gnosis. The duration and regularity of discipline used in the application of the entire preparatory practice is expressed through various cycles of time, thereby emphasising different means of interpretation and magical significance. The practitioner is advised to utilise the method most suited to the unique pace and rhythm of his or her gait upon the Path. The Formal Cycle called 'Wandering in the Desert of Ku-La' The formally ordained period of the Ku-La discipline is forty days and forty nights, that is, the time between Midsummer Night and August 1st. If this observance of time and devotion can be maintained in harmony with the transvocatory cycles of Star and Moon, then such is best. The period of forty days and forty nights is perceived as the duration of time taken for the Seeker to suitably cohere the Realised Vision of his own nature after the fulfilment of the Hep-tanomic Rite, that is, to comprehend his own entity as the indivisible unity of the Stellar Void and the Verdant Land. Until this coherence of attainment is fully accomplished the 'Land' or Field oflnitiatic Being is veiled and may therefore be seemingly barren or obscured from clear perception. The true scope of the stellar empowerments of Ia-Ra-Khu may remain obscured by the gross aggregations of consciousness, those aspects of sensorial awareness which must of necessity pass through 'time' in a gradual manner in order to self-realise the complete transfor-mation of Being as affected by the alchymy of the Path. Whilst the eye may see the sun clearly in a single burst oflight from behind the clouds, we must wait until the sun shines high in a cloudless sky to behold the greater scope of its illumination. When the light of Helios emanates in clarity from the cerulean expanse of heaven the colours and contours of the earth may be known in truth to the eye of vision. The period of Ku-La is therefore seen as the time of approach toward the Gates ofEdenic Self-realisation -as the season of wandering through the Desert of Blindness, until the appar-ent Wasteland of Phenomena is perceived as identical with the Paradise ofEkstasis: the barren field as the Pleasure-garden of the Blissful Self-existent One. The Arcanum of Ku-La conceals the process whereby initiatic entity is comprehended as the 'verdant' domain of pure creative force. This is achieved through the re-cognition of Self as the unified matrix of generative power -as the fusion of imaginal, sexual and emotive forces. The transformation of Mind to this state of all-fecundity is sublated beneath the means of eroto-aes-thetic sorcery; the inner wisdom of the arcanum is thus made apparent through the display of its outer sexual symbolism. The concentration of generative force upon the Divinely Empassioned Deities of La harnesses and purifies desire, transforming it into a means for magical attainment. The methods of Ku-La intend the utilisation of sapient carnality as a direct route to gnosis. The divers physical impulses of the flesh are offered in devotion to inform the outer sym-bology of the practice. By the enhallowing fixation of belief all lusts, urges and yearnings are perceived as a sacrament for the incarnation of Deity. Through divers means of satiation, the panoply of corporeal desire is consecrated as a sacrificial feast between the Sorcerer and the Divine Lords and Ladies of the Blood-acre. By this offering, desire is transformed and its puri-fied manifestation is revealed through the revelatory appearance of Deity to the inward eye of nsion. The manifestation of the Ku-La Deities to the Mind is identified with the re-cognizance of the Body as the Purified Eden of Creativity. The implicit liberation of desire from self-attach-ment is cognate with the baring of the flesh: the sloughing of external guise and the assump-tion of spiritual nakedness as the sky-ornament or sacred robe of self-realisation. The process 549"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Tau.6 revealing this inner freedom is marked by the Mage's step-by-step progression to the La Rite, his pilgrimage toward the Azure or Sky-blue Interstice of Time. The Lunar Cycle Given the subtil nature of this practice and considering its transitional role between the Stellar Empowerments of Ia-Ra-Khu and the Great Rite of La, it may be deemed wise for the practi-tioner to wait until an appropriate node of time for its inception, such as the first Full or Dark Moon following after the complete cessation of the Khu praxes. The practise of Ku-La should then be undertaken for one complete lunar month and, at the fulfilment thereof - whether it be August 1st or not-one should then undertake the Greater Rite of the Draconick Agapae. For the careful pacing and stabilisation of the Path the lunar cycle of practise is probably the most suitable. This method is divided into two phases according to the waxing and waning fortnights of the Moon. In a manner similar to that used in the Transvocatory Count of Two Serpents, the fourteen digits or days within each fortnight are used for specific applications and permutations of magical praxis. The Solar Cycle For practitioners in the first year of turning the Dragon-wheel of Time it may be deemed wise for the following course of daily observance to be followed:-The adjunctive praxes of the Khu Mystery should be applied daily from Midsummer Night to the end of]une. One should utilise that period of time for the fulfilment and binding of the Ia-Ra-Khu phase of the Path. Thereafter, commencing on the 1st of]uly, one should begin the Ku-La Practice and pursue its course of discipline over the next four weeks ( 2 x 14 days). The month ofJuly should thus be considered as the sacred period of self-preparation for entrance into the Agapae of La. During the last two or three days of]uly, the preparatory praxes of Ku-La should be brought to some state of overall cohesion and sense of completion. This may be accomplished by inte-grating the complete mantic formulary of Ku-La within the practise of the Stellar Transvoca-tion. This should be worked as for the Body Entire of the Dragon and, if deemed appropriate, using the especial recension entitled 'The Communion of Immortal Hearts' (See Main Prac-tice -II). The Inner Cycle Without heed to the cycles of Star, Sun or Moon, the Seeker should walk forth unto the Gates ofLa-Azhaka, passing freely from ecstasie unto ecstasie, landmark to landmark, exploring the fullness of the Land through the innate rhythm of his or her divers sexualities. Each apotheosis of pleasure and revulsion, each height of sensuality, should be considered as a singular digit of time; for this is the count of the inner cycle of Ku-La. The wheel of practice may thus be revolved according to the secret calendar of the phallus, heart and kteis. In the first 'fortnight' of devotion -the period of the first fourteen digits - let all self-re-straint be dissolved and all sensations be partaken of in offering to the form-bodies, the Lords and Ladies of the Agapae. All emissions of sexual fluid should be used to consecrate the talis-550"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Catching the Gilence Between Heartbeats manic foci of congression, elsewise consumed as the living substance of this wisdom, the very sacrament of ecstasis. During the second 'fortnight' of practise, let the force-bodies of unmodified sexuality be con-joined with - beyond all motivation of attraction or repulsion. During this period no emission of vital fluids should be permitted; all must be used for the secret fulfilment of the Arcanum. Furthermore, in order to enhance divers trances of magical sensualisation during the first fourteen digits, it may be deemed appropriate to utilise stimulants: to eat and drink of the World-offer'd Banquet and to partake in the Sacraments of Al Thuba' - the flesh and blood of the Million-bough'd Tree. Conversely, in the second fortnight-digits 15-28, strict abstinence from such stimulants is to be maintained, coupled with divers forms of ascetic discipline, such as fasting, prolonged sleepless meditation and extended periods of prayerful vigil. One thus at-tains by the Double-way of the Feast and the Fast. THE PRACTICE OF KU-LA Being gathered before the Dragon-vessel, the practice shall commence when the body has been stilled by the regulation of breath and the mind has attained clarity without blemish of concep-tion. The basic form of Hallowing the Kingdom should be used to cast the circle of the ten direc-tions. Offerings of light and incense should be made to purify the place of devotion and to prepare the way for the spirits. When candles have been lit and all is deemed ready, a single note should be struck upon the rirual bell. 0 Offering Prostrations to the Hidden Polestar of the Heptarch Positioning the Dragon-vessel in the North, let one full prostration be offered as to the Secret Axis amid the Seven Lights of the Heptanomis. Having made the prostration, the nature of the Hidden Polestar should be contemplated. This meditation should be instigated by uttering the fullo\\\\ing address to the vessel: O' Azhdeha al Qafi-Akht'taw! Salutation to Thee! Light Invisible of the Crooked Path! All-hail to Thee as the Unknowable Zenith, Radix of Immediacy! Illumined Ground of all Infinity! All-hail to Thee as the Hidden Polestar, Al Qutb-i-Tan. Homage to Thee as the Keystone of Our Heptanomic Temple. Thou art the Adamantine Body of the Sacred Mountain, infolded uniquely within each indivisible point -the Heart of every Aeon!

O'Thou Infinite and Flawless Jewel of Truth, Thou art the Unmarked Tablet of Translucent Radiance. Thou dost pervade all, who art perceived of negation. Upon Thy skin all Realities are 'scribed. Thou art the Corpus of Our Elder Wisdom: the Librarie of every Star-sealed Scroll. Thou art the Axis, unturning in all deviation: the direct route through the angles of Time. Thou art the Dimensionless Basis of the Whirling Pyramidion, the Hidden Kingdom amongst the Revolving Spheres of the Cosmos, the Charnel-ground beneath the fiery step of the Serpent coiled within! All-hail to Thee, O' Azhdeha al Qafi-Akhtor! May the Mind of Initiation be opened to Thy Mystery. One may engage in the meditation upon the Hidden Polestar by contemplating all conscious-ness as a mirage, a reflection of the illusory nature of mind: the dance of existence -as light upon the Dragon's scales. Behind the world-skin of all perception the Dragon moves in change-less purity, its own nature unblemished by the myriad illusory perspectives of perceiving enti-ties. All realities are thus said to be written upon the scales of Azhdeha; none but the Blessed of Sight may behold the flawless page of the Truth beneath. To attain the stable inner realisation of the Dragon-body, the mind should conceive of its entirety as the zenith, body and basis of the Sacred Mountain, infolded completely within each and every spatial point and temporal moment. Its nature is the Quintessence, pervading all equally, a lightless light, a clear and translucent radiance of gnosis, permeating all existence as the intrinsic foundation of the Truth. The meditation upon the Concealed Mountain should be maintained for but a moment or for so long as is deemed necessary for its apparent comprehension. If one begins to consider that the true nature of the Dragon-body is being perceived, one should return to the begin-ning of the meditation - realising that the seeming attainment is but another mirage upon the Dragon's scales. The Arcanum of the Lightless Radiance lies outside beyond and beyond within. When the realisation of the Lightless Radiance has been attained for but a flickering of the eye, the practice should continue. Seven full prostrations should be offered to the Sacred Ves-sel, one for each of the seven rays: the acausal paths of gnostic transmission. Each prostration should be accompanied by the utterance of a single seed-phoneme: HU, SA, BA, KU, LA, TAN and HUA. This empowers the realisation of the Hidden Polestar and opens the way for the ingression of the seven rays.

Immediately after complet-ing the seven prostrations, one should resume the posture of meditation, seated in quiescence before the Dragon-vessel. Both hands should be placed upon one's chest over the location of the heart. All attention should be turned inward to listen and feel the beating of the heart. If this cannot be felt with the hands, a metal talisman or stone pressed against the skin will often serve to accentuate its perceptability. If needful one should utilise imagination and the controlled rhythm of breathing to actuate and enhance this practise. Concentration being placed upon the beats of the heart, one should begin to listen to the gaps of silence that lie between. To emphasise the silent spacemarks which punctuate the rhythm of sensation, the sound of each heartbeat may be magnified through imagination to seem like a great battery of drums. As attention is shifted to catch the silence between heartbeats, imagine that each gap lasts longer and longer - forming a gateway. Through the silent portal of the heart imagine a stream of rainbow light to radiate outward from the body, to flow forth in a continuum of seven rays, directly into the heart of the Dragon-vessel. The connection between the heart of the Seeker and the heart of the Dragon may be signified and affirmed by moving one's hands between oneself and the vessel. With each off-beat of silence the rainbow emanation should be seen to grow brighter and clearer. Mindful concentration, breath control and imaginative magnification should all be em -ployed to strengthen and stabilise the visualised emanation. This in itself may be used as a meditative discipline to open and begin any manner of practices, but within this present con text the visualisation is used as the means for the offering of all emotions into the Dragon-vessel: the point of the heart's transmutation. The silence between the Blood-drums beating-this is my Gateway. The musick of the beating drum -this is my battery of evocation to the Gods! Let the Bridge of Seven Rays reveal the Causal Path for the Hearts Design, where-upon I shall banish the Laughing Mourners: the Procession of all Emotion.

Appear before me as the Mansion of a Million Poignancies. Let each spirit be enthroned in Thy chambers of sensorial apotheosis -each spirit to be transformed through the deeds of this rite. BiloBiloHu KhuAzhaLa! Upon the bridge of seven rays a great multitude of spirits should be seen to march forward into the Dragon-vessel, each carrying a skull-bowl filled with a sacrificial offering: a beating heart disgorged from the breast of all living, pulsing and warm with the blood of every Being. The procession of spirits should embody the entire scope of one's emotional spectrum, rang-ing through the subtle nuances of nostalgic atmospheres to the wild and distinct states of pas-sion - such as love, rage, agony, exhilaration, despair, elation ... and so forth. The phalanx of the emotion-offering should be continued until one's heart seems emptied of all. The process of this imaginal projection may be assisted if one visualises the spirits as people -as those individuals with whom one has emotional connection. All past and present forms of emotional attachment should be remembered, considered and then relinquished; each recollection being imaged forth as an offering. The intent is to re-member the body of all emotive experience, to harvest and appreciate the lessons derived from every form of behavioural interaction, and to relinquish the bonds of attachment which have arisen throughout one's life. If the visualisation of the spirit-procession cannot be attained, one should simply verbalise a litany of remembered emotions and offer it to the vessel. The aim is to thoroughly recapitulate all emotional states, to view each distinct sensation of the heart as an equal sacrifice made to the point of transformation, to offer all in freedom from attachment, and to aspire to the state wherein one's emotive entirety is realised with a clear and open understanding. One should utilise this meditation as a means of emotional self-purification; its practise is therefore worthy of much time and attention. 2 -The Union of Hearts in the Interstice of Silence: the Realisation of the Seven Rays as the Road of the White Shadow The emotion-offering should be maintained until a profound quietude of heart has been at-tained. Using the charm below, one should then aspire to a direct realisation that one's own heart is identical to the mystical heart of the Primeval Serpent -at one in the Power of Azh-deha. This may be augmented by simply imagining that there is no distance between oneself and the Dragon-vessel, that the beginning and end of the rainbow causeway are one. By medi-tating upon this the appearance of duality between self and other is anulled. Reifying within vi-sualisation, this is perceived as the absorption of the seven rays within a singular point of white light - a dimensionless mote signifying the Arcanum of the Immediate Path and revealing the essence of the Sorcerous Heart as the Voidwise Road of the White Shadow. O' Heart of the Great Serpent! Heart of the Immortal Transgressor! Thou dost beat with the funereal drum of the Eschaton, with the thunder of rapture and terror -aloof and serene in the Warriors gait of immutable intent.

In this Silence between Heartbearts, we are both as One: resplendent as the Lumina of the Elder Gods, all-glorious in the Star-grain of the Heptanomic Pyre! In the eternal immediacy of our union, let the Road of White Shadow be revealed! Having recited the charm, one should abide in meditation upon the indivisible unity of the Seeker's heart and the heart of Azhdeha. One should perceive the vessel enshrined within the centre of one's body and vice versa; no distinction of self and other should arise. The rainbow causeway should be dissolved in this realisation of unity and therefrom the lumine, the focal point of clear white light, should be revealed as the seed of the Elder Gods. The numen of initi-atic self-creation is hereby kindled, revealed through the union of hearts within the synastrian alignment of the seven rays. 3 -Meditation upon the Union of the Void and the Land Hail to the Road of the White Shadow!

By this meditative projection of the White Shadow, the seven rays are unified and are radiat-ed in equality throughout each and every point of Being. All phenomena are pervaded with the omnipresent unity of light. This purifies all illusory perception - the myriad realms reflected upon the scales of the Dragon, and thereby establishes the Unbound Lumina of the Elder Gods as the universal ground of Being. The visualisation of endless white light should be perceived as identical to the Verdant Land: the universe realised as the extent of the Sacred Isle of Kahu. There is here an arcane alignment between the White Radix that unifies the seven aeonic paths of Time and the Verdant Radix as the middle path that emanates from amongst the seven chromatic rays of Space.

The visualisation of the limitless white light should be mentally tranformed to a visionary man-ifestation of the Sacred Isle and therein one should perceive oneself as the concordant embodi-ment of initiatory attainment. One should therefore imagine oneself as the Monarch of Kahu, resplendant at the centre of an incomparable paradise. One's naked body should be perceived as the very incarnation of Qayin Khu-Azhaka: the perfected summit-attainer of the Path. Within one's heart two deific forms should be visualised, silhouetted in sexual union within a sphere of white flame. These may be seen as the perfected bodies of the Seeker and the Divine Consort.

Even as it was revealed at the summation of the Khu Rite, so shall it be remembered. This development of the present visualisation serves well to protect and to empower the deified body of the practitioner. The circle of mountains is to be generated by an adaptation of the 'Hallowing' Praxis. Using mantic formul~ and incantation, the border of the mystical dominion is transformed and the forms of the mountains are called forth to appearance. Each mountain is intended as an image embodying the Elder Wisdom of Time. In its unity the circle of seven makes perceptible the hidden storehouses of knowledge which inform the Great Mysteries of the Sacred Year. The course of the visualisation should follow the text of the incantation below. The words of this enchantment should also serve as a means for the practitioner to make an offering of remembrance to the Double Octrigan Retinue of the Witch-fathers and Mothers.

This is achieved by the following means:-One focuses upon the sphere of white fire which is located at the heart, and therein one conjoins in the unique delight which is generated from the root-union: the coition of Cain and Calmena. One visualises that a black-golden seed oflight is born from the point of union between phallus and kteis. The luminous grain is seen to expand and transform, becoming a vast seven-limbed swastika: a whirling star with seven rays, each of a different colour. By the force of pure intent, this image is hurled outward from the heart toward the ten directions of space and through the three ways of time. As the Rainbow Gammadion is perceived to pass beyond one's physical form it should be imagined to divide and replicate, multiplying a million times as it is cast out through the myriad pores of the skin.

The basis of the Seeker's magical intent will thus be established as the means for the fruition and apprehension of the present arcanum and gnosis. The practitioner should now make a general entreaty to the Deities of the Faithful Retinue of Bha, bidding them to enter the Conclave of the Verdant Isle, transformed from their former appearance as the Guardians of all Mortal Worship, and herein to reveal themselves as the Tu-telars of the Paradaisal Gardens ofLa-Azhaka. 7.1 -The Preliminary Address Ye Lords and Ladies of the Dragons Horns!

With hand on heart and bloodied sheaf, as it is spoken, so let it become! Bilo Bilo Hu! Bha-Khu La-Azha! 7.2 -The Main Practice of Evocation: Summoning the Form-bodies of the La Arcanum Having made the general entreaty by means of the preliminary address, the practitioner should now undertake the central part of the practice: the Evocation of the Eight Witch-fathers and the Eight Witch-mothers as the Patron Deities of the Agapae. These sixteen divinities are the form-bodies of the La Mystery and are known as the Great Passionate Retinue of the Crooked Path. Their revelation to the Eye of the Seeker's Vision arises from the simultaneous union of his or her own meditative visualisations and the direct theophanic intercession of the deific powers. If approached through purity of aspiration, the imaginal appearance of the gods from within the mind of the practitioner and the divine revelation of the deities to that mind will emerge coetaneously, arising in a single epiphany from the ground of intrinsic gnosis. The working procedure of Ku-La is most wisely attenuated through the course of the twenty-eight occasions or fractions of time. The first fourteen digits of this period are used for the evo-cation of the Passionate Retinue. By vertu of this temporal gradation the deeds of summoning may be undertaken, step-by-step, according to the transvocatory cycles of Star and Moon. The first fourteen digits of the practice are thus to be identified with the bright and waxing fortnight of the Moon. For those of great cunning and of subtil artifice in the magical skills of drewary and venery, let this be interpreted and exacted by the inner cycle of practice. In accordant rhythm with the fourteen enbrightened digits of time, the Seeker shall call forth and attain coitive union with the form-bodies of the entire Witch-ward. This he shall accomplish in the ordained sequential order of the fourteen Dragon-points (see below -7.5 -'Turning the Wheel of the Great Passionate Retinue'). By this means he shall establish himself as the meeting-ground for the Divine Orgia -the Living Eden of the Ophidic Love-feast. The divinities of the Passionate Retinue are beckoned toward the practitioner through the gateways in the seven mountains. Name by name, power by power, each is entreated to enter and be manifest within the paradaisal garden ofKahu. Each form-body is visualised as a skyclad deity with four arms, carrying the especial emblems of individual power and dominion. The four hands of each Witch-mother respectively display a chalice, a vase of nectars, a hagstone, and the hand marked with her especial sigil. Correspondingly, the four hands of each Witch-father display a sword, a coloured flame, a thunderstone, the hand marked with his especial sigil. The appearances of the Sixteen Guardians, as previously visualised in the Bha Rite, are here transformed through the praxes of Ku-La to symbolically indicate the subtil means of the La Mysterium's attainment, to impart the Ineffable Cunning of the Agapae. The forms and colours of this emblematic array are detailed in the rubric given further below. 7.3 -Accomplishing the Divine Coition of the Form-bodies Because some digits are ruled by pairs of deities and others by singular forms, the method of the working procedure varies from day to day, digit to digit (see below 7.5, also the Table of Cor-respondences for the Unified Count ofBha). 56~"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Catching the Gifence Between Heartbeats Upon the occasions of the first, fourth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, and fourteeneth digits, one evokes and meditates upon a pair of deities, both gods manifesting outside of oneself and dis-playing the arcana of ecstasis through coitive union. One visualises that the union between the divine couple is attained through the outer means: sword unto chalice, flame unto vase, thun-derstone unto hagstone, and phallus unto kteis. At this juncture of the practice, when the outer means of union have been attained, an en-treaty should be made for the future revelation of the Force-bodies ofLa-Azhaka - the Sublime Draconick Deities of the Agapae. To augment this entreaty, an offering of physical pleasure may be used to empower the visionary manifestation of the deific union. The method and manner of this offering depends upon the predilection and skill of the practitioner Is (see below -7.4 -'Empowering the Vision of Ku-La'.). Once the outer means have been attained and the statement of concealed intent has been imparted, the vision of the deific union is tranferred by mindful skill to a specific internal lo-cation - a dragon-point within one's own body. The pair are thus perceived to be enshrined within a garden of pleasure situated within one's own divine form. This actuates the secret means of union: dragon-point to dragon-point. A seed of light is then visualised to emerge from within the dragon-point, being generated by the power of the coitive union between the summoned deities. The seed oflight, or lumine, empowers the dragon-point with the gnosis of the Divine Coition and consecrates the resonant part of the practitioner's body to the greater fulfilment of the La Rite. This empowerment is to be affirmed and sealed by a mantic formula: the star-name of the dragon-point conjoined with the suffix of the La phoneme. Once the lumine has been centred in the dragon-point, it is then imagined to consume and absorb the appearance of the summoned deities. The lumine is then perceived as a grain of pure magical power, an irradiant seed of the Magical Quintessence shining in the sorcerer's heart and therein unified with the root-union of Cain and Calmena. From the heart-adytum, the lumine is then offered to the land as a gift of fecundity, sown in the good earth of the Blood-acre like a grain of wheat in the furrow. This deed, repeated upon each digit throughout the course of the practice, implants the Field of the Agapce in readiness for the Harvest of the La Rite. Furthermore, the Seeker should reify the lumine by transferring the sensualised impetus of its empowerment through the hand, outward to visible form via the writing of automatic script and the medianimic transmission of pictorial image (see below 9.1). The accumulated power of the practice should be freely transmitted through hand and quill onto consecrated parchment. All sexual emissions of the body should be used to consecrate and charge such telesma, or else-'\"ise be consumed as the eucharist of the Divine Coition. The resultant talismanic forms of such deeds will reveal the eidola of the Force-bodies of La-Azhaka. l\"pon the second, third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, twelfth and thirteenth digits the process of the working varies from the above procedure in various manners. These digits are ruled over by single deific forms. In order to attain the perfect fulfilment of union with the Passionate Reti-nue, one must therefore serve as the consort to the presiding deity of these times. By word, deed and mindful entreaty, one evokes the ruling deity to manifest appearance in the Verdant Land. Once the form of the summoned deity has become stable in meditative equi-poise, one then visualises oneself as the divine consort thereof. When this has been achieved, one perceives oneself to be united in sexual embrace with the summoned Witch-guardian. The mystical coition is firstly accomplished through the five outer means as described above. The .:omemplative realisation of union may be directly empowered by the offering of carnal plea-"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Grimoriwn G)!nomo6ia Draco'Taus sure, either by auto-sexual or other methods. The union is then sealed by the two inner means of dragon-point alignment and hand-sigil enhallowment. The working procedure is thereafter the same as for the other digits of time. 7.4-Empowering the Vision of Ku-La Upon each fraction of the Moon's wheel, the Seeker may accomplish the deeds of the Divine Coition by three principal methods:-firstly, by flawless mindful contemplation of union - ei-ther alone or in harmony with a subtil or physical consort; secondly, by normative sexual inter-course with a physical consort; and thirdly, by masturbatory union with the subtil consort via the hand. These methods form the basis of Empowering the Vision, many and divers methods may be derived or elaborated therefrom. i) The Subtil Empowerment The first method - the Subtil Empowerment of the Vision of Ku-La -is the tranquil meditative communion between the Lover and the Beloved. Once the visualisation of the Divine Coition has been firmly established as the focus of mind, the intent of the practice - to realise the Force-bodies ofLa-Azhaka -must be stated. This intent should be offered to the visionary appearance of the deific union by a verbal declaration and by the internal motion of self-realising numen. One should thereafter reside in meditation upon the five outer points of coition, contemplating each mode of union by turns and dissolving all in the great delight of non-dual ecstasis. If undertaking the practice with a suitable companion, one may here engage in sexual union -joining phallus unto kteis without attachment to desire. The use of desire to assist initial stimulation may be deemed needful; this is to be used solely as the means for establish-ing the Posture of Union and should thereafter be transformed to empower and augment the meditative focus of intent. During the accomplishment of the Subtil Empowerment no loss of sexual fluids is permit-ted. All minor emissions should be absorbed by mouth or otherwise, or used as a means for consecrating talismans. The participants in this sacrament should embrace in unison of flesh and mind without attachment to self or carnal desire. The basic posture of coition should be as stated in 'Turning the Wheel of the Passionate Retinue', elsewise let it be as revealed in oneiric or waking revelation. If adhering to the cycle of the fourteen digits, each participant should mentally engage in the same visualisation, such as is prescribed for the working's temporal oc-casion. This is most important if each is to attain the full and equal completion of union with all deities of the retinue. Practitioners are here advised to adapt the procedure according to their predilection. A whispered chant-(Dragon-point+ La suffix) may be utilised by one or both participants to cohere and direct the focus of the mind to the points of union. Desire should thereby be transmuted to generate a mind of equipoise in ecstasis. Coition should be disengaged when the chant has reached a mutual apotheosis -whether in silence or shout, thereby displaying the completion of the seven points of union and signifying the subtil implanting of the lumine within the Verdant Land-the dominion of blissful integrality. 564"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"Catching the Gilence Between Heal'tl>eat~ ii-iii) The Direct Means of the Phallus and Kteis The second and third methods are to be applied with great wisdom and cunning. For by such means of direct sexual empowerment one may attain the Gnosis of the Ku-La Arcanum with extreme efficacy and swiftness, or else -by immersion in gross forms of self-pleasure -one may entangle and entrap oneself within states of needless attachment to desire. The Direct Means of the Phallus and Kteis utilises and harnesses the divers skills of venery in order to empower the Vision of Divine Coition and thereby establish the path for realising the hidden intent of the practice. When the basic visualisation of the unified Lord and Lady has been achieved, the practitioner Is should declare the intent as previously described, that is, to dissolve the male-female duality of the Divine Coition and attain the Visionary Revelation of the Sublime Draconick Deities of La-Azhaka. Having made this statement of intent, the appearance of one's inner contemplation should be addressed:-O' Lord and Lady of the Divine Coition! Blessed Mother and Father, conjoined in perfection upon the five points of delight! To empower a clear pathway for Thy manifest realisation, to open the way for the Gnosis of the Transcending Ones, I bid you to partake in the communion of the Direct Means -to share in the feast-offering of carnal pleasure. 0' Lord and Lady of the Divine Coition! May the Wisdom of La-Azhaka be clothed in the guise of reverie and venerie. Let every phantasie and deed of sexual delight become a means for the transmission of gnosis. May all orgia be the sacrament of our union! By the Stave of Al Faqri-al-Tan and the Graal of Al Qubbah-i-Hawwah, so mote it be! Having petitioned the Lord and Lady to accept all sexual pleasure as a medium for the transmis-5ion of magical knowledge and power, the mind should now turn with freedom from the visu-alisation of their Divine Coition; all aspiration and effort generated by the practice should be transformed into a feast of carnal delights. The Seeker's entirety should be absorbed in naught but the pleasures of the t1esh. If working with a partner, the sacrament of sexual union may be enjoyed through the divers permutations of posture and sensation. If practising alone, self-pleasure through masturbation should likewise become the all-obsessing means of devotion. Especial postures and means of venerie should be devised and enjoyed according to the nature and qualities of each digit and its corresponding dragon-point. At each and every height of plea-5UI'e, the mind should immediately be turned to the visualisation of the Divine Coition between the Lord and Lady; all sensation should be offered as the direct empowerment of the vision. In the first fortnight of practice it is counselled that this direct means of Empowering the \\-ision be utilised to exhaust and transmute the carnal desires of the practitioner. All fluidic and aethyric emissions resulting therefrom must be consumed as the sacramental feast of the Agapae, also used-as previously stated - to consecrate the telesmatic scripts and talismanic ridola automatising the ecstasis of union."},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomosia Draco'Taus 7.5 -Turning the Wheel of the Great Passionate Retinue Ye that have fulfilled the light-offering of the Rainbow Gammadion and have tilled the good earth of the Sacred Isle with rightful deeds of preparation, let such as ye come forth -day by day and step by step -to turn the Wheel of the Great Passionate Retinue. 0 -The Zeroth Digit of the Black Full Moon Upon the zeroth digit of time, being of subtil alignment unto the Dark of the Moon, the Seeker shall engage his mind in tranquil meditation upon the root-union of Cain and Calmena. He shall perceive them as both the primordial cause and the ultimate result of the practice - as the secret progenitors of Witch blood and as the firstborn kindred of the Passionate Retinue. Their forms are visualised as the shadow-fleshed images of the practitioner and consort, conjoined in the ecstasis of the black-golden lumina, encircled through all directions and times within the heart-adytum of white flame. In the Name of Qayin La-Azhaka, so mote it be. I -The First Digit Upon the first digit of time, being of subtil alignment unto the New Moon, the Seeker shall engage his mind in the evocation of Liliya and Mahazhael as the Lady and Lord of Al Shujah La. Turning unto the Hyporborean Place of Power, the Corpse-queen and her consort are to be called forth, even through the Hidden and Omipresent Gate of Al Qaf-i-Akh'taw. Liliya is to be visualised as the Queen of the High Sabbat, as the fairest of all women, en-dowed with the perfect signs of beauty. Her skin is bone-white, of irradiant and snow-bright purity. With her four hands she displays a black octagonal hagstone, a chalice wrought of black diamond, a crystal urn filled with the menarchal nectars of star and moon, and upon her hand, her sigil, aligned with the Arcanum of the Dragon's Tongue. Mahazhael is to be visualised as the Night-black Man, the Dark King of the High Sabbat. His skin is as midnight, taking in all light for its own adornment. His countenance is of perfect form, pervaded with divine strength and illumined with the radiance of knowledge in equilib-rium with intent. With his four hands he displays a white thunderstone, a black-golden sword of seven metals, a flame of black light, and upon the hand his sigil, aligned with the seal of the Dragon's Tongue. Both deities should be visualised standing naked upon a cloth of black silk. Upon the cloth and all around their feet are scattered a great array of bones -the bones of the Seeker and his Consort. When the forms of the Lord and Lady have been wrought through the union of outward imaginal projection and inward theophanic empowerment, mindful offerings should be made as an entreaty for wisdom and revelation: a petition for the Visions of the Agapae. The offer-ings should reveal the present transformation of the seven primal sacrifices, changed from their forms as bestowed in the Hu Rite to forms displaying qualities and natures germane unto the present arcanum. The offerings should be of seven-hued candles, menstrual blood, wreaths of flowering blackthorn and berry-laden mistletoe, sweet water, sensual perfume ... and so forth. Comparative offerings, using the appropriate and corresponding substances, are to be made upon each digit of the practice. 566"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Catching the Gilence Between HeaPtbeats The seven offerings should firstly be made by visualising their substantive forms manifesting upon the ground before the divine couple; and secondly through sacrifice - by perceiving each offering dissolving in turn into the hearts of the Lord and Lady. When the seven offerings have been accepted through absorption into the bodies of the Lord and Lady, the divine couple should be visualised conjoined in sexual embrace through the five outer means and the two inner means of union. The Vision of the Divine Coitus between Liliya and Mahazhael should be realised as the internal display of the Gnosis of Al Shujah La. This realisation should be sealed by offering the entirety of the visionary manifestation to the black-golden point of the root-union between Cain and Calmena. The Grand Witch-father and \\Vitch-mother, the sovereign embodiments of the ancestral lineages ofWitchblood, should thus be perceived as indivisible in nature from the firstborn man and woman , the primal incarnation oflnitiator and Initiatrix. Upon the lips of the Seeker let this realisation be manifest, in the Name of Azhdeha Al Shu-jah La, so mote it be!

In coition, the Lord assumes the superior position.

Turning within as to the secret place of empow-erment, he shall call forth the Bone-herd and his Consort from the heart of the Secret Mountain Al Qaf-i-Akht'taw. Both deities should be visualised as corpses of foul and repellent aspect. By the power of desire in transmutation the Seeker shall embrace both, both as his self and as his own consort. The Lady carries a hagstone of innumerable sides, a chalice wrought of seven jewels, a vase containing the fourteenth and last nectar, and upon the hand is her own sigil, corresponding co the Arcanum of the Dragon's Tail. The Lord carries a thunderstone of sharp black obsidian, a sword of black gold, a flame of seven colours, and displays his own sigil upon the hand, also aligned to the Arcanum of Al Ghauzar. Both deities stand upon a motley cloth of many hues, upon which the flayed skins of children are laid out -as sheets upon a virgin marriage-bed. In coition, both deities are superior by turns. At the culmination of this vision, most especially if empowered by the Direct Means of the Phallus and Kteis, the faces of the Lord and Lady are to be seen as masked-each covered with a mirror to reflect the countenance of the Beholder. This completes the Cycle of Visualisations for the Fourteen Enbrightened Digits of Time 8 -Perfecting the Union of the Father and the Mother within the Grain of Light . .\\s previously stated, when the Vision of Divine Coition has been attained through the five outer means of union, its visualised appearance is to be mindfully transferred to the first place of inner union: the Deific Vision is perceived to be located within a dragon-point of the Seeker's body. This inner union is empowered by the use of the appropriate man tic utterance, that is, the name of the dragon-point conjoined with the phonemic suffix of LA. By visualising the Deific Vision within the internal shrine of a dragon-point and by empower-ing that visualisation with the appropriate man tic formula, a seed of irradiant creative power is generated. This should be visualised and revered as the very seed of the Elder Gods. It is herein referred to as the lumina, the Grain of the Black Light. The following enchantment may be used to affirm this stage of the practice. Elating in the Loud-thundered Whisper of every Seduction, I join with my Gods in the Lychfeast of Desire. 571"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomosia Draco'Tau.s (Use mantic formula of the digit being worked, repeat fourteen times) Drink deep, O' Existence, from the Milk of the Dragon's fang!

Bilo Bilo Hu -Ku-La Azha! 9 -Placing the Landmark When the lumine has been generated through the first means of inner union, its scintillant point is perceived to transmit the Deific Vision within the hand. To attain equilibrium in both hands alike, it may be deemed wise to use a separate hand during each lunar fortnight of one's practise. Once the lumine has been perceived to enbrighten both dragon-point and hand-location, it is then visualised that the Vision of Divine Coition is dissolved into its light. The lumine is then visualised to shine forth from the heart-adytum, from the place of the root-union. Working by working, digit by digit, this unites the deities of the Passionate Retinue within the Vision of the Primal Initiator and Initiatrix. When dragon-point, hand-location and heart-adytum have received the empowerment of the lumine, the energetic force of Ku-La should be transmitted to talismanic form. The lumine is thereby sown in the potentiated field of magical transformation (see below -Consecrating the Fourteen Talismans of Azh 'rakinah). Thereafter, the reification of the lumine is to be mystically perfected by visualising its trans-mutation into a simple grain of wheat. In this form it is imagined that the lumine is cast forth into the expanse of the Verdant Land - sown into the body of the Blood-acre in preparation for the Secret Harvest-tide of the Great Rite of La. The sowing of the lumine into the ground beneath the Seeker's manifest appearance is con-sidered to be identical in essence with the concluding phase of the visualisation: the return of all to the primordium of Gnosis. Shining forth from the land, the lumine is expanded to consume the entirety of one's visu-alisation - to absorb the Ring of Seven Mountains, the Verdant Land and the Divine Body of Qayin Khu-Azhaka. The lumine is thereby dissolved into the boundless expanse of the lnitiatic Mind. 57~"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Catching the Gilence Between Heill'tbeat~ The divers steps of the lumine's motion are collectively known as 'Placing the Landmark'.

This is to be achieved through the mindful concentration of the lumine -the scintillant numina of the Black Light - within talismanic points of manifestation. Upon the fourteen digits of time's bright fortnight, let the Seeker become as the Scribe of an unbound enchiridion, transcribing the empowerments of Divine Coition onto squares of parch-ment - thus to collate a deck of fourteen cards. This may be accomplished by divers means of artistry and using divers media of expression, such as coloured inks, sexual fluids, blood, can-dle-soot, and ashes -most favourably the stellar grain from the hearth of the Phoenix-vessel's sacrifice. The fourteen talismans should be wrought with the intent to reify the Force-bodies of the Ag-apae, to manifestly foreshadow eidola - such as may serve during the dark fortnight of time as points of communion with the Concealed Retinue: the Fourteen Secret Deities of Azh'rakinah. If so desired, other objects such as gemstones or disks of metal may be consecrated during this stage of the practice. These may be utilised as subtil mirrors for the earthen reflection of time's many hues -that the Eye of Vision may behold the shimmering light of eternity, cast forth to each moment from the Dragon's scales. 573"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Taus Upon the especial night of its making, each talisman should be bathed in the visible light of the Moon and in the secret irradiance of its draconick star.

The steps of this initiatic journey attenuate the eroto-aesthetic transvocation of the Dragon-body in preparation for the Great Rite of La. Digit by digit, the praxes of the dark fortnight impart the theophanic revelation of the fourteen draconick power-zones as the inner deific assembly of La-Azhaka. The Divinities of this Concealed Retinue are known and revered as the Prime-val Tameless Ones, the Force-bodies of Divine Sexuality, whose very nature displays unto the Seeker's mind the perpetually changing manifestation of pure creative numen. The intent of the dark fortnight's pilgrimage is to unveil the hidden nature ofKahu, to reveal the primordium of force underlying the substantive formation of the Verdant Land in unity with the self-realisation of the Initiatic Body as the Sole Child of the Agapae. In journeying through the enshadowed time of Ku-La, the Seeker should aspire to become fully mindful in the indivisible knowledge of his self-existence as the Domain of Magical Sensualisation, to realise himself as the Sacred Isle of Creation. For the body of the Path-attainer is itself the Kingdom of the Antient One, the royal dominion of Qayin Azhaka. Therein the soul of the initiate is en-shrined as the hermaphroditic monarch, self-begotten through the fourteen unions of Witch-father and Witch-mother, self-transcending through unceasing realisation of the Dragon-body. The purification of the Land, the very enhallowment of the Sacred Isle, is identical with the re-cognizance of oneself as the destined heir to the ancestral and procreative wisdom of the Crooked Path. By vertu of this understanding, the living flesh of the practitioner is to be perceived as the Eden of the Sabbatic Orgia, as the paradaisal location for the endless love-play between God and Goddess. Having attained to this foundation of the Ku-La Mystery, the aim is to transcend the duality of Lord and Lady, to reify the Gnosis of the First-born Initiate as the perpetuity of self-transformation. It is thus that the umbrose steps of Ku-La lead the practitioner into the Fourteen Forbidden Gardens of Illimitable Ecstasie. For these are the Domains of the Tameless Ones, the primordial states of Being, wherein the divine forces of the Agapae are liberated from the static boundaries of nature to partake in the continuum of the All-transmutable. Therein the stasis of carnal form is perceived to rise and fall in endless permutations, evolving and dissolving in constant flux, to and from the protean matrix of ever-changing flesh. This esotery of the Dragon-body is to be attained by the Transvocatory Enchantment called 'The Communion oflmmortal Hearts'; by such means the Primeval Tameless Ones shall be called forth through the fourteen talismans of Azh'rakinah. 576"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"Catching the Gifence Between Heartbeats Basis of Working Procedure Upon each digit of the dark fortnight the working procedure should follow the same prelimi-nary process as for the waxing phase of time, that is, one should utilise and suitably apply the first six stages of the praxis, from o to 6, to affirm the basis and stability of one's work. Having accomplished the sixth stage, the Rainbow Gammadion being cast forth to the hori-zon of Mind as an offering oflight, one should place the appropriate talismanic focus upon the shrine of the Dragon-vessel. Thus, one by one through the digits of the waning fortnight, the telesmatic images of the fourteen unions are to be utilised as the visible foci of conjuration. The Talismans of Azh'rakinah hereby serve to fore-shadow the Concealed Deities of the Agapae: to open the way for the bodies of Force to arise from the forms of the Divinely Conjoined Witch-guardians. Fixating the Eye of Vision upon the illumined talisman, one should unfetter the heart and open oneself to the ravishment of the Antient Serpent - surrendering all to the embrace of the Dragon's coils. The flesh of the Seeker should thuswise be offered as the aggregate of ev-ery mortal desire, the blood-sacrifice of all Living to the Love-feast of Divine Sexualities. This should be mindfully affirmed by the imaginal emanation of a great and powerful oblation: the visualised offering of a skull-bowl, filled with the disgorged and beating hearts of the sixteen Witch-guardians. Brought forth from the circle's edge by the returning power of the Rainbow Gammadion, the heart-offering of the Passionate Gods should be perceived to dissolve into the talisman, en-dowing the shrine of the Dragon-vessel with countless blessings and purifying the mind of the initiate with radiant empowerments of wisdom and understanding.

Digit by digit, the arcanum of the foundation-offering is revealed through the oblation of the Seeker's own heart.

Within the compass of this divine ourobophagia, the quintessentialised heart of existence is ensorcelled by the Hand of the Royal Arte and, through the manifold deeds of initiation, it is hereby sacrificially enshrined in the secret embrace of the Dragon's coils. Sealed within the adytum of the Sacred Vessel the tameless heart shall be liberated, be possessed without attachment in the silent interstice of Gnosis. As a living jewel of innumerable faces, shining with the infinite refractions of passion, the heart shall thuswise be poised in equilibrium, all-expansive in fetterless ipseity, ever-becom-ing and ever self-dissolving in the ceaseless moment between creation and destruction. By the accomplishment of this Mystery may the unspoken ways of Ku-La attain a voice in the Realisation of the Immediate Path. May the Way be opened between the heartbeats of the Undying Gods. Let the Silence be spoken: the Paean of Ekstasis made Flesh! The Mystery of Embracing within the Dragon's Coils, also known as 'the Rite of the Draku-Lillitu', is counted as the fifth Rite of the Double-ouroboros to be celebrated within the circle of the year and the day. The ordained occasion for its practise is customarily held to be Lammas, the first day in the month of August. This date is held to mark the first harvest-tide -the day of reaping, when that which lives and grows upon the World-field is laid low and the grain of all flesh is transformed, even as the wheat into the first loaf of the Living Bread. In verity, the occasion of the rite's exaction depends wholly upon the time taken for the prerequisite fulfilment of the preparatory praxes - the formulae of 'Catching the Silence be-tween Heartbeats'. For it is imperative, without exception, for all who would undertake this rite to have completed the entirety of the Ku-La praxes - to have fulfilled the fourteen unions of Time's brightness and to have wrought the fourteen talismans of the Umbrose Pilgrimage. When these tasks have been accomplished the Pathway shall be opened into the Circle of the Agapae, the Gate of the Azure Interstice of Time shall be revealed. To all others, the Way is closed.

This should firstly be dipped in water to signify the washing away of all bodily imperfections: the outer preparation of the land for the realisation of its inward transformation. The flower should then be breathed upon seven times, each time with the words: KA-1-AZHA-HU! (N.B. - KA-I' is spoken whilst inhaling; 'AZHA' whilst retaining the breath; and 'HU' whilst exhaling.) When the first seven breaths have been offered, the lustrated flower is used to sprin-kle water over the vessels. The following charm is then recited: Let the clouds he banished by the empowerment of breath: the Sky-armour of the Agapae made pure without blemish. Naked without shame, bereft of Falsehood's Garment of Sin, we offer ourselves unto ourselves, that the Land Within may he revealed ... The practice of 'Donning the Sky-armour' is then implemented in the following manner:-the flower is breathed upon a further seven times (numbered 8-14 below), each time with a differ-ent magical utterance. After each separate utterance the flower is touched to a specific bodily location. With the eighth breath, say: 1-AZHA-HU Touch the flower to the genital region.

By this means of insuffiatory and spoken empowerment the flower is infused with magical nu-men. Thus consecrated as the vehicle for the conveyance of power from spirit to matter, the flower is used to indicate and consecrate the locations of seven crossroad-points within the cen-tral axis of the body. This action reveals the Heptanomis Within: the seven zones of internal empowerment hidden within the Tridentate Pillar of the Dragon's Spine. The upright path of the spine conceals the threefold channel through which the droplets of stellar elixir ascend, descend and attain equilibrium through the mobile agency of magical force: the Serpent within the Sheaf of Al Thuba'. The method of consecration used here reveals the path of ascendant rarefaction. This being the route of the Serpent rising through the interstitial 'knots', or vortices of power, which are opened in the physical body to function as crossroads of mediation between the seven circles of Time. Correspondingly, the sevenfold attributions for the descendant path of the Serpent's temporal reification are established during the Praxes of Honing the Sword and Lustrating the Skull-graal.

As the sacrament of sexual fluids, the wine is symbolic of the visible and invisible emissions from the phallus and kteis.

In making the offering at the zeroth point, wine is poured around the skull and upon the trident, and is then partaken of by each initiate in turn. Secondly, the Quadriga shall partake of bread. As the sacrament of flesh, this is symbolic of the cannibalistic feast of the sorcerer upon the bodies of his gods, parents, lovers, companions and children. This signifies the sacrificial detachment from the worldly bonds of belief, ancestry, marriage, fraternity and progeny. In initiatic terms this may be also interpreted as the sacrificial \"ingestion' and transcendence of one's deity, initiator, ritual consort, brethren and initiands. In making this offering, the bread is broken and some wine is poured over it; this 'reddens' the bread to form the offering of'meat' or flesh. Thirdly, the Quadriga shall partake of 'breath'. This signifies the offering of all spoken word throughout the duration of the second circle's rite. Fourthly, the Quadriga shall partake of gesture. This signifies the offering of all deeds within the second circle. Fifthly, the Quadriga shall partake of 'sexual union'. This signifies the sacramental indwelling of the Quadriga - in mind, body and spirit - in the Visions of the Tameless Ones. The five affirmations are maintained throughout the duration of the pilgrimage within the sec-ond circle.

Divided amidst the hands of the covine the other requisities of Arte - such as are needful for the accomplishment of the pilgrimage -must also be carried: an empty wooden or metal bowl for the burning of the talismans, a bowl of blue powder, cords, bread, wine, incense, perfume, flowers and so forth. 618"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of La Entering the Fourteen Forbidden Gardens of Azh'ra-kinah As is customary, each node of the spiral earth-sign will already be marked by a simple cross-signing of powder and with an unlit candle. Likewise, according to custom, the general officia-tion of the fourteen points will be divided amongst the initiates of the Quadriga. The basic procedure for working upon each point is as follows:-1) The Dragon-vessels should be set upon the earth around the point. The officiant will then light the candle and begin the appropriate mantic chant: star-name+ La suffix. 2) Using the blue powder, the officiant shall trace an arc backwards from the base of the candle and into the centre of the circle - to the base of the trident-stave (see diagram). This deed delineates the path of the sky-dance: the road of congress between the 'silence' of the Voidful Adytum and the 'heart-beat' or node of the Dragon-body. At the fulfilment of the rite, the fourteen lines of the sky-dance depict the translocation of the complete deific form to the zeroth point of the Azure Interstice; the Body Entire is thereby realised in the silence benveen heartbeats. 3) From the altar of the Voidful Adytum the officiant shall pick up a single fragment of the broken mirror, and therewith he shall return upon the path of the sky-dance to the shrine of the Dragon-point. At the shrine, the fragment of mirror is passed through the candle-flame, thereby consecrat-ing it as the hypostatic token of the mystical lumina. It is then to be empowered by the breath of all initiates; the act of insuffiation serving to transmit the numen of the man tic chant. Finally, the shard is to be buried by the officiant -about a hand's breadth in front of the candle. The burying of the mirror-shard within the earth signifies the creation of a twofold gate, a thor-oughfare, or crossroads-point within the body of flesh. A dual means of ex-stasis and en-trance is thus made for the Seeker: the double-way of La-Azhaka. This is the co-emergent path of the ~lystery, leading both within and beyond the flesh, transfiguring the matrix of Self and Other into the realm of the Tameless One-annulling all duality within the coils of the Dragon's se-cret embrace. A simultaneous path of ingress and egress is hereby opened for the trans carnation of the Concealed Draconick Deity. This is revealed by the sigildry of the Sky-dance as the cause-way of magical transference emanating from beyond the Voidful Adytum. Upon the shrine of the Dragon-point, the mirror directs the causeway into the body of the circle; the deific power impresses itself into the circle of manifestation and is reified through word and deed as the resurgent power of liberated physicality. The mirror-shard functions as a point of reflectivity benveen Time and Timelessness, between the stellar foci of Beyond and the theandric zones of the Dragon-body empowered from Within. Throughout the course of the rite, the magical on-lay of the mirror-fragments establishes the trysting-grounds of the Agapae: the Forbidden Gardens of Congression between the initiate and the Deities of the Concealed Retinue. The Gardens are called 'forbidden' because none may enter therein except through the vehicular medium of the Draconick Form: none may enter Eden save through the Old Serpent's mouth. In further explanation of this naming, it may be revealed that there is a teaching of magical lore which proscribes the entrance of mortal man into the realms of gods like unto the Tameless Ones, and similarly it is deemed unlaw-ful to call them forth from their native abodes into the world of mortal man. The Gardens of"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomo£Sia Draco'TaU£S Azh'ra-kinah are therefore 'forbidden'; for whosoever enters therein passes into the domains of transversion between the Body of Man and the ingressing powers of the Void-the Servants of the Elder Gods. 4) When the mirror-shard has been buried, an empty bowl of wood or metal is placed upon the earth above it. Within this receptacle the officiant shall kindle charcoal and incense. Additional offerings of perfume, flowers, bread and wine may be strewn around the edge of the bowl. 5) Maintaining the man tic chant, the initiates should then reveal the appropriate talismans of the dragon-point. These should be held in the hand or laid upon the earth around the bowl. Each talisman is used by its maker as the primary focus for attaining the Vision of the Tameless One. By divers means let the Quadriga enter the Garden of Azh'ra-kinah:-by scrying into the depths of the talismanic image; by the subtil or the reveal'd feast upon bread and wine; by the enchantment of mantia; by profound and silent reverie; by song; by musick and by dance ... by abandoning all to the secret embrace of the Dragon's coils. Through the mirror of time let this be reflected; by divers means let the Visions be revealed. 6) When directed by the hand of divine revelation and when so prompted by the very heart of aspiration, let each initiate sacrifice their talisman within the bowl of burning incense. Upon the tongue of flame, let the telesma be offered as a sweet smelling savour unto the Gods. By this means the myriad djinn of Ku-La shall be released into the Round Dance of the Agapae and likewise shall the divers investments of the Seeker's passion be loosed from the fetters of sigil and image-thus to attain freedom in the Eden of Hidden Delight! 7) When augured by the dying of the flames within the bowl, the officiant shall guide the man tic chant to a whisper or a shout of consummation. With the words -BILO BILO HU-LA AZHA KA, the covine shall bind and seal the enchantment. As these words are decreed, each initiate should tie a knot in a personal cord. This creates the rosary of the Mystery and visibly affirms the deed of binding. Once tied, the knot should be touched to the ashes of the burned talismans. It should then be pressed to the appropriate dragon-point in the body and to the corresponding digit of the hand. This 'plants' the grain of the lumina into the Seeker's magical body, thus seeding the good earth ofKahu with the spate of the Antient Dragon. All deeds being accomplished the Quadriga shall move onwards from point to point, shrine unto shrine, through the fourteen gardens of Azh'ra-kinah. The fourteen mantic formulae of the pilgrimage are as follows:-Upon the point of the Tongue:-Upon the point of the Left Eye:-Upon the Point of the Right Eye:-Upon the Point of the Head:-Upon the Point of the Left Horn:-Upon the Point of the Right Horn:-Upon the Point of the Spine:-6~o ALSHUJAHLA AL TANNIN LA AL DARAKSHAN LA ALHALKALA AL TAIS LA AL SA'EQAH LA AL LATA'IFA LA"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"Upon the Point of the Left Hand:-Upon the Point of the Right Hand:-Upon the Point of the Left Wing:-Upon the Point of the Right Wing:-Upon the Point of the Left Leg:-Upon the Point of the Right Leg:-Upon the Point of the Tail:-AL DHI'BAN LA AL AUHAKAN LA AL BORAKAN LA ALDHIHLA AL THU'BAN LA ALQADAMLA ALGHAUZARLA The Rite of La When the Fourteen Enchantments of La have been fulfilled the covine shall proceed with the formal procedure of the rite.

Those who have passed through the Fourteen Great Ordeals of the Crooked Path may utilise its arcana as and when deemed appropriate by the unique and secret ordinance of intent. The outer purpose of the practice is to support and accelerate the Direct Realisation of Gnosis by attaining the power of magical fearlessness. This is to be accomplished through the Arcane Conjunction of Perfidy and Purity. The 'perfidy' is the method, which assumes the outward as-pect of adversity and contrariety. The 'purity' is the clarity of the magical wisdom which main-tains the secret direction of the Seeker's intent. Their conjunction is attained when the practice imparts profound and spontaneous insight into the sublime nature of the Crooked Path by cut-ting through its outward appearance of conflict and opposition. This Direct Realisation of the Path liberates the practitioner and bestows the virtue of magical courage. This in turn augments and supports the ability of the practitioner to sustain the indwelling of his or her consciousness within the ever-deviating continuum of the ophidian initiatory current. By the austere embrace of outward adversity great empowerment is cohered into the direc-tion of purified intent. By the exactitude of intent the oppositional nature of the Path's ordeals is transmuted; the poisons and nectars of the Serpent become the elixirs of wisdom. The Union of Perfidy and Purity opens the lumina of the Perfect Mind, the gate of realisation through which the perpetuity of initiatic one-pointedness is transmitted. Through the mithraditic imbibing of the Serpent's potent numen, the Seeker attains - task by task - to the Mystical Body directly reifying the Draconick Gnosis. The inner purpose of the practice is accordingly to refine the Mind of Sorcerous Intent, thereby to inculcate the gnostic state of being wherein one may consciously utilise the inner nature of the nectars and poisons imbibed through the various ordeals of the Path. In undertaking this practice a specialised form of ritual domain is introduced to the discipline of the aspirant; for therein the Knowledge -the Arcanum ofl-LA-T ANN A T-AL-1-shall be granted to the Mind Unknowing of Terror. THE SECRET RITUAL DOMAIN: the Triangular Field of Sorcerous Ferocity T As revealed to the Scribe in dreaming as 'The Charnel-ground of the Black Goat', and as af-firmed 'neath the sun by the wisdom of scriptural transmission, so this matter is here revealed unto the Seeker as the Arcanum of the Secret Ritual Domain: 'The Field of Sorcerous Ferocity'. This form of sacred area is to be demarcated in mind as a vast three-sided charnel ground, a fearful meadow of ashen earth-fire-swept in the wake of the Agapae's harvest. Three colossal swords of black fire are to be visualised, one at each of the three corners of the field. The blades of each sword pierce the earth -the substantive media of manifestation -and fix the power of the limitless mind to the spatial and temporal boundaries of one's magical intent. Between 6~6"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"The Wreath of Gwen Laughing Gkulla each sword, fierce and ragged bolts of lightning should be imagined to course, crackling and searing to form unbroken threads of magical splendour - thus to bind and define the focus of the Mage's work. One should conceive of the triangular field as symbolically representing the female pubic region and correspondingly perceive one's own form, seated or standing upright therein, to sig-nify the male generative organ. In these terms the mindful self-location of the Seeker within the Field of Sorcerous Ferocity unites the divine phallus and kteis of Azh'ra-kinah, and thus sym-bolises the harnessing of all sexual powers within the transcendent vehicle of purified desire. In matter, that is, in terms of physical ritual performance, the Field of Sorcerous Ferocity is to be marked out upon the ground using three nails, or staves, connected with strands of coloured thread to form a three-sided enclosure. The colour of the threads depends upon the nature and time of the practice to be undertaken. For the present purpose, the praxis of La-Tan, they should be of various shades ranging from blue to indigo. The border of the triangle may be further demarcated by laying thorned branches and interwoven vines upon the ground outside the perimeter of the thread-barrier. In terms of its size, the dimensions of the area are not fixed and thus it may be as large or small as required. The dream-given name of this ritual enclosure -'The Charnel-ground of the Black Goat' -ruggests an identity between its dark triangular form and the tricornic shape of a horned goat's head. Thus, when seated within this field of power, the sorcerer symbolically resides between che horns of the beast's severed head. According to the arcane cipher of the Path, he is thereby poised in self-mastery between the double-way of the lightning-bolt and the flaming torch. He has become the atavistic embodiment of both Spontaneous Realisation and Constant Progres-5ion: the Upright Path of the Black Light, shining between the horns of duality. As further revealed through oneiric vision, the Plot of the Black Goat may be used as a shrine for purposes of general propitiation. The triangle is to be marked out as aforementioned and used to contain divers offerings of flowers, bread, wine and so forth. In this form, the threefold plot may be used as a means of supplication and thanksgiving to the spirits and deities within the general locale of a chosen area. If several such shrines are made in the immediate area surrounding the greater domains of the Blood-acre or the Double-ouroboros, they will assume the important function of acting as points of mediation for the ingressing powers invoked through the execution of grand ceremo-nial procedures, also as spirit-traps for attracting and coercing elemental forms and wandering ghosts. In this manner four distinct shrines may be traced out, each in its appropriate airt of the mm pass around the main ritual area. These may be used prior to the working of a Great Rite, when it is customary for the initiates of the Quadriga to dwell apart from the Double-ouroboros in a solitary period of preparation. In the practice of La-Tan it is needful for the practitioner to go forth from the company of his fellows and enter into some strange and terrifying place - whether in mind or in matter. There he must establish himself within the Field of Sorcerous Ferocity and undertake the Dance of Fearless Wisdom upon the Wreath of the Seven Laughing Skulls. Let this be his method ..."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo~ia Draco'Taus Basic Working Procedure o-Establishing the Charnel-ground of the Black Goat. 1 -The Visualisation of the Ritual Seat of Power: the Throne of the Heresiarch. 2 -The Visualisation of the Tree: the Spine as the Trident-stave of Al Thuba'. 3 -The Emanation of the Seven Boughs of Light from the crossroads-points of the perpendicular axis. 4 -The Fruition of the Boughs: the Emanation of the Seven Skulls. s -The Illumination of the Seven Skulls, being the ignition of the Seven Burning-grounds \\\\ith the Sigils of the Great Rites. 6-The Laughter of the Seven Skulls: Attaining the Body of Qayin Latan-azhaka. 7 -The Vision of the Horse-headed Stave: the Call to the Steeds of the Four Watchers. 8-The Thundercrack of Dissolution: the Cursing Scream ofMeimun. 0 -Establishing the Charnel-ground of the Black Goat Walk from the world of ordinary appearance as if journeying to one's death; go forth into the Place of Exile.

He should then formally establish the ritual seat of his power by visualising that he is sitting upon the skeletal remains of his own mother and father, locked together as in sexual embrace. The following enchantment may be used to affirm this:-O' Ashen earth below me, be Thou transformed by my words of enchantment into the Throne of the Intercessor: the bone-carven chair of the H eresiarch s Power.

Finally, the Seat should be perceived as one's own remains, sealed in coital embrace with the skeleton of one's personal ritual consort. Upon the Throne of Mortal Desire's Transcendence the body of the practitioner should be realised as the divine cerulean body of Qayin La-Azhaka. 2 -The Visualisation of the Tree Having established the ritual area and the poise of one's being, the practitioner should visualise his spine as the Sacred Tree Al Thuba'.

In summation of method, one begins by mindfully enshrining the Dragon-vessel to the North of the primary ritual domain. Within the vessel one envisions an expansive tract of newly harvested land - a vast golden-grey field of corn stubble. In the midst of the field one's own shadow is then projected as an immense silhouetted form and is held in the mindful poise of sorcerous belief as the body of one's adversary. The term 'adversary' may here be interpreted in three ways. Firstly, as the collective assembly of worldly enemies - unified in mind as the aggregation of all mundane obstacles and ills, such as may restrict or threaten the practitioner's secular livelihood. Secondly, it may be interpreted as the aggregation of all that may obstruct the practitioner in the exercise of his magical path and practice. Thirdly, it may be interpreted as the aggregation of all internal flaws, weaknesses and self-limitations within the flesh, mind, and spirit of the practitioner. To signify the attainment of magical domination the image of the adversary is perceived to be imprisoned within the vessel, sealed within the boundary of its indomitable power. This ac-complished, the vessel is mindfully transformed into a great burning-ground whose flames 'de-stroy' the body of the adversary, thereby dissolving the perceived appearance of the profane in the illuminous Fire of Change. This act of magical 'destruction' may firstly be interpreted as the literal ruination of outer and worldly enemies; secondly, as the removal of obstructions from one's external path of practice; and thirdly, as the inner process of self-transmutation, whereby one's weaknesses are overcome and one's internal flaws are removed. All three interpretations should be unified and perceived as the means to liberate negativities from their former condi-tion and return the profane to the primordial state of all-transmutability. By vertu of this uni-tive realisation the imaginal projection of the practitioner's shadow is transfigured into a divine form: the Shadow Deity of Secret Poison. To accomplish this stage of the practice the Seeker should visualise the flames of the burning-ground permeating the projected body of his shadow. He should engage in the belief that the flames are purifying the adverse nature of all opposing forces through the medium of the shade, thereby causing it to become the essence of secret poison and to assume the appearance of a di-vine body of magical endarkenment. In mind this should manifest as the shadow consolidating itself into a form of abyssal nigresence. The process of transformation is then applied to the seven skulls. Each, in turn, is perceived to contain and imprison a form or force connected to or derived from the adversary: his chil-dren, livestock, gods, birth-stars, lovers, patron spirits and ancestors. Again this may be inter-preted in three ways according to the application of the rite. Firstly, one may interpret these aspects as belonging to the mundane life of worldly enemies; secondly, as forms or forces ob-structing the exercise of one's magical path and practice; and thirdly, as the respective internal forces of adversity. The 'children' of the adversary may thus be interpreted as the progeny of an enemy, as the slanderous actions of a profaner, or as the internal consequences of a personal flaw or weakness."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Grimorium G2nomoeia Draco'Taus Once established as a domain of internment for a specific opposing form or power of adversity, each skull is transformed into a charnel-field for the purpose of accomplishing the alchymic action of magical 'destruction'. By the utterance of enchantments, by the mantic vibration of seed-phonemes and by the mindful emanation of sigils, the skulls are 'ignited'. Each in turn is transformed into a burning-ground whose flames will consume and transmute the Assembly of the Averse. In the North I behold Thee, O' Dracotai! Adamantine Vessel of Azhtaya-Latan!

As this is perceived the Shadow - the primary eidola of the Divinely Transformed Adversary - should be seen to emanate seven images of itself from the heart of the Dragon-vessel, thereby manifesting simultaneously in each charnel-ground, laughing and dancing amid the flames of magical destruction. The seven seed-phonemes should here be chanted several times over to empower the Dance of the Demonic Assembly of Shadows. If able, one should transform the sound of the chant into the laughter of the Shadows' dance. The following incantation should then be used to strengthen and develop the vision:-"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)!nomoaia Draco'Taus O' Circle of Dancing Shadows!

The demonic assembly of shadow-bodies and the visions of the seven burning-grounds should now be resorbed, form by form, into the primary Shadow-body within the heart of the Dragon-vessel.

Once the divine form of the One Shadow has been attained in the eye of vision, the Seeker should strengthen his own self-realisation as the divine form of Qayin La-Azhaka. Thus the body of the Seeker is perceived within the ritual domain as the azure sky-formed deity of La and the One Shadow is perceived within the sacred vessel as the midnight-blue deity of secret poison. Having accomplished the vision of this duality, the Seeker should visualise the vessel to be absorbed into his heart and therewith the body of the One Shadow. Once the vessel has been enshrined within the heart, the Shadow of midnight-blue should be mindfully expanded and mingled with the azure hue of the Seeker's flesh. By this means one attains to the divine body of Qayin Latan-Azhaka. The flesh of the practitioner is now to be visualised as being formed wholly of indigo light, shining darkly with the iridescence of a peacock's throat. For it is said in the lore of the Royal Arte, that the peacock alone amidst all living creatures may eat of the World's Poisons and yet never die there-of. The beauteous colour of its throat displays the magical light of Utmost Pu-rity - the birth-stain of the World's transmutation. 638"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"'Ihe WFeath of Geven Laughing Gkulle THE ASSUMPTION OF Q_AYIN LATAN-AZHAKA In the mirror of mine own skull I behold the Conqueror of Tame less Eden!

Thou art purified with the bitter blood of enemies, beauteous in the light of death. Thou hast become theAll-Envenom'd One, the Silent Herald of Azh'rail! Mindfully residing in the divine body of Qayin Latan-Azhaka, the Seeker should contemplate the secret triunitive nature of the nectars and poisons of the Crooked Path:-In the outer interpretation of the mysteries the poisons are to be understood as the impurities which may afflict the practitioner; the nectars are accordingly perceived as the remedies which can heal and overcome impurity. By the inner reckoning of these mysteries the 'nectars' are to be understood as the subtil and benevolent issue -the tinctures and aethyric numina -emanating from the Dragon-stars to the Mind of the Seeker via the medium of the flesh, most especially through the oracular gate-way of the sexual mouth. The poisons are conversely to be perceived as the baneful numina of the Dragon, as the elixirs and mumia used in acts of destruction and harm. By vertu of the secret interpretation the nectars may be understood to embody those aspects of being which 'sweeten' the practitioner's resolve, weakening the austerity of his self-chosen discipline. They may thus be comprehended as the magical forces which beautify or mask the nature of impurities, thereby encouraging their proliferation within the path. Conversely the poisons may be understood to embody the forces of intent which have the power to cut through and annul all weaknesses - to unveil and slay the inherent aspects of the adversary. In accord with the nature of the Crooked Path it is deemed needful for the Seeker to cast himself into the battle-ground of attainment - to wilfully enter situations of adversity and therein confront all and aught which will necessitate the honing of intent. Thus, by the deliberate imbibing of nectars, the practitioner consciously draws himself into that which conflicts with the direction and nature of his intent. Embracing greater and greater circumstances of adversity the practi-tioner is forced to exert himself to greater and greater degrees in discipline. The true 'nectars of immortality' are therefore the powers which force the Seeker to attain fearlessness upon the Path; for in drinking deeply from the cup of self-affliction one must become the All-Poisoned One - thus to dispel the influence of sweet-seeming impurity or else fall from the way of attain-ment. The greater the adversity the greater the empowerment ofLatan. The poisons and nectars of the path may thus be interpreted in three ways; let these be uni-fied in attaining the Body of Qayin Latan-Azhaka."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"Grimo.rium G)!nomotSia D.raco'TaUtS Thrice-hail to the All-Poisoned One, enthroned in the Eyrie of Shining Bones.

This should firstly be accomplished by visualising the spine as an upright pillar of black light. Then, to accomplish the resorption of the seven boughs of wisdom into the centres of the spine, the transliminal mantia should once again be recited. As each mantic formula is pronounced, its corresponding path oflight should be indrawn to the appropriate centre of the body. At the focal point of resorption for each bough, the eye of a peacock-feather should be visualised surrounded by a halo of the appropriate hues. 1-Azha-Hu Kahu Tannat ( repeatx 7) With these words let the first bough be resorbed into the base of the spine. Let the first eye of the peacock be opened, surrounded by a halo of black, then blood-red light.

Let the seventh eye of the peacock be opened, surrounded by a halo of indigo, then purple light. When all seven boughs have been resorbed into the spine, the stave of Al Thuba' should be clearly visualised as an ascending stream of black light in which seven centres of peacock-iridescence shine and irradiate. The colours of the seven centres should then be mingled like the myriad tongues of flame intertwined in a single hearth, starting from the coccyx and mov-ing upwards until the entire spine is perceived as an upright pillar of rainbow-coloured fire. This should be perceived as the Path displaying the Sevenfold Wisdom of the Lumina, shining between the head and heels of the Seeker, illuminating the deific body of Qayin Latan-Azhaka. Having attained to the indigo body of the All-Poisoned One and having illumined the up-right path within the spine, one should visualise the single perpendicular axis - the boughless bough of Al Thuba' - to cast its light up and out of the body through the crown of the head. The path of seven-hued light should be imagined to soar starwards like the trunk of a colossal tree of fire.

THE ICONOSTASIS OF TAN I THE MYSTERY OF Dracotaos transmits the quintessential matrix of initiatory consciousness emanating from the Innermost Circle of Witchblood: the Quadriga of the Four Watchers. The Word and Deed of its Rite intends the alignment of the Seeker's Mind with the mystical point of the Crooked Path's origination, the direct apprehension of Gnosis within the Primal Conclave of the Dragon's brood. The purpose of this wisdom-transmission is to empower the initiand with the subtle form or 'Body' of the Primordial Quadriga, the mystical covine from whence the primary lineage of the Path derives its impetus, and thus to locate the present mind of at-tainment at the crossroads-point of eternal epiphanic realisation. In our sacred lore it is taught that the Four Watchers are the True and Constant Guardians of the Blood-acre - wheresoever it may be manifest. They are the First-born brood of the Dragon and are appointed by the Elder Gods as the First and Last of all Spirit-companies -as the Secret Ward of the Royal Arte. As one, the Watchers form the Concealed Deific Body of the Sworn Brotherhood of the Peacock-Dragon, serving as a Great and Noble Companie to protect the Very Adytum of Magical Tradition. In accord with these Teachings, the Watchers are revered as the tutelary rulers of the compass-rose and are called forth in daily devotion as the Protectors of the Four Ways and the Four Ways Between. Within the clasp of their eight hands the Invisible Circle of Our Arte is perceived to be held in perfect balance throughout the seasons of eternity. Standing in quaternary division around the horizon of Time and yet indwelling the central crossroads-point oflmmediate Re-alisation, the Watchers are honoured as the four cardinal embodiments of Qayin Azhaka, the first attainer of the Crooked Path. The Quadriga of the Watchers is thus to be cognized as the primordial covine, as the Great Circle formed by the four sovereign powers of existence -the primary elemental bodies -as they arise from the hearth-fire of Spirit and become manifest, displaying the cruciform extension of all Self-becoming from the mystical centre-point of the Quintessence. From the exemplar of this design the solitary initiate and the fourfold covine are established as the principal vehicles of the Path's transmission. In the flaming heart of the Quadrigan Covine the Antient Spirit of Qayin Azhaka dwells un-seen, potentiated as the Fifth and Hidden One: the Cryptarch or Secret Ruler.

As Draku Ezhu amidst the Spirits of the World, as Qayin amidst all Flesh, and as the Peacock-angel in the Spheres ofEmpyreal Wisdom, the Watcher Within is out-cast to wander the Land-to encircle the countless aspects of Knowledge presented upon the Way of Pilgrim-age, and from the substance refined in the alchymic passage of ordeals to make the Body: to empower the Vessel of the Seeker's transcarnation. Through the numinous hands of the Intercessor the elemental substantiation of the Seeker's body is fashioned and is perpetually wrought anew, transformed, refined, and re-configured from moment to moment, to embody the Quintessence through the Matrix of Gnostic Realisa-tion. II It is taught that the Four Watchers are the appointed custodians of the Sanctuary of the Dra-conick Wisdom; that the entire corpus of the Gnosis lies within their compass and its ever-transmutable Teachings emanate therefrom directly to the manifest heart of each Seeker and Covine. To open the way and show forth an exemplar, this Secret of Arte has here been made manifest within the present recension of the Draconian Grimoire. In each time and place of convocation this Mystery shall take form and flesh anew. Through and throughout the many ways of Magical Tradition the Arcanum of Tan shall reveal itself in the convocations of the Dragon's brood, even as it was in the Beginning, is now, and evermore revealed through the hidden body of initiates, known to the Wise as 'The Column of the Crooked Path'. In concurrence with this ordained manner of transmission it is deemed that the Tan Rite should be worked in groups of four initiates. For when four vessels are gathered together in the Dragon's Name, there shall the Four Watchers become flesh and there, in the midst of the four, the Fifth Watcher shall be present as the Initiator of Our Path. The Wisdom of Azhdeha shall therefore be revealed straightwise from the root of its empowerment - from the Peacock-winged Angel that rejoices in the pyre of its own burning scripture. Whosoever seeks to undertake this rite alone - by means of the lineage of unique transmis-sion - must find the quadripartite balance of the Four Watchers within the single vessel. There-fore let the solitary practitioner of the Arte adapt the method and structure of this rite to his own individual mode of working, endeavouring to walk equally upon all points of the fourfold cross, even to abide at the centre - within the point of the quintessence. The true fulfilment of the rite shall orient 'Form' to the Four Ways and focus Mind within the 'Force' of the circle's centre."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomosia Draco'Taus III Being of many natures the Rite ofDracotaos (also rendered Draku-ta'us) bears many epithets to denote the scope ofits arcana. In esbatic discussion and in the course of common practice it is of-ten simply referred to as 'The Peacock-angel Rite', an honorific title borne out of veneration for the Fifth and Secret Watcher. Likewise it is also known as the 'The Rite of the Five Watchers'. In formal practise the Rite ofDracotaos is signified by the man tic seed-syllable of'Tan'. It is by this root-name that the subtle powers of the Mystery are summoned and directed during contem-plative exercise. The root-name functions to create the phonic hot-point whereby the matrix of gnosis is transmitted to and given focus within a specific locus of consciousness -in body, mind, or spirit - such as is determined by the manner and intent of the specific practice. Whosoever has understanding of this arcanum shall pronounce the Word of the Peacock-angel within the Starry Palaces and the Infernal Catacombs, even at the fourteen shrines of the Dragon which lie hidden throughout the lands of the Earth and within the secret kingdoms of the Flesh. Within the cycle of the sacred year the Mystery of Tan is numbered as the sixth Great Rite to be celebrated. The day of its exaction falls by customary observance upon the 21st September, the autumnal equinox; this being the dusk-quarter day of Sun, Earth and Season, and the appoint-ed time for the 'second harvest-tide' - the reaping of the spirits. Time is here deemed ripe for Man to gather 'the fruit of the aire', meaning the bounty of the orchard and the lone-standing tree, even to garner the souls that dance about the pole of Al Thuba'. The Main Rite should be worked in entirety, beginning at the eventide hour of twilight, con-tinuing into the hours of darkness and dosing before the noontide of the dead. The composite arcana of Tan may also be utilised at other times throughout the year and most especially as an integrated part of a daily transvocatory observance undertaken in preparation for the work-ing of the Main Rite. Within the eightfold correspondence of hour and rite the time between 4.3opm and 7.3opm is deemed appropriate for such adjunctive and preparatory work. Ritual Procedure The Main Rite of Tan has the following procedure:-1) The Rites of the First Circle:-The Oracle of Elder Worship. The Commination. The Summoning unto the Mystery of Tan. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle. Preparatory Charm and Offering. Statement of Convocation. Eightfold Empowerment for the Circle of Al'Tan.

Preparatory Procedure In order for the rightful working of the Tan 1vfystery it is needful that the Body of the Covine, the Aspirant and the Circle are prepared and unified according to the manners of Our Arte. The ground of the ritual site must be swept until the bare skin of the earth is revealed in readi-ness for the sigildric tracery. The consciousness of the aspirant must be one-pointed, residing in clear and open mindfulness in preparation for the impress of the cognitive matrix of the rite. The Quadrigan Covine must be ordered according to the disciplines of the Arte; abiding in equilibrity of heart and in preparedness for the motion of intent toward the fulfilment of the task ahead. When all may meet in unison upon the path that leads unto the Mystery of Tan, then all shall be deemed worthy to serve as the True Vessel of the Watchers. Let those who have fulfilled the tasks of the path according to this counsel, even unto the accomplishment of the twelve ordeals, let such as They proceed in earnest toward the undertaking of this rite."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"Grimorium 0~nomosia Draco'Taus Concerning the Requisites, Regalia and Sigildry of the Tan Rite By vertu of the pilgrimage, by flesh and by fetish-urn, through the divers practices of the Crooked Path, most especially through the named and numbered ordeals of the Way, each candidate for the Rite ofDracotaos should be found unwanting in the ways of preparation and therefore be deemed most worthy to step within its most blessed conclave. Let each and all be caparisoned with the armour of the Spirit-procession, the weapons of the hunt and the tools of the harvest, together with all accustomed instruments of Our Sacred Artistry. Thus shall the Regalia of Al' Tan be upon the Flesh of the Covine. Let the barren earth be graven with the sign of the Double-ouroboros, for thus shall the eyes of the world be opened to behold the Hidden Land of Kahu. Let the border of the first circle be traced with powders of red earth and grain; and the edge of the second with powders of flour and graveyard earth, mingled with ashes, bone-dust and with the dried leaves and berries from death's especial worts - such as do flourish in places of burial. As is custom at the beginning of the rite, the stang of the Magister should be placed at the threshold between the two circles. A-top its fork'd head the Guardian of the Northern Airt shall duly place the Skull, the Death's-head Image of Qayin. And there-upon the Skull of the First Master let a wreath be laid, even as a crown stolen from the grave of a newly-buried corpse. At the centre of the first circle a mound of earth should be raised and upon this a nest of boughs should be built in readiness for the epiphany of the Phoenix-seraph amid the flames of divine ekpyrosis. In the top of the pyre-mound and above the very heart of the circle a bowl should be laid. The bowl must be of sufficient size to bear the Skull and must lie within the reach of all initiands; for all shall be called upon throughout the course of the ritual to make an offering of blood there-to. Around the edge of the first circle, at each of the cardinal and sub-cardinal points of the compass, let a single peacock-feather be placed. The onlay of the eight eye-signed quills shall serve to betoken the sight of the Four Watchers within the Circle of Presence. Amidst the ring of feathers let idols of mortal worship be placed, together with all manner of spirit-fetishes and talismans in honour of the Bl est Companie of Elphame and in devotion to all the World's Djinn. In the heart of the second circle's finitor of bone-grain, let all initiates conjoin in the task of raising the Image of the Peacock-angel. This is to be formed about a central column of wood - a gnarled and fire-blackened stake, being of such height as to oversee all of the covine, and being impaled within the ground with sufficient sturdiness so as to support the Skull of Qayin at the appropriate juncture of the rite. At the beginning of the ceremony let the idol of Azh'ra-il stand headless, raised in the like-ness of a wooden cross: a death-tree bedecked with all tokens of mortality's end; adorned with the bloodied skulls of bird and beast, with the stone and iron ornaments of grave and tomb, with the feathers of the night-owl and the flowers of the dwale, even with the shaded boughs of cypress and yew. And at the very summit of the witching-pole a single peacock-feather should be placed to serve as the secret eye of the Cryptarch, thus to overlook the concealed domains of the Mystery. In the days before the rite let the companie of initiates evoke the eidola of the Peacock-angel within the Eye of Vision, and from the combination of their varied revelations let the Idol be made. When the pyre-mound and the idol have been built a-right, hallowed by whispered charm and by the very deed of their construction, the interior geoglyphs of the rite should be traced.

Finally, when all is prepared and established in readiness for the rite to proceed, the site should be enclosed within the selion-fence of staves and indigo thread-leaving the North-eastern Gate of the Blood-acre open for the formal procession of the covine's entrance. In addition to the requisites named above in our given counsel, let those who would undertake the Rite of Al' Tan gather unto themselves the following:-Each should be prepared with a dagger, keen of edge for the letting of blood. Each should bring offerings of grain, rice and fruit for the Table of the Spirit's' Feast. The Magister, as the Vessel of the Northern Watcher in the Place of Power and as the Appointed Viceregent of the Hidden Watcher Within, should gather four bundles of corn, each of twelve ears; thus to make a single sheaf of forty-eight stalks.

Gathering within the first circle, the Northern Guardian shall pronounce 'The Oracle'; by its word the rite shall begin in truth. The Oracle being spoken, the Magister shall then present the Symbolic Intimation of the Curse: the skull of Qayin in his left hand and the ritual hand-bell in his right. Thirteen knells shall then be sounded to pronounce the Mystical Battery of Tan. When the last knell has died away to silence, the skull should be returned to its customary po-sition atop the stang. Thereafter the Magister shall pronounce the Words of the Commination, bestowing the Inverse Benediction: the Curse of Azh'ra-il (If so desired, a dance of malediction may follow here, being used to empower the foundation of the ritual. By the whirling of flesh, the beating of drums, and by the call of 'Accursed Be!', so may this be done. By the Magister's Cry, let the dance begin and end). The deeds of the Commination being fulfilled, the Magister shall now declare 'The Sum-moning unto the Mystery of Tan' unto all that are present. This being accomplished and all assured of their right to undertake this Mystery, the ceremony shall proceed through the work-ing of 'The Rite of the Draconian Oracle'. This shall be performed according to the Teachings of the Black Earth, from the utterance of 'The Declaration' unto 'The Charge and Address to the Shadow'. Given the distinct procedure of this present rite it must be observed that the lighting of the central fire at the customary juncture of the Fire Exorcism should be omitted; instead a lighted candle may be placed to the north of the pyre-mound in token offering and for use in the eventual act of its ignition. It should also be noted that during the Offering of Eight Boughs the various tokens of wort-cunning are to be laid around the central mound in the manner of a wreath. The boughs and all other offerings will be consumed in the fire at the completion of the first circle's main conjurations.

This is the Sign presaging the Mystery of the Watchers. When the silent fulfilment of these deeds has been achieved, let all turn and return unto their appointed stations and there abide in readiness for the next stage of the rite: the Eightfold Empowerment for the Circle of Al Tan. The Eight Charms of Empowerment for the Circle of Al Tan The initiates of the Quadriga, standing sure-footed and true within their appointed airts of the Blood-acre, shall recite the following Charms of Empowerment; each assuming the role of primary incantor by turns, according to the allotted division of the compass and the Master's decree. An exemplary order of recitation is given in the rubric below. Techniques of mimesis may be used to enhance, to echo and susurrate the words spoken by the primary incantor. All mantic formulae should be spoken in unison of heart and intent. This stage of the rite is used for the enhallowing of the Skull and for the preliminary con-secration of the eight peacock-feathers. The accomplishment of its empowerment reveals the magical transformation of the Skull, the Fifth or Hidden Dragon-vessel, from its attained form as the illumined bone-cauldron of Qayin into the divine vessel of Azh'ra-il, the angelic hy-postate of the Intercessor. The Skull is the Graal of the lnitiatic Mind, the receptacle of theophanic revelation. Its form is constantly purified and prepared through the ascesis of the Path to receive the continuum of Gnosis, that is, for the Mind to directly apprehend the vital and ever-changing current of the Magical Quintessence. The perpetuity of revelation to the initiate obtains manifest epiphany within the Eye of Vi-sion as the Body of the Peacock-angel. The appearance of Azh'ra-il, the Pavonian Seraph of Death, signifies the exaltation of consciousness upon the perpetually shifting crossroads-point of Change. The Wisdom of the Dragon is hereby revealed as the Daemon of the Path, as the Guiding Intelligence of the Seeker, the Masquerader in a thousand forms and hues, whose very nature is to depict the alchymic processes of the Path in a single deific image. The location, movement and re-location of the eight peacock-feathers, both within this stage of empower-ment and throughout the entirety of the ritual, signifies the opening, transformation and order-ing of the inner sensory organs and states of Mind which perceive and cognize this unitive im-age of revelation and cohere its reification within the lnitiatic Body. The Double-ouroboros of Tan opens the eyes of the Land in order that we, its Journeymen, may attain to the re-cognition of the Peacock-angel as the Mirroring Eidol of Self and its stages of Transformation. The initial eightfold empowerment therefore serves to begin this especial unveiling of the Intercessor as the Hidden Companion of the Seeker. At the inception of the empowerment the feathers should be arranged around the first circle according to the directions as previously stated in the commentary. Each charm is to be recited in turn. As each is completed a single feather should be placed in the mound as an offering to the Skull. The order of the feather-offerings should follow the ordained cycle as given in the rubric (It is important to note that the numeration of the feathers in the rubric is solely indicative of"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo£5ia Draco'TaU6 their sequential place in the order of offering).

The Watcher will then begin to recite the mantic orison of the spell; the other initiates will follow through mimetic sussurration. The man tic formulae should be repeated by the leading incantor until he or she deems it appropriate to begin the main text of the spell. The other initiates should continue in the resonant utterance of the man tic chant. At the close of the spell's recital the Watcher should once more take up the mantic chant and guide it unto a suitable close, by raising it to a sudden shout or breaking its rhythm with a sud-den handclap. The Watcher will then return to the edge of the circle and make some sign to the next initiate that they may begin the next spell. A single bow and, if needful, the passing on of the ritual bell may serve to indicate the succession from one initiate to the next. It should be noted that the mantic formulre of each spell may suffice as the sole and primary incantation for each point. If deemed appropriate each initiate should speak from their heart as guided by the presence of the Intercessor. The formal texts of the eight spells are provided as an exemplar and should be adapted according to the unique revelation of the Fifth Watcher during the course of the working. Thereafter the formal procedure of the rite should resume with the Address to the Ninth and Secret Eye of the Peacock-angel. To assist in the clear exaction of this stage in the rite, the sequential orders of the working procedure are clarified in the specific rubric for each spell. It is wise to be mindful that the entire complex of these formulae is intended to convey and actuate magical teachings concerning the awakening, transformation, and re-orientation of in-ternal psychical organs of perception. The exactitude stated in the rubric for the location of the peacock-feathers is precisely the outward display of this internal accomplishment. Prior to, and in preparation for the Tan Rite the presence of these internal 'eyes' is indicated by the focus of mind upon specific axial points in the body. Most specifically one should recall the Practices of \"Honing the Sword', 'Donning the Sky-armour', and 'Emanating the boughs of Al Thuba'. The present deeds intend the union between the Ascending and Descending Paths of the Serpent: the simultaneity of rarefaction and reification.

Let the Shadow be the Guide, that the Flesh, Word and Mind may at-tain to its Inherent Silence: the Primordial Nature of the Umbrose Deific Body of Azhdeha, Tan-Azh-Hua. I -The Transference of the Flesh Be still in Body. Imagine the Shadow to sway back and forth - like unto the Serpent in its be-guilement.

Practise the Transference of Action, Form and Force to the Shadow. 2 -The Transference of the Word Be still in Body and Speech. Imagine the Shadow to whisper, to speak with calmness and equi-poise of feeling, to speak with divers emotional expression, to chant, to sing, to imitate the sounds of the elements - the wind, the storm, the falling of rain, the rushing of a river, the roaring of fire. Imagine the Shadow to imitate the myriad cries of all beasts, and to laugh with the joy of Gods and Men! Practise the Transference of Speech to the Shadow. 3 -The Transference of Mind Be still in Mind: realise this to be identical to the Shadow's Poise. Conceive of the Voidful Self without differentiation between the Ipseity of the Shadow and the Perfect Mind. 4 -The Transformation of the Shadow Dissolve the sentience of the Flesh into the Shadow: anull self-identification with the sensorial aggregate of manifest substance and cultivate selfless-entification wholly within Shadow. Listen to one's heart beating within the Shadow; disown the heart-beat as belonging to one's self and realise it to be the mystical knell ofTan-Azh-Hua, the voice of revelation, sounding the ebb-and-flow of the Umbrose Deity's life.

Azha-Ka-Hua! Introductory Comment The singularity of I is the point illumined by the Black Light of Divine Imagination. In its unending moment of Gnosis, the Magical Quintessence is revealed. THE CROOKED PATH is the ever-changing continuum of initiatory consciousness, connecting each focus of revelation -moment to moment - within and beyond the cycles of temporality. The isolate instant of realisation and the eternity of gnostic theophany are simultaneously en-ciphered within the wheel of the year and the day -in the teachings and rites of the Draconian Circle of Time. The path reveals itself directly unto the Seeker through the aleation of chance. It communi-cates its essential transformative nature by creating a unique cognizance of possibilities within the receptive mind. The potential for complete self-transmutation is realised as existant within each new moment. The actuation of this realisation is maintained and advanced through the course of manifold initiatory processes, through the discipline of devotional practice combined with the continual cultivation of the sorcerous psyche: the All-believing Mind. Magical ascesis must be married with divine aesthesis, the discipline of both freedom and self-control must be united with the illumined perception of the visionary inspirant. The cultivation of the sorcerous mind is augmented through the awareness that each mo-ment contains the death of all being: the absolute dissolution of all duality in the instant of an-nihilation. This is the sacrifice, 'The World-field's End', which is ritually celebrated eight times throughout the year. He who has attained the perfect comprehension of the sacrificial arcanum has passed beyond the moment of the eschaton to realise the complete identity of Being with the Primordial Void. He has become one with the Elder Gods, for he has entered the Abode of They-who-are-not. By vertu of the Magical Quintessence, the realiser of voidful existence obtains the unique perpetuity of becoming in the sorcerous flesh of manifestation, for such is the nature of true initiated entity. Abiding not in the field of duality, existing not in the domain of reciprocal perceptability,-where eye depends upon eye, the initiate is verily within the world and yet not of the world. The Sorcerer of the Crooked Path is the attainer of self-existent reality. He is the Living Truth of the Void, the fleshless flesh of the Elder Gods. The course of attainment is cast through time, from moment to moment, from rite to rite. The form of the one vessel, both subtle and corporeal, is thus perfected through the transmut-"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"Gl'imol'ium G_l!nomosia Dl'aco'Taus ative processes of the temporally attenuated path. This many-coloured procession of change is embodied in the shape-shifting spirit of the T urnskin, the reflex and mirror, the two sides of the knife: the initiate and the initiator of the Dragon-road. For the interceding spirit of our path configures the matrix of all possible differences between the Seeker and the Dragon, between the Self as the aspirant and the Self as the realiser. Here, in the Mysterium of Hua, the Inter-cessor serves to re-collect and re-member the fragmented body of the sacrifice: to convoke the assembly of the dead. The Rite of Hua and its constituent arcana may be commented upon in terms pertaining to varying degrees of attainment and with regard to divers manners of purpose. Its Mystery may be interpreted accordingly by each and all as befits their intent. i) Ancestral Mass:-The Rite of Hua may be regarded as a means for establishing communica-tion with the spirits of the deceased, with the ancestors of spiritual and physical heredity. It may be thus used to raise the corpse that it might walk anew upon the earth. It may be employed to encharm the bones to speak through divination or dream, to accomplish many and divers deeds for the pleasure and advancement of the sorcerer. For such purposes, let each devise specific spells suited to the exact nature of intent. Of such varied enchantments certain exemplars of composition and method shall be given here, concealed within and appended to the text of the main rite. ii) Transubstantive Communion:-The Rite of Hua heralds the End of all Flesh. It signals the nigh completion of the Dragon-wheel of Time and marks the closing phase within the cycle of transmutation by raising or re-membering all that has been sacrificed throughout the previous rites of the year. For that which has been cut away in the deeds of sacrifice forms the Companie of the Dead: the world of shells, the body of the profane or non-initiated entity. Even as the ser-pent sloughs its skin, so the sorcerer must cast off all that is unneedful to his path. Yet all must be made to serve; all that exists must attain fruition for the true fulfilment of the harvest. It is therefore, within the spells of Hua, that the sorcerer mystically resurrects all that he has slain. He coerces all within the domain of eschatonic realisation to serve his purpose in the final deeds of self-recreation. As a sign of eternal agelessness, the serpent devours its own sloughs and is forever nourished thereby. Throughout the entire cycle of the Draconian Mysteries there is a reciprocal process - a dou-ble-way of giving and taking-of offering to the void and of returning from the void. Within the rites of I, Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan and Hua the sorcerer cuts away the consciousness of all that is - all Being-in order that he might return to the primordial state of paradaisal empti-ness: the negative existence or Void of the Elder Gods. From the single pyre, wherein this ar-canum is enshrined, the paths of the ritual compass extend to demarcate the veiled mysterium of the Eightfold Rite. Upon the basis of this octrigan matrix the primary ritual hypostates of the Sabbatick Ceremonial are evolved. Through the varying arrangements of symbol, myth and alphanumeric forms, these divers mysteries articulate the eternal truth of the dual sac-rifice through the continuity of temporal sequence. The four liminal rites of the sun and the four transliminal rites of seasonal transition extend the paths of the eightfold matrix from the centre of the a-temporal adytum to the circumference of the year's horizon. By this hypostatic extension the eight nodes of the year delineate the seasons of change: the transmutation of the 710"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"'Ihe Rite of Hua Seeker's consciousness through the principal alchymic phases or sacred fractions of time. This is the shaping of our sacred land. The focus of sacrificial transformation is the Mysterium ofl. The primary temporal location of this most holy rite falls upon the point of the Black Sun, the stroke of midwinter darkness. Its ritual node, the point of greatest solar negation, is transposed to the cycle of the moon through the working of the I Mysterium -The Oracle Rite - upon each dark lunation of the year. It is by vertu of this identification between the times of greatest negation that the subtil time, or aeon, of the central arcanum is re-entered. It is thus that the eightfold process of seasonal transmuta-tion is further augmented through the thirteen dark lunar rites of the year. The thirteen work-ings of the Oracle Rite, together with the annual working of the Hieros Gamos - from Dark Moon to Dark Moon for the lunar month prior to Midwinter -constitute fourteen periods of voidwise sacrifice, consummated upon the black moon-tides of offering. We may consider these fourteen periods of the Lightless Moon to serve as a cycle of temporal analogues to the fourteen dragon-points of Our Secret Worship. For it is by our ritual observance at the appointed hours of the Old Moon that we may walk forth upon the selene point of infernal descent. Within the noctilucent moments 'twixt Old and New, the wholeness of the earth is covered in the crimson inundation -the sidereal catamenia of blood. The World-field is destroyed by flood and yet, from that time of death, with the turning of the moon-mirror from darkness to light, the Hal-lowed Kingdom of the Chosen is born anew. In further illumination of these arcana, we may enumerate and unify our sacred count of the fourteen -and of the numberless One beyond - in the chronomantic singularity of the year's thirteen Dark Moons within the solstitial point of Winter's sunless heart. Within the flames of the Old Sun's death, all is consumed and the Pact of Witchblood's birth is sworn anew. The Oracle's secret utterance may be heard, thirteen times echoed, in the silent knell of all-enchant-ment. By mindful alignment with the Midwinter source of initiation, the aspirant attains the empowerment of the primordial root of time and thereby revivifies the theandric assumption of Qayin Azhaka: the Arcane Body of the Perfected Dragon-sorcerer. The sacred conjunction of the Black Sun and the thirteen Old Moons is attained within the oracular moment of the Vessel's opening, for therein the alchymic spectra of Time meet and conjoin. Solely upon the darkest node, the black point of our infernal descent, shall the rays of the eightfold solar disk be wed unto the fractional and luminescent tinctures of the lunar mir-ror. Amidst these whisperings, let the deed-fulfiller read truth ... In the darkest hours - the times of the Opened Vessel - the sorcerer casts off his temporal skin. And know ye that in such times, when the skin of man is cut loose, the shade of the sorcerer shall wander abroad by beast-path and bird-track, by corpse-road and spirit-rade. Yea, in the darkest hours, he sacrifices all to the Dragon's mouth. With the knife of adaman-tine edge, he cuts through that he has assumed as his 'self' - his guise of worldly manifesta-tion -and offers it wholly and completely to the Vessel. The offering is cast into the void-state within the Vessel in order that it might unite with the primordium of existence and that, in the fullness of time and attainment, it will re-turn transformed. In the act of offering the profane is severed, cast down into the mouth of the fetish-urn and therein is 'exiled without return' (see 'The Declaration' vide Oracle Rite). Aught that is deemed 'profane' must therefore transform within the Dragon-vessel in order to return within the consciousness of the Seeker. All poisons are imbibed to create the nectars of our sustenance. Whosoever is wise shall realise the subtle interpretation of these words."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"G.rimo.rium 0_l!nomosia D.raco'Taus For the sake of greater comprehension in these arcana, recall that in the Mysterium of Hu, during the fifth of the seven offerings at the heart of the second circle, it is said:-1n anointing our flesh with the Sacred Powders may we lay ourselves in mystery beneath the earth-skin; that even whilst we traverse the Worlds of the Living, we shall create ourselves in the Image of the First and Last of the Witchdead, and that in Time -through the seasons of change wrought of our rites -we shall attain the transcarnation of the Self with all Otherness: the Bearing and the Tearing of the Ser-pent's many sloughs.' This symbolic act of self-anointing prefigures the infernal descent of the sorcerer, the contin-ual going-forth in the direction of the falling sun, the perpetual down-going toward the lim-inal moment of the Black Noontide. Simultaneously, the act presages the resurrection of the corpse -that which has been cast below the earth-skin. This concurrence of transformative processes marks the turn and re-turn of the sacrificed one: the absolute dissolution in the point of change -1. Upon the Apophasian Way of Our Infernal Descent, through the self-overcoming of all that is sought, the Seeker shall lose all to attain the Gnosis of the Dragon. Within the All-negating Flame of the Draconine Eye, the Seer and the Vision are anulled to differentiation: all are as one in the Pyre of the Midnight Sun. In Voidwise Absolution lies the Ecstasy of Apostasis! As it is revealed, the Rite of Hua describes the circle of communion betwixt the sorcerer and the dead. The extent of its horizon and the significance of its encompass depend wholly upon the inward sight of the mage and the fated nature of his kinship with the souls of the dead. Herein the sacrificed bodies and souls of the profane are raised and coerced to serve in the procession of the sorcerer's intent. All Souls shall be bound to the Will of the Turnskin God. The Time and Tide of the Rite When the Dragon's Step turns from the Western Gate of the Compass toward the Place of Power -the Gateway of the North, then it is deemed the hour of return for the witch-dead: the time of Hua. At this crossroads of time the Sorcerer is said, in the Hidden Tongue of Our Kind, to stand upon the illumined point of the North-western path: the Purple Interstice. The Rite of Hua is known as the third harvest: the gathering of that which lies below the world-skin. Its Mystery is numbered as the seventh of the Great Rites to be celebrated within the cycle of the year and the day. The time appointed for its customary observance is upon the night be-fore All-Hallow's Day, that is, upon the eve of November 1st. This is the fourth and final cross-quarter day of the year, and marks the course of the Crooked Path from the setting of the sun to the midpoint between sun-fall and midnight. The working of the Grand Oratorial Recension of the Hua Rite - being a ceremony and pageant of many hours - should be undertaken solely within darkness, that is, between the fall and rise of Helios. In order to truncate the main rite and for purposes germane to successive years of turning the Dragon-wheel, it is counselled that the Fourteen Spells of Hua - which constitute the corpus of the Second Circle's rite - should be incorporated into the preparatory praxes ofTan-Azh-Hua. Thus, through votive practise in the days prior to All-Hallow's Eve, the Seeker shall attain unto an initiatic realisation needful for the inner exaction of the Ancestral Mystery. Upon the occasion of the main rite, the shrines of Hua should be raised and empowered by this wisdom, by mantic chant and revelation. This 7u,"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"the Rite of Hua counsel given, it must be added that it is customary for the Spells of the First, Seventh and Four-teenth Points to be worked from their formal text. This is to hallow the Triple Axis: the Head, Heart and Heels of the Mystery. In terms of the yearly cycle of practice, the Power of Hua rules the circle between the close of the Tan Rite and the beginning of the Hieros Di-gamos. At times other than the appointed season of the year, the composite arcana of Hua should be utilised for the divers purposes of ancestral and nigromantic communion. The appropriate time for such magical operations is deemed, according to the eightfold correspondence of hour and rite, to lie in the eventide hours betwixt 7.3opm and 10.3opm. Working Procedure The Main Rite of Hua has the following tripartite procedure: 1) The Rites of the First Circle: The Summoning unto the Mystery of Hua. The Rite of the Draconian Oracle. Preparatory Declaration. The Address to the Threshold. At the Threshold:-The Seven Charms of Calling-Forth. The Rites of the Second Circle:-The Conjuration at the Circle's Heart. The Fourteen Spells of Hua. The Final Hallowing. At the Threshold:-The Deed of Return. 3) The Return unto the First Circle:-The Circumambulation and Resurrection. The Necrodeipnon by the Empty Grave. The Charm of the Revenant. The Binding of Hua. Preparatory Procedure If the Living would commune and walk with the Dead, then let the Living be prepared accord-ing to the manner of the Necromantic Arte; let the Seeker's Heart be sworn in truth to the Way of the Boneherd's Law. Whosoever has arisen victorious from the Circle of Al Tan, such as He and such as She are deemed most worthy to approach the Mysterium of Hua. Unto those whom have fulfilled the thirteen tasks of the Crooked Path this Rite shall most readily divulge its essence, pouring forth"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomo6ia Draco'TaU6 the black wine of comprehension from the Skull-cup of the Master to the bone-sepulchred chalice of the Seeker's mind. For this Rite of Hua is the fourteenth task of Our Path and its traverse shall most surely test the step of all who dare approach. Herein is the arcanum of the path's ending and yet the secret most needful to the Seeker's Heart: the Mystery of Preparation for the pathway's new beginning. Whosoever would turn the Wheel of the Dragon beyond the fulfilment of one year and one day, know that this Rite is the needful deed for thy readiness to undertake the Hieros Di-gamos: the Rite of Second Marriage unto the Snake. In this conclave of the last ordeal lies the secret of the first task: the Preparation of the Corpse. Whosoever has not passed through the thirteen tasks and yet is truly desirous of communion with the Dead-whether in flesh or spirit-then heed well the counsel for this Rite's exaction. By divers means and yet by single mindedness, by many roads and yet by a single step, seek out the entrance to the Cemetery which lies at the heart of the world. Depart from the company of all living men. Wander amidst all, realising the fate of common mortality. Walk amidst the multitude 'til all the world has become a charnel-ground. Let the Hand of Death cast its baleful shade over all the earth, for then shall the light of Hua shine from within. Yet again I say to you -Depart from the company of all living men. Go forth beyond the walls of the cities of Man, beyond the boundary-markers of stone and word, beyond the stat-utes that are writ upon the hearts and the stone-tablets of all day-folk. Become as an outcast, a hermit clad in ashen cerement, a king crowned with the starry ring of heaven and shod with the dust that is the serpent's food. Let thy throne be raised within the unwalled palace of all lonely and haunted places, that thou mayst reign alone beyond the reach oflaw, amidst all dominions ruled without rule by the governance of utmost desolation. Wheresoever the brink of mortal comfort is challenged by fear, there abide - solely for the sake of honing the intent of ancestral communion. In the World and yet beyond the World, seek the Lych-gate which opens into the Place of Death: the moment through which all Living Souls must pass. There abide in quiescence, one-pointed in the mindfulness of self-mortality. When the Seeker may stand before this Gate, purged of all flesh through the clarity of death's mindfulness, constant in meditation upon the bone-strewn road which lies before all mortal kind, then the Seeker is deemed most worthy and most prepared to enter the Ways of Hua. As the World must be swept clean of all concerns, but those germane unto this Mystery, so must the ground -the ritual site - be prepared. Therefore, let all whom have attained unto the needful state of being, stretch forth their hand in the labours of preparation. Barren as the newly-cut meadow, fertile as the newly-ploughed field, let the Devil's Acre be cleansed accord-ing to the manners of Our Arte. Concerning the Earth-signs of Hua Upon the barren earth the tracery of the rite should be laid with all reverence to the purpose of communion with the dead. Dust unto dust - with the duly oriented powders of Arte the deeds of sigildry shall be accomplished. In the first circle, the sign of eight impaling tridents should be marked with salt, co-mingled with flour and fire-ash. Within the second circle, the sign of the spiral path and the sigils of the dragon-points should be made using ashes, grave-soil and bone-dust. All this shall be done thuswise, according to the depiction here shown. At the right-hand side of the circles' threshold a grave should be dug and this should be of sufficient depth and size that the Dragon-vessels of all communicants may be interred therein 714"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"The Rite of Hua at the appropriate juncture of the rite. Before the place of the Empy Grave, a votive shrine should be made. Let a cloth be laid on the earth and thereupon the divers requisites of Arte be arranged, most notably the bowl of offering and the substances used for the Seven Charms of Calling: a coin, a knife, wine, bread, salt and so forth. Concerning the Requisites and Regalia of the Hua Rite In the working of this Mystery, whether in mind or in matter, let the Seeker go forth into the domain of Hua robed in naught but the ashes and cereclothes of the dead. Unto the eye of the waking karcist, unto the eye of the dreaming seer, the Field of Hua should be adorned so as to call forth and make welcome the presence of the dead. For the sake of spiritual equilibrium, the regalia of the twain horizons should befit the nature -the meeting and the division -of both the living mage and the returning companie. Therefore shall the first circle be hung all around with the bright colours of life, with the last flowers of the year and with the last fruit-laden boughs of hedge and orchard. At the quarters of the first circle, bowls of wine, water, bread and fruit should be placed, together with all such offerings that may please and appease the spirits. These offerings are made to call and beckon the rising souls with the remembrance oflife's pleasures. This shall be the manner of the first circle's adornment upon such occasions of working when the dead would be raised for purposes of counsel and fellowship. At the time of transvocation, when the souls are called forth solely to indwell the flesh of the living, then let the first circle be without offerings of food or drink. At such a time, the sole offering of repast shall be the sacrificial libation of blood and elixirs made to the Empty Grave at the end of the rite, for thus the dead may feed solely through and upon the living flesh of the sorcerer. According to intent and insight, let the Hand and Eye of the Seeker bedeck the Circle of Presence. The border of the second circle should be regaled with the images of Death and with all div-ers effigies and tokens of the Boneherd's dominion; with the feathers of the peacock for Our Angel's sake; with the feathers of the raven for the augury oflife's end; with the feathers of the vulture for the sake of all whom attend unto the corpses' feast; with boughs of yew and cypress, together with all such baneful worts of poison, such as foreshadow the death of Man. Midst bough, leaf and feather, let the signs of the grave be placed all about and throughout the circle, thus shall the aire of the rite be imbued with the images of solemn remembrance. Prior to the inception of the rite, a coin or bone tessera should be buried upon each node of the spiral earth-sign. This is done to signify and re-affirm the coin-offerings made during the Hu rite. With the working of each ancestral spell the appropriate coin should be exhumed. As the spell is being worked the coin should be used as a focus for the deeds of communion and after-wards should be offered to the dish of sacrifice, that is, to the bowl which is carried from point to point during the course of the second circle's pilgrimage. Upon the zeroth point, being the heart of the second circle, a fire-mound may be built if re-quired. This should be lit, after the first four spells of the pilgrimage, with a flame carried over from the Blood-acre. This signifies the kindling of new life in the Abodes of the Dead and the resurgence of the Forgotten Ancestral Wisdom within the present encompass oflnitiatic Mind.

Upon the points of Al Tannin and Al Darakshan, let the eyes of the dead be offered - in flesh or in the token form of graven stone. Upon the point of Al Halka, let the Skull of the Corpse be offered. Let the severed head be laid before the living eye, together with locks of hair taken from the scalps of those souls, beloved or hated, with whom communion would be made.

Upon the point of Al La'ta'ifa, let the heart, hide and spine of the corpse be offered. Upon the points of Al Dhi'ban and Al Auhakan, let the bones of the hands and arms be laid, sinistral and dextral respectively.

WHEN THE LAST words of the Revenant's Charm have been spoken and the final knell has sounded, the formal procedure of the Hua Rite is concluded. The Communicants of the Mys-tery should reside within their attained state of awareness: the seventh raised head of the Drag-on. There, in that holy state of death-wise mindfulness, let each resolve and seal the Mysterium of Hua within the one-pointedness of their being, ever according to the unique orientation of their path and persuasion. Thereafter, at the conclusion of the formal and adjunctive proce-dures of ceremony, it is deemed most wise for the Seeker to turn once about the perimeter of the entire ritual domain and then to simply lay down upon the cold earth of the Blood-acre. The Sorcerers' fleshly brood shall lie in undivided coition with the Fathers and Mothers of Witchblood's heredity; at one with the Dead, absorbed in the primordial corpse-sleep of ances-try. The Seeker shall enter the sentience of the spirit-procession: the deified concourse of magi-cal power that proceeds from the Point of Hua. Here is the Double-way, configured through the arcana of our infernal nigromancy. Its unended path leads through eternity - a bloody and bone-paved labyrinth that encircles and winds throughout all ages -and yet it is the straightest and the shortest path -the route of dark illumination that constantly returns to its origin and thus to the present instant: the source of all Life. For the Road of the Draconian Corpse-way issues forth from the momentary interstice of time and leads forth - against itself-to describe the Circle of the Year and the Day. Lying in the Voidful Sleep ofHua-Azhaka, the Seeker dreams within the endless hour of the first and final task: the Ordeal of the Corpse's preparation. Whosoever may cast his eye upon this scene shall behold the Psychostasis of the Dragon-sorcerer. For now is the moment of reck-oning,-the Body of All-Presence lies in death's oneiric embrace, motionless within the Circle of Earth; and within the Circle of Absence is the Body of All-Other -the Mirror-wrought Flesh of Dreams -at one in the Elder Gods' dance upon the sacrificial offering of the negated universe. In the Balance of the Double-ouroboros the Corpse of the Seeker is weighed. According to the measure of his attainment, so shall he proceed unto the Hieros Di-gamos: the Marriage-rite of Perfect Consummation. One by one, when each is prepared, the deed of the Fire's Leap should be accomplished. This expresses the secret without lineage: the unique realisation attained by the Master or Mistress of the Fourteen Ordeals. Cunning meet, cunning part, and cunning meet again! CONSUMMATUM EST! A Mass for Solitary Ancestral Communion. IF YE ARE desirous to seek communion with an individual soul, whether for purposes fair or foul - whether for the gain of good counsel or for inquisition into matters hidden and unknown to the living,-whatsoever the purpose of your heart and mind, the following procedures of Arte may avail in the fulfilment of thine artifice and design. At the hour of dusk gather together all needful requisites of Arte, together with offerings of 794"},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"'Ihe :Rite of Hua food and drink, such as were favoured whilst living by the person with whom you would speak. Bearing forth the Sacred Urn of the Dragon, journey in silence to the burial-place of the de-ceased. Upon entering the cemetery an offering-perchance of coins and flowers - should be offered at the gateway; this is given in payment to the Boneherd and Boneward, the King and Queen of all Burial-grounds. The threshold of the graveyard should be crossed with a back-wards step; whilst turning and spinning the offering should be made. Having appeased the guardians of the ground, make your way to the grave of the deceased and there reside in quies-cence of mind and in the midst of profound nostalgia, calling forth to memory all connections that exist between yourself and the dead person. When you are ready to proceed with the ritual, knock thrice with a stave of bone upon the earth and scatter an offering of grain upon the grave. All the while speak forth the incantations of your heart in petition to the spirit; whisper to the sleeper within the earth. The manner and tone of the bone-whisperer's voice should be varied according to the relationship betwixt the living and the dead. One may speak in kindness as to a friend or a lover; in welcome as to a stranger; in command as to a servant; in humility as to a master or a brother, even in wrath and retribution -as to a foe or an oppressor. At the head and heels of the corpse place and light two candles. At the place above the heart -in the very midst of the grave - let a small hole be dug, sufficient to accommodate the base of the Dragon-vessel. When the candles are lit and the hole has been dug, offer a libation of water and blood around the grave and finally within the hole. The blood of the living thus goes forth to nourish and awaken the heart of the dead. A single coin should also be placed within the hellward furrow as a token of payment for the deeds to be accomplished. When the grave has been encircled by the waters of lustration the Vessel should be half-buried within the hole, so that it is both above and below the skin of the world - within the realms of both living and dead. The Vessel being duly appointed above the heart of the fallen, let a single candle be placed atop it and lit, together with offerings of incense. All things being done a-right, the sorcerer should call forth the spirit of the dead through the Dragon-vessel and thus into the speculum of his own inner vision. The spirit should be addressed and drawn forth to the light of the Vessel, even as a moth to the candle-flame. To ensure that the spirit is present a sign may be called for. This being done the sorcerer should watch and listen attentively to the elements and beasts of the bone-yard-to the soughing voice of the wind and to the cracking of boughs, to the howling and mewling of the night-prowlers, to the hoot of the owl and the crowing of the cock,-for all shall avail in augury of the spirit's desire. Being assured that the spirit has heard and is present, the rite should proceed according to the unique motivation that lies between the Summoner and the Summoned. If the matter of communion is between kindred, then all should proceed well and with harmony betwixt both parties. Yet if one is attempting to coerce the spirit of a stranger or foe to perform a task, the grave should be encircled by red thread tied between four nails or daggers. The grave should be scourged with the knotted cord and the spirit commanded to swear fealty upon the Vessel and to do your bidding without question. The manners and purposes of such rites are divers and this basic method should be adapted accordingly. If two sorcerers of the Draconian Arte are working together to commune with a soul, their Vessels should be half-buried at the head and heels of the grave and a candle placed above the heart. Sitting at the ends of the grave, both should speak their charms over the grave and con-join in single intent. At the conclusion of all such rites of ancestral communion further offerings of word and deed should be made in thanksgiving-to both the spirit and to the guardians of the cemetery. The Vessel/s should be exhumed and in their own half-dug graves a final libation should be poured, finally to be covered over with earth. Upon that place where the Vessel of the Dragon 795"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"Grimorium G~nomoeia Draco'Taus had resided throughout the rite, the communicant should lay a generous offering of food and give thanks for the success of all that has passed. All candles should be extinguished and, if one so desires, taken away for purposes of further convocation. If one has no further desire to commune with the spirit, the candles should be in-terred in the Vessel's burial-hole with the aforementioned offerings of departure. If one removes the candles at the end of the rite they may be lit at any time within a year and a day in order to call forth the spirit to one's aid. If unused within that period of time they should be lit upon the Vessel and allowed to burn down in an act of solemn remembrance. A final deed may be the placing of a single black feather upon the grave - preferably from a raven's wing. This is the 'Sign of the First Grave-mark' and denotes the role of the raven as the sentry appointed by Cain to ward Death's Doorway. Before leaving the grave one should strike the ground with the bone-stave once more, walk around the tomb's edge and then depart in silence. As with all such works of the Cunning Arte the operator should never look back at the site. Upon passing through the graveyard's gate one should step backward and, with averted eyes, turn once more to walk within the world of the living. Such are the basic means for using the Dragon-vessel as the crossroads between the living and the dead. Let each and all adapt these procedures according to their purpose and attainment within the Conclave of Hua. 796 THE LAME HEALER'S CHARM OF HUA Alone on the Tomb of N:.,-He whom mine Heart and Tongue doth name, I walk upon the Bridge, the Knife-way crossed between the Womb and Grave.

Let each beware, for the season of Ka is the time of greatest reckoning-as those well-trav-elled upon the Crooked Path may attest. It is the season of new realisation -of complete dis-solution and fresh self-recognition. It is the time for the tying up of every stray thread in the web of one's life, the time for re-ordering one's perception and for refining one's poise upon the Path. It is the time for severing all needless attachments - for sudden transformation in heart and mind. It is the time for strengthening the foundations of one's future - for sowing the seeds of one's intent in the ground of Possibility. It is the time when one may seek as with new eyes -when one may overthrow the idols of past love and trespass against the tabus begotten of past devotion. All must be offered to the unyielding blade of the Intercessor and all must be rendered to the Pyre of Transmutation - to change according to the intrinsic nature of one's Path or else to be no more. The true Aion of Ka, being beyond all apparent time - beyond the temporal count of Dark Moon to Dark Moon -is the mystical instant of the Serpent's striking: the sacred moment before the Midnight Knell of Death. It is the season when all empowerments of the Royal Arte - past and future - begin their convergence toward the hearth of the Black Sun.

In essence the Circle is the all-encompassing Sphere of Magical Power cast outward from the inmost point of one's Being to form a numinous hori-zon -an orb of <£thyric light -about one's physical, mental, and spiritual body. Its intent is to purify, to protect, to consecrate one's immediate sphere of existence - to literally 'hallow the kingdom' of the Seeker: the Magically Self-existant One. The practice of 'Hallowing' is essentially based upon the pattern of the Sacred Year - the Wheel of Eternity. In its basic form, which is the first method detailed below, one simply uses the ten principal root-names - I, HU, SA, BA, KU, LA, TAN, HUA, IA, KA-together with their associated colours, to emanate a sphere of magical light about oneself. This can, with practice, become a swift and direct means for Circle-casting, and, in reversal, for resorbing the empowerments of the Draconick Year into one's own centre of Being. Initially, the mantric recitation of the ten root-names can be used as a means for establishing the web of interconnection between the Great Rites of the Year and their associated arcana: the directions of the compass, the spectrum of colours, the body of arcana, the patron deities, and so forth. As one progresses on the Path and the root-names become directly associated with memo-ries of practising the Great Rites, it will be found that the most simple form of the Hallowing praxis -the mere utterance of the root-names - will act as a potent evocation for the powers of the whole Draconian Gnosis. The practice will thus manifest the Mindfulness of lnitiatic Pilgrimage. In order to increase an awareness of one's journey throughout the course of the Sacred Year, the Intermediate Form of the practice should be used. This marries the ten root-names with the fourteen points in the Dragon-body. Its implementation allows the refinement of the basic praxis and serves to augment an awareness of detail in one's overview of the Crooked Path. If a rosary is used with this form of the practice a potent mnemonic tool can be established and a powerful, over-arching means of devotion will arise (see The Bone-garlands of Azh'run). The third expression of the practice -the Advanced Form -is only of efficacy when one has successfully passed through all of the Great Rites and each of the mantic formul<£ has a power-ful and immediate significance through direct remembrance. When able, one should engage in the advanced practice in order to recapitulate one's passage through the ordeals of the Path and thereby arrive at a unique perspective of the whole. The application of the advanced praxis greatly augments the internal cognizance of the entire magical design. The Basic Form of Hal-lowing is thereby empowered an-hundredfold; its merest utterance serving to open the Gates of the Ten Directions and the Three Times. Beyond what is written here, let each and all dream and devise these Mysteries anew! 804"},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"Hallowing the Kingdom of ~)?in A;zhaka I Casting the Sphere of Eleven Directions: Basic Practice for generating the Circle o.

By means of the correspondence between the root-names and the rites of the year the circle created through this praxis is wrought in an image of the initiatory wheel of time.

The Sphere of Light and the compass of ten directions being established, by imagination, word and outward gesture of empowerment, one should assume the form of the Dragon-body through the utterance of the Stellar Transvocation. II. At the procedural juncture of the Transvocatory charm, wherein the appropriate spells of the dragon-points are customarily performed, one should direct one's attention once more through the compass of the ten directions. To each of the ten directions in turn send forth the radices of magical power. With each out-ward sending of intent, inwardly vibrate the fourteen mantic formulae of the dragon-points, terminating each utterance with the root-name of the radix. Thus, to give example, the mantic orison through the radix of the North-east will begin -AL SHUJAH HU - proceed through the series of stellar names and end with AL GHAUZAR HU. One should focus all in the complete assumption of the Dragon-body, modifying its for-mulation according to the nature of the radix and its associated mysterium.

Having established the Sphere of Light and therein having accomplished the generation of the Dragon-body according to the ten forms of mystery, let the Master proceed to accomplish the realisation and veneration of the Ten Guard-ian Deities ofZHA. o. Turning one's attention through the directions of the compass, one should accomplish the generation, maintenance and sacrificial absorption of the deific forms personifying the Mys-tery-rites of the Draconian Gnosis (see the relevant sections of the Teaching called 'Al Mandal Dra-ku-ka-la' for an exemplar: the Deifi.c Body ofl). I. To give example:-At the North-eastern radix, the remembrance of one's self as realised with-in the Circle of Hu should be called forth to the focus of sentience and visualised as external to one's present being. One should generate the image of Hu with a clarity of mind, holding its form in stable visualisation and projecting it forth beyond one's present physical form through the power of imagination. The deific form should be the self-image of one's attainment in the Dragon-body of Hu-Azha-Ka, as the vehiculum wherein Self realises its voidful nature as the Manifestation of Hu. The skin of the deity should be blood-red in hue and clasped within its multitude of limbs should be the appropriate insignia and weaponry of the rite, together with all such imagery and sense-impressions as intend the complete re-assumption of the Myste-rium's powers. 11. Having accomplished the external projection of the deific form, one should then perform deeds of veneration before it according to the nature of the Mystery-rite which it personifies, and let this be done according to the sacrificial offerings of the seven powers. By the deeds of arte and by the empowerment of mantic vibration, let the deity of the radix be honoured. 111. Having performed the sevenfold veneration of the deity, one should then unite with it by the divers means of Our Arte, gradually re-absorbing all that one has projected:-By the gestures of divine sexuality, one should couple with the form of the deity and attain blissful union in the phantasie of the Sabbatick revel. By the gestures of sacrifice, one should sever one's flesh and offer it as a feast of reverence unto the deity, facet by facet according to the parts of the draconian form. Likewise let the deity be offered, facet by facet, limb by limb, to the mouth of its maker. For in marriage and in murder, there is no differentiation: a\\l must return to the source of the Mysterium. In the mirror of the circle-mandala the Seeker and the Deity shall behold each other through the myriad angles of dual perception: the mind of one shall be transposed to the other, 'til all is dissolved in the One-pointedness of Perfect Mind."},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"Grimoriu.m G)!nomosia Draco'Taus IV. At each of the ten directions let the Master accomplish this task according to the degree of his vision and attainment. To each deific form there are seven phases of this practice:-a phase of generation, of outward projection, of stabilisation, of sevenfold veneration, of congression, of sacrificial feasting and finally of complete re-absorption into the Body of the Dragon-sorcerer. And through these seven phases let there be silent mindfulness of attaining fruition; for one's obligation of mind is upon the fulfilment of three means:-firstly, upon external and physical sacrificial offerings; secondly, upon internal mantic vibration and repetition, and thirdly, upon the supreme actuation of the imaginal powers in flesh. Upon such airt-points of mystery where the deific body may be projected in divers forms and in the companie of a divine retinue of genii and spirit-forms, let the Master accomplish the generation, maintenance and sacrificial union with each and every form. Fulfilling the practice through the ten directions, the Master shall offer all that he has formed in mind as a sacrifice to the Innermost Heart of the Arcanum. In the Name of Azhdeha and in the Secret Name of his Magical Oath, the Seeker shall accomplish the Voidful Manifestation of the Dragon-vessel within the Thrice-wrought Sphere of Light. This Teaching and Practice is here expounded for use within the first circle of the double-ou-roboros, the so-called 'Circle of Presence'. Whosoever has attained mastery of the three forms of Hallowing may formulate the inner mandala of the Illumined Sphere according to the spiral earth-sign of the Thu'ban Rite, thus transposing the numberless form of the second circle, or 'Circle of Absence', to the thrice-hallowed Kingdom of Qayin. Within this form of the practice the Master should contemplate the pilgrimage of the spiral pathway, focusing his attention upon each point in turn and uttering the stellar name there-of through the ten modifications of HU-SA-BA-KU-LA-TAN-HUA-I-IA-KA. For instance, upon the Tail-point, he will recite:-AL GHAUZAR HU, AL GHAUZAR SA ... and so forth until the ten forms of the Tail-point have been mantically empowered in sequence. This should be accompanied by an assumption of the point's powers within his own being through the various phases and forms as signified by each mantic vibration. The process should be sealed upon each point with the appropriate words, such as are given in the intermediate form of this praxis. The Master will thus accom-plish the assumption of the Dragon-body within the Sphere of Light according to the path of IA and by the means of the One-hundred and sixty-one mantic empowerments. This should be worked from Tail to Tongue and from Tongue to Tail, until the entire compass of the path has been assumed in the Divine Flesh of Serpent and Man in unison. The basic, intermediate and advanced forms of this Teaching and Practice should be adapted by the Seeker according to the triune measure of his or her attainment within the cycle of the fourteen tasks. The Nine-Ringed Mandala of Our Arte will thus be empowered by the mani-fold expressions of unique ingenium, ever according to the sublime wisdom and means of the Sorcerous Dragon-mind.

Each essence of Time may be defined as a unique dimension of eternity: achroneme. A chroneme is the collocated singularity of aligned instances, the continuum traversing all possible time, during which a specific spirit, power, or radix of the Magical Quintessence is transmitted. The conclaves of specific magical praxes throughout the Dragon-wheel of Time are the zones of embodying forms in which the primal or silent chroneme of the Zeroth M yste-rium is transmitted in ten unique ways: I, HU, SA, BA, IA, KU, LA, TAN, HUA and KA. This decade of hypostates constitutes the spectrum of magical consciousness as realised through the chronomantic arcana of the compass and establishes the form for the numeric cypher of Our Arte: the Keys of the Elevenfold Mystery. The ten chronemes, or sacred times, of the Dragon-wheel are a-temporal hypostates or types of the primordial inbetweenness: the JEon of JEons. The chroneme of a particular mystery is the time - any time, moment, hour or epoch - dur-ing which its sentience is realised as the gnostic state by the psyche. The vocalised expressions of these sacral dimensions of time are the phonemes or phonic hot-points of mantic utterance. The chroneme may be perceived solely as the trans-temporal continuum of a magical current, whether of power or of entity. The ten chronemes ofl, Hu, Sa, Ba, Ia, Ku, La, Tan, Hua and Ka partake of the Gyms of the Greater Reckoning: the Calendar-wheel of Eternity rotating upon the Hidden Interstice - the Empty Point of Silence. Emanant from the Circle of the Azh'ra-Kalas are the basic kalas, or time-fractions of the eroto-psychic continua. These essences, partaking of the Gyms of the Lesser Reckoning, are counted through the various cyclical time-wheels of Star, Sun, Moon and Earth, and are made manifest as the substantive psycho-sexual exuvia of the Flesh upon the constituent nodes of those cycles. The deific embodiments of the solar and lunar kalas are revealed in the Circle of Ba as the Reti-nue of the Witch-Mothers and Witch-Fathers and, within the Circle of La, as the Retinues of the Draku-lilitu. The Draconic Zodiak, the Wheel of Fourteen Stars, may be used as the Gyre of the Middle Way to unite the Greater and Lesser Reckonings by means of the permutated combinations of the fourteen stellar names and ten phoneme suffixes.

Each should be con-ceived of as an a-temporal hot-point created by the collocation of each and every instance dur-ing which its particular mysterium was made manifest, whether by deed, instruction, dream or revelation. Given the necessity of a remembrance for each of the eleven rites of the year it is most wise for this practice to be undertaken solely by those whom have passed through all of the fourteen ordeals of the Crooked Path. However, the method of this praxis may be applied to any one point in isolation for the purpose of recapitulation and contemplative re-entrancement. The Basis of Method o) Seated in the posture of meditation before the Shrine of the Home-hearth, let the Seeker visualise himself within the centre of the Blood-acre. 1) In the manner of Hallowing the Kingdom, let him orient his mind throughout each direction of the compass, going forth in the order of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan, Hua, I, la and Ka. At each point let him focus his attention upon a remembrance of its particular mystery. 2) In honour of his remembrance let the Seeker visualise himself making an offering in the form of handfuls of sand. The offering should be perceived as falling upon the point and being strewn forth beyond the circle's edge, therefrom being borne forth upon the the wind beyond the horizon of the Seeker's Mind. 3) Whilst making the offering at each point one should reside in contemplative remembrance of the appropriate mystery and upon the instances of its transmission. By the power of this recol-lection the substance of the offering should be transmuted. Each mote of sand should be trans-formed thuswise through seven appearances:-from sand unto the grain of the field, from grain unto flower-petals, from flowers unto jewels, from jewels unto droplets of coloured elixir, from sacred tinctures unto molten sparks of glowing metal, from forge-sparks unto bone-dust, and finally from bone-dust back to mere grains of sand. Through the seven phases of this alchymy the offering shall become imbued with the radiance of power re-collected from the mysteries of the year. 4) The nature of the sacrifice should be transformed in a suitable manner and in such colours as befits the direction of its offering. Thus going forth through the eight ways -of North-east, East, South-east, South, South-west, West, North-west and North-and betwixt the twain di-rections of the zenith and the nadir, the Seeker shall cast forth the infinite grains of his remem-brance, offering the transformed substance there-of to the deific bodies of time. The offering upon each point may be hallowed using the fourteen stellar names of the Dragon conjoined with the appropriate phonemic suffix. 5) At the conclusion of making offerings unto the ten ways the mind should be focused at the centre of the circle: the eleventh direction beyond, between and within. This should be realised"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"Grimorium Gl!nomosia Draco'Taus as the timeless singularity from whence all remembrances emanate and wherein all instances of timely realisation converge. The circle bestrewn with an infinite number of grains should be transformed in a single radiance of light, moving from the centre to the horizon, inwards and outwards with the motion of breath; each grain being illumined as with a single flame. Through the cleansing of memory by the Dragon's flame all shall be unifed in the one-pointedness of mind-realised as the Perfected Body of Azh'ra-kala. The Cycles of Practice The basis of method is to be utilised through various cycles of contemplative discipline:-o) The basis of method should be established through both the sinistral and the dextral means of actuation, by both the sun wise and the moonwise paths of drcumambulation:-With the left hand let the Blood-acre be strewn deosil in the phonemic order of Hu, Sa, Ba, Ku, La, Tan, Hua, I, Ia, Ka and Silence. With the right hand let it be strewn withershins in the order of Ka, la, I, Hua, Tan, La, Ku, Ba, Sa, Hu, and Silence. 1) The basis of method, in both sun wise and moon wise orientations, should be worked through different modes or gestures of remembrance:-The first mode is the Memory of Action:-Upon each point of the compass there should be a recollection of its corresponding arcanum as communicated solely by means of deed. For ex-ample, upon the point of Hu, one should remember the many physical acts of its ritual exaction, both during solitary and covine observance. One should undertake a thorough recapitulation of the many occasions when the praxes of a particular rite were undertaken. The form of this remembrance should be solely of the physical gestures and votive procedures: the Action of the Mysterium. The many grains of sand should be perceived as the many instances of practice. One should unify each and every recollection of deed, and thereby realise the point as the timeless singularity of all. The Kingdom of the Circle may thus be hallowed by means of the remembrance of ritual deed and purified by the unifica-tion of all such instances in the sole point. The Body of the Dragon shall be thuswise assumed as the deific embodiment attained through Memory of Action. The second mode is the Memory of Teaching:-Upon each point one should undertake a thorough recapitulation of each and every instance when its specific teachings were revealed, whether as text, oral instruction, initiatory induction, or through dreaming. One should focus upon the form and occasion of the teaching transmission, devoid of ritual exaction and without comprehension. This mode of recapitulation should be accomplished in a manner similar to that given above.

The Kingdom of Qayin shall thuswise be hallowed by a remembrance of understanding. The Body of the Dragon shall be assumed as the deific embodiment attained through Memory of Wisdom. To these three basic modes one may add various other cycles of remembrance. One may undertake to remember the rituals of the year in terms of emotional nostalgias, colours, dream-ing, sense-impressions of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell ... and so forth throughout every conceivable difference of perspective. All such modes of remembrance are to be unified within the fourth and final mode. The fourth mode is the Memory of Futurity:-In this final cycle of the practice one should make the offering upon each point and unify the remembered times of deed, teaching and wis-dom within the chronemic singularities of the ten mysteries. Each separate grain of sand should be perceived as a moment of gnosis wherein the diverse modes of remembrance are conjoined. By this means we shall hallow the Kingdom through a re-entrancement into the eleven zones of gnosis, partaking in the direct realisation of the Dragon-body within the unique a-temporal dimension of each conclave. The Cleansing of Memory by the Dragon's Flame The following exercise should be utilised to purify and seal each memory arising within the three modes or cycles of practice, to assist in the transformation of the offerings and to permit the attainment and fruition of the practice through the fourth mode. The image, sense-impression or nostalgic ambience of a specific remembered instance should be held in one's awareness with a stable intent. Focusing upon one's breathing the acts of insuffiation and exsuffiation are used to purify and harvest the powers latent in each memory. Having stabilised the memory, one should visualise one's exhaled breath as a stream of fire pouring outward to immerse and engulf the remembered form. As the memory is consumed in flame, its outer temporal form is destroyed and its inner energetic force is released. As one inhales, the liberated energy is visualised or felt to return to one's own being. With a second exhalation the ashes of the remembered form are cast to the eight winds; one is liberated from the fetters of past attachment and opened to the purified awareness of memory. With a second inhalation the voidwise power, the empty force arising from the absence of form, is imbibed. This is the reciprocal gesture of the spirits toward the Seeker and serves to seal and purify the deed of enchantment. Such is the basic practice of Cleansing the Memory by the Dragon's Flame. Function and Adaptation The constituent aspects of this praxis combine to facilitate a recapitulation of all magical ac-tivity undertaken within the various rites throughout the sacred year and to centralise these remembrances upon the appropriate points of orientation within the Plot of the Blood-acre. The pilgrimages undertaken during the various Double-ouroboric rites are translated from their location in the second circle to single nodes of the compass within the Blood-acre. This thorough recapitulation serves to empty the second circle and obtain the trans-location of its empowerment to centres of manifestation within the first circle. This practice is therefore a most useful means of preparation and purification to be undertaken at each working of the Dark Moon and also at the end of the ritual year during the working of the Marriage Rite.

The praxes of Azh'ra-Kala, most especially the aspect of'Cleansing the Memory by the Drag-on's Flame', may be exerted upon any area of the practitioner's existence, to harvest and cleanse the entire field of being,-to reclaim and re-direct the energies of the heart and mind. If begun at the borders of sleep, one may undertake this practice as a means of transforming aspects of memory via the powers of dreaming. In this application it will be found that the recollection of a single deed may assume many divers forms, even sloughing off its seeming actuality to reveal layer upon layer of many-hued existence. The Seeker should apply these teachings according to his or her own unique and creative in-genium, balancing the two means of aesthesis and ascesis upon the axis of pure intent, remain-ing clear in the purpose of the Crooked Path to strengthen and liberate its true adept. III The Arcanum of Azh'ra-Kala The grains of sand fall upon each radix of the compass as the offerings of remembrance to the Deities of Azh'ra-Kala. Each single mote is transformed to forms both beautiful and terrible, thus to honour and appease, to nourish and to ransom the spirits and powers of memory. The grain of sand, in passing through many transformations of appearance, betokens the transfor-mation of a single instance of memory when perceived from a diverse number of perspectives. By this means we may dissolve the illusory veils of all appearance and perceive the reality be-yond. Upon each of the ten ways and upon the circle's hearth the infinitude of offered grains are as one, unified within the heart of a single pearl: the time-essence beyond all temporal sentience. The counting ofsand-grains in the Desert of Heaven is a moment's task, captured in the turning of the Empty Hour-glass: the beating of the Double-sided Crystal Drum!

All these and yet more -skills beyond count, didst the Ward of Heaven and Earth bestow. And into the Hand of Cains bride and sister the holy neck-laces -the rosaries and chaplets of witcherie -were laid: a dowry for Her True Beloved. Wrought of the bones of Habif, Her once-promised husband, the first murdered man, the many necklaces were entrusted to Her keeping; and by Her guile did She fashion them into forms reflecting the Mysteries in Her heart. Thus is Azh'run made the Keeper and Reckoner of all the Ways of Our Cunning Arte; the Bride, the Sister and Initiatrix of Cain! Among the various fetishes and tools used in the practices of Arte there are several forms of magical necklace which are employed as rosaries and chaplets for the counting of prayers and mantic formulae. The structure, bead-enumeration, form and appearance of each necklace serves as a depictive mandala for its specific arcanum or body of teachings. Given this under-standing there may be myriad permutations and configurations of rosary which may be used upon the Path, amongst these there are certain principal forms. These are described below. In addition to these examples, the practitioner should devise other forms to befit the needs and nature of his or her own ritual observance. The beads used should ideally be made of bone, wood, metal, precious stones, or clay. To each rosary a single larger bead is often attached, most usually in the graven likeness of an human skull - thus to represent the Dragon-vessel: the focus of the Path. The Hallowing Rosary This is a rosary most beloved of journeymen upon the Path, being used for the recitation of the mantic formulae in the practices of'Hallowing the Kingdom'. It has two principal forms:-i) The Rosary of One-Hundred and Seventy-one beads:-This is used for all forms of the Hal-lowing praxis. The order of beads is thus:-one black bead, one small skull bead, one black bead, S~o"},{"pageNumber":821,"pageContent":"The Bone~Garlands of ~h'Run followed by fourteen white bone beads. This cycle of seventeen beads is then repeated ten times, and a large vessel-bead is attached to complete. In practice, one should pick up the rosary and initially identify it with the Complete Circle of the Gnosis. One should dissolve this understanding into the object, visualising the Indivisible Light of Mind entering therein and transforming the mere string of beads into a radiant garland of empowerment. Once the initial blessing has been accomplished, one should hold the main vessel-bead and remember the first Marriage Rite, reciting 'KA'. One should then identify this remembrance with one's present Dragon-vessel and perceive the skull-bead to be identical to it. One then one moves to the first black bead and says 'Bilo Bilo Hu - Ka'ira Azha Ka', to de-note the completion ofthis understanding. Then one moves to the first small skull bead, recall-ing the emanation of the Dragon-vessel from the Pyre of the Black Sun; doing this, one says 'Qayin Ka'ira-Azhaka', to recall the assumption of the divine form of the initiate. One then moves to the next black bead and entreats the Intercessor to open the way into the Conclave of the Hu Rite, saying 'Draku Ezhu! Open the Way for me into the Circle of Hu'. One then enters the cycle of the fourteen white beads, one for each of the points in the Dragon-body, plus the seed-syllable 'I'. Thus one moves through the fourtenn beads - from 'Al Shujah Hu' to 'Al Ghauzar Hu'. One then moves on to the next cycle:-Black bead= 'Bilo Bilo Hu-Hu-Azha-Ka': the completion of the Hu Practices. Skull-bead= 'Qayin Hu-Azhaka': the Divine Incarnation of Hu. Black bead= 'Draku Ezhu! Open the Way for me into the Circle and Conclave of Sa'. This fulfils the Hu cycle of remembrance and empowerment and opens the Path into the Sa cycle ... Fourteen white beads= Star-names+ Sa seed-syllable. Black bead= 'Bilo Bilo Hu - Sa-Azha-Ka': the completion of the Sa Practices. Skull-bead= 'Qayin Sa-Azhaka': the Divine Incarnation of Sa. Black bead= 'Draku Ezhu! Open the Way for me into the Circle and Conclave of Bha'. And so one progresses through the cycles of remembrance - Bha, Ia, Khu, La, Tan, Hua, Ka, I -until one passes around the entire cycle of the ritual year. As each bead is held, one should consider its arcanum, its colour correspondence and significance, its ritual formulae, and so forth. If one has merely begun upon the Path, one should use the rosary to assist in the process of comprehending the structure of the Octrigan Compass and the matrix of attributions be-tween the Great Rites and the points in the Dragon-body. As one progresses through the ritual praxes of the Path, each bead will signify more than just an outer comprehension, but will link understanding with the actuality of memory. To pass full-circle through the rosary's cycle of remembrance and understanding is to step and re-turn upon the Pilgrimage; it is to guide the Mind through the Way of the Seven Revealed Heads and return all once more to the single point of the Black Sun -the root-empowerment of Ka. Once familiarised with the use of this rosary, it should be found to be a most potent mne-monic tool.

Thereafter the practices may be utilised year through year as the Path unfolds anew. To each practitioner the revealed way beyond is unique and is unknown unto all others. To work through the Grand Oratorial Recensions of the Draconick Rites in one single year is a task most arduous and exacting, and is befitting the ability and predilection of but the Very Few. The purpose of the given texts is to establish the magical ascesis by which to hone oneself as a pure vehicle for the spirit of the Crooked Path. Yet such praxes are but the means leading to attainment and, once understood in essence, must be transcended if one is to truly realise the essential nature of the Path. Is it not the way of the Serpent to cast off its old and outworn skin, and to emerge in a new and more beauteous raiment? To attenuate the course of progression in a manner that each and all may adapt to their indi-vidual capabilities and circumstances, the Path may be approached as a system of fifteen ini-tiatory degrees. In this manner one may undertake the ordeals of the Path over a greater and undetermined period of time. 8~4"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"The Gradel3 of the Crooked Path Although grades of initiation can be seen as rungs upon a ladder of progression and the overall path of their ascent be seen as indicative of greater and greater ability, one may also perceive each individual grade to be a unique and co-eval stream of initiatory wisdom - a mys-terium in which the practitioner may elect to specialise. In this understanding, each grade of the Draconick Path may be realised to define a distinct body of Magical Knowledge, and may be perceived to act as a subtil conduit for a mystical lineage of the Gnosis. The Fifteen Initiatory Degrees and their tasks may be defined in the manner given below. The first seven degrees are maintained throughout each year and function as the foundation upon which the temple of attainment is established. 1° -The First Degree is known as 'The Preparation of the Corpse'. It is comprised of the divers means through which one may prepare to undertake the Path. In mind, one should prepare by study and contemplative discipline; in body, by exercise, by obtaining strength and stamina, and by the development of postural equipoise; and in spirit, one should prepare oneself by prayer-ful devotion united with the honing of intent. These inward tasks of self-preparation should be outwardly exemplified through the Forging of the Magical Weapons and Instruments, for such reveals the Making of the Sorcerous Body of Power. In verity, one must continually engage in the comprehension of this arcanum, constantly striv-ing to develop oneself and to overcome one's own limitations in order to attain the greater frui-tion of magical discipline. 11° -The Second Degree is known as 'The Sacred Marriage'. It is comprised of all arcana signi-fied by the magical seed-phoneme KA. In the first application of the Marriage-rite one creates the root-empowerment of the Path; in subsequent years one re-enters the mystical time of that empowerment and refines one's apprehension of its arcana. 111° -The Third Degree is known as 'The Consummation'. It is the Body of all arcana, such as are concealed in the sacrifice of the Sacred Vessel within the Pyre of the Black Sun. It may be contemplated as the point of mystical unification between the Seeker and the Elder Gods, and may be magically utilised as the gate of visionary entrancement between the consciousness of Man and the Voidful Mind of the Elder Gods. IV0 -The Fourth Degree is known as 'The Birth of the Dragon-vessel'. It is the Body of Wisdom signified by the magical seed I. Its arcana are enciphered in the deed of gathering the seven ashes from the hearth of the Midwinter Rite, and in the cognate action of consecrating the Sacred Vessel as the shrine of the Seven Great Mysteries. The practices of 'Hallowing the Kingdom' may be used to affirm and develop the gnostic realisation of the Fourth Degree. 89.5"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"Grimorium G)?nomolifia Dra.co'Taue v0 -The Fifth Degree is known as 'The Pact of Blood and Starlight'. It is attained by the initial working of the Stellar Transvocation and may be perpetuated by the occasional and adjunctive application of its formulae. Specialisation in the Fifth Degree centres upon the use of the Tran-vocation for the Assumption of the Entire Draconick Body. v1° -The Sixth Degree is known as 'The Path of the Fourteen Celestial Palaces'. It is attained by the regular use of the Stellar Transvocation and its corpus of fourteen enchantments. Spe-cialisation in this degree is established by the daily use of these formulae as the underlying foundation of all other practices. THE FIFTH AND SIXTH DEGREES ARE UNIFIED ONCE A YEAR IN THE WORKING OF THE THU'BAN RITE ON JUNE 7TH (SEE ZEROTH DEGREE). v I I 0 -The Seventh Degree is known as 'The Sabbat of the Lightless Moon'. It is attained by the initial working of the Oracle Rite on the first Dark Moon of the Sacred Year, and is maintained and developed by working the Oracle Rite at each and every Dark Moon, season by season, year through year. Specialisation in this degree comports the focus of magical intent upon the dark lunar nodes of time, the focus of mind within the profound contemplation of the Oracle Rite, and in the focus of one's body in the development of the rite's physical exaction. The first seven degrees form the requisite basis of practice; to accomplish and maintain these aspects is to walk the Path as the Sworn Apprentice of the Hidden Intercessor. The degrees VIII-XIV form the main body of the Draconist Temple. An initiate working through these, either in sequential order or by specialising in any one or conjunction of their arcana, is considered to be a Sworn Journeyman or woman of the Crooked Path. v111° -The Eighth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Hu, also by the subsidiary practice called 'Azha-Hu: the Ninety-nine Empowerments for Breathing Life into the Path'. 1x0 -The Ninth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Sa, the Rite of the Turnskin, and also by the subsidiary practice called 'Ma-Shua: Opening the Mouth of Enchantment'. x0 -The Tenth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Ba, the Rite of the Dragon's Horns, and also by the preparatory practice called 'Saba: Perceiving the Mountain of Al Qaf Saba'. XI 0 -The Eleventh Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Ku, the Rite of the Seven Stars, and is also comprised of the Stellar Arcana of Ra, la-Ra-Khu, Al Mandal Behenu and the contemplative formula named 'The Key to the Star-locked Casket of the Seven Celestial 8~6"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"1he Gradee of the Crooked Path Scrolls'. The Eleventh Degree also includes the subsidiary praxis entitled 'Bha-Ia: Dancing with-out Motion upon the Capstone of Al Qaf Saba'. x11° -The Twelfth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of La, the Love-feast of the Crooked Path, and also by the preparatory practice of Ku-La, entitled 'Catching the Silence between Heart-beats'. XJII0 -The Thirteenth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Tan, the Rite of the Peacock-angel, and is centred within the subtil arcana of the Four Watchers. It is also comprised of the preparatory practice of Al Tannat La, being entitled 'The Wreath of the Seven Laughing Skulls'. x1v0 -The Fourteenth Degree is constituted by the Grand Mysterium of Hua, the Rite of the Returning Dead, also by the adjunctive ancestral arcana and the preparatory practice of Tan-Azh-Hua, the latter being entitled 'The Magical Transference of Consciousness to the Body of the Shadow'. o0 -The Zeroth Degree denotes the Mastery of the Crooked Path and has three levels of ac-complishment: the Outer, Inner, and Secret Attainments. The Outer Attainment of Mastery is achieved through the working of the Thu'ban Rite, this being the Hidden Mysterium of Ia: the Grand Stellar Convocation of the Dragon's Brood. The level of Outer Mastery is so comported because in fulfilling the Rite of la one unites the fourteen enchantments of the Stellar Transvocation in a single body of magical power. The regular practise of the Transvocation and its adjunctive formulae intends the pervasive and over-arching empowerment of the Path, and in order to establish the unity of these arcana the practitioner must have reached a level of general and outward mastery on all fourteen points of the Dragon-body. In the Name ofDraku-ta'us, so mote it be! The Inner Attainment of Mastery is achieved when one has worked through the entire body of the Grand Oratorial Recensions of the Draconick Rites and has therefore succeeded in passing through each of the Fourteen Ordeals. When one has so attained, the true indication of Inner Mastery is the subsequent application of one's knowledge. By the unity of accumulated experi-ence, dreaming empowerment and direct realisation, one should attain to a unique recension of the Path's arcana, transcending all that has gone before.
