We describe the breach between thecentre of the world and the horizon, between the zenith and thenadir. In speaking of Poet and Poem we speak of many things ofwhich we may not speak. Amid these words a secret is voiced. Donot mistake it amidst its own echoes.1'We may reveal where the Muse has trodden,not where She has yet to tread.'The mystical and symbolic language of the Poem is, in a literalsense, occult; it simultaneously conceals and reveals the sum of itsmeaning by way of a cipher. The eternal nature of Symbols isrevealed facet by facet, moment by moment. In being cast outbefore the Mind their timely significance is divined and, like amirror, will reflect the Beholder. Do not blame this mirror for thatwhich it reflects.

It isthus that the multiple activity of Symbol and Significance createdwithin this work by the synthesis of alphanumeric encipherment,imagery, allegory, rhythm, ambiguity and other poetic devices aimsto facilitate various states of understanding and from thence a Stateof their sum effect through various combinations.The primary function of this commentary is then to placeemphasis upon those aspects of the Verse and Illustrations whichoperate as inferential nexes of possible interpretation, and which,through multiplicity of interpretation, reflect facets of its SumMeaning and thus of its Unity - a Unity which is concealed: theFace of Truth remote behind the Mask of Word and Image.Qutub was written, illustrated and refined during the course of oneyear. During that period of time, and indeed, as is my avocation, Iwas engaged in the Discipline of the Arte Magical. Magick is aPath encircling the horizon of one's totality and thus necessitatespractices which operate throughout the entire field of its possibleencompass. Such practices involve techniques of dream-controlduring one's sleeping hours and techniques of a ritual, behaviouraland contemplative nature during the hours of waking. This bookmay be considered as inspired by these practices; not only bythose undertaken during the period of this work's composition, butby all such procedures of the Arte Magical which I have, thus far,undertaken during the course of my life.The main purpose of magical practice is to refine, develop, andeventually to transmute the Entire Being of the Magician; thisprocess being in accordance with his Will, Desire and Belief. It isto recreate oneself in a form aligned unto one's True Nature (theIpseity of Otherness), and thus to become a perfect vehicle for theexpression of that nature. The Energy (Baraka) which motivatesthe Aspirant, and indeed the Whole Tradition of Magick, we mayrefer to as the 'Magical Current'. It is to this Quintessential Powerthat the Seeker must make himself accessible and thus, becomingits mediatory vessel, he functions as the channel of its transmissionand the incarnator of its Design. The Current, in being36transmitted by Man, is modified according to the nature of thehuman individual - by the Mind, Body and Soul there-of.Although the Current affects all Nature, it has conscious directionthrough the Initiate, who, being possessed of the Gnosis, activelyworks to manifest the Current: to become Magick Incarnate. Thisis the subject of the Poem Qutub.In essence I regard this work, hence its dedication, to be anoffering given in recognition of affiliations past, present andfuture, and in re-affirmation of the Synomosy between the Heartof the Mystery and Those in whose Bodies it beats. It is given tothose who know to whom it is given.The Poem and its illustrations draw upon a number of diverse andyet subtly interconnected sources and symbologies. The nature ofthese unifying connections is revealed by an understanding of thework's title and its Initiatic context. In essence this work is born ofGnosis and in character may be called 'Sufic'. By such words Iinfer Mysticism Pure and Universal, for:\"Sufism is the Knowledge whereby Man can realise himself and attainpermanency. Sufis can teach in any vehicle, whatever its name.Religious vehicles have throughout history taken various names.\"Rais TchaqmaqzadeAccordingly, I must ask the reader to consider my use of theword 'Sufic' in this light and not as restricted by any pre-conceptions such as belong to the realm of lesser understanding.Do not cling to the word, but rather to that which will remainshould the Sufi go unnamed.\"He may be like Khidir, the Green One, who travels the Earthin a variety of guises, and by means unknown to you . . .What He says or does may seem inconsistent or evenincomprehensible to you. But it has meaning.He does not live entirely in your world . . .He may seem to return good for evil, or evil for good.But what He is really doing is known only to the Few.\"Salik37"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"It is this named nameless one, who wanders everywhere and yetin whom is Stillness, whom I, and yet not I alone, have called'Qutub', and in Man's Form 'Khidir'. These are the Poem and thePoet. And I, I have but held court awhile with the Companions ofthe Wise One, though I am not one of their number.The Sufic word which gives the title to this work is a cryptogramof sublime and mystical significance which may be interpreted inways both simple and profound. Its primary meaning is indicatedby the sub-title of the work, 'The Point', this being a synopticdefinition of the many other interpretations, all of which conveythe idea of singularity.Commonly within the historical tradition of Sufism the word'Qutub' (rendered as the tri-literal root QTB) is interpreted asmeaning 'The Great Magnetic Centre', or 'The Axis' - the Pointof Universal Centrality. This focus of existence is identified withthe concept of the Logos and with the Soul of the PerfectedHuman Being (Insani Kamil). It is also cognate, in sidereal terms,with the Pole-star of the Age and thus with the Hub of theUniverse. We may therefore consider 'Qutub' to be a termequivalent with the Mystical Absolute of Being: I.Equated with the idea of singularity, 'Qutub' conveys theprinciple of one-pointedness. This may be defined as theharmonious co-ordination of Form and Force as an holistic entity,that is, as One Body. In many traditions of magick, philosophyand martial discipline, the concept of one-pointedness isfundamental and may be considered as the central arcanum.For the Adept, to be aligned wholly unto the 'One-pointednessof 'I' is to become the Heart of the Mystery; it is to resolve theapparent dis-unity of the Self and the Universe, Man and God . . .This and That ad infinitum. In realising Qutub there is nodifferentiation, only Unity.\"The Miracle of Unity is to be attained.Everything is formed from the contemplation of unity,and all things come about from unity, by means of adaptation.\"The Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes Trimegistus38The definition of Qutub recalls the mystical axiom oft' cited as adescription of the Divine Nature:\"He Whose centre is everywhere and Whose circumference nowhere.\"This gnostic axiom also describes the nature of the Illuminatewho has attained to the True Realisation of One-Pointedness, andwho, in this attainment, has become an hypostasis of the WholeBody of Initiates. As in the apotheosis of sexual congress there isbut One Body shared by the communicants of the Agapae, so inthe apotheosis of Divine Love there is neither Lover nor Beloved,neither the Inspired nor the Inspirer, but solely the Heart of theMystery Itself. This Heart is Ekstasis - the Singularity realised asthe Focus of Awareness, reciprocated upon all levels andthroughout all Continua of the Existent as the I: Qutub.The axiom also reveals the Qutub, the Power-zone of UniversalCentrality, to be infinitely positioned as both Absence andPresence throughout all chronological and spatial dimensions. ThisPrinciple is reified according to the Design of the Nameless Order.It is manifested through the Perfected Body of Initiated Entity,and is made 'Flesh' in the chosen positions of Time and Place,according to the specialised locational requirements of the Design,as an hypostatisation of the One Body: The Illuminate.Within the Poem, as within Sufic lore, the theandric reality ofthe Illuminate is mythically represented by the figure of Khidir. Itis He - \"the Prophet of the Peacock-quill\" - who is the Orator ofthe Book, and who, with all who are of \"the Blessed Few\", gives avoice unto the Quintessence: the Revelation of the Qutub as bothWord and Silence - A-LOGOS.'Khidir' is the name given to the Wandering Guide. He is theImmortal Adept, ever present for the True Seeker that calls uponhis name. His presence is sometimes described as an elusive flashof green fire, for the robe which conceals his body is dyed with thevery colours of life, and accordingly he bears the epithet of 'TheGreen One'. His Path, moving through all places and yet leadingto none, is said to bring him through the same place but once inevery five hundred years. He is the Witness of the Desert'stransformation into Verdant Land and he has seen both the rise39"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"and the fall of many a king and kingdom. It is said that he is theonly man to have drunk from the Well of Life, and to this he oweshis immortality. Khidir is the Eternal Nomad whose Path traversesthe fullness of the Earth; he is the Watcher of All.The scattered 'steps' of the Wandering Guide encipher thepattern of the Design: the timely manifestation of the initiate, thetimely resurgence of a Form and a Force according to the truerequirements of the Age, the timely passing-on of the Traditionfrom Initiator to Initiate. Khidir's Path extends from the CreativeSource through the far-flung, seemingly 'scattered' lineages of theGnosis. The Matrix of the Design is knowable only in its totality,but it is glimpsed by the Aspirant, revealed in utmost secrecy bythe Guide, facet by facet, according to the occasioned needs of Hethat seeks. The 'steps' of the Aspirant are taken with the samecertitude (yakina) as those of He who guides their placing. InTruth, the understanding of this Mystery - the Design -encompasses and transcends the mundane and temporalcomprehension of Sequence and Consequence. The Gnosis lies inthe treading of the Way Itself - in Eternity and in this VeryMoment.I have heard that it is customary to hail and bless the void of anempty place in the name of Khidir1, for to speak his name is tosummon his Presence, he is thus present as the Void Itself, as:\"He Whose centre is everywhere and Whose circumference nowhere.\"The Poem is an exhortation to the Desirer of Attainment - theSeeker of the Quintessence. It is at once both a soliloquy of theAdored 'One' and an exchange between the Lover and theBeloved. Drawing upon the Initiatic lore of the Mystic it exhorts1. Within the context of Qabalistic lore the identification of Khidir with Void orNothingness permits a direct correspondence with Atu 0 of the Tarot - 'The Fool'. In thisconnection the relevance of Khidir's epithet \"The Green One' becomes explicit, this alsobeing applicable to the Tarot Fool as the embodiment of the creative impulse of Spring:the Green Man.2.

As inthe love-speech of youths and maidens - ghazal - a single wordmay suffice to tell, to disclose, the innermost secrets of the heart,BO between the Mystic and the Mystery of the Quintessence thereis an ambient void - a Silence - traversed solely by the Word(Logos) of Revelation.\"If you understand this, O' Lover,understand that the Lord does not enter into conversationexcept with his own, or with the Friends of his own.\"V..24 The Ta-sin of the Point from\"The Tawasin of Mansur al-Hallaj\"The Language of Divine Revelation is the Secret Tongue of theliver-Living Flesh, sounding deep from within the very core ofBeing Itself. It is the Creative Logos, the Word from whenceWorlds are born, its echoes are 'scattered' amid all the mortaltongues of Earth and yet its secrets are shared solely between theMouth that speaks and the Ear that hears, between the Utterer andthe Receptive Soul. To one so beloved of the Divine, to one sotrue in heart unto the Design, the Current of Initiating Force ismade articulate within a cipher, an Alphabet of Arcana, fromwhence, in untold permutations, evolves a Sacred and SecretLanguage of the Heart. The Translators of the Arcana, fromForce to Form - may we not call them the Artists of the Divine,and the Spirit of their Mystery - shall we not call her the Muse:the Very Daemon of Man.\"I guide rightly without a book.I direct secretly my friends and my chosen ones ...\"Ch. 3.

It is employed to concentrate knowledge,focusing the Current in a precise and occult manner conducive toits passing from initiate to initiate. A single letter, word or phrasemay conceal many diverse interpretations according to context,rendering up to those possessed of the knowledge of interpretationa profound array of sacred discourse bearing upon the inner andouter activities of the Path. Thus, by virtue of this cipher - theSacred Alphabet - the Divine Artist may fashion a microcosmicsimulacrum of the macrocosmic arcana which he would express tohis brethren. Whilst yet mere words may pass before the eyes ofthe profane, the circumferential sanctity of the Synomosy ispreserved. Yet should even the Uninitiate study with heart thatlayer of meaning which is most apparent to him, he may come torealise a facet of the Way and thus the Guide may bring his steponto the Path.The arcane and alchemical symbolism of the Poem is reflective ofthe transmutative process undertaken by the Divine Artist:-He is overcome in an instant of silent anamnesis where-in theMystery envelopes him with the enchantment of DivineInspiration, this is the Moment Initiating. The Mind is the Forgewhere-in the Prima Materia of Thought is made mobile by thebreath of the Muse; her whisper'd instructions heating the basesubstance of the Artist's worldly experiences until, the flame oftransmutation being kindled, they metamorphose into aconsciousness whose nature is so aligned as to be a pure channelfor the transmission of the Mystery to the Word - the Essence tothe Substance. There is then a vast out-pouring of the Artist'srarefied consciousness, the Potable Gold, into the Mould ofLanguage. The Artist's entirety, if but for an instant, is emptied outinto the creative act, and this in turn creates within him a void - awomb - where-in the Muse or Genius takes residence in order to42direct the temporal labour of the Work. The moment ofinspiration is of the essence - a bridge between worlds - a ladderof lightning upon which one may ascend or descend, and uponwhich another may attend upon the Divine Artist's purpose.The 'Word' lies between the Poet and the Mystery of which heis the Communicant; the Bearer of the Word is the Muse orDaemon. It is the very nature of the Muse as the agatho- andcaco-daemonic intelligence of Man, and its identification with thecognate Initiatic god-forms of Shaitan and Lilith which constitutethe specialised mode of attainment concealed within the Poem.Both Shaitan and Lilith are types of the Opposer, that is to say,they are mythic representations of the Power transmitted throughthe magical formulae of inversion and reversal, and as such theyembody the Luciferan path of rebellion against, and thetranscendence of, the accepted order of 'Nature'.\"God is the Opposite of anything you can imagine.\"Dhu'l NunThe identification of the Daemon with specific deific formsthrough votive practices permits the Adept to commune with theReality which informs, or creates the perception of, suchtelesmata. It permits him to utilise fully the vehicles or 'Forms' ofBelief in order to transcend the limitations of their outerappearance and thus overcome the restrictions of his owncircumstance. He there-by facilitates communication with thePowers and Intelligences which are masked by Name, Number,Image and Symbol. Passing through such Gates he participateswithin the Reality veiled by Myth and Rite, he partakes wholly ofOtherness Ineffable. By Self-enchantment, Alignment andIconoclasm the Divine Artist ensorcels Belief, identifies with itsapotheosis and, through this complete identification, the Object orIcon of Belief ceases to be Other, he passes beyond the death of itsform in becoming its Living Truth. It is by such means that theAdept determines the course of his own evolution, and it is thusthat the Sodality of Initiates reifies the matrix of the Design.In identifying the Daemon with the double-form of the Opposer,43"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"as both Male and Female, Shaitan and Lilith, the Adept seeks toidentify himself with the mythical progenitors of the spirituallineage known as 'Witchblood'. For is it not said within theConclaves of the Tradition:-When the Fire of the Ancient One enters into the Bodies of Man andWoman, they shall beget a child that is not born solely of the Clay,but of the Fire Eternal. The Child that is born of Fire may gather untohimself the substance of his own creation, for thus may he fashionhimself according to a Will Unique and Free. Those who are not bornof the Flame must to the Flame be cast.The understanding of this is a most subtle matter and one whichmust necessarily be veiled in terms of myth.The Daemon, as Shaitan, is literally 'the Adversary' - the ReverseOne. He is the Image of the First God, manifest in double-form, asboth the Black Man standing at the Crossroads of all Existence andas Melek Ta'us - the Peacock Angel, Sovereign of the World's Djinn.As the 'Black Man' he is the anthropomorphic 'Body' ofDarkness, the Lord of the Sabbat, the Overseer of the Primal Riteof Magick. In this form he embodies Death as the Gateway to theOther. In assuming the god-form of Al-Aswad - the Man-in-Black- the Adept places himself upon the interstitial 'Point' of the cross-roads and thus within 'Death': the singular inbetweenness 'twixtevery Stasis of Being. He thus becomes the embodiment of theGate at the centre of the cross-roads, the Portal where-by Powerhas ingress to the World of Manifestation and through which theSeeker must pass in order to transcend the 'Form' of the Manifest.The Daemon figured as the Peacock-Angel is 'Death' asmetamorphic process: the Force of change acting upon the Matrixof the Existent. This process is veiled in the language of alchemyas the transmutation of the base substance, the Leaden Matter or\"clay\", to the Aureate Elixir of the Quintessence; a metamorphosiswhich is facilitated through the action of the Divine Fire upon theVessel containing the Matter desirous of change. This symbolism isconcurrent throughout the Poem; the base substance of Man -\"the seven handfuls of the earth\" - passes through the seven stagesor \"steps\" of change which are symbolised by the \"peacock-feathers\" and \"rainbow hues\" of Melek Ta'us. The apotheosis ofMatter and the reciprocal reification of the Divine Flame is44attained to through this process, and is referred to symbolically asthe \"Gold\" of the \"One Image\". The Peacock-Angel is the glyphof 'process' and embodies the mediatory function of the Daemonin facilitating the link between the polarities of the Path. In myth,the Peacock-Angel is said to be the Master of Djinn, the Lord ofall Spirits; this in turn symbolises the mastery of the Adept over themyriad faculties of his own nature: the submission of All to thePath of Will. Shaitan is therefore both the Establisher of the Pathand the Mediator between its twain extremities: the Aspirant andthe Aspired. It is thus, in certain circles of initiates, that He whoassumes the mask of 'Devil' is both the Guide towards, and theLiving Symbol of, the Gate through which the Aspirant is led.The Daemon figured in the feminine is Lilith, the Earthly Brideof the Man-in-Black, and it is in this guise that the Daemonassumes the prototypical and tripartite forms of the Creatrix. Sheis Lilith, the carnal reposoir of the Ancient One's Fire; she is Ruha,the Spiritual Blood-mother of Initiates; she is Az, the PrimalConcupiscence from whence emanates the force informing theIcon of the Great Whore. In her is the Well of Life Itself, where-inis spent the very wealth of pleasure. In her the Forge of Stars,where-from the 'Blackened One' must obtain through the'smelting of all metals' the Aureate Jewel: the golden token whichthe Seeker must render to the Keeper of the Gate.As Lilith, the Daemon is the triple-faced Queen of the Sabbat.She is the Aged Voluptuary, robed in the last light of the waningmoon, by whose scarlet blood - the rubeate tincture shed in thenight of her power - she may transform herself into a multitude offorms and phantasms. She is then the Enchantress who begets indarkness the words of light. She pronounces the spell oftemptation over the passion-roused heart of Man, casting theglamour of illusion to ensnare the unsuspecting and to test theever-watchful. For those whom she loves, she inspires. To these,her adorants, she is \"Wisdom\" the Virgin-bride of the Soul.It is She, the Muse, who with the innocence of the dove offersthe envenom'd cup to the parched lips of her earthly lover. Withinthat cup is his own life-blood; to her his life is sacrificed. Hers isthe Cup of Life Immortal, the Graal, where-in beats the Heart ofthe Mystery with the life-blood of all her true-born kin. To drinkfrom her cup is to sup from the Well of Everlasting Youth, to satethe thirst of the grave with the ichor of the gods.45"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Path itself is personified in the form of the beast whichtypifies its crooked and ever-changing nature - the Serpent, andthus, in its mythological apotheosis, the Dragon: the Encircler ofthe Great Year. The Great Dragon is the symbol of the centralarcanum. Shaitan and Lilith represent the bifurcate or doublenature implicit in this identification. They are the twin serpents(Ob and Od - the Black and the Red Snake) or twin aspects ofthe Ophidian Power. He, the transmitter of the sacred venomwhich arouses the Oracle, and She, the Utterer of the Revelation.The Daimon, in mediating between the twain extremities of thePath, is said to walk upon both the Head and the Tail of theDragon. This symbolises the synastrian theandry of the Aspirant(Desire) and the Object of Aspiration (Desired) in the singularityof the Point (Az, Desire Itself). The mediator, in aligning theAlpha and Omega of the Path, thus creates the Ouroboros: theCircle or \"Empty Point\". Within this magical horizon the manifoldforces of the Current are focused and are transmitted through theVessel of the Initiate.In the realisation of Unity is the Hieros Gamos of the DivineArtist and the Muse, yet there is neither Lover nor Beloved - thereis naught but the Mystery of the Agapae. In assuming the double-form of the Opposer, the Adept achieves the Sacred Marriage ofLife and Death within the Temple of Flesh, and thus begets theChild. The Adept, the Perfected One, is each moment born anew,like the Phoenix rising within the Flame of Transmutation. He goesforth robed in the verdant hues of ever-new life, the Holy Fooldancing upon the Dragon's spine.The Adept is seemingly engaged in a dual process: firstly, theincarnative reification of the initiating intelligence/s to which themundane vehicle of flesh has become a physical place of ingress,and secondly, the disincarnative rarefaction of the Manifest intoOtherness. This duality is only apparent when the actuality-beyond-appearance is subject to the conventions of mythic termsand language, and there-by assumes an interpretable form. Thisform is the \"Idol\" forged to permit an outer comprehension of theMystery. It is here that the Truth and the Lie are revealed as theMask and the Face of Reality, the 'identity' of which istranscendent of all appearance. The symbolism of the \"OneImage\" combines the various guises of the Daimon in the protean46mask of 'form'; this is the liminal iconostasis or \"Lie\" whichconceals the Faceless Face of the Imageless One. The gold-blackicon of the Opposer is the final veil of the Otherness beyond.8The principles underlying the mystical formulae extant within thiswork are drawn from a tradition which is in current operation,namely the Tradition of the Sabbatic Mysteries. This Cultus hasits counterparts in various times and places throughout history,and it is this connection with other bodies of initiates through thecommon principles of Arte which creates the context for thesyncretic use of symbolism within this work. Given thisunderstanding, based upon the formulaic quintessentiality of theCurrent's expressions through the differing media of initiatorybodies, it is pertinent to draw the reader's attention to certainexamples of cultic praxes giving evidence of this innerhomogeneity.One may cite, for examples of the specialised applications of theOpposer Formulae within historical orthodoxies, the reversion ofBuddhist mantras by the so-called 'Black' Bon-pa Jhakris in Tibetand Nepal, or the reversion/superimposition of Christiansymbology within the assimilative praxes of the medieval EuropeanSorcerer, similarly within the latter-day syncretism of the Afro-american 'Ngan. More specifically, with bearing upon the spiritualprovenance of our present work, one may cite the Yatukan4 ofAncient Persia.It is said that under the auspices of a sorcerer named \"Aztya\",the sect of the Yatukih performed rites of inversion, based uponthe Zoroastrian var nirang - Ceremony of the Ordeal, inopposition to the orthodox practices of the day. It is believed thatthey did so as a means of nullifying the restrictive beliefs inherent4. Yatukan were also called Druguvanti - the People of the Lie. N.B. Drug/Druj (Pehlavi)= Lie; Draoga (Avestan) = Lie, the word of the snake; Drogha (Sanskrit), compare withDraugr (Old Icelandic) = Lie, having the significance of Dragon/vampire in myth;Aurdrach (Old Irish) = Lie, compare eordraca (Anglo-Saxon) which has the meaning'Earth Dragon'; Draoi (Gaelic) = Magician. Gi-trog (Old High German) = Demon orPhantom. Drakos = the mythical race of dragon-men in Walachia, hence Dracul meaning'Devil*. (Druid is a speculative derivation.)47"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"in orthodoxy and thereby signifying a transcendence of theaccepted order of the cosmos. If we are able to infer from certainco-temporaneous religious laws prohibiting the practice of sorceryand deva-worship5, coupled with the emphasis upon the snake as asymbol of evil, that such prohibitions and tabus arose out of thedesire to suppress an earlier belief system, we may then suggestthat the Yatukan were the practitioners of a magical systemperpetuating the primal mysteries of sorcery. An epithet of thissect is nihaniktom duvarisnih signifying 'Those who stalk in greatsecrecy'. This epithet is said to have been given because they hidthemselves in the congregation of the orthodox, whilst yetperforming their rites of sorcery - \"calling upon darkness\" andsacrificing the blood of wolves to Ahriman. Although the'blasphemy' of their rites was probably a response to, andaccentuated by, those who were outside of the cult, we may inferthat the nature of their practices incorporated formulae of ritualinversion and that their inner practices involved elements ofancestral propitiation and ophidian sorcery; elements which, ifborne out, are analogous to the practices of the Sabbatic Traditionin its present-day recension.It is important to realise, in reference to such applications of theOpposer Formula, that the rites of inversion are used by Adepts asfunctional techniques of extracting 'power' through an Otherness ofBelief and for creating a state of pure aesthesis - 'Virginity of theHand and Eye' - by the destruction of culturally enforced valuesand pre-conceived modes of thought and perception. By means ofthis formula a process of rectification is applied to the sensoryfaculties of the Seeker, a re-alignment to their pure state offunction. The application of this formula within 'rites ofblasphemy', to counterbalance the restrictive effect imposed uponperceptual freedom by any given orthodoxy, is only a facet of theentire formula and indeed is only an adjunctive deployed as isnecessitated by time and place. Ulterior to this field of applicationthe function of the Opposer Formula is, as previously stated, totranscend the accepted order of the cosmos by an inversion orreversal of its 'nature'. The purpose is to liberate the Adept, not to5. 'Daeva' in Old Persian, Avestan = Devil or evil spirit; in Sanskrit, as 'Deva', it has thesignificance of a benevolent spiritual entity, whereas in the Romany language there is theword 'Devel' meaning 'God'. Note also, in connection with ophiolatreia, that 'Devak' inAvestan means 'Worm' - Wyrm meaning Snake or Dragon.48enslave him, and thus the methodology of formulaic applicationmust not be restricted to or in itself. The nature of the CrookedPath is perpetual obliquity to Itself: Ex-stasis - the Continuum ofSelf-overcoming.Another noteworthy example of associated cultic practices is theworship of the Peacock-Angel and the Black Snake by the Yezidisof Mesopotamia. The Yezidis are a pagan tribal nation,traditionally centred in modern Kurdistan, whose religion is basedupon the reverence of Shaitan - \"He whose Name is not to bespoken\". The mysteries preserved in the Yezidic faith are directlyakin to, and indeed may originate from, those of the earlier spirit-worshipping Yatukan, both sects deriving from a commongeographical zone. The perpetuation of their faith, despite muchpersecution over the course of centuries, is still maintained todayin an area generally associated with Islamic orthodoxy.At a surface level the exact nature of Yezidic practices isconcealed by a syncretism which exhibits the influence of thenumerous beliefs which have existed in, or have passed through,their tribal locality, but unless one is aware of the Sufic influencein the creation of this syncretic fusion the symbolism of theYezidic faith will evade inner understanding.The Prophet and Chief Saint of the nation is the Sufi MasterAdi ibn Musafir el-Hakkari (b.1075 e.v), a Companion of SheikhAbd-al-Qadir al Gilani, the Founder of the Qadiriya Order ofSufis, and a Student of el-Ghazali. It was under the auspices ofSheikh Adi that the Yezidic faith attained cohesion during theTwelfth Century C.E. and it is the unifying influence afforded byhis guidance which suggests the important role of Sufi doctrine inthe formation of Yezidic religion. It would thus be relevant tosuggest an examination of their sacred texts, the Kitab al-Gilwah(Book of the Emergence) and the Mishaf Resh (The Black Book)6,in terms of the Sufi systems of word-substitution andalphanumeric cryptography, but we shall presently confineourselves to an analysis of their two main emblems - the PeacockAngel and the Black Snake.6. The authorship of the Kitab al-Gilwah is attributed to Sheikh Adi himself (died 1162e.v), and he is said to have dictated it to his secretary Sheikh Fakh'ruddin. The MishafResh, or Black Book, is attributed to one Hasan Basri (734 A.H). Both books are reputedlyconcealed within a silver reliquary.See glossary for further details concerning the origins and beliefs of the Yezidis.49"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Peacock-Angel, as mentioned above (section 7), is bothDeath and Devil, and yet its name, Melek Ta'us conceals othermeanings:-Melek is a homonym of Malik meaning 'King', Malik < malakathe root meaning 'to possess'. MaLaK from the triliteral rootMLK, signifies 'Angel': the Daimon or Higher Intelligence ofMan. Also Malka is used to denote both ghul and ifrit, the blackand white djinn, and thus the King, Malik, is He who 'possesses'or has sovereignty over all of the World's djinn.Ta'us meaning 'Peacock', is a homophone of Taaus meaning'Verdant Land'. This 'land' is the Adept made fertile, 'verdant',through the alchemical transformation symbolised by the bird ofmany colours. This transformation is facilitated through theagency of the Daimon or 'Sovereign' of the Soul. In connection,Khidir is referred to as 'The Green One' and hence denotes thequality of verdancy. He therefore signifies the bestowal of fertilityand may be regarded as the embodiment of the creative forcewhich motivates the activity of the Daimon or Higher Faculties ofthe Soul; he is thus, in personification, the quickening force ofSpring preparing the 'land' for new growth. The Peacock-Angel isthe symbolic consociation of these ideas in the glyphic nomial,Melek Ta'us, and there-in are unified the multivalent connotationsimplicit in the complex allegory of the divinely-guided pilgrimage:-The Seeker passing through the barren land, his Path marking theseasons of development with every step, his every step a realisationof another faculty, his every step a binding of the djinn, everyspirit bound is a secret gained that leads him to the Palace ofRoyal Consciousness - to the Kingship which is the Soul of thePeacock-Angel Itself.The meaning of the Black Snake is similarly concealed:-HaYYat meaning 'snake', is a homophone of HaYYat meaning'Life', also Hayyat is 'a courtyard or enclosure' and hence impliesthe sacred enclosure, circle or halka as defined by the serpent, theOuroboros. The 'serpent' in this context signifies 'the Circle of theWisdom of Life'. The contextual significance of the adjective'black' lies in the Yezidic tradition of anointing a graven likeness ofa snake with soot (soot // Sut). This 'blackening'7 is a consecration7. A similar practice of ritual 'blackening' may be found amongst the Maskarae of Persiaand the Dhulqarneni of Morocco, both of which are cultic predecessors of the present-daySabbatic Tradition. See also, Shah \"The Sufis', where-in a foundation of these ideas ispresented.50of Wisdom, both 'black' and 'charcoal' stem from the commonArabic root FHM, which also means 'to perceive', 'to be wise'.Indeed it is from the Yezidic ritual practice of collecting the sootfrom their sacred fires as a token of the undying, yet transmutable,essence of the eternal fire, that they came to bear the epithetCheragh Sonderan meaning 'The Extinguishers of the Light'; hencealso the Sufic maxim:-\"Da tariki, tariqat\"- \"In the darkness, The Path.\"One may cite many other sects and fraternities, all of whomhave employed such formulae as are to be found within the Poemand its illustrations; all of which have a common aim - a subtleinter-connection - which is veiled by the Arcanum of the Dragonas the All-Opposer.\"Say not, My Friend is heedless of my pain;The Cup he gives to me He too doth taste,Like Host that with his Guest the wine doth drain.Yet, while the Cup goes round the Block and Sword appear.Such Fate is his who with the Dragon drinks,While ardent shines the Summer Sun above the Plain.\"Words attributed to the Sufi Martyr andYezidi Saint Mansur al-Hallaj at his execution.It is the aim of this section of the commentary to elucidate andconnect, by way of alphanumerical, etymological and symbologicalcorrespondences, certain aspects of inner meaning which arecontained within the Poem. Certain of these important aspectshave been treated of previously, but it is nonetheless relevant toour purpose to extend the periphery of their context in order toimpress the integral role of the aforesaid connecting principles. Itis thus, by the meaningful juxtaposition of word, number andsymbol, that the nexes of cryptic signification are emphasised so asto constitute an inferential statement regarding the hidden natureand continuity of the \"Path\" as it is portrayed in this work. Inachieving this, certain methods of alphanumeric analysis have beenemployed; such methods belonging to the field of esoteric"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"philosophy and with which the reader may be familiar under thegeneral term of Gematria. For those acquainted with suchmethods and for such as are specifically interested in this mannerof study, the following techniques have been used throughout thiswork: Ilm-i-abjad, Nine Chambers, Temura, Notariqon andMetathesis. Where it is not stated it should be assumed that thelinguistic roots are variants of Old Persian: Avestan, Pehlavi,Mandaic, Arabic, or of Semitic origin. The numeration of lettersremains constant, except for differentiation in the value of finals,this however does not affect our present context.The following assumes the form of annotations and is but ananalysis of certain elements in the Poem, specifically thosesymbolised by the Urn, the Well, the Serpent, the Tree, theGuide, the Path and the Point. It is hoped that this will suffice tohint at those elements which remain concealed.The Urn of Khidir (V.I) is the Well of Immortality, the Graalof Blood from whence the Seeker drinks. It is identified with theBody, the Vessel of Transmission where-in evolves, reifyingthrough Time, the eternal nature of the Flesh. As the 'Body' itsymbolises the Vestment of Matter which gives Form untoEssence. These connections are affirmed by the Aramaic wordmana, meaning 'a robe, a vessel, a vehicle of the spirit', alsosignifying the Mind. \"Khidir's Urn\" is therefore a symbol of theMind-Body Vessel into which the Spell or Cipher of Khidir'sSpirit is placed; it is the source of Immortality identified with theBody as the Vessel of the Divine. Hence Mana Kasia - theHidden Vessel.Mana II Manna [Heb], sustenance from Heaven.Mana = MNA, by metathesis equates with AMN - Amen.MNA= 91, by abjad notation = TzA, recalling the root ITzAmeaning 'to grow, to be born', also a close homonymof SA.'Khidir' is the Sufi name of the Wandering Guide, whoseepithets permit an identification with the Tarot Atu 0 and thuswith the corresponding Hebrew letter, Aleph, whose numericalvalue is 1. He is therefore the embodiment of both the Void andof the Point from whence the Sacred Alphabet has its origination.53"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"KhDR = 224 = DRKh, meaning 'to walk, a journey', thussignifying the Path Itself.= IChVR meaning 'Union'.KhIDIR = 244 = (by abjad) RMD, meaning 'to be in deepsleep or trance'; thus inferring the altered state of consciousnesswhich is symbolised by Khidir, who is traditionally considered toembody the prophetic faculty of the Soul. From the root KhDR isthe word Khadar meaning 'to cut a Palm tree', that is, to releasethe force from the form. The Palm tree is a Sufic symbol ofBaraka or Spiritual Power and is also a symbol of the GreatFather in the Nasoraean Gnosis. The root KhDR and itsconnection to the tree/axis of power form the central motif for anumber of initiatory phrases. One such phrase is ElaKhaDiR,signifying 'Gold, Meat and Wine', which are emblems of thesacrament partaken of by the Initiate as an hypostasis of theWhole Body of the Tradition.'Az', Primal Concupiscence, is the dark and chaotic source ofthose powers which are personified in the Body of Lilith, the Ever-virgin Woman of Harlotries. Az is a possible contraction of Azhimeaning 'serpent'. In this connection the serpent is the scarlet flowof menstruation; it is the Red Snake, the river of ancestral bloodwhich flows from the Well of Life, the oracle of the Priestess.Hence the following alphanumeric equivalents:-Az = 8 = BAH, the threshold.= DD, the Beloved, the pleasure of love.= AHB, the Beloved, the Desire.Aina Hiia is the Well of Life, an epithet of female divine powerin the Nasoraean/Sabaean Gnosis.AINA HIIA = 62 + 26= SB + KhU.SB recalls the root SBa meaning 'to plunge' or 'to be immersed',also 'to enter into the dye-bath'. The connections of this rootbecome clearer given the following links:-Sabiya is the name which the Nasoraeans use for themselves,this name meaning 'Those who are immersed'. Sohbetiye, theCompanions, is a name used by the followers of Sheikh Adi. SBa54recalls Sa-ba-tu, the lunar rite of Inanna in Ancient Babylon, andthus the Sabbat, the mystery where-in the initiate is 'immersed' inthe Graal of Witchblood - the Wellspring of All Living. Se-be is anAccadian root which in canonical texts appears to signify 'to growold whilst growing young'. The Hebraic form ShBO is the root ofwords meaning 'to bind with an oath' and 'sevenfold'. Thesymbolic connection with a 'dye-bath' refers to the dyeing of therobe or the changing of the outer form. Suf is the wool orsubstance of the robe, subject to change through 'dyeing' ortransformation, Sophia - Wisdom, is the unchanging essencewithin the form. KhU is a root of words specifically connectedwith concepts of blood and kinship. In summation of thesemeanings derived from the Abjad of Aina hiia we may obtain thephrase: They who are immersed in the Well of Life are bound with theSacred Oath of Kinship and are dyed with the rejuvenating blood ofthe seven.AINA HIIA =62 + 26 = 88.88 = 44 x 2. 44 = DM, meaning'blood', hence denoting thebifurcate stream of the ophidianmenstruum latent within theGraal.88 + 44 = 132, the Well of Life over-flowing with the SacredBlood.132 = 44 x 3, thereby revealing the Triple Principleconcealed within this symbolism.AZ AINA HIIA = 8 + 62 + 62 (26 by metathesis) = 132.132 = QLB, the root of QaLB, meaning 'the Heart, the Centre'and also 'counterfeit' (The Lie). In Sufic Qabalah the triliteral rootQLB extends to form various significant words and phrases,amongst which the following are notable in connection to ourpresent derivation from Aina Hiia:- to become red, to extract theessence from the Palm tree, to turn a thing upside-down, to reverseor invert. These phrases connect significantly to the Formulae ofthe Opposer and to the symbolism of the Blood and the Tree.In the Gnosis preserved by the Sabeans from Ancient Sumero-Chaldean sources the Palm tree and the Well-spring symbolise55"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"respectively the Divine Father and Mother. This duality is unitedin the word 'stun or 'stuna, meaning 'trunk, column, or spine',rendered in Sanskrit as 'sthuna and in Old Persian as set-un. Thisword, unifying both masculine and feminine deific powers,provides a significant homonymic parallel with Set-un, a renderingof Shaitan. This connection is further accentuated by a certainManichean myth which relates how 'the Souls of the Dead ascendto the Moon during the bright fortnight of its lunation, until theFifteenth Night - the Full Moon - when the lunar power isconjoined with that of the Sun and the Souls of the Dead ascendto Perfection in a column, setun, of glory'. It is of note that in thisrecension of the Gnosis the word set-un refers to the PerfectedBody as a whole and thus to the 'Vessel' where-in the Spirit isenshrined. By connection, the Opposer as Shaitan or Set-un isliterally 'the Column of the Path' and the 'Body' of the Tradition.Cognate with the symbols of the Tree and the Well are the Phallusand Kteis, the Priest and Priestess, the Sun and the Moon, and intheriomorphic terms the Snake and Dove, where-in are theatavistic powers of the Sa and the Ba. By the union of the Dyadthe Whole Body - Set-un - is reified and the Child ofManifestation conceived.HIIA meaning 'Life' is a homonym of Hiyyat, a snake. (HIIA isalso a word used as a meditational glyph of the power of Life inthe Illuminist Sect of the Roshaniya.)'Ur, also meaning 'Life', is a name of the Great Dragon used bythe Mandaeans. 'Ur is the Child and Consort of Ruha, the PrimalMother of Darkness.' Ur II Aur, Semitic for 'Light'.

The Seven Breaths are the Childrenborn of her marriage to the Dragon 'Ur, these being named:Shamish, Sin, Nirigh, Bel, Enwo, Liwet and Kiwan. The SevenChildren of the Dragon are the Points of Ingress for the Breath of56the Void to the Manifest, and thereby co-relate to the sevensubtle centres of the Body. The activation of these seven points isbrought about through the disciplines already alluded to in thiswork; thus is the Divine Breath transmitted through the physicalvehicle of the Adept.The One beyond the Seven is the Keystone of the Crown: thePoint QTB. QUTUB reduces to the triliteral root QTB = 111,which by abjad notation = QYA. QYA means 'to create the void,emptiness'. QYA is pronounced \"Kia\", and is thus directly linkedvia homonymic equivalence to the concept of the Kia as it is to befound, with identical meaning, in the Zos Kia Cultus, the magico-aesthetic recension of the Sabbatic Mysteries as formulated by theadepts Zos vel Thanatos and Aossic Aiwass.111= Aleph spelt in full: ALPh. Aleph/Alif/Alpha/A is the firstletter of the Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Latin alphabets, it denotesthe Point of Beginnings or Initiation. One of the earliest forms ofthe letter Alif was in the simple form of a circle or halka; withinthis circle the seven vowels are immanent and, in extension, arerepresentative of the seven forces which are attenuated in ourperception as the Heptanomis: the Seven Stars, the seven planetsof classical mythology, the seven breaths of life, the seven handfulsof earth, the seven gates of the underworld et alia. The 'Seven'represent the rays of the Quintessential Current of Magick andshow forth the constituent energies of the Circle or Horizon ofReality. The arcana of this mystery are preserved in the Gnosiswhose manifest forms or 'vehicles' may be seen throughouthistory, from amongst whom we may exemplify the teachings ofAztya, Yezid and Dhu'l-qarnen. In connection to the last name,one may note that the circular form of Alif became two-horned torepresent the Bull (Alif means 'Ox'.) and thus the Two-hornedOne, Dhu'l-qamen (lit. 'Two-horned One' or 'Lord of the TwoAges'), who is a form of the Initiator and a symbol of theInitiating Force Itself. In contraction the circle of Aleph is thePoint, the Silence, where-in the whole cipher of the mysteries isimmanent.The triplicity of 111 represents the triangle where-in the Pointof Unity is centred and thus equates with the symbol of the Eye inthe Triangle. The tri-unity of this symbolism is that of thePrinciple which governs the Triplicities of the Quintessence andwhich is, in ritual terms, communicated through the sacramental57"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"elements of Water, Salt and Fire. This Sacred Triplicity conveyscertain arcana which have as their pattern the Moon in its waxing,full and waning phases. These arcana, as transmitted in onerecension of the Tradition, are encoded in the attribution of thetwenty-eight days of the lunar month to the letters of the Arabicalphabet and in the foundation of that language upon triliteralroots, each of which conveys a permutation of the SacredTriplicities. This mystery is reflected in the Ninety-nine (33 x 3)Names of Allah, the One-hundredth Name being the Secret orLost Name of God. This Secret Name is represented by the letterQ, which has the numerical value of 100. The letter Qaf or Qophsymbolises the final element reifed from the triplicities, the secret-ion, and corresponds to the lunar current in totality. Thus is therean identity between the Lunar Arcana as transmitted by certainMystical Traditions and the Lost Name of God. Here a mysteryof immense antiquity is but lightly touched upon, a mystery whosevessels of transmission are oft' concealed by the veil and shadowof symbol and meaning, veiled - even unto those who are theCommunicants of the Secret, veiled - until the Age is aligned tothe Moment of Revelation.Qala anat qadmaii d HiiaThis mystery is recounted, in echo, upon the beads of theMystic's rosary, for he tells the Sebil-el-ward8, the Path of the Rose,and with each bead the round of Fate is turned.

Rather than his ownidentity dissolving within the Absolute State of Being, merging andunifying like the droplet within the ocean, the Adept realiseshimself as Absolute: a Perfected Unique Being, and thus as anActive Principle of New Creation. Taking Himself to be the Handof Fate, the struggle of the Adept is that of Lucifer: a War againstThat which resists or denies his Will to become the Sole andUnique One, a Singularity of Unique Power, the Polestar of hisown Universe: QUTUB.\"If ye do not recognise God, at least recognise his signs.

Rishon is the Man of Clay within whom thevital energy of spirit/kundalini lies unawakened.

Within the Mandaean recension ofthis doctrine these twain forms are named Adam Pagria and AdamKasia respectively. In masonic symbolism they are represented bythe Rough and the Perfect Ashlar. It is of note that in theMandaean Gnosis there is a form of Adam, named Adakas Ziwa,who functions as the mediator between the twain forms of Pagriaand Kasia, and symbolises the process of transmutation betweenthe Old and the New Flesh.

The magicalform par excellence of energy. It is the apotheosis of the OphidianCurrent and the embodiment of the psycho-sexual and ancestralmysteries pertaining there-to. In sidereal terms the Dragon isrepresented by the constellation of Draco and in its seven-headedform corresponds to the seven stations of the pole-star during thecycle of the seven aeons or Great Year. In lore it is said that onemay only perceive a facet of the Dragon's Body and never witnessits totality, for it is perpetually engaged in the process of change.

AMagical formulation combining two concepts drawn from AncientPersian theology: Az and Zuroan Akarana. The former meaning'concupiscence' and being conceived of as the primal force offemale destructive energy. Az may be regarded as the apotheosisof the sexual power of which Lilith (Geh) is the anthropomorphicvehicle. The latter concept of this formulation is that of 'InfiniteTime'. Personified as Zurvan Akarana it is conceived of as maleand creative in nature, and is regarded as transcending the dualityof Light and Darkness; which are in turn personified as AhuraMazda and Ahriman: the Children of Infinite Time.By the marriage of Az and Zurvan Akarana in a single magicalname the Absolute is implied and characterised as both primordiallibidinous energy and boundless time. These characteristics aresynthesized and expressed within the glyph of the Dragon as theOuroboros of Eternity and as the Encircler of the Sacred Love-feast or Agapae. This formula expresses the continuum of ecstasistransmitted through the Circle of the High Sabbat of the Ages.Az'ra-il [Heb]: The Angel of Death. In myth it is said to be anentity of unspeakable beauty covered by a multitude of eyes - one68for every soul that has life. It is thus that Az'ra-il has beenidentified with the peacock, the bird of a thousand eyes. Hencealso the epithet 'Peacock-Angel', which is a Yezidic title ofShaitan. It is believed that every time somebody dies one of theAngel's eyes becomes blind. Az'ra-il is to be seen as a manifestform of Shaitan or Set-un as 'Death'.Aztya [Pers]: also occurring as Akhtya.

Aztya II Azoetia: the title of amagical text transmitting the Gnosis of the Quintessential Current.Black Snake: The Yezidi symbol of Life and Regeneration, andthe twin symbol of the Peacock (see sections 7, 8 and 9). Thereverence of the snake is one of the earliest terrene forms ofmagical practice and maintains a central role within the OccultTradition. The Ophidian Cultus is believed to have originated inthe ancient forms of occult practice transmitted through themigration of Naga-worshippers as both tribes and wanderingpriests. It has been thought that such practices may stem from theshamanic tradition native to the Turanians of Mongolia, althoughan earlier African source may also be posited. Regardless ofhistorical speculation there are survivals of the ancient tradition ofserpent-worship scattered throughout the earth.With regard to the material treated of in this book it is pertinent toremark that the Chaldean Adepts of this tradition were in antiquitythe cultic precursors of the Persian Druguvanti.

Their meetings, called Az-zabbat meaning 'the Forceful Occasion', were conducted by aform of the Man-in-black whom they called Dhu'l-qarnen, literallythe 'two-horned one'. Their circles of convocation were calledKafan meaning 'winding-sheet' or 'cerecloth', so-called because ofthe funerary garb of the sect and signifying their belief in thetransitory nature of the carnal form. In their rites they employed aritual knife called Adh'amme meaning 'Blood-letter'.

He is said to have refused this honorific actbecause it would be in breach of Divine Law to venerate any otherthan the One God. Iblis is hence considered to be the Defender ofthe Divine Unity. In defiance of Allah's command to breach hisown Divine Law, Iblis left Heaven and went forth upon the Earthin order to instruct Mankind. Through the Gnosis or 'fire'transmitted by Iblis, Mankind will come to embody the Truth ofthe Absolute and thus attain unto the State of the Divine Unity.

He is said to visit the same placebut once in every five hundred years; he is thus able to recall therise and fall of civilizations and the turning of the 'deserts toverdant land'. Khidir has been identified with various gods ofspring and regeneration, and has been syncretised with severalfigures belonging to Pagan, Christian and Muslim folklore - suchas St.George and Elias.

In the form of Khidir Elias he is believed to exist as adouble-entity; living on the sea as Khidir and on the land as Elias.He is therefore petitioned for aid according to one's circumstance,be it on earth or water.

Amongst theMandaeans the name occurs as Tawus Melka. Ta'us means'Peacock', a symbol of the alchemical processes of transmutationand the stages of development in the consciousness of the Seeker.The 'rainbow hues' of each feather denote the Kalas or colours ofthe rays comprising the Magical Current.There is a myth from old Zoroastrian sources which relates thatAhriman, the Spirit of Darkness, created the peacock and AhuraMazda, the Spirit of Light, created the Hawk. When Ahriman, theEvil One, was asked as to why he should create such a thing ofbeauty as the peacock, he replied to the effect that he could createanything, whether it be abomination or splendour. He created thepeacock to show that he could conceive of absolute beauty and72that his so-called 'evil' was likewise a matter of his own will andnot involuntary submission to aberrant compulsion. He thussought to illustrate that 'evil' was his chosen path of action in theuniverse created by Zurvan.

He is considered to bethe fallen angel, the enemy of God, and bears numerous epithetswhich are testimony to his abomination in the sight of man. TheSheitani are the legions of spirits under his authority, and areknown as the Djinn.

It is in this sense that I have sought to use the term.The historical manifestation of Sufism is considered to be as theinterior mystical dimension of Islam, although its lineages ofinitiation permeate throughout many forms or 'vehicles' of belief. Itssymbology and doctrine are Gnostic in essence and origin. It maybe said, by virtue of an initiatory mythopoesis, that the Tradition ofthe Sufi is the Eternal Initiatory Path of Truth . As such one shouldnot seek its essence whilst yet adhering to the limits imposed uponit from the outside; neither should it be perceived wholly inmundane terms of origin and derivation, or its adherents perceivedsolely in terms of their nominalisation as 'Sufis'.Talion [Lat]: lit.

The nature and age of this sect is obscure, but it appearsthat they constitute a survival of ancient Sumero-chaldean beliefsfar pre-dating the earliest forms of Zoroastrianism, the faith ofPersian orthodoxy. Persecution led to the dispersion of this sectand as a consequence their beliefs were disseminated throughoutAsia Minor. Signs of their practices may be seen in the Graeco-Roman religion of Mithras and in the secret practices ofGnosticism. It is also possible that certain practices found theirway into Europe via Walachia, as may be evidenced by certainetymological links.

As areligious group they gained spiritual cohesion in the twelfth centurye.v. under the auspices of Sheikh 'Adi ben Musafir. Although theYezidis were probably established as a tribal group before this date,it seems likely that their mundane social and religious cohesionoccurred around this time; their communities being essentially basedupon a Sufic structure. It was then, under the influence of theSheikh 'Adi, a Sufic Master, that they became \"the People of aBook\" (Kitab al-Gilwah) and thereby sought to alleviate persecutionfrom the Mohammedan orthodoxy, who only tolerated those peoplein possession of a \"Book from God\". Nonetheless, incontradistinction to the former statement, the Yezidis claim to havepossessed Holy Books prior to the aforementioned texts (seeSection 8). These were destroyed or lost amid the persecutionswhich they suffered, at various hands, over the course of manycenturies. The role of Sheikh 'Adi is central to their faith since itwas he who received their Sacred Text, the Kitab al-Gilwah, fromthe Peacock-Angel and established the social and religious order75"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"within their culture. However, it is important to state that theYezidis have survived for centuries through nominal conversion tothe orthodox and dominant beliefs around them, despite theirconsideration as being \"beyond the pale of the community\".Consequently, any statement regarding their adherence to suchorthodox beliefs as Christianity or Islam may be regarded as bothsyncretic and survivalist. In Truth, the essence of their faith is secretand, when purged of the externals which veil this essence, itpartakes of the gnosis transmitted from a source anterior tohistorical perspective. According to the Yezidis themselves, thesurvival of their ancient religion is assured because of their faith inMelek Ta'us and, through his benediction, the transmigration of thefaithful Souls from one incarnation to the another.The Yezidis derive from one 'Yezid', an unknown personagewho is believed to be their Ancestral Father and is identified withDivine Power Itself. ('Azed - God, Yazed - Devil ). Their beliefssuperficially show a fusion of early Paganism, Gnosticism,Nestorian Christianity and Islam, but if viewed as Sufic theirsyncretism becomes a meaningful encryption of belief in a spiritualessence. The principal object of their 'worship' is Melek Ta'us,whom they propitiate as both Serpent and Peacock. Besides thePeacock-Angel they revere Yezid and Sheikh 'Adi. This seems toconstitute some form of trinity. They also revere Seven Gods orPowers, whom they identify or syncretize with Seven Archangelsand various Sufic saints, amongst whom is the martyr Al-Hallaj. Itis of note that amongst their customs the Yezidis perform a ritualanti-clockwise circumambulation about a stone. This practice maystem from the worship of the Pillar of Stone Set-un, and laterbecoming syncretised or overlaid with an identical ritual praxis: an\"as if pilgrimage to the Stone at Mecca devised by Al-Hallaj.They also preserve the custom of praying toward the Sun and alsothe Pole-star, a ritual practice originating from vastly ancientsources. These and other such anomalous practices indicate ahidden source of their tradition. In the Mishaf Resh there areverses which indicate that the Yezidis consider themselves to havecome from Ancient Babylon. Furthermore, before they becameknown as Yezidis the chosen people of Melek Ta'us were said tohave been called 'Watnu'l-Haiyun'. This name may come from'Watnu'l-Haiyun', meaning 'the land of the serpents', givingfurther indication of their ancestry.76BIBLIOGRAPHYBARTON (G.A. )CONWAY (M.D.)DARAUL (A.)DROWER (E.S.)EMPSON (R.H.W.)FERGUSSON (J-)GRAY (L.H.)GUEST (J.S.)KBAL'AUSHAH (S.)MASSEY (G.)Tiamat, [published in American Oriental Journalvol. 15, no. 1, Boston, 1891]Demonology and Devil-Lore, 2 volumes, Chatto andWindus, 1879 [1878]Secret Societies, Citadel Press, 1989The Mandaeans of Iran and Iraq.
