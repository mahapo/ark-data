Th e Greeks tell us that Th eseus received a thread as a gift from Ariadne. With that thread he found his bearings in the labyrinth, located the Minotaur, and slew him. Th e myth says nothing about the traces that Th eseus left as he made his way through the labyrinth.What holds together the chapters of this book dedicated to some highly heterogeneous topics is the relation between the thread— the thread of nar-ration, which helps us to orient ourselves in the labyrinth of reality— and the traces. I have been a historian for some time: using such traces, I seek to narrate true stories (which at times have falsehoods as their object). Today it seems to me that none of the terms of that defi nition (narrate, traces, stories, true, false) can be taken for granted. When I began to learn my craft, toward the end of the 1950s, the prevailing attitude in the guild of historians was completely diff erent. Writing narrative history was not considered a matter for serious refl ection. I remember one exception to this rule: Arsenio Frugoni, who, as I understood later, returned now and then in his seminars in Pisa to the topic of the subjective nature of the narrative sources, which he had dis-cussed a few years earlier in his Arnaldo da Brescia. Frugoni suggested to me— I was in my second year at the University of Pisa— that I prepare a col-loquium on the school of the Annales, so I began to read Marc Bloch. In his Métier d’historien I ran into a page which many years later, though I was not fully aware of it, helped me to refl ect on traces of evidence. But in those days historians did not speak of traces and the trail they leave."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2 . introduction2. I refer to that distant background to explain to myself the unreasonable euphoria I felt when I wrote the fi rst sentences of my fi rst book. It seemed to me that the documents on which I was working (inquisitorial trials) opened a broad range of narrative possibilities. Th e tendency to experiment in that direction, which also sprang from my family background, found both encour-agement and limits in the sources. But I was persuaded (and still am today) that between testimonies, both narrative and nonnarrative, and the reality to which they bear witness there exists a relationship that needs to be analyzed from time to time. Th e possibility that someone could radically put in doubt that relation did not even enter my mind.All this is part of the prehistory of the present book. In the second half of the 1960s the climate began to change. Some time later it was announced with great fanfare that historians write. I remember at fi rst remaining indiff erent to the hyperconstructionist (and, in fact, skeptical) implications of that reve-lation. It shows up in a passage of my essay “Spie” (1979), which considers the connection between deciphering traces and narration without mentioning any eventual skeptical objections. Th e turning point came for me only when, thanks to an essay of Arnaldo Momigliano’s, I realized the moral and po liti-cal (as well as cognitive) implications of the thesis that basically canceled the distinction between historical and fi ctional narrations. Th e afterword that I wrote (1984) for the Italian translation of Natalie Davis’s Th e Return of Martin Guerre (see chapter 4) registers that somewhat belated awareness.Th ose pages might be the place to begin reading the present book since they outline a program of study and its polemical objective. Or, more precisely, its inverse, the pars destruens came fi rst, as is perhaps always the case. Against the tendency of postmodern skepticism to blur the borders between fi ctional and historical narrations, in the name of the constructive element they share, I proposed a view of the relation between the two as a competition for the repre sen ta tion of reality. But rather than trench warfare, I hypothesized a confl ict made up of challenges and reciprocal, hybrid borrowings. If this was how things stood, one could not combat neoskepticism by going back to old certitudes. We have to learn from the enemy in order to oppose it more effi caciously.Th ese are the hypotheses which, in the course of twenty years, have ori-ented the studies included in this volume. Only gradually did I discern the signifi cance of the challenge in Bertolt Brecht’s “bad new things” (see chapter 1) or the choice of terrain on which to challenge it. Today the postmodernists"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"introduction . 3seem less strident and less confi dent: the winds of fashion may already be blowing from another quarter, but it does not matter. Th e diffi culties ensuing from that discussion and the attempts to resolve them remain.3. Th e skeptical attack on the scholarly nature of historical narrations has emphasized their subjectivity, which allegedly likens them to fi ctional narra-tives. Historical narratives speak to us less about reality than they do about whoever has constructed them. It is useless to object that a constructive ele-ment is present to some extent even in the so- called hard sciences: they, too, have been the object of similar criticism. Let us talk instead about historiog-raphy. We know that historiography has a subjective component, but the radi-cal conclusions which the skeptics have drawn from that fact did not consider a fundamental shift about which Marc Bloch spoke in his posthumous meth-odological refl ections: “Today [1942– 1943], even in the most spontaneous and voluntary testimonies, what the text tells us no longer constitutes the pri-mary object of our attention.” Th e Mémoires of Saint- Simon or the lives of early medieval saints interest us not so much for their allusions to actual facts, which are often invented, as for the light they throw on the mentality of the writers of those texts. “Despite our inevitable subordination to the past,” Bloch continues, “we have freed ourselves at least to the extent that, eternally condemned to know only by means of its ‘tracks,’ we are nevertheless success-ful in knowing far more of the past than the past itself had thought it good to tell us. . . . Properly speaking, it is a glorious victory of mind over its material.” In another passage in Métier d’historien Bloch responds to the doubts of those who lament the impossibility of ascertaining what happened in single his-torical events— for example, the circumstances in which the gunshots were fi red that ignited the revolution of 1848 in Paris. Bloch observes that such skepticism does not touch on what lay behind the event but rather on men-talities, technology, society, and economics: “What is most profound in his-tory may also be the most certain.” Against the positivist skepticism that cast doubt on the believability of one document or another, Bloch off ered, on the one hand, involuntary testimonies, and on the other, the possibility of isolating within voluntary testimonies an involuntary, hence deeper, core.Against the radically antipositivist skepticism which attacks the reliability of texts as such, one can use a line of argument that is in some way analogous to Bloch’s. By digging into the texts, against the intentions of whoever produced them, uncontrolled voices can be made to emerge: for example, those of the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 . introductionwomen or men who, in witchcraft trials, eluded the ste reo types suggested by the judges. In medieval romances we can trace involuntary historical testimo-nies relating to habits and customs, isolating fragments of truth within the fi ction. Th is is a discovery that today seems to us almost banal, but toward the mid– seventeenth century, in Paris, when it was explicitly formulated for the fi rst time (chapter 5), it had a paradoxical ring to it. Th is was a research strategy not too diff erent from the one Bloch describes concerning the lives of early medieval saints. In the long run, the gap opened up by this simultane-ously detached and participatory attitude toward the literature of the past had unpredictable results. Th ree centuries later, we fi nd the great scholar Erich Auerbach taking a similar path in his analysis of Voltaire and Stendhal when he read the Lettres philosophiques and Le Rouge et le Noir not as historical docu-ments but as texts impregnated with history. Interpretation is infi nite, even though its contents are not unlimited: Auerbach’s interpretations can be read in a diff erent perspective, following the intentions and the perspective of their author, by making use of the traces that he himself left more or less involun-tarily (chapters 7 and 10). Fiction, fed by history, becomes material for histori-cal refl ection or else for fi ction, and so on. Th is unpredictable intermingling can come together in a knot, or in a name (chapter 9).Reading historical testimonies against the grain, as Walter Benjamin suggested— that is, against the intentions of the person or persons produc-ing them (even if those intentions must of course be taken into account)— means supposing that every text includes uncontrolled elements. Th e same can be said of literary texts that strive to present an autonomous reality. Some-thing opaque insinuates itself into them as well, much like the perceptions that sight registers without understanding them, as does the impassible eye of the camera. Th is is a theme that Siegfried Kracauer acquired from Proust, who in turn was reworking a passage of Saint- Simon (chapter 13). Th ese opaque zones are some of the traces which a text— any text— leaves behind. I have found them when I sought to refl ect on my own studies in two experiments sug-gested by temporal distance (and, in one case, spatial distance as well: chap-ters 14 and 15).4. To draw up an inventory of the forms taken on by fi ction in the ser vice of truth would obviously be impossible.

Th e thin narrative thread of the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce enabled Jean- Jacques Barthélemy to or ga nize an enormous mass of anti-quarian data, making them accessible, in the span of a century, to a vast public scattered throughout Eu rope (chapter 8). Montaigne is considered an excep-tion; Barthélemy, at most an anomaly. But both men refer back to a choice that shaped, without my being aware of it at fi rst, much of the physiognomy of the present book. Given that it is an area infested with commonplaces and gener-alities, the relation between historical narration and fi ctional narration had to be confronted in the most concrete manner possible, through a series of ex-amples. Chapter 6, which seeks to reconstruct “not the exception but the rule,” falls within this viewpoint, but, to be accurate, it treats an exception. In retrospect, I realized that most of the topics discussed were not illustrations or examples referring to a preexistent norm, but rather cases: stories (or histo-ries) in miniature which, according to the defi nition of André Jolles, pose a question without furnishing the answer, thus signaling an unsolved diffi -culty. When I began to work on documents which speak of a Jew who was the only surviving witness to the extermination of his community, I thought that cases like this one showed just how unsustainable the position was of the skeptics who, de facto, equated fi ctional narration and historical narration. If an account is based on a single document, how is it possible to avoid ques-tioning its authenticity (chapter 12)? At almost the same time, I found myself asking the very same question about a text from the fi fth century, a letter of Bishop Severus of Minorca (chapter 2) recounting an early case of Christian- Jewish confl ict. Here the unus testis, the only surviving witness, is a document, not an individual, as also occurs in medieval legal writings which refl ect on the characteristics of a community (u n ive r si t a s) through the fi ctional case of a unique survivor.5. From the thicket of relations between fi ction and truth we have seen a third term emerge: the false, the nonauthentic— the pretense that advertises itself as true. Naturally, after Marc Bloch (Les rois thaumaturges) and Georges Lefebvre (La grande peur de 1789), no one will think it useless to study false legends, false events, or false documents, but it is indispensable to take a preliminary stand, on each occasion, about their falsity or authenticity. On this point I have nothing to add regarding the infamous anti- Semitic Protocols"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 . introductionof the Elders of Zion (chapter 11). I have limited my eff orts to a parallel reading of the fabricated Protocols and their principal source, the imaginary dialogue of Maurice Joly. From this comparison sprout not only many very bad old things but also some “bad new things,” unpleasant truths which merit refl ection.Historians, Aristotle tells us (Poetics 51b), speak of what has been (of the true, of the real world); and poets, of what might have been (of the possible). But, of course, truth is a point of arrival, not a point of departure. Th e histo-rian’s craft (and, in a diff erent way, the poet’s) involves something that is part of everyone’s life: untangling the strands of the true, the false, and the fi c-tional which are the substance of our being in the world.Bologna, December 2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"71. Today, for some people, words such as truth and reality have become impossible to utter unless they are set off by quotation marks, written out or mimed. Th is ritual gesture, common in American academic circles even be-fore becoming a fairly standard practice, was meant to exorcise the specter of a thoughtless positivism: the attitude of those who hold that reality is know-able directly without intermediaries. Behind this often encountered polemic one usually comes across a skeptical position, variously argued. Moral, po liti cal, and intellectual objections have been formulated against it, even by me. But to simply keep ourselves virtuously aloof from the exaggerations of the positivists and the skeptics would serve no purpose. Walter Benjamin recalls a Brechtian maxim: “Don’t start from the good old things but the bad new ones.” Skeptics and deconstructionists almost always react to real questions in a dramatically inadequate way. Elsewhere I have argued against their responses, but here I would like to consider some of their basic assumptions.2. A false statement, a true statement, and an invented statement do not present any diff erences among themselves, from a formal point of view. When Emile Benveniste studied the tenses of the French verb he did not hesitate to use examples taken from both romances and histories. In a short novel en-titled Pontius Pilate Roger Caillois astutely explored the implications of this analogy. It is nighttime: the next morning Jesus will be tried. Pilate has not yet decided on the sentence. To persuade him to choose condemnation, some-one predicts a long series of events that would follow the death of Jesus: some CHAPTER 1Description and Citationfor arnaldo momigliano"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 . description and citationare important, others are insignifi cant— but, as the reader grasps, all are true. Th e next day Pilate decides to absolve the accused. Th e disciples repudiate Jesus; the history of the world takes a diff erent path. Th e affi nity between fi ction and history brings to mind those paintings by Magritte which with-out a break portray a landscape and its refl ection in a broken mirror.To say that a historical narrative resembles a fi ctional one is obvious enough. More interesting is to ask ourselves why we perceive as real the events recounted in a work of history. Usually it is a result produced by both textual and extratextual elements. I shall focus on the latter and attempt to show some procedures, associated with literary conventions, with which both an-cient and modern historians have attempted to communicate that “eff ect of reality” which they considered an essential part of the task they had set for themselves.3. We can begin with a fragment from the Universal History of Polybius (34: 4, 4), quoted by Strabo. To demonstrate Homer’s truthfulness, Polybius writes: “Th e object of history is truth, as when in the cata logue of ships the poet describes the features of the several localities, calling one city ‘rocky,’ another ‘frontier- placed,’ another ‘with wealth of doves,’ or ‘hard by the sea.’ But the object of picturesque detail is vividness, as when he introduces men fi ghting; and that of mythological allusion is to give plea sure or rouse won-der.” In opposing history to myth, Homer stands squarely on the side of his-tory and of truth: the purpose (t e l os) to which his poetry tends is in fact “vividness” (e n arg e i an).In some manuscripts we fi nd energeian rather than enargeian, but the con-text makes us think that the second is the more convincing reading. A simi-lar confusion occurs in the manuscript tradition of a passage of Aristotle’s Rhetoric (1411 b, 33– 34), echoed in much later texts and coming down to our own day. In actual fact, the two words have nothing in common: energeia signifi es “act, activity, energy”; enargeia, “clarity, vividness.” Th e importance of the fi rst term in Aristotelian terminology, decisive for the Eu ro pe an intel-lectual lexicon, explains why energeia has survived in so many languages: it suffi ces to think of “energia,” “energy,” “énergie,” and so forth. Enargeia instead died out. But it is possible to reconstruct its meaning: more precisely, the con-stellation of meanings that revolve about it.In the Homeric poems, often seen as supreme examples of enargeia, the word does not appear. We fi nd enargés, associated with the “manifest pres-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"description and citation . 9ence” of the gods (Iliad, 20: 131; Odyssey, 16: 161), and a connected adjective, ar-gos, which signifi es “white, brilliant”— like a goose, like an ox— or “rapid.” According to Pierre Chantraine, “we must suppose at its origin a notion that expresses both the blinding whiteness of lightning and velocity.” Enargés can be translated, depending on the context, as “clear” or “tangible.” Like enargeia, it is a word that can be connected to a sphere of immediate experience, as another fragment from Polybius suggests (20: 12, 8): “To see an operation with one’s eyes is not like merely hearing a description of it. It is, indeed, quite another thing; and the confi dence which such vivid experience gives is always greatly advantageous. . . .” Th is passage, as well as Homer’s cited above, con-cerns historical knowledge. In both, enargeia is considered a guarantee of truth.Th e ancient historian had to communicate the truth regarding that of which he was speaking by using enargeia to move and convince his readers: a technical term which, according to the author of the treatise On the Sublime (15: 2), marked the aim of the orators, which was diff erent from that of the poets, who attempted to enthrall their public. Th e Latin rhetorical tradition repeatedly tried to fi nd terms equivalent to enargeia. Quintilian (Institutio Oratoria, 4: 2, 63) proposed evidentia in narratione. “Palpability, as far as I understand the term, is no doubt a great virtue, when a truth requires not merely to be told, but to some extent obtruded, still it may be included under lucidity.” In another passage (6: 2, 32), Quintilian noted that Cicero had used, as synonyms for enargeia, illustratio and evidentia, “illumination and actu-ality, which makes us seem not so much to narrate as to exhibit the actual scene, while our emotions will be no less actively stirred than if we were pres-ent at the actual occurrence.” In eff ect, for Cicero, “inlustris . . . oratio” indi-cated “the part of the speech that places, in a matter of speaking, the fact be-fore the eyes.” Th e anonymous author of the Rhetorica ad Herennium used similar words to defi ne demonstratio: “It is ocular demonstration when an event is so described in words that the business seems to be enacted and the subject to pass vividly before our eyes.”Demonstratio. Th e terminology corresponding to this word in the Eu ro-pe an languages—dimostrazione, demonstration, démonstration, and so forth— conceals under a Euclidean veil a rhetorical nucleus. Demonstratio designated the orator’s gesture that indicated an invisible object, rendering it almost palpable—enargés—to the listener, thanks to the almost magical power of the words themselves. Similarly, the historian succeeded in communicating"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 . description and citationto readers his own experience— direct, as a witness, or indirect— placing an invisible reality before their eyes. Enargeia was a means to communicate the autopsia—in other words, immediate vision— by virtue of style.4. Even Demetrius, the author of the famous treatise On Style (long errone-ously identifi ed with Demetrius of Phalerum), dedicated a relatively long sec-tion to enargeia, describing it as a stylistic eff ect that ensues from a description which contains nothing superfl uous. After citing a Homeric simile (Iliad, 21: 257), he observed: “We shall treat fi rst of vividness, which arises from an ex-act narration overlooking no detail and cutting out nothing.” Further on, however, we run into a broader defi nition, which identifi es as examples of “viv-idness” even the cacophony and the onomatopoeic words used by Homer. We seem to have veered away from the discussion of historical method from which we began, but only apparently so. Th e defi nition of enargeia as an accumula-tion of particulars casts an unexpected light on the claim, recurring among Greek historians, that they have recorded every event, or at least all the sig-nifi cant ones. In a society in which archives were rare and oral culture still dominated, Homer off ered historians a model that was both stylistic and cognitive.In chapter 1 of Mimesis, Erich Auerbach juxtaposed two diff erent types of narration: Homer’s analytical richness and the Bible’s synthetic concision. Th e importance of the Homeric narrative style for the birth in Greece of a new way to represent the human body on the one hand, and of history as a literary genre on the other, has been underlined by E. H. Gombrich and Hermann Stras-burger. Th e latter, one of the scholars who has most profi tably discussed the theoretical implications of enargeia, has noted that the term assumed a more technical signifi cance in the Hellenistic age, when historians such as Duris of Samos and his disciple Philarchus created a new type of historiography, in-spired by the tragic poets and aspiring to mimetic eff ects.5. Th us far we have portrayed enargeia as a notion bordering historiography and rhetoric, but painting needs to be added to this semantic sphere. Here is a meta phor taken from Plato’s dialogue the Statesman: “And our discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline, but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"description and citation . 11Th ese implications of enargeia emerge fully, at a distance of many centu-ries, in a passage from the Images of Philostratus the Younger, a famous col-lection of descriptions (e k p h ra se i s) of artworks, presumably imaginary. We read the following passage in an account of a painting representing the shield of Pyrrhus, inspired by one of the shields of Achilles in the Iliad, the model for this literary genre: “And if you should also notice the herd of cattle which press forward to their pasture followed by the herdsmen, you might not, in-deed, marvel at the colour, although the whole scene is made of gold and tin, but the fact that you can almost hear the cows lowing in the painting and that the river along the banks of which are the cows seems to be making a splashing sound,— is not that the height of vividness [enargeia]?”Th is rhetorical query could be compared to an orator’s gesturing: a dem-onstratio intended to present an invisible object, made vivid and almost tan-gible by the power of the ekphrasis. At this point we can grasp why Plutarch, in his treatise De gloria athenensium (“On the Fame of the Athenians”) (347a), compared a painting by Euphranor representing the battle of Mantinea to Th ucydides’ description of that same battle. Plutarch praised the pictorial vivacity [graphiké enargeia] of Th ucydides; then he clarifi ed the theoretical implications of the comparison:Simonides, however, calls painting inarticulate poetry and poetry articulate painting: for the actions which paint ers portray as taking place at the moment literature narrates and rec ords after they have taken place. Even though artists with colour and design, and writers with words and phrases, represent the same subjects, they diff er in the material and the manner of their imitation; and yet the underlying end and aim of both is one and the same; the most eff ective histo-rian is he who, by a vivid repre sen ta tion of emotions and characters, makes his narration like a painting. Assuredly Th ucydides is always striving for this vivid-ness in his writing, since it is his desire to make the reader a spectator, as it were, and to produce vividly in the minds of those who peruse his narrative the emo-tions of amazement and consternation which were experienced by those who beheld them.6. Some of the leading authorities on Greek and Roman history have recog-nized in the ekphrasis, along with Plutarch, the purpose of historical narra-tion. Th e ekphrasis, writes Hermann Strasburger, was a concept embracing an extensive sphere containing pathos- ridden battle scenes, the Athens plague about which Th ucydides spoke, and geographic and ethnographic"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 . description and citationdescriptions (ekphraseis tou topou). If enargeia was the purpose of the ek-phrasis, truth was the result of enargeia. We can imagine a sequence of this type: historical narration— description—vividness—truth. Th e diff erence between our concept of history and that of the ancients could be summed up as follows: for the Greeks and Romans historical truth was based on evidentia (the Latin equivalent of enargeia proposed by Quintilian); for us, on evidence.Th is is not an oversimplifi cation. In a passage of the Institutio Oratoria (4 : 2, 64– 65) Quintilian observed that there were those who protested against the use of evidentia in narratione: “Some, however, regard this quality as ac-tually being injurious at times, on the ground that in certain cases it is desir-able to obscure the truth. Th e contention is, however, absurd. For he who de-sires to obscure the situation will state what is false in lieu of the truth, but must still strive to secure an appearance of palpability for the facts which he narrates.”Th is fair- minded description of the comportment of lawyers could have been extended to historians, given the intimate relationship between history and rhetoric. Th e defi nitive criterion of truth did not correspond to the reac-tions of the public. And yet truth was considered above all a question of per-suasion, linked only marginally to an objective weighing of the facts.7. For historians who, from the sixteenth century on, considered themselves heirs of Herodotus, Th ucydides, and Livy, this was an obvious conclusion. Th e breach emerged later. Only in the second half of the seventeenth century did one begin to analyze systematically the diff erences between primary and secondary sources. In his famous essay “Ancient History and the Antiquar-ian,” Arnaldo Momigliano demonstrated that this decisive contribution to the historical method came from antiquarians who used nonliterary evidence to reconstruct facts connected to religion, to po liti cal or administrative institu-tions, to the economy— spheres not touched upon by historians tendentiously oriented toward po liti cal and military history and toward the present. In the face of the corrosive criticism, sometimes taken to paradoxical limits, which skeptics like La Mothe Le Vayer directed against Greek and Roman histori-ans, antiquarians objected that medals, coins, statues, and inscriptions of-fered a mass of much more solid documentary material, and more reliable, as well, compared to literary sources polluted by errors, superstitions, or lies."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"description and citation . 13Modern historical writing came into being from the convergence— actually realized for the fi rst time in the work of Edward Gibbon— between two dif-ferent intellectual traditions: Voltaire’s type of histoire philosophique and an-tiquarian research.8. But the trajectory vigorously argued by Momigliano should be moved up by a century. In the mid– sixteenth century both the crisis of the skeptics and its dissipation as a consequence of antiquarian labors were lucidly formulated by a philologist and antiquarian of exceptional qualities, Francesco Robortello of Udine. He is known today especially for a pioneering work on the emenda-tion of ancient texts (1557), which has received the attention it deserves. Th e few solid pages written on Robortello’s De historica facultate disputatio (154 8) have instead met a diff erent fate. Its success in the sixteenth century, exem-plifi ed by its posthumous inclusion in the fi rst collection of writings on the historical method (Artis historicae penus, 1579), was often followed, in times closer to our own, by befuddled and superfi cial readings.Robortello was fully cognizant of the originality of these pages. He was little more than thirty years old, teaching at the University of Pisa and a friend of the great philologist Pier Vettori. In his usual aggressive tone, Robortello declared in his dedication to Lelio Torelli (the philologist and ju-rist who a few years later would publish for the fi rst time the famous Floren-tine manuscript of the Pandects) that he had tried to accomplish something totally new: to bring to light the art and method hidden in historical writing.Th e purpose of the historian, Robortello begins, is narration, although im-mediately afterward he clarifi es this: the historian is the one who “narrates and explains.” Th is is followed by still another elucidation: the historian explains “the actions carried out by men themselves” (quas ipsi homines gerunt). Th e historian does not invent, but explains (non est effi ctor rerum, sed explanator). History is diff erent from poetry, and, perhaps, in suggesting examples of what is just and unjust, it is superior to philosophy. Th e importance of this last state-ment emerges a few pages later when Robortello cites the critique, which he considered unpublished, attributed to Sextus Empiricus, “a Greek author who has expounded all the ideas of the Pyrrhonists.” Th is is followed by a long quo-tation, translated into Latin but with a sprinkling of Greek words and phrases, from the treatise Adversus mathematicos (1: 252– 260), a key and, in a sense, unique source on Greek skepticism."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14 . description and citationRobortello was justifi ably proud to have drawn attention to the novelty of this quotation. At that par tic u lar moment Sextus Empiricus was still primarily just a name. He would make his grand entrance in Eu ro pe an phi-losophy in 1562 when Henri Estienne translated his Outlines of Pyrrhonism into Latin. It has been said that before that, Sextus had only one modern reader, Gian Francesco Pico, author of an Examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium (“Examination of the Vacuity of Pagan Philosophy”), a harsh critique written in the name of the intransigent Christianity of Savonarola, of whom he was a follower. Th is vast work, based on the still- unpublished writings of Sextus, contained pages used by Robortello almost thirty years later. But Robortello may not have seen them: even if he had, in any case, he used the Greek text, probably MS. Laur. 85, 11, dated 1465, which includes two works by Sextus: the Outlines of Pyrrhonism and the Adversus mathematicos.Th e second part of the latter work deals with the grammarians, some of whom— the celebrated Dionysius, surnamed Th rax, among them— had main-tained that grammar has a historical component. Sextus Empiricus objected that history lacks method: it is not a techné (in Latin, ars) but a simple accu-mulation of facts, irrelevant, doubtful, or mythical. Against this, Robortello attempted to demonstrate the existence of an ars historica: a polemical ex-pression which inspired the title of an anthology such as the Artis historicae penus, conceived as a response, though too polemical, to the spread of skepti-cism about historiography.Robortello begins his argument by affi rming that the methodological ele-ment in history is identifi able with rhetoric. In fact, he concedes, the ancients, as Cicero reminds us (De oratore 2), wrote annals totally lacking in method, free of rhetorical preoccupations. But if we invent (e ffi ngantur) speeches and actions that are probable and appropriate, as Th ucydides did, we can see clearly that rhetoric is the mother of history.Robortello’s position has been identifi ed with this response, which in itself had nothing especially original about it. It has not been noted that the insis-tence on the capacity to invent (e ffi ngere) speeches contradicted the previous statement about the historian who does not invent but, rather, explains (non est effi ctor rerum, sed explanator). Above all, it has not been noticed that immedi-ately thereafter, Robortello takes a diff erent approach.Th e historian deals with actions, both public and private: and thus neces-sarily with the names of the persons involved in them. Th is, Robortello states,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"description and citation . 15is the par tic u lar element (“what Alcibiades did or experienced”) which Aris-totle had identifi ed in history, setting it against the universality of poetry. Behind this statement are Robortello’s labors on two books appearing that very year— 1548: the commentary to the Poetics of Aristotle, and an erudite piece, De nominibus Romanorum (On Roman Names). Th e name, that datum which is the backbone of the annalistic genre, brings along with it a refl ection on the nature of historical narration. In the praise which Aristotle lavishes on Homer for having initiated his narrations in the middle of things (in media res), Robortello reads an implicit invitation to historians to follow, instead, a chron-ological sequence, to recount “a long series of years.” Even if, Robortello muses, the hypothesis of a new cyclical beginning suggested by certain phi los o phers was true, historians must resolve to recount history commencing with those crude, rough beginnings of the human species that have been described by the poets: “But if the historian has to dedicate himself to this long progres-sion of years, clearly his competence must embrace all of antiquity: all that which concerns customs, the means of supporting oneself, the foundation of cities, the migrations of people.”Th us, for Robortello history is synonymous with antiquarianism, although quite diff erent from that congeries of trivial facts ridiculed by Sextus Em-piricus. And he goes on to say:Let Th ucydides set an example for us, who in the sixth book explains in a de-tailed and truthful manner the antiquity of the cities and peoples in all of Sicily. And since to know these antiquities the remains of old buildings, the inscrip-tions cut into marble, gold, bronze, and silver are extremely useful, he must take these into account. And once again Th ucydides (is there perchance need to seek out any other authority than that of such an illustrious historian?) establishes [probat], on the basis of an inscription cut into a marble in the Acropolis as a warning to posterity, something that many had forgotten: Hippias the Athenian was a tyrant, and had fathered fi ve sons.With a sure eye Robortello had selected a page in Th ucydides (6: 54– 55) which made his case: an argument which transformed a fragment of an inscription into evidence. He had accepted an invitation to broaden the framework of the research. Since history is a component of rhetoric, it has to embrace everything that rhetoric encompasses: po liti cal systems, the elec-tion of magistrates, the operation of courts, the military art. History must describe “rivers, lakes, swamps, mountains, plains, the sites of cities”— an"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"16 . description and citationallusion to Lucian, who is specifi cally mentioned at the end of the piece: “Th e best author of history must possess two things principally: po liti cal intelli-gence and expressive ability.” Th ese were not abstract admonitions on Robortello’s part. (During his activity as antiquarian and philologist he emended a series of passages in Livy on the basis of inscriptions— a chapter in his long, corrosive controversy with Carlo Sigonio.) Instead, he quietly dropped the grandiose project, outlined in the Disputatio, to combine po liti cal history and antiquarianism.9. Robortello’s writings teemed with ideas and contradictions. He defended history from the accusation made by Sextus Empiricus that it lacked method because of its relationship to rhetoric: but what Robortello meant by the term rhetoric was not clear. Earlier he had identifi ed it with fi ctional speeches in Th ucydides, later with the interpretation— it, too, using Th ucydides as an example— of nonliterary evidence from an antiquarian perspective. Th ese two meanings for rhetoric were not necessarily incompatible: in Aristotle’s Rhetoric evidence had great importance. But Robortello seemed to hesitate on this point. After having rejected annals, following Cicero, for their stylis-tic crudeness, Robortello resurrected them under the table as the chrono-logical framework for antiquarian history which had its origins in the distant past. Th is rehabilitation of annals, cautiously proposed, found an unforeseen opportunity for development in the Paduan environment, already the scene of the Robortello– Sigonio controversy.According to a traditional defi nition, annals were a sort of intermediate genre between history and antiquarianism. Th e grammarian Verrius Flac-cus, quoted by Aulus Gellius (Noctes Atticae, 5: 18), affi rmed: “Some think that history diff ers from annals in this par tic u lar, that while each is a narra-tive of events, yet history is properly an account of events in which the narra-tor took part.”  Th is distinction (about which Flaccus actually nurtured some doubts) was resurrected some centuries later in the great encyclopedic work by Isidore of Seville (Etymologiae, 1, 44): “Th e diff erence between history and an-nals resides in the fact that history concerns periods which we have been able to see, while annals deal with years which our age has not known.”  Naturally history was considered a much more complex genre than annals. As Gellius wrote, resting on the authority of Sempronius Asellio, history revealed not only what had taken place but also with what intention and for what reason [quo consilio quaque ratione] it had taken place."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"description and citation . 17Th ese defi nitions must be kept in mind when weighing the controversial implications of the thesis advanced by Sperone Speroni (1500– 1588) in his unfi nished Dialogo della Istoria, a writing on which he was hard at work up to the time of his death. Th e dialogue, in two parts, consists of a discussion, which is imagined to have taken place in Rome among the scholar Paolo Manuzio, son of the famous Venetian printer Aldus; Silvio Antoniano, secre-tary of the College of Cardinals from 1568; and the Paduan phi los o pher Girolamo Zabarella. In the fi rst part Zabarella describes an unpublished “booklet” by Pietro Pomponazzi on history. (No copies of it are known today.) It was not “a complete and separate work, as are others published by the same author, but rather a commentary.”  Pomponazzi had given the “booklet” to be copied to one of his students, who at the time was twenty- one or twenty- two years old. Th e latter, still living in Padua, “now more than eighty- six years of age,” had given his own copy to Zabarella. Th e student, naturally, was Sper-oni himself, and Pomponazzi’s “booklet” would have been written in 1520 or 1521.Th e thesis of Peretto, as Pomponazzi was familiarly called, was simple. Repudiating the contemptuous view that went back to Cicero, Peretto ar-gued that annals, although crude stylistically, were of greater value than his-tory, being the very foundation of it. In the penultimate draft of part 1 of the Dialogo della Istoria, Speroni gave ample attention, using Zabarella’s own words, to his old teacher’s reasoning. Although “annals can be found in the world only in pieces, like the statues of citizens, and the arches and temples of the city,” Zabarella observed, “[i]f you know them well and reason about them so as to be able to teach them, it would appear as if nothing has been lost.” Th e tales narrated in annals “are in the judgment of my booklet the most faithful, and most useful and most honored . . . that the human hand can record. I say the hand, and not industriousness, or intelligence, to indi-cate how simple and pure and clear and open their facts are, that it is almost as if fi rst they were written, before being uttered or thought about.”Simple, pure, clear, open: through Zabarella, his spokesman, Speroni ex-pressed unqualifi ed hostility toward rhetoric and its fl ourishes. In another writing, the Dialogo secondo Virgilio, Speroni attributed similar dissatisfac-tion to the Aristotelian phi los o pher Pietro Trapolino (Trapolin). After say-ing that “the Aeneid by its very nature is history, but has much that is poetry about it,” Trapolin further clarifi ed that “the De cades of Livy are certainly history in spite of the many orations they contain to puff them up, which"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"18 . description and citationsmack too much of rhetoric and its causes.” In this dig against the city’s glory by the Paduan Speroni, using the words of his fellow citizen Trapolino, teacher and later colleague of Pomponazzi, the thesis of the superiority of annals expounded in the latter’s “booklet” is once again visible.But other passages in Speroni reveal a more conciliatory attitude. In the Dialogo della Istoria, Silvio Antoniano intervenes in the discussion on the correctness of including fi ctitious speech in a work of history, and proposes a compromise solution. We need to allow the good historian “for the plea sure of the reader, to embellish the truth, just as in the construction of palaces the marble is decorated with carvings and the interiors with paintings; and these two exertions are not the work of the builder, but of the paint er and the sculptor.” Fictitious speech in the mouths of the leaders of armies or of con-spiracies is acceptable as ornamentation, but on one condition: that it be indi-cated as direct discourse. If, instead, the historian “off ers it in his own name with a roundabout narration, it makes it seem that he is affi rming as some-thing he experienced, as if it were part of history, what he does not know, not having been present, and those who had been present having had something else to do other than string together words, in order to attribute them to the writer.”When Speroni was comparing the speeches of historians to the paintings which adorned palaces, he may have been thinking of the frescoes executed twenty years earlier by Paolo Veronese for the Villa Barbaro built at Maser by Andrea Palladio. Gazing upon the images created by Veronese, which for an instant deceive the spectator’s eye with their splendid, subtle clarity, Speroni might have evoked the enargeia, the vividness of ancient rhetoric (fi gure 1). But where historical works were concerned, Speroni’s patience with ornamentation had defi nite limits. A lasting deception, an indirect speech passed off as authentic, would have violated the responsibility of the historian toward truth.Th ese rigid views corresponded to some broached by Pomponazzi in his memorable discussion with the Greek humanist Janus Lascaris, which we can read in another of Speroni’s writings, Dialogo delle lingue. Th is was noted by Paolo Manuzio, one of the interlocutors in the Dialogo della Istoria: “Peretto was very fond . . . of the truth simply presented, without concern for the latinity of the language: and therefore he always read the text of his Aristotle in ancient translations, paying little notice to the elegant versions of the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"description and citation . 19teachers of the two languages, who imitated Cicero; and thus this may be how his apparent aff ection for annals came about. . . .”And, turning to Zabarella, he concluded: “Subtly you compare the truth of the annals to the premises of syllogism and to the principles of the sci-ences, and to the truth of par tic u lar histories, which are dependent on an-nals, to syllogistic conclusions. . . .”Th e provocative originality of the glorifi cation of annals as the kernel of historiography was grasped by Alvise Mocenigo, Speroni’s intimate friend who was copying the penultimate version of the Dialogo della Istoria. “I am figure 1. Paolo Veronese, frescoes of Villa Barbaro: child opening door."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20 . description and citationfully aware,” Mocenigo commented, “that the history which serves all func-tions is none other than the annal; that the others are for the glory of their writers for the use of their readers; and without them we would proceed quite blindly in our deliberations, because through them, as in other things, the best principle comes from experience, which is founded on the annal, which trea-sures its memory, and serves as guide for the consideration of the future.” In an ambience which had experienced Robortello’s teaching and writings, Pomponazzi’s ideas on history were accepted with less diffi culty. Only the discovery of the lost “booklet” would permit us to reintroduce those ideas in their original context. But why did Speroni resurrect them almost seventy years later?Th e answer probably lies in the presence among the interlocutors of the Dialogo della Istoria of Silvio Antoniano, from 1568 secretary of the College of Cardinals and vice- rector of the University of Rome, “La Sapienza.” In the moment when the aged Speroni was proclaiming, through Pomponazzi’s “ book-let,” the superiority of annals over histories, Antoniano was receiving from Caesar Baronius the text of the fi rst volume of the just- completed Annales Ec-clesiastici so that he could give his approval before its publication (1588). It could not have been by chance. Speroni was rehabilitating the themes and the terms of the old battle fought by Pomponazzi for the truth of things against verbal embellishment, and he was restating them in a completely diff erent con-text, putting them in the ser vice of the Ecclesiastical Annals, that great and learned anti- Protestant undertaking, conceived in the circles of the Oratory of San Filippo Neri, with which both Baronius and Antoniano were in close contact.10. Annals and history, as we have seen, were traditionally looked upon as very diff erent literary genres. Th e former, oriented toward the reconstruction of remote events, were considered more closely related to erudition than to rhetoric. Initially, Baronius had conceived writing a Historia ecclesiastica controversa: a title that presumably presupposed a very diff erent type of work than what was eventually produced. Th e decision to orient himself toward the annal was certainly dictated by the desire to counter with facts the Protestant his-toriography of the Centuriators of Magdeburg. But this choice was then justi-fi ed on religious, not just controversialist, grounds. In the general introduc-tion to the fi rst tome of the Annales Ecclesiastici, published in 1588, Baronius declared that he had wanted to avoid the pagan custom (actually not just pagan)"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"description and citation . 21of introducing long fi ctional passages, intertwined with rhetorical fl ourishes. Rather, he had preferred to obey Christ’s injunction: “Let what you say be simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’; anything more than this comes from evil” (Matt. 5:37).Tension between religion and rhetoric, and attempts to bridge it, have oc-curred frequently in Christian history. Th ink, for example, of the famous letter in which St. Jerome tells of having dreamed of Jesus in the guise of a judge condemning him to be fl ogged, reproaching him for being more Ciceronian than Christian. In the case of Baronius, the exclusion of fi ctional speech, imposed by the genre of annals, was in accord with antirhetorical views based on lean, unadorned discourse inspired (or at least looked upon with favor) by St. Philip Neri, the found er of the Congregation of the Oratory. Th e search for truth, to Baronius, seemed incompatible with polished and stylisti-cally homogeneous speech. He used to say that he avoided commentaries as much as possible, relying on the words he found in the sources themselves, even if rough and inelegant, “quamvis horridula et incomposita.”  Th e brusque stylistic dissonance created by the insertion of terms taken from documents dating to late antiquity or the Middle Ages was emphasized typographically by the notes. What he had written, Baronius declared, was based not on the chatter of the ignorant (indoctas fabulas), but on the most reliable witnesses, easily recognizable in the margins of his pages, without having to look up a long list of authors.11. Th e marginal notes, referenced in the text of the Annales Ecclesiastici by a lowercase letter, indicate the beginning of the citation, introduced by verbs such as inquit, ait, tradit, dicit, scribit, and so forth. Th e end of the citation is gen-erally marked by a square parenthesis (]). Th e use of typographical marks in the left- hand margin of the page (“) to indicate quotations had been in use for more than half a century. Th e employment of marginal notes is sup-posed to have come later.Citations, as well as notes and the linguistic- typographical marks that ac-company them, can be considered as equivalents of enargeia since they are procedures intended to communicate an eff ect of authenticity. Naturally, these were conventional signs: for Sperone Speroni, we recall, direct discourse (pre-sumably preceded by quotation marks) announced fi ctional speech. But the similarity of the functions highlights the diff erence among the tools. Enargeia was connected to a culture based on oral communication and hand gestures; the marginal citations, the cross- references to the text, and the bracketed"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22 . description and citationparentheses, to a culture dominated by printing. Enargeia attempted to com-municate the illusion of the proximity of the past; the citations emphasized that the past is approachable only in an indirect, mediated manner.12. In 1636 a treatise entitled Dell’arte historica appeared in Rome. Its author, the Jesuit Agostino Mascardi, argued, against Speroni, that the search for causes pertained to phi los o phers, not historians. Mascardi’s approach was primarily rhetorical and stylistic. Astutely he analyzed the stylistic pro cesses that had been used by both ancient and modern historians, among which was enargeia, which he italianized as enargia, and distinct from energeia, thereby disagreeing with Julius Caesar Scaliger. Th is attention to the lan-guage of historians was accompanied by a lack of interest in the sources, with a notable exception. Mascardi noted that ancient Greece was without “the archives which right up to today we fi nd among us and that in every nation are considered venerable and sacrosanct for preserving writings, especially public documents.” But historians should not deceive themselves, even where archives exist: “Princes conduct . . . their aff airs with such great secrecy that to pene-trate their inner workings is of greater diffi culty than even to decipher the rid-dle of the Sphinx.” In some rather lively writing, Mascardi, author of a work on the conspiracy of Gianluigi Fieschi, observed that the doings of sovereigns leave either no trace or distorted and misleading ones in the reports of their ambassadors. For Mascardi history was essentially po liti cal history. He ut-ters nary a word about Baronius’s Annales Ecclesiastici, a Eu ro pe an best seller which had become the target of ferocious attacks. About antiquarian research, Mascardi spoke with obvious complacency in a passage that alluded, without naming it, to the Museo cartaceo of Cassiano dal Pozzo: “Th e relics of the arches of Constantine and Septimius in Rome, the last relics of the voracity of time and the pride of the barbarians, the two columns of Trajan and Antoni-nus, entirely fi gured in bas- relief, contain rec ords that are so beautiful, that antiquarians have copied many things from them, to enrich their very learned books: many military costumes, many weapons of war, many adornments of triumphs, and much else have been taken from these books of marble and transferred to paper books to teach us all. But I have not proposed memorials of this kind as subjects for the art of history which I am writing.”13. Th at which Mascardi’s “art of history” had ignored exacted its revenge. Th anks especially to ecclesiastical history and to antiquarianism, “evidence”"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"description and citation . 23won out over enargeia (evidentia in narratione). Even if they are not at all in-compatible, no historian today can imagine using the latter as a surrogate for the former.But a subtle devaluation of historiography as a consequence of antiquarian-ism had begun earlier, as demonstrated by a celebrated writing of Manuel Chrysoloras, the learned Greek who moved to Italy c. 1395. In 1411, after having traveled to Rome, he wrote a long letter to Manuel Paleologus, the Byzantine emperor, in which he contrasted Rome, fi rst pagan and then Christian, with the new Rome, Constantinople. Of ancient Rome, Chrysoloras described the majestic ruins, including “the trophies and arches, built to recall the triumphs with their solemn pro cessions, sculpted with the very images of war, of the prisoners, of the booty, of the sieges.”Th is was followed by an ekphrasis focusing especially on the Arch of Constantine:And it is still possible to see in them the sacrifi cial victims, the altars, the votive gifts, the naval battles, the clashes between infantry and cavalry and we can say every type of battle, of war machines and arms, and the vanquished rulers whether Medes or Persians, Iberians or Celts or Assyrians, all in their proper vestments, the enslaved populace, the generals who celebrate their triumphs over them. . . . And it is possible to know all this from how they are represented, as if they dealt with a living reality, so that every single detail becomes perfectly com-prehensible thanks to the inscriptions that are engraved there, to the point that we can see clearly what arms and what vestments were in use in ancient times, what distinctive signs identifi ed the offi ces, how their formations were drawn up, the battles. . . . Assemblies, spectacles, celebrations, occupations were represented “ac-cording to the usages of the various peoples.” “For having represented them,” Chrysoloras concluded:it is thought that Herodotus and other writers of history have done us a great ser vice when they describe these things. But in these works it is possible to see everything, just as if we were really living in those times and among those people, so that they form a history that defi nes everything simply. In fact, it is not a his-torical work [historian] but I would prefer to say almost the direct vision [autop-sian] and manifestation [parousian] of everything that existed anywhere at that time.From the written word to the immediate evocation which brings forth life itself: the sequence ekphrasis– autopsia–parousia underlined the enargeia of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"24 . description and citationChrysoloras’s epistle. Much more unusual was the juxtaposition between Herodotus and the statuary of the Arch of Constantine, followed by the rec-ognition of the superiority of the latter over the former. Th e ekphrasis, so frequently used as a tool in the ser vice of historiography, in the present case affi rmed what historians had ignored or treated inadequately. But in Chrys-oloras’s letter the evocation that almost brought the past into the present was followed by the recognition of the inescapable transience of pagan authority. Conquerors and vanquished experienced the same fate; “everything is reduced to dust.”Th e subject was not new; what was new was the distrust in the possibility of being able, with the help of rhetoric, to evoke the past as an accomplished fact. Its place was taken by an awareness that our understanding of the past inevitably was uncertain, discontinuous, lacunar, based only on fragments and ruins."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"251. Th is is an experiment in corpore nobilissimo. Peter Brown’s Th e Cult of the Saints is a splendid book, full of learning, imagination, and grace. Even the perplexities I am about to express will reveal my profound intellectual debt to this work.At the end of chapter 5 (“Praesentia”) Brown illustrates the “ideal ‘clean’ power associated with the relics of the saints” with an episode which fol-lowed the arrival of the relics of St. Stephen in Minorca in 417. Th e peaceful coexistence of Jews and Christians in the town of Mahon came brusquely to an end. Tensions emerged; the Jews gathered up stones and clubs and barri-caded themselves in the synagogue. After a number of clashes, the Christians razed the synagogue to the ground. Th en they urged the Jews to convert. Th eir eff orts were largely successful, although Th eodore, the defensor civitatis, who was the most prominent member of the Jewish community, for some time stubbornly opposed the joint pressure exerted on him by Christians and con-verted Jews. In a public debate on religious matters he almost prevailed over the bishop himself. Finally, Th eodore gave up. Th en the last Jewish re sis tance, which had included a number of women, collapsed. “Th rough becoming Christians,” Brown writes, “[the Jews] maintained their full social status within their own community, though now subject to the higher patrocinium of Saint Stephen, and seated beside the Christian bishop as Christian patroni. Th us, far from being eradicated, the ‘unclean’ power of the established Jewish families has been ‘washed clean’ by being integrated into the Christian com-munity under Saint Stephen.”CHAPTER 2Th e Conversion of the Jews of Minorca (a.d. 417– 418)"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26 . the conversion of the jews of minorcaBrown does not deny that “violence and fear of yet greater violence played a decisive role” in these events. But his fi nal comments emphasize the inte-gration of Jews and Christians in a single community, not the human cost paid for it. He prepares for this conclusion by the use of negative analogies such as “it was something marginally more decent than a mere pogrom,” or “his [i.e., Stephen’s] arrival on the island was not seen as an occasion to purge the island of Jews.” Deliberate anachronisms such as pogrom and “purge” do not seem particularly illuminating in a case like this, which is among the earliest known occurrences of Jewish- Christian tensions. Even more perplex-ing is the opposition between “clean” and “unclean” power, which plays a cru-cial role in Brown’s pre sen ta tion of the Minorcan events. “Th e reader must bear with me,” Brown says, “if, in describing a thoroughly dirty business . . . I limit myself to the perspective of Bishop Severus, our only source, and speak of the patrocinium of Saint Stephen as ‘clean’ power.” Th e problem of method raised here is obviously of great import. But this slightly ambiguous passage could be wrongly interpreted by some readers to mean that such categories as “clean” and “unclean” derive from the evidence itself. On the contrary, they are “etic,” not “emic” categories— to employ the terminology of the linguist K. L. Pike, and inspired implicitly by Mary Douglas’s Purity and Danger, and not by Severus’s long letter about the Minorcan events. Th is is a perfectly legitimate choice, of course, although somebody could object to the idea of lumping to-gether pagans and Jews under the category of “unclean” power, in light of the much later hostile association between Jews and fi lth.Th ese remarks on Brown’s historical approach to the Minorcan events are bound to remain inconclusive if they are not supplemented by an analysis of the primary evidence on which Brown relies: the letter written by Severus, bishop of Minorca, in 418. Th is statement is not as obvious as it should be. “History of historiography without historiography,” as Arnaldo Momigliano put it ironically, has become more and more fashionable in recent times. Th at there was a radical disjunction between historical narratives and the research on which it relies had already been suggested by Benedetto Croce as early as 1895. Roughly a century later, in a largely diff erent intellectual climate, this approach to historiography has become pop u lar for reasons I will not try to explain here.Its limitations (not to mention dangers) are immediately obvious, as in the case with which I am dealing, based on a single piece of evidence. Doubts about the authenticity of Severus’s letter have been raised in the past, as"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the conversion of the jews of minorca . 27 Gabriel Seguí Vidal has shown in his critical edition of 1937. More recently, on several occasions, Bernhard Blumenkranz has authoritatively argued that the letter is a seventh- century forgery (even if the announced detailed demonstra-tion has not as yet appeared). Brown mentions neither Seguí Vidal’s edition nor Blumenkranz’s criticism. He quotes the letter of Severus from one of the two nearly identical texts reproduced in Migne’s Patrologia Latina. Both are based, with a few minor corrections, on the editio princeps provided by Caesar Baronius in his Annales ecclesiastici (1588). To evaluate Brown’s approach to the Minorcan events, an examination of Severus’s letter seems unavoidable.I should say straight off that Brown was absolutely correct in his tacit ac-cep tance of the letter’s authenticity. Recently discovered evidence has proved this beyond any reasonable doubt. But a quick recapitulation of the discus-sions concerning the authenticity of the document will I hope shed addi-tional light on the events it purports to describe.2. In his edition of Severus’s letter Seguí Vidal observed that the style of the document was perfectly compatible with an early fi fth- century date. Nearly twenty years later, in an essay written with J. N. Hillgarth, Seguí Vidal intro-duced two additional arguments: (a) the identifi cation of a pseudo- Augustinian treatise, Altercatio Ecclesiae contra Synagogam, with the commonitorium men-tioned by Severus in his letter; (b) some archeological excavations suggesting the existence of a large paleo- Christian basilica in Minorca. Th e irrelevance of the second argument in a discussion concerning the date of Severus’s letter— which in any case is probably earlier than the basilica— has been rightly emphasized by José Vives (who, on the other hand, accepted the iden-tifi cation of the commonitorium with the Altercatio). Th e fi rst argument was eff ectively rejected by Blumenkranz, who demonstrated that the Altercatio is a later (probably tenth- century) text. Moreover, he claimed that the letter ascribed to Severus (or Pseudo- Severus, as he says) refl ects the preoccupa-tions of a later period: the fact that Bishop Severus was nearly vanquished by Th eodore, for instance, would suggest the risks involved in public religious confrontations with the Jews. Blumenkranz added to this a rather vague lin-guistic argument: the words “Th eodorus in Christum credidit,” shouted by the Christians and misunderstood by the Jews as “Th eodore crede in Chris-tum,” seems to imply a homophony between the Spanish “cree” (imperative) and “cree” (indicative) which would be incompatible with an early fi fth- century date."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28 . the conversion of the jews of minorcaFifth or seventh century? Lellia Cracco Ruggini rightly rejected Blumen-kranz’s late date, but she gave a disproportionate importance to a more than doubtful argument— the archeological evidence mentioned by Seguí and Hill-garth. On the other hand, the unfounded skepticism of Díaz y Díaz about an early date contained some valuable suggestions. He noted that all the manuscripts (nine) used by Seguí Vidal for his critical edition include, be-sides the Severus letter, the so- called Liber de miraculis sancti Stephani pro-tomartyris, which describes the miracles produced by the relics of St. Stephen in an African town, Uzalis. Both texts begin with the same biblical quota-tion (Tob. 2:7); the second cites the fi rst, affi rming (Patrologia Latina 41:83) that the saint’s relics were brought to Uzalis with a letter, written by Bishop Severus of Minorca, which was to be read aloud from the pulpit: it proclaimed the extraordinary feats already performed by these relics in converting the Jews of Minorca. Díaz y Díaz suggests two alternative possibilities: (a) that the allusion to the letter of Severus in the Liber de miraculis, which is the only external proof of the early date of the letter, is an interpolation; (b) that the letter itself is a fake constructed on the basis of the allusion in the Liber.Th ese clever conjectures have been disproved by J. Divjak ’s discovery of letters to and from Augustine. Th ey include two written from the Balearic Is-lands by Consentius (known in de pen dently to be a correspondent of Augus-tine). In one of them (12*) Consentius mentions the letter of Severus on the conversion of the Jews, even claiming that he had some responsibility in its wording. It has been remarked, however, that the plain, straightforward style of Severus is very diff erent from that of Consentius.3. So much for the date and authenticity of Severus’s letter. All remaining doubts concerning these two issues stem, in my opinion, from a hypercritical attitude. Other problems, however, are far from settled. Two recent essays insist on analyzing the letter as an autonomous document, related to a more or less isolated event. Th is approach is certainly not without merit, but I will try to suggest the possibilities off ered by a diff erent method, based on more extensive documentation, encompassing a longer time frame— an approach implying the construction (and reconstruction) of a diff erent historical object.Th e connections between the letter of Severus and the Liber de Miraculis Sancti Stephani have already been pointed out by Díaz y Díaz. Both texts are related to the same person: Paulus Orosius, the author of the Historiarum Adversus Paganos libri VII, the fi rst universal history written from a Christian"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the conversion of the jews of minorca . 29perspective. Elements in Orosius’s life explain his involvement with the two texts. Having left his birthplace, Braga, formerly a Spanish and then a Portu-guese town, Orosius had come to Africa to meet Augustine and become his pupil. Augustine trusted him to the point that he sent him to Jerusalem (415) to challenge Pelagius and his ideas. Orosius took part in the Council of Dio-spolis, which turned out to be a success for Pelagius. During the synod the relics of St. Stephen, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus were found at Caphar- Gamala, near Jerusalem, by a priest named Lucianus, who had been led there by a series of nocturnal visions. He was asked by Avitus, a priest from Braga, to dictate to him the circumstances of his extraordinary discovery. Lucianus spoke Greek, a language with which Avitus was familiar. Having prepared a Latin translation of Lucianus’s report, known to us as De revelatione corporis sancti Stephani, Avitus entrusted it, with some relics of St. Stephen, to his fellow citizen Orosius, who was supposed to bring them to Palchonius, bishop of Braga. In 416 Orosius left Jerusalem with his precious objects and, after a halt in Africa, proceeded to Minorca, hoping to reach Spain. Events turned out diff erently. In his letter, written at the beginning of 418, Severus speaks of a priest coming from Jerusalem who, unable to get to Spain, altered course and returned to Africa, leaving behind in Minorca, “by divine inspiration,” fragments of St. Stephen’s body. For quite some time this anonymous priest has long been identifi ed with Orosius. What convinced him to give up his or ig i-nal quest— whether winter storms, Vandal ships, or both— we do not know. In any case, I think we can trust the passage from the Liber de miraculis sancti Stephani mentioning Severus’s letter. Th e unnamed individual who brought it to Uzalis, along with additional fragments from that apparently inex-haustible treasure— the relics of St. Stephen— can be safely identifi ed with Orosius. His Historiae adversus paganos, probably written in the same year (418), shows that, as did his teacher Augustine, Orosius rejected the apocalyptic view in which Severus, at the end of the letter, placed the conversion of Minorca’s Jews.4. Orosius could be regarded mistakenly as the protagonist in this story. In fact, he played only the role of intermediary, although admittedly an impor-tant one. Th e principal fi gure is Stephen. Th e arrival of his relics in Africa triggered a series of miracles, duly recorded some years later in the Liber de Miraculis Sancti Stephani Protomartyris, written under the impulse of Evodius, bishop of Uzalis. Since his youth Evodius had been one of Augustine’s closest"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30 . the conversion of the jews of minorcafollowers. In the past Augustine had been openly skeptical toward mira-cles. Th e discovery in Milan in 386 of the relics of two unknown martyrs, Gervasius and Protasius, which were immediately exploited by Ambrose as a symbolic weapon in his struggle with Arians, had left Augustine unmoved. In his treatise De vera religione (389– 391), the latter explained that, after the spread of the Christian faith, miracles had become impossible: otherwise, people would have craved only for visible things. Th e title of book 22, chapter 8, of the City of God, written in 425, reads like a retraction of the aforemen-tioned passage, as well as a turning point in the history of the cult of saints: “De miraculis, quae ut mundus in Christum crederet facta sunt et fi eri mundo credente non desinunt” (“On miracles, which were done that the world might believe in Christ, and are still performed even though the world believes in Him”). Th e cult of the martyrs’ relics was widespread in Africa: the Council of Carthage (398) had tried to exert some control over it, ordering the destruction of all superstitious or illicit altars. But the change in Augustine’s attitude was specifi cally related, as Victor Saxer has shown, to the wave of miracles con-nected to the shrine of St. Stephen in Uzalis. Why was St. Stephen so im-portant? He had been, of course, the protomartyr; his passion had refl ected the passion of Christ. Other elements will become immediately evident as we focus on the momentous discovery of his relics. Let us now go back to 415.5. Th e discovery of the relics of St. Stephen occurred at the right time and in the right place— a notion expressed by Victor Saxer, an eminent scholar whom nobody will suspect of militant anticlerica lism. Th e event enhanced the prestige of a person who clearly had played a major role in it: John II, bishop of Jerusalem. In a recent essay Michael van Esbroeck has argued that some cults actively supported by John II— St. Stephen’s being the most prominent— implied a coherent religious policy, consciously addressed toward Jewish- Christian groups. Th is is a valuable suggestion: but the polemical, even ag-gressive implications of the event were disregarded by van Esbroeck. Th e discovery of the tombs of Gamaliel and Nicodemus, suggesting a continuity between Old and New Testaments, was more than counterbalanced by the discovery of the relics of St. Stephen, the protomartyr, the fi rst man who “fought for the Lord against the Jews” (primum adversus Judaeos dominica bella bellavit). Th ese words, included in both versions of the De revelatione corporis Sancti Stephani, are eloquent enough. Religious contiguity went hand in hand with religious competition. As Marcel Simon has shown in his important"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the conversion of the jews of minorca . 31book, the Christians’ claim to being “the true Israel” had ambivalent, poten-tially tragic overtones.Th ese tensions lurk behind the discovery of St. Stephen’s relics. Even scholars who have emphasized the perfect timing of this event have, as far as I know, disregarded the following matter: on 20 October 415 the emperor deprived Gamaliel II, patriarch of Jerusalem, of his traditional title of praefec-tus honorarius. Signifi cantly, Jewish proselytism, in the form of the construc-tion of new synagogues and the circumcision of Christians and Gentiles, was the reason mentioned for the suppression of this dignity. Th e patriarch was the highest spiritual and po liti cal authority for the Jews of Palestine and the Diaspora; Origen regarded him as a kind of monarch of the Jews.Th e suppression of the praefectura honoraria led, a few years later, to the disappearance of the patriarchate. Th e weakened position of the Jews under Christian emperors was made evident, less than two months later, by another symbolic blow: the sudden reemergence of the relics of St. Stephen, announced by the visions of Lucianus at the beginning of December 415.6. Retrospectively, it seems obvious that the relics were bound to reappear sooner or later. To explain this, we need to take another step backward— to the well- known sermons against Judaizing Christians delivered by St. John Chrysostom in Antioch in 385– 386. Marcel Simon in a major essay has ex-amined the underlying complex religious reality. Both Jews and Christians, for instance, fervently worshipped the relics of the seven Maccabees and their mother, which were thought to be preserved in a synagogue in Antioch. Around 380 this edifi ce was seized and transformed into a Christian church. Th is act, which was far from being exceptional, demonstrates the ambivalent implications of the formula verus Israel. Th e desire to emphasize the continuity between Old and New Testaments inspired the inclusion of the Maccabees in Antioch’s religious calendar, as well as the violent seizure of the holy place where their relics were preserved.Th e cult of the Maccabee brothers and their mother was not limited to Antioch. In 388, as we learn from a letter of St. Ambrose, at Callinicon, on the left bank of the Euphrates, heretics attacked some monks who, “ following an ancient tradition,” were chanting psalms as they made their way to a sanctu-ary of the Maccabees. For some unknown reason, even in this case the local synagogue was destroyed by these monks, encouraged to do so by the bishop (a u c t o r e e p i s c o p o). Such a widespread cult, shared by Jews and Christians,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"32 . the conversion of the jews of minorcaundoubtedly had deep roots. Th e pre ce dent of 2 Macc. 7 has been detected behind the description of Blandina, the Christian martyr put to death at Lyon in a.d. 177. It has been suggested that the very notion of martyrium ultimately derives from the story of the seven Jewish brothers and their mother, tortured and killed for their refusal to eat pork.We have already mentioned the attempts to Christianize the cult of these Jewish protomartyrs. Th e new balance of power, which had emerged between the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fi fth centuries, led to the dis-covery of the relics of the Christian protomartyr, who according to the tradi-tion had been killed by the Jews. Th e veneration of Stephen was thus raised up against the veneration of the Maccabees. In Minorca, as Severus stated in his letter, the tensions generated by the arrival of the relics of St. Stephen unleashed actual hostilities: “the Jews exhorted one another by recalling the examples of the age of the Maccabees, ready to die in order to defend the Law.” 7. Up to this point I have dealt with a hagiographic ste reo type, tied to a name: “Stephen.” It might be possible to go beyond this and try to disentan-gle, on the basis of Acts 6– 8, the historical Stephen and his attitude toward Jewish tradition. Although I lack the competence to do this, the evidence I have collected shows, in my opinion, that a highly ambivalent attitude toward Jews played a crucial role in the emergence of the cult of the Christian saints. Th e religious violence occurring on Minorca is just one episode in a much longer story in which St. Stephen, or at least his relics, inevitably performed an anti- Jewish function.Th e role played by St. Stephen is so obvious that Peter Brown, in his work from which this discussion began, did not even mention it. Th is silence seems signifi cant because it is connected to a larger tendency on his part to under-play tensions, divisions, opposition of all kinds— social, cultural, and religious. In an autobiographical fragment Brown remarked (with a touch of self- criticism) that British functionalist anthropology has had “a tendency to isolate the holy man . . . from the world of shared values in which he operated as an exem-plar.” Brown preferred, instead, to focus on elements shared by an entire community. I agree totally with the objections, raised in the fi rst chapter of Th e Cult of Saints, to the more or less openly paternalistic spirit with which the religious history of illiterate groups has been studied. Much more debatable is"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"the conversion of the jews of minorca . 33Brown’s tacit progression from this type of criticism to a rejection of what he defi nes as a “two- tier model”— in other words, any approach that pre-supposes the existence of cultural and religious dichotomies.Th e Cult of the Saints is an indispensable book. But it is diffi cult to accept how it deals (or fails to deal) with the Jewish- Christian dichotomy."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"341. Th ere are fi gures from the past that time seems to bring closer and closer to us. Montaigne is one such fi gure. We are irresistibly attracted by his open-ness toward distant cultures, by his curiosity about the multiplicity and diver-sity of human life, by the conspiratorial and pitiless dialogue he carries on with himself. Th ese apparently contradictory traits make him seem familiar, but it is a deceptive impression: in the end, Montaigne eludes us. We must try to approach him on his own terms, not ours.Th is does not mean interpreting Montaigne through Montaigne himself— a highly questionable, and ultimately fruitless, approach. Let’s follow a dif-ferent track by attempting to read the essay “On Cannibals,” starting with the contextual elements that can be found, directly or indirectly, in the text itself. Th is will be an erratic path which at times will appear to be echoing the digressions so dear to Montaigne. I want to try to show how these con-texts served to mold the text: as both constraints and challenges.2. Th e fi rst context, both literal and meta phorical, is provided, of course, by the Essais, the volume in which “On Cannibals” is included. A relationship between parts and the whole exists for all of Montaigne’s essays (and for all his books): but in this case there is a special signifi cance. Th is is understood at once from the words in which the author presents his work to the reader. “Had my intention been to court the world’s favor,” Montaigne writes, “I should have trimmed myself more bravely, and stood before it in a studied at-titude. I desire to be seen in my simple, natural, and everyday dress, without CHAPTER 3Montaigne, Cannibals, and Grottoes"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"montaigne, cannibals, and grottoes . 35artifi ce or constraint, for it is myself I portray.” But this decision to represent his “faults to the life” and his “native form” had to come to terms, as Montaigne explains subsequently, with his “respect for the public.” In presenting to the reader the result of such a compromise— his book— Montaigne expresses a nostalgic longing for “those nations who are said to be still living in the sweet freedom of Nature’s fi rst laws.” If he had been living among those people, he concludes, “I assure you that I should have been quite prepared to give a full- length, and quite naked, portrait of myself.”On the very threshold of the Essais we meet the Brazilian savages who will reappear in “On Cannibals.” Th eir nakedness points at two crucial, and closely related, themes: on the one hand, the opposition between coustume and nature; on the other, the author’s intention to speak of himself in the most direct, immediate, and truest way possible. Allusions to naked savages and naked truth have nothing surprising about them. But their convergence im-plies an intermediate link tied to one of Montaigne’s boldest assumptions: the identifi cation of tradition (c o u stum e) with artifi ciality. Clothing, as he explains in the essay “On the Custom of Dressing” (1:36), demonstrates that we have departed from the law of nature, from that “general polity of the world, where there can be nothing counterfeit.” Nakedness was “the original custom of mankind”— words that clarify the already noted allusion to the Golden Age’s lack of constraints: the “sweet freedom of Nature’s fi rst laws.” We fi nd an-ticipated, in a concise form, some of the crucial ideas which will be developed in the Essais.But how widespread at that time was the association between the Golden Age, nakedness, and freedom from the constraints of civilization? Here an-other possible context emerges. Th ese three motifs converge in a famous pas-sage of the Aminta, the pastoral poem by Torquato Tasso, whom Montaigne regarded as “one of the most judicious and inventive of Italian poets, who was more highly trained in the manner of pure and ancient poetry than any other that had lived for a long time.” Th e chorus which closes the fi rst act of the Aminta is a nostalgic evocation of the Golden Age and its naked nymphs: an age in which erotic plea sure was not constrained by honor, “that vaine and ydle name.”  It should be added that Pierre de Brach, councillor of the Parlement of Bordeaux and author of the fi rst translation of the Aminta into French (1584), was a friend of Montaigne’s. But the possibility that Montaigne, who knew Italian very well, echoed Tasso’s verses in his address to the reader must be absolutely rejected. Th e fi rst edition of Montaigne’s Essais (wh ic h a l re a dy"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36 . montaigne, cannibals, and grottoesincluded the address to the reader) appeared in the summer of 1580, a few months after the publication of the fi rst edition of the Aminta. In the second edition of the Essais (1582) Montaigne added a moving reference to his meet-ing with Tasso at the Sant’Anna hospital in Ferrara, where the poet was con-fi ned for insanity.Montaigne could not possibly have read the Aminta, for chronological rea-sons; Tasso could not have read the Essais for reasons both chronological and linguistic (his French was very poor). Th e analogies between the two texts must be related to a widespread motif. Th is can be proven by a page of La métamor-phose d’Ovide fi gurée, a French poetical adaptation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, published in Lyons in 1557. Th e etcher, Bernard Salomon, known as “le petit Salomon,” depicted the Golden Age as the triumph of free love and nakedness: at that time, the caption reads, people lived “sans loy, force ou contrainte/On meintenoit la foy, le droit, l’honneur” (“without law, force or constraint/faith, right, honor were preserved”) (fi gure 2).Th e tone is less aggressive, but we are not very far from either Tasso’s denun-ciation of honor or from Montaigne’s lament for the “sweet freedom of Nature’s fi rst laws.” But La métamorphose d’Ovide fi gurée suggests Montaigne to us on a diff erent level as well. Th e repre sen ta tion of the Golden Age is framed by “grotesques”— decorations which had become fashionable at the end of the fi f-teenth century, after the discovery of the frescoes which decorated the grottoes of the Domus Aurea. In an often quoted passage, Montaigne compared his own essays specifi cally to “grotesques, that is to say, fantastic paintings whose only charm lies in their variety and extravagance. And what are these essays but grotesques and monstrous bodies, pieced together of diff erent members, with-out any defi nite shape, without any order, coherence, or proportion, except they be accidental.”Th e illustrations of La métamorphose d’Ovide fi gurée contributed to the dif-fusion of this kind of decoration throughout France. A series of mid- sixteenth- century frescoes in the castle of Villeneuve- Lebrun, near the Puy- de- Dôme, was actually based on Bernard Salomon’s etchings. We do not k now whe t he r Montaigne was familiar with these illustrations; but they may provide a vi-sual parallel to, and context for, the passage we have just read.Th e comparison of his own work to the “grotesques” had a twofold signifi -cance, both negative and positive. On the one hand, Montaigne was suggest-ing what his Essais lacked: they were “without any defi nite shape, without any order, coherence, or proportion, except they be accidental.” On the other,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"figure 2.

Montaigne had a true passion for poetry. It has been supposed, on the basis of his Journal de voyage en Italie, that he was less interested in the visual arts. Certainly, we will not fi nd in the Journal comments on the Sistine ceil-ing or Leonardo’s Last Supper. But this proves only that Montaigne (who, by the way, did not record everything he saw) did not have a nineteenth- or twentieth- century guidebook in his pocket. In fact, the passages of his Journal dedicated to the villas of Pratolino, Castello, Bagnaia, and Caprarola display a defi nite interest in gardens, fountains, and grottoes. Montaigne avoided tech-nical terms in his descriptions, which should not surprise us if we recall the ironical reference in his Essais to architects preening themselves “with big words like Pilasters, Architraves, Cornices, Corinthians, Doric and such,” all of which referred to “the paltry parts of my kitchen door.”Th e art historian André Chastel wrote that this passage indicates fi rst of all that Montaigne was more conversant with such ancient authors as Seneca and Cicero than with Vitruvius. Such a conclusion seems to me far from evident. Montaigne was presumably familiar with the vivid description of the fi rst, uncivilized stage of human society contained in the De architectura of Vitruvius. Besides the original Latin text, reprinted many times, Montaigne could have known the French translation of 1547 by Jean Martin, itself based on an earlier Italian version by Cesare Cesariano (Como, 1521). In comment-ing on the passage in Vitruvius on the invention of fi re, Cesariano identifi ed the harsh beginning of human society with the Golden Age (a u r e a a e t a s) and compared those early humans to the inhabitants of the recently discov-ered lands of southern Asia, whom Spanish and Portuguese travelers had found still lived in caves (fi gure 3).In his essay on cannibals Montaigne described the Brazilian savages as being both primitive and similar to the people of the Golden Age. It is im-possible to say whether he took these ideas from the commentaries on Vitru-vius. But that is not the point.

His Journal de voyage en Italie proves just the opposite.Here is how he describes the Medici villa at Pratolino, near Florence:Th ere is . . . a grotto, consisting of several cells, which is the fi nest we ever saw. It is formed, and all crusted over, with a certain material, which they told us was brought from some par tic u lar mountain; the wood- work is all ingeniously fas-tened together with invisible nails. Here you see various musical instruments, which perform a variety of pieces, by the agency of the water; which also, by a hidden machinery, gives motion to several statues, single and in groups, opens doors, and gives apparent animation to the fi gures of various animals, that seem to jump into the water, to drink, to swim about, and so on. . . . Th e beauty and richness of this place cannot be conveyed by any description, however detailed.Th e fountain, built by the architect Bernardo Buontalenti, has been de-stroyed. We may be able to fi gure out what Montaigne saw by looking at another grotto, also built by Buontalenti and still extant in the Boboli Gar-dens in Florence.Th e construction of the facade of the grotto, begun by Giorgio Vasari, was taken over by Buontalenti in 1583— that is, two years after Montaigne’s voyage to Italy— and fi nished in 1593. Th e two Prigioni by Michelangelo (to-day replaced by copies) were installed in the grotto in 1585. Th e fashion for grottoes had started in Italy some de cades earlier. In 1543, Claudio Tolomei, in his description of the grottoes built in his Roman villa by messer Agapito Bellomo, mentioned “the ingenious artifi ce of making fountains, which has been recently discovered and now has been widely practiced in Rome. By com-bining art with nature, it has become impossible to discern which is which. Sometimes it looks like a natural artifi ce, sometimes like an artifi cial nature: in this way nowadays they have learned to make fountains which look as if they had been made by nature, not by chance but through a masterful artifi ce. . . .”Tolomei’s praise for devices characterized by “natural artifi ce” and “artifi -cial nature” immediately makes us think of Montaigne’s enthusiasm for the Pratolino grotto. Th is convergence inspired by a common taste was analyzed brilliantly many years ago by Ernst Kris. Studying the casts made from na-ture by two late- sixteenth- century sculptors— the German Werner Jamnitzer and the Frenchman Bernard Palissy— Kris demonstrated that this practice was related to a widespread form of extreme naturalism, which he labeled “style"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"montaigne, cannibals, and grottoes . 41rustique.” Among the prominent examples of this style he mentioned the Tuscan gardens and grottoes so warmly appreciated by Montaigne.More recent research has shown that this “rustic style” had been preco-ciously transmitted to France by Sebastiano Serlio, the celebrated architect and theorist. In the fourth volume of his infl uential treatise, Libro di architet-tura, published in 1537, Serlio identifi ed the Tuscan order (which had been mentioned only briefl y by Vitruvius) with the rustic order, and he cited as an example of this combination (mi stu ra) the extremely beautiful Palazzo del Te, the country residence of the Gonzaga family, not far from Mantua, con-structed a few years earlier by Giulio Romano. Serlio particularly praised Giulio Romano’s use of both rough and polished stone in the facade of the palace, making it seem “part work of nature and part artifi ce” (fi gure 4).A few years later Serlio found a new patron in Francis I and left Italy for France forever. In 1551 he published in Lyons a book almost entirely figure 4.

His physical distance from the imposing heritage of Roman architecture could have had a liberating eff ect on him. In any case, through both his buildings at Fontainebleau (most of them now de-stroyed) and his treatise on architecture Serlio contributed to the spread of a style which developed some of Giulio Romano’s boldest ideas. A work such as Bernard Palissy’s Architecture et Ordonnance de la grotte rustique de Monsei-gneur le duc de Montmorency connestable de France (1563) attests to Serlio’s dramatic impact on French architecture. In order to convey to his readers the monstrosity (m o n st r u osit é) of a grotto he had built, Palissy listed innumer-able details which associated a close combination of nature and the pursuit of bizarre eff ects: terra- cotta statues whose worn aspect simulated the eff ects of time; columns made of seashells; columns sculpted in the form of rocks eroded by the wind; or rusticated columns to make one think they had been repeatedly struck by a hammer; and so forth.Montaigne’s enthusiasm for Pratolino, Bagnaia, and Caprarola, as recorded in his Journal de voyage en Italie, was clearly related to a pervasive taste which may shed some light on both the structure and style of his Essais. It is a lead worth pursuing.4. Antoine Compagnon has suggested that Montaigne, in writing his essays, had an ancient model in mind: the Noctes Atticae (t he Attic Nights), written by the grammarian Aulus Gellius c. 150 b.c. Th e work consists of a series of ar-bitrarily arranged chapters, each of which focuses on a word, a motto, an anec-dote, or at times a general topic. Compagnon has emphasized that the structural resemblance between the two works is reinforced by a series of other analogies such as the rejection of learning, the frequent use of titles related only vaguely to the content of the essays, and the huge number of quotations from a heteroge-neous collection of books. Th e hypothesis is certainly convincing. But why was Montaigne, who repeatedly quoted from Gellius, so struck by his work? And in what vein did he read it?"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"montaigne, cannibals, and grottoes . 43An answer to these questions can be found in a passage from Gellius’s in-troduction to the Noctes Atticae. After having listed a series of elegant, some-times pretentious titles by famous scholars, he explains how he came to choose the title for his book: “But I, bearing in mind my limitations, gave my work off hand, without premeditation, and indeed almost in a rustic fashion (sub-rustice), the title Attic Nights, derived merely from the time and place of my winter vigils; I thus fall as far short of all other writers in the dignity even of my title, as I do in care and elegance of style.”Th e key word in the passage, subrustice, “almost in a rustic fashion,” obvi-ously did not imply a literal reference to peasants. Th e use of the rustic order by Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Te, the Gonzagas’ splendid country home, was equally meta phorical (fi gure 4). What was being suggested in both cases was a deliberate, highly controlled lack of stylistic refi nement. We can eas-ily imagine how Gellius’s tongue- in- cheek modesty, as well as his dismissal of rhetorical elegance in the name of a diff erent rhetoric— one based on simplicity and disorder— must have appealed to Montaigne, writing from the tower of his provincial castle. Th e capricious structure of Gellius’s chapters and the large number of heterogeneous quotations with which they are encrusted were made- to- order to seduce such a reader as Montaigne, himself inclined to vio-late the classical laws of symmetry.In a similar spirit, in the introduction to the Libro estraordinario, Serlio proudly trumpeted his own licentiousness, which had induced him to push to an extreme Giulio Romano’s experiments by inserting ancient fragments in a mixture of diff erent styles. Th ese included even a previously unheard of “bestial order” (o rd in e b e st i a l e): addressing himself “to those bizarre persons who are fond of novelties,” Serlio stated that he had wanted “to break and spoil (rompere e guastare) the beautiful shape of this Doric door” (fi gure 5). A simi-lar desire for transgression, even if less brutal, is discernible in Serlio’s praise of grotesques: they, too, favored “licentiousness,” the free play of decorative ele-ments, legitimized by examples from ancient Rome which Giovanni da Udine had not only imitated but even surpassed in the Vatican loggias.Rejection of symmetry, infl ation of details, violation of classical norms: Serlio would have approved the loose structure as well as the uneven stylistic texture of Montaigne’s essays. Th e abrupt juxtapositions may be compared to the alternate use of polished and rough stone in Giulio Romano’s Palazzo del Te, representing respectively, as Serlio remarked, “works of art” and “works of nature.” In the essay on cannibals Montaigne cites as authorities a writing"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"figure 5.

Th is man who stayed with me was a plain, simple fellow, and men of this sort are likely to give true testimony.”Readers of the fi rst edition of the Essais (Bordeaux, 1580) were confronted with a text in which each essay was printed as a single, unbroken typographi-cal unit. By splitting the sequence into two diff erent paragraphs, modern publishers have attenuated the original harsh tone, but without making it disappear entirely.5. “Une marqueterie mal jointe,” an inlay badly joined: this defi nition which Montaigne gave to his own writings (like the one previously analyzed about the grotesques) reveals, in addition to his customary teasing tone, a remark-able literary self- awareness. Montaigne was referring to the uneven stylistic texture of the Essais, an unevenness exacerbated by his compulsive habit of inserting additions (a l l o n g e a i l s) of various lengths in subsequent editions. Some years after the death of Montaigne, another famous reader, Galileo Galilei, penned a similar phrase in the margin of his interfoliated copy of the Gerusalemme Liberata. Tasso’s narrative, he observed, resembles “more inlaid wood or intarsia than an oil painting. For, since an intarsia is a composite of little varicolored pieces of wood, which one can never combine and unite so fl uidly that the contours would not remain clear cut and the colors sharply distinct in their variety, the fi gures are of necessity stiff , crude and without conformation and relief.” As an example of a narrative comparable to an oil painting, “soft, round, forceful and rich in relief,” Galileo mentioned Ario sto’s Orlando Furioso.Th e analogy between Montaigne’s rather indulgent self- representation and Galileo’s hostile judgment of Tasso seems to suggest once again the exis-tence of a larger common framework. In a famous paper, Panofsky used Gali-leo’s text to demonstrate Tasso’s connection to the Mannerist culture of a Salviati or Bronzino. Panofsky’s defi nition can be extended to Montaigne as well. I am well aware that this assertion is not new. In the last few de cades Montaigne has been repeatedly described as a typical representative of Mannerism. But the category of Mannerism, itself quite debatable, has become more and more vague.

All the elements in the structure which we have seen emerge piece by piece— Tasso, the Pratolino grotto, Serlio, the facade of the Palazzo del Te, the intarsia as a stylistic meta-phor, again Tasso— have been in de pen dently connected to Mannerism. But the tortuous course we have traveled thus far seems to me more important than our point of arrival.6. “When I begin reading the Furioso,” Galileo wrote, “I see opening up before me a regal gallery adorned with a hundred ancient statues by the most re-nowned sculptors.” Tasso’s Gerusalemme, instead, gave him the impressionof entering the study of some little man with a taste for the curious who has taken delight in fi tting it out with things that have something strange about them, ei-ther because of age or because of rarity or for some other reason, but are, as a mat-ter of fact, nothing but bric- a-brac, such as a petrifi ed crayfi sh; a dried- up chame-leon; a fl y and a spider embedded in a piece of amber; some of those little clay fi gures which are said to be found in the ancient tombs of Egypt; and, as far as painting is concerned[,] little sketches by Baccio Bandinelli and Parmigianino, and other similar trifl es.“Here Galileo,” Panofsky remarks, “portrays to a nicety, and with evident gusto, one of those jumbled Kunst- und Wunderkammern so typical of the Man-nerist age.”  In such a Wunderkammer we can easily imagine a cast of an in-sect from Palissy’s workshop, as well as “the beds . . . ropes . . . wooden swords and bracelets . . . and large canes open at one end” used by the Brazilian na-tives as musical instruments in their dances: objects collected by Montaigne, who (as we learn from his essay on cannibals) had them in his house.Aesthetic taste can act as a fi lter, with both moral and cognitive implica-tions. Montaigne’s eff ort to understand the Brazilian natives was fed by his attraction for the bizarre, the distant, the exotic, for works of art which imi-tated nature and for people close to the state of nature. In the essay on can-nibals Montaigne shed light on the moral and intellectual implications of the Wunderkammer.7.

Its author, the Franciscan André Th evet, was known especially as a cosmogra-pher. His account of the French expedition to Brazil (Les singularitez de la France antarctique, 1557) had been attacked as fallacious by the Huguenot Jean de Léry. Montaigne, in speaking of the New World, dismissed “what the cos-mographers may say,” and perhaps agreed with Léry’s attacks against Th evet. But the latter’s volume, Les vrais pourtraits, must have aroused Montaigne’s curiosity. Th evet had been working on this huge work for many years, at-tempting to create an accurate portrait for each individual, which he had then passed on to the engraver “pour graver et representer au naif l’air et le pourtrait des personnages que ie propose.”  Th e living were excluded.

Th e eighth book, on the subject of “emperors and kings,” included Julius Caesar; Ferguz, fi rst king of Scotland; Saladin; Tamerlane; Mahomet II; Tomombey, the last sultan of Egypt; Atabalipa, king of Peru; and Motzume, king of Mexico. In this colorful company we also fi nd Nacolabsou, king of the Promontory of Cannibals (fi gure 6).Th e French anthropologist Alfred Métraux, in his monograph on the Tupinamba religion, made extensive use of Th evet and praised his curiosity, the fruit of his capacity to be astonished. To be sure, Th evet is not compa-rable to Montaigne for originality and intelligence. Both, however, shared an antihierarchical attitude which permitted Th evet to include the names of the rulers mentioned above. In this version, the series enjoyed long life.

Th e taste for the exotic and the passion of the collector obviously inspired Montaigne to include, in the essay on cannibals, the translation of two Bra-zilian songs which he warmly praised. Montaigne has been seen occasion-ally as the found er of anthropology, as the fi rst who tried to avoid the ethno-centric distortions involved when we approach what has been referred to as “the Other.” But by seeing him thus we impose our words on Montaigne. Instead, we could learn from him, using his own language.Montaigne can also be considered an antiquarian, even though sui ge-neris. Th is statement is almost paradoxical, since antiquarian for more than two centuries has been synonymous with pedant: Montaigne hated pedantry. But a passage in the Journal de voyage en Italie might make us think that the label was justifi ed. During his visit to the Vatican Library, Montaigne saw a Virgil manuscript which he thought he could date, on the basis of its elon-gated narrow characters, to the age of Constantine. Lacking in the manu-script were the four autobiographical verses (“Ille ego qui quondam . . .”) which had often been printed in the Aeneid. Th is convinced Montaigne that he was justifi ed in assuming those lines to be apocryphal.Montaigne was right on this last point. His earlier hypothesis on the date was less accurate.

Half a century before, the French antiquarian Claude Bellièvre had also examined the Ve r g i l i u s R o m a n u s , noticing the elon-gated form of its letters as well as an orthographic detail (“Vergilius” instead of “Virgilius”) which had already been pointed out by Angelo Poliziano in his Miscellanea. But Montaigne had never read Poliziano’s philological writ-ings. He was not a philologist; moreover, he could not have been a paleogra-pher; paleography, in the modern sense of the word, emerged only in the late seventeenth century. But his attention to a detail such as the form of the letters in a manuscript was part of a boundless curiosity for the concrete, the specifi c, the singular. Th is was the attitude with which, as he said in his essay on educa-tion, an imaginary pupil should have been inculcated: “Let an honest curiosity be instilled in him, so that he may inquire into everything; if there is anything remarkable in his neighborhood let him go to see it, whether it is a building, figure 9.

Ethnography emerged when the antiquarian’s curiosity and method-ology were transferred from people remote in time, as were the Greeks and Romans, to people remote in space. Montaigne’s role in this crucial intellec-tual turning point remains to be explored.9. Th e gaze of the antiquarian permitted Montaigne to look at Brazilian na-tives as belonging to a distinct and diff erent civilization, although the word civilization did not exist as yet. He refused to label their poetry barbarian (“. . . a fi ction that by no means savours of barbarity”; “. . . there is nothing barbarous in this idea”). In general, Montaigne said, “I do not believe, from what I have been told about this people, that there is anything barbarous or savage about them, except that we call barbarous anything that is contrary to our own habits.” But a few pages later, this purely relative meaning of barba-rous acquired a negative connotation. Given that we, civilized people, are more cruel than cannibals, we are the true barbarians: “I consider it more barba-rous to eat a man alive than to eat him dead. . . . We are justifi ed therefore in calling these people barbarians by reference to the laws of reason, but not in comparison with ourselves, who surpass them in every kind of barbarity.”A third meaning, but a positive one this time, as applied to the word bar-barian, had prepared the way for this sudden shift in perspective. Brazilian natives could be called “barbarians” or “savages” because they were still close to nature and its laws: “Th ese people are wild in the same way as we say that fruits are wild, when nature has produced them by herself and in her ordinary way; whereas, in fact, it is those we have artifi cially modifi ed, and removed from the common order, that we ought to call wild. In the former, the true, most useful, and natural virtues and properties are alive and vigorous; in the latter we have bastardized them, and adapted them only to the gratifi cation of our corrupt taste.”Th ree diff erent meanings. Each one implies distance between us and them: “. . . there is an amazing diff erence between their characters and ours.” Dis-tance and diversity, as we have seen, were defi nitely appealing to Montaigne, on both an aesthetic and an intellectual level, so he tried to make sense of the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"montaigne, cannibals, and grottoes . 53life and customs of those strange populations. Th en, with a sudden shift of perspective he looked at us, civilized people, through the eyes of the Brazilian natives who had been brought to Rouen, where they stood before the king of France. What they saw, and what he saw through their eyes, made no sense at all. At the end of his essay, he recorded their astonishment when confronted with our society. Even though his words have been quoted innumerable times, they are still painful and hard to read:[Th ey said] that they had noticed among us some men gorged to the full with things of every sort while their other halves were beggars at their doors, emaci-ated with hunger and poverty. Th ey found it strange that these poverty-stricken halves should suff er such injustice, and that they did not take the others by the throat or set fi re to their houses."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"541. Extraordinary, almost prodigious, is how this sixteenth- century story re-lated by Natalie Zemon Davis appeared to contemporaries. Th e fi rst to pre-sent it in this light was the judge Jean de Coras, who had actually investigated and narrated it. Montaigne alluded to it in his essay “Des boyteux,” (“Of the Lame”): “Il me souvient . . . qu’il me sembla avoire rendu l’imposture de celuy qu’il jugea coulpable si merveilleuse et excedant de si loing nostre connois-ance, et la sienne qui estoit juge, que je trouvay beaucoup de hardiesse en l ’arrest qui l’avoit condamné à estre pendu.” It is a telling judgment introducing the celebrated pages on the “sorcieres de mon voisinage” (“the witches of my neigh-borhood”), who had been accused of crimes which Montaigne thought even more unlikely and unproven. Montaigne implicitly links the temerity of the judges who condemn them to death to Coras’s: “Après tout, c’est mettre ses conjectures à bien haut pris que d’en faire cuire un homme tout vif.” Sobriety, a sense of proper limits— these themes, dear to Montaigne, constitute the guiding thread of the essay. Just before the sudden mention of Coras they had inspired in him these beautiful words: “On me faict hayr les choses vray- semblables quand on me le plante pour infallibles. J’ayme ces mots, qui amolis-sent et moderent la temerité de nos propositions: A l’avanture, Aucunement, Quelque, On dict, Je pense, et semblables.”With a sense of discomfort which would have met with Montaigne’s approval, Natalie Zemon Davis writes that in the fi lm about Martin Guerre, in which she participated, she sensed the absence of all those “ ‘perhapses,’ the ‘may- have- beens,’ to which the historian has recourse when the evidence CHAPTER 4Proofs and PossibilitiesPostscript to Natalie Zemon Davis, Th e Return of Martin Guerre"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 55is inadequate or perplexing.” We would be misinterpreting these words if we saw them only as a consequence of a cautious attitude nurtured through a lifetime of working in archives and libraries. On the contrary, Davis says, it was precisely in the course of the fi lming, seeing Roger Planchon experiment-ing with diff erent intonations for the dialogue of the judge [Coras], “that I had my own historical laboratory, generating not proofs, but historical possibilities.”Th e expression “historical laboratory” is, naturally, used meta phor ical ly. If a laboratory is a place where scientifi c experiments take place, the historian, by defi nition, is a researcher for whom such experiments, in the strict sense of the term, are excluded. To reproduce a revolution, an upheaval, a religious move-ment is impossible, not only in actuality, but even in principle, for a discipline that studies temporally irreversible phenomena as such. Th is characteristic does not pertain just to history; we have only to think of astrophysics and paleontology. Th e impossibility of falling back on actual experiments has not prevented each of these disciplines from working out its own scientifi c crite-ria, based, in the common consciousness, on the notion of proof.Th e fact that this notion was elaborated initially in the legal sphere has been dismissed freely by contemporary historians. Until not so long ago the controversy against histoire événementielle waged in the name of constructing more substantial phenomena— economies, societies, cultures— had created an apparently unbridgeable chasm between historical and juridical research. Th e latter, in fact, was often seen as the destructive model of the moralistic diatribes coming from an older po liti cal historiography. But in the last few years the rediscovery of the event (an actual decisive battle, such as the one at Bouvines studied by Georges Duby) as the ideal terrain to analyze the inter-connection of deeply rooted historical tendencies has implicitly opened up to discussion questions thought to have been settled. Moreover, and more spe-cifi cally, the attempt— of which Davis’s book is an example— to discern the concreteness of social pro cesses through the reconstruction of the lives of men and women of modest birth has once again brought out the partial con-tiguity between the viewpoint of the historian and that of the judge. Th is is so if only because the richest sources for research of this type are documents produced by lay and ecclesiastical courts. In these situations the historian has the impression that he is conducting his investigations through an intermediary— an inquisitor or a judge. Trial rec ords, either directly acces-sible or, as in the case of Davis, indirectly, are comparable to the fi rsthand"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"56 . proofs and possibilitiesdocumentation collected by an anthropologist in his fi eld notes, and be-queathed to future historians. Th ese are precious sources even if, inevitably, insuffi cient: an infi nity of questions that the historian asks himself— and that he would ask the actual defendants and witnesses if he were able— were not asked, nor could they have been, by those judges and inquisitors of the past. It is not just a question of cultural distance, but of diff erent objectives. Th e awk-ward professional juxtaposition between the historians and anthropologists of today and the judges and inquisitors of the past is hindered at some point by the diff erence of their methods and objectives. However, this does not dimin-ish the partial overlapping that exists between the two points of view. We are reminded of this vividly the moment that historians and judges fi nd them-selves physically working together in the same society and with the same phenomena. A classic problem, one that might seem to have been resolved for good— that of the relationship between historical inquiry and judicial inquiry— reveals unexpected theoretical and po liti cal implications.Unfortunately, the rec ords of the trial celebrated at Toulouse against Arnaud du Tilh, bigamist and impostor, have been lost. Davis had to content herself with literary reconstructions such as the Arrest memorable of the judge Jean de Coras and Guillaume Le Sueur’s Admiranda historia. In her punctili-ous reading of these texts, bountiful as they are, we detect her regret (fully shared by the reader) for the lost judicial source. We can scarcely imagine what a mine of involuntary data (data not sought by the judges) the trial rec ords would have off ered to a scholar like Davis. But she also asked herself a series of questions for which, four centuries earlier, even Jean de Coras and his col-leagues from the Parlement of Toulouse had sought answers. How had Ar-naud du Tilh succeeded in impersonating so convincingly the part of Martin Guerre, the real husband? Had the two men struck up an earlier understand-ing? And to what extent had Bertrande, the wife, been the impostor’s accom-plice? To be sure, if Davis had limited herself to these questions, the narrative would have remained at the level of the anecdotal. But it is signifi cant that, along with the continuity of the questions, there is a corresponding continu-ity of answers. On the whole Davis accepts the reconstruction of events achieved by the sixteenth- century judges, with one signifi cant exception. Th e Parlement of Toulouse judged Bertrande to be innocent and the son born from her second husband legitimate, because the child was conceived while she was convinced that Arnaud was her true husband— juridically a very delicate point on which Coras dwelt with learned arguments in his Arrest"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 57memorable. But according to Davis, Bertrande had grasped almost at once that the alleged Martin Guerre was actually a stranger, and not her husband: if she accepted him on these terms, it was from choice and not because she was the innocent victim of deception.Th is conclusion is based on conjecture. Bertrande’s thoughts and feelings are unfortunately unavailable but, given the evidence, seem quite obvious to us. Davis takes issue with those historians who tend to portray peasants (espe-cially the women) of this period as persons virtually without any freedom of choice. Th ey argue at this point that this is an exceptional case and not typical, stressing the ambiguity between statistical repre sen ta tion (real or imagined) and historical repre sen ta tion. Actually, the argument should be turned on its head: it is precisely the exceptional nature of the Martin Guerre case that sheds some light on a normality that is diffi cult to document. Inversely, simi-lar situations help in some way to fi ll out the lacunae in the story which Davis has set out to reconstruct: “When I could not fi nd my individual man or woman . . . then I did my best through other sources from the period and place to discover the world they would have seen and the reactions they might have had. What I off er you here is in part my invention, but held tightly in check by the voices of the past.”Th e term “invention” is deliberately provocative, but somewhat deceiving. Davis’s research (and the narration) are not based on the juxtaposition between “true” and “invented,” but on the integration, always scrupulously noted, of “re-ality” and “possibility.” From this stems the frequent use in her book of expres-sions like “perhaps,” “should have,” “one may presume,” “certainly”— which in the language of the historian usually signifi es “quite probably”— and so forth. At this point the divergent perspectives of the judge and the historian seem clear. For the former, the margin of uncertainty had a purely negative signifi cance and might have resulted in a non liquet, or, in modern terms, a dismissal for lack of evidence. For the latter, it sparked further investigation, to link the specifi c case to the context, here understood as the realm of historically de-termined possibilities. Th e biographies of Davis’s personages resemble, from time to time, the biographies of other “men and women of the same time and place,” reconstructed wisely and patiently through the use of notarial, judicial, and literary sources. “True,” “probably,” “proofs,” and “possibilities” are inter-woven, while at the same time remaining rigorously distinct.We have spoken about “narration” in connection with Davis’s book. Th e notion that all books of history, including works based on statistics, graphs,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"58 . proofs and possibilitiesand charts, have an intrinsically narrative component is rejected by many— wrongly, in my opinion. All, however, are willing to acknowledge that some books of history, among which is undoubtedly Th e Return of Martin Guerre, have a richer narrative physiognomy than others. Th e story of Martin Guerre, so dramatic, so full of sensational events, obviously lent itself to such an exposi-tory choice. Th e fact that it has been recounted successively by jurists, novel-ists, historians, and cinema directors makes it a useful case study for refl ection on a problem that is widely debated today— the connection between the narrative in general and historical narrative.Th e oldest accounts of the event— the Admiranda historia of Le Sueur and the Arrest memorable of Jean de Coras— have something dissimilar about them, as Davis notes, although both were written by professional jurists. Common to them is the insistence that the case of the false husband is an unheard- of novelty. But whereas the Admiranda historia takes its inspiration from the then- popular genre of histories of prodigious events, the Arrest mem-orable off ers unusual features. In its alternation between narrative and learned annotations, it has the structure of a legal work. In his dedication to Jean de Monluc, bishop of Valence, in the fi rst edition of his work, Coras modestly underlines its literary limitations: “the tale is brief, I admit, poorly developed, roughly polished, written in a style that is excessively rustic.” Instead, he lauds the subject: “an aff air, so beautiful, so appealing and so monstrously strange.” Almost contemporaneously, the opening sonnet addressed to the reader in the French translation of Le Sueur’s Historia (Histoire admirable d’un faux et supposé mary) emphatically declared that the case exceeded “the prodigious histories” of Christian or pagan writers, “the fables of the ancient poets” (cit-ing Ovid’s Metamorphoses shortly afterward), the “monstrous depictions,” the guiles of Plautus, of Terence or the “new comics,” and “the strangest cases of the tragedians.” Th e analogy with the mix- up of characters in classical comedy was unremarkable: Coras himself had compared the occurrence of the false Martin Guerre with the Amphitrion of Plautus. Le Sueur, instead, had spoken of “tragedy” on two occasions. Coras followed his example in the section added in 1565 to the new edition of the Arrest, expanded to 111 notes from 100. Th e introduction of the term “tragedy” was followed by a comment: “It was truly a tragedy for that genteel rustic (gentil rustre), since his end was sad and misera-ble. Because no one knows the diff erence between tragedy and comedy.” Th is last statement was promptly contradicted by an apparent digression in which Coras, following Cicero’s formula, contrasts comedy, which “describes and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 59represents in a low and humble style the private happenings of men, such as the love and seduction of young girls,” to tragedy, in which “in lofty and grave style the customs, adversities and lives full of misfortunes of captains, dukes, kings and princes are told.” But the affi nity between a stylistic hierarchy and a social hierarchy which inspired this traditional juxtaposition was implicitly rejected by Coras, who merely accepted the equivalence (still familiar to us) between comedy and a happy ending on the one hand, and tragedy and a sad ending on the other. What persuaded him to reject the traditional doctrine (with which he was certainly familiar, although claiming not to know it) was the exceptional nature of the event, and especially of its protagonist, Arnaud du Tilh, nicknamed Pansette, “that genteel rustic.” Davis provides a subtle analysis of that ambivalent fascination exercised on Coras by his hero (whom, in his capacity of judge, he had helped to send to the gallows). We may add that this ambivalence may be underlined precisely by that highly contradictory expression gentil rustre, an oxymoron which Coras repeats twice. Is a peas-ant capable of “refi nement,” an attribute by defi nition tied to social privilege? And how should this contradictory marvel be described? With the “high and grave” style of tragedy, as would seem to be required by the adjective (gentil), or with the “low and humble” ones of comedy, suitable to the noun rustre? At some point even Le Sueur had felt the need to allow the personages in his story more prestige, observing, apropos the precocious marriage of Martin Guerre with the ten- year- old Bertrande, that the wish for posterity is com-mon “not only to great lords, but also to plebeians (mechaniques).” In an impetuous moment Coras actually manages to say that, faced by “the happy event of such an extraordinary memory” exhibited by Arnaud du Tilh dur-ing the trial, the judges had been on the point of comparing him to “Scipio, Cyrus, Th eodectes, Mithridates, Th emistocles, Cineas, Metrodorus or Lucullus”— in other words, to those “captains, dukes, kings and princes” who are the heroes of tragedies. But Arnaud’s “miserable end,” Coras adds, almost as if awakening from a trance, would have obfuscated the splendor of such personages. Th e humble life and ignominious death on the gallows of Arnaud du Tilh, nicknamed Pansette, in the end kept him from being seen as a tragic fi gure in the traditional sense: but in another sense, the one trans-mitted to us by Coras, he can be considered tragic precisely because of that death.

As Natalie Davis has shrewdly observed, the judge in some way had succeeded in identify-ing himself with his victim. How much the probable adherence of both to the reformed faith contributed to this, it is diffi cult to say. But while writing the Arrest memorable, Coras did not suspect that he himself was destined to a “miserable end”: hanging— the same end he had infl icted on Arnaud.Th e classical doctrine of the separation of literary styles and its transgres-sion by Christianity is the dominant theme in Erich Auerbach’s great work on the repre sen ta tion of reality in western Eu ro pe an literature. Analyzing passages from historians of antiquity (Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus) and of the Middle Ages (Gregory of Tours) along with writings of poets, drama-tists, and novelists, Auerbach suggested an approach that has not been pur-sued further. It would be worthwhile to attempt to do so and show how more or less extraordinary facts taken from chronicles and books of travel to dis-tant parts contributed to the birth of the novel and— through this signifi cant intermediary— also to modern historical writing. Jean de Coras’s recogni-tion of a tragic dimension in the Arnaud du Tilh aff air would then fi nd a suitable place among the examples of the weakening of a rigidly hierarchical vision under the pressure of diversity— social, cultural, or natural, depend-ing on the case.2. In the last few years the narrative component in historical writing has been, as we have mentioned, the subject of lively discussion among phi los o phers and students of method, and, more recently, among some leading historians. But their failure to communicate among themselves prevented them thus far from achieving satisfactory results. Phi los o phers have studied single historio-graphical propositions that are usually detached from the context, ignoring the preparatory research that had rendered them possible. In turn, histori-ans have asked themselves if in recent years there has been a return to narra-tive history, disregarding the cognitive implications of the various types of narration. Th e very page from Coras which we have just discussed reminds us that the adoption of a stylistic codex determines certain aspects of reality and not others, emphasizes certain connections and not others, establishes certain hierarchies and not others. Th at all this seems to be connected to the changing relations in the course of two and a half millennia between historical narration and other types of narration— from the epic poem, to the novel, to"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 61fi lm— seems obvious. To analyze these relationships historically— composed, in turn, of exchanges, hybridization, juxtapositions, one- way infl uences— would be much more useful than proposing abstract theoretical formulations, which are often implicitly or explicitly normative.One example may suffi ce. Th e fi rst masterpiece of the bourgeois novel is entitled Th e Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner. In the preface its author, Daniel Defoe, stresses the truthfulness of the story, as opposed to “history,” a “fi ction”: “Th e story is told with modesty, with seriousness. . . . Th e Editor believes the thing to be a just history of fact; neither is there any appearance of fi ction in it. . . .” Henry Fielding, instead, entitled his most famous book Th e History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, ex-plaining that he had preferred “history,” a “life,” or “an apology for a life” following the example of historians: but which ones? “We intend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers, who profess to disclose the revolu-tions of countries, than to imitate the painful and voluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his series, thinks himself obliged to fi ll up as much paper with the detail of months and years in which nothing remarkable hap-pened, as he employs upon those notable eras when the greatest scenes have been transacted on the human stage.”Fielding’s model is Edward Hyde, fi rst earl of Clarendon, the author of History of the Rebellion. From him he learned to condense or expand the time of the narration, breaking with the uniform time frames of the chronicle and the epic that seemed set by an invisible metronome. Th is perception is so important to Fielding that it persuaded him to entitle each of the books into which Tom Jones is divided, beginning with the fourth, with a temporal refer-ence, which until the tenth becomes progressively, convulsively more brief: a year, six months, three weeks, three days, two days, twelve hours, about twelve hours. Two Irishmen, Laurence Sterne and James Joyce, will later reveal the consequences of taking this expansion of narrative time in relation to the ac-tual calendar to extremes: and we get an entire novel dedicated to the descrip-tion of a single, interminable day in Dublin. Th us, at the birth of this remarkable narrative upheaval, we fi nd the history of the fi rst great revolution of the modern era.In the last few de cades historians have discussed at length the rhythms of history; but, signifi cantly, they have said little or nothing about the rhythms of historical narration. If I am not mistaken, an inquiry into the possible reper-cussions of the narrative model inaugurated by Fielding on twentieth- century"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"62 . proofs and possibilitieshistoriography is yet to be done. What is clear, instead, is the dependence— not limited to the treatment of the temporal fl ow— of the En glish novel, which arose in opposition to the “Gothic” current, on older or contemporary historiogra-phy. In the prestige that envelops the latter, such writers as Defoe and Fielding sought legitimacy for a literary genre that at fi rst was still socially discredited. We recall Defoe’s concise declaration about Robinson Crusoe’s adventures as “a true history of facts” without “semblance of falsehood.” In a more elaborate way Fielding asserts that he had wanted to avoid the term “novel,” which, in fact, would have been an appropriate defi nition for Tom Jones, so as not to fall into the disrepute which affl icts “all historical writers who do not draw their materi-als from rec ords.” Instead, Tom Jones, Fielding concludes, truly deserves the epi-thet of “history” (which appears in the title): all the characters are well docu-mented because they step out “of the vast and authentic doomsday- book of nature.” Brilliantly fusing the mention of the land register ordered by William the Conqueror with the traditional image of “book of Nature,” Fielding claimed historical truth for his work by comparing it to archival research. You could call historians those who occupied themselves with “public happenings,” as well as those, like himself, who restricted themselves to “scenes from private life.” For Edward Gibbon, instead, even if pronounced in the sphere of hyperbolic praise (“that exquisite picture of human manners will outlive the palace of the Escurial and the Imperial Ea gle of the House of Austria”), Tom Jones remained, in spite of its title, a “Romance.”But with the growing prestige of the novel the situation changed. Th ough they continued to compare themselves to historians, novelists began to shed their position of inferiority little by little. Balzac’s falsely modest declaration (in reality haughty) in the introduction of his Comédie humaine, “French so-ciety would be the real author, I should only be the secretary,” acquired all its piquancy from that which followed shortly after: “I might perhaps succeed in writing the history which so many historians have neglected: that of manners. By patience and perseverance I might produce for France in the nineteenth century the book which we must all regret that Rome, Athens, Tyre, Mem-phis, Persia and India have not bequeathed to us. . . .” Balzac hurled this grand challenge at historians while claiming a fi eld of research which basically they had left untouched: “. . . I attach to common, daily facts, hidden or pat-ent to the eye, to the acts of individual lives, and to their cause and principles, the importance which historians have hitherto ascribed to the events of the public life of nations.”"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 63Balzac wrote these words in 1842. Roughly a de cade earlier, Giambattista Bazzoni, in the introduction to his Falco della Rupe, o la guerra di Rupo, had expressed himself in similar terms:Th e historical novel is a great lens applied to a detail of an im mense painting [sketched by historians, populated by great personages; in this way] so that what had been barely visible receives its natural dimensions; lightly outlined contours become a regular and perfect design, or, better yet, a composition in which every object receives its true color. No longer the usual kings, dukes, magistrates, but common folk, women, children make their appearance; we see in action vices, domestic virtues, and the infl uence of public institutions on private habits, on the needs and happiness of life, which ultimately is what should interest the univer-sality of mankind.Th e starting point for Bazzoni quite obviously was I promessi sposi (Th e Betrothed). But more time had to pass before Manzoni would decide to pub-lish those pages from Del romanzo storico e, in genere, de’ componimenti misti di storia e d’invenzione (On the Historical Novel) in which the entire question was carefully discussed. He attributed to an imaginary speaker the idea of the historical novel, a form not only diff erent from but even superior to cur-rent historical writing:Th e aim of your work was to put before me, in a new and special form, a richer, more varied, more complete history than that found in works which more com-monly go by this name, as if by antonomasia. Th e history we expect from you is not a chronological account of mere po liti cal and military events or, occasionally, some other kind of extraordinary happening, but a more general repre sen ta tion of the human condition, in a time and place naturally more circumscribed than that in which works of history, in the more usual sense of the word, ordinarily unfold. In a way, there is the same diff erence between the usual sort of history and your own as between a geographic map that simply indicates the presence of mountain chains, rivers, cities, towns, and major roads of a vast region, and a topographic map, where all of this (and what ever else might be shown in a more restricted area) is presented in greater detail and, indeed, where even minor ele-vations and less noteworthy particulars— ditches, channels, villages, isolated homes, paths— are clearly marked. Customs, opinions, whether they are gener-ally accepted or peculiar to certain social classes; the private consequences of public events that are more properly called historical, or of the laws, or will of the powerful, however these are expressed— in short, all that a given society in a given time could claim as most characteristic of every way of life and of their interactions— this is what you sought to reveal at least as far as you managed, through long hard research to discover in yourself."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64 . proofs and possibilitiesFor the imaginary interlocutor the presence of invented elements in this program was contradictory. It does not matter here how Manzoni responded to this and other objections concerning the historical novel. What should be acknowledged, instead, is that he ended up opposing to the historical novel a “possible” history, even if it already had been expressed by many works “whose goal is to reveal not so much the po liti cal course of a society at a given time as its way of life from any number of points of view.” Th ese were vague words which receded immediately before the scarcely veiled recognition that history “still falls short of its goal, still fails to exploit what its subject matter, re-searched and viewed from a broader and more philosophic perspective, has to off er. . . .” From this stemmed the appeal to the future historian to “search every document from that period that you can fi nd. Even treat as documents writings whose authors never, in their wildest imaginations, dreamt they were writing in support of history.”When Balzac argued for juxtaposing the importance of the private lives of individuals with the public life of nations, he was thinking of Lys dans la vallée: “Th e unknown battle which goes on in a valley of the Indre between Mme. Mortsauf and her passion is perhaps as great as the most famous battles. . . .” And when Manzoni’s imaginary interlocutor spoke of “the private consequences of public events that are more properly called histori-cal, or of the laws, or will of the powerful, however these are expressed,” he was naturally alluding to I promessi sposi. But in the considerations of a gen-eral character voiced by both Balzac and Manzoni, in hindsight it is impos-sible not to rediscover the anticipation of the most obvious characteristics of the historical research of the last few decades— from the polemic against the limitations of history that is exclusively po liti cal and military, to the promo-tion of history of the mentality of individuals and social groups, right up to, in the case of Manzoni, a theorization of microhistory and the systematic use of new documentary sources. Th is is a result, as we have said, of an anachronistic reading conducted with the benefi t of hindsight, but nevertheless not wholly arbitrary. It took a century for historians to accept the challenge issued by the great nineteenth- century novelists, from Balzac to Manzoni, from Stendhal to Tolstoy, delving into fi elds of endeavor they had previously ignored, assisted by more subtle and complex explanatory models than the traditional ones. Th e growing predilection of historians for themes (and, in part, for expository devices) previously reserved for novelists— a phenomenon inappropriately de-fi ned as “the rebirth of narrative history”— is nothing more than another"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 65chapter in the long challenge on the terrain of the knowledge of reality. Compared with Fielding’s time, the pendulum is now oscillating in the op-posite direction.Until not so long ago the great majority of historians saw a defi nite in-compatibility between the emphasis on the scientifi c character of historiog-raphy (tendentiously assimilated into the historical sciences) and recognition of its literary dimension. Today, this awareness is more and more often ex-tended also to works of anthropology or sociology without allowing this to necessarily imply a negative judgment by those who advance it. What is usu-ally emphasized, however, is not the cognitive nucleus one fi nds in fi ctional narratives— novels, for example— but rather the fi ctional nucleus in narra-tives with scholarly pretensions, beginning with the historical. Th e conver-gence between the two types of narration should be sought— to make a long story short— in the sphere of art, and not science. Hayden White, for example, has studied the works of Michelet, Ranke, Tocqueville, and Burckhardt as examples of “historical imagination.” And François Hartog, in de pen dently of White and probably inspired instead by the writings of Michel de Certeau, examined book 4 of Herodotus on the Scythians as an autonomous discus-sion, complete in itself as the description of an imaginary world. In both cases the analysis does not go into the pretense to truth in the historical narratives. To be sure, Hartog does not reject in principle the legitimacy of a compari-son of the descriptions of Herodotus with, for example, the results of the archeological excavations in the area north of the Black Sea, or of the re-search on the folklore of those distant descendants of the Scythians, the Ossetians.But this chance comparison with the Ossetian documentation, collected by Rus sian folklorists at the end of the nineteenth century, prompted Har-tog to conclude that Herodotus, in an essential point, “attenuated and mis-understood” the “alterity,” or otherness, of Scythian divination. How can we not conclude that an Essai sur la représentation de l’autre (the subtitle of Har-tog’s book) necessarily implied a less episodic comparison between the text of Herodotus and other documentary series? Similarly, White declared that he had wanted to limit his own research to the “artistic” elements in the “realistic” historiography of the nineteenth century (Michelet, Ranke, Tocqueville, and so forth, using a notion of “realism” taken specifi cally from Erich Auerbach [Mimesis] and E. H. Gombrich [Art and Illusion]). But these two great books, even in their diversity (which White quite properly underlines), are founded"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"66 . proofs and possibilitieson the conviction that it is possible to decide, after a verifi cation of the his-torical or natural reality, whether a novel or a painting is more or less adequate, from the point of view of the repre sen ta tion, than another novel or another painting. Th e refusal, basically relativistic, to descend to this level makes the categories of “realism” used by White a formula without substance. An anal-ysis of the claims to truth within historical narratives as such would have in-volved discussing the concrete problems, connected to the sources and to re-search techniques, which individual historians had set for themselves in their work. If, like White, we ignore these elements, historiography takes the form of a pure and simple ideological document.Th is is Arnaldo Momigliano’s criticism of White’s most recent work (which could be extended, with a certain diff erence, also to Hartog). Momi-gliano disapprovingly recalls certain elementary truths: on the one hand, that the historian works with sources, known or to be discovered; on the other, that ideology contributes to prime research, but then must be kept at a distance. But this fi nal prescription oversimplifi es the problem. Momigliano himself has demonstrated better than anyone else that the principle of reality and ideol-ogy, philological analysis and projection into the past of present- day problems, intertwine, each conditioning the other, in every phase of the historical endeavor— from the identifi cation of the objective and the selection of the documents to the research methods and the weighing of the evidence, and even to the literary pre sen ta tion. Th e unilateral reduction of this highly com-plicated interweaving of so many parts to an action immune from the conten-tiousness of the historical imagination, as proposed by White and Hartog, in the fi nal analysis appears unproductive. It is precisely thanks to the discord raised by the principle of reality (or what ever we want to call it) that histori-ans, from the time of Herodotus, have ended up, in spite of everything, appro-priating extensively from “the other,” at times in a rather ordinary mode, at others by profoundly modifying the cognitive schemes from which they had set out. Th e “pathology of repre sen ta tion,” in Gombrich’s words, does not ex-haust the possibilities. If it had not been possible to correct our actual imagin-ings, expectations, and ideologies on the basis of the responses, frequently un-pleasant, emanating from the outside world, the species Homo sapiens would have perished long ago. Among the intellectual devices that permitted us to adapt to our surroundings (both natural and social), transforming them along the way, historiography must also be included."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 673. Today the insistence on the narrative dimension of historiography (of ev-ery type, even if not in equal mea sure) is accompanied, as we have seen, by relativistic positions which tend to erase de facto all distinctions between “fi c-tion” and “history,” between narratives of the fantastic and narratives with pretense to truth. Against these tendencies, it should be emphasized instead that a greater awareness of the narrative dimension does not imply a weaken-ing of the cognitive possibilities off ered by historiography, but rather, to the contrary, their intensifi cation. Th is will have to be the starting point of a sweeping critique of the language of historiography, which has been barely suggested up to now.Th anks to Momigliano we know that antiquarian research contributed decisively to the birth of modern historiography. But it was Edward Gib-bon himself, the person whom Momigliano named as the symbol of the fu-sion between antiquarianism and the philosophy of history, who attacked in a brief exercise in self- criticism an aspect of chapter 31 of his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He was addressing himself to the con-ditions of Britannia in the fi rst half of the fi fth century— specifi cally, to the modifying infl uence exercised by narrative schemes on the pre sen ta tion of research fi ndings: “I owe it to myself and to historic truth to declare, that some circumstances in this paragraph are founded only on conjecture and anal-ogy. Th e stubbornness of our language has sometimes forced me to deviate from the conditional into the indicative mood.” For his part, Manzoni, in a page from his On the Historical Novel, suggested a diff erent solution. After having contrasted geo graph i cal to topographical maps as images, respectively, of traditional historiography and the historical novel, understood as “a new and special historical form . . . , richer, more varied, more complete,” Manzoni complicated the meta phor by inviting us to distinguish, within the map, what was indisputable from what was speculative. Th e proposal was not in itself new: similar practices had been used for quite some time among philologists and antiquarians. But the extension to narrative history was certainly un-usual, as demonstrated by the aforementioned passage from Gibbon. In Manzoni’s words:It might not be out of place to mention that history sometimes also uses the veri-similar, and can do so harmlessly if it uses it properly and presents it as such, thereby distinguishing it from the real. . . . It is a characteristic of man’s impover-ished state that he can know only something of what has been, even in his own"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68 . proofs and possibilitieslittle world; and it is an aspect of his nobility and his power that he can conjec-ture beyond what he can actually know. When history turns to the verisimilar, it does nothing other than favor or promote this tendency. It stops narrating mo-mentarily and uses, instead, inductive reasoning, because ordinary narrative is not the best instrument for this, and in adjusting to a diff erent situation, it adopts a new purpose. In fact, all that is needed to clarify the relationship be-tween fact and verisimilar is that the two appear distinct. History acts almost like someone who, when drawing a city map, adds in a distinctive color the streets, plazas, and buildings planned for the future and who, while distinguish-ing the potential from the actual, lets us see the logic of the whole. History, at such moments, I would say, abandons narrative, but only in order to produce a better narrative. As much when it conjectures as when it narrates, history points to the real; there lies its unity.Th e integration of the lacunae achieved (and immediately after denounced) by Gibbon might be compared to a pictorial restoration understood as dras-tic overpainting; while the systematic indication of Manzoni’s historio-graphical conjectures might be likened to an instance of restoration in which the lacunae are identifi ed by means of fi ne lines. In every sense this sort of solution was ahead of its time. Manzoni’s text remained without echo. We do not even fi nd a trace of it in the essay “Immaginazione, aneddotica e storio-grafi ca,” in which Benedetto Croce perceptively discussed examples of falla-cious narrative integrations dictated by the “combinatory imagination.”  Croce, for that matter, signifi cantly reduced the signifi cance of his observa-tions by applying them exclusively to the anecdotal, closely related to the historical novel: historiography, in the strict and highest sense of the term, in his opinion, was immune from risks of this type. As we have seen, a historian like Gibbon was not of this opinion.Arsenio Frugoni construed the implications of Croce’s essay in a much more radical sense. In his Arnaldo da Brescia he bitterly censured the “philological- combinatory method”— in other words, the obstinate, ingenu-ous faith of scholars in the providential, complemental aspect of testimonies from the past. Th is belief had created an image of Arnaldo that was fi ctitious and unreliable, which Frugoni demolished, reading each of the sources inter-nally, holding it to the light, to reveal its singular uniqueness. From the writ-ings of St. Bernard, of Otto of Freising, of Gerhoh of Reichersberg, and of similar fi gures emerged other portraits of Arnaldo da Brescia, drawn from many visual perspectives. But this eff ort at “restoration” was accompanied by"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 69the attempt to reconstruct, within the limits of the possible, the personality of the “true” Arnaldo: “Our portrait will emerge like one of those fragments of ancient sculpture, created from vigorous suggestive strokes (do I delude myself?) free of the adulterations of later accretions.” Frugoni ’s Arnaldo, published in 1954, has been discussed only by special-ists. But it is obvious that it was not intended only for students of medieval heresy or of twelfth- century religious movements. Today, many de cades after the book appeared, we can read it as an anticipatory work, which may have suff ered from a certain timidity in bringing the initial critical intention to its conclusion. With the benefi t of hindsight, it now seems clear that its target was not solely the philological- combinatory method but traditional historical narration, often helplessly inclined to integrate (with an adverb, a preposition, an adjective, or an indicative, rather than a conditional, verb) the lacunae in the documentation, transforming a mere torso into a complete statue.Pietro Zerbi, a careful reviewer, was disturbed to recognize in Frugoni’s book a tendency toward “historiographical agnosticism,” moderated only fee-bly by the “aspirations of a true historical mentality, which feels itself mortifi ed when it only perceives dust, even if it is gold dust.”  Th is is not a baseless con-cern: the excessive weight given to narrative sources, as in the case of Frugoni (and also, from totally diff erent cultural presuppositions, in Hartog), contains the inception of an idealistic dissolution of history into the history of histori-ography. But in principle the criticism of evidence so shrewdly suggested by Frugoni not only does not exclude but rather furthers the integration of dif-ferent documentary categories with an awareness that was unknown to the old combinatory method. Th ere is still much to do in this direction.4. In the very act of proposing to introduce conjecture, identifi ed as such, in historical narration, Manzoni reiterated, in somewhat contorted fashion, that “history . . . abandons the telling of the tale, in order to draw nigh, in the only way possible, to that which is the purpose of the narration.” In Manzo-ni’s eyes there was an obvious incompatibility between conjecture and the historical account, understood as the exposition of positive truths. Today, in-stead, the interweaving of truth and possibility, together with the discussion of opposed research hypotheses, alternating with pages of historical recon-struction, no longer disconcerts us. Our sensitivity as readers has under-gone a change thanks to M. I. Rostovzeff and Marc Bloch, but also thanks"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"70 . proofs and possibilitiesto Marcel Proust and Robert Musil. It is not only the category of historical narration that has been transformed, but narration itself. Th e relationship be-tween the narrator and reality becomes more uncertain, more problematic.Historians, however, sometimes hesitate to admit this. And at this point we are better able to understand why Natalie Davis was able to call the screen-ing room of the fi lm about Martin Guerre an actual “historical laboratory.” Th e succession of scenes in which Roger Planchon tried to enunciate with diff erent intonations a single utterance of the judge Coras transformed in one swoop (Gibbon would have said) the indicative of the historical narrative into a conditional. Viewers of Federico Fellini’s fi lm 8 1⁄2 (historians or not) have lived an experience in some ways similar to a scene in which various aspiring actresses follow one after the other on a theater stage to imperson-ate the same personage, uttering wearily or clumsily the same words before the protagonist- director. In Fellini’s fi lm the eff ect of this “dis- realization” is accen-tuated by the fact that the spectator has already seen the “real” person which the aspiring “actresses” are endeavoring to impersonate— a “real” personage who, herself, is a fi lm personality. Th is dizzying game of mirrors reminds us of a well- known fact— namely, that the intertwining between reality and fi ction, be-tween truth and possibility, is at the heart of the artistic creations in this cen-tury. Natalie Davis has reminded us of the benefi ts that historians can draw from this for their work.Te r m s s u c h a s “ fi ction” and “possibility” must not deceive us. More than ever the question of evidence remains the nub of historical research: but its status inevitably is modifi ed the moment diff erent themes are confronted in respect to the past, with the assistance of documentation which is itself di-verse. Davis’s attempt to work around the lacunae with archival materials contiguous in space and time to that which has been lost or never material-ized is only one of the many possible solutions. But extendable to what point? It would be worthwhile to discuss this. Invention is one solution we can in-stantly reject, not only because it would contradict what has been said, but also because it would be absurd, since some of the most celebrated nineteenth- century novelists have disparaged the recourse to invention, attributing it iron-ically to historians themselves. “Cette invention est ce qu’il y a de plus facile et de plus vulgaire dans le travail de l’esprit, ce qui exige le moins de réfl exion, et même le moins d’imagination,” Manzoni wrote in his Lettre à M. Chauvet, claiming for poetry inquiry into the world of the passions from which history, instead, was excluded. Th is is the same history which, “fortunately,” is accus-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"proofs and possibilities . 71tomed to conjecture, as we read in the famous words from I promessi sposi. “I often think it odd that it [history] should be so dull,” refl ected one of Jane Austen’s characters, “for a great deal of it must be invention.”  “To represent and illustrate the past, the actions of men, is the task of either writer [novelist or historian],” wrote Henry James at the end of the nineteenth century, “and the only diff erence I can see is, in proportion as he succeeds, to the honor of the novelist, consisting as it does in his having more diffi culty in collecting his evidence, which is so far from being purely literary.”  One could go on.For the novelists of more than a century earlier, instead, the prestige of historiography was based on an image of absolute veracity in which recourse to conjecture played no part at all. In contrasting historians who occupied themselves with “public transactions” to others, such as himself, who limited themselves to “scenes of private life,” Fielding was pointing out reluctantly the position of greater credibility of the former, based on “public rec ords, with the concurrent testimony of many authors”: on the consensual testimony, in other words, of archival and narrative sources. Th is contrasting of historians to novelists now seems very remote to us. Today historians claim the right to concern themselves with the public acts of Trajan, Antoninus Pius, Nero, or Caligula (the examples cited by Fielding) but also with scenes from the pri-vate life of Arnaud du Tilh, nicknamed Pansette, of Martin Guerre and of his wife, Bertrande. By adroitly uniting erudition and imagination, proofs and possibilities, Natalie Davis has shown that we can write even the history of men and women like them."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"721. Some years ago Marcel Detienne discussed with some irony Moses Finley’s attempt to identify historical elements in Homeric poems. Th e elimination of the mystical element when writing history, Detienne suggested, is a pen-chant typical of historians: it seems worthwhile to examine this idea criti-cally from its most distant roots. Let us look fi rst at an important occur-rence, but from a perspective very diff erent from Detienne’s.2. Th e dialogue De la lecture des vieux romans (On Reading Old Romances), by Jean Chapelain, written sometime between the end of 1646 and early 1647, long remained unpublished; it appeared posthumously eighty years later. At the time Chapelain was working on La Pucelle ou la France delivrée, an ambi-tious poem which, after an initial success, was attacked savagely and became totally discredited. To us today, the rest of Chapelain’s literary activity— his critical essays and vast correspondence— seems much more signifi cant. Th e dialogue De la lecture des vieux romans has enjoyed many editions: 1728 (the fi rst), 1870, 1936, 1971, 1999. But much remains to be said about it.Th e piece is dedicated to Paul de Gondi, at the time the vicar of the arch-bishop of Paris, later celebrated as the cardinal of Retz. In addition to Cha-pelain, two younger men of letters take part in the discussion: the scholarly Gilles Ménage and the historian and poet Jean- François Sarasin. Chapelain recounts that the two men took him by surprise while he was reading a me-dieval romance, Lancelot du Lac. (We learn from the cata logue of Chape-CHAPTER 5Paris, 1647A Dialogue on Fiction and History"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"a dialogue on fiction and history . 73lain’s library that he possessed two printed editions of this work). Th e two friends reacted diff erently. Sarasin had observed that Lancelot was “the source for all the romances that in the last four or fi ve centuries have enjoyed great success in every Eu ro pe an court.” Ménage, enamored of the ancients, had ex-pressed his astonishment at seeing a person of Chapelain’s taste praising a book disdained even by partisans of the modern. Chapelain had replied by saying that he began to read Lancelot to collect materials for a book on the origins of French, an idea that Ménage himself had suggested. In Lancelot, Chapelain said, he had found words and expressions which showed how the French language passed from crude beginnings to the refi nements of that day. Ménage had nothing to say against this projected study. But when Chapelain suggested that he had started to appreciate Lancelot, Ménage could not re-strain himself: “How can you dare to praise this horrid carcass, despised even by the ignorant and by commoners? I hope you are not thinking to discover in this barbaric writer another Homer or Livy?”Naturally, this was a rhetorical question. But to this double, paradoxical comparison, Chapelain reacted unexpectedly. From the literary point of view Homer and the author of Lancelot were wholly dissimilar: the fi rst noble and sublime, the second vulgar and low. But the subject matter in their works was alike: both had written “invented narratives” (fables). Aristotle would have judged Lancelot favorably, just as he had done with the poems of Homer: the way magic was used in the former was not too diff erent from the interven-tion of the gods in the latter.All this is in accord with the writings of seventeenth- century erudites who opened the way for Mabillon and Montfaucon, laying the premises for the discovery of the Middle Ages— what Chapelain called “modern antiquity.” (Th e dialogue De la lecture des vieux romans is a precocious forerunner— in some sense an eccentric one— of the querelle between the ancients and the moderns). Lancelot’s author, Chapelain tells us, was “a barbarian, who was praised by barbarians . . . even if he was not wholly barbarous.” In this attempt to soften his judgment, which was accompanied by the awareness that a ro-mance like Lancelot conformed, after all, to Aristotle’s maxims, it may be pos-sible to recognize retrospectively the origins of a profound transformation in taste. But in the case of Chapelain the discovery of the Middle Ages was tied to history rather than to literature. Th e most original part of his dialogue begins here."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"74 . a dialogue on fiction and historyMénage contemptuously asks if the author of Lancelot should be compared to Livy. Chapelain replies, “To compare Lancelot and Livy would be absurd, just as it would be absurd to compare Virgil and Livy, the false and the true. And yet I dare to declare that, even if Lancelot, since it is based on imaginary events, cannot be compared to Livy as an example of a true narrative (par la vérité de l’histoire), on another level it can, as a true refl ection of manners and customs (par la vérité des mœurs et des coutumes). On this level both authors provide us with perfect accounts: each one, whether Livy or the author of the Lancelot, about the age of which he wrote.”Ménage is bewildered. Chapelain tries to explain his statement in general terms. A writer who invents a story, an imaginary account which has human beings as its protagonists, has to depict people based on the usages and cus-toms of the age in which they lived; otherwise they would not be credible. Chapelain is alluding implicitly to the famous passage in the Poetics (14 51b) in which Aristotle states that “a poet’s object is not to tell what actually hap-pened but what could and would happen either probably or inevitably.” But separating himself from the tradition, Chapelain identifi es in poetic verisi-militude an element that is historical, not logical or psychological. Lancelot, he says, “since it was written in the dark days of our modern antiquity, in-spired only by the book of nature, gives a faithful image, if not of that which really happened between the kings and knights of the time, at least of that which we suppose happened, on the basis of similar customs that still exist, or of documents from which it emerges that similar customs had fl ourished in the past.”Chapelain then concluded: Lancelot provides us with “a veritable repre sen-ta tion [une représentation naïve] as well as, in a certain sense [pour ainsi dire], a sure and exact history of the customs that prevailed in the courts of the day [une histoire certaine et exacte des mœurs qui régnaient dans les cours d’alors].”3. Th e idea that one could draw historical facts from literary writings was not new. Similar attempts can be found even among classical historians. Th ucydides, for example, tried to reconstruct the dimensions of ancient Greek vessels from Homer’s ship cata logue in the Iliad. But when Chapelain pro-posed reading Lancelot more as a historical document than a literary monu-ment, he was undoubtedly thinking of the work of antiquarians. Etienne Pasquier, in his Recherches de la France, fi rst published in 1560 and then revised"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"a dialogue on fiction and history . 75and reprinted many times, included a section on the medieval origins of French poetry. In a similar vein, Claude Fauchet had compiled a Recueil de l’origine de la langue et poésie françoise, ryme et romans, in which he recorded the names and the writings of 127 French poets who lived before 1300. Even more obvi-ous is the connection to another of Fauchet’s works, Origine des dignitez et magistrats de la France, in which passages from the Roman de la Rose or from romances of Chrétien de Troyes were used to clarif y such offi cial positions as maire du Palais, sénéschal, and the grand maistre.At the end of the dialogue Chapelain mentioned a still- unpublished trea-tise by Chantereau Le Fèvre in which the “great antiquarian” had repeatedly cited Lancelot as an authority on medieval usages and customs. Actually, in the Traité des fi efs et de leur origine, published seventeen years later by Chan-tereau Le Fèvre’s son, a single, but signifi cant, reference to Lancelot appears. To clarify the precise meaning of meff aire (the severing of the feudal pact be-tween vassal and lord, on the part of the latter), Chantereau Le Fèvre used a passage from Lancelot, explaining that its author (undoubtedly a monk) had tried to describe, by means of an invented plot and imaginary names, “the cus-toms and way of life [les mœurs et la manière de vivre] of the knights of the time.” In an unpublished writing which mirrors Chapelain’s dialogue, Sara-sin compared reading Lancelot to antiquarianism: “Th e old tapestries, paintings and sculptures that have been passed down to us by our ancestors resemble those old romances which (as Chapelain said) give us a faithful image of the usages and customs of those times.”In his own dialogue Chapelain had developed the same analogy but in another direction. From fi ctional narratives we can extract more fl eeting, but more precious, evidence, precisely because they are fi ctional narratives: “Phy-sicians diagnose the corrupt humors of their patients on the basis of their dreams; similarly, we can analyze the usages and customs of the past through the fantasies portrayed in these writings.”To isolate history from poetry, truth from imagination, reality from mere possibility means reformulating implicitly the distinctions traced by Aristotle in his Poetics. But to dub the anonymous author of Lancelot “the historian of the customs of his day,” asked Ménage, recalling Chapelain’s judgment— is that not perchance the highest praise possible? Especially because, he contin-ued, you claim that his work “constitutes a completion of existing chronicles. Th ey tell us merely that a prince was born or that a prince died; they record"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"76 . a dialogue on fiction and historythe most important events of their reigns, and it all ends there. Th rough a book like Lancelot, instead, we become the intimate friends of these people, even to the point of grasping the very essence of their souls.”4. Chapelain had begun his defense of Lancelot by comparing it provoca-tively, as far as its veracity was concerned, to the most famous medieval chronicles: those of Saxo Grammaticus, Jean Froissart, and Enguerrand de Monstrelet. But then he had raised the bar, arguing for the superiority of the history of manners, histoire des mœurs, over the superfi ciality of the chronicles, although he prudently acknowledged that each complemented the other. To-day these assertions seem highly original, but they appeared that way even to contemporaries. To propose a more profound sort of history on the basis of a romance like Lancelot, Ménage observed, was the height of paradox: it signi-fi ed “presenting as worthy of trust a writer whose narratives were, by your own admission, wholly invented [fabuleuses].” To comprehend the meaning of these words we must make a digression, or perhaps only an apparent one.5. Th e rediscovery of ancient skepticism, which Pierre Bayle equated with the birth of modern philosophy, went through various phases which, in large part, were tied to the publication of the works of Sextus Empiricus. Th e fi rst Latin translation of his Outlines of Pyrrhonism, edited by Henri Estienne (1562), was followed by a reprinting that included the treatise Adversus mathematicos in the Latin version by Gentian Hervet (1569). In 1621 these two Latin transla-tions were republished in four Eu ro pe an cities, in a large in- folio volume, to-gether with the original Greek text.Th e writings of Sextus Empiricus, our principal source for ancient skepti-cism, sparked a discussion on “historic Pyrrhonism,”— in other words, on historical knowledge and its limits— that persisted for a century and a half. Th is was a formula, both polemical and generic, that caused the texts from which the discussion had initiated to be forgotten. Among these were the pages that at mid– sixteenth century had attracted Francesco Robortello’s attention: Adversus mathematicos (1:2 4 8– 2 69). Here Sextus Empiricus was arguing with a number of grammarians— Tauriscus, Asclepiades of Myrleia, Dyonisius (Th rax)— who had broken up grammar into various components, including a historical segment. Asclepiades, for example, maintained that the historical component of grammar should be subdivided into three categories: “History can be either true or false or ‘as- if- it- was- true’: true history is that"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"a dialogue on fiction and history . 77which has as its subject things that really happened; false history is that which deals with fi ction and myth ‘as- if- it- was- true,’ the kind we meet in plays and in pantomimes.”Sextus objected: true history is the sum of numberless facts large and small and thus (unlike medicine or music) lacks method and is not a techné (i n Latin, ars). False history— namely, myth and history as- if- it- was- true, such as plays and pantomimes— deals in facts that have not taken place: impossible in the fi rst instance, possible (but purely hypothetical) in the second. But “since . . . there is no art that has as its subject false and non ex is tent things, and since those myths and fi ctions are false on which the historical compo-nent of grammar dwells especially, we shall have to conclude that any art that concerns itself with the historical part of grammar cannot exist.”Th ere were some who objected, however, that even if the subject matter of history is without method, the judgment formulated on that matter is not, because it is based on a criterion which permits the distinction to be made between what is true and what is false. Sextus responded sharply to this ob-jection: fi rst of all, grammarians do not provide a criterion to distinguish the true from the false; second, no facts adduced by them are true, as the various myths about the death of Ulysses demonstrate.6. True history, false history, history as- if- it- was- true: a threefold target, one more complex than what we usually associate with the seventeenth- century rediscovery of Sextus Empiricus. Today the expression “historic Pyrrhonism” promptly recalls for us the Du peu de certitude qu’il y a dans l’histoire (1668), by La Mothe Le Vayer— the learned skeptic to whom the education of the crown prince had been assigned. Th e kind of history about which La Mothe Le Vayer, by now in his seventies, expressed his uncertainty was naturally that history claiming to be true. But this was just one stage in a much more com-plex intellectual journey, as is testifi ed by Jugement sur les anciens et principaux historiens grecs et latins, dont il nous reste quelques ouvrages, which La Mothe Le Vayer had published twenty years earlier (1646). Bayle’s opinion that it was a mere compilation, although competently done, has weighed heavily over this work. Th e negative judgment is undeserved.Th e letter of dedication to Cardinal Mazarin turns on the relationship between history and poetry. One might think, La Mothe Le Vayer writes, that such poems as those of Lucan and Silius Italicus, if judged by their con-tent, could be defi ned as histories. But poetry “cannot do without fi ction"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"78 . a dialogue on fiction and history[fable],” while history “is worthy of note only for the truth it expresses [ver-ité], and considers falsehood a mortal enemy.” It would be absurd to confuse things that are so diff erent. But a survey of ancient historians, La Mothe Le Vayer concludes, will meet with scant success among “the infi nite number of persons who prefer imaginary accounts [contes fabuleux] to true narratives [narrations véritables], and the history of romances to the entire history of the Romans [et l’histoire des Romans à toute celle des Romains].”Reading these pages, it is impossible not to think of Chapelain’s dialogue, De la lecture des vieux romans. It undoubtedly was prompted by La Mothe Le Vayer’s just- published Jugement, but it took the form of a discussion, not a polemical reaction. In the course of the Jugement the contrast between fable and histoire expressed by La Mothe Le Vayer in his dedication to Cardinal Mazarin reappears in guises that bit by bit assume more complex and nuanced forms, beginning with the fi rst chapter, on Herodotus. From antiquity the work of Herodotus as a historian had been treated as fabula, as falsehood— an accusation rejected by Henri Estienne (Stephanus), the fi rst editor of Sextus Empiricus, who in his Apologia pro Herodoto had championed the veracity of Herodotus on the basis of the accounts provided by travelers to the New Wo rl d . La Mothe Le Vayer’s defense, instead, turned on an argument in Herodotus: “We cannot say either that he mixed up indiff erently truth and falsehood without distinguishing between them, or that he was a liar, al-though he often reiterated the lies of others, something which is admitted by even the most rigorous historical norms. It is precisely these norms, in fact, which oblige us to include the rumors that abound and the various opinions of men, as Herodotus observes most opportunely in his Polimnia apropos the Argives in a forewarning that serves for the entire work.” In eff ect, Herodotus had asserted in no uncertain terms his own distance from the subject matter under discussion: “For myself, though it be my business to set down that which is told me, to believe it is none at all of my business; let that saying hold good for the whole of my history” (7:152).La Mothe Le Vayer extends this claim to historiography in general. No one demonstrates this better than Polybius, who has been reproached un-fairly for being more phi los o pher than historian. A strong affi nity exists between history and philosophy: history can be defi ned as “philosophy full of examples.”  Polybius observes, at the close of book 6 of his Histories, con-tinues La Mothe Le Vayer:"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"a dialogue on fiction and history . 79that the superstition condemned by all peoples was considered a virtue by the Romans. Even if it was possible to establish a state composed only of wise and virtuous men, we have to recognize that these imaginary opinions [opinions fabu-leuses] about the gods and the underworld would be totally useless. But since there are no states in which the people are diff erent than those we can observe, inclined toward all sorts of unlawful and malicious acts, we must make use, to keep them in check, of the imaginary fears provoked by our religion and of the terrors of the other world, so opportunely introduced by the ancients, and which today only fearless persons who have lost use of their reason could contradict.Taking his cue from a famous page in the Histories of Polybius (6: 6, 6– 15), La Mothe Le Vayer was restating the thesis so dear to learned libertines of the origin and po liti cal function of religion. Feeling protected by the fact that he was quoting another writer, La Mothe Le Vayer could speak tran-quilly of the “imaginary fears stirred up by our religion [craintes imaginaires qu’imprime nostre religion].” Th e objective reader [deniaisé] immediately under-stood that here it was not just the religion of the Romans that was being dis-cussed. Today, as then, the populace had to be controlled through the terror of a non ex is tent hell. Today, as then, this truth was understood only by the privi-leged few. Polybius was one of them. It is impossible to present him as a man “devoted to the religion of his day”; Isaac Casaubon’s attempt to defend him at all costs was in vain, La Mothe Le Vayer comments with irony.Th e historian- philosopher who writes about the beliefs of the people without sharing them takes on the semblance of the learned libertine. Con-versely, the erudite libertine who looks upon the beliefs of the populace from afar, without accepting them, recognizes himself in the historian: in Herodotus, and, even more, in Polybius. Th ereby La Mothe Le Vayer was in fact reject-ing the accusation which Sextus Empiricus had directed at history: that it was not an art. History is indeed an art which, contrary to what Sextus Em-piricus sustained, can very well have “as its subject false and non ex is tent things”— in other words, myths and the fi ctional. For La Mothe Le Vayer one of the assignments of history is to expose that which is false.7. And yet, the most fi ery pages of the Jugement are reserved not for Th ucydides or Polybius but for an entirely diff erent type of historian: Diodorus Siculus. Th ere were those who criticized his History as vacuous and inconsistent, but La Mothe Le Vayer wholeheartedly disagreed: “I would be disposed to journey"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"80 . a dialogue on fiction and historyto the tip of the world, so to speak,” he wrote forcibly, “if I thought I could fi nd there such a great trea sure,” the lost books of Diodorus:As far as that which concerns the fi ctions [les fables] and the excellent mythology contained in the fi rst fi ve books of Diodorus, not only do I not condemn them but, instead, I believe that they are the most precious that have been left to us by antiquity. Apart from the fact that what is fi ctional can be recounted seriously [on peut conter des fables serieusement], and that if they were wholly useless, we would also have to reject, together with Plato’s Timaeus, quite a few other famous works, we can say that they [the fi rst books of Diodorus] introduce us to the complete theology of the idolaters. And if it was permissible to call a profane thing by a sacred name, I would dare to defi ne the fi ve books of which I am speaking the Bible of paganism. First of all, they introduce us to pagan beliefs about eternity and the creation of the world. Th en they describe the birth of the fi rst humans in accord with natural intelligence. . . .Th e last sentence clarifi es what preceded it. It pays implicit homage to Giulio Cesare Vanini, burned by order of the Parlement at Toulouse in 1619 as a heretic, atheist, and blasphemer. In his De admirandis Naturae arcanis (1616) Vanini affi rmed that the fi rst men had been born from the soil warmed by the sun, just as in the account of Diodorus (1: 10), and that mice emerged from the mud of the Nile. Th e fi rst books of Diodorus’s history can be read in a way that helps us to put the Bible into perspective: in a sense, as an anti- Bible. But La Mothe Le Vayer recognizes that Diodorus “can be censured for the great superstition he exhibits in his writings,” just as with Livy among Latin historians.Th us, in this case, not Diodorus but his readers, and principally La Mothe Le Vayer, are responsible for the critical distance from the subject matter treated. For the French writer, what fed into history was not just what was fi c-tional but even fi ctional history, to use once more the categories of the Alexan-drine grammarians revived polemically by Sextus Empiricus. Th e fi ctions (fables) reported, and shared, by Diodorus could have become the subject mat-ter of history. Chapelain, who took for granted Livy’s veracity, extended the discussion in La Mothe Le Vayer’s Jugement to the fi ctions (fables) of Homer and of Lancelot: both could become the stuff of history.8. What we call critical detachment often can have unforeseen consequences. But at its roots we invariably fi nd a sense of superiority: social, intellectual, re-ligious. (Th e most famous instance is that of the preeminence claimed by"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"a dialogue on fiction and history . 81Christianity over Judaism, to which we owe the idea of historical perspec-tive.) La Mothe Le Vayer and the erudite libertines looked down with scorn on the populace imprisoned by the fi ctions of religion— a populace which had to be kept ignorant about the attacks leveled against those fi ctions: if the fear of hell should vanish, the latent violence in society would explode, destroy-ing it. To this sense of detached superiority we owe the comparison between pagan myths and the biblical accounts proposed by La Mothe Le Vayer in his Cinq dialogues faits à l’imitation des anciens. Th ere was a strong temptation to see religions as a sequence of errors. But the demystifi cation could open the way for attempts at understanding the error from within, from the viewpoint of those who had been its protagonists (or, if you will, its victims).Chapelain’s dialogue De la lecture des vieux romans illustrates this transi-tion. He did not share the erudite impiety of the libertines: his sense of supe-riority when confronting “modern antiquity” was rooted in taste. In a society dominated by swift changes in fashion, the literary production of what wou ld come to be ca l led t he Midd le Ages see med eve r more re mote. Shortly after, the culture promoted by Louis XIV and his court would widen this gulf still further. “Who is there delighting in reading Guillaume de Loris or Jean de Meun,” asked Valentin Conrart in 1665, the fi rst secretary of the Acadé-mie, “unless he is moved by a curiosity similar to what might have been felt by the Romans who in the age of Augustus read verses by the brothers Salius which they would not have been able to understand?” But this antiquarian curiosity was nothing new. Fifty years before the advent of the new Augustus, the erudite Claude Fauchet had written: “Any writer, even the worst, can be useful under certain circumstances, if only as a witness of his own time [au moins pour le témoignage de son temps].”Even the worst, or perhaps precisely the worst: the distance from the domi-nant taste facilitated the reading of medieval literary texts from a documentary perspective. But Chapelain went a step further by transforming the distance into emotive proximity. Ménage understood this. Toward the conclusion of De la lecture des vieux romans he seems to be accepting the point of view of his interlocutor: “Th rough a book like Lancelot . . . we become the intimate friends of these people, even to the point of grasping the very essence of their souls.”9. Th is unambiguous assertion brings us back to a well- known fact: the imperceptible impulse we feel when we come to a fi ctional work. A famous"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"82 . a dialogue on fiction and historypassage comes to mind in which Coleridge, setting out from an extreme case (the description of supernatural events), attempts to defi ne the eff ects of po-etry in general. It is a question, he wrote, of transferring from our inner na-ture “a semblance of truth suffi cient to procure for these shadows of imagi-nation that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith.” Poetic faith gives form to shadows, endows them with an appearance of truth; it causes us to suff er “and all for nothing! for Hecuba!”  Historical faith functioned (or functions) totally diff erently. It allows us to overcome incredulity, nourished by the recurring objections of skepticism, relating to an invisible past, through a series of opportune operations— marks scratched on paper or on parchment; coins; fragments of statues corroded by time; and so forth. Not only this: it permits us, as Chapelain showed, to build the truth on fi ction (fables) and true history on the fi ctitious."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"831. In La historia del mondo nuovo, a book published in Venice in 1565 which was reprinted and translated many times, the Milanese Girolamo Benzoni described what he had seen in the course of a series of voyages, extending over fourteen years, to the “islands and seas newly discovered” beyond the ocean. On the island of Hispaniola, he recounted:Just as in the other provinces of these new lands, there are certain small trees, shaped like reeds, which produce a leaf resembling that of the walnut, but larger, held in the highest esteem by the inhabitants and greatly prized by the slaves whom the Spaniards brought from Ethiopia. When these leaves are in season, they gather them and tying them in bundles where they make their fi res they hang them until the time they are quite dry, and when they are ready to use them they take a leaf from their ears of corn, and placing one of these other leaves in-side it, they roll them together into a tube, then they light it at one end and insert the other in their mouths, inhale so that the smoke enters their mouths, in their throat and in their heads, and they tolerate it as much as possible, bearing it be-cause it gives them plea sure, and they fi ll themselves with this cruel smoke to the point that they leave their senses; and there are some who inhale it so much, that they fall to the ground as if they were dead, and here they lie the greater part of the day or night stupefi ed. . . . See what a pestilential and evil poison of the dev il this is. It has happened to me often, traveling through the province of Guati-malla and Nicaraqua, to enter the house of some Indian who had taken this herb which in the Mexican language is called tobacco. . . .In the footsteps of the Rus sian formalists, especially those of Viktor Sklovskij (1893– 1984), we have learned to search for estrangement in the CHAPTER 6Th e Eu ro pe ans Discover (or Rediscover) the Shamans"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamansexpression of the savage, of the child, or even of an animal: beings outside the conventions of civilized life, who react with a bewildered or indiff erent gaze, thus indirectly communicating their insensibility. Here we fi nd ourselves in a situation that is paradoxically reversed: the alien is the Milanese Girolamo Benzoni; the persons performing under his very eyes the senseless act of light-ing up a cigarette and smoking it are the Indian savages— opposites of our-selves, the dwellers in the civilized world. In Girolamo Benzoni’s fl ight (“in-stantly sensing the acute stench of this truly diabolical and fetid smoke, I was forced to escape with great haste and proceed elsewhere”) we are tempted to see the symbolic anticipation of a centuries- old historical phenomenon: the retreat of nonsmokers in the face of the advance, which now has perhaps reached its extreme limit, of the army of smokers.Th e account by our Milanese traveler is but one of countless testimonials of the Eu ro pe ans’ encounter with the bewildering novelties found beyond the seas: animals, plants, customs. Today it is fashionable to examine these docu-ments by means of a generalized category: that of the confrontation with the Other— a term which has something of the metaphysical about it but which appropriately underlines the intimate connection, in these reactions, be-tween natural otherness and cultural otherness. Girolamo Benzoni’s invec-tive against the eff ects of tobacco (“See what a pestilential and evil poison of the dev il this is”) is immediately followed by a description of how the plant was used by native doctors for healing purposes. Th e patient, “intoxicated” by smoke, “upon returning to his senses recounted a thousand things, of having been to the council of the gods, experiencing exalted visions”; then the doctors “turned him around . . . three or four times, and with their hands rubbed his body, devoting much attention to the face, holding a bone or a stone in the mouth; and these things are believed by women to be sacred, considering that they are good, helping with childbirth. . . .” Clearly, in the eyes of the Milanese traveler, the native doctors were simply warlocks; and the eff ects of the tobacco they administered, merely diabolical hallucinations.Th e attribution of these negative qualities to tobacco can also be found, even if mingled with contrary considerations, in a book written some years later by a physician of Seville, Nicolas Monardes: Primera y secunda y tercera partes de la historia medicinal. On the one hand we fi nd praise for the “great healing qualities” of tobacco, only recently introduced in the gardens and orchards of Spain, in the cure of every type of malady: asthma; chest, stomach, and uterine pains; and on the other, scandalized descriptions of the uses which"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 85the Indios made of this miraculous plant in their religious ceremonies. Th e priests, Monardes wrote, before divining the future, became stupefi ed with the tobacco smoke to the point of collapsing on the ground as if dead. Th en, after they were revived, they responded to the questions which had been put to them, interpreting “in their own way, or by following the inspiration of the Dev il,” the fantasies and illusions they had experienced in their cataleptic states. But it was not only priests who became “inebriated” (e mb o r ra c h a r s e) with tobacco smoke: the natives used to do the same to draw, from the images that entered their minds, plea sure or signs about the future. “Th e Dev il, who is a deceiver and knows the powers of the plant,” Monardes comments, “has taught the Indios the virtues of tobacco, and he tricks them through the imagining and fantasizing induced by it.”For Monardes, then, one of the characteristics of tobacco is the power to cause “imaginings and fantasies” which physicians in antiquity had attrib-uted to the root of the black nightshade, to anise, and to horse radish. But in Monardes’s book the greatest attention is concentrated on two substances endowed with hallucinatory properties and widely consumed in the East In-dies: bangue and anphion, identifi able, respectively, with marijuana and opium. For bangue (or Cannabis indica, as it was called by Eu ro pe an botanists) Mo-nardes cites the discussion dedicated to this plant by the Portuguese physi-cian Garcia da Orta, author of a work in dialogue form on the grasses and aromas of the East Indies; but he adds details and explanations based on di-rect observation. Garcia de Orta spoke generically about the spread of bangue and of opium; Monardes stated that the latter substance was the choice of the poor, whereas the wealthy preferred bangue, which was tastier and had a better aroma. A few years earlier a physician of Burgos, Cristóbal Acosta, in his Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias Orientales, had sketched a sort of typology of bangue users: some took it to forget their fatigue and to achieve restful sleep; others, to induce pleas ur able dreams and illusions; still others, to become intoxicated, or for its aphrodisiac eff ects (about which Monardes, in-stead, was silent); and the great lords and military leaders, to forget their worries. Th e entire corpus of evidence emphasizes the reliance on these stupe-fying substances by the inhabitants of the East Indies: fi ve grains of opium, observed an astonished Monardes, suffi ces to kill one of us; sixty grains gives the Indios health and repose.Repose, descanso: the barbarians of the West Indies (it is still Monardes writing) make use of tobacco to dispel fatigue; those of the East Indies use"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"86 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamansopium, an extremely common substance there which is sold in the shops. In Peru, Girolamo Benzoni related, natives “carry in their mouths an herb called coca, and they use it to sustain themselves so they will be able to walk an en-tire day without eating or drinking: and this herb is their principal trading object. . . .” Th e signifi cance of this becomes clearer if we examine the evi-dence over the course of many centuries. Th e transoceanic journeys of discov-ery came upon such widespread and intense dissemination of inebriating and stupefying substances as to be compared by Le Roy Ladurie in a famous essay to the microbic unifi cation of the globe. In fact, in the span of a few centu-ries tobacco, opium, marijuana, and derivatives from coca penetrated (by vari-ous means and to diff erent degrees) the cultures of the colonizers; wine and liquors, even more rapidly, spread among the colonized societies.Since I have broached a serious problem which often is treated lightly, a possible misunderstanding needs to be dispelled at once. It is sometimes ar-gued that since all intoxicating and stupefying substances are, as “drugs,” po-tentially harmful, it is inevitable— if we do not want to succumb to a general sort of prohibitionism— that we should legalize their sale, without excep-tions of any sort. In my opinion this is an artifi cial conclusion, based on a false premise. Many, perhaps most, human societies have used or still use, in diff ering ways and circumstances, substances which off er those who adopt them temporary access to an extraordinary set of experiences. Temporary es-cape from history (partial or total) is an unavoidable ingredient in human his-tory. But the degree of control which each culture— naturally in addition to the individuals who compose them— exercises over these substances varies greatly, and is only in part explainable by a pharmacological analysis of their eff ects. On each occasion a cultural component, a fi lter, also intervenes, although how it functions largely eludes us. Why, one may ask, have alcoholic bever-ages with which, for better or worse, Eu ro pe an societies have learned to live in the course of a few millennia (in the case of wine) or only a few centuries (with distilled liquors) had such a destructive eff ect in just a few de cades on the native cultures of North America?Th is is an obvious example. I mention it here because it permits me to in-troduce an extraordinary passage from a report which the French Jesuit Paul de Brebeuf sent in 1636 to the provincial of his order to inform him of events occurring that year in the Quebec mission. One of the members had ex-plained to the natives (the report naturally calls them “sauvages” [savages]) that their high mortality rate was caused by the wines and liquors, which they"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 87did not know how to consume in moderation. “Why do you not write to your great King,” one of the natives asked, “to prohibit the transporting of these bev-erages which are killing us?” “Th e French,” the Jesuit answered, “need them to help them stand the sea voyages and the freezing temperatures of these places.” “Well, then,” the other said, “arrange that they be the only ones to drink them.” At this point, a second native stood up: “No, it is not these beverages which kill us, it is your writings. As soon as you started to describe our country, our rivers, our lands, our forests, we all began to die, in a way that was not happening be-fore you came.”Paul de Brebeuf and his fellow missionaries had reacted to these words with hearty laughter. Today, three and a half centuries later, we can admire the clearheadedness of the anonymous native and agree with his assessment. Th e geo graph i cal writings of the Jesuits opened the way to the Eu ro pe an colonial conquests: they were a fi rst step. Th e immoderate consumption of the alco-holic beverages brought by the Eu ro pe ans was only an aspect of the disintegra-tion of native culture caused by colonization.Even the use of intoxicating and numbing substances by the colonizers had undoubtedly been conditioned by cultural fi lters. But how these fi lters worked is not so obvious. An imaginary sixteenth- century gambler who might have tried to foresee, on the basis of the reactions of travelers, missionaries, and botanists, which of these substances pop u lar outside Eu rope would have been the fi rst to arrive in the old continent, presumably would have pointed to bangue, to opium, and to coca. In the contemporary documentation they are mentioned in a neutral, objective tone, without any suggestion of moral or religious disapproval. Tobacco, instead— even in the writings of the Seville physician Monardes, who insisted on its extraordinary medicinal proper-ties— is associated unequivocally with vice, sin, or even the Dev il. But in spite of these condemnations, or perhaps partly because of them, what took root in Eu rope was precisely the use of that “pestiferous and evil” tobacco.2. Why did these intoxicating substances provoke such diff erent reactions among sixteenth- century Eu ro pe an travelers? A reply to this question has to be cautious and provisional, since marijuana (otherwise known as bangue), opium, and coca have not received the kind of serious, critical bibliographical attention evident in Jerome E. Brooks’s massive To b a c c o . Presumably the conjectures which follow will have to be corrected in the light of more sys-tematic future research."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamansWe can begin with a few pages from a celebrated work: the Historia general y natural de las Indias, by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo (1535). Th e second chapter of book 5 is dedicated to the use of tobacco on the island of Hispaniola. From the outset we detect a tone of strong moral reproach: “Th e Indios of this island, in addition to other vices, had a terrible one [muy malo]: that of inhaling smoke, which they call tobacco, for the purpose of losing their senses.” Th is is followed by a description which agrees on many points with that of Girolamo Benzoni, who undoubtedly knew Oviedo’s work when he wrote his own a few de cades later. Th e Indios, Oviedo observes, cultivate the plant, believing that its use “is not only healthy but holy” (no tan solamente les era cosa sana, pero muy sancta cosa). Sometimes they resort to it to alleviate their physical pain; and even an occasional Christian does the same. Th e negro slaves use it to ease their fatigue at the end of a hard day’s labor. Nonetheless, these factual obser-vations are followed, in the concluding paragraph, by a condemnation:In this regard it seems appropriate to recall a vicious and evil habit practiced, to-gether with other criminal off enses, by the inhabitants of Th race, according to what Abulensis writes on Eusebius, De observatione temporum [3:168]. He states that these people, both men and women, follow the custom of gathering around the fi re to eat, trying to become drunk, or feigning it; and since they are without wine, they take the seeds of certain plants which grow in those parts and roast them in the embers. Th e fragrance given off by these seeds intoxicates those pres-ent, even in the absence of wine. In my opinion, all this resembles the tobacco which is taken by the Indios.Abulensis is the Spanish theologian Alonso de Madrigal, better known as Alonso Tostado, bishop of Ávila. In his commentary, published in Sala-manca in 1506, to Eusebius’s ecclesiastical History, he speaks, apropos a pas-sage in Solinus’s wide- ranging Polyhistor, of the Th racians’ custom of gather-ing around the fi re to inebriate themselves by inhaling the smoke of roasted seeds. But Tostado’s allusion to the absence of wine among the Th racians can be traced to one of Solinus’s sources, the geographer Pomponius Mela. Th e latter, in the fi rst century of the Christian era, wrote a work, De orbis situ, which recounts, in the chapter on Th race (2:2), the ceremony which we have just described.Th e story does not end here, because Pomponius Mela, in turn, had ap-plied to the Th racians Herodotus’s account (4:73– 75) of a Scythian custom. But more about that later. Where has this digression taken us? It has al-lowed us to reconstruct the cultural fi lter which enabled Oviedo, among"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 89others, to become acclimated to the natural and cultural peculiarities of the North American continent. Th anks to Pomponius Mela and to Solinus, the intoxicating herb smoked by the Indios could be identifi ed with one used by the Th racians, which, although not fully described, had similar inebriating eff ects. An obvious element contributed to making this connection: the drunkenness caused by alcoholic beverages, primarily wine, constituted for a Latin cosmographer of the fi rst century a.d., as for a French or Italian traveler of fourteen or fi fteen centuries later, the implicit model by which to describe and evaluate behavior provoked by any sort of inebriating substance. Pom-ponius Mela observed that Th racians, who did not know wine, entered a happy state resembling drunkenness by inhaling smoke exuded by the roasted seeds of an unidentifi ed plant. Th e Jesuit François du Creux wrote in 1664 in his history of Canada that the inhabitants of those lands always traveled equipped with petun—tobacco—and with “a rather longish tube” (a sort of pipe) to be able to enter into a state of inebriation “resembling that which is caused by wine.” Quite possibly this learned cleric, ready to compare the no-madism of the Canadian natives with that of the Scythians, was familiar with the passage in Pomponius Mela. But the perception of tobacco as an al-ternative to wine goes far beyond an occasional erudite citation. It permeates the vocabulary of travelers and missionaries. “We fi nd people who delight in drinking this smoke,” wrote Girolamo Benzoni apropos the natives of Hispan-iola. Th e Canadian savages “usent aussi du petun [tobacco] et en boivent la fu-mée,” we read in a report written a half century later by the Jesuit Pierre Biard.Many Eu ro pe an observers noted that tobacco was used by North Ameri-can natives on ritual occasions. It is Biard who underscores that among the savages of New France any sort of ceremony— from decision making, to trea-ties, to public receptions— involved the use of petun: “Th ey seat themselves in a circle around a fi re, passing the pipe from hand to hand, and in this way they consume many hours together very pleas ur ably.” Th e recognition of a ritual dimension in the use of tobacco, even if not an actually religious one, is dis-cernible also in those words of Oviedo: for the natives of Hispaniola it is “not only healthy but holy.” We have already mentioned the use made of it by priests on the same island. All this suggests that tobacco, as an instrument for private plea sure and public rituals, appeared to the eyes of Eu ro pe an observers as a kind of symbolically reversed wine: a sort of sacred substance, but used by na-tives in ceremonies that they, the Eu ro pe ans, considered idolatrous. Th is"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"90 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamansexplains the diff erence between the relaxed attitude in regard to opium, bangue, and coca— inebriating substances which the colonizers associated, correctly or not, with a sort of purely private consumption— and the open hostility they showed toward tobacco. It was an aversion destined to give way in the face of the aggressive off ensive launched by tobacco producers.In the early sixteenth century, we recall, Oviedo had deduced, through the texts of Pomponius Mela and Solinus on the Th racians, that it was to-bacco the Indios smoked. At mid– seventeenth century the trajectory became reversed, and a highly cultivated scholar, Isaac Vossius, interpreted the pas-sage in Pomponius Mela as an allusion to tobacco. Ivy, arbutus, and cycla-men can induce inebriation: but what other plant, “praeter [besides] nicotia-nam,” can stupefy by its very smoke?Th is rhetorical question made it clear that tobacco was already known in antiquity: it was a thesis cropping up often from the sixteenth century on. In 1724 the Jesuit Joseph- François Lafi tau discussed the question fully in a work entitled Mœurs des sauvages amériquains, comparées aux mœurs des pre-miers temps. As for the Greeks and Romans, Lafi tau reached, perhaps re-luctantly, a negative conclusion. But a passage from Maximus of Tyre on the Scythians, along with those by Pomponius Mela and Solinus on the Th ra-cians, seemed to him to off er solid (even if not defi nitive) proof that those barbaric peoples used tobacco. It was one more clue to add to numerous oth-ers that testifi ed, according to Lafi tau, to the Eu ro pe an origins of the fi rst in-habitants of the American continent. But the demonstration of the antiq-uity of tobacco use led to high praise of its virtues— signifi cant because it was couched in defi nitely non- Eurocentric terms which overturned the previous negative connotations. Th at which in Eu rope served for simple pleas ur able consumption, in America (according to Lafi tau) was used by the natives as a sacred herb “with countless religious applications” (à p l u si e u r s u s a g e s d e r e l i g i o n). In addition to the power ascribed to it of “extinguishing the fl ame of concu-piscence and the rebellion of the fl esh, [tobacco serves] to enlighten the soul, to purify it, to prepare it for ecstatic dreams and visions; it works to summon the spirits, forcing them to communicate with men and accommodate the needs of the people who pay them homage; it serves to heal all the infi rmities of soul and body. . . .”3. Ecstatic dreams and visions; communing with spirits: we are approaching the subject of this chapter, “Th e Eu ro pe ans Discover (or Rediscover) the Sha-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 91mans.” What has been said thus far appears to constitute only a series of digressions, imposed by the fl eeting nature of our subject.In the years when the Jesuit Lafi tau was publishing the results of his gran-diose and daring work on the customs of the American continent, Rus sian penetration into Central Asia and the Far East was proceeding apace. De-scriptions of those remote lands and the nomadic peoples who inhabited them began to reach the West. In 1698, a merchant of Lübeck, Adam Brand, the secretary of a mission that had been sent to China by Peter the Great, produced a report, quickly translated into various Eu ro pe an languages, which for the fi rst time considered the Tungusic term shaman as synonymous with priest or magus. Brand was echoed some years later (1704) by the Dutch merchant E. Isbrants Ides, who had guided the original mission. Not long after, a captain in the dragoons, Johann Bernhard Müller, previously in the ser vice of the Swedish monarchy and then a prisoner of war of the Rus sians, inserted in a report on the Ostiacks and their customs an analytical descrip-tion (though probably not based on direct observation) of a shamanistic ses-sion replete with cataleptic fi ts and divination. To w a r d m i d – e i g h t e e n t h century large tomes began to appear written by scholars who had participated in actual scientifi c expeditions to Siberia, such as one, spanning almost a de-cade, involving Johann Georg Gmelin, professor of chemistry and botany at Tübingen; there were other works— by the physician Daniel Gottlieb Mes-serschmidt, by the philologist Müller, and by a botanist, Johann Amman. In a prolix, three- volume relation of his travels Gmelin reported on his encounters with shamans in Siberia, a few of whom revealed their tricks to him. Al-though there is no doubt that Gmelin considered these persons crude charla-tans, he faithfully transcribed their chants. Even their ecstatic moments fi lled him with curiosity: in his great Latin work on Siberian fl ora he noted that the Buryats used the juniper berry to awaken their “praestigiatores” (shamans) from swoons, and that the inhabitants of Kamchatka used stinging nettle, supposedly ideal for inducing visions, in their idolatrous cults.In just a few de cades this research assured Siberian shamans a prominent place in the developing fi eld of comparative religion. A small work by Chris-toph Meiners, a Göttingen professor, is a signifi cant example of this prog-ress: Grundriß der Geschichte aller Religionen (Lemgo, 1785). Th e title is decep-tive. Th e book is a pioneering eff ort in phenomenology, not in the history of religion. Th e decision to center the narration “on the natural succession of the most important constituent elements [nach der natürlichen Folge ihrer"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"92 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamanswichtigsten Bestandtheile],” rather than on a chronological- geographical se-quence, took in en bloc all religions, whether revealed or not, with obvious deistic implications. Shamans were assigned a special niche in the chapter dedicated— a signifi cant juxtaposition— to jongleurs (literally “conjurers”) and priests. But then the thematic subdivisions caused shamans to reappear in the furthest imaginable places: for example, at the end of the bibliographical notes of the chapter on sacrifi ce (including human sacrifi ces), which begin with the Pentateuch, continue with Greek and Roman writers, and conclude with a contemporary traveler, Johann Gottlieb Georgi, who wrote a descrip-tion of Siberia.Ten years earlier Christoph Meiners had published a comprehensive es-say, “On the Mysteries of the Ancients, and in Par tic u lar on the Eleusian Secrets,” preceded by an introduction of a comparative nature, in which he distinguished mysteries celebrated by priests from mysteries tied to oral or written doctrines: in neither of the two cases could the phenomenon be con-sidered universal. It was unknown to the Samojedi, to the dwellers of Kam-chatka, to the Tartar hordes (about whom Meiners referred the reader to Gmelin), to Californians, to Eskimos, Laps, and Greenlanders. For all these peoples, Meiners observed, one cannot speak of a common religion or of na-tional gods, and neither of priests in a strict sense, but only of “charlatans and diviners” (Quacksalber und Wahrsager). Consequently, shamans, even if only evoked and not named directly, entered the religious history of human-ity consigned to its poorest and most elementary stage.4. Th us, thanks to the eastern expansion of the Rus sian empire, Eu ro pe ans discovered— or better, rediscovered— the shamans. It seems useful to stress the “rediscovery” aspect for two reasons. First of all, between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, scholars such as Caspar Peucer and John Scheff er had collected and transmitted data on the magicians of Lapland, who were closely related (as Meiners had perceptively discerned) to the Siberian shamans. Second, as I have tried to illustrate exhaustively elsewhere, an ancient shaman-istic nucleus was included in the well- established ste reo type of the witches’ Sabbath.Learning and rediscovering are complicated operations: perceptions and cultural schemes become intertwined and in turn modify one another. For the Seville physician Monardes, the priests of the Indios who begin to divine the future as they come out of the cataleptic fi ts induced by tobacco smoke"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 93 were inspired by the Dev il. A great scholar like Vossius thought he had recog-nized Pomponius Mela’s Th racians as tobacco smokers. Vossius certainly was mistaken (and Lafi tau also), but was absolutely correct to connect the passage in Pomponius Mela to the description of a Scythian rite in Herodotus:After the burial the Scythians cleanse themselves as I will show: they anoint and wash their heads; as for their bodies, they set up three poles leaning together to a point and cover these over with woollen mats; then in the place so enclosed to the best of their power, they make a pit in the centre beneath the poles and the mats and throw red- hot stones into it. Th ey have hemp growing in their country, very like fl ax, save that the hemp is by much the thicker and taller. Th is grows both of itself and also by their sowing, and of it the Th racians even make garments which are very like linen. . . . Th e Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and, creep-ing under these mats, they throw it on the red- hot stones; and, being so thrown, it smolders and sends forth so much steam that no Greek vapor- bath could sur-pass it. Th e Scythians howl in their delight at the vapor- bath. Th is serves them instead of bathing, for they never wash their bodies with water. (4:73– 75)Th e more or less identical texts from Maximus of Tyre, Pomponius Mela, and Solinus, the fi rst referring to the Scythians and the latter two to the Th racians, originate from this page in Herodotus— an important source for our investigation. To the best of my knowledge, the fi rst step toward its cor-rect identifi cation was taken by an antiquarian- naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651– 1716). Th e tables which accompany his observations accumulated dur-ing many years of travel—Amoenitatum Exoticarum politico- physico- medicarum fasciculi V— give an idea of Kaempfer’s boundless curiosity: we pass from a cuneiform inscription copied from the ruins of Persepolis to a remarkably ac-curate description of the points used by Japa nese acupuncturists to cure colic diarrhea. One of these notations (“Kheif seu Keif, sive inebriantia Persarum et Indorum”) discusses the properties and eff ects of tobacco, opium, and can-nabis, or bangue, which Kaempfer identifi es as the plant which by its smoke inebriated Scythians and Th racians.Th ese remarks seem to have passed unnoticed. At the end of the eigh teenth century another and no less extraordinary personage, Count Jan Potocki— author of Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse, a novel which achieved international renown thanks to a partial edition by Roger Caillois— independently reached similar conclusions. In a remarkable book published in St. Petersburg in 1802, the Histoire primitive des peuples de la Russie, Potocki accurately identifi ed some of the customs of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia mentioned in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94 . the eu ro pe ans discover the shamansbook 4 of Herodotus. In the Scythian seers he recognized at once “the sha-mans of Siberia.” He had not traced to the Tartars the custom of becoming drugged with the smoke of roasted hemp seeds; but he observed that hashish, which was very common in Cairo (where he spent some time in 1790), gives an intoxication diff ering from that caused by opium or fermented liquor, because it “tient davantage de la folie.”Th ese intuitions also passed unnoticed. In an essay presented in 1811 and then revised for publication in 1828, Barthold Georg Niebuhr with great fi nesse outlined the earliest history of the Scythians, Geti, and Sarmatians, reaching conclusions substantially similar to Potocki’s, but without mention-ing him, doubtless because he did not know his work. In the funerary ceremony described by Herodotus (4:73– 75), Niebuhr unequivocally saw a shamanistic ritual, giving further credence to his hypothesis (still discussed today) of a Mongolian origin for a segment of the Scythian population.It is no accident that Potocki and Niebuhr agreed on this point. In the course on Slavic literature that Adam Mick iewicz gave at the Collège de France in 1842– 1843, he stated that Potocki had been “the fi rst among historians of modern Eu rope to recognize the importance of oral tradition. Niebuhr que-ried peasants and old women in the Roman markets about the story of Romu-lus and Remus. Long before him, Potocki had sought out information about the Scythians in the tents of the Tartars.” And he concluded: Potocki trav-eled, he examined places, he spoke with people— things that no antiquarian had done before him.Mickiewicz was exaggerating. One only needs to think about the jour-neys undertaken toward the end of the seventeenth century by the antiquar-ian and naturalist Kaempfer. But Mickiewicz was certainly correct to em-phasize the importance of such a method, only resurrected in the last few de cades by students of ethnohistory. Karl Meuli pursued this approach in an essay published in 1935 (Scythica) which in a certain sense rediscovered, per-haps for the last time, the shamanistic connotations of the Scythian funerary rite described by Herodotus. I say “in a certain sense rediscovered” because in the thick notes to Scythica there is no mention of Kaempfer and Potocki, who, to a greater and lesser mea sure, had anticipated its basic thesis; however, the name of Niebuhr appears. Th is does not detract in any way from the origi-nality of Meuli’s excellent essay, which, for the fi rst time, analyzed in depth both the shamanistic elements in Scythian culture and their reception on the part of Greek colonists residing on the banks of the Black Sea."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the eu ro pe ans discover the shamans . 95Th e results of an archeological dig dating from a few years earlier in the Altai Mountains of Central Asia had already provided, unknown to Meuli, an unforeseeable confi rmation of the fi ndings of his essay. In a place called Pazyryk, tombs had been discovered, dating to two or three centuries before Christ, which had preserved, buried under the ice, a horse transformed to resemble a reindeer (today exhibited at the Hermitage); a drum of the kind used by shamans; and seeds of Cannabis sativa, some of which were preserved in a leather fl ask, others roasted among the pebbles in a small bronze bowl.5. Th is is how the advancement of knowledge always seems to occur: in stages rather than in a continuum; through false starts, corrections, forgot-ten facts, rediscoveries; and thanks to fi lters and schemas which contempora-neously blind and open our eyes. In this sense the attempts at interpretation which I have tried to reconstruct, perhaps too minutely, could be considered almost banal— not the exception but the rule."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"961. In the sixth of Voltaire’s Lettres philosophiques (1734, but written a few years earlier) we come upon a famous page:Enter the London Stock Exchange, that more respectable place than many a court; you will see the deputies of all nations gathered there for the ser vice of mankind. Th ere the Jew, the Mohammedan and the Christian deal together as if they were of the same religion, and apply the name of infi del only to those who go bankrupt; there the Presbyterian trusts the Anabaptist, and the Anglican ac-cepts the Quaker’s promise. On leaving these peaceful and free assemblies, some go to the synagogue, others go to drink; one goes to have himself baptized in a great basin in the name of the Father, through the Son, to the Holy Ghost; an-other has his son’s foreskin cut off and Hebrew words mumbled over him which he does not understand; others go to their church to await the inspiration of God, their hats on their heads, and all are content.Erich Auerbach dealt at length with this text in his great book (Mimesis, 1946). His analysis opened with a word of caution: Voltaire’s “description of the London exchange was not really written for a realistic purpose.” Th is is not an obvious statement, just as the notion of realism was not obvious to Auerbach. Among the many variants of realism studied in Mimesis we fi nd the modern form exemplifi ed by the novels of Balzac and Stendhal, in which individual events and experiences are interwoven with impersonal historical forces. One such force is international commerce, mentioned by Voltaire in his passage on the London Stock Exchange. Auerbach preferred, instead, to emphasize the intentionally deforming characteristics of a description which, CHAPTER 7Tolerance and CommerceAuerbach Reads Voltairefor adriano sofri"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 97by taking the details of the religious ceremonies out of their respective con-texts, makes something absurd and comical out of them. Th is is, Auerbach observes, “the searchlight device” (Scheinwer fer technik), typical of propaganda: “Especially in times of excited passions, the public is again and again taken in by such tricks, and everybody knows more than enough examples from the very recent past. . . . Whenever a specifi c form of life or a social group has run its course or has only lost favor and support, every injustice which the propa-gandists perpetrate against it is half consciously felt to be what it actually is, yet people welcome it with sadistic delight.” Th is implicit allusion to Nazism crops up again immediately afterward in a bitter and ironic observation: “[Gottfried] Keller was fortunate in that he could not imagine an important change in government which would not en-tail an expansion of freedom.” Mimesis, Auerbach wrote retrospectively, “is a book written in total awareness by a resolute man, in a determinate situa-tion, at the beginning of the forties at Istanbul.” With these words Auer-bach was reiterating his own adherence to the critical considerations which he had worked out in refl ecting on Vico’s Scienza Nuova.More than fi fty years have passed since the publication of Mimesis. Th e voice of Voltaire on the page discussed by Auerbach rings out today more powerfully than ever. But to really understand it we need to apply a twofold, bifocal perspective, taking into consideration both Voltaire and his most as-tute reader.2. Th e wordplay over infi dèle, together with Voltaire’s treatment of the London Stock Exchange, could have been inspired by that famous tribute to Amster-dam’s intellectual and religious liberty contained in the fi nal chapter of Spi-noza’s Tr a c t a t u s t h e o l o g i c o - p o l i t i c u s (1670): “Take, for example, the city of Am-sterdam, that to its great advantage and the admiration of all people enjoys the fruits of this freedom. In this fl ourishing state, in this city without equals, men of all backgrounds and of all sects cohabit in the greatest harmony, and before entrusting their property to someone want to know only if he be rich or poor, or if he is accustomed to act in good or bad faith [num bona fi de, an dolo solitus sit agere].” Th e last few words, in the anonymous French translation of the Tr a c t a -tus published in 1678, which circulated with three diff erent title pages, closely echo the original Latin: “S’il est homme de bonne foy ou accoûtumé à tromper.”In Spinoza’s writings, the word fi d e s has, depending on the context, diff er-ent meanings, religious and not: credulity, prejudice, piety, loyalty, and so"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98 . auerbach reads voltaireforth. Th e transition from the religious to the po liti cal sphere is explicit in the fi nal chapter of the Tr a c t a t u s t h e o l o g i c o - p o l i t i c u s : “Finally, if we take into account the fact that the devotion of a man toward the State, like the one to-ward God, can be known only through actions [Quod si denique ad hoc etiam attendamus, quod fi des uniuscujusque erga rempublicam, sicuti erga Deum, ex solis operibus cognosci potest].” In these words we hear the echo of one of Spinoza’s favorite writers. In his Discorsi sopra la prima Deca di Tito Livio, Machiavelli had argued that a well- ordered republic requires a religious anchor, a civic religion comparable to that of ancient Rome. But to Spinoza, in his praise of Amster-dam and its liberties, fi d e s— more precisely, the juridical notion of “bona fi des”— meant commercial trustworthiness. Th us, he appears to have paved the way for Voltaire’s quip about bankruptcy as a form of faithlessness. It reappears, transformed into a solemn declaration, on American banknotes: “In God we trust.”Th e comparison between the praise of Amsterdam and the description of the London Stock Exchange reinforces the hypothesis, already formulated but on a wholly diff erent basis, that Voltaire might have known Spinoza’s Tr a c-tatus theologico- politicus before publishing the Lettres philosophiques. However, the tone of the two passages diff ers. For Spinoza, Amsterdam was the living demonstration that freedom of thought is not dangerous politically— in fact, contributes to general happiness through commercial prosperity. For his part, Voltaire, more than a half century later, imparted the idea that in London, commercial prosperity had made religious diff erences wholly irrelevant. In the historical battle between reason and religious intolerance, for him, En gland was a model:Come then! Is it only in En glandTh at mortals dare to think?Quoi, N’est- ce donc qu’en AngleterreQue les mortels osent penser?Th ese verses, which distorted the meaning of a passage from Horace (Ep. I, 2, 40, ad Lollium), transforming the “being wise” into “thinking,” are parts of a poem which Voltaire had written at the death of the actress Adrienne Lecouvreur. A half century later, Kant chose the same words of Horace, in the same deformed interpretation, for his famous defi nition of the Enlight-enment: “Sapere aude!”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 993. To express his sense of the irrelevance of religious diff erences Voltaire resorted to estrangement (st raniame nto), a literary pro cess which transformed something familiar— an object, a behavior, an institution— into something strange, senseless, ridiculous. Viktor Sklovskij, who was the fi rst to identify and analyze this literary device, noted that the philosophes had used it fre-quently. In the Lettres philosophiques we encounter it everywhere. Th is is how Voltaire describes, in the fi rst letter, his meeting with an unnamed Quaker: “Th ere was more courtesy in the open and humane physiognomy of his coun-tenance than there is in the fashion of dragging one leg after another and of carry ing in one’s hand what is intended to cover one’s head.”With laborious, deliberately clumsy circumlocution, Voltaire invites the reader to share the Quaker’s scorn for social conventions. A little later this scorn is extended to religious rites. “We are Christians,” he says, “and we try to be good Christians; but we do not hold that Christianity consists of sprinkling some cold water on one’s head, mixed with a little salt.”After baptism comes war. Relying on the same literary pro cess of estrange-ment, the Quaker describes, and condemns, military conscription: “Our God, who has ordered us to love our enemies and to suff er without complaining, certainly does not want us to traverse the seas to go and slit the throats of our brethren simply because some assassins dressed in red and sporting caps two feet tall are enrolling their citizens making noise beating two little sticks on some tightly stretched donkey skin.”Th e literary pro cess used by Voltaire builds on a long tradition going back to Marcus Aurelius. In his Meditations he spoke of the band worn by Ro-man senators: “Th is garment with its purple border is nothing but sheep’s wool impregnated by fi sh blood.” Voltaire similarly looked askance at social customs, reducing persons and events to their essential components. Soldiers are only “assassins dressed in red and sporting caps two feet tall”; instead of evoking a solemn rolling of drums, they make “noise beating two little sticks on some tightly stretched donkey skin.” Even the most obvious gestures be-come strange, opaque, absurd, as if they were observed through the eyes of an outsider, of a savage, or of an ignorant philosophe, as Voltaire defi ned himself in a later writing.But Voltaire’s model was En glish. In one of his Notebooks from the period of his London exile (1726– 1728), he slipped in a comparison which anticipated the nub of the sixth philosophical letter: “En gland is meeting of all religions,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"100 . auerbach reads voltaireas the Royal exchange is the rendezvous of all foreigners.” In another passage Voltaire penned, in his uncertain En glish, a more elaborate version of the same idea:Where there is not liberty of conscience, there is seldom liberty of trade, the same tyranny encroaching upon the commerce as upon Religion. In the Common-wealths and other free contrys one may see in a see port, as many relligions as shipps. Th e same god is there diff erently worship’d by jews, mahometans, hea-thens, catholiques, quackers, anabaptistes, which write strenuously one against another, but deal together freely and with trust and peace; like good players who after having humour’d their parts and fought one against another upon the stage, spend the rest of their time in drinking together.Th e title attached to this passage, A Tale of a Tub, has been called mis-leading by the modern editor of Voltaire’s Notebooks. Actually, the title tells us how the technique of estrangement was used in the evolution of the Lettres philosophiques. In A Tale of a Tub (1704) Jonathan Swift related, among many digressions, the story of three sons who fi ght over their father’s inheritance: a parable symbolizing the confl icts among the Church of Rome, the Church of En gland, and the Protestant dissenters. Even though he sharply castigated both Catholics and enthusiasts, Swift openly stated that the points of agree-ment among Christians were more important than their diff erences. In his Notebooks Voltaire went back to the source of Swift’s parable, to the story of the three rings which an el der ly father leaves to his sons: but he expanded the original reference to Christians, Jews, and Muslims to include pagans. In the fi nal version, set in the London Stock Exchange rather than a seaport, the pagans disappear and the deistic message becomes more attenuated. But Voltaire’s debt to Swift is greater still. A Tale of a Tub announced the immi-nent publication of other writings by its anonymous author, among which was “A Voyage into England, by a Person of Quality in Terra Australis incog-nita, Translated from the Original”— an idea that reappeared in reverse form in Gulliver’s Travels (1726). Without the Tr a v e l s Voltaire would never have be-come what he was. We can imagine the enthusiasm with which he read the inventory of objects in Gulliver’s pockets scrupulously recorded by two tiny inhabitants of Lilliput. Among these items we fi nd: “A great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out what-ever was at the end of that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal; for on the transparent side we saw certain strange fi gures circularly drawn. . . . He put this engine to our ears, which"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 101made an incessant noise like that of a watermill. And we conjectured it is ei-ther some unknown animal, or the god that he worships. . . .”Swift transforms an object of everyday life into something sacred; Vol-taire transforms a sacred event into something ordinary: “Celui- ci va se faire baptiser dans une grande cuve [this person goes to have himself baptized in a great basin].” In both cases we see the same strategy of turning the familiar into the unusual. Th e astonishment of the stranger destroys the aura generated by custom or reverence. No aura, instead, envelops the commercial transac-tions executed in the London Stock Exchange: their rationality is obvious.In that section of the Lettres philosophiques dealing with Swift (“Vingt- deuxième lettre: Sur M. Pope et quelques autres poètes fameux”), Gulliver’s Tr a v e l s is not mentioned. But in the expanded edition, published in 1756, Voltaire inserted a long passage on A Tale of a Tub, identifying its sources in the story of the three rings and in Fontenelle. He concluded: “Th us, almost everything is imitation. Th e idea of the Lettres persanes is taken from l’Espion turc. Boiardo imitated Pulci, Ariosto imitated Boiardo. Th e most original minds borrow from each other. . . . It is with books as with the fi re in our hearths; we go to a neighbor to get the embers and light it when we return home, pass it on to others, and it belongs to everyone.” A splendid masked confession.4. Auerbach probably had not read Sklovskij’s essay on estrangement. But the latter’s ideas, transmitted by Sergej Tret’ jakov, had a decisive infl uence on the work of Brecht, whom Auerbach certainly knew well. Brecht’s Ve r f r e m d u n g - Eff ekt, so profoundly linked to the Enlightenment tradition, recalls intimately the “searchlight device” used by Voltaire. Auerbach accentuates only the risks in that technique, not its critical potential— a surprisingly unilateral opinion. To be sure, artistic or literary procedures are only instruments, which can be used for diff erent or even opposed purposes. A weapon (and even estrange-ment is a weapon) can be used to kill a child or to prevent a child from being killed. But if we examine from close up the function of estrangement in the writings of Voltaire, we notice something more complicated which sheds greater light on the description of the London Stock Exchange and, indi-rectly, on how Auerbach read it.Th e publication of the Lettres philosophiques (1734) coincided with the editing of the Traité de métaphysique, revised until the year 1738. In this unfi nished work, not destined for the public and printed only after his death,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"102 . auerbach reads voltaireVoltaire explored in depth the destructive eff ects of the unfriendly look he had cast on En glish societ y. In the introduction (“Doubts over man”), he wrote: “Few people have a broad view of what a man is. Peasants of one part of Eu rope have no other idea of our species except of a two- legged animal with gnarled skin, mumbling a few words, tilling the land, paying, without knowing why, certain tribute to another animal whom they call king, selling their produce as dearly as they can, and coming together certain days of the year to sing prayers in a language they do not understand.”Voltaire dared to publish this passage only thirty years later, in a more developed form, in the pseudonymous Philosophie de l’histoire, later reprinted as the introduction to the Essai sur les mœurs. In the new version the unsym-pathetic description of French society was attributed, certainly more plausi-bly, to Voltaire himself. In the Traité de métaphysique, instead, the point of view of the peasants introduced in rapid succession the equally one- sided positions of a king, a young Pa ri sian, a young Turk, a priest, and a phi los o pher. To tran-scend these limited attitudes, Voltaire imagined a being descended from space: an invention, reminiscent of Swift, later brought back in Micromégas. Having set out to search for man, the traveler sees “monkeys, elephants, ne-groes who all seem to have some glimmer of imperfect reason.” Based on these experiences he declares: “Man is a black animal with wool on his head, who walks on two feet, almost as straight as a monkey, but not as strong as other animals of his size, with a few more ideas than they, and with greater facility expressing them; he is subjected to all the same necessities, he is born, lives and dies just like them.”Th e innocence of the traveler who has come from space on the one hand leads him to fall into ridiculous generalization but on the other, because of an ambivalence dear to Voltaire, allows him to perceive an emphatic truth: human beings are animals. Little by little the traveler discovers that those be-ings belong to diff erent species, each one of in de pen dent origin and holding a precise place in the grand hierarchy of the cosmos: “Finally, I see men who seem superior to negroes, just like negroes are superior to monkeys, and mon-keys are superior to ostriches and to other animals of the same species.”To underline the diversity among the human species Voltaire compares them to diff erent types of trees. Twenty years later, this analogy was resur-rected and further developed in the Essai sur les mœurs (chap. 114). Once again blacks were prominent in Voltaire’s thought:"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 103Th e mucous membrane of negroes, which is black, and is the cause of their color, proves in an obvious manner that in every human species, as in plants, there is a diff erentiating principle.To this principle nature has subordinated the diff erent degrees of spirit (gé-nie) and those national characteristics which one sees change so rarely. Th at is the reason why negroes are the slaves of other men. Th ey are bought on the Afri-can coasts like animals, and the mass of these blacks, transplanted into our American colonies, serve a very small number of Eu ro pe ans.Voltaire thought that human history had developed within the hierarchy made up of the various human species— today we would say of races. Even if the words racism and racist did not exist then, to ask ourselves (as we have done so often) whether Voltaire was or was not a racist seems absolutely proper. It seems useful, however, to begin by distinguishing between racism broadly construed and racism in a narrow sense. Th e former holds that (a) the human races exist and (b) the human races are arranged in a hierarchical scale. Th e latter, racism in a narrow sense, besides subscribing to (a) and (b), sustains that (c) the hierarchy between the races cannot be modifi ed either by educa-tion or by culture. Voltaire, who was undoubtedly a racist in the broad sense, never fully adhered to racism in the narrow sense, but he came very close to it whenever he had to speak of blacks. “Th e vast majority of negroes, and all the kaffi rs, are thrust deeply in the same stupidity,” he wrote in the Philosophie de l’histoire. A few years later, in 1775, he added: “And they will rot there for a long time.”5. Voltaire’s attitude about race, and more specifi cally about blacks, was largely shared by the philosophes. But a personal circumstance may have contributed to exacerbate it. From his youth he had invested large sums in a company which traded with the “Indies,” deeply involved in the slave trade. Vo l t a i r e , who, as we know, had a great aptitude for business, was certainly aware of this. And, in any case, the commerce in slaves was an important element in that economic system whose praises he sang in the short poem Le mondain (fol-lowed by the Défense du mondain ou l’apologie du luxe, 1736):Le superfl u, chose très nécessaire,A réuni l’un et l’autre hémisphère.Voyez- vous pas ces agiles vaisseaux.Qui du Texel, de Londres, de Bordeaux,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"104 . auerbach reads voltaireS’en vont chercher, par un heureux échange,Des nouveaux biens, nés aux sources du Gange,Tandis qu’au loin, vainqueurs des musulmans,Nos vins de France enivrent les sultans.Th e frivolous tone of this rococo poem stands out against the gravity of its content. One of the wares which had contributed to join the two hemi-spheres was the “black animals” sold as slaves. Luxury stimulates progress, Bernard Mandev ille had explained in his Th e Fable of the Bees. But his para-doxical assumption that private vices generate public virtues only applied to the Eu ro pe an states. Th at earthly paradise evoked by Voltaire in the eu-phoric conclusion of his Mondain (“Th e earthly paradise is where I am”) was the fruit of the systematic sacking of the world.6. Th e eighteenth- century origin of later racist ideologies, although often remote, is unquestioned. I do not accept, however, the connection Auerbach suggests between Voltaire and Nazi propaganda. To be sure, we cannot ex-clude that Auerbach may have felt himself personally off ended by Voltaire’s sarcastic comment on Jewish rites. Nazi persecution had turned Auerbach into a Jew and an exile.Marvell’s verse quoted in Mimesis (“Had we world enough and time . . .”) refers ironically to the historical and geo graph i cal limitations which had con-ditioned the book’s genesis. Th e irony concealed another, one even more bitter: Marvell goes on assuring his reluctant lover that she may resist him, if she so desires, “till the conversion of the Jews.”  But the impatience, as well as admi-ration, which Auerbach felt toward Voltaire had broader implications.Near the beginning of his exile in Istanbul, Auerbach wrote letters to Walter Benjamin, with whom he was obviously on friendly terms. In one of them, dated 3 January 1937, Auerbach related his fi rst Turkish impres-sions: “Th e result [of the politics of Kemal Atatürk] is a nationalism fa-natically hostile to tradition; a rejection of the entire Muslim cultural in-heritance; the construction of an imaginary relationship with an earlier Turkish identity; and technological modernization in a Eu ro pe an sense. . . . Th e result is an extreme nationalism, accompanied by the simultaneous destruction of the national historical character. Th is situation, which in countries such as Germany, Italy, and even Rus sia (?) is not visible to all, here is fully evident.”"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 105Auerbach followed this with a prediction: “For me it becomes ever clearer that the present international situation is nothing other than the cunning of providence, intended to bring us by a tortuous and bloody path toward an internationalism of trivialities and a cultural Esperanto. A suspicion of the kind had already come to me in Germany and in Italy, seeing the terrible dishonesty in the slogan of ‘blood and native soil’: but only here did the evi-dence of such a turn seem almost certain.” Th e nationalist dictatorships (the term “Rus sia,” even if followed by a question mark, is symptomatic) were thus a stage in a historical pro cess which would end up erasing all specifi c traits, including the national, arriving at the affi rmation of one undiff erentiated civilization on a world stage. Th is paradoxical trajectory suggested to Auerbach the expression “the cunning of providence”— a phrase inspired by a saying of Croce’s, which combined Vico’s providence with Hegel’s cunning of reason. Auerbach did not doubt that this pro cess would signal a great loss culturally. Th e same concern re-emerges, after the end of World War II, in the essay “Philologie und Welt-literatur” (1952). Th e cold war, which had separated the world into two op-posed but profoundly similar models, tended to produce a standardization, a uniformity, a loss of diversity which debilitated all individual and national traditions.Th e evident continuity between the 1937 letter to Benjamin and the 1952 essay sheds light on a chronologically intermediate text: the chapter in Mimesis which analyzes Voltaire’s passage on the London Stock Exchange. Th ere Auerbach found an anticipation of a culturally homogeneous mass so-ciety, regulated by the rational laws of the market. In spite of their enormous diff erences, the Enlightenment and Nazism seemed to him as stages in a long- drawn- out historical pro cess which would reduce individual aspects (religious or other types) to various and unimportant elements before canceling them out altogether.A similar thesis had been suggested by Max Horkheimer and Th eodor Adorno in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947, but written in 1944). Auer-bach’s sketchy notes in his letter to Benjamin cannot be compared to the well- developed comprehensive discussion of Adorno and Horkheimer in their “phil-osophical fragments.” But it is not diffi cult to imagine a dialogue on the ambivalence of the Enlightenment between exiles in Istanbul and Santa Mon-ica in the early 1940s."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"106 . auerbach reads voltaire7. Th is ambivalence stands out at the very outset, in the introduction to the Dialectic of the Enlightenment. “Th e critique of enlightenment” [in the fi rst es-say], write the two authors, “is intended to prepare a positive concept of en-lightenment which liberates it from its entanglement in blind domination.” In the course of the book this positive notion of enlightenment, through dia-lectical contortion, reveals itself to be based on denial: “Not the good but the bad is the subject matter of theory. . . . Its element is freedom, its theme op-pression. Where language grows apologetic, it is already corrupted. . . . Th ere is only one expression for truth: the thought which repudiates injustice.”It is Voltaire, who has incarnated this thought, to whom the two writers forlornly turn: “You have trumpeted the scandal of tyranny eloquently, tearfully, sarcastically, thunderously; but the good that power has brought about— on that you have kept silent.”  But as we know, the author of the Tr e a -tise on Tolerance shared with the great majority of his contemporaries a number of attitudes, especially on the question of the human races, which promoted injustice rather than denied it. Th ere is no point in repeating the commonplace on the historical limits of a movement preeminently male, white, and Eu ro-pe an born. But that the Enlightenment is dead is not at all certain. Th e intel-lectual biography of Voltaire, the very symbol of the Enlightenment, reveals the wealth and complexity of the contradictions pointed out by Horkheimer and Adorno.8. For Voltaire the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 marked an epochal turning point. Th e destruction of an entire city and the death of countless inno-cents compelled him to confront the problem of evil. In the Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ou examen de cet axiome: Tout est bien, written shortly after the event, Voltaire looked upon the entire world as an endless chain of horrors:Animal, human elements, everything is at war.It has to be admitted, evil is over the land:Its secret principle is not known at all.Éléments, animaux, humain, tout est en guerre.il le faut avouer, le mal est sur la terre:Son principe secret ne nous est point connu.Voltaire looked for this “secret principle” in the work of Bayle, who had refl ected in depth, but uselessly, on the question of evil. Even Bayle did not"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 107have an answer. Voltaire rejected Pope’s maxim “All is well” and his own past philosophy: “Wise men mislead me, and God alone is correct [Les sages me trompaient, et Dieu seul a raison].”To be sure, Voltaire was not a great poet. But his uninspired verses on the Lisbon earthquake express a real involvement in the tragedy, one more intel-lectual than emotional. In the preface (1756) and especially in the postscrip-tum, Voltaire expressed himself more cautiously: “Unfortunately, it is always necessary to take note that the objections which an author directs at himself have to be distinguished from his response to the objections.” But his men-tal bent had changed profoundly. A passage from an earlier writing shows to what extent he had felt “betrayed”: “As for the injustice and cruelty which we blame on God, I answer fi rst of all that, even supposing that a moral evil ex-ists (which to me seems like an illusion), this evil is just as unexplainable in a system based on matter as in one based on a God.”Cruelty and injustice are in fact purely human concepts: “We have no other notions of justice except those we have concocted ourselves, of an action useful to society, in conformity to the laws which we have ourselves estab-lished for the common good; but since this idea is connected only to relations among men it cannot have any analogy with God. In this sense, to say God is just or unjust is just as absurd as to say he is blue or square. It is thus sense-less to reproach God because fl ies are eaten by spiders. . . .”Th is passage can be read in the Traité de metaphysique. When Voltaire wrote it he was forty, healthy, happy, wholly consumed by his romantic idyll with Madame du Châtelet. Evil for him simply did not exist. Old age, as Vol-taire himself recognized in the Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne, had contrib-uted to his intellectual conversion.In a less lugubrious tone I could be seen in the pastSinging of sweet pleasures the seductive laws;Of other times, of other customs: instructed by old age,I share the weakness of the humans who have been led astray, I seek a light in a dark night,I know only to suff er, and not to grumble.Sur un ton moins lugubre on me vit autrefoisChanter des doux plaisirs les séduisantes lois;D’autres temps, d’autres mœurs: instruit par la vieillesse, des humains égarés partageant la faiblesse,Dans une épaisse nuit cherchant à m’éclairerJe ne sais que souff rir, et non pas murmurer."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"108 . auerbach reads voltaireHere Voltaire was alluding to two small works he wrote immediately af-ter the Traité de metaphysique: Le mondain (mentioned above) and his apologia, La défense du mondain. In the Défense, Voltaire quarreled with an imaginary critic of Le mondain, reminding him that the luxury in which he lived was made possible by global commerce. Silver was one of the items thus traded:Th is refi ned silver, embossed, ribbed,Transformed into plates, vases, saucers,Was extracted from the depths of the earthIn the Potosi, in the heart of the New World.Cet argent fi n, ciselé, godronné,En plats, en vase, en soucoupe tourné,Fut arraché dans la terre profondeDans le Potose, au sein d ’un Nouveau Monde.And freed from care, Voltaire concluded: “Th e entire universe has labored for you. [Tout l’univers a travaillé pour vous].” No human agent appeared in these youthful verses. Th e years passed. In the Essai sur les mœurs (c h a p. 14 8) Voltaire spoke of the mines in Peru less impersonally, and with a greater sense of anguish, alluding to “Negroes, purchased in Africa and transported to Peru like animals condemned to human servitude,” to be thrown in with the na-tives already laboring in the mines.Th is passage might be dated to the early months of 1756, when Voltaire was penning his fi nal additions to the Essai sur les mœurs and to the Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne. An addition to the 1761 printing of the Essai sur les mœurs (chap. 152) is further testimony to this change of heart. We see emerging a much more compassionate attitude toward the slaves and their suff erings:In 1757 in French San Domingo the population totaled about thirty thousand, plus a hundred thousand negro and mulatto slaves who worked in the sugar refi n-eries and plantations of indigo and cocoa, cutting short their lives to satisfy our newly acquired appetites and necessities unknown to our forebears. We go to purchase those negroes on the Guinea coast, on the Gold coast, on the Ivory coast. Th irty years ago one could purchase a good- looking negro for fi fty livres, more or less a fi fth of what one pays for a fat cow. . . . We tell them that they are men like us, redeemed by the blood of a God who died for them, and then we make them work like beasts of burden, but feed them less well; if they try to fl ee, we cut off a limb; we force them to turn by the strength of their arms the shafts of the sugar mills, after we have fi tted them out with a wooden leg. After all this we dare to talk of human rights! . . . Th is commerce does not enrich a state; on the contrary, it destroys human lives, causes shipwrecks, and without doubt is not a true good;"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 109but since men have created new necessities for themselves; France purchases at great cost from abroad the superfl uous converted to a necessity.Th e fi nal words echo a verse in Le mondain written almost forty years earlier: “the superfl uous, a very necessary thing. . . .” Voltaire was quoting him-self consciously and perhaps not without a touch of irony. As a younger man he had euphorically embraced the world just as it was; growing older, he had ended up accepting pain and suff ering as part of the human condition. But as La Rochefoucauld wrote, “we are all strong enough to bear the suff erings of others.” Slavery was the answer to new desires, to new needs: it was, in the fi nal analysis, Voltaire seemed to suggest, a cruel but inevitable consequence of progress.9. Th e 1755 Lisbon earthquake had an even more profound eff ect on Voltaire. Th e rejection of necessity (including the necessity of evil) brought him, not al-ways coherently, to eliminate the idea of the great chain of being which had been argued eloquently by Pope in his Essay on Man. “Th ere probably is an im-mense divide between man and beast, between man and superior substances,” Voltaire wrote in a note to the Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne. But even this feeble anthropocentrism would collapse in the end.“I would trade the forty- nine guests I had for dinner to have had you in-stead,” Voltaire wrote to d’Alembert on 18 October 1760. Th e latter replied jokingly, comparing the meals at Ferney to the London Stock Exchange as Voltaire had described it: the Jesuit, the Jansenist, the Catholic, the Socin-ian, the Quaker, and the encyclopedist met to embrace and laugh together. But some participated in these repasts not to eat but to be eaten. Some years later (1763) Voltaire chose to give them a voice in the Dialogue du chapon et de la poularde. In a few apparently lighthearted pages, a pullet and a capon confi de in one another: they have been neutered. Th e more worldly capon informs the more ingenuous pullet what awaits them: they will be killed, cooked, and eaten. Th e sous- chef arrives; the pullet and the capon say their farewells.Animal dialogues are a genre dating back to Greek and Roman antiquity. Generally these writings have didactic purposes: the humanized voices of animals impart a moral lesson to humans. Voltaire began from this tradition but elaborated on it, once again using the doctrine of estrangement. Th e dia-logue format allowed him to dispense with the external observer. He was not"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"110 . auerbach reads voltaireobliged to make this choice. In the Galimatias dramatique, written in 1757 and published in 1765, a Jesuit, a Jansenist, a Quaker, an Anglican, a Lutheran, a Puritan, and a Muslim strike up a theological discussion which recalls the description of the London Stock Exchange. Th e role of the distant and rea-sonable observer is entrusted not to the narrator but to a Chinese, who has the last word: these Eu ro pe ans are all mad and should be locked up in an asylum. In the Dialogue du chapon et de la poularde, instead, the estrange-ment is assigned to the voice of the two protagonists.But protagonists is the wrong word. Th e two animals are victims: they do not act but suff er. To the capon who asks her why she is so sad, the pullet replies by describing in minute detail the cruel operation to which she had been subjected: “An accursed servant took me over her knees, stuck a long needle in my rectum, seized my womb, twirled it around the needle, ripped it out and gave it to her cat to eat.” Can the desire to be nourished with delicious foods justify such terrible mutilation? Voltaire forces the reader to ponder this question. A custom (the consumption of poultry), which most of us consider commonplace, is suddenly made abhorrent; the intellectual disjunction creates the premise for an unex-pected emotional identifi cation. Th e capon, while accusing human beings, observes that certain enlightened spirits have prohibited the consumption of animal fl esh: Indian Brahmins, Pythagoras, and the neo- Platonic phi los o-pher Porphyry. Porphyry’s De abstinentia was translated into French with the title Tr a i t é . . . touchant l’abstinence de la chair des animaux (1747). Voltaire owned a copy and marked up a number of pages. But even more important and closer to the spirit of the Dialogue du chapon et de la poularde is a pre-viously unidentifi ed source: Th e Fable of the Bees, by Bernard Mandev ille. One of the notes, designated by the letter “P,” includes a fable which in-spired Voltaire’s Le Marseillois et le lion (1768). Commenting on the fable, Mandev ille alluded to the practice of castrating animals to render the fl esh more tender, and in emotional tones described the killing of a steer: “. . . as soon as the wide wound is made, and the jugular is cut asunder, what mor-tal can without compassion hear the painful bellowings intercepted by his blood?”In his youth Mandev ille had received a medical degree and had practiced for a few years. In this period he wrote a short work, De brutorum operationi-bus (1690), in which he argued, following Descartes, that, since animals lack souls, they are machines. Th e conclusion of note “P” in Th e Fable of the Bees"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 111reads like a true recantation: “When a creature has given such convincing and undeniable proofs of the terrors upon him, and the pains and agonies he feels, is there a follower of Descartes so inur’d to blood, as not to refute, by his commiseration, the philosophy of that vain reasoner?”Voltaire’s capon echoes Mandev ille: “In eff ect, my dear pullet, would it not be an aff ront to the divine to affi rm that we have senses that do not feel, and a brain that does not think? Th is fantasy, worthy of a madman by the name of Descartes, might it not be the height of the ridiculous and a useless justifi cation of the barbaric?”Th e Dialogue du chapon et de la poularde, more than an exhortation to vegetarianism, seems a refl ection on the possibility of expanding the limits of toleration to the point of including animals (or at least some of them). Th us, even more striking is Voltaire’s attack, through the mouth of the pul-let, against Jews. Resurrecting one of his favorite themes, although without recourse, as elsewhere, to distorted biblical allusions, Voltaire accuses Jews of cannibalism: “It is proper that the representatives of such a perverse spe-cies should devour one another, and that the earth should be purged of that race.”Words like species and race suggest a certain distance between the pullet and Voltaire, who usually speaks of Jews as a “people.” Even innocent vic-tims, Voltaire seems to be suggesting ironically, are not free of prejudices. Th e capon defi nes men as “those animals who are bipeds like us and are very inferior to us because they lack feathers.” Th e capon and the pullet share the prejudices of their persecutors— something that renders them at once both ridiculous and familiar. At the end of the dialogue the capon, who has spo-ken scornfully of Christians for their cruel alimentary customs, dies utter-ing the words of Jesus: “Agh! I am being seized by the neck. Let us forgive our enemies.”Certainly, the allusion is free of blasphemous intentions. Th e suff ering servant, taken as a model by Jesus, is compared to an innocent lamb being led to slaughter (Isa. 53:7). For the vast majority of people, the suff erings of ani-mals appear insignifi cant compared to the suff erings of humans. But many cultures make reference to animals to express condemnation of the killing of innocent human beings.10. In 1772 Voltaire wrote a “diatribe” with the title Il faut prendre un parti ou le principe d’action. He was seventy- eight years old at the time. Once more he"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 . auerbach reads voltairewas returning to questions over which he had refl ected obsessively all his long life: God, evil, toleration. Voltaire spoke of the Eternal Being, of the eternal laws of nature to which every living being is subject. He described the world as a scene of mutual extinction: “All animals massacre one an-other reciprocally, impelled by an irresistible impulse. Th ere is no animal that does not have his par tic u lar prey, and who, to capture it, does not recur to something resembling the cunning and the fury with which the hateful spider attracts and devours the innocent fl y. A herd of sheep at pasture de-vours in an hour more insects than there are humans who inhabit the earth.” Th is slaughter, Voltaire noted, is part of nature’s plan: “Th ese victims die only after nature has provided to replace them. Everything is born again for the murder.”Th is passage made an unforgettable impression on a contemporary reader, the Marquis de Sade. In his celebrated pamphlet Français, encore un eff ort si vous voulez être républicains, Sade argued that assassination is perfectly nor-mal behavior, since in the natural world it exists everywhere. Vo l t a i r e h a d reached a diff erent conclusion. He used words dictated by compassion such as victims and assassination and gave them greater emphasis by condemning the carnivorous customs of humans: “What can there be more abominable than to continually nourish oneself from cadavers?”From the suff erings of animals Voltaire passed to the suff erings of human beings. Evil exists: wars, diseases, earthquakes prove it. Th e principle “All is well” is absurd. Is the Supreme Being thus responsible for evil? In Il faut prendre un parti this is discussed by an atheist, a Manichean, a pagan, a Jew, a Turk, a theist, and a citizen. How each of the various interlocutors presents himself reveals Voltaire’s attitudes toward them. For the arguments of the atheist he feels respect, but it is the theist who speaks for him, who explains that evil results from the distance between the creator and his creatures— an unsatisfactory argument, as Voltaire himself concedes. Th e theist ridicules all religions and criticizes the Jews especially: “Th e kaffi rs, the Hottentots, the negroes of Guinea are much more reasonable and honest than Jews. You [ Jews] have surpassed all people with your shameless fables, with your bad behavior, your barbarisms; for all this you bear the punishment, it is your destiny.”Th e Turk, instead, is praised for his tolerance: “Above all, continue to be tolerant: it is the true way to please the Being of Beings, who is the Father of"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"auerbach reads voltaire . 113the Turks and of the Rus sians, of the Chinese and of the Japa nese, of the blacks, of the red and yellow skins, of nature in its entirety.”Th e brusque passage from intolerance (toward Jews) to tolerance (toward all others, at least in theory) reveals a profound incoherence in the thought of Voltaire. His God may have been indiff erent to skin color; Voltaire him-self often was not. In general, he was not a rigorous thinker. But this inabil-ity to live up to the universal principles of the Enlightenment was not Voltaire’s problem alone. Th e Enlightenment, as has often been said, is an unfi nished aff air. At the conclusion of Il faut prendre un parti the citizen looks forward to tolerance, expanding its pa ram e ters to include (even if facetiously) the animal realm: “In all the discussions which will take place, it is explicitly forbidden to call someone a dog, even in a paroxysm of anger, unless that is we treat dogs as humans, when they steal our dinners, or bite us, and so forth.”In the tolerant society described in Il faut prendre un parti women are not even mentioned. It may be that this omission, just like the attitude toward slaves, has to be attributed to the historical limitations of the Enlightenment, and as such should be distinguished from its ideal legacy. We can ask our-selves if this legacy can be realized, if its realization is even desirable. As we have seen, Auerbach responded affi rmatively to the fi rst question, negatively to the second.11. Th e reopening of the New York Stock Exchange a few days after the at-tack on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center demonstrated (Adriano Sofri pointed this out to me) how extraordinarily contemporary was Voltaire’s discussion of the London Stock Exchange. Th e rationality and universality of the fi nancial markets have been contrasted to the sectarian fanat i cism of the religious fundamentalists— something Voltaire would have applauded enthusiastically.Auerbach obviously would have reacted diff erently. He was accustomed to gaze into the distance and from a distance. In the bloody events which take place under our very eyes he would have discerned a stage in the tortuous journey destined by means of upheavals of every sort to impose a culturally homogeneous society over the entire world. In his eyes, intolerance (similar to the one of which he was victim) and tolerance both played a part, from opposite directions, in achieving the same result.

(His heroic dimensions will emerge only at the end of the novel.) Every slight detail that concerns him, including the mention of “the old volume” of the phi los o-pher Anacharsis read at boarding school at Rouen, has something awkward and stuff y about it. Flaubert imagines the story of Madame Bovary commenc-ing about the year 1835. At that date the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grèce, by Jean- Jacques Barthélemy, fi rst published in 1788, was still a best seller. In the span of a century it enjoyed about eighty editions, if we count the anthologies and the adaptations for young people. It was translated into En glish, Spanish, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, modern Greek, and even Armenian. By way of this extremely long book, generations of readers, young and old, learned about the history and antiquities of Greece. “Th e old volume” of Anacharsis, read by Charles Bovary in the long eve nings at school, was frayed from use. But for Flaubert it was also a relic from the past: testimony to a taste and a world gone forever.Enormous success was followed by oblivion.

Jean- Jacques Barthélemy was born in 1716 at Aubagne in Provence in a family of well- to- do merchants. He studied in the seminary but probably never seriously considered an ecclesiastical career; he always remained the abbé. A number of learned contributions brought him to the notice of anti-quarians. In 1753 he became the secretary of the Cabinet des Médailles. Th e following year he relinquished his position and left for Rome in the entou-rage of Étienne- François de Stainville, subsequently duke of Choiseul, who had been appointed the French ambassador.In Rome, where he spent three years, Barthélemy found a stimulating in-tellectual atmosphere. He met Johann Joachim Winckelmann and corre-sponded with him; became involved in the discussions provoked by the ar-cheological discoveries at Herculaneum; and began a piece of research, which he would publish a few years later, on the Nilotic mosaic of Palestrina. In this period he began to refl ect on a new project, one far removed from his usual erudite form of research. In his autobiographical reminiscences pub-lished a half century later, he described it in this way:I was in Italy and in the cities I visited I was more interested in their ancient splendor than in their contemporary state. I spontaneously went back to the century in which they disputed among themselves the glory of cultivating the sciences and the arts, and I thought that to report an extended journey in that country at the time of Leo X, would put before our eyes one of the most useful and interesting spectacles for the history of the human spirit. A summary de-scription should suffi ce to give the idea of it. A Frenchman crosses the Alps: in Pavia he meets Gerolamo Cardano. . . . In Parma he sees Correggio frescoing the cupola of the cathedral; in Mantua, Count Baldassar Castiglione. . . . In Ferrara he sees Ariosto. . . . In Florence, Machiavelli and the historians Guicciardini and Paolo Giovio. . . . in Rome, Michelangelo who is building St. Peter’s dome, and Raphael decorating the Vatican galleries. . . . In Naples he fi nds Talesio [sic], whom Bacon defi nes as the fi rst to restore philosophy, working to reconstruct the system of Parmenides; he fi nds Giordano Bruno, whom nature seems to have chosen as its interpreter. . . .Page after page Barthélemy spoke of this project, left unfi nished. Th e concept undoubtedly had been inspired by the Essai sur les mœurs (1760)— more specifi cally, from the chapter in which Voltaire contrasts the ephemeral hostilities among the Italian cities with the intellectual advances achieved in the sixteenth century. Barthélemy took this one step further and hypothe-sized that artistic and intellectual progress had been produced by the “ten-dency to emulation by the various states” into which Italy was divided— a"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"anacharsis interrogates the natives . 117thesis that would be taken up by J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi and Jacob Burckhardt. With Jules Michelet and Burckhardt, Barthélemy viewed in “this stupendous revolution [cette étonnante revolution] a fi rst, decisive step toward the modern world: “Because, after all, the century of Leo X was the harbinger of those which followed, and many of the geniuses who distin-guished themselves in various countries in the seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries owe much of their glory to what Italy had produced in earlier centuries.”Th e project was to take the form of a travel journal written by a French-man, a transparent alter ego of the writer. Th is narrative invention, vaguely inspired by Fénelon’s Aventures de Télémaque, tied the pre sen ta tion to a rela-tively circumscribed period of time. Th e imaginary French traveler, as we seem to gather from Barthélemy’s rather confused sketch, participated in the decoration of the Vatican Stanze worked on by Raphael between 1511 and 1514, and on the construction of the dome of St. Peter, which Michelangelo began in 1550; he saw Correggio, who was frescoing the ceiling of the Parma cathe-dral in 1526, and met Giordano Bruno in Naples about a half century later. All these events were compatible with the life of a person who was relatively long- lived. But Barthélemy did not hesitate to take liberties with the narrative constraints he had imposed on himself. Among Ariosto’s contemporaries, he included Petrarch, who had lived a century and a half earlier, and Tasso, born eleven years later. Th e former was there because his works were read and com-mented upon in the sixteenth century, and the latter because he had been in-spired by Ariosto: “In this same way,” Barthélemy commented, “we call the Nile both the source and the mouth.” Th is panorama of Italian sixteenth- century artistic and intellectual life would evoke, in a condensed form, a much longer historical pro cess. Th rough the description of his failed project Barthé-lemy may have infl uenced the synchronic pre sen ta tion of the Italian Re nais-sance proposed by Burckhardt in his famous Civilization of the Re nais sance in Italy.Barthélemy abandoned his project because he began to realize that his knowledge of the Italian Cinquecento was inadequate. So he transposed a similar narrative device to a historical period with which his erudite researches had made him more familiar: the Greece of the fourth century b.c.

But the passage just quoted sheds light on a more complicated experiment. For Barthé-lemy the tenuous romantic mechanism set in motion by the imaginary Scyth-ian traveler was a means, not an end. But what were the “minor circumstances which are not proper for a historian to mention,” recovered by the artifi ce of the narrative? A glance at the Vo y a g e provides a preliminary answer. In the third edition (1791), the fi rst volume recapitulates the po liti cal and military history of Greece. Th e six following volumes take a totally diff erent form. Th e exposition swarms with footnotes (twenty thousand, Barthélemy proudly proclaimed). Take a chapter at random, the twenty- fi fth: “Of the Homes and the Meals of Athenians” (Des maisons et des repas des Atheniens). Th e reader fi nds him-self before a minute description of a symposium in which the notes reference passages from Greek and, less often, Latin authors. Rarely, some modern writer may also be cited, such as Isaac Casaubon (for his commentary on Athenaeus) and Jacob Spon. Th e chapters of the Vo y a g e on religious cere-monies, on holidays, on the various places visited by Anacharsis are similarly constructed.Th ese were the subjects traditionally treated by antiquarians. In his memoirs Barthélemy asserted that he had made use especially of the great col-lection of Greek antiquities edited by Johann Frederik Gronovius: twelve folio volumes which contain, among other writings, treatises by Ubbo Emmius, Nicholas Cragius, and Johannes Meursius. Barthélemy was especially infl u-enced by Meursius, whose work was or ga nized thematically. To overcome the lacunae left by his pre de ces sors Barthélemy meticulously scrutinized every sort of text, including recently published inscriptions. Scores of minute tes-serae, based on a myriad of citations, were joined to form an enormous mo-saic: the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis.4. It would take some thirty years to complete the work. In a letter to his friend Madame du Deff and written on 18 February 1771, Barthélemy alluded"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"anacharsis interrogates the natives . 119bitterly to his decision, taken long before, in 1755, to follow the duke de Choi-seul to Rome, and to leave his position at the Cabinet des Médailles. From that time, he recounted, his obligations to the duke and to the duchess de Choiseul (to whom he was, respectively, protégé and gentleman- in- waiting, perhaps even lover) had prevented him from pursuing his true vocation, that of the scholar. A few months later, in December 1771, Louis XV, bowing to pressure from Madame du Barry, exiled the powerful duke de Choiseul to his estate at Chan-teloup, near Amboise. Not long afterward, Barthélemy, too, lost his position (and a large part of his stipend) as secretary general of the Swiss Guards. After some hesitation he decided to follow the duke and duchess into their rural exile: and for four years he resided with them in the isolated and tran-quil surroundings of Chanteloup.For the duke and duchess and their small court, Barthélemy, some time before, had written a mock- heroic poem entitled La Chanteloupée, ou la guerre des puces contre Mme L.[ouise] D.[duchesse] d.[e] Ch.[oiseul]. It would be pub-lished, with some embarrassment, only after his death. In year six of the Re-public a writing like this, testimony of the frivolity of the Ancien Régime, did not seem to merit being included among Barthélemy’s works. But the descrip-tion of the home of Dinias, a wealthy Athenian, included in the aforemen-tioned chapter 25 of the Vo y a g e , evokes a not too dissimilar situation. Ana-charsis asks the wife of Dinias, Lysistrata, permission to visit her residence:Her dressing table was fi rst to catch my attention. I noticed silver basins and pitchers, mirrors made of various materials, hair pins, curling irons (a), ribbons of many sizes to bind them, nets to catch them (b), yellow powders to dye them blonde (c), many sorts of bracelets and ear rings, boxes of rouge and of white make- up, and of black vapors to tinge the eyelashes; and what ever was needed to keep teeth polished (d). I was examining these objects carefully, and Dinias could not understand how they could be a novelty for a Scythian.Th e footnotes, set off by letters of the alphabet inside parentheses, cited Lucian, Homer, Hesychius, and even a gloss to Th eocritus: all passages used to construct a description of an Athenian boudoir of the fourth century b.c. which reads like a passage of rococo antiquarianism. Neither ancient nor eighteenth- century historians would have admitted the possibility of dis-cussing details of this kind: frivolous, irrelevant, and thus prohibited (inter-dits). But for Barthélemy the antiquarian it was obvious, instead, to dwell on aspects of what we would call today the material life, so prominent in the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis. Th e quizzical gaze of the ignorant traveler, the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"120 . anacharsis interrogates the nativesbarbarian Anacharsis, propels us toward the informed view of the antiquarian Barthélemy. Th e ingenuous division on which the fi ction hinges clears the way for the critical disjunction.5. Th e Vo y a g e is neither a systematic antiquarian treatise nor a historical nar-rative. Barthélemy followed a third way, combining fi ction and erudition. Th is choice must have been dictated in part by the surroundings in which he passed much of his life: an aristocratic ambience open to intellectual curiosi-ties of every type, dominated by the prepossessing fi gure of Marie Anne de Vichy- Chamrond, marquise du Deff and, an intimate friend of both the duch-ess de Choiseul and the abbé Barthélemy, with whom they corresponded al-most daily. In 1771, when Barthélemy unexpectedly unburdened himself in a letter to her concerning his relations with the duke and duchess de Choiseul (together with the request to destroy it which went unheeded), Madame du Deff and was seventy- four years old. Full of vitality, highly intelligent, she had been blind for more than two de cades. She judged people and books with utter in de pen dence. She considered “detestable” Les Scythes, the drama by Voltaire (with whom she probably had an aff air in her youth, and with whom she continued to correspond). When she was seventy- eight she was reading Jacques Necker’s Sur la législation et le commerce des grains. At eighty- one she wrote to Barthélemy, who had advised her to read William Robertson’s His-tory of America: “I am delivering a recantation on Robertson’s America. Of all the things I care nothing about, it is the most pleas ur able, the one that is best written, almost interesting.”In Madame du Deff and’s letters we frequently encounter similar thoughts. To the duchess de Choiseul she wrote: “I no longer know what to read. I can-not stand books on philosophy and ethics, histories appear to me to be long and boring romances about events which are not always true and, which, even if they were, often would not be more interesting. All that remains then is conversation, and I am content with this, because I do not have a choice; once in a while it is of good quality, but rarely.”Madame du Deff and had just read, or better, perused the twelve volumes of the Cléopatre by Gauthier de Costes (La Calprenède), published in the mid– seventeenth century. But in this interminable and, as she herself admitted, boring novel, she had found a few “absolutely beautiful” passages: the conver-sation between Agrippa and Artaman, the “moving” description of a battle between gladiators. Th e duchess de Choiseul and the abbé Barthélemy, re-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"anacharsis interrogates the natives . 121spectively forty and nineteen years younger than Madame du Deff and, had tastes that diff ered completely from hers where romances and books of history were concerned. Th e duchess de Choiseul, who found La Calprenède unbear-able, wrote to Madame du Deff and, contrasting to the despotic authority of Catherine of Rus sia, so highly praised by Voltaire, the humble but genuine glory (“the kind that sets the heart and the imagination ablaze”) earned by the Mar-quis Carlo Ginori, the man who had laid the foundations for Livorno’s prosper-ity: “Th ey speak to us of Catherine, and the Marquis Ginori is unknown!” Madame du Deff and, who was not interested in the history of Roman and Carthaginian navigation and was bored reading Robertson, was chided by Barthélemy: what she lacked, he said, was that solid knowledge of antiquity gained by reading Greek and Latin writers.Th e exploits of those people [Romans and Carthaginians] are peaceful but excit-ing: and excitement attracts attention and interest. We are talking, it is true, of a tranquil interest: so much the better, because according to M. de Bucq happiness is nothing other than a calm interest. To witness the Romans and Carthagin-ians, the Spanish and the Portuguese crossing the seas to discover new lands seems to me preferable to seeing the factions of Guelfs and Ghibellines or of the Red Rose [House of Lancaster] and the White Rose [House of York] who put everything to the torch to conquer people who would have gladly done without them.Th e contrast between the passions and the interests, in both a psychologi-cal and economic sense, which emerged at the end of the seventeenth century had become, in the course of the eigh teenth, a fundamental theme in po liti-cal philosophy. Barthélemy’s words show that the same contrast had mate-rialized, even if not so openly, in the historiographical domain. Th e polemi-cal allusion to the War of the Roses probably concerned the Histoire de la rivalité de la France et de l’Angleterre, by Gabriel Henri Gaillard (1771), a book which Madame du Deff and had greatly liked. Gaillard spoke of wars and internecine confl icts to argue that the Eu ro pe an states wanted peace: “Eu rope is civilized, Eu rope believes itself to be enlightened, and yet it makes war! We have rushed to applaud the Eu rope of the Enlightenment, but Eu rope is still barbaric!” Barthélemy agreed, but Gaillard ’s Histoire left him unmoved. Historians were beginning to learn to speak about peaceful activities, about the commerce which had achieved for Eu rope supremacy over the rest of the world: but it was a genre making slow progress. To describe the peace-ful occupations of the men and women who lived in Greece in the fourth"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"122 . anacharsis interrogates the nativescentury b.c., Barthélemy took his inspiration not from historians but from antiquarians, true as well as false.6. In 1789 the Monthly Review discussed the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis. Th e assessment, which was basically favorable, closed with a poisonous insinua-tion: could Barthélemy have taken his cue from the Athenian Letters? It was an exceedingly cryptic allusion. Under this title there had appeared in Cam-bridge in 1741 an edition of apocryphal correspondence, virtually a private printing consisting of only twelve copies and lacking the author’s name. In this collection a Persian spy by the name of Cleander and his correspondents exchanged detailed information about Greece in the age of Pericles, Egypt, and Persia. Cleander described his meetings with Herodotus, with Socrates, with Aspasia; he discussed the theater and philosophy and religion; he juxta-posed the po liti cal liberty and commercial vitality of Athens to the despo-tism of the Persians— a transparent allusion to the contrast between con-temporary En gland and France.Th e Athenian Letters were presented as the En glish translation, commis-sioned by the British consul in Tunis, of a Spanish version, prepared by a “learned Jew,” of the original written in “an ancient Persian tongue” and dis-covered in the library at Fez. Th e authenticity of the letters was emphasized in the footnotes: in one of them the veracity of a recently published Greek inscription (the Marmor Sandvicense) was proved, paradoxically, by fi ctitious statements of Cleander, the Persian spy. A letter to Isaac Newton and Rob-ert Boyle describing future scientifi c progress in the form of a prophetic vi-sion was denounced as a forgery and thus relegated to an appendix— a fi nal fl ourish which ironically reiterated the general authenticity of the Athenian Letters. Each piece of correspondence was accompanied by a capital initial, the only clue off ered deliberately by the authors of this erudite game, whose identity was revealed only when the Athenian Letters were reprinted in an edi-tion of about one hundred copies in 1781. Th e new preface was tinged with melancholy: almost all the authors in the interim had died. “When a certain period of time has elapsed,” wrote one of the survivors, “the truth can be re-vealed; the illusion vanishes, the masquerade is over.”  Some of the participants had occupied public positions: Charles Yorke, who with his brother Philip had authored the greater part of the collection, had been lord chancellor; William Heberden, who in one of the letters portrayed a meeting with Hip-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"anacharsis interrogates the natives . 123pocrates, had become a famous physician. All had been students at Cam-bridge; almost all had been members of Corpus Christi College. Th e group, about a dozen persons, included antiquarians such as Daniel Wray and Th omas Birch, who had thought up the initiative; a philologist, Samuel Salter; a writer on religious questions, Henry Coventry. A notable presence was that of Catherine Talbot, who would become the author of essays which were re-printed often: she was perhaps the fi rst Eu ro pe an woman to produce a his-torical work, even if in this case it was fi ctional history.In a letter to the Monthly Review Barthélemy, while acknowledging the similarity in structure between the Athenian Letters and the Vo y a g e , unequivo-cally rejected the accusation of plagiarism. To demonstrate his own originality, he affi rmed that at one point, during his Roman sojourn, he had considered writing a book based on the experiences of a French traveler in the Italy of Leo X; later, he had decided instead to take advantage of his own antiquar-ian experiences, transforming the French traveler into the Scythian Ana-charsis. Th ere may have been some truth to these allegations (later repeated in his memoirs); not so credible, instead, was his assertion that he had learned of the existence of the En glish collection only after he had published the Vo y -age. Horace Walpole, who had a long association with Barthélemy, was well acquainted with many of the authors of the Athenian Letters. And one of the imaginary characters in the Vo y a g e , Arsame, minister to the king of Persia— in whom contemporary readers, starting with Walpole, recognized a transparent homage to the duke de Choiseul— resembled too closely, even in the name, the satrap Orsames, one of the interlocutors in the Athenian Letters.7. I n t he Vo y a g e d u j e u n e A n a c h a r s i s every detail is scrupulously, punctili-ously documented; in the Athenian Letters the invented documents serve to support the genuine ones. In both cases the amalgam of authenticity and fi c-tion attempts to substitute the limitations of the existing historiography. But how to recount the daily life, “the minute circumstances, which a historian is not permitted to report”? Here the dependence of Barthélemy’s Vo y a g e on the Athenian Letters is obvious: Cleander, the Persian spy, is the obvious model for Anacharsis the Scythian. Twenty- fi ve years before Voltaire’s Essai sur les mœurs, the Athenian Letters expressed the need for a type of historiography which did not yet exist: “Th ese letters by our agents, which portray from life"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"124 . anacharsis interrogates the nativesthe activities of Greeks and Persians, provide us with a better idea of their customs than what can be off ered by severe antiquarians, with their elabo-rate and formal treatises.”But even Cleander was not an original invention. Today the Athenian Letters immediately call to mind the Lettres Persanes. But the model for the Athenian Letters, mentioned explicitly in the introduction to the 1781 reprint-ing, was not Montesquieu, but rather the work which had inspired his Lettres: L’esploratore turco, by Gian Paolo Marana (1681), whose translations and adap-tations in French and En glish had been disseminated throughout Eu rope (L’espion turc; L’espion du grand seigneur dans les cours des princes chrétiens; Th e Tu r k i s h S p y).Th e narrative artifi ce is identical, the results totally diff erent. Montes-quieu’s corrosive viewpoint, here and there anticipated by the libertine Marana (for example, in the description of the Eucharist), observes without under-standing them the surrounding social customs, thereby unveiling their absur-dity and arbitrariness. In the Athenian Letters and in the Vo y a g e d u j e u n e Anacharsis the foreigner (the spy, the traveler) seeks information on the sim-plest customs without harboring any hostile intention. In one case the purpose is to make the present time, which we take for granted, less familiar. In the other, the purpose is that of familiarizing us with a past the everyday form of which eludes us: an apparently banal operation, which in fact presupposed a deep fi ssure within the historiographical tradition born in Greece.8. Herodotus (8:26) recounts that Xerxes, king of Persia, after the battle of Th ermopylae, asked a group of Arcadian deserters what was occupying the Greeks. Learning that they were celebrating the Olympic games, he inquired what the prize might be. An olive wreath, they replied.Xerxes’ questions, which no Greek would have dreamed of asking, irrepa-rably revealed his barbarism and his disassociation from a world in which valor, not wealth, constituted the highest honor. Th e crown of laurel bestowed on the winner of the games ended up by symbolizing the relationship of reciprocal exclusion between Greeks and barbarians. In a dialogue by Lucian of Samo-sata, a Scythian who had come to Greece broke into wild laughter when he learned that young people were vying against one another for a crown of wild olive or pine branches. Th e name of the Scythian was Anacharsis.His alter ego, the protagonist of Barthélemy’s voyage, was equally igno-rant of the rules governing the games in Greek society.

During the long gestation of the Voyage du jeune Anacharsis, a work of a wholly diff erent kind appeared, one destined to much more lasting fame: Th e History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Its author, Edward Gib-bon, had imbibed that antiquarian culture which had produced Barthélemy, that of the Académie des Inscriptions. But other elements had played a role in the education of Gibbon, principally the ideas of the philosophes, which were totally foreign to the abbé Barthélemy. Gibbon has been called the found er of modern historiography for having understood how to com-bine antiquarianism and histoire philosophique. Th e road taken, infi nitely more modestly, by the abbé Barthélemy assumed the merging of antiquari-anism and romanticized history: in the long run, a losing strategy.Th e nineteenth century viewed Barthélemy’s Greece as a vast panorama. Th e success of the Vo y a g e d u j e u n e A n a c h a r s i s was like a bonfi re enduring one hundred years, now forever extinguished. And yet it may be only fair to view this by- now- illegible book as a pioneering eff ort of historical ethnography, and to view in the Scythian Anacharsis, besides a descendant of the Anglo- Persian spy Cleander, an involuntary forerunner of anthropologists and in-quisitors closer to our times."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"1261. In Eric Hobsbawm’s autobiography, Interesting Times, the chapter entitled “Among the Historians” opens with a question regarding how history had changed in the course of his lifetime. Th e answer paints a picture fi lled with light and shadow. It begins with the long battle between innovators (Hobsbawm calls them “modernizers”) and traditionalists which began c. 1890 and climaxed in the mid– twentieth century. For a while the innovators called themselves “social historians,” a vague expression with which Hobsbawm does not fully identify. Th eir target was “the traditional bias of conventional historians in favour of kings, ministers, battles and treaties, i.e. top- level decision- makers both po liti cal and military.” Hobsbawm explains how the innovators achieved an ever more authoritative standing on the international scene: “. . . around 1970 it seemed reasonable to suppose that the struggle for the modernization of historiography that had begun in the 1890s had been won.” But during the 1970s the panorama suddenly changed, and it is clear that for Hobsbawm this was not progress. To illustrate this transformation he cites, on one hand, Braudel’s Th e Mediterranean (1949), and on the other, “the brilliant tour de force of ‘thick description,’ ” Deep Play: Notes on the Bali-nese Cock- Fight, by Cliff ord Geertz (1973), a great book and a brief essay which symbolize, respectively, the study of “structure” and of “culture.” “Th ere was a shift away,” Hobsbawm continued, “from historical models or ‘the large why questions,’ a shift from ‘the analytical to the descriptive mode,’ from economic and social structure to culture, from recovering fact to recov-ering feeling, from telescope to microscope— as in the enormously infl uential CHAPTER 9Following the Tracks of Israël Bertuccio"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"following the tracks of israël bertuccio . 127little monograph on the world- view of one sixteenth- century eccentric Friulian miller by the young Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg.” In a note Hobsbawm observed that I benandanti, the earlier (and, in his opinion, “more interesting”) of my books, which he promptly reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement, “curiously . . . had not then attracted attention.” Almost forty years have passed. Th is no longer young historian recalls that generous review with gratitude, and, before that, the strong impression made on him by Hobsbawm’s writings. But today Hobsbawm sees in my work an example of that regrettable historiographical turning point which has endan-gered the positive eff ects of the innovators. I do not entirely recognize myself in this characterization. For example, I think that I have always kept my dis-tance from description, pure and simple, but this is beside the point. What interests me are Hobsbawm’s observations on the state of historical writing today, and what they imply. According to him, historiography’s cognitive am-bitions have been weakened by the new directions of the social movements that emerged in the ’60s: “More history than ever is today being revised or invented by people who do not want the real past, but only a past that suits their pur-pose. Today is the great age of historical mythology.” Th e desire to be recog-nized coming from women, from ethnic or gender minorities, and from still others has run up against the pretense of history to formulate potentially uni-versal discourse. What has been undermined is “the belief that historians’ in-vestigations, by means of generally accepted rules of logic and evidence, distin-guish between fact and fi ction, between what can be established and what cannot, what is the case and what we would like to be so.”I share fully Hobsbawm’s concern on this last point: much of what I have written in the last twenty years deals precisely with this topic. About his earlier remarks, there would be much to say. Even his liquidation of post-modernism as a fashion that has only marginally touched history seems to have been reached too hastily. Generally, it seems to me that we must distin-guish between questions and answers: it is a lesson that I learned from some-one who has been important for Hobsbawm as well. Antonio Gramsci’s prison notebooks grow out of the awareness that Fascism had won out be-cause it had been able to give ready answers, albeit reactionary ones, to ques-tions which were not reactionary. Th is observation has profound implica-tions, even for the work of historians. It is one thing to reject de cadent or irrelevant responses on the intellectual level; it is quite another to reject the questions which generated them."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128 . following the tracks of israël bertuccioIn December 2004, Le Monde Diplomatique, under the title “Manifeste pour l’histoire,” published the text of a lecture Hobsbawm had given a month earlier at a conference on Marxist historiography or ga nized by the British Academy. Th e French version contained a passage (one which did not appear in the original text) in which Hobsbawm once again observed that contempo-rary historical writing had passed from a quantitative to a qualitative perspec-tive, from macrohistory to microhistory, from analysis of structures to narra-tives, from the history of society to the history of culture. In this series of antitheses I fi nd that I am always on the wrong side. But when Hobsbawm writes that the greatest immediate po liti cal danger for historiography is “anti- universalism”—namely, the conviction that “my truth” is as worthy as yours, in de pen dent of the evidence proff ered— then I am in complete agreement.One can wage this battle using diff erent tactics. In the case analyzed in this chapter, I have tried to oppose, using a microscopic scale, the postmodernist tendency to abolish the distinction between history and fi ction. In other words, I have met my adversary on his own terrain, starting out from his own ques-tions; but I have arrived at totally diff erent answers.2. “ ‘Has not Israël Bertuccio got more character than all those noble Vene-tians?’ said our rebellious plebeian to himself [notre plébeien revolté].”Th e speaker is Julien Sorel, the protagonist of Th e Red and the Black. Stendhal wrote his novel in a mad frenzy between 1828 and 1830, completing the correction of the proofs just after the July Revolution. Th e sentence I have just quoted is from one of the most extraordinary chapters in the book. Julien Sorel accompanies Matilde de la Môle to a ball of high Pa ri sian society. Th e narration, in the third person, is continually interrupted by the private thoughts of the characters. Th e reader views the ball especially through the eyes of Julien, the peasants’ son who regards with hate and contempt the high society to which he does not belong and which he dreams of destroying. He mentally compares Venetian nobility, which goes back to a.d. 700, to Pa ri sian aristoc-racy, which is much newer, and concludes to himself: “Well, in spite of all those noble Venetians whom birth makes so great, it is Israël Bertuccio whom one remembers.”Who is this Israël Bertuccio with whom Julien Sorel, “rebellious plebeian,” identifi es himself? Stendhal himself clarifi es the matter: “It happened that Julien had seen the day before Marino Faliero, a tragedy by Casimir Delavi-gne.” It is a seemingly factual reference, but, as we shall see, misleading."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"following the tracks of israël bertuccio . 129Delavigne’s Marino Faliero was performed in Paris at the theater of Porte Saint- Martin on 30 May 1829. Th e play had been preceded, on the seventh of the month, by a parody, a vaudev ille of Varner and Bayard entitled Marino Faliero à Paris, interspersed with pop u lar songs that went: “Machine! Ce qui domine/C’est cela; Machine/Le siècle est là.” Even in Delavigne’s tragedy references to the present were not lacking, but there were also many pertain-ing to a future that the Pa ri sian public of 1829 must have imagined to be im-minent. Th e speech of the old doge Marin Falier to the conspirators presages a society in which “only work will produce wealth, talent will give power and virtue will bestow nobility”— in other words, a bourgeois society. Th e ma-jority of the plotters is made up of fi shermen, artisans, and gondoliers led by Israël Bertuccio, who is described as “un homme du peuple . . . un patron de galère.” Th ere is a scene in which the gondolier Pietro lays his hand famil-iarly on the doge’s shoulder and, when the latter reacts indignantly, exclaims, astonished, “Among equals!” Th is may have inspired Julien Sorel to refl ect: “A conspiracy annihilates all titles conferred by social caprice.” But here Delavi-gne’s Bertuccio, who reproaches the gondolier Pietro, reaffi rming the author-ity of the doge, is a colorless character, just as Delavigne’s play Marino Faliero is a pale imitation of the original, Lord Byron’s Marino Faliero, written in 1820. Aside from the banal idea of transforming the wife of the old doge into an adulteress, whom Byron portrays as the imperturbable victim of a cal-umny, Delavigne feebly followed his model, claiming an originality that was not really there. Th is was noted even by Stendhal, who, in an anonymous article in the New Monthly Magazine, spoke coldly of the play by Delavigne, a writer whom he did not esteem. Stendhal, as he often does, misleads his readers: his own views diff er from those of his protagonist, Julien Sorel, and the specifi c mention of Delavigne in the article conceals an implicit reference to Byron.Stendhal had known Byron in Milan between 1816 and 1817. Many years later Stendhal recalled him perpetually “agitated . . . by some passion or other”: he saw him beset, without cease, in turn, by the genius of the poet, the fatuity of the aristocrat, and a vanity pushed to the extremes of madness. But when Stendhal surrendered to one of his infantile whims, he would list the three greatest men he had ever met: Napoleon; invariably accompanied by Lord Byron; followed by, depending on the circumstances, Antonio Canova or Gioacchino Rossini. As long as Byron was alive, Stendhal awaited his writ-ings impatiently. In December 1820 he wrote to a friend asking him to send a"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"130 . following the tracks of israël bertucciocopy of the second edition of Byron’s Marino Faliero (the fi rst was already out of print), providing that the book did not cost too much. Sooner or later Stendhal would have read it. I shall try to explain the identifi cation of Julien Sorel with Israël Bertuccio in the light of this likely reading. But fi rst some-thing needs to be said about the plot of Byron’s Marino Faliero.In the very title Byron announced that the play would have notes to sub-stantiate the historical truth of various details. Th e notes were followed by an appendix reproducing passages from a number of chroniclers and histori-ans concerning the story of Marin Falier. In the chronicles, at least in some of them, the antiaristocratic conspiracy of 1355 was described as the reaction to a twofold off ense which had victimized, respectively, the old doge Marin Falier, derided as a cuckold in the placards concocted by some young noblemen, and Israël Bertuccio, head of the Arsenal, who had been struck a blow by one of them after a frivolous altercation. Byron takes up this parallelism: the desti-nies of the two men, seemingly so distant, merge in the course of the events of one night. Th e conspirators are ready. Th e next morning, 15 April, the doge will sound the great bell, the warning of impending danger (in fact, there is a war on with Genoa). Th e nobility will rush to the ducal palace, where they will be massacred, followed by the sacking of their residences. But one of the conspirators betrays the plan, the plot is uncovered, and its leaders—Israël Bertuccio and Filippo Calandra, who are not of aristocratic birth— are hanged; the old doge is beheaded.For Byron, as well as for his readers, the contemporary echoes of this epi-sode were obvious. Th is has been stated repeatedly. Byron wrote Marino Faliero in 1820, in Ravenna, where he was living with Teresa Guiccioli (but the idea for it went back three years earlier). Th rough Guiccioli’s family By-ron had come into contact with the underground po liti cal movement of the Carbonari. To be sure, what was good for Italy was not necessarily good for Great Britain. In 1820, for example, Byron vigorously condemned the Cato Street conspiracy, which intended to assassinate a number of ministers. His reaction supports the traditional view that Marino Faliero should be read in an autobiographical key: in the uncertainty of the old doge, who hesitates before the prospect of the slaughter of the Venetian nobility, Lord Byron was projecting his ambivalence due to his own aristocratic birth.Th ese hypotheses, all of them plausible, take us to the beginning of the work. Byron substantially followed the traditionally recognized history, but parted from it (as he indicated in the preface) where he presented the plot as"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"following the tracks of israël bertuccio . 131already formed. In his tragedy the doge joins an existing conspiracy, whereas in reality it had been he, together with Israël Bertuccio, who had set it in mo-tion. Th e desire to construct a tragedy modeled on Aristotelian unity, thereby avoiding the irregularity that constituted a weak point in the En glish theater, prompted Byron to situate Israël Bertuccio at the center of the action. Crit-ics have missed the importance of this structural choice, even those who have shown how Byron, at the same time that he was rejecting Shakespeare in the name of Aristotelian unity, was writing a tragedy rich in echoes from Shake-speare, especially Macbeth. It has been noted that Marino Faliero’s depen-dence on this play is marked by a bloody trail. After Banquo’s assassination, Macbeth, torn with guilt, exclaims: “Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood / Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather / Th e Multitudi-nous seas incarnadine, / Making the green one red.” Here incarnadine is used as a verb. In Marino Faliero the word returns to being an adjective: “When all is over,” the doge says to Israël Bertuccio, “you’ll be free and merry, / and calmly wash those hands incarnadine.” Th e analogy between the two passages brings out their diff erence. Macbeth is rent by remorse for what he has done; the doge, for that which he is about to do— the slaughter of the nobles who will be summoned to the palace. Th e contrast between the tormenting indeci-sion of the doge and the implacable fi rmness of Israël Bertuccio repeats the contrast between the irresolute will of Macbeth and the ferocious determina-tion of Lady Macbeth. But Byron rereads and rewrites Shakespeare while looking back at the French Revolution and, contemporaneously, forward to an approaching future. Israël Bertuccio incarnates a new reality: the pitiless innocence of the revolutionary. In a dialogue in which solidarity and class hate violently oppose each other, the doge, turning to Israël Bertuccio, blurts out: “You are a patriot, a plebeian Gracchus.” It is with this “plebeian Gracchus” that Julien Sorel, plébéien révolté, identifi es himself: a Jacobin outside his time, whose desperate energy erupts tragically, wretchedly, in an act of personal vi-olence. And like Israël Bertuccio, Julien Sorel, who also rebuff s the priest sent to visit him before his execution, does not feel any pangs of guilt. Th is, too, may have been one of his “atrocious” traits which shocked even such an intelligent and somewhat cynical reader as Prosper Mérimée.Byron’s writings appeared scandalous as well (not to mention the author himself ). In 1822 a harsh critic of his Cain, who concealed himself under the pseudonym “Philo- Milton,” suggested that invented works (“fi ction”) were much more dangerous than essays and books of history, because they were sold"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"132 . following the tracks of israël bertucciomore cheaply and were accessible to a much larger public. In the case of works that on the whole were harmful, wrote “Philo- Milton,” their circula-tion had to be impeded at all costs. Th is had happened, just the year before, with Marino Faliero, performed on Drury Lane in London in a mutilated ver-sion. Th e copy of Byron’s tragedy owned by the Huntington Library shows that the censor had suppressed half the text, focusing especially on the exchanges between the doge and Israël Bertuccio. A play like Marino Faliero was doubly dangerous in the eyes of the censors, because it combined the dangers of history with the attractions of invention. For us, the personages created by Stendhal, Delavigne, and Byron belong to the world of literary fi ction. For Byron it was a diff erent matter: in the preface to Marino Faliero he observed that with the ex-ception of Angiolina, the wife of the doge, all the personages were “strictly his-torical,” and, as far as “real facts” were concerned, he invited readers to look closely at the texts published in the appendix.Let us do just that. Byron’s principal source for the conspiracy was Marin Sanudo’s multivolume Vite dei dogi, which he cited from the edition in Mu-ratori’s Rerum Italicarum Scriptores. In the Sanudo text used by Byron we fi n d I s r a ë l B e r t u c c i : “ Th ey sent for Filippo Calendario, a seafaring man and one of great consequence, and for Bertucci Israello, engineer and a most as-tute man.” Th ere are two problems with this. Th e fi rst, apparently negligible, is the reversal of the name: Bertucci Israello instead of Israël Bertuccio (or Bertucci, as we might expect). Th e second has to do with the profession: engi-neer instead of admiral, as we read in Byron’s play. Th e latter diffi culty has an easy solution. Th e “ancient chronicle” copied by Sanudo recounts, in the para-graph preceding the just- quoted passage, that a nobleman of the Barbaro fam-ily had struck the admiral of the Arsenal, who then had gone to the doge to protest this aff ront. Byron combined the two passages, tacitly identifying the admiral with Israël Bertuccio. But the fi rst diffi culty is more serious. If we compare the passage in Sanudo quoted in the appendix of Marino Faliero with the corresponding passage in the Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, we discover that Byron’s transcription (or that of whoever copied it for him) is incorrect. Th e text published by Muratori speaks of a “Bertucci Isarello, Engineer and most astute man.”Israello or Isarello? Th is is not a trivial choice. If we opt for “Isarello,” the possibility or probability that we might have been dealing with a Jew vanishes (and, for that matter, could a Jew in fourteenth- century Venice become, though certainly not an admiral, even an “engineer,” or what ever the exact"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"following the tracks of israël bertuccio . 133meaning of this term is?). We need to look at the texts more closely. Today the edition of the Vite dei dogi in the Rerum Italicarum Scriptores seems wholly unreliable, an Italianized version full of lacunae and errors. Comparing the printed text with a manuscript copy of the corresponding passage of the Vite dei dogi (the second volume of Sanudo’s original autograph has been lost), the name “Isarello” emerges once again. But we need to press further. One of the oldest pieces of evidence concerning the conspiracy of Marin Falier is provided by the incomplete Latin chronicle of Lorenzo de’ Monaci, chancellor of Crete, written shortly after 1420 but not printed until 1758. Among the events reported in this work we fi nd the blow struck by a nobleman (here identifi ed as Giovanni Dandolo) against a “Bertucium Israelo” of San Basi-lio, an affl uent man among mariners (“notabilis conditionis inter marinar-ios”), perhaps a ship own er or shipbuilder. In the index of names to Lorenzo de’ Monaci’s chronicle we fi nd a reference to “Bertuccius Israel rebellis,”  the very name recorded (perhaps in de pen dently) in the appendix to Byron’s Ma-rino Faliero. Is this the actual designation for the person whose tracks we are following? Or is this a humanistic disguise transforming “Isarello” into “Is-raelo”? And if this was an act of dissimulation, who was responsible? Lorenzo de’ Monaci, or the eighteenth- century erudite who published his work? Th e manuscripts of de Monaci’s Chronicon de rebus Venetis may provide an answer. Kristeller’s Iter Italicum rec ords a seventeenth- century copy housed in the Brit-ish Library. But the remaining questions would persist.Th is long discussion takes us far from the notion (shared by Byron— not a historian) that chronicles contain “real facts,” things as they really happened. To untangle the contradictions among these accounts we must try to read them critically, by inserting them into a broader documentary context. In ef-fect, we have to go backward, retracing our steps along a path that, by follow-ing the name of Israël Bertuccio, brought us from a literary romance to a tragedy (two in fact), and from there to the chronicles. But before moving on to the next stage, it might be useful to clarify the overall signifi cance of this journey.We began from the literary echoes of Marin Falier’s conspiracy; by dint of retrogressing we came to the conspiracy itself. Numerous studies deal with aspects of this subject, some of them excellent, but there is no satisfactory comprehensive and comparative overview; this is highly desirable in view of the extraordinary nature of the event and of Venetian history itself. For the moment, at any rate, we need to question an interpretation, put forward in"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134 . following the tracks of israël bertucciothe last few de cades by reliable scholars, that the conspiracy of Marin Falier was a clash between aristocratic parties or factions. Th is view seems to be defi nitely incompatible with the participation in the plot, along with the doge, of persons belonging to the well- to- do populace (“populares pinguis conditionis,” as they were dubbed by Lorenzo de’ Monaci). Th e detailed descriptions (later developed by the literary tradition) of the insult infl icted contemporaneously on the doge and on a person of the pop u lar classes obvi-ously are an attempt to explain anecdotally the anomalous social alliance be-hind the conspiracy.Can we suppose that in some cases these anecdotes reworked a real event, expanding it? Vittorio Lazzarini, who contributed the most to our knowl-edge of the Falier conspiracy, has not ruled this out. In one of his admirable, erudite pieces of research from the end of the nineteenth century and fi nally collected in a volume in 1963, Lazzarini analyzed that page from Lorenzo de’ Monaci’s chronicle which discussed the blow the nobleman Giovanni Dan-dolo was said to have infl icted on Bertucci Isarello. (Actually, de’ Monaci, as we saw, spoke of a Bertuccio Israelo—a variant form not recorded by Lazza-rini.) In succeeding chronicles the episode was repeated and expanded. Th e names of the protagonists change: in the so- called Barbaro chronicle it is Marco Barbaro who administers the slap, and the person receiving it is Ste-fano Giazza nicknamed Gisello, admiral of the Arsenal, who says to Marin Falier: “Meser lo dose, le bestie maligne se liga, e se ne le se pol ligar le se ammazza” (“My Lord, doge, we tie up malignant beasts, and if we cannot tie them up, we butcher them”). Lazzarini comments: “We suspect that the two diff erent accounts are the reports of a single fact, and, anyway, we ac-cept the one that refers to Dandolo and to Bertuccio Isarello, because it is narrated by a chronicler who is almost contemporary, as is the case with de’ Monaci, and because Giovanni Dandolo was at the time sopracomito and councillor of the capitano da mar and Bertuccio Isarello is a historical person, whereas Stefano Giazza never appears in contemporary documents and chronicles. . . .”“Bertuccio Isarello is a historical person”: the statement is supported by careful research conducted on Venetian notarial documents. Of the fi ve texts discovered by Lazzarini, it suffi ces to mention two, both conserved in the fondo Grazie in the Venetian State Archives. From the fi rst, dated 13 July 1330, it emerges that Bertuccio Isarello was at the time a nauclero, the master of a vessel, together with Jacobello Lambardo. Th e second, dated 22 February"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"following the tracks of israël bertuccio . 1351345, reveals that Bertuccio Isarello was sentenced to a fi ne equal to half the value of a cargo of pepper.Th is is the name of the man who is supposed to have participated, with his father- in- law Filippo Calendario, in Doge Marin Faliero’s conspiracy. In a fi ne essay Lazzarini refuted the tradition which identifi ed Filippo Calen-dario as the architect of the ducal palace. In the documents Filippo is al-ways referred to as “taiapiera” (“stone cutter”), except in the aforementioned “ancient chronicle” transcribed by Sanudo, which speaks of a “Filippo Calen-daro seafarer and man of great consequence and . . . Bertuzzi Isarello engineer and a most astute man.” Lazzarini shrewdly supposes that in this passage the professions of the father- in- law and of the son- in- law were reversed: Ber-tuccio Isarello would have been the “seafarer and man of great consequence.” To grasp the signifi cance of this last point it will suffi ce to recall how the conspiracy was supposed to have unfolded. Nicolò Trevisan, who at the time sat on the Council of Ten, wrote in his chronicle that “Philippo Calendario with all those of the castle, namely the seafaring men, that very night [of the conspiracy] were to rush to shore.” Of the ten men hanged by the neck as participants in the conspiracy, fi ve were variously described as “seafaring men.” Four other “seafaring men, who were principal actors and traitors in said betrayal,” managed to escape and were declared outlaws. Only in- depth research may be able to tell us what drove “the seafaring men,” after the Geno-ese victory at Porto Longo, to support Marin Falier’s attempt to make himself “sovereign” of Venice. To be sure, the conspirators were not isolated fi gures. Th e four magistrates appointed by the Council of Ten to deal with the situa-tion acted with extreme dispatch. Th ey had to set an example, impede the contagion from spreading: “Th e earth was set in motion,” a contemporary chronicle cryptically mentions.Th e sentences reveal a symbolic hierarchy. At the summit we fi nd Bertuc-cio Isarello and Filippo Calendario. On 16 April, a day after the discovery of the conspiracy, they were hanged by the neck “with iron gags (sparang e) over their mouths,” presumably to prevent them from haranguing the crowd. None of the other condemned men received this macabre treatment. On 17 April the doge’s cap was cast to the ground and he was decapitated.3. Our journey backward from libraries to archives, from Julien Sorel to the conspiracy of Marin Falier, has been highly discontinuous. Between Israël Bertuccio and Bertuccio Isarello there is more than the divide separating"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"136 . following the tracks of israël bertucciofi ction from historical reality. In the continuous variation of the contexts, everything— from names to social status— dissolves. An aphorism from the eighteenth- century satirist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg comes to mind: “If I fi rst change the blade and then the handle of my knife, do I still have the same knife?”One of Lichtenberg’s devoted readers invites us to examine the question diff erently. I refer to Ludwig Wittgenstein and to his notion of “family resem-blances.” Wittgenstein began from the “composite portraits” of Francis Gal-ton, images created by the superimposition of photographs of members of the same family, or of a determinate social group. Earlier Wittgenstein had used Galton’s “composite portraits” to illustrate the possibility of isolating a common element, running like a red thread (a meta phor borrowed from Goethe’s novel Elective Affi nities) within a determinate whole. Later, Wittgen-stein, in writings published after his death with the title Philosophische Unter-suchungen, returned to Galton’s experiment, but now suggesting a totally dif-ferent point of view. Th e shaded contours of the “composite portraits,” the result of partial intertwining and superimpositions, suggested a diff erent, non-essentialist notion of family resemblances. Th e meta phor of the red thread running the length of the fi ber was replaced by a much more complex web. In a series of perceptive essays the British anthropologist Rodney Needham identi-fi ed the historical pre ce dents of Wittgenstein’s idea, demonstrating that the eighteenth- century botanist Michel Adanson had already worked out a similar classifi cation. Th e series which Needham called “polythetic” can include com-ponents characterized by distinctive traits of the type aba, bcb, dcd. . . . In a case of this sort, the fi rst and last elements in the series do not have any trait in common.4. Th e long shadow thrown over the centuries by Bertuccio Isarello is a fi c-tional shadow, the shadow of someone else. His voice, suff ocated on the scaf-fold, has not come down to us. But precisely because it is important to distin-guish between reality and fi ction, we must learn to recognize when one becomes joined to the other, each transmitting something that we might call “energy”— that word so dear to Stendhal."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"1371. Balzac issued an explicit challenge to historians of his day; Stendhal, an implicit one to future historians. Th e fi rst of these is known; the second is not. Th is is an attempt to examine an aspect of the latter.Erich Auerbach devoted one of the central chapters in his Mimesis to the relationships of both Stendhal and Balzac with historians. To evaluate this properly we need fi rst to point out a fact strangely neglected by critics: in the lon g s e r ie s of p a s s a ge s t h a t h ave b e e n s t u d ie d i n Mimesis, poets and novelists— Homer, Dante, Stendhal, Balzac, Proust, and many others— alternate with such historians as Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Gregory of Tours, or with a memorialist such as Saint- Simon.Today, a coexistence of this sort may seem unremarkable. Many readers assume without question that all the texts discussed by Auerbach are to a greater or lesser degree works of fi ction. Th is interpretation of Mimesis, which undoubtedly has contributed to his continuing fame in American universi-ties, would have horrifi ed Auerbach himself. After all, the subtitle of his book is Th e Repre sen ta tion of Reality in Western Literature (Dargestellte Wirklichkeit in der abendländischen Literatur). Auerbach had a strong sense of reality and especially of social reality. His approach, inspired by Giambattista Vico (even if its nucleus was, in my opinion, a secularized version of an idea belonging to St. Augustine), was based on the notion that historical development tends to generate multiple approaches to reality. But Auerbach was not a relativist. When he commented on the descriptions of the military revolts which we read in Tacitus and Ammianus, Auerbach stressed that these historians CHAPTER 10Th e Bitter TruthStendhal’s Challenge to Historians"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138 . stendhal’s challenge to historians were not concerned with “objective problems” such as the “condition of the Roman populace,” and he remarked that “. . . a modern historian would have taken up the question of how such a state of aff airs had come about, he would have discussed the problem of the mob’s corruption, or at the very least have touched upon it. But this does not interest Ammianus at all; and in this attitude he goes much further than Tacitus.”Th us, Auerbach reaches the point of characterizing the specifi c nature of passages in Tacitus and Ammianus, opposing their points of view to some that are more modern and truthful. It is not a matter of just one isolated in-stance. Even when he is studying fi ctional works Auerbach always considers, explicitly or implicitly, historical reality as it has been perceived by the modern conscience. He writes, for example, in the chapter on Stendhal, “. . . the ele-ment of time perspective is evident everywhere. . . . Insofar as the serious real-ism of modern times cannot represent man otherwise than as embedded in a total reality, po liti cal, social, and economic which is concrete and constantly evolving— as is the case today in any novel or fi lm— Stendhal is its found er.”But, according to Auerbach, Stendhal’s serious, “modern” realism was not, after all, fully modern: “However, the attitude from which Stendhal ap-prehends the world of events and attempts to reproduce it with all its intercon-nections is as yet hardly infl uenced by historicism [Historismus] . . . his repre sen ta tion of events is oriented, wholly in the spirit of classic ethical psy-chology, upon an analyse du cœur humain, not upon discovery or premonitions of historical forces; we fi nd rationalistic, empirical, sensual motifs in him, but hardly those of romantic Historicism.”To discover an authentic historicist point of view, Auerbach notes, we must turn to Balzac. In him novelist and historian converge, demonstrating the truth of the romantic notion that the many cultural forms of a period are joined by a hidden coherence: “Atmospheric Historism and atmospheric re-alism are closely connected; Michelet and Balzac are borne on the same stream. . . . It is needless to cite historical motifs, for the spirit of Historism with its emphasis upon ambient and individual atmospheres is the spirit of his [Balzac’s] entire work.” At this point we might be tempted to equate Au-erbach’s position with German Historismus, a category which should not be confused either with Italian historicism or with the American New Histori-cism. To be sure, many passages in Mimesis point in this direction. But just before it ends, the book takes another tack. Auerbach actually states what the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 139reader had already come to suspect— namely, that the protagonists of the fi -nal chapter in Mimesis, Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf, also inspired the formal principles on which the book was constructed. From To the Light house and from the Recherche Auerbach took the idea, totally foreign to traditional literature, that through an accidental event, an ordinary life, a random pas-sage, we can attain a deeper understanding of the whole.How can we reconcile this historical perspective with the qualities of the passages from history and fi ction examined in Mimesis? Auerbach, who was suspicious of explicit theoretical formulations, did not ask himself the ques-tion. We, instead, can try to answer it by putting Auerbach himself, a mas-ter of the art, into perspective. Th e starting point for this game of Chinese boxes or mise en abîme will be the passage in Stendhal’s Th e Red and the Black which launched Auerbach into one of his more celebrated analyses. But fi rst it may be useful to establish the context.2. On the fl yleaf of the copy of Th e Red and the Black housed in the Bucci col-lection of the Sormani Municipal Library in Milan, Stendhal scribbled a few words: “Rome, 24 May 1834. When I was young I wrote a few biographies (Mo-zart, Michelangelo) which in some way were histories. I regret having written them. I believe that the truth in small as in large things, is almost unattainable— at least a truth that is somewhat circumstantial. Monsieur de Tracy used to say to me: truth can be found only in novels. With every passing day I can see more clearly that everywhere else we encounter only ostentation.”Th e inscriptions at the opening of each of the two volumes of Th e Red and the Black shed some light on these words. Th e fi rst is attributed to Danton: “Truth, the bitter truth.” Th e second, to Sainte- Beuve: “She’s not pretty, she’s not wearing rouge.” For Stendhal, “truth” meant, above all, rejection of every sort of ornamentation. My book, he proudly declared, is not pretty: it is im-mediate, direct, harsh. A harsh chronicle: the subtitle of the fi rst edition of the novel (1831) reads “Chronicle of the 19th Century,” altered a few pages later into “Chronicle of 1830.” More recent editions occasionally eliminate one of the two subtitles.Naturally, no reader has ever taken the word chronicle seriously. Th e Red and the Black has always been read as a novel. But Stendhal’s intentions are clear. Th rough a story based on fi ctional persons and events he hoped to reach a deeper historical truth. Th is was an aspiration shared by other early"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"140 . stendhal’s challenge to historiansnineteenth- century novelists, and principally by Balzac—“that great histo-rian,” as Baudelaire called him. But Stendhal had diff erent objectives and went in another direction.3. In that passage of Th e Red and the Black which Auerbach selected as the starting point for his examination, the protagonist of the novel, Julien Sorel, and his protector, the Jansenist abbé Pirard, are conversing in the chateau of the Marquis de la Mole. Julien is now working for the nobleman, who had in-vited him to join him in his meals. Julien asks the abbé to arrange for him to be excused from this obligation; he found the meals too boring. Pirard, “a true snob,” is scandalized by the insolence of this son of peasants. “A slight noise” reveals that the daughter of the marquis, Ma de moi selle de la Mole, has over-heard the conversation: “She had come to fetch a book and had heard every-thing. She began to entertain some respect for Julien. He has not been born servile, she thought, like that old abbé. Heavens! how ugly he is.”We shall return to this passage, but, meanwhile, here is Auerbach’s comment:What interests us in the scene is this: it would be almost incomprehensible with-out a most accurate and detailed knowledge of the po liti cal situation, the social stratifi cation, and the economic circumstances of a perfectly defi nite historical moment, namely, that in which France found itself just before the July Revolu-tion; accordingly, the novel bears the subtitle, Chronique de 1830. Even the bore-dom which reigns in the dining room and salon of this noble house is no ordinary boredom. It does not arise from the fortuitous personal dullness of the people who are brought together there; among them there are highly educated, witty, and sometimes important people, and the master of the house is intelligent and amiable. Rather, we are confronted, in their boredom, by a phenomenon po liti-cally and ideologically characteristic of the Restoration period. In the seven-teenth century and even more in the eigh teenth, the corresponding salons were anything but boring.Auerbach’s are astute observations, but his conclusions are debatable. It can be demonstrated that Stendhal considered boredom not only a phenom-enon of the past, associated with French society during the Restoration, but a phenomenon that characterized both the present— in other words, the so-ciety that succeeded the July (1830) Revolution— and the foreseeable future. We can add to support this interpretation Stendhal’s own review of his Th e Red and the Black prepared for the journal L’A n t o l o g i a in 1832. Th e review, as"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 141well as Vincenzo Salvagnoli’s article based on information gleaned from Stendhal, appeared posthumously. Auerbach wrote Mimesis in exile, at Is-tanbul, where access to secondary sources was precluded and primary sources were limited. Th e selection of the passage in question from Th e Red and the Black and Auerbach’s comment might have been infl uenced by a vague recol-lection of Stendhal’s review of his own work.It is an extraordinary document, an undoubted exercise in estrangement. In addressing a foreign audience under the veil of a pseudonym, Stendhal refl ected, from the vantage points of geography and culture, on the novel he had published two years earlier. Th e customs and moral attitudes described in Th e Red and the Black had taken root in France, Stendhal observed, “be-tween 1806 and 1832.” Provincial life before the Revolution was lighthearted, as emerges from that “charming, little novel” by Pierre Victor Besenval enti-tled Spleen. Today, Stendhal continues, “in a city numbering between six- and eight- thousand inhabitants everything is sad and correct. Th e foreign visitor does not know how to get through an eve ning, just like in En gland.”Stendhal ’s readers will fi nd it worthwhile to peruse Besenval ’s Spleen. Th e novel takes place at Besançon, one of the places where the events of Th e Red and the Black unfold; the name of the protagonist, Madame de Rennon, re-calls that of Madame de Rênal; the protagonist hates her father, just like Ju-lien Sorel (and, for that matter, Stendhal himself ). But even more notable is the fact that Stendhal starts from Besenval’s Spleen in making boredom the central theme of Th e Red and the Black. As Auerbach correctly notes, bore-dom for Stendhal is a historical phenomenon, tied to specifi c space and time. But the period indicated— between 1806, shortly after the inauguration of Napoleon’s empire, and 1832, the year of Stendhal’s review of his own work— and also the parallel with En gland cannot be reconciled with Auerbach’s idea that the boredom described by Stendhal should be placed in “France just prior to the July Revolution.”What, then, is boredom? It is the product (explains Stendhal’s self- review) of morality, of a “moral France” still unknown to foreigners, but which is get-ting ready to become the model for all of Eu rope:Moral France is unknown abroad. Th at is why before beginning to speak of the novel by M. de S[tendhal] it has been necessary that the gay, amusing, somewhat libertine France, which from 1715 to 1789 was the model for Eu rope, no longer exists: nothing resembles it less than the France, serious, moral, gloomy, which the Jesuits have bequeathed to us, the congregations and the government of the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"142 . stendhal’s challenge to historiansBourbons from 1814 to 1830. Since it is extremely diffi cult, where novels are con-cerned, to depict what is true and not copy from books, no one, before M. de S[tendahl] had dared to describe those so unattractive customs, which, never-theless, since Eu rope is populated by sheep, will spread quickly from Naples to St. Petersburg.Th at is how Stendhal perceived himself in 1832. Could he possibly retro-spectively have distorted the signifi cance of his own work? Th is immediately raises a long- standing question: when was Th e Red and the Black written? In his self- review Stendhal wrote that because he focused on “the society of 1829 (the time when the novel was written),” the author had risked imprisonment. In the “Editor’s Note” which precedes the book it is suggested that Stendhal had indicated a diff erent date: “We have reason to believe that the following pages were written in 1827.”Th ese two slightly divergent dates are both incorrect. We know from Stendhal himself that the idea for Th e Red and the Black had come to him in Marseilles, the night between 25 and 26 October 1829. He worked on the novel during the winter of 1829– 1830 and signed a contract with the pub-lisher Levavasseur on 8 April 1830. In May he corrected the fi rst proofs, but on 1 June of that year he was still “dictating” the scene in the Besançon Ca-thedral which appears in chapter 28 of book 1. Th e importance of these fi nal additions did not escape Victor Del Litto. Clearly, Stendhal kept returning to the novel while he was correcting the proofs. An enigmatic footnote dated “11 August 1830” reveals that the correction of the proofs (perhaps accompa-nied by moments of writing or rewriting) was still in progress after the July Revolution. Michel Crouzet has suggested that Th e Red and the Black was “written entirely before July 1830, and thus is intrinsically connected to the agony of the Restoration.” Th is is not convincing. Crouzet himself in a foot-note mentions a fact which clashes with his own chronology: Louis Lablache, the singer portrayed by Stendhal under the name of Géronimo, Julien Sorel’s friend, performed to great acclaim the role of Géronimo in Cimarosa’s Matri-monio segreto in Paris on 4 November 1830. Th is fact supposes, as Henri Martineau suggests, that Stendhal “continued to work editing and revising the novel until November.” He could have dictated the passage mentioning Géronimo’s triumph on 6 November, the eve of his own departure from Paris for Trieste, where he had been named consul. Th e publication of Th e Red and the Black was announced on 15 November."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 143Th is minute chronological excursus may seem pedantic and even irrele-vant. But the evidence which we have just reviewed explains why Stendhal dated the writing of the novel as 1827 in the editorial note and as 1829 in his own review of the work. Th e two dates, both incorrect, intended to suggest to readers— and even Auerbach was misled— that Th e Red and the Black accu-rately portrayed French society during the Restoration. Accurate it undoubt-edly was; but the characteristics described were destined to endure much beyond their original setting, as Stendhal suggested indirectly in one of the two subtitles to the work: “Chronicle of the Nineteenth Century.” In a foot-note at the end of the novel, which seemingly intended to signal the purely arbitrary value of the places where the events unfold (Verrières, Besançon), Stendhal alluded to the more general historical implications of the story: “Th e incon ve nience of the reign of public opinion is that though, of course, it secures liberty, it meddles with what it has nothing to do with— private life, for example. Hence the gloominess of America and En gland.”By using such terms as opinion and liberty, which evoked the po liti cal at-mosphere of the 1830 revolution, Stendhal was suggesting the importance of the novel for the France of the period following the Restoration. Th e men-tion of En gland and America was equally signifi cant. For Stendhal, the two countries symbolized the future— a somber future in which all passions would disappear except one: the passion for wealth. Boredom and melan-choly, produced by the intrusion of morality into private life, were the char-acteristics of modern industrial societies, among which France was about to be numbered.4. Auerbach wrote that Balzac “far outdoes the former [Stendhal] in organi-cally connecting man and history.” Th e remark does not do justice to Sten-dhal. Auerbach, misled by Historismus, had not noticed that in Stendhal’s nov-els the absence of an organic connection between man and history results from a deliberate choice, expressed through a specifi c formal procedure. Th e isola-tion of Stendhal’s heroes is underlined and strengthened by their internal re-fl ections, which, alternating with the description of their actions, create a sort of counterpoint. Th is procedure, which has been called “free direct discourse,” usually presents itself in this way: a narration in the third person is interrupted brusquely by a series of brief sentences attributed to one of the protagonists of the narration. Free direct discourse, while more highly structured than the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"144 . stendhal’s challenge to historiansformless fl ow of the internal monologue, places the reader in a close, almost intimate, relationship with the principal characters in the novel: Julien Sorel, Madame de Rênal, Ma de moi selle de la Mole. Let us return to the passage which describes the reaction of Ma de moi selle de la Mole to the conversation between Julien and the abbé Pirard: “She had come to fetch a book and had heard everything; she began to entertain some respect for Julien. He has not been born servile, she thought, like that old abbé. Heavens! how ugly he is.”We can see that Stendhal does not overpunctuate. No quotation marks introduce the last two sentences, even if both are characterized by direct sen-tences or by interjections: “thought” in the fi rst, the cry “Heavens!” followed by an exclamation mark in the next. When there are no quotation marks, the shift from the third to the fi rst person— whether this occurs in a single sen-tence or in two contiguous sentences— is more abrupt and startling. Here are two more examples, referring respectively to Julien Sorel and to Mathilde de la Mole, quoted fi rst in the original French, and then in an En glish transla-tion: “A force d’examiner le comte Norbert, Julien remarqua qu’il était en bottes et en éperons; [semicolon] et moi je dois être en souliers, apparemment comme inférieur.” And: “Ce Sorel a quelque chose de l’air que mon père prend quand il fait si bien Napoléon au bal. [period] Elle avait tout à fait oublié Danton. [period] Décidément, ce soir, je m’ennuie. [period] Elle saisit le bras de son frère. . . .”In the M. R. B. Shaw En glish translation the two passages become more conventional: “After taking a good look at Count Norbert, Julien noticed that he was booted and spurred; and I, he thought [my italics], am obliged to wear shoes, apparently as an inferior.” “Th is man Sorel has something of the air my father adopts when he gives such a good imitation of Napoleon, at a ball. She had completely forgotten Danton. I’m certainly feeling bored to-night, she thought [my italics]. She caught hold of her brother’s arms.”Th e translator must have feared that the reader could feel lost, if only for a fraction of a second: hence the addition of “he thought,” “she thought.” But this was precisely Stendhal’s aim: to give his narrative a feverish, dizzy pace by us-ing broken punctuation, which introduces a sudden change of viewpoints.5. In the passage analyzed by Auerbach, Julien uses Mathilde to justify the boredom he feels at the dinners of the marquis: “Sometimes I see even Ma-de moi selle de la Mole yawn.” A few chapters later Mathilde reappears, yawn-ing and fi xing on Julien “these fi ne eyes, which were the home of the deepest"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 145ennui.” Mathilde asks Julien to accompany her to a ball. Julien realizes that he must accept; but as soon as the dancing begins, his interest in her ceases. At this point the scene, one of the most extraordinary in the entire novel, is seen through the eyes of Mathilde. Th e only thoughts to which we have ac-cess are hers: “Yes, I am decidedly bored to night” and so forth. Julien enters into an impassioned discussion with Count Altamira, an exile from Naples who had fl ed (as Domenico Fiore, a friend of Stendhal’s, had done) to escape from a death sentence imposed for po liti cal motives. Th e two men draw near. Mathilde “did not lose a syllable of their conversation. Her ennui had vanished.”Both Mathilde and Julien are fascinated by Altamira. His impassioned po liti cal commitment is the true antithesis to boredom. Altamira tells Ju-lien: “Th ere are no longer any real passions in the nineteenth century; that’s why one is so bored in France.”Altamira talks of the nineteenth century as if Restoration France was a par tic u lar case confi rming a more general law. In this sense he is only echo-ing the two diff erent subtitles of the novel: “A Chronicle of 1830,” “Chronicle of the Nineteenth Century.” Altamira is speaking for Stendhal. Someone could object that the fi rst readers of Th e Red and the Black might have read these pages— in fact, the entire novel— in the context of the July Revolution. Th e passage in which Altamira expresses the wish that the experiences of the South American countries might transmit to Eu rope their ideals of liberty is accompanied by a footnote from the publisher (undoubtedly written by Sten-dhal himself ) in which it is laconically stated that this section of the novel, “sent to press 25 July 1830,” “was printed 4 August.” Th is has made Michel Crouzet argue that the scene at the ball and Altamira’s remarks “agree in every detail with the [July] Revolution, of which they are both the augury and the an-nouncement. Stendhal is telling the reader that his novel leads to the barri-cades, although without mentioning them.” But the footnote and the novel have completely diff erent meanings. Julien Sorel is not a liberal, he is a Jaco-bin, a throwback to another age; Th e Red and the Black relates the story of a tragic individual defeat, not of a victorious revolution. Stendhal thought that politics, as he had lived it under Napoleon during the Rus sian campaign, was a thing of the past, which the tiresome age of industry and commerce had rendered obsolete. And historiography, traditionally identifi ed with the history of public life, was by this point surpassed by novels, as Destutt de Tracy had explained to Stendhal. Historical events were destined to repeat"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"146 . stendhal’s challenge to historiansthemselves, but in diminished and distorted form. Mathilde distractedly is aware of this as she gazes pensively at Altamira: “I think being condemned to death is the only real distinction,” said Mathilde. “It is the only thing which cannot be bought.” Here—a frequent recurrence in Stendhal’s novels—future events are an-ticipated, obscurely and symbolically. Mathilde will bury Julien’s decapitated head, just as Queen Marguerite of Navarre had buried the head of her lover, Boniface de la Motte, at the time of the Wars of Religion. Julien will die not for a po liti cal cause but for attempting to murder his lover, Madame de Rênal. He will die not as a hero but as a criminal. In “a degenerate and tedious age,” in the words of Mathilde, everything can be bought and heroism is impossible.6. Let us return to the scene at the ball. Mathilde is listening to the conversa-tion between Julien and Altamira: “Ma de moi selle de la Mole, who was leaning her head forward with keenest interest, was so near him that her beautiful hair almost touched his shoulder.” O n c e a g a i n , M a t h i l d e i s p o r t r a y e d i n t h e a c t o f l i s t e n i n g , o f e a v e s d r o p p i n g — just as Stendhal was all ears to the conversations of his characters, compelling his readers to do the same. For Stendhal, the “I” is synonymous with multi-plicity. On some occasions he scrutinized with an amused, perplexed, or an-noyed air, as when he wrote in a copy of Armance: “Tedious Sunday, I walked along the Corso with Mister Sten[dhal] and so shall it be for my entire life, till the death.” Over half a century ago in a brilliant essay Jean Starobinski investigated Stendhal’s passion for pseudonyms, of which we know almost two hundred, used on both public and private occasions. Starobinski, a critic and psycho-analyst, stresses the voy eur is tic side of Stendhal, supporting his interpretation with a passage from the diaries in which Stendhal speaks of his romantic longings. In that essay Starobinski does not discuss Stendhal’s writings. Th e connection between the literary work and the psychology of the author is obscure; the critic, observed Starobinski, should investigate the space that separates them. Stendhal’s novels are imbued with eroticism, but the amo-rous encounters between his personages are always left to the reader’s imagi-nation. As a writer, Stendhal always abstained from voyeurism in a strict sense: but acoustic voyeurism, instead, as we have seen, was crucial to his narra-tive. Free, direct discourse had been used, occasionally, by Goethe in his"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 147Elective Affi nities, a novel which Stendhal read and loved, and to which he paid homage by making it the title of a chapter in Th e Red and the Black (book 1, chapter 7). But an element of psychology may have contributed to Stendhal’s systematic use of the pro cess.7. Stendhal reread Th e Red and the Black in 1834– 1835 with mixed feelings. He scrawled some comments on the manuscript of Lucien Leuwen. Among other things, he criticized “certain broken sentences, and the lack of those small words which assist the imagination of the benevolent reader to imagine what is happening.” Th e novel appeared to him “truthful, but dry”; the style, “too brusque, too disconnected”; “when I was writing it,” he remarked, “I was only concerned with the substance of things.”Stendhal, who usually wrote in a state of excitement, was incapable of re-vising his text. His dissatisfaction with the dryness of Th e Red and the Black seems to anticipate the more lavish style of Th e Charter house of Parma. But that “dryness” was the very point of an intellectual project which went back to Stendhal’s youth. On 29 March 1805, when he was in his twenties, he wrote in his diary:I feel the urge to show everyone a decorticated fi gure. Like a paint er who wants to attempt the style of Albani, and properly begins by studying anatomy, but then this, from useful instrument[,] becomes so satisfying that, instead of paint-ing a beautiful bosom for men’s plea sure, [he] depicts the exposed and bloody muscles in the breasts of a lovely woman; and so much more horrible is the result when one, instead, expected an agreeable object. A new disgust results from the veracity of the subjects presented. If they were not real it would be possible to ignore them, but they are real and they haunt the imagination.Tw e n t y - fi ve years later Prosper Mérimée wrote to Stendhal, who was one of his closest friends, to tell him what he thought of the recently published Th e Red and the Black. Mérimée repeated the meta phor used by the youthful Stendhal, which he may have heard during one of their conversations; but instead of identifying himself with the paint er, he put himself in the place of the horrifi ed public. In the fi rst part of the letter, now lost, Mérimée stated that someone had accused Stendhal of the most serious crimes: “that of hav-ing bared and exposed to the light of day certain sores of the human heart which are too disgusting to behold.”“Th is observation seemed fair to me,” Mérimée wrote. “Julien’s charac-ter possesses some atrocious traits; they are undoubtedly real, but they are"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"148 . stendhal’s challenge to historianshorrible just the same. It is not the purpose of art to shed light on these as-pects of human nature.” And Mérimée compared Th e Red and the Black to Swift’s Th e Lady’s Dressing Room, remarking: “You are full of these intolerable truths.”8. Mérimée’s comparison of Stendhal to Swift should not be taken literally. Th ere is nothing eschatological about Th e Red and the Black. What irritated Mérimée was Stendhal’s in de pen dent views about social conventions, and the impulse to lay them bare. But the juxtaposition with Swift needs to be examined further. In a marginal note on the manuscript of Mina de Vanghel, left unfi nished, Stendhal remarked that “in a novel, the description of uses and customs leaves us cold. We get the impression of an attempt to moralize. Description has to provoke astonishment, introduce a foreign woman who feels amazement, and transform the description into a sentiment.” Stendhal had already made use of this device. Julien Sorel, the son of a peasant, moves bewilderingly between the home of Madame de Rênal, the seminary, and the palace of the Marquis de la Mole. Stendhal was looking at contemporary French society from afar, through the eyes of a young man lacking experience and socially out of his depth. Mérimée shared Stendhal’s attraction for con-crete, ethnographic details: but the “bitter truth” of Th e Red and the Black was too much for him.Th e two friends diff ered greatly, as writers and as people. In an ironically aff ectionate sketch which appeared a few years after Stendhal’s death, Méri-mée wrote: “For his entire life he was enslaved by his imagination; he did everything without premeditation, with enthusiasm. He claimed he did ev-erything without reason. ‘In every thing one should let himself be guided by LO- GIC’ he used to say pausing between the fi rst syllable and the rest of the word. But he suff ered impatiently when the logic of others was not the same as his.”In this psychological trait, picked up intuitively by Mérimée, we see Sten-dhal’s twofold, contradictory connection with the Enlightenment and Roman-ticism, with rationality and with the emotions, with logic and with beliefs. Th is interlacing, as we perceive in the Vie d’Henry Brulard, was already present in the fourteen- year- old Stendhal. He had begun to study mathematics, and he was unable to understand how, multiplying negative numbers, one obtained a positive number. But the worst was yet to come:"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"stendhal’s challenge to historians . 149At the beginning of geometry it is said: “We give the name parallel to two lines which extended to infi nity, would never meet.” And from the very beginning of Statics, that beast of a Louis Monge more or less tells us this: “Two parallel lines can be considered as meeting, if we extend them to infi nity.” I thought I was read-ing a catechism, and, in fact, one of the most pointless. I asked M. Chabert [an-other mathematics instructor] for an explanation: Son, he said, assuming that paternal tone which does not well suit that foxy heir apparent, the air of Edouard Mounier [peer of France in 1836]— son, you shall know later. And the monster, drawing near the blackboard of waxed cloth, drew two parallel contiguous lines. See, he told me, that at the point of infi nity we can say that they meet. I was on the point of dropping everything. A confessor, a good and able Jesuit that moment could have converted me by commenting this maxim: See everything is in error, or, better, there is nothing which is false, nothing that is true, everything is con-vention. Adopt the convention which will make you more acceptable in this world. Th e populace is patriotic and will always soil this aspect of the question; turn yourself into an aristocrat like the members of your family and we shall fi nd the way to send you to Paris and recommend you to infl uential ladies. To say this with élan, I would have become a rogue and today, in 1836, I would be very rich.Looking back at this episode, Stendhal connected his own precocious passion for logic to his hate for the conventional. But what kept that scene alive for almost forty years in Stendhal’s memory must have been the discov-ery of a fl aw in Euclid’s geometry which had seemed to him as solid as a rock. Th is fi nding may have contributed to his enduring fascination with irrational phenomena— the passions, for instance— which reason must learn to analyze. Th e young Stendhal nurtured a great admiration for Pascal, whom he com-pared not only to Shakespeare but to himself: “When I read Pascal,” he wrote, “I have the impression I am reading myself. . . . I believe that among all the writers he is the one closest to my soul.” Th is claim (which seems to have passed unobserved) is less startling than it may appear at fi rst glance. To the simple provincials who inquired what his profession might be, Stendhal usu-ally replied, “Observer of the human heart.” He may have had in mind Pascal’s famous dictum “Th e heart has its reasons which reason does not know.” In a letter to his sister Pauline, to whom he was very close, Stendhal translated Pas-cal’s words in Montaigne’s Que sais- je: “I reread the Logique by de Tracy with great plea sure; I try to reason correctly to fi nd the right answer to this question: ‘What do I desire?’ ”In his Souvenirs d’égotisme Stendhal wrote: “We can know everything ex-cept ourselves.”"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"150 . stendhal’s challenge to historians9. Free direct discourse gives a voice to the isolation of Stendhal’s characters, to their ingenuous vitality defeated by a historical pro cess which overturns and humiliates their illusions. It is a pro cess which seems to be unavailable to historians because free direct discourse by defi nition leaves no documen-tary traces. We are in territory that lies beyond historical knowledge, and is inaccessible to it. But narrative pro cesses act like magnetic fi elds: they pro-voke questions and potentially attract documents. In this sense, a procedure such as free direct discourse, which came into being to respond, on the terrain of fi ction, to a number of historical questions, may be considered as an indi-rect challenge to historians. One day they may be able to confront it in ways which at this moment we cannot even imagine."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"1511. Th e present chapter concerns two texts and the relationship between them: the fi rst is known almost exclusively to scholars; the second has circulated throughout the world. Th e fi rst, Dialogue aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montes-quieu, appeared anonymously in Brussels in 1864. On the title page the un-named author, Maurice Joly, called himself “contemporary.” Th e following year he was identifi ed by the French police, tried, and sentenced to fi fteen months in prison for having written seditiously and off ensively against Na-poleon III. Th e Dialogue was promptly translated into German; in 1868 it was twice reprinted in Brussels, with the author’s name appearing. Following the collapse of the Second Empire, Joly, who was practicing law without great success, attempted a po liti cal career. After a violent confl ict with Jules Grévy, who for a time had been his patron, Joly found himself totally isolated. In 1878, not quite yet fi fty years of age, he committed suicide.A Spanish translation of the Dialogue aux Enfers appeared in Buenos Ai-res in 1898. Th en the book fell into oblivion, only to be rediscovered in 1921, when (as we shall see) it was identifi ed as the source for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the anti- Semitic pamphlet fi rst published in Rus sia in 1903.For a long time the miserable success of the Protocols, today more virulent than ever, has obscured the originality of the Dialogue aux Enfers. Recently, however, Joly’s book has been recognized, especially in France, as an impor-tant example of nineteenth- century po liti cal thought. It has even been called “a classic.” It seems appropriate to analyze the reasons for and implications of its late success.CHAPTER 11Representing the EnemyOn the French Prehistory of the Protocols"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"152 . french prehistory of the protocols2. In an autobiographical piece written in 1870 Joly described the genesis of his Dialogue:One eve ning, while walking on the terrace along the river near Pont Royal in bad weather suddenly the name of Montesquieu came to mind, as someone who would have been able to incarnate fully some of the ideas I wanted to express. But who could have been his interlocutor? I was struck by an idea: Machiavelli, of course! Machiavelli would have personifi ed the politics of force against Montes-quieu, who would have represented the policy of justice; and Machiavelli would have been Napoleon III describing his own abominable policies.Th e police and the judges who condemned Joly read the Dialogue aux Enfers in line with the author’s intentions. Th us, we could conclude that the meaning of the work is clear, free of any ambiguity. But a closer inspection brings out a diff erent and more complex story.Literary critics have long tried to teach us to look at writers’ intentions with skepticism. Obviously, to ignore them would be absurd, but, on the other hand, an author is not necessarily the best judge of his own work. Th e case of Maurice Joly is a perfect example of this.Th e fi rst thing to ask ourselves is to which literary or subliterary genre the Dialogue belongs. Th e passage we have just examined shows that Joly had in-tended to write a dialogue even before the names of Machiavelli and Montes-quieu crossed his mind. Th e idea had come to him while thinking of the Dia-logue sur le commerce des bleds, by Ferdinando Galiani, which had fi rst appeared anonymously in 1770 and was then reprinted many times. But the presumed connection between the two texts, recalled by everyone who commented on the Dialogue aux Enfers, is not convincing. In Galiani’s pamphlet, the knight Zanobi, who speaks for the author, carries on a discussion with two unidenti-fi ed persons, one of whom is known only by his initials. Joly’s allusion else-where to the Satyre Ménippée, the anti- Catholic pamphlet inspired by Lucian of Samosata that had appeared during the Wars of Religion, seems much more pertinent. Th e imaginary dialogue between two famous personages, Machia-velli and Montesquieu, immediately calls to mind the dialogues of the dead, made famous (if not actually invented) by Lucian of Samosata in the second century after Christ. As we shall see, this early attempt at contextualization highlights, rather than diminishes, the originality of Joly’s Dialogue.3. A genre is defi ned by a series of characteristics which imply at the same time restrictions and possibilities. In the past the characteristics were called"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"french prehistory of the protocols . 153“laws”— which, as happens to actual laws, can be broken or amended. In Lucian’s Dialogues of the Dead one encounters real persons next to mythical fi gures, such as in the comparison, inspired directly by Plutarch, between Hannibal and Alexander the Great (with Minos sitting in judgment and Scipio, who turns up at the end of the dialogue). But at the end of the seven-teenth century, Bernard Bovier de Fontenelle, in his Nouveaux dialogues des morts, eliminated the mythological fi gures and treated the real persons exclu-sively. By doing so he reinvented and modifi ed a genre which off ered him the possibility of emphasizing with ironic levity the superiority of the moderns over the ancients. Th is literary formula spread rapidly throughout Eu rope, from France to En gland, from Germany to Rus sia.Joly, who would have been well acquainted with Fontenelle’s Nouveaux dia-logues des morts, adopted the genre but treated it diff erently. Th e discussion in the underworld between Machiavelli and Montesquieu unfolds throughout twenty- fi ve dialogues, with the addition of an epilogue, written some years later and only recently reprinted as an appendix to the main text. Montes-quieu begins by recalling the ideas which he had formulated in the Esprit des lois, fi rst among which was the reciprocal autonomy of the three powers— legislative, executive, and judicial. Montesquieu is of the opinion that the tri-umph of this principle, which characterizes the modern Eu ro pe an states, is by now an accepted fact; but his information on recent history stops at 1847. With malignant plea sure Machiavelli brings Montesquieu up to date on what has transpired since then, delineating in a veiled manner more recent French happenings: the revolution of 1848 and its bloody aftermath; the coup d’état of 2 December 1851; the plebiscite and the proclamation of the Second Empire a year later. So, Machiavelli concludes, in one of the most progressive countries in Eu rope, torn by po liti cal and social tensions, one person (Louis Napoleon) has seized power by force, installing a new government which effi -ciently combines social peace and prosperity. It is the best solution to the fragile situation that threatens all modern societies, as Machiavelli explains in an eloquent apology for the regime of Napoleon III:I don’t see any salvation for such societies, veritable colossuses with feet of clay, except by instituting extreme centralization, placing all public power at the dis-posal of those who govern. What is needed is a hierarchical administration simi-lar to that of the Roman Empire, which regulated with machine- like precision all the movements of the individual. It calls for a vast system of legislation that takes back bit by bit all the liberties that had been imprudently bestowed— in sum a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"gigantic despotism that could strike immediately and at any time all who resist and complain. I think the Caesarism of the late Empire answers fairly well to what I would want for the well- being of modern societies. I have been told that such vast apparatuses already exist in more than one country in Eu rope, and thanks to them, these countries can live in peace, like China, Japan, and India. It’s only vul-gar prejudice that makes us look down on these oriental civilizations whose insti-tutions one learns to appreciate more every day. Th e Chinese, for example, are very good businessmen, and their lives are very well regulated.For the earliest readers of the Dialogue aux Enfers, Machiavelli’s words had an obvious meaning. In 1850 Auguste Romieu had coined the term Cae-sarism to defi ne a regime which was “the necessary result of a phase of extreme civilization . . . neither monarchy nor empire, neither despotism nor tyranny, but something peculiar that still is not well understood.” A year later Romieu wrote a pamphlet entitled Le spectre rouge de 1852 which presented the immi-nent coup d’état by Louis Napoleon as the only solution that might be able to avert a lower- class revolt. Romieu exalted force and eliminated disparagingly the concept of natural law: “I believe in social needs, not in natural laws. In my opinion the word LAW has no meaning at all, since there is nothing of the sort in nature. It is a mere human invention. . . .”On this point Joly’s Machiavelli mirrored Romieu: “All sovereign powers fi nd their origin in force, or, what is the same thing, in the negation of justice. . . . Don’t you see that this word—‘ justice’— is infi nitely vague?” But Joly’s Ma-chiavelli brutally associated “Caesarism” with a gigantic despotism. In eff ect this was a challenge directed at Montesquieu— the real one— who had seen in Oriental despotism the very antithesis of the progress incarnated in Eu ro pe an civilization. Joly must certainly have thought of Tocqueville’s bitter refl ec-tions on the future of demo cratic societies, in which a new form of servitude, “regulated, mild, calm,” might have been able to be joined with “some of the external forms of liberty . . . in the shadows of pop u lar sovereignty.” But Tocqueville still saw in the freedom of the press the strongest antidote against the ills of equality. Joly, instead, who had lived through the experience of the Second Empire, had no illusions on this point. According to his Machiavelli, the best future for modern society would be a form of despotism (we could call it Western despotism) which would leave intact the parliamentary system and freedom of the press: “One of my great principles,” says Joly’s Machiavelli, “is to set things against themselves. Just as I use the press against the press, I would use oratory to counter oratory. . . . In my Assembly, I will control nineteen 154 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"out of twenty men, all of whom will follow my instructions. In the mean-time, I would pull the strings of a sham opposition, clandestinely enlisted to my cause.”Th is strategy, observed his interlocutor, Montesquieu, will lead “to the annihilation of parties and the destruction of other collective forces,” even if po liti cal liberty will remain formally intact. Machiavelli declares himself in agreement. He proposes to use a similar strategy with the press:My scheme envisions neutralizing the press by the press itself. Because journalism wields such great power, do you know what my government will do? It will be-come like them. It will be journalism incarnate. . . . Like the god Vishnu, my press will have a hundred arms, and these arms will stretch out their hands throughout the country delicately giving form to all manner of opinion. Everyone will belong to my party without knowing it. Th ose who think they are speaking the language of their party will be acting for mine. Th ose who think they are marching under their own banner will be marching under mine. “Are these ideas possible or only wild fantasies? Th ey make the head swim,” murmured Montesquieu.4. Montesquieu, hammered by Machiavelli’s implacable logic, wavers bewil-dered between stupor and horror. Montesquieu is a man of the past; Ma-chiavelli is of the present and perhaps of the future. Th e paradoxical reversal of the placement in history of the two personages overturns the signifi cance that, from the time of Fontenelle, had often been attributed to the genre “dia-logues of the dead.” More generally it seems to liquidate the idea of progress. But Joly employs the dialogical form so subtly that it conceals his own attitude, to the point of rendering it almost indecipherable. When Joly states that he has cancelled himself out as author, perhaps he was affi rming more than the obvious literal meaning of the prudent decision not to exhibit his name on the title page of his Dialogue aux Enfers.As we recall, Joly declared retrospectively that the idea of bringing Mon-tesquieu onstage had made him think that Machiavelli “would be Napoleon III, describing his own abominable politics.” In quoting these words we have forgotten to mention what Joly had written a few lines earlier— namely, that he had thought of Montesquieu “as of someone who could have fully in-carnated an aspect of the ideas I wanted to express.” Just as Montesquieu did not incarnate all of Joly’s ideas, so Machiavelli did not incarnate all the ideas and policies of Napoleon III.A passage will demonstrate the truth of this statement. Machiavelli ex-plains to Montesquieu that the new constitution emerging from the coup french prehistory of the protocols . 155"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"d’état will be submitted to a pop u lar vote, which will accept or reject it in its entirety. Obviously, this is an allusion to the plebiscite of 2 December 1852 which made of Louis Napoleon an emperor legitimized by the electorate: a hybrid without pre ce dent in history. Machiavelli immediately rejects the example of America: we are in Eu rope, and the idea of discussing the consti-tution before voting on it would be absurd. “A constitution can only be the work of a single man. Th ings have never happened otherwise, as the histories of all the found ers of empire testify— Sesostris, Solon, Lycurgus, Char-lemagne, Frederick II, Peter the First, for example.”“You are about to expound upon a chapter from one of your disciples,” Montesquieu observes.“Who?” Machiavelli asks.“Joseph de Maistre,” Montesquieu replies. “Some general points you make are not without merit but I fi nd them inapplicable here.”Montesquieu is implicitly alluding to a passage from de Maistre’s Consi-dérations sur la France. In chapter 6, entitled “On divine infl uence in consti-tutions,” we read: “No mere assembly of men can form a nation, and the very attempt exceeds in folly the most absurd and extravagant things that all the Bedlams of the world might put forth.”In support of this scornful statement de Maistre cited in a note a passage taken from Machiavelli’s Discorsi sulla prima deca di Tito Livio (1:9): “. . . it is even necessary that he whose mind has conceived such a constitution should be alone in carry ing it into eff ect.” A bit later, in the same chapter of the Consi-dérations, de Maistre ironically compared Montesquieu to a pedantic poet, and Lycurgus, he who had given Sparta its laws, to Homer. Th us, in regard to con-stitutions de Maistre actually appealed to the authority of Machiavelli rather than Montesquieu, whom he considered an abstract theoretician, lacking a grip on reality.Joly shared this opinion, since on the matter of constitutions he cited the authority of the ultrareactionary de Maistre, not Montesquieu. A year be-fore the Dialogue aux Enfers, Joly published a book entitled Le barreau de Paris: Études politiques et littéraires, a series of general refl ections, mixed in with profi les, often written in a satirical tone, of lawyers, sometimes designated by pseudonyms. In a note to Le barreau de Paris Joly alluded disdainfully to the “folly of constitutions and to their incapacity to construct anything.” Im-mediately afterward he praised de Maistre, calling him an “author whose prophetic voice, at the beginning of the century, enjoyed undisputed author-156 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ity.” He cited approvingly several passages taken from de Maistre’s Essai sur le principe générateur des constitutions politiques et des autres institutions humaines which recalled the just- cited passage from the Considérations sur la France, including the reference to Machiavelli’s Discourses.Allow me to recapitulate this rather complicated discussion. I have con-trasted four books, two by de Maistre (Considérations sur la France and Essai sur le principe générateur des constitutions) and two by Joly (Le Barreau de Paris and Dialogue aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu). De Maistre’s fi rst book is cited in his second; both make an appearance, implicitly or explicitly, in Joly’s two books, written almost contemporaneously (readers of the Dia-logue aux Enfers will not have missed an allusion to that “machiavélisme in-fernal” in the Barreau de Paris). We can look at the four works as fragments of a whole. But if we place them side by side we notice an ambiguous fi gure emerging. Th e boundaries between invention and reality become less rigid: the imaginary Machiavelli develops ideas already proposed by the real de Maistre, who in turn advances arguments suggested by the real Machiavelli. Th e praise of de Maistre as one of the most “illustrious partisans” of the true Machiavelli, which Joly in his Dialogue aux Enfers puts in the mouth of Montesquieu, should be extended, in the fi nal analysis, even to the imaginary Machiavelli. Consequently, one might say that Joly has projected something of himself into both speakers of the dialogue. On the one hand, Joly shared Montesquieu’s liberal ideas; on the other, he presented Machiavelli’s arguments as the stron-ger ones, if not actually irrefutable. Th is painful disjuncture places the reader before a dialogue based on an unbridgeable chasm between ideals and reality, between desires and ideas: a tension that is just the opposite of self- consolatory thought.5. Joly felt undoubted hostility toward the regime of Napoleon III. But the Dialogue aux Enfers is much more than a polemical work. Joly attacked Louis Napoleon and his cynical use of power, but at the same time he tried to un-derstand a form of government that he viewed as unpre ce dented. Joly paid much more attention to the plebiscite of 2 December 1852 than to the coup d’état of 2 December 1851. Th e violence used by Louis Napoleon to crush his opposition was much less original than what followed: a hybrid jumble of police control and freedom of the press, of despotism and pop u lar legitimacy. To understand this novel situation (Joly implicitly says) requires the detached, unsentimental attitude of a modernized Machiavelli, not the illusions of a french prehistory of the protocols . 157"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Montesquieu. But in Machiavelli’s bitter foretelling of the more recent past there is no trace of that sense of triumph that one might expect from a spokes-man for Napoleon III. Joly’s Machiavelli is a much more complex fi gure, on which the true Machiavelli (especially as author of the Prince), Napoleon III, and Joly himself are superimposed, creating a composite portrait which re-calls the photographic experiments carried out just a few years later by Fran-cis Galton.Th e unfocused image created by Galton can suggest a visual equivalent to the ambiguity which permeates the Dialogue aux Enfers. In attempting to understand the Second Empire, Joly entered into a complex and ambivalent relationship with the personage who, under the name of Machiavelli, was intended to assume the role of Napoleon III. At the same time, however, the dialogical form permitted the author to keep a certain distance from the characters he had created. It is as if Joly were listening to himself, in the guise of Montesquieu, in the act of being aggressively criticized by himself in the guise of Machiavelli.Th e voice of this imaginary Machiavelli is the voice of the enemy. I shall not repeat here the celebrated words of Carl Schmitt about the enemy (hostis) who incarnates our questions. I prefer to recall a verse from Ovid (Metamor-phoses 4:428), perhaps familiar even to Joly: Nam et fas est ab hoste doceri—one must learn even from one’s enemy. Joly could have said: especially from the enemy, from whom we must learn the reasons for our defeat.6. Th e modern form of despotism, Joly wrote, includes free elections and freedom of the press. About either he certainly did not share the illusions of the liberals; in his eyes, true power resided elsewhere. In 1864, when the Dia-logue aux Enfers fi rst appeared, a statement of this sort would have seemed paradoxical to most readers. It seems much less so today. I agree with Winston Churchill, who said democracy is the worst form of government, with the ex-ception of all the others. But when in the United States, the greatest democ-racy in the world, only a small minority of its citizens exercise their right to vote in elections (a right which often is the extent of their participation in poli-tics), the self- legitimization of democracy is badly shaken. More doubtful yet is the capacity of voters to have an impact on the actual centers of power and on their decisions. At the dawn of the twenty- fi rst century the democracies appear to be much more powerful than they were a hundred and fi fty years earlier, when Joly published his analysis of modern despotism: their control 158 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"over society is much more sophisticated and effi cient; the power of the citi-zen, infi nitely diminished.All this sheds some light on the twentieth- century reception of the Dia-logue aux Enfers. During the 1920s and ’30s, as we shall see, it was discussed exclusively in terms of its connection with the Protocols. After World War II the Dialogue was published three times in France, four in Germany, twice in Spain, once each in Italy and in the United States. Some readers have seen in the Dialogue a clear foretelling of the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century. But the most recent French edition, reprinted in 1987, 1992, and 1999, presents the Dialogue in a diff erent light. For the author of the preface, Michel Bounan, it is “a po liti cal classic which exposed, a hundred years before its time, the true face of the modern despotism” which emerged from the ruins of the totalitarian regimes. Th is conclusion, further developed by Bounan in a se-ries of later essays, interprets Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers through the prism of its unforeseeable, distorted posthumous fate: the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. To express an opinion on Bounan’s views, we must fi rst examine the relation-ship between the two works.7. It has been said that in the world ranking of best sellers, the Protocols stand second, right after the Bible. Th is may be an exaggeration, but new editions of the Protocols appear yearly, in the Middle East, in Latin America, in Japan, in Eu rope; I recall seeing copies in the window of a bookstore in Budapest. Th e Protocols, we know, claim to be the proceedings of a secret meeting of a group of Jewish conspirators planning to infi ltrate society at every level: fi nance, publishing, the military, politics, and so forth. Th e conspiracy, if successful, would lead to a Jewish monarchy and world domination. Th e Protocols contain a translator’s postscriptum which explains that the text is an updated version of a plot that went back to Solomon and to the Wise Men of Zion in 929 b.c.Th e composition and extraordinary publishing history of the Protocols have been studied often and in depth. Here are the essential data. Th e basic facts are that the Protocols were published for the fi rst time in Rus sia in 1903; other Rus sian versions, with variants, appeared in the following years. But their worldwide circulation began only after the October revolution, an event that some of the reactionary press interpreted as a consequence of a Jewish conspiracy. Th e German translation of 1919 was greeted by the Times of Lon-don a year later as an important document and, thus, implicitly, believable. In 1921 Philip Graves, correspondent for this paper in Istanbul, wrote three french prehistory of the protocols . 159"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"articles demonstrating that the Protocols were a forgery. He showed that many passages borrowed closely from a book, then forgotten, that had appeared a century and a half earlier: Maurice Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu. Graves had learned of the connection between the two texts from someone he chose not to name, a Rus sian émigré later identifi ed as Mikhail Raslovlev. Although some of the “sources” of the Protocols had been ascertained earlier, Graves’s articles caused a sensation. Nevertheless, the booklet’s circulation continued without pause. Th e protonotary apostolic Mon-signor Ernest Jouin, who had translated it into French, commented: “It does not matter whether the Protocols are authentic; it is enough that they be true” (“Peu importe que les Protocoles soie nt aut he nt ique s; i l su ffi t qu’ils soient vrais”). Medieval clerics had fabricated their piae fraudes in the same spirit: forgeries inspired by true religion. When, in 1934, Jewish organizations in Switzerland brought legal action for libel against two local National Socialist offi cials who were circulating the Protocols as the confessed truth of the existence of a Jew-ish world conspiracy, the discussion once again focused on the passages from Joly’s Dialogue plagiarized in the Protocols.“Like the god Vishnu, my press will have a hundred arms,” says Joly’s Ma-chiavelli; “like the Indian idol Vishnu, we will have a hundred hands,” say the Elders of Zion, in a chapter of the Protocols urging the infi ltration of the publishing organs of every po liti cal stripe. Th e list of plagiarized material is endless. Whoever concocted the Protocols used the Dialogue aux Enfers as a model, frequently succumbing to some clumsiness or other, as we note in another chapter of the Protocols where the meta phor evoking Vishnu is re-peated. Th ere is a strong structural similarity between the strategies to control society that are proposed, respectively, by the Elders of Zion and by Joly’s Machiavelli: for example, the former say that anti- Semitism will end up strengthening the occult power of Jews, while the latter holds that the po liti cal opposition will end up serving as an instrument of the regime of Napoleon III. How can these similarities be explained?Until not so long ago it was thought that the Protocols had been assembled in France between 1894 and 1899. De Michelis’s aforementioned recent book Il manoscritto inesistente, on the basis of other internal elements, has sug-gested a diff erent thesis: the Protocols originated in Rus sia in 1902– 1903. But the work’s hypothetical Rus sian ancestry cannot easily be reconciled with the close dependence of the Protocols on Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers—a forgotten 160 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"text, diffi cult to come upon. De Michelis objects that the Dialogue was not at all “a practically forgotten text.” But to support this claim he can only point to the Spanish translation that had appeared, after thirty years of silence, in Buenos Aires in 1898. However, De Michelis, who considers Joly’s book a subtext of the Protocols, even going so far as to use the former to reconstruct the textual transmission of the latter, is then forced to suppose, if only in vague terms, that the authors of the forgery, presumably Rus sian, must have enjoyed a number of links with France, from which they would have obtained either Joly’s book or, at least, a host of excerpts taken from it. Th is potpourri would presumably have included passages from French authors such as Tarde or Chabry echoed in the Protocols.So now we are back in France. But can we really discover a French link tying Joly’s Dialogue to the Protocols? Curiously, De Michelis does not men-tion an attempt to reply to this question, admittedly conjectural but interest-ing, in a book which he correctly defi ned as the bedrock of the literature on the Protocols, L’Apocalypse de notre temps: Les dessous de la propagande alle-mande d’après des documents inédits, by Henri Rollin. Th is truly notable work, written by a nonacademic historian who worked for the French Secret Ser vices, appeared in 1939, immediately after the onset of World War II, and was reprinted in 1991. With remarkable intelligence and erudition Rollin re-constructed the context from which the Protocols had emerged, including the fact that in 1872 Joly, not surprisingly, had begun to collaborate with an ul-trarightist newspaper, La liberté. Among the journalists working there, one, Edouard Drumont, later became the spokesman of a particularly virulent anti- Semitism through books such as La France juive (1886) and the daily La libre parole, which he directed. Drumont mentioned Joly (“ce bon Jolly”), slightly distorting his name, in La France juive, as well as in his autobiography, entitled Le testament d’un antisémite (1891). In 1894, when the president of the French Republic, Sadi Carnot, was assassinated by an Italian anarchist, Drumont fl ed to Brussels, to avoid the consequences from some of his articles which contained vaguely pro- anarchist thoughts. In fact, Drumont success-fully combined themes of both Catholic and socialist anti- Semitism. In an interview appearing in Figaro on 18 July 1894 Drumont threatened to revive the anti- Napoleonic pamphlets which had circulated during the Second Em-pire: “We must prepare some new Propos de Labiénus,” he exclaimed. Th en, mentioning a large box: “Documents— authentic documents! Until now I french prehistory of the protocols . 161"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"have kept silent inspired by compassion or Christian charity. I have fought a war by the rules. But if an unjust law will turn us into outlaws, I shall declare a war without mercy.” Rollin supposes that Drumont had discovered the Dia-logue aux Enfers, written by his former colleague, Joly. To be sure, the book would have been easier to stumble upon in Brussels, where it had been pub-lished, than in Paris. Especially telling is Drumont’s allusion to “some new Propos de Labiénus,” a satire against Napoleon III which had appeared the year before. It was presented in the form of an imaginary dialogue between two ancient Romans and was obviously inspired by Joly’s Dialogue. On 10 January 1896 Drumont once again raised in the pages of La libre parole the pos-sibility of writing a “gracious pamphlet” which would have been a continuation of the Propos de Labiénus. Ten days later he mentioned this again: “If the Dia-logues of the Dead were still fashionable. . . .” Th ese things do not prove that Drumont had adopted the Dialogue aux Enfers as a potentially anti- Semitic work, presenting an invented text as if it were a real document; nor does it prove that Drumont had passed Joly’s text to someone in Rus sia, who came up with the Protocols. But the Drumont trail, suggested by Rollin, deserves to be examined further. In 1898, the “Jewish year,” as Drumont bitterly wrote as the year drew to an end, a series of dramatic events suddenly reopened the Dreyfus aff aire. Th e document used to prove the guilt of Dreyfus turned out to be a forgery; Col o nel Henry, imprisoned as the author of the falsifi cation, killed himself. At this point Drumont went on the attack. La libre parole announced a great subscription to raise funds for a monument to Col o nel Henry, a man who naively, Drumont wrote, had committed a stupidity which was infi nitely less serious than the “infamous means employed by Jews to enrich themselves and become our masters.” Shortly after, on 26 February 1899, La libre parole pub-lished on its front page an article signed “Gyp.” Th e pseudonym concealed the identity of Sibylle Gabrielle Marie Antoinette, countess of Mirabeau- Martel, celebrated author of dazzling ultranationalist and anti- Semitic writings. Th e article, entitled “L’aff aire chez les morts,” grotesquely evoked the genre of “dia-logues of the dead” which had inspired Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers. Gyp por-trayed Calvin, Joan of Arc, Catherine de’ Medici, Voltaire, Napoleon, Gav-roche in the act of insulting and assaulting Moses, Jeremiah, Mayer Rothschild, Jacques de Reinach— all of whom spoke French with a German accent. It was a vulgar joke which, when read today, has a sinister, prophetic ring. “I have been so criticized over the course of history,” says Catherine de’ Medici, “and yet if there had been a Jewish St. Bartholomew’s I would not be at all sur-162 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"prised.” Th e Protocols, based on Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers, a book which was no longer read, must have originated in this climate, and perhaps during these very months.8. But the similarity between Joly’s Dialogue and the Protocols also needs to be discussed from a perspective that touches the present directly. Th e Dialogue contains a single hostile allusion to Jews, in a passage borrowed by the Protocols (but where the mention of Jews has been dropped). But this single point of convergence has little importance. Much more relevant, and disturbing, is the general conformity between the two texts for anyone who accepts the notion that Joly, through his analysis of the Second Empire, conceived as an example of “modern despotism,” succeeded in revealing a long- standing phenomenon which in diverse forms has come down to our own day. If this is how things are, how should we interpret the Protocols? As a caricature? Michel Bounan has come up with a diff erent notion: the Protocols were “a police forgery of a revolutionary tu-mult.”  Such a view seems to presuppose the famous defi nition by August Bebel—“antisemitism is the socialism of imbeciles”— but it goes well beyond it. According to Bounan, the real conspiracy which inspired the false one— the Protocols— is a classic example of a characteristic which earmarks the system de-scribed by Joly: “An occult and permanent plot of the modern state intended to maintain subjection indefi nitely” (but Bounan uses, perhaps deliberately, de Tocqueville’s harsher term: servitude).Little is known of Michel Bounan’s life. From a few hints in his writings, and from a bit of information on the Internet, we are informed that he had been close to Guy Debord and to the Situationists, that small band which played a leading role in the Pa ri sian rebellion of May ’68. Today, Bounan seems to be the key fi gure in a small publishing house which has reprinted two books important to the present research, Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers and Rollin’s L’Apocalypse de notre temps. In a number of elegant articles explicitly inspired by these works, Bounan has developed a coherent vision of history as conspiracy. In modern societies power pervades everything; everyone’s energies (with the exception of those of a small privileged elite) are derailed by false conspiracies and false designs; even the feeling of being the victims of injustice has been cancelled out by the awareness of the victims— in other words, of everyone. Bounan’s most recent pamphlet, Logique du terrorisme, published in 2003, examines the events of the last few years from this perspective.french prehistory of the protocols . 163"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"I have never subscribed to that rather widespread notion which automati-cally disqualifi es as absurd all explanatory theories based on conspiracy.

But as I tried to bring out some time ago in a book on the ste reo type of the witches’ Sabbath, conspiracies exist, and false conspiracies often conceal true ones (an observation that Bounan also makes). After the events of 11 September 2001 in America, to which we could add oth-ers, including 11 March 2004 in Madrid, the idea that conspiracies actually exist encounters less re sis tance. But I am well aware that the attempts to iden-tify false plots that may conceal real ones may lead, at the very least, to wild conclusions. Is it possible to trace a dividing line between a healthy skepticism toward certain offi cial versions and a conspiratorial obsession? In my opinion, Bounan transgressed that boundary, letting himself be guided by that destruc-tive principle is fecit cui prodest, which retroactively transforms, illogically, an achieved end into a causal relationship. Th e fact that a government used the po liti cal prospects created by a terrorist attack to make war on another coun-try does not prove that the attack had been concocted by that government. One might say that Bounan has been hypnotized by the subject of his re-search, the Protocols, and by their source, Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers. Still, it is not suffi cient to reject a conspiratorial view of history because it is an inverse version of the Protocols. To clarify this point, we must return once more to what connects the two books.Joly fi nished by paying a price for using the literary form on which his ideas were constructed. Th e Machiavelli of the Dialogue aux Enfers describes in detail, in the fi rst person, the po liti cal strategies he will adopt, thereby giving the impression that reality (which has already occurred) will only be able to conform to his wishes. Fleeting allusions to vast anonymous phenomena, such as the fragility of modern societies, are immediately dropped. Imagin-ing an omnipotent individual who models society in accordance with his own wishes, Joly involuntarily made possible the deplorable, posthumous fortune of the Dialogue aux Enfers. Th e compilers of the Protocols poured the materials from Joly’s work into a preexistent mold, the delusional Jewish conspiracy. But elements which were part of the formal model used by Joly also contributed to this transformation. Any trace of ambiguity vanished, and a polished po liti cal parable was turned into a crude falsifi cation.164 . french prehistory of the protocols"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"1651. On 16 May 1348, the Jewish community of La Baume, a small Provençal village, was exterminated. Th is event was just one link in a long chain of vio-lence which had started in southern France with the fi rst eruption of the Black Death just one month before. Th e hostilities against the Jews, who were widely believed to have spread the plague by poisoning wells, fountains, and rivers, had fi rst crystallized in Toulon during Holy Week. Th e ghetto had been assaulted; men, women, and children had been killed. In the follow-ing weeks similar violence took place in other towns in Provence— Riez, Digne, Manosque, and Forcalquier. In La Baume there was a single survivor, a man who ten days before had departed for Avignon, summoned by Queen Jeanne. He left an emotional recollection of the episode in a few lines written in a copy of a Torah now preserved in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. In an excellent essay Joseph Schatzmiller, by combining a new read-ing of the passage inscribed in the Torah with a document extracted from a fi scal register, has succeeded in identifying the survivor: Dayas Quinoni. In 1349 Quinoni had settled in Aix, where he had received his Torah. We do not know if he ever went back to La Baume after the massacre.Let us turn briefl y to a diff erent, though not unrelated, case. Th e accusa-tions against Jews in 1348 that they had spread the plague closely imitated a pattern which had been established a generation before. In 1321, during Holy Week, a rumor suddenly spread throughout France and some neighboring regions (western Switzerland, northern Spain). According to the diff erent versions, lepers, or lepers infl uenced by Jews, or lepers urged on by Jews CHAPTER 12Just One WitnessTh e Extermination of the Jews and the Principle of Realityfor primo levi"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"166 . extermination of the jews and realityinspired by the Muslim kings of Tunis and Granada, had concocted a plot to poison Christians. Th e Muslim kings were obviously out of reach, but for two years lepers and Jews became the targets of violent acts by mobs but also by religious and po liti cal authorities. I have tried elsewhere to disentangle this complex muddle of events. Here I would just like to analyze a passage from a Latin chronicle written in the early fourteenth century by the so- called continuator of William of Nangis, an anonymous monk who, like his pre de ces sor, lived in the convent of Saint- Denis.Many Jews were killed, most of them in northern France, after the discov-ery of the alleged conspiracy. Near Vitry- le- François, according to the chroni-cler, approximately forty Jews were confi ned in a tower. To avoid perishing at the hands of the Christians they decided, after long deliberations, to take their own lives. Th e execution of the deed was to be carried out by an elder who enjoyed great authority among them, and a youth. Th e older man then asked the younger man to kill him. Th e latter reluctantly did so but then, instead of committing suicide himself, took the gold and silver from the pockets of the bodies on the ground. He then tried to escape from the tower by knotting sheets together as a rope, but it was not long enough and the young man fell to the ground, broke a leg, and was subsequently put to death.Th e episode is not implausible. However, it resembles closely two pas-sages from Flavius Josephus’s Th e Jewish War. Th e fi rst passage (3:8) speaks of forty persons who, after hiding in a cave near Jotapata in Galilee, all com-mit suicide, with two exceptions: Josephus himself and a fellow soldier who agrees not to kill him. Th e second passage describes the celebrated siege of Masada, the desperate re sis tance of the Jews who had taken refuge inside the fortress, followed by a collective suicide, here also with two exceptions, both women (7:8– 9). How should we explain the analogies between Josephus’s texts and the aforementioned passage in the chronicle by William of Nangis? Should we assume a factual convergence or, on the contrary, the presence of a historio-graphical topos (which in the more recent version also included an allusion to another topos, Jewish greed)?Th e hypothesis of a historiographical topos has already been cautiously formulated in regard to Josephus’s reconstruction of the events at Masada. Flavius Josephus’s work, either in Greek or in the famous Latin version pre-pared under the direction of Cassiodorus, circulated widely in the Middle Ages, especially in northern France and Flanders (if we can judge from the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 167many extant manuscripts). Although we know that Flavius Josephus was man-datory reading during Lent at the monastery of Corbie c. 1050, his works are not included in a fourteenth- century list of required books for the monks of Saint- Denis, among whom was, as we have seen, the continuator of William of Nangis. Moreover, we have no direct proof that manuscripts of Josephus’s Jewish War existed in the library of Saint- Denis at all. But the anonymous chronicler could have consulted them without diffi culty: among the many man-uscripts housed in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris there is one (a twelfth- century copy) from the library of Saint- Germain- des- Prés. We c a n c o nc lu d e that the continuator of William of Nangis could have been familiar with Fla-vius Josephus’s Jewish War (or its fourth- century adaptation known as “Hege-sippus”). But it does not necessarily follow from this that the collective sui-cide near Vitry- le- François never took place. More work is needed on this question, although it may be impossible to reach a defi nitive conclusion.2. Th ese events dating back to a distant and largely forgotten past are con-nected by myriad threads to the theme expressed in the subtitle of this chap-ter. Pierre Vidal- Naquet was acutely aware of this when he decided to repub-lish, in two essays in the same volume (Les juifs, la mémoire, le présent, Paris, 1981), “Flavius Josephus and Masada” and “A Paper Eichmann,” a detailed discussion of the so- called revisionist school which claims that the Nazi ex-termination camps never existed. Th e similarity of content— the persecu-tion of Jews in the Middle Ages, the extermination of Jews in the twentieth century— is less important, in my opinion, than the similarity in the theo-retical issues posed in both cases. Let me try to explain why.Th e analogies between the two passages from Josephus, describing the Jotapata and Masada episodes, concern, in addition to the collective suicide, the survival of two people: Josephus and his fellow soldier in the fi rst case, the two women in the second. Th e survival of at least one person was logi-cally required by the necessity to provide a witness, but why two? I think that the well- known rejection of a single witness in court, shared by the Jewish and Latin legal traditions, explains the choice of two witnesses. Both traditions were familiar, of course, to Flavius Josephus, a Jew who became a Roman citi-zen. Later, the emperor Constantine transformed the rejection of the single witness into a formal law, later included in the Justinian Code. In the Middle Ages the implicit reference to Deuteronomy 19:15, Non stabit testis unus contra"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"168 . extermination of the jews and realityaliquem (“A single witness shall not prevail against a man”), became testis unus, testis nullus (“one witness, no witness”), a recurring maxim, implicitly or explic-itly, in trial rec ords and the legal literature.Let us try to imagine for a moment what would happen if such a crite-rion were applied to the fi eld of historical research. Our knowledge of the events which took place at La Baume in May 1348, near Vitry- le- François sometime during the summer of 1321, and in the cave near Jotapata in July a.d. 67 is based, in each case, on a single, more or less direct witness. Th at is, respectively, the person (identifi ed as Dayas Quinoni) who wrote the lines in the Torah now in the National Library in Vienna, the continuator of William of Nangis, and Flavius Josephus. No sensible historian would dismiss this evidence as intrinsically unacceptable. According to normal historiographical practice, the value of each document will have to be tested by way of comparison— that is, by constructing a series including at least two documents. But let us assume for a moment that the continuator of William of Nangis, in his account of the collective suicide near Vitry- le- François, was merely echoing Josephus’s Jewish War. Even if the supposed collective suicide should evaporate as a fact, the account itself would still give us a valuable piece of evidence about the reception of Josephus’s work (which is also, except to an inveterate positivist, a “fact”) in early fourteenth- century Île- de- France.Law and history, it seems, have diff erent rules and diff erent epistemologi-cal foundations which do not always coincide. Consequently, legal principles cannot be transposed in their entirety into historical research. Such a conclusion would seem to contradict the close contiguity stressed by such sixteenth- century scholars as François Baudouin, the legal historian who solemnly declared that “historical studies must rest on a solid legal founda-tion, and jurisprudence must be joined to history.” From a diff erent per-spective, related to antiquarian research, the Jesuit Henri Griff et, in his Tr a i t é des diff erentes sortes de preuves qui servent à établir la verité de l’histoire (1769), compared the historian to a judge testing the reliability of diff erent witnesses.Such an analogy today has a defi nitely unfashionable ring. Many histo-rians would probably react with a certain embarrassment to the crucial word preuves, “proofs,” in Griff et’s title. But some recent discussions show that the connection among proofs, truth, and history cannot be easily dismissed."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 1693. I have mentioned “A Paper Eichmann,” the essay that Pierre Vidal- Naquet wrote to refute the notorious thesis, advanced by Robert Faurisson and oth-ers, that Nazi extermination camps never existed. Th is essay has been re-published in a small volume, Les assassins de la mémoire, which Vidal- Naquet dedicated to his mother, who died at Auschwitz in 1944. It is not diffi cult to imagine the moral and po liti cal motives which drove him to engage in a de-tailed discussion, involving, among other things, a punctilious analysis of the evidence (witnesses, technological possibilities, and so on) concerning the gas chambers. Other, more theoretical implications have been spelled out by Vidal- Naquet in a letter to Luce Giard which was included in a volume in memory of Michel de Certeau which appeared a few years ago. Vidal- Naquet writes that the collection of essays, L’écriture de l’histoire, published by de Cer-teau in 1975, was an important book which contributed to the dismantling of historians’ proud innocence: “Since then, we have become aware that the his-torian writes; that he produces space and time, being himself intrinsically embedded in a specifi c space and time.” But we should not dismiss, Vidal- Naquet goes on, that old notion of “reality,” meaning “precisely what hap-pened,” as evoked by Ranke a century ago.I became very conscious of all this when the aff aire Faurisson, which unfortu-nately continues, began. Naturally, Faurisson is the antithesis of de Certeau. Th e former is a crude materialist, who, in the name of the most tang ible reality, trans-forms everything he deals with— pain, death, the instruments of death— into something unreal. De Certeau was deeply aff ected by this perverse folly, and wrote me a letter about it . . . I was convinced that there was an ongoing discus-sion on gas chambers, that everything should necessarily pass through discourse [mon sentiment était qu’il y avait un discours sur les chambres à gaz, que tout devait passer par le dire]; but beyond this, or rather, before this, there was something irreducible which, for better or worse, I shall continue to call reality. Without this reality, how can we tell the diff erence between fi ction and history? In the United States the question regarding the diff erence between fi c-tion and history usually seems to spring from the work of Hayden White, or, at least, is associated with it. Th at there are diff erences in the historiographi-cal practices of the two writers is obvious: but it cannot be denied that there is a certain convergence between White’s Metahistory (1973) and de Certeau’s L’écriture de l’histoire (1975, but which includes essays published earlier). To fully comprehend Hayden White’s contribution, it seems essential to sketch out fi rst his intellectual biography."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"170 . extermination of the jews and reality4. In 1959, introducing to an American audience the translation of Dallo storicismo alla sociologia, by Carlo Antoni, one of Benedetto Croce’s closest fol-lowers, White spoke of Croce’s youthful essay “La storia ridotta sotto il con-cetto generale dell’arte,” (“History subsumed under a general concept of the arts”) as a “revolutionary” contribution. Th e signifi cance of this essay, pub-lished in 1893 when the author was twenty- seven years old, had already been emphasized by Croce himself in his intellectual autobiography (Cont r ibuto al l a critica di me stesso) (“Contribution to a critique of myself ”), as well as later by R. G. Collingwood (Th e Idea of History). Not surprisingly, the chapter on Croce in Metahistory includes a detailed discussion of “La storia ridotta.” But at a distance of sixteen years White’s appreciation of this essay had cooled con-siderably. He declared that he still agreed with certain crucial statements in Croce’s essay, such as the sharp distinction between historical research, deemed a purely propaedeutic activity, and history proper, equated with narrative his-tory. But then he concluded in this vein:It is diffi cult not to think of Croce’s “revolution” in historical sensibility as a ret-rogression, since its eff ect was to sever historiography from any participation in the eff ort— just beginning to make some headway in sociology at the time— to construct a general science of society. But it had even more deleterious implica-tions for historians’ thinking about the artistic side of their work. For, while Croce was correct in his perception that art is a way of knowing the world, and not merely a physical response to it or an immediate experience of it, his concep-tion of art as literal repre sen ta tion of the real eff ectively isolated the historian as artist from the most recent— and increasingly dominant— advances made in repre-senting the diff erent levels of consciousness by the Symbolists and Post- Impressionists all over Eu rope.Th is passage already points to some elements of Hayden White’s later work. Since writing Metahistory he has become interested less and less in the construction of a “general science of society,” and more and more “in the ar-tistic side of the historian’s work ”— a shift not far removed from Croce’s long battle against positivism, which inspired, among other things, his scorn to-ward the social sciences. But in Metahistory Croce had already ceased to be the crucial infl uence he had been in the early stages of White’s intellectual development. Undoubtedly his esteem of Croce remained high, and he con-tinued to defi ne him as “the most talented historian of all the phi los o phers of history of the century”; even on the last page of the book he is warmly praised for his allegedly “ironical” attitude. But the global evaluation cited above"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 171testifi es to the existence of signifi cant disagreement with Croce’s theoretical perspective.Th e principal motive for White’s dissatisfaction with Croce’s thought hinged, as we have seen, on his “conception of art as a literal repre sen ta tion of the real”— in other words, on his “realistic” attitude. Th e term, which in this context has a cognitive and not merely aesthetic meaning, may sound a bit paradoxical when applied to a neo- idealist phi los o pher like Croce. But the latter’s idealism was of a rather special sort: the term “critical positivism,” as applied to him by a highly discerning critic of his work, seems more ap-propriate. Th e most distinctly idealistic phase of Croce’s thought has to be traced back to the strong infl uence exerted over him by Giovanni Gentile, to whom he was linked for two de cades by a close intellectual bond. In a note added to his Logica come scienza del concetto puro (“Logic as the science of pure concept”) (1909) Croce traced a retrospective reconstruction of his own intel-lectual development, moving from his “La storia ridotta” to the recent recog-nition of the identity between history and philosophy achieved under the in-fl uence of Gentile (“my very dear friend . . . to whose help and stimulation my intellectual life owes much”). Some years later, however, the intrinsic ambi-guities of this identity (as well as, on a general level, of the alleged theoretical convergence between Croce and Gentile) emerged fully. Croce, by interpret-ing philosophy as “the methodology of history,” seemed to be dissolving the former in the latter. Gentile moved in the opposite direction. “Ideas without facts are empty,” he wrote in 1936 in his Il superamento del tempo nella storia (“Th e overcoming of time in history”); “philosophy which is not history is the vainest abstraction. But facts are simply the life of the objective moment of self- consciousness, outside of which there is no real constructive thought.” He emphasized that history (re s g e st a e) “must not be a presupposition of historiog-raphy (historia rerum gestarum).” Gentile vigorously rejected “the metaphysical theory of history (or historicism) based directly on the idea that historical writ-ing presupposes historical fact, an idea as absurd as those of other metaphysics, and pregnant with worse consequences; for no enemy is so dangerous as one who has managed to creep into your house and hide there.”By identifying that unnamed “metaphysical theory of history” with “his-toricism,” Gentile was reacting to a polemical anti- Fascist essay by Croce, “Antistoricismo,” which had just appeared. Th e theoretical core of Gentile’s essay went back to his Teoria generale dello spirito come atto puro (1918), a re-sponse to Croce’s Teoria e storia della storiografi a (1915). But by 1924 the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"172 . extermination of the jews and realityphilosophical dispute between the two old friends had transformed itself into a bitter po liti cal and personal feud.Th is apparent digression was required to clarify the following points:a. Hayden White’s intellectual development can be understood only by considering his exposure, at an early stage of his career, to Italian philosophical neo- idealism.b. White’s “tropological” approach, suggested in Tropics of Discourse, his 1978 collection of essays, still showed the impact of Croce’s thought. In 1972 White had written that Crocemoved from his study of the epistemological bases of historical knowledge to a position in which he sought to subsume history under a general concept of art. His theory of art, in turn, was constructed as a “science of expression and general linguistics” (the subtitle of his Aesthetics). In his analysis of the linguistic bases of all possible modes of comprehending reality, he came closest to grasping the es-sentially tropological nature of interpretation in general. He was kept from for-mulating this near perception, most probably, by his own “ironic” suspicion of system in any human science.Such an approach started from Croce but then proceeded in a totally dif-ferent direction. When we read that “tropics is the pro cess by which all dis-course constitutes [the emphasis is in the text] the objects which it pretends to describe realistically and to analyze objectively” (a passage from the intro-duction to Tropics of Discourse [1978]), we recognize the aforementioned criticism of Croce’s “realism.”c. Th is subjectivist stand was certainly reinforced by White’s encounter with the work of Michel Foucault. But it is signifi cant that White tried to “decode” Foucault through Giovanbattista Vico, the alleged founding father of Italian philosophical neo- idealism. In fact, White’s statement about discourse creating its own objects seems to be echoing— with a major diff erence discussed immediately below— Croce’s emphasis on expression and general linguistics combined with Gentile’s extreme subjectivism, according to which historiography (historia rerum gestarum) creates its own object: history (re s g e st a e). “Le fait n’a jamais qu’une existence linguistique” (“A fact never has anything but a linguistic existence”): these words by Roland Barthes, used by White as an epi-graph for Th e Content of the Form (1987), could be ascribed to this"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 173imaginary combination of Croce and Gentile to which I have just alluded. Even White’s reading of Barthes in the early eighties (he was still barely mentioned in Tropics of Discourse) reinforced a preexisting pattern.5. Th ere is a questionable element in this reconstruction— namely, the role attributed to Gentile. As far as I know, White never studied his writings or even mentioned him (with one relevant exception, as we shall see). But famil-iarity with Gentile’s work can be safely assumed in a scholar such as White, who, through Carlo Antoni, had been introduced to the philosophical tradition of Italian neo- idealism. (On the other hand, a direct knowledge of Gentile’s work must be ruled out in the case of Barthes. Th e crucial role played by Barthes in de Certeau’s intellectual development can explain, but only to a certain extent, the partial convergence between the latter and Hayden White.)Gentile’s close association with Fascism, right up to his violent death, has somewhat darkened, at least outside Italy, the fi rst phase of his philosophical career. His adherence to Hegelian idealism resulted from a fi rsthand reading of Marx’s early philosophical writings (La fi losofi a di Marx, 1899). In his analysis of Marx’s Th eses on Feuerbach, Gentile interpreted Marxist praxis through Vico’s famous dictum verum ipsum factum, or rather through the neo- idealistic interpretation of it. Praxis, therefore, was regarded as a concept implying the correspondence between subject and object, insofar as the Spirit (the transcendental subject) creates reality. Even Gentile’s much later state-ment on historiography creating history was just a corollary to this principle. Th e pre sen ta tion of Marx as a fundamentally idealistic phi los o pher had a lasting impact on Italian intellectual and po liti cal life. To be sure, Antonio Gramsci, by using an expression such as “philosophy of praxis,” instead of “historical materialism,” in his Prison Notebooks, was obviously trying to circumvent Fascist censorship. But he was also echoing the title of Gentile’s second essay on Marx (“La fi losofi a della praxis”) as well as, more signifi -cantly, Gentile’s emphasis on “praxis” as a concept which diminished materi-alism, almost to the point of eliminating it, as a crucial element in Marxist thought. Other echoes of Gentile’s interpretation of Marx have been de-tected in Gramsci’s early idealistic Marxism. It has been proposed that even the well- known passage in the Prison Notebooks suggesting that Gentile’s philosophy is closer to Futurism than Croce’s implied a favorable opinion of Gentile: had not Futurism been regarded by Gramsci in 1921 as a revolution-ary movement which had been able to respond to a need for “new forms of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"174 . extermination of the jews and realityart, of philosophy, of behavior, of language”?  A similar closeness between Gentile’s philosophy and Futurism, both seen as negative examples of “antihis-toricism,” had instead been implicitly suggested by Croce in a liberal- conservative anti- Fascist perspective.In light of a left- wing reading of Gentile’s work (or at least of part of it), the quasi- Gentilian fl avor detectable in Hayden White’s writings beginning with Th e Burden of History— his 1966 plea for a new historiography written in a modernist key— sounds less paradoxical. One can easily understand the impact (as well as the intrinsic weakness) of this attack launched against liberal and Marxist orthodoxies. In the late 1960s and early ’70s subjectivism, even in an extreme form, had a defi nitely radical fl avor. But if one regarded desire as a left- wing slogan, then reality (including the emphasis on “real facts”) would have looked defi nitely right- wing. Such a simplistic, not to mention self- defeating, view has largely been superseded— in the sense that attitudes implying a basic fl ight from reality are certainly not restricted today to a few factions of the left. Th is should be taken into account in any attempt to ex-plain the rather extraordinary appeal of contemporary skeptical ideologies, even outside the academic world. In the meantime Hayden White has de-clared that he is “against revolutions, whether launched from ‘above’ or ‘ below’ in the social hierarchy.”  Th is statement was elicited, he explains in a foot-note, by the fact that “the relativism with which I am usually charged is con-ceived by many theorists to imply the kind of nihilism which invites revolu-tionary activism of a particularly irresponsible sort. In my view, relativism is the moral equivalent of epistemological skepticism; moreover, I conceive rela-tivism to be the basis of social tolerance, not a license to ‘do as you please.’ ” Skepticism, relativism, tolerance: at fi rst the distance between this self- presentation of White’s thought and Gentile’s theoretical perspective seems as though it could not be greater. Gentile’s attacks against positivist histori-ans did not have skeptical implications, since his philosophical position im-plied a transcendental Spirit, not a multiplicity of empirical subjects. He was never a relativist; on the contrary, he strongly advocated a religious com-mitment, intransigent in both philosophical and po liti cal matters. And, of course, he never theorized tolerance, as his support of Fascism— including squadrismo, its most violent aspect— shows. Th e notorious statement de-scribing the truncheons of the punitive squads as a “moral force” comparable to preaching— a remark Gentile made during a speech in the 1924 electoral campaign— was consistent with his strictly monistic theory: in a reality"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 175created by the Spirit there is no place for a real distinction between facts and values.Th ese are not minor theoretical divergences. Any argument suggesting intellectual contiguity between Gentile’s and White’s approaches must ac-count for these major diff erences. So we may wonder on what ground White stresses, in his article “Th e Politics of Historical Interpretation,” that his own historical perspective shares something with “the kind of perspective on history . . . conventionally associated with the ideologies of Fascist regimes,” whose “social and po liti cal policies” he simultaneously rejects as “undeniably horrible.”6. Th is contradiction, so clearly perceived, leads us to the moral dilemma implicit in White’s approach. “We must guard,” he says, “against a sentimen-talism that would lead us to write off such a conception of history simply be-cause it has been associated with Fascist ideologies. One must face the fact that when it comes to apprehending the historical record, there are no grounds to be found in the historical record itself for preferring one way of constructing its meaning over another.” No grounds? In fact, in discussing Faurisson’s views on the extermination of Jews, White does not hesitate to suggest a criterion according to which we must judge the validity of confl icting historical interpre-tations. Let us look at his argument.White’s above- mentioned statement is based (1) on the distinction (even better, disjunction) between “ ‘positive’ historical inquiry” and “proper history”— that is, narrative— advocated by Croce in La storia ridotta; and (2) on a skep-tical interpretation of this distinction, converging in many ways with Gen-tile’s transcendental subjectivism. Both elements can be detected in White’s reaction to the refutation, provided by Vidal- Naquet “on the terrain of posi-tive history,” of Faurisson’s “lies” about the extermination of Jews. Faurisson’s claim is as “morally off ensive as intellectually bewildering”; but the notion of a “lie,” insofar as it implies concepts such as “reality” and “proof,” is clearly a source of embarrassment for White, as this remarkably twisted sentence shows: “Th e distinction between a lie and an error or a mistake in interpreta-tion may be more diffi cult to draw with historical events less amply docu-mented than the Holocaust.” In fact, even in this latter case White is unable to accept Vidal- Naquet’s conclusion, suggesting that there is a big diff erence “between an interpretation that would ‘have profoundly transformed the real-ity of the massacre’ and one that would not. Th e Israeli interpretation leaves"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"176 . extermination of the jews and realitythe ‘reality’ of the events intact, whereas the revisionist interpretation dereal-izes it by redescribing it in such a way as to make it something other than what the victims know the Holocaust to have been.” Th e Zionist historical interpretation of the Holocaust, White says, is not a contre- verité (as has been suggested by Vidal- Naquet) but a truth: “its truth, as a historical interpreta-tion, consists precisely in its eff ectiveness in justifying a wide range of current Israeli po liti cal policies that, from the standpoint of those who articulate them, are crucial to the security and indeed the very existence of the Jewish people.” In the same way, “the eff ort of the Palestinian people to mount a po-liti cally eff ective response to Israeli policies entails the production of a simi-larly eff ective ideology, complete with an interpretation of their history capa-ble of endowing it with a meaning that it has hitherto lacked.” We c a n conclude that if Faurisson’s narrative were ever to prove eff ective, it would be regarded by White as true as well.Is this conclusion the result of a tolerant attitude? As we have seen, White argues that skepticism and relativism can provide the epistemological and moral foundations for tolerance. But this claim is historically and logically untenable. Historically, because tolerance has been theorized by people who had strong intellectual and moral convictions (Voltaire’s assertion “I will fi ght in order to defend my opponent’s freedom to speak” is typical). Logically, be-cause absolute skepticism would contradict itself if it were not extended also to tolerance as a regulating principle. Moreover, when moral and intellectual diff erences are not ultimately related to truth, there is nothing to tolerate. In fact, White’s argument connecting truth and eff ectiveness inevitably reminds us not of tolerance but of its opposite— Gentile’s evaluation of a truncheon as a moral force. In the same essay, as we have seen, White invites us to consider without “sentimentalism” the association between a conception of history which he has implicitly praised and the “ideologies of Fascist regimes.” He calls this association “conventional.” But the mention of Gentile’s name (along with Heidegger’s) in this context does not seem at all conventional.7. Since the late 1960s the skeptical attitudes of which we are speaking have become more and more infl uential in the humanities and social sciences. Th is broad diff usion is only partially related to their presumed novelty. Only an encomiastic impulse could have suggested to Pierre Vidal- Naquet that “[s]ince then [i.e., the publication of Michel de Certeau’s L’écriture de l’histoire"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"extermination of the jews and reality . 177in 1975] we have become aware that the historian writes; that he produces space and time, being himself intrinsically embedded in a specifi c space and time.” As Vidal- Naquet knows perfectly well, the same point (leading some-times to skeptical conclusions) was strongly emphasized, for instance, in a not particularly bold methodological essay of 1961 by E. H. Carr, What Is History?, as well as at a much earlier date by Benedetto Croce.By looking at these issues in historical perspective, we obtain a better grasp of their theoretical implications. As a starting point I would suggest a brief essay written by Renato Serra in 1912 but not published until 1927, after his untimely death in 1915. Its title, “Partenza di un gruppo di soldati per la Libia” (“Th e departure of a group of soldiers for Libya”), gives only a vague idea of its content. It begins with a description, written in a daringly experimental style reminiscent of Umberto Boccioni’s Futuristic paintings from the same era, of a railway station full of departing soldiers surrounded by a large crowd. At this point a series of anti- Socialist observations intrude, followed by a refl ection on history and historical writing, which abruptly leads to a passage couched in a metaphysical tone, full of Nietz schean echoes. Th is unfi nished essay, which certainly deserves a longer and deeper analysis, refl ects the complex personality of a man who, besides being the best Italian critic of his generation, was an erudite person with pronounced philosophical interests. In his correspondence with Croce (to whom he was personally very close, with-out being a follower) he explained the genesis of the pages we are discussing here. Th ey had been elicited by “Storia, cronaca e false storie” (1912), an essay by Croce which later was included, in revised form, in the latter’s Teoria e storia della storiografi a. Croce had mentioned the gap, emphasized by Tolstoy in Wa r and Peace, between an actual event, such as a battle, and the fragmentary and distorted recollections of it on which historical accounts are based. Tolstoy’s view is well known: the divide could be overcome only by collecting the memo-ries of every individual (even the humblest soldier) who had directly or indi-rectly participated in the battle. Croce dismissed this suggestion and the skepticism which it seemed to involve as absurd. “At every moment we know all the history that we need to know”; therefore, the history we do not know is identical to “the eternal ghost of the thing itself.”  Serra, ironically defi ning himself as “a slave of the thing itself,” wrote to Croce that he felt much closer to Tolstoy; however, he added, “my diffi culties are— or at least seem to be— much more complicated.”  It is impossible not to agree with him. “Th ere are"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"178 . extermination of the jews and realitypeople who imagine in good faith that a document can be an expression of reality. . . . As if a document could express something diff erent from itself. . . . A document is a fact. Th e battle is another fact (an infi nity of other facts). Th e two cannot become one. . . . Th e person who acts is a fact. Th e person who tells a story is another fact. . . . Every piece of testimony is only a testi-mony of itself; of its immediate moment, of its own origin, of its own pur-pose, and of nothing more.” Th ese were not the refl ections of a pure theoretician. Serra knew what eru-dition was. In his incisive critiques he did not artifi cially oppose historical narratives to the materials on which they are constructed. He was well aware that any document, regardless of how direct it is, always has a highly problem-atic relationship with reality. But reality (“the thing in itself ”) exists.Serra explicitly rejected simple, positivist attitudes. But his thoughts also help us to reject a point of view which brings together positivism (in other words, “positivist historical inquiry” based on a literal reading of documents) and relativism (namely, “historical narratives” based on fi gurative, incompara-ble, and irrefutable interpretations). In fact, the narratives based on one wit-ness discussed earlier in this chapter can be regarded as experimental cases which deny such a clear- cut distinction: a diff erent reading of the available evi-dence immediately aff ects the resulting narrative. A similar although usually less visible relationship can be assumed also on a general level. An unlimited skeptical attitude toward historical narratives is therefore groundless.8. On Auschwitz, Jean- François Lyotard wrote:Suppose that an earthquake destroys not only lives, buildings, and objects but also the instruments used to mea sure earthquakes, directly and indirectly. Th e impossibility of quantitatively mea sur ing it does not prohibit, but rather inspires in the minds of the survivors the idea of a great seismic force. . . . With Ausch-witz, something new has happened in history (which can only be a sign and not a fact), which is that the facts, the testimonies which bore the traces of here’s and now’s, the documents which indicated the sense or senses of the facts, and the names, fi nally the possibility of various kinds of phrases whose conjunction makes reality, all this has been destroyed as much as possible. Is it up to the his-torian to take into account not only the damages, but also the wrong? Not only the reality, but also the meta- reality, that is the destruction of reality? . . .

Memory and the destruction of memory are recurring elements in history. “Th e need to tell our story to ‘the rest,’ to make ‘the rest’ participate in it,” Primo Levi wrote, “had taken on for us, before our liberation and after, the character of an im-mediate and violent impulse, to the point of competing with our other ele-mentary needs.”  As Emile Benveniste has shown, one of the Latin words for “witness” is superstes— survivor."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"180History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last, the posthumous, unfi nished book by Siegfried Kracauer, appeared in paperback for the fi rst time in 1995. For the occasion, Paul Oskar Kristeller, who had presented the fi rst edition in 1969, wrote a new preface. In the twenty- six years that transpired between Kristel-ler’s two texts, an actual Kracauer re nais sance had occurred, with reprintings, translations, and essays of various types in several languages. But for Kristeller in 1995 this late recognition was debased by the attempt to eliminate from Kracauer’s work everything that could not be traced back to the Frankfurt School. As examples of this distorted interpretation, Kristeller cited essays by Gertrud Koch and Inka Mülder- Bach on History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last, appearing in the issue which the journal New German Critique had de-voted to Kracauer in 1991. Kristeller wrote that the “. . . two papers neither summarize the book nor indicate that its content fundamentally diff ers from his earlier writings.

Even a cursory inspection reveals that the notes to the essays by Koch and Mülder- Bach cite virtually exclusively writings by Kracauer or those known to him— with the exception of two or three obvious references to recent ar-ticles on his work. Moreover, contrary to what Kristeller says, the piece by Mülder- Bach emphasizes the elements of divergence between the posthumous book on history and some of Kracauer’s previous writings. To what should we attribute this uncharacteristic inaccuracy on Kristeller’s part? Perhaps to in-dignation. Th e allusion by Mülder- Bach to the “extreme cultural and schol-arly isolation” in which Kracauer allegedly wrote his book on history tacitly ignores Kristeller’s claim (which we have no reason to question) that the book had come into being thanks to intense discussions between the two friends over many years. But the point I should like to underline is yet another: the idea of a clear- cut break which, Kristeller argued, separated History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last from Kracauer’s earlier writings is totally indefensible.Kracauer’s posthumous book opens with an autobiographical statement: “. . . recently I suddenly discovered that my interest in history— which began to assert itself about a year ago and which I had hitherto believed to be kin-dled by the impact of our contemporary situation on my mind— actually grew out of the ideas I tried to implement in my Th eory of Film. In turning to history, I just continued to think along the lines manifest in that book.” Kra-cauer then continued, “. . . I realized in a fl ash the many existing parallels be-tween history and the photographic media, historical reality and camera- reality. Lately I came across my piece on photography and was completely amazed at noticing that I had compared historism with photography already in this article of the ’twenties.”Th e identifi cation of the parallelism between history (in the twofold sense of pro cess and narration, of res gestae and of historia rerum gestarum) and the photograph (in a broad sense, including the cinema) as an element of conti-nuity between the earlier and later Kracauer, the caesura marked by the exile experience notwithstanding, comes from Kracauer himself. We should not ignore such an assertion, as Kristeller implicitly seems to do when he con-trasts the posthumous book to the earlier writings.

Th e continuity as well as the contiguity concentrated in the adverb already are thus debatable. Is this a minute discrepancy perhaps caused by the unfi nished state of the manuscript? Or is it a clue suggesting the presence of an unresolved problem in Kracauer’s thought?2. To settle this our search must begin with some texts, cited by Kracauer himself, around which discussions have shed a little light but also produced many doubts in the last few years. We can begin with the article on photog-raphy appearing in 1927 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which Kracauer later included in his collection Die Ornament der Masse (1963). Here Kra-cauer observes that “historicist thinking . . . emerged at about the same time as modern photographic technology,” insinuating that both were the products of a capitalist society. But this coincidence, according to the author, concealed an even more profound parallelism. Representatives of historicism such as Wilhelm Dilthey (a reference which Kracauer omitted when he reprinted the essay in a volume) believe “they can explain any phenomenon purely in terms of its genesis. Th ey believe that they can grasp historical reality by reconstructing the course of events in their temporal succession without leaving anything out. Photography, instead, off ers a spatial continuum; historicism seeks to provide the temporal continuum.” To historicism and to photography Kracauer con-trasted memory and its images. Th e latter, by defi nition, are fragmentary: “Memory encompasses neither the entire spatial appearance of a state of aff airs nor its entire temporal course.” And here is where the profound signifi cance of the juxtaposition between historicism and photography on the one hand, and memory and its images on the other, made its appearance: “Th at the world devours them is a sign of the fear of death. What the photographs by their sheer accumulation attempt to banish is the recollection of death, which is part and parcel of every memory image.” Admittedly, in the conclusion of his essay, with a sudden dialectical rever-sal, Kracauer projected an emancipation of the photograph from the one- dimensional recording of events, from the accumulation of the detritus of nature: a possibility attributed to fi lm, which (alongside the dream and Kaf ka’s work) would be in a position to re unite in an unforeseeable manner the fragments of reality, bringing to light a superior order. But basically the Kracauer of 1927 condemned photography and historicism equally. He op-"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauer . 183posed them to “history” in quotation marks: a history to be written, a history that in fact did not yet exist.3. Is it correct to see these refl ections, as Kracauer retrospectively suggested, as the seed of his posthumous book on history? Yes and no: in between there is a discontinuity, which can be summed up, as has been noted, in reference to Proust— or, better yet, to a specifi c passage in his work. Th e 1927 photogra-phy article does not mention Proust at all, although it discusses memory and the images of memory. Instead, in Th eory of Film (1960) a nd i n History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last, Kracauer analyzed, respectively, the characteristics of fi lm and of historiography, recalling again and again that page in Th e Guer-mantes Way (Le côté de Guermantes) in which the narrator, returning home from a trip unexpectedly, sees his grandmother without being seen himself and for an instant does not recognize her. Here is a passage from that unfor-gettable page:Of myself— thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one’s own absence,— there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and traveling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photogra-pher who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. Th e pro cess that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. . . . For the fi rst time and for a mo-ment only, since she vanished at once, I saw sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red- faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know.Th rough the estranged, mechanical gaze which Proust compares to the impassive lens of the camera, the narrator grasps instantly, in spite of him-self, what love had hitherto prevented him from seeing: his grandmother was dying. Th e photograph which for Kracauer in 1927 was the token of the fear of death became, through Proust, the instrument which permitted the over-coming of that fear, of looking death in the face. Furthermore, the premonition of death was already at the heart of that passage of Saint- Simon’s Mémoires which, if I am not mistaken, had inspired Proust. Th e Duke of Saint- Simon enters to visit the dauphin and fi nds him “seated on a chair among his gentlemen- in- waiting and two or three of his high offi cials. I was horrifi ed. I saw a man with a lowered head, his face of a purple, reddish complexion, with an inane air, who did not even notice my approach.” Apart from the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"184 . thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauerperception of physical de cadence attributed to skin coloring by both writers (rouge pourpre, rouge) the pro cess used in the two passages to convey the lack of recognition is similar: “Je vis un homme” (Saint- Simon), “ j’aperçus . . . une vieille femme” (Proust). Behind the altered physiognomy of the individual stands the anonymous destiny of the species, its moral condition.“Th e face in the fi lm has no value if it does not bring out the skull beneath it. ‘Danse macabre.’ To what end? Th is remains to be seen.” In these enig-matic words attempts have been made to see an early reaction on Kracauer’s part to the Proustian text. Th ey are taken from a notebook containing a pre-liminary version of an introduction to a book on the cinema. It was the proj-ect on which Kracauer had begun to work in Marseilles in November 1940 during the agonizing wait for the permit that would allow him to emigrate with his wife to the United States. A new version of the project begun at Marseilles, which Kracauer wrote in En glish in 1949, opens with a direct reference, later developed in the fi nal version of the book, to Proust’s text. In the French city Kracauer had met Walter Benjamin, who a few months later fl ed to Spain and ultimately suicide. We know that during their stay in Marseilles the two friends spoke of Kracauer’s fi lm project. Th ere is no risk in supposing that in the course of these conversations Benjamin mentioned the passage in Proust, which some years before he had translated, in collabo-ration with Franz Hessel. Th e comparison between the look with which the narrator mechanically registers the physical decay of the grandmother without recognizing her, and the indiff erence of the camera, clarifi es the implications of the notion of optical unconsciousness which Benjamin had proposed in his historical essay on photography (1931).4. Th rough Proust, perhaps mediated by Benjamin, Kracauer substituted for the analogy which he had proposed in 1927 between photography and historicism one that was completely diff erent and in some ways the opposite, between photography and history (in the sense of historia rerum gestarum, or historiography), which he fully discussed in History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last. But to understand the full signifi cance of the juxtaposition, Kracauer was suggesting, we need to recall that in the page from Proust, the photogra-pher is the fi nal element in a series composed of more or less similar fi gures: “the witness, the observer, with a hat and traveling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a pho-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauer . 185tograph of places which one will never see again.” For Kracauer the exile, it was natural to identify with the stranger, or actually even with the wander-ing Jew Ahasuerus, who appears in the title of one of the chapters in his post-humous book on history. But the identifi cation, at least on the surface, was not intended to convey pathos. Kracauer emphasized that the stranger, he who is marginalized, he who “does not belong to the house,” is in a position to understand more, and more deeply. Th e instant in which recognition fails opens to the estranged gaze of the spectator the way to cognitive awareness. It is not pure coincidence, Kracauer remarks, that great historians, from Th ucydides to Napier, were exiles: “It is only in this state of self- eff acement, or homelessness, that the historian can commune with the material of his concern. . . . A stranger to the world evoked by the sources, he is faced with the task— the exile’s task— of penetrating its outward appearances, so that he may learn to comprehend that world from within.”All this helps us to understand why Kracauer presented his unfi nished book on history as a development of the theses he had formulated in Th eory of Film. Th e identifi cation of the historian with the exile is the destination of his extended refl ections on photography. Th e attitude of active passivity which Kracauer recommends to historians builds on (as Volker Breidecker has pointed out) a page from Th eory of Film on the desolate urban photographs of Charles Marville or of Eugène Atget. Th e “melancholy” which has been rec-ognized in those Pa ri sian scenes, Kracauer notes, “favors self- estrangement, which, on its part entails identifi cation with all kinds of objects. Th e dejected individual is likely to lose himself in the incidental confi gurations of his envi-ronment, absorbing them with a disinterested intensity no longer determined by his previous preferences. His is a kind of receptivity which resembles that of Proust’s photographer cast in the role of a stranger.” But this is a receptivity which is interwoven with the choice, the construction: the photograph is not a simple mirror image of reality. Th e photographer could be compared, Kra-cauer observes, to “the imaginative reader intent on studying and deciphering an elusive text.” Th ese words, contained in the fi rst part (by far the most im-portant) of Th eory of Film, explain why Kracauer would write to Adorno that the cinema, in that book, was only a pretext. Kracauer, who for years had read, along with the young Adorno, Th e Critique of Pure Reason, wanted to explore a cognitive model using the cinema. Th is research continued in the posthumous book on history— the fi nal phase, destined to remain unfi nished,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"186 . thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauerof an intellectual journey that was remarkably single- minded, in spite of the many diff erent research areas it touched.5. Th e infl uence of Kant is identifi able even in Panofsky’s famous essay on fi lm, especially where he mentions “. . . the fascinating spectacle of a new ar-tistic medium gradually becoming conscious of its legitimate, that is, exclu-sive possibilities and limitations. . . .” And yet, as has been convincingly demonstrated by Tom Levin, that essay promptly took a diff erent and less ambitious turn. Much more fruitful, according to Levin, are the refl ections on the cinema in Panofsky’s essay on perspective as symbolic form published in 1927 in the Warburg Vorträge. An oblique allusion to this essay can be found, as noted above, in a 1928 letter from Walter Benjamin to Kracauer. But even if Kracauer did not read the essay on perspective, he could have grasped its gist from Panofsky’s other writings. Th e preparatory material for Kracauer’s History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last includes a page of notes to which Volker Breidecker has justly called attention. It is entitled “Emphasis on minutiae—Close- up—micro- analysis.” As an example of “close- up” Kra-cauer mentioned the “principle of disjunction” illustrated by Panofsky— in other words, the divarication, typical of medieval art, between classical themes represented anachronistically and ancient images Christianized. In his History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last, Kracauer off ers a twofold clarifi ca-tion. Panofsky’s “principle of disjunction” is off ered fi rst as an example of a per-fect equilibrium between “realistic tendency” and “formative tendency,” to-gether with a photo by Alfred Stieglitz; and second as a paradigmatic example of “microhistory,” or “small- scale histories,” compared to a close- up. In both cases the photograph (or the photographic frame) emerges as the object on which to base comparisons; but here it is the latter model that is of interest.Without the cinema, without the “close- up,” could Kracauer have spoken about microhistory? Obviously, this is a rhetorical question. It is no accident that Kracauer, to underline the connection between macrohistoric investiga-tion and close- ups based on microresearch, should quote a passage from Vsevolod Pudovkin on the plurality of points of view imposed by fi lm narra-tion. Th e photograph and its extensions (the cinema, tele vi sion) have opened up, just as linear perspective did in the past, a series of cognitive possibilities: a new way to see, to narrate, to think. Kracauer’s refl ections collected in his posthumous book on history spring from an awareness of the emergence of a world which, more than ever, is still ours today."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauer . 187A new world to behold: but to what degree is it really new? As T. S. Eliot wrote, every innovation in expression constructs its own genealogy back-wards. Th e cinema is no exception to this rule. Sergei Eisenstein argued that the early inventions of the fi lm pioneer D. W. Griffi th had literary anteced-ents: the isolated repre sen ta tion of details in the novels of Dickens. In an-other essay Eisenstein used the encounter between Emma and Rodolphe in Madame Bovary as an exceptional example of the alternating editing of dia-logues. I had failed to notice this when, some years ago, I analyzed a series of devices used by Flaubert in L’éducation sentimentale, especially the famous blanc so admired by Proust, inserting it in a context molded by the photo-graph, by the panorama, by the train. I had also forgotten an early reaction to L’éducation sentimentale, which I should like to address now— a digression which may better help us to understand Kracauer’s way of thinking.6. In December 1869 a long essay entitled “Le roman mysanthropique” ap-peared in the Revue des Deux Mondes. It dealt with L’éducation sentimentale, which had just appeared. In his youth, the author of the piece, Saint- René Taillandier, had written a monograph, Scot Erigène et la philosophie scholas-tique (1843), with an eye to Hegel and Schilling; later he taught literature at the Universities of Strasbourg and Montpellier, closing out his career in the Académie Française. In 1863 he had published, always in the Revue des Deux Mondes, a paper on Salammbô entitled “Le réalisme épique dans le roman.” From an academic critic of Catholic background and conservative tastes such as Taillandier one might expect a condemnation of Flaubert’s “immorality” and stylistic audacity. And the expected condemnation did come, but at the center of a critical discussion that holds some surprises, especially for those of us accustomed to reading L’ é d u c a t i o n s e n t i m e n t a l e as a classic. Taillandier, who read it as a freshly minted novel by an established and scandalous author, conveys to us, unexpectedly, astonishment over what is new: “Imagine an artist who pretends to reproduce reality most faithfully, and who begins by casting over this reality the bizarre veil of his system. Uselessly he proposes to show everything, similar to the ray of sun which traverses the darkroom of the photographer. . . .” (p. 988).Th e comparison between Flaubert and a photographer, which may seem banal, actually is not, as we see from what follows immediately:In vain he tries to be pointed, biting, like a blade that slices through rock, like nitric acid which cuts into copper: wholly concerned with the eff ect he thinks"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"188 . thoughts on a book by siegfried kracaueronly of the pro cess, of the equipment, of the instruments, of the acids. Nature’s rich variety is forgotten: here he is secluded in an unsanitary laboratory. Th e unrefi ned artisan of realism will rapidly lose the sense of the real world. He has a small number of examples before his eyes, and these examples, fatigued, disfi g-ured, bored and boring, will become for him an image of human destiny. (p. 988)Taillandier recognizes that Flaubert “certainly is not a mediocre writer . . . he produces little, but each one of his works testifi es to intense thought and demanding execution.” But a book such as Madame Bovary “is a knowledgeable dissection executed with glacial aplomb” which has scandalized not because of its subject matter but for “the indiff erence of the thought” which inspired it (pp. 988– 989). “Th e epic realism of Salammbô had the same characteristic of inhuman fantasy” (in the previous article Taillandier had spoken without mincing his words of “a sadistic element of the imagination”). Th is raised the question: “What was this writer then, who, while devoting such care to his work, nevertheless remained so totally estranged from it? What was the sig-nifi cance of this impassible portrait?” (p. 989).Impassibilité, impassible: these recurring terms in the article emanate from the initial juxtaposition between writer and photographer. Taillandier sees this impassibility as “the result of a system, the expression of a concealed phi-losophy,” misanthropy in the broadest sense of the term. “To infl ict on man outrages of this sort means off ending the world and him who created it, if we admit that the world is someone’s work. . . . A sort of atheism: that is the book ’s philosophy” (p. 990). But this philosophical intention is joined by “the desire to write a page of history.” Flaubert seems to have wanted to suggest “the idea of a work in which the public events [of the last twenty- fi ve years] are explained by individual behavior. Th e education of the protagonist would thus correspond to the education of Pa ri sian society during a period of our history.”It is diffi cult not to accept this hypothesis, extravagant as it may be, the moment we realize unquestionably that the author is imitating the style of Michelet in the fi nal volumes of his History of France. We fi nd the same broken, convulsed way of splitting the narration, of passing brusquely from one scene to another accumu-lating details and suppressing the transitions. A novel has never spoken a similar language; one has the impression of confronting a chronicle, a dry and hurried diary, a collection of notes, of signs, of words. But the diff erence is this: that in the case of the historian the signs are incisive, the words express, the notes sum-marize sometimes well, sometimes badly, relevant events, while in the case of the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauer . 189novelist these forms, wisely, laboriously expressed, are applied to totally tasteless adventures. (pp. 993– 994)I shall return presently to the pairing of Michelet and Flaubert. But Tail-landier realizes that the antithesis which came to him spontaneously be-tween the “relevant events” described by the former and the “totally tasteless adventures” recounted by the latter is inexact. Th e reader of L’ é d u c a t i o n s e n -timentale is struck by something quite diff erent from the mingling of private lives and public events: Taillandier perceives in this “the intention of confus-ing great things with the small, the serious with the ridiculous, so as to estab-lish on this promiscuity the doctrine of universal scorn” (p. 999). Everything is placed on the same plane: “It is no longer the case of a banal indiff erence, but of a deliberate will to disenchant the world and degrade human nature” (p. 1002). Th e term désenchanter recurs toward the conclusion: with the book completed, “we tell ourselves that all this is false, that the author has not rep-resented either love or action, that he has slandered humanity, that life is something of value, and that art betrays itself when it persists in disenchant-ing God’s work ” (p. 1003).7. Dissociation of the author from his work; narrative pro cesses which are their own end; impassibility; indiff erence; history in which public events and private happenings lacking in importance are interwoven; general irrele-vance; disillusionment with the world. It would not be diffi cult to fi nd in Kracauer’s History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last themes similar to those Taillandier identifi ed in L’éducation sentimentale: estrangement, detachment, the interweaving of micro- and macrohistory, a rejection of the philosophy of history— in other words, of the search for a comprehensive sense in human history. Kracauer may not have read Taillandier’s article; however, he had read Flaubert and, during the Weimar period, regarded Flaubert’s impassi-bility as an ideal. Toward the end of World War II he contemplated an essay (which he never wrote) on the pessimism of Flaubert and the intellectuals of the Th ird Republic. But these similarities suggest something more com-plex than the reading of an author by two very diff erent persons, a century apart. Here we are dealing not simply with reception, but with reception and production together. In an extraordinary book which has not received the attention it deserves, Michael Baxandall has shown that Italian Quattrocento"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"190 . thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauerpaint ers applied themselves to a public which knew how to understand their work thanks to a series of shared social experiences: the abacus, sermons, the dance. Th e experiment could be repeated with photography, choosing a specifi c sector: France toward the mid– nineteenth century, Germany in the fi rst de cades of the twentieth, Eu rope in the early years of the twenty- fi rst. Let there be no doubt, however: this research perspective has nothing to do with determinism. If man is (among the many possible defi nitions) a meta-phorical animal, then we could say that the abacus, photography, and such suggest to the artist and to his public experiences that can be treated as meta-phors, as worlds als ob (as if ), with respect to the fi ctional world of which the work is composed. In the present case, the photograph off ered Flaubert the possibility of developing a series of cognitive and narrative experiments, and to his readers the possibility of deciphering them. When Taillandier hypoth-esizes, without providing concrete citations, that Flaubert tried to emulate Michelet’s later style—“. . . it is the same broken, convulsed way of splitting the narration, of passing brusquely from one scene to another accumulating details and suppressing the transitions . . .”— it is impossible not to think of photography and (anachronistically) of cinematic cutting and splicing.Let us try to test Taillandier’s hypothesis on a passage taken, almost hap-hazardly, from the fi nal volume of Michelet’s Histoire de France. It is the de-scription of an episode from the revolt of the nobles which preceded the great revolution itself: the so- called journée des tuiles, an uprising at Grenoble on 7 June 1788. Michelet had direct access to numerous accounts of that event: “Th e best, provided by a monk, is of an enchanting simplicity.” It would be worthwhile to see how he reor ga nized this material (beginning with the punctuation). But let us listen to Michelet:It was noon. At that sinister rumble, which resounded throughout every nook and cranny of that high valley, the rough peasants of Tronche and surrounding villages, with a terrible surge, grabbed their fi rearms and began to run. But the gates were nailed shut. Th ey search for ladders. Unfortunately, they were too short. Th ey end up opening a breach in a wall which blocked a fake door. It took a long while: but their presence suffi ced to convey the idea that the countryside was as one with the city.To this succession of visual and auditory sensations, articulated with brief phrases, interrupted by photographic frames, which go on page after page, we could compare the splendid scene of the killing of Dussardier in L’éducation sentimentale. Instead, I shall quote a passage written in the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"thoughts on a book by siegfried kracauer . 191plain prose of a manual for fi lm directors: “In order to receive a clear and defi nite impression of a demonstration, the observer must perform certain actions. First he must climb upon the roof of a house to get a view from above of the pro cession as a whole and mea sure its dimensions; next he must come down and look out through the fi rst- fl oor window at the inscriptions carried by the demonstrators; fi nally, he must mingle with the crowd to gain an idea of the outward appearance of the participants.”Th is is the passage in Pudovkin quoted by Kracauer to support his thesis about the reciprocal implication between macro- and microhistory, between long shots and close- ups. I, in turn, would quote certain pages in Kracauer in support of the thesis of the cognitive implications (and not just rhetorical or ornamental) in any narrative. On this point Kracauer stands out, more than ever, as an essential protagonist in the discussion.8. “Th ere is no cosmos on the screen” wrote Roger Caillois. Kracauer, who quoted these words with emphatic approval, went so far as to say that “art in fi lm is reactionary because it symbolizes wholeness.”  Th is obstinate refusal of totality, which fed Kracauer’s diffi dence toward the philosophy of history, sheds an ironic light to words which he penned in Marseilles in November 1940: “Th e face in fi lm has no value if it does not allow the skull beneath it to surface. ‘Danse macabre.’ To what end? Th is remains to be seen.” “Zu welchem Ende?” Th e question mark leaves open the possibility that, along with the end, which is a given, there also exists a telos, a purpose. But the title— it, too, ironical— of the unfi nished book, History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last, evokes the world of contingency, the disenchanted world for which Flaubert (as Taillandier wrote) and Max Weber had contended. All this, it seems to me, counsels against enrolling Kracauer, as has been done on occasion, among the devotees of messianicism, even in a paler version. Th e emphatic “NO” which Kracauer applied to his copy of Benjamin’s writings published in 1955, next to the last sentence of the seventh thesis on the philosophy of history, attests to a dissent which his friend’s tragic death had not extinguished. It may be worthwhile to reread what Benjamin had written:Addressing himself to the historian who wishes to relive an era, Fustel de Cou-langes recommends that he blot out everything he knows about the later course of history.

Among medieval theologians, acedia was regarded as the root cause of melancholy. Flaubert, who was familiar with it, wrote: “Few will guess how much sadness it took to resuscitate Carthage” (Peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu être triste pour resusciter Carthage). Th e nature of this melancholy becomes clearer if we ask: With whom does historicism actually sympathize? Th e answer is inevitable: with the victor.Kracauer, who thought of himself as a champion of lost causes and associ-ated the theme of David and Goliath with the close- up—namely, the convic-tion that the most signifi cant forces reveal themselves in what is small and insignifi cant— could not accept Benjamin’s conclusion. Nor could he ac-cept what preceded it: the condemnation of melancholy, of empathy, of Flau-bert assimilated into historicism. As for historicism, Kracauer was of two minds. But faith in the notion of progress, as expressed by Dilthey with reser-vations, seemed unacceptable. Flaubert’s pessimism was much more conge-nial to him. And yet in the antimessianical idea of the redemption of physical reality one discerns, in spite of everything, a subdued utopian accent."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"1931. It must have been 1977 or 1978 when I heard of “microhistory” for the fi rst time from Giovanni Levi, and I adopted this previously unheard- of word with-out asking what it meant literally; I suppose I contented myself with the refer-ence to a reduced scale suggested by the prefi x micro-. I well remember, too, that in those early conversations we spoke of “microhistory” as if it were a label attached to an empty vessel waiting to be fi lled.Sometime later Levi, Simona Cerutti, and I began working on a series entitled precisely Microstorie for the Einaudi publishing house in Turin. Twenty- odd volumes by both Italian and foreign authors have appeared; a few of the Italian works have been translated into other languages. In some quarters there has been talk of an Italian school of microhistory. Recently, thanks to a small retrospective investigation into terminology, I discovered that this word, which we thought was free of connotation, had already been used by others.2. To the best of my knowledge, the fi rst person to dredge up the word micro-history as a self- defi ned term was an American scholar, George R. Stewart, in 1959. Stewart, who lived from 1895 to 1980, and who for many years was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, must have been an excep-tional person. Th e vast bibliography of this liberal polymath includes, in addi-tion to various novels (which I have not read), a precocious ecological mani-festo (Not So Rich as You Th ink, 1968); a recapitulation of universal history in the form of an autobiography of the human species (Man, an Autobiography, CHAPTER 14MicrohistoryTwo or Th ree Th ings Th at I Know about It"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"194 . microhistory1946); a chronicle, written in collaboration with others, of the re sis tance by Stewart and colleagues, including Ernst Kantorowicz, to the loyalty oath imposed by the University of California during the McCarthy era (Th e Year of the Oath, 1950). Stewart’s best- known books (Names on the Land, 1945, 1967; American Place- Names, 1970) are dedicated to the toponymy of the United States. In a lecture, taking as his point of departure the place- names mentioned in a Horatian ode, he asserted that to interpret a literary text it is necessary fi rst of all to decipher the background references— places, vegetation, meteorological conditions— that it contains. Stewart’s passion for microscopic detail also inspired the book that interests me here: Pickett’s Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Charge at Gettysburg, July 3, 1863 (1959). In it Stewart analyzed mi-nutely for over three hundred pages the decisive battle of the American Civil Wa r. Th e title refers to an event lasting only about twenty minutes: the des-perate, unsuccessful assault led by a Confederate battalion under Major Gen-eral Edward Pickett. Th e account unfolds within a narrow time frame, a pe-riod of fi fteen hours. Th e maps and diagrams that accompany the text have captions such as “Th e Cannonade (1:10– 2:55 p.m.).” Th e outcome of the battle of Gettysburg is played out in a matter of seconds, between a clump of trees and a stone wall. Within this compressed compass in time and space, Stew-art analyzes in almost obsessive detail what he defi nes as “the climax of the climax, the central moment of our history”— and, as such, part of universal history. If George Edward Pickett’s failed charge had instead succeeded, Stewart suggests, the battle of Gettysburg might have ended diff erently, and “the existence of two rival republics would probably have prevented the United States from turning the balance of two World Wars and becoming a global power.” Stewart’s dogged kind of microhistory might induce a con-templation of Cleopatra’s nose.3. A few years later, wholly in de pen dently of Stewart, a Mexican scholar, Luis González y González, inserted the word microhistory into the subtitle of a monograph published in Mexico City in 1968 (Pueblo en vilo: Microhistoria de San José de Gracia [A village in tumult]). Th e book investigates, within the span of four centuries, the transformation experienced by a tiny “forgotten” village. But the minute dimensions are redeemed by its representative charac-teristics. Besides the fact that González y González was born and lived there, this is the element that justifi es the choice of San José de Gracia over a thou-sand other villages just like it. Here microhistory is synonymous with local"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"microhistory . 195history, written, as González y González stressed, citing Paul Leuilliot, from a qualitative rather than a quantitative perspective. Th e success enjoyed by Pueblo en vilo (reprinted and translated into En glish and French) persuaded its author to theorize about its methodology in two essays, “El arte de la micro-historia” and “Teoria de la microhistoria,” which were included in two collec-tions entitled, respectively, Invitación a la microhistoria (1973) a nd Nueva invi-tación a la microhistoria (1982). In these pages, echoes of which are discernible in other Mexican publications from these years, González y González distin-guished microhistory from the anecdotal and discredited petite histoire; and he reiterated its identity with what in En gland, France, and the United States was called “local history,” and which Nietz sche had defi ned as “antiquarian or ar-cheological history.” Finally, to counteract the objections provoked by the word microhistory, González y González suggested two alternatives: matria history, suitable for evoking that “small, weak, feminine, sentimental world of the mother” which revolves around the family and the village; and yin history, the Taoist term that recalls all that is “feminine, conservative, terrestrial, sweet, obscure and painful.”4. Even while claiming for himself the basic paternity of the word microhis-tory, González y González recalled that it had already appeared in Fernand Braudel’s introduction to the Tr a i t é d e s o c i o l o g i e edited by Georges Gurvitch (1958), but “sin signifi cación concreta reconocida.” Actually, for Braudel mi-crohistoire had a precise but negative connotation. It was synonymous with that “history of events” [histoire événementielle], with that “traditional history,” that saw the “so- called history of the world” dominated by protagonists who re-sembled orchestra directors. Braudel held that, within the limits of brief and convulsive time, this traditional history was less interesting than microsociol-ogy on the one hand, and econometrics on the other.As we know, Braudel had declared his hostility with regard to histoire événementielle, identifi ed with po liti cal history, even from the time of his Médi-terranée (1949). Ten years later he once again demonstrated his dis plea sure. But he was too intelligent, too impatient to content himself with repeating what had now become for many, because of his own authority, an accepted truth. Suddenly putting aside what at this point seemed to him “old misunderstand-ings,” Braudel wrote: “Th e incident (if not the event, the sociodrama) exists in repetition, regularity, multitude, and there is no way of saying absolutely whether its level is quite without value or scholarly promise. It must be given"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"196 . microhistorycloser examination.” Tw e n t y - fi ve years had to pass before this suggestion would be acted upon. Braudel excluded the possibility of scholarly recogni-tion of singularity: the incident, the fait divers, could, perhaps, fi nd ac cep tance simply because it was considered repetitive— an adjective that in González y González became “typical.” But microhistory remained condemned. Th e word, obviously modeled on microeconomics and microsociology, remained clothed in a technicist aura, as emerges from this passage of Les fl eurs bleues, arguably Raymond Queneau’s fi nest novel. Th e two speakers are the duke of Auge and his chaplain:“What is it exactly that you want to know?”“What you think about universal history in general and of general history in par-tic u lar. I’m listening.”“I’m really tired,” said the chaplain.“You can rest later. Tell me, for example, is this Council of Basel universal history?”“But of course: it is universal history in general.”“And what about my small cannon?”“General history in par tic u lar.”“And the marriage of my daughters?”“Scarcely ‘the history of events.’ At the most, microhistory.”“What kind of history?” the duke of Auge stormed. “What the dev il kind of lan-guage is this? What is today anyway? Pentecost?”“Please excuse me, sire. Th e eff ects of exhaustion, as you can see.”Th e duke of Auge, probably just like many readers of Queneau in 1965, had never heard of microhistory. For this reason, perhaps, ignoring the chap-lain’s precise classifi cation, the publisher of the 1977 French translation of González y González’s Pueblo en vilo did not hesitate to substitute in the subtitle and in the text the words histoire universelle for microhistoire, with unintended comic eff ects.5. Microhistory, microhistoria, microhistoire: from which of these in de pen dent traditions did the Italian microstoria derive? On the level of strict terminol-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"microhistory . 197ogy that has occupied us thus far, the answer would seem to be clear: from the French microhistoire. I am thinking fi rst of all of the splendid translation by Italo Calvino published by Einaudi in 1967 of Les fl eurs bleues (I fi ori blu); second, of a passage in Primo Levi in which, to the best of my knowledge, the word microstoria appears in Italian for the fi rst time in an autonomous man-ner. It occurs at the beginning of the chapter titled “Carbon,” with which Th e Periodic Table concludes:Th e reader, at this point, will have realized for some time now that this is not a chemical treatise: my presumption does not reach so far—“ma voix est faible, et même un peu profane.” Nor is it an autobiography, save in the partial and sym-bolic limits in which every piece of writing is autobiographical, indeed every hu-man work; but it is in some fashion a history. It is— or would have liked to be— a micro- history, the history of a trade and its defeats, victories, and miseries, such as everyone wants to tell when he feels close to concluding the arc of his career, and art ceases to be long.Th ere is nothing in these calm and melancholy words to suggest that twelve years later their author would take his life. Th e reduction of scale sug-gested by the word microhistory fi ts in with the acknowledgment of the limits of existence, with the sense of one’s own capacities that dominates this pas-sage. Primo Levi probably encountered it in Calvino’s Italian translation, which he may have checked against Queneau’s original text. Th at Levi knew of Calvino’s version of Les fl eurs bleues seems certain given the closeness between the two men; moreover, the last page of “Carbon” in Th e Periodic Table echoes closely the last page of Calvino’s Il barone rampante. A fresh encounter be-tween Calvino and Primo Levi, by way of Queneau, occurred a few years later due to the Italian translation of the latter’s Petite cosmogonie portative.Shortly after its appearance in Th e Periodic Table, the word microhistory entered Italian historical usage, losing, as often happens, its original negative connotation. Giovanni Levi (a distant cousin of Primo Levi) was undoubt-edly behind this transposition. Microhistory rapidly replaced microanalysis, which had been used in these years by Edoardo Grendi, more or less with the same meaning.6. Th ere is a point that still needs defi ning: the history of a word, obviously, determines its possible application only in part. Th is is proved indirectly by the “Zaharoff lecture” that Richard Cobb dedicated to Raymond Queneau in 1976— a species of historiographical manifesto that fi ts none of the usages"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"198 . microhistorydiscussed thus far. Cobb began with the ironic sympathy felt by Queneau for the timid, modest, provincial personages in his novels. He appropriated their words in order to counterbalance news of local happenings— the only ones that were of interest— with po liti cal events; and he concluded by assuming as his own slogan the colorful curse hurled by Zasie at Napoleon. Basically, this is an exaltation of minor historiography (Cobb does not use the term mi-crohistory) against that of the great and the powerful. Th e naïveté of this inter-pretation is obvious. Queneau does not identify in any way with his characters. Th e fondness he felt for the provincial life of Le Havre coexisted in him with an omnivorous, encyclopedic passion for the most random knowledge. His mocking curiosity for the faits divers did not stop him from proposing a drastic remedy for the prescientifi c nature of historiography, and he elaborated a rigor-ous mathematical model in which to trap the disordered course of human acts. But neither the author of Une histoire modèle nor the auditor and later editor of Alexandre Kojève’s courses on Hegel’s Phenomenology appears in the portrait simplifi ed by Cobb to the point of distortion. Totally missing is the ten-sion that runs through all of Queneau’s work between the warmth of the narra-tor’s intimate glance and the coldness of the scientist’s detached observation.Th ere is nothing strange about this. Cobb is an empiricist who claims to be superior to theoretical questions; and, after all, for him the use of Que-neau is a mere pretext. But the proposal of a minor historiography made in the name of Queneau has a symptomatic importance that Cobb, confi rmed cultivator of his own eccentricity, would be the fi rst to reject. Th e contrast between Historiography with a capital H and Zasie’s “Napoléon mon cul” might suggest, apart from the obvious diff erence in tone, the contrast between storia patria and storia matria as outlined by Luis González y González. To be sure, the latter’s microhistoria focuses on typical phenomena, whereas Cobb’s petite histoire focuses on the unpredictable and the unrepeatable fait divers. But in both cases the choice of a circumscribed and close- up perspective reveals a dissatisfaction (explicit and aggressive in Cobb’s case, tactful and almost im-perceptible in the case of González y González) with the macroscopic and quantitative model that dominated the international historiographical scene between the mid- 1950s and mid- 1970s, primarily through the activities of Braudel and the historians of the Annales school.7. None among that relatively heterogeneous group of Italian scholars of microhistory would recognize himself in George Stewart’s close- up “history"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"microhistory . 199of events,” in the local history of González y González, or in the petite histoire of Richard Cobb. However, it cannot be denied that even Italian microhis-tory, though very diff erent (beginning with its theoretical goals), originated in opposition to the historiographical model just mentioned. Th e latter was presented in the mid- 1970s, with Braudel’s backing, as the culmination of the functional- structural approach, the supreme historiographical paradigm, the third to have occurred in the course of the more than two millennia that began with Herodotus. But a few years earlier, the ceremony marking the publication of the Mélanges honoring Braudel (1973) revealed the existence of hidden tensions and anxieties at the very moment of the celebration. A paral-lel reading of two essays published on that occasion—“Un nouveau champ pour l ’histoire sérielle: Le quantitatif au troisième niveau,” by Pierre Chaunu; and “Histoire et ethnologie,” by François Furet and Jacques Le Goff — seems instructive twenty years later. In both cases a historiographical program was being introduced and justifi ed by some general historical refl ection. Chaunu spoke of the end of the anticolonial wars (referring only to France) and to stu-dent revolts (in America and in Eu rope); of a disoriented Roman Church fol-lowing Vatican II; of an economic crisis in the most advanced countries that brought into question the very idea of progress; of a challenge to the ideals of the Enlightenment that he interpreted consistently as a secularized transpo-sition of an eschatological ideal. Furet, with words that we can suppose were shared by Le Goff , observed that the worldwide phenomenon of decoloniza-tion had placed the great nineteenth- century historiography, in its Manches-terian and Marxist versions, face- to- face with nonhistory: progress and change had run into inertia, stagnation. Common to both essays was a clear- cut re-jection of theories of modernization (such as W. W. Rostow’s, then in vogue, mentioned by Furet and Le Goff ) that in Chaunu was coupled with a repu-diation of modernity tout court. Th e research projects resulting from these essays varied greatly. Chaunu proposed analyzing the traditional societies of the Ancien Régime, observing that the “great continuity of Latin Christen-dom which has unconsciously . . . been transformed into a Eu rope of the West” was “infi nitely more attractive than the Nambikwaras or the Dogons”— a statement that lumped together disdainfully peoples from various conti-nents being studied by ethnologists (Claude Lévi- Strauss and Marcel Gri-aule, respectively) from very diff erent intellectual worlds. Instead, Furet and Le Goff suggested reconnecting the long- sundered bonds between his-tory and ethnology by adopting a generally comparative perspective based on"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"200 . microhistorythe explicit rejection, especially by Le Goff , of a Eurocentric approach. But at this point the two positions began to converge: both Chaunu and Furet were aiming at a “serial history” based on the analysis of phenomena, according to Furet, “selected and constructed as a function of their repetitive character.” Le Goff subscribed to the rejection of the single event on the part of the eth-nologists and their concentration on “events repeated or awaited”: Le Roy Ladu-rie’s analysis of the carnival in Romans, though praised, was evidently consid-ered an exception. Chaunu insisted that after studying economies and societies, the time had come, using similar methods, to deal with the third level, that of civilizations; and he spoke with strong approval of Michel Vovelle’s examina-tion of Provençal testaments. Le Goff stressed that the attention to everyday man suggested by ethnology “naturally leads to the study of mentalities, consid-ered as ‘that which changes least’ in historical evolution.” Both essays ended up supporting the validity of the Braudelian paradigm, at the same time extending the range of its applicability.8. It is not a simple matter to evaluate the import of this “at the same time.” In all institutions, innovations, while rupturing with the past, make headway by means of the reaffi rmation of a certain continuity with what has gone be-fore. In the years that followed, precisely while Braudel’s work was being translated into many languages (beginning with En glish) and was reaching a public far beyond the world of specialists, the paradigm that for the sake of con ve nience I have called Braudelian was rapidly declining. After Le Roy Ladurie had proclaimed that the French historical school founded by Bloch and Febvre must accept the American challenge and convert to the com-puter, he published the enormously successful Montaillou: a piece of research conducted in craftsmanlike fashion on a medieval village, population two hundred. Even Furet was dedicating himself to these themes of po liti cal history and the history of ideas that he had previously judged intrinsically resistant to serial history. Questions that had been considered peripheral were cropping up at the center of the discipline, and vice versa. Th e pages of the Annales (and the journals of half the world) were beset by themes pro-posed by Le Goff in 1973: the family, the human body, relations between the sexes, age groups, factions, charismatics. Studies on the history of price fl uc-tuations went into a brusque decline.In France one has spoken of nouvelle histoire to describe this change in the intellectual climate that coincides signifi cantly with the end of the long"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"microhistory . 201 period of economic development that had begun in 1945. Th e term is debat-able, but the basic characteristics of the phenomenon are clear. In the course of the 1970s and 1980s the history of mentalities to which Braudel attributed a marginal signifi cance grew in importance, often under the name “historical anthropology.” Th e ideological “ambiguity” emphasized by Le Goff in 1974 undoubtedly contributed to this success. Philippe Ariès has devoted some telling words to the subject: “Th e criticism of progress has passed from a reac-tionary right that had, moreover, abandoned it, to a left, or, rather, a leftism with poorly drawn borders, rough, but vigorous. I do indeed believe (it’s a hy-pothesis) that there is a connection between the new reticence of the 1960s in regard to development, progress, modernity, and the passion brought by young historians to the study of preindustrial societies and their mentalities.”Th ese words were implicitly autobiographical; as a young man Ariès had been a follower of Charles Maurras and active in the ranks of Action Fran-çaise. Beginning in the 1970s this “Sunday paint er” (historien du dimanche), as Ariès ironically described himself, gradually became integrated into the group of Annales historians; he even was elected to the École Pratique des Hautes Études. Th is academic event can be viewed as one of the many symp-toms of a much greater transformation that was neither solely French nor academic. Th e frequently unconscious resumption of the themes of roman-tic opposition to capitalism on the part of leftist ecological currents is a component of it.Th e “new reticence” to which Ariès alluded could become transformed into divergent positions. It may be remembered that Furet had proposed fi ghting the ethnocentric abstraction of theories of modernization with a dose of ethnol-ogy. Chaunu had suggested throwing overboard the ideals of modernity tied to the Enlightenment together with theories of modernization. Th e latter alternative— more radical than the ideological point of view— refused to bring the historian’s research tools into the discussion. Th e former alternative was moving in this direction but stopped halfway. Retrospectively, speaking primarily from my personal experience, I think that Italian research into mi-crohistory began from a diagnosis that agreed in part with Furet’s but that arrived at a totally diff erent prognosis.9. Th e element of agreement lies in the rejection of ethnocentrism and of the teleology that for Furet characterized the historiography transmitted by the nineteenth century. Th e affi rmation of a national entity, the advent of the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202 . microhistorybourgeoisie, the civilizing mission of the white race, and economic development furnished to historians a unifying principle of both a conceptual and a narra-tive order, depending on the point of view and the scale of observation adopted. Ethnographic history conceived along serial lines proposed breaking with this tradition. Here the paths traveled by serial history and microhistory diverge— a divergence that is at once intellectual and po liti cal.To select as a cognitive object only what is repetitive, and therefore capa-ble of being serialized, means paying a very high price in cognitive terms. First of all, on the chronological plane, ancient history, as Furet himself ob-served, precludes such treatment; and medieval history renders it very diffi cult (for many of the themes suggested by Le Goff the documentation is fragmentary). Second, on the thematic level, areas such as the history of ideas and po liti cal history (again as Furet would have it) by defi nition elude this type of investigation. But the most serious limitation of serial history emerges precisely through what should be its basic objective: “the equalization of indi-viduals in their roles of economic or sociocultural agents.” Th is idea of equal-ization is doubly deceiving. On the one hand, it distorts an obvious element: in any society the conditions of access to the production of documentation are tied to a situation of power and thus create an inherent imbalance. On the other hand, it cancels out many particulars in the existing documentation for the benefi t of what is homogeneous and comparable. With a trace of scholarly pride, Furet affi rmed: “the document, ‘facts,’ no longer exist for themselves, but in relationship to the series that precedes them and follows them; it is their relative value that becomes objective, and not their relationship to an ungrasp-able ‘real’ substance.”  It is therefore not surprising if the twice- fi ltered data in the series become “incomprehensible” in their relation to reality.Historical knowledge, obviously, involves the construction of documen-tary series. Less obvious is the attitude that the historian must assume with regard to the anomalies that crop up in the documentation. Furet proposed ignoring them, observing that the hapax (that which is unique documenta-tion) is not usable in the perspective of serial history. But the hapax, strictly speaking, does not exist. Any document, even the most anomalous, can be inserted into a series; but not only that: it can, if properly analyzed, shed light on a still- broader documentary series.10. In the early 1960s I began to study inquisitorial trials, hoping to reconstruct, in addition to the attitudes of the judges, those of the men and women ac-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"microhistory . 203cused of witchcraft. I quickly realized that this nonethnocentric approach would require comparison with the work of anthropologists, fi rst among whom was Claude Lévi- Strauss. But the historiographical, conceptual, and narrative implications of such a choice became clarifi ed for me only gradually, in the course of the years that separated I benandanti (1966) f rom Storia not-turna (1989). Along the way I wrote a book in which I attempted to recon-struct the ideas and attitudes of a sixteenth- century Friulian miller who was tried and condemned to death by the Inquisition, Il formaggio e i vermi (1976). Th e rejection of ethnocentrism had brought me not to serial history but to its opposite: the minute analysis of a circumscribed documentation, tied to a person who was otherwise unknown. In the introduction I took issue with an essay by Furet in the Annales in which he asserted that the history of the sub-altern classes in preindustrial societies can be studied only from a statistical point of view.Recently, Michel Vovelle rejected as fi ctitious the alternative between in-dividual biography and serial research. In principle, I agree. But in practice the choice does assert itself: it is a question of evaluating risks and advan-tages on a practical and, even more, on an intellectual plane. Roger Chartier wrote about Th e Cheese and the Worms that “it is on this reduced scale, and cer-tainly only on this scale, that we can understand, without deterministic reduc-tion, the relationship between systems of belief, of values and repre sen ta tions on one side, and social affi liations on another.”  Even someone not disposed to accept such an uncompromising conclusion has to admit that the experiment was not only legitimate but useful, if only for analyzing the results.By reducing the scale of observation, that for which another scholar could have been a simple footnote in a hypothetical monograph on the Protestant Reformation in the Friuli was transformed into a book. Th e motives that impelled me at that time to make this choice are not totally clear to me. I am suspicious of those that come to mind today (and naturally there are many) because I would not like to project into the past intentions that have been maturing over the years. Gradually I came to realize that many events and connections of which I was totally unaware infl uenced the decisions that I thought I had made independently— a banal fact in itself, but always sur-prising, because it contradicts our narcissistic fantasies. How much does my book owe (to take an obvious example) to the po liti cal climate in Italy during the early 1970s? Something, perhaps a lot; but I suspect that the motives for my choices should be searched for elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"204 . microhistoryTo discover them, at least in part, I shall begin by stating what may not be totally obvious. Th e Cheese and the Worms does not restrict itself to the recon-struction of an individual event; it narrates it. Furet had rejected narrative— and, more specifi cally, literary narrative— as an expression, typically teleologi-c a l, of t he “ h i stor y of e ve nt s,” whose t i me “ i s m ade up of a se r ie s of d i scont i nu it ie s described in the mode of the continuous: the classic subject matter of the narra-tive [récit].” Against this type of “literary” narration Furet contrasted the ex-amination of serial ethnographic history, problem by problem. He thus appro-priated that widely accepted commonplace that still today tacitly identifi es a specifi c form of narration, based on late- nineteenth- century realist novels, with historical narrative tout court. Granted, the fi gure of the omniscient historian- narrator, who unravels the slightest details of an event or the hid-den motivations that inspire the behavior of individuals, social groups, or states, has gradually established itself. But it is only one of the many possi-bilities, as the readers of Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Robert Musil should well know.Before beginning Th e Cheese and the Worms I had at length mulled over the relationship between research hypotheses and narrative strategies. Read-ing Queneau’s Exercices de style had powerfully whetted my desire to experi-ment. I had set out to reconstruct the intellectual, moral, and fantastic world of the miller Menocchio on the basis of sources produced by persons who had sent him to the stake. Th is in some way paradoxical project could evolve into an account that transforms the gaps in the documentation into a smooth surface. It could, but it seemed to me it should not, for reasons that were of a cognitive, ethical, and aesthetic order. Th e obstacles interfering with the research were integral elements in the documentation and thus had to become part of the account; the same for the hesitations and silences of the protagonist in the face of his persecutors’ questions— or mine. Th us the hypotheses, the doubts, the uncertainties became part of the narration; the search for truth became part of the exposition of the necessarily incom-plete truth attained. Could the result still be defi ned as “narrative history”? For a reader with the slightest familiarity with twentieth- century fi ction, the reply is obviously yes.11. But the impetus toward this type of narration (and more generally toward occupying myself with history) came to me from further off : from War and Peace, from Tolstoy’s conviction that a historical phenomenon can become"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"microhistory . 205comprehensible only by reconstructing the activities of all the persons who participated in it. Th is notion, and the sentiments that had spawned it (pop-u lism, fi erce disdain for the vacuous and conventional history of historians), left an indelible impression on me from the moment I fi rst read it. Th e Cheese and the Worms, the story of a miller whose death is decreed from afar, by a man (a pope) who one minute earlier had never heard his name, can be considered a small, distorted product of Tolstoy’s grand and intrinsically unrealizable proj-ect: the reconstruction of the numerous associations linking Napoleon’s head cold before the battle of Borodino, the disposition of the troops, and the lives of all the participants in the battle, down to the most humble soldier.In Tolstoy’s novel the private world (peace) and the public world (war) now run along parallel lines, now intersect; Prince André participates in the battle of Austerlitz, Pierre at Borodino. Th us Tolstoy proceeds along a path that had been opened up to him splendidly by Stendhal in his description of the battle of Waterloo seen through the eyes of Fabrizio del Dongo. Th e romanticized personages were bringing to light the painful inadequacy with which historians had dealt with a historical event par excellence (or presumed such). It was a formidable intellectual challenge that seemed to pertain to a past now vanished, just as are l’histoire- bataille and the polemic against it. But refl ecting on the battle as a historiographical theme can still be useful. From it emerges indirectly a fundamental problem in the historian’s trade.12. In Th e Battle between Alexander and Darius at the River Issus, the artist Albrecht Altdorfer, to represent the battle, selected a towering and distant vantage point, like that of an ea gle in fl ight. As if with the bird ’s keen sight he painted the light resplendent on armor, trappings, and harnesses, the banners’ brilliant colors and white plumes swaying on warriors’ helmets, the hordes of knights with their lances raised, resembling an im mense porcupine, and then, gradually receding toward the background, the mountains behind the battle-fi eld, the encampments, the waters and mists, the horizon arching to suggest the shape of the terrestrial sphere, the im mense sky in which burn the setting sun and waxing moon. No human eye will ever succeed in catching at once, as did Altdorfer, the historical specifi city (real or presumed) of a battle and its cosmic irrelevance (fi gure 10).A battle, strictly speaking, is invisible, as we have been reminded (and not only thanks to military censorship) by the images televised during the fi rst Gulf War. Only an abstract diagram or a visionary imagination such as"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"figure 10. Albrecht Altdorfer, Th e Battle between Alexander and Darius at the River Issus (Munich, Alte Pinakothek, 1929)."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"microhistory . 207Altdorfer’s can convey a global image of it. It seems proper to extend this conclusion to any event and with greater reason to what ever historical pro-cess. A close- up look permits us to grasp what eludes a comprehensive view-ing, and vice versa.Th is contradiction is at the heart of a chapter (“Th e Structure of the His-torical Universe”) in Siegfried Kracauer’s fi nal book, published posthumously with a foreword by Paul Oskar Kristeller: History: Th e Last Th ings before the Last. Although avowing himself to be more optimistic on this point than his friend Kracauer, Kristeller had to admit that “the discrepancy between gen-eral and special history, or as he calls it, macro and micro history, represents a serious dilemma.”  Queneau’s Les fl eurs bleues dates from 1967; Kracauer’s death, from a year before. We probably fi nd ourselves in this instance facing an in de pen dent invention. But what is important is not the term microhistory; it is the signifi cance that it gradually comes to assume in Kracauer’s mind.At fi rst for Kracauer, “microhistory” seems to be synonymous with mono-graphic research. But the comparison between “microhistory” and cinemato-graphic close- up (an obvious thing for the author of From Caligari to Hitler and Th eory of Film) introduces new elements. Kracauer observes that some research of a specifi c character, such as Hubert Jedin’s on the Councils of Constance and Basel, is capable of modifying the comprehensive visions de-lineated by macrohistory. Are we compelled to conclude, then, with Aby Warburg, that “God is in the detail”? It is the thesis sustained by “two great historians,” the Tolstoy of War and Peace and Sir Lewis Namier (the pairing suggested by Kracauer is signifi cant). But despite Kracauer’s sympathy for these positions, he recognizes that certain phenomena can be grasped only by means of a macroscopic perspective. Th is suggests that the reconciliation between macro- and microhistory is not at all taken for granted (as Toynbee wrongly believed). And yet it needs to be pursued. According to Kracauer, Marc Bloch off ered the best solution in his Feudal Society: a constant back- and- forth between micro- and macrohistory, between close- ups and extreme long shots, so as to continually thrust back into discussion the comprehen-sive vision of the historical pro cess through apparent exceptions and cases of brief duration. Th is methodological prescription led to an affi rmation of a decisively ontological nature: reality is fundamentally discontinuous and heterogeneous. Consequently, no conclusion attained apropos a determinate sphere can be transferred automatically to a more general sphere (what Kra-cauer calls the “law of levels”)."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"208 . microhistoryTh ese posthumous pages of Kracauer’s, who was not a professional histo-rian, still constitute today, in my opinion, the best introduction to microhis-tory. As far as I know, they have had no infl uence on the emergence of this historiographical current. Certainly not on me, since I learned about them with deplorable delay only a few years ago. But when I read them they seemed strangely familiar for two reasons. First, an indirect echo of them had reached me long before by way of my decisive encounter with Minima moralia, the masterpiece in which Th eodor Adorno, despite his belief in the idea of total-ity, and one he never renounced, implicitly demonstrated his own indebted-ness to the micrological tradition inaugurated by Georg Simmel, a tradition carried on by Adorno’s friend (and, in a sense, master) Siegfried Kracauer. Second, the latter’s ideas on history, beginning with the crucial one of the discontinuity of reality, are an explicit and conscious development of key phenomena in the culture of this century, from Proust to the cinema. Th e fact that certain ideas are in the air signifi es, after all, that even when start-ing from the same premises, it is possible to arrive at similar conclusions in de pen dently.13. It is often diffi cult to demonstrate the existence of intellectual conver-gence and, at the same time, the lack of direct contact. So, if I am not mistaken, the interest (going well beyond the relevance of the object) in the intellectual genealogy that I have attempted to reconstruct thus far is in part true, in part fi ctional; in part conscious, and in part unconscious. Looking at things from a distance, I realize that the researches of our original Einaudi “micro-storie group” were a fragment of a more general tendency, the pa ram e ters of which almost totally escaped me at the time. It may not be pure chance that the word microhistory was used fi rst in the title of a work that, in almost ma-niacal detail, describes a battle (although the conclusion of Stewart’s book on Gettysburg seems to evoke Conrad rather than Tolstoy). Even less casual is the fact that some years later, undoubtedly in de pen dently, Kracauer identifi ed microhistory with Tolstoy; I read this, I must confess, with plea sure mingled with some disappointment (my approach had not been so unusual after all).I am aware of a diffi culty. Tolstoy’s extraordinary capacity to communi-cate to the reader the physical, palpable certainty of reality seems incompat-ible with the wholly twentieth- century idea that I have placed at the core of microhistory— namely, that the obstacles interfering with research in the form of lacunae or misrepre sen ta tions in the sources must become part of"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"microhistory . 209the account. In War and Peace just the opposite happens. Everything that precedes the act of narration (from personal reminiscences to the memorials of the Napoleonic age) is assimilated and fused to permit the reader to enter into a relationship of special intimacy with the characters and participate di-rectly in their lives. Tolstoy leaps over the inevitable gap between the frag-mentary and distorted traces of an event (a battle, for instance) and the event itself. But this leap, this direct contact with reality, can take place only on the terrain of invention. It is precluded by defi nition from the historian, who has at his disposal only fragments of things and documents. Th e historiographi-cal frescoes that seek to communicate to the reader, through frequently me-diocre expedients, the illusion of a vanished reality tacitly remove this constit-uent limitation of the historical vocation. Microhistory chooses the opposite approach. It accepts the limitations while exploring their gnoseological impli-cations and transforming them into a narrative element.Th is approach had been anticipated in some respects by the Italian critic Renato Serra, in a brief but important essay written in 1912 and published posthumously: “Partenza di un gruppo di soldati per la Libia.”  In a letter to Benedetto Croce, Serra explained that he had started from Tolstoy’s ideas on history as expressed in War and Peace. In an article later included in the volume History: Its Th eory and Practice, Croce had repudiated Tol-stoy’s position, calling it absurd and skeptical: “we know at every moment all the history that we need to know”; consequently, the history that we do not know is identical to “the eternal phantom of the ‘thing itself.’ ”  Serra, in calling himself “a slave to the thing itself,” confessed to Croce that he felt much closer to Tolstoy, “only that,” he added, “my diffi culties are, or seem to be, more complex.” In eff ect, “Partenza” harks back to ideas of Tolstoy (without naming him) but takes them in a completely diff erent direction. Gruff letters from sol-diers to their families, newspaper articles written for the plea sure of a distant public, accounts of military actions hurriedly scribbled by a harried captain, the reworking by historians full of superstitious veneration for each of these documents— all these narratives, in de pen dently of their more or less direct character, have (Serra explains) a highly problematic relationship with real-ity. In phrases that become little by little more hurried and almost feverish, Serra registers the rhythm of a thought that revolves around the unresolved contradiction between the certainty of the existence of the “thing itself ” and distrust in the possibility of encompassing it by means of the evidence:"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"210 . microhistoryTh ere are people who imagine in good faith that a document can be the expres-sion of reality. . . . As if a document could express something diff erent from itself. . . . A document is a fact. Th e battle is another fact (an infi nity of other facts). Th e two cannot make one. . . . Th e man who acts is a fact. And the man who narrates is another fact. . . . Every piece of evidence provides testimony only of itself; of its proper moment, of its proper origin, of its proper end, and of noth-ing else. . . . All the critical judgments to which we subject history involve the concept of true history, of absolute reality. It is necessary to face up to the ques-tion of memory; not insofar as it is forgetfulness, but insofar as it is memory. Ex-istence of things in themselves.14. I read Serra’s work only at the beginning of the 1980s. But the gist of it had reached me more than two de cades earlier through Arsenio Frugoni’s teaching in Pisa. In his book Arnaldo da Brescia nelle fonti del secolo XII (1954) he had shown how the specifi c perspective of each narrative source contributes to present the same personage in an alternating, diff erent light. Today I feel that Frugoni’s sarcasm over the naive eff orts by positivist erudites to make the pieces fi t together had as its point of departure Serra’s antipositivist polemic (“Every piece of evidence provides testimony only of itself; of its proper mo-ment, of its proper origin, of its proper end, and of nothing else”), which it sought to surpass in its skeptical implications.I am not certain that Frugoni knew Serra’s “Partenza di un gruppo di soldati per la Libia.” But that it had been read or reread recently by Italo Cal-vino seems obvious from his “Memories of a Battle” (“Ricordo di una batta-glia”) (1974), a writing of a completely diff erent kind. “It is necessary to face up to the question of memory,” Serra had written. Calvino takes up the ques-tion, even if his battle is an episode of partisan warfare that he is recalling at a distance of almost thirty years. At fi rst everything seems clear to him, easily within reach: “It is not true that I no longer remember anything, my memories are still there, hidden in the gray matter of the brain.” But the negative state-ment “It is not true” shows that he is already assailed by doubt, that recollec-tions crumble as memory brings them to light: “And my fear now is that as soon as some remembrance forms, it will immediately appear in a faulty light, contrived, sentimental, as war and youth always are, and become a segment in the story with the style of that time, which cannot tell us how things really were but only how we thought we saw them and said them.” Can memory abol-ish the mediation of the illusions and distortions of the self of a bygone time in order to attain “things” (“the things themselves”)? Th e conclusion echoes, with a bitter ironic twist, the false confi dence of the beginning: “Everything that I"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"microhistory . 211have written thus far serves to make me understand that I remember almost nothing of that morning.”Th e closing words of “Memories of a Battle” (“Th e sense of everything that appears and disappears”) insist on the precariousness of our relation-ship with the past. And yet that “almost nothing” suggests that the past, in spite of everything, is not unattainable. Th is conclusion is important subjec-tively for me, having learned much from Calvino, but also objectively, since it explodes the current image of him (of the later Calvino) as a postmodernist writer. Th e laborious and painful autobiographical refl ection that emerges from “Memories of a Battle” provides a diff erent image than the one now in fashion of the euphoric skeptic.15. In a recent essay, F. R. Ankersmit, a Dutch student of historiographical theory, argued that the tendency to focus attention on scraps rather than on larger entities is the most typical expression of “postmodernist historiogra-phy.” To elucidate this point Ankersmit used a vegetal meta phor (one that actually goes back to Lewis Namier, and perhaps to Tolstoy). In the past historians were preoccupied with the trunk of a tree or its branches; their postmodernist successors busy themselves only with the leaves— namely, with minute fragments of the past that they investigate in an isolated manner, in-de pen dently of the more or less larger context (branches, trunk) of which they were a part. Ankersmit, who accepts the skeptical notions formulated by Hayden White in the early 1970s, looks with great favor on this shift toward the fragmentary. In his opinion it expresses an antiessentialist or antifounda-tionalist attitude that brings to light (Ankersmit is not frightened by formal contradictions) the “fundamentally postmodernist nature” of historiography: activity of an artistic type that produces narratives incommensurable among themselves. Th e ambition to know the past has waned: the signifi cance of the fragments is sought in the present, the way “in which their pattern can be adapted to other forms of civilization existing today.” As examples of this historiographical tendency Ankersmit cites two French books (Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s Montaillou and Georges Duby’s Sunday of Bouvines), an American work (Natalie Zemon Davis’s Th e Return of Martin Guerre), and a non ex is tent book (Microhistories, by the undersigned).In the past de cade Giovanni Levi and I have unceasingly argued against the relativist positions, including the one warmly espoused by Ankersmit, that reduce historiography to a textual dimension, depriving it of any cognitive"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"212 . microhistoryvalue. There is no contradiction between this polemic and the debt I have acknowledged in these pages toward Calvino and more generally to-ward the nineteenth- and twentieth- century novel. Th e experimental attitude that brought together, at the end of the 1970s, the group of Italian students of microhistory (“a history with additives,” as Franco Venturi ironically dubbed it) was based on a defi nite awareness that all the phases through which re-search unfolds are constructed and not given: the identifi cation of the object and its importance; the elaboration of the categories through which it is analyzed; the criteria of proof; the stylistic and narrative forms by which the results are transmitted to the reader. But this accentuation of the constructive moment inherent in the research was combined with an explicit rejection of the skepti-cal implications (postmodernist, if you will) so largely present in Eu ro pe an and American historiography of the 1980s and 1990s. In my opinion the dis-tinctive quality of Italian microhistory must be looked for in this cognitive wager. I should like to add that my own work during these years, even if in large part absorbed by a book decisively macrohistoric in approach (Ecstasies), proceeded, at least in my intentions, along this twofold track.16. Piero della Francesca, Galileo, a community of nineteenth- century Pied-montese weavers, a Ligurian valley in the sixteenth century: these examples selected at random show that Italian research in microhistory has looked at subjects of acknowledged importance as well as themes that had been previ-ously ignored or relegated to spheres considered inferior, such as local history. What all these investigations have in common programmatically is the insis-tence on context— exactly the opposite of the isolated contemplation of the fragmentary advocated by Ankersmit. But although the choice of Galileo does not require any prior justifi cation, we have to ask ourselves: why precisely that community, why precisely that valley? In these cases, the reference, ex-plicit or implicit, to a comparative dimension is inevitable. Franco Ramella (Terra e telai, 1984) and Osvaldo Raggio (Faide e parentele, 1990) have shown us that the in- depth study of the Val di Mosso and of the Fontanabuona com-pel us to look diff erently at such problems as protoindustry and the birth of the modern state. But to recognize the richness of the results is still not enough. An object, as we saw, may be chosen because it is typical (González y González) or because it is repetitive and therefore capable of being serialized (Braudel, apropos the fait divers). Italian microhistory has confronted the question of comparison with a diff erent and, in a certain sense, opposite approach:"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"microhistory . 213through the anomalous, not the analogous. First of all, it hypothesizes the more improbable sort of documentation as being potentially richer: the “excep-tional normal” of Edoardo Grendi’s justly famous quip. Second, it demon-strates, as was done, for example, by Giovanni Levi (L’eredità immateriale) and by Simona Cerutti (La Ville et les métiers), that any social structure is the result of interaction and of numerous individual strategies, a fabric that can be recon-stituted only from close observation. Signifi cantly, the relationship between this microscopic dimension and the larger contextual dimension became in both cases, though so diverse, the or ga niz ing principle in the narration. As Kracauer had already foreseen, results obtained in a microscopic sphere cannot be automatically transferred to a macroscopic sphere (and vice versa). Th is het-erogeneity— we are just beginning to perceive the implications— constitutes both the greatest diffi culty and the greatest potential benefi t of microhistory.17. Giovanni Levi, speaking recently of microhistory, concluded: “this is a self- portrait, not a group portrait.” I had proposed doing the same, but did not succeed. Both the boundaries of the group to which I belonged and my own boundaries of self seemed retrospectively shifting and uncertain. To my surprise I discovered how important to me, unknowingly, were books I had never read, events and persons I did not know existed. If this is a self- portrait, then its model are the paintings of Umberto Boccioni in which the street enters into the house, the landscape into the face, the exterior invades the interior, the I is porous.postscriptumDomenico Scarpa, whom I thank with plea sure, brought to my attention that the word microhistory appears in writings by Andrea Zanzotto that date back to the 1960s, specifi cally:1. In a passage of Retorica su: lo sbandamento, il principio “resistenza” (VI), published in the collection La beltà (1968), containing poems written between 1961 and 1967 (“most from the last four years”: see Le poesie e prose scelte, ed. Stefano Dal Bianco and Gian Mario Villalta [Milan: Mondadori, 1999], p. 309).2. In the “Author’s notes” (p. 352) Zanzotto writes: “And this is a way of entering in the templum- tempus of a history that finally is ‘true,’"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"214 . microhistorywhich nevertheless, from a certain perspective, can appear outside maximum time, in the shadow of the possible evanescence of the idea of history itself, current today. In this shadowy realm everything tends to fl atten out into microhistory (a tale). Th e templum- tempus is a term from Heidegger, here used freely.”3. “Microhistory” makes an appearance with a similar meaning in Zan-zotto’s, “Alcune prospettive sulla poesia oggi,” L’a p p r o d o L e t t e r a r i o 35 (1966): 1137: “Science and technology have created an obstruction, a congestion of ‘revelations’ (invention and discovery), enough to justify in large part the appellation of apocalyptic given to our age. Th e fi nal unmasking, the demystifying- demythologizing have fi nally turned themselves particularly against that which just yesterday understood as ‘macrohistory’ (oriented by transcendence or by dialectic), has transfi gured itself into ‘microhistory’ fading into ahistoricity.”In these passages, as we see, Zanzotto used the word microhistory in a very diff erent sense from that which Italian historians would give to it subse-quently. But Scarpa notes that as far back as 1962, in his critical review of the anthology I novissimi, Zanzotto contraposed to Sanguinetti’s “archhistory” a history that “actually tended to take the form of tales, nugae, dynamics (m o t o) of depressed areas” (Le poesie e prose scelte, p. 1110). I wonder if Zanzotto, who obviously for quite some time had been contemplating the idea of the trans-formation of greater history into fables, might not have obtained the word microhistory from Queneau (Les fl eurs bleues, 1965), a hypothesis that cannot be verifi ed at the moment, as Gian Mario Villalta kindly informs me."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"215Th e path which brought me meta phor ical ly from northeastern Italy, where my research on witchcraft began, to the Central Asian steppes is a tortuous one. I shall try to trace the journey.Th e great French sinologist Marcel Granet once said that “la méthode, c’est le chemin après qu’on l’a parcouru”: method is the path after one has al-ready taken it. Th e word method actually comes from the Greek, even if the etymology proposed by Granet—meta- hodos, “after the path”— may be imag-inary. But Granet’s quip had a serious— in fact, polemical— side to it: in any scholarly situation a discussion on method has some value only when it is an a posteriori refl ection on concrete research, not when it shows up (by far the most frequent case) as a series of a priori prescriptions. Perhaps the following account of the way in which my research began and subsequently developed may off er some confi rmation, however slight and negligible, of Granet’s ironic remark.To recount the itinerary of a piece of research when it has already reached a conclusion (even if, by defi nition, a provisional conclusion) always brings a risk with it: a teleological one. Retrospectively, the uncertainties and errors vanish, or, rather, they become transformed into the steps which lead di-rectly to the goal: the historian knows from the start what he wants, he searches for it, and fi nally fi nds it. But things do not happen like this in ac-tual research. Life in any laboratory as described by Bruno Latour, a histo-rian of science with an anthropological background, is much more confusing and untidy.CHAPTER 15Witches and Shamans"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"216 . witches and shamans1. Th e experience that I am about to describe is itself fairly confused and un-tidy, though it pertains not to a group but to an individual— myself. It begins with an illumination, a research topic (witchcraft) which suddenly suggests itself to a student in his twenties at the University of Pisa toward the end of the 1950s. Until that very moment I was not at all certain that I wanted to become a historian, but as soon as the subject presented itself I no longer had any doubts. Th is was my topic, the topic I would be willing to work on for years (little did I imagine how many).I have asked myself often about the reasons for this unexpected enthusi-asm, which, to me, retrospectively, seems to have all the characteristics of falling in love: the suddenness, the enthusiasm, the lack of awareness (at least initially). I knew nothing about the history of witchcraft: my fi rst move, later repeated many times for other research projects, was to look up the entry on witchcraft in the Enciclopedia italiana to obtain a bit of basic information. It may have been the fi rst time I really experienced what I would call “the eu-phoria of ignorance”: the sensation of not knowing anything but being on the verge of beginning to learn something. I think that the intense plea sure as-sociated with that moment helped to keep me from becoming a specialist, of delving into a well- defi ned or limited fi eld of study. Not only have I preserved the urge to confront periodically themes and areas of research of which I am totally ignorant, but it has grown more marked with the passing of time.It happens often enough that a second- year university student chooses a research topic of which he is totally ignorant. But it is perhaps less common to note that a similar disparity between little or no preliminary knowledge and the importance of the objective probably characterizes all or almost all the truly important choices that a person makes in the course of a lifetime. (Retrospectively we call this disparity destiny). But what is it then that drives us to choose? At the time, behind my enthusiasm for the research theme that had suddenly loomed before my eyes, I think I can guess now that there lurked a congeries of childhood memories and experiences con-fusedly muddled with much more recent anxieties and prejudices.How greatly was my choice infl uenced by the fairy tales that were re-counted to me as a child? My mother used to read to me fables that had been collected at the end of the nineteenth century by the Sicilian writer Luigi Capuana. Th ey were fi lled with every imaginable sort of magic and horror: she- dragons whose mouths were bloodied from the fl esh of “lambs and kids who looked like children”; tiny beings innocent in appearance, bedecked in"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 217plumed turbans, who, after the page was turned, became transformed into monstrous werewolves with cavernous jaws. Crocetta, a young girl of the vil-lage in the Abruzzi where my parents lived for three years, used to tell my brother and me (as I discovered in something my mother, Natalia Ginzburg, had written in her Inverno in Abruzzo) stories not very diff erent from those collected by Capuana. In one of them a boy is killed by his stepmother and given to his father to eat: at which point his bones, stripped of fl esh, begin to sing: “And my dismal stepmother / Has cooked me in a kettle / While my gluttonous father / Has made a nice mouthful out of me.” Th rough the sin-ister ambiguities of such tales I, like all children, must have begun to decipher reality, beginning with the mysterious world of adults.Cannibalism and animal metamorphoses are at the heart of Storia notturna. Th e decision to study witchcraft immediately signifi ed for me concentrating on the revelations of witches, in many respects so similar to the fables I heard in my early childhood. But the underlying motives for that choice, barely discerned at the time, were joined by others of an emotional and ideological order. I was born into a family that po liti cally leaned to the left. My father, Leone Ginzburg, born in Odessa, who emigrated to Italy with his family, lost his position in the Department of Rus sian Literature at the University of Turin in 1934 because of his refusal to swear an oath of loyalty to the Fas-cist regime imposed on all academics. He was twenty- fi ve at the time. Not long after that he was arrested for anti- Fascist activities and passed two years in prison. When Italy entered the war in 1940 as Germany’s ally, as a Jew and as an anti- Fascist he was interned at Pizzoli, a village in the Abruzzi near L’Aquila, where he was joined by his family. At the fall of the Fascist regime he went to Rome, where he resumed his po liti cal activities. Arrested and recognized by the Nazis, he died in 1944 in the wing of the prison Regina Coeli which was under German control. In his book Il pop u lismo russo Franco Venturi, the Turin historian, spoke of the writings and person of my father, whom he had known and been close to in the circles of anti- Fascist émigrés in Paris, as “a new and original incarnation” of the spirit of the narodniki. At the heart of the Rus sian populist experience one fi nds a strong moral and intellectual affi nity for the values expressed by peasant society. I discovered a similar perspective in a book which was published after the war and then promptly translated into several languages, Cristo si è fermato a Eboli (Christ Stopped at Eboli). Th e author— the writer, physician, and paint er Carlo Levi, had been a friend of my father’s, and had participated with him"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"218 . witches and shamansin the anti- Fascist activities of the group Giustizia e Libertà. He, too, was condemned by the regime to internal exile in a small village in Lucania. Undoubtedly, these affi nities contributed to the profound impact that Christ Stopped at Eboli had on me when I read it as an adolescent. A feeling of iden-tifi cation was inevitable, even if the village described by Levi was much more isolated and primitive than the one where I had passed a part of my early childhood. But I was struck by more than the circumstances of the writing of the book. Levi never conceals the diff erences between himself and the peas-ants of southern Italy, from their ideas and beliefs; but he never assumes a tone of superiority toward them. He takes everything seriously, including their charms and magic rituals. From Christ Stopped at Eboli I think I learned that intellectual detachment and emotional participation, passion for rationality and respect for cultural diversity, are not only compatible attitudes but also capable of sustaining one another. From my mother I learned something even more important (not limited to my research)— namely, that there is no relation between intelligence and social and cultural position.Looking back, I think that both the lasting impression made by the fables I listened to in my childhood and the pop u lism I imbibed from my family milieu contributed to my research becoming oriented from the outset to-ward the study of the victims of persecution rather than to the persecution itself. Historiographically it was an anomalous choice in two ways. At the end of the 1950s, witchcraft, which had long before entered the canon of an-thropological study, was still considered by the majority of historians (as the En glishman Keith Th omas observed with some irony) a marginal and bi-zarre area of research. At most, one admitted the legitimacy of studying the persecution of witchcraft as an aberrant episode in the intellectual history of late medieval and early modern Eu rope. During the 1970s and ’80s this actu-ally became a fashionable historiographical current: but the interest of histo-rians, even though much more complex than in the past, has continued to focus almost exclusively on the persecution and its cultural and social mech-anisms. Th e victims almost always have remained in the shadows.Th ese are some of the motives that impelled me in this direction. At this point, I should add another: the diffi culty of research of this type. Some of the most serious obstacles emerged along the way: at the time I noticed one especially— the apparently similar forms assumed by the practice of witchcraft (not by its persecution) in ages and places far removed from one another. I thought that it would be necessary, in order to reintroduce witchcraft into"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 219history, to historicize its apparently atemporal features. Obviously there was an inevitable trace of youthful arrogance in this willingness to confront a cognitive challenge: the desire to prove to others, and especially to oneself, what we are capable of, on the threshold of the shadowy edge discussed by Conrad.I have left for last an element which struck me many years later, when a friend brought to my attention that the choice to study witchcraft, and espe-cially the victims of the persecution of witchcraft, was not so strange after all for a Jew who had experienced persecution himself. I was dumbfounded by this simple remark. How could such an obvious fact have eluded me? And yet for years the analogy between Jew and witch, and the resulting possibility that I could have identifi ed myself with the subject of my research, had never dawned on me. Today I am inclined to view in this the eff ect of repression. What is at once both evident and hidden, Freud taught us, is that which we do not want to behold.2. Although I have gone on at some length in discussing these personal cir-cumstances, I should like to resist the narcissistic temptation which is in all of us and look at them as the data of an experiment in vitro. It is or should be obvious that the biography of a historian— from family circumstances to education and, of course, friendships— is not irrelevant to an understanding of his or her work. But usually one does not go beyond the mere stating of this fact. I should like to take advantage of what, conventionally, we call iden-tity, in a sense that is both biological and personal (even if a term like contigu-ity would be preferable), between the person I am now and the person I was then to examine retrospectively the role these elements played in my actual research. Th ose I have mentioned thus far contributed to the selection of a theme (witchcraft) from a par tic u lar vantage point (the victims of persecu-tion). But none of these factors, from the most subconscious (my being a Jew) to the most conscious (the desire to cross over disciplines), implied a specifi c research hypothesis. Th e idea with which I began— namely, that witchcraft in some cases could have been a rough and elementary form of class struggle— today simply seems like an attempt to justify, to myself and to others, research lacking true historiographical legitimacy. My willingness to transgress disci-plines, in other words, was not boundless.Behind my hypothesis was an encounter with essays by Eric Hobsbawm, those collected in his Primitive Rebels (1959), but especially a survey of studies"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"220 . witches and shamansentitled “Per la storia delle classi subalterne” (“For the History of the Subal-tern Classes”), which he published in 1960 in Società, the ideological journal of the Italian Communist Party. Th e title of the survey echoed a term used by Antonio Gramsci in his Prison Notebooks. For me, as for so many other Italian students of my generation, reading Gramsci had been a decisive event. But the Gramsci that Hobsbawm proposed was a Gramsci read and inter-preted through the prism of British social anthropology. Th e works of an-thropology into which I delved in those years were actually others: fi rst of all there was Lévi- Strauss, who thirty years later was to serve as the principal interlocutor of my Storia notturna.I began by reading the inquisitorial trials housed in the Archivio di Stato in Modena. Among those documents I came upon a 1519 trial against a peasant woman, Chiara Signorini, accused of having tried to murder, through magic, her mistress, a woman who had chased her and her husband away from the piece of land which they worked. “Historians usually fi nd what they are look-ing for, a fact that makes me uneasy,” wrote Morton Smith, the American student of Judaism and Christian origins. I am not certain whether I, too, may have experienced some embarrassment in the face of the unexpected con-fi rmation of my hypothesis that witchcraft was a basic instrument of class warfare, but, in any case, my research promptly took another direction.Early on, by the time of the conclusion to the essay I wrote on that trial, I emphasized that it might be possible to discern in inquisitorial documents not only the overlay in the text that could be attributed to the judges, but also (and this was much more unexpected) the voices of the accused, expres-sions of a starkly diff erent culture. Th e struggle and confl ict remained central, but they were transferred to a cultural plane, capable of being deci-phered by a close reading of the texts. Th e writings of some of the Romance philologists— Erich Auerbach, Leo Spitzer, Gianfranco Contini— encouraged me to proceed in this direction. I tried to learn from them the art of “slow reading” (this, as Roman Jakobson has reminded us, is philology), applying it to nonliterary texts.I say all this with the wisdom of hindsight: I do not want to project into the past a clarity that I certainly lacked then. In 1961– 1962 I went about Italy on the trail of inquisitorial archives. Th ere were moments of doubt and disap-pointment when I thought I was wasting time. My initial hypothesis of per-ceiving witchcraft as an elementary form of class struggle no longer pleased me, but I could not seem to replace it with a more satisfactory one. I came to"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 221Venice, to the State Archives which house one of Italy’s richest inquisitorial collections: more than one hundred and fi fty large bundles (buste) of more than three thousand trials, which span over two and a half centuries from the mid- sixteenth to the end of the eigh teenth, at which time the Inquisition was suppressed in Venice. Each day scholars request a limited number of bundles: at the time I believe the limit was three. Since I did not know, literally, what I was searching for, I put in my request at random— for example, bundles no. 8, 15, and 37— and then I began to leaf through the trial rec ords. I had the feel-ing I was playing a sort of Venetian roulette. Th ese trivial details underline the total unpredictability of my discovery: the proceedings in 1591 against a young drover of Latisana, a small village not too far from Venice. Th e herds-man, named Menichino della Nota, recounted to the inquisitor that four times yearly he went out at night in spirit, together with some others who, like him, had been born with the caul and were called benandanti (at the time a completely new and incomprehensible word to me), to fi ght against war-locks in a vast fi eld of roses, the fi eld of Josaphat. If the benandanti prevailed, the harvest would be abundant; if the warlocks conquered, there would be famine.I remember vividly that after reading the document, of not more than three or four pages, I became so agitated that I had to interrupt my work. While I strolled up and down outside the archive smoking one cigarette after another it struck me that I had had a wonderful stroke of luck. I still think so, but today this observation seems insuffi cient. A totally unexpected docu-ment had been laid before me by pure chance: why, I ask myself, did I react with such excitement? It is as though I had recognized instantly a text that had been totally unknown to me until a moment before— not only that, but one that was completely unlike any other trial of the Inquisition that I had ever seen. And this is precisely the point.As a student I had the good fortune of taking a seminar with Gianfranco Contini. At one point, he began telling us an anecdote. Th ere were two Ro-mance philologists, both French, but otherwise very dissimilar. Th e fi rst had a long beard and a passion for morphological, grammatical, and syntactical irregularities; when he encountered one he would stroke his beard and mur-mur with plea sure: “C’est bizarre.” Th e second philologist, a true representa-tive of the Cartesian tradition, with a highly lucid mind and totally bald, tried in every way possible to lead every linguistic phenomenon back to a rule: and when he succeeded he rubbed his hands, saying “C’est satisfaisant"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"222 . witches and shamanspour l’esprit.” I am willing to admit that the confl ict between anomaly and analogy embodied in Contini’s two philologists (a contest that began more than two thousand years ago with the grammarians of the Alexandrine age) is a confl ict in name only. In truth, they are complementary positions. And yet I have to confess that my impulse is to identify with the bearded philolo-gist, the one who loved anomalies: this is due to a psychological inclination which, however, I would consider justifying even on rational terms. Th e vio-lation of the norm contains even the norm itself, inasmuch as it is presup-posed; the opposite is not true. Anyone who studies the functioning of a soci-ety beginning from the entirety of its norms, or from statistical fi ctions such as the average man or the average woman, inevitably remains on the surface of things. I think that the in- depth analysis of an anomalous case is much more fruitful, though the contemplation of an isolated oddity does not usually in-terest me.Th is is the course that I ended up pursuing with witchcraft. I started from an anomalous document (the questioning of the benandante Menichino della Nota) and ended up reconstructing an anomalous and geo graph i cally peripheral phenomenon (the beliefs of the Friulian benandanti). Th is, in turn, provided the key to decipher the origins of the witches’ Sabbath on a huge scale— the whole of Eurasia. Storia notturna, just like I benandanti twenty years earlier, literally originated from these three pages found by chance so many years ago in the Archivio di Stato in Venice. What was it that induced me, I asked myself, to react so strongly to a totally unexpected document? I think I can answer: the same sort of reasoning that might have persuaded someone else to consider the same document as largely irrelevant, if not actually to push it aside altogether. Today, and even more so thirty years ago, the account of an ecstatic experience off ered by a sixteenth- century herdsman in fairy- tale and absolutely exceptional terms most likely would be treated by a serious histo-rian as colorful evidence of the ignorance of people who obstinately ignored the instruction imparted by ecclesiastical authorities.Th e chance which brought me to the inquisitorial dossier of the benan-dante Menichino della Nota might never have occurred. And yet at times it crossed my mind that the document was there waiting for me, and that my entire past life had predisposed me to fi nd it. I believe there is a nucleus of truth in all this absurd fantasizing. Knowing, as Plato wrote, is always an act of recognizing. It is only that which we already know, that which is already part of our myriad experiences, that permits us to apprehend what is new,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 223isolating it from the mass of miscellaneous and casual pieces of information that continually plummet down on us.3. In the witchcraft trials celebrated in Eu rope over two and a half centuries, from the beginning of the fi fteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century and beyond, we behold in almost every instance communication— coerced, propped up by psychological infl uences and the menace of torture— which moves unilaterally. Th e judges, whether lay or ecclesiastical, knew what they could expect from the accused, and they pressed for it by suggestive ques-tioning or by force. Th ey did not always obtain what they wanted: occasionally, the defendants persisted in proclaiming their innocence, or succumbed to the torture. To be sure, not everything that was confessed resulted from the pres-sure exerted by the judges: the descriptions of charms and magic intended to achieve some illicit end clearly emanated from the diff erent culture of the de-fendants. But in the case of the Sabbath— that nocturnal gathering fi lled with orgies, banquets, and the paying of homage to the devil— the men and women accused of witchcraft seem to be only reproducing, with just a few variations, a scheme developed by demonologists and then imposed during the persecution of witchcraft in most of Eu rope and eventually the Americas.Th e picture that emerges from the benandanti trials is entirely diff erent. Th ese proceedings are dominated (especially the earlier ones) by a total fail-ure to communicate between judges and defendants. Th e benandanti spoke, often without even being asked, of the battles for fertility which they fought at night, in spirit, armed with stalks of fennel, against witches and warlocks armed with canes of sorghum. For the inquisitors this was all incomprehen-sible; the very term benandante was new to them, and for over fi fty years they kept asking what it meant. It is this inability to communicate that brought to the surface a deep and hidden stratum of beliefs: an ecstatic cult hinging on fertility, which was still very much alive in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries among the peasants in a northeasterly region like the Friuli, then under Venetian domination.After an initial baffl ement, the inquisitors tried to orient themselves. Since the tales of the nocturnal fertility battles made them think of the Sab-bath, they tried to coax the benandanti, without recourse to torture, to admit they were warlocks. Th e benandanti at fi rst protested vigorously in the face of this pressure: but gradually they gave in. In their revelations, given over a fi fty- year span, we see bit by bit the image of the witches’ Sabbath insinuate"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"224 . witches and shamansitself. Th is mutation, which we can trace step- by- step, as if in slow motion, made me wonder if a similar phenomenon— namely, the imposition of the image of the sabbat on a stratum of beliefs extraneous to it— could be verifi ed elsewhere.But this hypothesis, which I attempted to verify in Storia notturna, still does not tell us anything about the ecstatic experiences recounted by the benandanti with such an abundance of colorful details. Unlike the inquisi-tors, I was not in a position to infl uence their accounts. But I, too, just like the inquisitors, tried to turn into an analogy the anomaly I had stumbled upon, inserting it into an appropriate category. Th e similarity between benandanti and shamans struck me with what seemed irresistible evidence. In both in-stances we are dealing with individuals whose physical or psychological char-acteristics, frequently tied to the circumstances of their birth, designate them as highly skilled in achieving states of ecstasy. In both cases the ecstasy is accompanied by the going forth of the spirit, often in the shape of an ani-mal. In both cases the spirit, whether of the shaman or the benandante, be-comes involved in hazardous activities on which the health or material well- being of the community depends.In the preface to I Benandanti: Th e Night Battles, I tried to explain that I had not dealt with the relationship between benandanti and shamans, which I pronounced unquestioned, so as not to sink to the level of a purely typological comparison. I stated that by doing so I was following the exam-ple of Marc Bloch, who, in his Rois thaumaturges, had juxtaposed strictly historical comparisons between phenomena belonging to societies that were historically contiguous and to anthropological studies of societies without documented historical ties. Bloch, writing in 1924, cited J. G. Frazer as an example of this second type of correlation. But almost a half century later, I was not able to deal with the question in the same terms. Th e ahistorical comparison to be reckoned with was that of Lévi- Strauss, or at least so I thought. For a time, while writing Th e Night Battles, I played around with the idea of presenting my documentation in two diff erent ways: the fi rst, historical; the second, formal- structural. I was under the impression that by choosing the fi rst of the alternatives (as I ended up doing), I could not suc-ceed in dealing satisfactorily with the elements which seemed to be histori-cally intractable, the fi rst of which were the analogies between benandanti and shamans."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 225Th e dilemma “history or structure” cropped up anew in the mid- 1970s when I decided to confront the problems I had left unresolved in the book on the benandanti, but on a much larger scale than just the area of the Friuli. Meanwhile, my position had changed, now taking two apparently opposing directions. On the one hand, I was no longer willing to exclude from my re-search possible ahistorical connections. On the other, I was no longer so convinced that the relationship between benandanti and shamans was purely typological. Th e fi rst path took me away from historiography; the second led me back in, but through a problem that any historian would have judged simply inappropriate.Th e book which I ended up writing, Storia notturna (Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches’ Sabbath), is the result of these contrasting pressures. It opens with a fi rst, defi nitely historical part founded on the emergence of the idea of the conspiracy, the mainstay of the inquisitorial ste reo type of the Sabbath. Th is is followed by a second part, or ga nized about purely morphological cri-teria. It analyzes a number of ecstatic cults of a shamanic type, which can be documented over much of Eu rope. Th e Friulian benandanti reappear in this context, in a maze of cults which includes the kresniki of the Balkan Penin-sula, the burkudzäutä of the Caucasus, the Hungarian táltos, the noajdi of Lapland, and so forth. Th e inclusion of Hungary and Lapland are especially signifi cant because these areas belong to the linguistic Finno- Ugric sphere, inhabited by peoples whose distant ancestors came or could have come from central Asia. In the cases of the Hungarian táltos and of the Lapp noajdi the resemblance to shamans is especially close. We can consider them a bridge between central Asia and such regions as the Friuli, the Balkan Peninsula, or Caucasian Ossetia, inhabited by peoples speaking Indo- European languages. How can we explain this geo graph i cal distribution? Chapter 1 in the third part of Storia notturna proposes a historical solution consisting of a possible diff usion of shamanistic beliefs and practices from Asia to Eu rope, by way of the Scythians, who spoke an Ira ni an language, thus belonging to Indo- European stock, perhaps originating in central Asia. A few centuries before the Christian era they settled in an area north of the Black Sea, whence they entered into contact with Greeks and Celts. But this chapter, entitled “Eur-asian Conjectures,” ends by stressing the limitations in diff usion theories. As Claude Lévi- Strauss wrote, cultural transmission can be explained by exter-nal connections, but only internal connections can explain their permanence."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"226 . witches and shamansTh is objection thrusts to the foreground once again the dilemma “history or structure.” I have thought for quite some time that the impossibility of choos-ing between them was connected to a lessening within me (and around me) of the ideological motivations which in the past had urged me on toward an ex-planation in historical terms. In my mind I have often compared myself to Buridan’s donkey (forced to die from hunger), renouncing the completion of my book, stuck between two interpretations that from the documentary as-pect were equally valid.Not long ago this dilemma appeared to me in a new light. It took the form of a possibility suggested to me by Adriano Sofri when he connected a sen-tence in my book on the Sabbath that dealt with the possibility of demon-strating experimentally the existence of human nature with what has been called my mother’s “personal doctrine of natural law.” I asked myself if the opposite thesis, the one from which I had set out twenty- fi ve years earlier, could instead be traced back to the historicism of my father. I do not think I can rule this out even if the historicism that initially guided my research was not Croce’s (whose books I read in copies belonging to my father, who had been very attached to him), but its radical version, disowned by Croce, as proposed by Ernesto De Martino in his Il mondo magico. Th e existence of this psychological dimension, of which I was at fi rst totally unaware, could have infl uenced my work in two ways. First, the dilemma which confronted me for so long could have become simply paralyzing in the same way that the child feels unable to choose when he is asked whom he loves more, his mother or his father; second, I might have felt impelled to fi nd some solution which might be compatible not only with the required documentation, but with my psychological demands as well.4. One thing should be clear: I certainly do not think that the specifi c an-swers with which I ended up in my research were psychologically deter-mined. I ask myself, however, if, to become acceptable to me, they perhaps had to be reconciled with a subconscious psychological veto that might have rejected them as absurd or unfounded. If this veto indeed exists, as I believe it does, and not just in my case, I can understand in hindsight why my deci-sion to evade the whole dilemma seemed acceptable. Th e second chapter in part 3 of Storia notturna, the longest in the book, attempts to combine the two perspectives— the historical and the structural or morphological— by analyzing a single element in that complex of beliefs that became absorbed in"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"witches and shamans . 227the ste reo type of the sabbat: the dev il’s lameness. I cannot recapitulate here the exceedingly complex argument which led me to fi nd a common thread binding apparently very diff erent personages like Oedipus and Cinderella. But even this hasty recounting of Storia notturna must have demonstrated that history and morphology are not juxtaposed in it (as in the project, later abandoned, of a twofold version of I benandanti), but rather interwoven: two alternating voices in debate, fi nally fi nding agreement. It was a choice that refl ects that incessant inner discussion during the fi fteen years that it took me to write Storia notturna."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"229introductionI am happy to thank all the librarians who aided me in my research, in par tic u lar the staff s of the Archiginnasio in Bologna and the Charles E.

Th e passage is cited in Mario Pozzi, ed., Trattatisti del Cinquecento (Milan and Na-ples: Ricciardi, 1978), 1:503. Actually, as was observed by Jean- Louis Fournel (“Il Di-alogo della Istoria: Dall’oratore al religioso,” in Sperone Speroni, Filologia Veneta, no. 2 [1989]: 139– 167: 150– 151 [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1989]), the fi rst part of the dialogue printed by Meietti in 1596, which was based on a manuscript now lost, re-produces an earlier, quite diff erent version. (Subsequently Fournel spoke, with un-justifi ed caution in my opinion, of a probable, rather than a certain, priority: Les dia-log ue s de Spe rone Spe roni: Libe r té s de parole et règle s de l ’ écr iture (Marburg: Hitzeroth, 1990), p. 235. Th is chronology is verifi ed by the series of notes at the end of part 1 (Dialoghi, pp. 411– 412) and developed in the subsequent edition— namely, the last (Opere, 2:250ff .). Th e letters which Alvise Mocenigo wrote to Speroni between 27 August 1585 and 11 October 1587 (Opere, 5:378– 381) to bring him up- to- date on the copying of the Dialogo della Istoria concern the penultimate edition, as emerges from the passage (later suppressed) in which Pomponazzi’s old student, Speroni himself, born in 1500, is described as an “old man more than eighty- six years of age” (p. 373). Between October 1587 and 2 June 1588 (the date of his death) Speroni was strong enough to work on a new edition of part 1 of the Dialogo. Th is work, erroneously dated 1542, has been portrayed as the inspiration of the Disputatio on history written by “another of the big guns of sixteenth- century pedantry, Francesco Robortello” (G. Spini, “I trattatisti dell’arte storica,” pp. 113– 114). A little pedantry would have permitted the reconstruction of the chronology of the two works, and their relationship.48.

See, for example, Maurice Kriegel, “Un trait de psychologie sociale,” Annales, E.S.C. 31 (1976): 26– 30.5. Arnaldo Momigliano, in La contraddizione felice? Ernesto De Martino e gli altri, ed.

For a similar rejection of “history of historiography as history of po liti cal thought (pensiero storico),” see Delio Cantimori, “Storia e storiografi a in Benedetto Croce” (1966), reprinted in Cantimo-ri’s Storici e storia (Turin: Einaudi, 1971), pp. 397– 409: 407– 409. Momigliano was alluding implicitly to Hayden White and his followers, whereas Cantimori was di-recting himself to some unnamed followers of Croce, as well as, to a certain extent, to Croce himself. I have tried to explore the reasons behind this convergence in “Just One Witness” (see chap. 12).6. See B.

Strangely, no scholar has discussed the word argistinum, which, according to Severus, in the dialect of Minorca meant “small hail” (Severus, Letter on the Conversion, ed. Bradbury, p. 112: “grando minutissima, quam incolae insulae huius gentili sermone ‘argistinum vocant’ ”). To the best of my knowledge, argistinum is a hapax legomenon.16. See L.

Favoring this second hypothesis is the fact that the fi rst twelve books of the French translation of the Amadis had been reprinted between 1555 and 1560 by Vin-cent Sertenas and Estienne Groulleau, and that Sertenas himself had published Le Sueur’s Histoire admirable.

An echo of the conversat ions is caught in Ménage’s let ter ded icat ing to Jacques Dupuy the Origines de la langue françoise (Paris, 1650): “Et pour remonter jusques à la source . . . il faudroit avoir leu tous nos vieux Poëtes, tous nos vieux Romans, tous nos vieux Coustumiers, et tous nos autres vieux Escrivains, pour suivre comme à la piste et découvrir les altérations que nos mots ont souff ertes de temps en temps. Et je n’ay qu’une légère connoissance de la moindre partie de toutes ces choses.” We read this passage at the conclusion of an astounding list which includes “ l ’Hebreu et le Chaldée,” “la langue qui se parle en Basse- Bretagne, et l’Alleman avec tous ses dif-ferens dialectes,” “les diverses idiomes de nos provinces, et le langage des paysans, parmi lesquels les langues se conservent plus longuement.”11. “Fable,” we read in the Dictionnaire de l’Académie, means “an invented narrative intended to teach or entertain. . . . Fable also means the subject of an epic or dra-matic poem, or the subject of a romance . . .” (Charles Sorel, De la connoissance des bons livres, ed. Lucia Moretti [Rome: Bulzoni, 1974], p. 84n23).12. Chapelain, Opuscules, p. 219. On this and similar expressions, see the still- fundamental treatment by Nathan Edelman, Attitudes of Seventeenth- Century France toward the Middle Ages (New York: King’s Crown Press, 1946), pp. 1– 23.13.

See Chapelain, Opuscules, p. 209. On the ambiguity of the word histoire, re-sembling the Italian storia, see Furetière’s Dictionnaire: “Histoire can also refer to romances, and narratives based on invented events but not intrinsically impossible, as imagined by a writer or presented in a form not immediately recognizable” (Sorel, De la connoissance des bons livres, p. 84n23).15. Chapelain, Opuscules, p. 217.16. Th is point was misunderstood by Maurice Magendie in Le roman française au XVIIe siècle (1932) (Geneva: Slatkine Reprints, 1978), p. 131. Much more pertinent is Detienne’s polemical reaction to Finley’s statement that verisimilitude was one of the conditions imposed by the audiences of Homeric poems: “But what can it mean for an auditor to demand verisimilitude, probability? What does verisimilitude mean? Surely something other than what Aristotle meant” (Creation of Mythology, p. 142n33).17.

According to Adolfo Ernst, “On the Etymology of the Word Tobacco,” American Anthropologist 2 (1889): 133– 141, the instrument described and reproduced by Oviedo— in the guaraní language, taboca— was and still is used on the American continent to inhale not the smoke of tobacco but of plants of the leguminous family containing alkaloids. Th e hypothesis that Benzoni never took the voyages he described is discussed (and re-jected) by A. Codazzi and A. Martinengo (in the works cited at note 3).17. “Aquí me paresce que cuadra una costumbre viciosa e mala que la gente de Tracia usaba entre otros criminosos vicios suyos, segund el Abulensis escribe sobre Eusebio De los tiempos Bk. 3, chap. 168), donde dice que tienen por costum-bre todos, varones e mujeres, de comer alrededor del fuego, y que huelgan mucho de ser embriagos, o lo parescer; e que como no tienen vino, toman simientes de algunas hierbas que entre ellos hay, las cuales, echadas en las brasas, dan de sí un tal olor, que embriagan a todos los presentes, sin algo beber.

Auerbach, Mimesis, p. 402; Antoine Compagnon (Le démon de la théorie [Paris: Seuil, 1998], p. 103) states that in Mimesis “la notion de réalisme allait encore de soi.” But in the epilogue of the book Auerbach wrote: “Not even the term ‘realistic’ is unambiguous” (p. 556). On a strictly factual plane Voltaire’s description may have been fairly accurate. A ground plan of the London Stock Exchange dated “Août et septembre 1784” (École des Ponts et Chaussée, Ms. 8, Le Sage, 1784) indicates that specifi c sections were assigned to the various religious minorities (“Place des Qua-kers,” “Place des Juifs”).

I am grateful to Margaret Jacob for a reproduction of the plan.3. Auerbach, Mimesis, chap. 18, “In the Hôtel de la Mole” (on Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert).

Th irty years earlier Antonio Labriola, in a letter to Croce, had described the Croce– Gentile rela-tionship in curiously similar terms: see A. Labriola, Lettere a Benedetto Croce, 1885– 1904 (Naples: Nella sede dell ’Istituto, 1975), p. 376 (2 January 1904): “I do not under-stand why Gentile, who inveighs in hieratic style against the wicked world, does not dedicate himself to the good deed (since he has the dev il at home) of converting es-pecially you.” For Gentile’s allusion to Croce, see the following note.33. G. Gentile, “Il superamento del tempo nella storia,” in Memorie italiane e problemi della fi losofi a e della vita (Rome, 1936), p. 308: “La metafi sica storica (o stori-cismo) . . .”; the essay had appeared previously in Rendiconti della R. Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, classe di scienze morali, ser. 6, vol. 11 (1935): 752– 769. Th e words in parentheses (“that is, historicism”) were omitted in the En glish translation which had appeared a few months earlier (“Th e Transcending of Time in History”) (the editors’ preface is dated “February 1936”). Th e missing words were added pre-sumably after the publication of Croce’s essay “Antistoricismo” (an Oxford lecture of 1930, but only published later in Ultimi saggi [Bari: Laterza, 1935], pp. 246– 258). Gentile delivered his lecture at the Accademia dei Lincei on 17 November 1935 and returned the corrected proofs on 2 April 1936 (see Rendiconti, pp. 752, 769). For Croce’s reaction to the essays collected in Philosophy and History, see La storia come pensiero e come azione (1938) (Bari: Laterza, 1943), pp. 319– 327 (this section is lacking in the En glish translation by Sylvia Sprigge, History as the Story of Liberty [New York: Norton, 1941]); on p. 322 we fi nd a hostile reference to Gentile (“a murky tendency to mystifi cation . . .”). In the same volume, see also the pages on “Historiography as Liberation from History . . .” (“History,” pp. 43– 45; La storia, pp. 30– 32: “We are products of the past and live immersed in the past, which all around presses upon us. . . .” Gentile, whose idealism was much more radical and consistent, had stated that the past (and time as well) are purely abstract notions, overcome in concrete spiritual life (“Th e Transcending of Time,” pp. 95– 97). Th e importance of this essay was noted in Cesare Garboli, Scritti servili (Turin: Einaudi, 1989), p. 205.34. See G.

I do not mean to be suggesting the existence of a simple and unilinear causal connection. Undoubtedly, White’s reaction to Italian neo- idealism passed through a specifi cally American fi lter.

For always the maximum liberty agrees with the maximum of public force of the state. Which force? Distinctions in this fi eld are dear to those who do not welcome this concept of force, which is never-theless essential to the State, and hence to liberty.

Th e speech, delivered in Palermo on 31 March 1924, fi rst appeared in such journals as La Nuova Politica Liberale 2 (2 April 1924). When he reprinted it a year later, after the Matteotti crisis and its violent conclusion, Gentile, who had earned for himself the title of “the phi-los o pher of the truncheon,” inserted an embarrassed and arrogant note. In it he clarifi ed that the force for which he had intended to recognize a moral signifi cance was one alone, that belonging to the State, for which the truncheon of the Fascist squads had been the necessary instrument in a time of crisis: see Gentile, Che cosa è il fascismo, pp. 50– 51.

Oakeshott, L. Goldstein, and M. Stanford): “Th e past as the complex referent of the historical text as a whole has no role to play in historical debate. From the point of view of historical practice this referential past is epistemically a useless notion. . . . Texts are all we have and we can only compare texts with texts” (p. 281).73. Namier is thought to have said: “Toynbee, I study the individual leaves, you the tree. Th e rest of the historians study the clusters of branches, and we both think they are wrong” (quoted in Kracauer, History, p. 110). But see also the passage in Tol-stoy’s diary quoted in Isaiah Berlin, “Th e Hedgehog and the Fox,” p. 30. For a preco-cious formulation of Namier’s program to study “individual leaves” (members of the House of Commons), see his “Th e Biography of Ordinary Men” (1928), in Skyscrap-ers and Other Essays (London: Macmillan, 1931), pp. 44– 53.74.

Th e subtitles of the two books are, respectively, Carriera di un esorcista nel Piemonte del Seicento and Naissance d’un langage corporatif (Turin 17e– 18e siècles). Some of the intellectual and po liti cal implications of this research could be clarifi ed by a parallel reading of Riprendere tempo, the dialogue— it, too, published in 1982 in the series Microstorie, between Vittorio Foa and Pietro Marcenaro. Th e two are not historians, contrary to what Edward Muir states in the introduction to Microhistory and the Lost Peoples of Eu rope (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991), p. xxii n7, even though Foa, politician and trade unionist, is also the author of a book of history: La Gerusalemme rimandata: Domande di oggi agli inglesi del primo Novecento (Turin: Rosenberg & Sellier, 1985); Pietro Marcenaro, after having worked as a laborer for a time, is once again a trade unionist.79.

I presented the anomaly in these terms “. . . the voices of these peasants reach us directly, without barriers, not by way, as usually happens, of frag-mentary and indirect testimony, fi ltered through a diff erent and inevitably distort-ing mentality.” Recently, this observation was dispatched as ingenuous (Franco Nar-don, Benandanti e inquisitori nel Friuli del Seicento [Trieste: Edizioni Università di Trieste; Montereale Valcellina: Centro Studi Storici Menocchio, 1999], pp. 36, 106; see also the preface by Andrea Del Col, p. 6). But the person who quoted this sen-tence to criticize it forgot to cite what immediately followed: “Such a statement may seem paradoxical, and this leads to the specifi c interest of the research.” Between “the image underlying the interrogations of the judges and the actual testimony of the accused,” there was, I explained, a “discrepancy,” a “gap” which “permits us to reach a genuinely pop u lar stratum of beliefs which was later deformed and then ex-punged by the superimposition of the schema of the educated classes” (Th e Night Battles, p. xviii).notes to pages 218–222 . 311"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"16.
