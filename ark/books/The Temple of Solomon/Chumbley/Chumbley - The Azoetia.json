There is no simple gesture, no mere bow and sweep of the literary hand, that could suffice to beckon and lead the enquirer within the precincts of the Royal Arte. All that is truly needed to introduce the aspi-rant to this work is the innate kinship between souls, for only then will the gate to this Arbour of Sorcery swing wide, only then will the doorway into this Nocturnal Eden be found a welcome entrance. For those fellow journeymen and women with whom there is true kin-ship in the Arte, I have some personal words to impart concerning the nature of the Magical Quintessence - the ipseity of the Path Itself and the very thing which this present work is intended to transmit. My heart-advice is this:- The Quintessence of Magick is not to be found by the combination of externals, but solely by the direct realisation of its innate source. It is not to be discovered by combining system with system, belief with belief, or practice with practice; it is not found by uniting the 'elements' in their tem-porally manifest forms. For beyond the Outer, beyond the dualistic and substantive manifestations of element and element, the Quintessence is already attained. Its unity is constant as the primordial and intrinsic nature of the Sorcerous Being; its attainment is this very realisation. When this Mystery is understood, the secret of the Azoth is revealed in truth. The alchymic process of finding the Potable Gold through the dissolution and unification of all Matter shall be seen as the pagaent of the Spirit attaining self-knowledge through its own permutations of Becoming, the mystical love-play of All shall be seen with the single vision of both the Lover and the Beloved. The Quintessence is wisely to be known as the indivisible Monas of Magick Itself, the seed of primordial gnosis which is inherent to the entity of the Mage. From this ineffable one-pointedness - the unique heart of the Mage's self-unity - the arms of the elemental cross extend throughout the universe: the countless paths of system, belief and practice project and are made manifest. When the Quintessence is thus known, the secret eye of the Knower may behold its power pervading throughout the diverse and the many; the inscrutable ethos directing its myriad deviations of expression may then be recognised, wheresoever such paths may stray. Those who pos-sess this arcanum are free to wander through the numberless kingdoms of both Mind and Matter, to use the language and garb of whatever land or rime they inhabit. For when the essence is known, all substance is realised as its vehicle. By extension to the alchemies of physick and mineral, the Arcanum of the Magical Quintessence may be understood as the direct comprehension of the source which informs, supports and vitalises all elements of the v"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Manifest. Thus, by those adepts of alchymy who both dissolve and combine element within element, this heart-advice may be applied as a subtle means to behold manifest form and character as the modalities of the single power which each and every substance holds in hypostate. Furthermore, our arcanum may be articulated and understood as the spiritual key that per-mits every step and waymark upon the Path to yield up its voice, its oracles of spirit, and thus bestow the direct means of communion 'twixt the Wayfaring Mage and the Gods of Place. By reason of this understanding, it is held that We who espouse the Royal Arte, the Wise-blooded Kindred of the Elder Worship, hold true unto a single creed where-and-whensoever we may be: the so-called \"Faith beneath the Wanderer's heels\". As our Ancestor Cain, the First-born One of Arte, wanders in perpetual exile, so do we; and in our each and every unique footstep lies the fullness of Eden, pure from the beginning, constant in self-revelation: the manifest kingdom of the Magical Quintessence. To speak more directly about Azoetia itself... Since its original publica-tion in May 1992 many people have asked about its mundane history, its personal inspiration, and its location within the entire context of Magical and Initiatic Traditions. For a book such as this, a tome of the Elder Worship and of dream-whisper'd arcana, there is no simple or single straight-forward history. In its initial conception Azoetia was intended to reveal the Grand Grimoire - to make manifest the mythic formulary of the Arte Magical which all other grimoires and enchiridia appear to veil and conceal. But, in itself, this book is only another veil - although it is perchance a little closer to the adytum. And thus, the Gods willing, it is a Veil of Warding for all those of true-fated aspiration - an iconostasis of Word and Image through which the luminous ray of Initiation may shine, piercing through to enflame the well-tested heart of the Seeker. It was also intended for Azoetia to be a personal magical foundation - a first magisterial exposition encapsulating the sum of Sorcerous attainment thus far reached within the span from my birth to manhood, and as crys-talised via the apotheosis of formal initiation into the Sabbatic Path. Thus, in embodying an Initiatory Vision of the Arte Magical as newborn from the deed of the Witchblood's Passing-On, it was intended that this Grimoire should establish a comprehensive recension of the Sabbatic Craft Tradition - thus to reify the Power passed-on as Knowledge: to raise the Stang as a Book of Arte. In terms of the former aspect of intent, it is pertinent to state that in producing this new edition I have sought to maintain the integrity and youthful naivete of the original, whilst nonetheless allowing refining amendments to do greater justice to the level of insight embodied by the work in its initial conception. Furthermore, where dreams have arisen dur-ing the process of revision, their counsel has been heeded. In every instance, all such work has remained under the guidance and tutelage of the vi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Grimoire's patron spirit. In bearing its Daimon's name, this present edition permits the Reader a more direct path of insight into the Mysteries of Azoetic Sorcery. In terms of the latter intent, of establishing a recension of the Sabbatic Craft, there is a literal history that could be told, a genealogy of formal ini-tiations which could be recounted: a path of spiritual heredity revealing a lineal continuity from practitioner to practitioner, generation through gen-eration. This history can firstly be told from living memory, from the direct experience of myself and fellow initiates. Secondly, from where the living meet the dead, this history can be related through oral tradition - from the oft'-repeated accounts of former Masters and Mistresses of the Arte. Reaching beyond living memory and oral tradition, this history finally merges with mythical time - it reaches beyond - to the Unknown Hour of Witcherie: the moment of True Midnight' outside the bounds of all tem-porality. This mystical point of time is the greater source of the magical path, it is forever imminent to realisation in each fleeting second. Whilst histories and genealogies could be stated, whosoever truly seeks entry to the Way must pass over the liminal border of both Yesterday and Tomorrow. The present moment must be realised as the root of empowerment. The practices of my own particular lineages and of other such Cunning-craft Traditions change from person to person and from age to age, adapt-ing as is needed or as inspired. Deviating across generations the path is directed according to its changing custodians. Yet its power lies in its own time, in neither past nor future, but perpetually in and of the moment. In marrying what is learned and passed-on with that which arises from per-sonal inspiration, each practitioner establishes his or her own unique recen-sion. As time passes, so does the self-consciousness of the lineage: it becomes wise to its own alchymic transformations. In this present recension of the Path a Transcendental Sorcery is expounded, a means of practice whereby the humble, yet potent, techniques of spell-craft - the 'hagstone, knotted cord and witch-bottle' charms of time immemorial - are used to marry the earthly pragmatism of Need with the sidereal aspiration of the Mystic. Bearing in mind these few words of counsel and account, let the aspirant lay hold of the Quintessence that lies within him. With this unique seed of gnosis in heart, let him then receive with both hands all that is here passed on. Thus empowered with essence and prepared with substance, let now the Path be made his own! If you call upon the Gods and they answer, who is there to oppose or to challenge the integrity of your Path? Alogos Dhu'l-qarnen Khidir  Andrew D. Chumbley. Magister: Cultus Sabbati.

Yet the true text of the Azoetia is not the book you are presently holding, this is only a visible means by which the Invisible and Quintessential Grammar of Magick may be read. In a sense I am burdened with the guilt of revealing that which is held by some to be secret, and yet I am burdened with a greater guilt - that of my own inadequacy to articulate the Whole Grammar of Magick in com-municable terms. This in itself is perhaps an impossible task, since the sub-ject is more refined than the medium of its communication; the mundane linguistic being sufficient only to approximate that which by its very nature may only be subtly inferred. Much of this book is obscure, even to those familiar with the subject, and I would advise the reader to study it in the context of the whole tradi-tion of Magick and then to apply it within their own particular field; for it has been my endeavour to define those Principles underlying the many dif-ferent paths of Magick and to unify them within a single body of a work-ing grimoire. In writing this book I have drawn my inspiration from visionary dreams, which in turn have had their inspiration in my study and practise of Magick over a number of years; and thus it may be said that this Grimoire is, in itself, the reification of the initiating current which inspires the pursuit of the Magical Path - it embodies the Sacred Visions of the Arte as experienced by a traditional practitioner and thus is the Living Truth of Magick. All currents of Magick flow from a single fountain and I, in drawing this Grimoire from my Dreams, have hopefully filled a cup from a pure source. Admittedly all currents are adapted by the channel through which they pass and my work has been influenced by many traditions and authorities of occultism, but nonetheless, in articulating such Magick as I have dreamt of, I am manifesting its Indivisible Unity as best as I am presently able. This Book is a Grammar of High Sorcery; it is not to be read or inter-preted in any single and straightforward manner, but it is rather to be con-templated and seen as a many-sided jewel, refracting and reflecting the light of a solitary star. That star burns with Magick Itself; it is not to be tied down in unpoetic dissertations upon dust-laden mysteries, but it is to be seen as a source of power, to be exalted and refined through Divine Artistry. To treat this power unjustly or imprudently is to burn one's fingers, if not one's soul. It is not jokingly that I say: Man may light the flames of the Sun that will nurture him or the Hell that will consume him. Hopefully the common fool will not have sufficient patience to light this pyre. ix"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PROEM: THE SABBAT In the Ourobouros-bound Mirror of the One Dream That is the Oracle of Visions, Infernal and Divine, I have beheld Eternity's Circle-dance - call'd 'Nature' -Whose Patterns have bespoken the Sacred Myths of Man And within Immortality's Border I have danced, Hand in hand with all Worshipped of Man -With every God and Goddess revered of Our Mortality; Yea, I have known their Touch and Sight, In Conclaves of Blest Carnality.

In essence these Formulae embody a synthesis of Arcana evolved from the Primeval Cults of the Ophidian and Sabbatic Mysteries. It is taught that the Primal Goddess is to be invoked at the meeting-place of three roads. This teaching is a hieroglyph, symbolizing the meet-ing-place or junction of the three states of Awareness (sleeping, dreaming, waking), where it is said the Gateway unto the Continuity of Existence lies. This 'Continuity' is the Deity of which the Goddess is the feminine aspect. The Gateway is the state of Hypnagogia, call'd the 'Abyss of the Non-Integral'; being the passage of the Praedormitium leading directly into the oracular trance. Although Initiations into these Mysteries take place in the Outer, such acts are only symbolic of the True Initiations that occur in the trance state. It is there that the true meaning of the Rites is taught and the Way unto the Grand Sabbat or Greater Vision lies. By dreams shall ye come unto Dreams - The Azoetic Formulae are the Greater Dreams, being derived from Oneiric Visions of the Sabbatic Conclaves occurring in the hypnagogic state. By the utterance of these for-mulae at the meeting-place of the three roads the Powers of the Goddess enter into all states of the Divine Artist's Being. Thereby shall he abide in the Bliss Undying of the Goddess. Once learnt, the true meaning of these Mysteries is communicated unto the Outer under the hieroglyphic veil of the Arcanae of Initiation. Thus even in times when the true knowledge is lost, its symbols shall endure; being preserved until such time as their meaning shall be discerned. THE DREAMING T The Dreaming 'I' is a Key of Gnosis; possessing Somniscience, it is a voice to speak the Word before the birth of language; an Ever-open Eye, unre-stricted in domain and without horizons. Its Flesh, unceasing in fecunda-tion and fornication, is a fountainhead of Creation. As Achronos, it is Eternity rotating the central moment - Now. Its pleasure in all things is the Light Eternal of Ekstasis, as Vortex and Helix binding the forces of the Arte Magical. Its Beauty is Eternal Inspiration, the potential creativity of the Waking, a Well of Transformation and a Breaker of Patterns. It is Imagination realised simultaneously as Concept and Percept. Its Precept - 'A Law unto my Self - is Eternal Freedom and Will unbound, the con tinuum of Arte Incarnate."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The HAND AND THE EYE \"The Eye of the Dreaming Seer is a Secret Body of Perception dwelling at the core; a Spirit walking between the Twilights; the Watcher within the Great Double House. It is a Sensualist amidst denied pleasures hid in impenetrable tombs and treasure-vaults; an ophidian gleam in surging chaotic waters; laughter riding vast sea-winds; a glaring fire sweeping scorched white deserts; a Shadow-reveller in darkness; a blossom pouring forth evocative clouds of scent; a sealed vase of Moon-pale poison; a dag-ger dripping tinct' with chance ...the glory of uncoiling ecstasies in the rainbow-spined God of the Artist's Hand. O' Hand, that by Gesture imparteth the Word of Truth: The Letters of the Sacred Alphabet. In Thy Shadow be the Form of Our One Desire: The Sigil that is call'd \"Our God\". By Thine automatism, through Ekstasis, be the Quill guided. In Thy motion is the Secret of Creation given and the Cipher of the Mysteries hidden. In the stillness of Thine Outstretch'd Form Is the Sign of the Five-fold Star given, Within whose Angles abideth the Geometry of the Quintessence And the Gates of the Spirit. By the Forefinger rais'd unto my lips is the Lightning of Heaven stay'd, The Word made Silent and the Truth spoken, Ever in this Sign of I. The Hand and the Eye create as one the Effigies of I. The Flesh teacheth a Wisdom in Silence. Hearken ye therefore unto the embodiment of the Living Word. To write of this knowledge let the Hand have freedom in an unknown cipher, for thereby cometh the remembrance of that Path which penetrates the Ancient Forest where no Man hath trodden. Hereby cometh the Wisdom that traverseth the Starlit Void. Thus let Flesh live now its past and future states and embrace the Cyclone of the Ever-turning Inwards. THE ICONOCLASM Azoa contains Zoa - The Greater Death is in Living All as Now. In this Arcanum the Trance-state is designated the position of the Fourth Road or state of awareness. Thus the Meeting-place becomes the junction of fourRoads, giving the Symbol of the Cross X. It is at this intersection that the Spirit of Death abides, this Spirit also being the God of these Mysteries and the male aspect of the Continuity of Existence."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"At the Crossed Roads gather thyself in solitude and by certain rites per-form the Mysteries of thine own death. Here thou shalt learn of thy death unto each of the four elements, also thou shalt attain unto the pinnacle of the Arte and learn of the death of thy Spirit. Dissolve ye thine own Quintessence at the centre of the cross and there pass through the moment of all thy deaths - past and future. In the iconoclastic instant of this Arcanum the Aethyric 'I' is one with the Millions-of-Forms-of-Being, conscious of each facet emanating through the Original Desire, the Primeval Sexuality of Will. If by the grace of the God residing at the crossroads thou hast attained unto this Arcanum, then the Power of Living-All-as-Now is thine, and as such thou art free within the Continuum of thine own Being. ORISON There is a Universal Manner of Prayer that encompasses all Belief and is acceptable in all True Temples; its virtue being to invoke all Gods - such as may be summoned - and to transcend such limitations as are imposed upon the Artist by the structure of language. It is the Voice of I in con-versation with the Self-pantheon, the Millions-of-Forms-of-Being. It is the Speech uttered at the Grand Sabbat: the phonic articulation of the Sacred Alphabet. SELF ENCHANTMENT The means to rejuvenate Perception and transform the mundane senses into Oracles of Perpetual Inspiration: Let Fascination determine the Focus of Belief: the Idea, Icon, or Sigil of Devotion.

Thou shalt be One as Stars in syzygy seem to be but One Point of Light. Invoke ye thy god at the Meeting-place of the Four Roads. Thereby shall ye know of the Continuum of its Totality of Being, and thus shall ye be One with all Power that hath ever resided in thy chosen Icon. This Power thou shalt return unto the One Continuity; for every Icon is hol-low, containing the Universal Elixir: Azoth. Reclaim the Potable Gold from its mould and return it unto the Furnace.

Thus the energies of thy Faith shall be freed, as if by complete doubt thou hadst recoil'd therefrom. And thus thou shalt be released from the fetters of thine own making and be made free - to walk the Pathway anew and as shall be determined by the Will of Thy Secret Tabu. By this Arcanum the Mind is released from vain obsessions and purged of unnecessary beliefs, which by their prolonged existence have become the diseases of the body and the demons of the soul. This Arcanum shall discern for thee those Icons that are the Houses of the True Gods - the vehicles of independent and conscious entities, and with such thou shalt commune by virtue of thy devotion, oft' gaining much in Knowledge. Know also that by the application of this formula the Divine Artist may manipulate the subtle energies of Belief to create certain deliberate obsessions revolving about specific objects or fetishes, and thereby shall he create spirit-familiars and elementals to be employed in diverse aspects of Sorcery. By Self-Enchantment the Artist harnesses the Power of Will through faith, his Mind is opened through the Rites of Belief, allowing the Vision of the Aethyric T (or One Continuity) to manifest within his Flesh and thereby to be translated to the chosen medium of his Arte. Thus are the subtle energies intensified to visible form. In slaying the gods becomest I their Living Reality. CONCERNING 'CLOSED FORMULAE1 (Whereby the Natural Circle of Secrecy that bindeth this Grimoire is formed.) These are such formulae as cannot be fully explained or interpreted to the Profane or Uninitiated; and thus, to them that are without understanding, they are 'Closed'. Closed Formulae are concise word-sigils for specific nuances in the continua of Trance-Ekstasis and embody many Arcana simultaneously. They have a parallel in the Arcana of Tradition whose true meanings are passed on by Word of Mouth, but whose essence may be concealed in writing through the use of a precise symbolic language or cipher. It is the correct interpretive knowledge of the symbols employed in the cipher that will unlock the Formulae and allow access to the Corpus of Knowledge subtly inferred thereby. Through unfailing inspiration the Knowledge may be sought, yet in Truth it is something to which one is born. To those that by birth are blessed with the Sight and with many other powers of the Arte, unto such as these shall the Wisdom be disclosed, and unto them the Circle of the Elect be open. Verily as ye Dream, so shall the Concealed Words of this Grimoire shall be whispered unto Thee."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO THE SACRED INSTRUMENTS All Solitary Abodes shall serve as the Temple. Within the Forest and upon the Heath, within the Cloister and in the Cave, within the Cell and with-in the Conclave of the Skull, the Keys are passed from hand unto hand, generation to generation; and even amid the vulgarity of the Market-place the Knowledge may be declared: the True Secrets are Incommunicable! IMAGE AND METAPHOR The Sacred Room is firstly of bare white walls and bare unmarked floor. Let the Divine Artist walk therein and engulf himself in the emptiness, allegorical yet identical to the Void wherein the One Dream is witnessed. Then shall the walls be hung in cloth of the deepest indigo - this is the Void made fertile, the Womb and the Burial-ground. By virtue of the Visions arising from meditation within the room, the Artist shall paint upon the floor the Signs of his Devotion. These shall be the Circle and the Rune, the Vever and the Yantra, the manifold Signs of Tradition made articulate according to the Secret Alphabet of the Divine Artist. Following the Path of Self-Enchantment the Man of Arte will erect shrines and altars upon which to cluster the idols of the Great Fetishism -the bones of past and future incarnation, the tools of the Arte and the tokens of the Sabbat. Lost in the ravishment of Sorcery he may perchance give Flesh unto That of which we may not speak. A Depiction of the Author's Altar: At the centre of the High Altar is an oval mirror, around its frame are hung emblems of growth: the gnarled talon of a root, a small bough, and three ears of com. Above the mirror is an array of branches ornate with the feathers of the Peacock and the skin of the Snake. At either side of the mirror is a brass candlestick; the candles are white upon the left and black upon the right. In front of the mirror is a wooden box, symbolic of the magical bed and containing the fetishes of dreams. Upon the box rest the Books of Arte, and set there-on is the Skull of Man: an urn of ancestry and a dwelling-place for the Soul of the Unknown Initiator. Behind the mirror is a concealed lamp with tallow candle, and arrayed thereabouts are the Crooked Wand, the Eucharist Cup, the Star-metall'd Arthame and the Copper-graven Pentacle. Gathered about all, high and low, are divers Images in wood, metal and pictorial form; these are the Dwellings of the Host, the Houses of the Saints and the Faithful Companie, the Abodes of the Spirits and Good Magistelli. 15"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Standing before the High Altar is an old inherited table of circular dimension, upon which is graven the Sign of the Eight-pointed Sabbatic Star. At each point of the Star specific images, fetishes and objects are placed, their positions determining the direction of the Ingress of the Magical Powers; the Whole acting as a Fetish-Sigil of the Greater Magical Circle of the Sabbat. Thus saith the Daimon: The Divine Artist must listen and obey the tabu dictated by the Ancestral and Totem Familiars, he must learn the Way of preparing the Sacred Instruments. Failure to observe their secret laws is the proof of unworthiness to walk upon the Path of the Arte Magical. The Fetish-Tree In the centre of Thy Place of Working erect ye the Earth's Phallus, a Tree or Pole of Wood, upon which Thou Mays hang the Repositories of the Spirits and the Fetishes of Thy Sorcery. The wood used for the Pole, or the Tree of the Forest chosen, shall be ordained by Thy Familiar or Patron Spirit. Carve upon it the Signs and Sigils of Thy Totemic Beasts, and hang upon it their bones, teeth, claws and feathers, and also conspicuous stones and the diverse masks of ritual. The Fetish-Tree is the Axis of the Existent, a centre of the Sacred Dance. It is the World-pillar ascended and descended by the Sorcerer in the Grand Dreaming; its ornamentation must reflect the practitioner's understanding of this Mystery and serve to propitiate those who guard the Paths 'twixt Height and Depth, 'twixt Horizon and Centre. The Wand The Wand is the Sceptre of Divine Authority. It is the fiery bough torn from the Lightning-struck Tree; the Serpent innocently grasped. By Tradition the True Wand is transmitted unto Thee by Thine Initiator; it is given unto Thee at such Time when thou art worthy to wield it with Knowledge. Unto the Self-initiate the Wand is given by the Laws of Tabu, and its uses and means of preparation are revealed by the Virtuous Powers of the Famulus. There are two principle types of the Wand: the Crooked and the Straight, the Concealed and the Revealed:-The Crooked Wand should be cut at noon with a single stroke of the Working Knife, and upon such a day as is auspicious unto the Man of Arte. A suitable wood is that of the Crooked Willow (Salix Tortuosa). Its bark may be removed by hand, leaving a smooth white undulating branch. Thus, being naturally serpentine in its form, it is the fetish of the ophidian energies of Our Arte. Upon the scales of the Serpent the Letters 16"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of the Sacred Alphabet are written, and thus upon the Crooked Wand the Sigils of Thy Rites should be engraved and burned. Like the Tongue of the Serpent this Wand is forked; and at the Meeting-place of the Twain the Sign of an Ever-open Eye is burnt. Through such devotions the Ophidian Soul is propitiated and is bound unto Thy Self. By the Concealed Wand, made in the Serpent's Image, the Divine Artist directs the Powers of the Alogos - the Unwritten Gnosis and the Secret Will of the I. The Straight Wand is traditionally the Instrument of Revealing and Initiation. It is the means whereby the Divine Artist directs and manipu-lates the energies of the Logos - the Revealed Forms of the Gnosis and the Incarnating Will of the I. The wood and other materials used in its con-struction are those dictated by the Famulus in accordance with the Principles of the Sacred Aesthesis. A Wand to be used for a specific rite and for invoking a specific current of power should be made from the cor-responding materials of that power. The Divine Artist may thus require several forms of the Revealing Wand in order to work specifically and pre-cisely with the many streams of the Azoth. The Arthame or Sacred Knife This is the Tradition :-After the Days of Pre-Creation, when the Initiator dreamt alone in the Aethyrs, the Spirit awoke to the task of making Man. From the Clay of its own Flesh and the Dews thereof it moulded the Image and with a Knife wrought of Stone, the Holy Arthana, it made the Openings of the Body. And from the Lips of the Ancient One the Fire of the Spirit went forth into the Point of every Star, and into the Souls that were the bless'd and the Wise the Fire went forth - even into the Souls bound by the Covenant of the Blood of Wisdom went the Secret Fire of the Ancient One. For these Spirits shall pass from Form to Form, forever hound in the Circle of the Sabbat by the Oath of their Witchblood. This is the Spell :-By the Rais'd Sickle of the Moon I reap the Blood of the Night, Star-ridden and scarlet-stained, this is the Spell of the Holy Arthame. By Thee, the Letter of Blood, I mark the Paths of the Azoetic Sorcery. By the Powers of Will, Desire and Belief, At One with Thy Signs wrought in the aethyr, I direct the Quintessence from Icon to Icon. I mark the Ways of mine own Enchantment. By Thee I direct the Azoth within the Arcana of I. 17"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Cut ye the Fetters of the Flesh.   ;   Release the Hearts of the Profane in sacrifice. Release the Hearts of the Wise in devotion. Rend ye the Veils of Matter and the Boundaries of Form. Make clear the Gates and the Pathways wherein the Spirit shall walk. Receive ye the Harvest of the Stars; Draw down the Light of Sun and Moon. Receive ye the Harvest of the Void; draw down the Darkness and raise ye up the Abyss of the Night. And in the Circle of the Earthly Sabbat all Powers bind. To Cast, to Call, to Banish - such is the Will of the Holy Arthame, call'd the Knife of the Black Hilt. By Thy Most Ancient Forms of Stone and Wood the Rites of Earth exact; the Earthly Sabbat's Circle cast -the Word of all Telluric Powers pronounce. By Thy Form of Metal front the Stars fallen, the Rites of the Stellar Powers exact: the Empyrean Circle cast. By Thy Forms of the Seven Earthly Metals forged, the Seven Rays bind into One. By the Dagger of Exorcism, forged from the Reddened Bones of the Ancient One, and in whom all Seven meet, the Infernal Sabbat's Rites exact; its Circle of Shadow cast. Such is the Spell of the Holy Arthame. The words of Tradition continue thus: Those solely of the Clay, knowing not the Arcana of I, are the Feast of all Nature. From the dust are They arisen and to the dust returning. They know not of the Sodality of Our One Sacred Flesh - the Body blest by the Fire of the Ancient One of Spirit, and thus are They Profane unto the Circle of Our Arte. Thus are They given in sacrifice unto That which gave them Substance. 18"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Working Knife Call'd the Knife of the White Hilt, it is used in preparing the Tools and other requisites of the Arte Magical. Its blade is engraved with the Sigils of Thine own Sorcery and Thy native tradition of Magick. This is the Spell: Fetish-Maker! Knife of the White Hilt, I charge Thee and with mine own blood enliven Thee. Thy Way by the Spirit be guided - upon wood, bone and horn the Familiars' Forms to bind. The Fetish-Maker's Charm upon Thee! Upon all Substance let Thy Spirit place the Sigils of I - as the Quill so Thy Blade. The Fetish-Maker's Charm upon Thee! The Cup As uttered by the Initiator, this is the Spell for the Knowing of the Cup: From the Great Chalice I pour this Libation for Thee, the Primal Azot, Potent and Fertile! The Sea that holdeth the Stars in the Heights and the Stars in the Depths, that in Time bore the Egg and broke forth in a Flood -the Waters that cleanse, the Milk that nurtures, the Sweat that cools, the Tears that succour, and the Blood that sustains; as the Wine from this Cup unto Thy Lips, so my Kiss; so my blessing shall the Secrets bestow. The Pentacle The Pentacle is a microcosmic representation of the Divine Artist's Work, and symbolically it must encompass all of the elements therein. It is tradi-tionally a disc of clay, wax or metal engraved with the Pentalphic Star, representing equilibrium between the elements of Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Spirit. The Star is enclosed within a graven circle, symbolizing the Horizon, and there-abouts are inscribed the diverse Sigils of the Sacred Alphabet to form the Wheel of the Self-pantheon about the Point of I. It is by the Fetish of the Pentacle that the Manifestation of Spirit in Matter is symbolized. The Quill The Sorcerer draws Power from his Death - Now! His Hand reaches beyond the confines of the Living and beckons the Seraph of Thanatos through the Gate of the Circle's centre. And from Death's Angel's Wing he plucks a single feather - for this is the Sacred Quill, dipped in the blood of his own heart, and where-with he shall com-mit the Signs of his Magistry unto the Grand Grimoire Azot."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Such is its Spell:-O1 Feather pluck'd from Mortal Bird, be Thou as a Feather from the Peacock-Angel's Wing, as a Feather from the Wing of the Seraph of Thane, as a Feather from the Very Sphinx's Flume of Truth.

Be Thou as the Quill held by the One Initiator, by whose Wisdom the Cipher of Our Arte wast wrought and given forth unto the Wise amongst Man. 0' Feather pluck'd from Mortal Bird, Slain in sacrifice to this Ancient Mystery, be Thou blest with the Ink that is the Very Blood of Witchdom -and be Thou thus empowered with Our Living Word ofMagick. 0' Quill of the Elder Gods, held in the Hand of Man, bear Thou the Invisible unto the witness of the Eye; bear Thou Alogos unto Logos. So mote it be! The Cord As uttered by the Initiator, this is the Spell for the Knowing of the Cord: By the bloodied thread Thou art bound and blessed. By the Garter of fine cloth, furs and skin a certain wealth betwixt Thee and me is known, and by the Ladder of Knots Thou shalt traverse the Spaces Between. These Three are One Cord of Initiation. The Fetish That which possesses a self-evident holiness, consecrated by fascination: such is the Fetish, an object exempt from temporal morality through the power of curiosity. Possessed of Arte's own sexuality, the ineffable beauty of fascination's seduction, each fetish is the reposoire of a specific power or spirit and must be treated with due reverence. By dreams, omens and intuition its laws, called Tabu, are established and must be observed with care. Stones with holes worn through by water, beads, bones, feathers, shells, wood resembling creature, certain bottles and sigil-scribed vases, idols and images emanant of spirit - such as these arc potent delights to Hand, Eye and Soul."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Magical Bed These are the Words for its Knowing: The Bed of Thy Marriage to these Mysteries shall be furnished to Thy satiety, yet some will make it of thorns and gorse - such is their comfort. The feathers of the Serpent, Garuda and Simurgh, the Ibis and the Hawk, the Phoenix and the Swan, and of every bird that hath flight -these shall fill the mattress and these shall be the feathers of Thine own wings. The Sheets are woven from the silk of the Moth and they shall be dyed with the colours peculiar to Thy rites. As it is revealed, so let it be done. Verily, beneath Thy place of sleeping a hollow chamber should lie. Within this space directly below the dreaming flesh the Fetishes are to be placed, together with amulets and Sigils of sig-nilicance to the matter that is to be dreamt of. Partitions may also be placed within the chamber to create specific angles whereby certain dreams shall be invoked. As thou dost sleep the spirits residing within the chamber shall stir and wake, they shall enter Thee and change Thee into the forms of the totem ic animals. Thus Thou shalt tread the Pathways of the Primordial Land and go forth in the Host by Night. Furthermore, upon the Altar within the Sacred Room place a box sym-bolic of the Magical Bed, and resting upon this there should be some image of Thy Self. Within this box the Double-dream is formed; this being the Dream where awareness resides in two or more bodies simultaneous-ly. This will occur naturally, and undue deliberation will only cause a restraint. The Altar The Altar is the Table of the Feast shared by Gods and Men. It must be of sufficient size to bear the Tools of the Arte and should also be hollow, thus to contain the Secret Effigy of the Devotion and for the practical purpose of storing items when not in use. Traditionally, the Altar is in the form of the Double Cubic stone or Double Ashlar, thus to serve as the Foundation-stone of the Unseen Temple. The Sigil: The Linear Articulation of Intent The Sigil originates through the natural function of the Desire; the Will already achieved, arising in self-fruition, it is a Living Cryptogram of That which-shall-Be: an Illumined Patterning in the Mage-beheld Design of Possibilities. It is a Gesture of Power at one with the Dance of all Living; its motion is the Line and Arc that fascinates Sense. Its Shape and 21"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Form are imaged-forth from the Pure Icons of the Azoth, thus to make manifest the Essence of Becoming - to direct the power toward incarna-tion, to satisfy the true nature of the Wish. Sated at the Pleasure-feast of Believing, its form accretes all-potency of Meaning, hence its Structure suggests its own propulsion and thus accelerates necessary fulfilment: the sacrifice for self-attainment. Such is the Sigil, in nature, form and function. Know then the Sigil in spirit and in its Path of Actuation, for the Sigil is the Very Entity of Desire, created through concentration of Belief and obsession of the Will. It accepts all energies for its own growth, desiring only its own satisfaction and thus Death. An Exemplar of Method: By the Sensations of Pleasure beatified and intensified in the Flesh a pyre of reverie and contemplation is lit, a furnace of fervour upon fervour. At each height of Pleasure bring the Sigil to the fore of consciousness and at the supreme height of ecstasy prior to exhaus-tion focus the attention of all senses upon it. Falling in exhaustion the Sigil is forgotten, yet a tide of released energy wells up from within the Body. Upon this flood are borne the Powers of Ancestry and perchance some glimmer of the Greater Vision. All is done: the death of the Sigil in the instant of the orgasm, the Aeon of Ekstasis, the Unification of Love and Death resulting in the embodi-ment of the Desire and the Resurgence of Spirit. Such are the Words for the Sigil's Knowing: Eight are the Ways that lead unto the Holy Alphabet of Sorcery, to the Cipher whose Letters are the Points of Universal Transmutation: the Shrines of the Immortal Powers of the Arte Magical. Eight are the Paths that seek to reveal its Purity of Form. Each Path reveals an aspect of the Sacred Knowledge, No single path reveals the Whole. Walk ye the Paths of the Sabbat's Cross - move not from its Centre. In the Letters of the Holy Alphabet the Way of the Dance is hidden. Enshrined therein are the Postures of the Gods and the Rhythms of Power. By Tradition they are Twenty-two in Number; reducible to One, yet infinite in variation and subtlety of Form and Meaning.

It is easier to touch the Sun! 22"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Circle Concerning the Circle I give the Rune employed when first tracing its Sign upon Thy Chosen Site of Working :-Circle of the Full Moon, Circle of the Sun at Noon, Circle of the Earth's Horizon, Circle of the Seven Stars, Protect ye all that shall work herein, Hind all Power here raised and summoned. Bridge Thou the Worlds of Gods and Men, and be Thou sealed: the Sigil of the Round Dance, the Wheel of High Sabbat. SUMMATION: THE PROCLAMATION OF THE LIVING TEMPLE The Instruments of the Arte Magical are channels for the energies of the Aethyric I and act as fetishistic catalysts for the reification thereof. Their symbolism is derived from the Totemic Forms assumed by the Divine Artist and from his Vision of Nature as a whole. Their methods of Use and Construction are entirely dependant upon his innate creativity and resources. It is by the Sacred Instruments that the Man of Arte binds and focuses his Will, not to chain or fetter that power, but to concentrate and strengthen it. (Their necessity is a matter of personal predilection; sigils will achieve results of equal quality, and to some the Body is a sufficient vessel. It is wisest to employ such methods as will allow the practitioner to interact with magical energies in a precise yet intuitive manner.) I go forth in mine own Chosen Body, the Temple of all Gods. Crown'd am I with the Stellar Fire entwined about the Horns of the Ancient One. There is no part of me that is not I.

Prior to the moment of Egress the Sorcerer should make petition unto these Spirits, offering himself thereto as a Sacrifice. For it is said that the Ancestral Shades will flock unto such an Offering that they may per-chance regain some small spark of Light and Life, and if such Spirits be of Sorcerers Past then it is to partake of Magical Power that they draw nigh unto such a Sacrifice, thereby arousing their own dormant powers and knowledge. Also Spirits of Bestial and Elemental Form shall gather, that they may taste of the Shade of a Living Man; this being advantageous to their own evolution. The Sacrifice of the Shadow is not simply a Veneration of the Ancestral and Totem Manes, it is an Initiation and a Rite of Transformation.

Within the Clay Urn the Sorcerer shall conjure the Powers and Entities of the Universe as he so will, and these, dwelling within his own micro-cosmic creation, are thus necessarily his Servitors.

The Novitiate are Those in whom the Seed of Witchblood is awakening, dwelling at the Circle's border and desirous of entry therein. Once invit-ed to approach the Threshold, they must petition the Powers of the God and the Goddess - as Spiritual Powers or as enshrined in the Bodies of Priest and Priestess. When called upon to speak, they must ask to receive the Ancient Blessing and show that they are worthy thereof through the example of their devotion. Those who ask for entry without invitation will meet only with denial.

Standing within the Circle of the Wise, their Task, both Priest and Priestess, is to walk upon the Mystical Point of the Circle's Heart, and thus seek to embody the Ancient One of Spirit, the Goddess and the God. This they must accomplish according to the Path of their Predilection, yet ever according to the Sacred Principles of the Sabbatic Craft. The King or Queen of the Sabbat is One who, having walked upon the Mystical Centre of the Circle, has received the True Names and Signs of the Goddess and the God, even that of the Ancient One of Spirit.

Let it be cleansed in the Waters of the Earth and be made subject unto all such worthy disciplines as will strengthen the Flesh unto the Sacred Purpose. THE SECOND ACT: Let the Body of the Mind be made still. As a finely-ploughed field awaiting the seed, so let the Mind be. As silt settling with-in water, so let all Thought fall unto the Silent Continuity of Awareness and the Mind attain unto the Clarity of the Divine Contemplative."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE THIRD ACT: Let the Body of the Soul be made pure in its devotion through the taking of an Oath, binding one unto the Sacred Purpose of the Great Work. Let the worthiness of the Soul be shown through the accom-plishment of preparatory tasks of devotion - in prayer and in orison, in votive acts of sacrifice and offering. By the First Three Acts prepare Thyself in self-controlled and chaste devotion. Be diligent unto all Purity and Discipline. For by the Degree of Thy Preparation shall be measured the Degree of Thy Success in the ful-filment of these Mysteries. THE FOURTH ACT: With Flesh aligned unto the Sacred Postures of the Gods; with Mind intent within the One Continuity of Awareness, focused through the Enchantments of Will, Desire and Belief; and with Soul - in Shadow as in Light - ensorcelled within the Arcanum, let the Initiate pass within the Sacred Precincts of Solitude. Let him enter in through the Secret Gates of the Temple and be admitted unto the Circle of the Covine and Curren. Upon entry into the Circle the Initiate shall give further signs of his devo-tion and his kinship unto the Covine, he shall also render such honour as is due unto his Superiors. If it is required of him he shall also render an account of his Work since the last meeting of the Covine. Then let the Initiate proceed to perform the Rite of Ingress, together with such Spells and Formulae of the Eleven Cells as is pertinent unto his Work, or as taught unto him secretly in Dreaming. Thus, by the Complex of the Ritual, the Initiate binds the Sacred Pattern of the Sabbatic Rite unto the Earth and the Flesh. Through the Rite Dramatical the Sabbat of Myth and Dream is made manifest. THE FIFTH ACT: In the Fifth Act the Initiate receives instruction and tuition from his Superiors within the Cult. He must pass through such tasks and ordeals as he is directed - whether those tasks be dictated by his embodied guides - a King or Queen of the Circle - or by those Discarnate of Our Number who have their Abode in the Secret Conclaves, whence they inform the Mundane Vessels of the Cultus. The Fifth Act may thus be an act of direct word-of-mouth instruction, a task of initiation given unto the Initiate by a Superior Adept, or it may be a Passive Act of Contemplation or absorption in O'ershadowed Trance in which the Initiate is receptive unto the guidance of those Gods, Spirits and Ancestors summoned in the Fourth Act. The Fifth Act culminates in the whole assembly of the Covine uniting in the common task of the Sacred Dance (all save He who directs the Chant and the Pace thereof). This is the active method of causing the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Initiated Body to be receptive unto the Informing Current and Daimons of the Rite. The Dance is a divertive act whereby the Initiate concentrates upon following the instructions of the Summoner directing the Chant, Pace and Postures of the Dance. The Initiate thus absorbed in this act is opened unto those Powers of which the Sacred Postures are a Corporeal Point of Mediation. The Dance also serves as an exhaustive act whereby the mundane consciousness of the Initiate is released from its limitations, also as a stimulative act invigorating and exciting the Flesh through rapid movement. The tasks and ordeals of the Fifth Act being completed and the Body of Initiates being suitably aroused and entranced in the Dance, the Summoner will call for the Dance to cease and for all to be seated for the Sixth Act to begin. THE SIXTH ACT: Called \"The Feast of the Senses'; this traditionally is the Partaking of Food and Wine as Repast, accompanied by burning of sweet offerings and the giving of sustenance unto the Gods and Ancestors. The Arcane Formula of the Sixth Act is a Feast upon the Sacraments of Blasphemy; it is to dine upon the Flesh of Innocents and to sup the Blood of the Sacrifice. It is the Feast of Poisons whereby the Initiate attains unto a super-sensual capacity of Desire through the over-stimulation of the senses. During the Sixth Act no word is to spoken unless permitted by the Leader of the Circle. No sexual act or embrace is permitted until the Sign is given by the King and Queen of the Circle for the Seventh Stage of the Rite to commence. THE SEVENTH ACT: The penultimate stage of the Rite is the perform-ance of the Formulae and Mysteries of Congress. All Initiates shall con-join in the Agapae; the stronger and most learned guiding the weaker and the inexperienced brethren in the Sacramental Acts of Sexuality. These Acts are form'd by the Four Main Gestures or Methods of Congress and their Permutations, also by such Formulae of the Sexual Genii, of Incubi and Succubi, as pleaseth the Covine. This is the Feast of Pleasure, wherein all Flesh is purged of eveiy mun-dane and temporal desire in an orgiastic super-physicality. Thus in exhaus-tive satiation the Initiate is made an Open Vessel for Primal Desires to bear their Dream unto the Flesh of Manifest Reality. The weaker members who fall to exhausted slumber are still employed as Vessels by the stronger members, each being goaded and ridden by secret means until the Sleeper is aroused unto wakefulness. Tirelessly the Adepts will eventually guide all of their lesser brethren into the Death-like Sleep at the Cross'd Ways of the Sabbat, wherein they may witness and partake of the Mysteries within the Conclaves of Empyrean and Infernal Abodes.

Upon waking they must return unto the First Act unless by their Arte they are able to manifest that of which they have dreamt. The Adepts who likewise fall into the Sleep of Thanatos must be res-urrected unto wakefulness by the Artfulness of their fellow Brethren. Such Adepts, together with those whom are possessed of True Mastery and fall not to the abyss of the darkest slumber, shall perform the Rite of Egress and thus call upon the Power of their Death whilst living. The Adepts shall then proceed into the Contemplative Death or return unto the First Act and so revolve the Sabbat's Wheel until the Pure Contemplative State is achieved. Rising from the Sleep of Thanatos and having gained masteiy of its secrets, the Adept has embodied - made Flesh - the Immortal Wisdom of the Witches' Sabbat; he has become the Incarnate Vessel of the True Cultus of the Arte Magical. ADDENDA: The exact procedure of each Sabbat and the precise nature of each stage is to be directed and controlled by the Hand of the Circle's Leader: the Black Man of the Sabbat or the Most Wise Priestess of the Circle. It is of utmost importance that their Word is obeyed, for the True Sovereigns of the Circle have by their magistry attained unto the Knowledge of the Veil'd Sigils of Arte and have thus forged a direct link with the Primal Initiating Intelligences of the Cult.

OF THE UNWRITTEN The Unwritten is the Greater Part of this Book, which is but a Veil and an Icon of the One True Grimoire of the Arte Magical which lieth yet in the Shadow. By mine Arte I have sought to imply and convey that which can-not yet be written of or readily committed unto the profane medium of paper, but may through the mysterious yet precise use of Ciphers be revealed unto the Wise and the Initiated. Let each seek for themselves; learning, perfecting and adding unto such as I have offered, each accord-ing to the needs of their own Great Work. 82"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"A FORMULA OF ORISON: THE MOUTH AS THE VESSEL OF THE VOID All Speech is an Echo of the Unheard; from the One Sound proceedeth All. Of that which is Unheard and is as Silence:- It is the core of Ekstasis, remote yet omnipresent. It is That which is I, contracted to the Point of All-Potentiality via the Seed-Phoneme of the Sacred Alphabet: A. Formulated internally, it is the One Sound of All; externally it is Silence: the Word Alogos. Of that which is Heard, that which proceedeth from the One Sound:- It is That which is I, expanded to the periphery of Possibility. Thus is it for-mulated internally as Silence, and externally - via the Eleven Aats (the Eleven Portals of the Word) - as the complex permutations of phonemes. Verily, it is the Continua of the Logos, the Perfected Utterance of the Sacred Alphabet. The Synentasy of I, expanded and contracted infinitely, existeth exterior to Temporality: Achronos. The Divine Artist subsisting in this contemplation, appearing external-ly as One lying in Death, yet internally sensing Entity beyond Time, is the Oracle of those existing 'behind' the Aeonic Foci or Aats, the Vessel of the Life-that-is-Not. The Pictorial 'Utterances' of the Oracle are to be perceived in Silence, without conception; (see Formula of Aesthesis II) they are not subject to the aesthetic analyses of Culture, being Icons of Achronistic Reality and as such are exempt from attitudes arising from temporal consciousness. The energies informing the Oracle, although invoked as Deities, are not to be limited by personification as such, but focus'd thereby for the purpose of their reification. By their nature such Powers are Inconceivable and Unknowable, and are only translated through the Divine Artist via the automatic expression that is the Self-Possessing Volition of a Perfect'd Magical Will. For the Will encompasses both the Form and the Formlessness of Gods and Men alike."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE FORMULAE OF THE HAND AS THE VESSEL OF THE VOID (Being the Method of Sorceiy whereby the Hand is possessed or 'ridden' by those dwelling beyond the Eleven Aats and by all manner of diverse spirits propitious unto the Arte Magical; thus to be practised as a Means to Automatic Art.) Hold Thy Favoured Hand of Drawing rigid and still, bound by the Fetters of Will in a Posture denoting the Sigil of the Spirit that is to be summoned, and upon the back of Thy Hand mark this Sigil in Ink, Water or Blood consecrated to Thy purpose, together with such sigils as will bind the Spirit to Thy Will and to the Work undertaken. The Hand becometh the Adamantine Vessel of the Void, a Silhouette -a Womb containing the gestating seed-sigil, a Shadow of Luminous Darkness that bindeth the Spirit. The Hand becometh these things as it ceaseth to be known unto Thine own senses; as feeling waneth in the Hand of the Artist, so waxeth the Presence of the Invoked. When the Hand dwelleth solely in the Void, when its Life is given unto . another, then release it from the fixed posture. In Thy Mind hold fast to the Contemplation of the Void, that Thine own Thought blemish not the Work\" to be undertaken, but that Thy Will may hold firm the rein of pur-pose over the Invoked at its place of Ingress, that is, the Seed-Sigil within the Creative Void.

I, by the Hand as the Vessel of all Sorcery, by the Silent and Telaesthetic Pathway, discover the Secret Image of the Initiator and reveal the Inconceivable Word: Alogos. Thus give I Reality unto the Dream as Flesh Embodied and as an Image Pictorial. The Formula should be applied in the following ways:-1. The Hand as the Vessel wherein all sensations are concentrated:- This is used as the Synaesthetic Formula to articulate the complete sensation of a Rite, that is, to speak the Pentagrammaton of the Flesh as it is reified within the Working. This is the Positive Synaesthetic Application of the Formula of the Hand as the Vessel of the Invoked. 2. The Hand as the Vessel wherein the Void is focus'd:- The Hand is marked with the Triangle of Evocation containing the appropriate Signs of Calling. Thence, by the Formula of Possession, it is used to automati-cally reify the Matrices of Entity from within and beyond the Eleven Aats. This is the Negative Synaesthetic Formula of the Hand as the Vessel of the Invoked. 85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"3. For the Binding of Elementals: In this application the Hand should be tied with the Knotted Curd and the analogous fetishes of the Spirit Invoked. 4.

This is most powerful and reifies the Invoked via the Congressus and Sigillick Formulae of Zsin-Niaq-Sa. BETWEEN ALL BLESSED AND WISE OF THE SECRET CULT OF THE HIGH SABBATIC ARCANA THERE IS A HIDDEN COMMUNION... In the Primordium of Thought, so in the Ocean of Our Blood, there is a Unity of Language, of Speech and of Script: the Alphabet of the Wise. It springs forth from the primal atavistic impulse of I: the Spirit that per-vades all Nature, call'd 'Magick'. Its Vision originates in, and perpetually returns to, the comprehension of Existence as a Whole. It is born of the common embrace of Life and Death by the Pure of Heart and Eye. The Sacred Alphabet in its myriad forms exhibits the reoccurrence of essential glyphs embodying the synentasy of Conception and Perception as focus'd in (he All-Psyche. There is a concurrence of physical sense-impres-sions and primal psychical forces throughout all Entity. By the Pentagrammaton of the Senses, encoded by the Ancient Lores of the Immortal Psyche, the Sacred Alphabet evolves. The subtle foci of the All-Psyche are the Emanating Stars anterior to the Letters of the Holy Script; they are the tonal centres of Sacred Speech. The Rays of each Star make manifest the inter-relationship and develop-ment of each Letter's Forms and Powers. The Eleven Aatic Stars and the Twenty-two Letters of the Sacred Alphabet are the Abstracts of the Highest Magical Powers, being formless in essence, yet by this Sorcery are here given shape. Thus are the cognitive (Numerical and Linguistic) absolutes of the All-Sentience or Sum-Awareness of the Aethyric I encoded, and here embodied in Unity as the Grand Sigil called the 'Sigillum Azoetia'. 1. Over each Aat, or Cell, there is a unifying glyph, a Grand Sigil where-by it is opened and closed as a Point of Ingress. The Eleven Higher Aatic Glyphs are the Keys that the Divine Artist must discover, for without them there is no progress upon this Path. 2. Each Aat hath especial sovereignty over a specific pair of Sacred Letters. These Twin Aatic Glyphs are the polarities of such Powers as are emanat-ed and absorbed by that Cell in particular, and thus they define the nature 86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"characteristics of the Aat as a Geminus. An Aatic Current may therefore and he called upon as the Twin Continua of Zoa and Azoa - as Goddess and God. 3. Each Letter hath an especial duality of energies in each Aat - Sinistral and Dextral or Negative and Positive, as it pleaseth Thee to call them. Thus the Powers of the Sacred Alphabet are refined through their perfect-ed co-relation, and the subtleties of each Letter are made precise. For unto each Letter there is a secret conjunction of the senses corresponding directly with an aspect of the Primal Atavism, and from this is revealed an alignment of specific arcana and cognate formulae. Beware! The Forms of the Letters as they are given herein are such as I have employed in mine own Arte. By Thine own Cunning espy their Secrets; for I may not say if they be similar for All. Thus saith the Daimon: Within the One Sacred Letter the Twenty-Two Letters of the Complete Cipher are focus'd and specialized according to the Twenty-two Subtleties of that Letter's Arcana. From each Letter of the Sorcerer's Alphabet there unfolds a libidinous gri-moire of Primal Magick. At the Sabbatic Convocation we read their Ancient Lore:-In omnifarious sexuality all Entity, incarnate and discarnate, be con-joint in Sacred Fornication - that no Nature be unfulfill'd - that the Silence of Our Forgotten Desires be spoken as Flesh! For as Primal Spirits dreamt shall here become the Living Truth of the Day... so there is no ces-sation of Our Ekstasis at the High Sabbat; no end to the Rite of Bliss that is Aethyric and is in the Aires perform'd! Even in the Mundane Rites of the Earth shall there be some release. For all Powers that are entrapped and snared in the vulgarity of Common Living shall be here unbound; all care be cast unto the Love of Goddess and God. In Our Secret Rites there is a reificatoiy enactment: a Will to the Realisation of Our Most Ancient Desires. Such Desires, in accumulating Power and Form throughout the Aeons, have become as Gods. Verily these Roots of Power are the Old Ones of Star and Earth! Their obliqui-ty to a conscious interpretation of their meaning is in ratio to their antiq-uity: the heights of Power are hidden in the depths of Mystery. By containing Mystery in Ritual we intensify its Power. Concentrating its silent and hidden meanings in the Circle of the Magical Act at the aus-picious turnings of Season and Star, we thus emphasize the Vital Influences of the Arcane. By Rite and Charm we propitiate the Ancestral Gods: Our Most Ancient Desires. Thus do we feed the Spirit of Our 87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Primal Atavism, that we may never hunger beyond its momentum of evo-lution, that we may ever increase our own momentum towards the I con-cealed in the Arcanum. Thus by Our Rites we are free to walk in mortal pursuits assured of Our Immortal Fate. Yet unto the Divine Artist all tem-poral concern is towards the immortal direction: all suffering will be incurred rather than a diversion from the Sacred Path. All Time, by each Self occupied, is unto the Instant slain: a Sacrifice unto the Moment of Ingress, the Point when the Power of the Rite Invoked doth enter the Ring of Carnality. Let all Time unto I-Achronos be focused! Achronos, as the Eternity of the I's Self-cycle of Transformation, be similarly focused to the Central Point of the Earthly Circle-Dance. Thus let the Phantasmorgoric Splendour of the High Sabbat of the Ages be drawn down as Starlight into the Adept's Body by the Celebration of the Earthly Sabbatic and Esbatic Mysteries. For Wight and Blood's bonding in the divine perichoresis 'twixt High and Low Sabbat - so shall this be! STRUCTURE: COMPONENTS AND ASPECTS OF FORMULAE 0. Silence: the Absolute, the Source that preceedeth All. In the Stance of the Quintessential Magical Power the Sorcerer abides, the Wordless Word inchoate in pure intent. 1. 'I' is the First Utterance: the Root-manifestion of the Absolute. It is to be spoken in the tone appropriate to the Working. It may be shouted as a ciy of war, called out as to someone distant, soothing or biting, harsh, lov-ing, or laughing. In its Purity it is the root-phoneme of the Sacred Alphabet. In reboant extension it delineates the straight line of Intent, opening the Way and marking the direction of the Path. As the Vagitus of Self-existentiation it leaps forth from Silence, illuminating a specific apoth-eosis, a focal point in the Continuum of Ekstasis. Thus the One Sound goes forth in emanation, knowing birth through a specific Aat or Portal of the Word. (The First Utterance is represented as a Black Point in a White Void: the Negatively Existent Singularity, whose Gate is mark'd by the Star Sept and whose Domain lies in the Void anterior to that Stellar Point.) 2. 'Alogos vel... T/magical name...': the Aethyric I, the Positively Existent Singularity. The Second Utterance is a statement of the form taken by the Abstract I, according to its Aatic position or Point of Ingress. The Magical Name or Logos of the Absolute, infinite in its subtleties of pronounciation, is given specificity in the second utterance and thus serves to qualify the nature of the Absolute in Hypostate."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Translated literally, the second utterance may be given thus:- The Word-that-is-Not, the Silence... of/or .. T (T = magical name). This indi-cates the origin and the primal duality of the summoned energy or entity, naming it and hence mastering it. It establishes the duality of Self via the projection of I into Otherness. The second utterance is thus the descrip-tion of the Absolute as it is summoned and called forth into the manifest form of the Divine Artist's Body: the Vessel of its Incarnation. (The Second Utterance is represented as a White Point in a Black Void, its Gate is the particular star/icon with which the magical name has identity and intimate association.) 3. The Abstract Magical Desire:- The Third Utterance is a statement of the powers invoked by the magical name. It may constitute a series of divine appellations expounding the nature of the force invoked, or act in the manner of a hymn unto the Summoned. Its importance is to describe in greater clarity and depth the nature and power that is assimilated by the Sorcerer, also to attract that power, to draw it down to the Vessel of the Flesh and to raise it from the depths. (The Third Utterance is represented by the rays emanating from the White Point, thus symbolising the associative links between the Summoned and the Summoner.) 4. The Totemic Spell:- The Fourth Utterance expounds the sacred con-junction of sensory stimuli that act as 'totems' of the Spell, that is, the par-ticular scents, emotions, tastes, sounds, moods pertinent and conducive to the effective summoning. The Fourth Utterance will also indicate the atavisms wherein the Powers of the Summoned are dormant, that is, the Totem Beasts and Elemental Forms. (The Fourth Utterance is represented by the Geometrical Sign of the Pentagrammaton of the Senses, within whose Angles the Power is focused and contained.) 5. The Reificatory Practice or Wish of Realizing: The Fifth 'Utterance' is that 'spoken' by the Flesh as a whole, that is, it constitutes the Sacred Postures, the Ritual Gestures, the Drawing of the Sigils - the Acts that embody the Will to Realization. It is thus Silence, which precedes and con-cludes the five aspects of formulae, completing the Circle of Enchantment."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE SUMMONING OF THE ANCIENT ONE OF SPIRIT, THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF THE VOID AAT: THE EMBODIMENT OF THE BLACK MAN OF THE SABBAT as in the blood of my Ancestors upon the Hyperborean ice -By this Sigil I summon Thee!

Here openeth the conclave of certain formulae regarding the Circle, Point and Path, whereby the fetish-objects of the Twelfth Letter and the First Letter are conjoined - the Witches' Ladder and the Horse-headed Rod respectively. The Witches' Ladder of Knots is the fetish-object embodying the ophidian energies that convey the interconnectedness between Star, Sigil, Posture, Sense, and so forth. That is to say, the Cord is the fetishistic man-ifestation of the Serpent-power within the Azoth and within Man; it is the sorcerer's rosaiy, the mediator of those Powers that link Aat with Aat upon all levels of the Existent. It is thus that the Cord of the Quintessence has eleven knots, corresponding to the Cells of the Sigillum Azoetia. The fetish itself has two forms - the Knotted Cord and the Circle-Rope; the former embodies the Path of Going Forth; the latter, being the Encircler of the Rite, is the physical emblem of the Binding of any Chosen Formula or Operation of Arte. The Witches' Ladder of Knots is both the Rope of Birth link'd unto the All-Mother and the Hangman's Noose that leadeth unto the Grave. Verily, it becometh the Ouroboric Ring - the True Circle of the Arte Magical -wherein the Rites Emblematick of the One Dream, or Greater Visions, are performed. Therefore let the Rope, the Greater Form of this Tool, be tied in the literal fashion of a Circle. This maketh manifest the All-ensorcelling Cord of Sabbatic Initiation and thereby bindeth the Whole Covine of Witchblood within its bounds. The circumference of the Circle-rope is mystically said to be thrice the length of those that stand within it; for it is the Measure of Thrice-wise Fate and unto its Form the Three Consecrations of the Circle are bound. The Horse-headed Rod is the fetish-object embodying the Principle of Man as the Steed of the Gods. By its composition and structure it is a sub-limate form of the Grand Fetish-tree, whose boughs reach the zenith and whose roots reach the nadir of the Existent. In essence it is the Wand unit-ed with the Principles of Alignment and Possession - it is the 'Direction of Going Forth' united with the Principles of Syncretism; that is, it expresses the Going Forth of the Bodies of Flesh, Light and Shadow in the Mutually-indwelling State of the Summoned within the Form of the Summoner. f 103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Aligned as One Point - God and Man and Beast, I go forth upon the Path of the Rite.

The Horse-headed Rod is also the reposoire and symbol of the Steed that beareth the Spirit of the Adept unto the Sabbat; it is the Besom of Tradition, the Witches' Broom, which so often disguised the Wand and its Carven Head 'neath a brush of twigs. It is the fetish-object of the Famulus as the Steed of Man and of Man as the Steed of the Gods. It is by the means of their simultaneity of motion that the Sabbat's Formulae are fulfilled as above so below. The Rod also serveth as the drum-stick, the Wand that doth arouse the rhythmic motion of the Circle-dance. Likewise it may serve as the Scourge-stave which inciteth the Dance unto its height of frenzy and ecstasy. The Scourge, like unto the Besom, being formed of a stave topped with horse-hair, cords or withies, doth unify both the Knotted Cord and the Horse-headed Rod as fetishistic vehicles of the Magical Power, and thus doth sig-nify the synentasy of all dual means within the Ekstasis of the Sabbat.

In his right hand he held the Cord of Knots as a whip, and with it he smote the Earth. He stood upon the Shore of the Great Sea, the Ocean of all Witchblood; and the Shore was set in a cove, crescent-shaped like unto the Waning Moon. Indeed, above the Waters hung the Moon Itself in Fullness; and in the Waters its reflection lay cradled - beyond all Time. As the God struck the Earth a Voice resounded: \"This is the Place of all my Worship!\". And with this Proclamation I beheld Our Blessed Lady, the White Goddess, leaping forth from the Ocean of Life. She stood before the God, her body like the pale foam of the waters; and yet I could not look upon her face, for it was hid 'neath the Head of a Horse, its mane moon-white and luxuriant in the Ocean's breath. In her left hand she held a wooden stave, carven at one end with a likeness of her mask. Face to Face as Sun to Moon, the Twin Vessels of Life and Death, thus they stood upon the Shore of the Great Sea. And all about them were bestrewn drums beyond number - these are the drums of Sorcerers and Magicians, past and future. Some were broken and cracked, and others as though recently made. The skins of the drums were of all the Beasts of the Earth, that their Song should charm all that liveth. The God smote once more and in that instant the drums played, though no hand touched them. And together - face to face, then back to back, as Twin Serpents coiling - the Goddess and the God danced to the unison of rhythm. As upon the bolts of the Storm they flew!

'Hekas Hekas Este Bebeloi. Zazas Zazas Nasatanata Zazas. Proto Eos Mii.' These three formulae initiate the Sabbatic Rite and open the Way of Ingress. They establish the centre - the 'Hot-point' of the magical working - as the potentiality of the Threefold Circle and as the focus of the Sabbat. 2. 'Nanta Weica Aster. Natna Hekau Ashemu Sek.' This dual formula embodies the Ritual Act of 'The Declaration': the state-ment of intent which delineates the 'Path' of the Rite betwixt Summoner and Summoned. Being of two phrases - of three and four words respec-tively - this formula establishes the duality of the One Spirit as manifest through Goddess and God, Priestess and Priest, in their sigils: This duality is the Great Double House formed by the Twain Powers of Zoa and Azoa. Zoa and Azoa are the omnipresent polarities of the whole spectrum of occult creative energies, and are perpetually being united in all possibilities of Entity: ever-becoming in unity through the reified abstraction and continuity of the I, self-pleasuring through the undiffer-entiating I-sexuality of the Primal Atavism: the Flesh of the Firstborn of Witchblood. 3. The Ritual Act of the Exorcism of the Three Aspects casts the First Circle and binds it with the Sigil of the Goddess -1. This establishes the central point as the Meeting-place of the Three Roads, and thereby con-secrates the Circle as the Horizon of the Triple Essence of Nature. 4. The Ritual Act of the Salutations to the Quarters casts the Second Circle and binds it with the Sigil of the God X . This establishes the cen-tral point as the Meeting-place of the Four Roads, and thereby consecrates the Circle as the Horizon of the Four Elements of Nature. 5. At each Quarter the Word of Xenar is uttered and the Sign thereof, being \"A\" is traced, thus uniting the Four Elements in Spirit and giving utterance to the Tetragrammaton of the Sabbat through the Fivefold Oracle of the Flesh."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"6. The Salutation to the Heights and Depths is the Ritual Act cognate with the focusing of the Five Physical Senses of the Body and all that lies with-in the Horizon, Zenith and Nadir of all Nature unto the central point of the Circle. This obtains the ritual identification between the omnipresent centre and the circumference of Infinity: the concentration of the Five Elements and the Five Senses to the Sixth and Unifying Point of the Telaesthetic Sense. 7. The Sabbatic Chant casts the Third Circle and unites the Sigils of the Twain Powers -L and X, manifesting the Sevenfold Star within the Earthly Rite, thus establishing the central point as the Meeting-place of the Seven Rays. 8. The Charge unto the Shadow opens the Path anterior to the Star, and summons That which lies beyond the Point. Thus it marks the Direction of the Eighth Ray and calls upon the Initiator - the Ancient One of Spirit - to bind and unite the diverse aspects of the Whole Rite. Thus the Eightfold Sigil of the Witches' Sabbath is form'd by the Acts of Ceremony and thus is bound into the Earthly Circle of the Arte Magical. The Sacred Formulae and Rites built upon this foundation establish and reify the Perfection of the Sabbatic Agapae - the permutations of the Eight Rays and the interconnection of the Eleven Cells of the Azoth: the Quintessential Body of all Magick. By the use of the Pure Formulaic Spell as a continuous mantric orison (mantra) the Ritual Acts, which are therein concealed, are sublimated, and are thus made sigillic as Pure Phonic Vibration, thereby assimilating the ritually summoned powers in a manner directly resonant with the Grand Linear Matrix of the Sigillum Azoetia. If chanted whilst concentrating upon a specific glyph the sum energies of the Linear Matrix are channelled to empower that glyph and cause its entity to arise in resurgent sentience, that is, to embody its consciousness and intrinsic state of corporeality in the Vessel of the Sorcerer's Flesh. The Pure Formulaic Spell is a Word-Sigil, a Phonic Graph of the Quintessential Magical Power, and may be used to charge any particular aspect of the Grand Linear Matrix in isolation by focusing the whole in the part: the Totality of I in the Present and Incarnate Vehicle of 'I' or Self. 117"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE TIMES OF THE COVINE In regards to the Teachings concerning the Times most auspicious for the Rites of Arte to be performed, let the passage of the Earthly Rites coincide with the cycles of the Visible Points of Power - the Stars and the Planets, the Sun and the Moon.

SECOND LETTER FORMULA OF THE UNWRITTEN Know ye that there are Grammars and Clavicles of the Sorcerer's Path that may not be translated through the vulgar media of paper and ink books, but rather are they to be read within the Empyrean Conclaves, and only then by such Blessed Ones who are of the Elect and the Chosen. The following sigils may be employed by the Sorcerer to permit his Eye of Vision to go forth in the Sacred Dreaming to read of such Hidden Texts of Magick as he is permitted so to do by the Powers guarding them.

A Sigil is the result of the simplification of a complex of energies exist-ing on many levels - emotional, noumenal, spiritual and so on - in order to make those energies transmutable in accordance with Belief, Desire, and Will. This simplification is expressed by the Will via the creation of an Alphabet embodying Desire - a cipher of curvilinear images or Sacred Letters which can accumulate Belief and serve to bind great power. The Sacred Letters embody the transmutable states of Nature and thus express its Primal Sexuality - the Magical Power Itself. It is thus that the Wisdom of Sigils is to be understood in such a way as to be of some comprehension to the Mortal Reason of Man. But know ye that this explanation is but a Veil of the Arcanum, for the Sacred Alphabet is the Tongue of the Old Gods that were before Man and the mortal gods of Man. It is beyond the Minds of those born solely of the Clay. Let the Wise draw nigh and attain to its Sacred Knowledge. I: Sigillum Alogos, the Omnipresent Linear Matrix.

The Ego is not to be overcome but utilized through the control of Belief. The restricting force of the Ego is transcended by the location of Belief in Nothingness. Doubt and Belief are the Punctuation of Self-Enchantment. Through the voidance of Belief the Ego cannot self-conceive; it becomes vacant, like a womb awaiting the seed of new belief. It may thus be swift-ly obsessed and will, like a womb with child, in time give birth - and thus reify belief. Fanaticism leads to a teratoma of the Ego or else to Genius. The distance from the Percept to the Concept is the distance from Reality.

The distinction between the Substantive and the Essential Modes of Arcana, between the Quaternary/Elemental and the Tertiaiy/Lunar/Psycho-sexual interpreta-tions of these terms is most important, and the Practitioner is advised to exhibit prudence and discernment in this matter. In discussing the interpretation of the Three Exorcized Aspects it is necessary to firstly outline their significance in relation to the Lunar Cycle. The Lunar Cycle is approximately of Twenty-eight Days:- the Moon waxes/increases for fourteen days (the Bright Fortnight) until it is Full, and then wanes/decreases for another fourteen days (the Dark Fortnight). Within the following interpretation the Lunar Month is divided into trip-licities, giving a precise method of interpretation for each day in regards to the nature of the rites and formulae to be worked thereon. (For example on the 13th Day the White Salt is reified and the Powers of the White Aspect of the Mother are summoned.) 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Triplicities of Water/ Salt/ Fire Nine Aspects of Goddess Triple Aspects of Goddess Triple Aspects of Exorcism 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 WhiteWater Red Water Black Water WhiteWater Red Water Black Water WhiteWater Red Water Black Water Virgin Maiden Nymphe a ^ S 3' O a o<) o I ^ 8-« o S TO vj § *§ 3 3 f?

Such names are not to be regarded as fixed and hence may not necessarily apply to the interpretation of other formu-lae throughout the book wherein they may be used; nonetheless - in our present instance - such tides adequately serve to indicate the differentia-tion between specific facets of the Feminine Energy that may be reified upon the Twenty-eight days of the Lunar Month. Within the Ritual Texts of the Arte Magical the Three Principles of the Quintessence are to be interpreted thus:-Water = Fluidic Medium = Blood = Substance. Salt = Solid Medium = Body = Mediator. Fire = Etheric Medium = Spirit = Essence. Here follow certain Modes of Knowing for the interpretation of the Trinity. By these means let the Wise discern and thus apply Our Rites. The First Principle 1) The First Principle is Water, being the Mercury of Alchemy. It is the cor-poreal fluidic substance which serves as the medium of the Quintessence, namely, it is the aggregate of those sexual emissions from both Man and Woman, which are consecrated as the vehicle of the Summoned Powers by the complete Self-Enchantment of the Communicants within the Formulae of Congress. In this understanding 'Water' may refer to the Wines of the Sabbat, the conjoined elixirs of Sun and Moon made manifest and mar-ried according to their secret orbits, conjunctions and alignments in the Flesh of the Priests and Priestesses of Arte. 2) The 'Water', so-called in a ritual text, may also signify the mundane ele-ment of Water consecrated as the Alchemic Mercury and used for the pur-poses of libation. The consecration of the mundane element may be achieved simply by mingling within its substance a single drop of the flu-idic elixirs of congressus or emission. 3) 'Water' may also signify solely the feminine sexual emissions and men-strual blood. For example, in a certain formula of consecration, Water is placed within a chalice, Salt is then added, and both are co-mingled there-in counterparts. Following the act of consecration the contents of the chal-ice are poured around the Circle as a libation; this in turn is followed by the lighting of a Candle or Torch upon a central altar, from whence the Quarter Candles are subsequently lit. This may be understood to encrypt 111"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"the Union of the Priestess and the Priest; the Raising of Magical Power from the Two-as-One; the Transmission of Power unto the Body of the Covine via the Four Gestures of Congress; and the Sum Engendering of the Incamative Spirit specific unto the Rite. Such Mysteries one may exact by Symbol or by Inner Meaning, according to Need, Circumstance, and Degree of Wisdom. 4) The 'Water' also equates with the Blood of the Sacrifice. (See Tenth Letter.) The Second Principle 1) The Second Principle is Salt, the self-same of Alchemy. It is the corpore-al solid of those substances acting as the media of the Quintessence in the same manner as detailed previously. The nature of this solid is the dried or calcinated 'Water' of the Phallus or Kteis, and thus it is sometimes referred to as the 'Ashes of the Sacraments'. In this state the medium of the Quintessence may be imbibed by the Communicants as the 'Bread' of the Agapae, and in this manner the literal substance of their Worship is rein-tegrated into the Sum Body of its Origin. 2) The 'Salt' may also signify the mundane substance of a powder mingled with a little of the Sexual Ashes. This is to be used in the tracing of the Sigils of Arte within and beyond the Circle. (See 'Of Philtres, Powders and Fires', below.) 3) The 'Salt' may also solely signify the masculine aspect of sexual emis-sion, as mentioned in section 3 of the First Principle. The Third Principle 1) The Third Principle is Fire, being the Sulphur of Alchemy. It is the Subtle Essence of that Power of which the Water and the Salt are the phys-ical media. The Fire is that Invisible Power reified by the Communicants in their Contemplative Realisation of the Agapae. It is referred to in Ritual Texts as 'Starlight' and as the 'Fire of the Spirit', of which the myriad nuances are designated 'Rays'. 2) Fire may also signify the mundane element, such as bums in the centre and in the Quarters of the Circle, consecrated as the visible media of the Invisible Fire of Spirit. 142"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE ALCHEMICAL TRANSMUTATION OF THE TRIPLICITIES In the Time of the New Moon the Three Principles emanate from the One Point of Mercury. In the Time of the Waxing Moon the Point of Mercury is manipulated by the Powers of Salt and Sulphur within the Vessel. The Salt and the Sulphur arouse the Tide of the Mercurial Power, until they are both dissolved in the All-Potentiality of the Primordial Ocean. In the Time of the Full Moon the Waters of the Ocean go forth from the Vessel and are consumed in the Point of Sulphur to illuminate the Point of Salt. Thus the Salt of Transmutation becometh the Ashes of the Sacrament, which is the Very Bread of the Sabbatic Communion.

SIGILLIC WISDOM ZSIN-NIAQ-SA: REIFICAHON THROUGH OPPOSITION Know ye that the Ciphers of Automatism are as the Shadow, Opposer and Mediator of Desire; therein is their Secret. By the Sacred Tongue of the Ciphers of Automatism we articulate that which is incommunicable in the Mundane Forms of Language: in the Soliloquy betwixt our constituent facets of Entity we communicate our Desires via Elemental States of Sensation and thus freely achieve satiation through means remote to any expression of Conscious Intent. According to the Degree of their Obliquity to Conscious Intent the Ciphers of Automatism reify Desire through Opposition; thus they mediate and control through Attraction of Contraries. Zsin = The Sigil of Desire existeth in the Domain of the Opposer, that is, within the Body of Shadow. The Grand Sigillic Graph or One Sigil, being solely of Shadow, is typified in the Totem of the Sabbat: the Great Opposer whom Man hath named 'The Devil'. Niaq = The Entity of Desire existeth in the Domain of the Light, that is, within the Body of Light. This is typified in the Sabbatic Rites as the Body of all Women Initiates: the Great Goddess and Queen of the High Sabbat. 161"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"In the Embrace between the Light and the Dark, Zoa and Azoa, the Void-I is illumined in the White Darkness of Zsin-Niaq-Sa:-By the Act of Congress between Zsin and Niaq, by Union through Opposition, the Sigil of the Chosen Desire is raised within the Body of Light as a Black Point or Star within the White Void.

As certain sigils, encoding the secret desires of the heart, are obtained by the conjunction of chosen mundane and sacred signs in the Seventh Path of Sigillic Wisdom, so may the Divine Forms within the Azoth be so conjoined. This method of Syncretic Alignment is best illustrated and exemplified by an explanation of the manner of constructing the Names of such composite Azoetic God-forms."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Example: -The Divine Artist desiring to summon the Powers of the Archetypal Magistry of the Cunning Man and Sorcerer may endeavour to align the following cognate Divine Forms. This Mystery he shall accomplish by the Union or Alchymic Syzygy of their Names, Attributes and Symbols. 1. Seth-pa-kharad = The Aegyptian Form of the Opposer typified as the Rising Sun, the Child of Night upon the Lotus of the Day. It is the god-form of the Silent One - Virgin and Hermaphrodite - an Image of the Firstborn of Witchblood and a Primal Embodiment of the Elder Gods within the Body of Man. 2. Tetzcatlipoca = The Aztec God of Magick, call'd the Smoking Mirror -typified as the Black Obsidian Mirror wherein all Existence is reflected. He is the Very Embodiment of the Magical Power as known and sum-moned by Those who are called 'The People of the Five Suns'. 3. Iblis = The original Djinn of the Persian Deserts, the Spirit of the Secret Fire that dwells in the Seed of the Bless'd and Wise. 4. Loki = The Norse God of Cunning and Trickery. He is the Master of Tuition through Deceit and is the Light-Bringer of the Swift Mind and the Shape-Shifter of the Body. 5. Guede = The Voudon God of Divine Sexuality and Death, the Sovereign Magician of the Grave and the Phallus. 6. Lucifer = The Star of the Morning, the Bearer of the Promethean Flame from Heaven to Earth, the Light-Bringer of the Western Magistry of the Witch and Ceremonial Magician. 7. Phurba = A Tibetan Tutelary Deity originating in the Ancient Bon Sorceiy, used to re-align a Malefic Power or Entity unto the Will of the Pure Magistry. By the Union of the Names of these seven God-forms one obtains the fol-lowing series of letters, the repeated letters being omitted = abcdefghiklo-prstuz. Let the Divine Artist rearrange these letters according to the needs of his Work, the dictates of his Innate Poetics and the subtle directions of the Famulus. Thus saith the Daimon of the Book: Seek ye such Words of Power as resonate most concordantly with the Vital and Integral Rhythmic Paths of the Quintessence. 167"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Thus obtained is the Vibratoiy Formula of the Seven Gods = ZSRA - ID - GB - KHU - TEF - L- POCA. (Pronounced: Zray-eed-jeb-ku-tef-ler-pocar.) This is the Vibration and Word of the composite God-forms within the Azoth and is the Phonic Articulation of that Azoetic Conjunction within the Mundane Sphere. The Divine Artist must now proceed to unite such diverse aspects as the traditional postural and emblematic representations of the God-forms within a single ritual and contemplative structure, ever seeking their uni-fying arcana and employing their vast array of symbolic veils as the Fetishes for Self-Enchantment. The Word resulting from the union of the God-names should be used as the Name of the Spirit Summoned, and as a Formula of continuous Mantic Orison, or Mantra. Also, by the Seventh Path of Sigillic Wisdom, the Word should be reduced unto a single Sigil; for such may serve as the visible focus in the Contemplative and Ceremonial Proceedings. Examples of the Technique of Syncretic Alignment are extant within this Work, most notably in the Formulae of the Congressus given within the Second Cell:-1. The Formula of the Goddess = Zo - An - Shu - P - Ket, being the Word derived from the Names: Zoa - Ononshu - Sept - Khepesh. 2. The Formula of the God = Zo - la - Ku - Seth, being the Word derived from the Names: Azoa - Apethiui - Sept - Sah. The Method of Syncretic Alignment is best employed to align the many corresponding God-forms within the Azoth in order to locate and focus upon the Pure Forms of the Eleven Aatic Intelligences. The application of this method in Ritual and Meditation will render, if successful, the Inspiration of such Dreams and Visions as will teach the Hidden Names and Sigils of the Aatic Genii. It is a Key to the obtaining of the Visions of the Eternal Forms within the Azoth, and is a means of attaining the Secret which unites those Forms in the Sacred Alphabet. Yet take heed! Lose not the unique Beauty and Power of any God or Goddess, but rather realise their States of Singular Entity as mutually indwelling - like a Syzygy of Stars, which are Many and yet seem to be a Single Point of Light. It is essential for the Practitioner of this method to have a wide and well-instructed knowledge of the Earth's many traditions and myths of the Arte Magical. Therefore seek out such Books of Arte as are in the Light of Day and such Hidden Texts and Grammars as are yet in the Shadow. 168"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Let One who wanders far in this Arcanum know well its source in every step.

The Name of that Name is 'The Sphinx of Thanatos'."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE APOTHEOSIS OF SENSATION: EMOTIVE AND NOSTALGIC AESTHESIS There are instants of extreme emotional intensity that seem to embody a nostalgia of unplaced memories together with a certain foreboding of things yet to be. These instants - born of a chance combination of Colour, Scent, Sound, Taste or Touch - are moments to which the Whole World conspires. They are the veiy pivots of Chance, invaluable to the Divine Artist, sending him into an Ecstasy characterized by an abstract pleasure of particular sensuality and utmost emotional poignancy. Lying beyond Sorrow or Joy, of infinite shades and nuances, these instants, captivating One's entirety in a Void of Illuminative Clarity, are the Veiy Bestowers of Inspiration. Such moments of nostalgic resurgence and emotional intensity are the sensory corollaries of the Letters of the Sacred Alphabet and are call'd 'The Apotheoses of Sensation'. Such moments must be utilized to their fullest advantage as they are rare and are the Bearers of True Poetic Inspiration. They may be used to empower or to create a Sigil through concentration or through automatism, or in calling forth analogous atavistic memories. It is these Sensual Ecstasies that form the Embodying Principles of the Sorcerer. Their occurrence and potency may be cultivated and drawn upon by the following means:-1. Mnemonic Verses - to capture the vital nuances of a specific sensation. Such Verses or 'Emotive Spells' must conjure the desired feeling and hold it with intensity in one's heart, and should, by means of the associations between Word and Emotion, arouse the Sensory Apotheoses at Will. The Emotive Spells are used as Incantations whilst concentrating upon Sigils during contemplation and may be employed to charge such Sigils with great power. Mnemonic verses should also be used to embody the strong emotive nature of one's dreams, and thus will allow one to conjure such ecstasies as are twin - in Waking as in Dreaming. Let all such Verses be composed by one's Innate Poetics and Inspiration, and best be it done within the Circle of Arte. 2. (i) Sigils - derived through the Fifth Path of Sigillic Wisdom. Let the Hand take up the Quill and be guided by the emotive force. Let all sensations be concentrated therein and be transmitted through the automatism of the Quill upon paper, thus resulting in the swift and direct expression of the sensation. The chaotic stream of lines should be sepa-rated out into single parts and thence stylized to produce simple glyphs remote in Form, yet One in Force, with the Nature of Intent. 170"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Transcend ye the Present Consciousness of Intent by the articulation of the Primal Impetus of Desire Itself. The catharsis of every impurity and imbalance of Being may be achieved through the swift automatism of Emotion within Sigillic Script - and thereby cometh Healing to Heart, Soul and Mind. Such is the Oracle ofSethos in this Arcanum. (ii) The Apotheoses of Sensation may be used to empower previously formed Sigils for specific purposes. For example, a Sigil composed through the Seventh Path of Sigillic Wisdom may be empowered by any sensation of sufficient strength. Since such Power is transmutable there need not necessarily be an analogy between Sensation and Sigil, although a clear link between the Sigil, its Intent and its empowering emotions and sensations is most advantageous to the swiftness of a Spell's success. 3. Posture - See the Third Cell Formula: 'The Powers of Sah'. 4. Imagination - This is a vital means to the manipulation of the Sensorial Apotheoses at Will. By way of phantasy, visualization and reverie Thou shalt locate the key imagery associated with the specific emotional nodes of Pure Ekstasis, and by the obsession of such Imaginings focus'd within the Sacred Letters Thou shalt fully encircle Thyself with the Emotive Iconography unique unto Thine own Sorceiy. By Sexual Reverie Thou shalt discover the Primal Motivations for each Sacred Letter, and these shall each be embodied as the Attendant Genii of Thy Solitary Sabbats - as Incubi and as Succubi obsessing Thine own Self projected in Light and in Shadow. Hinder not, nor restrict the scope of Imagination, but through the Purity of Divine Aesthesis let it mould the Very Substance of Thy Thought. For Imagination focus'd through Will, Desire and Belief will determine the Very Form of Astral Menstruum which contains and directs those three powers.

Thus, by Sigillic Wisdom, the Stars Without are link'd and are as one with the Stars Within. The Foci of the Perfected Sorcerer's Will, Desire and Belief are Points of Infinite Mobility. These Core-energies are the Mediating Points on all lev-els of the Existent for those Fundamental Powers of Magick that are called 'The Letters of the Sacred Alphabet'. These Points, which are the Vital Principles of Power and the Grand Formulae of Sorcery, may be centred in any Place, Form, or Time as determined by the Sorcerer's Will, Desire and Belief. Thus the Perfected One causeth Change unto and beyond all Nature.

Despite the precision of a specific sigil in articulating an emanation of a Sacred Letter it can only approximate the Truth of that Letter, or rather apply it in a specific and thus necessarily limited way. In this 'approxima-tion' only an instantaneous fraction of the Continuous Glyph is realised. Yet all Sigils, in embodying facets of the Whole Sigil, tend towards the illu-mination and utilization of the Totality; that is, if the Sigillic Path is walked upon in its Instant of Reification one steps upon the True Way of its Power and thus upon the True Way of all Sorcery. 174"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Like those Visible Points of Power - the Planets and the Stars - that by Virtue of their Positions, Angles and Alignments do place their Influence upon Thee, so there are certain Invisible Points of Power that are conjunct with Thee.

The Apotheoses of Sensation may be sublimated to specific postures, each of which typifies, concentrates and symbolises the nature of a specific sen-soiy peak (or Ecstasy). These Magical Postures represent the nodes of Ekstasis and are directly analogous to the Letters of the Sacred Alphabet. Consequently the adoption of a single posture may be used in contempla-tion to draw upon the Powers of its corresponding Letter. It is thus, by Posture embodying Sacred Letter, that the Sensual Periphery of One's Being is defined and the control of the subtle interaction of its component forces is attained to. In rituals the Hidden Powers of the Sensorial Apotheoses may be drawn upon through their magical link with certain animal-totems; the Artist may thus employ masks and animal skins to increase the strength and potency of this self-identifying connection. The Powers raised by such rites may be used for diverse purposes such as Transformation, Spirit-Vision and the sympathetic control of animals. Used in conjunction with each other the Magical Postures relate to the Arcana of the Paths of the Sigillum Azoetia, giving numerous composite glyphs and permutations of totemic forms. These being shown in the countless theriocephalic and composite animal god-forms of Ancient Tradition (The Millions-of-Forms-of-Being). It is thus that the Sabbat has been portrayed as a Rite of Wild Orgia between Beast, Satyr and Human - this symbolically communicating the uses of Magical Posture in Rites of Sexual Congress. In Dance, the permutations (or Complex Sigils) of Posture are linked by the fluidic connections of movement, and it is thereby that the Sacred Rhythms or Phonic Alignments of each Path are revealed. The Magical Dance is the reificatory catalyst, via kinetic articulation, of the Powers of the Sacred Alphabet; for the Ecstatic Continuum of the Sabbatic Revelry is a means to embody the Universal Abstract Principles and Energies."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ENCHANTMENTS OF SAH BEING SPELLS OF TRANSFORMATION WRITTEN IN THEIR APOTHEOSIS OF SENSATION, TO BE USED FOR THE DIVERSE PURPOSES OF SHAPE-CHANGING, THERIOMORPHIC CONGRESS, ASSIMILATION OF ATAVISTIC POWERS, AND DIVERSE OTHER SORCERIES.

Thy skeleton shall be wrought from the First Star's Iron and it shall be clothed with a flesh transmutable unto the directions of Thy Will, Desire and Belief; yea, within the Silent Grimoire of its Blood will flow the Very Wisdom of the Magical Quintessence. Become Sah Entire: seek not the Philosopher's Stone of Transmutation, but become it. So saith the Daimon of I! THE STANCE OF DEATH IS THE GATEWAY FOR THE BIRTH OF THE IMMORTAL ONE The Act of Iconoclasm sublimated to posture is the Stance of Death. It is any physical or psychical posture conducive to the poignancy of one's self-consciousness as Mortal, and is potentially comprised by all stances of the flesh and mind symbolic of and typifying Death by a sensual approxima-tion of its reality. In this arcanum is the present realisation of one's inher-ent future death. By such postural assumption one gains release from Present Form and attains to the Non-modality of Being. By One who is knowing of Arte, this Freedom of Form may be used to take the Shapes of Beasts and of Gods. The analogue of this Attainment in terms of Mind is the Arcanum cal-l'd SIA: a Stateless State of Gnosis, never becoming nor ceasing to be, per-petually impressing its ipseity upon the Continuum of Thought through-out all Sentience, and focus'd in the Mage as Living Truth. In terms of mentation it is manifest as the Pure Intellect of I, devoid of self-entifica-tion in its nature, yet ever able to indwell, assume and shift from thought unto thought, view unto view, self unto self through the Millions-of-Forms-of-Being. As Memory Unbound from Temporality, it is possessed of infinitely-swift assimilation from every direction of Time. In instanta-neity, and hence from moment to moment, it manifests in the Mage as Illumination, as a Continuity of Knowledge Absolute, and as a Liberty of Awareness beyond his incarnate state. By virtue of its assimilative power beyond the confines of mortal self-hood, the Transmutative Mind is, in each moment of Being, renewed and transformed through a continuual integration of all Otherness.

By Rite, Contemplation, and Arcana, and in manner akin to the Apotheosis of the Shape-shifter's Arte, the Mind here-in attains focus'd motility from state unto state through a Knowing Pageant of Selves and thus is possessed of an ever-changing current of Divine Inspiration.

The Intent of these Principles, which are veiled and woven into the text of the Grimoire, is to guide the Sorcerer unto the Original Purity of the Senses and to maintain their Perfect'd Affinity with all aspects of the Existent. The Keys to the understanding of these Principles of Divine Artistry are the Mystical 'Letters' or Symbolic Vessels of the Sabbatic Tetragrammaton - each Letter having specific significance upon the many levels of symbol-ism and interpretation used within the interconnectedness of the Cipher. The multiple interpretations of each Tetragrammatic Letter may be con-current or distinct within a specific context; that is to say, the ambiguity of the symbol permits the possibility of differing or even opposing inter-pretations of a single formula or spell, and hence many applications of a single arcanum may be inferred from a common unifying text. This per-mits the Adept to contemplate the fundamental arcana which constitute the basis of the vast and diverse applications of Occult Practices, and thus, realizing the root-formulae of the Arte, he consequently may understand the full scope of their applications upon every level of his Awareness and Being. The multiple interpretations which are simultaneously encoded in the Mystical Letters of the Tetragrammaton are given below:-The Hand The Hand is the physical representation of the Fivefold Star, call'd as I have dreamt 'The Sign of Xenar', and by Tradition being named 'The Pentalpha'. It is thus the symbol and the embodiment of the Pentagrammaton: the Fivefold Word of the Flesh realised and articulated via the five senses of physicality. The Myriad Postures of the Hand used in ritual and in contemplation correspond to the Divine Postures assumed by the Body as a Whole. The Hand Postures also correlate to the alignments of the senses in the 193"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Formulae of the Apotheoses of Sensation and to the Linear Ciphers of Sigillic Wisdom, whereby sensation is encoded and communicated for occult purposes. According to the Tradition of Our Sacred Ritual the Magical Gesture of the Rais'd and Outstretched Hand serves as the Sign of the Pentacle, and is thus used to charge and salute the Quarters of the Circle, even to meet clasp-unto-clasp with those Spirits who ward it from Outside. The Rais'd Dextral Hand is the physical analogue of the Upright Pentagrammatic Sign = , and casteth forth the Deosil Gyre of Power. The Rais'd Sinistral Hand is the physical analogue of the Averse or Downwards-Pointing Sign of the Pentagram = , and casteth forth the Widdershins Gyre of Power. In the application of this teaching, let the Wise discern well, applying the good custom and lore of Tradition for the gain of such insight as Our Arcana conceal. The Fingers of the Hand are corresponded to the Elements, Senses, and Points of the Upright Pentalphic Sign thus:-The Thumb = Earth + Touch + Lower Left Point. The Forefinger = Air + Smell + Upper Left Point. The Index finger = Spirit + Hearing + Uppermost Point. The Ring finger = Water + Taste + Upper Right Point. The Little finger = Fire + Sight + Lower Right Point. The Palm = Void + Telaesthetic Seise + Central Point. The Hand may thus be interpreted in Ritual and Formulaic texts as:-1) The literal hand, i.e.: the Primary Vehicle of the Tactile Sense. 2) The Sign \"A- or/and *: the Ritual Gesture of the Rais'd and Outstretched Hand. 3) The five senses of physicality, and hence the Perceptual Body as a Whole. The Eye The Symbol of the Eye may be interpreted firstly in the literal manner, i.e.: the physical vehicle of the optical sense. In this interpretation the left eye is attributed to the Lunar and the Feminine, whilst the right eye is attrib-uted to the Solar and the Masculine. The two are united in the second interpretation of the 'Eye', namely the 'Eye' as the Oracle of the Blessed Sight, the Third Eye of Ancient Tradition, wherein the Sun and the Moon are unified in the Stellar Symbol of the Blazing Eye within the Triangle. In"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"this second interpretation all senses of physicality are focused in the opti-cal sense by ritual and contemplative means, thus endowing the Eye with the power to see beyond the Visibility of the Mundane and to gaze into the Transmundane Aires and Spheres of the Existent, even into the Very Cells of the Azoth - wherein are the Holiest Visions of Our Arte enshrined. In a third interpretation the 'Eye' may imply an Entity of Projected Vision, such entities constituting the Corpus of the Watcher, namely:-i) The Internal Projection of the Sight into the Aires and Spaces Within, ii) The External Projection of the Sight into the Points of the Quarters of the Circle and beyond the Gates thereof. iii) The Entities of the Blessed Sight who are the Guardians of the Gates and of the Spaces Beyond and Between. The fourth interpretation of the 'Eye' refers to the Openings of the Body, especially those of a sexual significance:-i) The Kteis, as the Oracle informing the Secrets of the Sacred Visions. ii) The urethral aperture of the Phallus: the Weeping Eye of the Sun. iii) The Anus: the Blind Oracle of Abomination, serving as the final repos-itoire of abortive congress. Thus the Eye may be interpreted as:-1) The Physical Vehicle of the Optical Sense. 2) The Psychical Vehicle of Sight. 3) The Projected Entities of the Sight. 4) An Opening of the Body, especially one pertaining to sexual formulae. 5) A phonetic equivalent of T. The Phallus The Phallus may firstly be interpreted in the literal sense as the male gen-erative organ, and hence may be used to denote the Masculine Power as a Whole. It is subsequently used as the symbol of those aspects of Power within the Dextrality of the Great Double House:- the God, the Powers of Azoa and Sa, the Sun, the Right Hand and the Right Eye, and their embodiment as the Incarnate Sorcerer and Priest of the Gods. The Symbol of the Phallus is the anthropomorphic corollary of the World-Tree, the Axis uniting the Zenith of Heaven with its dark twin in the Nadir of the Underworld. It is also cognate with the symbol of the Crossroads; the Phallus being the Crucifix upon which the Rose of the Kteis is exalted. The Phallus is also identified with the Black Serpent, the vehicle for the male aspect of the Ophidian Current."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Mouth The Symbol of the Mouth represents the Gateway and the Oracle of the Word. Firsdy, this is to be interpreted in the literal sense, as the means of articulating the Word of the Adept via Speech; and secondly, in the psy-cho-sexual sense of the Ophidian Mysteries. The Mouth in the first inter-pretation is the Oracle of the Serpent's Tongue, which being bifidic sym-bolises a unity of the twin aspects of the Ophidian Current (Zoa/Azoa). By the Tongue of the Serpent, the Adept pronounces the Double-Word of Truth; that is, he perfects the phonic articulation of the Cipher and gives forth the Word thereof in the Great Double House of Heaven. He utters the Grand Ourobouric Spell of the Sacred Alphabet and thereby encircles the Universe. The Serpent's Tongue is thus the symbol of the Perfected Power of the Adept to pronounce the Arcana via the Gate of the Corporeal Mouth. The Symbol of the Serpent's Divided Tongue also relates to the Mouth as the Arouser of the Kteis, and indeed as the Aroused Kteis Itself - both being interpreted in the manner of the Ophidian Oracle. In this interpre-tation the duplicity of the Mouth-symbol is explicit, representing both the Sexual and the Cephalic Oracle:-1) The Lunar Sexual Mouth, being the Kteis, wherein the clitoris is the Tongue of the Serpent Zoa, is the Oracle of the Lunar/Sinistral Currents. It is the Gateway of the Utterance (Uterus) whose Secrets (Secretions) are the Psycho-sexual Elixirs in which the Magical Vibrations of the 'Word' are embodied and reified. The Oracular Utterances of the Ophidian Secrets concur with the lunar/menstrual cycle (see Ninth Cell formulae). The study of this sexual lore must be precisely undertaken by the individ-ual Priestess in the light of her own predilected nature and in the light of such Knowledge offered by Our Tradition. Inasmuch as the vaginal secre-tions pronounce the Speech of the Moon, so too the semen of the Priest pronounces the Speech of the Sun; in this symbolic interpretation the male urethral aperture gives forth the Living Word of the Solar/Dextral Currents. 2) The Cephalic Mouth, being the literal oral orifice wherein lies the Tongue of the Serpent Azoa, is the Arouser of the Sexual Mouth. By the Twin Serpents' Kiss the Living Word of the Oracle is imbibed from the Sangreal of Witchblood, and it is thus that the True Secrets may be passed on in Silence and in Love. Yet the Mouth bringeth forth Silence as Speech and is thus the Phonic Articulator of the Sacred Alphabet and the Translator of the Oracular Elixirs of Sun and Moon."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"In addition, we may give a third interpretation:-3) The Mouth as the vehicle of the gustatory sense: the Celebrant of the Outward Feast, the Communicant of the Revealed Sacraments of Bread and Wine.

It is a Supreme Act of Self-Enchantment whereby the Divine Artist ensorcels and bewitch-es himself by fervent conjurations, thus to witness and to participate with-in the Vision of the Earthly Circle as the Arena of Nature's Eternal Fornication. It is the Magical Act of binding the Primal and Universal Sexuality of Being within the Circle of Arte and within the physical body of the Sorcerer. The steps whereby this is achieved may be numerous and undertaken over great periods of time, but the actual realisation of the Arcanum is sudden and instantaneous. Let the Sorcerer proceed from within the Sanctuary of his Contemplation to the realisation of his Whole Body as Living Sensation. This is to be attained by the sudden adoption of a Posture encapsulating the Sum Mysteries of Egress: a lightning-swift physical, emotional, or con-templative 'leap' which captures the Sensualism of Death and Ecstasy, and thus hurls the Sorcerer into the maelstrom of the Primal Fomicatrix. It is at this divine instant that the Sorcerer realises the Essential and Undifferentiated Power of his own Entity within the Wholeness of Nature. He 'walks' upon the Veiy Centre of the One Mystery, and his Flesh is the Proclamation of its Living Truth unto All. The Attainment of the First Gesture may be given the necessary impe-tus for its realisation by the complete obsession, the One Pointed Self-Enchantment of the Divine Artist in any single facet of his Sorcery.

THE SECOND GESTURE: REFLECTIVE AND ABSTRACT CONGRESS The Second Gesture of Congress concentrates upon the use of the Magical Circle as the Mirror for those Arcana of which one has dreamt, and thus it may be defined as the projection of the Dreamt Sabbat into the Earthly Circle and Vessels of Arte. This should not be the slavish repetition of one's magical dreams, but rather the precise articulation of those Powers informing the perceived imageiy of the Dreamt Vision. Thus, through an Initiated Understanding of Oneiric Vision, the Adept shall create - via the medium of Ritual and Contemplative Spell-craft - a reciprocal extensivity between the Realms of Waking and Dreaming Perception based upon the essential unity of those Powers which underlie both.

Such is the manner of this Teaching that I, in dreaming of a Mystery thus - of a fair and youthful god wrought as though of living marble and of precious stone, standing upon a Temple dais, whose lips should move and impart to me the words and ways of secret rites and orison, I should in my waking hours project these phantasies and bind them unto Acts of Magick. Firstly, that my Lovers in coming unto me should behold me as that dreamt-of divinity, and that their lips should move with those secrets of worship taught unto me; indeed that they should adore me as the Living Flesh of those Gods of whom I have dreamt. Secondly, in coition with the Adored Vessels, of Man or of Woman consecrated as the Body Visible of mine own Cultus, I should myself utter the Words of the Sacred Orison in a backwards fashion, in sound as in sense. I will worship my dreamt-of deities through the Living Flesh of mine Othernesses - with blasphemy and with a Paeon of Opposition unto their sanctity. Thus, as in a Mirror, mine Earthly Blasphemies will be as Heavenly Exultations! The Abstract or Reintegrative Permutation of the Second Gesture This permutation of the Second Gesture concentrates upon the use of the physical body of the Priest/Priestess as the Mirror or Reflective Corollary of the Stellar and Subtle Body of the God and Goddess. It also treats of the reflective nature of the astral menstruum - the aethyr in which every minutiae and nuance of one's magical working is captured. Because of the undifferentiating capacity of reflection within the astral media and subtle bodies an alchymic and transmutative procedure is necessitated in order to purify and reintegrate any unwanted effluvium and unnecessitous influences. This gestural permutation operates thus - to obtain the Purity of the Azoth at all Mediatory Points of the Sorcerer's Work. Every Act of Congress is an Act of Re-unification. 1) The Auto-sexual application :-Firstly formulate, or employ as dreamt, a Sigil for the Azoetic Quintessence, this being the Form of Forms and serving as the visible focus of Intent at the culmination of the Act. Secondly evoke and summon using such words and means as are given below (see 'The Adoration of the Grand Posture'), also by the Vessel of the Mouth let the Adept persist in the utterance of the mantric formulae of 'Abra-Khu-Zraa; Zsin-Niaq-Sa' until he has passed beyond twilight into the Illuminate Darkness that shines at the Cross'd Roads. The words of this mantric formula encompass 200"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"the permutations of the Vessels, Gestures and Mysteries of the Congressus, and empower the same with the Powers of Zoa and Azoa. With the Vessel of the Mouth thus ensorcelled, let the Adept proceed in auto-erotic stimulation. Let him project his desires through the medium of sexual reverie, alternating between the Willed Intent of Pure Desire and the freely associative Phantasy - thus establishing a rhythm of Belief and Non-Belief. In reverie let him seek to circumambulate the Circle of his Work's Imagery and wander throughout all the Worshipp'd Forms there-of within his Imagination. At the instant of orgasm, focus entirely and solely upon the Sigil; cast all into its Furnace. This is cognate with the procedure of the Iconoclasm used in the Egress Rite and may also be conjoined with a Synaesthesia of all Sensation into Sexuality. As a Serpent undulating, the True and Secret Will moves between Belief and Non-Belief, gathering impetus until, at the Gate where Phantasy and Reality meet in the orgasm, it strikes. Succumb! Let its venom beguile Thee into the Blessed Sleep of the Oracular Trance. Upon waking proceed according to that of which one has dreamt. 2) The Normative Application:-This Formula constitutes the normative procedure of the Congressus between the Priest and the Priestess. It is the well-worn path of tradition leading unto the Grand Posture of Our Living Ekstasis: the Sacramental and Celebratory Act of Coition betwixt the God and the Goddess as embodied in the Earthly Vessels of Man and Woman. It is the Mystical Gesture of the Agapae which presently reifies within the Circle of Our Arte the Mystery of the Eternal Coitus, the Union between the Omnipresent Polarities of Being and Non-Being as it is reciprocated upon all levels of the Existent. By virtue of its most potent ambience, which is given impetus and is reaffirmed by the all-pervading nature of its Mystery, it serves as a means to realign and unite the diverse aspects of one's magical work, magnetiz-ing all unto the Twin Powers of Zoa and Azoa. Thus, as a Formula of Abstract Congress, it serves to reintegrate the multifarious strands of the Arte into the Prototypal Pattern of the Twain-as-One, and yet - as the Formula typifies the Constant and Eternal Nature of this Mystery - it is necessarily the Primal Arcanum of the First Gesture, that is, of the Perpetuity of the Sabbatic Orgia throughout all Entity. The Evocation and Summoning as given below detail the Ritual Procedure of the Normative Application of the Second Gesture and that of the First Gesture in its Primary Form. It may also be used as the basis of the Sacred Orison to be recited as the Preliminary and Preparatory Act for the other Gestures and Formulae of the Congressus:-201"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Adoration of the Grand Posture By means of the Sacred Orison, wherein is hid the Very Breath of Life, stir ye up the Wine that seethes within the Graal of the High Sabbat; and with Thine Eye behold therein the Visions of the Grand Dreaming reflected from the Pure Forms of the Quintessence Azoth.

It is this Mimetic Power that characterizes the Third Gesture of Congress, the Adept assuming such Forms in his Bodies of Light and of Shadow, and taking on such cognate postures in his Physical Form, as will vitalize and empower his Present State of Entity with the Primal Atavistic Powers of his own Antiquity and Futurity. Before the Adored Icons of Thy Sorcery be Thou as a Mirror, reflective of their Forms and Qualities. Thus by assimilation Thou shalt exert their Powers as if Thine own Being were their Very Reality. Such is the Counsel of Sethos, Ward of the konostasis! The Transformative Application of the Third Gesture The first application of this Gesture is the Mastery of the Powers of Transformation, these being 'The Powers of Sah'. Within Thy Present body of Flesh, O' Mortal Man, the Primal Seed of all Entity sleeps. It is the Infant Sphinx which, in arising, passeth through the Four Elements of the World. Its Spirit dwelleth in all Bodies of Substance - in the Dragon coil'd amongst the Fire of the Stars; in the Leviathon - whose Passing divides the Great Ocean's Water; in the Hawk of Gold wrought of the Sun - upon whose Wings are the Voices of the Four Winds; and in the Great Satyr of the Earth - whose cloven feet make the ground to belch forth flame and torrent, whose Horns graze the Sky and draw down the Swift Hands of the Storm. By Thine Arte, 0' Mortal Man, recall the bestial propensities of Thy Carnal Ancestry, and all the Powers thereof restore unto the Safe-keeping of Thy Heart. Arise! Arise in Thy Multitude of Bodies -As the Ever-Becoming One, the Sphinx unto All that Is! O Thou Flesh of mine own Present Embodiment, Thou art the Flesh of All Desire, the Transmutable One of the Quintessence Azoth! Thou art the Devil of High Sabbat. Let the Adept assume in his physical body a posture typifying the Beast whose Powers he desires to assimilate, and in his Bodies of Light and of Shadow likewise assume the Twin Opposing Forms of that Bestial Nature - Active and Passive."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Let his Contemplation be upon the Sigils of this Desire, that by the sen-sations of his Whole Entity being focus'd therein the Bestial Force shall wax strong to possess him. Let the Sigils of the Desire recall the physical form of the Bestial Spirit, its Powers as Abstractions of Entity, the Sensations and Emotions aroused by its Nature, its affinity with the Adept in Waking as in Dreaming, and all such means of Identification as operate betwixt Summoner and Summoned. Let the Spell, the Enchantment of Sah, be forged in the Apotheosis of Sensation resonant unto the Bestial Power invoked. Let the array of the Adept be the skin of the Beast; his ornamentation and fetishes the bones thereof. And let the Idols of his Worship be such Icons as do represent the Beast, in both form and force. Thus be ye masked in Past States made memorable! Become ye the Ape of All that liveth, that in mimiciy the Powers there of shall once more be Thine. Yet Beware! Remember that Thou art but Mortal Man and are yet the Seed of That which Man will be! The Transubstantiative Application of the Third Gesture In this gestural application the essence of one's transmundane forms is transmuted through the adoption of a physical posture typifying a Divine or Infernal Power; that is, the Bodies of Light and of Shadow are caused to vibrate upon a harmoniously resonant level in their specific realms according to the magically-assumed posture of the Sorcerer's Corporeality. This facilitates the ability of the Adept to 'enter' the required strata of Being by becoming aware of his State of Entity existent upon that level and, by the transubstantive effect of the Physical Postures upon that State of Entity, to raise or lower its awareness/vibration unto the required level for the articulation of his Magical Power in that Domain. Going forth amid the Gods in the Body of Light Becomest I a God amongst Gods. Unto the Purity of the Quintessence am I Transubstantiate in mine Essence of Darkness and ofLight:-By the Focus of my Senses in the Twenty-two Nodes of the Continuum of Sensual Apotheosis the Purity of Telaesthesis is attained. By the Focus of my Psyche in the Twenty-two Points of the Continuity ofEkstasis the Purity of Will, Desire and Belief is attained as the One Continuity of Awareness. By the assumption of the Twenty-two Physical Postures typifying the Powers and the Principles of the Sacred Alphabet in the Flesh -205"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Mine own Body of Light passeth through the Forms of the Elder Gods existent within the Empyrean Abode. Mine own Body of Shadow passeth through the Forms of the Elder Gods existent within the Infernal Abode. Thus I go forth as a True God amid the Company of the Elect! I walk serene amongst the clay gods of men. I go forth in the Zenith as in the Nadir of the Aethyr. I enter in at the Gates of the Eleven veiled Stars, neither men nor gods may hinder the Way. For I am the Cryptogram of Eternity enfleshed in the Light of the Stars and in the Darkness betwixt the Stars -I shine forth in the Image of all the Elder Gods. The Kinaesthetic Application of the Third Gesture The Sacred Postures linked in the continuity of the Dance mimic the pro-totype of the Non-modality of Being. For in passing from Posture to Posture - from Beast to Satyr to Man to Deity, back to Beast once more -the Sorcerer mimics the cycle of his own incarnations throughout the processes of evolution and transmutation. In the Dance he symbolically passes through each facet of Life - the Self-Pantheon of the Millions-of-Forms-of-Being - and yet it is this protean fluidity of Shape-shifting which mimics the Vital Integer of Change, that is, Death. Thus in the Ekstasis of the Sacred Dance the Sorcerer achieves (via a simulation of all Temporal Existences focused in the Eternal Instant of the Circle) a Mimesis of Thanatos, an aping of Death by the Body becoming its own Totality instantaneously at the Dance's culmination. The Sacred Dance may be seen as a ritual circumambulation under-taken by the Adept through the Self-Pantheon as sublimated to specific ritual postures, culminating in the attainment of the Supreme Metamorphic State which is Between and Beyond the Million-of-Forms-of-Being. This is the Ideal of the Sacred Dance, yet in actuality it is a preparatory act, a preliminary rehearsal for the Mimesis of Death achieved in the Seventh and Eighth Stages of the Sabbatic Rite. The Seventh Act of the Sabbat, being the Sexual Stage of the Rite, resumes the same process as that detailed above. In the Orgiastic Ring of Carnality the Sacred Postures are once more linked in a fluidic cycle of kinaesthetic metamorphosis, and by the Whole Covine united in this Act - in the Four Gestures and by the Four Vessels of Congress - it is the Arcane method whereby the Perfected Entity of all Blessed and Wise is incarnated in the Living Word of Flesh. By the Congressus performed at the Triple Crossroads of the Empyrean, Earthly and Infernal, we create at the Earthly Circle's Heart a vortex of superfecundatory power, a Gateway for the Incarnative Energies of Our Antiquity and Futurity of Being! 206"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE FOURTH GESTURE: ABORTIVE AND TRANSUBSTANTIATIVE CONGRESS The Fourth Gesture is of Three Stages in its Working Procedure:-1) Let the Initiate engage in erotic stimulation (auto-sexual or otherwise according to the Desire's nature) 'as if' orgasm were an inevitable conclu-sion of the act. Let his belief be this:- that with the satiation of the Carnal Desire the Wish envisaged in the accompanying sexual reverie will be rei-fied; that is, with the absorption of Mind in the Apotheosis of Love, the Wish - which had been the preoccupation of consciousness in the sexual phantasy prior to the Apotheosis - will be made real. Let him perform the act with firm conviction and belief in his appar-ent intent to achieve satiation. This denial of the truth of the act is achieved through the violent obsessiveness of Self-Enchantment. Let the Wish be envisaged as a Sigil, as an Amulet, as a Succubous Djinn, for thus its Entity shall be given Form suitable for the medium of sexual reverie. 2) At the imminence of orgasm cease the activities of the First Stage. Turn inwards, mightily swing around the Phantasy into an Internity. Thus achieve an introversion of the Projected Wish. Deny the flesh its relief and thus provoke an inward chaos of frustrated yearning. Such chaos is caused by the Entity of the Wish internally reorganizing and seeking a new and swift release for its sexually-obsessed impetus of Desire. Thus the Entity of the Wish undergoes a transubstantiation, a metamorphosis of essence, in order to gain a state of possible reification. (If the Fourth Gesture is not performed auto-sexually, but rather under the guidance of another, then the Witch-Queen responsible for the direc-tion of the act must discipline the Adept should he succumb unto the temptation for carnal satisfaction. If ejaculation occurs the seed must be reabsorbed by the Adept and the process of the Fourth Gesture begun a-new. Likewise fatigue must not be indulged in, nor any sentiment or emo-tion detrimental unto the Purity of the Rite's Intent.) The control over the Self-Enchantment of the First Stage's 'As if' Belief «nd the Self-control required to abruptly cease the Phantasy and the act of stimulation is to be learnt through the rigorous disciplines of Contemplation whilst abiding in the Houses of the True Gods, that is, whilst in those Postures secretly taught in Dreaming that are harmonious-ly resonant unto the Azoetic Forms within the Quintessence. Let the Adept who has a high degree of Self-mastery, even in the very midst of turbulent obsession, proceed to repeat this Abortive and Transubstantiative Act of Congress. With each repetition of stimulation 207"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"and sudden cessation the Sigil of the Wish must remain the sole unchanged element of the Working (that is unless one is instructed in a Dream by a suitable authority that it should be changed, and one is accordingly shown the transmuted form). Thus the visible focus of the Wish is the constant and immutable nexus of the Gesture, giving the Adept a signifying point whereby he may keep control and maintain his centre of perception in the midst of Desire's tumult of metamorphoses. Around the Sigil in Dreams and in Phantasy the Entity of the Wish, gaining greater impetus with each repetition of the Abortive Gesture, will accumulate a phantasmagoric multitude of seductive bodies, each seeking to tempt the Adept into the fulfilment of their Entity in carnal satiation. With each repetition of the Gesture the internal struggle of the desire for satiation will resound further and deeper into strata of atavistic powers and memories. 3) Upon the eventual fulfilment of the act in orgasm the Ancestral Powers are awakened in the consciousness of the Adept and are bestowed upon his Present State of Being as Powers of Transformation and Enchantment. The culmination of the Gesture of Transubstantiative Congress may be in a further act or Gesture of Congress. Thus there may be a conjunction betwixt this Formula and that of the other Gestures. Through the Self-Masteiy of the Adept the Primaeval Entity of all Desire will be summoned and bound within his own Internity of Being. By the Sexual Daimon made deific and martyred through its own Self-overcom-ing impetus - like unto the Serpent devouring its own tail - the Incarnate Vessel of the Sorcerer becomes an eternal cycle of resurrections. This is focus'd through the Earthly Sabbat as a Perpetual Instant of Becoming. The Sorcerer as the Ever-Becoming Body of the Primal Atavism is the Gateway for the Knowledge of all Witchblood's heredity. Such Wisdom, being decreed in the Apotheosis of the Agapae, is an eruptive surge of Edenic Creativity, a Potent Current of Godlike Spaciousness vitalizing those whose Entity abides at the Cross'd-Ways of the Sabbat in the One Continuity of Ekstasis.

SIGILLIC WISDOM: APHORISTIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE FORMULAE In the use of a single Sacred Letter the Whole Alphabet's Power is united and is drawn upon, but according to the specific nature of that Letter. Every Apparent Form of a Sacred Letter is in truth only an application and an approximation of that Letter's True Form, for each Sacred Letter is in Itself ever transcendent of its own Visible Forms and Meanings. The Sacred Letter is an Arcanum inscrutable and unfathomable, an integral 216"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"continuum within the Current of all Magick momentarily captured and defined through the Paths of Sigillic Wisdom. The Ancient Hieroglyphic Languages are akin to the sacred codes of Sigils in that we cannot translate their original meaning in a fully under-standable manner. Distanced by Time and by Culture we may only approximate and infer their meaning through our modern poetics and learning. Concealed beneath the multitude of the Ancient Symbols there lies the Incommunicable Alphabet - each Invisible Letter expressed through myriads of visible rays like a Star in the Void: a Point of Connection known only by its Perceptible Veils of Light. Existing as both aesthetic signature delineating Beauty Itself and as communicative mnemonic signs, the Hieroglyphic Scripts are one with the Myths in which they are set as Jewels in a Crown. Their original truth is forgotten, and yet is sensed by One whose Heart and Mind holds in reverence the Godhead that is their Very Fount of Inspiration. The Language of the Gods is most suitably understood by means of Symbols and Correspondences. It may thus be grasped by the Initiate in a manner conducive to meditative study and the contemplation of the inter-connectedness of Nature's component aspects. This is the means whereby the Intellect comprehends the Symbolic Articulation of the Magical Cipher:- Whosoever is knowing of the Ritual and Contemplative Paths of Calling-forth the Occult Powers will endeavour to seek the true pronoun-ciation of the Sacred Letters in terms of vocalization. This is most secret and dangerous, for by the Phonic Path of Rhythm, Pitch and Note the Elder Gods are called upon directly. The Secret Tongue lies in the Knowledge of the Pure Sound, Syllabic and Tonal, resonant with the Sacred Letters. The true phonic articulation of the Sigils of Invocation and Evocation is tameless, indomitable and full of fearful passions. For it is the Voice of the Elder Gods themselves - the Birth-pangs of Stars in the Vacuous Womb of the Abyss. It is the Veiy Song of Creation and Destruction. By the motion of the Existent Singularities, by the Circle-dance of the Aethyric Spheres, by the Ordinance of the Paths and by the Angles focus'd in their resonant aspects exterior and interior of mine own Form of Entity the One Sound, the phonic delineation of the Grand Sigil - refracted and having reciprocity upon all levels of the Existent, even the Orison of the Elder Gods - shall be made articulate as Sound; yea, even as the Divine Musick that is of all Nature's Composition. Reified through the Breath of Man it is the Voice of mine own calling unto Thee who art the Ancient One of Spirit. 217"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Invoke ye the Powers of each Letter in its Primary Form - as pure phonic vibration. Concentrate solely upon each Letter in the resonant centres of the physical body. Thus shall ye behold the Entity of each Sacred Letter dwelling within Thee - personified as the Gods and the Goddesses of the Eternal Sabbat's Circle-dance. By their Postures and their Words the Arcana of each Sign shall be disclosed unto Thee, even the countless sub-tleties of their Meanings, Forms and Powers. Contemplate within the Silent Zones of Ekstasis. Walk upon the Serene Point at the centre of the Self-enchanted Delirium of Pleasures. At this Position (and in this Posture) fixate the myriad Apotheoses of Sensation:-In all Feeling sense I sensing Self - in all Selves sense I; the Whole perceive fractionally and by Instants, each an Aeon of Illumination, Eternal and Immediate in Realisation. Locate and fixate all States of Thine Awareness and Thine Entity at their single unifying intersection, that Thy Waking, Sleeping and Dreaming are as One Continuum. In Life as in Death let this Secret be fulfill'd. It is folly to have faith in an eternal struggle towards Perfection as this necessitates an eternal imperfection in order to perpetuate the required aspiration. Therefore realise the Circle of Arte to be the Arena wherein Time is freed from its Mundane Order. For within the Sacred Horizon there is a union of all Aeons in the Present Instant. Within this Ourobouros of Eternity reify the Myth of the Great Dreaming in Ritual and in Spell, and in the Living Flesh its Secrets embody. Thus Our Perfection is made manifest in Momentary Infinities. By Our Oath and Our Blood we infuse Time with the Spate of Our Pleasures at High Sabbat. Of Perspective and Progression: When a magical formula is utilized the Sorcerer walks upon the Mystical Point created thereby. In repeating that formula whilst upon its Point one merely reaffirms its Power. To truly progress one must employ the Point as a Path by means of its resulting for-mulae - those Spells that are born of the initial formula via Dreaming. In employing a system of traditional correspondences in reference to this Work it is wise to remember that a Sacred Letter has specific but not exclusive dominion over certain objects and entities. For example, the First Letter may signify Manifestation via Possession and yet the Twenty-Second Letter signifies Manifestation as a Whole. The Point of each Letter is omnipresent, but is best worked towards through the Subtle Complex of Paths as encoded in a system of correspondences, whether as found in Tradition or as evolved by the Individual Practitioner. 218"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE FORMULAE OF THE FIFTH CELL Being the Aat of the Sixth and the Seventeenth Letters Of the Sacred Alphabet."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"220"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Formulae and Conjurations Of the Sixth Holy Letter THE FORMULA XHNAP (XENAR) Every Star Within is the Seed of a Star Without. Unto every Point of the Stellar Fire there is an inchoate sigillic form within the interior mind-space of the Sorcerer. These latent sigillic structures in turn illuminate the foci of the Stellar Fire with-in the physical body. By the Perfect Alignment of the five senses of the physical body - each sense in its apotheosis - the Sign of the Fivefold Star or Pentagram is formed within the introspective Void of Contemplation, that is, within the Divine Imagination. Thereby the Secret Fivefold Word or Pentagrammaton of the Flesh is uttered; this utterence being the subtle vibration of the body's psycho-sexual centres in resonance with the Magical Current invoked by the specific form of the Inner Star - the Mindful Focus of Summoning irradiating within the Sensorial Matrix of Imagination. At the Heart of the Star Within the Sigils of Invocation and Evocation are held in focus by the lines and angles of the Pentalphic Sign. It is thus that the Living Tradition of the Sorcerer has bound the Circle of Arte in the Fivefold Sign of the Pentagram, that all Power raised therein is aligned by the Sacred Geometry of the Ever-Dawning Star and is concentrated unto the Central Point: the Axis of the Rite and the Arcanum I. In practise the True Signs of Power, although seemingly of your own invention, are facets of the vast and latent complex of the One Sigil that have become illuminated with their resonant energies. The True Signs of Power are resurgent linear graphs of an Eternal Nature: Naught is learnt, but All may be remembered.

It is by such Paths that all Dual Aspects are aligned to permit the manifestation of the Summoned in the Point of the Summoner. Although these Paths of Mediation are numerous and are of many subtle nuances, they are all necessitously mediated in themselves through the senses of the Summoner's own state of Entity, that is, through the Pentagrammaton of the Flesh. There are, therefore, five basic Paths of Mediation. O' Thou Macrocosm of the Pentagrammaton, who art mirror'd in the Micrcosm of the Hand. 0 Thou whose Entity hath its Sigil in the Star ofXenar -Thy spell I utter, in the Tongue Mundane as in the Elder Script of the Gods - that Thy Powers may be summoned in the Fivefold Mystical Word of Living Flesh: the Word whose Letters are the Senses Five, whose pronounciation is revealed through the myriad sensorial con-junctions and permutations, and by whom all Worlds are born. 01 Worlds Innumerable! Thou art made manifest by the Permutations of the Letters and by the Permutations of the Pentalphic Angles; yea, by the Very Gestures of mine own Hand Thou art brought forth to the Eye of mine I! O' Thou Star, whose heart is One beyond the Five! O' Thou who art the Entity of all Perception! Be Thou in mine own senses perfectly aligned - that mine Eye may go forth and have Sight wheresoever I should desire, and that my Hand may reach forth beyond the Horizon of mine Earth-bound Form and Circumstance."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE FIRST LETTER OF THE PENTAGRAMMATON, BEING THE OPTICAL PATH OF MEDIATION. The Optical Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense of Sight. It is attributed to the lower right-hand angle of the Upright Pentalphic Sign and to the smallest finger of the Hand. All that is visible and perceptible unto the Eyes of the Sorcerer, and by an immediate association of Form and Appearance joineth him unto the Invisible Object of his Arte - such doth fall within the Domain of the First Pentagrammatic Letter. Also such sights and visions as do inspire the Sorcerer to the labours of his work, and do invigorate him with passions and with pleasures through the virtue of his Eyes, likewise do they fall within the Domain of the Optical Path. It is important for the Practitioner of the Arte to understand the need for this Path to be strengthened, since it is the swiftest sensory path of con-nection between the Summoner and the Invisible Point of his Conjurations. Therefore consider wisely and select the site of Thy Worship for both its beauty and its desolation. Likewise consider ye the Forms and Appearances of the site's ornamentation and construction; consider ye such sympathies as exist between colours, powers and emo-tions. And also take good heed of Images, Effigies, Signs, Sigils, Banners, Fetish-objects, Robes and Weaponry. Let all such requisites of the Arte be of a Form most striking and fascinating, quick to bind the Eye with awe. THE SECOND LETTER OF THE PENTAGRAMMATON, BEING THE GUSTATORY PATH OF MEDIATION. The Gustatory Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense of Taste. It is attributed to the upper right-hand angle of the Upright Pentalphic Sign and to the ring finger of the Hand. All substances stimulating unto this sense, all foods and wines conse-crated as Sacraments unto the Gods, all elixirs of sensualism, even the heavy incense that invades the mouth - all such things do fall within the Domain of the Second Pentagrammatic Letter. In strengthening this Path of Connection let the Sorcerer feast upon such rare fancies as pleaseth him. Let him taste of fine and exotic foods for the sustenance of his flesh and for the pleasure of his Gods, for do They not eat of the essence and Man of the substance. And for the Spirits of his Wrath and Ire, let him taste of bitter wines and nigh-poisonous herbs. For such will arouse in him yet more of the Warrior's Spirit. Furthermore, let each experiment and devise such feasts as are fitting unto each nuance of Our Worship. 225"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"THE THIRD LETTER OF THE PENTAGRAMMATON, BEING THE AURAL PATH OF MEDIATION. The Aural Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense of Hearing. It is attributed to the uppermost angle of the Upright Pentalphic Sign and to the index finger of the Hand. All that is heard and is perceptible unto the ears of the Sorcerer, and by the power of its sound arouseth in him those feelings and passions reso-nant unto the Object of his Conjurations - all such sounds do fall within the Domain of the Third Pentagrammatic Letter. This Path is perhaps the most arduous and difficult to tread, since it is perhaps the most refined and subtle of the Paths of Mediation. For each Power of the Sorcerer's Conjuration hath a specific phonic vibration, a pitch and a tone with which it hath an especial sympathy; and thus it must fall to the Divine Artistry of the Sorcerer to devise such means as will articulate this Complex Rhythmogrammatic Web of Phonic Nuance in a manner germane unto the circumstance of the Earthly Circle. By the Bell and the Horn let him announce the Summons whereby the Gods are bade to listen. By the Voice let him pronounce the Words of Power which exalt his own heart and call forth the Summoned with Petition and Adjuration, ever availing himself of such Poetic Invocations as are pleasing to Man and the Gods alike. By the Drum and the Rattle let him articulate the Rhythmo-sigillic Paths whereupon his words go forth unto their Object, and upon whose returning echo the Summoned Ones walk forth into the Earthly Circle. Therefore seek ye to master the Voice of Magistry, whose Power hath scope from the nigh-silent whisper unto the Paeon-shout of Command, whose Language encompasseth the Mundane Tongues of the Earth and reacheth unto the Barbarous Grandiloquies of the Gods' own speech! THE FOURTH LETTER OF THE PENTAGRAMMATON, BEING THE OLFACTORY PATH OF MEDIATION The Olfactory Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense of Smell. It is attributed to the upper left-hand angle of the Upright Pentalphic Sign and to the forefinger of the Hand. All such scents and perfumes, whether they be sweet, bitter, harsh or subtle, such as provoke the Heart to remembrance and to ferocity of pas-sion - such do fall within the Domain of the Fourth Pentagrammatic Letter. The Fourth Path of Mediation, in so much as it concerns the Divine Artist, deals with the unique relationship between memories, emotions and specific olfactory stimuli. For is it not so, that a certain smell may invoke an image or a memory buried deep within the mind, and so overcome Thee with the nostalgic re-emergence of emotions. This being so, let the Sorcerer 226"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"concern himself with discovering those scents which co-relate unto the Apotheoses of Sensation and thus link him swiftly unto the emotive nodes of the Continuity of Ekstasis. Thereby he may quickly arouse himself by specific perfumes and incense to intense emotive states, which are most conducive unto the charging of sigils and to that elevated pitch of aware-ness necessary for the success of his conjurations. THE FIFTH LETTER OF THE PENTAGRAMMATON, BEING THE TACTILE PATH OF MEDIATION The Tactile Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense of Touch. It is attributed to the lower left-hand angle of the Upright Pentalphic Sign and to the thumb of the Hand. Within the context of the Sabbatic Mysteries, especially those of the Agapae, the Fifth Path of Mediation mainly concerns the sexual contact between those engaged in the Gestures and Postures of Congress. This contact is not simply the physicality involved in the various modes of coition, but also applies to those subtle magnetic passes of the Hand over the Body of Flesh serving as the Visible Image of Worship; such passes being used to arouse and stimulate the Subtle Bodies of Shadow and Light. The Fifth Path also concerns the physical contact between the Sorcerer and the veiy Earth upon which he walks, for such is the Key unto the Faith beneath the Wanderer's heels. It concerns the Power raised by the simple votive acts of touching and anointing the Effigies of Worship, and the embrace of all such Images and Requisites of Arte whose venerative intimacy with the Hand is most necessary to the Communion of the Invisible with the Visible. THE UNIFYING PATH OF MEDIATION: TELAESTHESIS The Telaesthetic Path of Mediation between the Summoner and the Summoned is the Sense which unifies and yet moves between and beyond the Five Senses of Corporeality. It it attributed to the Central Point of the Upright and Averse Pentalphic Sign and to the Palm of the Hand. The Telaesthetic Path is the Arcanum realised through the Contemplation of the Sacred Principles of Aesthesis. 227"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"A SPELL FOR THE PERMUTATIONS OF THE HAND AND THE STAR By Custom of Lore, I emanate the Essence of the Lightbearer's Star: Upright from the Rais 'd Dextral Hand; Averse from the Rais'd Sinistral Hand.

The Vessel must be so fashioned as to serve as a simulacra of the Kteis and be of a sufficient dimension to accommodate the Phallus in a mimetic act of coition. The Vessel is a fetish-point of alignment unifying the Formulae of Congress and Egress. Its construction and ornamentation should express this according to the Aesthetic Dictates of the Sorcerer and the Famulus. 2) Having constructed the Vessel of the Virgin it is necessary that it should be consecrated and kept pure in readiness for the time of its use. The most suitable invocation to be used in this matter is that of the Fourteenth Holy Letter; this should also be accompanied by an Anointing of the Vessel by the Triple Elixir of the Third Holy Letter, and by the Blessings of Orientation unto the Quarters and the Cross-signing with the Sorcerer's own blood (See Second Cell). These Practices should suffice to consecrate the Vessel unto the Virgin Goddess and to the Powers of the Lunar-Sinistral Current. Further consecrations should follow according to the specific applications and aims of the formula. Having fulfilled the Preparation, Dedication and Consecration of the Vessel it should be kept in a place of darkness away from all sunlight. It should be exposed solely to the light of the Moon, and only then in the appointed times of veneration when all Instruments and Fetishes sacred unto the Moon are cleansed within its light (see The Times of the Covine). 3) The Working Procedure: Upon the first day of the Waxing Moon the Sigil of the Invoked One, or the Chosen Desire, is to be placed within the Vessel as though into the fertile womb of the Earth Itself. The Vessel is then ready for the Act of Congress. The Physical Act of Coitus should be simultaneous with the Psychical Act of ensorcelling the Desire, the latter being accomplished through a concentrated and obsessive sexual phantasy whilst focusing upon the Sigil and its corresponding imageiy. The Sorcerer shall undertake this Psychical Act using various formulae: the Means of Self-Enchantment, the Apotheoses of Sensation, and the Spells of the Sexual Daimon or Lillitu (for the latter see The Ninth Cell). During the intense contemplative state of sexual phantasy it is also pertinent for the Sorcerer to reify the Desire through a concentration upon its corresponding iconography within the context of each of the Four Gestures of the Agapae. 240"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The Charm of the Vessel O' Thou Brazen Vessel, in whom all Legions of Spirits are convoked to minister unto the building of the Royal Temple. 01 Thou Brazen Vessel, in whom the Seed of mine own Blessed Veneiy is spent upon the Egg - from whence all Worlds are born.

The Seed of the Sorcerer is invigorated and enriched through the Self-Enchantment of his Passionate Contemplation. In the Apotheosis of Love the Seed goeth forth into the Womb of the Vessel and therein is united with the Sigillic Ovum of the Desire. The Act of Coition being achieved, the Sorcerer shall add such charms and fetishes into the Vessel as he deems conducive to the fulfilment of the Conjuration.

Upon each night of the Moon's Increase sweet incense and prayers should be offered up unto the Spirit of the Vessel, for thus shall all acts germane unto this Rite wax in their strength in concordance with the Waxing of the Lunar Current - all serving to endow the Entity of the Desire with Form and Life. In the Days of the Moon's Increase let the Sorcerer remain chaste, that his seed shall wax in its vitality and shall be transmuted within him in accordance with the Arcanum concerning the Transmutation of Desire in the Fourth Gesture. 5) Upon the Night of the Moon's Fullness depart ye with the Vessel to some lonely place, and cast the Spell of the Circle about Thyself and the Vessel. Within that Circle arouse Thyself with all the fervour that hath waxed mightily within Thee in the days of the Moon's Increase. Raise ye the Invocations and the Conjurations of the Vessel unto the Zenith, being diligent to focus all power upon the Sigil of the Desire. Invoke! - Until Thou art felled by the natural hand of exhaustion. Invoke! - Until the Seed of Thy Waxing Passions is poured forth as a liba-tion upon the Earth.

Thus the Sigil/Entity returneth unto the Prototypical Image of Itself, there-in to be empowered with the Primal Initiating Current of all Entity, even as it is focused and channelled through its own atavistic nature. Having descended into the Underworld, going forth into the Place of the Dead as a Messenger of the Sorcerer, it recovers the forgotten heritage of Our Cultus. 8) As the Moon is reborn from the Darkness, so the Entity of Desire aris-es from the Dead, and that which wast asleep or lost with the Ancestors' Passing Away will be remembered and will be known unto Thee. The Wisdom and the Powers of the Old Ones shalt be Thine. Yet Thou shalt not be overcome or possessed beyond Thy Will's Intent, for the Spirit is most assuredly bound unto the Vessel. At each New Moon pour forth libations upon the Place of the Vessel's burial to propitiate the Spirit there residing. For that Spirit shall whisper unto Thee in Dreams and serve Thee well as a Familiar. Through frequent offerings the Vessel shall become a Place of the Earth's menstruation - an Hallowed Gateway of the Telluric Currents, and may thus be consulted as a True Oracle of the Goddess.

For the member of which they had carnal knowledge was not of mortal flesh, but was fashioned of stone or clay, and was consecrated as the Veiy Phallus of Our Horn'd God, the Deval. Such artificial phalli are often a part of a larger effigy of the God, and are removed for the purposes of the fertility and sexual rituals. The artifi-cial phallus is used within a C ovine by the Man in Black as part of his rit-ual adornment; in this guise of the Horn'd God he may satisfy all women of the Covine more ably than any mere man. Alternatively the Fetish of the Stone God is employed by the Solitaiy Witch as the Brother and Husband-fetish of the Ever-Virgin Vessel. 1) Construction: Let the Form of the Image be that of a Phallus, and of a dimension suitable for mimetic acts of coition, and yet also of a size like unto the member of a beast, so as to give the sensation of a masculine presence beyond that of mortal men. Let it be wrought of Stone or Clay, or better it is if it be found under the guidance of Thy Famulus. The Image should also be hollow, so that it may contain the Sigils and Fetish-objects sacred unto the Masculine Power. 2) Having fashioned the Image, it is necessaiy for it to be consecrated and dedicated unto the Power of the God. The Image should be consecrated at the height of the Sun's strength using such Conjurations as that of the Fifteenth Holy Letter. It should also be blessed by Acts of Orientation unto the Quarters and by a Cross-signing with the Sorcerer's own blood. These acts being completed, let the Image be concealed in darkness until such time as it is needed. Ideally, the Image should be made in the brightest hours of the Day and should be concealed from the light of the Moon until such times of ritual requisition, for then in due season it may be revealed aright 'neath the beam of Selene's beauty. 3) Use: The uses of the Stone God are not so strictly defined by a work-ing procedure as the Ever-Virgin Vessel, but rather it has a number of spe-cific applications :-244"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"(i) As upon the Besom let the Witch ride the Stone God in the Hour of her Lust; and let it be smear'd with the Devil's Salve, that in her swooning she should be borne aloft unto the Dream of the Sabbat as upon an Incubus-Horse. Indeed, let her firstly conjure the Sexual Genii into the Stone Phallus by means of Incantation and by the placing of Sigils within its hol-low interior. By this means she may engender a Familiar Spirit that will save as her mount unto the Nocturnal Revels of the Cult; and that Spirit will oft1 come unto her, even unannounced within her sleep, and therein will call her forth unto the Summons of her God and her Brethren. (ii) Within the Covine the Stone Phallus may serve as the fetish uniting simultaneously the masculine energies of all men within the circle, and thus it may serve as the Veiy Phallus of the God wherewith the Witch-Queens may perform the Rites of Congress. In such Rites the Image should contain a little of the Seed from the Covine's men (spilt as the fruition of magical acts wherein they didst invoke the Powers of the God into their bodies), and also such Sigils of the Invoked God to bind all unto the One-Pointedness of Desire. When all is within the Image, let the Whole be sealed firmly with wax. By means of the Image the Witch-Queens may focus the Powers and Gestures of the Agapae within abortive and mimetic acts of coition, and by such means they may refine the Children of the Covine's Power - its Desires, Beliefs and Intents - upon a subtle etheric level prior to physical conception via the Normative Gesture of Congress. By this Sorceiy the Entities of those Children born of the Sacred Marriage betwixt the God and the Witch-Queens are summoned and, as Dreams-made-flesh, are reified within the Earthly Circle of Arte. By this Sorceiy we may incarnate the Powers of the Purest Magick and yet by the same path we may give substance unto the Veiy Creatures of Abomination. (iii) Alone, or within the Covine, the Image may serve as the Active Partner of the Sodomite; that is, it may be used to sodomise oneself or one's brethren. The function of such an Act/or Acts is to transmute the subtle essence of a Desire via a Transubstantiative and/or Abortive Gesture of Congress, and as such this application may be incorporated within the context of the two techniques detailed previously. Elsewise this method may be used by a Sorcerer to invoke within himself a Succubus and within the Stone Image an Incubus, and thus by some phantasy to reify a Dream of his Othemess within the Female Form. In this fashion it may be used by the male witches to aid the subtle manipulations of Desire and Belief undertaken by their female counterparts. 245"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"(iv) Upon a Day when the Moon is full and the Sun hath not yet set, both shining brightly as twins in Heaven (Or in the Hours of Twilight when neither the Sun nor Moon are visible, yet their light doth illumine the Earth a little beyond darkness) - at such a Time let the Sorcerer perform the Sacred Marriage of the Goddess and God, the Sun and the Moon, through the Vicegerency of their Powers within the Twin Vessels.

This Arcanum transcends the Principles of Affinity, Syncretism and Reciprocity, to unite even the disparate and the opposing aspects within the Field of the Sorcerer's Work. It is to be employed to give an overall cohesion to the many different facets of Theoiy and Practice, and also to obtain an equilibrium between those facets (in the same manner as in the Normative Application of the Second Gesture of Congress). It may also be used to fixate all the facets upon a single visible point - such as a Star, Effigy or Glyph. ORISON AND AESTHESIS The Apparent Meaning of a Word lies in the relationship between its Object and its Concept as realised through the re-cognitive familiarity learnt through Profane Culture and Worldy Education. Seek ye the origin of the relationship between the World, the Hand and the Eye, between Signs, their Objects and their Concepts. To do this, Perception must be purified; this is to be attained through the Contemplation of Aesthesis. The Truth of a Word lies in its automatic resonance with noumenal and perceptual imagery. By repeated pronounciation a Word is de-familiar -ized: it becomes free from its Apparent Meaning and becomes Sound. This Sound has specific internal resonances within the Psyche and in the Sigillic construct of our innate linguistic complex. By the Contemplation of the One Sound (the Totality of the Cipher's Phonic Articulation) the Arcana of its component tonalities are realised. A Mantra is a Sacred Formula of Words uttered repetitiously to transmute the Reciter via specific vibration. Certain vibrations of sound have reso-nance with divine powers and god-forms, and thus are deemed suitable as Words of Continuous Prayer: Mantric Orison. By the Inward Mental Vibration or Outward Verbal Utterence of such Formulae the Sorcerer is in direct resonance with the powers embodied by his speech. Thus, by his own Word, he is the Perpetual Re-Creator of Himself. Every Tonal Component of Language is an Hypostasis of the One Sound. The One Sound is the Orison of the Alogos - the Primal Vibration whence all Being came into Existence. The One Sound has its Point of Focus in the Heart of the Sabbatic Circle. This Point, being transcendent of mundane position, is fixated simultaneously upon the Stars, Sigils, Gods, et alia res-onant unto the Sorcerer's Will, Desire and Belief. Let Thine Hand and Eye radiate from the One Point of this Arcanum. 247"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"ZSA-TZAI: THE CHANT OF OFFERING UNTO THE SUN Behold!

Oft' have the Arcana of the Sabbat been mask'd in the guise of Evil Gods' Work. 'Neath an Iconostasis of Blasphemy Our Cultus will lie concealed. Thus whisp'reth the Daimon, so saith the Scribe! THE ICONOSTASIS OF BLASPHEMY In employing the Formulae of Self-Enchantment it is vital that the Sorcerer and Divine Artist possesses Knowledge of all that he hath set his faith in, for it is in the Power of Belief to shape and control the Universal Magical Agent of the Azoth. In order for him to maintain a firm grasp of the Magical Energies of the Quintesential Current it is of utmost importance that he believes nothing that is not conducive to his Work, also that he uti-lizes all Belief, however seemingly useless or contrary to his purposes. All Belief hath utility unto One that is knowing of the Cipher of the Forms within the Azoth - these being the Azoetic Icons - the Vessels wherein the Power of Faith is contained. The Wise, in knowing of both the Creation and the Iconoclasm of these Forms, may utilize all methods of Worship -Sacred and Profane - to draw upon their Power. The Initiate may walk unseen in all Temples, his Voice at one with all Worshippers, for by the Universal Nature of his Wisdom all Symbols of the Spirit may be transmuted into the Form of the One Sigil. It is thus that He may veil himself in an Iconostasis of Blasphemy - inverting those Symbols of the Outer and Profane Belief that they should serve as the Sigils of the Opposer - who is Our True God. THE POSITIVE FORMULA OF THE ICONOSTASIS WHEREBY THE METHODS OF PROFANE WORSHIP SHALL SERVE AS VEILS AND SYMBOLS FOR OUR SECRET WORSHIP The Wise, in knowing of the Elder Gods that were before the Embodied Race of Man, have fashioned Idols of Wood, Stone and Thought for the Profane to worship, that in the Universal Magical Agent of the Azoth there should be formed Great Icons and Houses of Power to serve the Wise and their own Hidden Gods. Thus have the Wise fashioned idols - gods in the Perfect'd Likeness of Man and the Desires of Man, that in Self-Worship Man empower his own Perfection of Form and Entity according to the Will of the Great Work. For thus shall the Flesh become the Perfect Mediator of the Spirit upon Earth. The Prayers of the Profane being fashioned unto this purpose, albeit unknowingly, shall serve the Wise in such times when it is prudent for Our Cult to remain hidden. 255"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Yet beware! For the Profane in their folly shall seek Thee out as the Enemy and as the Servants of the Devil. Even though the Wise have themselves oft' forged the Worthiest Icons of Profane Faith for the furtherance of the Mortal State, the Profane will yet arise in their arrogance and their fear against us. Thus it is that at certain times there arise religions and faiths that condemn Our Ancient Cultus; because of their misunderstanding of Our Wisdom they shall seek to destroy Our Work. Indeed, it is the seem-ing threat to their own faith and their fear of Our Knowledge, born as it is through the Pride of their Mortal Ignorance, that drives them to perse-cute the Craft of the Wise. Yet, as if guided by some Secret Will, Our Arte hath ever sought to make timely opportunity of such persecution - trans-forming it into a means by which the Wise may test themselves. For unto the True Sorcerer this is a challenge unto his Cunning! Knowing of Belief and its control by Self-Enchantment and by Sigils, he will employ the structure of the offending belief system as a series of Glyphs. As such beliefs will be contrary unto his own purposes they can in no way con-sciouly contain or represent his ideas, and thus like certain sigils they may be used as a Cipher of Opposition to draw upon the Powers within the Icons of his own Secret Worship. Thus the Sorcerer may take opportunity to realise the Transmutable Nature of Belief, and also to protect his own kin of Witch-blood, utilizing the beliefs of their would-be persecutors, and concealing the Charms of the Wise in the Prayers of the Foolish. THE NEGATIVE FORMULA OF THE ICONOSTASIS WHEREBY THE INVERSION OF THE METHODS OF PROFANE WORSHIP SHALL SERVE AS VEILS AND AS SYMBOLS FOR OUR SECRET WORSHIP Through the veiling of his Charms in the Prayers of the Foolish, the Sorcerer maketh himself susceptible unto the weakening influences there-of. Despite his Wisdom and his Cunning of Belief he is vulnerable unto such obsessions as are born of the slavery to faith - for such is the error of all Profane Worship. Likewise he is vulnerable unto the influences of Profane and Temporal Culture, for such may taint and imbalance the Sacred Principles of Aesthesis that govern the Hand and the Eye, and thus may he fall unto the Common States of Mortal Perception. Therefore it is most wise that if he hath employed the Positive Iconostasis as a veil of his Knowledge, he should likewise employ the Negative Iconostasis as its Equilibrium. Thereby he shall use the Inversion of the Profane Icons as a Cipher of Opposition to draw upon their Power and thus redirect it accordingly, as is his Desire."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Likewise the Inversion of the Vulgar Rites shall re-align within Thy psy-che all imbalancing influences of Belief and Perception, and thus achieve the Rectification of the Sacred Aesthesis and Enchantment. This is not the simple act of rebellion, but rather the precise devaluation of Profane Belief to obtain release from its effects, and thus to maintain the Equilibrium and the One-Pointedness of Will, Desire and Belief upon the Chosen Path of the Practitioner. And in such Times when the concealment of Our Cultus is of no avail, it shall serve us to cast forth an Image of Evil unto the Profane, that in dread and horror they shall recoil and hinder us not. SEVENTH CELL FORMULA OF AESTHESIS I The Divine Artist must be aware of such beliefs as will confine, distort or condition the Sacred Principles of Aesthesis. He must turn to his own advantage those beliefs that offend in this matter and make full use of such faith as is contrary unto his own. By incorporating the reversal or 'Blasphemy' of a belief-structure into his own rites he overthrows its past or potential ability to establish any automatic and conditioned aesthetic response - such as may hinder or obstruct his Work. He may thus empty a belief of its value and fashion the 'Evil' of his Blasphemy into the Sanctity of 'Ritual-Sigils', thus to employ the belief as he wishes. It is therefore important to differentiate 'twixt the Mundane and the Sacred Strategies of Perception; that is, between:-1. The inconstant and artificial social/cultural values that dictate that which may be 'beautiful' and when it may be so. (As with beauty so with all degrees of aesthetic or moral worth); and... 2. The sempiternal values forming the Principles of Magical Aesthesis which constantly seek to locate the Foci of Uninhibited Affinity with all Nature, thus to establish the Paths by which the Artist may attain unto Divine Ekstasis. Let the first means be known and be transformed unto the second. For in transcending all Mundane Beauty or Ugliness, one may attain unto Divine Ekstasis and find therein the inherent value of all Sensation, ever refining the subtle nuances thereof unto their Secret Apotheoses. Let the Sorcerer master the Alchemy of the Transmutation of his own senses - from the Leaden Perception of common and transitory value into the Golden Illumination of the Divine Telaesthetic Path, even unto the Light Eternal of Ekstasis. 257"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"FORMULA OF AESTHESIS II By an Averse Communion, an Apostasy to Nature, the Adept enters Heavens unimagined by Gods or Men.

It is folly to suppose that the Black or the White Mass is of greater importance, it is but the Power enslaved in them that must be freed - the Power of their Belief that must be utilized and aligned unto Our Path. It is also folly to pretend that the Christ hath had no sway in this Land, that Power hath stained deep, but it runneth not so deep as the Power of the Old Cunning Man.

Endeavour to seek the True Rectification of all that hath had influence upon the Body of Perception, that Thou mayest embrace all Nature in fearless affinity, without aught of that stain of guilt. Examine your Cunning Skill, all Ye Blessed and Wise, for if there be Sin then it is in the limitation of Thine own Awareness. Accursed are They who in seeking the Secret of Rectification merely enslave themselves in Contraries of Good and Evil. Know ye the Arcanum and its Time of Need, but look ever to the Way of the Sorcerer's True Arte - that which is beyond the Common Believing of the Clay of Man in the Clay of God. Remember those Powers that were before Thee and Thy Mortal Form. Remember Those that are the Initiators of Witchblood and know not our Mortal Form as Men and as Women. Therefore strive beyond the circumstance of Thine Earthen Image. Beware! For the Profane shall call Thee \"Legion, the Children of Rebellion\", and their Fires, Fetters and Tortures shall pursue Thee if Thou art not diligent unto secrecy. Therefore hide Our Arcana in the Tongue of the Cipher, 'neath veils upon veils of Meaning and Sign. Fear not! Our Arte cannot be vanquished nor overcome, for it is Nature's own heart and strength of Spirit."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"FURTHER ADMONITIONS AND COUNSEL The Arcana of the konostasis of Blasphemy and the Work of the Rectification do not apply solely to those Lands or Peoples 'neath the Christian Powers, but are employed in all Places where vanity of Faith and the Slavery thereto hath sought to deny the Ways of the Elder Worship -wherein is the Sanctuary of the Hand and the Eye. Whether known by (he names used herein or not, the Perfected Arcana of the Sabbat are Principles of the Arte Magical Universal and Infinite. The Names used herein are drawn from the Tradition as I have walked within it. It is folly indeed to attempt to extinguish the Torch 'twixt the Horns of Our God, to seek to destroy Our Ancient Cultus, since it is not only a Tradition passed on through successive generations by Word of Mouth and Initiations; in its true essence it is passed on metempsychotically and via secret means of psychic induction. For if none were left alive to prac-tise Our Arte, then someone would be bom soon enough. Traditions may keep alive the Symbology embodying the Essential Principles of the Arte Magical in Ritual Form, Art and Doctrine, even when these Principles are not understood or even known of, yet this would not diminish the practical value of Our Sacred Rites. For those who desire the Pleasures of the High Sabbat yet are not bom with the Gift to enter therein by the Power of their Dreams, let such assimilate its Reality via Rituals. Let such as aspire in this manner employ the Three Rites of Ingress, Congress and Egress, together with such Formulae of the Eleven Aats as may be of use, ever with diligence unto their Intent and ever atten-tive unto the Times of the Moon and Stars. It is the purpose of the Azoetic Grimoire to transmit certain of the afore-said Essential Principles - the patterns underlying all Magick and encrypt-ing the Universality of Belief, in order that they may illuminate and con-tribute to the Workings of Our Ancient Cultus of Sorcery. For the Aim of Our Sacred Rites is to reify the Primal Dream of the High Sabbat on the Earth; to incarnate the Abstraction of the Whole I in the Present 'Self. Few are they that may enter the Most Secret Conclave of the Primordial Dreaming whence all Sacred Myths have sprung and whence all Traditions of Our Arte do issue forth. Yea, few are they that may enter that Place which standeth beyond all Time - call'd \"The High Sabbat of the Ages\". Yet many shall share in its Joy by the celebration of its Mystery in Rite and Sacred Drama; and perchance, as though passing through some hidden door, that which is the Dream shall be most real, and all shall abide in the Bliss of Our Lady and Our Lord at High Sabbat-tide."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE ICONOSTASIS OF THE INFERNAL SABBAT Iolebeb Etse Sakeh Sakeh By the Prayers of the False Lord spoken against the Sun I veil the Hymns unto the Shadow, I conceal the Adorations of Those Hidden Within.

THE FORKED STAVE: ITS USES AND SYMBOLISM The Fork'd Stave serveth as the Grand Reposoire of the Sabbatic Deity. It is the fetishistic representation of Our Grand Master, of whose Spirit it is the Sceptre of Divine Authority. Therefore it is borne by the Presiding Devil or Visible Master of Our Rites. Furthermore, if there is no one present to serve as the Visible Image of the Horn'd God, or in such times when none are deemed worthy to don the Mask of the God, then it must needs be that another Image will serve as the Icon of the Sabbatic Cultus: the Straight Stave of the Magister's Authority, fork'd at its head like unto the horns of the Old One. As the Crooked Wand serveth for the Ophidian Spirit, so the Fork'd Stave serveth for the Horned Spirit, whose Totems are the Great Upright Goat, the Sacrificial Ram and the White Stag of the Great Wild Hunt. The Chosen Stave may be fashioned of different woods according to the intent of the Rites in which it is to be employed. The Knowledge con-cerning the type of wood to use is best leamt by the counsel of one's guide, one's famulus, or through the Conjuration of the Diyadic Spirits that dwell in all the Greenwood's Kin.

All Initiates of the Covine shall light a candle therefrom as a True Sign of their Honour and Reverence unto the Source of all Light.

In studying its verses, or even by attaining unto its Vision for oneself, it will be observed that circumambulating the Great Circle - the Map of Possibility - are Four Figures. The symbolism and interpretation of this aspect of the Initiating Vision is the basis of the following formulae. The Vision in itself is to be attained through the Recitation of the Sacred Formulae at the True Cross'd-Roads, and is bestowed by the Highest Initiating Powers of the Sabbatic Mysteries. Within its splendour and spectacle the Four Figures circumambulating the Circle are each seen ' to pass through four transformations, which, in anthropomorphic terms, may be designated:- Father, Mother, Son, and Daughter. From this interpretation we obtain a basic fourfold expression of Human Entity, the totality of which has its focus and equilibrium in the Incarnate Vessel of the Sorcerer. The four transformations represent the fourfold extension of the Point of Spirit into the Cross of Matter, and thus symbolize, in anthropomorphic terms, the Manifest Forms adopted by the Sorcerer in the circumambulation/ensorcellment of his own Entity. The symbolism of the Four Figures is directly correspondent with the Symbol of the Fourfold Elemental Sphinx and with the Four Letters of the Sabbatic Tetragrammaton, similiarly the revolution of the figures is the symbolic corollary of the cycles and permutations of the many symbols and formulae operative within, and aligned unto the Sacred Quaternary of the Tetragrammatic Gestures. From the One Point, whereupon the Perfect'd Sphinx is exalted; From the One Point, whereupon the Perfect'd Sorcerer walks; From the One Point, the Focus of the Grand Alignment of all Spells, Rites and Formulae of the Arte Magical; From the One Point, the Very Centre of the Circle of the High Sabbat of the Wise - there issue the Four Greater Emanations of the Cross'd Roads and therein are the Powers of the Sacred Tetragrammaton. In the Spaces betwixt the Four Greater Emanations are the Four Lesser Emanations, wherein are the Secrets of the Revolution of the Sacred Quaternary and the Transmutation of its Powers throughout the Twenty-two Clavicles of the Cipher. 294"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Four Greater Emanations of the Perfect'd Sorcerer's Entity are Four Bodies of Magical Power. These embody the permutations and alignments of the Powers of Zoa and Azoa, which are in themselves attained in the Sorcerer's Passing through the Sinistral and Dextral Gates of the Great Double House and by his indwelling within the Continuum of Ensorcellment that binds the Circle of all Possibilities. Unto the Vision of Man the Four Great Aspects are the Watchers invoked at the Quarters of the Earthly Circle. They are symbolised and are dreamt of as Anthropomorphic and Totemic Archetypes which embody the specialisations, facets and combinations of those Powers constituting the Horizon of the Sorcerer's Vision of Nature as a Whole, that is, they express the Four Elements as personified and symbolised in Deific and Totemic Forms, and as made manifest with both Directional and Chronological significance. The Four Lesser Emanations are the Non-modal States of Power whereby the Transformation of the Four Greater Bodies is achieved. They bridge the spaces between the Four Quarters, and facilitate the Transmutation of One Form or Power to another, and thus have domin-ion over the circumambulatory continuum of the Sabbat.

Such iconography may be realised through the concentration and deliberate obsession of its Apotheosis of Sensation within Ritualistic Sexual Reverie; that is, through contemplative phantasies of intense emotionalism involving the specific imagery of a Sacred Letter, the Divine Artist will interact with that Letter's abstract energies through the mediation of their personification as Sexual Entities. The Acts of the Sabbatic Orgia incarnate the Powers of the Sacred Alphabet, the Postures thereof are the Bodily Receptacles resonant unto the Divinities of Our Elder Worship:- By Magical Postures I am become the Unplaced Shrine of the Dancing Gods. By my Carnal Rosaiy of Silent Prayer, whose twenty-two beads are graven with Phantasies of Love, I am become the Entirety of the Sexual Daimon. With but one telling of the Rosaiy, Forty-four Spirits of Lillitu -Twenty-two Incubi and Twenty-two Succubi - shall flock unto my side. Between my Self and these Othernesses of Love there is but a Single Ecstasy throughout a Sacrament of Countless Pleasures. The Sexual Daimon, or Lillitu, is the Corpus and the Continuum of the Sum Sexual Entity of the Sacred Alphabet. Its Forms are specific unto each Letter and by Tradition are primarily dual in nature; that is, the Sexual Genius of each Letter may be personified as both Incubus and Succubus, and may be interacted with as either, according to the predilection of the Sorcerer. The Sexual Genii act as the Points of Transmutation and Mediation between the personal sexual iconography of the Sorcerer and the mystical iconography of the Grand Sabbatic Orgia as it is witnessed within the Cells of the Azoth. The imageiy of each Letter and Sexual Genius must be individually evolved and refined in the light of one's personal predilec-tions and tastes, and yet must also be studied in the light of one's visions and dreams of the Sabbatic Arcana. The Operation of the Sexual Genii is to unite and mediate between the subjective or Self-Sexuality of the Sorcerer and the objective Sexual Arcana of the Sorcery itself. It is thus, within the Circle of the Earthly Sabbat, that the Sexual Genii are to be invoked during the Seventh Stage of the Rite - therein to attend upon the Adepts in their Formulae of Congress.

OF THE PERPETUATION OF THE SACRED LINEAGE OF WITCHBLOOD 1) Through the Initiated Body of Adepts:-Knowing of the Visible and the Invisible Tides of Star, Sun and Moon let the Wise convene in their Circle. Knowing of the Secret Signs, Calls and Alignments let them invoke. Let Cunning Man and Wise Woman call upon all such Powers as they themselves would incarnate, and would con-sequently unite in the Flesh of a Child. The Fire of the Ancient One shall enter the Clay of Man, and the Spirit of Our Lady, the Goddess, shall pos-sess the Body of the Woman. Knowing of the Vessels, Gestures, Postures and Secrets of Congress, let Man and Woman as God and Goddess unite in Love at the Circle's Centre. Throughout the term of the Priestess' pregnancy it is customary that She should reign over the Circle and be deemed as its Queen, regardless of her degree. She should be present at each Rite of the Full Moon if She is so able; and therein She and her unborn Child should be adored as the Living Creatrix. Likewise the father should be given such honour as is due unto the True Father of the Gods. And at the Time of the Child's Coming forth, be it day or night, then there should be such Joy and Ceremony as befits the birth of a True Child of the Elder Gods. 2) Through the Ministry of the Lillitu:-When a person in dreaming should be aroused in lust and dream of car-nal union with an aspect of the Lillitu - it appearing unto them as the Veiy Object of their Desire - and in dreaming or in sudden waking should cleave unto their Bedfellow, even though they both be but of the Common Clay, then shall the Child born of that sudden link 'twixt the Daimon and 318"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"the Clay be deemed a True Child of the Wise. Thus shall that Child be truly blest with much succour and with such gifts and talents as are bestowed by the Spirits of the Agapae. Thus may the Soul of an Adept find a passage unto incarnation through the carnal union of the Profane -swooping as an Hawk in a Dream of Lust upon the sleeping bodies of Man and Woman; that in their somnambulistic coition they shall be as Incubi and Succubi unto each other, as Twin Aspects of the Sexual Genius by which the Adept's Soul is transmitted. Thus shall the Blessed and the Wise find incarnation amid the Brood of Eve by the Dreaming of the Vessel as Lilith. Where the Physical Line of Witchblood is broken this method is of necessitous use for the perpetuation of Our Sacred Lineage through the Body of Human Entity. CONCERNING MATTERS OF CONGRESS The Heterosexual act of Congress is the act of synthesis between the Primal Duality of the Male and Female: the Self assimilating its Otherness through the contrary of its own sexuality. Zoa-Azoa / Azoa-Zoa. The Homosexual act of Congress is an auto-sexual act within the extend-ed field of a single sexuality; it is a Soliloquy of Self-Love between the Self and its Otherness within a single sexual energy. Zoa-aoZ / Azoa-aozA. The I-Sexuality transcends and encompasses these twin formulae: the Self freely assimilating its Othemess in all Possibilities by the establishment of new affinities through the continual integration of the Selfs aversions into the Self. Thus, as with all Nature, the Primal Sexuality is the Eternal Equilibrium of Difference. OF VAMPYRIC CONGRESS By the Sexual Genius of the Vampyre Thou mayest avail Thyself of great strength in the time of Thine own weakness. Even in the hour of blind exhaustion when Thou art nigh unto the abyss of oblivion, fall not unto unthinking sleep nor rehearse Thou the falsehoods of common death. By Thine Arte call Thou upon such Spirits as Thou hast bound unto Thy will in the Great Enchantment, call Thou upon those Spirits which are sworn unto Thee by virtue of Thine own sacrifice in the Arcana of Egress. And thus, letting these Spirits possess Thy Body, Thou shalt go forth amid the Many and the Profane to gather the Feast of Blood and Souls for Thy Self and Thy Servitors' Needs. Even amid the Brethren of the Wise Thou mayest avail Thyself of the Genius of the Vampyre to rectify the equilibrium of those Powers which may overwhelm them in the Summoning of the Ancient Ones. 319"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"O1 Thou Genius of the Vampyre, who art veil'd in the Iconostasis of Curse and Blasphemy! 0 Thou Genius of the Vampyre, who art bound unto me by the Covenant of mine own Sacrifice in the Great Enchantment of Death!

And so, in Life as in Death, all Entity shalt know Thy Secret Touch: Thy Perpetual Births and Resurrections in the Self-Pantheon of I. As Thy Flesh lieth in the Sleep of Thanatos let Thy Priestess or Priest come unto Thee and proceed to arouse Thee sexually, yet ever being dili-gent not to awaken Thee. She shall seek coition with Thee, chanting such Words of Power as to summon in Thee the Great Dreams of Magick.

Upon Thy Belief bestow Freedom through the Sabbat's Reveliy and through that Natural Tabu which the Hand and the Eye dictate, for such is Faith beyond all understanding - it is tempered by that Love which is Pure unto the I-Sexuality. Restrain Belief to the mould of Thine Adored Icon, be it of Flesh, Clay or of Linear Form - it thus hath intensity sufficient to Realisation. The value of a Belief lies in its sufficiency to realise. Hesitate not to embrace the Adored Icon through uninhibited attraction.

THE AESTHETICISM OF BELIEF II Do not believe a thing because you think it to be true, but to make it so. Sorcery is the Precise Arte aimed at the refinement and attainment of Complete Awareness: Affinity with all Nature. Sorcery uses Will, Desire and Belief with such precision as is permitted by the talents of the Individual Practitioner to achieve this aim via a complex and subtle Cipher of Primal Interconnectedness. All Profane Systemologies of Thought ape its techniques, yet with a view to verifying that which by its very nature may only be subdy inferred. The Profane believe because they consider themselves to know the Truth, to thus maintain a stasis in their Believing. Profane Philosophy: The First Premise is Presumption; The Second is the Inference of that initial Presumption; The Third Premise ad infinitum, will inevitably contain an element of Truth. Sacred Philosophy: The Cipher by which all Truth is implied by necessity. One may only approximate that which by nature is more refined than the language in which we seek to define it. By the Cipher of the Sacred Alphabet the Wise have sought to overcome this problem. What is the Cipher? It is the Universal Alphabet whose Letters are the Singularities of Transmutation - Abstract Points existing at all levels of Existence and interconnected by Affinities as determined by Pure Aesthesis. What is Pure Aesthesis? It is the Innocence of the Dove spoken with the Wisdom of the Serpent. It is the Silence of the Babe articulated and refined according to the Knowledge of the Sorcerer; that is, it is the freely-associating sentience and the intimate contact of the Senses with all Nature. Beyond the aesthetic values of Profane and Temporal Culture, it is Beauty as it is, not as it is learnt."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Where do the Points of Universal Transmutation exist? Wherever the Powers of your Will, Desire and Belief place them. There is mutual attraction between an Aatic Singularity and the Focal Point of Will. One appears to locate the Point by Will, but it is the T locating the Point of 'Self: Of such things the Truth cannot be known as it is not knowable' in any conventional manner of conception. The Perfected Embodiments will, and have, by manifesting the Flesh of the Sabbatic Archetype, given a voice to the Unknowable. Such is the purpose of the Oracles given by the Wise throughout the Ages. You may grapple with Sorcery by theory alone - it will be a lonely defeat! THE SACRED FETISHES In the Fetishism of the Primal lies the Eden of Sorcery, so saith Our Daimon, so writeth the Scribe, so dwelleth the Hand of the Sorcerer amid the Idols of Eternity. The Sacred Fetishes are those Objects which serve as the Physical Places of Repose for the diverse Spirits and Powers employed by the Sorcerer. They are the Points of Mediation betwixt the Spirit and the Flesh, and in any interaction with a Spirit the Sorcerer should treat its fetish as being of the same single identity as that Spirit - thus emphasizing the fetish-object as the Visible Image of an Invisible Power or Entity. Pure Love unto the Fetishes of the Cultus is verily as blest as the Worship before the Adored One's True Likeness: Devotion unto each aspect of the Adored One's Alignments is of One Identity with the Devotion before its Visible Presence and Entity. The Fetish, by its form, constitution and hue, suggests the nature of the Spirit or Power which occupies it and which is mediated through it, and thus, by an immediate association via the Hand and the Eye, the Object has Identity with its Tutelary. Aught that hath a sufficient attraction and fas-cination unto the Hand and Eye may serve as a Fetish, subject to the Auspices and Tabu of the Spirits and Powers ofMagick."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"THE GREATER FETISHES The Greater Fetishes are those Sacred Objects which serve as the Vessels and Channels for specific Powers of Sorcery - the primary examples of these being the Elemental Weapons and the Vessels of the Three Rites. 1. The Wand, being the Fetish-object used to direct the Secret Fire of the Spirit and the Mundane Fire within the Earthly Circle of Arte, is the instrument employed in the manipulation of the Austral Path of Power emanating to-and-from the One Point of a Rite or Formula. There is a Tradition regarding the Wand: it should be given unto Thee and its Power transmitted unto Thee by the Hand of the One that is Thy Teacher. If Thou art without a Living Guide then the Famulus will indi-cate the materials to be used and the precise manner and times of the Wand's construction and consecration. 2. The Cup, being the Fetish-object of the Mystical Waters of the Agapae and the Vessel of the Mundane Waters of Libation used in the Earthly Circle of Arte, is employed in the manipulation of the Occidental Path of Emanation to-and-from the One Point of a Rite or Formula. There is a Tradition regarding the Cup: it is to be given unto Thee by One who doth love Thee in all truth of heart. 3. The Dagger, being the Fetish-object used to direct and channel the Powers of the Aethyr and to control the Mundane Element of Air, is employed to manipulate the Oriental Path of Emanation to-and-from the One Point of a Rite or Formula. 4. The Pentacle, being the Fetish-object of the Sacrament of the Agapae and the Mediator between the Centre and the Circumference of the Sorcerer's Vision of Nature, is employed to manipulate and to bind the Borean Path of Emanation to-and-from the One Point of a Rite or Formula. 5. The Vessels of Egress: The Clay Jars employed in the Rites of Egress and in the Formulae of the Iconoclasm are the Fetish-objects of the Fourfold Death at the Sabbatic Crossroads. They are the Mediating Points of the Four Elements as invoked within the Dominion of the God - who is Death Itself - and thus 'neath his Power do they serve as the Places of Repose for the Shades of the Dead that are of the Blessed and the Wise. The Vessels of Egress contain the elemental constituents of the Corpse, which is in Itself the Grand Fetish of the Initiation of Death, the Symbol and the Sacrament of the Sum Flesh of the Millions of Forms-of-Being. Thus the Sacrifice of the Vessels obtains the Power and the Mastery of All that is Existent and granteth the release from the limitations thereof. 329"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Although the Divine Artist may use many diverse and different types of each instrument, the Four Elemental Weapons are principally the Physical Mediators of the Four Paths of the Sabbatic Crossroads. Likewise the Four Vessels and their Doubles used in the Rite of Egress are the fetishes of the Four Elemental States of the Physical Body and of the Bodies of Light and of Shade - even as in the Arcanum of the Octriga. They thus function as the Mediators of the Mystical Crossroads in the Heights as in the Depths, even as the Divine Messengers of the Empyrean, Earthly and Infernal Domains, e'er rising and falling upon the Triple-Axis - upon whose Point and Cross the Sorcerer doth take the True Oath of Witchblood. The distinction between the Greater and Lesser Fetishes is not a strict divi-sion since an object may be the reposoire of a specific aatic genii or the deified personification of a Power, and thus be of both types - a Power-fetish and a Spirit-fetish. The distinction is given only to exemplify dis-cernment in the use of Fetish-objects. The terms 'Greater' and 'Lesser' do not necessarily denote greater or lesser power, but refer to the extent of dominion and application. As all is gathered in harmonious affinity, relation and correspondence within the Sorcerer's domain, so will his Knowledge take form, even as the Rosarie of Our Royal Arte: One Circle of Knowing form'd by the Cord of Initiated Being; One Cord woven by the Spirit-threads of Time; eleven threads strung with the seeds of the Lumina; eleven times eleven beads to tell Our Grand Array - to meet and to marry the Cipher of Arcana, the Host of Spirits, and the Numen of all Vital Powers. Thus let Our Knowing be cast and bound; thus Our Prayers of Sethos tell: the Prayers of the One who is \"The Mouth of the Man of Light'. THE LESSER FETISHES The Lesser Fetishes are those Sacred Objects which serve as the abodes of specific spirits and which operate as Physical Points of Mediation for those discarnate entities that are the Tutelary and Totemic Guardians of the Sorcerer. 1. The Idol: Be it of Wood, Stone or Metal, the visible representation of a Deific Form is a most potent Spirit-fetish and Reposoire of Divine Power. The use of the Idol as the Point of Mediation betwixt Men and Gods has been used since the Veiy Beginning and is the Path of greatest accessibili-ty for the Worshipper unto the Worshipped. Although partaking of the One Entity, the Idol and its Spirit are distinct. The Idol is the House of the Spirit, its Gate and its Revealed Form unto the Mundane Vision of Man. Worship not the Stone but that which it conceals. 330"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Foremost in virtue is He who maketh the Houses of the Pantheon by his divine artistry, moulding and carving such effigies as will serve as the Abodes of the Host. This he shall accomplish by diverse means and in diverse media according to his innate skills and imagination, and as so directed by the Famulus through the Automatism of the Hand, or even as instructed by a Spirit or God through the Oracle of Oneiric Vision. Also the Divine Artist may purchase or find such carvings and images as his work requires through the mutual gravitation extant between the Sorcerer and the Ensorcelled. He will attract and be attracted unto the idols and effigies of those Gods and Spirits unto whom he is the Priest, being both Master and Servant - the double-handed vicegerent of their Power 'pon the Earth. 2. The Fetishes of Bone: Bones, as the final remnants of certain physical bodies, are the Sacred Fetishes of Our Past States of Entity, Our Ancestors and Our Totems. Likewise all feathers, skins, skulls, anders and horns may serve as the intimate relics of the Sorcerer's Bestial Powers and Forms, and are to be used to affirm one's identity with the Totemic Spirits invoked in the Spells of Metamorphosis and Transmutation, most espe-cially in the Theriomorphic applications of the Congress and Ingress Formulae. The Fallen Feather serveth as the Fetish of the Risen Prayer. The Bones of the Dead serve as the Tokens of the Revenants' Oracle. In the Skin of a Beast Thou shalt become that Beast, and thus, by a ritual identification, the Form and Powers of that Beast shalt be Thine. Yea, the Sleeper will re-awaken in the Flesh of He that is the Silent Reposoire of all Living and Dead. 3. The Fetishes of Stone: By vertu of their curious forms, their colours and their geometry, certain stones are of much value as potent fetish-objects of Magick. Being the Dwelling-places of the Spirits and Elementals of the Earth, they serve as a means of contact with those who guard the Knowledge that is hidden in the Depths. Know ye that all stones, especially those of a crystalline structure, are of a certain vibration and thus may be harmonious or discordant in their res-onance with Thy Work. By the guidance of Thy Famulus locate the Rare Jewels of the Earth, that Thy fetishes may be of much ornament and of great beauty, and that Thy Work may be guarded on all sides by the Powers of the Earth. 331"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Know ye that certain stones are by Tradition deemed most potent in Our Craft: -The Shepherd's Crown, being a stone naturally graven with the Sign of the Fivefold Star, will serve Thee as the Pentacle of Arte. The Devil's Thunderbolt, being a stone naturally form'd like unto a long needle, such is a Potent Effigy of the Phallus, and will serve the Sorcerer as a fetish to determine the Direction of a Power or the Direction in which a Spirit is sent or summoned from. The Hagstone, being a stone that is naturally holed, is a Potent Effigy of the Kteis and will serve as a fetish to reveal a chosen Gateway of Ingress. The Drum The Drum is the Grand Fetish of the Rhythmogrammatic Pathways of Sorcery; it marks the Avenues of a Spirit's Ingress and likewise serveth all Spirits by the tracing of their Sigils in the manner of sound and rhythm. Therefore it is the Oracle of the True Signs of Arte in their Rhythmic Articulation. It casteth forth a Soul in flight, it draweth a Soul down from the heights, and raiseth a Soul from the depths. As the Body of Man is the Steed of the Gods, so the Drum is a Steed of the Soul in its Swift Flight unto the Abodes of the Gods. The Bell The Bell is the Sister-fetish of the Drum and the Bride of the Horn, it is the Instrument of Declaration and serveth most fittingly to give the Opening and Closing Knell of a Rite; also to be struck for the same purpose as the Drum - to delineate the Sigils of Formulae at their tonal and rhythmic level. The Horn The Horn or Trumpet of Bone is the Brother-fetish of the Drum and the Spouse of the Bell, it is the Instrument used in the Calling Forth of the Shades of the Dead, and hence is most fittingly used in the Rite and Formulae of Egress. The Mortar and Pestle The Mortar and Pesde are the Twin Fetish-objects of those. Spirits that have dominion over all Works of Wortcunning - the Secrets of Herblore and of Healing. Thus is it used to grind and prepare all Powders of Arte: Cures, Philtres, Poisons, Elixirs and those Powders used in the tracing of Signs upon the ground. 332"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"The Sacred Rattle The Sacred Rattle of the Sorcerer is the Twin Fetish of the Drum, it serveth to focus and emanate the Rhythmogrammatrix of Magical Power into the diverse Sigillic and fetishistic aspects of a Rite: by the sound and motion of the Hand and Rattle the Power of a Rite is aroused and invigorated; it is driven throughout the Whole of a Mystery, through every Path that leadeth unto the One Point of the Manifold Formulae of Arte. The body of the Rattle is the Womb-fetish and its handle is the Phallus-fetish, the two being united in the One Object are consecrated unto the Sum Creative Power of the Twain-as-One: Man and Woman united as God and Goddess in the Gloiy of the Agapae. Within the body of the Rattle, which is usually a Gourd, the Divine Artist must seal some small fetish-objects such as seeds or stones - these correspond to the immanence of Creation within the Womb of the All-Mother. \"As the Path linketh Point with Point, as the Serpent linketh Star with Star, so the Voice of the Sacred Rattie bridgeth the Spaces betwixt the Words of the Drum.\" The Fetishes of Divination Aught that is possessed by a Spirit of Augury and Prophecy is a fetish or medium of divination. Such fetish-objects of divination are many and diverse, yet all tend towards a Common Principle:-Objects ensorcelled so as to be the Foci of all Temporal Influences or Possibilities at the Instant of Divination will, by their Position, Relation and Interaction, signify or infer the Knowledge of all subsequent Possibilities and Sequences of Temporality - Past, Present and Future. The Arcanum of this Principle lies in the methods of 'reading' the signi-fied or inferred knowledge according to the specific rules of the Fetishes' Tabu. This must be learnt through the tuition of one's Guide or Famulus. He that is knowing of the Tabu of the Prophesying Fetishes will find there-in the Secret: - All Events point to what will be. And He that is knowing of the Secret Revolutions of the Existent Singularities, whereby all Time is governed, he shall find that the Fraction may serve as a Mirror of the Whole, and thus, by the Eye so observing the Foci of Temporality, will find that therein is the Reflection of all Time. 333"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"The Conjunction of Fetishes In certain Rituals and Formulae the Divine Artist may use many fetish-objects in conjunction with each other. For example, the Horse-headed Rod tied with the Knotted Cord, or the Union of the Hagstone and the Devil's Thunderbolt. In tying together by a single thread the diverse fetish-objects that correlate unto a specific Magical Formula or Rite the Sorcerer symbolically aligns those Powers of which the fetishes are the exterior and mundane points of mediation. By mariying one fetish unto another, or by tying many unto a single uni-fying reposoire according to the Familiars' directions, the Sorcerer fulfills the fetishistic application of the Formula of Syncretic Alignment. Ensorcellment: Of Encircling or Binding The Magical Act of 'Binding' is the deliberate limitation of a Force or State of Entity by Will, Desire and Belief in order to give that Force or State of Entity a specific Form or Icon, and hence give its Power a focus and an intensity. OF THE FAMILIAR: THE FAMULUS OR ATTENDANT OF THE SORCERER The Familiar (or Famulus) is the Spirit Servitor and Ally of the Sorcerer. It possesses diverse functions and forms - all partaking of the One Entity (Famulus Rex), yet manifesting as seemingly disparate states of elemental being. It thus possesses the seeming nature of a veritable legion of genii. The Familiar hath dominion over the myriad mundane affairs of the Divine Artist and is diligent to assume such duties as are deemed necessi-tous by the Will of its Master - of whom it is in turn the exteriorisation of tutelary and totemic forms and the extension of his Powers in the Mundane and Elemental Sphere. The Forms of the Familiar are as follows:-1. The Domestic Familiar: This is the Familiar as bound unto the body of a domestic or tame animal. Such beasts as birds, cats, dogs, reptiles, etc, are obtained at their birth and are duly consecrated with the Name of the Spirit-familiar. The method of the consecration is in the manner of a secret baptism, and the method of binding the conjured spirit or daemon within the beast is to cross-sign its brow with Thine own blood. The dutiful service of the Familiar is ensured by feeding it a little of Thine own life-blood at each Rite of the Full Moon."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Such beasts as are employed as the Familiar enjoy a splendid longevity and are often passed down through successive generations of Witchblood - the animal being a totem of the family and the Spirit-familiar being the Ancestral Servitor of the Lineage. According to our custom the Domestic Familiar is to be present with-in certain rites of divination, for by its movements and by its contact with the fetishes the Wise may divine much of That which is yet to be, even of that which is hidden from all others. 2. The Tameless Familiar: Know ye, that the Spirit-familiar may also occupy the Body of a Wild Beast, and its appearance may be as an auspicious mediator betwixt Thee and the Elder Gods. As a Bestial Emissary of the Old Ones the Tameless Spirit-familiar may enter the Circle of Arte during or after the Ceremony, and therein it shall, by some Sign or Sound, impart unto Thee an Omen or a Message of the Gods. 3. The Oracular Familiar: The Spirit-familiar may also maintain a discarnate state and mediate betwixt the Divine and the Mundane Spheres through the medium of an entranced mind. Thus shall it impart the Oracular Words of the Blest Ancestors unto the Covine through Thine own mouth or through one of Thy number. 4. The Shrine Ward or Altar-Famulus: In this aspect the Spirit-familiar hath dominion over the Sacred Fetishes, for such are the Points of Mediation and Communion betwixt Thee and its disembodied form. Through the Skull of Man it shall speak the Words of Thine Antecedents: the Blest that are now without Flesh. Through the relics of the Dead, of Man or of Beast, it shall emanate Thine Atavistic Precedents. Through the Vessels and Idols of Wood, Stone and Clay it shall mediate betwixt Thee and Thy Gods, betwixt Thee and all Spirits with whom Thou wouldst have communion. Mark well the faithfulness of the Famulus; its service unto Thine Intent, even its own identity there-with, carried forth beyond Thine own mortal limits. Likewise mark well the zenith of its manifestation, which serveth not to bear the Will's impress from the Mage but unto the Mage's self-knowing; for such is the Daimon: the Spirit that maketh Mind a Shewstone of all Wisdom."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE CONJURATION OF THE SERVITOR AND THE FORMULAE OF ITS BINDING UNTO THE VESSEL OF THE ORACLE Within a bottle of fine artifice and of rare colour, within a vessel selected through the direction of Thine Eye's predilection, nurture ye the Point of Mediation and Ingress for the Familiar of Holy Blood: the Daimon of the Sacred Ink, wherewith to write the One Grimoire.

By the Arcane Gravity between its Fetishes and Thine own Senses the Spirit shall attract Thee, seemingly by Chance or by Fate, unto its Physical Points of Mediation. By diverse means is the Spirit's approach:-It may come unto Thee by the Path of Dreaming, or may render Itself knowable through Signs of Augury - thereby shall its Name be revealed, together with its many Sigils of Calling and Obedience. By the Very Hand of the Master or Blessed Mistress within the Circle of the Initiated, it will be passed to Thee, and this shall be by the Secret Means of Our Tradition. Even by the Hand of a Stranger or of a Child shall the Famulus make its approach unto Thee, ever in the Name of Thine Ancestry and ever in the ordinance of Witchdom's Fate.
