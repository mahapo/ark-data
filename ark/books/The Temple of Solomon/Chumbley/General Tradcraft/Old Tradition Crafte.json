Unlike other forms of ma-gick, which dwell on \"other world mysticism\", Earth Magick is part of our instinct and heing. It applies directly to us as people. In the Crafte of Earth Oriented Magick, one quickly learns to appreciate, understand and link with the natural cycles, forces and powers that surround us. One becomes aware of the Four Iilements of Fire, Air, F.arth and Water on a more primordial level. Fire — lightning. Air — the unseen life force. Earth — that which gives us life and deserves our love, respect and adoration. Water — the life force which makes all things grow."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Balance of the Sun — light and Moon — darkness become Sun — day light, the time to create and see the Karth in its abundance of life, animals, plants, trees and flowers. This is the warmth and comfort of that division in the 24 hour cycle when all is alive. The Moon — night light, the time of rest during the darkness to renew strengths, the still time when lite as we know it rests, and the lile of unseen forces comes alive. This is a time to contemplate. Both the Four Klements and Balance are not simply philosophical concepts to explain unseen forces. In the realm of Karth Magick, they are the forces, but not unseen. They are seen through the eyes of those who are aware of the F'arth and understand it, and know how and why the natural cycles of the I^arth apply to the great magick. The Earth is a big book of magick, mysticism and mystery. Only when it is opened and studied can Natual Magick be applied and used to benefit mankind. You will have great success if you work with the cycles of the F.arth rather than against them. It is here that you will develop a magickal current with the F.arth that will help greatly in your development of psychic and magickal powers. Over thousands of years, people have (2)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"charted the cycles of the Earth and interpreted them. The Earth and its cycles have been ev-aluated, studied and examined to arrive at a pattern of events that are the life, guide and advisor of all peoples. Working by the Moon is an important part of Natural Magick, as the Moon affects so much of what happens on the Earth. One can predict the tides and weather by the Moon and know when to plant, fish, cut hair, etc. The Moon has its greatest effect on oceans, streams and lakes when it is full. This is its high-energy peak. It is the best time for people to work magick, especially of the natural Earth type. It is a time of completion, fullness of power and the height of creativity. Work of this type should be done on the nights of the frill Moon. As the Moon wanes, it gets lesser in both size and influence. Work corresponding to this phase should be concerned with taking away bad energy and forces. During the dark of the Moon when the night sky is black and the Moon is not visible, no work should be done. It is a bleak negative time when you have no natural Lunar element to work with. If any magickal work were to be done at this time it would be chaotic. There is a school of thought that the only work (3)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"suitable at this time is curses and spells to destroy enemies and bad luck. This is because the New Moon is a void empty time and only void empty energy exists at this time. During the phase of the Waxing Moon, the Moon starts to build lorces and strength as it gets larger. This is a time to renew energy and build energy and creative lorces. By this, you can see that when the Old Tradition witches met at the different times of the Moon, it was not to be weird, as the common person would surmise. Rather, it was to work with the natural cycles of the Earth and Moon to successfully work their Crake. The Seasons are also part of the Earth's natural cycle. They are a gift to the Earth's peo-ple as a guide to life and living. When Spring comes, new animals are born and the Earth awakens from its long, cold sleep. Plants and flowers sprout green buds and leaves and struggle upwards from the now warming Earth to greet the Sun. Soil is turned and preparations for planting are made. This is the true New Year. It is the time of awakening and renewal. It is time for people to plan new projects, to start the cycle of active life and begin anew. During the Summer, when the leaves are (4)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"full and the flowers and plants are grown, it is the time of life. If you followed the book of the Karth and live by it, now is the time to actualize projects and see the plans you've made blossom. The Earth's Magick winds down with the Autumn. This is a time for completion and preparation. The animals grow thicker coats, squirrels hoard nuts and the harvest is brought in. It is a time to finish up projects and to reap the benefits of your labours. It is a time for re-flection. Soon, when the winter snow comes and the wolves begin to howl, the plants are gone, the trees have shed their leaves and the meadow mice huddle in their grass nests beneath the snow, snug and warm and secure. This is a time when the plans you made in the Spring, grew in the Summer, harvested in the Autumn, must sustain you through the Winter. It is now a time for rest and contemplation. The phases of the Moon and Seasons corre-spond to each other; Waxing Moon — Spring, Full Moon — Summer, Waning Moon — Autumn and New Moon — Winter. As well as the natural cycles of the F'arth that directly affect us, both mystically and physically, we also have the magick of the F'arth (5)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"itself. Karth magick is absolute in content, but intuitive in discovery and application. ©ools atiti (Earilj, Bkpirii The Oaken Cudgel for instance is cut at certain times ot the Moon tor specific purposes. Why Oak? Simply because it represents strength, consistency and dependability. All ot these thing's must be considered, because it protects the practitioner of the Crake from forest spirits that may invade the witches Ring or circle during the workings of spells and charms. This obviously could cause chaos in the work. I\\ach tree possesses certain properties that are magickal. Strength for Oak. Worthiness for Pine. Unyielding strength for Yew. Under-standing for Willow. These magickal properties are inherent in the wood itself. As they are all different, the magick is obvious. It is not enough to symbolically use the wood. In Natural Earth Magick, one must comply with the natural order of the Earth. By this, it is meant that you do not merely \"steal\" a limb from the tree. You must first touch the tree, (6)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"communicate with its spirit and convey your desire and purpose for wanting its limb. Do this through your thoughts and touch and listen for permission. If you do not receive permission, do not be offended. Simply go to another tree and repeat the process. Iron is also highly magickal. It begins as ore from the Earth. Its smelted with fire, needs clay to become steel and after the steel is worked it must be quenched in brine, salt water, to be hardened for use. So as you can see, the magickal blade is born from the Earth, clay, and observing balance, is given back to the Earth. It is worked through Fire, Air, Earth and Water and purified with Salt. It is, above all, a Magickal Creation. Ore must also be asked for. For in Natural F'arth Magick, one must consider the incarnation of the raw material. Does it wish to be reincarnated into a magickal creation of man? I\\arth Magick goes beyond the absolute state of magick and enters the intuitive instinctive state. In this case, one could sit on the shore of the ocean while the tide comes in and align thoughts of good fortune coming to them with the waves that come towards them. You could obtain a stick, in the prescribed (7)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"manner, and inscribe Runes of wealth and good fortune on it and throw it into the Water only for it to return, to do it again. In the same setting one could send out a stick of woes when the tide goes out. One could plant a special tree to represent a good life and all that goes with it, and meditate by alignment as it grows. Or one could deeply bury a bag ol woes (a bag containing slips of paper with your life's negative traits written upon them) with fallen apples so it will rot. As the bag of woes rots, so do the woes. In essence, the Crafte of Natural Karth Magick has one law. As something grows, so can your desires grow. As something wanes or dies, so can your troubles wane and die. M one Itkgick The most ancient style of Natual Magick is Stone Magick. All throughout Britain's ancient history, the noble stone has been cut, carved and erected to influence, direct, call, hold and create the mystical web of magickal influence of the ancient peoples. Stone Magick is perhaps the oldest single form of magick ever practiced. (»)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(9) The mysteries and magickal use of stone range from Britain's Stone Circles, to the smaller Standing Stones carved in Celtic design style, to the Rune Stones. Stone is in earthly abundance. It is a med-ium that is part of the Earth itself that can be shaped, cut and carved to the design of the cutter, and it lasts forever. It was because of the permanence and the Earth orientation of the eitergy of stone that it was chosen by the ancients as a medium for their magickal Crafte. This, coupled with the fact that it takes much skill and special tools to cut stone, plays a part in the mystical elements of Stone Magick. Those who could cut stone and mastered this art were looked upon as being special. This was due to their ability to link stone with steel and the Four Elements. They were the Rune Masters. They possessed the Secrets of the Runes. Stone Magick, as this book presents, represents a magick that is not unlike, yet more mystical than the magick of talismans and charms. It represents a complete, yet simple system of magick that has been preserved in time like the stones it represents. —Robin Artisan"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(\") Pari iDne €\\\\t SEools fur (Spiriting Stone AKINO THE stone cutting tools is as much or more of a ritual than preparing the stones themselves.

You can check this when you search for stones by scratching your stone with the Rakk. Your choice of stone will be suitable i( a clear de-finite scratch can be made in the surface of the stone. There are three main tools for cutting designs into stone. They are the Rakk — a scriber. The Teele — gives a \"v\" cut.

It is recommended that you cast the Runes and ask about your success in this venture. Do this when you have set up the forge and are surrounded with your tools. This reading ap-plies to your ability to make the tools and how magickal they will be when finished. Since stone magick has an affinity with Rune Magick, it is probably best to use Rune Divination. Take your tools to your secret place in the forest and meditate on the work. Ask the forest for permission to start the work and for blessings upon your work. The best time for this is in late Spring on a night of the Full Moon. This is not only because of the obviously mystical reasons of Season, Moon or Natural Farth Magick, but there are practical reasons also. A forge does not fire up well on a cold night and you need the darkness to see the color of the steel before you quench it. The full Moon gives the necessary natural light to work by. Set up your forge fire and bless both it and your work at hand.

Start your Fire slowly with twigs gathered, with permission of the forest, from the forest floor. When they are set ablaze, place some coals on the fire and fan it through the furrow with a large piece of bark. While waiting for the coals to glow red, you should cut your steel to the approximate shape. When there is a good bed of red glowing coals, place the three rough — cut tools in the coals using your tongs. As the Fire is fanned, you'll notice the steel turning color. When it reaches a cherry red take it out using your tongs. Only take out the piece you will be working on. Bring it to the anvil and hammer it to the desired shape. When this is done to your satisfaction, say an invokation to the F.arth to accept your work and plunge the piece, still hot, into the ground. Repeat this process for the other two cutting tools. If while hammering, they cool off, simply introduce them back into F'ire. So far your cutting tools have touched the Elements of Fire and Earth. They are now ready for their final shaping. Use your files and vice for this process. The coarse file is for the rough shaping. The medium and fine file are for truing up the work. When this is done, you"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"must polish the cutting edges with the polishing stone. Make sure the cutting edges are polished bright. Meanwhile you should tend the forge and make sure the coals are kept glowing. When the three tools are polished, they must be carefully laid on top of the red coals. This time you will see a definite, more pro-nounced change in color. When the tools reach a cherry red again, you must take each tool out, one at a time, and plunge them into the brine. The brine must first be blessed. Also bless the tool when you quench it. Remember to plunge the tool into the brine cutting edge first. Do this with all three cutting tools. Now it is time to polish the cutting edges again. This will render them bright so you can see the color when you temper them, and by polishing the tools you will remove the scale. Set them once more over the coals when they are polished. Wait for them to turn a straw color. When they reach straw, repeat the quenching process one more time. Now they are given a final polish and are blessed as the tools they have become. Give thanks to the forge and quench it with the brine. Make sure the fire is out and bury the forge with some Earth.

NOTE: There are people who practice the Crafte and do not live in an environment that allows tor the setting up of a forge. There are also people in the Crafte who have little or no talent with their hands, or the working of steel.

If you should be in a situation where the ritual of forming the cutting tools is beyond your skills or you don't have a wooded area in which to erect a forge, there is a solution. You can go to any well-stocked lapidary shop and buy two Dixon engraving tools with handles. Suitable tools are #3 tor the Teele, and #40 for the Mull.

You should have a magickally blessed ink and a pen, of the quill type, to draw the character and Runes on the stone.

This insures that the place in which you are working is pure with your resonance only and no other vibrations or forces can enter it while you work. This assures you of success in your Magickal Work. The Khael Stone is usually carried with you. Thus, if at any time you feel a low ebb of energy, this simple ritual will restore your energy level.

Concentrate on the aim and purpose of your magickal work as you bring the stones close-apart, close-apart. Do this faster and faster until you build up enough psychic energy. You will know when to release it by sense. At this time bring the stones together for three sharp taps. The sound of the stones will echo loudly in your ears. The sound carries the resonance of your thoughts to their destination. In Galling a person, the subject will feel your psychic resonance and feel drawn to you.

Signatures to confessions were often taken with another's hand holding that of the signer. Truth was never accepted. The Inquisition's torturers only want-ed to hear what they wanted to hear.

He was a schoolmaster who lived at Saltpans in Lothian. Llere is an account of what occurred with the North Berwick Coven after they were ar-rested.

Her knowledge of healing and somewhat miraculous results, coupled with the fact that she would be absent from Seaton's house every second night made Seatou suspicious. He questioned her as to how she could heal so well and where she learned her art. Chilis would give him no answer. Seaton then sought to use more cruel methods of extracting the answers. At first this was done by him alone, but soon he became fearful and engaged Holy Inquisition torturers, as by now he suspected her of Witchcrafte. Gillis Duncan, the Maiden of the coven soon confessed. She turned in Agnes Sampson, Grand Mistress of the coven, Agnes Tomson and Doctor John Fian, Grand Master of the coven. Later, Gillis Duncan turned in Euphemia McCalyan, Barbara Napier, Kate Gray, George Noilis and others who lived in Leith. Agnes Sampson and Agnes Tomson were tortured and confessed to the King and his Council, giving names and practices. Dr. Fian was later tortured, but he would confess nothing.

Fian confessed nothing ol importance, but told the Inquisitors what they wanted to hear on their terms. He did not give any secrets away, nor did he betray any other member. While in prison he managed to escape. This was due to the fact that one of the turnkeys was a member of the coven. Dr. Fian returned to Saltpans where he planned to meet some still secret coven members who would help hi in escape to France where he would join up with another coven that was part of his Order. Flans went afoul and he was recaptured before he could escape. Upon being returned to prison, he denied his prior false confession. Again he endured torture. Pins were stuck under his fingernails and later his fingernails were pulled out with turkas (pliers). I le remained steadfast and strong and would not confess. Again he was tortured with the boots and his legs were crushed to a pulp. He still would not confess, nor name others of the coven. Doctor John Fian was condemned to die.

Bothwell had his eye on the Scottish throne. If James vi should die without an heir, he would be King. His plan was to cause James to die so he could secure the throne and be King. If his plans were successful, he would have the power to suppress, if not curtail the Holy Inquisition's power in Scotland.

A second requirement is that they be sure that they truly desire to become a witch. Should the other witches of the coven find the new person worthy and sincere, they would consent for the new person to join. Now the new person took an oath of loyalty to Heme, the Horned God. The oath bound the person to the coven and Heme. The oath was designed to show the person's loyalty, devotion and respect for secrecy. The new witch promised also to live by magickal knowledge, keep the old ways unto themselves, family and children and, above all,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"pledged loyalty and secrecy. The Grand Master of the coven, or covey, as it was sometimes called, presided over the Sahhats. He donned the horns and skin of a stag, thus becoming by the process of imitative magick, the Horned God of the Forest. He would go into a trance to link with the spirit of the Horned God. This he did by doing an ancient dance called the Horn Dance. Variations of this dance are done in Britain to this day. The new person, as well as any witch who attended the Sabbat, was referred to as a cummer. The new cummer now entered the Horn Dance, to dance with the Horned God. When they were finished the dance, a large horn of black ale was passed to each witch. The ale was a strong, dark stout. The new cummer was the last person to drink, and now was considered part of the coven. After this binding, the cummer was now asked to give some hair and fingernail clippings to the Horned God. This was to insure the cummer's just rewards should he or she ever turn against the coven. Perhaps to even turn them over to the Inquisitors to save his/her own hide. In return lor the token of fingernail clippings and hair, the cummer was given a secret name, a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"witch name, by the Horned God. The cummer devised a mark to go with the secret name and then signed the witches' book. The final stage ot the initiation involved the cummer being marked behind the left ear with the sign of the witches' foot, the sign of a witch. NOTE: Witchcrafte from the Middle Ages to the time of the Inquisition was very controversial and was condemned by the Church as heresy. The Crafte became a secret society, unlike the many branches of the modern Crafte today that openly and freely practice as the Pagan Religion. Initiation was a serious matter, for it represented loyalty and trust to a persecuted people. Trust and loyalty were necessary to the survival of the group and its knowledge. Initiation has its mystical symbolism also. It represents a person's transition from lite darkness of ignorance, to the light of secret wisdom and knowledge. I will now analyze the Initiation Ritual of the North Berwick Witches to add clarity and logical explanation to the ceremony. This will be done, point by point, for easy understanding, so you can further see its meaning. Since Witchcrafte was considered heresy by the Holy Roman Church, an adamant insist-(105)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"ence upon trustworthiness and sincerity of the candidate was of the utmost importance. In those days, to accept just anyone at his or her word could mean death. The coven, being highly psychic, judged the cummer's worthiness to join the coven. This was a rather simple procedure, not often questioned because it had to be a fellow witch who sponsored the initiate. A member of the coven was expected to be beyond reproach and was expected to make careful decisions, based on the Laws of the Crafte. One slip-up in this direction could mean torture, hanging or being burnt at the stake. An Oath reaffirms trust and a sincere pledge of ethics towards one's fellow members, be it a coven or club. It shows the people, with whom you are aligning, that you share the same values, interests and goals of the group. In the Crafte this means that you live by the Crafte, for the Crafte. During the Horn Dance, the initiate was able to align energies with and commune with the Horned God. Upon finishing the dance, the coven shares a horn of ale. By all members drinking the same ale out of the same horn, symbolically they are"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"linked in a very deep bond. That which is done for one, is done for all, and that which is done against one, is done against all, meeting with a stiff penalty. To show trust to the coven, the initiate gives the ingredients necessary to be used in a spell, should he/she ever turn against the coven. On the other hand, the same ingredients could be used to aid the initiate, should they ever be in trouble. The witch name was very important. Witches took false names and appropriate nicknames to conceal their identities should they ever be betrayed or caught. If a witch were caught by the Inquisitors, the coven had a certain amount of protection, lor the captured witch could only reveal the false names. This could fail if certain members knew each other personally. In the earlier times of the Crafte, the witch name was a very secret name that contained the magickal essence of the witch.

The second was for the celebration of the Old Festivals. These are called the Major and Minor Sabbats. All covens in one county worked under the guidance of one Grand Master. Sometimes neighboring covens from nearby counties would all get together for the yearly festivals, the Major and Minor Sabbats. Here the highest-ranking Grand Master would preside.

These festivals were celebrated with a ritual in the form of a mystery play that depicted the meaning of the season and festival. There was also much feasting and drinking and merrymaking.

The witch was also taught to develop his/her psychic ability and power. The learning took place one spell at a time. The spells were learned in the order that they were written in the witch's spell book. Before the witch was passed, in learning the witch work, and considered to have mastered the spell, it had to be performed for the person who had taught it. This allowed the witch to repay the teacher with the results of the spell. It also allowed the teacher to see first hand the potential of the student. When the spell was mastered and could be performed successfully by the witch whenever needed, the witch would go then on to learn the next spell in the book — each time, the spell being done for the tea-cher, as a test.

When this occurs, there is a constant energy exchange between all the witches in the coven. Through this balancing of energy, each witch receives greater power, as does the coven.

This form of divination is directly taken from Dr. John Finn's Spell Book. The practice of dice divination is different in respect to card reading.

These are then interpreted accord-ing to how they read. The method given here has never before been published. It is the exclusive property ol the witch order to which Dr. Eian anil the North Berwick Witches belonged. I will present this method in point form as in the original witch book.

Now you have a com-bination of pips by combining the two throws of the two larger dice. Look at the chart and find the corresponding meaning.

By throwing the larger ones one time each, and the smaller sets twice, one at a time, you arrive at the main omen. This gives you the overall circumstances of the reading. The meaning of the two larger dice gives you the overall circumstances, and the four other throws give you the underlying cir-cumstances ot the reading. If you are going to continue asking questions, repeat the process of the smaller dice. This may be done only in the same subject of your original question, when you cleared the dice. Should you intend to change the subject, the dice must be cleared again. This system is very good and can produce some startling answers.

Part <Et$t Jamiliar Spirits The Familiar Spirit was, and still is, one ot the most important parts ot witchdoni. There are two forms of Familiar Spirit. Dr. Fian's book lists both. The common familiar is an animal such as a mouse, ferret, cat or dog. These are the most popular. The chosen animal is endowed with a psychic link to the witch. A witch could enter the body of the familiar spirit and see through the animal's eyes. Thusly, a witch could move about the countryside and not be detected.

Actually, the witch took over the animal's mind while in a trance state. The second form of familiar is called the Grand Familiar. It takes much more skill to master, and is much more effective.

However, they can only have one common familiar. €\\\\t duimnon Jamiliar It is essential that you watch the hirth of the animal. As it is being born you must make a calling to the Horned God.

This must be mixed with a little of your blood. This special feeding is done during the phase ot the full Moon only, at the time when the Moon reaches its highest peak. Also, before the feeding and after the ieeding, you must breathe onto the animal's breath. This is also essential during the birth ot the animal.

The final step in using the familiar is to make a small amulet with your witch mark on one side and the familiar's name on the other side. The amulet should be the correct size tor the familiar to wear comfortably. It is made out of either copper or iron or bone.

If the familiar detects something as you sleep, it will send you the information in the form of a dream. NOTES ON THE COMMON FAMILIAR: Although this section is straightforward it is important to realize that the closeness of the animal and the witch is the key element of success. In no way is the animal being manipulated. The bonding allows both witch and familiar to work together. Both the witch and familiar animal must have a close bond of trust if there is to be any success in this work. Oneness, not control, is the key here. NOTES ON THE GRAND FAMILIAR: The Grand Familiar must be wrapped with enough string to cover it. The string is not taken off until the Sabbat Master or Grand Master blesses it. This familiar spirit is more complex and effective than the common type. However, once you understand the theory of it, it is quite simple. The stone familiar, called an Og, works on psychic and astral principals. It does not disappear to do its work. The very nature of its existence is enough. Here one finds the link between human and mineral, as the first form is a link between human and animal. This type of familiar acts as an extension of the witche's mind, which is concerned with one ( 132 )"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"( r33 ) element or purpose only. In this case, your perception of that purpose is allowed to roam outside your immediate conscious and psychic mind. This element or purpose, works much like a magnet in that it is attracted to the external forms or manifestations of its specific purpose.

In short, the Grand Familiar is simply a ritually con-structed extension of your psychic awareness in a specific subject. Since these familiars have only one specific purpose, you may make several to cover the range of purposes or subjects that are necessary for your work.

NOTE: It was usual to use the iron spike for curses etc., and to use a wooden spike for spells of benefit etc. As a suggestion, one may check out the table of woods and their meanings in the section on the Witches' Bottle.

It is again passed around the ring as before. This time, each witch breathes life into it, using their strings. The string is wrapped around the poppet and held at arms length. The witch breathes along the string while saying a spell to the effect of the desired results of the ritual. Remember to pass the poppet around the circle in the direction correct for the type of spell being done.

The psychic and magickal strength of the witch is shown through the eyes. It is important that you be able to cast this power from your eyes during concentration into ritual objects such as strings and poppets. When you develop this skill you will be able to send thoughts through your eyes. To develop the witches' eye, like any Crafte of witchdom, all you need is practice. 'This is accomplished by gazing into a shew stone, crystal ball or scrying bowl. Hold the thought you wish to send by concentrating on it. Do this until all the powers of your psychic mind are given to the thought and you can hold onto it for a good length of time. You are looking for signs of being able to concentrate on only one thought very quickly putting that thought before all others. While doing this, focus as much psychic energy on the thought as you are able. When you are proficient at holding your (HO"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"concentration you may then master the power of the witches' eye. In this charm the aim is to focus your con-centration into a witches' glass, small black scrying glass. This helps you to concentrate and reflects your energy back to your eyes. When you have raised enough energy (power), you lift your eyes from the glass and gaze at your subject's eyes with a quick stare. This sends your thought to the subject and you fascinate them by your psychic influence. Only your imagination can limit your use of this charm and its many faceted potential. A person I know recently acquired a job at a plant that he was anxious to work for, simply by using the witches' eye. Under normal circum-stances, he probably would not have been offered the position, due to the lack of edu-cational requirements. On top of this, it was a tight opening. He applied for the job and was granted an interview. While waiting outside the office with about a dozen people, he seized the opportunity to gaze into his small witches glass. When he saw the foreman who was to interview him, he cast the witches' eye at him. The fore-man was struck with the idea that he would be the man for the job, thinking this, he was hired on the spot.

Another correspondent in otir research society tried this spell. The problem was how to get the pubic hairs. This girl was a pub regular who lived in Manchester.

He was pleased and thanked her, but there was still no interest. She promptly said, \"I am a witch and I need three pubic hairs, so I can put a love spell on you\". He let out a hearty guffaw and said \"okay\", he would give them to her within the hour. Luckily he was a good-natured fellow, as this approach is not the best to acquire pubic hairs. She got the hairs as he promised. She did the spell that night. The next week at the pub he approached her, in somewhat of a daze, wondering if she had done a spell or if this was a joke played on him by his pub mates. He had to ask her this because he could not get her out of his mind all week. She smiled and told him again she was a witch and did indeed enchant him. He asked her out. He was impressed, and not at all regretful of the spell. Because of this spell, he gained a healthy interest in the Crafte.

NOTE: While this spell may seem a little difficult at first, a bit of thought and ingenium should overcome any obstacle you may en-counter. The problem of making a polished copper mirror in darkness without looking at it is easily solved. You must obtain two pieces of copper. One is for the spell, the other is to test how much polishing is needed. Polish the test piece and time yourself, noting the best technique for arriving at a mirror polish. This time and tech-nique will be duplicated on the mirror to be used for the spell. Our research society gives the following method for polishing the mirror. First use a fine crocus cloth. Then go to an extra fine crocus, suitable for removing the scratches from glass. The final polishing comes from a piece of four ounce oak tanned leather impregnated with rouge. After this, buff the mirror with a piece of soft linen. As you follow this process you will see the changes in the copper and the technique will become obvious.

Part ^fourteen 1 (Eaultrimt Spell Cauldrons were often employed by witches for certain spells. The cauldron was a small iron kettle, in which ointments, medicines and potions were brewed. Though there were times when the cauldron was used for spells. Witches were always cautioned never to stir the contents of a kettle. This was in case it caused problems and fights in the home. Yet, you could employ this method to cause discord for an enemy. To do this you need a kettle or cauldron. Into this, you put some Water from your enemy's house or property, traditionally from the well, along with some fingernail clippings, hair, etc. Make a Fire under the kettle with Flder wood and pitch. Stir the kettle anti-clockwise when it starts to boil. Use an Oak tweed to stir it. While you are doing this, say the following charm:"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Fire burn and kettle boil, Give (name) strife, -while I toil.

The contents ot the kettle are poured on your enemy's pathway. Do this spell at your secret place. Hses of Burnings Incenses of a variety of natures are used in many occult ceremonies. They are not simply used for their scent, but rather they have the affinity to attract certain forces and repel others. Thus they may lend to your spells, an edge, for a greater success. I only recommend using the traditional burnings, Irom Dr. Fian's book, when you are doing his spells. These herbs can also be used when you make a witches' bottle. They should be burned when you do the spells. Select the proper burnings for your spell and the witch work will be more effective.

HPeafljcv Spells One of the witches' many talents and abilities was to raise the winds and control the weather. The old witch book gives some spells for raising weather. The coven would raise the winds by doing the old witch dance. They would run and dance around the witches' ring. This was and still is done today, on brooms and cockhorses. While the witches were dancing,"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"the Grand Master would beckon the winds with his hunting sword. To bring stillness to the weather, the witch women gently swayed to and fro with their broomsticks held high.

The Sabbat Mistress beckoned the rain in this spell. To raise a storm, the spell was the same, except for a Fire being set under the kettle. These spells were done to aid witches who were farmers. BPtfrijejs' €apers Witches have always used special tapers or candles. They were black, but this had no relation to evil. It was because of common sense and supply and demand.

This circle is called a Ring by Old Tradition Witches. There are many riddles left over from Dr. John Fian's time that tell of the Witches' Ring. One ol them says that the coven works within a Ring, which grows to let all the witches fit therein. Another witch riddle stales that the coven had a magick table that they sit around. It grows to let any number to be seated. During the Major ami Minor Sabbats, the witches worked in a Castle that had four doors. This riddle means that the witches worked in a large square. There were always four covens to a county. F>ach coven represented one of the four quarters, North, F'ast, South and West. These covens represented the four doors, of which could only be opened by entering a coven. The Grand Master cast the Ring with his hunting sword. \"He also sealed the Ring and ( T59)"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"protected the Castle with his hunting sword. This means that he traced the boundaries of the Ring and Castle with the sword to provide magickal protection. The witche's power was kept in the Ring by using the sword to seal it, this would allow the power to be raised and protected. When the power was raised, it could be directed to do its work. After the ring was cast or the Castle raised, the Sabbat Mistress would anoint it. If you are doing your work alone, you may cast the Ring around yourself with your witch knife. Spells of love, prosperity, luck, benefit etc. are always worked clockwise or deosil. Curses, bindings, removal of bad forces, etc., are always worked anti-clockwise or widdershin. Anything used in the Ring or Castle for spells, etc., is always passed around the ring for as many times as there witches present. This passing always starts at the North in the hands of the Grand Master and ends up in the hands of the Sabbat Mistress.

The Sabbat Mistress used a small white-hilted knife. She used it to Call the forces. The Sabbat Mistress was chosen by omen, usually through the dice. She was picked from a group of witch women known as Maidens. These were the women of the coven who showed both extraordinary ability and loyalty to the coven. All in the coven had witches' knives. These knives arc used to cast Rings, direct forces and to cut strings and herbs. The knife was to be single edged. The coven has a large white horn which all drink from on the Greater and Grand Sabbats, and a black horn to be used on the Lesser Sabbats.
