My intentions for the book back then were simply to place copies in a few local shops, and to make it available online, in the hopes o f stirring a little interest locally in ‘modern traditional witchcraft’ with a Cornish slant, or even discovering and making contact with other traditional witches in the area. Believing that such interests might possibly be found within the local pagan community, the book was written, as far as possible, with a neo-pagan audience in mind.However, I quickly grew out o f my naive enthusiasm to uncover plenty o f traditional witches on my doorstep and began to accept that such a thing is a rarity. Whilst a few copies were sold locally, we were amazed to find the book taken up enthusiastically far and wide to the point that thousands o f copies have now gone out to many parts o f the world.O f course, the home binding o f the books became an impossibility; the printing and binding was outsourced and a revised edition produced in paperback and hardback.So what exactly is this little book about that has gone to so many far-flung places and where does its content come from?My own experiences o f the Craft began as a solitary, instinctual and self motivated affair. I dove headfirst at an early age into the reading, and practice, o f all things witchcraft and folk-magical, absorbing all I could from as much time as I could spend in school and later college libraries rather than11"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"getting any ‘proper’ work done! It felt natural to explore the folklore and magic o f Cornwall, to adapt and incorporate these into my practice and ponderings in the West Cornish landscape. Brief involvement within Gardnerian and Alexandrian covens proved valuable, yet not entirely my ‘cup o f tea’ and it was not until entering into correspondence and friendship with certain witches outside o f Cornwall that I discovered the existence o f ‘traditional witchcraft’, allowing me to realise that there were others practicing in a similar way. This was to be most dramatically illustrated to me when a friendship began with JackDaw, whose Craft, built upon a magical inheritance from his Devonshire Grandmother, tallied with my own so uncannily in a number o f ways.It was around the time o f this important contact that I became aware o f the existence o f a loose network o f individuals and a couple o f small groups in West Cornwall, most, if not all, it now seems had some connection or lineage, initiatory or experiential, to what claimed to be an ‘Old Craft’ tradition that arrived at some point in Cornwall, rather circuitously, from another area o f England. Interestingly, this lineage, into which I was also to be initiated, seems to have had a habit o f identifying local god forms and loci o f power to incorporate into its ways. The witches I encountered and worked with in West Cornwall revered the Bucca and incorporated Cornish folklore into their rites, and Cornish Charms and magic into the operative side o f their Craft. It is the friendship, group working and initiatory experience with the West Cornwall witches, the formation o f my own working group and my own early and ongoing personal Craft practice which all coalesced to give rise to the ideas presented within this book.T r a d itio n a l W itc h c r a ft — Л C o rn ish b o o k o f W ays12"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In case any should believe otherwise, it is necessary to repeat my clarification in the original preface; I make no claims that the content o f this book represents a historical Cornish witch tradition. There was no such ‘set in stone’ organised Cornish witchcraft. Traditional magical practice has always been largely unique to the individual practitioner, and it is an organic way that evolves and changes. The ‘tradition’ presented within this book is my own invention, drawing from and inspired by my own response to Cornish witch-lore, magic and folklore, modern traditional witchcraft and my experiences with witches and magical practitioners in Cornwall and beyond the Tamar. It is for these very reasons that I was careful to give the book the subtide o f ‘Л Cornish B ook o f mays’ rather than \"The C ornish B ook o f W ays’.Why ‘Traditional Witchcraft’? This is o f course a term which has arisen since the emergence in the 1 960s o f Robert Cochrane’s Craft writings, and the name given to a varied yet particular witchcraft movement inclusive o f non Gardnerian/ Alexandrian witchcraft, witchcraft that is pre 1939 in origin or revivalist forms that are inspired by historical witchcraft practices.1Often there is confusion by some o f ‘traditional’ with ‘historical’ despite the fact that the two words have entirely different meanings. The word ‘tradition’ is derived from the Latin tradere or traderer meaning simply to transmit. A tradition is thus a transmission or sharing o f ideas, concepts, beliefs, practices etc. amongst groups or individuals. There is in fact no official definition or rule as to how ‘old’ such transmissions have to be in order to qualify as ‘traditional’.Witchcraft in Cornwall, as elsewhere, has been subject to a pattern o f revival. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, a1. Howard, Michael, Children of Cain, p. 15Preface to the Second E d itio n13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"tradition o f professional operative magical practice existed in the form o f ‘white witches’ and cunning folk. It is from this tradition that the ‘pellar cult’ o f Cornwall seems to have arisen amidst an environment o f numerous revivals o f witchcraft, ritual magic, occultism and cunning throughout the 1 8th and 1 9th centuries.2The emergence o f other forms o f popular occultism and spiritualism however may have played a part in the gradual decline o f the pellar cult as a prominent presence, alongside other rapid changes in society. A certain interest in such things lingered however, and it is from the work o f William Bottrell and Robert Hunt, who both collected a fascinating body o f material from the people o f Cornwall in the mid 19th Century, that much o f Cornwall’s folklore relating to witchcraft and magic comes and is often revisited.As an inclination and a way o f being, rather than a professional service, the cult o f the pellar is not reliant on supporting social structures in order to continue. The concept o f Vitch-blood’ familiar to modern traditional witchcraft was also known within the pellar cult. Pellar-blood is suggestive o f not only familial lineage, but o f an innate ‘otherness’, and a heritage o f spirit.3 Such individuals may arise in any period o f history, and indeed the present.A landscape such as Cornwall’s would seem to be a natural environment to nestle and nurture those given to magic and exchange with the spirit world, and in which the individualistic rather than organised way o f the pellar may perennially arise. It is a landscape that possesses a powerful attraction to artists, poets, mystics and eccentrics, amongst whom there have always been those given to communion with the spirits2.

At a time when mid 20th century folklorists and historians were taking a more academic interest in Cornish witchcraft, it was figures like Ithell Colquhoun who were active in the revival o f the actual practice o f Cornish methods o f magic.4O f course, a hugely important figure in the revival o f Cornish magic and the pellar cult is Cecil H. Williamson, founder o f the Museum o f Witchcraft. Cecil dedicated a lifetime to studying the work o f the ‘wayside witch’, and, in particular, the ways o f Cornish witchcraft and magic which were vivified within his research and operative practice.The old ways o f regional magic are quiedy kindled and developed for the present day within the living and evolving currents o f modern Traditional witchcraft, amongst hidden gatherings and individual practitioners.In the fields, wooded valleys, cottages and craggy cliff-tops o f Cornwall, old charms are re-worked by new hands, guided by die spirit presences and unseen potencies o f the Cornish landscape which continues to feed, as but one tributary, the far flowing living streams o f magic making.Gemma Gary,West Cornwall, February 2014Preface to the Second E d itio n4.

There exist common threads that run throughout the various recensions o f the ‘Elder Faith’, but the precise traditions, ways and practices o f the ‘Old Craft’ will always differ and be flavoured by the preserved folk beliefs, traditions, customs, lore, historical magical rites, charms and impedimenta o f the region in which its practice is rooted. Traditional witchcraft is regional witchcraft, it is not and never has been a standardised practice and long may this continue to be the case. The day witchcraft loses regional variation is the day traditional witchcraft ceases to exist.On top o f the well established regional variation, there is also the fact that a traditional witch’s practice is born from their own response to the ways o f their particular locality and landscape, and an individual’s instinct, insight, inspiration and creativity come into play.

In many ways the word witchcraft seems to be inextricably linked with Cornwall; a remote horn o f land which is home to countless legends o f old magic and sorcery, fantastical beings and many haunted ancient sites which inspire the imagination to ponder the mysterious midnight goings on o f witches and joyous gatherings o f Piskies...Within the old folk tales o f every land there are contained elements o f truth and folk-memories o f the ‘Old Ways’ passed down through legend and custom. Cornwall is certainly no different and behind the legends there is a ‘faery faith’ and a W ise-Craft that have continued to be observed and practised right up to the present day (although sadly to an ever decreasing extent) where they exist overshadowed by the modern, and in some respects unrelated, popular practices o f Wicca.Cornwall was indeed home to many folk-magic practitioners, a tradition that reached a climax in the 1 9thC. Such practitioners offered a range o f services mostly involving the work o f healing, curse lifting, exorcising o f evil spirits, protection, love, and the restoring o f lost or stolen property.Clients were often provided with magical substances in the form o f small bags o f earth or prepared powders. Written charms are also a common feature o f Cornish folk-magic, intricately folded and sewn shut inside small square bags.T r a d itio n a l W itc h c r a ft — Л C o rn ish B o o k o f W ays18"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Some Cornish practitioners achieved a certain degree o f fame, two o f the most notable perhaps being Tamsin Blight and Granny Boswell.Tamsin Blight, or Tammy Blee as she would have been known, lived from 1798 to 1856 and was perhaps the most famous historical practitioner in Cornwall. Plying her trade within the Helston area, she earned a well respected and feared reputation; for traditional Cornish witches have always maintained the ability to cure and to curse.Clients were known to have travelled great distances for a consultation with her, and at certain times people would queue outside her small house in considerable numbers to purchase new charms or have old ones re-empowered, particularly in the springtime when, according to Cornish tradition, a witch’s powers are renewed.We know that she would provide the traditional written and sealed charm bags, as well as small bags o f grave earth, bones and teeth, as well as magical powders; most notably W itch Powder’. She also had a strong reputation for removing curses and healing, working with not only people but cattle and horses.Her powers o f sight were also held in high repute for she would be consulted on the whereabouts o f lost or stolen money, and the identity o f malevolent witches and would work with spirits; making use o f hallucinogenic substances to aid her visions and communications.She had a husband, Jem m y Thomas, who also claimed the powers o f a witch, but for the most part enjoyed a fluctuating reputation for magic, although his obituary celebrated his abilities in providing cures for people and animals and taming the unruly behaviour o f cattle andIntroduction — C ornw all’s W itch Heritage19"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"o f horses; a skill traditional among Cunning men across Britain.The following account, by the 19thC folklorist William Bottrell (18 16 — 1881) whose work recorded a vast body o f traditional Cornish witch-lore, gives a fascinating insight into Tammy and Jem m y’s Pellar’s practice which they operated from their household:From ‘Annual Visit o f the West-Country Folks to the Pellar o f Helston, to have their Protection Renewed’:“ . .A cco rd in g to ancient usage, the f o l k s fr o m m any p a r ts o f the w est country m a k e th e ir a n n u a l pilgrim age to some w hite w itch o f repute, f o r the sa k e o f having w h a t they call “theirprotection renewed. ” T h e spring is alw ays chosen f o r th is object, because i t is believed th a t when the su n is returning the P ellar has m ore p o w er to p ro te c t them fr o m b a d lu c k th a n a t any other season.. . .

She endured hard, little paid and long working days on Helston area farms alongside other women o f her class and community, and was later burdened with the raising o f six children; giving birth to them in her late forties.The magical knowledge gained by her Romany upbringing served her in her later years as she was able to provide a number o f charms, traditional to both the Cunning and Romany folk, to those who consulted her for assistance. Notably these included a small curative bag o f black spiders to be hung in the bedchamber o f the ailing client. She was consulted by girls and young women on matters o f love, the lifting o f curses, and was skilled in the curing o f ringworm in cattle.An amusing incident involving Granny Boswell, often recounted, illustrates perfectly the Cornish tradition o f Wise-folk having the ability not only to provide cures, but to curse, or ‘blast’. During the 1906 elections, Granny Boswell was drinking herself into great intoxication in a Helston inn, as was her custom, when she walked out into the street to observe what may well have been the very firstT r a d itio n a l W itc h c r a ft — Л C o rn ish B o o k o f W a ys24"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"motor car she had ever laid eyes on; brought into Helston to ferry voters to the poll. She stood there in the middle o f the street fascinated by the polished, throbbing and ribbon-bow bedecked machine. The driver, frustrated by this obstacle, told Granny Boswell to move out o f his way in a very harsh manner, blasting at her with the vehicle’s horn. This made Granny Boswell furious and she began shrieking in the foulest o f language at the motorist and informed him that the machine would not even get as far as the other end o f the street. She stormed o ff in a fury, probably for another drink, as the vehicle attempted to continue upon its journey. The thing only managed to get half way down the street before one o f the thick steel tension rods broke clean in two leaving it stranded and requiring a horse to tow it away.Moving west from Helston, deep into remote Penwith, the village o f St Buryan, and the outlying areas, have a long and deeply ingrained association with witchcraft. Cornish witch-lore is rich in stories, collected by folklorists — in particular William Bottrell, about one o f St Buryan’s witches; Betty Trenoweth. It is highly likely that these stories tell o f a real figure, as with much o f folklore there is no smoke without fire, and as Kelvin Jones explains in his book ‘An Joan the Crone - The history and Craft o f the Cornish Witch’; “ nearly all o f Bottrell’s characters can be traced to real families in the west o f Cornwall just prior to the time he was collecting his tales” .It is thought Betty worked at Trove Mill near Lamorna, grinding corn brought in from St Buryan and the surrounding areas.

He would meet her, we are told, in the form o f a great black bull on the northern side o f St Buryan churchyard; an eerie place that is even today no stranger to the activities o f witchcraft.Introduction — C ornw all’s W itch Heritage27"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Whilst undoubtedly there will have been much lost o f the wisdom and practices o f Cornwall’s past Cunning folk, Charmers, ‘White W itches’ and ‘Pellars’ (‘repellers’ o f evil spirits, illness, ill-fortune and ill-wishing in Cornish witchtradition), there is also undoubtedly much that has survived and has been preserved.Alongside the likes o f William Bottrell and Robert Hunt, whose collected tales and conversations with the ordinary folk o f Cornwall in the 19th Century preserved a great body o f lore and folk-belief relating to Cornish witchcraft, we are greatly indebted to the work o f the witchcraft practitioner, collector and researcher Cecil W illiamson (1909 — 1999). The founder o f the Museum o f Witchcraft, first on the Isle o f Man in the ‘W itches’ M ill’ in 19 5 1, relocating several times before setding in the N orth Cornish harbour village o f Boscastle, in 1960, where the museum remains today. Cecil claimed to have first encountered the world o f traditional West- Country witch beliefs as a child in the Devon village o f N orth Bovey. Here he fought to protect an elderly woman, under attack on the village green, from thugs who suspected her o f bewitching cattle. This incident sparked a life long interest in the ways o f country witches and folk-magicians, not as a thing extinct but as a rare yet living practice.Cecil’s Craft interests were very much in the area o f traditional rural folk-magic, and what he termed the Craft o f ‘the wayside witch’. He was not at all fond or approving o f Wicca, however he inadvertently played a major role in its development when he introduced Doreen Valiente to Gerald Gardner, whom he had firstT r a d itio n a l W itc h c r a ft — A C o rn ish Took o f W ays28"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"met in 1946 and had employed as ‘resident witch’ in his museum. Following this introduction, o f course, Doreen Valiente became one o f Gardner’s High Priestesses and went on to produce many beautiful Wiccan ritual texts in her co-authorship o f ‘The Book o f Shadows’ (it must be stated though, that Valiente was really, very much, a traditional Sussex witch).Throughout his collectorship and research o f witchcraft, Cecil remained particularly interested in the craft ways o f his native West Country. He believed the best way to research was to actively practice his area o f study. In addition to encountering witch beliefs through his own clients, it is believed he encountered and learned from eighty two practicing Wise-women. Evidence o f his practice being maintained right up to his death exists in the ‘active’ magical and ritual items discovered in his rooms after his passing and it is clear he pursued the Traditional ‘double-ways’ o f cursing and curing. Through his work, Cecil bequeathed a rich corpus o f West Country witch ways including tools and working impedimenta o f divinatory practice and magical rites o f healing, curse lifting, exorcism and blasting.Cornwall’s rich and extensive array o f preserved and surviving fragments o f lore and practice relating to the rituals o f healing, wort-cunning, procuring o f love, luck and wealth, and the lifting and casting o f curses, provides a rich and fertile foundation from which the ever living practice o f traditional witchcraft and the ‘Pellar Current’ may flourish and continue as a contemporary observance; for it is a way o f life that can never die out entirely. The ingredients necessary for such a continuation remain now as they did in 19thCIntroduction — C ornw all’s W itch Heritage29"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Cornwall; now, as then, there are those called by virtue o f their blood to the Pellar Way. Now, as then, there are those living in this mysterious and relatively unchanged rural landscape who fear supernatural harm, or who seek to improve their situation via supernatural means and are thus willing to seek out and consult a practitioner. Now, as then, there is a rich corpus o f established Cornish magical lore and praxes to inspire and inform the work o f the student Pellar.It cannot be claimed that the ways o f the contemporary practitioner remain unchanged from those o f 19thC and earlier practitioners, for such would be absurd, and to attempt it via unchanging adherence to antiquity does not gain the ‘badge o f authenticity’ but results only in empty ‘historical re-enactment’. Authenticity rests in living practice, which must by its very nature change and evolve with the passage o f time. Honesty and discernment in one’s study and practice and the procuring o f results are the only authenticity stamp there is.The claims o f some historians that traditional witch beliefs and magical practice in Cornwall had died out entirely by the 1940’s and ’50s are unsurprisingly often contradicted by evidence thrown up by their own research; for the age old beliefs in the power o f the curse and o f ill-wishing are still very much alive in this remote landscape. There have continued to be folk-magic practitioners tucked away quietly all over Cornwall, not only rem oving warts but providing charms and preparations for all manner o f needs and reversing the power o f the ill-wish. It is probably because Cornwall was rapidly becoming more influenced by modern ideasT r a d itio n a l W itc h c r a ft — Л C o rn ish Book o f W ays30"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"by the 1940’s and ’50s, causing people to no longer admit openly to such beliefs, for fear o f ridicule, that these activities ceased to be recorded in local newspapers. It would seem this is where historians like to do much o f their research, instead o f actually talking to ordinary folk, as the diligent folklore collectors o f the past had done. It may also be safely said that the modern Cornish folkloric movement, which flourished in this period, was heavily the domain o f the Christian middle class who would be keen to promote the idea that the witch beliefs o f the ordinary Cornish people were a firmly extinct thing o f the past.However, farming families in Cornwall today still pay local practitioners to protect their land and Uvestock from supernatural and mundane harm, and ordinary folk do still consult Cornish Wise Folk to have curses removed. I have even known a Penzance estate agency call in the services o f a local Wise-Woman when selling a certain property had become troublesome, whilst in other areas I believe they call in what is known as a ‘house dresser’ or ‘house doctor’. Here, a house not selling might just as well be put down to negative energies, troublesome spirits or even the ill-wish o f a begrudged witch, as it would poor taste in decor or excess clutter. I myself receive, on a regular basis, requests for curse-lifting. This, alongside magic for matters o f love, is the most requested magic. What may be said to have changed is the request to divine and uncover the identity o f the ill-wisher, a request often put to historical Cornish practitioners. People today, for whatever reason, seem content to just have the curse they are convinced they are suffering from removed and to receive protection fromIntroduction — C ornw all’s W itch Heritage31"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"future ill-wishing. This is not always the case though, for such requests do arise on occasion but it must be said they are a rarity. Despite this slight change and the relative decrease in clientele, the Wise Folk o f Cornwall have gone nowhere. Slight change and decrease are not by any stretch o f the imagination the same thing as extinction. Neither can they be used to argue any un­authenticity o f contemporary practice. This last matter is also true o f the presence o f ‘o ff the shelf’ magical and occult texts available to contemporary practitioners, when one considers that much o f the working knowledge o f historical Cornish Cunning folk, regarding the details o f ritual practice, written charms, planetary virtues and the like, is known to have been learned from the well- known grimoires that were readily available in the 1 9thC from book dealers by mail order. Being inspired by published material is thus no deviation from tradition, it is simply the case that modern practitioners need to exercise greater discernment given the extraordinarily vast and diverse texts available today. Traditionally inclined practitioners tend anyway to draw from material complimentary to the preserved and established lore o f their local Craft.Some have also attempted to organise and ‘pigeonhole’ Cornish magical practitioners into distinct categories, each having their own distinct skills; Cunning Folk, Charmers, White Witches, Conjurers and Pellars - the most powerful o f all. In reality however these terms were quite interchangeable; Tamsin Blight, one o f Cornwall’s most famous practitioners, was recorded under most o f these labels at one time or another.

It was, and is, a Craft o f service; employing whatever abilities were possessed by the individual practitioner to provide for need, be it through divination, spirit conjuration, the making o f charms and substances, the laying on o f hands or the sending forth o f the spirit.Introduction — C ornw all’s W itch Heritage33"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Cunning PathThe Tand, the Serpen ta n d BecomingTH E Craft o f the Cornish witch and Pellar is one o f practical ‘get things done’ magic, or what has been called by others ‘operative’ or ‘results’ witchcraft. Its practitioners; specialists in certain areas some, others being ‘all-rounders’, learn the practical arts o f physical charm and substance making to serve an array o f needs, and magical rites for the exorcising o f evil spirits, healing, the lifting o f curses, for making divinations and so forth. Such ways would be learned, by those with the calling, either alone via intuition, awareness o f local traditional practice and study o f magical texts, or via association and an ‘apprentice’ like relationship with another practitioner, be they a blood relative or not. Small associations, societies, ‘lodges’ and ‘hearths’ o f traditional magical practitioners are known to have existed across the globe, and so it would seem reasonable to assume that our culture should be no different. However, where the Cornish Craft is concerned, the past unavailability o f transport and the hard working lives o f the poor would have meant that the opportunity and free time for such gatherings and35"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"associations would be very scant indeed, and such things, if they occurred, would have been extremely rare, very small and ‘close-knit’. Certainly traditionalist groupings in present day Cornwall, that exist with no such restrictions, may be described in the same way.Once learned, by whatever means, this traditional Craft o f service was nearly always provided in exchange for a fee or trade; for the traditional Craft o f the village practitioner in Cornwall, as in other areas, was primarily a business, very much unlike more modern forms o f the Craft which are primarily a religious pursuit and a form o f spiritual self-help.All this is not to say that the way o f the traditional Cornish witch is without its spiritual side, for the relationship between the Pellar, the world o f spirit and the unseen forces o f the land was, and still is, a very important working relationship.In order to be able to do their job effectively; to work magic, provide wisdom and divine people’s fortunes, the witch needs first to develop this relationship and become attuned to both the physical and spiritual reality o f the land in which they live. The turning o f the seasons, the potent forces within the land and the ‘hidden folk’ all offer useful virtues, powers and wisdom that aid and inform the Pellars’ Craft.The Cunning Path is first trod out in the land where the ‘novice Pellar’ is called to go in search o f the natural forces that will both empower and inform their Craft. For the Cornish witch, one o f the most potent and useful forces is known as the R e d S e rp e n t or S a r f R Jith. This is the spirit force or ‘sprowl’ that flows within the land, animates all living things and empowers the spirit within all natural things; for traditional Cornish witchcraft is an animistT raditional W itchcraft — A Cornish B ook o f Ways36"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"path which acknowledges spirit within such things as stones, streams and buildings. Detecting and harnessing the serpentine flow is o f great importance to the Pellar, and they must know the ways to this and the places where this force will be best drawn forth. The desire to seek these energies and draw upon them, and indeed the ability to do so, should be naturally held within the true witch. It is a thing ‘deeply known’ and the ways o f it are not easily put into words. Often it is just a case o f fine-tuning familiar senses, desires and abilities within those who are starting their way along the path, rather than something alien having to be learned from scratch.It is a regular practice o f witches in Cornwall to walk out into the land to gather sprowl to aid and empower their Craft, such journeys may be known as ‘walking the serpent path’; a path o f power and chthonic gnosis. The Pellar are very sensitive to the landscape in which they live and they know well the places o f power around them from where the sprowl can be best drawn forth and stored for later use; this is how the Cornish witch gathers power. The highly important tool - the Pellar’s staff is the traditional companion upon the serpent path, as the sprowl may be drawn forth and stored within this as well as within the body o f the Pellar. The winding serpent-like paths that flow and meander through fields and valleys, alongside and through the magical thorn-hedge, following streams or along the towering and dramatic sea cliffs, are commonly travelled by the witch who ‘picks up’ sprowl along the way. These serpentine tracks also have magical and meditative uses. The hills, bolder strewn cams and other high places, where the serpent will coil cone-like in the land, are also places where this potent force may be accessed in abundance as well as within the ancientThe Cunning Path37"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"stone circles where the serpent is literally danced alive by the circumambulations o f the witch. In Cornwall these ancient circles are known as ‘dancing stones’ and this is the literal translation o f the Cornish name for the famous Merry Maidens stone circle; Dans Maen. The granite stones o f these ancient and potent places contain a high quartz content which is held by the Wise to attract, and ‘pool’ the serpentine flow o f sprowl.The ‘serpent o f the land’ may be an ancient cousin o f the modern concept o f ‘leys’. Another, older relative is perhaps the ‘fairy paths’, ‘ghost roads’, ‘spirit paths’ or ‘corpse roads’. These linear tracks link ancient tumuli, hill forts and burial grounds and even solitary thorn bushes. Budding upon them or obstructing them was taboo and sure to bring ill fortune for they were held to be where the spirits o f the dead would travel across the land, and those that lead to churchyards were processional funeral routes for carrying the body to burial. These spirit tracks hearken back to the ancestral processional routes across the ancient ritual landscape, and for the Pellar who walks such pathways, or holds vigil upon them, they offer communion with the powers, spirits, and wisdom o f the places linked upon their ways. On the ‘high nights’, when the gates between the worlds may swing ajar, the Pellar might observe the old tradition o f holding vigil in the churchyards; to see who in the village would die within the coming months by looking for their spirit approaching upon the ‘corpse road’. It was also the practice o f the Cornish witch to conduct spirit divinations by sitting upon a stone stile on a known fairy path in order to interrogate passing spirits for wisdom.Wisdom may also be gleaned from the serpent. At times, especially at the full o f the moon when the serpentT raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish B ook o f W ays38"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"is most potent and generative, the Wise are drawn down into the openings o f the earth; down into the sea caves, fogous and the holy wells, for in these damp, dark wombs o f the land a hypnotic force issues forth from the serpent and ‘pools’ in abundance, this is known as the ‘serpents breath’ or simply ‘snake breath’. In such places haunted by the ‘breath’, the Wise drowse in this force to commune with the ‘earth spirit’ and receive visions, hear voices, heal and make magic.In the time approaching new moon the Serpent becomes an introspective and consumptive force; the Pellar needs to take great care with it for it can be a destructive force, but if utilised wisely the dark serpent can be a useful force for traditional ‘get-rid-of ’ magic, introspective vision and underworld encounters with the spirit folk.The ability to work with ‘spirit force’ and the serpent, and indeed to better detect and perceive such things, requires the witch to enter a state o f mind which takes the consciousness slightly ‘between the worlds’, or, as Cornish witches put it, ‘between the horns’ or ‘between the Buccas’. This has also become known within the Traditional Craft as the ‘mystery o f Becoming’. The witch becomes more acutely aware o f not only the physicality o f their surroundings but the spiritual or ethereal reality o f ‘all’, along with a strong sense or realisation that they are connected to and part o f ‘all’, both in spirit and in physicality, to the furthest reaches — a state o f being central to many Cunning traditions o f the British Isles. For the witch, this state o f awareness between the worlds and connection to ‘all’ is not restricted by distance. This is what allows the witch to perform acts o f ‘distant magic’ or ‘absent healing’ and to direct their Will and power to wherever it is needed, to bring about the desired magicalThe Cunning Path39"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"change in an act that is known as ‘sending forth the spirit’. Only when the witch has achieved this ability, can they then focus their intent upon the target and utilise and direct their powers, in accordance with their Will, to effect changes upon places, beings and objects.As well as being proficient in ‘hands on healing’, many o f the Cunning Folk o f Cornwall were known to practice acts o f absent healing in this way through ‘Becoming’, indeed one may hear o f Charmers in Cornwall successfully healing clients as far away as Australia. Often, during an act o f distant magic, the practitioner will make use o f such things as cords, stones, candles and pins or ‘poppets’ representing the magical target. This gives the physical body, in particular the hands, something to do in tune with the working, whilst the magical Will and intent is ‘sent forth’ to the actual target or recipient o f the spell; often with the aid o f a familiar spirit.Seeking to perfect and maintain this natural ability should be at first the sole work o f the novice witch, for without this ability no magic or divinatory work is possible. Each practitioner will have their own way o f Becoming and it becomes a quick and instinctive function for the experienced witch; only the individual can know when this has been achieved. There are traditional techniques that can aid the achievement o f Becoming, using tools, ritual movement and the burning o f certain herbs. For some, simply standing and feehng a connection with the land below and the sky above, letting the mind slip to a place betwixt, can induce Becoming. Another way is to do the same, but instead o f being still, one might walk a slow sinistral or anti-clockwise circle, for all repetitive movements and tasks are helpful, turning the consciousness away from the everyday, rational world, toT raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish B ook o f Ways40"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"a place between the worlds. This method may also have the benefit, if it is done well, o f stirring and gathering sprowl, which can be drawn upon when the desired state o f mind is achieved.A traditional Cornish witches’ tool useful for inducing trances and the state o f Becom ing is the Troy Stone; also known as a ‘Mazey Stone’ from the Cornish ‘mazed’ meaning to be o f a maddened, en-tranced or intoxicated state. This is traditionally a slab o f slate carved with a uni-cursal labyrinth. One method o f use is to sit with the stone on the lap, or on a table o f comfortable height in a room lit dimly by a single candle, and to slowly follow the labyrinth’s path repeatedly in and out with the left index finger whilst rocking or swaying gently and humming rhythmically.However, by far the best way to achieve the states o f mind and natural wisdom useful to the witch is to simply be in the land, to walk, find a place to setde, maybe in a place o f liminality — ‘places between’ seen by the Wise as useful intersections between the worlds; such as a break in a hedge, a stile, upon a cliff or beside a stream, and simply sit, watch, feel and listen, but try not to think too much! One must become quiet in body and in thought to be receptive to the wisdom that deep observation o f the comings and goings o f nature can bring, and the potent forces o f the landscape so vital to the working o f the Craft. It is difficult to put such things into words; for the way o f the Wise is instinctive and intuitive. It is the mark o f the true witch for such things to come naturally and for it to be part o f one’s natural behaviour to seek this relationship with the land.The Cunning Path41"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Dead and the OtherworldThe Faery Faith in CornwallTO D A Y in Cornwall, at least a vague knowledge o f the Piskies, Knockers and Spriggans as quaint elements o f Cornish folklore and legend is fairly widespread; however, active belief and observance o f the Cornish ‘Faery Faith’ is extremely rare, and only survives amongst a very few o f the very elderly and o f course the witches, Cunning, Wise-folk and Pellar o f Cornwall.In Cornwall, the Otherworld is never far away, it exists just at the liminal edge o f normal sight, where the otherworldly comings and goings may occasionally be glimpsed out o f the corner o f one’s eye. Slipping from this world into Annown, often quite accidentally, was never as difficult a thing as it may sound.For the Cornish, the Piskies, have always been the spirits o f the dead; a Piskie and a ghost were seen as being very much the same thing. It may confidently be said that Cornwall was long a place o f dual-observance; for whilst the populace would almost always have professed to be good Christians, there is absolutely nothing Christian about the Faery Faith, and it was staunchly and steadfastly43"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"believed in, and observed, by the ordinary folk o f Cornwall until relatively recently.For the very Christian folk, who believed the souls o f the dead must go to heaven, their parallel belief in the Otherworld and the Piskies presented a problem; a solution had to be found to accommodate these strong old beliefs which refused to be buried. One solution they thought up was that the Piskies were the spirits o f the ancient dead, our Pagan ancestors who dwell in the Otherworld reality o f the Cornish landscape, along side the living and having no knowledge o f the heaven o f the Christians. One old story collected by William Bottrell, ‘Fairy Dwelling on Selena M oor’, illustrates this view; the Piskies are described as being “ not o f our religion but star-worshippers” . Other notions arose that the Piskies were the spirits o f un-baptised children who could not be admitted into heaven, yet had not lived long enough to commit any sins to warrant their going to hell. Another interesting Christian justification for the Piskies was that they were the old Pagan Gods o f Cornwall and that since the birth o f Christ they had been forever diminishing in size, until they became muryans (ants), and would one day vanish altogether. It was thus taboo in Cornwall to destroy a muryans’ nest, and it was believed that if a piece o f tin were placed in such a nest during the time o f the new moon, the old Gods, in their ant-form, still had enough power left to turn the tin into silver. This is interesting, for it is not normally the case for Christians to acknowledge the existence o f other Gods, or to pay them respect through their harming being held taboo, nor to retain faith in their magical powers to transform the base into the precious. All this would again seem to pointT raditional W itchcraft — A . C ornish B ook o f Ways44"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"to attitudes o f dual-observance amongst the nominally Christian Cornish populace.The attempts o f the new religion to accommodate the Cornish spirit world o f the old were not taken on board by everyone, and for many the Otherworld was simply the dwelling place o f the spirits o f the dead, and to become a Piskie was the fate o f all who pass from the world o f the living. There are accounts in Cornish stories o f people slipping accidentally between the worlds and observing the activities o f the Piskies, where among their number are recognisable deceased loved ones and the familiar faces o f the recendy dead, but now in Piskie form. Descriptions o f the Piskies or ‘Pobel Vean’ (small people) generally reveal them to be no more than two feet in height, the women o f fair complexion, whilst the men are darker, swarthy in appearance. Red cloaks, or sometimes caps and clothes o f green are described. By night they are described as young and beautiful, but if seen by day they appear old, wrinkled and liver-spotted. Behind the later attempts o f Cornish Christianity to explain and accommodate the Cornish spirit-world (and we must be grateful that such attempts were made, for it allowed, in however small a way, the old Faery Faith to survive in Cornwall), there are very old death-traditions, which maintain that the deceased remain as spirit folk in Annown — the Otherworld, a world that was closely interwoven with the world o f the living. An interesting relationship existed between the ‘ordinary folk’ and the inhabitants o f the Cornish spirit world and there were a few traditional ways o f interaction, which today continue mostly amongst those o f the Cunning-way and those few elderly folk who remember.The Dead and the Otherworld45"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Like all things, the Piskie have their light and their dark sides. They were known to be compassionate to the poor, and would help by carrying out much o f their labours through the night such as threshing corn or doing household chores. They were also known to take vengeance on rich folk who took advantage o f the poor. If, however, the Piskie knew they had been spied upon whilst carrying out these helpful tasks, and were rewarded, they would disappear and never return, for it is a common thread that the Piskie hate being watched by the living. The only permitted interaction was for the living to make simple offerings o f food and warmth to a Piskie, and the Piskie would be beneficial to the running o f the household, but otherwise wished to be left well alone.Table scraps would often be left over night for the Piskie, on the hearth (the ancient altar and original sacred centre o f the home) or at the back door. A special treat for them was milk and a saffron bun with a knob o f butter on it. Accounts in Cornwall tell o f cats being ill after drinking milk left out for a Piskie, who would have drunk the ‘astral’ part o f it; what remained would have disagreed with any living being who drank it, thus the physical remains o f these offerings would be best poured away on the earth outside or buried the next morning. On particularly cold and stormy nights, old Cornish folk have been known to put down a good fire o f furze (gorse) to provide the wandering spirits some comfort. Given that the Piskie were seen as the spirits o f the dead, the regular provision o f food offerings and comforting fires could be viewed as the survival o f a form o f ancestor worship amongst the Cornish.T raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W ays46"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Dead and the OtherworldPiskie are also known for their mischievous tendencies; causing knocks and tapping noises around the cottage was a common annoyance, as was the hiding o f small household objects. The usual remedy for this was to make food offerings to the spirits to calm their behaviour. A local Pellar could also be called in to provide, in exchange for the appropriate fee, a spirit house to calm troublesome spirits and keep them content.Another Piskie mischief, often suffered by folk in Cornwall, and I admit to having been a victim myself, was that o f becoming ‘Piskie-lead’. There are many tales o f people walking out in some lonely place when a strange mist descended and the walker completely lost their path, even if it was a route well known to them, often leaving the vicdm walking around in a circle for hours — a frustrating and sometimes frightening ordeal that still occurs today. Such occurrences o f being Piskie-lead may occur at the liminal times o f midnight or dusk, for these times are when the veil between the worlds grows even thinner and the paths o f humans and the spirits may more easily cross. The traditional defence against being Piskie- lead was to turn an article o f clothing inside-out. Usually, to stop the situation once it had begun a glove would be turned inside-out and thrown to the ground, whereby the mists would clear and the path would again be found. It became a common practice for folk to wear their coats inside out when walking from one village to another at night. Other tales tell o f times when a human, out at night, has accidentally come upon a gathering o f the Piskie, for they are fond o f holding ‘fairs’ where music, dancing and feasting are enjoyed in some haunted and isolated spot. Such spirit revels remind one o f the Otherworldly Sabbatic47"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"gatherings o f witches. If the human onlooker made their presence known, the spirit gathering would vanish in an instant, and the human might be subjected to torments from many unseen hands, ranging from being relentlessly pinched to receiving a sound beating! Following tradition, the victim would struggle to remove a piece o f clothing to turn inside out and stop the torment. Tales such as these again served to warn the Cornish o f the dangers o f spying on the activities o f the Piskie Folk.Cornish witches have knowledge o f an ointment called ‘Piskie Ointment’ which, if used to anoint the corner o f one eye, allows the user to see the spirits normally invisible to the living. This green salve is made from a recipe o f herbs which some say are best gathered from Kerris moor. Once made it must be poured in to a croggan (limpet shell) to set. As Cornish tradition maintains; the Piskie cannot abide the sea, nor things that come from it, they will not be able to steal the ointment in order to prevent the witch from spying on them. Cornish witch- lore teaches though, that the use o f this ointment is very dangerous for two reasons: It can entrap the user into an obsessive desire to watch the spirit world, and lose interest in the world o f the living, and secondly, the user must take the strongest care not to react in any way to what they see o f the spirits’ goings on. They must act as if they are oblivious to them, for if the Piskie become aware that they are being spied upon they will strike the anointed eye and it shall be rendered blind thereafter.The Knockers, spirits o f the mines, were another Cornish spirit tribe whose existence interwove with that o f living folk.

Given the extremely hazardous nature o f mining, these taboos would be obeyed with some enthusiasm.Spriggans are another tribe o f Cornish spirits whose paths should hopefully never have to cross those o f the living; for these entities are the fearsome spirit guardians o f Cornwall’s sacred landscape, and the hidden treasures o f the ancient peoples. They are remarkably effective in striking terror into the hearts o f those who attempt to damage the places o f power, or dig the ancient sites in search o f treasure.

In Britain the old rural witches’ god was often referred to as ‘Devil’, and this is still the case for many Crafters in many areas and is still true in Cornwall.The Devil o f the traditional witch is not quite the same thing, o f course, as the Satan o f ‘Churchianity’, but is instead intended as the old chthonic folk-god o f the land mysteries and o f seasonal changes (particularly the Autumn and Winter months), weather (particularly storms), death mysteries and the unseen forces and gnosis o f use to witchcraft.This concept o f deity as the very embodiment o f the land mysteries and the spirit o f nature is found in the beliefs o f the Romany folk, for whom G od is D e v e l and the Earth is D e D eveleski; the Divine Mother. The ways, beliefs and magic o f the Rom and the witch have many similarities and it is certainly true that many practicing Cunning folk were, and are, o f Romany stock.51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"To traditional witches and Cunning folk in Cornwall, in particular the Penwith region, the old Horned One is known as Тисса, and in West Devon as Tuckie. The meanings o f this mysterious and misunderstood deity are complex and have been lost to most. Commonly thought o f today as a kind o f Cornish goblin or ‘naughty e lf’, but still acknowledged as a powerful deity in Cornwall by those few aligned to Cunning practice and the Pellar way.The most common misinterpretation is that Bucca was a sea deity. This idea has arisen chiefly from the fact that some fishermen in Newlyn used to offer a portion o f their catch to Bucca on the sand and at the now lost Park-an-Grouse; The Field of the Cross’, which is an area o f Newlyn where a stone cross once stood and was a focus for Bucca’s veneration. The exact location o f this site in Newlyn is now unknown. To offer something to a sea deity that already belonged to it in the first place just doesn’t seem to fit, and ritual offerings to the sea are usually o f land produce such as ale or flowers. Also, offerings to the sea would normally be made to the sea itself, not to a cross on the land and (as anyone who lives in Cornwall should know) any fish left on the sand would stand a very slim chance indeed o f remaining there long enough to be claimed by the incoming tide; they would more likely be swiped by the ever watchful seagulls who, by some unknown magic, descend en-masse out o f nowhere the very moment something even vaguely edible hits the ground.As well as fishermen, farmers also made offerings to Bucca. ‘Mouthfuls’ o f ale would be spilled upon the ground and a portion o f bread thrown over the left shoulder to ensure a good harvest. Areas o f farm land were sacrificed and left to grow wild to become ‘Bucca’s Land’. The areaT raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W ays52"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Buccaknown as ‘Chybucca’, meaning ‘Bucca’s Dwelling’, near Truro is about as inland as mid-west Cornwall gets. The site may once have been the location o f some Bucca’s Land. Farmers are very unlikely to have been bothered at all about sea deities and much less likely to sacrifice a portion o f their land to one. However, one thing that is o f vital concern to both fishermen and farmers alike is the weather. This reveals that Bucca is more properly a god o f the weather, much o f which comes inland over the sea, rather than a sea deity specifically.In Cornish lore, Bucca manifests in the mysterious duality o f Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu; the White G od and the Black God. Bucca Dhu is synonymous with the Devil o f British folk belief, and is associated with storms and the winter months, whilst Bucca Gwidder may be associated with fair weather, nourishing rains and the summer months. As storms come rolling in across the land, it is said that Bucca Dhu is riding. On dark and cold nights o f winter, Bucca Dhu is also described as riding a great black horse with blazing red eyes and smoky breath. Such lore surrounding Bucca Dhu is cognate with the widespread folk traditions o f the Devil and Odin/Woden, as leaders o f the Wild Hunt, which in British tradition runs along the Abbot’s Way towards Cornwall; the last stop en route to the Otherworld. Each o f these figures is heavily associated with the winter months, stormy nights, the death mysteries and passage to and from the Otherworld:‘intimations o f his approach can perhaps be sensed in dark windswept woods in early winter, when the roar o f the gale shakes the tree tops and cloud-rack scuds over the cold stars — it is then that one truly knows that he is hunting.. . ” Nigel Aldcroft Jackson, Call o f the Horned Piper.53"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The old associations between Bucca Dhu, the Devil and Odin, come together in the traditions surrounding another mysterious location in Newlyn - the Tolcarne. Known also as ‘The Devil’s Rock’, the Tolcarne is a natural outcropping o f rocks, high above St. Peter’s Church. The legend o f ‘The Devil at the Tolcarne’ tells o f the day the devil fancied indulging in a spot o f fishing and so stole nets from the Newlyn and Mousehole fishermen. When his theft was discovered, the Devil was pursued by members o f Paul Church choir who chanted the Apostle’s Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. Distracted by this din, the devil tripped and left his footprint and markings from the nets in the rock where they fell. Furious, the Devil stood and flapped his great wings whilst fiercely spitdng at the choir; “ BU C K A H ! BU C K A H ! BU C K A H !!!’ emitting all the time fire and sulpherous fumes from his mouth.Another tradition, ‘The Tolcarne Troll’, tells o f an entity dwelling within the rock itself ‘since the time o f the Phoenicians’. The Tolcarne Troll is interestingly known locally as ‘Odin the wanderer’, and is described as ‘pleasant faced’ and dressed in a tight-fitting hooded leather jerkin. According to local lore, it was possible to call upon the Tolcarne troll by reciting a secret Cornish charm whilst holding three dried leaves; one o f oak, one o f ash, and one o f thorn. Once called, the Tolcarne troll had the power to grant insight into one’s past lives by revealing himself as the enquirer in any state they had existed in previous incarnations. All one had to do was name the age or period.Heavily associated with such Otherworldly and stormy divinities as Bucca D hu/D evil and Odin, is the horse. Within the Cunning Craft traditions there exists a wealth o f magical equine lore in which the horse is emblematicT raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish B ook o f W ajs54"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Buccao f the vehicle via which power may travel forth. In Heathen practice the horse became the vehicle for the power o f blasting, via the ‘spite stake’ — being the skull o f a horse, set open jawed upon a pole and, stood facing the direction o f the quarry o f the curse or banishment. Horse skulls, and carved wooden representations o f horse heads, were also commonly hung high within the rafters o f stables and livestock shelters, placed above entrances, or buried beneath thresholds and employed as ‘concealed charms’, all as powerful fetishes o f protection. Horse skulls were also placed beneath, or even in, the sick bed; thus we see the horse was regarded as the vehicle also for the protections and healing blessings o f the divine force.Often it is the skull o f a mare that is specifically called for; to protect the garden, encourage the healthy and abundant growth o f plants, herbs and crops, and to ward o ff vermin, the skull o f a mare was to be stood upon a pole within the garden. Such a charm reveals the Traditional Craft associations o f the mare skull as vessel and representation o f the Goddess o f the fertile and verdant earth.The witch’s staff, within most expressions o f the Traditional persuasion, is known as ‘the horse’. Here the witch’s staff is cognate with Yggdrasil — ‘the horse o f the hanged’ or ‘Odin’s horse’, via which the ways below, above, and the four ways o f the middle world may be traversed and their virtues accessed. Thus the horse becomes the vehicle by which the Pellar may go forth in egress, and the vessel by which the virtues and powers are brought into the circle.

Via these, the masculine principle o f fiery force and ‘witch power’ may be drawn forth, from the depths to the heights. Likewise, these feminine principles are embodied within the traditional broom o f the witch; constructed o f an ashen staff (air), a birch brush (earth) and bound by willow (water). The traditional feminine broom becomes the steed and vehicle o f fiery sexual force and spirit flight between the worlds, and is thus the ‘bridge’ in and out o f the witch’s circle.Within the circles o f the Cunning, the mare is not only the vehicle o f force and virtue, be it drawn in or sent forth via the shaft o f staff, broom, wand or cord, and a means o f traversing the worlds, she is emblematic also o f the dark Goddess as vehicle o f the ‘wild hunt’ and night terrors. Her face is that also o f the Ankow, drawing her death-cart to convey souls to the Otherworld. Hers is also the white face o f the fertile goddess o f the verdant earth; cross culturally also associated with seasonal change, the passage o f the sun, and the very vehicle o f its cyclic journey o f growth and decline through the year. The Hindu god o f the sun, Surya, is drawn forth by seven mares, vehicles o f fiery divine force and seasonal changes. Closer to home we have the skull-topped pole ‘Oss tradition, in Brittany and in Wales; where the various Mari Lwyd — ‘Grey Mare’ — ‘Osses dance through the streets around the Winter Solstice; the time o f the sun’s death and rebirth. The pole ‘Oss tradition exists also in West Cornwall where it is under revival. In Penwith, the Penglaz — ‘Grey Head’ — ‘Osses have over the past eighteen or so years re-emerged to attend seasonal festivals with striking mare skulls crowned with appropriate greenery and draped in tatters.

Whilst a Penglaz ‘Oss, as a revived figure, is essentially a mystery; a potent set o f symbolism is undoubtedly presented, and it is only inescapable human nature to find meaning in such symbols; a process that has over the years undoubtedly occurred. It is perhaps fortuitous that Penglazes fit very nicely with already extant traditions o f the mare as representative o f seasonal passage, the mare skull as a protective fetish o f divine blessing, the horse as the vehicle o f power and likewise traditionally the vehicle o f Bucca Dhu, the Devil and Odin.Within Ros An Bucca, and the beliefs and practices o f others within the Cornish Craft, Bucca Dhu is the storm god associated with the winter months, the inner worlds, introspection, dark and defensive magic and the new moon. Bucca Dhu is seen to rule from Allantide to May’s Eve. Bucca Gwidder is thus the fair god, associated with fair weather, the summer months, light nourishing rains, generative and healing magic and the full moon. Bucca Gwidder is seen to rule from May’s Eve to Allantide. Both Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu however are associated traditionally with mischief and unpredictability (reminiscent rather o f Cornwall’s remarkable and famously changeable weather). This may be seen as something o f a paradox when considering Bucca Dhu’s introspective association; however, introspection can take us to the deeper animalistic parts o f our being.Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu together embody the opposing forces within nature and within ourselves, the flip-side o f each other; light-dark, life-death, generation- consumption, above-below etc. There is much wisdom to be gained in meditating on the opposing forces o f Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu; they are both intimately bound, each leading both from and to the other: Light57"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"emerges from the darkness, life leads ultimately to death from where life re-emerges, generation must be fuelled by consumption and what is generated will itself be consumed, as above so below ... An understanding o f this leads on to the realisation that the opposing are but different points o f one process; opposite ends o f a journey are still one journey and ultimately are the same thing, just as opposite points o f a circle are still one circle, thus mystically Bucca Gwidder is Bucca Dhu; light is dark, life is death, generation is consumption and above is below.Here we may ultimately find in Bucca a mystic triplicity; for Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu conjoin in Bucca Gam; The Grand Bucca and the great Horned Androgyne, the Sabbatic Goat and Goddess-God o f the witch-way. For some the Grand Bucca is simply referred to as Bucca, being the whole, with the two opposing aspects o f that whole being given the distinction o f Bucca Gwidder and Bucca Dhu. In Bucca we find the resolving o f all opposites, the traditional candle betwixt the horns symbolising the light o f All-W isdom ’, and the mystic state o f ‘One- pointedness’ which is the ultimate goal o f the witch and is the light that illumines the Cunning Path. This state is achieved by the process o f resolving all opposites within to become balanced and whole, rather than polarising and separating opposites; sticking them firmly at either end o f an enormous imaginary pole, as has become the practice in some modern forms o f the Craft. The Pellar will seek inwardly in their rites to become both female and male, dark and light, below and above and so forth in an act o f inner alchemy. To embody this is a huge task, and is literally to seek to become ‘as the gods’, but nevertheless to walk the path o f the Cunning is to strive ever towards the light o f wisdom betwixt the horns o f oppose.T raditional W itchcraft — Л Cornish B ook o f W ays58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The BuccaThe Androgyne o f the Wise, the Rebis, Double Matter and Hermaphrodite are well known to Alchemy, where transcendence o f gender and the resolving o f opposites are taught in the search for the O ccultum T a p id e m, the ‘Hidden Stone’, seen by some to represent the attainment o f ‘All-W isdom’. However the acknowledgment o f Hermaphrodite or Androgyne Deities may be seen to be relatively rare within Occult circles today. The most well known example o f the Divine Androgyne today is perhaps the Baphomet; as depicted famously by Eliphas Levi.The worship o f the white and black Goat-Gods however was widespread amongst witches worldwide, and the goat image remains central to many Craft traditions today, although the true meaning behind the light betwixt the horns has been largely forgotten.Could Bucca possibly have origins in a worldwide ancient androgyne or dualistic goat-form deity? We find traditional names for the G oat-God in Britain that seem to have a common derivation, such as Bwca, Pwca, Pouca and Puck, the latter still being used in parts o f Ireland to refer to a goat. Abroad we find examples; along the northern border o f Italy, witches acknowledge a nature spirit in the form o f a great red goat with a white spot betwixt the horns, possibly representing the light o f ‘all­wisdom’. The names for this spirit are given variously as Bee, Becco, Bouc, Boucan and Buc. In Sweden we have the intriguingly named Bukkerwise, a mummers’ play featuring the dying and resurrecting Goat-God, married to the Queen o f the May. In Slavic Paganism we have the twin gods Bielobog, or ‘white god’ and his shadow-self, Czernobog, or ‘black god’ with the words ‘bog’ (god) and ‘bucca’ possibly sharing the same linguistic root.59"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"P la c e s o f P o w e rMA N Y are the places that provide some useful virtue, wisdom or potency that the Pellar may draw upon to aid them in the working o f their Craft.

Sacred stories were told around the hearth-fire, guidance from the spirits was divined within its flames and the hearth was the very altar for all domestic rites o f worship and communion with the gods, the land powers, and with the beloved dead.For the witches, Charmers and Cunning folk, the hearth has retained many o f these ancient associations and usages, and provides the ‘working surface’.

This makes the skill o f observation all the more important. It is a fact, known to the Wise, that people often make their own problems. It is also known that there are people who are very similar, in outlook, behaviour, personality and character, these people will often have similar problems with similar causes and more often than not the solutions will be similar.

To effectively establish the Circle o f Cunning the magical crossroads must be conjured and the sign o f the three crossed roads is made at the start o f each working to signify that contact with otherworldly forces is desired and is about to take place.The crossroads is a place, traditionally, where the Cornish witch will make conjurations seeking the aid o f the spirits or the old one, to make curses or to work traditional forms o f ‘get rid o f ’ magic.Fuggy HolesFuggy Holes; caves and fogous (ancient West Cornish underground passages or chambers) are purely places o f the underworld, for there is nothing betwixt or between about them; when one enters such places one has crossed the hedge entirely from the world o f the living into the world o f spirits.65"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Powerful places o f vision, magic and initiation; they have much to offer the Wise.

Here rites are worked with this potent force, drawing deeply o f the Serpent’s Breath, breathing it, drowsing in it, and becoming possessed by it; the Wise receive visions from which wisdom is extracted, and they are re-empowered and recharged with the chthonic serpentine and lunar virtue, which will provide extra potency to their workings o f magic and healing.T raditional W itchcraft — Л Cornish B ook o f W aysHoly WellsCornwall’s many holy wells, like fuggy holes, are also places where at the time o f the full moon the Serpent’s Breath may issue forth in greater and more concentrated abundance than at other places, for they are themselves otherworldly portals where the potent serpentine waters o f the earth arise. Here also this force is traditionally utilised for magical potency, vision and healing.66"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"As well as being places o f inherent curative and divinatory powers, Cornish holy wells are seen to be places o f indwelling spirits to whom offerings would be made in hope o f vision, foretelling or healing. Fenton Bebibell near the Men-an-Tol stones, as its name in Cornish reveals, is quite literally the well o f the little people. Here girls would venture on G ood Friday to bless their dolls in the well water. This perhaps reveals folk memories o f the worship o f the ancestral spirits or little folk at this place, or the blessing and naming o f babies. The lost well has recently been rescued by volunteers, and the tradition o f G ood Friday doll blessing has been revived at this enchanting and magical holy well.There are traditional patterns o f practice held in common by many o f Cornwall’s holy wells, and these practices were conducted quite regularly until a relatively late period. The better known practice o f cloutie hanging, most notably at Madron, perhaps Cornwall’s most famous holy well, is an old spell for healing.The practice o f leaving clouties survives at Madron Well with gusto, however most are left today in the trees where water lies beside the path to the old baptistery, for the actual location o f the well is quite difficult to access and not widely known. Clouties are now a common sight at many other wells, although the very briefest examination o f the vast majority o f modern-day clouties reveals that the true meaning, and purpose o f the spell, has been lost to most. Sadly it seems to have become habitual behaviour to garrotte the limbs o f any tree that dares grow in the vicinity o f a holy well with any old piece o f synthetic tat.The practice o f bathing in, or passing children through, the waters are also healing rites that were once common atPlaces o f Power67"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"a number o f holy wells.

The practice o f bending pins to offer into the waters in return for divinatory counsel seems to hark back to the practice, common to many ancient cultures worldwide, o f purposefully damaging fine metal objects, such as swords and jewellery, before offering them into the depths o f sacred lakes and other bodies o f water, which were regarded as doorways into the Otherworld.For the Charmers, holy wells are places to commune with the spirits; to seek vision; to regain strength, magical potency and virtue from the serpentine flow; to empower their magic and their healing and also to bless and re­empower their tools o f the healing Craft.T raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W aysSacred StonesCornwall, Penwith in particular, is extremely rich in ancient sacred sites o f stone, including circles, menhirs and quoits. These enigmatic sites are o f great importance to the Cunning folk, not least because they were o f great importance and use to our ancient sacred ancestors. Whilst the exact details o f the original ancient uses and meanings o f many o f these ancient sites may present us with a mystery, keys and clues may be seen held within their folklore, and the Charmers, Cunners and witches o f Cornwall have always had their very effective uses for these ancient and sacred places o f power.68"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The great stone circles, also known by the local Wise- folk as ‘dancing stones’, are temples o f the land and chthonic force, where the serpentine flow may spiral and pool within the rings o f granite, a rock o f high quartz content, which, like the serpentine flow, is held within the Craft to be responsive to the lunar tides. Here, at the full moon, the quartz rich stones channel and enhance the flow o f the serpent, thus they become places where this potent, generative and hypnotic force can be danced alive, and utilised in great abundance so that very powerful, deep, and far reaching magic may be done.At such places the witch may become the vehicle for an extremely potent force. When the moon is dark, the granite rings pool the serpentine force in its consumptive phase. Here magic to be rid o f things, to end things and to curse may be done to great effect, but care is needed when working magic o f this kind and with this dangerous force, concentrated at such places, for it can be costly.The menhirs or standing stones, o f which Cornwall has many, may be seen to be marker stones o f the spirit paths, or paths o f ‘land force’. The archeological finding o f human remains, as either bone or ash, reveals a link with the dead. Whether or not the stones were erected to mark these burials, or the burials were made as foundation offerings to the stones upon their erection is unknown. They are places for the Wise to commune with the ancestors, with the wisdom and forces o f the land, to walk the paths o f spirit and to travel the worlds above and below, for such stones unite the sky with the depths o f the earth.The Men-an-Tol (stone with the hole) is one o f Penwith’s most mysterious ancient sacred sites.

However, like most o f Cornwall’s ancient sacred stones, the Men-an-Tol is alive and o f use and great importance to the living today, despite the mysteries surrounding its uses and meanings to our ancient ancestors.Like the holy wells, the magic made at the Men-an-Tol included workings o f divination and healing. To employ the stone’s divinatory powers, two brass pins would be crossed on the very top o f the holed stone so that one was balanced across the other. The movement o f the top pin would be read for the answers to any questions put to it, to point out a direction or to give a ‘yes’ or ‘no’.The holed stone has been seen very much as a powerful portal o f healing, transformation and rebirth. It is most widely used today for healing, for it is not uncommon to see visitors climbing through the hole nine or three times against the sun, in hope o f a cure for their ills, or to witness babies and young children being passed through the hole for the same.The fact that these very old practices are still common occurrences at the Men-an-Tol is testament to the site’s powerful and enduring reputation.For the Pellar, this magical portal is also employed within rites o f rebirth and renewal, and to symbolically ‘birth’ or give life to magical dolls, bones, skulls and other items to house a familiar or working spirit. Such objects have life breathed into them and are passed ritually through the stone, and then the spirit is named, perhaps by giving it a ‘baptism’ at the nearby Fenton Bebibell.T raditional W itchcraft — A Cornish T o o k o f W ays70"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The ‘spirit houses’ o f the Cornish landscape are the quoits, cromlechs (Cornish for curved place) and barrows.

They can have ways o f making themselves known that range from the subtle to the fairly dramatic. I have known folk choose branches that they have tripped over, got their hair or clothes snagged on or that have literally smacked them in the face! I have often used ‘dead’ or fallen wood that is still strong. This for me feels ‘complete’, for it has risen up from the earth, lived, died and fallen back to the earth again. Green or living wood however is more reliably strong. When deciding to harvest such wood, it is good practice to let the tree know that you intend to take that particular branch, tie a piece o f string around where you intend to make the cut andThe Tools o f C unning77"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"leave it there for a week or so, letting the tree get used to the idea. D o not take more than you need and never attempt to break o ff the branch; use a sharp pruning saw to make a clean cut. It is better to harvest green wood in the winter as there will be less sap, making the wood less likely to split as it dries. Drying can take around a year to do properly, and the ends should be sealed by dipping them in a pot o f hot molten wax as they will otherwise quickly split. Dead wood o f course does not suffer so much from splitting and is quicker to dry. A handy recipe, given by Cornish Pellar JackDaw, could reduce the drying time o f ‘green wood’ sticks to three months: Mix 1 part Olive oil with 5 parts turpentine and rub the mixture into the stick once a week.When it comes to finishing your staff, it is best to coat the wood several times with boiled linseed oil. This brings out the richness o f the wood and can be polished pleasingly. Natural beeswax polishes are also good. Whether or not the bark is left on depends much on the type o f wood and the drying process, where it may start to separate from the wood anyway and will have to be stripped, otherwise it may be best to leave the bark on.The personal staff o f a Pellar tends not to be overly dramatic, nor overtly occult in its appearance. Such a staff tends instead to appear much like any other thumb or walking stick, all be it a particularly fine and attractive example, with which its bearer wouldn’t look at all out o f place walking in the countryside, or into any country pub. However, within what may appear to others nothing more than decorative design, various pertinent witch signs may be concealed and made occult in plain sight.

It may be the witch’s personal staff, or a special Hazel example kept only for this purpose. It is better used during the time o f the full moon, and at a known place o f power where the serpentine ‘pulse’ is strong. The witch will kneel and drive the stick into the ground at an angle, so that the rounded forked ends rest gently against the closed eyes. The Becoming will be undertaken, and then the witch will feel for the flow o f the Red Serpent in the earth, conducted along the stick. The rhythm o f this flow will eventually bring visions o f foresight and the answers to questions, such as the whereabouts o f anything that is lost or stolen.Another stick tool for making discoveries is, o f course, the better known Y shaped divining rod, cut also from Hazel. Wise folk traditionally employed these, when called in by farmers and land owners, to divine for water, a service still widely provided today. The diviner’s rod can o f course be used to locate other things. The two forks o f the rod are held in the hands, palms upwards and pulling outwards, thus applying tension to the rod until it resembles the sign for Aries, with the lower point facing away from the body and the whole thing level with the ground. The diviner will then walk, holding in the mind that which is being sought without thinking too much.

This stick is used within magical rites to ‘gather in’ desired virtues, by the witch gesturing repeatedly with it to literally ‘hook’ and pull in that which is required, whilst facing a pertinent direction within the circle. When sufficient required virtue has been gathered, it is sent forth, via the pointed end, in the direction o f the place, person, animal or item intended to receive it.The ‘Blasting Rod’ is the famous and feared blackthorn staff, employed by witches in Cornwall and other areas to direct curses or punishments upon wrongdoers, to send them ‘the fear’, and to stop the continuation o f their wrongful ways.T raditional W itchcraft — Л Cornish B ook o f W aysThe KnifeA blade used by the Pellar is sharp and it will cut, for that is the nature o f the tool.

Older ones are best for they are full o f character, and usually a better quality casting. I must admit that o f all my tools my dear big old cauldron, ‘Old Bet’, is perhaps my favourite. Along with a large cauldron, Cornish practitioners have also traditionally kept a small ‘portable’ example, handy when the Pellar is making visits to their clients. A cauldron has its most obvious use as the cooking vessel for magical ointments, or the food for a ritual feast, hung over the ‘hood fire’. In ritual or magic, it is a symbolic portal o f the Otherworld and a vessel o f change; a womb o f generation or a tomb o f consumption, depending on intent and the phase o f the moon. Herbs and magical substances can be cast into a cauldron with smouldering embers, or a small fire kindled within, and the required virtues stirred up with the Pellar’s staff, conjuring that which is required into manifestation within the rising smoke issuing forth from the vessel’s depths. Visions and spirits can be conjured in this way, to be born forth from the Otherworld during generative workings o f the waxing and full moon.Indoors, during workings at the hearth, a candle may burn within the cauldron, with herbs smouldering on charcoal and other symbolic items arranged also within.82"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Above this are conjurations made with repetitive stirring gestures and muttered chants. During the waning or dark o f the moon, those things that are required to be gone can be placed within the cauldron fire, in the form o f symbolic items, images, knotted cords or pertinent substances, as the witch stirs or moves quietly about it in a sinistral circle, willing the undesired thing to be gone. In seasonal rites things may be born symbolically forth from the cauldron or sacrificed within, and it may become a vessel for sacred fires o f the year.The Tools o f C unningSweeping ToolsSweeping magic was, and is, much used by Cornish practitioners. The most famous sweeping tool, the witch’s broom, is symbolic o f travel between the worlds, and passage from one phase into another. In ritual, it may sweep the working circle, not only as a tool o f exorcism sweeping away influences that might impede or interfere with the work, but as a symbolic gesture to establish that exchange between the worlds is about to take place there. The broom is used in magic to sweep bad influences out o f the house, and fortunate or lucky influences in at certain times o f the year. In curse magic, ill-intent and bad or unlucky influences can be swept via the broom into the doorway o f an enemy or wrongdoer.Feather sweepers are traditional West Country working tools, most often fashioned from long goose feathers bound with wax, or goose fat and string, to form a handle. Sometimes a left hand and right hand sweeper will be kept; the left hand one to sweep harmful or unlucky influences83"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"away and the right hand one to sweep in fortunate or lucky influences; others have kept a single sweeper for both actions, switching hands according to intent.The sweeping gestures may be made over a candle, charm, or symbolic item, or to sweep virtues and influences in, or out o f a place such as a client’s home. Magical sweeping gestures might also be made over a person or an animal. In this way, sweepers may also be employed within healing work; to sweep away the ailment from the affected part o f the body with the left hand, and then to sweep in the healing influence with the right.The ‘witch’s whisk’ is a West Country sweeping tool purely used to exorcise evil spirits and negative influences from a place. It is made by binding thirteen dried and thorny blackberry twigs together, using the string binding to form a handle. The ends o f the twigs are set alight in a blessed fire, and the smoking whisk is waved and danced around the place with vigorous gestures to ward o ff all evil and harmful influences.Conversely, a similarly bound bundle o f twigs, such as Pine, may be employed in a similar fashion. In this case however, the West Country witch is drawing helpful spirits to the working place, attracted by the pleasingly scented wood smoke.T raditional W itchcraft — A C ornish B ook o f WaysDrumsVarious kinds o f drum may be kept by West Country witches, for they are useful within the circle for drumming up sprowl and the presence o f helpful spirits.

These are employed by the West Country witch to attract helpful spirits and to raise spirit forces at the creation o f an outdoor working space, and to aid the achievement o f trance states.These may more usually be employed to begin simple, solitary workings, although I have heard three wind roarers used together during a working gathering o f wise- women here in Cornwall, the sound was quite remarkable and the ‘Hidden Company’ left no doubt that they had drawn close to see what was going on!85"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Stones would also be carried as protective amulets and provide warning o f the presence o f poison by sweating.D e v il’s F ingers also known as T h u n d er B o lts are the belemnite fossil.

For the staff, the Pellar’s traditional working stick is o f course most often employed, becoming a ‘bridge/vehicle’ to join and give access to the ‘Ways’, and a representation o f Bucca. Pitch forks or hay forks are occasionally used instead. Within Ros An Bucca, we are fortunate to have a six tined threshing fork, which we employ as the altar within our six main seasonal ‘Furry’ rites.The stone is the foundation stone or hearth stone around which the cultus o f the Craft operates. In some traditional groups this is a whetstone that keeps the blade o f Cunning ever sharp, but for the solitary witch any o f the working stones may be used. Quartz is a good choice for it attracts and enhances the serpentine flow and the breath, whereas obsidian would be more fitting specifically to the new moon.The flame is the flame o f Cunning, the light betwixt the horns and the light on the heath that illumines the path o f the Cunning Way.

Known examples are formed from horseshoes fixed to a wooden base, with a candle fixed between the upward pointing arms o f the shoe, or a forked section o f tree branch fixed also to a wooden base, with the candle stuck between the forks. This ‘bewitched lamp’ is both a devotional object, being a potent visual representation o f the Horned One and the light betwixt the horns, and a practical item for magic. Just as the hood- fire may be employed magically, so may the hood lamp assist workings to attract that which is desired and banish that which is not, often by the aid o f pertinently coloured glass headed pins once the candle is identified with the object o f the working.The bone is the representation o f the Old Ones, the gods, spirits and ancestors o f the Craft and the ‘First One’ o f the Cunning Way. In grand rites this may be an actual human skull, although other smaller human bones are more usefully portable and thus more often used. Animal bones and carved skulls have also been employed for this. Alongside human bones, I also sometimes make use o f a pre-historic, yet still sharp, flint cutting tool as a potent link to the ancestors.Some will keep about their person a stone, bone and candle within a handkerchief that along with their stick/ staff, a small flask o f drink and a little food, may form a good and proper altar when out and about in the land.

The most important function o f the circle is that o f access, for it is a place created and set aside for the ingress o f virtues, powers, spirits, atavistic wisdom, and the manifestation o f divine force into the Craft o f those who work within its boundary.Within the witches’ circle may be found a map to the worlds that are to be drawn upon or traversed.

It is for this reason that the circle’s centre is called ‘the cauldron’.Within the circle, the Pellar’s staff is a ‘bridge tool’ which, as ‘The Horse’, becomes both a vehicle o f ingress, for force, spirit and virtue, via which the witch may access and draw upon the Ways, and a vehicle o f egress should the witch desire to go forth to traverse and explore these roads. When placed in the centre o f the circle it stands in representation o f the axial road itself, giving access to all six Ways — above, below and the quarter crossroads. There is also the mystery o f the seventh Way; the centre where ‘all is one’.

Within this ‘walking meditation’, the practitioner is seeking to achieve a number o f things; firstly they are turning away from their mundane cares to enter into the deeper states o f awareness ‘between the worlds’ required to make communion and congress with the ‘otherworldly’ possible. Walking the Round is also an act o f conjuration; the witch, moving at one with the geomantic force, draws upon the serpent and ‘gathers in’ the virtues and powers pertinent to the rite or working. Calls are also made during the Round to the divine force. As the repetitive, insistent circumambulations o f the witch draws the mind deeper into trance, yet fixed firmly on its goal, glimpses and perceptions o f Godhead may well be achieved.To end a rite, the Round is sometimes walked in a dextral circle ‘with the Sun’ (clockwise) direction; a return to ‘the world o f men’. Dextral and sinistral circles are also employed within the Compass during acts o f magic. Gathering power is not quite the same thing as raising power. Once the power has been gathered in by the Round, it will then be ‘raised’ in acts o f generative magic by walking an accelerating dextral circle around the fire, before directing the power to where it is required. In acts o f banishing, binding, or blasting, a sinistral circle is employed again, here the gathered powers are used to restrict, or even consume, the focus o f the working.It is the intent, and fixed will o f the Pellar, that determines the use and intended result o f the working97"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"direction. In traditional witch rites, there is often much hard work to be done and the Round can be quite a strain, sometimes to the point that a practitioner will collapse in trance (a moment they will always make the fullest use of), but it is old wisdom that like attracts like. Energy must be used in order to raise it and work with it. The fire in the circle’s centre consumes much energy, in the form o f wood and oxygen, but it draws the serpent and produces heat and light. Likewise a circle o f steadily circling witches uses oxygen in the blood, and can strain the muscles and the lungs, but it will also gather, stir and raise the powers within the circle, as well as producing vision. To raise energy, we must partake o f it, just as an engine or mill uses energy to create energy and produce that which is desired.Elderly and infirm Pellar within groups will be excused the Walking the Round, and will often be given the task o f drumming, which not only aids the Round but will produce similar results; being a repetitive trance inducing, and power raising act in itself.Always in magic, with the aid o f a fire, the moon, and the serpent, a sinistral circle can be used to consume and restrict, whilst a dextral circle will generate, create, and bring forth potency.It must also be remembered that all witches’ circles are one circle. The rite o f the Compass Round is not the creation o f a circle, but a conjuration o f the ancient Circle o f Cunning. The true conjuration o f the Compass is an invocation o f the path itself.

In Cornwall, and other areas, little ‘charm bags’ containing folded written charms, drawn symbols, and magical substances and powders were fairly111"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"common. Some consultations however would result in no actual charm being supplied to the client, and only involved ritual actions such as the use o f sweeping tools, or stroking stones accompanied by muttered charms, or spells such as those by candle and needle might be employed.Other acts o f magic, performed by the Pellar, involved the powers o f foresight and consulting with spirits to give predictions, answers to questions, and to discover the whereabouts o f lost or stolen property. It was in the past fairly common for ordinary Cornish folk to possess at least one charm acquired from a local practitioner, and it is known that, at times, people would have travelled great distances and formed large queues outside a practitioner’s home for a consultation.Whilst the majority o f these charms and practices were offered to help and to heal, it was also not uncommon for practitioners to receive requests for curse magic; usually to be cast upon an enemy o f a client. The much written about ‘Wiccan Rede’ or ‘Threefold Law’ is entirely alien to the old practices o f village witchcraft, Charming and Cunning. Practitioners would not normally be wealthy enough to turn down a client who was willing to pay good money for a bit o f magical retribution. Times are not quite as tough today, and so practitioners can now afford morals, and will turn down what they deem to be unreasonable requests.The absence o f any such ‘Threefold Law’ does not mean that Pellar will curse everyone and anyone by whim; a very sensible approach to such things is taken by genuine Traditional practitioners. To curse can involve working with dark and very deep-set energies and emotions, itT raditional W itchcraft — A Cornish Book o f W ays112"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Tradecan be very demanding, and not at all a pleasant way to spend your time and energy; therefore no experienced practitioner would ever do such a thing ‘willy-nilly’. Curse magic, or ‘Owl Blasting’, as it is called in the West Country, is employed only in extreme and well deserved cases when no other course o f action is available. An essential aspect to the Cunning Path is having the wisdom to know when such workings are appropriate, and when they are not. There are no blanket rules here, the Pellar will think, and if necessary, act for themselves on these matters.The belief is held by most folk that there is either white magic or black magic, and that the white variety is that o f good and helpful magic, whilst black magic is for all harmful and evil ends. For Cornish witches, things are understood differently. White magic is not known, and black magic has a different interpretation...The colours o f Cornish witch-magic are red, green and black. Red magic is ruled by the serpentine fire in the land, it is magic o f potency and empowerment, to charge an item, being, or place with generative sprowl is an act o f red magic, as are workings o f sexual energy and the laying down or directing o f protective spirit forces. The familiar spirit o f red magic is the red serpent.Green magic is ruled by physicality, the land, green and growing things, and living beings which are animated by sprowl. Workings o f physical healing, herb craft and material gain are acts o f green magic. The familiar spirit o f green magic is the hare.Black magic forms two areas o f practice; dealings with the unseen, ethereal and eldritch forces, workings o f spirit magic, ancestor magic, ‘seeing’ and some acts o f divination. Also there is the area o f practice involving113"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"influence, control, deep emotions and behavioural patterns, sleep and dreams, bindings, curses or ‘Owl Blastings’.

The sinistral hand will be employed within acts calling for banishment, removal and diminishment. An exception unique to the sinistral hand is that it may be employed to gather, apply or direct baneful energies in the work o f blasting. The dextral hand is o f course employed in acts o f positive conjuration, increase and regeneration; thus, for example, in acts o f healing where the sinistral hand may first remove the ailment, the dextral hand will then apply the regenerative forces to the area in question.The thumb and fingers also have their distinct virtues; the thumb is o f earthly, material, and bodily virtue, the index finger is employed within work aided by the virtues o f air, communication and thought. The middle finger aids all workings o f spirit magic, the ring finger is o f water, emotions and the deep self. The little finger aids workings o f fire, sexual energy and strength.Thus the thumb and fingers o f each hand are o f great use (yet subtle and occult to the observer) within magic, to generate or banish via the energies they represent, depending on the dextral or sinister hand being employed and the nature o f the work. The thumb or fingers may thus be employed to stir certain mixtures, anoint certain items, or charge certain charms depending on the virtues required.In the healing o f a burn, a Charmer may first exorcise the fire from the injury by use o f their little sinistral finger, and apply the soothing watery virtues o f healing via theT h e H a n d o f th e W ise115"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"ring finger o f the dextral hand.

The virtues o f the planets, the sun and the moon, were observed, and have long been employed by the Pellar. The life problems they are called upon to remedy, and the desired things they are sought to conjure, all come under the rule o f one or more o f the planets, thus the system most used by the Cornish practitioner to calculate the ingredients o f their magical substances, and the timing o f their work, was that o f traditional planetary correspondence and moon phase. An individual’s personal responses arising from working with the genius o f certain plants is also an aid to the creation o f preparations.It was the system o f the seven bodies corresponding to the seven days o f the week that were traditionally used for these calculations. Thus certain days are appropriate for the working o f certain charms, and the creation o f certain substances.ОThe Sun is allied to the element o f fire and the sign o f Leo.

They are supplied to clients, and incorporated within the physicality o f charms; adding to their potency. They may also be scattered during workings in the area a spell is to take affect, for example to bring fertility to a piece o f land, or to protect a place from ill-influence. Powders are also cast into a working hood-fire, to empower it with the virtues appropriate to the working or rite at hand. Suffumigations, or incenses, are equally vital to a practitioner’s trade. The appropriate preparations will be burnt on coals to conjure certain pertinent and useful virtues, as offerings and encouragements to helpful spirits, to release a spell within the rising smoke, or to enhance the potency o f charms by passing them repeatedly through the smoke.What follows are merely the physical lists o f ingredients for the preparation o f working powders, suffumigations and liquids. In order to be active, they must be prepared at a pertinent time, and date, and under the correct phase o f moon. The appropriate virtues must be gathered, raised, and worked into the preparation as it is mixed by the Pellar. This process takes much time, as indeed it should.

Throughout the process, the practitioner is working their power, and the required virtues into the mixture. When this part o f the process is done, the mixture is placed into the working bowl, where it is left on the hearth to ‘cook’. Properly prepared, the result will be a truly potent magical substance. Suffumigations must be put into a glass jar, sealed, and left in a dark place for six months to settle and mature. Magic powders may be used the next day. Ointments must also be sealed within a dark place for six months before they are strained and bottled.T raditional W itchcraft — A C ornish B ook o f W aysPlanetary SubstancesS u n Pow derB a y leaves — 1 tsp, B en zo in — V2 tsp, C innam on — V2 s tic k , Cloves — x 7 , C o p a l— 1 tsp, F rankincense — 1 1/2tsp, J u n ip er B e rrie s— V2 tsp, O a k — 1 tsp, P atchouli — 1 drop, R osem ary — 1 tspF ire o f the S u n IncenseB a y leaves — 1 tsp, B en zo in — V2 tsp, C innam on o il — 1 2 drops, Clove o il — 6 drops, C o p a l — 1 tsp, F rankincense — 1 / 2 tsp, Ju n ip er berries — 1 tsp, M a rjo ra m o il — 3 drops, O a k b a rk — V2 tsp, O range o il — 1 8 drops, P atchouli — 10 drops, Ruse т а гу — 1 tspS u n O ilI n O live o il g en tly h ea t B a y leaves — 2 tsp, Ju n ip er B erries — 2 tsp, R osem ary — 4 tsp.

In such situations exorcism may be quite an over dramatic and unnecessary solution.To stop the mischievous activity o f spirits within the home, it is far more sensible to provide them with their own space to occupy and keep them content, by constructing a spirit house.The ways in which spirit houses are constructed vary greatly and will depend much on the witch employed to supply it, and perhaps the perceived nature o f the spirits involved.

Employed as ‘tracks’ along which to draw spirit force and sprowl, we have seen them used in protective charms in conjunction158"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Tradewith such things as hag stones and rowan berries, or to entice, trap or occupy spirits by the inclusion o f many tangled threads within witch-bottles and spirit houses.Cords may offer yet greater working versatility when perceived and brought into action as the strands o f fate; o f people, places or objects etc. Here, influence, for either good or bad, can be exerted over the target, once identified with the cord, and the working intent o f the practitioner tied into knots along its length to cause changes and influences upon the target.The nine knot spell is traditionally used to bring change and exert influence. It is performed by the contemporary witch with a popular form o f spoken charm, o f which there exist a number o f versions, below is my own:“By k n o t o f one oh serpent come,B y k n o t o f tw o the sp ell to do,B y k n o t o f three I conjure thee,B j k n o t o f J o u r ‘tis through the door,B y k n o t o f Jive the sp ell to thrive,B y k n o t o f s i x the sp ell to f i x ,B y k n o t o f seven now I have ’em !B y k n o t o f eight ‘tis sealed by fa te ,B y k n o t o f nine the sp ell I bind. ”A method o f cord magic is to pass the cord, slowly to and fro, through the smoke o f pertinent incense, in the north o f the Compass, to cleanse it and to identify it with the target o f the spell. In the working o f a group o f fellows, this is done by each practitioner present. Each then, using the ‘Witch’s Breath’, breathes ‘life’ into the cord, if it represents a living person, or, if it is159"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"representative o f an item or situation, this is held firmly in mind and breathed into the cord.The cord is then placed within the cauldron, which is slightly to the west o f the centre o f the Compass, as a sinistral Round is walked to intensify the link with the target o f the operation, and to gather in the virtues that will aid the desired results. Once this is potently established, the cord is taken up again and the nine knots made along its length, reciting each line o f the charm with each knot. In a working o f fellows, the cord is passed round in turn for a knot to be made, each time, the witch reciting a line from the charm. As each knot is tied, the desired change is potently envisaged as taking place upon the target, and it is breathed upon to give life to the magical action.When all the knots are tied, it is placed again within the cauldron, which has been moved to stand upon the pentacle, positioned slighdy south o f the centre, and a dextral Round is walked to raise and intensify the gathered virtues and to bring the desired effect o f the working into manifest reality. Once complete, a knotted cord may, if circumstances permit, be left close to the target to work its influence over them, or, when representative o f something to be rid of, thrown into the fire or buried to rot.The colour o f the cords used will be pertinent to the intent o f the spell. In Cornish magic the three colours o f choice are, as we have seen, red, green and black. However, a red cord is kept for most operations, and a black one kept for acts o f ‘get rid o f ’ magic and blasting.In addition to the above, knotted cords are also employed to draw upon and store certain virtues, whereby the knots will be untied later to release the virtues to lend powerT raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W a js160"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Tradeto certain spells. A notable example is the moon cord or ‘moon ladder’, in which the lunar virtue is stored for later use.

Here the candle is representative o f the target, topped by their/its light o f being. The pins are heated briefly within the flame and are inserted into the body o f the candle, each one conveying the will and intent o f the spell into the candle, thus directing the desired influence to the target. As the flame o f being reaches each pin to let it fall from the candle, that part o f the spell is seen to have fully taken hold, or, according to the nature o f the spell, to have actually brought about the desired change the pin conveyed.As with cord magic, colour plays an important role. Usually only either a white or black candle will be used depending on the nature o f the work at hand, white for such things as generative magic, healing etc. black for consumptive magic, cursing, mind control (for good or for bad) etc. The pins however may vary in colour, as Cornish witches keep a good array o f different coloured glass headed pins, catering for a wide range o f magical intentions, and planetary influences.Candle and pin work may also be undertaken as an act o f divination, where the timing o f the pin’s falling, it’s distance from the candle, direction o f pointing, and its161"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"relationship to other fallen pins may all be read by the divining witch.T raditional W itchcraft — A C ornish T o o k o f W aysT hree V essel M a g icThis spell requires three identical vessels.

The third vessel is for the helpful influences o f the witch’s familiar spirit. The three vessels are sealed, taken and buried at a place where the powers and virtues will be helpful, thus both the place and the timing o f this will be chosen carefully, depending on the spell’s intent.G e t L o s t B o xe sA method o f banishing magic, popular with Cornish witches, is the making o f a ‘get-lost-box’. Whilst its operation is limited to workings o f banishment, it is versatile in that it may be employed to banish anything from the life o f the client that they wish to be rid of.Within such boxes are placed items, supplied by the client, that are symbolic o f whatever it is they wish to be rid of. The witch will then seal the box with red sealing wax, and wind tightly red thread, wool, or thin cord, around the box over and over, trapping and diminishing the undesired thing.Sometimes these boxes, if they contain a minor ailment, such as warts or a runny nose, might often be left in some place, such as a road or the steps to a church, to be found by another in an act o f passing on magic.

The witch, in trance, working away with her glass needles beside the fire, would work her intent strongly into the piece o f knitting for some time before pulling it from the needles and casting it upon the fire, so that the intent may be released up the chimney and out on its way to do its work.163"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"R ite s o f th e M o o nTH E time o f the full moon brings increased potency to the generative and vision inducing virtues o f the serpentine flow, and so, it is for the witch a time that lends itself to a variety o f useful work. After the rites o f the Compass have been done, in either simple or grand form, there is no one rite o f the full moon to be observed within Cornish witchcraft. What takes place during a full moon rite depends entirely on the work to be done at the time.I f much work has been done since the last full moon, practitioners may feel themselves to be at low ebb and lacking in sprowl, and so the witch may seek to imbibe this vital force through dancing the Round to conjure and draw deeply upon the serpentine flow, and via the rite o f the Troyl; taking full advantage o f the time o f increased potency that the full moon brings. Useful lunar force and sprowl will also be stored at this time for later use by means o f the moon cord, which is made from three nine foot white cords plaited together and bound at the ends with red thread. The witch, after having danced the round165"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"to gather and raise sprowl within the circle, will raise their cord to the face o f the moon and conjure its force, and the raised sprowl, into nine knots tied along the cord’s length. Each is tied with only the left eye open so that the face o f the moon may be visible within each knot before it is pulled tight. Each o f the nine knots may be untied at later times to lend extra strength to magical workings.This potent time is also highly useful, not only for gathering herbs, but for mixing and charging magical powders and other substances, as well as the ritual charging o f magical items and charms. It is also a time for generative magic and conjurations around the hood-fire.It is known by the Cornish Wise folk that heightened generative potency and ‘life force’ is not the only thing to be drawn upon from the serpentine flow during the full moon, from the serpent there is another force that may, at places, issue forth in abundance and that is the force known as the serpent’s breath. To draw upon this force, the Pellar will take their full moon rites down into the damp sea caves, haunted fogous or potent holy wells; places where this hypnotic, chthonic force may more easily be encountered and in a more concentrated form. There they commune with this force, drowsing deeply within it, receiving visions, answers and life. Drawing upon the serpent’s breath will aid greatly the visionary abilities o f the witch.One full moon rite for visionary and divinatory purposes is that known down here as ‘Calling Down the M oon’. This name is obviously related to the elaborate Wiccan rite o f ‘Drawing Down the M oon’ but the Cornish version is, in essence, a quite different and seemingly simple rite. For this the good old copper basin is filled partly with water,T raditional W itchcraft — A Cornish T o o k o f W ays166"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"and it is better for this rite if it can be drawn from a holy well.The witch will stand looking intensely at the moon, working to achieve a trance state, with the basin before them on the ground. They will then take this up gendy and raise it to the moon; drawing its virtue into the water before lowering it gendy back to the ground. The witch will then kneel before this basin on one knee and gaze at the moon again for a while, and then down to the dancing reflection o f the moon in the water. The witch will look to the moon for one last time, then, after a while draw their gaze slowly downward to the reflection o f the moon within the copper vessel, and there seek visions in answer to their questions. This water will also prove useful within the rite for anointing the self and magical objects that might benefit from a little extra lunar virtue.Within all full moon rites, the witch will make sure that they have quartz stone with them; for this will serve to enhance the flow o f the serpentine force during the proceedings, and thus aid greatly any work done. Rites o f the full moon are o f course always concluded with a joyous Troyl rite.R ites o f the M oonThe New MoonWhen the moon is dark, a quite different, yet still highly useful situation arises, with other opportunities to get work done.Whilst it is true that traditional witch rites in general can be fairly quiet affairs, with declamations and spoken charms often being muttered rather than spoken aloud,167"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"rites o f the new moon are mostly silent, with any ritual declamations being muttered, or whispered, very quiedy indeed. The new moon is a time for rites o f inward journeying, looking deeply into the self for answers, and delving for anything buried that may otherwise throw up inconvenient surprises at later times, for the Traditional Cornish witch, that universal occult maxim ‘Know Thyself’ tells o f an important magical prerequisite that is always striven for.Journeys will not only be made into our own inner- underworlds, but to the underworld o f the beloved dead, for the new moon is also a time for ancestor communion, and acts o f atavistic ‘seeing’ and divination will be made to seek ancestral wisdom and guidance. In such rites the black mirror is an ideal tool.Making use o f the inward and consumptive virtues o f the serpentine flow, magical workings at the time o f the new moon will largely consist o f ‘get-rid-of ’ magic as well as magic o f the toad, to influence the mind and emotions o f others for either good or for bad if need be. It is also a time for acts o f ‘Owl Blasting’ when such is necessary.The stone o f choice for rites o f the new moon is the black obsidian, for it is a stone that aids inward focus, and the revealing o f things held deep. It is also o f protective quality, which will be found by many to be a useful virtue during such work.A sphere o f obsidian called a ‘moon crystal’ or ‘moon stone’ is sometimes kept, useful both in the rites o f inner visioning during the dark o f the moon but also in ‘seeing’ work under a full moon, where her hypnotic image may be shown on the sphere’s black surface.T raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W ays168"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"R i te s o f th e M o o n"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Furry NightsR ile s o f th e Y e a r ’s R o u n dIN Cornwall we have a bewildering calendar o f traditional festivals and feast nights, ranging from the world famous to the obscure and sometimes bizarre!

Some traditional witches acknowledge the equinoxes with a simple rite to commune with this balance.Whilst the Furry Nights have their traditional guiding dates, their observance is not determined by strict adherence to the calendar. Nature provides the signs o f change that will signal to the witch that the Furry Night has arrived. The behaviour o f certain plants will be watched for: the appearance o f the May blossom signalling the arrival o f May’s Eve, the Snowdrops heralding Candlemas etc. The M oon is also used as a natural marker for the Furry Nights, the night o f the nearest full moon to the calendar date often being chosen as the time for the observance since the forces o f the land are responsive to both seasonal change and the cycle o f the moon.T raditional W itchcraft — Л Cornish T o o k o f W aysCandlemasThis ‘feast o f lights’ is the ritual marker o f winter’s end, and the point at which the days will begin to noticeably lengthen gradually as the sun returns, signalling the approach o f spring.

It is for this reason that the witch’s powers in Cornwall were seen to be ‘renewed’ at springtime, for by the time spring had properly arrived, the witch would again have good access to serpentine sprowl and thus work their Craft more effectively. The people would be known to queue up in the spring to have their charms re-empowered, after having kept them throughout the winter. It is also due to the fact that, for this rite, the Wise seek to conjure the re-emerging serpent, that they traditionally make these rites o f ‘gentle fires and encouragement’ at holy wells, being both a place where such virtues are usually more easily accessible anyway, and, from a symbolic point o f view, they are watery and vagina-like portals into the depths o f the earth through which the serpent may be birthed with conjurations and offerings.Л C andlem as R iteThings needed: A white candle within a lantern or glass jar for each participant, one large red candle, a cauldron, quartz stones, a serpent-form wand or one crafted from the quickening rowan, a pitcher, the crucible & coals, dragon’s blood resin, the forked staff, Troyl items and extra food, drink and some musical instruments to warm173"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the blood and the spirit on what is likely to be a very cold night.For their Candlemas observances, the Cornish Wise Folk like to make their way, at the dead o f night, in silent procession to one o f Cornwall’s holy wells, lead by one candle lantern, and the rest carrying theirs unlit.Upon reaching the well, the staff is placed in some prominent place close at hand, with the Troyl things and pitcher at its base.

In the west o f Cornwall the ancient midsummer observances survive, and were under revival in Penzance with the ‘Golowan Festival’ & Mazey Day celebrations. Golowan in the Cornish language means the feast o f St John (the Baptist) and Mazey is derived from the Cornish term for being o f a dizzy, crazed, maddened or intoxicated state.The festivities o f the past centred around fire, with folk running about swinging great squares o f burning canvas180"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"that had been saturated in tar and attached to the end o f long poles, or strong chains. Burning tar barrels were also placed in line up the middle o f Market Jew Street for people to run and dance about.These traditions slowly declined under the pressure o f the disapproving authorities, but through the hard work and passion o f a group o f community minded folk, 1990 saw ‘Golowan’ and Mazey in Penzance reborn. Today, each year, thousands flock to Penzance to enjoy carnival processions, music, art, and drama and ‘serpent dancing’.The serpent dance, which has become quite a wild creature, seems to be a spontaneous conjuration and communion with the serpentine flow which, at this time o f year, zeniths in potency. Fire is still very much an integral part o f a spectacular fireworks display rising from the seafront by Jubilee Pool. In very recent years however, over officious attitudes and financial interests would appear to be dominating and leaving less and less room for local midsummer traditions, which are sadly rapidly deteriorating within the festival.Cornish witch-lore tells o f how Midsummer would see all the witches o f the west gathering on the steep granite boulder strewn hill known as Burn Downs, which rises above Tregerthen which could be translated as ‘Rowan Tree Farm’. It lies on the path from the hamlet o f Wicca to Zennor, a remote and wild area steeped in old witchcraft. Here the witches o f the west would light many fires, work magic and renew their vows to the Old One. Here also was a substantial, sacred cubical boulder known as ‘The Witch’s Rock’ and was attributed with magical powers. Tradition states that to touch it nine times at midnightThe F urry N ig h ts181"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"would protect one from all evil. Unfortunately this rock was broken up, probably to be used for farm buildings, but there remains another sacred rock attributed also with magical powers. The Giant’s Rock lies in a field not far from Zennor Church. Tradition holds that to walk nine times around it at midnight would give one the powers o f a witch, perhaps revealing that this was a place o f initiation. To this very day the Giant’s Rock may see the midsummer gathering o f Cornish witches.Midsummer Eve bonfires remain a strong Cornish tradition, with fire beacons being ceremonially lit on the sacred hill tops, from Chapel Carn Brea in West Penwith to K it Hill, a line o f ritual fires snaking from one end o f Cornwall to the other.For the survival o f this we have the Old Cornwall Society to thank. These official hilltop rites have however become much Christianised, although it is extremely difficult for any to deny the ancient pagan spirit behind such practices. In addition to these official gatherings, the Wise folk o f Cornwall climb the high places o f the land to light magical fires o f their own.T raditional W itchcraft — A C ornish B ook o f W aysA G olow an B iteThings needed: The forked staff, the Troyl things, drums and other instruments, last year’s St John’s Wort bound with other good and baneful herbs in coloured ribbons — yellow for the sun, red for sacrifice, white for strength, green for wisdom and blue for love.

Here the local giant conquers his opponent (ensuring the protection o f his land) and marries his daughter, giving the feast ancient themes o f battle, death, sanctity o f the land and fertility.Later in the month o f August, Cornwall sees the once widespread “ Crying the Neck” ceremony which, like the Midsummer bonfires, has been revived on a number o f Cornish farms by the Old Cornwall Society.The culmination o f the harvest is marked by the ceremonial cutting o f the last standing Corn, which becomes the “ Neck” and is carried back to the farmhouse where the bearer o f the Neck is often dowsed with a jug o f water by the lady o f the house, symbolising the rains needed to nourish the next crop.The Neck is decorated, and sometimes fashioned into a figure or dolly, to contain the spirit o f the field and ensure185"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"a good harvest for the next year. The Neck would be given a place o f honour at the table and drunk to during the feast. It would then be hung up in the farmhouse until the next year’s harvest was gathered in, with the creation o f a new Neck, whereby the old Neck would be burnt, buried, or fed to the farm’s finest beast.

As the reign o f Bucca Gwidder comes to an end, so Bucca Dhu rides now across the reddening land, upon the dark steed o f wood-smoke breath as spirits walk aboard. It is a time for gradual withdrawal, turning inward and gathering wisdom.Given the nature o f the season, it is hardly surprising that there were a good number o f divinatory practices traditionally enjoyed by the populace in Cornwall at Allantide. These were recorded as having been enjoyed mosdy by young women, and in the days when a woman having a career o f her own was not the done thing, the identity and occupation o f her future husband was o f vital concern, and so it is also o f no surprise that the old divinatory ‘games’ were recorded as being employed to shed light on this matter more than any other. They were and are o f course quite useable to divine the answers to all manner o f queries.The most popular o f these old divinations included the use o f water filled basins, being best made o f the188"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Venusian copper if the divination was for matters o f love, into which molten lead would be poured; often through the handle o f a door key, and the resulting strange forms taken by the water-cooled lead being read for divinatory meaning.

The first piece o f paper to break free o f its earth encasement and rise to the surface would reveal the true answer. Divining pendulums would also be formed, usually from the front door key, or a wedding ring, to which questions would be put and the swinging motions being read for meanings and answers.The origin o f this festival’s name is given various possibilities. It is attributed by some to St. Allen, whilst others prefer the likely relation to the Welsh & Manx Hollantide, relating it in turn to Hallowe’en. Yet others point out ‘allan’ as an old English word for apple and the traditional association with apples that this festival undoubtedly has. As with many things so contested, the true origins are likely to be a mixture o f the various theories and possibilities.In Cornwall, it was an important Allantide custom for specially large and polished apples to be given to friends and family members as charms to bring good luck, foresight, and good fortune in love. These special apples were given the name ‘Allan apples’ and many were sold in Penzance, where the shopkeepers would proudly display their largest Allan apples in their windows on the Saturday prior to Allantide.

Here only two rites may be observed; the dedication and when the training is complete the actual initiation after which the new Cunning Man or Wise Woman is sent o ff on their way to get on with it.Whilst each Hearth has their own ways o f carrying out rites o f admittance and initiation, patterns exist, such as the concept o f the ‘Cavern o f Initiation’ for the very few Hearths existing in Cornwall today make a habit o f visiting the fogous and sea-caves for these occasions. Cross roads & churchyards are also the venues for certain rites. In addition to the formal admittance and initiatory rites o f the Pellar Hearth, there are other informal initiation rites associated with certain ‘places o f power’ within the Cornish landscape, such as the traditions surrounding the ‘logan stones’. Such rites often have themes o f chthonic power, ancestral gnosis, and rebirth, and are conducted by the Pellar whenever and as often as the need and desire arises.Within the Old craft, there exist guarded initiatory lines, passed on via Circles, or teacher and ‘prentice like relationships.

Whilst brief mentions o f it existed in a couple o f locations on the internet, prior to the release o f the first edition, details o f the line’s rites had not, to my knowledge, been published, and here within this book at least that will remain the case. However, after the release o f the first edition, I received many enquiries regarding the Cronnek Dhu, some people started using the name and imagery in various ways, even affixing it to various profane products such as coffee mugs and t-shirts! But saddest o f all, one chap from America contacted me to say he’d killed a toad and asked what he should do with it next. I feel some clarity and tying up o f loose ends is required here.The secret rites o f the Cronnek Dhu Cornish initatory line are similar in some respects to the no longer secret toad bone rites o f the East Anglian Craft, however they do not involve the act o f killing a toad. The acquisition o f the physical remains o f the ‘right toad’ is by portent and an ominous occurrence. Knowledge o f the rites are confirmed by an existing initiate. I say confirmed rather than ‘passed on’ for ‘candidates’, under guidance, are ready to undergo the rites only when they have realised their true nature and inner purpose for themselves, at which time the toad will appear. The rites o f the Cronnek Dhu are a lengthy and personally costly process, during which the preserved black toad fetish is created, and marks the possessor o f this charm as a ‘Toad Witch’ conferring upon them the ability to influence the mind and deeper self o f humans and animals.Historically many practitioners in Cornwall claimed to have been born into a family line o f Crafters or Pellar.In itia tio n s on the C unning Way201"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Whether truth, or just good business sense was behind these claims, we can only ponder. It could be argued that the potential client would have more faith in a practitioner they thought belonged to an ancient blood line o f the Wise. It seems to be accepted by many Traditional Crafters today that being born to a practitioner does not automatically result in Cunning inclination. It is also however acknowledged that such inclination is born into certain folk, and that this arises in the ‘right people’, regardless o f who their parents might be. Practitioners certainly do though very often tend to come from families where Cunning, or those practices related to it, have been present, sometimes a number o f generations back. A blood line o f sorts, if not strictly a continuous or unbroken one.Many working Pellars o f Cornwall would claim blood descent from the ‘Old Man o f Cury’ (Tammy Blee o f Helston being a notable example) who, according to various versions o f an old legend, rescued a stranded mermaid he had found close to Lizard Point, whilst walking the sands in a day-dreaming state. For returning her to the sea he was granted the powers to exorcise evil spirits, lift curses, to provide cures, and to tell the whereabouts o f things lost or stolen. These powers o f the Pellar would be passed to all o f his line.Lizard Point, and its surrounding coves, has long been held as an area o f visionary and initiatory power by Cornish practitioners, and the powers o f the spirit o f the sea are conjured as a highly useful aid to various magics.The ‘Old Man o f Cury’ may be seen as the ‘First o f Pellar Blood’, who brought the powers o f the sea and the potent serpent force o f that place to man, and the true ‘Blood Line’ is the wisdom and power that enchants theT raditional W itchcraft — Л Cornish T o o k o f W ays202"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"blood, as it is passed forth from practitioner to practitioner via initiatory rites.Within the modern Traditional Craft, it seems a contested issue whether or not the paths o f the ‘Old Craft’ can be trod entirely alone, with no contact or association with other established practitioners from whom to receive guidance. I do feel that it is entirely preferable to strive to make such contacts and associations, essential if one seeks entry into an initiatory line, for the continuity o f passing wisdom from one practitioner, directly to another, has much inherent power in itself.It is entirely possible that, traditionally, some practitioners took up their ways entirely alone, drawing from established local knowledge regarding the charms and rites that heal, avert evil and make divinations, whilst malting use o f the old ‘grimoires’ to provide knowledge o f further rites and charms.Progress within the traditional Craft can truly only ever be by experiential immersion, all the better amongst established practitioners, but not at all an impossibility for those whose initial ‘contact’ can only be via books. In both cases, honest practice and dedication are required.The ‘blood calling’ o f the true Crafter will lead them to draw wisdom from the land, for both it and the self are the teacher, and within the Compass o f Cunning, by communion with the spirits o f the ways and those o f the blood who have walked its very same round before, is the wisdom and the Way ever passed on anew.For the solitary dedicant, I offer here a rite o f dedication based upon a combining o f parts o f the rites o f Admission and o f Initiation employed within my Hearth; Ros an Bucca.In itia tio n s on the C unning Way203"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"T raditional W itchcraft — Л C ornish T o o k o f W aysA Rite of Dedication to Bucca & the Cunning WayHave with you at your place o f working: the forked staff, a lantern, the knife, the horn-cup o f mead and bowl o f bread, a crucible o f coals and dragon’s blood resin to burn therein.
