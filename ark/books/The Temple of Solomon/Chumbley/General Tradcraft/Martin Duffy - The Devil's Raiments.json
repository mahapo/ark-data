Andrew Chumbley, Qutub ithin occult philosophy it has long been held that the physical body of man is but a visceral cloak of flesh, draped upon the bones that cage the Starry Radiance within. The naked flesh, as a veritable cloak of its own, is an infinite firmament veiling .11 id sheltering this luminous essence, and when man dies his soul will cast this garment aside as he passes into the realm of his divine birthright, taking on a mantle of shining light. Thus is the original condition of man 'naked', in which state he enters and leaves this However, just as the cloak of the magus is resplendent with the many signs and sigils of his royal art, so too does the flesh contain many secrets within its folds, lines, appendages and proportions thereof. These morphological features are as signs and symbols themselves, each figure upon the skin being like a constellation em-blazoned upon the cloak of night, mediating and evoking the very mysteries themselves. Many are the secrets written upon the body of man, the enciphered pattern of the worlds contained therein, .ind it is to these that the wise look to discover man's secret nature, .ind in understanding man as the very image of god we discover .ilso something of the nature of the Divine. There exist numerous cosmogonies that tell of man's origin as .1 luminous incorporeal form, about which the physical frame was built. Within the conclaves of some mystery schools the 'first flesh' of the first man was understood as being of 'Light', and thus does the Zohar tell us that \"when Adam dwelt in the garden of Eden, he was clothed in the celestial garment, which is the garment of heavenly light...light of that light which was used in the garden of world."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"luli'ii\".1 This Man of Light, who shone like the Sun, is the one nuile in 'God's image', and it is this outer garment of Light that some believe fell away on Adam and Eve's transgression, thereby revealing their 'nakedness'. Upon the loss of this radiance, and their expulsion from the paradisiacal Eden, man was given a \"coat of skins\", that is to say fleshly bodies and the faculties of sensation required to inhabit the physical world2, thus does the Zohar tell us that \"the Soul and the Form when descending on Earth put on an earthly garment\". Through works of wisdom man hopes to re-at-tain this gown of light. When Adam and Eve lost their garments of light and glory, they sought to cover themselves with fig leaves. Some have construed this as a sense of shame over their nakedness, a mindset which manifests today in two polarised attitudes; at one end of the scale are the prudish notions of impiety and impropriety and at the other the exhibitionist and fetishist. Others interpret it as the shame they felt in their decision to transgress God's edict. However, there are others still who perceive it not as shame but fear, a fear of being 'unmasked', for to be stripped naked is to expose, and in recognis-ing this they sought to clothe themselves and thereby re-cover the naked self; these being the twain powers of revelation and conceal-ment. Man can be 'veiled' with many different garments, which act not only to conceal but also to reveal and manifest. That is to say in adorning a garment we present a 'mask' to the outer world, each visible mask being emblematic of the different invisible powers and principles that they mediate; the image is not the reality but rather the objectification of the magical current thereby reified. In this sense clothing becomes a type of 'glamourie' wherein the witch's form becomes transmuted, appearing in the form of the de-sired, and thereby enshrouding the witch in the mystery therein enciphered. In this manner Man becomes aligned with the Fetish-Tree, the axis of the existent. Upon his boughs the vestments are hung according to his design, each garment becoming a fetish or L Zohar II. 229 B. 2.

Within the witch cult there exists a practice wherein the stang t» .idorned with a horned skull and then dressed by hanging linen i a^s upon a cross-beam, resulting in something akin to a scarecrow, 4iul thereby becoming an eidolon or mommet of the horned witch id who stands guard at the north of the witch's circle3.

The dressing of the stang with regalia is based on the old belief (li.it clothes come to evoke the man, recalling the occult Law of (Contagion that gives rise to the manifold uses of garments as magical links. So it is that just as a cherished item of clothing from line's beloved immediately calls them to mind, so too do particular raiments help aid in the conjuration of certain powers. In a practical sense, just as symbols are read as if the reader were wearing them5, so too can enshrouding ourselves in the habiliments and regalia of the powers help us to concretise them. This is also affirmed by Manly Hall, who tells us that \"the garments and ornamentations supposedly worn by the gods are keys, for in the Mysteries clothing was considered as synonymous with form\"6. There exist two approaches to the manner in which the various bodily adornments might be regarded, although in truth these lines of inquiry are conterminous rather than independent. The first is a ritualistic approach, wherein the clothes are worn because they I. |.ickson, Call of the Horned Piper, p. 26. 4.

However, even in the latter approach there is room for a ritualistic understanding, many things having accrued symbolic meaning and certain power through repeated use. icca holds that the witch should 'be naked in their rites', a proclamation repeated within the pages of Leland's Aradia, \"And as a sign that ye are truly free,ye shall be naked in your rites, both men and women also\". Besides the mundane interpretation that such 'freedom' implies, there is an element of transgression and in-version of cultural norms within such a practice, accordingly, when correctly employed, such a rite of opposition leads to freedom from the societal shackles that one has been instilled with since birth. In the breaking of our cultural taboos, and more importantly in self-overcoming, we free the power therein contained, allowing it to be redirected to more useful arenas and opening the eyes to new vis-tas. However, we must be careful not to become seduced by the transgressional behaviour itself, for as Chumbley admonishes, \"the opposition of the normative aesthetic is the means and not the end of the Path\"7. Aside from the unfettered freedom arising from the contraven-tion of perceived ways of being, within orthodox Wicca ritual nu-dity is explained as being essential because clothes impede the emanation of magical force, which is considered to exude from the naked flesh8. Many modern adherents of the practice say that in being naked it allows them to experience an uninhibited flow of this power, although in reflecting upon the true nature and power of magic many have come to question the validity of this argument. Despite the numerous medieval depictions of naked witches it is prudent to question how much of this was pure fantasy, for the 7. \"The Secret Nature of Ritual\", Opuscula Magica Vol. I (Chaos International No. 18,1995). 8.

Some have suggested that it was because of these self-same climactic conditions that witches of iilil greased themselves up with warming fatty unguents, thereby fashioning an insulating layer. These unguents were said to have lu-en bestowed by the Devil and were variously anointed upon the witch's body or vehicle of flight (such as besom, stang or spindle) •is an agency to assist in the transportation of the witch to the nalibat. Although these 'flying ointments' were supposed by some in have resulted in a physical flight, within the records of some European witch trials and in such works as The Bookof the Sacred Mtigic ofAbramelin the Mage this transvection is accorded as being visionary in nature, giving the sensation of flight rather than its .11 nullity.9 Many recipes are given for such salves, often containing various venomous and mind-altering herbs to induce narcosis and 'vision'. 1111 fortunately, much of the modern research into flying ointments t nncentrates nearly wholly on determination of the various phar-macological effects of'visionary' herbs upon the human physium ami the changes in consciousness thereby facilitated. However, Mich material reductionism is to completely misunderstand the true nature of'vision' and omits any consideration of a plant's spirituous powers; in truth such short cuts pale in comparison when held up against the attainment of'flight' by means of patient effort and de-votion. Furthermore, by emphasising a purely entheogenic ap-proach one fails to account for the large number of inert ingredients within the recorded flying ointment recipes. By rubbing the flesh ill herbs into the flesh of man, we might access not only the phys-u al properties of the worts but also the numinous vegetal powers therein contained. It will be noted that this practice has a certain similarity to the manner in which bestial powers are assumed by the wearing of their fleshly mantles. However, such shapechanging is also assisted by the use of fatty unguents containing animal fats, I letiri Boguet relating that witches are able to turn themselves into '» The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin The Mage, Aquarian Press, 1976 p.21."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"wolves by virtue of ointments that would sometimes contain wolf fat (Discours de Sorciers). One ubiquitous yet innocuous component of the salve is soot. It is evident this has no psychoactive property, rather its inclusion in the salve is to make the skin black. Skin staining as a type of bodily adornment is a practice with some antecedence. Pliny the Elder in Book 22 devotes his second chapter to the subject of adorning the body with plant dyes, noting in particular how the Gaulish women stain their body with vegetal pigments \"when tak-ing part in the performance of certain sacred rites\" so that their skin is dark like that of an \"^Ethiopian\", which recalls the use of the witches' sooty-black sabbatic unguent. He also refers to the practice of staining the face by 'barbarous peoples', a practice that is again not altogether alien to British shores (see the discussion of black face folk traditions below). In popular folklore, Picts are thought to have stained their skin blue by the use of woad, yet modern experimentation has shown such to be highly unlikely as woad has little to no skin staining ability. However, the Lindow Man was found to have had copper and iron pigmentation upon his body, both of which are capable of producing a bluish body paint, or more controversially tattoo ink10. The issue of tatooed Picts is slightly contentious because despite the proclamation in Isiodore's etymologies, there is limited evidence to support this idea and naturalistic images of them on monumental stones show no obvious tattoos. Either way, it is clear the Picts ('painted people'), as they have been known since AD 297, did adorn their body with images or 'pictures' that were somehow stained upon their skin. Similarly do sorcerers sometimes decorate their naked flesh with signs and sigils apposite to their work, using magical inks composed of fitting herbs and minerals to draw upon the bodily canvas. By this means powers may be accessed and spirits summoned into parts of the body or specific limbs, such making reference to the body as a vehicle that might be driven by spirit and god alike. Other times the body might be stained a 10.

Within some covens the witch is marked upon their hand with three dots in the formation of a triangle, evoking the numerical powers of the triad and the potency of the sigilic trivium. Occasionally the triangle has a point at the n-ntre, this being the shining star at the centre of the triangle of (•vocation, a point of light delivered through the vehicle of the three mothers or Fates. Within the Richel-Eldermans collection housed at the Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle, this mark is illustrated as being made upon the tip of the middle finger, with the tip i oloured red, although other illustrations in this collection show (he finger bearing the sigil of the sun. Being a point within a circle, this solar sigil has certain similitude to the point in the triangle and might be interpreted as the deliverance of Light from the dark void of the circle. In other instances the witch mark is a simple dot upon a particular finger that is in some way meaningful to the cult, usu-ally having an association with the 'language of the hands'. Returning to the subject of skin dyes and the sabbatic unguent, some assert that the soot merely enables the witch to blend in with the darkness of night, and thereby go about her business sight un-seen. In this we are reminded of the old familiar stereotype of the nocturnal witch coven clad in black robes chanting as they make (heir way about the magic circle. This has some grounding in re-ality as, in stark contrast to their Wiccan counterparts, traditional and hereditary covens have often been known as 'robed covens' in deference to the fact that many of them work enveloped in robes and cloaks. Such was certainly true of the Chanctonbury coven, (he coven headed by Charles Cardell, Robert Cochrane's 'Clan of Tubal Cain' and the Cultus Sabbati. Cloaks are still commonly ii. \"The Secret Nature of Ritual\"."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"worn by witches, and although many now speak of them only in terms of keeping warm, 'setting the atmosphere' and enabling one to 'slip through the night unseen', we may discern a much deeper philosophy at work here. Whether by making the flesh black or donning a black robe, the witch becoming encloaked in Night's dark mantle becomes as one with her. Reference to this latter philosophy is made by Cochrane, who asserted that \"the cloak represents the concealment of the Mysteries and Night, the Hider of Light...also Humility, Poverty and Charity, which equals magic power\".11 Herein is direct allusion to the goddess Nox, the exceptionally powerful primordial goddess of night who stands at or near the beginning of creation. She is sometimes depicted as riding a chariot drawn by two black horses, and other times by noc-turnal animals such as owls and bats, with her star-bedecked black robe and veil following in her wake. Nox was considered as the daughter of Chaos, yet unlike the modern understanding of the term, the Ancient Greek conception of Chaos did not refer to disorder but rather to the original state of negative existence from which the first gods were delivered. It is the 'nothingness' of Hesiod's Theogony, from which all things came; the Orphic's 'womb of darkness' from which emerged the Cosmic Egg containing the Universe; the Chaos from which Eurynome ('the goddess of everything') came in Pelasgian myth. As such Chaos is the pre-existent state, a belief held also by the old alchemists, and thus the womb from which all is delivered and the tomb to which all returns, the seething cauldron overseen by the Witch Queen. Orphic philosophers considered this Primal Chaos to be the true foundation of reality, the Light being fleeting and the Darkness abiding; it is the original state of unity preceding the differentiation which led to the emanation of the existent. In fact, it is an almost universal theme that Chaos preceded the existence of all things, and that it is from this original pre-manifest state that Order is spun by a creator who is oft-considered separate from Chaos. We also find this belief extant within the realms of traditional witchcraft. In Qutub, Andrew Chumbley relates how, \"there is a 12. The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 142."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"niylli known to Few, a myth silent dreaming within all Creation\", 4 mytli that \"before the Manifest came to exist there was a Place • •I Darkness — the Negative Existence\". Chumbley rightfully as-serts that \"naught be truthfully be said of this Place, for it is Oth-riness Entire\". In Greek thought this Chaos or Negative Existence was the antithesis of the Kosmos, the latter being the 'ordered uni-verse' (literally 'orderly arrangement'). Negative existence by its ilclinition cannot be defined, for as soon as its defined it ceases to become 'negatively existent'; even to understand it would be to limit the Limitless and make the Infinite finite, thus making such .111 understanding impossible. It is for this reason that some label it the Incomprehensible Godhead, this being the Nameless and Un-k nowable Godhead that Cochrane believed stood beyond the Gods. Within the vast and dark void of Chaos are what Chumbley called \"Those-who-exist-not, [and who are] called by their descendents The Elder Gods\"13. These Elder Gods are what the traditional witch Daniel Schulke defines as \"the Gods before the Gods of Men\", not to be identified with ancient polytheistic gods, i.e. the mortal gods of man, rather they are \"voidful sentiences...pervasive before the coalescence of the present world: nameless, faceless, devoid of human or earthly attribute, and beyond mundane comprehensionIt is these Elder Gods who are deemed most worthy of our honour and worship, for unlike the mortal gods of man's passing faiths they are not icons forged by the hands of man. There are some mythologies wherein Chaos and her daughter, the Black-Winged Night, are conflated, giving rise to a dark goddess of Night, Chaos, Death, Sleep and Dreams (Sleep and I )cath being two of Nyx's children). As the mother of all that is mysterious and inexplicable, she naturally came to be associated with sorcery, witchcraft and the magical arts. Within some branches of traditional witchcraft the oneiric realm is understood as being beyond the mortal condition (the realm of life and death) and outside of time. This realm of infinite possibility is the pre-existent 'dreamtime', the archetypal depths within which all things are regenerated. I()JItub, p. 59. 14. \"An Interview with Daniel A. Schulke\", The Cauldron No. 129."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Intriguingly, in the images of Nyx riding her night-time chariot she is often depicted as wearing a crown of poppies, the crimson bloom associated with Lilith as Lady of the Night and Witch God-dess. Besides being a bringer of dreams, poppies also frequently appear in formulas of the witch's Flying Ointment as a means of facilitating trance and enabling the witch to wing her way to the revelries of the night-time Sabbat. Both Night and her mother Chaos were considered to be goddesses of Fate, but it was Night who was known as Mother of the Fates, Homer calling her \"the subduer of gods\", which is somewhat reminiscent of Cochrane's assertion that all the gods are subject to Fate's rule. However, in some Greek texts the Moirai weren't the children of Night, but of Chaos or Ananke (Necessity), the latter being a spindle-holding personification of Fate. It is of particular interest that the Fates are all 'fatherless', and although the Greeks later held Zeus as the father of the Moirae, this wasn't widely accepted. The residence of Night was said to be within a place of darkness or within a cave beyond the ocean at the very edge of the Cosmos. One Orphic poem relates her as occupying a cave or adytum wherein she gives oracles, the whole of the universe moving to the rhythm of her chanting. Other accounts give her abode as a cavern deep within Hades or the Underworld. Yet in considering these various domiciles it is notable that all of them are at the very fringes of the ordered world (the Kosmos). It is no surprise then that like the Cavern beyond the Ocean's edge, the dwelling of the Witch Queen is held by some to be within a Hollow Mound across the River of Time that separates the worlds. Likewise are the Fates sometimes depicted as residing in a dark and mysterious cave where they tend and watch over a large black cauldron. Within some branches of traditional witchcraft the relationship between the Lady of Night and Fate Queen goes a lot deeper than a shared abode in a cave. This is particularly evident in the traditions that gloss the Witch Goddess as Naamah, the weaving sister-wife of Tubal-Cain; herein do we find our Blacksmith God and Weaving Goddess. Naamah is sometimes known as \"Lilith the Younger\", which is unsurprising when we consider that Lilith"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"W.IS originally a Sumerian goddess whose name cognates with Night, and within the older and younger Lilith do we find the bright and dark aspects of the moon (sometimes glossed as Diana .uul Hecate). The incestuous union of Naamah and Tubal-Cain, which some say birthed Asmodeus15, also recalls the union of Diana with Lucifer. A common depiction of the pale-faced Witch Queen is as a l< >nely old spinster16 sitting at a spinning wheel; \"the weaver or spin-ncr who controlled the fate and destiny of the Gods and the human iin c\"17. This is of litde surprise considering that the Witch Goddess is known by some as the 'Three Mothers', being in some ways a uimposite of the three Wyrd Sisters or Norns of Anglo-Saxon mythology, who spin, measure and cut the threads of fate. Here we return to the subject of cloaks and robes, for weaving, besides being symbolic of the manner in which linear threads of order are spun from the tangles of chaos, is a practical art that enables the witch to bring things into being, to fashion the very trappings that rnclothe the magical force. This brings up the whole arena of cord magic, knot magic, knitting magic, the cat's cradle, weaving spells and so forth, but of particular relevance to this article is the art of weaving magical garments, that is to say garments as woven fatel8. These arts were considered under the auspices of Holda (identified by some with Nicneven, Dame Habonde, Herodias, Diana and the night goddess Lilith), who rides out through winter's night sky with her hordes of witches in tow, these being the spirits of her lollowers who have left their bodies to travel to the sabbat held within Holda's sacred mountain peak.

Intriguingly, some images of the Virgin Mary show her as a spinner, \"the Mother liri omes the spinning goddess of destiny; the Child becomes the fabric of her body\" (The Rose-Garden Game by Eithne Wilkins, Victor Gollancz, 1969 p. 95).

Our world is but the manifested dream within the embrace of the Night sky, the realm of Chaos, and it is in the dark dreamtime that Chaos seeps into our River-bound world, her influence being as stars falling upon the earth from midnight's celestial vaults. 19. The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 157."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The fabric of the cloak may accordingly be considered as a boundary between that which is within and without. Aleister ('rowley proffers a similar attitude when he says that \"the robe is I hat which conceals, and which protects the magician from the elements; it is the silence and the secrecy with which he works, the hiding of himself in the occult life of Magick and meditation\"20. When we enter the otherness of the Night-time realm we lose any sense of the external self as realised in the waking world, it is a moment of solitude. As such, when cocooned in the darkness of the cloak we are enacting a type of hermitage; we are withdrawing the self from life and going into the dark sanctuary of the Hermit's C !ave. Yet within the Hermit's Cave is not only shelter, but also tlarkness. In isolation and the dark of night the impossible seems possible, and the most terrifying of our fears will often surface to confront us, but it is in the overcoming of such fear that the beginning of wisdom is found. Modern society seems particularly frightened of Night and her children Death and Sleep, which manifests in an unhealthy obsession with artificially illuminating every corner of our settlements so as to keep darkness and its inhabitants at bay. Yet the witch realises that with such fears man evokes his own demons, and instead actively seeks out the darkness beyond the borders of civilisation, that place where Night's influence may be felt most strongly. In many ways the Hermitage is akin to the archetypal witch's cottage sited upon the outskirts of the village and therefore the boundary of 'civilised' society; it is the place where the influence of Chaos begins to seep into the realm of Order. The importance of this seclusion within night's veil is deftly summed up by C h u mbley, for \"one who dares surrender unto the sl<y-spacious abyss of the Isolate shall find his self more in his self-losing, for the vast profundities of the soul shall be surrendered unto him\"-, in isolation we d iscover \"unique autonomy of the self, independent of external factors\", we find the source of our own power\". Such are the teachings embodied by the figure of the robed Hermit within the Tarot. JO. Aleister Crowley, Magick, Guild Publishing, 1986 p. 108. j 1.

This is echoed in the ancient British belief that stands in stark contrast to the modern conception of blackness as a stagnant state of finality, rather darkness was considered as a fertile seed-bed whose loam would give rise to Light. It was this belief that darkness begets light that led our ancestors to begin their day at twilight and their year with the dark period, winter preceding summer. In the same way alchemists considered nigredo (the 'black chaos') essential to the operation, because Nature can only restore itself after first dying away, this being symbolised by the black crow perched atop the caput mortuum at the start of the journey. As a nod to this, Crowley states that \"the shape of the Robe is a Tau\"*2, and in donning this black cloak and voluntarily entering death-in-life we undergo a sacrifice from which the perfected man shall be resurrected, recalling the 'Seamless Robe' stripped from Christ as he hung upon the crucifix. Within many creation myths we encounter Light delivered from Darkness, a Voice arising from the Silence, these signalling the inception of the Kosmos and thus the divinely ordered creation that comes under the auspices of the Demiurge. In terms of our current discussion, this can be seen as the parting of the Robe of Night, the Light pouring forth through this tear or aperture in the Veil being the first creation of Night. From this fallen spark the worlds unfolded, \"the appearance of the ten spheres out of Nothing is as a flash of lightning or a sparkling flame\" (Sepher Yetzirah). This is the self-same Light that illuminates Man, and it is telling when Crowley relates that \"the only light of the Magician is from the Lamp which hangs above his head (the robe being open allows this light to pass in through the top and out the bottom to 'illumine them that sit in the shadow of death')\"23. Within the outdoor rites of the witch this 'Lamp' takes on a very different form, such hinting at the alignment of the Crown of Man with the Point of the Heavens, which in turn speaks of the 'fallen' Light. 22.

On a terrestrial level it is the underlying darkness cyclically lit by the solar orb, esoterically serving as an allegory of those brief moments of understanding and gnosis wherein we catch a glimpse of the reality underlying the mundane world. Cochrane alludes to (his when he describes the Cloak as representing \"the concealment of the mystery, night the hider of light\", this being further encoded in the cloak's construction, which he says \"should be black with a red lining\".2* It is also a truth that the Heart of man resides within the dark sinistral side of the body, the Light shining in the Darkness of Midnight. We may thus conclude that just as Life comes forth f rom Death and the Manifest from Chaos, so is it that Night births the Star, or as Nietzsche more poetically expresses it, \"you need i haos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star\".25 There is an interesting line within Cochrane's letters that speaks of \"the Cloak that covers the Stone\"26, which makes mention of the cloak's power of concealing, a boundary between the hidden and revealed. This calls to mind the mythical 'cloaks of invisibility' that allow one to go about sight unseen (such as that made by Alberich l he dwarf so as to grant invisibility to Sigurd), and in many ways relates to the cloak and sooty black ointment as a means of allowing (he witch to move about in the night sight unseen. One might consider this quote from Cochrane as being an .illusion to the cloak of Night covering the earthly millstone, and thus a reference to Nox and Gaiea, for although the veil of night is lifted by day to reveal Nature, none have ever unveiled Night itself. I lowever, Evan John Jones explains the stone as being the ceremonial whetstone that \"sharpens the knife that cuts the cord\",27 which is suggestive of the mastery of Fire that is required to overcome Fate. As a means to sharpen metal tools the whetstone is an emblem of the Blacksmith gods such as Vulcan, Wayland, I'ubalo, Tubal-Cain and other masters of the fire, yet by striking The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 142. iV Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Prologue 3. i(i.

Manly Hall relates this as \"the dark cold Father — stone — giving birth out of itself to the bright glowing Sun — fire\", going on to elucidate that just as Fire worship replaced that of phallic stone worship, so did the newly born flame (Sun/Son) supplant his Father28. In this respect we might esoterically consider the Cloak veiling the Stone as symbolic of the Secret Light and Fire hidden deep within the deathly shroud of night's darkness; the Heart of the Mysteries. This is mythically embodied in the figure of Mithras, the \"deus sol invictus\", who is shrouded in the cloak of night, the stars and signs of the seven planets upon it. It is the enduring and mighty Sun of the Spirit hidden in Midnight's Veil. Likewise is man's heart and inner fire hidden within the confines of the black robe, such being represented by the cloak's red lining, symbolic of the god, blood and fire. This touches upon a further mystery, which is that of the Stone as a symbol of Man's body, made in the image of the creator; the Fire contained within and issuing forth from it. In this sense the Cloak covering the Stone becomes as though a 'mask', a revealed form presented to the outside world and mirroring the concealed reality of the Self. Like Binah, whose virtue is the Silence of night, the cloak becomes the \"Outer Robe of Concealment that suggests matter and the shrouding herein of the Inner Robe of Glory of the life-principle\"29. If the cloak is a mask, then it follows that like the serpent we may shed our outer skin and fashion a new one. Such cloaks, real or envisioned, aid one in congress with the magical virtue of that thing, and in becoming as one with it the woven reality is presented to the outside world as a masque. Such an art may be extended to the realms of the glamour, whereby the cloak hides the real person and a false image is presented in its place, as is enshrined in that old saying \"a wolf in sheep's clothing\". Related to the motif of clothing as 'disguise' is a practice with specific biblical prohibition, that of cross-dressing; \"the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a 28.

That said, (Christian authorities sometimes made exemptions for episodic transvestism when done out of a necessity for survival (e.g. to flee Irom danger in disguise) or for reasons of sanctity, such as the holy transvestites, those cross-dressing female saints who took on the mantle of a man in order to attain holiness. On the subject of holy transvestism, the 4th Century Saint Jerome remarked that as \"woman is for birth and children...when she wishes to serve Christ more than the world, then she will cease to be a woman and will be called man\", although this tolerance didn't seem to extend to the infamous Pope Joan.

Such a practice is known throughout the ancient world, and we may cite the Priests of Cy-bele and the Phoenician priests of Baal and Astarte as examples of religious cross-dressing. On one level the priest-shaman is simply assuming the mantle of their patron deity in order that the god might 'ride' them, and where this deity happens to be of the oppo-site gender cross-dressing is necessitated. Other times the priest might assume the opposite gender role to the god(dess) so as to be-come their 'lover', which in some ways parallels the taking of a demon-lover. However, we might also read this as a unification of the Twin Powers within the One Divine Androgyne, this philos-ophy being deftly summed up in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas \"when you make the male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male, and the female not be female...then shall you enter the Kingdom\". Some posit that this philosophy of ritual transvestism underpins the role of the she-male in the old British folk customs, such as the Mollie accompanying the Kent Hooden Horse, the Judy accompanying the Mari Llwyd horse, the Old Lass of the Old Tup players from Sheffield, the Maid Marian in the Ab-bots Bromley Horn Dance, the she-males at the Horn Fair and the Bessie of the Plough Monday ceremonies to name but a few31. It is of interest that many of the trickster gods display a confus-ing ambiguity in their gender, such as Hermes, Mercury, Loki and Dionysius. However, it is not just in their gender-characteristics where there is uncertainty, these beings that walk between the worlds often conflate those things that are opposite by simultane-ously displaying two contrary behaviours at once, such as being sa-cred and profane, foolish and wise, prince and pauper etc. This overturning of restrictive hidebound tradition is exemplified in the many revels wherein social norms are inverted, and which are often held in honour of transgressional gods, such as the Hysteria held in honour of Aphrodite, the feasts of Dionysius, the 15th Century Festival of Fools and the Topsy Turvy where the poor dress as kings, men as women, women as men, bishops as monks etc. Such inversions were also utilised by witches as an outward sign of their magical calling, some choosing to wear their clothes back-to-front 31.

This use of clothes as a mask to conceal an identity or present 4 different one appears regularly in myth and even in biblical texts. Most common is the use of clothes to deceive, with kings dressing in the rags of the poor, men in the habiliments of women and so lorth, but one instance that particularly stands out is a legend from Mhbinical traditional concerning the death of Cain. The legend ielates how the aged and blind Lamech was out hunting with his M»n Tubal-Cain, when he saw what he thought was a horned beast, 4iul with his son's aid he shot it dead with an arrow. On discovering the creature was actually his ancestor Cain, who was horned and clad in animal skins, he clapped his hands together in »orrow, but as he did so he accidently struck his son's head and killed the 'young shepherd' (Second Book of Adam and Eve, Chapter 11). The confusion of Cain with a beast comes as little surprise when we consider that some sources give the Mark of Cain as a pair of horns or antlers33. This legend exemplifies the mask-like qualities of garments, 4iid demonstrates a certain similarity with the shamanistic use of animal skins worn to assume bestial powers; wrapped within their hides we may become as if the very animal itself. One might posit i Kirrelation between this shamanistic use of bestial mantles and ilie lycanthropist, who in donning the wolf-skin becomes a were-wolf. There is an example of this in the Volsunga saga, wherein Ni^mund, his nephew and son kill some men adorned with wolfskins. Having slain these men they choose to don the fleshly mantles themselves, cursing them to become werewolves. ( ommentating on this body of lore, Mircea Eliade suggests that H I Inward, Michael.

This has further correspondence with the practice of witches going forth in the shape of animals and also with 'guising', wherein participants would dress in the garb of beasts, becoming an embodiment of that animal. It is noteworthy that 'guising' customs are particularly associated with the liminal period about Halloween and Midwinter. Within the folk traditions of Britain examples abound of men dressing in the likeness of beasts or wearing their skins, such being exemplified in the Christmas Bull or Broad of the Cotswolds and the 'hoden' or 'hooden' horse of Kent35. It is notable that in all of these the person wears an outfit wherein they 'become' the animal. Even in the instance of the ubiquitous Hobby Horse, the Old 'Oss of ceremonial folk rite isn't ridden like the children's toy of the same name, rather the wearer is 'ridden' by the spirit of the animalistic theriomorph36. Schulke tells us that besides being a frequent iconographic feature of European witchcraft, the bestial human is a magical construct of ancient origin enabling \"the magical assumption of the spirit-attributes of the animal guardian\"37. Within the Antient Order of the Horsemen we encounter a particularly intriguing example of this practice, the initiate being encouraged to shake hands with Lucifer or 'Auld Nick', who is manifested in the rite by an initiate dressed in animal skins and stag horns, with a cloven hoof in his hands38. 34. Eliade, Mircea. Birth and Rebirth: The Religious Meanings of Initiation in Human Culture. 35. There are numerous theories as to the meaning of 'Hooden' or 'Hoden'; some posit it to be a dialect confusion with 'wooden', others still believe it a corruption of Odin or Woden, with others still suggesting it to derive from the hood worn over the head (the word hood deriving from the Old Frisian word hode). 36. This evokes a wider body of lore relating to the Horse as the fleshly steed of mat-ter ridden by spirit, the Master of the Horse being none other than Cain (see Andrew Chumbley, \"Gnosis for the Flesh Eternal\", Opuscula Magica Vol 2.

Although the esoteric import of birds differs here, but from the Dove of Judeo-Christian tradition to the migrating geese and 'seven whistlers' of British tradition, there exists a strong tolk-belief that the spirits of the dead are borne away by, or re-ap-pear as birds39. This is of particular interest when we consider that just as the ancient Egyptians believed the soul could leave the body in the form of a hawk, so too are there numerous examples of leather-laden cloaks being worn so as to become as if the bird itself, such as the falcon-feathered cloak utilised by the Norse goddess Freya40. Combined with trance states, these feathery habiliments are of much use in enabling the spirit of the sorcerer to fly free from the body and soar into the realm of the winged angels and demons, al though the latter, in stark contrast to the former, are often depicted with the wings of night-birds, moths and bats as opposed to those of day-flying birds and butterflies. Feather-adorned cloaks .ire also used to call upon specific avian powers and thereby aid in the working of certain rites, corvid plumage for example may be used in works of prophetic and oracular trance. Further to this is the use of such cloaks to assist in the manifestation of those spirits and god-forms having an avian aspect, such as the trickster raven and night-owl. We have already seen how mantles of flesh and feather can be assumed, yet many other things besides can be worn, including the verdant leafy cloak that covers the tree. To put on such a robe is analogous to the staining green of the skin by way of sappy unguent, both working to evoke the vegetal powers, and in its apotheosis is to evoke the Witch God in his aspect of Lord of the (ireen, counterpart of the Master of the Beasts. It is of little sur-prise then that although more commonly depicted as being dressed in leaden black or fiery blood red, there exists also a number of lolkloric references to the Devil wearing a 'cloak of green'41. 40.

In this we find reference to an older custom wherein man becomes en-shrouded in leaves and other plant matter, such being embodied by the various manifestations of the wandering Green Man, including the burry man of eastern Scotland and the Jack-in-the-Green cen-tral to the many May festivities (the Jack-in-the-Green festival at Hastings for example). The Jack-in-the-Green shares certain sim-ilarities to the Hobby Horse of folk tradition in that a human is within the structure peeping out, in this case a cone-shaped wick-erwork frame covered from head to foot with leaves and other greenery, that is to say man becomes one with the mask he wears. Of further contemplation is the association some have proposed between guising in animal skins and the worship of the shape-changing Odin or Woden. One of Woden's many pseudonyms was \"Grimr\", meaning \"shape-changer\" or \"masked man\", and this referred to his ability to change both his skin and form in any man-ner he so fancied. It is in the consideration of Woden as a person-ification of the Witch God that we discover some insight into the 'Old Man', Magister or 'Devil' dressed in skins, horned head-dress and mask, thereby facilitating the manifestation of the Master of the Beasts within the circle's bounds41. Within the figure of Woden wandering between the worlds, shrouded in hood and cloak, we find allusion to the figure of Cain, and as Crowley reminds us \"this 'goingaway into the wilderness'...we find in the lives of all men of the highest type ofgreatness\"*1. This act of 'boundary crossing' reveals yet another role of the robe within the art magical, which is as a form of initiation and an assumption of the magical personality. This is not to be confused with some sort of excursion into the realm of make-believe, where one dresses-up and pretends to have magical abilities, but rather it speaks of the means by which the witch aligns themselves with the source of their power. In this sense the witch is transfigured in the manner of the Serpent; it is the successive shedding of the outer skin, the scales falling off, layer by layer, slowly refining the form until it 42. \"Robert Cochrane's Letter to Robert Graves\" by Grevel Lindop, The Cauldron No. 134, 2009. 43.

Man is born into the world without clothes, cloaked only in the *kin that binds the viscera and vital organs within. Within the T.denic myth this nakedness traditionally represents a state of pure and unfettered innocence, yet to others it represents the phase of ignorance prior to man's illumination by the Serpent. Intriguingly, the word used in Genesis 2:25 for naked is arum, in the sense of 'not clothed in the normal manner', and some posit that this refers to the fact they were clothed with garments of light. However, it is notable that this word also glosses as 'crafty', 'cunning' and 'wise' .ind is used in the self-same passage to describe the trickster nature of the serpent. Once man had tasted of the Fruit and gained Wis-dom he became ashamed at his ignorant animal self and sought to i over his body, and in this we might consider the act of en-clothing 10 be one of the first and most profound rebellions man staged against the creator. So it is that the witch robe as a symbol of the Tall becomes emblematic of man's attempts to seize power over liin own destiny, and also of the manner in which he seeks to fash-it 111 his own masques. It is of interest then that the Hebrew word for coat is me'il, which has connotations of me'ila, a trespass. Upon their initiation by the Serpent, Adam and Eve sought to 1 over themselves, in particular the sexual organs, and in order to do so made an \"apron of leaves\". The covering of the genitals by a leafy green apron is particularly representative of Adam and Eve's discovery that they had the power to procreate and generate, but is also symbolic of the vegetal sacrifice of Cain and the verdant powers of the Lord of Life and Growth. However, the apron of leaves was later replaced with the god-given gift of a \"coat of skins\", a 'hide' to cover and conceal44, comparable to the hide-apron of the butcher and blacksmith, calling to mind the blood sacrifice, the murder of Abel and the crimson powers of the Master of Fire, I )eath and Sorcery. In these two aprons we encounter the twin as-pects of the witch god, the powers of the verdant phallus giving way to those of the crimson skull. 44. It is worth noting that hide in the sense of'animal skin' and 'to conceal' both orig-inate in the same PIE root, (s)keu, meaning 'to hide or conceal'."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"It is particularly significant that the apron covers and protects the generative organs, the home of the sleeping serpent-power identified by some with Fire, the one element given to man alone. We thus come to realise that the covering of the genitals has less to do with shame and more to do with the control and mastery of the red and green fires, epitomised in the blood and sap. Through sorcerous techniques these powers might be focussed so that the sexual desire might be transmuted and risen along the spinal axis to the head, this being the seat of wisdom. So it is that the leafy green apron may be used for those arts of the Tiller, whilst the red leathern apron may be used for those arts under the patronage of the Blacksmith, whether in his guise of Vulcan, Hephaestus, Wey-land, Tubalo or Tubal-Cain. The apron is of particular importance in Freemasonry, said to hark back to that worn during the construction of Solomon's temple. There are others still who claim it goes back to the aprons worn by the priests of Melchizedek, that priest-king who had neither mother nor father and neither beginning of days or end of life, he who stood alone45. Within the Masonic tradition the apron is square with the flap folded so as to form a triangle, recalling the four-fold nature of matter and the three-fold spirit that interpenetrates it. The downward pointing triangle is proximal with the sexual organs, which is significant when we consider that the downwards triangle is symbolic of the watery kteis and the upright triangle of the fiery phallus; herein the six-fold star is enciphered, denoting control and mastery of the twain forces and also signifying the union giving rise to the Magical Childe. There is a custom in traditional witchcraft that \"the apron some-times worn by the Magister as part of his regalia...symbolises noth-ing more than a butcher's apron\"46. In accordance with this the apron was once tied about the waist for the sacrifice of a ram, this being a tithe to renew the seven year reign of the Magister, yet it is still worn by some in sacrificial rites, especially those of self-sac-rifice. This is somewhat reminiscent of the Chod Rite, wherein tantric practitioners \"dance festooned with bones, wearing a cap and apron tailored from tanned human skin, amidst corpses [within 46. Jones, Evan John. Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, p. 145."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"a cemetery]\"47. During this rite the dancers experience the pains of death as their bodies are consumed by demons, a theme common to other sorcerous initiatory rites of death and resurrection. It comes as little surprise then that the apron has an especial place within the initiation rites of certain guilds and cults. Within the initiatory rites of the Millers and Horsemen, for example, the aspirant's leather apron is filled with water from which the brethren are implored to drink for the health of the newly pronounced \"brother'48. There are also some questions and answers during the catechism that deal with the meaning of the apron, these mostly relating to the supplicant being able to see the Devil sneaking up behind him, thereby preventing the 'evil one' from accomplishing his nefarious purposes. The Devil in his role of Opposer and Tester often features in such rites of induction, and sometimes he turns up in the folkloric record wearing an apron himself. The Stiperstones near Pontesbury, where the Devil or his human representative is said to have presided over the meetings of Shropshire witches, for example, were said to have been formed when the Devil's apron strings broke, and several large stones he was carrying within the apron fell out49. In Irish folklore the 'Devil's Apron' is nothing less than the humble nettle. Initiation is of course closely bound with the processes of death and re-birth. We have seen that the original condition of man is 'naked', as enshrined in the Edenic myth, and at death we become naked once again, such being epitomised by the Crucifixion, for (his is the state in which we enter and leave this world. Such alludes to spirit-flight, for stripped of the constraining mantle of flesh the spirit is liberated, allowing it to fly free in its divine unfallen state. Such is the basis of some exhaustive trance techniques, wherein the practitioner seeks to weaken the grip of the flesh on the spirit so that it might enter the Otherworld. Accordingly we might think of trance as being akin to death in life, (he word trance originating in the word transire, literally meaning to cross over or die, making reference to the passage from life to death. •17- King, Francis.

The kinship betwixt the swaddling and the shroud is one that speaks of the relationship between life and death, one feeding upon the other, with life being chased into death and death into life. It reminds us that the sorcerous mantle is one that is passed through a succession of generations, and to the wise provides a key means of accessing the powers of past incarnations through the flesh, these powers having been accrued though successive incarnations. The shroud, like the garb of the departed, is sometimes worn as a mantle in the rites of the necromancer, who seeks to gain wisdom and petition for aid by acting as an intercessor between the quick and the dead. Cochrane believed that the linen tabard sometimes worn as a magical garment is in fact a remembrance of the shroud or veil50, which is of interest when we take into account Chumbley's observation that the Moroccan sect of the Dhu'lqarneni ('the two horned one') also wear a cerecloth or funerary garb in their rites to signify their belief in the transitory nature of the carnal form51. Taking into account the oft-observed influx of Arabic thought into Craft philosophy and practice, he further posits a connection between the word 'coven' and kafan (meaning 'winding cloth'), the name the Dhu'lqarneni give to their circles of convocation, evoking the symbolic wearing of the cerecloth to signify the interconnection between life and death52. The journey from swaddling to shroud evokes the journey of man from birth to death, not just in a mortal sense but also the evolution of his spirit. In the beginning man is of course naked, a rationale that informs the many initiation rites requiring the aspirant to first come forth unclothed, thereby denoting their identification with the First Man who came upon the earth naked yet unashamed. Up until the Middle Ages even the baptismal rite demanded the aspirant to strip naked, the removal of the tunic 50. Glass, Justine. Witchcraft, the Sixth Sense, Neville Spearman, 1965 p. 143. 51.

Of further consideration is the legend of Ishtar, who on her descent surrendered one of her garments, and the powers therein enciphered, at each of the seven gates separating the created world from the Underworld. Underlying this is a philosophy wherein clothes become symbolic of the things man has accrued since birth, sometimes considered as 'trappings' that enchain man to the mortal realm. These earthly garments of mortality are laid aside like the shed skin of the serpent, symbolising the death of the old way of being so as to be born into a new existence, thereby taking on the New Flesh, a more perfect mantle, a new skin. Within occultism and the mystery traditions the development of man on his journey between initiatory re-birth and death came to be represented in his outer garments, this being in deference to the fact that clothes were and still are worn as much for ornamentation as protection. The stages of development are often punctuated by a series of robes, changing in colour and style to symbolise the level of attainment. This philosophy is affirmed by Chumbley, who writes that the dyeing of the robe is a transformation that changes the nature of the raw material, the raw material being the woven threads that form the fabric54. In some magical traditions the initiate on his journey through the Mysteries dresses in a succession of coloured robes, evoking the plumage of the peacock and the rungs of the rainbow ladder. This evolution of the outer mantle from visceral red to the supra-physical violet is sometimes aligned with a mastery of the various alchemical, elemental and planetary powers represented by each of the seven colours; the removal of each mantle being akin to the sloughing of the serpent's skin — the scales fall off. The successive shedding of coloured outer garments reminds us that whilst the spirit of man is an immortal and permanent principle, the flesh is subject to the cycles of Life and Death, which becomes more glorious and refined through evolution.

Qutub, p. 55."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"proclaim that \"the more developed were his super-substantial powers the more glorious was his apparel\"55. Just as outer ritual garments reflect stages of development, so too do many occultists believe changes in consciousness to be reflected in man's body, this being the robe of his indwelling spirit. Manly Hall affirms this when he says that \"man's only lasting adornments are his virtues and worthy characteristics... he is clothed in his own accomplishments and adorned by his attainments\"56. Unfortunately this has historically led to some making an assumption that bodily deformities reflect illness of the mind or spirit, but this is to mistake the profane flesh for the more subtle flesh, that is to say the transmutable flesh draped upon the skeleton of man and the vehicle of the spirit. Just as the alchemist attempts to produce gold from black leaden matter, so too does the transfigured man gain the \"shining mantle\". There is a telling phrase in the Gospel of Mark, where during the Transfiguration especial emphasis is given to the transformation of the lightbearer's clothes, \"his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them\"51 and in Matthew \"his face did shine as the sun\"58. This marks the transformation of man into his perfected state, a birth into new life, and it is telling that angels are likewise described as being clothed in shining \"raiments of light\". Enoch similarly informs us that \"the elect ones shall rise from the earth...they shall wear the garments of glory...the garments of life from the Lord of the Spirits\"59, and so does Enoch in his re-attain-ment of the original state become \"extracted from his earthly clothing, anointed with delightful oil and put in clothes of glory\"60. From Enoch we also learn that \"the angel Azbuga will clothe the righteous and pious with garments of life and wrap them in the cloak of life that they may live in eternal life\"61, hinting that the spirit of man has two garments, one for each of the worlds it inhabits; a material one 55.

So it is that within many modern rites of baptism and initiation the aspirant wears a robe of white, symbolising the re-newal of the original state and the shining raiment of light worn by man before his fall. In Metamorphoses Apuleius relates how Lucius, in his desire to become initiated into the cult of Isis, undertook a journey into the darkness of the underworld. The moment of Lucius' initiation is marked by a change of garments, after which he was \"decorated like the sun\", this symbolising the Light being resurrected from i he darkness of Night. Like the figure of Night, Apuleius de-si ribes Isis the Initiatrix as having \"a very black robe, fulgid with a ihirk splendour...glitteringstars were dispersed through the embroidered hunler of the robe, and through the whole of its surface, and the full moon thining in the middle of the stars breathed forth flaming fires\". Manly 11 all explains this vision as signifying \"the sophic universal mercury and the operating substance of Nature\", which having \"no light of lis own... receives its light, its fire, and its vitalising force from the sun\", the Sun being born of Isis, who yet remained a virgin62. Such might be thought of as a union of the Sun and Moon, symbolised in the witch cult by the black robe and its fiery-red lining, and shows considerable similarity to the myth of Diana who, as dark-ness, gave birth to light and then desired to receive the created light back into herself, this desire being the dawn. The theme of the shining robe as a mark of the re-attainment ol the original paradisiacal state is found in the Gnostic Hymn of I he Pearl, which is preserved in Manichaeism and is found in part HI the Acts of Thomas. It tells of \"the son of the king of kings\" who seeks to retrieve a pearl from a serpent, and in so doing for a lime dwells in the mundane world of matter, forgetting his divine heritage until he receives a revelatory message that causes his soul to yearn for a return to its natural state, such being a Gnostic teach-ing of the exile and redemption of the human soul. It is also known ol as the Hymn of the Robe of Glory, for after remembering his di-vine heritage the prince charmed the testing Serpent, stole the Pearl and facing the garment \"that seemed like a mirror...a bright em-broidered robe\", clothed himself therein and \"ascended to the gate ol salutation and homage\". Within Mandaean and Manichaean"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"texts there also exists a belief that the development of the pearl within the oyster is akin to the temporary housing and develop-ment of the soul within the physical body. One might note that this thematic sequence of opposition and testing of the seeker as a means to determine worthiness of attainment is found in many myths, including that of the Grail Quest. Within the bible the robe is encoded as a symbol of initiation and the passing of power. In particular, the word used in Genesis (k'tonet) to describe the cloaks of skin gifted to Adam and Eve in Eden is the same as that used to describe the clothes given by Jacob to Joseph, and there exists a tradition that Joseph's cloak of many colours is in fact one and the same as that gifted to Adam, and then handed from Adam to Nimrod to Esau to Jacob to Joseph. This 'passing of the mantle' symbolises the passing on of power and au-thority, and is a tradition found in many arenas, another revealing biblical example being the passing of the mantle from Elijah to El-isha (Kings 2:13), wherein it is given the name addereth meaning 'prophet's garment', which originates from the root word for 'power'. The passing on of a mantle of power, thereby en-clothing the chosen successor with the authority and power of the tradition, is in actuality an outer expression of an inner reality. This esoteric counterpart of the physical mantle may be observed as a sign of one's calling in .those whom the Old Ones have chosen. Where the physical successor is unsuitable the mantle will often pass in body only, and may even pass from generation to generation in dormancy before it comes to fall on the shoulders of one suitable to awaken the power and authority within. Even when the mantle finds no place to fall, it shall await the passage of time in dormancy until the coming of a spirit willing and able to succeed. However, the notion that the cloak may come to hold some power of its own manifests not only in folklore, but also in the reverence accorded to ceremonial robes and the great honour considered to be be-stowed upon one who wears or touches robes belonging to royalty or spiritual persons. 62.

Manly Hall notes that even within the priestly robes of the 'pagan faiths' \"a religious cipher language is concealed in the colours, forms and uses of sacred garments\"63. Most people are familiar with this system within ceremonial schools of occultism, where colours might mark grades or align with the planetary powers being conjured, but such a practice also occurs in traditional witchcraft, one author remarking that in some traditions the male and female leaders as earthly representatives of the God and Goddess wear red and blue respectively64. Heyhow for Hallowe'en, when all the witches are to be seen, some in black and some in green, heyhow for Hallowe'en!

It is of note that in the colour spectrum green is halfway betwixt the blue of the heavenly skies and the red of hell's flames, evoking the folkloric stance of faeries as being \"too good for hell, but too bad for heaven\".66 We have already mentioned the emerald cloak worn by the Verdelet as a representative of the Devil in 'a coat of green', but such a mantle may also be worn by a female representing the Queen of Elphame, calling to mind the green clad Dame Venus as a manifestation of Mother Nature and the 'green gowns'of folklore. Interestingly, malevolent faeries may be protected against by reversing one's cloak, as the old rhyme goes \"turn your cloaks, for fairy folks live in old oaks\", which in modern parlance is a 'turncoat', i.e. one who has switched allegiance.

We may thus surmise that although the cloak and robe have popularly been considered as a throwback, or worse a form of the-atrical escapism, there is far more at work here, and although the invigoration and fascination of the eyes is an important aspect of magic, the cloak is far more than a mere prop to \"set the atmos-phere\". It is shrouded within Night's embrace that the witch goes about their work in secrecy and silence, veiling the inner workings from the gaze of the profane with a concealing yet revealing masque, ever seeking to uncover the stone that is hidden beneath. The Sacred Head and its Coverings I, Isis, am all that has been, that is or shall be; no mortal Man hath ever me unveiled. In the history of the world, the head has universally been held in high regard, with innumerable rites, tabu and lore attached to it. Being the vessel of the brain and the home of the senses of sight, hearing, smell and taste, the head has long been considered as the seat or throne of the indwelling spirit, with the various bodily members being as servants, this giving rise to a cult of the head, liven in our modern language the word 'head' is used to denote a leader amongst men, further meaning 'to be the origin of (as in 'the head of a stream') and 'to move' (as in 'to head off'), thereby evoking the virtues of rulership, inception and movement, such being qualities indicative of the Primal Ancestor.

This is exemplified in some witch traditions by the image of the hooded skull as a fetish of the First Sorcerer. Far from being imprisoned within its bony citadel, the spirit is considered capable of flying free from it. Indeed, the many apertures of the skull, each of which are ascribed to astrological rulership within occultism, are points at which spirit might ingress and egress. However, as these pertain to the face, we shall here restrict ourselves to that aperture at the crown of the head. At birth the bones of the skull do not meet, rather they are open like the mouth of a clay vessel, but as time passes they fuse, forming the sagittal suture, and thereby sealing all that's within. The Latin word 'sagitta' means 'arrow', evocative of the stellar blade or nail forged at the hands of Tubalo (counterpart of Tubal-Qayin) that pierces the centre of the skull-dome of the heavens, the gateway to the Great Beyond74. We might consider this piercing of man's crown by the Heavenly Nail as being akin to the falling to earth of Heaven's Fire, paralleling the descent of Spirit from the One Point into Man, thereby initiating spiritual illumination; the crown becomes the point of entry for the inspiring god or spirit. It is also through this suture that the spirit of man leaves at death to enter the Otherworld, recalling the cracking of the skull during Indian cremations to release the indwelling spirit. Within the conclaves of witchcraft it is sometimes considered that the indwelling spirit of man may leave through this opening at the top of the skull, and in Indonesia it was held that the soul may be restored to the head by sorcerers through the self-same bony aperture, a practice familiar to some necromancers. It isn't just our own soul, or gods and spirits, that may traffic through the aperture in the skull, malefic spirits are also capable of entering through the cranium, hence the well-known cross-cultural practice of trepanation to expel those evil spirits causing ill health. It is in light of the sacredness of the head that some cultures have sought to guard and protect these openings by covering it, espe-cially those priests, shamans and magicians conducting rites of magic, wisdom and devotion.

Protection aside, the Greek Platonist Plutarch suggests that the covering of the head whilst worshipping the gods is a sign of humility and represents \"the covering and concealment of the soul by the body\"75. This is a belief that is also found within some lineages of traditional witchcraft, with the hood of the robe covering the head in deference and devotion to the spirits, as well as affording simple protection against the elements76. Intriguingly, Plutarch goes on to say that although the Romans \"cover their head before the heavenly deities\", when sacrificing to Saturn they uncover the head for he is \"a god whose realm is beneath the earth\". Praying with a covered scalp is a tradition also abided to in Islam and Judaism, whereas in Christianity man is exhorted to keep it exposed whilst praying so as not to 'dishonour his head'77. The Christian tradition of uncovering the head in deference to god when praying in church has become concretised in the European superstition of men removing their hats when coming indoors, so as to avoid 'bad luck'. However, women must pray and prophesise with the head covered78, which is in stark contrast to the many old pagan rites wherein women worshipped with their heads exposed and their hair down, such as in the Eleusinian mysteries, the Andaman mysteries and the worship of Dionysius. Interestingly, folklore declares that should a witch shake loose her hair whilst pronouncing a charm its power would be doubled79. Related to the bare head is the tonsure, the hair ostensibly being shaven to remove impurity or evil influences from the head, hence the biblical instruction to shave the head of the leper for purifica-tion80 and the old Arabic practice of shaving a child's head before daubing it with sacrificial blood in order to purify them. The bald head of devotion and humility appears to be particularly associated with rites of initiation, such as those of Isis, and it is to make a sharp distinction between the Hebrew and pagan priesthoods that 75.

Despite this prohibition, later Christians shaved their heads in the manner of slaves so as to declare themselves as subservient to Christ. It is interesting to note that although the common percep-tion is of a circular tonsure, shaved in remembrance of the crown of thorns worn by Christ, there existed a variation that was shaved from ear to ear, which is the so-called \"Celtic tonsure\". This latter tonsure was worn by the Irish druids and adherents of Celtic Christianity, although those of the Roman tradition considered it unorthodox as it was akin to that worn by the heresiarch Simon Magus. As hair grows out of the head, wherein man's strength and spirit are held, the two have come to be considered as analogous to one another, such being exemplified in the story of Samson and Delilah (Samson glossing as 'man of the sun'). This belief gave rise to the practice of offering locks of hair, and thereby a part of one's own spirit and power, to the gods, whether as a libation or in the making of a binding oath to a patron god. There does exist a certain 'cap' that covers the head of some newborns, this being the Caput Galeatum ('head helmet'), more commonly known as the caul or 'sillyhow', meaning 'blessed' or 'happy hood'. Being 'born in the caul' is to be born in the amniotic sac, i.e. within water, and thus in a case of like-curing-like did the caul come to be considered as a talisman against drowning. Yet for the child so born it was also a harbinger of great luck, a sign of having the Sight and a charm against sorcerers and fairies. Chumbley comments that like the blood-red naevus and other distinguishing birth traits, the caul is a especially associated with witchcraft as a 'Mark of Cain', \"an anthropogenetic stigmata borne by the kindred of the Sabbat...signs that put the individual outside of the normative birth-state of the community\", it is to mark them out as Other, exiled from the herd82. As the virtue was held to remain with the caul, these highly prized talismans were impressed into paper so that they might be kept as an heirloom or sewn up in a bag to be worn about the neck, thereby keeping the child safe from drowning so long as he re-tained it. However, in light of the huge sums they could fetch on 81. See for example Leviticus 21:5 and Ezekiel 44:20. 82.

Others still believed that a caul-bearer who was parted from his caul would become a restless wanderer83, and should they be buried without it their spirit would never rest and would return to search for it. This latter belief is perhaps linked to the Icelandic tradition that a part of the soul or a person's guardian spirit (fylgia) is contained within it84. The notion of a caul bearer having a fylgia or co-walker bound to his caul is reminiscent of the belief that those destined to be one of the Benandanti were marked out at birth by being caul-born. They were believed to have the ability to leave their body at night in the shape of various spectral animals in order to battle evil witches and attend great feasts. Likewise is it believed in Slovenia and Hungary that children born with the caul possess shamanic powers, including those of shape-changing85. In many ways the shamanic virtue of the membranous cap recalls the hood of the robe, used to aid trance meditation and as a sign of solitary her-mitage, the withdrawal into the solitude of night's darkness. This concealing power of the hood is evoked in the figure of the shape-changing Woden, who wore a hood or large floppy hat to mask his face as he walked between the worlds, giving rise to his nickname grimr meaning 'masked man'. Intriguingly, Cochrane suggests that the \"cloak and broad-brimmed hat worn by some English witches\" are 'magical garments'86, both cloak and hat being combined as one in the witch's robe, the robe being \"hooded so it covers the face\"87. By covering the face with the hood, the veil of darkness descends upon man so that he might enter the secluded palace of Night and seek inspiration within its seething mass, the pre-existent seed-ground of all being. Then, in pulling back the hood, he is reborn into the light, bringing with him the 'dream' so that it might be manifested in the light of the revealed world. 83. Simpson, Jacqueline and Steve Roud.

Within the witch cult one common example is that of the Magister cloaked in a bestial mantle, paired with a horned head-dress. The earliest example of a horned headdress is from the early Mesolithic period, twenty-one of them having been discovered at Star Carr in North Yorkshire. These headdresses were fashioned of red deer skull-caps, complete with antlers, and had holes bored in the osseous caps so that leather thongs might be tied through them to secure the whole to the head. Images found depicting humans bearing horns or antlers upon their heads are too numerous to list, but are considered to be the precursors of certain ceremonial folk customs, such as the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, the Horn Fair and the mask of the Dorset Ooser. Judging from the writings of Saint Cesarius of Aries (470-543) and Theodore of Canterbury (668-690) in his 'Penitential Book', we might assume a more magical philosophy underpinning these customs, for both refer with disdain at the devilish practice of dressing in skins and animal headdresses so as to assume a bestial appearance and cease to become as men. Taken together, antlers and horns are commonly held to be symbolic of male virility and sexual potency, the horned Aries hav-ing rulership of the head. However, it is also worth taking into ac-count the differences between them, which reveals certain variances between those images depicting the witch god with antlers and those where he appears as a goat or bull headed theriomorph. Whilst horns are permanent, antlers are not; rather they begin growing in spring in preparation for mating and are shed naturally in winter after the mating season, thereby evoking the seasonal round. It is in light of this that stags have come to represent the solar year, as emblemised in the image of the sun shining betwixt his antlers, which in mytho-poetic terms aligns the stag with the sacrificial king as 'roebuck in the thicket'. It also reveals the nature of the white stag as psychopomp; the solar chariot having the abil-ity to traverse the worlds above and below, passing from life into death and back again. Herein we discover the twin powers of life"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"and death, for whilst the antlers represent the fleeting nature of light and life, symbolised by the risen sun temporarily illuminat-ing the world, the horns repre-sent the underlying and abiding darkness into which the world is plunged when the sun makes its inevitable return to the world below. Just as all life originates in and returns to the black loam of the horizon, so too does the revealed world emanate from and return to the dark hidden realm of Night. The antlered headdress as representative of the roebuck in the thicket, or sacrificial king, speaks particularly of the role of the Magister in some traditions. Just as he is given his right to rule by decree of the goddess of the Land, evoking the gifting of the sword of rulership to Arthur from the body of the feminine stone, it is at her hands that he will die at the end of his reign, although in practice this now takes the form of a sacrifice made in his stead88. Within his letters, Cochrane intriguingly wrote \"the hunter, old Tubal-Cain, and the Roebuck are one and the same Divine Presence in the shape of fate or wyrd\"89. This in part lurks back to the slaying of the antlered theriomorph and first murderer Cain by his own descendents, Tubal-Cain and Lamech, .md thus in a twist of fate the hunter becomes the hunted, the young forever supplanting the old in the processes of evolution. The horned Dionysus fulfils a similar role, for whilst he has the appellation of Zagreus ('the great hunter'), as a child he was luinted by the Titans, who tore him into seven pieces and consumed them. Fortunately Zeus saved his heart, and it was from this that he was later resurrected. This life-death-birth cycle formed the basis of Dionysius' role in the mystery religions and clearly evokes the figure of the sacrificial king. KH. Jones, Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, p. 145.

The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 133."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Related to the antlered headdress is the horned helmet, such being known from depictions and finds throughout Bronze and Iron Age Europe. One particularly interesting example of an Iron Age ceremonial helmet (150-50 BC) was dredged from the Thames and had stylised conical horns fashioned of bronze. Despite the popular conception of Viking warriors going to battle in horned helmets, this headwear appear to have been mainly ceremonial in purpose. However, it remains true that Odin's chosen warriors, the Einherjar, were said to have worn horned helmets, and similarly are two spear-wielding warriors depicted wearing comparable headwear on one of the decorative plates of the Sutton Hoo helmet. It is this ceremonial use of horned headwear that has passed into the modern witch cult, such vestments being worn by the male leader of a coven or placed upon the stang as the representative of the horned master in the witch rites. Whilst the wearing of horns and other animal headdresses are under the patronage of the witch god in his aspect of Lord of the Beasts, there is also tradition in dressing the scalp with the harvest of field and forest, such customs being ruled by the verdant Lord of the Green. The wearing of chaplets upon the head grew from the old custom of decorating the hair with flowers, such being particularly common during festivities. However, garlands of flowers were also worn upon the heads of kings, priests, supplicants and worshippers during religious and sacrificial rites to distinguish, magically differentiate and set them apart. Such a practice was especially common in the Greco-Roman period, as exampled in the leaf chaplets worn during the Eleusinian mysteries and the laurel wreaths worn during the Andanian mysteries, but it is also a feature familiar to British tradition, as exemplified in the flowers bedecking the hair of the May Day revellers. Oftentimes the leafy or floral garland was fashioned with herbal matter sacred to the god(s) to whom the bequest was being made or the patron overseeing the festival or rite. A classic example of this is the bay laurel wreath that adorned the head of Apollo, which being the embodiment of victory came to be worn by the victors at the Pythian games held in his honour. These wreaths of victory were known as stephanos and were woven of plants sacred to the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"god(s) in whose honour the competition was held, the Isthmian games, for example, being under the patronage of Poseidon were fashioned of pine. Similarly, it was European folk custom to weave the last ear of corn into a wreath, which was worn by the person who cut it, marking them as an embodiment of the corn divinity90. Wreaths were sometimes placed also upon the heads of idols and statues of sacred personages, such being a particularly common practice amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans91. Within the witch cult there exists a similar practice, whereby the stang as an embodiment of the witch god is sometimes dressed with a chaplet of plant matter sacred to that aspect of the god being summoned. Schulke for example tells us that in the Old Craft crowns of oak or holly, depending upon the aspect of the god evoked, were placed upon the skull of a stag set upon a pole92. This is evocative of the manner in which the axial maypole was sometimes topped with the crown, and similarly are various maces, sceptres, rods and magical staves so-dressed. We might relate this to the old symbol of the cross and the crown, wherein the powers of the philosophical cross are surmounted by those of the Crown of Heaven, whose import we shall soon discuss. In other instances an herbal wreath might be placed upon a skull fetish, whether human or animal, or similar idol so as to evoke the jiowers. Similarly are the animals sacred to the gods sometimes crowned with wreaths, and we might see something of this in such folk rites as the crowning of the Penglaz, the coronation of the goat at Puck Fair and the plaiting of flowers in the manes of horses during the May festivals. Within Christian tradition an image of the Virgin Mary was sometimes paraded through towns during the month of May and ceremonially crowned with flowers, most often hawthorn, to mark her out as Queen of Heaven. This crowning of Mary's statue is still carried on in some Roman Catholic parishes, which resounds with the echoes of the May Queen's crowning with a garland of hawthorn93. 1)0.

So it is that chaplets of certain herbs come to have especial association with certain rites, such as the aforementioned use of hawthorn in the May festivities, the evergreen garlands for the promotion of long-life, and the \"wreath of death-dealing yew\" worn to bind the hoary hair of the necromantic priest94. They are also of much use in the arts of magic, such as the talismanic ivy wreath, which when woven and placed upon the head \"may be employed against any spiritual harassment, be it in waking or sleep\"95, the leafy circlet forming a protective boundary line about the head. Perhaps the most renowned vegetal chaplet is the famed 'crown of thorns' worn by Christ at his crucifixion, such being akin to the vegetal wreaths sometimes worn to mark out sacrificial victims in the Greco-Roman world96. Indeed, even sacrificial animals were sometimes so-dressed, Flaccus for example making reference to a black bull with \"his brow rough with yew\"97. This crown of thorns hearkens back to the fall of man, for when Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden tree the ground was cursed so that thorns and thistles were brought forth upon it98, thorns being the defensive, punitive and warding part of a plant. Thorns accordingly came to be symbolic of transgression, punishment and suffering, and in wearing a crown of thorns Christ becomes identified with the sacrificial king, the scapegoat who bears away the sins and transgressions of man. This crown also comes to symbolise the trials and ordeals that the sorcerer must undergo in order to become liberated from the world of clay and be reborn into that of the spirit, in this sense the crown is also a symbol of victory over death. 94.

More than this, the crown of thorns is evocative of the impenetrable thicket, with such tangled briars sometimes being raised as a protective and warding circle99. In British folklore the crown of thorns manifests as a wreath of holly and blackthorn, compounding the association blackthorn has in superstition with suffering and bad luck. Although scarlet, hollen berries were said to have once been white, but became reddened by the blood that fell from the Lightbearer as he hung upon the cross. These two herbs fashioned into a garland and placed on an apposite idol are of utmost use in the conjuration of the Dark Master and also in the raising of a protective hedge. Sometimes the crown of thorns is shown as embracing the heart of the Lightbearer, which is oftentimes pierced with a spear, the heart being mystically aligned with the centre of the cross. This is known as the Sacred Heart of Jesus and shares some commonality also with the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which instead of thorns is surrounded by a wreath of roses. Both of these images partake of the symbolism of the heart, which is a symbolism transcending time and place, and in some cases the heart might be replaced with a single rose. Indeed, within it we might see a veritable cipher of the witch's 'royal circle', with the heart and hearth of the crossroads being warded by thickets, which in turn gives rise to the golden ring. In biblical tradition, upon the death of Christ the bloodied 'crown of thorns' becomes transfigured into a golden crown of glory100, such speaking of his transformation from a man of flesh and blood into a man of light and spirit. The moment of transformation is his sacrifice upon the cross, which might be syncretised with the many accounts of mythological bearers of light who have been slain upon a tree. Herein we specifically witness the transmuting of the rosy red blood into gold, the way of opposition and sacrifice giving rise to the golden treasures of the 99. Viridarium Umbris pp 117-120. 100.

This is sometimes symbolised in the Christian mythos by the image of the Cross and Crown, the trials and suffering yielding a heavenly reward. The golden crown as a sign of the 'man of spirit' risen from the 'man of clay' is analogous to the corona of light surrounding the head of sacred personages in the iconography of divers faiths, whether god, angel, saint, divine king or hero. This eminence is related to the whole-body radiance or 'shining cloak of man' that originates from the transfigured man, and is often depicted sur-rounding Christ, Mary and some saints. This cranial emanation of light marks out those who are literally 'enlightened' and sometimes takes the form of a circular outpouring of light evocative of the solar rays, although othertimes it appears as dancing flames. This latter manifestation of spiritual enlightenment calls to mind the Sepker Yetzirab wherein it is said that the head is formed from and predominates in the primordial fire, symbolised by the Hebrew letter Shin, whose three points or teeth are suggestive of a flaming crown. It is also reminiscent of a line from the SongofAmergin, \"I am the god who puts fire in the head\"101, which Graves further as-sociates with the image of the lightning-struck oak and the sooty faces of those revellers who dance betwixt the Midsummer fires102, their faces charred by the flames and blackened by wisdom, but we shall return to this when we consider the black-face tradition. In this respect it is interesting that in early Christian iconography Christ was generally only portrayed crowned with a corona of light in those images depicting him after his Baptism at the hands of St. John. In Qabalism we might consider this as Kether, 'the crown', which corresponds with the highest level of consciousness, and has thus come to be associated with the head.

It is in this sense that the crown of the tree (sometimes identified with mistletoe) becomes the crown of heaven as \"the Great Arch, the Will to Power which drives the earthly substrate ever toward manifestation\"106. Amid the witch cult there exists a technique whereby the sleeping Serpent coiled in the base of the spine is awakened and drawn along the spinal axis until it reaches the summit of the skull, which might be imagined as an osseous Castle at whose centre we find the Graal-Cauldron. Such is to speak of the manner in which the sexual fire is aroused and transmuted into spiritual fire, literally 'setting the head afire'. Besides aiding in the unfoldment of the secret faculties, which have their analogues in the physical senses, such a technique also connects man with god. In this manner man might receive wisdom, power and inspiration, which might be symbolically rendered as the descent of the Serpent of Light from the canopy of the Tree or as the philtre poured from the Cauldron into the vessel of the skull-cup. Yet the head is also aligned with the source from which the created world emanates. This is exemplified in the utterance of the Logos from the lips of the demiurge, the created world streaming outwards from the wellspring of the mouth, which shares certain similitude with the image of the leaves unfurling from the mouth of the Green Man. As we have noted, it is through the suture at the apex of the skull that the spirit passes at death and during trance so as to 'fly free'. In considering the foregoing discussion we come to understand that having passed through the subtle centres aligned upon the spinal axis, and having reached the Crown as 'the One beyond the Seven', the spirit transcends the material realm and enters the \"Silence where-in the whole cipher of the mysteries is 104.

Intriguingly, Chumbley relates that the Crown is sometimes represented by the circular form of Alif, which became two-horned to represent the Bull (Alif meaning 'ox'), thereby signifying the Horned One as Initiator108. This calls to mind also the use of the horned crown in the evocation of the theriomorphic Primal Master. It is he who stands as guardian and gate betwixt the witch and that which is beyond, hence his intimate association with the Crown as the One Light from which the seven rays shine and with the Point where created man gains comprehension of the Source as First Principle and Uncreated Light.

Andrew Chumbley, Azoetia 109 The condition of the clay body suffused with Divine Light is not always represented in the imagery of solar rays shining from man's head, it may also be found symbolised by a crown of stars. This starry circle becomes as though a celestial wreath, evoking the stellar powers that whirl about the centre of the heavens, these being as gates upon the horizon of the shining ring. Most often the crown is depicted as seven stars above the head of a divine personage and is taken to indicate their immortality. It marks them out as one of the starry race, those whose hearts contain \"a spark of that mysterious dark angelic fire that first breathed life into the clay of this world\"110. The theme of immortality is also encoded in the crown as a zodiacal circlet of twelve stars, thereby evoking the journey of the sun through the seasonal signs, and thus through the cycles of time overseen by Fate. By virtue of this journey from birth to death to subsequent resurrection, the solar orb comes to denote the everlasting light in the figure of the sacrificial lightbearer. 107. Chumbley, Qutub. 108.

A crown of twelve stars was worn by Mary when in her aspect of the Queen of Heaven, which evokes the mythic Arianrhod (meaning 'silver wheel') and identifies her with the seasonal whirling of the celestial vaults. Her heavenly abode (Caer Arianrhod) is identified with Corona Borealis, 'the crown of the north wind', and with Caer Sidi, the ever-revolving castle of the Otherworld, which has led some to suggest a connection with the Polestar as the still axis-point of the heavens that turns without motion. It was in her palace that Taliesin spent three periods111, Graves de-claring this time in her spiral castle of death and rebirth to be as though in \"royal purgatory awaiting resurrection\"112. This is to identify Arianrhod as a manifestation of the Goddess as Creator and Destroyer, Taliesin becoming a manifestation of the Sun/Son God whom she both births and consumes. Corona Borealis is also known as 'Ariadne's Crown' in reference to that diadem gifted by Dionysius to his immortal bride Ariadne113, who mythically has much in common with Arianrhod. It is revealing then that the Cretan poet Epimenides (6th Century BC) wrote that Theseus only found his way through the dark and spiralling labyrinth by virtue of the light radiating from this golden crown, which was gifted to him by Ariadne. The Queen of Heaven is especially associated with the moon, which when enhaloed by the corona or ringed by a circlet evokes a whole body of folkloric portents and omens. She is sometimes depicted wearing a crown of seven stars, and Cochrane tells us that these seven stars above the Head of the Moon are 'the Goddesses' and are to be seen in the Plough or Haywain114. In the folksong 'Green Grow the Rushes O' these seven sisters are evoked in the 111. From the riddle-poem Hanes Taliesin. 112. Graves, The White Goddess, p. 94. 113.

In mythology the Queen of Heaven sometimes takes the form of a harlot or fallen woman, which is to say she descends from her exalted heavenly position to become immersed in the physical world. This 'fall' is reminiscent of that of Sophia, who was considered to have fallen from grace and helped to create the material world. Within Gnostic belief it is through her that the seven builders are brought forth, and just as the head rules the limbs, so too is the world shaped through the agency of their seven arms in accordance with the guiding principle of her Divine Wisdom. Biblical tradition relates Sophia's gift of Wisdom as a literal crowning of man's head, the home of his spirit, \"She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown\"11J. This recalls the manner in which not only wisdom and enlightenment are conferred to man, but also power and authority, such speaking of the radiant crown worn as a symbol of the divine right to rule. The story of kingship is tightly bound to the concept of sovereignty as a god-given gift, as epitomised by the role of the stone in choosing he to whom the sword of rulership is to be proffered, which is to identify the king as a chosen embodiment of the godhead. Accordingly, just as the right to rule might be symbolised by a heavenly golden crown descending to surmount the priest-king, so too is the crown of divine authority passed from one king to the next when the old king is slain or dies. Such a philosophy is of course not entirely alien to the manner in which the priesthood of certain witch cults gain their divine right to intercede between man and his gods, and how such a divine right passes to their successor. This divine right could also be taken away, a fallen crown sometimes being used to symbolise the collapse of those kingdoms that had fallen out of favour with their god(s). In biblical tradition god has the ability to remove the divine authority of both king and priest, for example, \"Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be same: exalt him that is low and abase him that is high\"\"6. 115. Proverbs 4:9. 116. Ezekiel 21:26."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Crowns differ from the more practical and utilitarian hat, generally being emblematic of achievement and pre-eminence, although they may also indicate divine nature, as exemplified in the crowns worn by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Furthermore, as a symbol of divine authority, they have great tradition of being worn not only by kings but also by priests and magicians, these roles being brought together in the figure of the priest-king. In ceremonial magic the crown rising above the head symbolises \"the Attainment of the Work\" and may take in various symbols to represent particular aspects of the Magi's Work, such as pentagrams, hexagrams, serpents and ram's horns. Othertimes the circlet might be adorned with apposite gems, denoting the stars of the heavens circling the polar-axis and the stations upon the golden ring of Time. This crown of the magus may also include a crimson cap of maintenance to signify concealment, the blood of God and the flood of glory falling upon the magician from above117. However, despite these symbolic variations its basis is a plain circlet of gold representing the eternal circle of perfection, although we might equally consider it as kingly solar symbol denoting the wearer receiving their Light from upon high. Such a circlet is somewhat reminiscent of the cornonoa radiata, or 'chaplet studded with sunbeams'118, worn by Roman emperors partaking in the cult of Sol Invictus, and also of the crown placed upon the head of the supplicant by the point of a sword in the Mithraic mysteries with the words \"Mithras is my Crown\". Of course, other metals besides gold are used to fashion the occultist's crown. On the basis of being as if earthly reflections of the heavenly lights, the 'fallen' metallic ores have certain powers ascribed to them, and in fashioning circlets of these metals the self-same powers can be drawn upon by the wearer. Yet more than this, these crowns denote the divine authority of the magus and their rulership over the planetary powers, intelligences and spirits corresponding to that metal. In this sense they are related to the Magus-Band, which is a coloured band of parchment or fabric wound about the forehead and embroidered with various signs and and symbols to express the nature of the sorcerer's work and their 117.

In alchemy the crown represents the successful completion of the alchemical operation and the attainment of an individual magisterium. It also represents the purification and perfection of metals, wherein they are made royal. In some alchemical works this is portrayed in the image of planetary spirits receiving their crowns from the king, that is to say the heavenly regents delivering their power from the Sun, each being as refractions of the One Light. In Margarita Pretiosa for example, the planetary spirits are first shown bowing bare-headed before their king, but then after transmutation are depicted with crowns to denote their spiritual evolution120. The image of the Seven Planetary Lights as rays or refractions of the One Light is evocative of the crown of peacock feathers. In Wolfram von Eschenbach's 'ParzivaT, the Fisher King Anfortas is described as wearing such a peacock-crown, which is an intriguing vision that brings together a variety of mythic themes. In essence it speaks of a successive line of priest-kings, whom have their origin in a primal archetypal ancestor, each being charged with the guardianship of a sacred vessel (Holy Grail). Yet more than this, in the mystical bond existing betwixt the health of the Fisher King, adorned with his crown of peacock feathers, and the health of the land we find an embodiment of the Peacock Angel as Lord of the World, all having mythically endured a 'fall from grace'. This correlation is all the more striking when one takes into account the legend of the Holy Grail being wrought from the Lapis Exilis, the emerald that fell from the crown of that other fallen angel of renown, Lucifer. When this radiant-green venereal stone fell from the starry heavens it brought light and life into the dark abyss, evoking the Fisher King's role in the greening of the kingdom through the agency of the Grail, and also calling to mind the figure of the Green Man himself. 119.

Yet it is intriguing that there is a history of brimless pointed hats being associated with magic and the occult arts in general, as well as with the witches, wizards and dwarfs of European mythology, which is perhaps what led the Church to denounce pointed hats as being evocative of the Devil's horns. Some posit that the classic image of the wizard's hat emblazoned with symbols of the whirling celestial bodies and its apex pointing to the heavenly axis is modelled on the floppy hat worn by Woden, much like other aspects of the archetypal wizard's appearance, such as his robe, staff, long grey hair and beard. However, there is also a striking resemblance here with the golden ceremonial hats discovered in Central Europe, which date back to 10 BCE. These were fashioned from a single piece of gold and inscribed with symbols believed to function as an astronomical calendrical device based upon the nineteen year metonic cycle. However, pointed hats are not peculiar to occultism, rather they are common to the priestly castes of many faiths and cultures, especially those with a sacrificial bent or of a masculine and solar persuasion, such as the mitre of Christian tradition, which has led some to deduce them as having phallic significance122. Of the many 121. Some magical practitioners actively courted this stereotype by dressing in conical hats, cloaks emblazoned with magical sigils and so forth as an outward sign of their calling (Howard, Michael: West Country Witches p. 52). 122.

Some posit this Mithraic Cap as \"the origin of the priestly mitre of all faiths...worn by the priest in sacrifice\", and was worn by men with the point forwards, but by women with the point back, the apex being known as the 'christa' and signifying the triumphal summit\"3. Jennings, in his work on the Rosicrucians, relates that the black bonnet conique is a successor of the high pointed caps worn by the Persian fire worshippers and the black caps worn by the Bohemians in the East, further linking it to the bonnet of the 'fire workers', 'fire raisers' and servants of Vulcan (Hephaestus was sometimes depicted wearing a conical pileus hat). He goes on to posit that this later evolved into the loose black Hussar Cap \"of Tubal-Cain, the Smiths and Artful Workers in Nature\"114. Whilst the black pointed hat might be symbolic of the artful smith, when in its form of the bonnet rouge it calls to mind the archetypal female witch in her red bonnet, hence the common appellation of Old Mother Red-Cap for reputed witches. Wearing a red cap in the open was one way of publically declaring one's magical powers and occult interests, identifying the wearer as being apart from the rest of society125. The Phrygian Cap when of a sanguine hue was known as the 'cap of liberty', which gave rise to the common name for the similar looking 'liberty cap' mushroom. Intriguingly, 'mother red cap' is a common name for another vision-producing mushroom, that of the Fly Agaric, evoking the archetypal witch in her red bonnet. Red hats are also worn by various fair folk, such as the murderous powries or redcaps, which folklore attests are dyed red with the blood of their human victims, and the more benign gnome or kabouter of Dutch mythology. In the above we have seen how the circular golden crown of the eternal spirit gives rise to a succession of coverings; the initial cap 123. Jennings, Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries. 124.

From the vegetal wreaths, flowery corollas and chaplets of thorns, which later gave way to the gem-adorned crowns of precious metals worn by king, priest and magician alike, to the pointed caps of witch, magician and fair folk, each of these head-coverings have the ability to deliver certain virtues to the wearer, whether to protect, bestow power or signify exaltation or deference. They have been worn by god, idol, angel, king, priest, witch and wizard, bride and nun alike, placed on the heads of sacrificial victims, on the dead and as offerings upon the grave itself, all of which demonstrates the tremendous import of the sacred head. lthough we touched upon some of the mysteries of the face when discussing the head, the face has an especial significance of its own. In essence it is the revealed form of a thing; the manifested expression of that which lies within and the part that is projected outwards to the world. Upon the face, its physiognomy and expressions are written many truths, and it is through the agency of this outer facade that we encounter the Arcanum. Similarly, it is via the medium of the perceptive senses here housed that we are able to observe and interact with the world about us. As a round mirror reflecting that which is beneath, the countenance of the face is much akin to the image of the full moon receiving and reflecting the light of the solar body. That is to say that just as the head is crowned with a corona of stars, so too does the face become as if Dame Luna cupping or embracing the Sun, with the Fire becoming imprisoned in the body of form. Accordingly is the face of the enlightened one often given as shining like the syn (see earlier discussion on the white robes of ascension). In essence all face coverings can be considered to have a dual function, these being to conceal that which is beneath in the manner of the veil and to reveal or project forth a new guise in the Veil and Mask: The Twin Embracements of the Face"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"manner of the mask. However, although there are subtle differ-ences between them they both serve to cover the truth that resides beneath. In the instance of the veil the virtue is purely to conceal, as in 'to draw a veil over' something, yet even this might be directed to various ends. In covering a thing in order to obscure it there is a hint of deception, such often working to hide the identity of that which lies beneath, yet there is also a protective aspect. Besides the preservation of modesty and the mundane protection from the elements that such face-coverings provide, there is also a more spiritual protection afforded. In Roman weddings, for example, the bridal veil, or Flammeum, was believed to protect the bride from nefarious spirits on her wedding day, the head being considered sacred yet vulnerable in ancient thought. Others posit that it relates to the need for sacred vows to be made under a veil, the act of veiling separating the sacred from the profane126. It is this latter philosophy of veils shielding the sacred from the eyes of the profane that is most germane to the current discussion. Herein is found reference to the use of the veil to obscure the sacred adytum of the many faiths from the gaze of the non-initiated, thereby demarking the hallowed arena within which the image of the cultic god is safely and honourably housed. When covered by the veil this innermost sacred sanctuary becomes identified with the cranium, the temple of the one spirit, wherein the image of the godhead might be manifested so that it may come to speak its oracle, such enciphering a process by which gods and spirits might be invoked. There is an intriguing passage in Exodus that deals with this theme, wherein Moses comes down from Mount Sinai \"unaware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord\" and when the Israelites were unable to look upon his shining face he covered it with a veil127, yet it is notable that he removed it when speaking to God. Within this we find a certain esoteric significance, for whilst the Israelites are too ignorant to face the divine light, when meeting God Moses lifts the concealing veil so that they might metaphorically meet 'face-126. Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries, p. 187. 127. See both Exodus 34:32-35 and 2 Corinthians 3:13 regarding the veil of Moses."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"to-face', such having an import beyond that suggested by a mundane reading. Within this is a semblance also to that veil worn by the Virgin Isis, Manly Hall relating how she reveals her wisdom only to the tried and initiated few who have earned the right to enter her sacred presence, whence they might \"tear from the veiled figure of Nature its shroud of obscurity and stand face to face with the Divine Reality\"128. This piercing of the veil so as to enter the inner temple and gaze upon the face of the divine is somewhat reminiscent of the lifting of the protective bridal veil, further calling to mind the mystical marriage denoted by the veiling of those who dedicate themselves to the religious life129. Although comparable to the many other myths and legends treating of transfigured man, those passages relating to the shining face of Moses are particularly significant in that they describe his face as shining with the reflected light of the divine. In similitude to the manner in which the moon is struck by the solar rays, the face of transfigured man is thus most often portrayed as being ablaze with effulgence, the golden light reflected out to the sub-lunar world as a silvery-white radiance. Whilst this accounts for the majority of depictions, in other instances the face becomes blackened in the divine presence, and a clue to the significance of this is contained in the Song of Solomon, wherein Sheba says \"look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun has looked upon me\". This correlation between the searing solar fire and the scorched black face is also referred to by Graves, who says that the faces of the Midsummer revellers became sootied as they leap betwixt the twin fires, the smoke giving rise to divine inspiration130. Of especial significance here is the figure of the 'Coal Black Smith', whose face becomes blackened like all those who work with the fire of the forge. He is evocative of both the divine blacksmith and the Horned God as Opposer, that is to say the black-faced Devil who dances within the hellish flames of the forge. Herein we find reference to the purifying and transformative fire, which breaks things down so that essence or spirit is released from the encaging form, with the ashes that remain becoming symbolic of this process of death and sacrifice through which new life arises131. 130.

It is intriguing then that both the words 'black' and 'charcoal' have a common origin in the Arabic root FHM, meaning 'to perceive' and 'to be wise'132. Chumbley posits that ritual 'blackening' as used in the modern witch cult may in fact have its root in the similar practices of the Maskarae of Persia and the Dhulqarneni of Morocco133. 132.

Related to this is the intriguing figure of the red and black-faced Harlequin, thought to derive from the black-faced Hellequin of the French passion plays who roams the countryside at night on horseback, leading the la maisnie Hellequin, a horde of demons, as they gather up the souls of the damned and deliver them to Hell. Some posit that he is akin to the Old English Herla Cyning (King Herla), who is unsurprisingly identified with Woden in his more 'devilish' aspect as leader of the Wild Hunt, the ritual re-enactment of which sometimes involved ritually painting the body black, after the manner of the Germanic Harii. It is this process of opposition, trial and death, symbolised by the casting of the body into the flames, that awakens the inner fire, enabling the sorcerer to go back to the seed-core at the centre of their being. In alchemical terms this process often takes place in the vessel as a simulacrum of the body, identified by some as the seething cauldron, and is subject to the flames tended by the black-faced one himself, his flame-charred countenance giving rise to his appellation of 'burnt one' (a la Set). So it is then that this initial saturnine phase is oft-represented by the Death's Head, a primal symbol of the Horned Lord of the Tomb, as well as by those devilish familiars the raven and lead-black toad. Besides the practice of blacking the face to become 'the Devil', as found in the initiatory rites of the Horseman's Word134, the black-face more arcanely comes to represent those who have looked upon the Fire of the One Spirit face-to-face and thrown themselves upon it, like a moth unto the flame, and yet have emerged from their ashes in a new flesh, a veritable 'master' of the fire. This phase of nigredo gives birth to the Peacock's Tail, the colours of its plumage evoking the transformative processes, and leads to the attainment of albedo or baptisma, the discovery of the hermaphroditic one light from which the seven rays proceed.

Once at this stage the sorcerer has no need of books or external guides for they have found the informing source of their power, but this must be fixated and made durable so that it is 'ever present' by the process of rubedo, such being akin to resurrection. Accordingly do the Sufis have the maxim Da tariki, tariqat, meaning, \"In the darkness, The Path.\" Such a mystery is sometimes worked by virtue of the veil in its form of 'blindfold', for in the same way that a gag is used to bind the mouth from speaking, so too does the blindfold come to close the mundane sense of sight, forcing one to look within. This is to draw upon the aspect of the mask that hinders or distorts certain faculties and facets of the True Face, whilst emphasising or revealing others. Besides the use of the blindfold and hood, the seer may sometimes cover his eyes with his hands, thereby entering the dark inner realm, wherein the moth takes flight as the inner eye so as to seek out the flame of the spirit, such 'vision' being free of the constraints of time and place. These practices are emblematised by the shadowy figure of the hooded and black-faced master, some aligning him with the figure of Saturn \"who is both masculine and feminine, sex being indifferent to the 'Divine Absraction', and whose face is masked in Darkness\"135. Being symbolic of'closed eyes', such veils and the states of con-sciousness arising from their use are evocative of sleep for they speed our return to the night-time realm, the black formless void as the 'cradle of possibilities' wherein all finds its point of inception and final resting place. Sleep is thus the dark realm of secret and hidden knowledge, of mystery and of magic; \"all is possible in 'sleep' because 'dreams' are in sleep, 'god' is in sleep\"136.

In a negative sense this implies ignorance of a thing, yet in esoteric matters a more exalted meaning is oft implied. Within the tarot, for example, the blindfold graces the figure of Justice, which is popularly conceived to be blind, like love, and not deceived or seduced by external appearance. Blindfolds are similarly used in initiation rites to evoke 'blindness', sometimes aping the figure of Christ bound and blindfolded, scourged and mocked, before his sacrificial death and later resurrection. In mythology, blindness is often associated with seers, Odin for example sacrificed one eye to Mimir's Well so as to drink from its waters of wisdom and gain knowledge of the past, present and future, that is to say he sacrificed mundane sight for a supra-physical sight. This supra-physical sight is sometimes considered to be housed in the third eye as a blazing star that shines betwixt the golden right and silvery left eyes, thereby resolving the duality of the twain heavenly bodies in much the same manner as the burning brand between the horns of the sabbatic goat. This 'third-eye' is held by some to be analogous to the 'Mark of Cain' and is adorned in some faiths by a jewel, which not only harks back to Lucifer's emerald and the occultist's diadem, but also to the mirror upon the brow of Isis, such recalling the 'radiant brow' of Taliesin. This 'eye' is sometimes marked with particular signs and sigils related to specific works, and is oft-times consecrated with powders, ashes and washes, especially within baptismal and initiatory rites. Although physically a receptive organ, the eyes have long been held to have an ability to project power, such being the basis of the belief in the evil eye and fascination. Agrippa describes fascination as a binding or ligation, the heart enflamed giving rise to a spiritual vapour that proceeds from the eyes as rays, he goes on to say that such rays may enter the eyes of the victim and there affect the spirit of the bewitched137.

The word 'mask' derives from the word 'masque', meaning to cover the face so as to hide or guard it, such emphasising the veiling aspei I of the adornment, which as we have seen speaks more of protecting the sacred from the profane than of mere deception. Herein wc find reference to the use of grotesque and hideous masks as an amuletic and protective device to ward against evil.

Another etymology of the word 'mask' is that it derives from a pre-Indo-European language and is related to the Occitan mascara, meaning to blacken or darken (the face), with the old Occitan masco glossing as 'witch'. This relationship between the blacking of the face, masks and witchcraft is also found in the 'Maskarae', a Persian sect of sorcerers who blackened their faces and bodies and then magically aped the forms of beasts, spirits and gods whilst dancing about in a circle. Chumbley, when commenting on the similarity existing between these rites and those of the Sabbatic Tradition, proposed that the maskh, as an Arabian magical technique of therio-anthropic transformation, could be the origin of our words mask and masquerade141. Although we have mostly spoken here of'blackening' in context of ritual facial adornments, this being a localised form of 'body-painting' and a manifestation of make-up as mask, other colours besides black have been used to daub and decorate face and mask alike in many cultures the world over. One such example is the face whitened with flour, which being the ground down remains of corn is rather evocative of the relationship existing betwixt ash and wood, and it is notable that both white flour and black ash are used to trace the witch circle. It also calls to mind the mythos of the sacrificial king who dies at the hand of the pale-faced queen or 'hag of the mill', whom is described as 'the woman white with flour' '42. In this she has mythological ties with Alphito the 'goddess of the barley flour' (from alphita meaning 'white flour'), whom some folklorists consider a manifestation of the \"corn mother\" and \"white goddess\", and considering her avian shape-changing and murderous intent towards children is somewhat reminiscent of Lilith. Graves suggests that revellers once made their faces white 141. Qutub, P72. 142. Graves, The White Goddess."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"in imitation of her emblem, the silvery white moon'4', evoking the opposite yet complimentary virtues of the nourishing milk and the pallid complexion of the icy cold corpse. In making the face ax waxen as the corpse the witch thus becomes aligned with her deathly powers, literally mimicking the ashen countenance of those who ride out with in her spectral throng. Besides the black face of the smith and the white countenance of the pale-faced queen, pigments and dyes from the natural world may be used to stain the skin other colours. Alder for example is given by Graves to give three dyes, red from the bark for fire, green from the flowers for water, and brown from the twigs for earth. He also remarks that the obsolete name ro-eim for alder glosses .is 'that which reddens the face', calling to mind the crimson-stained heroes of the Welsh Triads and the powers of blood and fire''M. The use of the alder leaves to make the skin green, the colour of the faeries, is also reminiscent of the fashioning of leafy masks, such forming the basis of the foliate head or Green Man. The vegetal mask as a representation of the verdant spirit moving through nature is found throughout time and place under many names and guises. More esoteric interpretations speculate that 'green man' imagery represents the annual cycles of birth, growth, decay and renewal, which is intriguing in light of some later Christian examples that depict leaves and tendrils unfurling from the eye-sockets and mouth of a human skull. We might see in this a correlation with the 'head set afire', the scarlet flame and blood being replaced by green vegetal matter and sap, both depicting .1 type of initiatory consciousness aroused by virtue of spine and trunk. The foliate face of the Devil in Green is sometimes evoked through a telesmatic imagining of the mask, such being a ritual as-sumption of the Verdant Lord. An example of this is given by William Gray, which he purports to have been worked by Cochrane's coven, and involves envisioning a seven-pointed leaf over the face and touching specific points upon it as a prayer is re-cited to the Creator, who brought order from chaos145.

Within this one might discern the image of the deviating and serpentine descent of power via the paths upon the tree, and its subsequent return along the 'straight path' to the source, such being reminiscent of the deliverance or 'fall' of the Divine Child to earth and his later re-ascension to the heavenly realm; it is to reveal the true nature of his parentage and the manner of his eventual return. This ascription of parts of the face to certain powers and faculties isn't alien to occultism in general, for besides the sagittal suture the face has seven openings that are ruled in the occult sciences by seven powers; \"the right ear to Saturn, the left to Jupiter, the right nostril to Mars, the left to Venus, the right eye to the Sun, the left to the Moon and the mouth to Mercury\"146. These are said by Agrippa to be placed in order of purity, those uppermost in man being the most noble, that is to say the eyes are the most pure, having an affinity with Fire, then the ears being comparable with Air, then the nostrils being betwixt Air and Water and finally the mouth, which partakes of Water (Earth is reserved for the fifth sense of touch whose power resides in the hand). Agrippa also asserts that the noblest senses are those which perceive the furthest, with Sight and Fire being most subtle whilst Touch and Earth are the grossest147. These facial senses are considered by some as falling into a natural trinity; the eyes as the spiritual power that comprehends, the nostrils as the preservative and vivifying power and the mouth/ears representing the material Demiurgic power of the lower world as embodied in the creative Word148. This Word is the LOGOS, and born from this One Word are the seven powers that create the world, these being embodied in the seven breaths or vowel sounds. This Word as the causative agent of the casual world is also envisioned in the leaves sprouting and unfurling from the mouth of the foliate faced Green Man. 146.

In cabbalism the left and right sides of the face equate with Binah (Understanding) and Chokmah (Wisdom), which conjoined with Kether the Crown forms the Supernal Triad. Returning to the subject of facial adornment, comparable to the faerie 'greening' of the skin and the wearing of vegetal masks is the ritual assumption of animal masks, such falling into the theriomorphic rites of shamanic guising. Transformation into animals is a feature of a number of cults, sects and religions, including those of witchcraft; the witch being considered capable of 'becoming' certain beasts. Such shape-changing is immortalised in the well-known folk song 'The Two Magicians', wherein the protagonists take on a series of bestial forms in order to outdo one another, such a theme being found not only in other tales, like that of Cerridwen and Taliesin, but also in the shape-changing formula given by Isobel Gowdie. It is obvious that such a change in form refers not to an actual bodily metamorphosis but rather to a more esoteric transformation of the 'flesh', which may be facilitated by the use of a series of masks and bestial skins, but may equally occur on a purely supra-physical level, such being exemplified in the tales of witches' spirits going forth in the guise of a hare or other beasts. Herein we encounter the crux of the mask's power, for in wear-ing it we blur the line between our own persona and that of the thing we wish to become until the two are as if one, for unlike the scientist who would seek to understand his subject by examining its external form, the witch instead gains their knowledge by over-coming the barrier that separates the observer from the observed, becoming the perceived itself. In this way various animal powers may be called upon and assumed, such speaking of an alignment of human virtue with that of animalistic behaviour and power. This coalition of powers is exemplified in the mundane world by the likes of the medieval bestiaries, the use of bestial appellations (like 'wolfshead' for an outlaw) and various analogies that comparc human traits to those of animals, such 'as strong as an ox', 'wise as an owl' or 'cunning as a fox'."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Within this practice there exists the echo of totemism, where a people's kinship with a certain spirit or god was often represented by the head of that animal with which their patron was associated. In this we are reminded of the many images of animal-headed gods and anthropomorphic beasts found the world over, but most well-known in Egyptian, Romano-Greek and Gaulish imagery. Although priests and kings often donned such animal masks so as to manifest the godhead and assume its cultic powers, these masks were also placed on altars, pillars and poles (the so-called 'totempole'), much in the manner that the witch hangs the grand array of the presiding devil upon her forked staff."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The most well-known example in the witch-cult of a mask to mediate one's patron gods is that of the Devil. The Devil is some-times described in folklore as being literally 'two-faced', which is sometimes manifested in the rites as a mask worn by the magister upon the back of his head, an arcane imagining of the twin aspects of the witch god as Lord of the Beasts and Lord of the Green. Such a figure is evocative of the Janus, the two-faced guardian of the doorways, who himself is akin to Janicot and the horned god stand-ing as guard and gate to the castle of wisdom, sharing certain sim-ilarities also with St Peter of the crossed keys149. Esoterically we might understand the god shown with two, three or four faces as representing the various 'faces' or 'guises' that are projected out-wards from the centre of the one power, each reifying a different aspect that is encountered in the turning of time and season. There is a particularly interesting relic wherein the mysteries of the veil and the revealed face meet in one, namely the Veil of St Veronica, who according to medieval legend handed her head cloth to Jesus as he made his way to Calvary. Having wiped the droplets of agony from his brow he handed the cloth back to her, and thereupon it she found the likeness of his countenance. A reference to this legend is found in an old folk magic charm, wherein a haemorrhage is staunched by writing St Veronica's name on the patient's forehead with their own blood whilst reciting a charm150. Furthermore, it is after its ability to speed healing and the similarity of the markings on its blossom to the face upon St Veronica's cloth, that the wayside flower of Veronica chamaedrys (germander speedwell) is so-named. Besides the veil that conceals and the mask that reveals, there are those adornments that grace the neck and decollete. Writing on the importance of the Star of David as it relates to the Sword and Broom, Cochrane writes that the balancing of the opposite yet complimentary centres of the throat, denoting Speech, and the third eye, denoting Sight, is the secret to gaining great power1\". The decolletage is sometimes dressed with a necklace, which in orthodox Wiccan practice is considered essential attire for women. 149. Ibid., p. 430. 150. Froome, Wicked Enchantments, p. 70. 151.

Necklaces may be strung with 'beads' of various materials, such as metals, shells, stones and gems, bone, carved woods, seeds, nuts and fruits such as rowan berries, rosehips and acorns, each serving to draw upon the diverse powers therein contained. The tradi-tional Wiccan necklace is often strung with alternate beads of jet and amber, both being of vegetal origin; golden amber having solar, protective and healing virtues, being sacred to the Son/Sun, whilst black jet is protective, wards nightmares and is sacred to the Black Goddess. In the Museum of Witchcraft (Boscastle), there are a number of witch necklaces from the West Country composed of snake vertebrae strung between red and blue beads, which Cecil Williamson says calls upon the spirit and power of the snake in spell making, along with the powers of blood and air respectively, thereby \"conferring upon the witch a degree of magical spiritual power\". Others suggest the snake's vertebrae evoke the serpent as magical force, wisdom and transformation, in particular the verte-brae recall the descent and ascent of the serpent along the spinal-axis as a simulacrum of the first tree. Some assert that regardless of what is being strung on the neck-lace's thread they must be present in numbers sacred to the god-dess, such as multiples of nine or thirteen153, thereby evoking her cycles of life, death and rebirth. Within the witch cult there is a be-lief that this necklace is a remembrance of the noose worn about the neck and thus evocative of the mysteries of the Fate Goddess and of sacrifice; this is more properly dealt with when we discuss the garter and girdle. We might also envisage it as being akin to the witch circle, whose boundary is demarked by cord and stone, indeed amongst papers alleged to originate with Cochrane is a drawing of a witch rite entitled 'The Necklace', which is described as being one of the 'five rings of witchcraft'. 152.

Such magical suspensions some-times have lockets hanging upon them, within which spirits, charms or powders are contained. These are based upon the occult principles of suspension and alligation, Agrippa describing an 'al-ligation' as the principle of a thing impressing its virtue upon us when brought into contact with the body, and a 'suspension' as something wrapped up and hung about the neck by thread, all in-dividual components being allied to its ultimate purpose155. Of the Hand and its Adornments he practical and numinous import of the hands is a subject far too vast to broach here, and so this discussion shall confine itself only to the nature of the hand as it relates to adornments. Through the hands we are able to 'feel' the world and receive subtle impressions and it is to preserve this sense of touch and to protect the hands from those elements that would destroy them that man covers them. One particularly germane example of this is the glove of the blacksmith, which allows him to work with the fire whilst protecting his hands from its destructive aspect. Gloves are also worn by kings, priests and some magicians not just for protection but also as a symbol of purity, that is to say as a veil upon the fleshly hand, a practice which finds certain cor-respondence with the white gloves of the modern Freemason. Besides having an 'insulating' virtue, we encounter the glove in folk tradition as that proffered to another as a sign of kinship and faith, evoking the 'giving' of one's hand to another, and conversely in the throwing down of the gauntlet as a sign of challenge. Gloves, containing a link with their wearer, are also of use in 'image magic', such having been worked by the witches of Belvoir, who stole the glove of Lord Ross and dipped it in boiling water, stroked it upon the fur or their feline familiar Rutterkin and then pricked it whilst muttering incantations so as to procure his death.

Accordingly does the glove and the hand it In like the scabbard sheathing the sword, become symbolic of tin-generative organs157 and the feminine mysteries connected with the tides of creation and destruction158. In this manner are hands a vehicle of 'action' through which things may be shaped, moulded and crafted into being or broken apart in accordance with the design seen in the 'minds eye', that is to say they are directed by head and heart. It is in agreement with this that the creative and destructive agencies are housed in the vessels of the right and left hands. The ascription of the five fingers to the points of the pentagram, and in turn to elemental powers and senses, is one explored by a number of occultists, although most notable in relation to this work are those made by Austin Osman Spare and Andrew Chumbley in his Azoetia. These examples aside, the hand and its parts may be divided up and ascribed to various powers, such finding practical manifestation within palmistry, the Hand of Mysteries (which is also found in the Coven of Atho), the ascription of trees to parts of the hands by Graves159 and the language of the hands espoused by Cochrane, who declared that \"each finger on the hands of a witch has a defined meaning and purpose\"160. Regarding the subject of adornment, this alignment of powers to fingers is made particular use of in the art of magical rings. Agrippa tells us that such rings when made in a certain manner are able to impress great virtue on man, the method he gives being to 156. Glass, Justine, Witchcraft: The Sixth Sense. 157.

This of course is to be accompanied by other considerations, namely the making of signs, sigils and images upon the ring, the making of suffumigations and so forth. In this manner seven plan-etary rings might be wrought to gain power over the seven arms of fate, which is to make mention of those bands spoken of in Philostratus Jarchus and the divers other rings as mentioned in the grimoires, this being the main topic of the Black Pullet. One particular ring stands out above all others in the grimoire tradition, this being the Ring of Solomon, which legend attests was once owned by King Solomon himself, having been revealed to him by the 'Most High and Sovereign Creator\"162. This ring gave the power not only to speak to beasts and command spirits but also protected the conjurer when held before his face. This apotropaic virtue is encountered in those iron bands worn to drive away spirits and also in the simple early English rings that were fashioned of twisted wire so as to form an endless spiralling knot and thereby distract the attention of the 'evil eye'; from the 7th century onwards these were often hung about the neck as a suspension163. Solomon's Ring however is far more complex in structure, described by Ara-bic writers as being fashioned of brass and iron, on which were in-scribed his commands to the good and evil genii respectively, and upon it were set four jewels gifted by four angels, giving him com-mand over the four elements, and in the midst of these was embla-zoned the name of god. This enchanted ring is the prototype of that wrought and used by the many conjurers who work within the tradition of the Solomonic grimoires. However, different authorities have differ-ing opinions as to the exact design inscribed upon the ring; many declare it as having a six-pointed star, evoking the alchemical mar-riage of fire and water, whilst others portray it with a pentagram, such featuring also on the Pythagorean signet ring164.

Being testimony to the authority of its bearer and a symbol of power, such rings often form part of the regalia passed on through rites of kingly and priestly succession, with submittal to this divine authority being signified through the kissing of the ring by subservient parties. The magician's ring engraved with words of power about its circumference, like the runic rings of Norse sorcerers, are evocative of the enchanted ring cast about the witch, its horizon bound by word, sign and sigil. It is in light of this that the sorcerous ring comes to partake of similar virtues to the magical circle, particularly those of enclosing, binding and focusing, further enciphering qual-ities of perfection, attainment and, being without beginning or end, eternity. Likewise does the magician's finger, as a baton directing power, become analogous to the axis mundi at the centre of the en-chanted circle, that is to say the ring worn on the finger binds and concentrates power within it. Although the ring is most often worn on the index or 'venomous' pointing finger, it may be worn on different fingers depending upon whose patronage the work at hand is under: • Forefinger (Index Finger) — Ruled by Jupiter and the Oak, this finger is held to denote the Holy Ghost or Divine Spirit and accordingly did priests once wear rings on this finger as a sign of their office, likewise is a band worn on this 'wilful' finger said to indicate boldness of spirit166. • Fool's Finger (Middle Finger) — Ruled by Saturn and the Holly, this baleful finger rarely bares a ring, although Graves says when worn on this finger it naturally expresses a hope of resurrec-tion167. It is also known as the digitus impudicus after its use as an aggressive sexual insult, its form suggestive of the upright phallus, 165. Such signet rings were also once used to make one's sign upon wax so as to seal a document, and magically might be considered as transference of virtue. 166.

It is known as 'the ring finger' for it is upon this digit that the solar golden wedding band is popularly worn, sometimes by religious persons to denote 'marriage' to their patron god(s)171. • Auricular Finger (Little Finger) — Ruled by the psychpomp Mercury and Apple, this finger is said by Graves to be divinatory and almost necromantic in nature, for when it is used to stopper the ear as an aid to inspiration it gives rise to mysterious whispers within which secrets might be discerned. A ring worn on this fin-ger is said to denote a masterful spirit172. • Thumb — Ruled by Venus and Hawthorn, the Romans and Greeks wore their iron seal-rings upon this finger as a charm to preserve virility; the thumb evoking the phallus and the iron ring denoting the smith-god Vulcan, husband of Venus173. In images of the Hand of the Mysteries the thumb is depicted as being crowned, denoting the dominance of the will over the four elements, that is to say the one thumb over the four fingers, as expressed in the say-ing 'under the thumb'.

Rings may also indicate oaths of a more magical nature, including those that bind man to his gods. Rings can also be used as vessels into which spirits might be bound, such having especial use in the wedding of the sorcerer to his famulus. Familiars were often carried in rings during the ancient and medieval periods174, a technique outlined in grimoires and known to many witches175. Although some scholars wrote of demons bound in vessels, it was noted by Thomas Heywood that the familiar spirit given to attend every magician and witch is generally \"confined so of their own free-will and voluntary motion\"176, and it is a precept of the Pauline Art that the guiding spirit would in time reveal a design to the sorcerer, which was then to be set upon a ring to aid congress. Being worn upon the hand the ring becomes a point of mediation and communication betwixt corporeal man and that which is disembodied, thereby enabling the sorcerer to call upon his spirit ally at all times, yet some scholars hold that should the ring become sold, exchanged or lost, the familiar is lost with it. Likewise, if the ring meets with accidental damage or purposeful destruction, the spirit will be released. Some of those whom were accused of having such conference with spirits had their rings destroyed as punishment, like Johannes Jodocus Rosa, whose ring was placed on an anvil and beaten with an iron hammer177. With these famulus-rings the possessor was able to seek advice, discover news from far afield, learn of cures and remedies, gain secret knowledge, obtain magical aid and wreak retribution. The revelation of hidden knowledge was often obtained through scrying, especially where the ring was set with a garnet of crystal, quartz or obsidian, the indwelling daemon being thought to reveal the images in the reflective surface178. Others, however, drew secret 174. Tyson, Donald. Familiar Spirits: A Practical Guide for Witches and Magicians. 175. Froome, Wicked Enchantments, p. 55. 176. Rev.

Alternatively, knowledge from the mighty dead might be sought by virtue of a ring fashioned of bone, connecting one with their spiritual ancestors who might act as intercessors between this world and the other. This type of osseous adornment is not just of use within the necromantic arts but also in those of protection, the gaining of moral strength, fearlessness and peace of mind, all of which are won by accepting and learning to live with the living dead180. Metal and bone aside, different materials might be used to make the ring, thereby enabling us to call upon their powers. There is a whole body of lore associated with the making of adorn-ments from plant matter, for like the verdant garland we might also fashion rings, bracelets and necklaces by intertwining herbs and pliable branches in the manner of the child's daisy chain. Rings of wood, bark and other green matter can likewise be carved, woven or plaited for various ends, including the making of a binding oath unto one's plant famulus. Similarly does jewellery of leather, hide and sinew evoke bestial virtue, aiding in those works under the patronage of the Lord of Beasts, especially that of'shape-changing'. One particularly notable example of the magical bestial ring is that containing the toadstone or toadbone, which once ob-tained and set in a ring is capable of conferring a great number of magical powers lSl. These plant and animal rings are bound by virtue of the knot, which unites one end of the herbaceous or hide thong with the other, evoking the image of the sorcerous ouroboric ring. The knot works the principle of 'binding' magic, the powers being 'tied' into the ring, and it is notable that both knot and ring alike are symbolic of the oath and pledge, as articulated in the expression 'tying the knot'.

So famed are the many properties of rings that they passed into myth and legend as being able to confer immortality, grant wishes and bestow great magical powers, the gifting of enchanted rings also bewitching others or causing them to fall in love with the sorcerer. All of these draw upon the virtue of the ring's circular eternal form, the manifold materials of which they are made, its power to bind, wed and bewitch and their placement upon the finger that points, projects and conducts the powers. Hands might also be adorned by means of bracelets, with wide wristlets of venereal copper or lunar silver being a fairly common adornment in the modern witch's ceremonial dress. Writing of the Coven of Atho, Valiente relates that besides a sword, horn and black cloak 'for secrecy', the coven's regalia included a silver bracelet to be worn by the 'Witch Maiden'; Mary Cardell's being engraved with the name of their witch goddess, 'Andraste'183. However, Paul Huson asserts that the bracelet is in fact worn by both sexes and should feature the secret name of the witch and an emblem representing their coven184. Such bracelets share the 'encircling' and 'binding' virtues of rings, and in this respect are rather evocative of the use of iron cuffs, the binding of hands in initiatory rites, the practice of hand-fasting and the enchaining 'cuffs' worn by bishops as a symbol of their bond to god. The art of making bracelets is biblically considered to have been taught to mankind by Azazel, along with the working of metals and the use of jewellery to fascinate185, although the occultist Franz Bardon says that the spirit Canali (26° Libra) \"has been since the days of yore the initiator into jewellery of any kind...the magician may also learn of many interesting things from Canali in this respect\"186. Other than those of metal, bracelets sometimes take the form of woven thread, and in this we are reminded of the use of cord to 182. Glass, Witchcraft: The Sixth Sense. 183.

When coiled about the bough-like arm the cord is somewhat reminiscent of the serpent, and this binding is particularly advantageous in facilitating the flow of power through the arms, hands, legs and feet. Besides the plain woven band, bracelets are sometimes made by stringing beads of stone, crystal, wood or herbal matter upon a thread of plant or animal origin, exemplified in both the charm of rowan berries strung on apotropaic red thread and the devotional rosary. Although an intrinsic sacramental of Catholicism, rosaries are used by many other faiths beside in the recital of prayers, thereby freeing the mind from keeping count and enabling it to focus on the mysteries themselves189. The rosary is traditionally strung with dried rosehips and carved rose-wood, evoking the mys-tic rose as the still hub at the heart of the world, signifying the im-mortal soul that manifests itself in the eternally-changing and ever-renewing material world that spins about it. The name 'rosary' derives from the Latin for 'rose garden' (rosarium), evoking the sacred enclosure, and like the encircling ring, bracelet, crown and girdle, it is considered a fetish of the circle cast about witch, magician and sorcerer alike. Within Christian tradition the round of beads strung about the rosary relate to a meditation upon the mysteries of the life of the light-bearing Christ, thereby evoking the trials and obstacles on his journey from birth to death to resurrection. It is of course the ordeals and ad-versities that we face, the so-called 'trials of fate', that give rise to the reward of the spirit. In the witch cult, the beads strung upon the red thread similarly become aligned with the footsteps taken by the 'wanderer' as he makes his way about the circle of eternity, treading throughout all lands and seasons, each bead passed through the fingers becoming a fateful step on the journey about the encircling boundary of the horizon, the very edge of the world. The encircling or perambulation of a plot has much to do with staking a claim over it. It is to define the borders of the land over which one is ruler, exemplified in the kingly royal tour and the old 188. Stewart, RJ. The Spirit Cord. 189. For more on the the rosary see Wilkins, The Rose-Garden Game."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"rite of beating the bounds wherein the procession re-affirms the boundary and lays claim over the parcel of land therein enclosed. Such a survey of one's land also gives great knowledge of it, for in coming to view the terrain from many vantage points and through many seasons, different facets of the one plot are revealed. Like-wise, whilst passing through the beads in contemplation and prayer, the ancient secrets encrypted in the cipher of the rosary are revealed in gnosis; herein the encircling witch dance and the count-ing of the beads are revealed as syncretic paths to transcendental awareness, giving rise to epiphany and the transmission of secret wisdom. Accordingly should the sorcerer construct his rosary carefully, the materials of the beads, their size, shape, number and arrangement all conspiring to evoke the Work and the Mysteries as understood by its maker190. Many are the materials from which the rosary might be constructed, including glass, precious stone, fossil, bone, antler, horn and wood, each having especial significance to the sorcerer and their work. Beads may also be made as vessels so as to enclose sacramental relics, waters, ashes and smokes. These differing beads might be arranged in many manners, but in considering the alignment of the rosarium fetish and the Circle of Art, it behooves us to fashion one after the manner of the Hallowed Acre, so that as we pass the beads through our fingers we encounter the many patron deities in their proper station, the whole united at the point of Midnight where beads or fetish-pendants redolent of the Lord and Lady should be bound. The Binding Girdle The most common adornment to be worn about the waist is the belt or girdle, its practical function being to bind shut the cloak of secrecy and night. Within magical traditions this often takes the form of a cord, such being symbolic of the in-dividual's thread of fate, woven by the Three Weavers. This thread, representing one's own personal journey, becomes braided with the personal threads of others, fate woven with fate, many strands from many times and many places all interweaving to fashion 190. Schulke, Viridarium Umbris."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the One Cord that describes the border of the One Great Circle, thereby do all things become entwined as One. As a representative of man's journey through life, such a cingillum (Latin for girdle) is given to the modern Wiccan at the time of their initiation, its colour denoting their rank and grade in the coven, and thereby their current station on the circle that constitutes their journey. This degree system has been borrowed by some other traditions of witchcraft, and herein coloured cords are likewise used to denote the progress of the initiate, generally using the colours of the three aspects of the Witch Goddess, these being white, red and black191. In other traditions just one cord is used, woven of three strands in recognition of the three weavers, and although sometimes braided of three colours, more generally it is only red in colour, representing the golden essence of one's life blood and the serpentine power carried therein. The cord may be ritually 'reddened' by the dipping of a white cord into a vat of scarlet vegetal dye to which has been added a few drops of one's own blood, evoking the scarlet path from sacrum to cranium. In those whose traditions are influenced by the Solomonic grimoires the cingillum is often nine feet in length. This enables the cord to be used to fashion the Circle of Art, with one end being fastened to a sickle, which is driven into what shall be the centre of the circle, and the other attached to the knife, which is used to draw the circle's circumference191. Such a working tool is rather redolent of the Mason's skirret, by which the foundations of the intended structure might be marked out. Although some assert it should be nine feet long, the length of the girdle does vary from tradition to tradition. In some covens the girdle is made so that its length is equal to the height of the individual wearing it, so becom-ing a 'measure of the man'. In the making of the circle we discover how the girdle is akin to the cord of birth, an umbilicus connecting the central hub to the circumference, the circle being the expression of the point, just as the child is of the mother. In this we might draw a parallel between 191. Gwyn, Light from the Shadows, p. 67. 192. The Key of Solomon the King, Book 2, Chapter 9. Certain grimoires specify the girdle be made of the skin of a black cat, such as Conjuration For Magitians and the More Learned Sort of Conjurors (1665)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"the symbolism of the cord and that of the compasses in Freema-sonry, both partaking of the nature of the 'path' uniting one thing with another, in this case the cause with its manifest expression, one being still and unmoving and the other cyclical. The path works to unite point with point, heights with depths and the un-manifest source with the manifest realm. It is the bridge between the journey's origin and its culmination, and by working the path of return the umbilical-cord becomes a means of joining the witch with their primal ancestor. Such a philosophy is represented in the two ends of the cinc-ture, one end symbolising life and the other death. Notably, whilst some wear cingillums with two knotted ends, others tie a knot at one and a noose at the other. The tasselled knot is analogous with the bull's tail and an expression of the witch god, whilst the noose is a symbol of death, evoking the halter or garrotte used to despatch sacrificial victims to the gods, and more esoterically the things we sacrifice in pursuit of the faith. In recollection of the garrotte, some witches wear the cord not just about the waist but also around the neck, this 'necklace' being a remembrance of divine sacrifice and ritual 'death'. Whether worn about the waist or neck the knotted end is passed through the noose, just as the tail of the ouroboric serpent is swallowed by its own gaping mouth. Hereby are the two made as one, reminding us that growth and decay are but ex-pressions of the one eternal and cyclic process, the knot of unity being the underlying condition. An extension of the girdle's ability to unite is its capacity to provoke love and its relationship with sexuality. It is this aspect that we encounter in the girdle of purity and chasteness worn by Artemis, the love-inspiring girdle of Aphrodite and the girdle of fertility worn by the Assyrian and Babylonian goddess Ishtar, which renders the land barren when removed. Further correlating the belt with fertility, Graves, likens the woman's girdle (the Greek zone) to an orgiastic round dance about a circle of oaks in honour of the goddess, the loosening of the girdle being representative of the disrobing of a woman, and therefore sex and marriage193."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"As a symbol of the Circle of the Horizon, the encompassing cord is sometimes knotted, these knots being akin to the beads upon the rosary, indeed, Cochrane informs us that such a knotted cord might be used as a meditational device194. Each of these knots are as though stations on the great round of life, met with in turn as we feel our way along the guiding thread195, and various authorities give differing numbers of knots to be tied within, depending upon the tradition being worked. Some give 9 (or less often 13) for 'the moon', Cochrane expands on this and says that these 9 knots consist of five for the pentad, three for the Fates who oversee this round of life and the knot tying the noose for Hecate as Goddess of life and death196. Others say 7, which of course evokes the alchemical marriage of the three-fold Goddess and four-fold God, combining spirit with matter to give rise to the Child whose one body combines the inheritance of both. However, it will be noted that even with a cord fashioned of 9 knots, one securing the tail and the other the noose, there are indeed seven centres of power along its serpentine length. In ceremonial magic the seven powers are sometimes represented in the sash of seven colours, which is wrapped thrice about the magician's waist and tied with a single knot. Some suggest that each of the knots made thereon should 'tie in' a significant memory on one's path197, this being somewhat akin to the practice of tying a ribbon about a finger to recall a memory, the cord becoming the fateful thread of time that leads us from memory to memory and instant-to-instant in an ever-turning circle. The making of ritual ligatures so as to bind oath, desire, power, numinous virtue and so forth into a material vehicle is alluded to by Christ, who says \"whateveryou knot fast on earth will be corre-spondingly fastened together in the world beyond\"198. Like the rosary, the knots of the cingillum are passed through the fingers as the many repetitions of the charm are made, each knot a beat of our heart on the journey through the round of Fate, and as it is turned 194. The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 35. 195. In this we are reminded of the journey of Theseus through the dark labyrinth by virtue of Ariadne's guiding thread. 196. The Robert Cochrane Letters, p. 141. 197. Jones, Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed. 198. Matthew 16:19."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"the ring of time turns with it, whether counted backwards to un-ravel the worlds and effect a great return to the primal initiatrix, or forwards to bring the dream into manifestation. In similitude to the focussing and protecting virtues of the circle, the cincture tied about the waist likewise works to protect the sorcerer and concentrate power within them; they literally be-come 'girdled with power'199. Herein does the navel-centre in the midst of man's body become aligned with the 'hot point' of the rite; the waist becomes the mirror reflecting the powers residing in the great circle above, exemplified in the necklace and crown, and the great circle below, exemplified in the garter worn upon the legs. Many powers can thus be bound about and focussed within the witch's body depending upon the materials and fetishes plaited into the girdle, which may be of animal or plant origin, such as the snakeskin or leather garters worn by male witches200 or the bindweed that is considered in folklore to be the Devil's very own garter. In occult thought various virtues are thereby said to be passed to the magician, as exemplified by the leather belts which were thought to lend various bestial powers, such as those of strength and dominance201. One particular magical practice related to this is that of shape-changing, wherein the girdle encircles the sorcerer with its in-dwelling powers and virtues, much like an enshrouding cloak of plant matter or hide. On this subject, Nigel Jackson relates the use of a warlock's belt fashioned of wolf-skin and inscribed with runes in order to allow its wearer to become enveloped with the entire form and skin of the beast202. In his pamphlet A True Discourse, outlining the murders of Stubbe Peeter, \"a most wicked sorcerer who in the likeness of a wolf committed many murders\", George Bores relates that it was by agency of such a girdle, gifted by the Devil, that the sorcerer was able to commit his crimes. He writes how when Stubbe Peeter put it about his waist he turned into \"the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes 199. We are here reminded of the mythological power-rendering girdles, such as the Megingardir worn by Thor, which doubled his strength. 200. Huson, Mastering Witchcraft. 201. Bardon, The Practice of Magical Evocation. 202. Jackson, The Compleat Vampyre."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"great and large, which in turn sparkled like unto brands of fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body and mighty paws\"203. So it is then that the fiery blood-red cord fastened about the waist becomes a symbol of the deadly but wise serpent, encircling the witch with wisdom and power, such being aligned with the ring of time and the river that bounds the world's horizon204. The Shod Foot of the Wayfarer Having considered all those parts above the waist, we come fi-nally to the legs and feet. Being planted on terra firma, many occultists relate the lower body to earth as the grossest element, and because like the arms they are directed by the heart and head, many consider them to be 'lesser'. However, it is in the four limbs that we find analogue with the four roads that lead us to the castles of our patron gods, they constitute the elemental cross upon which the spirit hangs, and this is sometimes represented by the four-square castle or pyramid with its centre/apex. Moreover, just as the hands express the design of heart and head through craft, so too do the feet carry us forth along the path of our desire, they are the force of motion; they are paths of mediation between the inner and outer. Without these limbs of reification our dreams would remain just that, no idol would ever be forged and no path would be trodden, we would never progress, rather we would stagnate on a single point. The feet then are the means by which we tread the many paths emanating from the point and the vehicle by which we tra-verse the horizon of the circle, each being a type of pilgrimage whose way is shown by the light of the heart. It is only by eternally wandering through many lands that we come to know the many mysteries, the eternal wanderer with no fixed home being person-ified in the exilic figure of Cain, ancestor of the witches205. 203. Froome, Wicked Enchantments, pp. 163-4. 204. Interestingly, the girdle about the middle of the Jewish priests is likewise said to represent the oceans that surround the earth, as represented by the linen robe (Se-cret Teachings of All Ages, p. 435). 205. For more on the nature of pilgrimage, see 'Way and Waymark' by Daniel Schulke, The Cauldron no. 122, November 2006."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"When treading sacred space the feet are often kept bare, such expressing a sense of humility and respect, for shoes lift man from the earth, implying a sense of not just separation but also superiority. It is notable that Moses was instructed to remove his shoes when approaching the burning bush, \"put off the shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\"206. Removing one's shoes is also symbolic of a return to the original state of man, being a shedding of those mundane things accumulated in his material existence. However, bare-feet are also more sensitive, and being a medium insulating the foot from the ground, shoes can have a protective function, as exemplified in the placing of apotropaic iron or herbal charms within shoes and by the concealment of shoes in buildings. It is also the feet that tread out the pattern of the mysteries, bringing the celestial virtues to earth and grounding them in the manifest world. Accordingly do those influenced by the Solomonic grimoires wear white leather shoes marked with the signs and char-acters of their work, thereby impressing the correlating powers within the sacred precinct of the rite as they work their way about the circle207. Intriguingly, when speaking of the empowerment of the ring, Cochrane informs us that the power drawn through the right shoulder spirals through the body and is emitted through the left foot, and this in turn is drawn back up through the right foot to the base of the spine so as to awaken the serpent power, which properly stimulated ascends to the seat of the head; herein is en-crypted something of the channelling of divine force and the twain paths of descent and return208. In this we are reminded also of the manner in which the earth sustains man, and vice-versa, and \"by way of this ongoing alliance between sorcerer and land, a contin-uum of gnosis is achieved which nurtures the present stream of lore, revealing it anew, whilst remaining true unto the blessed tra-ditions of the past...The Faith beneath the Wanderer's Heels\"209. In en-coiling a cord along the limbs after the manner of the serpent 206. Exodus 3:5. Compare also to Acts 7:3 and Joshua 5:15. 207. The Key of Solomon the King.

Schulke, 'Way and Waymark'."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"such a rite can be greatly aided, the spiral binding upon the leg being somewhat related to the garter, which like the necklace, cord, ring and bracelet, partakes of the virtues of ligature and binding210. Within orthodox Wicca a garter is worn as a part of the witch's regalia, some positing a relationship with the girdles worn by Aphrodite and various other goddesses. Such is not completely alien to historical witchcraft, one French writer in 1892 comment-ing that \"the bad people [witches] form a brotherhood, which is di-rected by a female witch...this woman wears a garter as a mark of her dignity\"211. Huson relates that the garter should always be worn above the left knee during the witch rites, and further proposes that when adorned with bells are reminiscent of those worn by English Morris dancers212, such bells being held by some to repel evil spirits. However, the garter worn at the knee has been the subject of much, generally baseless, speculation by some modern Freemasons, Rosicrucians and writers on the witch cult, especially those who, influenced by Margaret Murray, have sought to forge a link with the Order of the Garter. Instructions for the making of a magic garter are found within the pages of the Key of Solomon, a tube formed of stag hide being packed with mugwort and stained with magical glyphs using the blood of a hare213. In the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight it is encountered as a protective amulet, having a symbolic reading that at once deals with both the spiritual and the sexual, which is unsurprising considering its relative proximity to the genitals. Ac-cordingly does the garter feature in sex and fertility folk magic, being a means to help induce dreams of one's future beloved, whilst in superstition the bride's garter brings good luck to the one who secures it after marriage, this being the precursor of the modern bouquet-catching custom. One old fertility charm involved a virgin girl going to a field in secret, taking a wheat straw for every son she hoped for and an oat straw for every daughter, these being plaited into her garter whilst reciting a charm evoking the baby 210. Intriguingly, Idries Shah notes that the Arabic word for garter is the same as that for the Sufi mystical tie or bond (Shah, The Sufis). 211. Lemoine, Jules. La Tradition, 1892. 212.

Akin to these are those charms tied to the thighs and worn like garters, such as the so-called 'pregnant-stone' or 'eaglestone'215, which when bound to the thigh by use of animal hide stemmed labour pains and made for an easy birth, whilst tied to the arm prevented miscarriage and brought popularity and victory. In the realms of folk cures, a red garter was considered to alleviate rheumatism, whilst those of corks or eel-skin could avert cramps. In another instance, calling to mind the various stroking cures of rural charmers, one Yorkshire witch cured a man of ear pains by taking off her garter and crossing his left ear with it three times216. The 'garter' is also mentioned in some papers allegedly originating with Cochrane as a name for the witch's magic circle. In these the garter is identified with the 'Ladder of Devotion, that is to say the cord as a rosary-like meditational device that is tied on 'the knot of death', recalling the 'garter worn at the neck' as the noose of subjugation. In this we might consider the various ligatures to be connected, with the garter worn at the head, waist and leg evoking the three worlds and their sacred centres, the circles above and below united in that bound about the navel-centre. 214.

Similarly, on his journey does man comes to take on many more adornments that can either shackle or free him, some working to clothe the witch in pneuma and power, and others merely burdening him like the allegorical beast. In 'wearing' symbols of the very powers we seek to mediate, we are able to read the many secrets therein encrypted, the colours, forms and uses of the adornments becoming a veritable cipher of the mysteries. In its apotheosis the witch as wayfarer becomes crowned at head by the stellar crown and shod at foot by the iron shoe217, the powers of the heights and the depths being girdled with power at the centre. Similarly is the witches' forked stave, as the altar-like fetish-idol of the wanderer's patron, crowned and shod; the mommet of the exilic nomad, dressed in mask and robe, steadying the walker's step as he traverses the precincts of the horizon. Yet ultimately, whatever robes or adornments we choose to hang upon our bodily frame, these must eventually be cast aside, the woven gossamer threads falling back into the cauldron from whence they came, just as Mary's winding sheet unravelled upon her ascension to the heavenly realm. Naked as we came into the world, it is ultimately 'Naked' that we must return. 217.
