It is wrought by the skillful artifice of its own craft. It is a child born from the Living Truth of the Art Magical and is therefore by nature destined to pursue its own wayward fate. The Body of this Grammar, the flesh of this child, is composed by vertu of present sorcerous invention, vivified by the life-blood of its ancestry and open to the possibilities of its own future transformation. The substance of this book is here transcribed from oral, textual, and ritual transmissions of knowledge, derived from the Traditions of Sabbatic Craft and the Cunning Man's Arte from throughout the Isle of Albion and beyond. Many other influences are to be seen within these pages, all of which bear testi-mony to the manifold powers which have focused themselves within the Earthly Circle of Our Witanic Magistry. For this book is here made manifest as a working enchiridion of devotional magick through the present-day activities of the Cultus Sabbati, the body of wise-folk self-known as the Curren, and the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"noble host of its outlying sodality, the Companie of the Serpent-Gross. In terms of content, this book contains a collection of diverse prayers, conjurations and accompanying formulae, all bearing the Noble Masque and Myste-rium of Cain, first sorcerer and atavistic patron of the Curren. All such components are drawn from the present observance of these mysteries and have been collated in this single volume from, and for, the continuing benefit of both individual and congrega-tional forms of practise. In this respect it is intended that this book may serve as a repository for the lore of Our Arte: a treasure-house for the Serpent's hoard, an ossuary for the burning bone-seed of Cain. Herein a timely harvest is gathered for all who are of the Wiseblood, that it may provide bread for those who hunger and that in the fullness of time its chosen grain may be rightly sown anew. The Arcana of the Psalter of Cain are unified in spirit, yet manifold in their expression through many and varied outward forms of Belief. For the mysteries here-in are shown forth in the manner of dual-faith observance; that is to say - the combined elements drawn from more than one system of religious belief. The diversity of outer forms is unified through the harmonics of syncretic alignment and is focused within the single context of the sorcerous domain: the ritual arena of circle-heart and hearth. Whosoever studies this book shall find that its contents show the influences of many traditions of magical and religious practise from around the world. Such influences have been sought out and brought to bear upon practitioners of the Cunning Man's Arte through physical and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"psychic interaction with the spirits and practitioners of divers paths and disciples. This interaction has taken diverse forms and knowledge has been transmitted in many different ways. The spirits have shown themselves in manifold masks: face-to-face in flesh and in dream, in the study of literature, through the acquirement of talismanic and ceremonially empowered objects, through word-of-mouth and word-of-writ. All such passing-on has been augmented within the circle and has been integrated through direct ritual and oneiric contact with the forces of initiation. The Spiritual Powers which have motivated the evolution of Our Sorcerous Tradition are accorded due honour in all deeds which bear out the words of this book. Inasmuch as Oath and Pact permit, the Prayers of the Psalter laud and exalt the Great Host of Gods and Spirits - naming the Com-panie of many who have entered the procession of the Ever-turning Way. In the placeless place the Crooked Path deviates through and between all disguising of Pure Belief; where its tortuous, ever-shifting nature touches a form of Belief it magnetizes the integral force there-of and aligns it to the Way of the Sorcerer. It sacrifices all and aught upon the mystical point of the circle's centre, creating the crossroads of possibilities: the chosen moment for the incarnation of the Magical Quintes-sence. In timeless time the Crooked Path deviates through and between the many seasons of heaven and earth. The appointed instant is the continual presence of Now. Within this book the diversity of expression amid exactitude of intent is indicative of the unique ethos"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"- the transgressive sacrality implicit in the sorcerer of the Crooked Path. To realize this one must endeavour to step upon the Way, to walk within the phalanx of spirits, to wander amidst the masked procession of the night. The manifold syncretism of outer forms of belief is dissolved and re-solved in the alembic of the mystery's hearth - all shall turn and re-turn to their source. For it is not wholly through combination of outward forms that the integral unity of vision is perceived, although thereby we may begin the process of awakening the inward eye. It is solely through the individual one-pointedness of consciousness - the placing of the sorcerous mind within the all-consuming focus of Pure Belief - that the direct experience of the Magical Quintessence is attained. In the instant of realization all outward forms become the conveyors of vital numen, each unique in nature and each with certain value to the Artist of the Divine. A many-sided tale may be spun from this text; a many-flavoured decoction poured from this Single cup. To some it will be a poisonous truth and to others a salvific lie.
