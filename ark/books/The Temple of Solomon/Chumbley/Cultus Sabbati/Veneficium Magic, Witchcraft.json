Its pages held precise materia magica, first hand descriptions of obscure psychoactive sacraments, records of the magical practice and expansion of the sensorium into realms beyond my previous knowledge. Also present were detailed reports of ritual operations, performed in solitude; with lodges of varying si /.es and magical aims, and also as part of a dyad with a single partner. In some instances I was also allowed access to closed societies as a guest or participant observer, or permitted to record material from informants possessing unique and specialist knowledge. Alongside this pursuit of the Mysticism Botanick, my practical studies of herbalism, folk magic, and agriculture complimented this magical tutelage. A deeper passage into l he endarkened bower of the wildwood became a source of direct understanding: time spent at length in the wilderness served as a clarifying lens for beholding emergent patterning of the work, and as a 'divine emptiness' apart from the 1111 positions of humanity. This vastness was, nonetheless, an Otherworld densely populated with allies, enemies and 1 ricksters, oppressive spirits, voices, storms, telluric powers, (rials, injury, death, revelations and above all the ethereal majesty of the eldritch race of Faerie. It was largely through these solitary encounters that Hypnotikon assumed clarity and purpose, and grew into a living and dynamic form. I lowever, the primary motivation for compiling this work was that it serve as a primary resource for my own spiritual development, a record of learning, its essential nature being private. The thesis of Veneficium, being a small but potent cup"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"drawn from the vernal well of the Hypnotikon, is thus a convergence of perspectives I have had for some time: that of the herbalist and the natural magician in congress with poison. Poison is a glyph for magical power itself: complex, concentrated, liberated in the hands of the elect, and disastrous in the hands of the fool. Its very nature is transmutative, changing all it touches, the maker and breaker of laws, policies, and epidemiological systems. It encompasses what industrialized society conceives as 'drugs', being both the therapeutic agents of medicine, as well as the sanctioned or banned ministers of pleasure and con-sciousness alteration. Poison also embraces the toxin: destroyer and mutilator of flesh, whether weaponized in the arsenal of soldier or farmer, or lurking in the environment: the scorpion's engorged tail or the industrial pollutant silently pervading the water table. All of these venom clades, for good and ill, penetrate magic and sorcery on manifold levels, and imply a spiritual discipline of magical toxicology, which in recent times has been called \"Hie Poison Path'.1 Such a path necessarily implies a confrontation with power, but also its effigies, and how these manifest according to the skill of the practitioner. Strewn with thorns, cobbles, and false diversions, the Poison Path offers its own retinue of spirit-guardians to slay or liberate. Poor judgment, irresponsibility, delusion and ego serve as the great enemies, and in any encounter with poison they must be transmuted or bound long in advance. The intersection of magic, mysticism, and poison has naturally assumed some concretized and limited shapes in our present era, mostly negative. Perhaps the most important of these has, without sufficient self-examination, been called drug culture', presented as a legacy of the I. Pendell, Dale. Pharmako/Poeia, Pharmako/Dynamis, Pharmako/Gnosis. Similar terminology has been present in 19th and 20th century witch cults, namely the term \"The Way of Poison'."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"i ultural revolutions of the 1960s. In the 1990s psychonaut 1 ulture began to publicly redefine itself as 'Entheogenic', stressing ethnology, human-plant congress, art, science, religion, and popular culture. Typical of this exotery is an insufficiently-explored dualism which has haunted the approach of the seeker, that which divides usage of drugs into 'sacred' or 'profane' purposes. At one side of the ideological bifurcation one encounters the hardened arena of the Mystic, devotee, or magician whose approach is one of idealized sacrality in the I .ice of the Gods of Poison. In this stance, of which there are myriad variations, an implicit morality suggests (or preaches) 1l1.it the legitimate use of consciousness-expanding drugs lies in the realm of the spirit. Common to this approach is 1 he idea of mindfulness, purpose, and direction, as well as 1 he usage as adjunctive to non-pharmacological approaches. At the other side, which might be called the arena of the I .ilnrrtine, is the idea that drugs are to be used for pleasure, soc ializing, and the sensorial pursuits of the body. To some <i|>crating within this rubric, the 'spirit approach' is a waste ol prime vintage which otherwise might be enjoyed by the «clehrant, an unnecessary imposition of the mental «• instruct of spirit upon the body. Hoth approaches possess unique teachings, and examples ol the uses and abuses of these stances. The Dionysian quittance, which transects these philosophical zones, reminds ns that the experience common to both is the generation of r« stasy, inducing a state of being 'beyond oneself.' Witchcraft, ever transfigured by the magic of need, makes use of both 'sacred' and 'profane' venefic states without adopting these socially-derived boundaries. 111 consideration of the vast and ancient vaults of power poison encompasses, both 'sacred' and 'profane' positions die ultimately moral or religious ones, and in particularly |Htinted examples, can be considered an unconscious"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"theological debate about the nature of God. Neither approach considers, for example, the use of poison for achieving work or maximizing productivity (as with stimulants or neurohy-pophysial hormones), mental coercion of others (as with the Haitian zambi powder or sodium pentothal), infliction of pain or physical harassment (as with Toxicodendron diver-silobum). To these we may add poison's use for destroying malignancy of the flesh (as with anti-cancer compounds such as vincristine derived from Catharanthus roseus), building immunity, inducing insanity or, indeed, treating it. Outside this limiting rubric also lies the usage of poison as a weapon, either in the arsenals of man or the Armies of Nature. All of these approaches proffer a spiritual dimension which may lead to great insights, wisdom, and evolution of the soul. The alternate, shadow-way is also ever-present. These are what I have called the philosophical poisons or Astral Venom: the energies, entities or states of being which, though not primarily induced chemically, are nonetheless toxic to mind, spirit and body. As an incarnate being, the first poison is often the attempted destruction of the soul, and where this insidious corruption has gained purchase, it may present considerable challenges to any spiritual practice. Thus, a part of the work of the Adept is in realigning or re-forging such psychic artifacts in a shape which serves the practitioner, rather than vampirizes power from the Self. Among the retinue of Astral Posions we may also encounter such spirit-toxins in the black heart of the curse, unrequited love, unexamined motive, and the blight of foisted political ideology. In fact it is a truism that the world, as much as it presents a garden of earthly delights, also presents a concentrated and many-tiered stew of poisons. Unequivocal admonitions are essential to them who seek after the nigrescent grail, affirmed by the seal of the death's head upon the forbidden bottle.

That the Abyssal (l.irden does not suffer foolishness and stupidity is certain: neither should the seeker after these mysteries, especially his own. An essential phial in the sorcerer's medicine-chest is II uis the holism of knowing one's own power and vulnerabilities relative to the retinue of the Gods of Venom. Some readers will also know my work from writings produced through the magical order Cultus Sabbati, whose (H-rpctuation of the archaic Sabbatic Current of witchcraft is, in part, driven by ritual generation of ecstatic states.

Because of this multiplicity of vista, it is my hope that the book serves as a small contribution to the field of the study of both magic and poison.

Yet, for myself as a seeker and practitioner, the unitive concept to which I return is the magical modification of the body to attain a state of otherness, wherein the sensorium becomes perme-able to that which lies beyond. Whether the agency thus used is conceived of as chemical, astral, or some other categoriza-tion, the vigor of this princple lies in its power of opposition. Each of these perspectives serves to expand awareness of the nature of poison and how it functions in the arena of magical power. Certain magical approaches and their bodies of knowledge are thus implied for the practicing sorcerer and magician. In its exaltation, this efflorescence of dark wisdom serves as the antidotum to the toxic malediction of'Original Sin', and the rank flowers of the Garden of Abomination are transmuted. Daniel A.

Poison, like witch, is a word burdened with problematic associations. In vulgar parlance it has come to indicate an agent of destruction, be it of spirit, mind or body, whose inevitable bequests are wounding and death. However, ancient definitions often implied a poison's healing nature as well as its capacity for harm. The Latin veneficium can be interpreted as drug, poison, or magic; the old Greek pharmakon could equally indicate a poison or a cure.2 These paradoxical definitions of toxins, wherein powers of both i I'm urn, or Mistletoe, a plant known for its poisonous as well as its curing powers, nil mutely derives from the ancient Proto Indo-European roots Weis 'to melt away, Hi >w'; .Sanskrit Visam - poison; Avestan Vish - poison."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"destruction and healing are present, suggest a certain lost wisdom in the magical pharmacology of antiquity, and are aligned with the folk-wisdom of the witch. To the sorcerer, poison is the ingress of external power initiating crisis. The fruits of its temporal field are the product not only of dosage, but also such factors as route of administration, strength of the physical vessel, purity of the Deed of Arte, and the favor of the spirits presiding. As with all destabilizing power, the repercussions can create or destroy; liberate or repress, illuminate or obscure. As Alchemical adepts well knew, poison is the point of first beginnings from which all must arise; it is power, both in its raw state, and in all its potentials for transmutation. As Paracelsus noted, it is both omnipresent and absent in Nature. Self-poisoning for the attainment of mystical knowledge, ecstasy, and congress with spirits, we call 'The Poison Path'3. This designation separates the mystical endeavor of Trans-mutation from the vulgar dross of hedonism or criminal activity. Ours, therefore, is an Art of subtle discrimination, of observation and caution. Gnosis of the Poison Path arises not from the first matter of its toxin, nor its mundane so-matic effects, but in its Transmutation via the Art Magical to serve the Path of the Seeker. This Art is thus the holy do-minion of Shiva Vishpan, or Shiva the Poison-drinker, em-blematized imbibing venoms from a conch, and whose blue skin-colour resulted from its ingestion4.

It thus serves as a repository of the practical teachings of farm and countryside, true to its source, despite centuries of contact with urban influences. This peculiarity is not ossified —it is alive and actively engaged by those whose trades are shaped by the land and its laws. Part of this granary of knowledge concerns the immediacy of death in daily life, whether it be the killing of livestock, hunting, the destruction of vermin, or the threat of human death from varied causes. Rural knowledge readily accepted this aspect of its world; from the storehouse of country wisdom comes our great legacy of common plant-names, many of which carry the warnings of their venomous nature. For example, the suffix \"bane\" appears in the common names of numerous botanical poisons such as Cowbane (Cicuta spp.), Wolfsbane (Aconitum spp.), Dogbane (Apocynum spp.), Henbane (.Hyoscyamus spp.), and Baneberry (Actaea spp.).

The wayside herb Stinging Nettle is not commonly considered poison, but those whose bare flesh has been excruciated by manifold stings will know the measure of its ferocity. The ancient ritual practice of urtication, whereby the ascetic devotees of the Christian cultus mortified their flesh with nettles, probably has sorcerous antecedents far more ancient; the histamine shock to the flesh and corresponding endorphin release, in a focused ritual context, can precipitate ecstatic trance. Ceremonial infliction of pain —in this case blistering irritation— finds corollaries in a number of important rites, such as thePe'a, the tattooing rituals of Samoan men, which, among other purposes, create a sympathetic simu-lacrum of the pains of childbirth.

These characteristics, as well as their utilization in diverse kinds of magic, have led to its association with the Devil. Yet, the Man-Root's diablerie notwithstanding, it was also co-identified with Christ in early Christian theology.12 As a young man, part of my spiritual training was in the so-called curanderismo 'green medicine' or Mexican folk-magic of the southern United States, a syncretism of Native American sorcery, Roman Catholicism, and vestiges of European magic, particularly Spanish witchcraft and the grimoric traditions. Though the name for this Art directly invoked curing, its attendant body of lore and magical praxis placed equal emphasis on so-called 'left-hand' spell-craft. By tabu, the practitioners known to me referred to themselves not as brujos (witches), but rather as curanderos, or sometimes charismos, and mysticos. In this respect, my own teacher's self-identification was as a 'white magician' whose sorcerous repertoire included practices to induce death, disease, torment or other harm, as well as healing. Such rites of cursing were considered 'defensive magic', used against 'black magicians': those who exacted them had no compunction calling upon both Christ and the Devil for aid in the same prayer. This dual magical ethos of helping and harming, and the complex mysticism which reconciled their artificial polarities, was called 'The Crooked Path' by Andrew D. Chumbley, who identified it as a pervasive feature of folk magic and sorcery.13 The so-called Powers of the Opposer,M a deific embodiment of transgressive power, is the force of magical catalysis summoned in the moment which allows 12.

A perhaps more germane exemplar lies with the Visionary Nightshades, a particular group of plants sometimes referred to as \"The Hexing Herbs', frequently associated with a variety of milieus of witchcraft. These are plants of temperate and tropical distribution with ancient histories of magical use, and characterized by demoniac visions at shamanic doses. The most important brethren in this clan include Henbane, Belladonna, Thornapple, Mandrake, Angel's Trumpet, and Tobacco, which, when used traditionally, is hallucinogenic.

Weier, a student of Henry Cornelius Agrippa, here advances a purely materialist explanation of the poisoner-witch. Though unquestionably a Man of God, he was ever ready to attribute enchantments and fables of witchcraft to superstition, or an otherwise rational explanation stripped of magical romance. Historians frequently laud him as an early and praiseworthy example of a skeptic counterpoised to the 'witchcraft delusion', but the above position also anticipates the modern discipline of criminology. The position is echoed in the Tractatus de Sortilegiis of 1592 the Italian jurist Paolo Grillandi: With these compositions and poisons they can render men impotent and women averse to congress... all these diseases and deaths and impotence and love philtres produced by these mixtures are not the effect of the ceremonies and observances and abuse of sacraments described above.18 18.

These cladistics, considered in distinction in »orcery, were anticipated by Ibn Wahshiyya al Nabati in Im Hook of Poisons, circa 850 AD: Poison is something which overpowers and destroys that which is called the life force of an animal. When it overcomes this force the functioning of the organs in the body is disturbed. The liver, stomach, and veins cannot function so that the strength of the heart, liver, brain, arteries, daily warmth and sinews cannot be transported through the body as they were previously The quality of this condition-is the property of death, since, in consequence of these things, it corrupts the breath which gives rest to the body. Then the life of the animal is affected without delay. This is the definition of poison.

These definitions stress the corrupting nature of poison, and despite their more rational approaches to the subject, presuppose a contrasting physical homesostasis. To my own experience as a magical practitioner, there is an additional criterion worthy of our consideration. Poison, in its characteristic modality, is marked by its origin beyond, occupying a station exterior to the adept. Whether descending from the Fang of the Viper, the grail-cup of the Beloved, or as an astral parasite swooping from the abyss, poison contains within it an inception of otherness, or power alien to Self, and thus is an embodied metaphysic of the Sabbatic concept of the Opposer. Simply defined, the Formula of Opposition describes magical contact of the adept with that which lies beyond, and the liberation of power thus resulting.19 In its higher mystical forms in Traditional Witchcraft, it is the perfect embodiment of contrary magical principles as trans-mutative power. When conscious and active in the initiate, it has been termed Crooked Path Sorcery, and as an ethos driving magical practice may be found in the most ancient magical texts, up to those of the present day. Returning to the realm of the healer, the Formula of Opposition is also found in certain protocols of pharmacy.

In the arena of rural sorcery, the exorcism may take a more direct route in medicinal magic. Folk magic has long made use of charms against poison, of which several types have been identified. Of note are charms against snakebite, of which one taxonomic category is Snake Bit Christ Spoke, allied in essence and ritual technique to charms for easing the damage caused by burns.21 The number of charms for countering poison and for expelling noxious spirits is vast. The presence of these concepts in exorcism and magical thought once again exposes strata of magical ontology em-phasizing purity and contamination, an essential consid-eration for the adept of the Poison Path. These draw obvious parallels with the arts of medicine. Foundational medical training begins with hygiene, and the best and most effective magical tutelage is no different. Sterile procedure, meant to contain pathogens and avoid cross-contamination, bears many similarities to magical operations, not only of exorcism, but also divination and the magical circle. Relevant too is recognition of one's own potential to infect, and taking re-sponsibility in containing it. In another example, when administering care to a patient, the portions of the body must be bathed in a specific order, in order to preserve the purity of the cleaning vehicula; similarly, magical operations often follow specific sequences of ritual action identifiable across diverse eras and locales. The adept will recognize this is less a reflection of rote adoption, but rather that certain operations have a progression of power which, by their nature, is both cumulative and effective. In currents of magic, ideas of purity and contamination are often imported from religions: Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, and Judaism.

Both the magical and mundane actions of each adept serve to advance the animated essence of the current, and feed it, or elsewise, in the case of parasitic action, degrade it. The moment of induction provides the new initiate with a great many new powers, but also the collective inheritance of the Order's astral legacy, for good or ill. This is why transmutation of these karmas is a paramount magical concern, and the responsibility of every initiate. Pendell concedes that an important part of the work of the Poison Path is in 'undoing the mess left by the bad shamans', whose weapon is the Lie.24 This raises the shade of so-called 'cultural contamination' in magical subculture, the idea that foreign influences behave as corrupting toxins to a closed group. Amid certain rural magical lodges in both Britain and North America, I have encountered varying attitudes about purity and contamination. Most often these relate to a fantasies of 'pure' nationalist or regional magical types, much of which are naked xenophobia. In these situations one must seriously question prevailing attitudes of 'culturally pure* magic where practice and lore have been syncretic for many generations, and influences such as Solomonic conjur-ation, Christian folk charming, Afro-Caribbean, and Native American lore have been locally adopted.

The state of the body being metaphorically'Edenic' further implies a state of receptivity which, like the liaison of First Woman and Serpent, assists the adept of the Poison Path.

Whilst she may not have consummated the sexual act with a fleshly companion, she is certainly aware of her desire to do so, and of the tides of attraction, arousal, and physical compulsion, all of which are potent reservoirs of power. The touch of her own hand will be well known to her, and thus the initiating force of First Agapte arises in the pre-figuration of previous accreta of sensual knowledge and fantasy; the difference in consummation is in the presence of the Other. This body of self-knowledge, a combination of limited experience and vast imagination, is in every wise as important as each connubium which follows.

The Caput mortuum or dead head, being a residuum of the alchemical Work, is especially apropos the study of magical venoms, not only for its status as the excreta of the Grand Operation, but also its iconography of the skull. As with both Nature and the Alchemical Art, all conscious magical operations produce aetheric waste and detritus, and the art of discernment between them is of paramount importance.36 When subjected to the proper 34.

In its bound and aright form, it may manifest as destructive force or blight; in its bound averse form it is a healing salvific - the medicine cup fashioned from the skull of the profane corpse. This recognition of a spectrum of power inherent in filth arises from an underlying ethos, pervasive in some forms of Traditional Witchcraft, emphasizing knowledge of right usage, rather than rejection or acceptance on a purely moral basis. Here, we return to the idea of embodiment as a necessary engine of magic and transmutation. As a feature of Crooked Path sorcery, the initiate is perpetually refining poison into nectar, a process sometimes described by its adherents as 'self-overcoming'.

This necessitates a viewpoint where-in .1 necessary part of fabrication is envisioning an object's architecture as both its alchemical lapis (the desired object) and its caput mortuum (its waste-product) before it congeals as a manifest form.

Applications of the Corporeal Laboratory have long been known to the witch-cult, although the name such magical formulae may take varies with time and place. The power which arises from its furnaces and bellows is chiefly atavistic and draws upon the great reservoir of the pre-incarnate body. Within, the most ancient wellsprings of fleshly power may be tapped by venerative and magical means, and empower the body into a proliferation of forms, each capable of manifold powers and hypostases. This is the so-called 'New Flesh' or Transmutation of the Body from a gross state to the angelic, wherein all possibilities arc manifest through corporeal form, and the latent and vestigial attain radiance. This has historically been expressed in a variety of symbols, namely the beast-masked revelers of the midnight conventicle, and the theriocephalic forms, half human, half beast emergent as spirits by the light of the Circle's fire. The formulae may take on a multitude of extrapolations according to the desire of the witch, but a recurring pattern commands originative, formative and expressive phases. That is, the conjuration of raw atavistic power from the repositories of the flesh, giving it form, and breathing life into it anew even as it is presently embodied. Such techniques are aided by a variety of ecstatic sorcerous pathways, including the mesmeric, nostalgic, hypno-sexual, and routes of the poison path. These formulae may be accomplished by a single practitioner, but the force of the power is multiplied many times over in the Sabbath assembly.

Such a mandate necessitates a rubric whereby progress can be rightly judged and the mere appearance of transmutation separated from the Stone. Here one must heed the sages of old when they chose such words as skillful and subtle to frame the successful approaches to the Art. As Basil Valentine observed: The bee extracts honey from the flower by the art which God has given to her; but when once the honey is visibly perfect, that sweet and fragrant liquid can be prepared in such a way as to become a potent and deadly poison. This is a fact which no one will believe who has not seen experimental proof of it. Despite the wisdom attained in experience, the use of the flesh for executing the operation of Art also presents vulnerabilities associated with subjectivity, namely mis-perception, and the pitfalls of addiction, tolerance, and over-intoxication. That which empowers and transforms the path of the adept must ultimately be held in greater esteem than that which concentrates existing constructs of illusion, delusion and dysfunction. More particular to poison, that Operation which effects a change in quin-tessence such that its power is no longer destructive to the vessel but creative is worthy of advancement to the next stage in the Work. Restriction ceases, motion ensues, and the dynamism of flesh and spirit expands in a reverberatory manner. The question must be asked: has the poison served as Muse or as Master? Has the Laboratory and its vessels become stronger, or more degraded?

From antiquity to medieval times, Artemis-Hecate was strongly identified with the hordes of the dead, who traveled in procession during the Ember Nights, the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany, and who were visible to certain seers.46 Greeks called Hekate triceps or triformis; and she was thought to have three heads: that of a lion, a dog, and a mare; along with three goddessforms— Phoebe (the Moon) in heaven, Diana on Earth, and Proserpine in hell. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, the sorceress Medea invokes \"Thou, three-faced Hecate, who comest conscious of my design, and ye charms and the arts of the enchanters, and thou, too, Earth, that does furnish the enchanters with powerful herbs\", thelhessalian sorceress Erichtho invokes Hecate in Lucan's Pharsalia. As we shall see, the invocation of Hekate emerges as a common feature of the magical arts bf the Thessalian witches, as do a specific retinue of poisonous herbs.

Paul Christian, author of the 1870 occult compendium Historie de la Magie, du Monde Surnaturel et de la Fatalite a travers les Temps et les Peuples, wrote: The origin of witchcraft was very ancient; it began in Thessaly, a country as celebrated for its witches and wizards as for its Vale of Tempe or its Thermopylae. The Thessalian women, who dedicated themselves to the profession of this spurious magic possessed, says Plato, the power to stop the sun in its course, to bring upon the earth the spirits of evil, to raise or calm tempests, to bring the dead back to life or kill the living.50 Anacharsis, in his travels, observed these women working their magic, and noted their use of spells to kill bees and flocks of domestic animals, as well as the children of newly-married couples; particularly interesting was their use of wax fetishes pierced with needles to exterminate people. Public superstition was so great that people who saw themselves modelled in this way believed they 49. Ibid, 560. Weyer goes on to qualify poisoning as being chiefly within the domain of women.

When she pleases, she sweeps away the clouds from the sombre sky; when she pleases, she calls down the snow in summer by a word from her mouth. She is said to possess alone all the evil herbs known to Medea, alone to have brought the fierce dogs of Hekate under subjection. This witch has composed for me chants by which you may deceive all eyes. The powers wielded by these sorceresses were diverse. We are told that Medea blasted crops and fruit, and dried up springs; Horace tells of the enchantress Folia \"who with Thessalian voice enchants the stars and moon and snatches them from the sky.\" Homer reports that Circe, by use of a golden rod and poisons, turned her spouse Picus, into a colored bird. This transmutation of man into beast by means of sorcery was also accomplished by Circe on a grand scale with Ulysses'men. And Lucan, in Pbarsalia 6,line 451: 'Through the charms of the Thessalian witches a love not induced by the Fates has entered into hardened hearts; and stern old men have burned with illicit flames.'As Anacharsis reported, these enchantresses had the powers to 'bring upon the earth the spirits of evil, to raise or calm tempests, to bring the dead back to life or kill the living,' a magical act firmly within the chthonic domains of Hekate. 51. ibid., p. 204. Anarcharsis also noted of these witches that 'their sordid poverty equaled their ignorance.'."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Another reference of interest comes again from Anacharsis, who, having hidden himself nearby, observed their sorcery first hand. The sorceress was spell-casting to retrieve the youth Polyclete, who had spurned his lover Salamis. The place of working was bedecked in laurel-boughs and aromatic plants; some brass plates engraved with unknown letters; tufts of lambs'wool dyed purple; nails from a gibbet, still bearing traces of human flesh; skulls half-eaten by wild beasts; fragments of fingers, noses and ears, torn from corpses; entrails ofvictims stolen from temples; flasks in which was stored the blood of men who had died a violent death; a waxen figure of the goddess Hecate, painted white, black, and red and holding a whip, a lamp and sword intertwined by a serpent; several vases, some full of water from sacred fountains, others of milk and mountain honey.... This squalid description may be exaggerated, but some of its components are familiar to the cult of Hekate, and, in modern times, to the practices of traditional folk magic, charming and witchcraft. Porphyry wrote concerning how images should be consecrated to Hekate; they were to be surrounded with wormwood, and that domestic mice were to be painted, and \"the finest ornaments such as were most pleasing to her, and so many mice as her forms were to be taken; then blood, myrrh, storax, and other things were to be burnt: which things if they were done, she would appear, and answer the worker thereof by dreams.\" Another characteristic feature of the magic of the Thessalian witches was enchantment which relied heavily on the use of herbs, especially those considered to have a wretched, toxic, or baneful nature. In Ovid's The Heroides,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":")a.son's lover Hypsipyle speaks of her rival, the sorceress Medea: By her incantations has she influenced thee; and with her enchanted sickle does she reap the dreadful plants. Virgil relates Circe changing Ulysses' men into pigs and asses by means of her 'potent herbs'. Ovid writes, in The Making Up of the Face, that \"love touch us, and not through the strong herbs cut with the dreadful art of the witch's hand. Trust not the grasses and mixed juices; try not the noxious poison of the lusting mare.\" The reference here is to Hippomanes (unro[xae^) or 'horse-rage'; perhaps the most famous ingredient in aphrodisiac potions among the (i reeks of antiquity. It referred both to \"the sluggish poison that flows from the pudenda of mares in heat\" and to a small piece of flesh the size of a dried fig that clings to the brow of a newborn foal. It was usually incorporated into lood or wine. In The Golden Ass, Apuleius described the sorceress Pamphile in this way: She is a magician of note; and she is believed to be mistress of every sepulchral enchantment. By breathing upon sprigs and pebbles and other trifling objects, she knows how to plunge the entire light of this starry world into the depths of Tartarus and into the Chaos of old. Also curious was the mode of gathering these herbs. Many of the sorceresses gathered their plants by moonlight. The full moon, according to Weyer, infects the herbs gathered \"with its evil froth\". This recalls Phebe, I lekate's lunar aspect. Virgil also remarked that \"flourishing herbs are sought, clipped by moonlight with"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"brazen sickles,\" Weyer argues that this was because it was believed that bronze possessed medicinal powers, and there-fore the witch cut the herbs with brazen sickles rather than iron; however, there are also widespread European beliefs that iron is annoying or poisonous to evil spirits; thus it is possible a sorceress working with such spirits as familiars would necessarily degrade her magic by use of iron. Herbs used by these practitioners of the magics of Hekate were sometimes collectively referred to as the \"Pontic herbs\". Virgil, in his Eclogues, remarked: Moeris herself gave me these herbs and these poisons culled in Pontus; many such things grow in Pontus. I have often seen Moeris become a wolf by their means and hide in the forests, and rouse souls from the depths of the tomb, and move the planted crops from one place to another. Here we not only find a reference to herbs and poisons in the same source, but also (in addition to translocation of crops) two types of magic they give rise to: transformation from human to animal, and the summoning of the dead. These, in addition to Erichtho's love-charm as mentioned by Lucan, are of interest to us in examining what specific herbs the sorceresses of Thessaly may have been using. Pontus was known to harbor many species of toxic plants, some of which resulted in mass-poisonings. An example of this occurred in 400 BC, when a Greek mercenary army returning via Pontus was poisoned by Mainomenon, a Honey whose chief source of pollen and nectar was a toxic Rhododendron species. A large number of the soldiers fell unconscious, and some perished. Two of the poisonous species endemic to the area are Rhododendron luteum and R. ponticum."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"In his examination of the magico-shamanic con-sciousness of medieval Europe, German scholar H.P. Duerr remarks that \"There is the tradition that Circe mixed some sort of'bewitching juices' into the kykeon, which was prepared from grated cheese, flour, honey, and pramnic wine, so that Ulysses' men forgot their homeland and changed into pigs... In the later literature we read on occasion that poppy, mint, rue, and coriander were mixed into the kykeon.. ,\"52 Kykeon is ancient Greek for 'mixture' and was also used for the ceremonial brew adminstered at t he mystery Rites of Eleusis. One favored plant often associated with Circe's brew in the research of magical poisons research is Henbane (Hyoscyamus spp.). A hairy, sticky, odorous biennial or annual plant, it is found in wastelands, rural byways, and sandy areas of Europe and also naturalized in North America. It is rich in tropane alkaloids, including atropine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and cuscohygrine, which entheogenic plant researcher Jonathan Ott has collectively named the 'visionary tropanes'.53 Taken internally, Henbane specifically effects the central nervous system: initially stimulation, soon followed by confusion, stupor, and disturbing visions. This is almost always accompanied by the classic side-effects of the Nightshades: dilation of pupils, a gradual drying of all bodily humors, reduced peristalsis, and vasodilation accompanied by increased blood pressure. Overdose gives rise to central narcotic paralysis, coma, and death. The ancient Greek name Hyoskyamos, from which the plant's botanical nomenclature derives, means 'hog-bean'; it has long been conjectured that the name refers to the (lirce legend of magically transforming men into hogs.

Despite the debate about the origins of the name, Hansen's position with regard to Henbane as used by the Thessalian witches is clear: In the works of Apollonius Rhodius... as well as of Homer, there are stories of magic drinks which indicate that the alkaloid hyoscyamine was the most active ingredient. The first two authors mentioned above give detailed descriptions of the way in which Circe and her brother's daughter Medea, who was equally skilled in the magic arts, gathered their magical herbs. There can scarcely be any doubt that these to sinister mythical figures were based on actual people— contemporary Greek witches who knew the dangerous powers of henbane.54 Hansen argues that the two species employed in ancient Greece were Golden Henbane (Hyoscyamus aureus), and White Henbane (H. albus), as they were localized there; this does not rule out the better-known Black Henbane (//. nigef), or Egyptian Henbane (H. muticus). The latter is recognized as the more powerful species, and is grown commercially as a source for pharmaceutical Hyoscyamine, Dioscorides was clear that H. albus was more desirable as .1 therapeutic medicine because it was less likely to cause madness; perhaps making it simultaneously less desirable as an herb for bewitching others.

This other, recently joined to the race of wolves, makes ready to weep but howls instead; and yet another, as an Indian tiger, walks tamely though the house.... These poisons more effectively lead a man away from his true self— the dread poisons which enter deep within and harm not the body but savagely wound the mind.

Challenging the supposition of R.de Ropp that the Dinoysian maenads of antiquity drank wine laced with belladonna, Duerr notes that the plant was rare in ancient Greece, found only in a small number of woods in Thessaly; this, however, would not prevent the magicians of Thessaly from using it in their rites and philtres. The plant's reputation in sorcery is well-established; the priest-physicians of ancient Sumer employed it for driving out disease-causing Noxious Spirits; and in his 1589 Magia Naturalis Porta wrote of it: A drachm of the root of which, among other properties, has this, that it will make men mad without any hurt.

Thessalian witches were credited with necromancy, that is, raising the dead. Of this type of magic, there are often classified two types: the first, known as sciomancy, is the raising of the disembodied spirit of the deceased, either to visible or auditory appearance or by mediumistic means; the second, necyomancy is the re-animation of dead tissue, such as those works of necromancy attributed to Jesus of Nazareth. Though Thessalian witches are documented as using both types of necromancy56, the first is more common and the type we shall discuss in the context of plant-magic, involving Aconite and Poison Hemlock. Greeks held Poison Hemlock and Aconite sacred to Hecate, and that both plants have intimate associations with death. Diodorus reports in Book 5 of his Ancient History that Hekate first discovered Aconite and \"expended all her efforts in making up deadly poisons.\" Aconite, also known as Monkshood and Wolfsbane, was believed by the ancient Greeks to have sprung from the banks of the Acheron, a river in Hades; and, alternatively, from the slavering jowls of the hell-hound Cerberus. Aconite is also supposed to have been the poison that formed the cup which Medea prepared for Theseus. Plutarch gives an account of Marc Antony's army being in want of food, digging up some of these roots, and devouring them with the result that every man dying in paroxysm.

Chemically, Aconite contains a range of Diterpene alkaloids including mesaconitine, hypaconitine, non-nitrogenous compounds including salsolinol; picratonitine, aconine, benzoylamine, and neopelline. The roots and leaves contain the greatest concentration of poisons. These toxins possess a characterology of envenomation which clearly echoes not only the proclivities of Hekate, but of the dead and necromancy itself. The ancient Greek writer Nicander of Colophon (c. 270-200 B.C.) wrote of Aconite in his Alexipharmaca:"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"When one takes aconite, the drinker's jaws and the roof of his mouth and his gums are constricted by the bitter draught as it wraps itself about the top of the chest, crushing the man with evil choking in the throws of heartburn.

And all the while, the moisture drips from his streaming eyes; and his belly sore shaken throws up wind, and much of it settles below about his mid-navel; and in his head is a grievous weight, and there ensues a rapid throbbing beneath his temples, and with his eyes he sees things double... Modern toxicologists agree on these symptoms, with one curious addition: those who survive aconite poisoning report hallucinations and bizarre sensory disturbances for some time after the poison has been excreted. It would seem that, even if we lack clear references on the use of Aconite in Thessalian sorcery, the plant was known to the (i reeks sufficiently to attribute it to their goddess of the dead and sorcery. Given what is known of the powers and idiosyncrasies of Aconite poisoning, it possible, even probable, that this plant may have been used as an adjunct to rites calling forth the Mighty Dead. Aconite has potential as a candidate for other types of ancient Thessalian sorcery, such as love-philtres. InTaoist sex magic, Fu-tzu or Chinese Aconite (Aconitum carmichaeli) was combined with oyster shells, travertine, and other herbs to create the much esteemed Hanshi, or Five Mineral Powder, a stimulating aphrodisiac taken in brandy.

Aconite, along with Poison Hemlock and nightshade plants such as belladonna, is also frequently identified with medieval Witches Flying Ointments. A final consideration of the Thessalian pharmacopeia is Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum), the presumed agent by which Socrates was forcefully ushered out of this world. The ancient Greek poison Conium was derived from a plant called koneion, whose precise botanical identity is still unknown to us. Dioscorides left a description of the plant, which is certainly a member of the Dill Family, but Linnaeus, when creating his system of plant taxonomy, assigned the generic Conium to this plant. According to Plato, there were no violent symptoms of Socrates' demise, an observation at odds with what we know of Hemlock poisoning; it is probable that opium was an adjunct to the suicide-potion for its narcotic and anaesthetic effects. Like Aconite, Poison Hemlock was also considered sacred to Hekate by the ancient Greeks, and appears in a number of medieval recipes for 'Witches' Flying Ointments. Harold Hansen in The Witch's Garden writes: Chemical experiments have proved that the poisons of the two hemlocks [C. maculatum and Cowbane, Cicuta virosa], especially coniine, taken in small doses and rubbed into the skin, can produce the sensation of gliding through the air. As we have already seen, Hekate has been associated with the flights throughout the air of the dead. This link with the dead, through the medium of drug-induced flight, or by employing Conium in conjunction with trance techniques, could indeed have been part of the sorcerous necromantic repertoire of the Thessalian witches, and their spiritual ancestors, the Lamiae of the Middle-Ages."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Matter of Man $ In the lexicon of Sabbatic Witchcraft, mumia refers to sacrificial offerings from the human temple, living or dead, used as foci of sorcerous power. Such substances are diverse i n their origin and usage, but most often encompass blood, flesh, bone and the generative seed of woman and man. Its origin as a word comes in part from the mumia of the medieval alchemist and apothecary - the medicinal preparation compounded from human flesh, most often the pulverized corpse.58 Not limited to magic and medicine, the putrefactive material of the corpse also achieved apotheosis in the form of the eternal image, as dessicated cadavers of Old Egypt were also ground to render the pigment Mummy Brown, used in oil painting in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The culture of morbidity and sanguinous per-versions which pervaded European religion, art, medicine, and philosophy has been captured in exceedingly visceral detail by the Italian scholar of micro-history Piero Cam-poresi.60 The ravages of bubonic plague in fourteenth cen-tury Europe, annihilating a third of her souls, witnessed a spectacle of pestilence, death, and decay scarcely imaginable to the modern mind; this cultural trauma impressed itself deeply in the collective psyche. Plague doctors, flagellants, and guilds of undertakers and corpse-carriers were surface phenomena of the spectral forces ravaging the land at an invisible level. Secret guilds such as the Antient Order of Bonesmen, whose precise history is obscure, represent a curious nexus of death mysticism, funerary custom, custo-dianship of the corpse, and occult power.61 59.

A Bohemian manual of magical cures discovered on a Texas ranch contains the following formula: When you have a toothache, go into an ossuary, take a skull and extract a tooth out of it and rub the gums until they bleed so that the tooth will be covered with blood. Place the tooth back in the skull but not with bare hands and pray the Lord's prayer and the creed once.

Sacrifice, arguably the most ancient sorcerous act, reaches its apex when that which is offered is ourselves -the Matter of Man.

The perfection of human-derived Azoth however, lies beyond the flasks and bulbs of the alchemical philosopher, in magico-sexual generation of the medicine by a focused sorcerous application using the human body as the laboratory.68 The mortal body, as the temple of spirit, is also known to sorcery for its strengthening mumic projections into the material world.

Cephalomantic augury, utilising skulls and disembodied heads as oracles - was not the sole preserve of the so-called Celtic 'cult of the head', but was also well known to ancient Greek sorcery, and earlier in Mesopotamia.71 That the practice was established in ancient times is illustrated by a magical operation from the Papyri Graecae Magicae whose purpose is to restrain a falsely-prophesying or incoherent skull deemed unsuitable for soothsaying. The mouth of the offending bone was to be sealed with grave-earth; its unseemly predilections further bound with a ring of iron engraved with a headless lion wearing the crown of Isis, and trampling a skeleton.72 The practice of the oracular skull persists in a number of syncretic sorcerous traditions in modern times; a skull frequently occupies the Ganadero, or sinistral side of the mesa, the altar of the Peruvian 69.

A number of such rites, including the incubation of visions by drinking potions compounded from ale and human ashes, are practised by the Bonesmen of East Anglia, to whom veneration of the bone is central. Together with their traditional stewardship of graves and boneyards, the Bonesmen possess a sophisticated understanding of the interplay between bone and spirit, the features of which are often shamanic in outline.74 The Skull is also held sacred as a magical object in some forms of Wicca, such as Alexandrian Craft, and in extant streams of Traditional Witchcraft, including Clan Tubal-Cain and the Cultus Sabbati. A modern, exoteric recension of one such ritual venerates the skull as the living oracle of Cain Sa'Ira ('Cain the Hairy'), the Green Man or patron of wilderness, agriculture, and occult herbalism.75 Though some Craft streams have, as a portion of their sorcerous heredity, come to embrace certain ritual elements of Freemasonry relating to the skull, the inner magical uses serve a far higher station than a mundane symbol of mortality.

The Latin church plied a vast trade in Saints' Relics, including highly-venerated bones, ampullae of blood, and corpses entire of incorruptible flesh. At times, the zealous pursuit of this fascination led to grave-burgling on a massive scale: In the twelfth century the shrine at the cathedral at Cologne obtained the skulls of the Three Wise Men of the East who brought gifts to the infant Jesus. In competition the church of St. Gereon produced the relics of St. Gereon and his whole band of martyrs. The competitive spirit spread to the church of St. Ursula, and a whole cemetery was despoiled to cover the interior walls of the monastery with the relics of St. Ursula and her eleven thousand virgin martyrs.76 We should not be surprised at this example, despite its grotesque nature: in the middle ages necromancy was practised within the cloister with some frequency, and constituted a kind of 'clerical underworld' as magical historian Richard Kiekhefer has observed.77 Still, the line between good Christian and folk-charmer often lies obscured in the mists of spirit-time, wherein there is a considerable accumulation of heathenism.

These remains, reborn as wands, staves, enchanted horns, or simply left in their natural forms, become the unique preceptors of spirit-wisdom accessed by means of atavisms of ghost and flesh, the gate-keepers of the realm of the Dead.79 Such is the effectuation of bone as material legacy - an incarnative monument raised by the cunning of the body in accord with lineage, having assimilated the diverse wealth of the earth unto its foundations. Stripped of its putrefactive stages, it is become purified as a new incarnate form, the encharmed bridge betwixt Living and Dead.

Transmitted by the noisome taint of worms and micro-organisms en masse, putrefaction was a philosophically confounding process both dead and alive; the stench and ugliness generated in contaminated victuals were likewise an offense to reason as well as the senses. Early technologies of food preservation included cooling, drying and salting to arrest decomposition, or, in some cases, to mask the objectionable flavors of rancidification.83 The ancient arts of meat preservation naturally share a kinship with embalming: the outrage of post-mortem decay was of prime importance to the Old Egyptians, whose methods of providing salvific respite for the corpse may rightly be considered a magico-religious art form. In Christianity, the processes of corporeal decay were assigned to the dominion of the Devil, likely one reason for the folklore that Satan cannot abide the presence of salt. Persons who claimed to have attended the medieval Witches Sabbat remarked on the absence of salt at the feast. Similarly, when salt was brought in, the spectral revelers of midnight's table suddenly vanished, leaving the guest alone. The power of salt for slowing or arresting decay also relates to its magical uses for exorcism, blessing and consecration. The magician's exorcised circle is thus both fortified and mummified, a perfectly-preserved moment in time and space. Both the corrupted products of Death and the means of slowing or arresting them bear crucial relationships to the Witches' Supper, which in one interpretation (stripped of its heretical elements) can be seen as fostering a ritual H 3.

That the witches' delectations should be portrayed in the first instance as necro-cannibalistic is consistent with the position of witchcraft as transgressive, and as operating in spheres roundly condemned by religious and social orthodoxy. The witches' relation to the dead vis-a-vis their atrocious meal is, on the surface, portrayed as a mock Christian communion, or as the vulgar tactic of demonizing enemies by implied cannibalism. On a different level, the Supper operates as a hieroglyph of specific witchcraft power, namely the unique magical relationship between witches and the so called 'Mighty Dead', the retinue of ancestral shades and fountain of pre-incarnate atavism. The art of necromancy, or magically calling forth the shades of the dead, has long been a vibrant strand of witchcraft and magic of many epochs, and in many recensions may be considered its driving engine. Linked with more ancient currents of shamanism, this art was known from the writings of ancient Sumer, Chaldaea, and Greece, the latter providing the prototypal witch-figure and poisoner Circe, the sorceress of Homer's Odyssey. The materia of the Dead —flesh, blood, and bones— is the mumia of art, known well to witchcraft, alchemy, folk magic, and medicine.84 The act of its ritual consumption, presented in early modern Witches' Supper depictions as vulgar cannibalism, encodes a number of precise ritual formulae and powers in necromantic magic. The most important of these is the elevation of 'dead' matter to a living state by its incorporation into the living body. This is the active principle underlying the Holy Eucharist, wherein, through divine transmutation of elements 84.Pulverized corpses were for centuries an essential part of the official preparation, of the apothecary and pharmacist.

The potent necromantic implications of the Holy Communion, as a magical act, would have been instantly recognizable to practitioners of folk-sorcery, particularly in contexts where funerary rites maintained close communication with the departing spirit. Present within the Feast of the Dead is also the Formula of Opposition, a precept which underlies many historical patternings of witchcraft. Named by Andrew D. Chumbley, who wrote about it extensively85, the Formula is an operant dynamic between the sorcerer and the 'Other', that being the zones of spirit-alienation external to personal experience and containing ungathered seeds of occult numen. In the case of historical folk magic, Formulae of Opposition are often transgressive against law, religious orthodoxy, or social convention, but above all against Self; as exacted they often make use of inversion.86 In violation of strongly-held personal Tabu, the structure normally governing conception and use of magical power is overturned, resulting in a liberation of consciousness, and the acquisition of previously-forbidden realms of power.87 At the Feast of the Witches, a culinary encounter with dismembered limbs, organs, and heads serves as an oppositional force on a multitude of levels, from the basic violation of the senses, to affronts against personal and group morality. Whilst the actual consumption of decomposing human flesh by historical practitioners of H5.

More relevant is the depictions of the moribund Feast as a symbol of initiatic power gained through the Formula of Opposition. The Accursed Victual, as a component of the Feast, may also mask the presence of initiatic power, conveyed through mumia. A recurrent component of magical charms is the secretion of semen, menstrual blood, feces, or urine into food as a spell of control over one's victim. This action mimics the spoor secreted by many mammals for the 'marking' or 'claiming' of territory and if correctly engaged draws upon a vast astral repository of atavism, and belongs to an ancient stratum of magic reaching into prehistory. Spells employing such secreted matter are transgressive of ancient dietary laws wherein food, and the feast itself, represents a sacrosanct compact between the dining parties. However, when the parties are wholly conscious of the nature of their food, and eat nonetheless —as they are shown doing in portrayals of the Witches' Supper— it may be presumed that there are religious or magical reasons for doing so, namely reverence for the deceased, the acquisition of power, or both. All such approaches to the Feast are essentially necromantic, and as a coercive approach to spirits, it is properly classed as sorcery. It is thus aligned with early modern witchcraft, but ritual communion with the dead using food and drink is also a feature of ancient religion.\"\" Roman cults of the dead persisted into the early centuries of Christianity, with night-long memorial feasts in honor of those whose bodies had passed, often in situ at the tombs themselves.

Ritual consumption of the dead as part of a socially acceptable funerary practice, is also documented.90 The abominable meats, bones, and sundered limbs often pictured at the Witches' Supper may be afforded an additional interpretation with regard to their magical role at the Witches Sabbath. In certain inquisitional records, an emergent pattern among some groups, which differed from the usual clerical projections, involved a banquet with archaic features which scholar Wolfgang Behringer has called \"Ihe Miracle of the Bones'.91 This features the restoration of life to a cow or other animal from a disjointed skeleton. The implicit power of this mystery as a magical practice is captured in a section of Robert Fitzgerald's Midnight's Table, a manual of witchcraft lore and spellcraft concerning the arcane powe of the witches' banquet: The Mind void yet the Thoughtfully formed. The Body hungry yet the Spirit replenished. The Wood unfinished yet the Table carved. The Platter empty yet the Larder full.92 Here the desolation of the witches' feast remains, as well as their potentiality as nutritive victuals or even as living beings, is invoked, the suggestion of Voidful Presence through the juxtaposition of emptiness and corporeal flesh.

This symbolic and emblematic patterning is completely consistent with the atavistic patterning evident in the orally-transmitted magical lore of the Sabbatic Cultus. The natural transformative processes of rot and decay are crucial strands of the magical currents feeding folk magic and witchcraft. The alchemists of Europe explored putrefactive states thoroughly, borrowing the process from Nature, then emulating, calibrating, and magnifying it under precise fractionations in glass vessels. It is likely that, as with the Royal Art itself, a considerable portion of putrefactive magic in Europe was a direct inheritance of Arabic and Islamic magic; such texts as Gayat al-Hakim and Kitab al-Sumum employ numerous members of dead animals, some ritually killed, for cursing, poison, and magical power. These usages also occur in the later corpus of European grimoire formulae. However, the powers of putrefaction and decomposition had a far more ancient pedigree, one of which is of specific interest to the Sabbath banquet. Correctly harnessed, they give rise to both of the primary mysteries of the witch sacrament: the Bread and Wine. In the Bread and Wine of the Witches Supper, some have seen the historical outlines of the ritual consumption of psychoactive substances at the Sabbath, specifically conveyed through food and drink, and indeed this interpretation is present in some modern-day witchcraft practices. Historical references are uncommon, but suggestive. The Inquisitor Pierre DeLancre reported that the bread of the Basque witches'was black and revolting, its flour ground from black millet, and served with 'false meats'. Aside from its resemblance to cadaverous flesh, the 'black bread' is of potential toxicological interest. In centuries past, white flour was a privilege of the wealthy,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"10. Hie Nocturnal Assembly gathering corpses for the Witches' Supper.

Piero Camporesi in his Bread of Dreams has speculated that psychoactive contaminants of grain such as darnel (Lolium temulentum) and ergot (Clavicepspurpurea) were so common in the flours of some regions and eras that the average peasant was in a constant state of intoxicatio as a consequence of poor diet. If true, the evidence cited suggests that the psychoactivity of such breads was an accidental by-product of a fouled food supply, but if the phenomenon was understood by herbalists and magical practitioners, there would be little to stop the cunning from crafting experimental loaves.93 Indeed, as with the Thelemic 'Cakes of Light', the Sabbath Bread has its own secret formulations. 93. The obvious problem in formulation is that the biochemically active adulterants of such speculative breads carry considerable risk of undesirable pathologies, such as gangrene, necrosis, and convulsions brought on by ergotism."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The old term \"Crow's Bread\" originates in the founding lineages of the witchcraft order Cultus Sabbati, and originally referred to the intoxicating mushroom Psilocybe semilanceata as a gift of the spirits for visionary ritual use. In the late 20th century, the term was applied within the group for broader use to refer to any psychoactive ritual substance gathered from Nature, but its nature as 'Bread' is linked both with the Communion Host of Christ and the male generative power linked with the 'Lord of Light', in some cases identified with Lucifer. In this latter association, the Bread's power as Revelator is especially notable. Covines and lodges of the Cultus have long made use of venefic gnosis in various forms; its oldest known recensions, dating from the second half of the nineteenth century, contain obscure charms against poison, as well as certain ritual transmissions of power using a prepared psychoactive sacrament. Oral teachings long pre-dating the Great War concern another poisonous species of note in Britain: Belladonna. There are also adjunctive practices concerning a multitude of other plants of power, specifically their Eucharistic power.94 My contacts with other Traditional Witchcraft groups outside of the Cultus have, on occasion, affirmed the presence of such sacraments elsewhere, some of which have themselves passed into a largely symbolic or chemically inert form. Within the Sabbatic Cultus, the Bread of the Sabbath Feast operates upon many magical levels, its essence is intimately tied to British agricultural cycle, the God of Harvest, Corn and Sheaf, sometimes manifest in the mythical divinity of John Barleycorn. The germ of this myth encloses the great mystery of ritual murder and resurrection embodied in the Holy Loaf, and the resulting 94. Chumbley, A. \"The Golden Chain and the Lonely Road\", Opuscula Magica Vul. 1.

This quintessential^ English expression of the Bread is thus seminal, nutritive, life-giving, and radiant, but also embracing the mysterium of Death and a patterning of seasonal time and tide. Here Barleycorn is sometimes identified as the Witch-Father Mahazhael. He is thus often depicted as a skeletal god with an erect phallus, bearing a scythe, sickle, and stalk of grain; his mystery is well encapsulated in his invocation from Chumbley's The Dragon-Book of Essex: On the first day I awoke within the furrow. On the second day I knelt in prayer cneath the sun. On the third day I stood in the long green robe. On the fourth day my head was crowned with gold. On the fifth day the sickle laid me to rest. On the sixth day my body was ground between stone. On the seventh day I was raised anew to feed the brethren at Midnight's table -to serve at the Round Feast for both the Living and the Dead.95 In addition to the process of ritual murder which births the Bread, the putrefactive processes used for its fermentation, via yeast or bacteria, are also reckoned as a part of the Corn-God's dominion. As a natural agent of corruption, yeasts are widespread and penetrate countless strata of the world, often contaminating foodstuffs, as well as the human organism. Even where fermentation conditions are controlled, the process of making bread and wine relies on the mass death of these microorganisms. This catastrophic loss of life, on the order of hundreds of millions of individuals per loaf, nonetheless provides a delectable crumb serving as both an holy sacrament and the common man's 'Staff of Life'.

The magical corollary to the Witches' Bread is the Vinum Sabbati, orWinecup of Midnight's Table. Its alignment is with the Moon and the Lunar emanation, the feminine principle, and the many humours of the body, primarily blood, but also the female sexual secretions, both gross and subtle. In witchcraft contexts, as well as other secret societies and magical orders, the Wine is of legendary status and a great deal of lore and doctrines have emerged concerning its generation and use. To some it is a cup producing fantastic visions, to others, an initiatic ordeal which serves as the most harrowing trial for the drinker. Certain teachings, through its association with both the Living Cup and its Wine as a single entity, have two essential natures which in combination, magically unify to create a Blessed Third, an apotheosis of both. Within the Cultus Sabbati, the 'Graal of Midnight' has precise formulations to empower and support the various pathways of Sabbatic Congressus: Thanatomantic, Atavistic, Sexual, and many others. By a metaphorii pathway, the Wine of the Sabbath is not only a fluid it-medium, fermented and distilled within the Flesh of the Initiate, but also the entire process of corporeal transmutation during its imbibition at the High Sabbat. As an actual drink conveying ritual power, a medieval prototype of the Wine of the Sabbath is to be found in Johannes Nider's Formicarius (1435), which alleged the witches of the Simmenthal region of Switzerland were initiated using a potion brewed from the ashes of infants. More important than the composition of the brew was its"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"alleged effect: the beguiling draught conferred upon the initiate an instant knowledge of the Art Magical. Though described prior to the advent of the Sabbath as a major component of witchcraft, it is the ritual cup and its function as a bestower of witch-power which links it to the Witches' Supper. The bridge between wine and the incorporeal host is also relevant to the nature of the witches' cup. Historically, the grape was considered divine not only by mankind but also by spirits of the Dead.96 In ancient Greece, the Vine-shoot was regarded as possessing strong properties of purification; wine was often poured there as a libation for the dead, as well as to chthonic deities. This custom of offering alcohol to the deceased resisted the strongest attempts at eradication; Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus (427-449) reports with outrage pagans bringing wine to the deceased in evening rites. Cassarius relays a legend in which two servants at the monastery of Laach, charged to guard the vineyard by night, bribed the devil to do their work with a cophinum full of grapes, a deal which was apparently kept. Amongst the nocturnal activities later alleged of the Vaudois witches was the invasion of wine cellars, led there in a troupe by the Devil. \"Under lead of the demon they enter cellars and drink wine, all of them first urinating in the cask from which it is drawn.\"97 The threefold linkage of wine to the Dead, witches and the Devil draw additional lines of arcane association with the Sabbatic Grail, both as a form of communion with the Dead and with the Black Man of the Sabbath, the God of the Lamiae. 96. Let it be remembered that the first Deities of the Vine were goddesses; this was to change in Egypt, where Osiris achieved primacy. As lord of the Dead, he was appeased with vinous libations. Wine was also used as nourishment while journeying in the Spirit Realms. 97.

However, wine was present in England before the advent of Christianity; introduced by the Romans, there is evidence for viticulture among the Anglo-Saxons; one conservative estimate identifies at least 139 definite or possible vineyards in medieval Britain.98 Though climatological trends in past centuries have fluctuated, and viticulture has prospered or suffered accordingly, the Genius of the Vine has been present in England for millennia. This is certainly sufficient time for a body of lore and rites to have accreted around the Grape and its divine expressions, drawing from numerous magico-religious currents, as well as the inevitable corpus of agrarian lore which accompanies so important and venerated a crop. This is to say nothing of England's great tradition of hedge wines, a testament both to the ingenuity of her vintners and the botanical diversity of her lands. The Cup of Wine which features so prominently at the Feast of the Witches may be understood as the mechanism of sorcerous transmutation of the body, not only its vehicle, but- its symbol, process, teaching, and legacy. This symbol in activated form unfolds, as an opening rose, the entire ecstatic algorithm of the Sabbat. Within the rites of Sabbatic Witchcraft, the Wine of the Devil's Graal appears in radiance at the confluence of sorcerous enchantment and spirit-veneration.

The alpha-numeric essence of this matter is eloquently contained within the number 710, which corresponds both to the grail-poison ([tar'elah) and the Sabbath itself.101 The active magical nature of the Witching Graal, and its function as the intermediary in rites of 'Communion' naturally evokes the Body of the Goddess as the portal of mystery. In the Sabbatic traditions of witchcraft, the shade-mother Lilith or Liliya Devala is identified with the witches' cup in both its exalted and desecrated forms, aligned with sex-magical moduli of Void-mind (the empty cup) and the conjured circle of spirits (the full cup). Other permutations occur, especially those co-identified with the body of the Priestess or ritual adjuditrices. Each wine vinted within these cups is as much a product of the Vessel as the Vine. Kenneth Grant has linked the Sabbatic Wine to the blood of Charis, wife of the smith-god Haephestos, and also known as the threefold goddess Charites, or the Graces. Expanding upon the writings of Massey, which quote the ancient writings of the Gnostic Marcus, Grant links the Vinum Sabbati with the blood of Charis, the 'original Eucharist' of the early Gnostic Christians. The vintage is the central component of the ancient magico-sexual rites of trance mediumship wherein the goddess spoke through a chosen medium.102 This bears certain similarities with kindred operations in the Order of Eastern Templars, as 100.

A prime concen-trator of atavistic force, it is a gateway to the dominion of Faerie and a guardian of the Way. It is never hunted, but when encountered must be acknowledged by certain ritual customs and sacrifices. Importantly, it eschews dung, unlike other visionary mushrooms of its genus, and thus in mystical terms is separated from Abel, the unrefined or 'profane' nature of flesh prefiguring the sorcerer Cain. Proceeding as it does from the soil and thus the subterranean vaults of the Mighty Dead, its fruiting body is the brief apotheosis of those fallen and yet come again: the ephemeral Risen Phallus of the Spirit-Meadow.

We find written examples of this in antiquity such as that mentioned in The Testament of Solomon (c. 3rd century AD), in which the venerable magician \"frustrates\" the arch-demon Asmodeus with the smoke of liver, fish gall, and a storax branch.110 In more recent times, wild cherry wood has been smoldered as a fumigant by Greek peasants to drive away the Kallikantzaroi, the rapacious theriomorphic beings of the underworld known to walk the earth during the Ember Nights, and who wander the earth at noon and midnight. Cherry and its arboreal kin (Prunus spp.) contain varying amounts of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or or Prussic acid in the leaves and kernels.111 The psychoactivity of the inhaled burning products of and its relatives are touched upon by Pendell in Pharmako / poeia, specifically with reference to Prunus emarginata. 109.

Christianity, particularly the Roman Catholic, Coptic, and Greek Orthodox Churches, have retained the fumigant as a ceremonial purifier. In modern times, when one is taken ill by an inexplicable cause, it is not unknown for Greek Orthodox priests to make a house call to the afflicted, and use, among other things, fumigants to banish the illness-causing spirits or influences. The magical virtues of fumigants were also well known to those promoting the witch-hunts of the Inquisition, and though associated with sorcery and diabolism, this did not prevent the good fathers from using them for Christian means. Johann Christoph Frolich, a professor of law in the late 17th century, advises that the torture chamber for extracting confession from witches be \"constantly sprinkled with holy water and a smoke be made with blessed herbs.\" Valerio Polidori's book Practica Exorcistarum ad Daemones etMaleficia de Christi Fidelibus Pellendum of 1626 gives three incenses (Profumigatio Horribilis) for driving away devils: I. 6 drachms each of seed of Hypericum, Rue and Frankincense. II. 1 drachm each of Frankincense, Storax, Galbanum, Laudanum, and Garyophyllum. III. 1 drachm each of Galbanum Sulfur, Asafoetida, Aristolochia, and Rue.

Divination by smoke, particularly using burning poppy seeds, was known as Capnomancy; Libanomancy was a more general term for divination by the fumes of incense. The eleventh century manual of astrological sorcery Picatrix contains a series of sophisticated incense formulations, mainly for planetary genii, whose composition bears a close resemblance to suffumigants later appearing in European grimoires. The Incense of Saturn, is notable for its inclusion of Opium, together with Myrtle, Saffron, Plantain, Bush Grass, Soiled Wool, Colocynth Grease, black cat hair, and black goat wool.112 The publication of Henry Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy in 1531 marks an important point in the development of the magical fumigant; this large tome was the largest collection of pagan Neoplatonic magic ever compiled, and was of great influence in its time and for centuries to come. Two chapters are relevant to our study: \"Chapter XLIII: Of Perfumes, or Suffumigations, Their Manner and Power\" and \"Chapter XLIV: The Com-position of Some Fumes Appropriated to the Planets.\" A number of these recipes contain poisonous plants of known or suspect psychoactivity, for example: So they say, that if of coriander, smallage, henbane and hemlock be made a fume, that spirits will presently come together; hence they are called the spirits' herbs. Pertinent to our investigation of the fumigants of grimoires, however, is that locus where sorcerous control of spirit and psychoactivity intersect. A final recipe, perhaps 112.

These recipes constitute only a portion of total incense recipes from the grimoiric corpus; there are many other formulae which feature plant ingredients not known to produce visionary effects or altered consciousness, whose provenance is chiefly of planetary correspondence, desirable odor, and that which some researchers call 'sympathetic magic'. Liber Juratus, or The Sworn Book ofHonorius, is a grimoire dated to at least the 13th century which is particularly rich in fumigant recipes. The text informs the reader of \"a suffumygacion made of these hearbes as foloweth causeth visions of the earthe to appeare\", probably referring to the 113.

The incense mixture is made from root of Cane Reed, root of Giant Fennel, Pomegranate skin, Henbane, Red Sandalwood, Black Poppy and \"the hearbe tassi barbassi\".114 Another recipe is made from Coriander, Henbane, and skin of Pomegranate and causes \"visons in the air or elsewhere to appear.\" The common psychoactive ingredient of known efficacy in these two incenses is Black Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), a plant of the nightshade family long associated with diabolism. Together with Wolfsbane (Aconitum napellus), Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum), and a number of other nightshades, Henbane comprises the essential botanical template for the Unguentum Sabbati, or Witches' Flying Ointment, which are also contemporary to the time frame of our study. Henbane and other solanaceous plants bear a class of chemicals collectively referred to as the tropane alkaloids, the most important of which are atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine. These alkaloids —particularly scopolamine— have long been known to inspire visions with strong phantasmagoric or erotic content; delirium, frenzy, and varying degrees of amnesia upon return to the senses.IIS The smoke of burning Hyoscyamus is also known to be psychoactive, with historically attested uses in Asia, the Near East, and North Africa. Of particular interest are is the usage of the smoldering leaves by Bedouin sorcerers and thieves for its stupefying effects.\"6 Jonathan Ott cites the experiments of 114. Tassi barbassi is most often considered to be Mullein (Verbascum thapsis), known in folklore as Hag's Taper. In both European and Asian magical traditions, Mullein was held to possess the power to chase demons and noxious spirits. In some streams of lore, burning Mullein stalks illuminated the night flights of witches. Giant Fennel may refer to apiaceous aromatics such as Galbanum, Armoniac, or Asafoetida, or indeed poisonous plants in the umbel family such as Hemlock. 115.Richard Evans Schultes, Plants of the Gods, p. 86; Hansen, The Witches' Garden, pp.63-67. 116.

Poison Hemlock is frequently found in ceremonial suffumigant recipes. Agrippa states that an incense made from Sagapen, juice of Hemlock, Henbane, Mullein, Red Sandalwood, and Poppy, makes \"spirits and strange shapes appear;\" as well as a second recipe containing Hemlock but of simpler composition. Agrippa's demon-summoning formula is echoed by Girolamo Cardano, in his 1550 encyclopedia of natural science entitled De Subtilitate, who notes that vapors of smoldering coriander, celery, henbane, and poison hemlock will \"instantly cause demons to assemble\". The toxic principle in Poison Hemlock is the alkaloid coniine, considered a carcinogen, occurring in all parts of the plant, but concentrated strongest in the unripe fruits. Symptoms of poisoning include retching, vomiting, increasing muscular weakness and pain, rigor of the limbs, inability to speak, blindness, respiratory dysfunction, and death. Coniine paralyzes motor nerves, ultimately causing death by respiratory failure. Toxicological studies on coniine poisoning from oral ingestion indicate little in the way of visual distortion or hallucinogenic activity; and in fact one symptom is blindness.118 Routes of coniine absorption other than oral are a somewhat different matter. In the context of discussing the Witches' Flying Ointments, Hansen cites unidentified clinical studies which indicate 117. Pharmacotheon, p. 369. 118.Turkington, Carol.

The dominant sensation was acute physical constriction, combined with lightheadedness, vertigo, and, in seeming, an increased sensitivity to light. Removed to an area of darkness and quietude, a sensation of lateral undulating floatation was noted, several inches above the ground attended. This may be crudely described as lying supine on a conveyor belt which has a smal amount of rise and fall, as with waves on a body of water. The sensation was in no way ecstatic, and indeed was pervaded by a constant and tenebrous fear of death. If transdermal absorption of fresh plant alkaloids may be considered 'entheogenic', burning the plant is another matter. Coniine is an unstable alkaloid and begins to break down soon after the plant is harvested. Dried leaves and roots contain almost no coniine. The alkaloids are some-what more stable in the seed, and these have been harvested for incense usage in magical circles in which I have participated. In this particular case it should be noted that the suffumigants were initially not meant to be conscious-ness altering; rather, seed of Hemlock was incorporated for their planetary resonance, usually that of Saturn. Mixed with other ingredients of sweeter and more bouyant character, Hemlock did not dominate the mixture's aromatics or energetics. Smoldered alone, the seeds of C. maculatum are known to generate headaches and brief disorientation, but nothing close to atmospheres conducive to visionary trance or ecstatic intoxication. A1998 report from my private record of magical operations is instructive. Here, four braziers 119.

Within minutes, however, it grew acrid and became a stench, like burning tar or hair. As the smoke thickened, the lamps in the cave grew dim... it had a putrid, oleaginous quality, like a vaporized oil whose minute droplets fiercely adhered to the nasal passages and throat. At the cellular level I seemed to be experiencing a mounting somatic outrage or revolt; seeing was made difficult, breathing impossible. In less than ten minutes we were driven from the cave and spent the better part of an hour fighting off a smoke-induced migraine. Due to the foul nature of this incense, presumably due to volatilized compounds, much of the regalia was ruined, especially that made of cloth and paper.120 When fresh, Hemlock is a foul-smelling plant, often compared to rodent urine; the odor of the fuming seeds is no better. If a demon can be described in terms of being a singularly wretched vapor, smoking Hemlock will duly summon him, for it exceeds in foulness both sulfur and brimstone. Still, it must be noted that the poisonous denizens of the Apiaceae or Dill Family are numerous, with many exemplars bearing folk names 'Hemlock' and being as toxic or moreso than C. maculatum. In addition, several of the historical grimoire incense recipes explicitly mention the juice of the plant, not the seed. Opium Gum, or products of the Opium Poppy (Papaver somniferum) also occur with some frequency in grimoiric 120. Hypnotikon."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"suffumigants. We have already examined two incense recipes, one from the Greek Magical Papyri using Opium; the other from Liber Juratus for summoning earth-spirits, using Black Poppy in combination with Henbane. A second fumigant from Liber Juratus is compounded from \"coriander, and saffron, henbanne, parslie and blake popie the water therof the popie dysstilled and tempered wt the iuce of the poungarnet skine\". It is unclear what part of the poppy is first mentioned, but the \"water of the poppy distilled\" is probably tincture of opium or laudanum, or some other fluidic concentration of the plant's narcotic virtue. The same grimoire gives a suffumigant recipe for calling forth the planetary genius of Saturn, compounding seeds of Henbane and Poppy, together with Root of Mandrake, Myrrh, ground lapis lazuli, and the blood or brains of a bat. In this recipe, smoke from the seeds of Black Poppy is probably insufficient to account for an appreciable narcotic effect when burned, but the addition of henbane and mandrake would certainly lend pharmacological potency to the mixture, and, unlike coniine, tropane alkaloids are notoriously stable over time and a wide platform of administration routes. We now turn our attention to The Sword of Moses, a ioth century Hebrew-Aramaic book of magic in which we find the following spell: To walk in the street and not to be recognized by anyone, take wormwood, perfumes, and soot, and moke thyself with it, and take the heart of a fox, and say the 'Sword,' and go out in the street. Though this fumigant is clearly burned for invisibility, it is notable for the presence of Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium, an asteraceous herb best known as the \"Green Fairy\" whose distilled spirits engendered the popular"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"inebriant Absinthe. Wormwood contains Thujone, an isomer of camphor, with known psychoactivity. A second Wormwood-bearing fumigant recipe appears in the Clavicula Solomonis: a suffumigation for the planetary genii of Mars, consisting entirely of dessicated Wormwood and Rue. Wormwood, along with such herbs as Poison Hemlock and Monkshood, in classical times fell under the dominion of Hecate, Goddess of sorcery.121 Its use as a suffumigant is also known in modern collations of necromantic spells.122 As noted, the Thujone in Wormwood is chemically related to Camphor, a crude resin extracted from the Lauraceous Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora). It is also naturally present in other plants such as Rosemary and Mint. This refined botanical substance has been banned or regulated in some countries, including the United States, and its potency as a toxin should not be minimized. In addition to less pleasant side-effects of camphor poisoning, \"dizziness, disturbed vision, delirium, and convulsions\" are noted.123 Its action upon the heart in certain cases may also classify it as an exhilarant. The resin appears in several grimoiric suffumigants of note, and is of known psychoactivity: Christian Ratsch observes that camphor \"in high doses can elicit powerful states of ecstatic inebriation.\"124 Turning to our corpus of'black books', we 121. Agrippa, paraphrasing Porphyry, writes: \"Hecate commanded how images should be constituted to her, and that they were to be surrounded with wormwood, and that domestic mice were to be painted, and the finest ornaments such as were most pleasing to her, and so many mice as her forms were to be taken; then blood, myrrh, storax, and other things were to be burnt: which things if they were done, she would appear, and answer the worker thereof by dreams.\" 122.Wright, Elbee.

Echoing Agrippa's recipe for a Lunar suffum-igation, Liber Juratus employs an almost identical recipe employing Camphor and seeds of White Poppy.125 Camphor's chemical relationship with Thujone is sig-nificant and forms a link in incenses with Wormwood, which has shown mild psychoactivity when burned and inhaled. In the Grand Grimoire, the conjuration of the devil Lucifuge, Prince and Master of Rebel Spirits, is prefaced by burning copious amounts of pure Camphor in the brazier. Camphor-bearing incenses are found in other grimoires: in the section concerning suffumigations for invoking planetary genii from The Key of Solomon the King, we find a Lunar fumigant compounded from White Sandalwood, Camphor, Aloes, Amber, pounded seeds of Cucumber, Artemisia, and Ranunculus. This includes Wormwood and Ranunculus, a plant of significant toxicological standing.126 Helleborus niger or Black Hellebore, is a poison of decided infamy; all parts of the plant render up potent venoms. The extract of the rhizome was used in antiquity and medieval times as an utensil of murder, most notably by King Attalus III of Pergamos. The glycosides heleborin and hellebrin also assert a strong presence in the plant; chemically related to telo-cinobufagin (a venom of toad skin), they affect cardiac muscle in a similar manner as Foxglove, slowing heart rate. At least two grimoire incenses employ Black 125. Kenneth Grant notes the magical relationship of Camphor to the Lunar current, the subtle emanant qualities of the sexual elixirs, and also to Siva and his retinue of powers. SeeAleister Crowley and the Hidden God, p. 116. 126. The genus Ranunculus, or true buttercups, comprises some 400 species, many of which contain important poisons (See Stary, pp. 166-171). Perhaps the most important are Meadow Buttercup (R. acris), Lesser Celandine (R.ficaria), Creeping Buttercup (R. repens) and Cursed Buttercup (R. sceleratus). The chief toxins arc ranunculin and protoanemonine; these manifest poisoning symptoms, sometime* fatal, when ingested. Many species of Ranunculus are irritant vesicants and raise blisters when applied topically. Data on the phototoxicity and psychoactivity ol buttercups when burnt and inhaled is apparently lacking."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Hellebore. One is listed among the suffumigations for planetary genii from The Key of Solomon the King: Spell for vivifying a talisman with the genius of Saturn: \"This consecration consists in exposing the talisman to the fumes of a scent composed of alum, assa-foetida, scammony and sulphur, which are burned with cyprus [sic.] ash, and stalks of black hellebore lighted in an earthenware chafing-dish which has never been used for any other purpose and which has to be ground to dust and buried secretly in an unfrequented spot after the operation.' For conjuring the planetary genius of Mars, the Liber Juratus recommends a fumigant made from Euphorbium, Bdellium, Armoniac, two kinds of Hellebore, Myrrh, brains of a raven, human blood, blood of a black cat, sulfur, and \"the powder of the stone called magnes\". Severe Hellebore poisoning is a grim affair: before the bleak twilight of unconsciousness or cardiac arrest, the victim suffers burning of the mouth, slavering, a great roaring in the ears, and visual aberrations. Some persons report visionary effects and delirium from smoking the dried leaves127, but given the disagreeable relationship between Hellebore toxins and the human organism, this is discouraged. A number of other plants of known psychoactivity appear in other fumigants used as adjuncts to grimoire incenses or in later magical usage. One medieval rite of thaumaturgy made use of burning cannabis as a fumigant while invoking spirits for the purpose of a love spell.128 Another incense is 127. An infrequent but known practice in certain rites of modern Essex witchcraft; I thank Frater A. for permission of reference here. 128. Wright, pp.69-70.

While it is doubtful that burning spores alone would suffice to provoke a visionary trance, there is some evidence, cited by Christian Ratsch, suggesting the smoke of the mushroom may be inhaled for inebriating virtues, particularly among the Chuj Indians, who smoke the dried mushroom with tobacco to induce a clairvoyant trance for healing. Saffron and Frankincense, both possessing subtle effects alone, and possibly potentiated together, are also important. Nutmeg additionally possesses a complex of psychoactive principles which manifest euphoria and mild hallucinogenic activity when ingested orally, though whether these would become bioavailable when small amounts were volatilized in burning incense is unknown. It must also be remembered that synergistic effects with multiple botanical compounds are also known. 129. King, Francis. The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O., editor's introduction.

And if, being pure thou light them at dawn in the sun alight, then wilt thou see the heavenly dragons, how they wind themselves along and drag the chariot of the sun.' Aside from the fantastic serpentine visions described to manifest from the enchanted smoke, this formula is important due to its inclusion of Saffron (Crocus sativus), a plant appearing in many ancient incense recipes, and also present in many of the aforegoing formulae. Crocus is the genus to which true Saffron belongs, but in ancient recipes 'Crocus' or 'Saffron' often referred to a number of different iridaceous plants, some of which were many times more toxic, such as Meadow Saffron (Colchium autumnale). An incense found in The Leyden Papyrus to summon or reveal a thief, employed powdered Crocus and Alum. An obscure fifteenth-century grimoire entitled The Book of Angels, Rings, Characters, and Images of the Planets employs a Saffron fumigant for conjuring solar genii; it appears in another recipe in Liber Juratus, this one used to \"cause visions in the air and the shadows of sepulchres of the earth to appear.\" Take the naturall seed of the fyshe called a whalle, lingnum aloes, costus, muske saffronne, armoniacum, wt the blude of the foule called a lapwinge, and make a conffeccion therof, wt this sayde conffeccion make a fumigaccion in a"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"conuenient place, and you shall see visyons in the ayer, take of the sayd conffeccion and make a fumygacion aboute the sepulkers and vissions of the dedd shall and wyll appeare...130 Agrippa also lists the most powerful fumigant \"according to Hermes\", which contains one herb for each of the planets, including Saffron to resonate the powers of Venus. Though its aromatic and pigmenting virtues are known, the psychoactivity of C. sativus, when burned, is in debate. However when ingested orally it is considered aphrodisiac, and in excess narcotic. Saffron has also been found in at least one recipe for Witches' Flying Ointment.131 Another ingredient of interest in the Testament of Solomon incense is \"Bulb of the Sea\". While there is some speculation about precisely what plant the demon Beelzeboul is referring to in the text, it is likely Squill (Scilla spp.; Urginea maritima), a hardy plant of the Lily Family widespread in the Mediterranean and having a large, enspissated bulb. The vulgar name by which this plant was most commonly known is Sea Onion. Though traditional use of Squill as a mind-altering plant is not documented, the plant does have a rich magical pedigree for hex-breaking and purification. The bulb of Maritime Squill (.Drimia maritima) was, and still is, affixed to doors as a magical specific against unwelcome visitors and noxious spirits. The ancient Greek ceremony of the Pharmakos, or Scapegoat, involved taking the human victim to the place of sacrifice and fed with figs, cheese, and barley cake; flogged seven 130. Fanger, Claire ed. Conjuring Spirits: Texts andTraditionsofMedieval Ritual Magic, pp. 67-69. The manuscript in question is Cambridge Univ. Lib. MS Dd .xi-45. 131. Hansen, p. 90. The quote is from a 1626 publication by Sir Francis Bacon: \"The ointment that witches use, is reported to be made out of the fat of children digged out of their graves; of the juices of smallage, wolf-bane, and cinquefoil, mingled with the meal of fine wheat. But I suppose, the soporific medicines are likeliest to do it; which are henbane, hemlock, mandrake, moonshade, tobacco, opium, saffron, poplar leaves, etc.\""},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"times on the genitals with Squill; and then burnt on wood gathered from wild trees. The ashes of the victim were later scattered to the winds of the sea. Additionally, the pharmacological profile of Sea Onion is interesting. Urginea maritima contains such cardiac glycosides as scillaren A and B and scillirosid. Mild poisoning results in inflammation and cramping in the gastrointestinal tract; distortions of the vision may also occur, as well as heart irregularity. Though what we know about Squill poisoning usually comes from overdoses when administered orally as a medication, it is plausible that the burning smoke of this plant might contain the same or related poisons. Its linkage with spirit-summoning incenses may also stem from the Levantine folklore associating the plant with graveyards and the spirits of the dead. In considering incense adjuncts of animal origin, mention must also be made of Ambergris or sperma-ceti, an aromatic gastronintestinal secretion of the sperm whale used in the perfume industry, which also appears in grimoric suffumigation formulae. In magic and folk medicine Ambergris is traditionally considered an aphrodisiac, added to food or tonics and worn as a fragrance. Assays of the substance reveal that it contains substantive amounts of cholestanol sterols and the fragrant compound ambrein, recently shown in animal trials to increase arousal and sexual behavior.132 Given the adrenergic effects of sterols, as well as hormonal roles in the physiology of arousal, the volatilization of ambergris via incense likely plays a significant role in the somatic and psychic states during and immediately following suffumigation. 133.

Certainly, a detailed pharmacopoeia of venomous incense plants is a necessary component for the study and mastery of this Art. Chemically, the grimoric incense formulae are complex witches' stews with many botanical ingredients. However, it is necessary to recognize that a great many vectors align to promote their efficacy of fostering a 'bridge of smoke' to the spirit-world. Together with our suffumigation materia magica, all, when approached wisely, provide a deeper understanding of the Censing Art and an elementary patterning for its magical refinement. The rational toxicologist will, according to inclination, focus wholly upon the biochemical constituents of the suffumigation and their physiological effects. Here, the essential question becomes: does the smoke of the burning or smoldering incense ingredients elicit a somatic response consistent with the appearance of demons, angels, gods, spirits of the undead, and their oracular transmissions? Where affirmative, the underlying botanical skeleton of such incenses in the first instance is comprised of ingredients whose psychoactive poisons are active or potentiated when volatilized through the agency of fire or heating. Opium, Henbane, Camphor, Wormwood, Hash-ish and other Cannabis products, all of which are found within grimoiric incenses, are well situated within this category. A second tier of adjuncts includes fragrant arboreal resins such as Frankincense or Juniper, with lesser but established psychoactivity, to assist the trance state and provide aromatic counterbalance to the often foul odor of burning carbonaceous plant materials. Non-psychoactive ingredients include pure aromatics; binders such as Gum Arabic or the organs of certain animals; coloring agents"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"such as Saffron; incendiary or accelerant adjuncts such as charcoal, sulfur, or saltpeter; and smoke-producing agents. Ingredients which are added for their talismanic qualities are also an important category, and there are many ingredients which possess more than one of these properties. Beyond the individual contributions of each suffumigant ingredient, we may also posit unique synergistic interaction between them which gives rise to novel phychophysiological effects. In addition to volatilized psychoactive compounds and aromatics arising from magical incense, the presence of carbon dioxide and monoxide —both toxic and capable of producing dizziness and disorientation— are present in the ritual operation during suffumigation. Carbon dioxide, a lethal poison to animal life in surprisingly low proportions to Oxygen, has also been used as a therapeutic drug, anaesthetic, and as a psychoactive to deliberately alter consciousness. The hypoxia induced by autoerotic asphyxiation, when it does not result in death, is one such use, attributable to mounting levels of CO2 in the blood and the endorphin release associated with orgasm. States of terror and panic, also common during the conjuration of certain spirits, are part of an initial physiological reflex to carbon dioxide intoxication, as Pendell notes.133 The prophecy-inducing vapors of the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, described as emanating from a telluric chasm during certain periods of its ancient use, have recently been proposed by science as a mixture of CO2 and H2S, periodically released during fault rupture.134 Characteristic 133.

In assessing the efficacy of spirit-summoning incenses, consideration must also be given to the locus of the magical operation. Certain grimoire images illustrate operations of magical conjuration situated out of doors, in graveyards, ruins, forests, or remote places. But such manuals of sorcery were disseminated through a kind of magical underground, and spirit summoning operations during the age of grimoires were often illegal and carried real consequences. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a great many of these rites were carried out inside buildings, parlours, churches, or enclosed crypts, where the incense fumes would rapidly increase and concentrate, rather than be dispersed in the open air. The same principle is operative in the Native American purification rite of the sweat lodge, and has led to unintended fatalities when the rite has been appropriated outside traditional culture. An historical imagining of grimoric spirit conjurations must also consider contemporary understanding of spirit-natures and their relation to the influence of air, odors, and vapors. Written spirit-conjuration rites, as a magical genre, have in varied eras portrayed the entities as composed of fire and smoke, of amorphous or partially congealed shape, a face or torso suddenly manifesting from a churning brume. In other instances, conjured spirits are described as the smoke or fire itself, a morphology similar to that of the Hebrew god Yahweh, variously portrayed as formed of smoke, fire, or cloud.135 This fulminant guise, in terms of the appearance of the divine spirit, is similar in many respects to the Jinn of Arabian and Islamic lore, considered angelic or diabolic beings depending on spirit and context. 135.

More relevant to the operations of grimoiric conjuring, is John Dee's Compendium Heptarchiae Mysticae of 1588, a record of his angelic spirit summoning. The work contains physical descriptions of some of the entities summoned, several of which appear as amorphous wisps of vapor. One of these is Princeps Bralges, who \"to my seer appeared like little smokes, with out any forme\"; another group of spirits were the 42 ministers of the spirit Bynepor, who were \"like ghostes or smokes without all forme having every one of them a little glittering spark of fyre in the middest of them: and every spark a letter in it.\" We must also consider that in ecstatic rites the human soul itself is frequently beheld as a vapor, as with the egress of the souls of the night-walking benandanti in the form of smoke, and the well-known passages of witches up chimneys and through locks.136 The votive, offertory aspect of the suffumigant as food for the spirits, or a vehicle for conveying the numen of prayer and adoration must also be considered as a portion of the art. The notion that censing perfumes are irresistible to spirituous entities permeates both religious and magical usages of incense. In the European grimoire corpus, this phenomenon is perhaps best illustrated in the grimoireylre Almadel.

However, as is often the case in the magical art of scrying, one value of the vapor cloud lies in its simultaneous opacity, monochromatic hue, and fluidity of form, which under precise ritual conditions could congeal or harden into a fixed form before the eyes of the operator. This admixture of physical virtues is essential for the ancient magical disciplines of capnomancy and libanomancy (divination by smoke) and aeromancy (divination by clouds).137 The inquisitor Pierre deLancre reported that one method by which the Basque witches could travel to the Sabbath was to emit through their mouths a certain thick steam in which they see all that happens there, as if they are seeing in a mirror.13S In medieval magic, air, and in particular vapors and odors, were acknowledged carriers of power, for good or ill. Agrippa was precise on the matter of good and bad odors and their magical jurisdiction. Deferring to the \"opinion of magicians\", he states: In every good matter, as love, goodwill, and the like, there must be a good fume, odoriferous and precious; and in every evil matter, as hatred, anger, misery, and the like, there must be a stinking fume, that is of no worth. The early corpus of Christian demonological literature played also some part in this: the early church father Justin Martyr, relates that demons oppress mankind partly with magic, partly with fear and punishment, partly with the discipline 137. Agrippa: 'The like things reports Dion in his Roman History, in a place which they call the Nymphs: where frankincense being cast into the flames, oracles were revived concerning all those things which he did desire to know, especially concerning death, and those things which belonged to marriages.\" 138.

Felix Hammerlin (1389-1460), a church authority at the Council of Brasle, wrote in his Dialogus de Nobilitate et Rusticitate, that women \"boil in a pot foul and venomous herbs and things, and then upon exposing it to the rays of the sun a vapour arises to the second region of the air and condenses into clouds which send down hail and tempests.\" Though such descriptions may or may not be viewed as \"witch-hunt propaganda\", it clearly reveals a complex cartography of vapor belief, as well as notion of a prototypal grimoric fumigant. Considering these perceptions of the appearance of spirits we see a cosmology in which air is not only responsible for the transmission of evil and good, but also for the generation of demons and angels: it is the very stuff whereof they are composed. Thus is conveyed the notion that the powers of these entities, as manifest through air, are inherent in both material and action, force and form. Angelic and demonic entities were also thought to be formed of fire. Air and fire are both necessary in the action of suffumigation: fire to ignite and transform the perfume, air to distribute the smoke and nourish the flame. An historical user of grimoiric magic whose cosmology included these concepts would probably regard a suf-fumigant as a material base allowing greater ease for the manifestation of a spirit. This belief combined with prolonged chanting, praying, and circumambulation, could easily potentiate an incense comprised of psychoactive plants and contribute to the sorcerous experience of congress with spirits.

The perfumed aromatic, accessing a favorable stratum of magical correspondence, builds and multiplies a refractory ambience which is an extension of the enchanted circle itself.

This stance is in direct contrast to a strongly materialist occultism: its audacity often offends the book-learned, but the force of its appearance, conviction and efficacy remains. When such adepts are asked about this approach, one frequent response is that the Great Temple lies within, and that all external objects are mere encumbrances or distractions. For some it is an act of humility before the spirit-world; for others a transgressive state, overturning societal norms of modesty and property ownership. Whether it be the night-frolicking revelers of the medieval Witches' Sabbath, the ash-smeared Aghori, or the Transylvanian maidens dancing nude before the Mandragora, the unadorned sorcerer is a potent image of power and communion with the spirits. In obscure magical tributaries of witchcraft praxis, this concept is known as the Edenic Body, the concept of 'the Garden Within' —a state of primordial power, its bowers bearing the strangest and most potent of fruits— before the imposition of exterior 'garb'. It posits the body as an arena of sorcerous power, a series of magically-attuned instruments and zones of numen capable of generating ecstasy, receiving occult knowledge, and performing miracles.

Metaphysical extrapolations on the Green Primordium abound in such Gnostic scriptures as Apocalypse of Adam, and non-canonical gospels such as The Life of Adam and Eve. Similar magical books of alleged Edenic origin are extant, such as the medieval kabbailstic text SeferRazielHaMalakh, said to have been revealed to Adam by the angel Raziel. John Dee, arguably one of the most important figures in western magical traditions, during his spirit-discourse with the angel Uriel, is taught the Edenic and pre-Adamitic origin of a magical book in his possession, the Book ofSoyga.I41 In the teachings of Sabbatic Witchcraft, the Edenic concept of the Primordial Body is closely linked with the metaphysics of poison, chiefly as a dispensation of the rebel angel Samael. However, instead of focusing upon this transmission as the source of the 'Original Sin' or 'Fall' of mankind, it is seen as the primordial Initiation, an Ascent of the status of humanity or 'Raising' to an angelic or deific state. Such a state is implied in the orthodox concept of 'Knowledge of Good and Evil', but within occult traditions, 'Knowledge' is often a cipher for hidden power, conveyed of spirit to an elite body of initiates. In Traditional Witchcraft, one may interpret such Knowledge as the Power of Healing, and the Power of Harming, an ethos which has been called 'Crooked Path Sorcery' because of its 140.

Additionally, the estate of'opening the eyes' of Adam and Eve is considered cognate with the attenuation of bodily centers to newly-ingressed witch-power. The hypostasis of Adam in this all-realised state is known in the Sabbatic Tradition as Malachadamas, 'Kingly Man', also called the 'Trimorphic Attainer' who commands his uncreated, present-plenary, and all-potential states.142 The station bears certain similarities to the kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon or 'Original Man'. This transmission of power originates with Samael, the transgressive Serpent-Angel and tempter offering poison unto First Woman. Indeed, the Hebrew name Samael may be translated \"poison of God\" or \"venom of God\". The name is also ascribed a Syrian origin in Shemal (meaning \"Left\"), the God of the Sabaeans sometimes identified as the prince of demons or djinn. In some ancient esoteric doctrines this angel incepted the growth of the very tree of Eden's heart, for he 'Planted the Vine which caused Adam to stray'.143 In other kabbalistic lore, Samael forms a conjugal union with Lilith, also a patroness of witches in some traditions, and further linking him with a bodily —in this case sexual— transmission of power.144 The Serpent-Angel remains, in some angelic hierarchies, a servant of the High God; although he acts to seduce humankind or lead them astray, the implication being that poison and deceit, if not holy in themselves, at least operate under divine authority. Whether the Fruit he proffered was itself poison, or whether it became infected, the scriptures do not agree upon; in some legends Samael 'injected' his venom into the fruit of the Tree. 142.

Ibn Wahshiya's Book on Poisons describes the production of a lethal compound beginning with the confinement of a mouse and scorpion inside a brazen vessel. After the creatures expire from mutual attack, the corpse of the rodent serves as the base matter of the developing venom, fermented in a leaden vessel with spurge,145 opopanax, mustard, aloe and saffron. This principle also participates as an evolutionary strategy in the botanical world, as in such plants as the semi-parasitic Mistletoe, whose medicinal virtues result from the age of the plant as well as the peculiar phytochemical symbiosis shared with its host. Depending on the nature of its therapeutic use, the most potent Mistletoe may be found growing on Rowan, Apple, Oak, Hawthorn, or, indeed, and of a number of other sylvan hosts. Though semi-parasitic in nature, the mature mistletoe, when harvested for its magico-pharmacological usage, is as much a radiance of its wedded host as any singular virtue on its own. Similarly, certain poisons, when distilled through the Alembic of Man and Woman, may be potentiated in the humours of the body, and magically expressed therein. These operations may take place on the gross chemical level, as with the distillation of the Fly Agaric or Psilocybin mushrooms, whose visionary compounds pass into the urine, largely scrubbed of other poisons by the liver. Under the precise physiological parameters of magico-sexual operations, this potentiation may also occur with astral poisons and nectars, which form the principal elixirs of the Corporeal Laboratory.

Zones of occult power residing in bodily centers have been mapped extensively in the esoteric matrices of mystical and magical systems, as with the Tantric chakras of Hinduism and Bon. More recently occult cartography has included the points chauds or 'hot points' of the Voudon Gnosis system of Michael Bertiaux, which importantly assign both power and sentience to these foci.146 Traditional Witchcraft, especially the forms giving rise to the Sabbatic Current, also contains a unique Cartography of the Flesh. Some of these bodily zones of witch-power possess hypercorporeal attributes which may be extended into the magical realm, one term for this being 'Assumption of the New Flesh'. Mysteries of these fleshly zones of power have been re-presented in Andrew Chumbley's Azoetia, in particular the organ of the Eye.147 Certain oral teachings of Traditional Witchcraft also appertain a kind ofArs Memoria correlating magical powers to objects such as stones, trees, animals, or physical loci. These imbedded teachings find precise locations in the physical body and may be physically manipulated to express their magical potentials.

In spell-craft they assume the First Matter of the Living Fetish. In the witch-cult, a traditional form of atavistic resonance lies in the magical embodiment of the Serpent-Angel Samael. Allied praxes venerate a preparation called 'The Serpent's Graal' — a draught prepared according to two essential formulations. The Lunar Cup, being the production of a sorcerous atavistic emanation, is vinted from the sexual emission of Eve and the Serpent, and prepared in accordance with the strictures of the Agapae.148 The Solar cup makes use of Mandragora, the Mandrake or 'Man-Dragon' allied to the notion of the Embodied Serpent.

More recently, scientific research has identified withanolides and sterols present in Mandragora ojficinarum, a species which has also amassed a considerable amount of aphrodisiac lore.150 Curiously, many of the tabus surrounding the magical usage of Mandrake fetishes demand a kind of marital, or consort relationship between the fetish and the operator, in which one pledges body and soul to the Root. Affirmation of the Pact through adoration of the fetish brings power, but neglect brings absolute ruin. One of the largest and most diverse collections of Mandrake fetishes presently resides in the Richel-Eldermans collection in the Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle. Providing evidence for a continuation of archaic traditional Mandrake sorcery into the twentieth century, the collection was, until recently, the privately-held magical cache of several obscure European magical orders. These carved figures are often accompanied by a specialized coffin for their interment and a number of the effigies appear to have been regularly anointed with votive offerings of blood, and likely sexual fluids as well.

One image from the collection, showing male and female Mandragora plants, not only hypostasizes the plant into sexualized bodies but also suggests, by its symbolism, a connubium of the male and female essences, united by or within an object which appears to be a flask, cauldron, or alchemical vessel (Fig 21). The 'embodied magical' and 'sexual' arcanae of the Mandrake are potentiated when one considers the lore of the plant's genesis in the ejaculate of the gallows-corpse, a mystery which is also represented graphically in the Richel collection. This conjures to mind the Latin phrase Semen profusam Diabolo dicant, \"Dedicate the spilled semen to the Devil\" —a motto of the witch-cult concealing a specific Eucharistic formula of magia sexualis. Further, my own personal work with the Mandrake as a prepared ritual sacrament has yielded a strict protocol of prepration and administration which results in an ecstatic profile that is highly somatic. Skilfully prepared, its phases of action upon the bodily centers of power are at once aphrodisiac and illuminant, stimulant and hypnotic. This combination of mechanisms is difficult to attain with any single plant, and, for that matter, in the realm of synthetics or prescribed psychotropic medications. At once one receives and transmits power through the agency of the body, both modalties simultaneous to each other, and mutually pleas-urable.

In the Edenic prohibition \"Ihou shalt not eat', some have glimpsed a cipher for veiling the Mysteries from the eyes of the profane, whilst others regard it as the 'fall' of the Demiurge himself, conquered by the insecurity of an initiated estate in his own creations. One often-made criticism of modern drug prohibition is that it is driven by fear of gnostic revelation or knowledge arising from bodily ecstasy, and the consequent shattering of state or religion-enforced paradigms. Though the phenomenon of drug prohibition transects cultures and is far too complex to be pinioned with a single motive, one must wonder if the same fears lie at the root of state repressions of sexual freedom and expression.

Hormones and steroids, whether calibrated internally through magical technique, or the result of medical therapeutic, may function as a euphoric or dysphoric poison, the former linked with arousal and desire brought to consummation, and the latter from unrequited arousal. At overdose, physicality begins to eclipse both morality and propriety, though an otherworldly dissociative state may also result. This is borne out by a reflective 1998 entry from Hypnotikon, after an overdose of intramuscular prednisone, given by a medical doctor for a back injury direct at the inflammation site: The intersection between love and war, so holy among the ancient gods, is borne out in the glands, where the flesh is animated by a 'wordless language'.

Where deformities are hereditary, such may have been explained in ancient times as a curse upon a particular bloodline, its first emanation from an evil god or witch. Yet, poison's aspect of the Other, or the estate beyond the self, also is implied by the monstrous, as noted by Martin Ruland in his Lexicon of Alchemy. Monsters are certain animals which have been originated outside the order of nature, and which heaven hatches in the egg of their putrefaction. The fruit of an unlawful and accursed copulation.

Such horrors notwithstanding, I have often found that the counterpoison to the sorcerer's 'dwelling in fierce places' is a life of sustained emotional balance, driven by a passion, or love, of the Art Magical itself as one's spiritual consort. Aleister Crowley, himself no stranger to the use of magical poisons, was precise about this: The danger of ceremonial magick — the subtlest and deepest danger — is this: that the magician will naturally tend to invoke that partial being which most strongly appeals to him, so that his natural excess in that direction will be still further exaggerated. Let him, before beginning his Work, endeavour to map out his own being, and arrange his invocations in such a way as to redress the balance.155 The Master Therion's admonition of a personal cartography as a necessary prerequisite to the Art Magical locates the dictum firmly within the dominion of the Magical Body, emphasizing a core Thelemic principle of self-responsibility. The practice of taking stock of one's aetheric body also resonates with the witchcraft Formula of Opposition, one function of which is self-balance and astral homeostasis as the proper vessel for the ingress of power.

This salve, sometimes referred to as 'Lifting Balm' or the Unguentum Sabbati, occupies a fecund mythic stratum of the occult lore of Old Europe; it has provided a speculative basis, based largely in theories of ceremonial intoxication, attempting to explain the flight of the witches. Fragmentary and speculative formulae from historical sources include the most potent plant poisons in the European pharmacopeia. The ointment, by custom prepared or provided by the Devil himself, assists the witch in her nocturnal flight to the Sabbath. According to varied reports, the flight is accompanied by otherworldly apparitions, and often includes a series of ritual events corresponding to the features of the Witches Sabbath. Visions encountered by those under influence of the ointment include Ravens, Owls, Bats and other nocturnal creatures; demons, desert wastes, prisons and torments; as well as pleasure-gardens, banquets, jewels, finery, and handsome young men and women.158 Interpreting traditional or alleged formulae from early modern European sources, as well as extrapolating historical fragmenta, a considerable number of recipes were developed and tested during our investigation.

The Ley den Papyrus contains formulae for a considerable number of magical salves, many for the purpose of seeing a god or goddess during invocation; and others used for divination. Still others are intended to provoke the lust of man or woman. A magical ointment for seeing the Bark of Phre appears in the Leyden Papyrus, containing such ingredients as ground lapis lazuli, myrrh, \"Great of Amen plant\", blood of hoopoe, blood of nightjar, goat's tear, \"Footprint of Isis plant\", and Ebony wood.165 Oleaginous preparations were also frequently prescribed for anointing mirrors and other reflective surfaces for scrying operations in which discarnate images were captured in their surfaces. One such mirror, the Mirror of Floron, is found in the 15th century Bavarian Munich Handbook. It is constructed of gleaming steel and smeared with \"pure and bright balsam\" prior to use.166 A similar usage seems to have been associated with with Sadyngstone, abbot of Leicester, in 1440.167 In the British Isles, there are records of magical ointments for the eyes compounded of four-leaved clovers.

In certain regions of India, ointments containing lampblack are smeared on the eyelids to protect against the Evil Eye, or to frighten away noxious spirits. The diffusion of Eurpoean ointment-based sorcery into the Americas often found a willing consort in endemic magical practices and a poison-rich flora. In the folk magic of Virginia, an ointment made from Foxglove and Rattlesnake oil was prepared to rid the effects of being blasted.170 Considering the ointment from a pharmacological perspective, the existence of an hallucinogenic or ecstasy-generating salve is both possible and probable.

At the time of my early research into these matters, use of a concentrated Oil of Aconite for a foot injury led me to investigate greater levels of application beyond analgesia; with edifying results.

The late medieval physician Johannes Hartlieb is credited as providing the first written description of the witches' flying ointment.172 He speaks of the unguentum pharelis, an ointment compounded of seven plants, blood of a bird and animal fat. This was used to anoint chairs and other objects upon which sorcerers would ride.173 Six years before Hartlieb's description, another ointment recipe associated with the Witches' Sabbath appeared in the tractate Errores Gazariorum seu Illorum qui Scobam vel Baculum Equitare Probantur, penned by an anonymous inquisitor.

This ointment is situated amidst one of the most noxious and scandalous descriptions of the Sabbath, including repeated diabolic uses of the intestines of children.174 Describing the ointment in a form which is closer to the modern understanding of it, the Franciscan jurist Alonso de Castro wrote: There are certain oyles and oyntments with which they anoynt themselves, which deprive them of their right sense, making them imagine they are transformed into birds or beasts, deceiving not only themselves with this error, but oftentimes the eyes of other, for the devil and other enchanters so deceive our sight, turning and transforming men into beasts to the seeming of those which behold them, though in truth it was nothing so, but the sorcerers think themselves in their imagination to be transposed. Sometimes they anoynt themselves with other oyntments whose operation maketh them think they are like fowls and can fly into the air.175 This reference takes a skeptical approach to the witch's power, portraying the ointment as an agent of delusion, a stance functionally resembling that of the Natural Magician. The passage is important as it documents the Ointment as a known phenomenon, even as it is repudiated as a mundane influence.

He suddenly found himself under a huge nut tree in Beneventum with a large assemblage of witches carousing. He did as they did until he called for some salt, which is very repugnant to the devil... at the mention of the sacred name, the whole assemblage vanished, and he found himself lying naked 100 miles from home.

Actual use of a mind-altering ointment in the context of European witchcraft is controversial among historians. Certain scholars of the history of European witch-persecution have taken a skeptical or dismissive position with regard to the existence or use of the Ointment177, whilst other writers, mainly in the sphere of'entheogenic research' treat it as a historical certainty178. Both positions, as well as 176. Behringer, Shaman of Oberstdorf, pp. 93-4. 177. See, for example, Briggs, Witches and Neighbours, p. 56; Henningsen, The Witches' Advocate, p. 391. 178.

What is certain is that, as has been shown, a large body of lore exists concerning this ointment, in both the written historical record and in the popular imagination. The fascination it has exerted over practitioners of folk magic, themselves the keepers of occult records and oral teachings, has persisted for centuries. Rural magical practice participates in its own body of lore and custom with an investment of legitimacy equal to or greater than what exists in the written record, a verbally transmitted 'cult of ancestors' which, despite their status as 'ideas', act and behave in the context of magical practice as informing spirits. As such, custom and lore represent a complex magical cipher which, when rooted in the flesh of the initiate, offers private revelatory dimensions specific to the individual path. The relevant question may not concern actual historical existence of a psychoactive ointment, but whether or not it was used in the context of that popular magic coming under the lens of the authorities as 'witchcraft'. Though most modern research into the Sabbatic Ointment plumbs legal and inquisitorial literature of the witchcraft persecutions, its presence outside this context, such as abides in collections of folklore or contemporary histories, indicates that it was clearly an important topos present in European magic. Folklore of Belorussia and the Ukraine relays that naked witches flew up chimneys, naked and covered with ointment, on broomsticks or pokers, and onward to a Shabash on Bald Mountain near Kiev. The flight was aided by an asperge of water boiled with ashes from the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"midsummer fires, or an ointment made from Gentian.179 In at least one case, an accused witch mentioned a magical ointment provided by the Devil at the Sabbat, not for flying, nor as an inversion of Christian ritual, but to heal the wounds on the back of a celebrant recently whipped with branches of thorn-bearing Crataegus.190 In the course of our experiments, formulations of the salve differed, but method of application and ritual procedures were similar, even as they evolved over time. There was also present, in each case, the so-called 'Watchful Companion', a participant not anointed or in an otherwise compromised physical state. This feature of our work was at my insistence, knowing the treacherous nature of solanaceous alkaloids, but also for the benefit of dual perspective on Anointing events. The resulting data collated over many operations afforded a rich diversity of perspectives from practitioners with widely varying sensitivities and constitutions. In addition to more 'traditional' formulations, salves were also compounded of plants presenting lesser toxic hazard. When tested, many provided edifying results. For example, the role of aromatic features, not suspected before the work began, was essential in forming 'Ground State Calibration'. When a certain olfactory key, such as Atttar of Rose or Oil of Rosemary, was provided before the anointing proper, it could be used for a 'sensorial return' or 'grounding' at the appropriate time, much like a hypntoic cue, and became a vaulable part of the procedures. 179.

In the experiments, ritual anointing included massage or rubefaction, with especial attention to the feet, genitals, palms, neck, and scalp. The more intrepid participants in the cabal used the highly toxic and concentrated salves as sexual lubricants, an action which violated ritual protocol and put their physical well-being at risk. Results of these formulations via this route ranged from mild stimulation to a partially dissociative somatic ecstasy which mirrored in some respects the alleged features of the witches' nocturnal flight. Though this route of administration makes certain alkaloids more physiologically bioavailable, it is also highly dangerous. This evokes the related practice of 'keistering', whereby a psychoactive drug is inserted anally or in some cases vaginally, which has ancient antecedents.186 It is also of interest to note that usage of our prepared ointments in sexual or magico-sexual contexts gave rise to unique instances of enhanced tactility. Whilst these experiences in no way resembled flight, it would be fair to report an expansion and elevation of the sensorium falling under the general categories of a stimulant and exhilarant. Given that this strata of salves employed Mugwort, their energetic dispensation was reminiscent of reports of an Aztec ointment made from a Mexican Wormwood species, Artemisia mexicana, and listed as a \"Remedy for Lassitude\" 185.

More intimately and to the point, the Kama Sutra contains a number of magical ointments, some of which feature the same poisonous plants of the nightshade family associated with the European witch-salve. One such preparation, employed to bewitch a woman, anoints the linga with a mixture of ground Thorn Apple seeds and honey. When the man goes to her, she will be \"caught in his power\". One obstacle in approaching the matter of the Unguentum Sabbaticum arises in the common assumption that psychoactivity is the function of a singular cause and effect. To those who research the Ointment, especially from the historical perspective of examining extant written records, it quickly becomes apparent that we are accessing the corpse of a magical tradition, and an incomplete one at that. Names of plants differ, or are sometimes imprecise, proportions vary (if given at all), and a number of ingredients appear which the pharmacologically-inclined tend to dismiss as \"sympathetic magic\". In a presentation given on the subject in 2007,1 asserted that one of the greatest barriers to understanding the witches' ointment is the occlusion generated by a purely ethnopharmacological perspective.187 The same is true in consideration of anthropological or micro-historical inquiry. These limited approaches become even more unreliable considering the challenges presented by the secret nature of magical practice and the toxicity of the plants involved. Until the needful perspective of the magical practitioner is considered and applied as a lens to the matter, and from multiple angles, holistic comprehension of the subject will be elusive. This added perspective necessarily includes an adjunctive field of supportive magical praxes, nuances of intent, lore and conceptions of 187.

The importance of this latter consideration is underscored in a statement by Eva Pocs, whose career has focused on supernatural belief in early modern Europe, including witchcraft: The subject of flying ointment occasionally came up in Hungarian interrogations; nonetheless, it played no real role in precipitating trance. In our trials, no evidence underpins the assumption of some European research that witches, including Hungarian witches, made journeys with the help of drugs. Documents referring to altered states of consciousness clearly talk about spontaneous trance. References to flying ointment are generally traceable only in responses given to questions of the court, and even then principally in confessions following torture. Flying ointment appears in the narratives as a metaphor for creating trance, in the context of flying with wings - that is, \"really\" flying - or in the legendary motif of turning into an animal.188 'Non-pharmacological' routes of spirit flight, many involving ritual induction of trance, are also documented contemporary with reports of ointment usage. A particularly interesting example is reported from the Charovnik, an old Russian book of spells no longer extant. The text gave instructions on 'how to leave your body as if as if dead and fly like an eagle or a hawk or a crow or a magpie or an owl, or run like a panther, a savage beast, a wild beast, a wolf or a bear, or fly like a serpent.'

However, because of the status of the psychoactive unguent as imbedded within a magical context, 'set' of necessity encompasses magical intent, protocol and tabu, and attachment to outcome. Elements of 'setting' include such adjunctive ritual techniques as bathing the body to open pores of the skin, the better to facilitate absorption; massage or rubefaction, for increasing circulation; movement or sexual activity, breathing exercises, withdrawal and isolation. Finally, perhaps the greatest consideration of setting is the virtues and character of the plants themselves, either singly, or as a magically-bound troop fixed within an oily base. This leads us to consider the nature of the so-called 'Hexing Herbs', and particuarly solanaceous intoxication. One characteristic of tropane inebriation is a distortion of time, not only in its perception by the user, but also shifts in temporality itself as an embodied feature of the narcotic Sabbat. The procession of Time, its acceleration, deceleration, fragmentation, and defining effect upon the visionary arena, is often as important as the interplay with the spirits themselves. This bears obvious corollaries with 'Fairy Time' in Brythonic lore, wherein humans abducted into the realm of Faerie attend a great feast in the subterranean halls of Elphame, only to discover upon their return to the world of men that many years have passed, as with the legend of King Herla.

This is dramatically illustrated by a tale recounted to me by a fellow practitioner some years ago, who at the age of 12 consumed an excess of Datura stramonium seeds. After a harrowing three days of navigating a wasteland filled with walking corpses, he seemed at last to gain waking respite near a sunny meadow, becoming aware of the sober individuals who had been his caretakers during his break with reality. His gaze shifted to a grassy swale, wherein he glimpsed a flittering. Amid the reeds a watchful satyr stood, observing him intently. Maintaining his gaze, the silen slowly raised what appeared to be a police radio to his lips and whispered into it: \"Affirmative. We have one who sees.\"191 During the years in which the ointment research took place, I collected several first-hand reports of western travellers in Indonesia who were drugged by thieves. This occurred to such an extent, with such consistency of symptoms, that it in a short time it became a known phenomenon to be vigilant for among wayfarers. In all cases I collected, of greater personal horror to the victim than the crime itself was the state of waking catatonia brought on by the drug, combined with fear, motor paralysis, and monstrous hallucination, followed by blackout.

Tropane narcosis easily conforms to the 1507 description of the witches ointment by Alfonso Tostado, in his Super Genesis Commentaria: there are women who we call maleficae in Spain who say that with an ointment and certain conjurations they are carried to distant places where there are assemblies and enjoy all kinds of pleasure. But this is an error, and has been found by their falling into a stupor, insensible to blows and fire, and on awaking in a few hours relating where they have been and what they have seen and done. Tropane alkaloids have strong dissociative effects, as well as a platform of other strong narcotic phenomena, which can also lead to death. Whilst dosage is clearly a factor, individual body chemistry and psychology are strongly suspected as contributing to the degree of intoxication. Tales such as I have relayed represent the testimonies of the lucky, who were not only able to survive physically, but also recover memories of it. Such accounts, their grotesquerie notwithstanding, present an amalgam of the daimonic and the projections of the mind. One the one hand, the settings and language expressed are modern, but on the other, the presence of satyri and kindred demonic forms participates in the well-known solanaceous generation of phantasmagoria, an essential component of the iconology of European witchcraft.
