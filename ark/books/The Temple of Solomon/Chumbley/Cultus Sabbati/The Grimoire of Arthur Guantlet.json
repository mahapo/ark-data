The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet David Rankine is an esoteric researcher and occult author who first started exploring the practices and history of the Western Esoteric Traditions in the 1970s. His work has contributed towards a resurgence in the interest in medieval and renaissance grimoires in the 21st century. Through works such as The Veritable Key of Solomon and other books in the Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magic series with Stephen Skinner, his work has significantly furthered the corpus of primary texts available to students of the grimoires. His work with Sorita d'Este, including books such as Hekate Liminal Rites and The Cosmic Shekinah, have brought him recognition for his work in mythology, mysticism and magic around the world. David lives in Wales, near the internationally reknowned town-of-books Hay on Wye in the United Kingdom.

London was growing rapidly at this time, with a population of around a quarter of a million people in 1600, just over 6% of the English population of around four million. This rapid growth in population was mirrored by the increase in magical texts being made available in both manuscript and printed form.1 At this time England was a political powder-keg, with ongoing disputes between King Charles I and Parliament. In 1629, Charles I dissolved Parliament and ruled without a government for eleven years, an act known alternatively as The Personal Rule or The Eleven Years Tyranny. During this period medicine was still in its infancy and had not fully divorced itself from magic, with barber surgeons competing with cunning-folk for custom. Major medical authorities drawn upon by seventeenth century physicians and surgeons included charms in their writings, as can be seen in the works of figures such as Gilbertus Anglicus (thirteenth century), John Gaddesden and John Ardeme (fourteenth century), and Thomas Fayreford (fifteenth century).2 Conversely, sixteenth and seventeenth century 1 E.g. the 1650s saw the first English editions of Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy (1651) and Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy (1655), Paracelsus' Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature (1656), Ars Notoria (1657), Fama Fraternitas (1652), Causabon's True and Faithful Relation (1659), Kircher's Oedipus Aegypticus, and the second expanded edition of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft. More than a quarter of the known Key of Solomon MSS date to this period (33/124). 2 See e.g. Sloane MS 56, Sloane MS 1067, Additional MS 33996, Harley MS 2558."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet magical texts3 often contained instructions for conjurations and charms to assist in the practice of 'physick' (medicine). Such texts were often sought and used by cunning-folk, men and women who provided a range of magical services to anyone who paid them. Such services included a wide range of possibilities including healing people and farm animals, recovering lost or stolen goods, protection from witches, curses and evil spirits; gaining love, and locating hidden treasure. To achieve such diverse results, cunning-men and women drew on numerous techniques and sources, often creating books of practice of charms and conjurations they found effective. The Witchcraft Act of 1604 introduced by King James I (1566-1625), had been aimed at cunning-folk as well as witches, and covered such deeds as, \"Witchcrafte Inchantment Charme or Sorcerie to tell or declare in what place any treasure of Golde or silver should or had in the earth or other secret places, or where Goodes or Thinges loste or stollen should be founde or become; or to the intent to P[ro]voke any person to unlawfulllove. \"4 However the Witchcraft Act was largely ignored in many parts of England, particularly the capital. Davies (2003:17) observes that \"The ecclesiastical courts in London, a city that abounded with magical practitioners, were apparently the earliest to lose interest in cunning-folk and popular magic, with hardly any relevant cases after 1600. \"5 England was largely Protestant, with a degree of intellectual suspicion expressed by contemporary writers such as John Melton in his famous work Astrologater (1620) towards magical conjuration \"with its hallowing, fumigations and consecrations, was strongly reminiscent of the Roman Mass. \"6 It is during this period that the Sloane MS 3851 manuscript, the cunning-man Arthur Gauntlet's book of practice, which forms the corpus of this book was written. It probably dates to the 1620s or early 1630s, as the evidence I will present demonstrates. 3 In this context text refers to both grimoires and books of secrets. 4 Witchcraft and Society in England and America, 1550-1750, Gibson, 2003:5-7. 5 Cunning-Folk: Popular Magic in English History, Davies, 2003:17. 6 Religion and the Decline of Magic, Thomas, 1971:319. 8 The G rillllllliiM Arthur Gauntlet & Sanl!

The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Arthur Gauntlet & Sarah Skelhom The only known published literary reference to Arthur Gauntlet was by the famous astrologer William Lilly (1602-1681) in his autobiography, written around 1668.7 The quote from Lilly provides some significant peripheral information which can help us create at least a sketchy picture of Arthur Gauntlet. \"I was very familiar with one Sarah Skelhorn, who had been Speculatrix unto one Arthur Gauntlet about Gray's Inn Lane,8 a very lewd fellow, professing physick. This Sarah had a perfect sight, and indeed the best eyes for that purpose I ever yet did see. Gauntlet's books, after he was dead, were sold, after I had perused them, to my scholar Humphreys: there were rare notions in them. This Sarah lived a long time, even until her death, with one Mrs. Stockman in the Isle of Purbeck, and died about fifteen years since. \"9 It seems curious that Lilly should describe Sarah Skelhom (called Sarah Shelbome in the introduction) so positively as such a good seer, and yet be negative about Arthur Gauntlet. Lilly's single reference to him as a 'lewd fellow' stands out and labels Gauntlet without allowing any opportunity for defence of his character or further consideration. However it is clear from Lilly's writings that he was quick to denigrate anybody who he felt was not a respectable practitioner of astrology or the magical arts by his standards. I suggest that the fact that Arthur Gauntlet should have such a good speculatrix or seer combined with the heavily angelic and moral nature of Gauntlet's manuscript may mitigate Lilly's unqualified negative remark about his character. Another document would seem to support Lilly's view, until we consider that it was written in 1889, and seems to repeat verbatim Lilly's words, with some embellishment. How accurate this information is must be a matter of speculation. Nevertheless I have included it here to provide all the available information: \"It was so also with Sarah Skelhorn, the speculatrix of Dr Gauntlet of Gray's Inn Lane, a very loose liver. On leaving the Doctor's service Sarah became engaged by Mrs Stockman, with whom she lived in the Isle of 7 \"Wrote by himself in the 66'h year of his Age\", The Life of William Lilly, Davies: 177 4:1. s This street is now called Gray's Inn Road. 9 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:149. 9"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Purbeck until her death, seventeen years later, seeing visions for her mistress and her mother, the Lady Beconsfield. \"10 We can deduce something more about Arthur Gauntlet through another mention of his name, in MS Laud Mise 19. This manuscript contains an early ownership inscription of Arthur Gauntlet, and was in William Laud's possession in 1636. This manuscript includes a \"Treatise, based on and including extracts from Hilton's Scale, describing the way of meditation and the mystical experience\".ll Considering the nature of Walter Hilton's Scale of Perfection offers some revealing insights. Hilton (c.1343-1396) discusses such topics as the form of spiritual visions and how to induce contemplation through meditation, prayer and Scripture. The Scale of Perfection was written as an instructional guide for women who had taken vows or committed to a religious life, and as such may have been of interest to, for example, a female skryer such as Sarah Skelhom. There are some clues in the text which suggest that Arthur Gauntlet was a very capable practitioner, who did not just rely on material from earlier sources, or had access to someone else who was. The magic circles found at fo.l14v-115 have some very interesting features which are not seen in other grimoires, and which would seem to be the result of experience being applied. Thus we see the circles having a larger and more spacious diameter of fourteen foot, not the standard nine foot found in many grimoires drawing on the Heptameron. It is also significant that in light of his conjurations being largely of angels; Gauntlet uses a second smaller circle for the crystal to be positioned in, and for angelic manifestation. The shape of this is in contrast to the constraining triangle used with demons found in the Goetia, or the pentagram used with faeries found in Sloane MS 3824. However a circle would make sense for angels as a perfect shape representing the divine and not seeking to dominate them as one would need to do for demons. Another interesting feature of this manuscript is that the one magical tool emphasised is the wand. There is a consecration of a wand given, as well as charms which require the use of a wand. 10 Current Opinion Vol3, Wheeler & Crane, 1889:153. 11 The Index of Middle English Prose Handlist XVI, Ogilvie-Thomson, 2000:1. 10 The Grilllli Considering the emphasis � suggests a more practical • transportable and inconspiall!

The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Considering the emphasis on the sword in many grimoires, this suggests a more practical and simplified approach with a more transportable and inconspicuous tool. If we make the tentative assumption that MS Laud Mise 19 passed directly from Arthur Gauntlet's hands, being sold on after his death, and that it went directly into William Laud's possession from Gauntlet, then it suggests a date of death around 1636. Now Lilly gives us a death date of 1653 for Sarah Skelhom, writing that she had died 'about sixteen years since' (the publication of his autobiography in 1669) we can place this around 1653. The other reference to Sarah Skelhom reproduced in Current Opinion says she died seventeen years after leaving Gauntlet's service, which would also give a date of 1636 (i.e. 1653-17). Therefore we can suggest that Sarah Skelhom left Gauntlet's service when he died, in 1636. It is noteworthy that after Sarah Skelhom left Arthur Gauntlet's service, she took service with a woman, for whom she would skry into the crystal. As has already been mentioned, from 1636-1653, Sarah lived with Mrs Stockman in the Isle of Purbeck. In his autobiography, Lilly mentions Mrs Stockman asking Sarah to skry for her to determine whether her mother, Lady Beconsfield, was at home, before going to visit her.12 One of the last pieces of information Lilly provides about Sarah Skelhom suggests she was at times irritated with her gift, describing her frustration with seeing angels everywhere she went. Lilly commented that, \"Sarah told me oft, the angels would for some years follow her, and appear in every room of the house, until she was weary of them. \"13 Lilly also describes how Sarah began her skrying practice, continuing with the same for Ellen Evans, daughter of the Welsh astrologer who trained Lilly himself: \"This Sarah Skelhorn, her call unto the crystal began, 'Oh ye good angels, only and only, &c'. Ellen Evans, daughter of my tutor Evans, her call unto the crystal was this: 0 Micol, 0 tu Micol, regina pigmeorum, veni, &c\"14 12 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:150. 13 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:150. 14 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:149. The Latin conjuration, \"0 Micol, 0 you Micol, queen of the pigmies [fairies], come\", contains a name for the Fairy Queen found in Sloane MS 1727, an undated C17th MS. The 11"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet The emphasis on female skryers, as well as women using their services, and the probable ownership of Sloane MS 3851 by Ann Savadge (as I will subsequently demonstrate) places a far greater emphasis on the place of women in magic in the seventeenth century than has previously been credited. William Laud That a book containing spiritual material belonging to Arthur Gauntlet should end up in the hands of William Laud (1573-1645) is very interesting. William Laud was the Bishop of London from 1628-33, and it may be possible that he and Arthur Gauntlet met or even knew each other. This would provide a possible explanation for why Laud should end up with one of Gauntlet's books, particularly considering the religious nature of its contents. By the end of his life Laud had risen to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury. He was beheaded during the English Civil War for his support of King Charles I and his vehement opposition to much of Puritanism, with great exception being taken to some of his ideas which were considered too 'catholic', such as reintroducing stained glass windows and statues, and moving the altar from the middle to the east. Captain Bubb The tangential references to his contemporaries in Lilly's autobiography give us some idea of when Arthur Gauntlet may have been practising magic and physick. Captain Bubb is mentioned by Lilly, and also by Arthur Gauntlet on fo.8v of Sloane MS 3851, so the two were probably acquainted, and may well have been moving in similar circles. After describing the sale of William Hart's books in 1634,15 Lilly went on to describe how \"In Lambeth Marsh at the same time lived one Captain Bubb, who resolved horary questions astrologically; a proper handsome man, well spoken, but withal covetous, and of no honesty''16 possibly derivative name Mycob for the Fairy Queen in found in Sloane MS 3824 (1649). 15 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:36. 16 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:38. 12 The Grillll Lilly specifically identifies E1 for falsehood, which� It seems clear that � Boas (1928:161) notes � [1928], Bertram Lloyd idenljidj of the Inn', v.ii, with a� The Art of Juggling (1614) • fortunes. \"17 ;; The comedy The Fair�\" and had been written by · .. · (1579-1625) and some of his the most popular and � William Shakespeare and CJ!I Juggling and sleight of� magic, so the dedication af.i again emphasises the exteut; The Art of Juggling or � interesting to note that a ,.­material given in Scot's � main published works of \"'il available.

Queen in found in Sloane MS I ! I / The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Lilly specifically identifies Captain Bubb as having been pilloried for falsehood, which enables us to find out more about Bubb. It seems clear that Captain Bubb had influential associates, as Boas (1928:161) notes that \"In Times Literary Supplement 12 Jan [1928], Bertram Lloyd identifies The Juggling Captain in 'The Fair Maid of the Inn', v.ii, with a Captain Bubb to whom S[amuel]. Rid dedicated The Art of Juggling (1614) and who was pilloried in 1618 for telling fortunes. \"17 The comedy The Fair Maid of the Inn was first performed in 1626, and had been written by the famous playwright John Fletcher (1579-1625) and some of his collaborators. John Fletcher was one of the most popular and influential playwrights of his day, along William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. Juggling and sleight of hand have long been associated with magic, so the dedication of a book on juggling to Captain Bubb again emphasises the extent of his connections. The first edition of The Art of Juggling or Legerdemaine was published in 1612, and it is interesting to note that a number of the tricks in it are drawn from material given in Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), one of the main published works of the period which made grimoire material available. In the latter half of the seventeenth century there is a reference to a Captain Bubb in a parliamentary context, as being one \"who also stands for a Member\",18 i.e. acted for a Member of Parliament. John Searle Another person mentioned by Arthur Gauntlet is John Searle, in the heading \"A Prayer to God for good Success in Matters written by John Searle Practitioner in Surgery And in Astronomy Ano 1594:\" (fo.6-7). The combination of prayer with surgery points to a John Searle who was a choirman for a year, and was appointed as a minor canon in Westminster Abbey in 1594, holding this post for ten years.19 17 Elizabethan Drama, Boas, 1928:161. 1s The House of Commons, 1660-1690 Vol 1, p185 19 Westminster Abbey Reformed: 1540-1640, Knighton & Mortimer, 2003:101. 13"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet This was probably the same John Searle who had a licence from Cambridge university in 1607 to practice chirurgery,zo and who published an ephemeris from 1609-1617 with three treatises attached, being (1) on the use of an ephemeris, (2) on the fixed stars and (3) four sections on astrology.21 The early date of the prayer, 1594, suggests the prayer may have been passed on to Gauntlet or circulated amongst his peers. William Bacon An interesting inclusion by Gauntlet is the piece entitled, \"The Roman Secret touching the Spirit called Sathan by which the Romans did understand of things present past and to come: By W. Bacon\" (fo.109v-111). The only other references I have located to William Bacon regarding esoteric matters are the pieces called 'To discover witches', 'To staunch blood' and 'To help one that is bewitched' which are found in Sloane MS 3846 at fo.95v-98; and 'The Experiment of W. Bacon to Destroy Witches' in Bodleian e. Mus 173 at 37v. Both Sloane MS 3851 and Sloane MS 3846 were part of the library of the angel magician Lord Jekyll (see below for more details). When Lord Jekyll died and his huge library was sold, both these manuscripts were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane and formed part of the collection he bequeathed to the British Library. These pieces were probably written by the astrologer William Bacon (1577-1653), whose book A Key to Helmont (published posthumously in 1682), was a work which rejected Paracelsian medicine and promoted the study of chemistry as essential to medicine.ZZ It has been suggested by Klaasen (2011:9) that William Bacon may be a corruption of Roger Bacon (1214-1292), the medieval natural philosopher,23 to whom several texts were attributed, however this seems unlikely to me. Not only are there several pieces in different manuscripts, suggesting the name was not miscopied, but the William Bacon pieces are short pieces (unlike e.g. the Nigromancia attributed to Roger Bacon) which have a certain consistency in their material. Furthermore Roger Bacon's known 20 Surgery. 21 Athenae Cantabrigiensis Vol 2, Gray, 1861:530. 22 The Chemical Philosophy, Debus, 2002:503. 23 Three early magic rituals to spoil witches, Klaasen, 2011, 1.1:9 fn39. 14 I'heG� � emphasised a �� _, of the 11Ulgiad beliefs of� ,.., .Hemy ... because -.. -\"2� .• .... ama..

If this is true then the prayer obviously dates to the late sixteenth or more likely early seventeenth century (pre Dee's death in 1608/9). Dr John Dee (1527-1609) was an astrologer, mathematician, cartographer and magician of huge importance. As Queen Elizabeth I' s astrologer and occasional advisor, he contributed a number of very significant suggestions to the Queen which contributed to the expansion of English power overseas.26 Much of Dee's material was lost, after being hidden in a cabinet he owned. The papers were discovered in 1662, decades after Dee's death, and with the chest having passed through the hands of several owners. Unfortunately the family's maid used about half of the papers for kindling, resulting in the loss of a substantial portion of Dee's magical writings. I will quote the description from Sloane MS 3846 in full, as if this is true it is a very important and significant example of Dee's material which was lost, not being reproduced in any of the known works of Dee: \"fohn a Windor declareth at Newbury in County Court, being once brought before Mr Justice Wallop, & accused for using unlawful arts, among the depositions taken before him, by Mr Oliver Withers his Clark, 24 Roger Bacon: The Father of Experimental Science and Medieval Occultism, Redgrove, 2003:16. 25 The Life of William Lilly, Davies:1774:145. 26 See The Queen's Conjuror, Woolley, 2002 for more information about the life of Dr John Dee. 15"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet there is this following Call, which he said, being once at Dr Dee's house at Mortlake he saw lie in a Window, & which he soever since used. \"27 John a Windor is an interesting character, who Lilly describes as having \"many good parts, but was a most lewd person\".2B Lilly also indicates that Windor was a practising magician; and that because he \"was much given to debauchery, so that at some times the Dcrmons would not appear to the Speculator; he would then suffumigate: sometimes, to vex the spirits, he would curse them, fumigate with contraries.\" The debauchery offending the dremons is indicative of the purity expected for effective conjuration. More significantly the wording indicates that John a Windor was performing conjurations for money, hence the presence of a 'speculator' desiring to see dremons. A contraction of two of the lines was reproduced by Lilly in his autobiography, being, \"Per virtutem illorum qui invocant nomen tuum, Hermeli, mitte nobis tres angelos\". This was later used in novels, including Brambletye House by Horace Smith by an astrologer performing an angelic conjuration;29 and by the character of John Dee himself in Agnes de Mansfelt by Thomas Grattan in 1836.30 Lilly also mentions that Oliver Withers \"brought up a Windor's examination unto London, purposefully for me to peruse\".31 The interconnection of the community of astrologers and magicians of the time is repeatedly emphasised in his autobiography, showing how easily it would have been for material to be transmitted between practitioners. As the example of the prayer in this MS is in Arthur Gantlet's handwriting, this would suggest that either John a Windor made up his story, or that somehow Gauntlet got hold of the prayer from John a Windor, or another person who had copied it from John a Wind or. 27 Sloane MS 3846, fo.l13v. 28 The Life of William Lilly, Davies:1774:145. 29 Brambletye House; or Cavaliers and roundheads, Vol3, Smith, 1826:228. 30 Agnes de Mansfelt: a historical tale, Grattan, 1835:277. 31 The Life of William Lilly, Davies:1774:145-6. 16 The Grillll How old is Sloane .. i:'l It has been su� however a number of�· and that it is somewhat . , next to the word hore ( .. into question. .·· · The number 1696 may 1+6+6+6, with the middle6 .. � be entirely in keeping throughout Sloane MS down 2' s in the Of Perjumtt.f � The first tangible fadm .• be from an earlier date is .... spread throughout Sloane'\"� which immediately p� j back several years.

It has been suggested that Sloane MS 3851 dates to 1696, however a number of factors demonstrate that this is a mis-dating, and that it is somewhat older. The alleged date reference is written next to the word hore ('hour', Latin), which immediately brings it into question. The number 1696 may rather refer to the 19th hour, as 1696 = 1 +6+6+6, with the middle 6 being written upside-down. This would be entirely in keeping with the peculiar numeration found throughout Sloane MS 3851, e.g. 6 being comprised of three upside­down 2's in the Of Perfumes section (fo.l13-114). The first tangible factor that demonstrates the manuscript must be from an earlier date is that Elias Ashmole's handwriting is found spread throughout Sloane MS 3851. Elias Ashmole died in 1692, which immediately pushes the possible date of Sloane MS 3851 back several years. As I will show in the next section, there is material in Sloane MS 3851 which is derived from Folger Vb.26(1), which dates to around 1580. An example of this material derived from Folger Vb.26(1) is seen in fo.130-132, in the conjuration to have conference with familiar spirits, which also includes a group of fairy beings called the seven fairy sisters. The use of these names may help in dating Sloane MS 3851, as it predates the set of names for the seven fairy sisters found in the 1640s in Sloane MS 3825 (1641) and Sloane MS 3824 (c.1649).32 As I have already demonstrated, a provisional date of death of 1636 for Arthur Gauntlet seems likely. Therefore the date of Sloane MS 3851 must be 1636 or earlier. In the same paragraph of his autobiography that he mentions Sarah Skelhorn, Lilly observes that, \"Gauntlet's books, after he was dead, were sold, after I had perused them, to my scholar Humphreys: there were rare notions in them.\" 33 From his other comments, it is clear that Lilly is referring to John Humphreys. Elsewhere in his autobiography Lilly introduces Humphreys, saying, \"In the year 1640 I instructed John Humphreys, master of that art, in the study of astrology\".34 32 These names are Lilia, Rostilia, Foca, Falla, Africa, Julia, Venulla . 33 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:149 .. 34 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:50. 17"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Lilly was again uncomplimentary about Humphreys, describing him as \"a laborious person, vain-glorious, loquacious, fool­hardy, desirous of all secrets which he knew not\".3s However, from the sequence of mentioning the death of Gauntlet and the disposal of his books, followed by writing about the death of Sarah Skelhorn, we can assume this taking possession of the books must have occurred between 1640 and 1653, as Lilly looked at them before Humphreys bought them. We know from the 1614 dedication to Captain Bubb that he may have already been practising astrology and magic. As this is the earliest reference to Captain Bubb, and Arthur Gauntlet refers to one of his charms, it provides a range of 1614-1636 as the likely date of writing of Sloane MS 3851. Of course Sloane MS 3851 contains earlier material from grimoires dating back to at least 1580. Indeed some of the charms existed in earlier forms as far back as the fourteenth century, and obviously became corrupted or mutated with the passing of time. The Material in Sloane MS 3851 from other Grimoires Some of the other material contained in Sloane MS 3851 also needs to be discussed to further set the context and provenance of the material collated by Gauntlet. One consideration which stands out is that the work he translated from other languages is from foreign editions or manuscripts, being noticeably different to the later English editions. Indeed the English editions of the works he collated material from were all published subsequent to Arthur Gauntlet's death. The material drawn from the De Occulta Philosophia of Cornelius Agrippa is a translation from German or Latin and not a reproduction of the English edition which was published in 1651. Likewise the Heptameron and Agrippa's Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy were only published in English in 1655, after Gauntlet's death, and the material included from them has been translated from the original and is noticeably different to the 1655 Turner translation. The version of the Arbatel included by Gauntlet is unique, not only in that it is a different translation to Turner's later published 35 The Life of William Lilly, Davies, 1774:52. 18 The Gn..i version in 1655, but it is the aj diagram of the Seal of� important image.

This suggests that Gauntlet's copy of the Arbatel, irrespective of the omissions and mistakes it contains, was probably derived from a manuscript copy not generally available, and not the first published 1575 Latin edition. The conjuration of Oberion at fo.l15v-116 is clearly derived from the material found in Folger Vb.26(1). As well as having very similar conjurations, Vb.26(1) has two images of Oberion (at fo.185 and fo.186) with the sun and moon on his right and left sides and the names of his four counsellors around him (with their seals), Scorax, Carmelion, Severion and Cabereon. These are the names subsequently used in the conjuration provided by Arthur Gauntlet in Sloane MS 3851. Sloane MS 3846 also includes 'The invocation of Oberion concerning Physick &c' (fo.102v-108), showing another point of commonality between these two Sloane manuscripts. Reading the description of Oberion given in Vb.26(1) it is easy to see why a cunning-man would seek the assistance of the King of the Fairies: \"He appeareth like a king with a crown on his head, he is under the government of the @and �, he teacheth a man knowledge in physick, and he showeth the nature of stones herbs and trees and of all metal. He is a great and mighty king, and he is king of the fairies ... \"36 Indeed we see precedents for the conjuration of Oberion in a court record from 1444 which describes a man being pilloried for summoning a \"wicked spyryte the whyche was callyd Oberycom\".37 A likely precedent to this specific conjuration which also predates Vb.26(1) by many decades was recorded in the Archiepiscopal Register of York in 1510. Here reference was made to a group of treasure-seekers conjuring \"a certain demon, Oberion\" along with 'four others, whereof Storax was one\". Clearly Storax and Scorax are the same, and the three unnamed others can be presumed to be Carmelion, Severion and Cabereon. The group included the former lord mayor of Halifax and the church Canon who owned the grimoire containing the conjuration,38 showing again how both 36 Folger Vb.26(1) fo.80, 1577-1583.

Another instance of material derived from Folger Vb.26(1) is seen in fo.130-132, in the conjuration to have conference with familiar spirits, which also includes the seven fairy sisters. A slightly corrupted version of the conjuration from Arthur Gauntlet is found in A Collection of Magical Secrets (Wellcome MS 4669), a text which dates to 1796 and was bound in with a copy of the Key of Solomon.39 In this text the conjuration is entitled 'To Have A Familiar Spirit Called Ebrion at Your Disposal'.40 Oberion has become Ebrion, and Cabereon has become Kaberion, but these are minor changes. What is more notable is that it is a French manuscript, and so the invocation has crossed the language barrier, though the actual conjurations are in Latin. Another spiritual creature that is found in this manuscript and only has a precedent in Folger Vb.26(1) is the demon called Baron. The conjuration in Sloane MS 3851 is dearly derived from Folger Vb.26(1), as may be seen in both the text (in English here, Latin in the Folger) and the sequence of characters, with those in this manuscript being based on those in Folger Vb.26(1). The Key of Solomon was the most copied set of grimoire families of the Renaissance period, and so it is unsurprising that there should be material from one of the manuscripts in this work. The spirit curse at fo.l11 is copied straight out of Additional MS 36674, a sixteenth century collection of manuscripts which includes a Key of Solomon text that is one of the earliest known examples of this family of grimoires. Also bound into this manuscript were copies of the Heptameron and Agrippa' s Of Occult Philosophy from the Fourth Book. This particular manuscript also had an interesting history, with the component sections including the Heptameron and Agrippa' s Of Occult Philosophy passing through the hands of several notable people. These texts (including the Key of Solomon and some notes by the astrologer, physician and magician Simon Forman) were all owned by the poet Gabriel Harvey (1545-1630), the friend and occasional mentor of Edmund Spenser. Harvey and Spenser were no strangers to the magical world of the time, as seen by references in their letters to their acquaintance figures such as Philip Sidney 39 See The Veritable Key of Solomon, Skinner & Rankine, 2008. 40 A Collection of Magical Secrets, Skinner & Rankine, 2009:42-46. 20 TheG� and Edward Dyer, who were� Harvey noted in the manusaij Heptameron and Agrippa's qrq \"This torne booke was ..{olal4 writings of Doctor Caius, nuzst.!rj Legg gave it to Mr Fletcher, ..fiA1J artist for his time\"42 , 1 Doctor John Caius (lSto-11 Mary and Queen Elizabeth 1,.

Doctor Legg gave it to Mr Fletcher, fellowe of the same colledge, and a learned artist for his time\"42 Doctor John Caius (1510-1573) was physician to both Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I, though the latter dismissed him from her service in 1568 due to his adherence to Catholicism. He is perhaps best known as a pioneering naturalist and the co-founder of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University. Doctor Thomas Legge was his successor, and the Mr Fletcher he passed the manuscript on to is not John Fletcher the playwright mentioned above, but John Fletcher (1566-1613), a talented mathematician, physician and astrologer.43 That notes by Simon Forman (1552-1611), the most infamous astrologer and physician of the Elizabethan Age, should also be contained in Additional MS 36674 demonstrates again the way material was sold or passed on between practitioners. It is interesting to note that Forman was based in Lambeth, where subsequent figures such as Captain Bubb would be based. The whole of Additional MS 36674, which includes a great deal more miscellaneous material as well as a draft of Dr John Dee's Heptarchia Mystica, was later owned by Baron John Somers and his brother-in­law Sir Joseph Jekyll, who also owned Sloane MS 3851, the manuscript which forms the basis of this book. In the Latin section of Psalm use in Sloane MS 3851 we see the exact same charms for eleven of the Psalms (17, 18, 34, 38, 42, 47, 50, 57, 76, 90, and 98) as are found in the seventeenth century French Psalrnic work, The Book ofGold.44 Two further charms (second charm for 50, 114) are simplified versions of those found in The Book of Gold, and four charms (7, 7, 66, 95) bear no resemblance to those found in that work. Of the Psalm charms, only one is derived from �1 The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, Yates, 1983:96 . .!2 Additional MS 36,674, C17th. � Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College 1348-1895 Vol 1, Roberts & Gross, 1901:95 ..

This latter option seems quite likely, as The Book of Gold is written in French, and the Psalm material in The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet is in bad Latin, which may well indicate copyist's errors. This would then suggest that if there was an earlier manuscript it was written in Latin, and the scribe of Lansdowne MS 1202 translated it into French, which fits with the fact that The Book of Gold was bound with a French copy of the Key of Solomon. As with The Book of Gold, the Psalm numeration in the Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet is based on the Greek (Septuagint) system. Material copied into and from Sloane MS 3851 Fo.

There are three sections in the book where Elias Ashmole' s handwriting is found. These occur at the beginning, where Agrippa is quoted and Arthur Gauntlet is identified as the author of the book (fo.2-2v), in the perfumes section where Ashmole has added a piece from Agrippa on a page which has a paragraph written by Gauntlet at the top (fo.l14), and the toothache charm at the end of the book (fo.l46v). The toothache charm was specifically mentioned by a friend of Ashmole's, the writer and antiquary John Aubrey (1626-1697) in his Miscellanies Upon Various Subjects. He gives the charm word-perfect to the copy in this manuscript and with the comment that it was \"out of Mr. Ashmole's manuscript writ with his own hand\".47 This clearly shows Ashmole owned the manuscript at some point after Gauntlet's death. John Aubrey's name is mentioned in Sloane MS 3846, with 3 pages of notes 'Excerpted from Mr Aubrey's collection of dreams'.48 Ashmole became close friends with William Lilly after they met in 1646, with the two often conducting magical experiments together. Ashmole was fascinated with angelic communication, as his records show, and he was introduced to a number of astrologers and cunning-men by Lilly. Whether this number included Arthur Gauntlet we cannot know, but Ashmole certainly managed to get hold of his book and identified the handwriting as belonging to Gauntlet. Ashmole purchased Lilly's library from his widow after his death for the significant sum of £140 (this would equate to around £19,000 in 2011), but this did not include Arthur Gauntlet's work, which as previously mentioned had been sold to John Humphreys. Here I am making an educated guess, as the very last page of the book has the curious inscription \"Ann Savadge in Rosemary Lane\" written on a blank page in Ashmole's hand. I propose that this is the name of the person from whom Ashmole acquired the book, as he would have been keen to detail such information, a fact verified by his recording of Arthur Gauntlet's handwriting at the front of the manuscript. 47 Miscellanies Upon Various Subjects, Aubrey, 1696. 48 Sloane MS 3846, fo.l14v-115v. 24 TheGn..i The identity of Ann S.

The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet The identity of Ann Savadge in Rosemary Lane is a mystery. There was an Anne Savadge married to a mariner called Richard Babson on 19th December 1642 in Stepney. Babson died at some point after May 1649, leaving Anne Savadge with two living children Margaret (b. 12 September 1643) and Thomas (b. 11 May 1649). They also had a daughter called Mary in 1645 who died aged 9 months. To have possessed the book Ann Savadge would logically have been interested in magic, or more likely a practitioner. As there are two unidentified hands in the book it is likely that one of them is hers, which would make her a practitioner, possibly even a cunning-woman. With Gauntlet having worked with a woman as his speculatrix, it seems appropriate that his book should have subsequently been used by another female magician. The only Rosemary Lane in London is in Mortlake, which is not only where Dr John Dee lived, but curiously was mentioned by Lilly in his autobiography and was also associated with the alleged witch Sarah Griffith in 1704.49 Lilly described how \"One Sir Thomas Jay, a Justice of the Peace on Rosemary Lane, issued out his warrant for the apprehension of Poole\".50 The astrologer William Poole evaded capture due to the death of Jay, and Lilly subsequently gave a woman called Alice How to him in marriage. As Lilly recorded that John Humphreys had purchased Arthur Gauntlet's books, then it is likely that he sold this volume on to Ann Savadge, being more of a dabbler or 'nibbler'51 as Lilly called him, than a serious practitioner. In July 1704, \"Sarah Griffith of Rosemary Lane, was swum in the New River Head. She apparently swam like a cork\".sz In Sloane MS 3846 there is a note which refers to the table of contents being written \"in the hand of Lord Somers' catalogues\".s3 The table of contents in Sloane MS 3851 is in the same hand, indicating that the book passed through the hands of Lord Somers. 49 A Full and True Account of the Discovery, Apprehending, and taking of a Notorious Witch, who was carried before Justice Bateman in Well-Close on Sunday, July the 23.

He was also an angel magician who collected numerous manuscripts of grimoires and magical practices, including many of the manuscripts which he would bequeath to his brother-in-law Joseph Jekyll. Sir Joseph Jekyll (1663-1738) was Master of the Rolls, and married the second sister of John Somers. Like Somers he was an eminent lawyer, and he also shared his passion for magic. Jekyll gathered a huge collection of magical manuscripts including a number of the writings of Dr John Dee, as well as many of his brother-in-law's treasures. When Jekyll's huge library was sold in 1740, it took sixteen days to auction it. From the reference to the manuscript being \"Lot 378 in Jekyll's Sale, 1739/40\" we know it had passed from Somers to Jekyll. One of the most prolific buyers at the epic Jekyll library sale was Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753), an old friend of John Somers. Sloane purchased many of the magical manuscripts in the auction, and doubtless tried out some of the material he acquired. His interest in magical material is seen in the correspondence between Sloane and Somers dated 1710.54 Sloane's shelfmark is found on the first page of the manuscript, which along with the rest of his collection was left to the British Library on his death and formed the basis of the invaluable Sloane collection. So on the basis of all this information I suggest the provenance of this manuscript is from its originator Arthur Gauntlet, to John Humphreys, to Ann Savadge to Elias Ashmole, to Baron Somers, to Lord Jekyll, to Hans Sloane and then to the British Library. Based on all the conclusions I have already outlined, I suggest that the two unknown styles of handwriting in the manuscript are probably those of Ann Savadge and John Humphreys. As has already been discussed, John Humphreys was more of a dabbler, and for this reason I feel the second handwriting is more likely to be his. The material in this second handwriting covers pages on the antimonial cup, making optic glass and toothache. As such it is perhaps more likely to have been written by an astrologer (hence optic glass) dabbling in physick (toothache and the antimonial cup). 54 Sloane MS 4042 fo.159, & Sloane MS 4061 fo.27-33. 26 The GrimoiruJ This would then make Ann Saw the first hand, which includes a4; the Psalms for healing, and othl!l'i A number of the charms f4 between fo.9, fo.125-127, fo.l31;\\ Lady Ayscough in her Book ofafA l of the charms reproduced bylJ copied and reproduced by CJ.il called Old Household Words u\\Jj Dickens also makes a poillt� MCornelius Agrippa, a name hel4W written a great deal to the same Jill! from his 'Occult Philosophy' Ill encouraged. \"56 , 1 .. 55 Wellcome MS 1026. 56 Old Household Words, Dickealil"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"I f ,..c.-tlet to become the Lord President of the Royal an angel magician who grimoires and magical �pts which he would ' ,..

A number of the charms from this book, particularly on or between fo.9, fo.125-127, fo.130, fo.l37-139, were reproduced by Lady Ayscough in her Book of Receipts and Chirurgery (1692).55 Some of the charms reproduced by Lady Ayscough were subsequently copied and reproduced by Charles Dickens in 1852 in an article called Old Household Words in Household Words Volume 5, pp80-83 . Dickens also makes a point of mentioning Agrippa, saying, \"Cornelius Agrippa, a name held in great veneration by our ancestors, has written a great deal to the same purpose as the above. One or two extracts from his 'Occult Philosophy' will show what sort of wisdom he encouraged. \"56 55 Wellcome MS 1026. 56 Old Household Words, Dickens, 1852:82. 27"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Contributors Folio Hand 1 Baron Somers catalogues 2-2b Ashmole 3-29b Arthur Gauntlet (Main hand) 30 Unknown hand (possibly Ann Savadge) 31b-113b Arthur Gauntlet 114 Ashmole (Agrippa piece) 114b-116 Arthur Gauntlet 117-120b Unknown hand 121-12Sb Arthur Gauntlet 12Sb-126 Unknown hand 127-127b Unknown hand 2 (possibly John Humphreys) 128-132b Arthur Gauntlet 133b Unknown hand 134-145 Arthur Gauntlet 14Sb Unknown hand 2 146b Unknown hand 148 Ashmole 28 --The G ....

Where words are underlined, they were underlined in the manuscript. Page numbers within the manuscript are indicated by a number within normal brackets, e.g. (3). Thus a number indicates that the text following it is on that numbered page. Where a contraction is given, it may be expanded with the rest of the word in square brackets, but this was not part of the original manuscript. Many words, particularly in Latin, were written in an abbreviated form, and where this occurs, the words are given in full in the text, e.g. the letter u represents um, so modii = modum. Likewise where Roman numerals have been used for numbers, the number is given in square brackets afterwards for convenience, e.g. iii [3] Where symbols for weights and measures were used in the original manuscript, I have replaced these with the term they describe, e.g. Vz for K Whenever text is given in Latin, as it was in places in the original manuscript, the English is footnoted to provide a convenient translation of the material. In some instances the words appear to be gibberish, and may be mis-copied or corrupted voces magicae. Having studied the original manuscript in the British Library, I can confirm that it is faded and stained in places, making it extremely difficult to read some of the words and images.

The missing section as given in other versions of the Arbatel is: \"Appoint therefore to him who solely dependeth upon God, the wisdom of every creature to serve and obey him, nolens volens, willing or unwilling. And in this, the omnipotency of God shineth forth. It consisteth therefore in this, that we will discern the creatures which serve us, from those that are unwilling; and that we may learn how to accommodate the wisdom and offices of every creature unto our selves. This Art is not delivered, but divinely. Unto whom God will, he revealeth his secrets; but to whom he will not bestow any thing out of his treasuries, that person shall attain to nothing without the will of God. Therefore we ought to desire ten pneumatiken epistemen [the spiritual science] from God alone, which will mercifully impart these things unto us. For he who hath given us his Son, and commanded us to pray for his holy Spirit, How much more will he subject unto us the whole creature, and things visible and invisible? Whatsoever ye ask, ye shall receive. Beware that ye do not abuse the gifts of God, and all things shall work together unto you for your salvation.

The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Most general Precepts of this Secret:-: Every Governor worketh with his Spirits one way naturally to wit in the same manner. Otherwise of his free will. If he be not hindered of God. Secondly he is able to do all things which he doth naturally in a long time in a fore disposed manner. So Och the prince of the Sun in long time prepareth Gold in the mountains. In less time by Chemical art. Magically in a moment. A true and divine magician may use all the creatures of God, And the office of the Governors of the world unto a beck. Therefore the Governors of the world obey them and being called they come and follow their commands. Notwithstanding God is the author. As the Sun stood still for Joshua116 They send indeed their Spirits to mean Magicians who obey them only some determinate business But they hear not false magicians but object them being deluded by Devils and they cast them into diverse perils God permitting As Jeremiah testifies of the Jews in his eighth chapter. In all the Elements there are 7 Governors with their hosts who are moved by equal motion with the firmament And always the inferiors depend of the superiors. As it is taught in Philosophy. Man is ordained a Magician from the womb of his mother that would be a true magician. Others that have taken upon them this office are unhappy. To this agreeth that which John Baptist saith No man can receive any thing to himself unless it be given him from above.117 Every character is given from this Spirit In every reason he hath his efficacy in this business in which it is given in a prefixed time but we must use him the hour and day of the planet in which it is given. God liveth and thy soul liveth, Keep thy covenant with him which thou hast with the Spirit the revealer in God That all things may be done which the Spirit promiseth thee. 116 Joshua 10:12-13. 117 John 3:27. 71"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Aphorism:18: Some names of the Olympical Spirits are delivered by some men but such only in efficacy which have made known to everyone by the revealer the visible or invisible Spirit And these names are delivered to everyone as they are predestinated thereunto. Therefore they are said to be Constellated and seldom they have power beyond 40 years. Therefore it is the safest way for young Arts men that without names they work by the only office of the Spirits And if they be foreordained into this Magick the rest of the Arts required offer themselves of their own accord. Only pray for constant faith and God will grant all things in fit time. Aphorism:19: Heaven and his Inhabitants offer themselves to men of their own accord in form of Spirits and their offices to them that are invited By how much the more thou dost desire them they will be present. But what wicked Spirits do come from the envy of the Devil and how they have allured those men unto themselves as being sinners unto due punishment. Therefore whosever desireth to be familiarly conversant with the Spirits let him keep himself from all enormous sins and pray diligently for the custody of the highest and let him break through the snares of the Devil and his impediments and hindrances. For he myself shall be Appointed and commanded of God to serve a true Magician.

And they have their names derived from their offices and virtues even as God hath distributed to every of them his gift.

Aphorism:35: The human mind is the only effecter of wonderful works so that the will join herself to what Spirit she will. Being conjoined she produceth what she will. Therefore we must proceed in Magick warily lest Mermaids and other Monsters deceive us - who likewise desire the Society of the human mind. Therefore always lie thou hid under the wings of the Highest lest thou offer thy self to be devoured by the roving lion.

The first is That we may day and night meditate how one should ascend to the true knowledge of God. As well by the revealed word (25) from the beginning As by the seal of creation and Creatures and by the wonderful effects which visible and invisible Creatures of God do show. 2. Secondly it is required that a man descend into himself and that he study especially to know himself, what mortal thing he hath in himself and what immortal And what is the property of every part, what the diversity. 3. Thirdly, that he learn by his immortal part to worship love and fear the Eternal God and to adore him in spirit and truth, And to do those things with his mortal part which he knoweth to be grateful to god and profitable to his neighbour. These are the three chief and first precept of Magick to which whosoever shall prepare himself, unto true Magick or divine wisdom to the coveting and following of the same that he may be counted worthy the knowledge thereof, whom the Angelical creatures shall obey not only obscurely but also manifestly and face to face. 4. Fourthly Seeing that everyone is called from the womb of his mother that he should be occupied in a certain kind of life, Therefore it is requisite that everyone should thoroughly know whether he be born into Magick or no And into what kind of Magick which everyone shall perceive which readeth these things and judged them easy and by experience shall find in himself good success. For such and so great gifts are not given but to the poor in Spirit & humble. 5. Fifthly he must note whether he can perceive the Spirits assisting him manifestly in the greatest businesses that are to be undertaken. Because if he shall find them to be such assistants, It is manifest he is made a Magician by the ordinance of God, that is, such a person which useth the ministry of the spirits unto the effecting of excellent things.

Sixthly, A Magician hath need of faith and silence that no secret especially may be made which the spirit revealeth to him as Daniel was commanded to keep secret secrets.151 For some things are sealed that is not brought forth into public. So neither was it lawful for Paul to utter those things he saw in Revelation.1s2 No man would believe how much is placed in this one only precept. 7. Seventhly, very great righteousness is required in a Magician to come, that is, that he should not undertake anything that is either ungodly, irreligious or unjust, yea that he admit not any such thing into his mind. And by the holy of God he shall be defended from all evil.

And that he think himself to have him to be a viewer of all his actions and thoughts Therefore let him direct all his whole life unto the prescribed order set forth in the word of God. 2.

Fourthly let us be very far from superstitions. That is meant to be Superstition in this place, To attribute the duty to things in which there is no divine thing. Also it is a choosing of the will to worship God otherwise than he hath commanded. Such are all your Ceremonies of Satanicall Magick who Impudently would be worshipped as God. 5. Fifthly, the worshipping of Idols is to be avoided which with their own proper motion bindeth the divine power to Idols or other things where they are not placed of the Creator, In the order of nature, Many such things the evil magicians effect. 6. Sixthly, the crafty deceits of the devil is to be avoided whereby he will imitate the power of the creation and creator that he might bring forth things with a word. Things which are not as though they were, which is only incommunicable of the omnipotent God and the creature. 7.

All those are to be referred into this order who are noted in the hours of the 12 tables.158 And their evil deeds are also noted But we will mark the subdivisions and kinds of either Magick in this Tome following. It shall be sufficient in this place that we have made distinction and difference of Good Science and bad. Seeing that the first man desired possession of them both to his hurt, As Moses and Hermes show. Aphorism:42: We must know in the second place that a Magician is a person predestinated unto this kind of work from the womb of his mother. Neither hath anyone assumed anything to himself of such things unless he hath been called to this work divinely unto a good end from Grace, unto an ill end that the Scripture might be fulfilled. Offences must come but woe to that man by whom they come.159 Furthermore as we have warned before let us live in this world with fear and trembling. Notwithstanding we deny not some kinds of both Magick to be followed by some with Study and diligence if he be admitted But unto those chief kinds he shall never aspire unto. Yea if he desire those things he will be violated in body and soul without doubt Such are they who are transferred by (27) cacomagical work unto the mountains of Horeb,160 Or are swallowed up with Some Solitudes to whom many evils happen even to bodies and minds, Or at length are deprived of their mind, As such things happen to many by use when as they are left of God, And delivered to Sathan. 157 Acts 8:9-24. 158 The Roman legal text Duodecim Tabularum, of 451 BCE. 159 Luke 17:1. 160 The Divine location where Moses received the commandments according to Deuteronomy, also sometimes given as being another name for Mount Sinai. 89"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet The Seventh Septem: Aphorism:43: God liveth and his works remain in that state wherein he would have them for he would we should use them with his liberty unto the obedience of his commandments. He hath proposed (to them that obey,) his rewards, But to them that disobey; his deserved punishments. Therefore they have known the Spirits by free will through pride and contempt of the Son of God. And they are referred to the day of wrath.161 There is a very great power left to them in the creation, But notwithstanding it is Limited And always they are compelled by the bridle of God to keep their bonds but a magician of God which sounds the wisdom of God or the informed of God by the hand of God is brought forth to all eternal good, and mean things, or also chief corporeals. Great is the power of Sa than by reason of man's great sins. And therefore great things have been done by Satanicall magick, yea greater things than anyone will believe. And although they subsist in their limits notwithstanding they are beyond all human capacity, for as much as they aim at the corporeal and transitory things of this life as many histories of the Ancients testify, And we have daily examples. For conclusion both kinds of magick differ among themselves. This passeth over into eternal goods and useth temporal things with thanksgiving, That is Solicitous about eternal things but applieth himself wholly to corporeal that he may enjoy freely all his lusts and delights unto the contempt of God And of his wrath. Aphorism:44: The passing over the common life of men unto the Magical life is nothing else but sleeping from the same life unto the same life watching for what things happen in common life to ignorant and unskilful men. They happen much more to the learned and willing. A Magician understandeth when his mind thinketh of himself when it deliberateth, reasoneth, constitutes, and defines something to be done. He observes when his thoughts wander from the assisting separated essence, And proveth by what order that assistant essence is separated. 161 Job 21:30. 90 The Grill But a man unfulfilled� affections up and down.

For the Psalmist saith, wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way By ruling himself according to thy word.162 To keep therefore the word of God lest the evil one should catch it from thy heart is the chief precept of wisdom. It is lawful to receive and admit those suggestions which are not against the glory of God and love toward the neighbour, without demanding from what spirit such a suggestion came, yet we must take heed that we busy not ourselves too much about unnecessary things according to Christ's admonition, Martha, Martha, thou art solicitous about many things but Mary hath chosen the better part which shall not be taken from her.163 Be we ruled always by the saying of Christ.

But on the other side men are turned away to nothing even as Chaff is turned with the wind, And for them we have chosen this 46th Aphorism. For as everyone hath carried himself even so he hath allured to himself the Spirits of his nature and condition But one exhorteth very truly that no man would go beyond his calling herein lest he should allure some malign Spirit unto himself from the uttermost parts of the world by 162 Psalm 118:9. 163 Luke 10:41-42. 164 Matthew 6:33. 91"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet whom he might be deceived and drawn unto his final hurt.

For it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, But either of God that showeth mercy, or of some other spiritual fate, from hence all Magick springeth whether it be good or bad after this manner Tages_ the first teacher of the Roman's magick sprang out of the earth, Diana of the Ephesians showeth as it were from Heaven her worship,166 And so Apollo and the universal religion of the Gentiles was received from the same Spirits neither are they Man's inventions as the Sadducees hold. Aphorism:49: and the last: Let the conclusion of this Isagoge be the same that is spoken (29) of above by us, for as much as there is one God from whom is derived all good: And again seeing there is but one sin to wit disobedience to God's will and Commandments from whence proceeds all evil. So the fear of the Lord is the beginning ?f wisdom167 and is all the profit of Magick. For obedience to the will of God follows the fear of God the presence of God and his holy spirit And the ministries of the Holy Angels follow this his will and all good things out of the never drawn dry treasuries of God . But the unprofitable and damned Magick springeth from Sathan when we lose the fear of God from our hearts and suffer him to reign among us. There presently the prince of this world the God of this age hath appointed such a one of his kingdom that he might find such a one profitable for his kingdom. Thus he taketh the Godless Magician even as a silly fly is taken in the Cobweb of A Spider, And so Sathan deceiveth them hunting them into his nets of 166 Acts 19:35. 167 Psalms 110:10. 93"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet desires until he bring them into the matter of eternal fire he elevates and carrieth them up on high that they may have the greater fall.

And our experiments are sifted out and composed That they might bring forth all wonderful effects. The truth is because they are delivered there more by contemplation than by practice. Also some are not so complete. Some are spoken figuratively (as it were in a riddle) that sometimes those things which with great study diligence and curious searching out we have obtained are expounded to all ignorant vulgars: Therefore in this book we have finished the hidden philosophy which is as the complement and key of the books of all Magical works:-And we will give thee the precepts and most joyful experiments of the undefiled truth and unvanquished magical discipline of the holy Gods: That when thou readest these books of the hidden Philosophy thou mayest desire to know these things greedily Therefore read this book and thou shalt triumph of the truth wherefore touch it within the secrets of thy religious breast and it will pierce with silence. But conceal it with a constant taciturnity. But know thou this that the names of the intelligences governing every one of the Planets are ordained after this manner For the letters being gathered from the figure of the world from the rising of the body of the Planet according to the succession of the Signs by single degrees. And by those single degrees aspected by the Planet itself made by the degree of the ascendant. After the same manner the names of the princes of the evil Spirits are received by a retrograde or back degree order. Governing under all the Planets by making extension against the succession of the Signs from the beginning of the Seventh house But the name of the supreme intelligence whom many judge to be the soul of the world is gathered from the four bounds of the figure of the world according as I have delivered the reason. And by the opposite manner is gathered the name of the great Devil about the four cadent comers. Likewise thou shalt gather the names of the great spirits governing the powers of the air above the four comers of the succeeding houses So that a casting out is made that the name of 232 This is the start of the material from Agrippa's Of Occult Philosophy or Of Magical Ceremonies.

But to find out the name of the evil spirit do the contrary. But know this That the names of the evil Spirits are drawn out by these tables. The names of the good as well as of the bad spirits So that notwithstanding if we enter into the table with the name of the good Spirit of the second order we shall find out the name of the evil Spirit of the order of the Princes and governors. But if we enter the table with the name of a good Spirit of the third order Or with the name of an evil Spirit the governor what way soever they are picked out, either by this table or by the Heavenly figure the names which proceed from these will be the names of the evil Spirits the ministers of the inferior order. Also this we must know That as often as we enter into this table233 with the good Spirits of the second order The names themselves are drawn out of the second order. And if under them we draw out the name of the evil Spirit It is that of the superior order of the Governors. And it is the same if we enter with the name of the evil Spirit of the superior order. But if we enter this table with the names of the spirits of the third order Or of the Spirits the ministers as well good as bad. The names of the Spirits the ministers of the inferior order will be picked out. But many Magicians men not of little authority after this manner would enlarge their tables in Latin letters So that by the same tables as also by the name of the office or of any effect the name of the Spirit as well good as bad was found out. Likewise as above it is delivered by taking the name of the office or effect in the column of the letters in his line under his Star. And the great author of this is Trismegistus who when he delivered his calculation in the Egyptian letters he could not refer them foolishly to other letters of other tongues by reason of the assigned to the Signs. But of all men who have handled to find out the names of the Spirits he was the first that was extant. Therefore the force and secret and dignity of a master consisteth in disposing of the vowels how rightly and truly the holy names of (76) the Spirits are found out which may bring to pass the name of the Spirit and to whom the right name is appointed. And this artifice is thus performed. First in placing the vowels of these 233 This table is in Book 3, ch.27 of Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy. 181"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet letters which by calculation of the heavenly figure are found out, unto the names of the Spirits of the second order good and bad Governing and Governors shall be picked out And this is thus performed in the good: The Stars being considered which ordain letters and place them in order First the degree of the eleventh house is subtracted from the degree of the Star which is the former in order And that which then remaineth is cast away234 from the degree of the ascendant And where that number ceaseth there is part of the vowel of the first Letter. Begin therefore to cast away the vowels of those letters according to his number and order. And that which shall happen in the place of the star which is the former in order That vowel is attributed to the first letter. From henceforth thou mayest find part of the second Letter By subtracting the degree of the star which is second in order from the former star and what remaineth cast away from the Ascendant And this is part from which thou mayest begin to cast away vowels and what shall happen above after the Star that is the vowel of the second letter And so consequently thou shalt fetch out the vowels of the following letters Always subtracting the degree of the Star following from the degree of the Star next going before And all casting away and numerations must be made according to the Succession of the Signs in the names of the good Spirits But in the names of the evil Spirits wherein the good the degree of the eleventh house is taken, In them the degree of the twelfth house is taken But the numerations and projections or castings away are all done with the succession of Signs taken their beginning from the degree of the tenth house. But in all these things extracted by the tables the vowels are placed after another manner. For first the how many number of letters is taken appointing the name itself And so it is numbered from the beginning of the column of the first letter or under which the name is extracted And the letter into which this number happeneth is referred unto the first letter of the name extracted by taking a distance of the one from the other according to the order of the Alphabet. But the number of that distance is cast away from the beginning of his column and where it ceaseth there is the part of the former vowel Therefore cast away the vowels themselves from it in his number and order and in the same column: And what shall happen above the first letter of the name that shall be attributed to itself.

Therefore cast away the vowels from it (as it is spoken of above) and those which shall happen above his letters are attributed to the same But if some vowel should happen above a vowel, Let the former give place to the latter: But understand this only of the good spirits: And in the bad thou mayest proceed the same way: unless thou makest numberings by a contrary and returned order And against the succession of the Alphabet And against the order of the columns to wit of the Ascendant. The name of the good Spirit of every man called his Genius which we have taught to find out in the third book of the hidden Philosophy according to that reason not of little authority, neither is it of a small foundation. But now we will show thee some other way assayed not with vain reasons. Of these one is by taking five places of the Hylegions235 in the figure of nativity which being noted the characters of the letters in their order and number from the beginning of Aries are cast away And those letters which fall into the degrees of the said places according to the order and dignity of them being disposed and combined do make plain the name of the Genius: There is also another way. Almutel are taken That is domineering Stars above the five said places, And let a projection or casting out be made from the degree of the Ascendant by gathering the letters falling above Almutel which being placed according to their dignity in order ordain the name of the Genius or Spirit of such a man: There is yet another way in much custom with the lEgyptians by making an extent from the degree of the ascendant by gathering the letters. The second Almutel of the eleventh house which house they call the good DeviP36 which being placed according to their dignity do ordain the names of men's Spirits. But after the same manner we find out the evil Genius or spirit of man But that projections are made against order (77) And succession of the signs And wherein the good we cast forth from the beginning of Aries. In the bad we number from the beginning of Libra: wherein the good we number from the degrees of the 235 The five hylegical parts were heavenly positions calculated by reference to the planets and used in medieval astrological charts. They are the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Mid-Heaven and Part of Fortune. 236 Turner gives 'daemon'. 183"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet Ascendant, In the bad we cast away from the degree of the Seventh house. But according to the lEgyptians the name of the Genius is gathered after Almutel of the twelfth house whom they call the evil Devil. And all these rites which we have delivered from us to others being written in the Third book of the hidden Philosophy may be done by the characters of any language: Seeing in all these (as above it is said) There is A mystical and divine number, order, and figure, From whence it cometh to pass that the same Genius or Spirit of man may be called by diverse names. But others from the name of the same Spirit good or bad are extracted by tables formed unto this. Therefore the heavenly characters consist of lines and heads. There are six heads according to the six magnitudes or greatness of the Stars unto which also the Planets are reduced. The first magnitude keepeth a star or cross with the Sun. The second with Jupiter holds a circular point The third with Saturn, A half circle triangle round or sharp The fourth keeps with Mars one line passing through another or a Squared right or crooked. The fifth with Venus and Mercury a Girdle or a tailed point ascending or descending. The sixth with the Moon black points all which thou mayest behold in the table following. Therefore placing the heads according to the situation of the Stars in the figure of Heaven, Then the lines are prolonged according to the convenience of their natures, And this thou must understand of the fixed Stars.

But in this there is not a little difficulty when as to wit the letter of the name into the line of figures or letters that we might know what figure or what letter is to be taken. But this maybe thus known: For if A letter should happen in the line of letters, Consider how many this letter is in the order of the name as the second or third: Then how many letters the name itself contains, as five, or seven: And multiply these numbers together among themselves, and triple the product. Afterward the whole being gathered together, cast away from the beginning of the letters according to the succession of the Alphabet: And into which of the letters that number happeneth that it is that ought to be put in the Character of that Spirit. But if some letter of a name happen into the line of figures: This shalt thou do, Take the number how many this letter is in the order of the name, and multiply it by the number how many this letter is in the Order of the Alphabet, and being gathered together divide it by nine The residue showeth the figure or number to be placed in the Character.

And furthermore there are Characters which are some certain familiar figures and images of the evil Spirits under whose form they are wont to appear and meet with those that call for them And these Images are found out by the Table following, according to the reason of the letters which ordain the name of the Spirit himself, So that if any letter be accounted or reckoned manyfold in the same Spirit the Image of him possesseth the sovereignty or Lordship, the rest after their manner by mixture, So that those that are the former orders the superior part the head of the body is attributed to them according to their figure: But the last occupy the feet and legs; So the middle letters show something to be like the middle part of the body, But if any contrariety shall happen, that letter which is the better in number let it prevail: But if things be equal they shall be mingled together: Moreover if the same name shall obtain some notable token or Instrument from the table of Characters the same also shall obtain it in the Image. But we shall be able to know the dignities of the evil Spirits by those tables of the Characters and Images.

Moreover now let us speak of the Holy Pentacles and Seals. Now the Pentacles themselves are as some certain holy signs to preserve us from evil events and helping us to bind and exterminate the evil Spirits and alluring the good Spirits reconciling them to us. The Pentacles consist of the Characters and names of the good Spirits of the Superior order, Or of the Sacred pictures of the holy letters or revelations: with verses found out either of the Geometrical figures and holy names of God composed according to the purpose of many, Or of all those together, Or of many of them compounded and mixed. But those characters which are profitable for us for the ordaining of the pentacles are those characters of the good spirits. Especially of the good of the first and second order sometimes also of the third And of this kind of Characters which most chiefly is called holy Then those characters which above we have called holy. Therefore whatsoever character of this sort appointed let us compose it about with a double circle In which let us write about the name of his Angel And if we would add some divine name to that Spirit agreeable to his office It shall be of greater power and efficacy And if we would lead about some corner figure to him according to the reason of the numbers That all 240 Magpie . 191"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet so may be done. But the holy pictures which form the Pentacle are those which here and there in the holy Scriptures and Prophets as well of the old as new testament are delivered to us. As the figure of the Serpent on the Cross and the like of the which there is great plenty found out in the vision of the Prophets as of Isaac, Daniel, Edras241 and others As also out of the Revelation, And we have spoken of them in the third book of the hidden Philosophy where we have made mention of these holy things. Therefore place some such picture of the holy Images and compass it about with a double Circle to whom242 let some divine name be written apt and conformable in effect to the figure itself: Or let some little verse be written about to him taken from part of the body of the holy Scripture which promiseth or prayeth for a desired effect. As if a Pentacle should be made for victory and revenge against enemies as well visible as invisible. A figure may be taken out of the second book of the Machabees: To wit: A hand holding in it a Golden Sword brandished to which was written about a verse containing the same. To wit Take the holy Sword, the gift from God with which thou shalt cut in pieces the adversaries of my people Israel. Or also let this verse of the first243 Psalm be written about it, In this is the strength of thine arm, there is death before thy face, Or any other like verse. But if it like thee to write about a divine name Take some name signifying a Sword, Anger, The vengeance of God, or the like name agreeable to the desired effect, And if it like thee to write a comer figure. Take according to the reason of the number as we have taught in the second book of our hidden Philosophy where we have spoken of numbers. And so of the like works. And of this kind there are two pentacles of high virtue and great power very profitable and necessary to the consecration of Experiments and Spirits. Of them one is which we have in the first chapter of the revelation to wit. The figure of the Majesty of God sitting in the throne having in his mouth a two-edged Sword as there it is said.

But those Pentacles which are ordained of figures and names keep this order, For place some figure conformable to some number unto some sure effect or virtue, Let there be written in all the comers some divine name obtaining the force of the desired thing Notwithstanding it must be so that such a name be of so many letters as the figure appointeth the number Or how many letters of the name conferred together among themselves Do appoint the number of the figure or doth constitute some number which by the number of the figure without any superfluity or diminishment may be parted. For such a name found out one or more or diverse must be written in the figure in all the comers But in the middle of the figure -the whole or at least the principal revolution of turning back of the same name shall be placed. We oftentimes ordain also pentacles by making a certain revolution of some name in the foursquare table with a single circle going about or with a double writing therein some holy versicle agreeable to this name or from which the name is derived. And this is the form of the pentacles according to their distinct manners 244 Psalm 67:29. 245 This verse is drawn from a thanksgiving hymn recited after the liberation of a demoniacally possessed person from Renaissance Italy. 246 This verse is drawn from Saint Adelbert's curse or charm against thieves, Book 12, ch. 17 of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft. 193"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet which we may multiply and mingle together unto a greater efficacy and to the intention and extension of virtue among themselves with others. As if prayer should be made for the destruction of enemies, we must remember how god destroyed the face of the Earth in the deluge of waters, Sodom and Gomorrah by rain of fire and brimstone, The Host of Pharaoh in the red sea And the like, If there be any other curse found in the holy Scriptures. So by praying against the danger of waters, Let us remember the safeguard of Noah in the deluge, The Children of Israel's safe passage over the red Sea, And also Christ walking with dry feet upon the waters And preserving the ship being in danger to be drowned and the like. Lastly when with these we call upon some holy names of God, To wit those which are significant to our desire And those which are profitable to the purposed desire. As for the destruction of enemies we call upon the names of the wrath, vengeance, fear, justice and the strength of God. But for the avoiding of some peril or evil we call upon the names of God's mercy, defence, salvation, fortitude, Goodness and the like names of God. Also when we pray God to grant us that which we desire, That name we may set between some good Spirits one or more whose office is that we desire. Also oftentimes we humbly beseech God to send some evil Spirit to constrain men whose name also we insert or place between: And this is rightly done, if the work tendeth to evil as unto revenge, punishment, or destruction. Furthermore if any versicle in the Psalms or other part of Scripture be found agreeable to our desire we place that between in our prayers: But make a prayer unto God: Sometimes it will be convenient to make a prayer after that To the executor whose ministry we desire in our former prayer whether he be one or more whether he be an Angel or Star whether a Soul of one of the heroical men And such ought the prayer to be compounded according to the delivered rules by us in the second book of our hidden Philosophy, where we have spoken of the compounding of Enchantments. (83) Thou must know also that there are three sorts of bonds. For the first bond is when we Conjure by natural things, The Second is composed of the mysteries of religion As by Sacraments Miracles and the like, The third is ordained by divine names and holy Seals. And by these bonds not only the Spirits, But also whatsoever Creatures else are bound: As the living creatures, Tempests, Fires, Plagues, And the force of armies &c. Oftentimes we use the aforesaid bonds not only after the manner of conjuration but also by way of Prayer and thanksgiving.

Superstition is of very much force in these by the translation of some Sacramental rite to that which we intend to bind or hinder, As the rite of Excommunication, of burials, funerals, and the like. It is convenient that we should speak of consecration which is made by a man, And instruments necessary for this Art in all things And this virtue is perfited247 especially in two things: To wit, By the virtue of the person himself consecrating, And by the virtue of the prayer itself by which consecration is made. For in the person there is required holiness of life, and power of hallowing which both are attained by Dignification or by being made worthy and by instruction in the beginnings or principals of religion: Afterward this is also required that the person himself know undoubtedly and of a firm belief that this virtue and power is in himself, But of part of the prayer itself by which consecration is made there is required the same holiness which is either in the prayer itself: As many holy prayers which are found in holy Scripture or such as are appointed by the ordination of the church from virtue of the Holy Ghost: Or there is holiness in a Prayer not by itself But by commemoration or remembering again of holy things, Or the commemoration of the holy Scriptures, histories, works, miracles, effects, Graces, Promises, Sacraments and Sacramental things and the like: which will be seen to attain to the consecrated thing, Some similitude properly or improperly, Add hereto the invocation of the holy and divine names with the figuring of the holy Seals and the like, which tend unto sanctification and satisfaction to God: As are the holy waters, Sprinklings about, the Anointings of the holy oil, Sweet Suffumigations, these added to a religious life. Know this also that in every consecration the blessings and consecrations of water, oil, fire, and fumigations, with the wax or Lamps, those blessed Lights go before, For without light no Sacrament is rightly performed. This also is to be known and firmly to be observed that if a thing be consecrated in profane things into which some pollution may happen, then the exorcism and satisfaction of those things ought to go before the consecration: which things as they are 247 Perfected. 195"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet effected by virgins are more apt to receive the influence of divine virtues. It is also to be observed that in the end of every consecration after the prayer duly pronounced, the consecrator himself ought by words in the presentence to bless by drawing in his breath the thing to be consecrated in the divine virtue and power And he must remember his own virtue and authority So may it be done more rightly and with a firm mind. Now therefore I will place and give thee some example of these things by which the way shall easily lay open unto thee to the considering the whole in a key. So in the consecration of water are remembered how God placed in the firmament in the midst of the waters How he in the terrestrial paradise placed a fountain of waters from whence by the four holy rivers the universal orb of the world is watered. Also how he made the waters of his Justice an instrument to destroy the Giants248 by the general flood upon all the Earth And in the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the red Sea Also how he brought forth his own People with dry feet through the midst of the Sea and through the midst of Jordan And how miraculously he brought forth water out of the rock in the wilderness and brought forth a fountain of living water out of the Tooth of the Jawbone of an ass at the prayer of Samson249 Also how he placed the waters Instruments of his mercy and salvation in the doing away of original sin. Also how Christ was Baptised in Jordan who by this cleansed and sanctified the waters, Moreover the divine names that are conformable to this are to be called on, As for (84) example That God is a living fountain He is the water of life The flood of mercy and the life. So in the Consecration of fire we remember how God created the fire an instrument of his justice for punishment revenge and satisfaction of Sins. Also how he shall come to judge the world by fire Also how God appeared to Moses in a bush of fire burning Also how he went before the Children of Israel in a pillar of fire And how nothing might be offered Sacrificed or Sanctified according to the law without fire Also how he appointed the fire that should not go out to be kept in the tabernacle of the covenant: And the same being put out he kindled wonderful again And from another place hath conserved it to lay hid not put out under the water, And the like of this sort, Therefore the names of God which are conformable unto this must be called on As we read in the Law 248 Genesis 6:2-4. 249 Judges 15:19. 196 .,.. and the Prophets for G names among the diftl it As the Glory of� So in the co� holy things perta� oil of anointing And-· I Such is the name a.ll any the like in holy 1111 revelation2so con� the lamps burning bli!l blessing of light and. that altar which � As that of the Seven Gil of God.

So in the consecration of Oil and fumigations we remember holy things pertaining to this which we read out of Exodus Of the oil of anointing And the holy names of God conformable to these Such is the name Christ which signifieth anointed And if there be any the like in holy mysteries Such as that of the Apocalypse or revelation2so concerning the two Olive trees distilling holy oil into the lamps burning before the face of God and the like. But the blessing of light and wax and the lamps is taken from fire And from that altar which mingled the fuel of the flame together And the like As that of the Seven candlesticks and lamps burning before the face of God. These are the consecrations which are necessary first of all in all Sanctimony and ought to go before without which nothing can be duly performed. But we will show thee the consecrations of places Instruments and the like. Therefore thou shalt take out that Prayer of Solomon251 in the dedication of the Temple as thou art about to consecrate any place or circle, Furthermore thou shalt bless the place with blessed water and fumigation, remembering in blessing the mysteries what they are, The sanctification of the throne of God, The mountain of Sinai The Ark of the Covenant The Holy of Holies the Temple of Jerusalem Also the sanctifying of the Hill Golgotha by Christ Crucifying The Sanctifying of the Sepulchre of Christ Also the mountain of Jabor by the transfiguration and ascension of Christ and the like. Call upon divine names agreeable to these places, As the place of God The throne of God The seat of God, God's tabernacle God's Altar God's habitation and the like names of God which are meet to be written In the Circle or Consecrated place. But in Consecrating Instruments whatsoever things serving to this art Thou mayest go on the same way Sprinkling them with holy water And performing them with hallowed fumigations according with holy Oil By assigning some holy Seal by blessing with prayer By remembering holy things out of the Scriptures and religion and divine names which seem conformable to the thing considered As for Example In Consecrating the Sword, we remember that of the Gospel He which hath two coats &c and that 250 Revelation 11:4. 2s1 II Chronicles 6:12-42. 197"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet of the Machabees in the second book252 How there was wonderfully and divinely sent a Sword to Judas Machabear And if there be any the like in the prophets: s that Take to you the two edges swords. After the same manner thou shalt consecrate the experiment and books And whatsoever the like is in holy Scripture Pictures and the like by sprinkling perfuming anointing, Sealing and blessing the commemoration, by remembering Sanctifications from the Mysteries, As the Sanctification of the Tables of the Ten Commandments which were delivered to Moses from God in the Mountain of Sinai Also the Sanctification of the old and new Testament The Sanctification of the Law of the Prophets and Scriptures which were published by the Holy Ghost Moreover we must remember the holy names of God conformable to those As God's Testament, God's Book, the book of Life, The book of the knowledge of God, of the wisdom of God and the like. After the same manner the consecration of the person is performed. But there is as yet another rite of consecration of great wonder and much efficiency And this is from the kinds of superstitions whereas to wit the rite of consecration or conferring together some sacrament is transferred to that thing which we would consecrate. (85) Also it is to be known that a vow, oblation and Sacrifice have the force of consecration as well real as personal And they are as certain covenants and agreements between those names for whom they are made, And as who make them, Sticking strongly for our desire and wished effect. As for example, when our things, As fumigations, anointing, rings, images, looking Glasses, and those things which less partake of the matter, as powers Seals, Pentacles, enchantments, prayers, pictures, Scriptures, we vow offer and Sacrifice them to certain names As more at large you may see in the Second book of Hidden Philosophy. There remains with those Magicians who use very much the ministry of the Devils, a certain rite of calling Spirits by a book consecrated before which is rightly called the book of Spirits: Of that now there are a few things to be spoken: This book is consecrated, being the book of evil Spirits after its name and manner rightly composed, To which book the Spirits within written have vowed obedience at hand by their holy Oath Therefore this book is made of most pure paper, which not as yet is put to any 2s2 An Apocryphal book. 198 1111 use, Many call it virgilll this manner, The imatll on the right hand is� containing the name� office and power But. they have omitted IIIII more powerful to ned Furthermore the citalll ' observed accor� .. under might seem to-1111 which this is writlal� distributively with � come in peril of � place after the � reverently as it may.JII virtue by pollution aDIIII The little book i delivered thou mayt!llll The one is that all cal book be called unto • which we have ta� / placed without the a. written in the little � let the book be COlli Triangle, the same 'IIIII be gathered togetblil pictured to set their .. special and coiiliDDIIl received and kept • licensed according to • There is also _.. of the Spirits and it ist the opening of this bel And this way is sudl above is described bali prayers and bonds l wherewith every Spill book be brought � there be written in thi which we have desc:dl the first be put in the 1 of it.

Furthermore the circumstances of places, times, hours are to be observed according as to those Stars to which those Spirits are under might seem to agree in their seating rite and order, The book which this is written well bound let be adorned and conserved distributively with his registers and Seals lest any time it should come in peril of working to be opened without purpose in any place after the consecration. Furthermore it shall be kept as reverently as it may. For the reverence of the mind would lose his virtue by pollution and profanation. The little book composed according to the manner now delivered thou mayest go on to consecrate it two manner of ways, The one is that all and singular the Spirits which are written in the book be called unto the Circle according to the right and manner which we have taught above, And let the book to be consecrated be placed without the circle in a Triangle. And first let all the Oaths written in the little book be read in the presence of the Spirits: Then let the book be consecrated be laid without the circle in the Triangle, the same writ down and all and singular the Spirits will be gathered together where their images and characters are pictured to set their hands and to confirm and consecrate it with a special and common Oath which being done let the book be received and kept shut as is said above and let the Spirits be licensed according to the due rite. There is also another way more easy of consecrating the book of the Spirits and it is of much force unto every effect: unless it be in the opening of this book the spirits do not always come into sight, And this way is such as followeth. Make a book of the Spirits as above is described but at the end of the book Let the invocations or prayers and bonds and most strong Conjurations be written wherewith every Spirit whatsoever may be bound. Then let this book be brought together in 2 tables or plates of metal wherein let there be written in the inside the holy pentacles of God's majesty which we have described above out of the Revelation, Of which let the first be put in the beginning of the book, The second at the end of it. After this manner the book being perfected in a clear and fair 199"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet time before midnight Let the little book be carried unto the circle where ways do meet according to the art we have already taught: And there first open the book and consecrate it according to the rite and manner we have already spoken concerning consecration which being done let every of the Spirits be called which are written in the book after this manner and placing by conjuring them thrice by the bonds described in the book that they may come unto that place within three days space to perform their obedience and to confirm it in the said consecrated book. Then that little book being rolled up in white and clean linen buriest in the midst of the circle and there shut it up fast, And then destroying the circle because the Spirits shall be licensed do then depart before the Sun rising. But on the third day about midnight return or reform or make new the circle, And with bended knees make thy prayer and give thanks to God. (86) And precious fumigation being made open the hole and take forth the book and keep it not opening it. Then the spirits being licensed after their manner and the circle destroyed depart before the Sun rising. And this is the last rite of consecrating, It is profitable for all writings and Experiments which are directed to the Spirits, by placing this book between two holy plates of metal of the Pentacles, as above is already showed. But he that is about to work by the consecrated book let him do it in a clear time and fair sky little troubling the Spirits And let him place himself towards the region of the Spirit. Then let it be opened under a right register, And let the Spirit be called on by his oath, The same written down and confirmed, And by the name of the character and Image, for that which thou desirest, and if need be, Conjure him by the bonds which are placed at the end of the book: And obtaining thy desired effect Thou shalt license the Spirit to depart. Now concerning the invocation of Spirits as well good as bad Good Spirits are called upon as by diverse ways, and diverse ways they meet with us. For the watchful they speak openly or offer themselves to our sight Or they inform us in dreams and sleeps of our desired things by an oracle. Whosoever therefore would call upon a good Spirit that he might have sight and conference with him must observe two things especially, Of the which the one is about the disposition of the caller, The other concerning those things which are put to the prayer outwardly for the conformity of calling the Spirit.

Seven times let him do it without interruption or being let in his business. But the number of days of preparation is commonly a whole Month of the Moon: But another number observed with the Cabalists is forty days. But about those things which concern this rite of Calling. The first is That a clean place be chosen, Chaste, fast shut, quiet, and remote from all noise, Subject to no other sights. Here first he must exorcise and consecrate, And in this place let there be set a table or altar covered with white linen clean, placed towards the East, And upon it from either part, Let there be two consecrated waxen candles set burning whose flame in all these days must not be wanting. In the middle of the Altar let the plates of metaJ254 or holy pages be placed as is above said covered with fine linen which unto the end of those days is not to be uncovered Also thou shalt have the precious fumigation provided and ready prepared, And the pure oil of anointing, both being consecrated, lay them up. Also the censer being placed at the head of the Altar which being kindled and the fire blessed thou shalt perfume every day as often as thou prayest. Thou shalt also have a long Garment of white linen shut before and behind which may cover the whole body and feet which thou shall bind with the like Girdle, Thou shalt also have a headpiece like a mitre made of fine linen In which former part let the plate of metal be fastened25s being Gold or Gilded with the inscription of the name Tetragrammaton all which things after their manner are blessed and consecrated.

And this is the manner by which we may observe whatsoever Sciences and arts Suddenly and Completely with the true enlightening of our understanding although the inferior familiar spirits whatsoever help us to this effect, yea oftentimes the evil Spirits informing us and our senses inwardly and outwardly. And if we would call some evil Spirit to the Circle First it behoveth to consider and know his nature to which of the Planets he soundeth like and what offices are distributed to him from that Planet. These things being known let him look out a place fit for invocation according to the nature of the Planet and quality of the offices of the said Spirit, That if their Power be over Seas, fountains and rivers Then let a place be chosen on the Sea shore and so of the rest, Then let him seek out and find a fit time as well for the quality of the Air, That it be fair, clear, quiet, and ft for the Spirits to take to them bodies: as for the quality and nature of the Planet and Spirit, that he be fortunate or unfortunate on his day or time wherein he govemeth, Sometimes in the night, Sometimes in the day as the Stars or Spirits require. These things considered let a circle be made in the chosen place as well for the defence of the caller as for (89) the confirming of the Spirit, And in this circle the general divine names of God are to be written and those which stand for our defence, And with them the divine names also which govern that Planet and office of that Spirit, Also there shall be written within the circle the names of the good spirits which rule over and can constrain that Spirit whom we intend to call, And if we would more amply fortify our circle, let us add Characters and Pentacles agreeable to the work. And then if we will we may make a figure 205"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet cornered within or without the circle having written therein the numbers convenient as they agree among themselves to our work, which truly are to be known for the numbers and figures sake of which in our Second book of the hidden Philosophy we have sufficiently declared. Afterward let him provide, lights, fumigations, ointments medicines265 for the Eyes, made according to the nature of the Planet and Spirit, which things partly agree to the Spirit because of the natural and heavenly virtue, partly also they are set abroad to the Spirits view for a religious lifes sake or a Superstitions. Then let him provide the holy and consecrated things as well for the defence of the caller and his fellows, as also being necessary for the binding of the Spirits and constriction: Such are the holy papers, plates, pictures, pentacles, swords, sceptres, vestments, of matter and colour agreeable and the like, Then all these things prepared the master standing within the Circle with his fellows, First let him consecrate the circle and all things which he useth which being done with gesture and countenance convenient let him begin to pray with a loud voice after this manner, First let him make his prayer to God, Then let him pray to the good Spirits And if he would read any prayers of Psalms or Gospels for his defence they ought to go before, Then his prayers being ended call upon the Spirit whom he desireth from all parts of the world with a meek and fair enchantment with the commemoration of his authority and virtue, And then let him rest a little while looking round about to see if any Spirit appear. And if the Spirit tarry, Let him reiterate his invocation as is above said unto three times, And if he be Stubborn that he will not appear, Let him begin to conjure him with a divine power So that the conjuration be agreeable to the nature and office of that spirit, Saying it three times over making it stronger and stronger by rebukes, reproaches, curses, and punishments, And by suspending him from his office and power, and suchlike but after every time of conjuring let him rest awhile.

First let him inquire his name, demanding whether he be called by any other name, Then let him proceed farther to ask of him what he would.

And when he is gone go not out of the circle but stay awhile making thy prayers and thanksgivings to God and the good Angels for their defence and conservation: Then everything in particular being done in order thou mayest depart. But if thou art frustrated of thy hope and no spirits appear despair not for this thing: but leaving the circle thou mayest return by other courses doing as at first. And if thou judgest thyself to err in anything, then thou mayest by adding or diminishing correct thine error. For often times the constancy of reiteration doth increase authority and virtue and brings terror to the Spirits, and maketh them humble unto obedience. And therefore some are wont to make a door in the circle whereby they may go in and out, which they shut and open at their pleasure, And fortified with holy names and pentacles Also this is to be known when no Spirits appear, and when the master being rested shall deliberate to give over, because he cannot depart without the license of the Spirit, for many neglecting this are in peril unless they are fortified with some higher defence for very often the Spirits come although they appear not by reason of the terror in the caller or in things which he useth or in the work itself. But such a license is not given simply but by reason of dispensation with (90) suspending them until they are ready to obey in those things. But without circle they are called into sight by that way which is delivered in the consecration of the book. But when we intend to follow and practice some effect by the evil spirits where there is no need of their appearance then that fabrication being made which existeth to us as the instrument or subject of an experiment. As is a image, or a Ring, or a writing, or some Character, or candle, or sacrifice, or any the like Then let him write the name of that Spirit with his character according as the experiment shall require, Or by writing with some blood, or otherwise a conformable fumigation for the spirit: Also oftentimes making our prayers unto God and the good Angels we do call that evil spirit by conjuring him with the divine power. There is another kind of Spirits as we have said in the third book of the hidden Philosophy not so hurtful, Neighbour to men, 207"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet So that they are affected with the same passion of men And rejoice in human conversation, and dwell willingly with them, But others inhabit groves and woods: Others are joyful with the company of diverse living creatures at home and abroad: Others dwell about fountains and green meadows: Therefore whosoever would call these spirits it is necessary to be done in the place where they tarry, with odoriferous perfumes with sweet sounds, with the instruments of music made especially for this purpose Adding Songs and Enchantments and pleasing verses with promises266 and promises. The obstinate are compelled to this by threatnings and Comminations by blasphemies, mocks, reproaches, and chiefly by threatening to tum them out of these places where they are conversant. Afterward if need be thou mayest exorcise, For the chiefest thing that it behoveth to observe in the invocation of these Spirits, Is to have a constant mind and boldness without any fear. Lastly when thou art about to call these spirits thou oughtest to prepare a table in the place of invocation, cornered with clean linen, on which thou shalt put new loaves of bread, And aquavit or milk in new earthen vessels, and new knives: And make a fire in which thou shalt perfume, But go and call at the head of the Table, and let there be seats round about for the Spirits as shall please thee. And those Spirits thou shalt invite by calling unto the drink and meat. And if perchance thou fearest some ill Spirit, write about the Circle and let part of the table within the Circle wherein thou shalt sit calling, Let the rest be without the Circle. In the third book of our hidden Philosophy we have taught how and by what means the Soul is joined to the body, and what happens to the Soul after death: Know therefore that beyond these things which are spoken, Those Souls love their forsaken bodies after death, even as some kindred alluring them Even as they are the Souls of hurtful men which violently have forsaken their bodies: and Souls wanting their due burial which as yet wander in the troubled and moist Spirit about their carcasses. Now these Souls the means being known by which sometimes they were joined to their bodies, the means being known they are easily allured by the like vapours, liquors and savours.

Therefore the most aptest places for these things are Churchyards and these places are better than those wherein the execution of Criminal judgement is made, And these are better than those wherein there is a public slaughter of men in late years, And better is that place than these where some carcasses not as yet satisfied for sins, neither duly buried is violently cast underground in latter years. For the satisfaction itself of the places A holy rite also is duly added to the burial of the bodies oftentimes it forbiddeth (91) the souls themselves to come there and repelleth them to the place of judgement. And from hence it is that the Souls of the dead are not called forth easily, unless it be the souls of them whom we know to be evil and have perished by some violent death whose bodies want due burial. Although unto such places as we have spoken of it would be less safeguard or profit to go to, it sufficeth us to take some principal part of the forsaken body for whatsoever place to be chosen and with it to perfume and perfume267 the rest of the rites. It is also to be known that because certain lights of the Soul are Spiritual; therefore the Artificial lights if chiefly they are made of certain things agreeable composed according to a certain rule with inscriptions of names and signs agreeable, it doth much help for the calling forth of the souls. Furthermore these things which are spoken do not always suffice for the calling forth of the Souls by reason of the natural portion of the mind and reason: which is above heaven and the fates, and known to the only region. Therefore it behoveth us to allure the said Souls by beyond natural and celestial virtues duly administered as by those things which move the harmony itself of the Soul as well imaginative as reasonable and intellectual: as are voices, songs, Sounds, Enchantments, and those things which are of 267 Probably a mis-copying, as Turner gives perform, which makes more sense. 209"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet religion, as prayers, conjurations, exorcisms, and the rest of the holy things which commodiously may be added to these.268 Thus endeth the fourth Book of Cornelius: Agrippa: An invocation to call a Spirit into A Crystal: First say this prayer 0 lord God Holy father and lord God Almighty which hast created all things of nothing And haddest them in mind before they were made, which art from everlasting to everlasting, under whose power Heaven and Earth Hell the Sea and all that in them is be subject and yield all reverence and obedience vouchsafe to hear me thy unworthy servant A And confirm 0 Lord my God that thou hast wrought in me hold forth thy right hand over me, help me for Jesus Christ his sake And send me grace and power to see the Spirit B In this Crystal stone visible to my sight let there be so much light only and only so sufficient light 0 Lord which saidest Let light be made and it was made, That I may perfectly see and behold the said Spirit aforesaid And that he may be made obedient unto me by thy mighty power That he may show me the truth of all such questions as I shall demand of him without all leasing269 falsehood or deceit To the uttermost of his office.

Whenever in that community there was someone or multiple people tortured by cramps and was not free to sleep at night, such a thing was fastened to their neck, and in their freedom would begin to help in such a way that this evil could not strike, which could no longer afflict with cramps those over whose door this incantation had been said.\" 402 \"There was a certain pregnant woman from London tortured with severe colic who passed away and while she lived had a stone over which prayers were said & she did not get better, but would she have carried this [parchment] upon her, even much larger colics would not have harmed her for sure.\" 403 \"To the Villa of Huntingdon came a man who sought relief from spasms that caused him to be as if nailed to the ground with his skin or clothes [?] and he wanted it cut out of his life; as has been said it was made necessary with the disability making him fall on the ground, and sometimes an attack causing him to collapse right onto his face.
