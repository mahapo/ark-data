I know because my professor in Chapel Hill told us back in the early 1960s. According to Professor Wallace Caldwell, it went like this: It was a bright, beautiful, crisp day in late March in the year—or about it—11,304 Before Our Common Era. The place was the hills of Kurdistan. The person who commu-nicated with the goddess was Ugla. Gods and goddesses were mysterious forces that protected and helped people, but they could also be capricious and potentially mean. The important thing was to know what pleased them and stay on their good side.Ugla had spent much of the day gathering seeds of a wild, winter, nutritious grass to go with meat that the men were expected to bring home from their hunt. Johnny, a prepubescent boy, was to help her, as he was not old enough to hunt with the men, although he thought himself ready. Little by little, a stalk here, one there, Ugla gathered the wild rye that she placed seed by seed in a wicker basket that her tribe had learned to make more than 40,000 years before her day. Johnny was more of a hindrance than help. Ugla and Johnny went back in the campsite, where she was attending to the fire, when something marvelous happened. Ugla told Johnny to fetch the basket so that she could crush the seed on a flat rock with a hand-held rock. Her bread would be crude, this being a time before the discovery of yeast, but I have had bread in places in the world that must have been close to that of Ugla’s culinary art.In a series of utterances, what she spoke had a subject (“Johnny”), a verb (“bring”), indirect object (“to me”), and a direct object (“the basket”). Language in its com-plexity predated history. Alas, clumsy Johnny tripped and spilled the basket. Ugla spanked him, hard, and she did so with language her kin judged to be profane if not obscene. Furious Ugla and crying Johnny picked up what seeds they could recover, but the emotion and anger of the moment caused some loss of seed.Five months later, Ugla’s tribe returned to the same campsite, since her tribe followed the annual animal migratory herds as they moved between winter and summer pasture lands. What did she see? She saw grain growing in greater den-sity than she or anybody had ever seen and at the very spot where she spanked Johnny. Quickly she reasoned that the Force was pleased by what had taken place. She regarded the Force to be a goddess, because women bring forth life. Ugla sought to duplicate the scene. In the same basket she gathered the seed grain, much easier now that it was in the same place where Johnny fell. She instructed a recalcitrant, 9780230610644ts02.indd 19780230610644ts02.indd 112/7/2009 3:08:50 PM12/7/2009 3:08:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches2whiny Johnny to spill, purposefully, a basket of the grain. She called him with the same words as before, he spilled it, and she spanked him uttering the same, nasty words. By golly, the good goddess was again truly pleased. The following year, Ugla performed the same ritual, but this time she had Johnny to spread out the spilled seed. And she was able to do this in other campsites, so that there was a small field of grain awaiting their arrival each time. After a period, her clan reached a deci-sion perhaps as late as a generation or two after Ugla, who had duly instructed her female successor about the means to communicate with the goddess. Knowing the ritual that pleased the goddess who caused grain to grow, they reasoned that it was easier to stay in one place: plants are more reliable and less perishable than meat. Agriculture had begun because humans knew how to please the goddess. The ani-mal herds would come by twice annually and, between the migrations, the humans could supplement their plant food with meat from small game and fish. Although from our perspective the agricultural revolution was a monumental technological advance in human history, Ugla’s people thought it was a divine blessing because they had learned to communicate with the goddess and how to please her so that she would continue giving her blessings.How did Professor Caldwell know so much about an event approximately 7,000 years before writing and more than 13,000 years before his time? Professor Caldwell had slitters of fact and from them spun his learned, albeit conjectural, tale. In the flat river areas south of Kurdistan before the grain could be sown in the spring, a priestess spanked a prepubescent boy; the words she used were so archaic that no one knew what they meant. The words were magic, because they forced the goddess to grant them fertile fields. The goddess was more esteemed than any other force and she was given a name. There was a gap of over six millennia between Ugla and the rituals used in Uruk and early Sumer. How do we know that Ugla was in Kurdistan? We found some of the earliest agricultural villages there. Weather?—well, that was conjecture, but probably at that time of the year it was clear and crisp. I suspect that Professor Caldwell made up the names of Ugla and Johnny.By the time humans could write, first in Mesopotamia, a little later in Egypt, the limited number of edible plants that humans could metabolize in their diges-tive tract was already known. The discovery of most food plants can be traced to prehistoric times, with only a very limited number discovered in a historic period. The same, I am led to believe, happened to the medicinal uses of plants and other medicines from animals and minerals. The discovery of medicinal uses began before humans were humans; many of us believe in the evidence of primate and other animal medicinal uses of plants. Animal pharmacognosy is the term we now call animal effective use of medicinal plants. A plant was ingested and found to be a lax-ative; another, placed on a wound, eased the pain, and promoted healing. Animals learned and so did humans who followed. One taught the other as mother teaches daughter and father, son. Unfortunately in the last millennium, we have lost much of what humans learned. In this study some of what we learned and how it changed history will be explored and, equally important, why we lost what we learned.The forthcoming chapters will name some of the most important herbal medi-cines known before history and relate how each plant is intertwined historically so as to alter the course of events. I claim originality, but my stories are built on the 9780230610644ts02.indd 29780230610644ts02.indd 212/7/2009 3:08:50 PM12/7/2009 3:08:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3Introductionwork of outstanding scholars (Sumerologists, Egyptologists, Assyriologists, biblical scholars, classicists, and medievalists) and excellent scientists (botanists, chemists, biochemists, pharmacologists, microbiologists, medical anthropologists, reproduc-tive physiologists, and veterinary and human clinical physicians). These scholars’ and scientists’ talents enable us to understand the historical record through clever chemistry and sharp clinical observations.A score or more years ago, I taught a component in a course on medicinal plants in near-by Duke University’s Medical School. My lectures were those of an histo-rian; in one lecture I told the physicians-to-be about the transmission of the manu-scripts of Dioscorides, the prominent pharmacist whose books were consulted from the first through the sixteenth century. While showing one slide of a beautiful medi-eval herbal, I told them what the plant was alleged to have cured. A student asked: “Well, did it work?” Embarrassed, I replied: historians don’t answer that question. At this reply, he put down his pen with a thud and took no more notes—neither did others in the class. I realized that it was a reasonable question that I had to confront if I had anything to teach them.In the years that followed, I concluded that most of the drugs of ancient West Asia and Egypt were more a linguistic problem of identification than a medical deter-mination. Not until we get to the works attributed to Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, can we reasonable identify most of the plants and other drugs. I identified the plants that the Hippocratic writers used, some 257, and found that 89.5 percent of what they used as drugs are found in modern guides to pharmacy and pharma-cognosy.1 Of the twenty-seven exceptions not found in our pharmacy guides, which the Greeks named as drugs, we consider most to be foods. Two examples of the twenty-seven exceptions: spinach was a drug to the ancient Greeks, but we would not place it in our pharmacopoeia. Why not? If one has dietary iron deficiency anemia (many of us do, myself included), spinach ingested acts like a drug. Another example was water, which no pharmaceutical guide today would call a drug. Why not? Hydration is extremely important for health, and dehydration is treated with water. The leading cause of infant mortality is diarrhea, whose address is hydration. In short, what the Greeks considered to be drugs, we know through our usage to be drugs. This study does not necessarily mean that the ancients used drugs precisely as we do. For example, the Greeks used cannabis to stimulate lactation. To the extent that we use cannabis as a drug, our medical purpose is different. Reasonably, what the ancients knew to be drugs we use as drugs. We use many terms now for herbal medicines—alternative, complementary, natural, among others. Scientists usually call them natural-product drugs, but, in truth, they are products of human learning. In our disregard for the past, we have neglected to learn what our ancient ancestors knew and used to their benefit.As I researched the history of drugs over these many decades, I realized that certain drugs were associated with goddesses, and the realization led to this book. Caldwell’s story about Ugla provides insight about the legends we encounter in these chapters. The stories begin when we have records, artifacts mostly, and legends later committed to writing, but, in time, a happy story becomes sad. In looking for elixir and miracle drugs, Western society associated the goddesses’ special drugs with evil intent and witchcraft. What humans gained in knowledge was mostly lost.9780230610644ts02.indd 39780230610644ts02.indd 312/7/2009 3:08:51 PM12/7/2009 3:08:51 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1Inanna’s Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, and Sexual PowerSome learned thieves caused a catastrophe in Iraq on April 10, 2003. They robbed from and, in other cases, destroyed their and our ancient heritage from the Fertile Crescent. They broke into the archaeological museum in Baghdad, a city “liberated” by American armed forces. The first thieves knew what they were taking, namely the most valuable and transportable artifacts, but, seeing what was taking place, other opportunistic looters joined in the fray by taking and, frequently, destroy-ing ancient artifacts with mallets and clubs. Professor Michalowski of Michigan did not exaggerate when he wrote that this was “a tragedy that has no parallel in world history; it is as if the Uffizi, the Louvre, or all the museums of Washington DC had been wiped out in one fell swoop.” 1 In three days of blatant robbery, the museum lost approximately 15,000 objects; among the treasures lost was a vase that contained key clues about plants, medicine, ritual, and religion. Who were these thieves? We do not know, but an Italian helicopter captured pictures of the loot-ing from a predictably safe height. On April 14, the day after the museum looting ended, the museum’s director saw the devastation and lamented: “It’s gone, and it’s lost. It’s too late. It’s no use. It’s no use.”2However learned the thieves were, they did not know that one of the earliest arti-facts there was a vase from ancient predynasty Uruk, containing a relief that reveals a clue so profound that it causes us to reexamine our understanding of medical botany, family history, ritual, and religion. They did not know; this book proposes to unlock the meaning of the vase. The vase is named after the city of Uruk where it was found near the modern Iraqi city of Warka. (Sometimes the vase is called by the Arabic word Warka, whereas Uruk is called Erech in the Bible.) The so-called Uruk period (ca. 4000 to 3100 BCE) is the predynastic period immediately before the Sumerian culture. The vase contains the clues that connect the legend about Inanna, the Sumerian fertility goddess with the legend about the huluppu tree and pomegranates. Alas, these thieves seemingly unappreciative of history shattered the famous vase. In chapters one and two, I propose to disclose that the Uruk vase 9780230610644ts03.indd 59780230610644ts03.indd 512/7/2009 5:32:09 PM12/7/2009 5:32:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches6displays a profound insight about the biblical Genesis story of creation. The mean-ing of Genesis, the Garden of Eden, and the fall is made clearer by this shattered vase that is dated between 3300 and 3100 BCE, a date more than 2,000 years before Genesis was written and 2,500 years before the comparable passage about Adam, Eve, and the Garden of Eden. The Uruk vase was manufactured and artistically decorated 5,000 years before our time.Before we look at what was on the vase, a few words about how its pieces came back to the Baghdad Museum. The looting, having been allowed—if that is not too fine a word for the circumstances—was the responsibility of the Americans who, together with the museum staff, had to pick up what pieces there were. Art and archaeological dealers worldwide were alerted to look for salesmen bearing the ancient artifacts. Within weeks of the destruction, Col. Mathew Bogdanos (U.S. Marines), a classics major with previous law-enforcement experience, volunteered for the assignment to reconstruct the museum as best he could.3 He declared an amnesty for those returning its treasures and “no questions” would be asked; he even served the customary tea to those returning artifacts. Many pieces were returned, even some taken from the museum shop; among them was the Uruk vase in the back of a pick-up truck. It had been broken, with pieces from its art panels missing. “No questions” meant no information of who took it; we may conjecture the “learned” thieves may have taken it, but, inasmuch as the vase was heavy alabaster more than a meter high, it probably was broken in transit. Doubtlessly realizing that an attempt to sell its pieces was too risky, the thieves (or their surrogates) handed it over to Col. Bogdanos’s men and either no question was asked or it was not reported.4Inanna’s Vase from UrukI saw the Uruk vase, depicting Inanna, goddess of love, when I visited Baghdad in August 1973. The temperature was 50° Celsius (slightly more than 120° F.) in a day before much in the way of air conditioning had reached Baghdad. I think of Gertrude Bell, who died at the age of fifty-eight in Baghdad in the same month dur-ing a heat wave in 1926. She was a wealthy British subject who stopped in Baghdad on the Orient Express train to Iran in 1892 and seldom left Iraq as she developed a passion for the art and history of ancient Iraq. Her collection formed the basis of the National Archaeological Museum; indeed, she designed the building and she restored artifacts. The Uruk vase had been found near the goddess’s temple in a pit of votive offerings, where an accumulation of offerings was collected by priestesses and placed in one pit. Therefore, the vase was not found in situ, hence a more pre-cise dating was prevented.5 The date of approximately 3,000 BCE refers to the pit, not to the date of the objects therein. Little did I realize in the heat of August 1973 that the vase contained information tying the pomegranate to women’s lives, pow-ers, and rights. How a simple plant fruit could change the way we live is a story yet to be told in modern times. Embedded in the story also is our perceived relationship to ethereal powers.Let us begin with the Uruk vase (see figure 1.1). The vase’s base holds the key to Inanna’s power and, with it, women’s rights, but let us start at the top of the vase and move down, frame by frame. The top images were partially broken in 9780230610644ts03.indd 69780230610644ts03.indd 612/7/2009 5:32:10 PM12/7/2009 5:32:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Figure 1.1 Uruk Vase (ca. 3100 BCE) before 2002 looting; top panel, Inanna standing before reed doors of storehouse temple; second panel, processional of offerings; third, rams for sacrifice; bottom, alternating grain and pomegranates.Source: Iraq Museum, Baghdad, Photo credit: Bildarchiv Preussischer Kulturbesitz / Art Resource, NY.9780230610644ts03.indd 79780230610644ts03.indd 712/7/2009 5:32:10 PM12/7/2009 5:32:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches8antiquity. Among the reasons we know that a goddess is indicated is the distinctive headgear with a horn, always the sign of divinity.6 Either the goddess herself or her representative on earth—here an arguable theological point that I shall side-step—stands before her temple (symbolized by reed poles). Before her is a naked servant offering her a basket of fruits while to his back stands a clothed high priest with a sash around his waist held by another servant (see figure 1.1). This person is vari-ously identified as the En, the priest-king of Uruk, or possibly Dumuzi, a god and Inanna’s consort in legend. Quite possibly some or many of those who witnessed the ancient ritual would have conflated the two, En and Dumuzi, in their minds with implicit encouragement from the temple’s priestesses. Behind Inanna are sacrificial ram, baskets of fruit, and two votive vases similar to the one we have—or had before the 2003 looting.The panel below shows baskets of fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural prod-ucts, which would be the first produce as an offering to the goddess who made the land productive. The bearers are slightly plump, to us possibly on their way to a Weight-Watchers meeting, each naked and shaved of all body hair (just as were early Egyptian priests). The next to the last panel shows male and female rams, alternately in a march probably for sacrifice and feasting.Finally, the base and foundation (in more ways than one) underlie the story above. Geometrically the pictures alternate stalks of grain and a limb bearing three pomegranates (see figure 1.2). The grain is easily understood because this practice has continued for these 6,000 years. At the end of the marriage ceremony, the bride and groom are showered with grain as a symbol of fertility. That is, after all, the realm of Inanna, who is often referred to as the Queen of Heaven and Earth.7 From antiquity to the present, the ceremony of throwing grain on the bride and groom has persisted. What varied was the type of grain, such as rye, barley, wheat, and, since the eighteenth century in America, rice, and still more recently, birdseed.8 Indeed, much of the modern marriage ceremony goes back to antiquity: father giving away the bride; bride and groom exchanging vows in front of priest with witnesses; best man; exchange of rings; the ceremonial eating of a wedding cake by bride and groom. The list can continue but without purpose to explain why the nuptial pair is showered with grain and given pomegranates.Equal to grain in the depiction is the pomegranate. If the throwing of grain was an important clue to Inanna, women, and marriage, what happened to the pome-granate, I asked in my class? In the class was an Iranian student who said that in her country on a wedding day, the mother of the bride gave her daughter a pome-granate. Why, I asked the student. “Because it is traditional,” she replied. Why was there continuity in the pomegranate and grain on the vase with present Iranian wedding practices, I asked, and now I seek an answer in this book: simply Googling “pomegranate,” “Iran,” and “wedding,” confirms the current practice of pomegran-ates associated with weddings (and Greek nuptials as well).9 Heretofore, scholars advance no reason for the pomegranates on the Uruk vase, but there is a reason, and it is the key to understanding Inanna’s power. The grain symbolized fertility and the pomegranate symbolized fertility’s control, namely contraception. The symmetry is compelling: grain for fertility; pomegranate for its control, two powers that women would normally desire. Before I offer scientific proof for pomegranates’ contraceptive 9780230610644ts03.indd 89780230610644ts03.indd 812/7/2009 5:32:12 PM12/7/2009 5:32:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"9Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual Poweraction, we will first probe deeper into the vase’s story and relate Inanna’s story as written in cuneiform documents. Denise Schmandt-Besserat, a modern scholar of the period when art evolved into cuneiform writing, argues that around 3500 BCE a “fundamental change” occurred in the use of art for communication.10 Art became linear and was used to evoke a story. The Uruk vase is a prime example of a complex story related through pictures. After all, in today’s world, from our childhood days, we know how vividly pictures in comic strips and books told stories when the words had no meaning to our juvenile eyes.Inanna, Queen of Earth and HeavenPossibly it is Dumuzi, the one with the sash, who stands before her, rather than, as some scholars postulate, the high priest-king, En, the title of Uruk’s secular ruler (see figures 1.1 and 1.2). The fact that his height is the same as that of Inanna (while the servant bearing gifts is smaller) indicates a special, divine status. The top frame of the vase, it is thought, represents Inanna’s sacred marriage to Dumuzi, her con-sort. If we can read backward from the next period of the Sumerians when evidence is more substantial, the common marriage ceremony began with the groom bearing gifts of food and going to the home of his beloved. If the family lets him in, accepts Figure 1.2 Lower panel of Uruk vase showing alternate stalks of grain and limbs each bearing three pomegranates.Source: Iraq Museum, Baghdad, Photo credit: Bildarchiv Preussischer Kulturbesitz / Art Resource, NY.9780230610644ts03.indd 99780230610644ts03.indd 912/7/2009 5:32:12 PM12/7/2009 5:32:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches10the gift, and allows him to spend the night, the marriage is consummated. The next day there was a feast to which many guests were invited. At Inanna’s back the temple door is a storehouse of food.11 Conjecturally as depicted, the ritual is the New Year celebration that acknowledges Inanna’s fertility in bringing fertility to the land and its animals that nourish and serve the people of Uruk.Inanna was the beloved Queen of Heaven and Earth and responsible for life and growth on earth, the fertility of plants and animals as well as humans. From hymns and rituals, we know that Dumuzi symbolized fertility and the renewal of life in the spring.12 Forces of the Underworld killed Dumuzi, Inanna’s groom, and Inanna would search for him in the Underworld, a story we shall shortly relate. Uruk religion asserted that there was a marriage between heaven and earth and life and death, themes carried into Sumerian religious beliefs.13Inanna came to Uruk from the neighboring city of Eridu and tricked Enki, the masculine fertility deity, a phallic representative of fertility, into giving her powers. Subsequently she became Uruk’s central deity. Modern scholars explain the story on the basis that Uruk achieved hegemony over Eridu. Inanna presided over the temple where agricultural production was stored. Indeed, the earliest proto-writings were marks on clay to indicate the types of commodities (usually grain and animals) and the measure of quantities that individuals stored in or delivered to the temple, such as baskets of rye, or rams.14 Inanna’s human representative, a woman to be sure, had a consort (husband?), called an En, who managed the temple’s estates.Modern historians cite Inanna as an indication of a matriarchal society that was transformed into a patriarchal society when, in time, the En functioned as a king and protector of the city, thereby reducing the Lady’s power.15 To interpret the phe-nomenon the spiritual function represented by Inanna became subservient to the function of protection. Samuel Noah Kramer, who worked for decades on the texts surrounding Inanna and Dumuzi, believes that Dumuzi had once been a “mor-tal . . . ruler” whose heroic status continued and elevated him to the status of a deity, as seen in the annual New Year celebration of the marriage of Dumuzi to Inanna.16 The Uruk vase, when interpreted in light of Sumerian myth stories preserved on cuneiform tablets, informs us about Inanna, Dumuzi (or his surrogate), and some rituals, as we read the pictures as one would a comic book without writing.It is from the writing of one particular matrix of stories that we gain our great-est clue about Inanna, pomegranates, contraception, and what the gods thought people should know. Or, better: what people thought the gods thought they should know. During the third millennium BCE, Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of love, was worshipped in temples.17 Who was she and why did she develop a power that made her beloved?Records of Inanna’s StoryThe written story dates from at least the Early Sumerian Dynastic I period (ca. 2900–2750 BCE), which followed Uruk’s predynastic time (3500–3100 BCE), but, being based on oral tradition, likely goes back to Uruk, whose city deity was Inanna. Sizeable fragments of two major Sumerian stories have, happily, survived: one is the 9780230610644ts03.indd 109780230610644ts03.indd 1012/7/2009 5:32:14 PM12/7/2009 5:32:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"11Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerGilgamesh Epic, known to many inasmuch as the story is taught in many schools today; the others are two related stories: “Inanna and the Huluppu” and “Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld.” The last two titles are what scholars have recon-structed from fragments. The University of Pennsylvania conducted four archae-ological expeditions between 1899 and 1900 in the Nippur region of Iraq, then governed by the Ottoman Empire. The expedition uncovered a number of tablets in cuneiform. By agreement, artifacts were divided between the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Orient and the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. It takes a great deal of time to read a tablet, especially one in poor condition. Scholars skilled in cuneiform reconstructed these tablets in a logical order and translated the texts in a little more than half a century. The analogy would be like working on the most complex jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces in places half the world away. The reconstruction of the Inanna story was not to be accomplished until scholars, particularly Samuel Noah Kramer, recognized that a key tablet was in the Yale Babylonian Collection and allowing him to piece together a reasonable reconstruc-tion of the early tale.18 Some scholars (among them Kramer) regard the Descent and Huluppu stories to be later and inferior compositions, compared with the Epic of Gilgamesh. A number of recent scholars consider these stories as part of a unified story and composition.19 In unfolding the story and its meaning, let us begin with Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld, where she gains her power from the huluppu tree, and, in the end, she returns to become a major if not the preeminent goddess of heaven.Inanna’s Descent into the UnderworldThe “Descent of Inanna” to the Underworld tells the story of how Inanna gave up earthly and celestial glory and her family:My Lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the Underworld.Inanna abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the Underworld.She abandoned her office of holy priestess to descend to the Underworld.In Uruk she abandoned her temple to descend to the Underworld.20Diane Wolkstein notes that the theme is a familiar one: separation from fam-ily; progressive regression to a neonatal state; death after suffering; rebirth; and, finally, killing of one person to replace another.21 The gods and goddesses in all the old Mesopotamian texts are not always wise, just, and powerful, but they act like humans—or some humans—: willful, petty, vengeful, and selfish.22 In embark-ing on her self-directed journey, Inanna’s previous accomplishments in life were removed and she was “stripped naked, with nothing remaining but her will to be reborn.”23When Inanna reached the gates of the Underworld, Neti, the gate’s guardian, asks her:Why has your heart led you on the roadFrom which no traveler returns?249780230610644ts03.indd 119780230610644ts03.indd 1112/7/2009 5:32:14 PM12/7/2009 5:32:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches12She gave what appears to be a contrived story: to attend the funeral rites of her sis-ter’s husband and to do service to her sister, but it seems clear that her underlying motive was a journey of discovery and sexual satisfaction. Permitted to enter, Inanna finds seven gates at each of which she must give up things of value, such as jewelry or clothing, beginning with her crown. At one gate she was deprived of her beloved Dumuzi.25 When she passes the seventh gate, she is left “naked and bowed low.”26 At the seventh gate, Ereshkigal (lit. “great lady under earth”) bids the naked Inanna:Be silent, Inanna! It befits the ways of Hades;raise not your voice, Inanna, against Hades’ customs:crouched and stripped bare, man comes to me.27In another fragment of her story (called “Inanna and the God of Wisdom”), she says that her joy is her vulva, her possession in nakedness:When she leaned against the apple tree, her vulva was wondrous to behold.Rejoicing at her wondrous vulva, the young woman Inanna applauded herself.28Other Sumerian texts refer to Inanna’s silver urû (vulva).29 She wore a pectoral named “Man-come.”30 In the Underworld, Inanna eats clay, drinks dirty water, and has no compassion or feeling for others. Although still existing as an individual, Inanna has died. As retold by the Sumerian poets of the third millennium BCE, Inanna sought fulfillment of her feminine powers by a descent into the Underworld, first as an innocent virgin, returning as a mature woman who knew sorrow and had met death. Whereas her family was furious with her for having gone to the Underworld for no good reason, Inanna’s mother’s father, Enki, the God of Wisdom, under-stood his granddaughter, and joined her in the Underworld, because he also under-stood that Inanna was vital for all lands. As Wolkstein observes, “God of Wisdom” for Enki is a metaphysical translation. The Sumerian word can mean “God of the Waters,” and “waters” can also mean semen.31 The sexual connotation, however, was probably not primarily intended to be “wisdom.” At this point, the reader should note for future reference that Inanna met the God of Wisdom in the Underworld when she achieved her power through the huluppu, which facilitated her “rebirth.” She desires to return to the Earth and Upperworld, but “no one ascends from the Underworld.” Inanna is different, the first to be reborn and return from death, but even she must pay a price. She must replace herself, and that she does with her sister Ereshkigal. Her substitute, Dumuzi undertook the cyclical visits to Ereshkigal in the Underworld each year on Inanna’s behalf. It is tempting to infer that the cycle of going to and returning from down-under was an explanation for the cycle of spring-summer and fall-winter, as later explicitly stated in Greek mythology; the inference is only vaguely implied in the Uruk-Sumerian story. So much is told in the tablets known as Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld. Her power came while in the Underworld, as told in “Inanna and the Huluppu,” which begins with Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld. If you are confused by the chronology of “events” of how Ereshkigal was, on one hand, the substitute hostage for Inanna and then appears as the Queen of that hellish domain, keep in mind two things: one, we are 9780230610644ts03.indd 129780230610644ts03.indd 1212/7/2009 5:32:14 PM12/7/2009 5:32:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"13Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual Powerdealing with tablet fragments (albeit some large) of stories, and, second, religion is not always clearly rational to us mortals.Inanna and the Huluppu TreeEreshkigal reacted to Inanna and Enki’s presence with a storm, hurling wind and hail stones, and threatening to devour them. Wolkstein interprets the story to mean the struggle between male and female, but Inanna is given a secret weapon that increases her power, attractiveness, and sexuality. Some modern interpretations con-clude that Inanna and Ereshkigal were once one goddess, embedded as two sis-ters; Inanna became the beloved goddess of the World and Upperworld, whereas Ereshkigal presided over the Underworld. Some of these interpreters see a male dominance in telling and retelling, whereby it took a male to rescue Inanna: Enki, on one hand, and Gilgamesh (as we shall shortly see) on the other.32Inanna’s power was acquired when she gained the huluppu tree, in her sojourn in the Underworld. The poem reads in English translation:At that time, a tree, a single tree, a huluppu-treeWas planted by the banks of the Euphrates.The tree was nurtured by the waters of the Euphrates.The whirling South Wind arose, pulling at its rootsAnd ripping at its branchesUntil the waters of the Euphrates carried it away.33An unnamed woman, probably meaning generic woman, who feared the gods, “plucked the tree from the river” and gave it to Inanna. The generic woman is an important clue, because the tree possessed a power for all women. Inanna spoke:I shall bring this tree to Uruk.I shall plant this tree in my holy garden.Inanna cared for the tree with her hand.She settled the earth around the tree with her foot.She wondered:How long will it be until I have a shining throne to sit upon?How long will it be until I have a shining bed to lie upon?’The years passed: five years, then ten years.The tree grew thick,But its bark did not split.34Inanna wanted a throne and a bed, as Wolkstein surmised, she “wanted the end result—her rule and womanhood.”35 Her happiness was in exercising her sexual powers but, alas, three powers intervened to thwart her power and end her happi-ness. The poem relates how, much to Inanna’s chagrin, a serpent “who could not be 9780230610644ts03.indd 139780230610644ts03.indd 1312/7/2009 5:32:15 PM12/7/2009 5:32:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches14charmed” built a nest in the huluppu tree’s roots, how “the dark maid” Lilith built her home in the tree’s trunk, and how the anzû bird raised its young in the tree’s branches.The young woman who loved to laugh wept.How Inanna wept!(Yet they would not leave my tree.)36The huluppu tree would bear no fruit because of the snake, Lilith, and the anzû bird. In many lines of the poem, Inanna calls upon her brother, Utu, the sun god, and her brother, Ninurta, the valiant warrior, to remove the serpent, the anzû bird, and the dark maid Lilith from her tree, all to no avail. In desperation, she turns to Gilgamesh, “the hero of Uruk, [who] stood by Inanna.” He fastened his armor, well described by the poet, and “entered Inanna’s holy garden.”Gilgamesh struck the serpent who could not be charmed.The anzû-bird flew with his young to the mountains;And Lilith smashed her home and fled to the wild, uninhabited places,Gilgamesh then loosened the roots of the huluppu- tree;And the sons of the city, who accompanied him, cut off the branches.37From the tree’s trunk Gilgamesh carved a throne and a bed for the goddess, Inanna. From the tree’s roots and crown Inanna fashioned a pukku and a mikku for her servant, valiant Gilgamesh. The pukku is likely a ball or puck and the mikku a stick, implements for athletic contests.38 A related passage from a cultic lament (Uruammairrabi) speaks of boys playing with pukkus while girls skip rope.39 The meaning of the huluppu tree is central to this goddess’ ability to be reborn. Already she had discovered her sexuality, so for fulfillment she found the tree’s presence in her garden necessary, and upon it her throne and bed would be built. In light of our interpretation of the tree as an antifertility agent, the tree’s occupants can be reinterpreted.Dark Maid LilithThe Sumerian word, ki.sikil.lí.lá.ke (or, ki.sikil.líl.lá), was translated by Kramer as Lilith found in a Sumerian Gilgamesh fragment. In Assyrian the word is lilītu, fem-inine of lilû, a female demon and enemy of pregnant women who should not come near a baby.40 The Talmud has four references to her, and other Hebrew sources sketch out details lacking from earlier sources.41 She was known as Adam’s first wife whom Adam expelled because she sought to be his equal. In time she became the first witch, in the words of the legend: “She takes her revenge by injuring babies—baby boys during the first night of their life, while baby girls are exposed to her wicked designs until they are twenty days old.”429780230610644ts03.indd 149780230610644ts03.indd 1412/7/2009 5:32:15 PM12/7/2009 5:32:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"15Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerIn the Middle Ages she was known as the first witch. Both in antiquity and the Middle Ages, she is depicted as endangering babies by sucking their blood, eating their marrow, and consuming their flesh. In particular she attacked during child-birth, for which occasions ancient women had amulets to protect against Lilith. Men were not unprotected from her wrath, but they were safe if they slept alone, thus a strong sexual implication goes along with baby-snatching.43Kramer’s identification of the term in the Inanna story and Lilith of later lore is challenged by Sergio Ribichini as being an unmerited assumption. In its place he proposes that the term “Lilith” designated the opposite of fertility, namely infertility and sterility, with the imagery of living in the tree’s cavity.44 Whatever the interpre-tation of the linguistic evidence, the “dark maid Lilith” certainly lends credence to the interpretation of a demon or spirit who captures pre- and postnatal babies.The Anzû Bird as the Water-prevention MonsterThe meaning of the Anzû bird is more difficult. The anzû bird is not identified by modern scholarship, although representations in artifacts somewhat resemble an eagle.45 But another text (Enmerkar and the Lord of Arrata) clearly differentiates the anzû from an eagle:This great mountain range is a meš tree grown high to the sky; its roots form a net, and its branches are a snare.It may be a sparrow but it has the talons of an anzû bird or of an eagle.46The text known as the “Epic of Anzû” connects the birth of the anzû bird with a mountain called Šaršar,47 but this particle of knowledge does not help us to con-nect with the dot in the Inanna legend about the huluppu tree. There is possibly one link that connects the anzû with the huluppu; this occurs in a series of tab-lets on the Sumerian and Akkadian hero Ninurta, god of agriculture and water. Inanna is not mentioned, but variously the Anzû is referenced as a bird and a mon-ster that once was good but turned evil and blocked water. In translation, Ninurta “brought forth the Anzud [Anzû] bird from the halub-haran tree.”48 Halub-haran is phonetically close to huluppu. Elements of other legends are intermixed, including Enuma elish, the Sumerian creation story involving primordial forces of water, and the Gilgamesh Epic.Although modern scholars have not identified the anzû bird with a specific bird, later history may provide clues that the bird was the owl. Ovid says that the person who betrayed Persephone’s eating of the pomegranate seeds was Ascelaphos (see chapter Two on Persephone). For being an informer he was turned into an “ill-omened bird/ avem sparsum” with a beak, feathers, and big eyes.49 The loath-some bird was the slothful screech owl, famed in medieval lore in association with witchcraft. Indeed an old medieval Latin term for witch, scobas, meant in Greek screech owl.50 No direct evidence exists for association of the anzû with either the cuckoo or owl, but then there is no evidence for any type of identification. In chap-ter six, more evidence will be forthcoming to hypothesize the bird as being an owl. The anzû bird represents a force that blocks the watering of the huluppu tree, thus 9780230610644ts03.indd 159780230610644ts03.indd 1512/7/2009 5:32:16 PM12/7/2009 5:32:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches16preventing it from producing its fruit, the pomegranate. The anzû formed a nest in the huluppu’s branches and, when expelled by Gilgamesh, took its young to the mountains.51The SerpentThe reader of the Genesis text must supply interpretation because the serpent’s meaning is not explicit. For interpretation, let us look at the tree’s occupants: the ser-pent could be the general evil toward which fertility and its absence can be directed; the dark maid Lilith is the evil purpose for which abortion and contraception can be employed; the anzû, the means by which the deed was enacted. Much later (as seen in chapter six) was the serpent the personification or representation of the Devil (or Evil) and the bird was the agent of enactment. A study of cuneiform texts and other ancient Western Asian writings and figurines will show that the serpent was commonly related to creation and fertility. The serpent comes from the realm of Mot, the god of the Underworld and death; the contrast is made between death and life, the “tree of life” and infertility, human fertility, and agricultural fertility.52 Although much later in time, when St. Paul, the apostle, was bitten by a serpent, the people’s reaction was that he was an evil man, a “murderer, . . . [thus he should] not be allowed to live.”53What Is the Huluppu and Its Meaning?Let us return to the Uruk vase that has grain and pomegranates in juxtaposition. As a woman Inanna was fruitful—one of her titles was often “Lady of Fruitfulness and Sexuality”54—thus, there was the depiction of grain. Her happiness came with the fruit of the huluppu tree. When she went to the Underworld, she sought not sexuality—she already had that—but an unfulfilled desire for happiness that she found in the power imparted by the fruit of the huluppu. The fruit was, I propose, the pomegranate, because she could not possess a woman’s power and happiness until she could control her fertility by contraception. First, let us look at the evi-dence for huluppu as pomegranate.Sumerologists speculate on the translation of huluppu, the date palm and willow having been suggested.55 Some scholars, such as Marvin A. Powell, doubt that a secure identification can be made.56 On the other hand, reference to a tree called the huluppu is found in various texts, including Assyrian, thereby demonstrating that the word was not literary imagination. The huluppu tree (variant transliterations as haluppu and hiluppu) grew on a plantation in the Harran region ca. 700 BCE.57 Certainly the date palm (which will be discussed in chapter two) is the most com-mon tree in Mesopotamia, and there is ancillary art work that associates the date palm with Inanna.Other examples of the huluppu tree occur in various tablets that state that chairs, pegs for a chariot, tables, and bowls are made from it. Everyday physical items should rule out the hypothesis that the tree is legendary. The possibility of its being an oak tree is proposed based on its use for carpentry objects and the fact that another word for oak is not identified in the texts.58 Probably oak grew in ancient Mesopotamia.59 9780230610644ts03.indd 169780230610644ts03.indd 1612/7/2009 5:32:16 PM12/7/2009 5:32:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"17Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerAn Old Babylonian text refers to ha-lu-b’a as a term for furniture, and it is pro-posed as meaning oak.60 Still the huluppu wood is never used for the construction of boats,61 a fact that suggests that oak is highly unlikely. Moreover the objects made from the tree are small, allowing the possibility of a small tree or large shrub. A text of a religious ritual casts doubt on whether it was a date palm, because date palm is specified in addition to huluppu: “by means of seven date palm [branches], seven huluppu [branches] and seven . . . .”62Inanna’s NameThorkild Jacobsen proposed that Inanna is from the name Nin.an.na meaning “Lady of the date cluster.”63 Helgard Balz-Cochois advanced a new interpretation of Inanna’s journey and her name. She takes a clue from the epitaph applied to her, nu.gig, usually translated as “courtesan,” “prostitute,” or “hierodule,” for those more classical-minded. NU means “sexual” and GIG “sickness.” Thus Inanna is nu.gig.an.na, implying menstruation. The meaning is not fertility per se, as is the usual association of Inanna, “the fertility goddess,” but the menstruating goddess, one who can be fertile or nonfertile.64 The fact that the pomegranate produces sex hormones could, depending upon the circumstances of the patient or recipi-ent, the dosage, and the timing, be a substance that either contravenes fertility or promotes it.Pomegranate as Huluppu TreeThe identification of the huluppu tree as a pomegranate has not been considered. The pomegranate is a small tree or large shrub (approx. 15 feet high) and could be the source of wood for chairs, tablets, pegs and bowls, just as the rhododen-dron shrub (approx. the size of a pomegranate tree) in North Carolina serves as the material for furniture. An Old Babylonian text from Ur mentions a pomegranate giš.nu.u’r.ma.la’ l.da’r) beam three meters long.65 The pomegranate grew in south-ern Babylonian orchards together with date palms and apples, all three being used for wood.66 One Assyrian prescription associates pomegranates (giš.nu.ur.ma) with love magic: “If (he is in his seventies and) hu-qu (gasping respiration) continually afflicts him (and) he asks for pomegranates (giš.nu.ur.ma), he will die.”67 (The preword “giš” means “little tree.”) The meaning for this warning is too vague for speculation except to say that the pomegranate was associated with love and, in this case, with death for a male in his 70s.68 The translators say that the context is love magic, but its meaning they place in the appendix of “unsolved puzzles.”69 The existence of an Assyrian term, giš.nu.ur.ma, for pomegranate does not impeach the thesis that the huluppu is also a pomegranate tree and, in the case of this “unsolved puzzle,” the context was sexual. Also recipes using pomegranate, using the same cuneiform, were given orally for difficulty in urination and another urinary prob-lem for which translation is lost in the text.70 The legend about Inanna dates back to the predynastic Uruk period before the Sumerians came and much later than the Assyrians (Early Empire period, 933–782 BCE). A different word for the same plant would be expected over a span of 2,000 years from late Uruk and early Sumer to 9780230610644ts03.indd 179780230610644ts03.indd 1712/7/2009 5:32:16 PM12/7/2009 5:32:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches18the Assyrians. Because huluppu was central to the legend, the Sumerians kept the word; religious texts had some literal meaning, we conjecture, for the Sumerians, as it does for Christians, Jews, and Muslims today.Pomegranate as ContraceptivePublished in 2003, research on gynecological disorders in Chhattisgarh, India, reported a “birth control measure” in “common practice” by using pomegranate seeds for prevention of conception. Women in Chhattisgarh ground the seeds into a powder, mixed in sesame oil, and placed the mixture in the vagina just after the menstrual cycle.71 A cuneiform recipe from Aššur refers to the application of pome-granate to wool, which was placed in the vagina.72 We suspect that the text indicates that it was not to cure a woman’s disease, as a translator previously suggested, but for use as a contraceptive pessary (i.e., vaginal suppository). The lining of the uterus will absorb many chemicals, whereas oral administration can often block pathways to absorption.In 2006, thirty-six scientists, mostly biochemists and medicinal chemists, pub-lished in a single volume a number of extensive projects on the pomegranate.73 The pomegranate (various parts, including seeds, roots, and fruit pulp) contains a number of estrogenic compounds, primarily 17β-estradiol, estroil, and estrone. The compound having the most bioactivity is 17β-estradiol. Women’s ovaries and placenta secrete estrone and estradiol. Pomegranates have “a relatively high con-centration of bona fide naturally occurring estrogens,” to quote from one study.74 Estrones are currently used in contraceptives, among which is the most common oral contraceptive that has estrones and progesterone, another hormone that pre-vents implantation. Current research on pomegranates as a therapeutic agent is as a replacement or alternative to hormonal therapy for menopausal and postmeno-pausal disorders.75 Thus the common contraceptive pill in America is a combination of estrogen (to disrupt ovulation) and progestin (to prevent implantation). Either compound is a contraceptive, but the combination is a double protection to achieve the desired result—the safe prevention of pregnancy. A similar study (2006) deter-mined that pomegranate juice has the three “classic estrogens, estadiol, estroil, and estrone” which had “an effect on vaginal maturation, an indicator of physiological effects” in a search to find a safe postmenopausal therapy. After a week in clinical trials, the study showed “a significant increase in estrone at a nonphysiologic level in postmenopausal women.”76Other studies point to the pomegranate’s contraceptive effects. In experiments conducted during the 1970s and ’80s, female rats fed pomegranate (Punica grana-tum L.) and paired with male rats not so fed had a 72 percent reduction in fertility. Pomegranates fed to guinea pigs resulted in a 100 percent prevention of pregnancy.77 Forty days after withdrawal from pomegranate as a dietary additive, the fertility of both animal groups returned to normal.78 Still another experiment with rats had a 50 percent reduction in fertility.79 In analysis, other parts of the plant (seeds, roots, whole plants) had no appreciable effect on fertility; only the fruit skin around the seed lowered it.80 One test shows that pomegranate root has substances that inhibit fetal growth by nearly 100 percent.819780230610644ts03.indd 189780230610644ts03.indd 1812/7/2009 5:32:17 PM12/7/2009 5:32:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"19Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerThe same use as that in ancient Mesopotamia and modern India is verified in other ancient medical writings. A pharmacist’s vademecum (portable reference guide) has this line: “Seed of haluppu. Plant for a woman who does not get preg-nant.” Disregarding the vowel, this is the pomegranate seed, and this tablet, along with the iconographic evidence, confirms the thesis that huluppu in the Inanna story was a pomegranate and was used as a contraceptive. Prescriptions for prevent-ing pregnancy and for abortion are found in various Assyrian texts, but with the two inscriptions that we have, the meaning of the plant taken is unclear: “ú munus nu peš4 for a woman not to get pregnant”; “ú šá - , m i a r h u š šu b - e . . . to make fetus drop.”82 When prescriptions in cuneiform tablets point to contraceptives and abortifacients, for example, “to prevent childbirth,” Jean Bottéro, a French Assyriologist, dismisses the claims as “magic” or “exorcistic’ therapeutics.”83 Bottéro is incorrect: they were real. Magic would, at best, be a placebo or psychological effect, but, if one takes a substance to prevent or end a pregnancy and full term births occur, one knows full well it did not work.Several recipes in Middle Assyrian tablets prescribe pomegranates (nu.u’r.ma) together with cedar resin for tinnitus treatments (“roaring” in the ears), suppu-rations, and bleeding from the ears. Pomegranate juice has a haemostatic action and is also antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antiviral, and an expecto-rant. In translating these texts, modern investigators concluded that the recipes for pomegranate juice would have been effective according to modern science.84 In the next chapter, Greek medical usages of the pomegranate as a contraceptive will be presented.Phytochemistry and Pomegranate’s AlterationA general rule in phytochemistry is that chemical compounds may concentrate in one particular part of a plant at various times in the growth periods, but traces may be present throughout. One example is opium, which is concentrated in the poppy ovary during only one stage of growth. Various experiments with pomegranate reflect differing results, which can be attributed to any number of variations. The point is that modern scientific experiments show that the pomegranate inhibits fertility in animal populations. In the Inanna legend we identify the huluppu tree with the pomegranate and the pomegranate as a contraceptive. The pomegranate in ancient myths is associated with fertility as we shall see in the next chapter. The pomegranate was a prominent symbol of the goddess of love in ancient West Asia.85 Religious ritual clearly connects Inanna with the pomegranate. An incan-tation in cuneiform shows that Inanna was associated with the pomegranate and the apple:1 [Incan]tation. The beautiful woman has brought forth love.2 Inanna, who loves apples (giš.haš.hur) and pomegranates (giš.nu.u’r.ma)863 Has brought forth potency.4 Rise! Fall! Love-stone, prove effective for me!

On either side stand pomegranate trees.90 From the same panel is another scene, this one of the Sumerian god Sin-Annar standing between a pomegranate and a palm.91 A gold plate from Ras Shamra of the same time period shows the god as a bull, representative of Baal, with a border of pome-granates.92 A wall-hanging from Nimrud datable to the kingship of Shalmeneser III (858–824 BCE) has a similar scene with pomegranates prominently displayed.93 A magnificent piece of gold-silver alloy jewelry was found in a grave from the seventh century BCE in Kamiros. It shows a naked female figure, likely Ištar or Aphrodite; from it hangs pendants of pomegranates.94 Two roll cylinders, one from the period of the same king, Shalmeneser III, show the double representation of the king facing a pomegranate tree, each with a pomegranate in hand at the end of a shaft going to a god. The other cylinder comes from Aššur, is dated from the ninth to the seventh centuries, and represents a similar scene, except that the winged spirit of the king that stood behind him in the first cylinder is now at the pomegranate tree.95 Other reliefs, such as one from the palace of Sargon II (721–705 BCE), represent the king with pomegranates in his left hand.96 An Assyrian tablet describes a god’s knees as being pomegranates (nu.u’r.ma).97 In Mycenean, Etruscan, and Greek art the pome-granate was frequently depicted on pendants, pins, vases, and reliefs, including a number of vases showing Athena carrying a pomegranate.98Friedrich Muthmann proposed that the pomegranate was identified with the fertility deities because it was the symbol of fertility and with kings as the earthly agent for the same.99 By the Neoassyrian period, the symbol of the pomegranate may well have been for fertility, but we propose that earlier it symbolized fertility control and probably did in the Neoassyrian and later periods. A Neoassyrian incantation demonstrates the point: 7 Incantation. If a woman looks upon the penis of a man. 8 Either a giš.hašhur [apple?] or one giš.nu.u’r.ma (pomegranate): 9 You shall recite the incantation three times either to an apple or to a pomegranate. Give (the fruit) to the woman (and) have her suck their juices.10 That woman will come to you (and) you can make love to her.100Retold by modern scholars, the incantation was a love-charm. Our point is that it had meaning beyond the power of words and charm. The effect was real according to modern science expectations, given its chemistry. Hašhur is usually translated as “apple” but, as we shall see in chapter three, there is doubt about hašhur’s mean-ing.101 In chapter three, another meaning will be proposed for the Sumerian word hašhur and Akkadian hašhuru.Before love-making in the Hebrew Song of Songs (8:2) a woman wishes to give to her lover mulled wine and fresh pomegranate juice.

As the daughter of Suen and bride (or consort) of Dumuzi, Inanna’s conception was ritually reenacted in the Sacred Marriage Rite in temple services.105 It began with soft music, while townspeople gathered to watch the king, incarnated as or representing Dumuzi, copulate with a beautiful woman, as the goddess Inanna. While to us moderns the ritual was erotic, to them it was a solemn religious ritual to begin each New Year in the hopes of pleasing the god and goddess who would bring bountiful crops, adequate food, peace, and happiness. A terracotta bed on four legs, dating from the Third Millennium BCE, depicts what is thought to be the Sacred Marriage and with words taken from a hymn to Inanna:The people of Sumer assemble in the palace . . . So that the New Year’s Day, the day of rites,May be properly determined,And a sleeping place be set up for Inanna . . . The king goes with lifted head to the holy loins,Dumuzi goes with lifted head to the holy loins of Inanna.He lies down beside her on the bed.106The king was an avatar, a representative as it were, of the good god Dumuzi. His responsibility was to carry out his manly duties and properly satisfy the priestess, who was Inanna’s representative. Around the year 2000 BCE, or more than a mil-lennium after the Uruk Vase, a Sumerian poet used words to this effect:The rivers flowed fresh water,In the field grew rich grain,The sea was filled with carp and . . . fish,. . . The forests were filled with deer and wild goats,The orchards were filled with honey and wine.107For these good things to happen, the king had to maintain a state of erectile func-tion in plain view of his people to carry out his royal duty. Although the Uruk vase does not show, of course, actual copulation, the earliest “sure evidence for ritual 9780230610644ts03.indd 219780230610644ts03.indd 2112/7/2009 5:32:18 PM12/7/2009 5:32:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches22copulation between goddess and ruler,” assumed to be representing Dumuzi, comes from Ur III during the early dynastic period.108 One imminent scholar of the period, W. W. Hallo, believes that part of the ritual’s purpose was actually to produce an heir as a product of the king and divine descent from the goddess. In Hallo’s words: “the sacred-marriage[’s] . . . object was to produce a royal heir and to establish his divine descent; . . . [it was a] real act.”109 One must conjecture that behind the scenes events may have occurred when that statistical reality of a single act did not produce the desired results, but royalty and governments have a long tradition in deception.Inanna and ProstitutionToday’s woman takes estrogen to prevent pregnancy or, wishing the same and need-ing medical intervention, she takes estrogen. Thereby, we should not call Inanna, Ištar, Demeter, and the like, fertility goddesses but fertility-control goddesses.The story of Inanna’s sojourn in the Underworld is, in Balz-Cochois’s opin-ion, that of a premenstrual girl finding her sexuality along with menstruation.110 I add this interpretation: that is why the possession of the huluppu tree was her first endeavor. In Inanna’s exhortation when Gilgamesh restored its control to her, she explained,My father has given me the Me: [Me = civilization; domestication]. . . He gave me godship.. . . He gave me truth.. . . He gave me the art of lovemaking.He gave me the kissing of the phallus.He gave me the art of prostitution.111The god Enki said to the people of Uruk:Inanna brought the Me:She brought the placing of the garment on the ground.She brought allure.She brought the art of women.She brought the perfect execution of Me.112The “perfect execution of Me” recalls how the priestess from the “temple of love” transformed Enkidu in the Gilgamesh epic from a wild man who ran with the ani-mals to a civilized person who wore clothes and lived in houses kept by the priestess from the “love temple.”113 Some biblical scholars tied Adam to Enkidu, who, while not the first man, nonetheless was made of clay and lived in a purity of nature with wild animals.114 In the Gilgamesh Epic, Enkidu was transformed from a wild man who ran with the animals to a civilized person.115 Some biblical scholars tied Adam to Enkidu.116 Like Enkidu, Adam lost his innocence when he ate of the forbidden fruit, that is to say the pomegranate. Both Enkidu and Adam were unwittingly transformed from innocence to responsibility and hardship. The agent of Enkidu’s transformation was a prostitute and of Adam’s reversal a serpent through Eve’s enticement. The lasting result for humankind was sexuality, pain, and clothes.9780230610644ts03.indd 229780230610644ts03.indd 2212/7/2009 5:32:18 PM12/7/2009 5:32:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"23Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerDate Palm as Huluppu TreeIn part, my interpretation does not rest on whether the fruit was a pomegranate, although pomegranate is the better case, bordering on certainty. Other trees are suggested as possible identifications of the enigmatic huluppu. One other candidate, date palm, has qualities similar to the pomegranate. The case can be made for the huluppu tree as a date palm. The inscription of Inanna making her bed and throne from the tree’s wood is more compatible with the palm than with the pomegranate, which is a small tree or large shrub. The iconography of early pictures supports both the date palm and the pomegranate as probable identifications. In reliefs, jewelry, and other artifacts of the ancient world, the pomegranate often was associated with the palm.117 In addition to those representations of Inanna with the date palm pre-sented earlier, there are more examples. Among them is a stele of Ur-Nammu, from Ur, dating from the Third Dynasty, ca. 2050–1950 BCE. The King Ur-Nammu (identified by inscription) pours a libation over a date palm before a goddess on the left. The two deities (shown in the picture) wear the multiple-horned miter and distinctive robe and sit on a throne in the form of a temple. One goddess gestures toward the king and gives him a rod and ring, symbol of earthly power, perhaps corresponding to the pikku and mikku in the story. Symbolically the king is the gar-dener to the goddesses.118The date palm has contraceptive qualities. Interestingly, the date palm was one of the first plants that caused modern science to realize that plants produce compounds that stimulate or replicate sex hormones in mammals. In 1933 Adolf Butenandt and H. Jacobi first reported plant estrogens. The plant they reported as possessing “female hormones” was the date palm, a scientific fact since verified.119 In 1939 Butenandt would receive a Nobel Prize in chemistry, but not for the small arti-cle he wrote in 1933 on the date palm. The date palm, he and Jacobi reported, had a compound that they called α-follicle hormone similar in action to human female hormones. What they were describing was an estrogenic compound. Estrogen, of course, is a hormone that promotes or interferes with fertility depending upon tim-ing and amounts.One problem about the date palm as the tree indispensable to Inanna is that very little use of the date palm as a fertility-limiting agent can be found in antiq-uity. The Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1550–1500 BCE) has a prescription using date palm that is for “loosening a child in the belly of a woman,” which can be translated more likely as an abortifacient than as a contraceptive (although both are possible interpretations).120The Babylonian Talmudic treatise Sabbath has a probable mention of date palm as an antifertility plant. The discussion concerns drugs that are forbidden on the Sabbath. A “man,” however, may eat any kind of food “as a remedy” or drug except water of palm trees and a cup of roots “because they are [a remedy] for jaundice.” The cup of roots is clearly abortifacient as is mentioned a number of times.121 The rabbis explain that water of palm trees is so called because it is spring water that issues from between two palm trees, with one rabbi saying from two different kinds of palms. The rabbis explain that palm water is drunk because it allows the gall to function but it must be taken for forty days.122 The forty-day treatment would 9780230610644ts03.indd 239780230610644ts03.indd 2312/7/2009 5:32:18 PM12/7/2009 5:32:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches24explain why it was allowed to be drunk on the Sabbath. The “water of palms” is unclear unless one postulates that it was a water extract from the palm. If the rab-binical explanation was incorrect in identifying the substance as merely water com-ing from between two palms and if, instead, the water of palms is a water extract from the palm tree, the Mishnah was speaking of a contraceptive plant. Reasonably, the rabbis were unaware of the pharmaceutical preparation when they loosely defined water of palms.Still the Talmudic passage and the single recipe in the Ebers Papyrus are meager indicators for what, if the thesis is correct about the huluppu tree, must have been a widespread practice. Let us propose that the tree may first have been a date palm (as is indicated by some physical evidence), but that the pomegranate’s superior contra-ceptive effects gradually replaced the palm. Still the earliest representation from the second quarter of the fourth millennium, as mentioned before, was the Uruk vase as votive offering to Inanna with pomegranate clearly depicted. In time, the represen-tation of the fruit associated with the “love” or “fertility” goddess in ancient West Asia may have changed from the date to the pomegranate.Even Kramer’s proposal that the huluppu tree might be a willow should be rejected. R. Campbell Thompson, a noted scholar Assyrian of botany whose pio-neering efforts are no longer considered definitive, identified esi (variant, ú-su-ú, esu) as meaning willow; also the plant is called the hand of Ištar, Ištar being the Assyrian equivalent of Inanna.123 And it was used in a pessary for a female disorder, likely for stimulation of menstruation,124 a common and ancient circumlocution for abortifacient.On the other hand, huluppu occurs in a list of vessels containing drugs and is associated in another Assyrian text as a drug for sorcery125 and in yet another text as being in the same class with tamarisk, laurel, pomegranate, fir, willow (şarbatu), and palm.126 One Assyrian text has huluppu in a beer drunk for childbirth.127 Dioscorides and other classical ancient medical writers say that the willow was a contraceptive, and modern science has verified the ancients’ assertion.128Laurel was known as an abortifacient.129 Thompson’s identification of the huluppu in the Assyrian texts, however, must be understood as tenuous at best, because of the difficulty in ascribing plant nomenclature across the time periods of Old Babylonian or Sumerian, Assyrian, and modern. Evidence clearly suggests that the Assyrian huluppu is regarded for its female pharmacy.Ancillary evidence exists to show that the peoples of the ancient world knew of the accidental abortative effects of ergotism, a toxic condition caused by a fungal microorganism that grows on various plants, most readily on types of rye. From around the seventeenth century of our era, ergot was used as an abortifacient. Ancient peoples knew of its devastating effects. When it contaminated bread supplies, entire communities suffered its effects, essentially the same as the synthetic LSD as the modern acid is derived from this biological fungus. The medieval name for the phenomena was St. Anthony’s Fire. It is likely that premodern populations did not deliberately employ ergot except in specific rituals and fertility suppression.130Ergotism strikes during certain seasons and requires a cold winter. Robert Biggs found passages in cuneiform texts that indicate that the ancient peoples, by keeping records of weather conditions, foresaw plagues or infestation periods when problems 9780230610644ts03.indd 249780230610644ts03.indd 2412/7/2009 5:32:18 PM12/7/2009 5:32:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"25Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual Powerwould come. A chief characteristic of these periods was miscarriages. A seventh-cen-tury (BCE) text foretold: “There will be recovery for sick people in the land; pregnant women will carry their fetuses full term.”131 And, more ominous: “There will be an epidemic of li’ bu-disease in the country; pregnant women will not carry their fetuses full term.”132 In Greek literature there are many allusions to a disease of sterility.133Temple ServiceJust the same, the evidence as we know it gives meaning to the idea of the young woman seeking protection and control as she enters maturity, the period of mating and childbearing. Herodotus (see below) and numerous other ancient sources, some biblical, describe in various detail how the “love temples” were places where males went to worship through sexual liaison with a priestess or even a priest. The sexual activities transpired in fertility goddess’ temples throughout the ancient ages those of Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Babylonians, and other ancient peoples; occasion-ally even the Hebrews alluded to them in as many biblical passages, especially the Book of Jeremiah II.134OverpopulationThe Atra-Hasīs Epic is an Old Babylonian story about the gods, creation, and early humankind; the text is found in a version written approximately 1600 BCE that tells of how the gods saved humans from a series of draughts, starvation, soil exhaus-tion, and disease induced by human overpopulation. After consulting with his fel-low gods, Enlil announces: “But the people are not diminished./They have become more numerous than before.”135 The gods’ purpose in sending the flood was to rescue humans from overpopulation. This second creation, later retold in Genesis as the Noah story, was the gods’ benevolent means of saving humanity from too many people to compete for resources. The Sumerian Flood story relates the distribution of duties to the gods Sin and Nergal: “[You should] guard the middle earth./[But you let] loose abundance for the peoples.”136 A. D. Kilmer’s study of the Atra-Hasīs text within the context of other myths concludes:That limiting the population by “birth-control” should have been conceived by the mythographer as the original motivation for certain cult practices is unexpected, to say the least. The practices to which I refer, and which are known from many contexts, are chastity or celibacy, or methods of intercourse that would avoid pregnancy.137Of course, the avoidance of pregnancy is contraception. In light of the evidence, we should no longer refer to the Mesopotamian institutions as “love temples” or “fertility cults,” but we should speak of them for what they were: fertility-control temples and cults.The instructions that women received in the fertility-control temples and the birthing temples probably were practical and had to do with information that they would need for their marriages. Namely, they learned how to be happy and to make their husbands the same, how to plan the family, and, presumably, how to 9780230610644ts03.indd 259780230610644ts03.indd 2512/7/2009 5:32:19 PM12/7/2009 5:32:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches26care for the children they wanted. The women in the temple knew secrets they taught to the initiates.138 The secrets were those learned by Inanna in her sojourn in the Underworld and by those women who followed her in a struggle against the serpent who could not be charmed, the dark maid Lilith, and the Anzû bird. Since ancient women learned about the huluppu tree, women approached maturity and marriage with joy and fear, the latter brought on by the threat of childbirth. Ancient women learned the secrets from priestesses who knew the ways to control reproduction. Modern women have similar controls. Just as with Inanna and her ancient followers, modern women have forces in their societies that seek to remove their use of birth control knowledge. Eve and Inanna are closely connected to modern women.Herodotus and Sacred Temple Prostitution in Inanna’s CourtHerodotus wrote about his travel to Assyria about 440 BCE or, at the very least, he says that he went there, and modern scholars do not disbelieve him on the extent of his travels. In the context of his Assyrian travels (he refers to the people also as Babylonian) he said that he would not tell everything that he saw, predicting that most of his audience (and readers?) would regard many of the stories as made-up.139 One wonders then why he included the description of young Assyrian women who had to endure intercourse with the first strange man who asked. Herodotus describes the scene:The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land once in her life to sit in the temple of Aphrodite [Greek for Sumerian Inanna and Assyrian Isthar] and have intercourse with some stranger . . . Most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the stranger men pass and make their choice. When a woman has once taken her place there she goes not away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, “I demand thee in the name of Mylitta [Μύλιττα140] (that is the Assyrian name for Aphrodite).”141After explaining that the amount of money was immaterial to the transaction, he explains,So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects none. After their intercourse she has made herself holy in the goddess’s sight and goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfill the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four.142Herodotus’ Greek audience (we are presuming that his text was publicly read) must have laughed at that passage.9780230610644ts03.indd 269780230610644ts03.indd 2612/7/2009 5:32:19 PM12/7/2009 5:32:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"27Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerSome scholars in recent years challenged the interpretation of temple prostitu-tion despite Herodotus’s account to which is added testimonies of numerous ancient sources, predominantly among them are Strabo, Eusebius, and above all many notices in the Hebrew prophets.143 Julia Assante argues that the Mesopotamians did not regard prostitution, temple or secular, “as a profession because sex was not considered to be a learned or specialized skill.” Some words translated as prostitute, Assante believes, were adult females who did not live with their fathers, some of whom were chaste and others designated as knowing the penis.144 I find Assante’s position unlikely because the weight of the textual evidence sustains the early exis-tence of females whose livelihoods were sexual favors, which is the definition of a prostitute.145 Stephanie L. Buden presents an even more recent and thorough study than Assante. Her well-documented book’s thesis is expressed in the first sentence: “Sacred prostitution never existed in the ancient near east or Mediterranean.”146 About Herodotus’s Babylon account, Budin compares similarities between Babylon’s alleged customs with the Greek Thesmophoria (to be discussed in chapter two). Budin’s documentation of well-reviewed passages produces a scholarly tome with so many qualifying nuances than, when one has digested her arguments, one is left with a mixed, highly qualified definition of what is “sacred” and what is “pros-titution.” A full review of Budin’s work by Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, herself a researcher on the subject, places Budin in the Herodotus is in the “Liar’s school.”147 Herodotus was, she believes, making an exaggerated comparison “between Greek sacred and sexual moeurs” with its largely imagined opposite practices of the effete easterners.148 Regarding Budin’s revisionist position, her reviewer says, “Budin’s analysis does not end the debate.”149My interpretation pomegranate thesis gives more veracity to Herodotus and the numerous other ancient accounts. By the second millennium, long after the Uruk vase and Inanna legend, prostitution existed; some of it was connected to temples whether within the temple confines (as most texts suggest) or contractual with the sexual workers paying to the temple a tithe (as Assante believes). Assante would discount Herodotus’s statement that money was incidental to the woman’s intercourse.How It HappenedTo the ancient Greeks Herodotus’s account was probably titillating wonder. To us moderns, all of this seems bizarre, even perverted. In private letters, bequests, and other written tablets in cuneiform (e.g., Sumerian, Akkadian, and Assyrian) on clay, we see a family-oriented society that valued clear bloodlines for the transmission of property through wills.150 A woman, who visited a paramour, was put to death, as well as the paramour, and a woman who had sexual relations with a man in a brothel was subject to severe punishment by her husband. These measures, immoderate to us, were Mesopotamia’s way of protecting the family.151 This concept is in strong opposition to families’ requiring their premarriage daughters, presumed virginal, to have semipublic intercourse with the first stranger who requests her in the name of the Good Fertility Goddess.9780230610644ts03.indd 279780230610644ts03.indd 2712/7/2009 5:32:19 PM12/7/2009 5:32:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches28A fragmented tablet, dated 1727 BCE, relates an extraordinary and seemingly contrary view of virginity: in 1737 BCE a man and woman contracted marriage, but the groom-to-be renounced the obligation. If he could prove his betrothed to be sexually active, he was free from a hefty fine if he jilted his bride-to-be. Alderwomen examined the woman and found her innocent of grounds for her fiancé’s charges, but the nature of the charges was unspoken. If we interpret the meaning beyond mere slander, we must assume that he accused her of sexual activity that the committee of women refuted.152 Assuming the modern interpretation is correct, a woman was expected to be virginal at the time of the wedding. If we view correctly this tablet and initial sexual contact in temple service, we may conclude that the first inter-course in Inanna’s service did not “count.” The criteria with which the alderwomen examined the women are not explicit.We know that temples functioned for a variety of purposes (e.g., storehouse for foods, banking, social meals) in addition to giving the gods their due recognition through rituals to be performed. They were also health clinics. For example, in Egypt a woman nearing birth would check in to the temple. Similarly, in ancient Mesopotamia, temples provided health care as part of their function. A deity might be associated with a distinctive specialization.153 In Mesopotamia, the greatest healing deity was Gula (“great”), the goddess of healing; she was the patroness of physicians. The center temple was at Isin, where she was known also as Ninisina (“Lady of Isin”); her temple was associated with obstetrics and care of neonatal infants (but not to the exclusion of general illness and injuries).154 Royal inscrip-tions and tablets attest to the goddess’s role in caring for people, notably women, for example:She shall be the lady of joy and prayer hastening to the cry (of the people) . . . She shall loosen the band of disease, the distress of tribulation,She shall be the counselor, the seer, the magician, the purifier of all things.155And another hymn, having many copies (which make the date of its composition beyond our means), has the goddess speaking in the first person:I am a physician, I can heal,I carry around all (healing) herbs, I drive away disease.I gird myself with the leather bag containing health-giving incantations,I carry around texts which bring recovery,I give cures to mankind.156Did temple midwives administer parturition at home, or did the near-term woman simply check into the temple? The home was where most therapies were admin-istered, but, at least for the Sumerian period, women nearing birth checked in to the temple where they received obstetrical care from the priestesses who served as midwives.157 A broken Old Babylonian text reads in translation:In the house of child-bearing woman in confinement,let brick be laid [a common obstetrical apparatus], seven days.9780230610644ts03.indd 289780230610644ts03.indd 2812/7/2009 5:32:19 PM12/7/2009 5:32:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"29Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual PowerLet Dingirmah be honoured, the sage-femme Mani,Let the midwife rejoice in the house of she in confinement.Whenever a child-bearing woman will give birth,Let the mother make . . . a baby by herself.A male.158One tablet surviving from a king suggests that a pregnant woman (possibly but not clearly the queen) was brought to the temple of Gula. The broken text does not clarify whether the birth took place there.159 The archaeological remains of healing temples do not provide enough clear evidence as to whether the rooms were for nurs-ing or other temple functions, including examinations.160Generally Sumerologists believe that in third millennium BCE the temple’s administrative staffs organized and regulated most work (chiefly agriculture-related), and women were an important part of the work force.161 Impeding our understanding of everyday women’s role is the dearth of scenes of daily life on the reliefs and figurines and other artifacts from early Mesopotamia.162 In all of the Neo-Babylonian tablets translated, there are approximately 50,000 names of people, but roughly only 2 percent are women.163 Mostly these would be roy-alty or slaves. In short we know little about Mesopotamian women. It is mostly through private tablets that we gain information about this subject. As expressed by L. Delaporte, a professor in Paris of ancient Mesopotamia, “for every event of public or private life their [priests and priestesses] good offices were invoked.”164 Myths are generally (always?) gradual and creative deteriorations of what actually happened.165 Let me propose a means of making sense out of these stories and artifacts.ConclusionThe earliest foundation inscriptions found at temple buildings, according to Leonard King, are of a “practical rather than of a purely religious character.”166 Just as the Sumerian society provided schools for boys who learned reading, writing, arithme-tic, and other skills to enable them to function in a complex business society,167 let us conjecture that women also were provided some “finishing school,” to borrow from a much later American phrase. From the early Assyrian period, we know that women lived in and around temples; some were called naditu, literally a “fallow” woman or the “chaste one.”168 Naditu women were associated with a temple. Some have interpreted the term to mean prostitute or one thrown down and surrendered to a god,169 but they appear to be chaste or, at least, childless. In ways beyond our capacity to understand either in the Sumerian, Akkadian, or later Assyrian societ-ies, we learn with incredulity that some naditu married but had to remain childless, while others were members of a sisterhood as an alternative to marriage, similar to nuns or, better, beguines of medieval Europe. Comparative anthropology reveals that in south Indian Devadasi culture, there were similar temple prostitutes (“slaves of the temple”): high-born women married the temple, were encouraged to have sexual intercourse with “worshippers,” but had to remain childless. To be sure, these comparisons are with different cultures and time-periods, but the practices shed some light on a dark subject.1709780230610644ts03.indd 299780230610644ts03.indd 2912/7/2009 5:32:19 PM12/7/2009 5:32:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches30Beatrice Brooks studied cult functionaries and remarked that, if all the Akkadian words that have been translated as “prostitute,” “harlot,” “whore,” and “hierodule” were to be believed, an improbable percentage of the population was engaged as “either secular or religious prostitutes of some sort.”171 That said, an understanding of the historical problem is necessary to understand the relation-ship between temple prostitution, contraception, and the pomegranate. A simi-lar word, nu-gig means “temple prostitute,”172 whereas kar-kid (alt. kharimutu) meant simply prostitute.173 According to Merlin Stone, the Mesopotamian nadītu essentially ran the business of the temple, from accounting by scribal writing to numerous business and practical details of running the temple. Earliest examples of writing (ca. 3200 BCE) were tablets written by women (nadītu) in Inanna’s temple, where payments were registered for land rentals.174 The archaeological findings of Sumerian temples and nobility and common houses, unfortunately shed little light on the organization of the temples, except that the earliest ones seemed complex, self-contained, walled units, but how people related to them is not revealed in the dust and bricks.175 Buttressing Herodotus’s account is an asso-ciation and word for Inanna in Sumerian and Akkadian. Inanna was called the “Divine Lady Owl” from Sumerian dnin-ninna.176 The Akkadian word for owl is eššebu, and a number of lexical texts give the synonym for “Divine Lady Owl” as Kilili, a name also for Inanna (or Ishtar [Ištar], Akkadian for Inanna). A prostitute goes out at night like an owl. The Sumerian counterpart of Kilili is Abashushu that means “harlot.”177 Therefore in the early Sumerian period Inanna was associated with prostitution.Let us conjecture: under the temple’s auspices, women would be taught the essentials of keeping a household, such as household management, pregnancies, birthing, and raising children, in ways similar to the informal functions of wom-en’s convents in the Middle Ages. Included in such instruction was how to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, which may have included, if Herodotus is believed, a sacred trial intercourse under the good goddess’s auspices and her blessing. In this way, a woman was then ready to be wed. Whether Herodotus and other sources were correct or not, the period of temple service would have been schooling for life’s marital and even extramarital experiences. Never would she, her parents, or wooers fear pregnancy by a ritualized but real act. I can think of no alternative interpretation except this one: women learned in the temple how to take pome-granate to prevent pregnancy. To a modern layperson, the knowledge seems simple: take some pomegranate. But how much, what parts, frequency, administered how, when, in relation to the menstrual cycle? All these questions require an empiri-cally derived knowledge of what, in our terms, is hormonal regulation. Estrogen, whose production pomegranates stimulate, can have the effect of enhancing fertil-ity or denying it, depending upon dosage and timing of administration according to the menstrual cycle. Does it make sense for a society that values family, loves daughters and sons, and wants clear blood lines for transmission of name, reputa-tion, and property to the next generation to allow, nay require, its daughters to have sexual commerce with the first stranger who asks even though the action takes places in the temple’s precinct? No wonder that Herodotus, a Greek, would 9780230610644ts03.indd 309780230610644ts03.indd 3012/7/2009 5:32:20 PM12/7/2009 5:32:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"31Huluppu Tree, Pomegranates, Sexual Powernot understand but he recognized a tantalizing tale when he saw one. The tale about how Inanna achieved her feminine powers through the use of the huluppu’s tree fruit, the pomegranate, preserved the story about how women came to control their reproduction.Jean Bottéro gives another interpretation of the Herodotus account; he believes Herodotus erroneously stated that all women had to do temple prostitution duty. He regarded ancient Mesopotamian society as one of “free love,” by abundance of prostitutes (male and female, incidentally), thereby still protecting the family unit from males seeking gratification. Herodotus, he said, “mistakenly thought they included all the women of the country.”178 Bottéro believes that “it is prob-able that certain prostitutes, if not all of them, often went to sanctuaries, espe-cially those of their protectress Ištar [ I n a n n a] . . . [a nd e xerci se d] t hei r profe s sion there.”179 Bottéro chooses to ignore (or disbelieve) a critical part of Herodotus’s account: “and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her” after she returns home from the temple. In other words, the intercourse event was a once in a life-time occurrence. Assante’s explanation is better: there was no temple prostitution as such. Most scholars today believe that prostitutes gave a part of earnings to the temple but there were not fertility rituals by the historic period.180 This is to say that the fertility rituals were not what they were in the Uruk, pre-Sumerian, or even early Sumerian period. Even if Bottéro is correct, especially regarding prostitution in Babylonia when Herodotus visited, contra-ceptive knowledge would be a virtual necessity for these prostitutes (large in number, he concedes) to serve all sexually active males and to remain pregnancy free. I doubt his theory but, even were it so, my hypothesis remains valid: the temple of Inanna is where women learned to protect themselves through effective contraceptives, and the most effective contraceptive of their time was the pome-granate. Moreover, we learn that usually nadītu women were forbidden to have children, and others had to remain chaste in ways we cannot begin to under-stand.181 The mother of Sargon, the King of Akkad, was a priestess (entu) and forbidden to bear children, as Sargon said, “My father I do not know. . . . My city is Azupirānu [literally ‘Saffron’], which lies on the bank of the Euphrates. My mother, a high priestess (entu) conceived me, in secret she bore me.”182 Perhaps it is coincidental, but probably not, that saffron was a known contraceptive plant in classical medicine.183One is reminded of the comment made by the Byzantine historian, Procopius (sixth century CE), who described a well-known prostitute: “Naturally she was fre-quently pregnant, but by using pretty well all the tricks of the trade she was able to induce immediate abortion.”184 Procopius probably understood specifically “the tricks of the trade” and why prostitutes did not bear children at about the same level as in Herodotus’ findings. Unless there is compelling evidence, the historian should accept his written sources. In this case, Herodotus probably recorded a combined account of what he saw and was told. Herodotus did not understand how to bring together these fragments of knowledge, other than ancient that Mesopotamian women were instructed in Inanna’s temple about the power of the pomegranate, the fruit of the huluppu.9780230610644ts03.indd 319780230610644ts03.indd 3112/7/2009 5:32:20 PM12/7/2009 5:32:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches32ChronologyStages of CivilizationPeriodDates (all BCE)Hunters and gatherersLate Paleolithic15000Beginning of agriculture and early farming villages Epi-paleolithicNeolithicUbaidEarly Uruk12000–70008000–40005000–38003800–3500Bronze Age beginsMiddle Uruk3500–3200Early cities in MesopotamiaLate Uruk and approximate3200–3100Development of writin gDate of Uruk Vase3200–3100Sumerians and first city-states (e.g., Kish, Nippur, Ur, Lagash)Early Dynastic IEarly Dynastic IIEarly Dynastic IIIAššur (small city state)2900–27002700–25002500–23502500Akkad and AkkadiansEarly fragments of Gilgamesh and Inanna Legends on tablets (legends pre-date tablets)Sargon I2334–21602150–20002334–2279Ur III period and Sumerian revival2119–2004First Babylonian DynastyHammurabi1894–15951792–1750AssyriaIndependent stateAssyrian power13001000–612Source: Adapted from tables in Robert Chadwick, First Civilizations: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Eg ypt. 2nd ed.

[Revised Standard Version cited unless otherwise noted.]Already raised is this question: is there a connection between Inanna (who was in the Underworld with the god of knowledge, and her possession of the huluppu tree) and Eve, the serpent, and eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge? In a word, the answer is “yes,” and it will take much of this chapter to explain why. As I set out in chapter one to explain, Inanna and her association with pomegranates dates back at least to late Uruk (ca. 3200 BCE), and that Inanna and the huluppu (pomegranate) probably existed in legend to at least that time. If the tablets are later than the vase, you ask, how can we know that the legend as told in the tablets dates back any earlier than the tablets? The way we know is found in the art of philology.

Preliterate societies are fairly good at transmitting knowledge, better often than literate societies whose minds are trained in information storage and retrieval, not memory. Genesis 2: 4b-25, including the passage above, covers the creation of man and woman, the Garden of Eden, and Fall, and the Tower of Babel. Scholars refer to the section as “J,” named from Jahwist (or Jehovist from Hebrew Yahweh = YHWH); throughout the section this name represents a human-like God. Its composition (roughly in the form that we have as transmitted) dates from as early as Israel’s early monarch (ca. 950 BCE and later incorporated into the Torah (ca. 400 BC). A number of scholars see evidence of com-position in the pre-exile, exile, or early restoration period, known as the Babylonian Captivity (ca. 600 BCE- 516 BCE= rebuilding of the temple).1 Certainly—and, yes, that is the correct adverb based on sufficient evidence—the early sections of Genesis dealing with Creation (1:1–2:4a), probably composed in the post-Exile period, and “J” source, were written after Jewish familiarity with Mesopotamian cultures. Before the Exile, the Jews in Palestine would have heard of Asssyrian expansion to their northeast. Through the victory of the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadezzar (r, ca. 605–561 BCE), Judea became part of or subjected to Babylonian rule; in 597, the Judean King Jehoiachin was forcefully deported to Mesopotomia alone with his court and retinue, numbering in the thousands, thus beginning the so-called Babylonian Captivity. After a subsequent rebellion Nebuchadrezzar destroyed the temple in Jerusalem (586 BCE) and exported more Jews. After forty-eight years in Mesopotamia, the Persians under Cyrus the Great conquered Babylonia and allowed the Jews to return. An important detail is that not all Jews were exiled, many remain-ing in Palestine, and, once those in Mesopotamia were freed to return to Palestine, some remained in their new homes between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers. Just the same, many Jews rejected Babylonian culture, religion (e.g., polytheism), and societal conventions (e.g., ritual and temple prostitution, as in Jeremiah), but, importantly, they also absorbed some of its conventions and legends; some Jews greeted Cyrus as being “anointed” by God (Isaiah 45:1).In imagery, language, and context the creation story has parallels with the Sumerian Epic of Creation (Enuma elish; Atra-Hasīs), the “ladder” (Gen. 28:12) with the Mesopotamian Nergal and Ereshkigal myth, the “Sons of God” with Ugaritic “Sons of God” or “Sons of El,” and the Noah Flood story with Ziusudra, the Sumerian hero of the Flood (also called Utanapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh).2 9780230610644ts04.indd 349780230610644ts04.indd 3412/7/2009 3:10:02 PM12/7/2009 3:10:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"35Pomegranate as Eve’s AppleAn example of association (or borrowing) comes from the Sumerian myth of Adapa and the Flood of Life, where: “He [Ea, the Father God] granted him [Adapa, his son] wisdom, but he did not grant him eternal life”3—the same punishment that Adam and Eve receive for disobedience. Without exhausting the list of parallels between the Torah’s content and Mesopotamian culture, and before we examine how the pomegranate relates to and, indeed, is the “fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,” permit me a few words about reading the “Bible.” Scholars use the Greek word exegesis (“to explain”; “to interpret”) so that they can try to understand the author’s meaning within the context of his culture and eisgesis (“to interpret” in light of one’s own meaning and time).Analogy is the weakest form of argumentation; I begin with analogy. Lynn White, professor of medieval history at the University of California, Los Angeles, was at home in the early 1960s—he told me, thus only orally transmitted until now—when a telephone call came from the producer of the movie version of “Camelot.” Prof. White was asked to be the historical advisor for the movie version of the Broadway play. He gave a short introductory lecture on the historiography of the Arthurian legend: if there had been a King Arthur, he would have been a sixth-century Britano-Roman who defended his region against the invasion of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.The name Arthur may appear in a short passage in Gildas’s work (mid-sixth c.) and then not again until Nennius’s late tenth-century mention. Notably the name is absent in intervening histories such as the one by the Venerable Bede. Around 1100, Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote a history of British kings, in which he took legends, probably mostly in old ballads no longer extant, and possibly but unlikely, some lost written works and wove together an exciting narrative history, so exciting that the Romance epic writers from the mid-twelfth through the thirteenth century used the stories of the knights and ladies of the Roundtable, the stories that inspired the adaptation of a musical based on T. H. White’s novel (1958) the Once and Future King. Professor White explained that there were so many layers that it would be impossible to advise historically on such a movie: what costumes would they wear, sixth c., ninth c., twelfth c. or thirteenth century and more to the point, what values would they espouse, the masculine roughness of sixth-century warriors or the gen-tlemanly behavior of Gawain, Yvain, Lancelot, and Perceval, and ladies fair, such as Genevieve, who were treated by a new knightly code called chivalry? Since those medieval poets, almost every generation has produced literary works (and, more recently, motion pictures) using the Arthurian matrix. From my youth the values have changed with each retelling (viz. Mary Stewart); the most recent novels and movies that I have seen reflect the political correctness of the late twentieth century (such as a respect for diversity). Professor White summarized by saying “go ahead and make the movie because there is no way to make it historically accurate.” When the movie appeared, he was credited as its adviser but, in his words, the honorarium was so large that he dared not protest.In interrupting the Genesis’ “J” component, we need to go beyond the exegesis but not to exclude an understanding of its meaning to us in the post Roe-versus-Wade era. By going beyond, we gain some insight into its meaning; we study various 9780230610644ts04.indd 359780230610644ts04.indd 3512/7/2009 3:10:03 PM12/7/2009 3:10:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches36thinkers and the general culture, from the time of its composition to today, especially the Talmudic opinions, Latin and Greek Church Fathers, and medieval scholastics. The Qur’an (4:1) alludes to the Garden of Eden story, but with no explicit mention of a fruit, tree, or disobedience. The author of the “J” component of Genesis was obviously exposed to Mesopotamian lore, but the Hebrew author reverses some Uruk and Sumerian values. In so many ways the Hebrew religion was asserting a new, anti-Mesopotamian direction. Religion embraces politics, so has it always been. In Genesis, God is a single male and not the principal deity as a fertility god-dess, as the deity in Uruk and the cultures that followed. In Genesis, even the birth of woman comes from a man, Adam’s rib, and Adam gave Eve her name, thereby demythologizing the Sumerian stories about Inanna’s creation.4 A geographical catalogue of the rivers that form from the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2: 10–14) includes the Tigris and Euphrates. The issue in “J” is the state of innocence in the Garden, God’s prohibition of eating the fruit of knowledge without an explicit statement as to why it was forbidden, the temptation, the meaning of the serpent, the entice-ment of Eve and subsequent enticement by her of Adam, and the expulsion from the Garden, the liability of death, the pain of childbirth, and, to the consternation of many moderns, the subjugation of a wife to her husband: “he shall rule over you” (Gen. 3: 16).Eve as First WomanThe name Eve for the first woman comes from the Hebrew word h.awwâ because she is “mother of all living (hay).” Etymologists, however, cannot connect with cer-tainty Eve’s derivation with the root h.yh, meaning “to live.”5 In Sumerian cuneiform symbols the word for “life (til)” also means “rib (ti),” allowing a double meaning of Eve as the Mother of Living and Mother of the Rib.6 Through Ugaritic and Phoenician, some philologists have tried to connect Genesis’ Eve with other female fertility deities of Ancient West Asia, including the Akkadian goddess Mami and, inferentially, the Sumerian Inanna.7 Mami was also known for her midwifery skills and, according to one study, she shared qualities with Eve and Pandora: each was involved in creation stories that account for the origin of evil.8 The author of the Garden of Eden story may have associated Eve with a foreign fertility goddess, but even if not, the point is that the Genesis retelling secularizes her as human and of one flesh with Adam.9Genesis 2:9, 17, describes the tree as “the tree of learning,” “that which is to be known,” or “the knowledge of good and evil.” The Hebrew stem yd` is not only “to know” but “to experience, to come to know.” The delicate phrasing, compared with similar idiomatic expressions in the Bible, implies that Adam and Eve could not distinguish “good and bad,” as they knew not the shamefulness of their naked-ness, until the forbidden fruit. The learning of physical aspects of life, accord-ing to biblical scholar E. I. Speiser, leads to the mystery of sex.10 Another scholar, J. Coppens, regards Eve’s transgression as sexuality tempted by the serpent, a phallic symbol (later to be discussed).11 If the fruit was the pomegranate and its meaning contraceptive, Genesis “J” ’s meaning is even deeper. All the more, Eve is connected with Persephone who discovers the secret to thwart a man’s will to force pregnancy. 9780230610644ts04.indd 369780230610644ts04.indd 3612/7/2009 3:10:03 PM12/7/2009 3:10:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"37Pomegranate as Eve’s AppleGod in Genesis and Zeus in Greek myth are equally angered by the woman’s (before godliness) discovery of a god’s secret.In placing Adam and Eve in the Garden, God’s one prohibition was “thou shalt not eat” of the “tree of knowledge of good and evil.” The temptation that comes directly from the serpent is later associated with the devil, but the association was made by later writers.12 The pseudoepigraphic writing, “Life of Adam and Eve” (ca. first century CE) and known in Latin and Greek (no Hebrew), has little informa-tion about what it calls “the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” but in it the devil is a separate god who uses the serpent as a tool to achieve his objective to cause humans’ downfall.13 The “J” author provides us with no reason that the serpent was the tempter, but delivers it a compliment: “more subtle than any other wild creature that the Lord God had made” (Gen. 3:1). In Palestine there are thousands of fer-tility figurines, usually a naked woman with a serpent entwined around her neck. Also the serpent is frequently depicted on cup handles and other artifacts made by the ancient Hebrews.14 To the ancient Sumerians and Egyptians, as well as to the Canaanites—the Jews’ likely intermediary source—the serpent was a fertility symbol,15 but the “J” source for Genesis does not make fertility explicit. Indeed, the serpent’s function relates to the structure of the narrative as a means to unfold the action; because of its cultural familiarity, the serpent was convenient, not the central point: the point is humans’ disobedience to God that causes the “fall” from grace and the loss of immortality and innocence. In eating the forbidden fruit, humans obtained knowledge of good and evil, an act of hubris that implies equality or even rivalry with God. The snake in the roots was the near-universal symbol in the West Asian ancient world of evil, immortality, and sexuality.16 The snake was associ-ated with fertility themes in ways that are obscure. The Aramaic word for serpent, h.ewyā, is related to the Hebrew word h.awwâ, meaning Eve, and it is connected to the mother goddess Asherah T.annit.17 The Hebrew word for serpent has the same root as the word for life.18In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the plant of life was stolen from Gilgamesh by a ser-pent, foreshadowing the Genesis story.19 One interpretation is that the serpent symbolized reoccurring youthfulness or immortality, perhaps through its rebirth process in shedding its skin. As a combination of wisdom and chaos, the serpent sought to persuade men to become gods.20 Another interpretation of the serpent in Genesis and Mesopotamian usage (or, at least, non-Israelite) is that the serpent was a phallic symbol.21 The Genesis writer, however, did not know Sigmund Freud. John L. McKenzie interprets the serpent’s role in Genesis 3:14–19 as “nothing else but that sexual life is a curse to the woman.”22 Of course, Genesis’ meaning may not be the same as in the Inanna story, but, whatever its meaning, Inanna was dis-turbed by the presence in her tree of the serpent “who could not be charmed.” In Genesis, the serpent lured Eve into eating the apple, she lured Adam, and they both discovered their nakedness and were expelled from the Garden. St. Ambrose, like most Latin Christian Church Fathers, saw no particular meaning in the fruit except that it imparted reason, understanding, and knowledge, whereas before eating it Adam and Eve were “naked because of the purity of their virtue.” Being a misogy-nist, Ambrose saw particular fault with Eve; her deception cause Adam to fall “by his wife’s fault, and not because of his own.”23 The Church Fathers understood 9780230610644ts04.indd 379780230610644ts04.indd 3712/7/2009 3:10:03 PM12/7/2009 3:10:03 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches38the lesson to be one of human innocent purity and then disobedience. The “fruit” could have been anything that God could have used to unfold humans’ disobedi-ence and fall.Tree of LifeThe pomegranate is frequently named the “tree of life” on Neoassyrian seals, thus the correspondence between Genesis’ “tree of knowledge” 24 Just the same, the Genesis passage makes a clear distinction between the tree of life and the one of knowledge, of good and evil.25 There are two trees in the Garden, one the tree of life, the other the tree of knowledge and evil (Gen. 2: 9). A recent study of the archaeological records that represent the tree of life demonstrates that, far from being mythical, the Egyptian lotus plant was the tree of life but, in time, its contact with the gods grew dimmer.26 The Genesis theme centers on the tree of knowledge and evil, but the tree of life is mentioned once more after the expulsion from the Garden and the Fall. In Gen. 3:22, the narrator refers to the tree of life to say that, after having eaten the forbidden fruit of the knowledge tree, humans would have gone on to sample its fruit and gain immortality: “Then the Lord God said, ‘Behold the man has become like one of us, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.’ ” Whether or not the tree of life was conflated with the huluppu tree is not directly pertinent to the Genesis story. The “J” author of Genesis distinguished between the two trees. He employs the tree of life as a supplementary or ancillary point about why humans must suffer and die. The essence of the story is how people came to be as they are.The immortality theme ran throughout ancient culture just as it did in the much-earlier Gilgamesh Epic (date circa 2700 BCE), where the hero sought immor-tality from the plant of life (“this plant is a plant apart from any other”) at the bottom of the sea.27 The supposition is that Gilgamesh’s “plant of renown” was the ubiquitous “tree of life.”28 Gilgamesh said, “I will give it to the old men to eat. Its name shall be ‘The Old Men are Young Again,’ and I shall eat it myself and have all my lost youth.” Gaining the plant of life by diving to the sea bottom, he encoun-tered “a serpent . . . [which] rose out of the water and snatched it away and immedi-ately sloughed its skin and returned to the well.”29 Long before the Greek tragedies, Gilgamesh was guilty of hubris, “overweening pride,” and he was duly warned by a god, only to have a serpent rob him of it. Siduri, the goddess of the garden of the sun, said to him:You will never find the life for which you are looking. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping. As for you, Gilgamesh, fill your belly with good things; day and night, night and day, dance and be merry, feast and rejoice. Let your clothes be fresh, bathe yourself in water, cherish the little child that holds your hand, and make your wife happy in your embrace; for this too is the lot of man.30No evidence points to the Genesis “J” author’s having direct knowledge of the Gilgamesh Epic as we have it preserved on tablets, but the story line was part of the 9780230610644ts04.indd 389780230610644ts04.indd 3812/7/2009 3:10:04 PM12/7/2009 3:10:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"39Pomegranate as Eve’s Applegeneral culture of Ancient West Asia. As evidence of familiarities and similarities, Siduri’s advice is repeated virtually the same way in Psalms 113:117 and Ecclesiastes 5:18, 8:15, and 9:8–9.31 The tree of life is peripheral to the Fall; it appears to account for man’s mortality within the author’s purpose to discuss why humans, in disobey-ing God, were punished and expelled from the Garden. The issue unfolds around the prohibition of eating from the Tree of Knowledge, the Forbidden Fruit. What was its meaning?Fruit of the Tree of KnowledgeThe fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was special: the pomegranate. Why were pomegranates prohibited? Some scholars place only symbolic value in the actual fruit because by their interpretation humans disobeyed God—to St. Augustine and other later Church Fathers accounting for “original sin”—so any prohibited rule was as good as another, such as “don’t step on cockroaches.” The Genesis meaning of “to know” goes with “good and evil,” but good and evil what? Biblical scholar, Howard N. Wallace summarizes the scholarship with three interpreta-tions: (1) a claim of the right of self-determination, a form of human maturity, that some extend to assumption of god-like powers; (2) knowledge of sexual rela-tions; (3) access to universal knowledge.32 Most scholarship holds the second position, sexual relations, simply because the Genesis author before and imme-diately after the introduction of the prohibition of eating the fruit of the tree placed first the innocent nakedness of Adam and Eve and thereafter the shame for the same. Other scholars believe that the fruit imparted magic, a rival power of God, but such an interpretation is neither explicit nor implicit. Adam and Eve were naked and innocent, a point of emphasis, and, after eating the fruit, they were ashamed and clothed themselves. The knowledge was not physics or math-ematics (although in a way, it was biology). Elaine Pagels recently went right to the point: “The tree of knowledge conveyed carnal knowledge.”33 Biblical scholar John Skinner used these words: “the tree of knowledge, whose fruit excites the sexual appetite and destroys child-life innocence.”34 Immediately after eating the forbidden fruit [Genesis 3:7]: “Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.” Adam and Eve were not tempted to know the laws of nature, thereby rivaling God, but to know one specific area: sexuality and reproduction. J. M. Evans, a scholar of the ancient world, wrote: “The use of the phrase ‘to know good and evil’ elsewhere in the Old Testament35 suggests that the kind of knowledge prohibited to them was scientific rather than ethical in character.”36 Evans is correct; the knowledge was scientific and pertained to reproductive physiology.Did the author of this Genesis section know that the fruit of the tree of knowl-edge was the pomegranate and, if so, did the author know that the sin in question was contraception and reproductive power? The next three successive sections will show that the fruit was the pomegranate, that the pomegranate became a symbol for the early Jewish people (thus was popular and well-known), and, finally through Greek mythology, we can postulate better the meaning to its author of the story in Genesis.9780230610644ts04.indd 399780230610644ts04.indd 3912/7/2009 3:10:04 PM12/7/2009 3:10:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches40Pomegranate as Fruit of the Tree of KnowledgeIn folklore, art, and literature, the fruit is usually named, described, and drawn as being the apple. An apple it was not, even though the Middle English transla-tion of the apocryphal Vita Adae (“Life of Adam”) identifies the fruit as an apple: “He forbade Adam an appel-tre.”37 In Hebrew the apple is tappûah. (Ugaritic, tph.) that means a “gold-colored fruit” of some kind,38 but Genesis (2:16–17; 3:2) uses a term for generic fruit.39 The Greek Septuagint translated the term into καρπός (or Roman, karpos), generic for fruit.40 Although apple (Malus domestica Borkh./ M. pumila Mill.+ sp.) is often the translation, the apple does not grow in Palestine, Turkey being the southern-most limit in the modern period.41 Because also there are other terms designating it in biblical works, the common apple is unlikely the fruit named in Genesis.42 Curiously, in all the ancient art of West Asia, the apple was not to be depicted.43 Chapter one notes that the Sumerian word hašhur and Akkadian hašhuru, translated as “apple,” was not the common domesticated apple that we today eat to keep the doctor away.Various other candidates that fit the description of “gold colored” have been suggested: citron (Citrus medica L.), quince (Cydonia ablonga Mill.), and apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.).44 The “fruit” well describes the apricot, but it is unlikely to have been known in biblical times, possibly not being introduced until Roman times.45 Overlooked is the candidacy for the pomegranate as Eve’s apple.46 Its fruit is yellowish-brown and its name in Latin means “grained apple” (pomum= apple or generic fruit; granum= grain, seed). The common English phrase “comparing apples to oranges” is uncommonly wrong, because for long periods of history “apples” were any generic fleshy fruit; such as the orange (Citrus sinensis + spp.) was called pomum de orange and the lemon was pomum medicum (“medical apple”). Pomegranate is an English corruption of “grained apple” from pomum granatum and, interestingly, from this base-word comes “hand grenade” due to its similar appearance to the fruit.Pomegranates as Symbol of JudaismThe pomegranate was an important symbol in early Judaic religion. Aaron’s high priest’s robe’s skirt, “all of blue,” was bordered with “pomegranates of blue and pur-ple and scarlet stuff, around its skirts, with bells of gold between them, a golden bell and a pomegranate.”47 The later Jewish scholar, Philo (ca. 20 BCE–50 CE), described the high priest’s robe in his time as having a pomegranate fringe.48 In the later Song of Solomon (4: 3, 13; 6:7), the pomegranate flower was a symbol of spring. The calyx of the fruit was the motif for the crowns of the Torah in decorations.49 Like no other fruit, the pomegranate was central to Judaic imagery. Josephus (Antiquities of the Jews. 3. 7. 4) repeated the description, but, in Wars of the Jews (5. 5. 7), Josephus (writing c. 75–94 CE) added an interpreted detail: the bells signified thunder and the pomegranates lightning.50 Likely, Josephus’s interpretation is based on the play on words, rimôn, Hebrew for pomegranate, and Rimmôn, a god wielding the thun-derbolt.51 The Israelites and early Christians held to a tradition that when Adam was leaving the Garden, he cut a branch from the Tree of Knowledge to form a rod, the same rod that Moses would later carry.529780230610644ts04.indd 409780230610644ts04.indd 4012/7/2009 3:10:05 PM12/7/2009 3:10:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"41Pomegranate as Eve’s ApplePomegranates and the Promised LandWhile wandering in the Wilderness of Zin (probably between the Dead Sea and Gulf of Aqaba), the Israelites said to their Lord:[Numbers 20:5] And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines [grape], or pomegranates.Indeed the Land of Palestine, the “Promised Land,” was characterized as where grain, figs, grape, and pomegranates grew:[Deuteronomy 8:7–8] For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills,[8] a land of wheat and barley, of vines [grape] and fig trees and pomegranates.Far more than a refreshing fruit with a sweet juice, pomegranates were special to the Jewish people.53Pomegranates and the Temple in JerusalemBefore the front door of King Solomon’s temple was two free-standing columns, eighteen cubits high, adorned with pomegranates in two rows round the capital as on a bowl, four hundred pomegranates per row with two rows.54 The description in I Kings is[7:15] He [referring to Hiram of Tyre] cast two bronze pillars. Eighteen cubits high [that is, about 27 feet] was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits mea-sured its circumference; it was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers; the second pillar was the same. [16] He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of one capital was five cubits; the height of the other capital was five cubits. [17] Then he made two nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals upon the tops of the pillars; a net for the one capital, and a net for the other capital. [18] Likewise he made pomegranates; in two rows, round about upon the one network, to cover the capital that was upon the top of the pillar. [21] . . . He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin; and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Bo’az.The architecture of two columns standing before a temple can be dated back to as early as approximately 1500 BCE where two pillars stood before the temple at Byblos. Later coins show two columns before temples in various locations in ancient West Asia. The pillars’ names, Jachin and Bo’az, lead philologists and other scholars from one theory to the other with no consensus among them for many centuries. The symbolic meaning has even more proposals, ranging from phalli, trees of life, obelisks, and twin mountains. To the confusion is added the fact that the Jachin and Bo’az columns have secret meanings in Freemasonry. Among the theories is the etymological tracing of Jachin to the Sumerian fertility god, Nin-gis-zida, addressed as “Lord of the Tree of Life” and depicted as a serpent with a human head, and Bo’az 9780230610644ts04.indd 419780230610644ts04.indd 4112/7/2009 3:10:05 PM12/7/2009 3:10:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches42as a corruption of Tammuz or Dumuzi, Inanna’s consort.55 One prominent theory is that the two columns represented male and female to the ancient Israelites.56 The importance of the two columns lies at its top, with the pomegranates. At the very entrance to the temple in Jerusalem there were pomegranates. “Those ye’ who enter therein”—to paraphrase Dante—were aware, I submit, that the pomegranate was the fruit of the tree of knowledge and made them the responsible, sin-making, sex-loving, pain-bearing people that they were after the disobedience and fall. One certainty that we have, a point on which all scholars can agree, is that religious art of the ancients had meaning and was not a product of random, chaotic lines and draw-ings, however aesthetically presented. The meaning of this art to those who entered the temple in Solomon’s time, however, may not have been exactly the same as to those who entered the temple in, say, the time of Julius Caesar, when the temple still stood on the hill in Jerusalem.Ivory, Temple in Jerusalem, and Ancient IconographyAn antiquities dealer in Jerusalem acquired—exactly how is unknown—an old hip-popotamus ivory shaped as a pomegranate.57 The pomegranate vase is slightly less than two inches tall and one inch wide, on which was carved an inscription in fifteen old Hebrew letters. In July of 1979, André Lemaire, an expert paleographer, exam-ined the inscription and reconstructed these words in translation: “Belonging to the tem[ple of the lo]rd, [Yahweh], holy to priests.”58 Ultimately the Israel Museum purchased the vase for slightly more than a half million dollars; a controversy about its authenticity ensued. Its provenance is unknown; the antiquity dealer had a repu-tation for unscrupulous sales. If the pomegranate vase’s inscription was as authentic as Lemaire stated, it would be the only tangible object that survives from the temple of Solomon, and probably worth far more than a half million.59Now we know that the vase is authentic but its inscription likely is a forgery. Previously the Museum’s director, Nahman Avigad, was uncertain about whether and, if so how, the vase was involved in the temple’s priestly procedure and ritual.60 The pomegranates on the priests’ robes and on top of the columns before the tem-ple indicated to him a probable temple use. Recently laboratory examination of the so-called Solomon vase proves its antiquity but far earlier than the alleged- bogus inscription suggested: the pomegranate vase is from the Late Bronze period (thirteenth–twelfth centuries BCE). Scholars of ancient Israel concluded that its inscription was forged in modern times, but laboratory testing proves that the vase was much earlier than previously thought. Whereas most investigators believe the inscription to be a forgery, the opinion is not unanimous. Whoever the forger was, he knew much about early Israeli culture because of the plausibility of the pomegranate’s association with the temple. Another pomegranate vase (called the Rimmon Vase, from the Hebrew word for pomegranate) was found in Tell Halif in southern Judea and dates from the tenth to the eighth centuries BCE—later than the so-called Solomon Pomegranate Vase. Also from a Philistine temple within the present city-limits of Tel Aviv a pomegranate shaped terracotta vessel was found that dates to approximately 1000 BCE.61 Actual dried pomegranates were found in ancient tombs at Jericho in Palestine that dates from the Middle Bronze Age 9780230610644ts04.indd 429780230610644ts04.indd 4212/7/2009 3:10:06 PM12/7/2009 3:10:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"43Pomegranate as Eve’s Apple(ca. 2300 BCE).62 The small vase may have been the head of a scepter and is more evidence of the pomegranate’s popularity in Palestine cultures, including the Jews, but we cannot directly tie it to Solomon’s temple except through representations on the temple itself and priests’ robes.An Israeli seal from either the eighth or seventh century BCE is bordered with pomegranates. Also there were the two pendants in Israeli Megiddo, dating eight century BCE, that have pomegranates shaped like the “House of the Lord” Vase. Their shapes were similar to the chains of pomegranates hanging from an Ugarit cultic tripod dating from the thirteenth century BCE.63Judaic Coins and the PomegranateJust as in the modern world, where we associate national symbols with the coins and paper money issued by governments, so too was the practice in the ancient world. For example, Athen’s coins often had either Athena or the owl (her symbol); Rome had Romulus and Remus (mythical founders of Rome); and, as shortly we shall see below, Cyrene had the plant silphium. The symbol on Jewish coins was the pome-granate, the fruit that adorned the entrance to the temple and the borders of the tem-ple priests’ robes. One of the earliest Jewish coins was issued by Yehonatan (Greek name, Alexander Jannaeus, 103–76 BCE), the great-nephew of Judas Maccabee, the rebel leader who led the Jews to independence from the Greek Seleucid Empire. Yehonatan was the high priest who also assumed the title of king. To distinguish his realm from the neighboring Hellenistic powers, he issued crude coins to show that the Jews had reappeared as a political identity, and he used pomegranates to des-ignate that distinction. Some coins were in Greek, others in Aramaic and Hebrew letters, and with mistakes. The obverse of one typical coin has the Hebrew inscrip-tion: “Yehonatan the high priest and the community of Jews” while its reverse has a double cornucopia adorned with ribbons and a pomegranate coming from the middle of two horns.64 The motif of a pomegranate between horns (as a cornuco-pia) was the usual symbol of ancient Jewish coins.65 Later the horns were dropped but the pomegranate remained, as in the Shekel of Israel: Year Two = 67–68 CE. Hebrew legend: “Jerusalem the Holy” Obverse: Three pomegranates on a Shekel coin issued in 67–68 CE, just before the Roman destruction of the temple and the Diaspora. One side has “Jerusalem the Holy” and its reverse three pomegranates.66 In 2008 the State of Israel issued a two-shekel coin with a pomegranate set in a cornucopia in imitation of the ancient coins.67Judaism and the PomegranateFrom the pomegranates on columns in front of the temple, the priests’ robes bor-dered with pomegranates, numerous pomegranate artifacts found in Palestine, and as the symbol on the coins, the pomegranate was an early symbol for the Jewish people, just as the Menorah was later. Did the early Israelites, like those in ancient Sumer, know that the pomegranate was a contraceptive as well as a good refreshing fruit to eat? Did the sin of humankind in eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil constitute the assumption of fertility control?

The pome-granate was a very popular subject for the manufacture of jewels, jars, and various vases throughout the eastern Mediterranean world, including the Mycenaean period of Greek cultures. Many of the pomegranate objects are similar and point to factory manufacturing in Syria and Egypt.68 The tomb of Amenhotep II (1450–1415 BCE) had no fewer that nineteen votive pomegranates of faïence, and on Cyprus at least sixteen glass pomegranates were found in tombs of wealthy people living in the late Bronze Age; those objects were almost certainly not manufactured on the island.69Persephone and PomegranateThe Greek counterpart of Inanna is Persephone and her abduction; the story is also associated with pomegranate fruit. A statuette of the archaic period shows a god-dess, probably Demeter or Persephone, with a pomegranate in her right hand.70 In the Hymn to Demeter,71 the early version of the story dates from the seventh century BCE, when the Greek city-states (poleis) were in their formative period. Persephone (sometimes Kore, meaning “virgin”) was the daughter of Zeus and daughter-in-law (later, daughter) of Demeter, the goddess of fertility and earth-mother. Some schol-ars speculate that, before the written accounts, the mother-daughter pair was one fertility goddess who, for reasons lost in the mist of time, became two.72 There is a similar hypothesis about Inanna and Ereshkigal, her sister (discussed in chapter one). The Eleusian Mysteries had secret ceremonies at Eleusis, supposedly where grain was first grown and where Persephone returned to the Earth. The secret cere-monies honoring Demeter and Persephone date back to Mycenean times (ca. 1700 BCE). In the beginning of the Hymn to Demeter, Persephone appears ready for sex-uality, only that of her own choosing, just as Inanna wanted her sexuality in the Underworld.73 Hades (Pluto to the Romans) seized and kidnapped Persephone to the Underworld. Unable or unwilling to intervene, Zeus told Persephone not to eat while in the Underworld. Demeter was distressed, and earth manifested her distress: all that was green and fertile died. Facing the laments of Demeter and the wilted earth, the other gods beseeched Zeus to rescue her. Before the rescue could be exe-cuted, Persephone ate some pomegranate seeds, seven by one account and three by another.74 (Winters, after all, vary as to length of months.)Questions arise: Were Persephone and Hades “really” married in the Underworld?75 Was Persephone raped or merely an unwilling bride or consort? The Hymn makes clear that sexual intercourse took place,76 but under what circum-stances? Did Zeus know the meaning of eating pomegranate seeds? Did he know and not want Persephone to eat them? In the Hymn to Demeter Zeus sends Hermes to bring Persephone back, but why does he not tell Hermes to instruct Persephone not to eat the seeds? Why does Hermes give her the seed secretly? This line from the Hymn explains, “But he stealthily put in my mouth a food honey-sweet, a pome-granate seed, and compelled me against my will and by force to taste it.”77 The 9780230610644ts04.indd 449780230610644ts04.indd 4412/7/2009 3:10:06 PM12/7/2009 3:10:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"45Pomegranate as Eve’s AppleHymn is no more helpful in answering these questions than was the Temptation in the Garden of Eden. Was Hermes a tool of Zeus, as the serpent was the same for God?A number of curious discrepancies about the pomegranate make the story incom-plete. First, according to the legend, Persephone ate the pomegranate; the medical writings have it administered as a vaginal suppository. There is only one possible source in which we have found pomegranate as a possible oral-route drug. During the Middle Ages, the Arabic text of Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, c. 980–1037) prescribed pomegranate as a postcoital contraceptive, whereas the Latin translation made by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187) implied that it was taken orally.78Earliest Meaning of Persephone from a Late SourcePersephone’s eating of pomegranate concerns women’s use of birth control agents more directly than previously known by modern interpreters. Symbolically the story is interpreted today as sexuality and death, and the eating of the man’s food as seduction and marriage consummation. Unwillingness, treachery, and rape are implied.79 A late Roman retelling of the story adds new meaning. Claudianus (fl. ca. 400 CE) wrote but did not finish “Rape of Persephone” (3 bks.) in which the motivation of the marriage has a different meaning. Rather than having Hades abducting or being given Persephone in an arranged marriage, Zeus granted her as a bride because Hades, frustrated by a wifeless and a childless state, threatened war on heaven.80 Persephone’s body was the means to prevent war between the upper and lower worlds; thus her virginity was sacrificed for Hades’ use in return for har-mony among the gods.81 All the more meaningful is Zeus’s admonition for her not to eat anything and, au contraire, she did eat and it was the pomegranate, a contra-ceptive. In Claudianus’s poem, the peace would be threatened because Hades would be childless. How much of this was Claudianus’s poetic license, and how much authenticity was there to the myth’s early meaning?The Hymn to Demeter can be seen as the taking of a story well-known by gen-erations of Greek-speaking peoples and, before them, multilanguage peoples. Assuming the correctness of Hymn, composed around the seventh century BCE, the period reflects the formation of the city-state (polis) as tribal cohesion gave way to a larger political entity. The city-state society was concerned with marriage, child legitimacy, and a patriarchal culture that had emerged from one focused on a fertil-ity goddess.82 Zeus dominates over Demeter and Persephone. On the other hand, Claudianus lived during a period of the barbarian migrations and assaults on the Roman Empire, when rape was a reality. Likely, it seems to me, he picked up on an earlier theme in the Persephone story, where the issue was the eating of pomegranate in disobedience to the god (Zeus/Jupiter) in order to prevent conception and protect herself against giving birth to a child conceived through rape or forced marriage.Thesmophoria: Women’s Secret InitiationA society known as the Thesmophoria was complete with secrets given to the initi-ates. Only Greek women could be initiated into its mysteries, as they would either 9780230610644ts04.indd 459780230610644ts04.indd 4512/7/2009 3:10:07 PM12/7/2009 3:10:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches46camp out in tents some distance from town or, in some cases, on an island. At the Thesmophoria festival, the goddess honored was Demeter, but Persephone was also a part. Although few details are found in the ancient works (written by men, of course), various writers related incidental details. Aristophanes, the writer of com-edy, wrote an entire play called The Thesmophoriazuzae, the name of a judicious council, held on the festival’s third day. The plot of the play—to me Aristophanes funniest—was a trial of Euripides, the playwright, who was on trial in absentia for his misogynist portrayal of women; the indictment said Euripides described women as “double-dealers, false, faithless, tippling, mischief-making gossips, a rotten set, a misery to men.”83 So negative were women characterized that their husbands returned from the theater so sour that they peeped into closets to find lovers. As a male, Euripides could not defend himself so he pressed his father-in-law to dress as a clandestine woman to defend him. As the ploy unfolds, the man’s presence was discovered with hilarious, bawdy results. In another source a man who complained that attendance at the Thesmophoria had a fee and he had to pay twice, once for his wife and again for his mistress!84 Despite the masculine humor about the activities of women on their female-only outings, the religious purpose was paramount for the attendees.In the initiation ritual Persephone was first seen picking wild flowers. Likely there was a dramatization of the abduction, rape, eating of pomegranates seeds, and return to earth (even though there also was the tradition that she remained as the Queen of the Underworld, similar to Inanna’s sister). Persephone left the earth as a girl and was raped most likely as a bride. Women who attended were usually married, although unmarried women as well could be initiated into the myster-ies, called the Eleusian Mysteries because Persephone reportedly returned to the earth at Eleusis. (Another tradition said Sicily was the location where Persephone returned, and there also the Mysteries’ secret ceremonies were performed.) The early Christian writer, Clement of Alexandria, who had no trepidations about exposing a pagan ritual, related some details among which was that women celebrants took care not to eat pomegranate seeds as they lay upon the ground.85 Prytz Johansen studied the fragments of information about the Thesmophoria and noted the similarity with the Sacred Marriage motif that he regarded as the promotion of fertility.86 Just as on the Uruk Vase, the women attending the Thesmophoria were there to celebrate both their fertility and, with the pomegranate, how to control it. Persephone moved from adolescent virgin to young woman and, perhaps, to motherhood. The girl in her was lost but she gained the knowledge of pomegranates that made Hell (Hades) more endurable for her stays there.The agricultural fertility aspect was not lost. By reason of Persephone’s disobe-dience (albeit in the Hymn to Demeter version because of trickery), from that time forth she had to return for some months each year to the Underworld and, when she did, the leaves turned, plants died, and, in Hesiod’s description: “Avoid the month Lenaeon [late January, early February], wretched days, all of them fit to skin an ox, and the frosts which are cruel when Boreas blows over the earth.”87 That wintry months varied according to the number of seeds eaten from year to year appeared to be a reasonable deduction, but there is nothing explicit in the legend. 9780230610644ts04.indd 469780230610644ts04.indd 4612/7/2009 3:10:08 PM12/7/2009 3:10:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"47Pomegranate as Eve’s AppleOvid’s Fasti links the three seeds to half the number of months that Persephone was allowed in the upper world.88 In comparison to Persephone, Inanna secured her return to the Upper World by leaving behind her sister Ereshkigal. The god of wisdom joined Inanna, it will be remembered, in the Under World, paralleling the Adam-Eve story.The Demeter VaseThe connection between Inanna and Persephone/Demeter is clearly seen on a vase, the Demeter Vase. A picture drawn on a Boeotian plate (see figure 2.1) shows either Demeter or Persephone (some say both in one) seated, enthroned and heavily draped. The figure’s right hand holds a torch; her left holds two stalks of grain and two twigs with a pomegranate on each end. The torch in her right hand is, in Demeter’s words to Persephone (placed there by Claudianus): “I had thought—as every mother does—of the wedding torch I’d hold to light your way from a happy nuptial feast to the bridal chamber and bed and the start of a decent life.”89 With her left hand, she holds the grain and pomegranates on an omphalos altar on which there is what appears to be a pomegranate.90 The goddess holds the symbols for fertility and sterility. She controls each in her hand. Demeter’s symbols are clear.91 The juxtaposition of grain and pomegranates on the Demeter Vase is exactly the same as that on the Uruk Vase; the Demeter vase was almost 3,000 years after the Uruk Vase.Figure 2.1 Boeotia plate (5th c.

Grind the inside of fresh pomegranate peel with water, and apply [as pessary].Or: Grind two parts of pomegranate peel and one part of oak galls, for small sup-positories and insert after the cessation of menstruation.Or: Moist alum, the inside of pomegranate rind, mix with water, and apply with wool.Or: Of unripe oak galls, of the inside of pomegranate peel, of ginger, of each 2 drachms, mould it with wine to the size of a vetch pea and dry indoors and give before coitus, to be applied as a vaginal suppository . . . Or: Apply pomegranate peel with an equal amount of gum and an equal amount of oil of roses.Then one should always follow with a drink of honey water. But one should beware of things which are very pungent, because of ulcerations arising from them. And we use all these things after the end of menstruation.92The remarkable observation is not that Soranus named pomegranates as a con-traceptive but that there were writers who did not. Such medical authorities as Hippocrates (i.e., the various treatises known as the Hippocratic Corpus, ca. 440–330 BCE), Dioscorides (d. ca. 70 CE), and Galen (d. post 205 CE), gave detailed prescriptions about contraceptives but failed to mention pomegranates as having this power.93 Similarly, neither was pomegranate recommended as a contraceptive in the medical works by Scribonius Largus, Oribasius, Marcellus Empiricus, Quintus Serenus, and Theodorus Priscianus, or the medical content in the encyclopedic work by Pliny the Elder.94 Why should pomegranates have figured so prominently in the early history of West Asia and not be given for contraception in the Graeco-Roman period (Soranus excepted) nor in the Middle Ages (except for other medicinal uses)?95 The reasons, I submit, are twofold: one, the pomegranate over the centuries, millennia really, had been horticulturally bred for tastes and the active estrogene compounds reduced. The wild pomegranate trees are found in the south Caspian area, southern Balkans, and northeastern Turkey. The pomegranate was bred by clonal propagation, not sexual reproduction.96 Second, more effective contraceptive drugs were discovered, such as the famed silphium found only around Cyrene in North Africa, described by Juvenal as a “sure-fire contraceptive.”97 Cyrene’s coins prominently displayed silphium, often with a woman touching the plant with one arm and her womb with the other. It resisted cultivation and became extinct by the fourth century CE—hunted out of existence by human exploitation.Why not Egypt?As I have mulled over the meaning of pomegranates for years now, I have been puzzled about the absence of pomegranates as a contraceptive in ancient Egypt. 9780230610644ts04.indd 489780230610644ts04.indd 4812/7/2009 3:10:10 PM12/7/2009 3:10:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"49Pomegranate as Eve’s AppleThere are two major sources for pharmaceutical data that are preserved on ancient Egyptian papyri: the Kahun Medical Gynecology (or Obstetrical) Papyrus (dating from around 1850 BCE) and the more famous and extensive Ebers Papyrus (dat-ing around 1551–1500 BCE). Both are thought to be copies of earlier compilations with the Ebers said to date back to the Early Kingdom (as early as 3000 BCE). Major authorities agree that the pomegranate was not introduced into Egypt until the New Kingdom; the plant was brought to Egypt after the Syrian expeditions of Thothmes I (1525–1512 BCE).98 The tomb of Hatshepsut (ca. 1470 BCE) held a large, dried pomegranate.99 Some nineteen votive pomegranates were found in the tomb of Amenhotep II (r. 1450–1415 BCE), and Egypt became a major manufactur-ing center for pomegranate vases and jewelry.100 Found in Tutankhamun’s tomb was a rare silver vase shaped like a pomegranate, rare because silver is not often found in Egypt.101 Once the pomegranate plant came to Egypt, its popularity soared.Both the Kahun and Ebers papyri refer to contraceptives, mostly as pessaries; modern science and medicinal chemistry find virtually all effective to some degree.102 (The only ingredient that was not is crocodile dung but, inasmuch as the croco-dile represented the abortion god, perhaps the meaning was more religious than pharmaceutical.) Given the chronology, one would not expect to find pomegranates mentioned at all, but they appear in the Ebers Papyrus in treatments for dysen-tery, diarrhea, stomachache, and killing roundworms in the digestive tract.103 There is a correlation that I have noticed between anthelmintic (worm killing) actions and contraceptive and/or early abortifacient drugs (to be seen as well in subsequent chapters). For example, Dioscorides prescribed pomegranate to kill intestinal worms but omitted its contraceptive quality.104 (Moreover, in following his arrangement of drugs by affinities so that one could substitute for another, Dioscorides placed together pomegranates and date palms.)105 Either the calendar date is incorrect for the introduction of the pomegranate in Egypt or the date for the papyrus copy of the Ebers Papyrus is misjudged.106 In any case, however, the fact remains that there is no evidence that the ancient dynastic Egyptians employed pomegranates as contra-ceptives. Probably there were two factors at work: one was that the Egyptians already had what they judged to be effective contraceptives. The Hippocratic Aphorism Number One stated: “Experiment is dangerous.”107 Whatever the correct date for the pomegranate’s introduction into Egypt and its recording in the Ebers Papyrus, the pomegranate would have been a recent plant in the ancient Egyptians’ diet and pharmacy. According to my hypothesis, the pomegranate’s active phytoestrogenic compounds were diminished by the time of the New Kingdom, or around 2,000 years after the story of Inanna and the pomegranate tree, the huluppu. By the time of the Egyptian New Kingdom, the pomegranate was unlikely to have been the contraceptive of choice.Contraception and Contraceptives in Ancient JudaismAmong the Jews, just as in other cultures of the eastern Mediterranean, the guiding principle was to guard the male head of the family’s right to have children. There was God’s injunction: “increase and multiply; fill the earth” (Gen. 1:27–28). Some Rabbinic interpretations allowed its imperative as applying only to men.108 The 9780230610644ts04.indd 499780230610644ts04.indd 4912/7/2009 3:10:11 PM12/7/2009 3:10:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches50Mishnah added a broader perspective: if a man had already sired a number of chil-dren (two males were mentioned as an example), he was excused from more prop-agation.109 For example, a woman whose husband was killed or died could abort if it was her desire. A Talmudic statement gave circumstances in which a woman could employ contraception: a minor (where childbearing would be dangerous) and a woman whose pregnancy too closely followed a birth and jeopardized nursing of the infant. Rabbis differed as to whether these circumstances were limited to those outlined or, as examples, could be expanded to cover other circumstances.110 Men who, it appears, knew little about the mechanisms of birth control wrote these sources. Specifically mentioned were a pessary (mokh in Hebrew), a “bitter med-icine” (by implication orally taken), “cup of roots,” and a “cup of barrenness.”111 Pomegranate could have been used, especially suggestive as a pessary, and for the bitter medicines, both willow bark and artemisia are likely candidates, both being effective and both well described as being bitter. The date palm was likely one of the birthcontrol measures. It is not possible, given the sources, to know precisely what medicines they took. What is certain is that Jewish women knew about contracep-tion and abortion and, in some circumstances, were allowed by their husbands to use them. What is more likely is that some women used these measures without their husbands’ knowledge.What Was the Sin that Adam and Eve Made?Today’s woman takes estrogen to prevent pregnancy or, wishing the same and need-ing supervised medical intervention, she takes estrogen. Thereby, we should not call Inanna, Ištar, Demeter, and the other similar goddesses “fertility goddesses” but fertility-control goddesses. If my interpretation is reasonable, just like Inanna, she brought the control of fertility; so did Eve when she discovered the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Adam may have had no clue other than that he had disobeyed a godly order. This is, of course, a story, there being no “real” Adam—or Eve.Genesis author “J” knew surely that pomegranates were contraceptives—the knowledge was pervasive in his culture. Without knowing that the fruit was the pomegranate, Merlin Stone, who studied early fertility goddesses, concluded about the sin: it was the “eating of the tree that gave her [Eve] the understanding of what ‘only the gods knew’—the secret of sex—how to create life.”112 In telling the Garden of Eden story with the Fall of Adam and Eve, author “J” could not have had mul-tigods interacting, because he believed in a single, all-powerful God. In developing his story, he would have used culturally derived stories. His theme is to account for humans’ innocence in the Garden and subsequent disobedience and, with it, how immortality was no longer possible, shame held in nakedness, and sexuality leading to the destiny of women to endure pain and danger in childbirth. There is nothing in his telling of the story that indicates that God’s displeasure over the eating of the pomegranate was contraception per se. After the Fall, humans were responsible beings and had to account to God for their actions. Responsibility came with the roles that sexuality assumed in human society and, by deciding when conception was to occur; humans’ relationship to God was altered just as Inanna’s fulfillment and power came from her use of the pomegranate. Inanna was reborn, at a price (leaving 9780230610644ts04.indd 509780230610644ts04.indd 5012/7/2009 3:10:11 PM12/7/2009 3:10:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"51Pomegranate as Eve’s Appleher sister in the Underworld); Eve and Adam paid a price for disobedience: the price was responsibility. There is no hint in any of the ancient stories, including the one in Genesis, that contraception was wrong, but it represented empowerment through knowledge. Responsibility is imposed on humans because they disobeyed God just as Inanna disobeyed her divine family’s wishes that she not go to the Underworld to receive the pomegranate, and Persephone disobeyed by partaking of a contracep-tive to thwart godly injunctions. The ancient Israelites did not select the pome-granate as their symbol because of its taste; they chose it because the pomegranate changed the relationship between their God and humans, and, by inference, in a positive way. The pomegranate changed the way humans thought and acted about sex and empowered them with knowledge to control their destinies. The “fall” was not so much of a fall as it was, in the words of John Evans, the biblical scholar: “an over-abrupt rise, a momentary transition from a state of naïve innocence to one of precocious maturity.”113 Adam became a man and Eve a woman. The serpent was necessary because the “J” author knew that people knew the Gilgamesh story about the serpent stealing the plant of life and probably the serpent in the pomegranate roots from the Inanna story. The transition to maturity and responsibility carried with it the propensity to sin. The pomegranate did more than symbolize the transi-tion; it was the message for responsible reproduction and human conduct.An Epilogue on PomegranatesA male person walking beneath the pomegranates on top of the two columns before the temple door in Jerusalem about the time of Augustus Caesar probably would not have been aware that pomegranates were contraceptives, since, by that time, their use had been reduced to quaint and largely forgotten lore. The pomegranate was prominently displayed in Greek, Etruscan, and Roman mythology and even appears in early Christian iconography. A vase from Campania has a love scene with a man and woman on a couch while, within arm’s reach, is a pomegranate on a table (see figure 2.2).114 Among the many representations in frescoes are the Aphrodite and Adonis painting from the Casa di Adone in Pompeii (in 79 CE) that has three pomegranates on an altar.115 Finally, a floor mosaic from the Villa by Hinton St. Mary, Dorset (4th c.), has Christ with pomegranates on each side.116 We know the mosaic is of Christ, because on his left and right appear, respectively, the Greek letters “Chi” and “Rho,” the first two Greek letters for “Christos/Χριστός.” In early Christianity, the pomegranate became a symbol for resurrection. Christ associated with an antifertility drug is startling at first, but Christians supplied revised meaning: the pomegranate assimilates Christ’s descent and resurrection and connects with Persephone’s rebirth on Earth and a return to things green and fer-tile. The Romans of the Empire continued to use contraception as well as early-term abortifacients, but no longer were the agents pomegranates.The pomegranate’s tough shell surrounding many seeds allegorically symbolized many Christians under one authority, the Church. Finally the Christians extended the pomegranate to symbolize the Virgin’s chastity.117 Sculptor Jacopo Della Quercia (1374–1438) executed his famous Madonna of the Pomegranate.118 Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519) and Isabella of Portugal, wife of his grandson, 9780230610644ts04.indd 519780230610644ts04.indd 5112/7/2009 3:10:11 PM12/7/2009 3:10:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches52employed the pomegranate as their impresa.119 What people in the early modern period regarded as the meaning of a symbol may not have been the same mean-ing it had in the ancient world. Still, the ancient meaning of the pomegranate as life-and-death, fertility and infertility, is linked to the medieval and early-modern meanings.120An Epilogue on EveThe story of Adam and Eve, Eve in particular, did not play a large role in early Jewish thought and letters, it appears. In early Judaism, Eve was “more humorous or mischievous than vicious,” or so said John Philips,121 but to modern conventions, she was weak and twice-blamed: first, for listening to the serpent in disobedience and then for persuading Adam to disobey by eating the forbidden fruit. What the Talmudic Rabbis took from the message was God’s injunction to be fruitful and multiply, but the Mishnah portrays a woman as a “sexual volcano always on the brink of eruption,” in the words of Pamela Norris, who wrote a “biography” of Eve.122 St. Paul made Eve more of a central figure in Christianity. First (2 Cor. 11:3), he wrote: “But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your Figure 2.2 Roman love scene with pomegranates on stand within easy reach.Source: Courtesy of Martin von Wagner Museum, Antikenabteilung, Universität, Würzburg, Germany.9780230610644ts04.indd 529780230610644ts04.indd 5212/7/2009 3:10:12 PM12/7/2009 3:10:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"53Pomegranate as Eve’s Applethought will be led astray”; second (1 Tim 2:13–14), Paul betrays his misogyny (viz. 1 Cor 6:15–20; 11:3–16) by outlining why a woman should be silent and submis-sive: “For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.”The Christian Church Fathers used the “J” section of Genesis to account for original sin,123 a doctrine, which in Judaism, if present, was, at least, submerged. Primarily they interpreted the sin was sexual misconduct, with the disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit. Poor Eve, the “mother of all living,” was once a supreme goddess, now relegated to mere humanity, taken from a man’s rib in a true patriar-chal society, made a seducer, and, with Christianity, designated the first sinner and responsible for humanity’s downfall. By the sixth century, Mary, the silent, suffering virgin, was a counter to negative female imagery, during the early medieval period, to treacherous Eve. But, after the Romance poets developed the notion of chivalry, the scholastics in the medieval university reinterpreted Genesis’ Garden of Eden story to make the point that Eve, being the last to be created, was the superior crea-ture. The world has turned many times since the thirteenth century, when scholas-tics tried to rescue Eve and place her on a pedestal, not on a stool in the corner. Eve has come a long way since she was named Inanna, who had discovered the qualities of the pomegranate.9780230610644ts04.indd 539780230610644ts04.indd 5312/7/2009 3:10:14 PM12/7/2009 3:10:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 3Mandrake, the Love Apple, and the World’s ReligionsGenesis 30: 14–17: In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel [Leah’s younger sister] said to Leah, “Give me, I pray, some of your son’s mandrakes.” But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband [Jacob]? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.” When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night. And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a sixth son. [Rev. Standard trans.]The mandrake enabled Leah to conceive two more sons, Issachar and Zebulon, and a daughter, Dinah. There is more to the story. Leah felt displaced because Jacob loved more Rachel, Leah’s younger sister, and Leah had become infertile. Before Reuben’s mandrake, Rachel, who had always been infertile, allowed her handmaiden to lie with Jacob and to produce two sons by Rachel’s proxy. The mandrake altered the situation in a dramatic way. Rachel permitted Leah to sleep with Jacob provided she also received the mandrake as a result of which Rachel had two sons, Joseph and Benjamin. Leah wanted the plant so that she could resume fertility.The fertility plant enabled barren Leah to add to the previous sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah (Gen. 29:31–35–30:1–25). Rabbi Levi in the Midrash Rabbah exclaimed: “Come and see how acceptable was the mediation of the man-drakes, for through these mandrakes there arose two great tribes in Israel, Issachar and Zebulon”1—pointing only to Leah’s sons. Although Leah was the eldest and Jacob’s first wife, he had also married her younger sister, Rachel. According to a Jewish legend, Leah said: “God promised Jacob twelve sons. I bore him six, and each of two handmaids has borne him two. If, now I were to bring forth another son, my sister Rachel would not be equal even unto the handmaids.”2 Each of Leah’s six sons was a primogenitor for the twelve tribes of Israel—the others coming from 9780230610644ts05.indd 559780230610644ts05.indd 5512/7/2009 5:34:17 PM12/7/2009 5:34:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches56Rachel and the two handmaidens. Judah was the most prominent because from him came the kings of Israel, including David, and from the house of David came Jesus. In time, Judah’s kingdom was called Judea and its people Jews by encom-passing the other eleven tribes. Leah would not have had two of her six sons and Rachel her two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, had not the mandrake “secured” four sons.3 Had Leah not resumed her fertility, she would have lost status and, with it, her sons might have lost favor. The mandrake plant was responsible for four of Israel’s tribes.4 Later Jewish and Christian theologians recognize the importance of the mandrake, but only in an incidental way. The mandrake’s role was not inciden-tal but physiologically central to how the ancient tribes of Israel came into existence and how the Christians trace their Messiah’s lineage. Certainly Reuben’s finding of the mandrakes was of great importance to Leah and Rachel. John Skinner, a biblical scholar, believes that the “incident of the love-apples [mandrakes] is a piece of folk-lore . . . [that] the writer (J) [of the Genesis section] curtailed.” Skinner adds, “The story must have gone on to tell how Rachel partook of the fruit and in consequence became pregnant, while Leah also conceived.”5 Why would the author include the mandrakes? They were essential to the story.Harry PotterJ. K. Rowling is another authority on the mandrake—albeit, less so than the Bible; she is the author of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and his classmates are ushered into Greenhouse #3 where an earmuff was placed before each person. Professor Sprout asks who can “tell the properties of the Mandrake?” Harry’s friend Hermione answers: “Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restor-ative. . . . It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.” But it is dangerous, Sprout adds and he asks why. Again, Hermione: “The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it.” Correct, again, replies the professor and she adds that their greenhouse mandrakes were “only seedlings,” whose cry was too weak to be fatal but they “will knock you out for several hours.”6 The earmuffs prevented the Hogwarts students from passing out as the baby roots screamed.Between Genesis, Shakespeare, and Harry PotterA mandrake’s cry, potentially fatal, as it is pulled from the ground was not imagi-nation in Rowling’s Harry Potter stories; the crying of the mandrake root is older than Harry. William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (Act 4.Scene 3) reads: “And shrieks like mandrakes’ torn out of the earth.” Shakespeare also has the Duke of Suffolk say: “Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake’s groan” (Henry VI, Pt. 2. Act 3. Sc. 2). Many are the legends surrounding the mandrake, some of which we shall visit, and there is also a large amount of medical lore about one of history’s most famous medical plants. The questions are as follows: (1) Does the mandrake have the qualities that history has attributed to the herb; (2) How has this plant worked in history to change human society, both in legend and in pharmaceutical action?9780230610644ts05.indd 569780230610644ts05.indd 5612/7/2009 5:34:17 PM12/7/2009 5:34:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"57Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s ReligionsThe BibleWhen I took a course in the Bible in a public school, we had to memorize all those “begets,” who married whom and who were their children. At the time my thoughts were “what a waste of time—just like algebra—and I’ll never need to know this stuff.” In Genesis (13: 15–16), God promised Abraham, the patriarch, a blessing involving land and his progeny, but he had to leave his land for an unknown land and for an undisclosed length of time. In the wilderness, he was unable to bear a child through Sarah, his wife, who, in accordance with custom, arranged a con-cubine in Hagar, an Egyptian slave. An angel told Hagar that she would have Abraham’s son and call him Ishmael. Sarah’s duty to ensure her husband children soured her relationship with Hagar who was banished to the desert wilderness. God told Sarah she too would conceive, but, knowing her old age, she laughed “to her-self” (Gen. 18:12). God told Abraham that Sarah would bear his future child and “she will be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her” (Gen. 17:16). Sarah’s son was Isaac, whose son was Jacob. Thus, the Jewish people are regarded as the descendants of Jacob. Ishmael, on the other hand, was the primogenitor of the Islamic peoples, and about whom much more is told in the Qur’an.7 Three of the world’s major religions hinged on female fertility; all trace their ancestry back to Hagar and to Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah. Sarah’s son was conceived through divine intervention but, in Leah’s case, it was through the power of the mandrake plant, with the implication of God’s approval. Although not so stated, the miracle of Sarah’s fertility may have been also the mandrake, should God be perceived as working through natural processes as he did with Jacob’s wives.Fertility and Divine FavorFertility was very important to some societies in the ancient and modern West Asian region during periods of time. In his despair, Abraham cried: “O Lord God, what wilt Thou give me, for I continue childless” (Gen. 15:2). Second only to death, a major divine punishment was the curse of sterility (Lev. 20: 20–21). The Genesis Rabbah (a commentary on Genesis, probably written slightly later than the two Talmudic Rabbi accounts) accepts that conception was a sign of divine favor (although some opinions differed on Hagar).8 Hagar was a household slave until she became preg-nant; then she received direct divine communication from God through an angel. Sarah’s conception in her old age was an indication of God’s direct intervention to fulfill his promise to Abraham.9 Amazingly the four Jewish matriarchs all had fertility problems: Sarah, Rebekah (wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob, conceived after twenty years of marriage), Leah (Jacob’s first wife, who became barren after delivering four sons), and Rachel (second wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph and Benjamin). A married but barren woman was not only regarded as being undesirable but her condition rose to the level of legitimate divorce.10Relative to Rachel’s fertility after eating the mandrake, the Midrash Rabbah asserted: “Were she not righteous, would she have borne children?”11 Twentieth-century Muslim women of Jordan either tied a mandrake around their necks and/or ate mandrake when they wanted to become pregnant. Raphael Patai, who 9780230610644ts05.indd 579780230610644ts05.indd 5712/7/2009 5:34:18 PM12/7/2009 5:34:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches58studied mid-twentieth century Muslim society in modern Israel and Jordan, said: “Barrenness is still considered the greatest misfortune and disgrace that can befall a woman.”12 It appears incongruous that three generations of women involving four women would be afflicted with infertility. Sarah was too old for childbearing, and she was anxious about being replaced by a new wife for Abraham.13 Certainly all these matriarchs would have had one condition in common: stress. This is where the mandrake reenters the discussion.The Mandrake PlantBotanically the mandrake is a member of the Solanaceae family, one famous, even notorious, in herbal lore because of its heavy constituent tropane alkaloids, which include atropine, hyoscymine, and scopolamine. Plants in the same fam-ily include the potato, tobacco, and deadly nightshade (also called belladonna). Botanical references occur under several binominals: Mandragora officinarum L., which comprises two distinct species: Mandragora autumnalis Bertol. and Mandragora vernalis Bertol. or, alternatively Atropa mandragora L. I shall use the preferred Atropa name for the genus. As we shall see below, many ancient authors say that there are two “kinds,” male and female. Whereas we might speculate about whether the gender differentiations are botanically based or appearance-based on the root shape, the assumption that I shall make in this study is there is no practical difference from the standpoint of the physiological effects of either kind. This assumption is based on a chemical study that shows that the variations between the two species “were no more than would be expected as a result of nor-mal biological variation.”14The American mandrake, also called mayapple, is a different plant: Podophyllum pellatum L., of the Berberidaceae family, which also has strong alkaloid com-pounds similar but not the same in their physiological effects. Confusion may arise from the English common name, devil’s apple, as applied to both the European and American mandrakes. The mayapple is a common garden ornamental; no one should ingest any part of the plant because, although used medicinally, it is highly poisonous—and so is the European mandrake. The European mandrake’s habitat is the Mediterranean region. Late medieval efforts to grow it in green-house conditions as far north as Britain were successful. Grieve’s Herbal has this description of it:It has a large, brown root, somewhat like a parsnip, running 3 or 4 feet deep into the ground, sometimes single and sometimes divided into two or three branches. Immediately from the crown of the root arise several large, dark-green leaves, which at first stand erect, but when grown to full size (a foot or more in length and 4 or 5 inches in width) spread open and lie upon the ground. They are sharp-pointed at the apex and of a foetid odour. From among these leaves spring the flowers, each on a separate foot-stalk, 3 or 4 inches high. They are somewhat of the shape and size of a primrose, the corolla bell-shaped, cut into five spreading segments, of a whitish colour, somewhat tinged with purple. They are succeeded by a smooth, round fruit, about as large as a small apple, of a deep yellow colour when ripe, full of pulp and with a strong, apple-like scent.159780230610644ts05.indd 589780230610644ts05.indd 5812/7/2009 5:34:18 PM12/7/2009 5:34:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"59Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s ReligionsThe plant was found mostly in shaded woodland areas with plenty of moisture and good drainage and loose sandy or loamy soil. In antiquity, the plant resisted culti-vation, which, although tricky, could be done from seed. The greenhouse scene in Harry Potter showed the plants with roots, looking like babies, as they were being noisily transplanted. The roots are similar to a carrot (Grieves said parsnip) but dif-ferent by virtue of two major roots coming down from the top and two from the bottom. In this way the root systems resemble a human form.Egyptian LoreElephantine was an island in the Nile at the First Cataract (present-day Aswan) and known as the place where mandrake beer was manufactured. A nineteenth-century Egyptologist, Gaston Maspero, said that the mandrake drink was “employed either in medicine or in magic.”16 This mandrake drink figured prominently in Egyptian religion. Aspects of the myth are familiar because of similarities with biblical and Mesopotamian stories regarding the near-destruction of humans who had become estranged and unmindful of God (or the gods). Egypt’s chief deity, Ra, sent Hathor (said in some legends to be his wife and mother of Horus) to slay all people, a task which she readily performed. Gods cannot err or, at least, readily admit to it. He regretted his order and asked Hathor if her enthusiasm might be excessive. Hathor replied: “By thy life when I slaughter men then is my heart right joyful!” Ra had a miracle to save humans: the mandrake! Sending to Elephantine for a large supply, he called upon a miller to crush the grain, brew beer, and mingle it with human blood from those slain. While Hathor slept, Ra ordered a courier to carry 7,000 jars with the specially manufactured mandrake beer and, by emptying the jars, to cover the ground four-hands deep. Awakening to resume her carnage, she drank the beer tast-ing of human blood and mellowed. Hathor fell into a drunken stupor. Upon awak-ening sober, she had a relaxed feeling and, with it, a changed heart; she ceased killing humans. Thus was humankind saved. Ra ordered that henceforth on Hathor’s feast day, all humans should partake of mandrake beer and sleep thereafter.17Although represented many ways, Hathor was seen as a pregnant hippopotamus with a human or hippo head and a charmingly swollen womb from pregnancy.18 A picture from the Book of Dead (19th Dynasty) shows the hippopotamus deity, Taweret, standing before Hathor with a hippopotamus head.19 Among women, Hathor was probably the most beloved of the gods and, so it appears, Hathor and Taweret became one in Egyptian women’s perception. One of Hathor’s names was “mistress of the vagina”: she was associated with conception, pregnancy, birth, motherhood, and all aspects of loving child rearing.20Marrying Hathor to Biblical MandrakeFinding the mandrake as a fertility agent in Egyptian medicine is expected but, alas, it is not to be found, despite some erroneous efforts to say otherwise.21 According to an authority on Egyptian herbs, Lise Manniche, the mandrake is found in no pharaonic texts, including the famous Ebers prescription papyrus, despite the fact that this compendium has approximately 1,000 recipes. As noted in chapter two 9780230610644ts05.indd 599780230610644ts05.indd 5912/7/2009 5:34:18 PM12/7/2009 5:34:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches60of this work, however, many, some say all, recipes date back to the Old Kingdom. Rmmt is the Egyptian word for mandrake; pictures of the plant are frequently found on tombs, monuments, and artifacts from the New Kingdom, the period when Manniche says it was introduced into Egypt. Its New Kingdom representations gave it a “symbolic erotic significance in pharaonic times,” says Manniche.22 The man-drake (rmmt) is often mentioned in Egyptian love poetry.23My study of ancient Egyptian papyri (which included the Kahnun Obstetrical or Gynecological Papyrus, ca. 1850 BCE) found no mandrakes.24 Yet, the Egyptians knew the mandrake from at least the New Kingdom, similar in that respect to the pomegranate. Mandrake representations appear in tomb paintings and depict the plant with its apple-like fruit.25 A carved ivory box-lid shows the pharaoh’s daughter picking mandrake apple in Tutankhamun and Queen Ankhesenamun’s garden.26 Curiously in another scene the Queen holds two mandrake fruits near the nose of the Pharaoh, causing one Egyptologist to exclaim: “Does it suggest that she intended to give potency to the rather limpid boy with a belly in the Akhenaten-tradition?”27 No depiction, however, that I have seen shows its roots from whence comes its stron-gest medicinal compounds, as Harry Potter’s friend knew.The Love Apple as the MandrakeFor once among scholars, there is virtually no controversy about what was the “love-apple” in Genesis 30:14, which Reuben found in the f ields; Genesis’ love apple is Harr y Potter’s and our mandrake. The transliterated Hebrew word in Genesis is duda’ im, meaning “love apple” from root dwd (“to love” or “to fondle”). The Arabic word for mandrake, yabruh, also means “love apple.”28 The seventy or so Jewish scholars who translated Genesis into Greek in the Septuagint version in approximately the third century BCE, rather than translate the word to “love,” employed the Greek name for the plant, mēlon mandragora, whose identification is certain. Moreover the Vulgate, Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic versions all agree on the mandrake, whereas the rabbin-ical tracts come about as close to agreement as the Rabbis did on anything.29 The Hebrew Song of Songs (or, of Solomon 7:13–14) in the context of love-poetry: “The mandrakes (duda’ im) give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.” The authorities on biblical botany are in agreement about the “love-apple.”30 Moreover, the connection between the plant and legends about it as seen in discussions in the Talmud and Josephus, the Jewish historian (as we shall see below), make even more certain its identification because the legends have persisted for millennia. For example, an old German custom was to place mandrakes under the nuptial bed.31Ugaritic texts containing one of their myths, Ba’al et ‘Anat, has ddym being placed in the ground that some scholars connect with the Hebrew duda’ im and translate a mandrake, but the context makes the citation uncertain.32 Even more intriguing is Hesychius, a Byzantine lexicographer of fifth century CE, of Alexandria who gave the synonym of Aphrodite as being Mandragoritis, “Lady of the Mandrake.”33 Aphrodite, as we saw in chapter one, was the classical Greek goddess of sexuality and love.9780230610644ts05.indd 609780230610644ts05.indd 6012/7/2009 5:34:19 PM12/7/2009 5:34:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"61Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s ReligionsMandrakes in Homer?Frustration to an historian is not being able to put a date on something, especially something intriguing and important. From very early times—but how early?—the mandrake root was associated with a human form. An etymology for mandragora or mandrake is related to the Indo-European and Persian for man giyā meaning “Man Plant.”34 Columella, the Roman agriculture writer, called it “quasi-human/ semihominis,”35 but its looks only contributed to the stories about it. What made mandrake legendary were its physiological effects on humans. Homer described the goddess Circe’s use of a pharmakon, to cast spells over wayfarers on an island where she lived after poisoning her husband. Some of Odysseus’s companions she turned into pigs. Odysseus escaped by using a plant called “moly”/ mōlos to protect him-self and eventually was able to persuade her to restore his friends.36 Columella and Pliny37 say that the mandrake is also called “circaeon,” doubtlessly after Circe who was a goddess of love (or degrading love) and associated with Isthar, the Assyrian Inanna counterpart. So, what plant was moly?Jerry Stannard’s careful study indicates a confusion of plants, even though tradi-tionally moly is identified as the mandrake, partly on the basis of Dioscorides giving mandrake’s synonym as Circaia, “the Circe plant.”38 Stannard believed that some of the classical citations, including Homer, communicated a description of Withania somnifera Dun., a member of the Solanaceae family.39 Much of Stannard’s evidence comes from the pharmacological actions it was alleged to have had. I suggest that moly was a species of mandrake, on the basis of Homer’s description, albeit brief: “So saying, Argeïphontes gave me [Odysseus] the herb [pharmakon], drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature. At the root it was black, but its flower was like milk. Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for mortal men to dig; with the gods all things are possible.”40 Whereas mandrake’s root is usually described as being brown, it is a dark brown; its flower’s color varies from whitish to light violet and is aptly called milk-colored. Most of all, only mandrake has the legend surrounding the dan-ger of digging it up. Finally, there is the synonym Dioscorides gave: “Circe’s herb.” Later the name shifted to other plants, just as Stannard documented. Dioscorides’s moly was probably a member of the Allium (onion). Much to the frustration of bot-any historians, all too often plant names shift among species, families, and genera. Homer’s moly was probably the mandrake, and, if not, it surely was a related species in the Solanaceae family as Stannard proposed.41 Likely Homer’s moly has the same physiological effect as the mandrake or one of its cousins. Inexplicably, however, Homer presented moly as an antidote to Circe’s poisons. Again, religious stories make sense often in a murky way. Homer may have begun the Greek stories about the mandrake (or its related species), but the ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian stories are clearer, as we shall see in the next section.Classical and Medieval Mandrake LegendsThere were many legends that ancients told about the mandrake, and there is no confusion about the plant’s identification, inasmuch as mandragora is almost always 9780230610644ts05.indd 619780230610644ts05.indd 6112/7/2009 5:34:19 PM12/7/2009 5:34:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches62the name given. Anne Van Arsdall succinctly summarized the combined ancient legends, as follows:The mandrake is a plant with a large root shaped like a human being, and it screams when pulled out of the ground. The scream kills anyone who hears it. So to safely pull up the mandrake root, dig down to expose the root using a tool of ivory (some say iron), making three circles about the root and chanting while digging. Then fasten a long rope around the exposed root. Tie a very hungry dog to the other end of the rope. You must be careful to cover your ears at this point. Take some meat and then throw it just out of the dog’s reach, and he will lunge to get the meat, pulling the mandrake out of the ground and causing it to shriek. The dog will die because he hears the scream. You can then safely capture and use the mandrake root.42Theophrastus related one of the earliest accounts by describing drug dealers and root gatherers (pharmakopōlai and rhizotomoi) who with a sword draw three circles around the mandrake, and cut it when they face westward as they dance around the plant chanting as “many things as possible about the mysteries of love.”43 The root gatherers (rhizotomoi) had a reputation for magic and use of mysticism and, given the comparative rarity of mandrake in the wild and its strong effects, it must have garnered a premium price. Whatever the origins of the mysteries regarding the mandrake, including death for man or dog who pulls it up, the story served well those who gathered it. Ordinary folk must have been frightened away. Anne Van Arsdall has added an intriguing hypothesis about the use of dogs in its harvesting. Many accounts speak of its smell. Perhaps dogs were trained to find it in the woods and wastelands.44 Whereas the mandrake had precious little attention, given its pro-nounced qualities, in the ancient medical literature, its importance and association as a primary herb is seen in one of two frontispieces in the famous Dioscorides’s manuscript known as the Juliana Anicia. These images feature the mandrake and signify the mandrakes’ importance in herbal lore. Dioscorides, seated, points to the mandrake held by Epinoia, the personification of Thinking, while in the fore-ground is a dog. A similar image in an Arabic translation of the same text shows Dioscorides, seated, with a student while demonstrating with a mandrake. A medi-eval manuscript of Pseudo-Apuleius’ Herbal shows a dog pulling up the mandrake (see figure 3.1). The medieval period intensified and supplemented the mandrake legends, as we shall see in the last chapter. Also, the Middle Ages transformed the plant into more of the devil’s tool.Sources quoted earlier, from Homer and Theophrastus to the Middle Ages, do not inform us about the details of the lost legends from ancient Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt (the Hathor legend excepted). A Jewish legend supplements Genesis on the mandrake. Reuben found the mandrake in a way that mirrors the mandrake legends. While he tended the fields, he tied his ass to a mandrake. The ass pulled up the mandrake by the roots and then died. Reuben found his ass dead and the mandrake, which he safely took to his mother.45 Leah, it was said, acted on “pure, disinterested motives” to resume childbearing but it is difficult to reconcile the view with a statement she was alleged to have made. “If, now,” Leah said, “I were to bring forth another son, my sister Rachel would not be equal even unto the handmaids.”46 Rachel was “not a pious woman” but “by bearing a son, she had escaped another 9780230610644ts05.indd 629780230610644ts05.indd 6212/7/2009 5:34:19 PM12/7/2009 5:34:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Figure 3.1 Mandrake uprooted by dog on chain.Source: From Herbal of Pseudo-Apuleius, Vienna, Ms lat. 93, 13th c., fol. 117v.

Had she not been guilty of this prideful statement, she “herself would have begotten twelve tribes with Jacob,” or so said the legend.Josephus (37–post-100 CE), a Jewish historian, seems to be describing the man-drake as determined by context and so assumed by many scholars through the ages. He called it Baaras, a name taken from the town near the Dead Sea:In the ravine, which encloses the town on the north, there is a place called Baaras, which produces a root bearing the same name. Flame-coloured and towards evening emitting a brilliant light, it eludes the grasp of persons who approach with the inten-tion of plucking it, as it shrinks up and can only be made to stand still by pouring upon it certain secretions of the human body.47 Yet even then to touch it is fatal, unless one succeeds in carrying off the root itself, suspended from the hand. Another innocuous mode of capturing it is as follows: They dig all round it, leaving but a minute portion of the root covered; they then tie a dog to it, and the animal rushing to follow the person who tied him easily pulls it up, but instantly dies—a vicarious victim, as it were for him who intended to remove the plant, since after this none need fear to handle it. With all these attendant risks, it possesses one virtue for which it is prized; for the so-called demons—in other words, the spirits of wicked men which enter the living and kill them unless aid is forthcoming—are promptly expelled by this root, if merely applied to the patients.48Josephus related a second story that says that he who pulls up the mandrake by the root promptly dies. To prevent a human death, a dog is tied to the roots, pulls up the plant, and dies.49 These legends (ritual harvesting and death of dog) point to Baaras’s identification as the mandrake, which many scholars believe.50In Josephus’s discussion of the fertility actions of Leah and Rachel, Josephus uses the Greek term mandragorou mēlon (“mandrake apples”) to identify the plant.51 The simplest explanation for the different terms is that, when Josephus was reporting on the plant near Baaras, he gave its local name, but, when he was identifying the plant in Genesis 30:14, he knew it to be the mandrake.52 Josephus’s knowledge about the plant would come from his Jewish culture.The Meanings of Mandrakes in Mesopotamian LanguagesThe mandrake legends in the languages of ancient West Asia and Egypt are more difficult to ascertain. In Mesopotamia and in Semitic-speaking lands there is less certainty, although scholars are fairly definitive that mandrakes grew there—even in modern times—but exactly what were the words? R. Campbell Thompson iden-tified mandrake as the meaning of the Assyrian word, Nam.tar (ira), literally “male drug of Namtar,” the devil god.53 An Arabic word for mandrake is “devil’s testi-cles,” and, as already given, the common English name is “devil’s apple.” Similarly a German word for mandrake is Zauberwurzel (“sorcerers’ root”). In the eleventh cen-tury, Hildegard of Bingen understood: “In mandragora [mandrake] the influence of 9780230610644ts05.indd 649780230610644ts05.indd 6412/7/2009 5:34:24 PM12/7/2009 5:34:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"65Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionsthe devil is more present than in other herbs.”54 In Germany, where Hildegard lived, a mandrake was placed under a bridal bed.55Sumerian Love ApplesIn the first chapter we saw the incantation to Inanna with these lines:“Inanna, who loves apples (giš.hašhur) and pomegranates (giš. nu.u’r.ma), has brought forth potency.”56 Probably the word giš.hašhur is mandrake rather than our domestic apple as traditionally translated. Giš is the predeterminate meaning, what follows is a small tree. To repeat what was said in chapter one, our domestic apple trees do not grow in a hot climate, such as Mesopotamia, and there are no depictions of the apple in the art and artifacts of the land between the rivers. In the Inanna incantation, we have the juxtaposition, again, of a drug that stimulates love (i.e., an aphrodisiac) and fertility against one that prevents conception. Although Thompson and the Sumerian word-list identify giš.hašhur as the cypress or Persian oak tree or its resin (“abundance” + “to pour” + “tree trunk”),57 I tentatively propose that the Sumerian love-apple plant is the mandrake.Two Opposite TraditionsHow do we reconcile the two traditions? On one hand, the mandrake is an invalu-able aid in reversing infertility. In contrast, mandrake is associated with the Devil or Evil, going back to the male god, Namtar, the devil god. Mandrake is a good, benign, and blessed herb, according to one tradition and, according to another, a plant that works evil. In 1630, three women in Hamburg were sentenced to death for merely having mandrakes in their homes.58 An answer to the dichotomy lies, I believe, in what the mandrake did as a drug.Ancient Medicinal ActionsWhereas Egyptian medical sources, most of which date before the mandrake intro-duction into Egypt, are silent, the Assyrian texts are filled with mandrake in pre-scriptions, mostly as a narcotic and sedative. One recipe for headache, constipation, muscular inflammations, to name some symptoms, contains both mandrake and opium.59 Recipes containing mandrake (usually specified as male mandrake) were given for difficulty in urination, male penis “dribbling,” hemorrhoids (suppository), constipation (suppository), rectal disease, and general rectal and urinary problems.60 Another recipe places the male mandrake (juice?) alone on a tooth that aches.61 Two more recipes contain male mandrake for chapped lips, another recipe includes mandrake that is used for a variety of oral problems (some of which are lost in the text),62 and there is another for excessive salivation.63 Other recipes include the mandrake for liver complaints, difficulty in breathing, jaundice, and difficulty with child delivery.64 The latter may appear as magic, because the text says to rub on the womb seven times the “root of Namtar-ira [ira=male] from the north.”65 The action is probably not magic but science: the medicinal action of a sedative-narcotic can be absorbed through the mucosa.9780230610644ts05.indd 659780230610644ts05.indd 6512/7/2009 5:34:24 PM12/7/2009 5:34:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches66Mandrake’s Medicinal ActionsGreek mythology and modern science intersect with the preferred Linnaean binominal name for mandrake: Atropa mandragora. Early in the cosmos’ creation, the gods produced the three fates, to which all are bound: Clotho (a spinner who weaves the thread of life), Lachesis (chance), and Atropa (inescapable fate from which there is no appeal).66 An example of Atropa’s action in our time is genetics and in Hellenic times deadly poisons. One of the meanings for the Greek term pharmakon was poison, but the Greeks knew that some poisons taken correctly for the right purposes could act beneficially. Mandrake is an anticholinergic drug whose action is caused by occupying the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Today, almost anyone older than forty years had atropine—the chemical name coming from the fate Atropa—administered for ophthalmic use as a drop to dilate the eye. In present practices, it is less frequently used in ophthalmology. Among present uses are as a resuscitation for bradycardia (slow heart function often associated, in layman’s terms, with a heart attack) because its action on the vagus nerve causes heart rate to increase.67 Other plants containing atropine are belladonna (Atropa belladonna L.), henbane (Hyoscymus niger L. + spp), and hemlock (Conium macu-latum L.), the latter famous as the fatal poison drunk by Socrates. As benign and useful as a drug it may be still, plants containing pharmacologically active concen-trations of atropine and related tropane alkaloids are, nevertheless, deadly poisons. The difference between a drug and a poison lies in the concentration, administra-tion (applicant or oral), and frequency. As we examine mandrake’s historical uses, do keep this fact in mind.Even though the primary pharmacologically active constituents are atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine, mandrake has more than eighty compounds. Whereas we may isolate a compound, even synthetically manufacture it, there is the possibility that other compounds act in synergy and affect the crude drug’s action. To repeat: the tropane compounds act as a nonselective competitive antag-onist of cholinesterase at muscarinic cholinergic receptors. By blocking muscarinic action, it inhibits sweat and saliva production and contributes to a relaxation of smooth muscles (known as parasympatholytic action), just as stated in the Assyrian recipes. Hyoscyamine bypasses the blood-brain membranes and affects the central nervous system.68 Hyoscyamine sulfate is sold today as a prescription drug (Levsin is its proprietary name).69 Atropine (and related compounds) is employed today in prescription pharmacy (proprietary name, AccuHist) but to be used with numerous precautions and special care.70 Historically, it was used also as sedative (in small amounts), anesthetic, and anodyne. James Duke, American’s premier scientist on medicinal herbs, has listed among the actions of the mandrake: anesthetic, cathar-tic, cholagogue, emetic, hypnotic, mydriatic, narcotic, poison, nervine, purgative, refrigerant, sedative, and stimulant.71 To this list I shall add anodyne and soporific, perhaps imbedded in actions Duke says.72 In low doses of mandrake’s compounds, the effects are virtually limited to the stimulation of vagal (nerve) and respiratory system, but in higher dosages disorientation, hallucinations,73 and comatose state ensues, and, still higher, death. Also, presumably on the basis of historical use, Duke said that mandrake was an aphrodisiac, a subject to which we shall return after 9780230610644ts05.indd 669780230610644ts05.indd 6612/7/2009 5:34:24 PM12/7/2009 5:34:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"67Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionsexamining historically one leading action, as an anesthesia, and general uses as given by prominent classical medical authorities.“The Gift of Showing Mercy”A modern anesthesiologist, Robert Holtzman, explored mandrake’s use in surgery.74 Its use in Western medicine continued until shortly after 1846, when volatile anes-thetic drugs replaced it and other natural drug agents. John Scarborough, a distin-guished historian of ancient pharmacy and medicine, has a far more detailed study on mandrake in ancient surgery.75 Popular wisdom holds that before the late nine-teenth century, deep surgery, especially abdominal and limb amputation procedures mostly entailed having the patient endure the procedure while a surgeon hurried the process quickly, not only for his patient’s pain but also to diminish death by shock. A personal note on my family history: my great-grandfather who lived to within two years of my birth, received a gunshot wound at Chickamauga in the American Civil War. He lay on the battlefield for two days until he was found and carried to a field hospital. The surgeon took one look and said that the leg must be amputated; he pointed to the whiskey barrel to which my ancestor crawled and drank. The more he drank the more he insisted that the leg would not come off. The surgeon said that was fine with him, but he issued his prognostication: death. My grandfather did not die but lived with the lead bullet in his leg and took progressive amounts of opium until his death in a fire in 1935. From the nineteenth century through the present, atropine drugs were not abandoned; they were administered as a premedica-tion drug to prevent side effects of anesthesia.76 The point of the story is this: why, when atropine was available and better than alcohol, was it employed less frequently from the classical era to the Civil War?Greek Medical Authorities on the MandrakeLet us survey some leading classical medical authorities on the mandrake’s actions before addressing the question about reproductive physiology. The general pharma-ceutical usage underlying the discussion is as a fertility enhancer. We begin with “Hippocrates.”Hippocratic Works (ca. 440–330 BCE): The earliest surviving Greek medi-cal writings of any consequence are those attributed to Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, but these works were actually composed by many writers in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. Mandrake was not a prominent drug, but it clearly had use as a strong narcotic and sedative. One having quartan fever (malaria) was to take a prescription to purge his bowels and then his head; if the fever persisted for two more days, he was to take henbane seed equal to the quantity of millet-seed, the same amount of mandrake [presumably the root], the mandrake juice in the amount of three beans, and the same quantity of clover juice. These drugs were mixed with undiluted wine and drunk.77 Quartan fever is caused by mosquitoes car-rying Plasmodium malariae,78 a parasitic protozoon, and is also known as “benign malaria,” since the infection, although long-lasting in seventy-two hour periods (hence, “quartan” or “four”), is seldom fatal. Fevers occur for day-day intervals, 9780230610644ts05.indd 679780230610644ts05.indd 6712/7/2009 5:34:24 PM12/7/2009 5:34:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches68hence no fever on the fifth day. The laxative and headache remedy is mild, and the prescription containing mandrake (and henbane, which has a similar action) is in a small dosage and given only after the third or fourth day, when rest would be helpful for recovery but would not interfere with immune response to the infectious agent.Mandrake’s use as a drug in other Hippocratic works is consistent with its nar-cotic and sedative effects. Examples: take for the treatment of madness79 with a ten-dency toward suicide the root of the mandrake in a small amount in the morning should the person become delirious.80 For a condition of vaginal bleeding, man-drake juice was applied on wool as an applicant to enable the woman to sleep.81 For an inflamed rectum fresh mandrake juice should be boiled in diluted wine and applied as a plaster.82 For a person whose chronic illness makes him suicidal, he should drink mandrake juice in an amount less than what would lead to delirium. Similarly the juice should be given to one who has had a convulsion, and, again, in an amount less than that causing delirium.83 A pessary was given to awaken or to stimulate (energon) a woman with mandrake juice and colocynth (Citrullus colocyn-this) given in milk.84 But, in the lengthy three-book treatise on women’s diseases, mandrake is not included among the drugs that help women to conceive. Does this mean that mandrake was no longer employed to enhance fertility? No, it means only that the surviving Hippocratic works do not prescribe it for fertility; where the Hippocratic writers employed the drug, its use is rational according to our under-standing of its actions.Theophrastus (371–287 BCE): The author of the earliest herbal appearing as Book Nine of his Enquiry into Plants has scant mention of mandrake’s medicinal qualities, unlike most herbs that have more detail, but he includes it in a list of four plants that induce sleep (hypnos) and act as a love potion (philtron). Theophrastus did, however, relate folk use about the mandrake with similarities to Harry Potter story that we saw earlier in this chapter.Dioscorides (fl. 50–70 CE): As the author of a pharmacy guide in five books, Dioscorides was considered the foremost authority on the subject for 1,500 years. There are two kinds, male and female, he repeated, because the gender differen-tiation of mandrake plants was part of the folklore in antiquity. A chemical study of two distinct species (M. autuminalis Bertol. and M. vernalis Bertol.) showed some differentiation on the basis of their alkaloid content but within the range of normal biological variation.85 In other words, the differences between “male” and “female,” assuming the differences were botanical, would have been negligible. Dioscorides gave instructions about the preparation of mandrake juice as a drug taken with sweet wine and three cyathoi [=.approx. 0.137 liters] for those about to undergo surgery: “for they become unaware of the pain because they sink into deep sleep.”86 Just as did Theophrastus, Dioscorides related that the mandrake root was “good for making love-potions.”87 The organization for relating natural- product drugs devised by Dioscorides was to arrange by drug-affinities. Thus, if one did not have access to one drug, the drug either just in front or behind had similar physiological effects and might be a substitute. Before the mandrake (4. 75) Dioscorides described Convolvulus ovalifolius L. (4. 74) as a soporific (sleep induc-ing) and for “love-potions,” but he cautioned, if taken in excess, the plant can be fatal. Aphrodisiacs are separate functions from aids to conception, although there is 9780230610644ts05.indd 689780230610644ts05.indd 6812/7/2009 5:34:25 PM12/7/2009 5:34:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"69Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionsthe obvious connection. Indeed, Dioscorides specifically recommends three drugs that “aid” conception: darnel (Lolium temulentum L.), wild carrot (Daucus carota L.), and rabbit rennet.88 Rennet, Dioscorides says, “aids conception, but if drunk after menstruation, it causes barrenness.”89 Dioscorides made distinctions between an aphrodisiac (or love-potion or philter) and an aid for conception. Peter V. Taberner studied aphrodisiacs historically and concluded that there is no known mechanism of action,90 although since the publication of his study (c. 1985), we have seen the drug, sildenafil citrate under the proprietary name of Viagra. Sildenafil citrate was first given for hypertension and angina pectoris, and, after usage, was found good for erectile dysfunction. The compound is a synthetic; no plant that I have found mimics its action. As Michael McCormick said, “The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”91 Among the ways aphrodisiacs may have “worked” is simply to make a person more receptive to sexual relations.Leah’s and Rachel’s problems were not a deficiency of desire but an inability to conceive. Dioscorides distinguished between aphrodisiacs and aids to conception and so shall we. The remainder of Dioscorides’s chapter on the mandrake is gen-erally consistent with what we know of its medicinal actions: soporific, analgesic, anodyne, with ophthalmologic applications.Galen (ca. 129–post-210 CE): Galen is the classical world’s preeminent medical writer, based on voluminous surviving works in one edition of twenty-two volumes in modern print and still there were more titles omitted in that edition. Throughout his works there are infrequent mentions of mandrake and, when he observed it, gen-erally it was to place it in the category of extremely cooling remedies and poisons. Following the humoral theory of addressing drug therapies by opposites, under narcotics (our term) Galen (and his sources) placed mandrake as cooling because of its dulling, soporific, and depressant to the nerves. Often he listed mandrake together with opium poppy, hemlock, and henbane and explained that, while useful as drugs, they were potentially fatal.92 Similar to opium, mandrake may feel warm-ing to the patient but its effect is extreme cooling.93 It works as an anodyne,94 but it leads to extreme constipation and a comatose state.95 Notably, Galen prescribed its use neither to enhance fertility nor as an aphrodisiac.Soranus (fl. 98–138 CE): Soranus is the greatest medical writer on gynecology to survive from antiquity. Soranus covers most aspects of women’s medical and repro-ductive problems in detail (including contraception and abortion), but, on the mat-ter of infertility, he is mostly silent, as was Galen. Women of childbearing age who are sterile, he briefly stated were undernourished, extremely thin, or very fat.96 Using an earlier authority, Diocles of Carystos (fl. fourth century BCE), Soranus related a test for fertility: give to a woman a vaginal suppository consisting of such substances as resin, rue, garlic, nosesmart (a type of cress in the genus Nasturtium), and corian-der. If the woman tastes the substances through an upward flow to her mouth, she is fertile.97 Neither Galen nor Soranus had treatments for infertility. One explanation for the paucity of attention given to fertility enhancers in classical sources and the greater attention in those of ancient West Asia and Egypt is that the cultures gave lit-tle emphasis to childbearing and, indeed, the lower birthrate was a cause of concern for the Roman Imperial government. Dioscorides, on the other hand, named the following substances that cause barrenness (infertility): juniper (applicant to vagina; 9780230610644ts05.indd 699780230610644ts05.indd 6912/7/2009 5:34:25 PM12/7/2009 5:34:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches701.77.2); white poplar (orally); rabbit rennet (2. 19; 2.75), menstrual blood (applicant; 2. 79. 2); cultivated cabbage (as pessary, 2. 120.3); pepper (applied after intercourse; 2. 159.3); ivy (drunk after cessation of menstruation, 2.179.3); green mint (pessary before intercourse, 3.34.2); axe weed (Securigira securidaca L; pessary before inter-course, 3. 130); miltwaste (Ceterach officinarum Willd. hung by itself or with a mule’s hoof, 3. 134. 2); Epimedion (?, 4. 19); bracken (Pteris aquiline L., orally causes both barrenness and an abortion); iron rust (5. 80); alum (5.106. 6—also used for same in Assyrian recipes); and clay stone (5. 146, drunk for four days). Of these, eight substances were also either contraceptives or abortifacients. The amount and frequency would determine whether infertility was temporary or permanent. The point to be made is that Dioscorides believed infertility could result from drug sub-stances purposefully or inadvertently taken. Several of the above Dioscorides related because of folk-belief, not that which he endorsed them, since he added such phrases as: “it is believed . . . .” and “they say . . . .” The remarkable point is that Dioscorides, Galen, and Soranus gave little attention to infertility reversals.Latin Medical WritersPliny the Elder (23–79 CE) wrote The Natural History, a general encyclopedia of lore, in which he made many references to mandrake in treatments for scrofula, superfi-cial abscesses (applicant), gout, erysipelas, and ulcers.98 Under diseases of woman he listed mandrake juice orally to purge the uterus (emmenagogue), to remove a dead fetus, and to check excessive menstruation, but not to promote fertility.99 He named two unidentified herbs: arsenogonon, which, when drunk, causes the conception of a male and thelygonon the conception of a female “if we care to believe it,” he added.100 But under wines he was probably referencing mandrake wine without naming it when he wrote: “A kind of wine in Arcadia [a region in Greece] said to produce abil-ity to produce children in women and madness in men.”101 Reasonably, this wine may be assumed to be the famous mandrake wine that earlier we saw about man-drake in ancient Egypt. Similarly Celsus (ca. 25 BCE–ca. 50 CE), a Latin medical writer, picked up some folklore when he wrote that some induce sleep by draughts of poppy or hyoscyamus, while others put mandrake apples under their pillow for sleep.102 Columella referred simply to “the maddening flowers of mandrake.”103 (The hyoscyamus plant has virtually the same medicinal effects as mandrake.) Just as with the Greek medical writers, the Latin writers were virtually unmindful of fertility enhancers.Classical Anecdotal DataEven more than the classical medical writings, anecdotal information sheds more light on mandrake use (including as a possible fertility enhancer). Socrates was dis-cussing wine-drinking at a symposium when he said (according to Xenophon): “For wine does of a truth ‘moisten the soul’ and lull our griefs to sleep just as the man-dragora [mandrake] does with men, at the same time awakening kindly feelings as oil quickens a flame.”104 Ironically, Socrates would die from a lethal dose of hem-lock that contained many of the same compounds as those found in the plant, the 9780230610644ts05.indd 709780230610644ts05.indd 7012/7/2009 5:34:25 PM12/7/2009 5:34:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"71Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionsmandrake, about which he had spoken so fondly. Another author, Apuleius, told a story about a villain seeking to remove one of his enemies by asking a physician (medicus) to supply him with a deadly poison. The doctor acting on his understand-ing of the Hippocratic Oath, said: “And so I [gave him] a drug, but a soporific, mandragora, well known for its proven lethargic effect, which produces a coma very like death.”105 The happy result for all but the villain was that the poisoned boy, the physician speculated, would merely go to into a comatose state for a long enough period for the villain to celebrate before the boy would awake from a long but pleas-ant sleep. Mandrake’s strong soporific qualities are discussed in a number of ways by such authorities as Plato, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Philo Judaeus, Polyaenus, Lucian, Plutarch, Macrobius, Cyrillus (Commentary on Genesis), Theodoretus, and Frontinus.106 Julius Caesar cleverly saved himself by using mandrake wine to cap-ture his enemies. When he was taken by pirates as a youth and ransomed for too little, he thought, young Julius doubled the ransom and planned a farewell banquet for his captors. He served mandrake wine and, when they fell into a stupor, he had them captured and executed.107 Mandrake’s soporific use is well attested in classical literary sources including those as widely apart as Aristotle (fourth century BCE) and Isidore (seventh century CE).108Frontinus (ca. 50–103 CE) told about how Maharbal, Hannibal’s cavalry general, tricked the rebellious Africans around Carthage. He feigned a retreat and left in his camp copious amounts of mandrake-laced wine “which in potency is something between a poison and a soporific [inter venenum ac soporem],” Frontinus related. His enemies captured the camp, drank the wine, and fell into a stupor. Upon sobri-ety, they were prisoners.109 Alexis (375—270 BCE), a New Comedy writer, wrote a play entitled “The Mandrake,” wherein the heroine drugged herself for a plot that is too obscure to reconstruct.110 While not naming mandrake, Caelius Aurelianus said that madness (mania) can come from “the drinking of drugs, especially those intended to excite love.”111 Plutarch, normally a rationalist, delivered the most unbe-lievable story: mandrake is so powerful that, when it grows near grape vines, it imparts its soporific forces through the soil and into the wine.112 And Hesychius provided the shortest reference: “A kind of plant, intoxicating (? oinikon) and sopo-rific (hypnōtikon)” and curiously said it was also called “The Zeus.”113Mandrake as PoisonSome modern writers state that mandrake as a poison receives more modern atten-tion than it deserves based on confusing gossip about the Roman imperial household. A number of respected Roman historians—Tacitus, Suetonius, Dio114—willfully related gossip by alleging that Livia poisoned Augustus and Agrippina poisoned Claudius; modern authors have refined the vague accusations to assert that these women used mushrooms and figs laced with poisons of mandrake and/or bella-donna.115 While the descriptions may have pointed to mandrake or mandrake-related poisons, the clandestine poisonings in the imperial household are probably fiction, good fiction, but fiction nevertheless. M. P. Charlesworth long ago, before Robert Graves spun the delightful novel I, Claudius, said the allegation is “utter absurdity and baselessness of such a notion . . . it is merely part and parcel of the ridiculous 9780230610644ts05.indd 719780230610644ts05.indd 7112/7/2009 5:34:25 PM12/7/2009 5:34:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches72canard” that the emperors and their wives were notorious criminals.116 Mandrake is more famous in modern writings about the imperial period than it deserves to be.The “Apple” as Fertility Enhancer in the Garden of EdenA collection of tales known as Physiologus, as we have it, was written in Greek and Armenian probably in the second (some say, third) century of our era and tells information, much fanciful, about animals whose traits exemplify traits that good people should emulate. A Hellenistic Jew may have been its first author, especially considering the biblical quotations and allusions, but the version that we have is clearly Christianized. If it existed in Hebrew, we have no copy. Whether Christian or not, it was readily adapted to Christian precept education and eventually ele-ments incorporated in a genre of literature known as bestiaries.117 The Greek and Armenian versions do not include the mandrake, but the Latin bestiaries, derived from Physiologus, tell about the elephant.118 The elephant is drawn beside a male and female mandrake. The tale startlingly brings us back to the mandrake as a fer-tility enhancer and as the fruit of knowledge in the Genesis Garden of Eden story (Chapter 2).Now the Elephant and his wife represent Adam and Eve. For when they were pleasing to God, before their provocation in the flesh, they knew nothing about copulation nor had they knowledge of sin. When, however, the wife ate of the Tree of Knowledge, which is what Mandragora means, and gave of the fruits to her man, she was immedi-ately made a wanderer and they had to clear out of Paradise on account of it. For, all the time that they were in Paradise, Adam did not know her. But then, the Scriptures say: “Adam went in to his wife and she conceived and bore Cain, upon the waters of tribulation.”119Another version has more detail:The elephant and his mate go there, and she picks a fruit from the tree and gives it to him. And she seduces him into eating it; after they have both eaten it, they mate and the female at once conceives . . . The elephant and his wife represent Adam and his wife, who pleased God in the flesh before their sin, and knew nothing of mating or of sin. When the woman ate of the tree, that is, gave the herb mandragora which brought understanding to her husband, she became pregnant and for that reason left paradise.120Theobaldus (eleventh century) wrote a Latin version of Physiologus in which he probably collapsed the details, but Theobaldus said that Adam “fell because of the wood of a tree (per lignum),” not naming the tree but tying the disobedience to the tree of knowledge.121 Michael Glykas, a Byzantine historian writing about 1118, wrote in reference to the mandrake: “Clearly this is a symbol of our first parents, for before these had tasted of the fruit of wood, the life they led was even as that of the angels, but when they tasted it and the transgression had been committed, then Adam knew Eve as his wife.”122 An earlier Latin version identifies the “tree” 9780230610644ts05.indd 729780230610644ts05.indd 7212/7/2009 5:34:25 PM12/7/2009 5:34:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"73Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionsas the mandrake: quando autem mulier manducauit de lingo (hoc est intellegibilem mandracoram).123 Hildegard of Bingen (eleventh century) believed that the man-drake was the clay that God used to form Adam.124 Max Wellmann believed that the mandrake-Garden of Eden story goes back to an unidentified Jewish source.125 The Syriac version of Hermes Trismegistos contained a story in which King Solomon had a mandrake in his signet ring whose miraculous qualities enabled women to give safe birth without pain.126 A later medieval German text related to Physiologus says that when a man wants children he takes his mate to paradise there to find a mandrake.127The Latin bestiaries incorporate the elephant story. The bestiaries proved a very popular literary form from the eleventh century. Christian symbolism easily made elephants as the model for ideal human behavior because they were “devoid of all appetite for sexual intercourse” and, when they occasionally had sexual relations, the purpose was solely procreation128; they enacted procreation by going to paradise and eating the mandrake.129 The elephant was “the Ideal Spouse.”130 Most bestiary versions repeat that the elephant represents Adam and Eve when they were “pleas-ing to God” and did not know about copulation nor could they sin. Eve ate of “the Tree of Knowledge, which is what Mandragora means” and immediately gave it to Adam. For this act (the text drops the serpent and disobedience), they were expelled from “Paradise.” “Adam went in to his wife and she conceived and bore Cain, upon the waters of tribulation.”131 This is amazing: not only is the Forbidden Fruit the mandrake but the plant imparted “understanding” to both her and Adam and, with it, she became pregnant. And, according to another version quoted earlier, Eve’s act of eating the mandrake caused her and Adam to conceive, but her persuasion of Adam to eat it in the first place caused him to have understanding (reason).132Returning to the Question about Mandrake and FertilityHow does one reconcile the omission of mandrake as a fertility agent in the medical writings and literary anecdotal writings? We have come virtually full circle from the incantation of Inanna where she invokes, I postulate, the pomegranate and the mandrake, to the medieval stories that equated Genesis’ tree of knowledge with the mandrake. Moreover, in an early Physiologus version, the mandrake enabled Eve to conceive. How do we reconcile mandrake’s omission in the medical writings for fertility, when these same writings prescribe its use as a soporific, narcotic and in other ways compatible with modern science’s findings? Both literary and medical sources have allusions to its use as a love-potion but there is nothing explicit about its enhancing fertility, as stated in Genesis.Syriac MedicineProbably in Edessa, fourth century CE, an unknown author or authors wrote in the Syriac language a fairly comprehensive “Book of Medicines.” Throughout, there are prescriptions for mandrake in much the same way as with Greek medical writers, some of whom served as sources for the Syriac author(s). Appended to the 9780230610644ts05.indd 739780230610644ts05.indd 7312/7/2009 5:34:26 PM12/7/2009 5:34:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches74manuscript were miscellaneous native prescriptions, among which was this one, the first herb of which cannot be easily identified:Concerning the root sĕphînâytâ. It is yellow, and is like hyoscyamus, and it beareth berries. It is good for the man who hath jaundice. Take of it a piece of the size of the chickpea, and throw it into wine, and give it to the patient to drink morning and eve-ning, for two days. It is good for [the bites of] snakes. Take the seed of this root, and the seed of hyoscyamus, and the seed of mandragora, that is to say, of tûryagh, pound it, and drink it in wine, and thou wilt not wake up for three days. The root of this plant and its seed are good for inducing conception in women.133Sĕphînâytâ’s description of medicinal value from root and pale yellowish flowers fits the belladonna, whose medicinal action is much the same as mandrake (man-dragora, whose flowers vary from pale white to light yellow). The Syriac source may have meant differing species of mandrake, as classical sources probably did when they referred to the male and female mandrakes. Even if the plant is not mandrake (since mandrake is specifically listed), the likelihood of its being belladonna further reinforces our interpretation. The mixture of belladonna, hyoscyamus (Hyoscyamus spp.), and mandrake is virtually mixing the same active compounds. Hyoscyamus is of the same Solanaceae family. Thus, after an absence of more than a thousand years in the surviving medical literature, we find the mandrake and plants with similar compounds as “inducing conception in women.” Now, we return to the question that began the chapter: did mandrake actually work to enhance female fertility?The Mystery of Mandrake’s Fertility ActionMost modern writers on the mandrake, if they even speak to the subject, interject that there is no known pharmacological action for the mandrake causing an infer-tile female to conceive. Such was the muse of the eminent physician and scholar of biblical medicine, Samuel S. Kottek.134 Julius Preuss, a scholar of biblical botany, opined that there is “no evidence for or against the efficacy of the mandrakes.” He asserted, however, that no medicine can be effective without God’s blessings but “even God employs natural means.”135 In speaking of Leah, Rachel, and the man-drake, St. Augustine of Hippo wrote: “Some people hold the opinion that this fruit appears to have the ability to make a sterile woman fertile . . . but I do not agree with this.”136 He said that he had examined the fruit by its sight, smell, and taste and found no quality that would explain the action. Instead, he said that God, not the plant, had opened the wombs. St. Augustine was arguably the Christian world’s foremost theologian, but herbal medicine did not rank high in his learning. Going beyond—way beyond—Augustine’s research methodology, I searched the library stacks, including those shelves with medical and pharmaceutical journals and the Internet (where mandrake lore is manifestly popular). In addition, I sent email que-ries to a number of fertility and herbal experts. No one cited a laboratory study. For all who answered—most did—I thank you without giving your name. All of the few scientists from whom I sought permission to cite agreed.9780230610644ts05.indd 749780230610644ts05.indd 7412/7/2009 5:34:26 PM12/7/2009 5:34:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"75Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s ReligionsMechanism for Action as Fertility EnhancerFour medicinal chemists in the School of Pharmacy, Hebrew Union University, Jerusalem, conducted a thorough review (in 2005) of mandrake’s chemistry. To be sure, these chemists gave attention to the biblical accounts that the mandrake promotes female fertility. They concluded: “The chemical principle of its ‘magic’ (hallucinogenic and poisonous) properties is today well known, but to understand its ‘aphrodisiac’ (‘love’) properties, still more analytical work would [sic. “needs to be”] done.”137 What little attention chemists have given to mandrake as an anti-fertility agent—and that is virtually none because all the guides say in effect its action, if any, is unknown—has been because of its action as an anticholinergic drug. I propose its action is more related to its attested “magic” actions, as these chemists called them.Proposed Mechanism for ActionWriting for WebMD, Colette Bouchez shares these reactions given to women who were unable to conceive:You’re just trying too hard.You’re too stressed. Just relax and it will happen.You’ve got to calm down and let nature take its course.138To this list, I add this one because I have heard it frequently:Just take out adoption papers and see if you don’t get pregnant.This same article says that approximately 30 percent of all infertility problems are attributable to stress. A statistical study conducted on the psychological impact of infertility found stress attributed to infertility is a factor that is statistically equal to stress felt by patients with cancer, hypertension, and heart disease.139Infertility carries serious psychological impact in modern studies with contem-porary patients, even though many infertile couples profess to have marital and sexual satisfaction. Ovulatory function is affected by stress and in no minor way.140 A medical authority, Frederick Kakis, states flatly: “Female infertility is always in one way or another linked with problems of ovulation.”141 Stress causes or is a major part of an estimated 30 percent of infertility problems in modern women.142 Whereas designing clinical trials for a human is a difficult way to test the working hypothesis, doctors of veterinary medicine are persuaded that the “stress factor” is “very real in animal infertility,” according to Robyn Wilborn and Brian Whitlock of Auburn University. Even though stress is different in animals compared to that in humans, stress produces the same physiological effects (cortisol and endogenous opi-oids) that suppress gonadotropins, which make ovulation possible.143 Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on human female reproductive sys-tems. In the technical terms of a recent journal article on humans: “Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) inhibits hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone 9780230610644ts05.indd 759780230610644ts05.indd 7512/7/2009 5:34:26 PM12/7/2009 5:34:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches76(GnRH) secretion, and blucocorticoids inhibit pituitary luteinizing hormone and ovarian estrogen and progesterone secretions.”144 The pituitary LH (luteinizing hor-mone) is necessary for ovulation and ovarian progesterone and therefore necessary for maintenance of pregnancy.ConclusionStress affects modern women’s fertility, say many modern studies. If as many as 30 percent of modern women are infertile because of stress as a major or, in some cases, exclusive factor, one needs a multiplier to measure the stress on the wives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Not only was fertility of paramount importance in their society: God had commanded them to multiply and, in addition, God prophesied that the children of their husbands would form a nation of chosen people. I cannot think of a more stressful situation for those women. A tranquilizer would definitely be in order—or anything else to reduce stress!145 The classical medical sources elo-quently testify that a small amount of mandrake was useful to relax and to induce sleep—what we call stress therapy. The mandrake that Reuben found in the field was just such a tranquilizer for Leah and Rachel and presumably for other women in the former matriarchal society as it turned strongly patriarchal. The ancients used mandrake as a drug in most ways that we know to be rational. Why should we not trust the Bible when it says the plant gave to the Jewish nation Joseph and four of its tribes? From this lineage came the House of David and the family of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus. God opened Sarah’s womb (possibly naturally through the mandrake) and from her womb came the lineage for the Jews, Muslims, and Christians. So it is believed. Like the pomegranate, the mandrake plant was an important factor in human history. Mandrake was a powerful drug but it was misused and came to be used by the devil; so it was believed in the Middle Ages, and, as we shall see in the last chapter, there were grounds for that belief also.EpilogueA few years ago a group of American students and I visited the Egyptian Coptic mon-astery of St. Mina (or Menas) in the Amriya district in the desert roughly between Cairo and Alexandria. The monastery is a famous pilgrimage site for infertility. As pilgrims, infertile people will be given a vial of St. Mina oil. Accompanying us was an Egyptian Coptic Christian who had his son, age seven (as I recall), who was a product of St. Mina’s miracle. The couple was infertile; incidentally our friend was trained in medicine. He and his wife visited the monastery and received the holy oil. Shortly thereafter a son was conceived whom they named Mina after the Saint. Monks at the monastery told the story of a man who, in a similar condition, received the oil but returned approximately ten years later, reported that he and his wife had had seven children, and he now wanted an oil to reverse fertility. The monks told him the miracle worked in only one direction and could not be reversed.Why tell this story in the context of mandrake? I am aware of the positive effects that placebos can have and how important religious devotion and prayer may be. That acknowledged, one placebo is as good as another (provided no harm, of 9780230610644ts05.indd 769780230610644ts05.indd 7612/7/2009 5:34:26 PM12/7/2009 5:34:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"77Mandrake, Love Apple, and World’s Religionscourse). The mandrake was not a placebo; it had positive pharmacological action that is based on the weight of historical evidence and on the understanding of the modern science of reproductive physiology.146 The mandrake assisted in conception when stress was an inhibiting factor.While we reserve the final chapter for reporting how mandrake came to be per-ceived as the Devil’s helper, not the positive joy of children, the mandrake sur-vived the medieval period as a female fertility agent. Frustrated by his inability to persuade contemporary Florentines on political issues (as he did in the Prince and Discourses on Livy), Niccolò Machiavelli (d. 1527) turned to comedy as a trial vehi-cle. Mandragola (“The Mandrake”) is a play in which he said in the Prologue: “La favola Mandragola si chiama: la cagion voi vidrete/ Our tale’s named for the man-drake root. You’ll see the reason as we play it.”147 The plot turned on the mandrake’s fertility enhancing qualities. Two clever guys sought to seduce a beautiful, faithful wife of a wealthy merchant who was childless. The clever ones persuaded the hus-band to give his wife a potion made of the mandrake root for her to conceive—the husband believing that he was the most virile man in Florence and therefore could not be the problem. The hitch was that he is told that, while it will cause his wife to conceive, the first person to have intercourse with her following the mandrake’s administration would die within a week. Thereafter, he could have safe sex with his wife and conceive. Well, not to betray the play’s unfolding of events readily seen by modern sophisticated readers, Machiavelli knew already that his audience would know the mandrake’s effects because he did not elaborate with explanations to enlighten his early sixteenth-century audience. Using poetic license, he modified its death-inducing legend in order to have his character seduce (with happy results) a beautiful woman, showing, I presume, what a clever prince could do with policies by “spinning” parts of “truth” in order to obtain desirable objectives.“No lustful woman came this plant to grieve,” John Donne (d. 1631) explained.148 In closing, here is my favorite mandrake poem by Donne who knew and believed in the mandrake’s fecundity: His poem:Go and catch a falling starGet with child a mandrake rootTell me where all past years are,who cleft the Devil’s foot.1499780230610644ts05.indd 779780230610644ts05.indd 7712/7/2009 5:34:27 PM12/7/2009 5:34:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 4Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”There are some who think that the surname [for the plant] is derived from Artemis Ilithyia, because the plant is specific for the troubles of women.—Pliny, Natural History, 25. 34. 73Ilithyia, or Eileithyia, was the goddess of childbirth and labor pains, and, as Pliny implied, the deities Ilithyia and Artemis eventually became one. When they were separate goddesses, Artemis was the more honored. St. Paul encountered Artemis worshippers in Ephesus and spoke of the intensity of their devotion (Acts 19: 23–40); in assembly for two hours the Ephesians chanted: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” “She whom all Asia and the world worship,” Paul was told as he val-iantly attempted to convey another message. Some authorities say that Artemis was the most popular of the Greek deities whereas others cautiously say one of the most popular. In her earlier form, she was an agricultural goddess in Arcadia (Greece) where she also became the goddess of the forest and hunt. Some ancient accounts present her as the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, or Persephone (who may be con-flated into one). Her twin brother was Apollo beside whom she was frequently represented (as we shall see below on the Selinus coin). Before marriage women gave clothes to Artemis, and in turn, she protected pregnancies. After giving birth, women dedicated their prenatal clothing to the goddess. The temple functioned as an ancient equivalent of Goodwill Industries. Women and men associated Artemis with the woodlands and her being surrounded by nymphs. Artemis was “deadly and remorseless toward those who threaten her chastity” and, with equal energy, she pro-tected the young and mothers of all animals, even though, seemingly incongruously, she headed the hunt.1 A later legend about a woman named Artemisia, who married Mausolus (d. 353 BCE), dynasty of Caria, was later confused as the person who gave the plant its name. In legend or in fact, Artemisia was so grieved by the death of her husband that she gave him a magnificent tomb, hence the name “mausoleum.”2 This story confused many later writers, such as Gerard in his 1636 Herball who wrote: “Mugwort [A. vulgaris L.] is called in Latine, Artemisia, which name it had of Artemisia, Queene of Halicarnassus, and wife of noble Mausolus, King of Caria, 9780230610644ts06.indd 799780230610644ts06.indd 7912/7/2009 3:11:27 PM12/7/2009 3:11:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches80who adopted it for her owne herbe.”3 However, in antiquity, the name for the herb came from the virgin goddess, not the queen and wife of Mausolus.Artemis could be vengeful; for example, she ordered Iphigenia’s sacrifice before the Greeks could sail to Troy in Euripides’ play Iphigenia at Aulis. Later, after Euripides and as a result of the ancient equivalent of political correctness, Artemis was said to have taken pity on the young woman and substituted a deer as a sacri-fice. When Leto gave birth to Artemis, Leto suffered no pain; when Leto gave birth to Apollo, Artemis gave her mother assistance with a difficult birth.4 Physicians, midwives, and “wise women” who assisted others in birth employed the plant for difficult births. Primarily, we surmise, this was why artemisia was called the mother herb. Always a virgin and subject to no man, Artemis’s purpose was to protect women and wildlife.In Sparta there was the festival of Artemis Orthia, when young Spartan boys would be seized and whipped, some to death. The origins of this brutal ritual was said to have been when a wooden statue of Artemis was kept in a grove of chaste trees (the subject for the next chapter). The flogging’s purpose was purification of the Artemis altar in the tree grove by sacrificial blood. The ritual (known as the diamastigōis) was to keep the statue upright (Greek orthia meaning “upright”), 5 but whatever purposes the ritual began, it had different meanings as time progressed into the historic period. Inasmuch as Artemis was associated with childbirth and the perpetual virgin, I suspect that in time there was a perceived divine wish that young males should appreciate the pain of pregnancies and childbearing. As all too frequently happens, in time the religious purpose faded; by the third century CE a small amphitheater was built for the comfort of those who wanted to wit-ness the sadistic ritual where boys met a cruel death by savage blows.6 In Athens young girls (prepubescent and earlier adolescent) were sent to Artemis’s shrine at Brauron, where they learned how to be spouses and working women in their society. Doubtlessly they learned about why the goddess plant would be important in their lives.7 Beyond Athens, many cults for Artemis existed for women in transition, such as puberty, sexuality, birth, motherhood, and death.8This chapter explores plants of the artemisia family in classical and, to some extent, Western medieval medicine for its total medicinal qualities that led to its name from the goddess Artemis. Chinese and Vedic (Indian) medicine will also be included. The herb was called the “mother herb”; like mothers, most of its var-ious roles benefited human societies. In honesty, there were the hallucinatory and narcotic roles that harmed people. Several or more species in the artemisia fam-ily provided special comfort and assistance to women, ranging from abortion to helpful relief in safe childbirth. To men and women alike, its medicinal qualities range from a hallucinatory and narcotic effect to the treatment of intestinal worms, wounds, and fever—and this list will be expanded. From history’s beginning to the present, artemisia’s story is astonishing because it comforted and saved multitudes of women. To men and women alike, artemisia plants provided medical assistance in a variety of ways and, even now in the twenty-first century the plant saves the lives of hundreds of thousands annually from the wretched disease of malaria. Also, in fairness, its story will conclude this chapter with some adverse qualities. The plant is so hardy that the United States Department of Agriculture lists artemisia 9780230610644ts06.indd 809780230610644ts06.indd 8012/7/2009 3:11:27 PM12/7/2009 3:11:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"81Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”as “an obnoxious weed.”9 The plant is a miraculous drug in ancient Athens, but it is obnoxious to farmers in Alabama, or so goes its history. Its story is largely untold and unrecognized. Now in the twenty-first century, our attention to its qualities is returning in a vital way. Artemisia’s modern use focuses on its malarial cure; its use in gynecology and obstetrics accounted for its greatest impact, although now largely forgotten. Between antiquity and today, artemisia had adverse qualities as a narcotic-like drug, which surely did as much harm as good.Artemisia plantsApproximately four hundred species of the broadly distributed genus Artemisia are identified and more than sixty are used in traditional medicine, but the active chemicals are largely unexplored.10 Before modern botanical nomenclature, people identified plants by common names. Certainly ancient people could not recognize or distinguish among all these species—nor generally did they need to do so. In this chapter we shall concentrate on those plants that we have thought were known, while, at the same time acknowledging that other, less prevalent species were sub-sumed under one name or another. In the classical period, three major names for artemisia species were used:1. absinthe (Latin: absinthium) for our Artemisia absinthium L. Under this name there were probably these species that may have been at times subsumed under the absinthe name:a. Absinthium Gallicum and/or a. marinum, Gallic or marine artemisia (A. maritima L./ A. Gallicum, Marc.)b. Absinthium pontica or Roman wormwood (A. pontica L.)c. Artemisia judaica L./ alt. A. herba-alba Assoc. or Jewish wormwood/ white wormwood2. southernwood (Latin: abrotanum) for our A. abrotanum L.3. mugwort (A. vulgaris L.)a. Artemisia leptophyllos or our field wormwood (A. campestris L.)b. Artemisia arborescens (L.) or forest mugwortQuite probably many ancient peoples did not distinguish southernwood from mug-wort; therefore in this chapter we shall not attempt in most references to inter-pret which plant the ancient recorder had in mind inasmuch as the chemistry and medicinal uses were much the same. In contrast, absinthe was stronger and had pronounced hallucinatory effects but, generally, the ancients referred correctly to it and separated it from their kinds of artemisia with descriptive adjectives, such as Gallic, Pontic, and Jewish. Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.) is today a member of the genus Artemisia, but the ancients considered it a different plant with differ-ent uses, often culinary; tarragon will not be included in this chapter. Also there is another species of artemisia (A. annua L.) with English common names of annual wormwood and Sweet Annie. This species is indigenous to Asia, especially Chinese and Southeast Asia areas, but it grows now in the Balkans, but we are uncertain whether it grew there in the classical period. Annual artemisia contains a compound 9780230610644ts06.indd 819780230610644ts06.indd 8112/7/2009 3:11:28 PM12/7/2009 3:11:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches82in higher concentrations that is highly effective for malaria treatments. We shall postpone into later in this chapter whether annual artemisia was available and used by ancient peoples in Mediterranean-European climates.Artemisia has distinctive characteristics, usually in a small bush, and its leaves are bitter; the range of habitats is virtually universal from deserts to the subarctic. Xenophon (d. 354 BCE), a Greek who visited Asia on a military expedition, said of Mesopotamia (he called it Arabia): “In this region the ground was an unbroken plain, as level as the sea and full of wormwood.”11 Xenophon used the word apsin-thon (usually Romanized as absinthium and Anglicized as absinthe), loosely trans-lated “wormwood,” the English generic for most plants in the species. It is called wormwood because it prevents insects in clothes chest, insects when rubbed on the body in oil, and worms in the intestines. Let us start with the biblical bitter species, white wormwood or Jewish wormwood.Jewish Wormwood and Artemisia Varieties in Ancient West AsiaThe Bible has numerous references to absinthe as a synonym for bitterness as, for example, Proverbs 5: 4: “but in the end she [i.e., a loose woman] is bitter as worm-wood (laanah), sharp as a two-edged sword.” Also, as a mind-altering alcoholic drink spoken of in Lamentations 3: 15 and 19: “He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood”; “Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall.” The biblical wormwood has been identified as Artemisia judaica L./ alt. A. herba-alba Assoc., or white wormwood.12 The Hebrew word laa-nah is designated by biblical scholars as white wormwood, but the Septuagint and Vulgate use the Greek absinthon, which is another species, one much more potent in mind-altering qualities. All species have anthelmintic qualities, that is to say, it removed tapeworms and other intestinal parasites—afflictions that the ancients had plentifully and painfully.13 These and related species were frequently given for a general term such as aids the stomach. Artemisia or wormwood is currently found effective for a number of digestive parasites, including trichinellosis.14 The biblical references (also Deut. 29:18; Job 30:4; Jeremiah 9: 15, 23:15; Hosea 10:4; Amos 5:7, 6:12; Revelation 8:10–11) to wormwood bear out what we know about the plant.15Artemisia is found in Assyrian prescriptions. The Assyrian word is šam sîhu, prob-ably A. judaica and/or A. absinthium L., is found in Assyrian prescriptions for the feet, swelling, bruises, eyes, ears, coughs, and possibly pleurisy, apparently all used as applications.16 The Assyrian prescriptions mirror those in the ancient Egyptian medical documents. The famous Ebers Papyrus (Recipe 56) lists the plants that expelled worms in the belly: 5 ro (an Egyptian measure; precise amount unknown) leaves of pondweed, 5 ro of wormwood, mixed and eaten. There is another for the same purpose: Recipe 64: melilot 1; wormwood 1; fermented plant juice 1: mixed and eaten. The Ebers Papyrus has at least four recipes using wormwood for internal parasites (“worms”).17 Similarly, there is the Assyrian recipe (cf. Ebers Recipe 138): for pain of demonic origin in the anus, wormwood 1/8th, juniper berries 1/16th, honey 1/32nd, sweet beer 10 ro; it is strained and drunk for four days.18 The Ebers Papyrus recipes prescribed wormwood for general health, for the mouth, in various 9780230610644ts06.indd 829780230610644ts06.indd 8212/7/2009 3:11:28 PM12/7/2009 3:11:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"83Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”applications for wounds and abrasions, digestive problems, headaches, stopping bleeding (hemostatic), for toothpaste (“abrasive powder”), for “stopping the harden-ing in the limbs” (probably arthritis?), and for several nontranslatable diseases.19For each of the ancient Assyrian and Egyptian medicinal applications for arte-misia, there is adequate substantiation for its actions, possibly excepting toothpaste and the presumed arthritis remedy. Modern science studies are well documented and verify virtually all of the artemisia species’ anthelmintic actions (against intesti-nal parasites),20 with special attention paid by veterinary physicians because of arte-misia’s relative inexpensiveness.21 As an application for the feet, swellings, bruises, and hemorrhoids (assuming that is “pain in the ass”?), compounds in most artemi-sia species are anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticoagulant, and hemo-static.22 The medicinal actions of southernwood (Latin: abrotanum; A. abrotanum L.) are mostly attributed to the choleretic activity of coumarin compounds found in this species: isofraxidin, scopoletin, and umbelliforone.23 The plant’s use for bronchial conditions is attributed to flavonol compounds found in this (and other) species: casticin, centaureidin, and quercentin derivatives, which have spasmolytic activity.24Why the Mother Herb?There are no surviving and translated records—thousands of tablets are untranslated— from ancient west Asia or Egypt where women were using artemisia plants specifically for female health. We know that the plant was named after the goddess and said to be the mother herb. Graeco-Roman records, however, make a strong case for why the goddess’ plant was called the mother herb. Dioscorides, the herbalist of the first century CE, fails to tell us about a connection with Artemis; he said that it was used by the priests of Isis, the major Egyptian goddess: “use it instead of olive branches.”25 I surmise that the reference was intended as ritual use. Dioscorides visited Egypt and wrote that wormwood (apsinthoun) grew abundantly at Taposiris (modern Abusir near Alexandria) where the tomb of Osiris, Isis’ brother was. The Ebers Papyrus connects wormwood with Isis in a prescription that Isis gave to Ra to cure a headache.26 Artemisia plants, most especially A. absinthium L., were given for headaches for millennia and, as many people will attest, it also gave headaches or worse, if taken to excess.Most classical medical writers do not state explicitly why the herb is special to women and to Artemis. Pliny said that its qualities were “specific to women.”27 Pseudo-Apuleius’ herbal, written in Latin in late Roman-Christian period about the fifth century, under “Herba Artemisia Leptofillos [probably A. campestris L.]: Diana [Roman equivalent for Artemis] is said to have found three types of artemi-sia, the virtues of which, she gave to Chiron the Centaur who initially instituted their medical uses. For this reason the herb derives from Diana.”28 A ninth- century manuscript of this text has an illumination that shows Chiron holding three types of artemisia (see book cover). Chiron was the centaur who was the master of the heal-ing arts but, alas, he could not cure himself. A late Roman writer of the fifth century said that the Greeks called the artemisia plant Chylon, presumably a corruption of Chiron.299780230610644ts06.indd 839780230610644ts06.indd 8312/7/2009 3:11:29 PM12/7/2009 3:11:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches84Artemisia’s medicinal effects were what made the artemisia plants special to women. Dioscorides enumerated some of these qualities in wormwood while dis-cussing A. campestris L. and A. arborescens L.:When boiled, they (two types) are suitable to use in sitz baths for drawing the men-strual period, afterbirths, embryos/fetuses, for uterine closing and uterine inflamma-tion, for breaking stones, and for retention of urine. The herb, when liberally plastered against the lower part of the abdomen, sets the menstrual period in motion. Its juice, triturated with myrrh and applied, draws from the uterus as many things as the sitz bath; the foliage is also given to drink in the amount of three drachmai [a measure] to draw out the same.30In separate chapters Dioscorides attributes the same menstrual problem solutions to southernwood (A. abrotanon L.) and absinthe (A. absinthium L.). Artemisia’s anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticoagulant, and hemostatic qualities doubtlessly contribute to its use for menstrual problems as the ancients attested. Today medicine containing or made exclusively of artemisia species are sold for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), as one can readily see by Googling artemisia and PMS.31 One Web site simply describes artemisia as “A mildly tonic, gently detoxify-ing herb”32; another Web site proprietor sells white artemisia (same species as in the Bible?) as a “female cycle regulator.”33 Inexplicably, a leading, new, and otherwise good guide to healing herbs for women omits artemisia species from the list of herbs helpful to women.34 Once, Artemis’s herbs were women’s paths to good health.Women whose menstrual period was delayed, however, took the plant even when or, sometimes, especially when they perceived that pregnancy might be the reason for the cycle disruption. The plant in its various species was given from antiquity to the modern period to cause an abortion.35 Studies show that it has 100 percent effectiveness in terminating pregnancies in rats, and another study shows that arte-misia interferes with spermatogenesis. Generally a symbiosis exists between anthel-mintic and abortifacient qualities: in other words, a drug that drives out intestinal parasites often terminates early pregnancies. The modern electronic guide to drugs, DrugDigest, specifies as the first precaution for artemisia-derived drugs: “Pregnant women should not take or use wormwood due to the risk of miscarriage. In animal studies, wormwood caused the muscles of the uterus to tighten, which could result in a miscarriage.”36 If we judge by the infrequency of recordings in medical and lit-erary sources, artemisia was not a primary abortifacient; its major use: was for more ordinary use to help with PMS and obstetrical purposes. The sitz bath indicates rational use of its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial qualities.Soranus on Artemisia for WomenSoranus, the major authority on gynecology, prescribed absinthe in metasyncritic treatments (restoration of the pores and interstices of the body to a normal state), and for chronic menstrual problems (amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea).37 A woman intent on aborting her fetus should have sitz baths two or three days in which there is wormwood (A. abrotanum L.; or A. vulgaris L) and absinthe, with the latter 9780230610644ts06.indd 849780230610644ts06.indd 8412/7/2009 3:11:29 PM12/7/2009 3:11:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"85Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”apparently being the stronger because it was used when milder wormwood recipes failed.38 Soranus said that some physicians recommended sweet Cretan wine with southernwood (abrotanum) or absinthe to treat pica (a perversion of appetite asso-ciated with pregnancy) but he opposed the procedure because absinthe, at least, incurred a danger of a miscarriage.39 Soranus did not exclude southernwood arte-misia, however, from pica therapy. Inasmuch, as (we shall see below) absinthe has a higher concentration of a toxic compound, Soranus was very discerning.Hippocratic Writings and ArtemisiaSoranus disagreed with the Hippocratic writers who recommended southernwood to accelerate a slow labor; in On Women’s Diseases, a surviving work ascribed to Hippocrates, there are prescriptions to accelerate birth, but neither southernwood nor another artemisia species is among the ingredients.40 The same Hippocratic treatise, however, prescribed absinthe as a pessary and as a fumigant for difficult births (breech), a remedy to which modern science does not presently attest.41 In the Hippocratic work On Female Sterility, absinthe was used as a fumigant and/or appli-cation for a woman’s womb that resisted conception, to be administered for periods as long as four months.42 In other Hippocratic works, the medical writers prescribed southernwood (abrototon) with pepper and honey in a lozenge for pneumonia and for pain resulting from pleurisy. Also, non-gender-specific applications were absinthe as a topical for tetanus and absinthe in a warm bath for chronic, painful jaundice.43Some Other Classical Medical Writers on ArtemisiaGalen was the great physician working primarily in the second half of the second century of our era who used southernwood and absinthe in much the same way as in earlier medical accounts: internal parasites, stomach, fevers, expels internal poi-sons through diuretic action, imparts bitterness in foods for “all hardnesses,” and as an antidote against mushroom poisoning (both southernwood and absinthe).44 He noted that the drugs from either plant are potentially dangerous and, even more so, is absinthe. The latter, he said, caused one to fall into a coma. (A later Latin version translated the Greek to mean “highly hallucinatory.”45) Shortly we shall examine absinthe’s hallucinatory/coma effects, but, for now to summarize, Galen did not have specific gynecological uses.Celsus employed both southernwood and absinthe widely in medical prescrip-tions: southernwood for cleaning wounds and the body in general and for gout, absinthe for the stomach in general and for those filled with phlegm, increasing urine flow, jaundice, neck (when breathing is hindered), inflammations (in drink on empty stomach), liver disease, for spleen and intestines, for throat as a tonic, difficulty with micturition, intestinal worms, and as an external plaster for disease of viscera.46 Curiously, Celsus often said to take absinthe on an empty stomach but modern people report that it is bitter and distasteful. As the old saying goes, if it tastes that bad, it must be a good medicine. Importantly for the section that follows on malaria, Celsus recommended southernwood in a pill for chronic diseases that supervenes on quartan fever, the latter being a form of malaria.479780230610644ts06.indd 859780230610644ts06.indd 8512/7/2009 3:11:29 PM12/7/2009 3:11:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches86Although not a physician, Pliny, always the dilettante, dropped considerable information about the use of artemisia. He employed two words, abrotanum (south-ernwood) and absinthium (absinthe) and named what we would call subspecies, such as Pontic wormwood (Absinthium pontica L.). Pontic wormwood, he said, provided a medicinal wine if one mixed one pound of wormwood with five gallons of wine. Southernwood was given for kidney problems, strangury (a urinary affliction), jaundice, emmenagogue (i.e., an abortifacient), “good for the uterus,” the bowels and cleaning the ears, thus fairly well repeating previous accounts.48 Perhaps the unique use was as an application to prevent chafing of the skin between the thighs. Absinthe keeps away caterpillars, abates a toothache, and is good for the liver, kid-neys, dropsy, and excessive bile.49 Yet, given all of these applications, Pliny said that artemisia plants were specifically for women’s uses.50Other medical writers used artemisia for breathing problems, hemorrhoids, worms, and, in wine, as an antidote for poisons.51 Again, the applications exclusively for women were not prominent in most classical authorities, but why? The writers were mostly males, and women’s problems were more the province of midwives. Dioscorides, Soranus, and Hippocratic writer of the treatise On women’s diseases were the principal exceptions.Artemisia’s Use in Medieval and Early Modern PeriodsThroughout the medieval period, both absinthe and southernwood provided prized drugs for essentially the same remedies as were in the classical sources. Remedies for gynecological problems were prominent in most works; usually the expression was “provocat/ stimulates” menstruation. Within the lexical range of this expres-sion was abortion. Also, subtly, these herbs were said to “remove a dead fetus,” a common circumlocution for abortion. Macer wrote a very popular herbal in Latin verse (eleventh century). His number one herb was “artemisia” (by which he meant absinthe), followed by “abrotanum” or southernwood. Absinthe was “the mother herb/ herbarum matrum.” For both plants, his verses emphasized applications for women. The “artemisia” plant, Macer wrote, was named after the Greek goddess Artemis.52 Macer’s identity is not known but I believe that Macer’s real name was Marbode, Bishop of Rennes, who wrote a similar verse on stones and minerals. Macer or Marbode purposefully invoked a pagan goddesses’ name in an endearing way, a subject that earlier Christian sources avoided.Al-Kindī (d. ca. 870), writing in Arabic, extolled southernwood’s uses for the mouth (toothpaste, remove decay, halitosis, and general prophylactic),53 and Maimonides, the great Jewish physician, repeated Dioscorides’s recommendation for southernwood’s astringent qualities but warned that it was bad for the stomach.54 Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037; Avicenna, in Latin), the great Muslim physician, said that there are many kinds of artemisia plants, each with numerous mostly shared, medicinal virtues. Among them were stimulation of appetites, drunk before wine to prevent inebriation, various ophthalmologic uses, cures or prevents intestinal worms, helps digestion, and good for a number of special, female needs, such as stimulation and regulator of menstruation, and as a killer of harmful insects.55 In Indian Vedic med-icine, several artemisia plants (mugwort and absinthe among them) were similarly 9780230610644ts06.indd 869780230610644ts06.indd 8612/7/2009 3:11:30 PM12/7/2009 3:11:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"87Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”employed for intestinal parasites and as a tonic.56 There are a number of Vedic works, however, where the drugs’ identifications are uncertain in modern scientific nomenclature.57Constantine the African (d. 1085) adapted a work in Arabic to his free Latin translation where he repeated many of the same things about absinthe as Ibn Sīnā; Constantine placed more emphasis on its gynecological applications, and he repeated the claim that absinthe prevented inebriation from alcohol. “Magister Salernus,” an anonymous Latin source from Salerno, added that absinthe could be mixed with honey and placed in the vulva for stimulating menstruation.58 In naming the rem-edies provided by artemisia plants, medieval medical works usually included the same as those in the classical works but perhaps with more attention given to their alleged properties to detoxify ingested poisons. A Salernitan work called Tabula says that absinthe “comforts the head and clarifies vision.”59Writing in Latin principally for the women in her convent, Hildegard of Bingen (d. 1179) called the plant Wermuda, the German word for absinthe and/or worm-wood; Hildegard said that Wermuda was a principal women’s remedy for all ill-nesses (est principalis magistra ad omnes languores). She related a long list of remedies that are much the same as those in classical sources. Hildegard received much of her information orally from her culture, not through written works; it is a reason-able conclusion that her information about absinthe came from general practices in medieval Germany rather than being derived from written sources. She added, however, that absinthe is given for mental depression (melancholia), a condition from which she suffered. She noted, however, that absinthe can be deadly.60Platearius (d. ca.1161), the presumed author of an herbal called Circa instans, des-ignated medical remedies for absinthe primarily for women. He began by asserting that absinthe acted against sterility that arose from excessive humidity (a humoral designation). The plant, he claimed, helped the complexion of women; a decoction of it with wine and laurel leaves was good placed on the vulva and also, in a differ-ent formula, could act in a suppository. Along with the usual remedies, Platearius recommended absinthe for thenesmon, a recent word for some kind of intestinal disorder.61By the late medieval period, the plant (absinthe, wormwood, and southernwood) was given for chest congestion, coughs, lung diseases, and body pains, for much the same reasons as in earlier medicine, except it was usually made into syrup with other ingredients.62 Nicholas Culpeper’s Pharmacopoeia Londinensi (1649) said that south-ernwood combated poison, killed worms and insects—much the same as in classical sources—but added “provokes Lust.” Similarly to absinthe, Culpeper added to the list of remedies: “cleans sight.”63 Culpeper was writing to combat the monopoly that apothecaries were increasingly making compound medicines by proprietary secret formulas. His counter-current movement demonstrates the continued impor-tance of artemisia plants to which his age added new uses. The movement toward polypharmacy (using many simple medicines in complex formulae) was partly the consequence of the apothecary guilds developing secret proprietary mixtures to boost their economic interests as purveyors of drugs rather than the family herb gardens. He added treatments using artemisia plants, such as one for epileptic epi-sodes. Hager’s famous guide to drugs in 1874 said that artemisia plants were used 9780230610644ts06.indd 879780230610644ts06.indd 8712/7/2009 3:11:30 PM12/7/2009 3:11:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches88for opening pores (diaphoreticum), against epileptic episodes, and as a promoter of memory.64 Astoundingly (to me, at least) the conventional wisdom among the med-ical authorities of the ancient and medieval periods, absinthe and other wormwoods prevented inebriation and epileptical episodes, whereas (as we shall see below) in the nineteenth century these same plants were put in alcohol to enhance the ini-tial psychological uplifting. When a person was drunk from the mixture (absinthe and distilled alcohol), they were said to have epileptic fits. Southernwood was used in obstetrics as well as the usual remedies such as anthelmintic and antispasmodic applications.65 Especially using absinthe, a new means of drug delivery was devel-oped in the late medieval period, namely distillation and combining with alcohol in various forms. A discussion about alcohol and absinthe will conclude this chapter.The Christianized Plant of the Goddess in Ritual and ReligionHildegard did not associate artemisia plants with the goddess Artemis, as Christianization of the culture had filtered out that knowledge except for a few scholars. Nevertheless, a name for mugwort (German: Beyfuss) was named after St. John and called St. Johannsgürte that means “St. John’s girdle.” Similarly in medi-eval French the plant was called “St. Jean.” On St. John’s day, the common folk tied bands of artemisia plants about their waist, hence “girdle.” Wearing this girdle, they performed undisclosed rituals and spells, made rhymes, and ended their rituals by flinging the girdle into a fire. The ritual removed their hardships.66 (Speculatively the girdle may have covered the genitals more than the waist.) A somewhat similar ritual was celebrated in Anglo-Saxon England, where the plant’s name was mucgwyrt (“mugwort”). Walafrid Strabo (d. 849) composed a poem on the herbs in his monas-tic garden and spoke of absinthe’s “marvelous” actions when worn as a garland (see poem below) for headaches. It seems likely that he was referring to an earlier version of the ritualized use of wearing wormwood girdles.A young woman in Scotland was near death with pneumonia when a barmaid said to her providers a little verse that was repeated:Wad ye let the bonnie may die I’ your hand,And the mugwort flowering in the land!67A Slavic term for the plant is bozhye drutze, meaning “God’s little tree.”68 And in the Germanic Gothic of Sweden when one administers mugwort, called grensink, one should invoke the “Son Jesus Christ” or “the Father and the Son.”69 If one carries a twig of vitex (the plant which is the subject of chapter five) or artemisia, one’s thighs will not chafe.70 In a perversion of Pliny’s recipe for artemisia preventing chafing of the thighs when applied in a salve, this medieval procedure of merely carrying it for this purpose is more magic than medicine. Whereas medieval culture mixed magic or superstition with medical practices (as did classical medicine in folk practices), artemisia plants were more connected to religion and ritual than was practically any other herb, doubtlessly as a vague memory that it is Artemis’s herb. Artemisia plants were well known throughout the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance.

Ancient peoples used a drug to treat malaria; we are just return-ing to it and call it a wonder drug. The World Health Organization for Global Fund, the primary financial agency for combating malaria, reported that between 2006 and 2007 malaria’s mortality was cut significantly. Rwanda, for example, had more than a 50 percent reduction from almost 80,000 deaths in 2006 to somewhat fewer than 40,000 in one year.72 Children are highly vulnerable to the parasitic infection; a child dies of malaria every thirty seconds.73 The drive to combat malaria had two fronts, the combinations of which enabled the dramatic global outcome: distribution of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and the use of a newly rediscovered herbal medicine, artemisinin, from at least some species of the artemisia genus. Artemisia has received considerable attention in recent years for its effectiveness in combat-ing malaria, most especially in children but including people in all age groups. “If we can scale up like this [with mosquito nets and artemisinin] we should be able to eliminate malaria as a major public health threat in many countries,” stated Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, Director of the WHO agency. Forty percent of the world’s population is at risk for malarial infection, thus an achievable goal of elimination would, indeed, be great news. The New York Times article noted that artemisinin was a Chinese medicine from wormwood, one of the Artemisia species. Virtually unreported is the fact that the ancient Greeks used the plant as an insecticide against mosquitoes; artemisia was employed to reduce fever, as in malaria, and mosquito nets were also used. Why does only ancient Chinese herbal medicine receive the historical credit? As with the pomegranate and mandrake, the answer is not simple but, when the story is unraveled, the plant of Artemis demonstrates a largely hidden but important influence in history, one that only now we can appreciate.Malaria in AntiquityMalaria is a composite of various diseases caused by different parasitic protozoa carried by certain mosquito species and transmitted through a bite. Four species of the genus Plasmodium infect humans with malaria, with only three endemic in the ancient Mediterranean area: P. malariae (diagnosed and called quartan fever in the classical medical writings because of periodicity of the fever every third day); P. falciparum (called tertian fever with intense fever on the second day of infection and recurring every other day).74 Complaints are fever, headache, jaundice, anemia, aches and pain, and diarrhea.75 Because of the periodization and similar symptoms 9780230610644ts06.indd 899780230610644ts06.indd 8912/7/2009 3:11:31 PM12/7/2009 3:11:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches90with other diseases in their initial stages, a missed or delayed diagnosis easily ensues. The spleen and liver enlarge, an occurrence observed by classical physicians (as we shall see below). Today, it is called malignant tertian fever. A third agent is P. vivax that the ancients probably described also as quartan fever. The term quotidian (from Latin for daily because it spikes every twenty-four hours) is usually applied to P. vivax and P. falciparum malariae. P. vivax causes a less dangerous and debilitating disease, whereas P. falciparum is devastating to the patient and potentially fatal. Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant parasite. Today, P. falciparum causes more than 120 million clinical cases and more than 1 million deaths occur in the world each year, approximately 80 percent being children less than 5 years of age.76 One type of ter-tian fever (P. vivax) is, as we saw in chapter three, sometimes called benign malaria (or benign tertian) but only relative to P. falciparum infection, because its effects are less serious. Celsus, the Roman author, spoke of two types of tertian fever, one starting and ending just like quartan fever, disappearing for one day and return-ing on the third, hence tertian. The other type of tertian fever is called “malignant malaria”; Celsus and the author of the Hippocratic work, Epidemics, called it “semi-tertian,” the type of malaria today we attribute to P. falciparum. Epidemics called the first type “the least fatal and least difficult of all” and the other as “more fatal than any other.”77 Celsus said it was “far more pernicious.”78 To summarize, P. malariae causes fevers that recur at approximately three-day intervals (hence, quartan fever), longer than the two-day (tertian) intervals of the other malarial parasites caused by P. falciparum and P. vivax.79 The terminology used by the ancients persisted until the nineteenth century. The point is that the ancients could diagnose malaria. One of the earliest records of its devastation comes not in text but on a coin from the Greek city-state of Selinus.Selinus’ CoinsSelinus was a colony in Sicily of the Greek city of Megara in the mid-seventh cen-tury BCE. Named after the Greek word for celery (presumably because its wild kind grew well in the region), the city Selinus (or Selinos) had a measure of prosperity in the fifth century BCE, as witnessed today by its surviving Doric temple. Something bad befell Selinus’ citizens, sapping the energy of many survivors: an epidemic of malaria. The philosopher Empedocles (d. ca. 430 BCE), famous for his theory of the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water), supposedly saved the city, according to his ancient biographer: “Since a plague afflicted the people of Selinus because of the evil smell of the adjacent river, causing death and making pregnant women miscarry, Empedocles had the idea of bringing two rivers there at his own expense. By mixing the waters he sweetened them.”80 The major river was named Hypsas (modern Belice River) and the other river, Mazarus. As we saw, the Hippocratic Airs, Waters, and Places explained the syndrome of symptoms associated with malaria as caused by “bad air/ mal aere,” although that term itself was not used until the fif-teenth century. Those cities situated in “marshy, standing and stagnant [water] must in summer be hot, thick, and stinking, because there is no outflow . . . The malady is endemic both in summer and in winter.” Such conditions the Hippocratic writer associated with fevers and, among the symptoms, “large, stiff spleens.”819780230610644ts06.indd 909780230610644ts06.indd 9012/7/2009 3:11:32 PM12/7/2009 3:11:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"91Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”On or about 467 BCE Selinus issued a beautiful didrachm coin to commemo-rate the salvation of the city through the draining of the marshes, attributed to Empedocles (see figure.4.1). With Selinus’ name written on its face, the coin has Artemis driving a chariot; Apollo, the god associated with healing and to whom the Hippocratic Oath was taken, stands behind her, shooting an arrow. According to I. A. McGregor, Apollo discharged “arrows to slay the pestilence, while Artemis represents the women of the city who suffered so severely from the fever.”82 The depiction is interpreted as being Selinus’ success in counteracting malaria by draining the marshes. Artemis’s presence has been interpreted as representing Selinus’ women. There is, I submit, a better reason: her herb was employed to treat malaria. The coin’s artistry and its connection with medicine caused the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (University of London) to adopt the image for its seal. The obverse of this same coin is no less dramatically and well depicted, but its interpretation varies (see figure 4.2). The inscription is clear and to HYPHAS (in Greek letters), the Selinus river god offering pinakion (plate) as a votive offering on the altar while in the foreground stands a rooster associated with chthonic (or earth) deities. The representative of Hyphas, an athletic youth, holds a sprig of celery (the city symbol) but it could easily be artemisia. The bull in the background was for sacrifice. Above the bull is a palm sprig. All of these representations are seen as a sacred celebration of the salvation of the city from malaria.83 Some scholars suggest that the youth also represented Empedocles. Another issue (dated 460–440 BCE) is similarly arranged, but the altar has a snake coiled around it, a medical symbol of Aesculapius (instead of the cock on the altar’s top) and, in place of the bull, there is a marsh bird, indicating the con-nection between the dreaded disease and the pestilential waters from which it came.

The ancient Chinese had made that discovery.Artemisinin, Artemisia annua L., and Malaria in ChinaThe Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine or Neijing is attributed to the Emperor Huang Di (“TheYellow Emperor”), who ruled about 2700 BCE. Malaria is described in considerable detail—indeed, more detail than our empirical observation would merit because its effect on each organ or body section is described: the account begins with the foot and included is the spleen. For example, in the text this question is raised about a malarial condition: “Can you tell me about the malaria condition that flares up every two days or on some regular basis?” Answer: “This type of skipping days between flare-ups occurs because the pathogen and wei qui [roughly ‘energy’] engage at fenfu [an acupuncture site]; sometimes they meet, however, only every two days.”84 The English translation here employs the term “pathogen” that makes the text seem more modern than merited. Some twelve different “malaria conditions” are delineated. I shall not attempt to make them congruent with modern diagno-ses. Acupuncture was the primary therapeutic address for malaria, but there is the intriguing statement: “If the pulse is large, slow, and deficient, one should use herbs but not acupuncture.”85 There we have it and nothing more about the identification of the specific herbs.Liu An (d. 122 BCE) wrote a pharmaceutical guide in which he named An Lu Zi, a species of artemisia said by the translator to be Artemisia keiskeana Miq., as Figure 4.2 Obverse of Selinus coin.Source: Courtesy of British Museum.9780230610644ts06.indd 929780230610644ts06.indd 9212/7/2009 3:11:33 PM12/7/2009 3:11:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"93Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”treating blood stasis, abdominal distention, “persisting heat,” and pain, but used frequently it makes the “body light,” prolongs life, and prevents senility.86 I only wish that I could confirm these attributes. Translators and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine have not associated “persisting heat” with malaria or even fever, and neither shall I. The earliest confirmed use of artemisia for malaria came approx-imately 300 years later.Qinghao, a species of artemisia, was prescribed in a treatise, named Fifty Two Remedies, which was found in the Mawangdui Tomb (dating second century BCE). Qinghao appeared in a prescription as a fumigant for hemorrhoids, and the text says, “The Jing name of qinghao (wormwood) is qui.”87 Ge Hong, who lived in the East Yin Dynasty and wrote in 340 CE, said that qinghao was good for malaria, if, as probably is reasonably correct, “intermittent fever” is equated with malaria. He wrote: “Another recipe [for intermittent fever]: qinghao, one branch, take two sheng [2 x 0.21 liters] of water soaking it, wring it out, take the juice, ingest it in its entirety.”88 Chinese scholars claim that qinghao was and still is a traditional remedy for malaria in their medical delivery.As part of Chairman Mao’s campaign against Western societies and values, he renewed emphasis on traditional Chinese medicine.89 As part of that policy, in an anonymously printed paper, the Chinese Medical Journal in December 1979 reported a compound found in qinghao that subsequently is called artemisinin from Artemisia annua L.90 As best I can tell, the process went like this: artemisinin comes from Artemisia annua, not readily found in other artemisia species, and, since traditional Chinese medicine employed artemisia (qinghao) for malaria, Ge Hong and other historical medical practitioners must have used this species for malarial treatments. That said a later Chinese medical authority, Shen Gua (1031–1095), said that there were two kinds of qinghao and a third kind, identified by modern translators as Artemisia apiacea L., produces the most effective means of treating malaria.91Modern Science ReportsIn the 1960s, because of its traditional use, Chinese researchers tested qinghao as a malarial treatment, but these series of tests failed to produce positive results. A rea-son was likely that artemisinin is not soluble in water or ether. Chemically artemisi-nin (also called in Chinese qinghaosu) is a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide.92 The mechanism of action shows that “artemisinin and its derivatives” [emphasis supplied] are “toxic to malaria parasites at nanomolar concentrations,”93 or restated: artemisi-nin has rapid schizonticidal action—it kills the little parasites and it does so for both P. falciparum and P. vivax-type malarias.94 Whereas the precise pathways are unknown at this time the indications are that the parasites are attracted to the toxin taken up by the bloodstream. Synthesis of the compound from the plant is tricky and its manufacture from the plant is expensive. Because of the dramatic results in treating malaria, research concentrates on economical synthesis procedures, includ-ing synthetic manufacture. Promising at present is production of artemisinic acid in engineered yeast.95 Since artemisinin is not water-soluble— the method given by Ge Hong—, the virtual certainty is that the ancient use of the antimalarial drug from artemisia was a crude extract and, further deduced, the crude plant drug has 9780230610644ts06.indd 939780230610644ts06.indd 9312/7/2009 3:11:33 PM12/7/2009 3:11:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches94positive effectiveness to treat malaria. Because Artemisia annua L. is a prominently-found species in China, universally the credit for its malarial effectiveness is given to the Chinese. Also, keep in mind that Fifty-two Remedies (the earliest recorded use of artemisia in Chinese medical literature) gave two kinds of artemisia, one being qinghao and the other qui. Also, remember that the modern chemical study show-ing artemisinin and other derivatives’ effectiveness in combating malaria. In other words, the various compounds in various species of artemisia may act symbiotically to produce bioactivity in malarial therapy.Questions AskedA generalization in plant chemistry is that plants related in the same genus have similar chemistries, although variations occur in different species and even within the same species depending upon morphological sites, methods of extraction, and soil and climatic conditions. Major questions need investigation: (1) Do other spe-cies of artemisia possess antimalarial properties? (2) Were the ancient Greeks (such as those in fifth century BCE Selinus) and other Western premodern peoples using A. annua, A. apiacea, and A. lanceolata species or other species to combat malaria? (3) Did these premodern people use a variety of artemisia species in different ways to prevent mosquito bites and malarial infection?Delaying a discussion of the various species of artemisia, we find that the imme-diate question becomes whether the crude drug in a water solution could have posi-tive results in treating malaria. Fourteen healthy male volunteers took one liter of tea made from nine grams of Artemisia annua leaves; this is approximately the amount that a traditional herbalist would give for a severe disease. The volunteers’ blood samples in laboratory analysis found 94.5 milligrams of artemisinin absorbed. This is 19 percent of the recommended daily dosage of the purified artemisinin.96 The chemists concluded that the “the possibility existed that bioavailability may be higher from the tea preparation.”97 Ge Hong used the Chinese verb (jiao) translated as “wring out”; Elizabeth Hsu proposes that the technical process conveyed by the verb “may have produced an emulsion conductive to the extraction of artemisinin.”98Around four hundred species of the broadly distributed Artemisia genus are iden-tified and more than sixty are used in traditional medicine, but the active chemi-cals are largely unexplored.99 According to current medicinal chemistry research, artemisinin is found only in A. annua, A. apiacea, and A. lanceolata species. Specifically negative results for finding artemisinin are reported by Chinese and American chemists who tested A. vulgaris, A. ludoviciana, A. pontica, A. arbuscula, and A. dracunculus.100 The educated supposition is that annual artemisia species have a greater presence of artemisinin, but even yields from A. annua are relatively low (0.01%–0.08%).101Artemisia Plants (Exclusive of Artemisinin) Have Antimalarial PropertiesRecently several laboratory trials show that a number of artemisia species demon-strate active bioactivity against Plasmodium falciparum-infected cases of malaria. 9780230610644ts06.indd 949780230610644ts06.indd 9412/7/2009 3:11:34 PM12/7/2009 3:11:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"95Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”Eight plants from Zimbabwe were tested in one study; Artemisia afra was found to be the most active as an antiplasmodial agent. When a number of flavones and sesquiterpene lactones, taken from A. afra, were isolated and tested and none had strong bioactivity but, when combined as in a crude drug, the plant extract “showed extraordinary antiplasmodial properties.” This led the investigators to conclude that “Obviously, the activity of A. afra is due to the complex mixture of substances which might act additively or even synergistically.”102 Artemisinin was not found in this plant. Another in vitro study of southernwood (A. abrotanum L.) showed “appreciable activity” as a potential antimalarial drug. These investigators found no artemisinin presence and, isolating specific compounds had less pronounced results. They concluded that “there are other antimalarial compounds present in these [crude extracts from southernwood] which have not been characterized.”103 The studies cited earlier were all in vitro experiments. A team of Indian research-ers at the Malaria Research Center in Delhi examined three species of artemisia (A. japonica, A. maritima, A. niligarica) by injecting extractions into mice infected with a malarial strain and conducted the study for sixty days. Varying amounts were given to different control groups. The group with the highest concentration had a high fatality rate, presumably because of toxicity. The moderate group had “specific antimalarial activity of different herbal extracts”—all artemisia plants.104 The con-trol group without any intervention had a greater mortality rate.Whereas the pharmaceutical community has expended considerable time and money growing A. annua and painfully extracting artemisinin, there is evidence that a number of artemisia plants are potentially effective as a drug against malaria. This conclusion can be reached from the scientific literature alone.105 Add to the scientific studies the fact that artemisia plants have historically been employed over centuries, millennia even, to combat malaria, and we have a reasonable conclusion that our ancestors may have known more than we do about some things about malarial—and without microscopes to see the protozoan. As we shall see the spe-cies most frequently used was absinthe (A. absinthium), which, according to my research, has not been tested in vitro or in animals. Strangely, we do not look where history tells us to look. Before we look at absinthe, we shall explore other ways in which artemisia plants have prevented malaria, namely mosquito nets and insecti-cide ointments.Artemisia, Fevers, and Malaria in Western MedicineAlready we have seen some classical medical writers (notably Celsus) and possibly premodern writers who recommended artemisia plants for fever, some giving it as a post-fever symptom for quartan fever, a form of malaria. The Hippocratic author of Diseases, discussing a raging fever that remits and reoccurs (a characteristic of malaria), wrote “give a medication, but only on the ninth day; for if you give one when the fever first begins, then after the patient has been cleaned out [with a laxative?] the fever will resume and another medication will be required.”106 The author’s precise meaning about periodic fevers that recur on the fifth, seventh, or ninth day is not sufficiently specific for modern equivalences. Seemingly the author thought his readers would know,107 but the context and description correspond to 9780230610644ts06.indd 959780230610644ts06.indd 9512/7/2009 3:11:35 PM12/7/2009 3:11:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches96malarial infections. The significant point is that the ancient physician was not treat-ing the fever itself, but allowed the body to seek its own defenses. Only after a period of disease progression was medication employed. The Hippocratic Diseases is a diagnostic work, not a therapeutic handbook, so little in the way of intervention is related. This reopens the question as to whether the ancients were aware of artemi-sia’s benefits in treating malaria pathologically and not just making the patient more comfortable with symptomatic therapies. Already we saw that at least some artemi-sia species act pharmacologically to attack the protozoa in evidence. Artemisia can be a cure rather than simply countering an unpleasant symptom; malaria is a very pernicious disease.Over a century ago W. H. S. Jones associated endemic malaria with the decline of ancient civilization and the “fall of Rome.” Others (such as Karl Beloch and P. A. Brunt) saw a more direct, but related cause: population decline—“crisis in manpower.”108 In our time approximately 100 million people are annually affected by malarial illness, with about 1 million deaths. The ancients’ numbers would have been less (fewer people) but proportionally, malarial conditions would have been sig-nificantly worse in antiquity than in today’s Mediterranean areas. Approximately in 1513 the Jesuits, accompanying the conquistadors in South America, reported back to Europe an exciting new drug for treating malarial fevers: a bark from a tree called the cinchona. The excitement about the drug from the bark led to a new name for it: “Jesuitenpulver” or Jesuit Powder.109 Quinine, the drug from cinchona, became the drug of choice for malaria therapy until the parasitic protozoa developed increas-ing immunity to it. Now we are returning to what earlier was a malaria treatment. Ancient and modern Chinese medicine provides considerable insight into malarial treatments.A Syriac herbal (ca. 600) included artemisia in a prescription that is “good for fever.”110 Similarly Walafrid Strabo said, “Its [wormwood’s] powers are famous, its effectiveness proven. It tames a raging fever.”111 Did early medicine employ the plant for the scourge of their day, one whose symptom was a raging fever, namely malaria, which sapped the energy of millions and led to the death of a number of those bit-ten by the inflicting mosquito? The hypothesis about malarial fevers is that the body raises its temperature to produce a less favorable environment for the protozoa infections. A febrifuge (something that lowers temperature) would, in that case, be counterproductive if all that medicine did was lower the temperature.Far more common in the early medical accounts was the prescription for var-ious artemisia plants to reduce a swollen spleen, a common malarial symptom. Al-Kindī (d. ca. 870) employed absinthe to reduce a swollen spleen.112 Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037; Avicenna in Latin), the great Muslim physician, recommended absinthe juice for a fever.113 Macer’s Latin herbal said that southernwood “cooled a fever.” Absinthe, on the other hand, comforts the stomach but was not given for a fever. Constantine the African’s (d. ca. 1085) Latin adaptation of an earlier work in Arabic failed to list absinthe for fevers, quartan, or tertian, but he said that it was good for “hard spleens,” another way of possibly pointing to the malarial symptom.114Known for the application of alchemy to pharmacy, Paracelsus (d. 1541) is said to have recommended absinthe for malaria therapy, thereby introducing into our 9780230610644ts06.indd 969780230610644ts06.indd 9612/7/2009 3:11:35 PM12/7/2009 3:11:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"97Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”study a complex but very important use of Artemis’ plant.115 Earlier in the same century, Pierre Baquillier’s commentary on Macer added that both southernwood and absinthe cooled fevers that were rigorous and “horrific fever/ horripilationes,”116 a description that points to malaria.117 Probably Baquillier thought that Macer meant malarial infections. So also did Nicholas Culpeper in 1653 state specifically of absinthe: It “cures quotidians and quartans.”118 Quartan fever was the mild form of malaria and quotidian fever may have been malaria. Also Culpeper said that absinthe “helps” obstructions of the spleen.119 Two pertinent points: one, in ref-erence to malaria, Culpeper used the word “cure,” a seldom-employed verb in any respectable herbal medicine guide and, two, he prescribed only absinthe species of wormwood and not other kinds (namely Roman or A. pontica, A. maritima, and A. serippium), which he also discussed.Summary: Artemisia as a Malaria Drug in the WestWe do not know and probably can never know whether classical and medie-val peoples had access to the species of artemisia that we are now using to extract artemisinin, today regarded as the drug of choice for malarial infections. We do not know whether crude drug extracts from absinthe, mugwort, and southernwood species-types had bioactivity for treating malaria. We do know, however, that some of these premodern peoples gave the artemisia plants for fevers, and, in some refer-ences (above), especially for one type of malaria they called quartan. As we noted in chapter three on the mandrake, ancient medicine did not appear to treat malaria at the first symptoms and fever per se. Indeed, Dioscorides said that absinthe wine is given to those with spleen disease, for the stomach, and edemata, provided that the patient does not run a fever.120 Ancient medicine (at least, so say the medical documents) did not treat a fever but administered drugs toward the end of epi-sodic periods. We know that ancient Mediterranean, medieval, and Chinese peoples employed artemisia plants to combat fever, thought to be malarial, and we have only recently returned to the practice of using artemisia for its pharmacological qualities. Dioscorides’s admonition not to give absinthe wine for those with fevers appears simply a realization that absinthe wine is so strong (as shall be discussed below) that it should not be given for diseases with fever. Also the ancients often reported that artemisia plants help a diseased spleen. An enlarged spleen is a symptom of malarial infection. As we saw above, Constantine the African and others prescribed absinthe for a “hard” spleen, thereby raising the possibility that later medical authorities were treating this malarial symptom. It seems certain that the ancients employed artemisia plants; they knew how to use mosquito nets and the plant’s juice as a mos-quito repellant. Artemisia was a once and future drug. Why, if they had an effective treatment, did the therapy seemingly wane? This question I have often repeated to myself, as when I studied ancient chemotherapy treatments for cancer, only to learn that they employed what we now take as drugs for cancers, but the practice of drug treatments waned beginning in the fourteenth century. Surgeons were successful in persuading their medical colleagues that cancer lesion removal was preferable to chemicals.121 As we shall see below, the French medical corps gave absinthe both as a prophylactic and as a cure for malaria when their armies and navies served in 9780230610644ts06.indd 979780230610644ts06.indd 9712/7/2009 3:11:35 PM12/7/2009 3:11:35 PM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches98malarial areas. There was continuity in Western medicine using artemisia plants for malarial treatments, from antiquity to the nineteenth century. We need to look backward until we look forward.Western medicine employed artemisia species to treat malaria. While we do not know whether the Westerner’s crude drug was made in part from the same species as A. annua L., the species from which artemisinin is currently taken, we can be reasonably sure that western physicians employed other species (southern-wood, mugwort, absinthe) for malaria. Whether this was a widespread practice or infrequently used, we are uncertain—an uncertainty that is true with most ancient drugs until we get to the later Middle Ages and have shop apothecary lists. The Chinese claim, however, that their ancestors first discovered malaria’s “cure” is no more solid than the Western case for the prized claim. In the final section on absinthe and alcohol, we shall see how the practice of using artemisia for malaria was common in Western Europe for those traveling or living in malarial areas. There is another claim that Western medicine can make in addressing malarial infections: the mosquito net.Mosquito NetsThe New York Times article quoted earlier said that we are making dramatic strides in malaria treatments by the combination of two approaches: artemisinin and mos-quito nets.122 One is as a drug for those afflicted, already discussed, but the second was something as simple as a mosquito net. In addition to artemisia as a therapeutic agent for malaria, the plant was used as a prophylactic to prevent mosquito bites. The ancients knew to take preventive measures. This is startling inasmuch as the western European and Mediterranean peoples did not suspect the mosquito as the causal agent for malaria, or so say modern scholars.123 I believe that the prepon-derance of evidence indicates that likely they did make the association. As already observed, these ancient peoples believed that malaria was a result of pestilential air connected with stagnant water. Federico Borca assembled the numerous refer-ences to the ancients’ attitudes and fears of marshes.124 Vivian Nutton, a leading medical historian of classical antiquity, after reviewing the numerous source refer-ences, concluded that “These comments on marshes and fens, on stagnant pools and slow-moving rivers, were standard among Greek and Roman doctors of all persua-sions, and, indeed, among all writers.”125 They sought to drain swamps and to live, insofar as possible, away from those areas (see the Selinus coins). Major problems occurred with environmental factors, as when the landscape changed near urban areas, thereby increasing “pestilential air” in a slow process. They also sought to pro-tect themselves from insect bites, knowing them to be unhealthy. Dioscorides, for example, said of absinthe: “It keeps mosquitoes away from the body when rubbed [on] with oil.”126 Fascinatingly, he added that absinthe also has other insecticide uses as pest inhibitors: kept in clothes chests, it keeps moths away; put into ink, it keeps mice from eating the papyrus.127 Numerous modern science laboratory and clinical studies verify that compounds found in absinthe, mugwort, and other arte-misia species have active insecticide activities, including fleas, mites, and mosqui-toes. 128 Gardeners know to plant wormwood in proximity to other herbs because 9780230610644ts06.indd 989780230610644ts06.indd 9812/7/2009 3:11:36 PM12/7/2009 3:11:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"99Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”it keeps insects away.129 Moreover, the plant’s juice is an active mosquito repellant. A compound found in greatest concentration in absinthe is called β-thujone, which is thought to be a major contributor to the plant’s insecticide and pesticide activi-ties.130 (Shortly, we shall see the activity of this compound when ingested by humans in causing a mind-altering experience.)Herodotus, the historian who gave us the graphic picture of prostitution in Babylon’s “love temples,” describes the use of mosquito nets in Egypt (which he visited):The Egyptians who live in the marshes use for the anointing of their bodies an oil made from the castor berry [from Ricinus communis L.], which is known among them by the name of kiki. . . . The contrivances which they use against gnats [mosquitoes] wherewith the country swarms, are the following. In the parts of Egypt above the marshes the inhabitants pass the night upon lofty towers, which are of great service, as the gnats [mosquitoes] are unable to fly to any height on account of the winds. In the marsh country, where there are no towers, each man possesses a net instead. By day it serves him to catch fish, while at night he spreads it over the bed in which he is to rest, and creeping in, goes to sleep underneath. The gnats [mosquitoes], which if he rolls himself up in his dress or in a piece of muslin, are sure to bite through the covering, do not so much as attempt to pass the net.131Greek kōkōpos and Latin culex are often translated as gnat (also in Latin meaning “midge”), but modern philologists say that the words specifically designate mosqui-toes.132 The use of mosquito nets must have been widespread throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. Horace, the Roman poet, when describing the Roman legion-ary camp with its standards glowing in the sun, mentions also the distracting view of mosquito nets (adspicit conopium) drying in the same scene.133 Thus far, we have established that the ancients used artemisia plants as insecticides and repellants and that they used mosquito nets to prevent bites. Paulus Silentiarius (sixth century CE) directly tied the mosquito net to Artemis (or, at least, the goddess of love) when he wrote: “I am hung round wealthy bridal beds and am the net, not of the huntress Artemis, but of the tender Queen of Paphos [i.e., Aphrodite]. I cover the sleeper with many a meshed-web, so that he in no way loses the life-giving breeze.”134 The poet, exercising his license, was pointing to Aphrodite as the protector against mos-quitoes, not to Artemis. The fact that he employed his substitution of Aphrodite is contrary to the conventional wisdom of his and earlier times was that Artemis was the protector. Paulus also wrote of mosquito nets that preserve people in contrast to the nets to catch fish or birds because these nets permit a safe nap, thereby sav-ing slaves from having to fan away flies (musca).135 Propertius metaphorically spoke of mosquito nets when speaking of Cleopatra’s ambitions on Rome to drape the Tarpeian rock, Rome’s symbolic equivalent of the American Statue of Liberty.136 Even though there is no explicit statement that ancient peoples put artemisia juice on the nets themselves, there is ample evidence that they used the juice as a repel-lant on their bodies. Besides, there is no need to put the juice on the net because, as explained by Agathias Scholasticus (a Greek poet of the late sixth century): “Not a single mosquito, however small, will manage to get through the fabric of my net.”137 An agricultural compilation, known as Geoponica (tenth century), lists some of the 9780230610644ts06.indd 999780230610644ts06.indd 9912/7/2009 3:11:36 PM12/7/2009 3:11:36 PM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches100plants used to keep away or kill insects, notably mosquitoes, as fumigants or sprin-kled around the house, rubbed on the body, or placed in bedding.138 Even with the scattered evidence presented by the surviving classical sources, this is a reasonable conclusion: ancient peoples used insecticides in a rational way (as defined by mod-ern science), and they were aware of the dangerous mosquito.How widespread was this knowledge? The preponderance of evidence indicates that knowledge about mosquito nets and use of insect repellants was common. As another indication of the connection between gods and herbs, a medieval practice associated with St. Luke was to make an application out of wormwood (absinthe) and other herbs burned to a powder over a slow fire: mixed with honey and vinegar, anoint on the body at bedtime, and say three times: “St. Luke, St. Luke, be kind to me, in dreams let me by true-love see.” The anointment was a poetic expression for preserving health from mosquito bites so that the person could live to dream of his beloved.139 In 1577 Thomas Tusser penned this verse:While Wormwood hath seed get a handful or twaineTo save against March, to make flea to refraine;Where chamber is sweeped and Wormwood is strowne,What saver is better (if physick be true)For places infected than Wormwood and Rue?It is a comfort for hart and the braine,And therefore to have it is not in vaine.140Tusser’s singling out the wormwood to prevent flea infestation could possibly be a precaution against the bubonic plague although this is a guess. Writing in England, Tusser did not fear the malarial mosquito, but he praised wormwood insecticide’s comforts. As a repellant, wormwood and other artemisia plants must have been inexpensive, considering their ubiquitous range and hardiness. The evidence indi-cates that not only did artemisia act as a repellant and insecticide, but also the plant saved people from both uncomfortable and deadly bites, as Tusser observed; in malarial areas, the herb preserved their health and life. The deadly qualities of diseases by insects from swamps were known and people used rational measures to save themselves from death or, in the least, from scratching.Without having explicitly made a link between malaria and the mosquito—at least, in the surviving documents—, ancient peoples took the same precautions as if they knew. While not explicitly stated, the connection was definitely implicit. Varro, a Roman writer, wrote: “Precautions must also be taken in the neighbour-hood of swamps both for the reasons given [i.e., ‘unwholesome (air) in the summer’], and because certain minute creatures, which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases.”141 And Columella came closer to a connection between malaria and the mosquito—those tiny things that Varro named—when he said cautioned against building near marshes: “Worst of all is swamp-water, which creeps along with slug-gish flow; and water which always remains stagnant in a swamp is laden with death [emphasis supplied]. But this same water, harmful though its nature is, is purified by the rains of the winter season and loses its virulence.”142 And, elsewhere, Columella 9780230610644ts06.indd 1009780230610644ts06.indd 10012/7/2009 3:11:37 PM12/7/2009 3:11:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"101Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”directly ties these insects to deadly diseases when writing about the desirability to locate buildings away from marshland:[A building near a marsh] throws off a baneful stench in hot weather and breeds insects armed with annoying stings, which attack us in dense swamps; then too it sends forth plagues of swimming and crawling things deprived of their winter moisture and infected with poison by the mud and decaying filth, from which are often contracted mysterious diseases whose causes are even beyond the understanding of physicians.143Clearly Columella connected the “decaying filth” of the swamps to the bites of insects, and these bites were potentially fatal. The swamps were “laden with death,” he said. The nature of ancient documentation does not permit us to know every aspect of daily living, but there is sufficient evidence that some ancients connected mosquito bites with a deadly disease. Certainly they (at least some of them) knew that it was not the pestilential, corrupted air per se, but an insect or tiny, invisible organism that caused the dreaded disease. The ancients were ravaged by malaria. Their ancient writers clearly stated that mosquito bites or stings were potentially fatal. Reason causes us to conclude that the ancients (at least some of them) knew that small things stinging or biting them caused malaria. For those reasons they attempted to avoid marshy swamp lands, to drain stagnant waters, to seek elevation where mosquito would not fly in higher altitudes, and to take measures to protect themselves by using artemisia oils (as repellants) and mosquito nets. All of these measures would come at some expense in time, money, and deliberate actions; all point to the conclusion that some of the ancients knew the causes of malaria and took rational steps to protect themselves.The mosquito net and the plant’s insecticide qualities enabled many people from having their vital energy and spirits drained by an infectious agent. The recent New York Times article (quoted earlier) trumpets the modern measures we are taking through the use of artemisinin and mosquito nets and the hundreds of thousands of lives these actions are saving. Even if the previous scholars were correct in thinking that the classical ancients did not connect the mosquito with malaria—and I think that they did—, the measures they took would have had the same beneficial results.Malaria and Decline of Classical CulturesThe final question, one that is bothersome but explainable, is why did malaria increase at times in the ancient and premodern worlds and wane at others? Environmental changes are part of the answer, as in Campagna when there were increases in swamplands attributable to a moister climate. The infecting species of mosquitoes do not tolerate a cold climate. The famous Pontine Marshes south of Rome inspired mammoth projects; beginning with Julius Caesar, then Anthony and Augustus, governments undertook to drain the swamps, but total success was not achieved until Mussolini.144 Modern visitors to Italy will want to visit the ancient ghost city of Paestum, a Greek city-state a short distance off the Autostrada between Naples and Salerno. The ruins of Paestum encompass an entire city with buildings and standing roofed temples. Paestum was abandoned, not because of the Goths or 9780230610644ts06.indd 1019780230610644ts06.indd 10112/7/2009 3:11:37 PM12/7/2009 3:11:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches102Vandals, but earlier. The exodus of Paestum’s inhabitants began probably shortly after Vesuvius’ eruption that blocked streams and caused marshes to infiltrate the lands around the city. Speaking of the volcano, I recall a student’s identification for Pompeii when he wrote: “A city destroyed in 79 [CE] by an eruption of saliva from the Vatican.” However, what destroyed Paestum was neither saliva nor lava, but the troublesome mosquito. Those pesky bugs were all too determined to find a bite.Absinthe, Artemisia’s Uplifter and DownplungerAn old Anglo-Saxon saying was “to drink wermōd [wormwood] in a dream betokens strife.”145 Alcohol and medicine are closer than cousins: many people historically associated medicine with its preferred delivery system in beer, wine, various fer-mented plants, and, finally, distilled beverages. Ironically the Arabs, forbidden by the Qur’an to drink inebriating drinks, invented distillation and entered into our vocabulary a new Arabic term, alcohol. My father was known to take a shot or two of whisky; he usually referred to the beverage as “his medicine.” When I curiously asked the purpose for the medicine, he replied, “It is a medicine and a tonic.” And so it was, although I suspected his motives were nontherapeutic, and I did not appreci-ate his defense. As I learned more about ancient medicine, I realized more the truth of his claims; he was in the historical mainstream in associating alcoholic drinks with medicinal deliveries. For example, when Europeans learned the South American use of cinchona to treat malaria, they realized quickly that its taste was very bitter. The medicine was more palatable when mixed with alcoholic drinks or inert flavoring agents. In the eighteenth century in India, the British mixed cinchona with a newly invented alcoholic drink called gin. Gin was an avant-garde discovery made proba-bly in the Netherlands (seventeenth century) by Franciscus Sylvius, a physician, who distilled juniper berries as a more pleasant and inexpensive way to deliver juniper’s diuretic, renal and other medicinal qualities. The English word gin derives from the French “genièvre,” meaning juniper.146 In 1817, a French chemist isolated qui-nine from the natural bark of the cinchona tree but, alas, its taste was still bitter. Thus, the British in India took their daily prophylactic gin and tonic (quinine). Armed with these combined and pleasant medicines, Europeans were enabled to penetrate malarial areas of Asia and Africa for “discoveries” and colonies. Gin and tonic medicinal drinks were in a long line of alcohol-based therapies. Very pleasant medicinal “spirits” were developed in various monastic pharmacies; Benedictine and Chartreuse quickly coming to mind. Some alcoholic drinks, however, were taken for their medicinal effect to alter the mind even more than alcohol alone.As the author of the most comprehensive and superior pharmaceutical guide in antiquity, Dioscorides seemed reluctant to include various wines with medicinal additives; he recognized that the action of medicinal wines was the composites of wine and additives. He seemed hesitant about including such wines when he said, “we hesitate to give wine but are forced to do so by the hankering of the patient.”147 The ancients seemed to associate wine (or other fermented drinks) with medicine and Dioscorides was compelled to add the first section of his Book Five on some of the medicinal wines. We can surmise that vendors sold various medicinal wines. From times more remote than our records, artemisia plant drugs were frequently 9780230610644ts06.indd 1029780230610644ts06.indd 10212/7/2009 3:11:37 PM12/7/2009 3:11:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"103Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”delivered with beer or wine. Already beginning with the Ebers Papyrus we saw arte-misia delivered in beer, whereas Assyrian medicine employed fermented plant juice. Dioscorides said, “We disapprove of using it [absinthe] in drinks because it is bad for the stomach and gives headaches.”148Alcohol and AbsintheDespite Dioscorides’s disapproval, absinthe and other artemisia species were very much a part of the lives of countless people throughout the ages. Absinthe’s benefits were regarded as both medicinal and recreational. As we shall see for the nineteenth century, its recreational use was expanded to include creative and inspirational use. In the ninth century, Walafrid Strabo, a very pious monk and writer about the herbs in his monastic garden, wrote this verse about absinthe (absinthium):The next bed grows bushes of bitter wormwood. Its supple stemResembles the Mother of Herbs [referring to mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris L.] but the leaves have a different color,The smell of its downy branches is different, too, and the brewIt makes has a bitterer taste by far. Its powers are famous,Its effectiveness proven. It tames a raging thirst; feverIt banishes. If, besides, your head should suddenly start toThrob and throb with pain, if fits of fainting worry you,Seek its help: Boil the bitter stem of a plantIn leaf, tip the brew into an ample basinAnd pour it over the top of your head.

However, a legacy may be found in modern Mexico, where women cel-ebrate a festival in honor of the goddess of salt by wearing garlands of wormwood as they perform a traditional dance.149 As an additive to beer, absinthe was employed religious ritual and worship, connected to Artemis, Salt, and other gods from antiq-uity to the present.Walafrid began his discussion of absinthe’s medicinal qualities by saying that the herb imparted a bitter taste to beer. For a long period, wormwood in its various species was added to beer to make its taste more pleasant. Not until the ninth cen-tury was when the use of hops invented in Germany—where else! Gradually hops replaced absinthe as a beer additive. According to modern tastes (and health), hops are superior to wormwood, although I speak as no authority. In 1710, in England, the use of absinthe in beer was forbidden for brewers’ use; however, retail and local 9780230610644ts06.indd 1039780230610644ts06.indd 10312/7/2009 3:11:38 PM12/7/2009 3:11:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches104brewers were allowed to continue their own additives, including absinthe, since peo-ple preferred familiar tastes in their ales. A winter brew called purl was permitted when orange peel and wormwood (absinthe?) were mixed in the recipe and became a working-class favorite. The London and Country Brewer (1759) was no purl sup-porter when it wrote: the “common weedy Wormwood . . . which Compound one would think, more fit for Puke, than a grateful cordial, stomachic Bitter.”150 In the reign of George III (1760–1801) purl beer with absinthe was a “very popular early morning drink” and called a “hot beer with a dash of gin.”151 What a way to begin a day! No wonder the American colonies were lost.From the Egyptians down to the present day, many of us have tasted absinthe in alcohol in a mild preparation. In 1786, in Turin, Italy, Antonio Benedetto Carpano experimented with the German recipe for wormwood-fortified wines. Camparo is a famous brand of vermouth widely sold, especially in Europe, taking the name from Gaspare Campari who marketed the formula between 1862 and 1867. The name vermouth is an Italian adoption from the German wermut. In the United States, the popular use of vermouth is to mix with gin or vodka for martinis. French vermouths today are usually white and dry whereas Italian ones are darker and sweeter, a sub-ject for which I am slightly more of an authority.Absinthe’s Impact on Nineteenth CenturyBy the sixteenth century, distilled liquors were a part of most Europeans’ lives. Some liquors served both as medicines and for their narcotic and/or mind altering quali-ties. Often they were regarded as an elixir, the quasi-mystical substance that would eradicate disease and aging, a subject in our last chapter. Prominent among the new elixirs was what Paracelsus and others referred to as absinthe Suisse.152 Switzerland was deemed the best producer of absinthe-laden alcoholic beverages that served as medicine. In 1792 Pierre Oridinaire, a French physician, fled from the Revolution in Paris to settle in Couvert, a Swiss village. He developed his own formula for absinthe alcohol, which he enjoyed entirely too much as he died of its cumula-tive effects. Nearby were the Henriod sisters, one of whom was Oridinaire’s house-keeper, who made the absinthe drink—whether by the same formula or a variant is debated. Controversy arises about whether the sisters received the formula from Oridinaire or whether they made up the story to lend prestige by the association with a medical doctor. This much followed: the sisters gave the recipe to a Major Daniel-Henri Dubied, who appreciated the beverage and drank it twice daily—it stimulates the genitals, he said! In drinking absinthe in the mornings and evenings, Dubied was following the advice of Nicholas Culpeper, who in 1653, said: “This infusion [of absinthe], drunk morning and evening for some time, helps hysterics, obstructions of the spleen, and weakness of the stomach.”153 Judging by the evi-dence, daily absinthe-drinking must have been a common practice for some centu-ries. What had changed was distillation thereby making concentrated absinthe oil with distilled alcohol more potent. Dubied passed the formula for his daily tots to Henri-Louis Pernod, his son-in-law. Pernod marketed the drink, and thus began the famous Pernod Fils Company in 1805, a company still selling beverages (see figure 4.3). Pernod aux extraits de plantes d’absinthe also was flavored with fennel, 9780230610644ts06.indd 1049780230610644ts06.indd 10412/7/2009 3:11:38 PM12/7/2009 3:11:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Figure 4.3 Posture (19th c.)

The monumental burst of popularity is traced to France’s war in Algeria where intestinal parasites and malaria probably killed more soldiers than were killed by the local militias. The army’s medical corps issued an absinthe alco-holic drink in place of quinine for malaria. Moreover, it protected against intestinal parasites. Quinine was said to be too expensive, and the absinthe medicine proved popular with the soldiers as some of them transferred from Africa to Madagascar and Vietnam. The London Times reported in 1872 that “Fever made grievous havoc in the ranks of the army.”155 With each sip of the medicine wonders were worked for the soldiers’ morale: protection from malaria and worms. Don’t drink the water; it is unhealthy, and so it was. However, it was dangerous also to drink its medicinal sub-stitute, absinthe alcohol, just as the classical and medieval sources had warned, and moderns neglected to heed. Initially provided by the French army’s medical corps, absinthe alcoholic drinks were popular throughout Europe and, to a lesser degree, America, but soldiers were partly responsible for its popular acceptance seen in the 1871 cartoon spoof of a soldier drinking absinthe (see figure 4.4).The sale of absinthe alcoholic drinks became fashionable in Europe, most especially in France. Like alcohol, it was intoxicating. As a current Web site that describes the several absinthe-drinking rituals, its effects are “visual disturbances, unusual sensitivity to light and color, mild euphoria, and a peculiarly clear-headed type of drunkenness.”156 This modern description is parallel to the earlier Anglo-Saxon quotation: “to drink wermōd [absinthe] in a dream betokens strife.” Walafrid Strabo’s “marvelous” action for a garland made of absinthe is probably an allusion to the medieval ritual discussed above. Rituals and absinthe-drinking are histori-cally linked. When ingested, not worn, absinthe’s actions are in the head, not on it. Intoxicating, mind-altering, convulsive narcotic: these words are used to describe its effects, but the drink was devised as medicine.A manufacturer’s manual for the distillation and manufacture of alcoholic liquors published in Paris in 1866–1867 gave a number of recipes for absinthe alco-holic drinks but said these drinks are “a horrible curse, which is killing the youth of our colleges, decimating the army, and will cause fatal debasement of the ris-ing generation.”157 Absinthe was linked as a cause, if not the cause, of France’s lost Franco-Prussian War, near-loss in World War I, and the “decadence threatening the British Empire.”158 Newspapers and journals of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries record numerous human tragedies in multiple numbers: families ruined and horrible crimes committed by people crazed on its intoxication.Absinthe has compounds, especially notably α- and β-thujone (also discussed earlier) that occupy the same receptor sites as marijuana; both seem to have simi-lar molecular structures for this reception.159 A recent laboratory study using rats, 9780230610644ts06.indd 1069780230610644ts06.indd 10612/7/2009 3:11:46 PM12/7/2009 3:11:46 PM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Figure 4.4 Giclée art print of Absinthe showing a caricature by Gill, satirizing the French military’s love of Absinthe, 1874.Source: Courtesy of David Nathan-Maister and the Virtual Absinthe Museum, http://www.oxygenee.com.9780230610644ts06.indd 1079780230610644ts06.indd 10712/7/2009 3:11:47 PM12/7/2009 3:11:47 PM"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches108however, indicated that, while the intoxicating effects of marijuana and thujone were similar, the activation of the same receptors is not supported by the study’s data.160 Both marijuana and absinthe are terpenoids, formed by a similar biosyn-thetic mechanism, and possess similar molecular structures. An oxygen molecule is the difference and probably occupying the same receptor sites without changing the orientation of the oxygen molecule.161 Rats and humans are different and may have different results in testing. This much is certain: both substances produce a mind-altering experience or, in more precise terms, it has a psychotominmetic effect. Of the two, thujone is likely more pronounced. Its effects, of course, depend on con-centration and amount of alcohol in its delivery and can have a profound mental alteration that leads to physiological impairments: convulsions, vertigo, insomnia, nervousness, nausea, and tremors.162 The twenty-fifth edition of the United States Dispensatory (1955) said of absinthe in a volatile oil, which is how it was often served especially in the nineteenth century: “an active narcotic poison [that] causes trem-bling, stupor, and later violent epileptiform convulsions, involuntary evacuations, unconsciousness, and stertorous breathing, which may or may not end in death.”163Creativity, Death, and Absinthe Addiction in Nineteenth-Century FranceErnest Hemingway’s For Whom the Bells Toll (first published in 1940) has this con-versation in Spanish civil war between Robert Jordan, his central figure, and a gypsy about a bottle of absinthe:“What drink is that?” the gypsy asked.“A medicine,” Robert Jordan said. “Do you want to taste it?”“What is it for?”“For everything,” Robert Jordan said. “It cures everything. If you have anything wrong this will cure it.”164Hemingway’s advocacy for absinthe as a medicine, albeit in a fictional character’s words, came near the mid-twentieth century. Despite his claim that “it cures every-thing,” Hemingway’s absinthe was more for the soul than the body.Many artists and literati found inspiration and joy in absinthe. Ernest Hemingway continued this exchange between Robert Jordan and the gypsy to whom he offered a drink of absinthe:He [Robert Jordan looked forward to] being able to read and relax in the evening; of all things he had enjoyed and forgotten and that came back to him when he tasted the opaque, bitter, tongue-numbing, brain-warming, stomach-warming, idea-changing liquid alchemy. The gypsy made a face and handed the cup back. “It smells of anise but it is bitter as gall,” he said. “It is better to be sick than have that medicine.” “That’s wormwood,” Robert Jordan told him. “In this, the real absinthe, there is wormwood. It’s supposed to rot your brain out but I don’t believe it. It only changes the ideas.”Hemingway came near the end of the period when artists and literati were enamored of the alleged positive affects that absinthe had on the human mind.9780230610644ts06.indd 1089780230610644ts06.indd 10812/7/2009 3:11:52 PM12/7/2009 3:11:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"109Artemisia, the “Mother Herb”In 1859, Edouard Manet finished a large-size, gripping painting of a disgruntled bum with his title for it: The Absinthe Drinker, thereby beginning a long list of artists whose subject was either absinthe drinkers, absinthe bottles, or both: Edgar Degas, Gustave Moreau, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Pablo Picasso. In 1860, one year after Manet’s The Absinthe Drinker, Henri Balestra wrote Absinthe et Absintheus, known for the beginning of the socializa-tion of absinthe drinking. In Europe, particularly in the urban areas of France and Spain, the etiquette of cafés developed absinthe-drinking rituals. In New Orleans an absinthe cafe still stands. Writers and artists had, or at least, thought that they had, their inspiration derived from the plant’s effects; these include Charles Baudelaire, Gustave Courbet, Paul Verlaine (“I get drunk to keep up my reputation”), Arthur Rimbraud, Oscar Wilde, Ernest Dowson, and Emile Zola. While touring America, Oscar Wilde said, “Absinthe has a wonderful color, green. A glass of absinthe is as poetical as anything in the world. What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?” Well, there was a sunset in van Gogh’s absinthe-drinking life. He had two sustained episodes of depression followed by bursts of high energy, productivity, and creativity. More than 150 physicians have ventured diagnoses, but a consensus of opinion asserts that absinthe played a key role.165 His bursts of colors are the subject of a recent study that links absinthe with creativity.166 Van Gogh was so enamored with the drink that he painted it (see figure 4.5). At the age of thirty-seven, driven by a distorted mind, he died of a self-inflicted wound. His mind produced the splendid images on canvas with yellow hues and halo effects, conjec-turally derived from a drug-distorted brain.167 What conversations he and Gauguin must have had when they drank absinthe together in Paris and Arles!In fact absinthe alcoholic drinks are illegal in most western countries, with leg-islation that began early in the twentieth century, as we shall discuss later. For now, no reader should drink absinthe drinks (although legal in some countries); that said, absinthe, a species named for the goddess and still known in the Christian world as the Mother Herb, regularly affected many people. Thujone, a psychologically active compound, is a volatile oil and its presence in absinthe accounts range from 0.25 to 1.32 percent of content. Preparation would be by making a decoction, a “cooking down” for higher concentration. It takes only a few drops, as recounted by Robert Service in “The Shooting of Dan McGrew”:A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon; The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune; Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew, And watching his luck was his light-o’-love, the lady that’s known as Lou.

The ratio of ben-efits to harm strongly favors absinthe and other artemisia species as a blessing to women from the goddess (or God, as in biblical times). The Mother Herb was so named because of its importance for women’s general health in a variety of ways. Lamentations (3: 15) is emphatic about the misery wormwood (or absinthe) can cause: “He [God] hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.”169 God’s judgment for apostasy is similar to the results of drinking absinthe, namely a madness and disorientation. Shortly thereafter, see Lamentations (3:17): “Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.” An allusion to absinthe’s mind-altering qualities was made in Amos (5:7): “O you who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth.” The Mother Herb was also called “the herb of forgetfulness,” because of its mind- altering qualities. An old Russian story tells that mankind forgot the understanding of speech and the uses of plants when a peasant spoke the name for the plant despite an injunction not to do so.170ConclusionIn 1905 in Switzerland, a thirty-two-year-old laborer drank absinthe until he was literally out-of-his-mind; he took his rifle and killed his wife, two daughters, and attempted unsuccessfully to kill himself.171 In the 1890s, nation-states in Europe and North America had begun to regulate substances; at first, it was pharma-ceuticals, because of particularly egregious practices by unscrupulous peddlers and manufacturers who adulterated and substituted base substances sold under the labels of legitimate drugs. Across much of Europe and North America came the realization that absinthe was a pernicious and devilish drug that ought to be banned. Succinctly, Raoul Ponchone said, “C’est le diable fait liquide” or loosely, the devil is in the bottle.172 In 1915, France (where there was perhaps the greatest addiction among the working and creative classes) and the United States banned absinthe alcohol. Many European nations followed; other nations regulated the amount of absinthe. In the 1990s, the European Union reauthorized the sale of absinthe alcohol (vermouth was always excepted). In 2007, distillation resumed in the United States with restricted amounts of absinthe. By 2008 there were more than 200 brands available.Artemisia plants have a long history. The plant of the goddess Artemis saved women from hardship, pain, and death; it gave comfort and health to many people throughout the millennia. Through the generations, its health benefits were over-shadowed, not because the plants’ chemistries changed, but because humans abused its compounds. The obverse is also true: because of its antimalarial qualities, it is saving hundreds of thousands lives; as we learn more about its complex chemistry, 9780230610644ts06.indd 1119780230610644ts06.indd 11112/7/2009 3:12:06 PM12/7/2009 3:12:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches112these numbers should expand into the millions annually.

Therein lay the trouble. The Israelites considered circumcision an irreversible act of religious and cultural identification.1 Herodotus said the practice originated in Eg ypt, as well it may have, as a young man is seen undergoing circumcision depicted on a relief found on the tomb of a vizier to the Pharaoh Teti (ca. 2300 BCE) at Sakkara, 6th Dynasty (see figure 5.1). In the panel on the right, a surgeon (priest?) 9780230610644ts07.indd 1139780230610644ts07.indd 11312/7/2009 3:12:26 PM12/7/2009 3:12:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches114cuts a young man with a f lint knife. In front of the surgeon-priest, the hieroglyphic signs say: “The hem-ka priest is circumcising.” Reading the writings at the top from left to right, the surgeon-priest says to the attendant: “Hold him fast; do not let him fall,” as he cuts with the f lint knife. After the surgery, in the second panel the youth says to the surgeon: “Rub it well that it may be effective,” to which the surgeon replies: “I am acting for your praise.”2 The “rub it well” phrase points to a regional anesthesia and/or antiseptic.3 Early in the same millennium as the Egyptian relief, however, circumcised warriors in Syria are clearly shown.4 The Jews were not alone in the religious surgical obser vance, but resistance to circumcision came when Judea came under the power of the Greeks following Alexander the Great’s conquest. It was truly a cultural clash.Alexander’s policies were followed by his successors, but exactly what they were is open to interpretation. Historians argue about whether Alexander’s motives were to promote a fusion of Europe and Asia—most historians now doubt fusion as an intentional policy goal—but the inescapable fact is that A lexander and his successor spread Hellenic culture throughout the vast areas of Asia they visited.5 Many Asians supported Hellenization, others vehemently opposed it. This cultural clash took two major forms: the presentation of Greek drama, and the participation in sports and with it, the gymnasium. James Michener understood the cultural clash when an athletic Jewish youth, one of his protagonists, was ashamed of his nakedness, not Figure 5. 1 Egyptian circumcision procedure from tomb of a vizier to the Pharaoh Teti (ca. 2300 BCE) at Sakkara, 6th Dynasty.Source: Photo credit: Werner Forman/ Art Resource, NY.9780230610644ts07.indd 1149780230610644ts07.indd 11412/7/2009 3:12:27 PM12/7/2009 3:12:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"115The Chaste Treethat he was naked but that his glans was showing. Strangely (to us), there was only one particle of modesty among the ancient Greeks: while public nudity was accept-able, the sight of the glans was strictly reprehensible. Some fifth-century Greek vases depicted villains with bulbous externalized glans, whereas heroes or idealized men had tapered, covered glans. Ugly people, barbarians, and slaves were often depicted with exposed glans.6The Greeks abhorred any mutilation of the body; to them, the abhorrence was just as religious as was circumcision among the Jews.7 Greek boys born with an abnormally short foreskin could go to a surgeon to add length to cover the glans. One might say that this operation, known as epispasm, was a mutilation itself, but the Greeks considered it merely a correction of nature’s error. Michener’s athlete was encouraged to participate in the regional games at Antioch, but he could not do so being circumcised. Solution: a surgical procedure to reverse the action and replace the foreskin. The drama unfolded when he took his place on the field with other nude athletes and from the crowd came: “Menelaus! You are one of us!” And a cho-rus of fans added: “He is a Greek! He is a Greek!”8 Oh, my, how ashamed was his father as he witnessed his son’s new nudity in a public arena!Operation of EpispasmThe name, epispasm (epispastikos), is from St. Paul (1 Corinthians 7. 18):Was any one at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was any one at the time of his call uncircumcised (epispasthō= “pull-over”).9An unlikely candidate for new medical terms, St. Paul gave us the word epis-pasm. The Greek (or Seleucid) King Antiochus IV (surnamed: Epiphanes, r. 175–164 BCE) was not anti-Jewish in his policies: he granted the Jews various tax exemptions and significantly subsidized the Temple in Jerusalem. Generally Hellenistic rulers were religiously tolerant, but they drew the line on circumci-sion, so repugnant was it to them. Antiochus forbade circumcision on pain of a dreadful death.10 Maccabees 2 (4:12) expressed Antiochus’ actions this way: “For with alacrity he founded a gymnasium right under the citadel, and he induced the noblest of the young men to wear the Greek hat.” By the second century BCE more Jews lived in Alexandria, Egypt, than in Jerusalem, but in Alexandria all non-Greeks were taxed. Adolescent males (known in Greek as ephebes) exercised at the gymnasia and some Jewish youths, who were not circumcised or had its reversal, sought to cross the line for full citizenship through socialization and par-ticipation in athletics in the gymnasia. This caused the author of 3 Maccabees to condemn those Jews who became Greek ephebates.11 Some Jews, inclined to accept Hellenism, accepted the new law against circumcision of eight-day-old males and reversals for men; a Jewish conservative group refused; some of them were mar-tyred by paying the ultimate penalty. The pro-Hellenic group was later called Sadducees, whereas the conservatives were to be called Pharisees. The issues divid-ing these two “parties” were present in Jesus’s time. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote: “They concealed their circumcision to be Greeks even when unclothed.”12 9780230610644ts07.indd 1159780230610644ts07.indd 11512/7/2009 3:12:29 PM12/7/2009 3:12:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches116There existed an intermediate form of, shall we say, “circumcision treatment” that Soranus described as follows:If the infant is male and it looks as though it has no foreskin, she [midwife] should gently draw the tip of the foreskin forward, or even hold it together with a strand of wool to fasten it. For if gradually stretched and continuously drawn forward, it easily stretches and assumes its normal length and covers the glans and becomes accustomed to keep the natural good shape.13This method is called infibulation or in Greek lipodermos; this procedure was not at the heart of the issue. Infibulation was simply stretching the skin, which would not fool a close observer and, in any case, would not be successful for all patients. The honey (used as an emollient for thirty days) and the herb giant carrot (Thapsia garganica L.) were used in the infibulation procedure well described by a number of ancient authorities.14 Dioscorides stated: “It [giant carrot] is used also for the foreskin, raising a swelling on people who have no foreskin but not because of cir-cumcision. For the defective part of the phallus is bathed and softened by the oint-ment, it fills up.”15 Celsus, the Roman medical writer, doubted the effectiveness of infibulation.A true circumcision reversal procedure was central to the cultural clash issue. A document known as the Testament of Moses (written perhaps during the period of Antiochus IV16) regarded Antiochus’s edict against circumcision as oppression and torture when the treatise stated: “Their [the Jews] young sons shall be cut by physicians to bring forward their foreskin.”17 This surgical procedure is the heart of the cultural issue, not merely skin stretching. Celsus relates the details of two epispasm surgical procedures; in his words, “If the glans is bare and the man wishes for the look of the thing to have it covered, that can be done.”18 To do it involved nifty plastic surgery, one that we instinctively believe only modern medicine could have known. Boys are more easily treated than men, he observed. Celsus’s details described the two procedures: one is when there is a small defect of nature that is more easily corrected. The other is for “one who after the cus-tom of certain races has been circumcised.”19 Jody F. Rubin has researched these two procedures as described by Celsus.20 Since Rubin’s study, Dirk Schultheiss, a physician in Hannover, Germany, joined some of his colleagues in reviewing the surgical procedures and carried this historical research down to Nazi Germany when some surgeons clandestinely performed essentially the same procedures as Celsus outlined for Jews’ protection.21 The first method is a cut of a patch of skin on the penis stem, loosening the epidermis and sliding forward the skin over the glans to reconstruct the prepuce. To be sure, scar tissue would form in the band, but the glans would be covered. The true epispasm (or uncircumcision) method is to incise at triangular cuts around the corona, the base of the glans, loosen the skin’s epidermal attachment, and pull it over the glans. For each of these proce-dures two critical steps have to be taken. The skin drawn over the glans would not have epidermal exterior and interior layers, so a plaster separation must be made to allow a new epidermal layer to cover the prepuce. A similar separation would have to be made separating the new prepuce from contact with the glans. 9780230610644ts07.indd 1169780230610644ts07.indd 11612/7/2009 3:12:30 PM12/7/2009 3:12:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"117The Chaste TreeCelsus describes this second procedure:If the glans has become so covered that it cannot be bared, a lesion which the Greeks call phimosis, it must be opened out, which is done as follows: underneath the foreskin is to be divided from its free margin in a straight line back as far as the frenum, and thus the skin above is retracted. But if this is not successful, either on account of the constriction or of the hardness of the skin, a triangular piece of foreskin is cut out from underneath, having its apex at the frenum [=a membranous fold of skin], and its base at the edge of the prepuce. Then lint dressing and other medicaments to induce healing are put on. But it is necessary that the patient should lie up until the wound heals, for walking rubs the wound and makes it foul.22The second hurdle is that the man should have no erections for the weeks of post-surgical healing.23 Celsus spoke of this impediment only by saying that in order to allay “erectile function,” the patient should fast to reduce his libido. Now, this is too much to expect of virile, late adolescent male athletes. Besides, as we know from dieting, cheating is easily done as the days roll by into weeks. In the weeks of postsurgery, a single erection would undo the work. An eighteen year old, no matter how much he suppresses thinking about sex, will think about it anyway—he simply will. No citations in medical journals needed on this subject. To accomplish this period of quiescence, a plant was used to insure a successful operation. The surgical operation was directly linked with the Jewish Maccabean Rebellion (167 BCE) and the establishment of an independent Judea. Later more information will be related on the Rebellion, so now let us look at the plant that made this happen. It is the chaste tree, a small tree, whose name in Greek, agnos, meant “chaste” and whose name in modern scientific nomenclature is Vitex agnus castus L., meaning chaste tree. Castus in Latin means “pure” or “unstained,” thus the tree is “pure chastity.” Probably because the chaste tree’s leaves resemble those of the willow, according to Pliny, 24 the plant’s genus name in scientific nomenclature is Vitex.The Chaste Tree Plant as Male Contraceptive and Sexual SuppressantPriests ate of the chaste tree to prevent their having erections but it was in conjunc-tion with other plants. The Pseudo-Galenic work De remediis parabilibus25:Things having power over stopping intercourse (sunousiazeiv): Priests (ieraeis) eat rocket (Eruca sativa L.), rue (Ruta graveolens L.), and the chaste tree (agnon=Vitex agnus castus L). Certainly with rocket seeds in conjunction with honey and fasting, one is not able to have an erection (orthoisthai).Dioscorides and other classical writers make no such claim for rocket; he even said that rocket was an aphrodisiac, the opposite of the chaste tree.26 Concerning rue, he said, “the seed quells the organ of generation when eaten and when drank.”27Before concentrat ing on t he cha ste tree, let u s d irect ou r at tent ion to t he pla nt r ue that was also in Galen’s preparation. No modern research in the databases indicates testing rocket for hormonal effects in mammals. Rue is different.

Published in 2007 was the result of a study testing the immobilization effect of rue on human sperm. The experimenters were physicians in the Department of Physiology, Medical Sciences, at the University of Tehran. They selected rue because of its use in tra-ditional Iranian medicine as a male contraceptive. Inasmuch as the usual address for male antifertility measures is either condoms or vasectomy, a male equivalent of the female contraceptive drugs would be welcomed, presumably. When different doses of lyophilized aqueous extract of rue were placed in a dish together with live human sperms cells, immobilization was immediate, but the degree varied with the strength of the rue extract. After washing, the sperm returned to mobility in this in vitro experiment. Importantly the degree of activity was dose-dependent, with immobility occurring at a concentration of 100 mh/ml.29 In 2005, two faculty members of the medical university in Jordan experimented using albino rats who ingested rue. Male rats had sperm motility and density in testicular ducts “signifi-cantly decrease[d].” These experimenters were not testing contraceptive uses but the aggression and sexual behavior in male rats. Conclusion: “Ingestion of R. graveol-ens markedly abolished aggressive behavior parameter in adult male treated rats.”30 These animal tests indicate an effect on male fertility for higher mammals. What we do not k now is whether rocket seeds are the opposite of Viagra, na mely that these seeds prevent erectile function. There is evidence, however, that the chaste tree has that effect.Our attention turns to the chaste tree because of the persistence in traditional medicine and historical medical records for its effect on male sexual activity. Neither rocket nor rue has historical continuity in Western medical sources but the chaste tree does for suppression of sexual activity. Moreover, like pomegranates, mandrakes, and artemisia, the chaste tree is connected with ancient mythology. Science journals have many studies based on in vitro and various animal clinical trials that indicate that the chaste tree has definitive suppression of sexual activity and spermatogenesis in males. An Indian study employed male Wistar rats to test a related species, Vitex negundo, commonly found in India and selected (at least, that was inferred from the published account) because of its reputation as a male contra-ceptive in traditional Ayurvedic folk medicine. Extracts were obtained from seeds a nd in va rious concentrations. The rats were divided into f ive groups of four a nima ls each and injected with varying concentrations once daily for fifteen days. They were killed and subjected to hematological and sperm counts analyses, including postmortem anatomical studies of various organs. Ranging by degrees according to concentrations, the spermatozoa count was significantly reduced progressively. The few remaining healthy sperm were likely “inadequate for achieving fertilization.”31 No behavioral changes were observed before death and postmortem examinations of organs revealed no organ abnormalities. The study concluded that “It is abun-dantly clear that the seed extracts of V. negundo have a profound effect on the sperm quality and the functioning of the accessory sex organs.”32 To test the chaste tree on female reproduction, experimenters found that mice given doses of 60 to120 mg on days four and six of pregnancy had 100 percent of pregnancies terminated through implantation disruption. For days eight to ten of pregnancy, 50 percent had their 9780230610644ts07.indd 1189780230610644ts07.indd 11812/7/2009 3:12:30 PM12/7/2009 3:12:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"119The Chaste Treepregnancies terminated.33 Consistently through the ages the chaste tree was used as an abortifacient, but its use as a male contraceptive is less well documented.34Even though they are easy to obtain and control, rats are not always the best sub-jects for clinical reproduction studies. Another Indian study, published in France, tested the same species, V. negundo, on ten adult male dogs with a control group. Seed extracts were ingested every other day over forty-five days to test the influ-ence on testicular and epididymal function. The plant “inhibits spermatogenesis as well as it alters epididymal function.”35 Moreover after withholding the treat-ment, spermatogenesis returned, thereby making the chaste tree a reversible male contraceptive.Studies have tested the effects of the chaste tree on human males. Ingested the plant causes a prolactin-inhibiting action. In pharmacological terms it has a dopa-minergic action based on stimulation of D2-type dopamine receptors. A clinical test was conducted with twenty healthy males with variables depending on baseline val-ues of the individuals.36 The libido and fertility in males were drastically reduced. Importantly, there were no serious side effects, even with higher dosages, although it should be stated that the full pharmacok inetics and toxicolog y of chaste trees have yet to be defined.37Chaste Tree Uses in Ancient Egypt and AssyriaDespite the near-certainty that the chaste tree grew in Palestine, the plant is not mentioned in the Bible; however, other peoples of West Asia and Egypt knew some of its medicinal qualities.38 The ancient Egyptians knew the plant as s ́3m (romaniz-ing the hieroglyphs) but not for reproduction or sexuality suppression as seen in the surviving documents. If our identification of s ́3m is correct, chaste tree [bark?] was used in bandages to reduce swelling, to help with constipation, and, its bark ground with water, to strengthen the teeth.39 Assyrian medicine prescribed the use of the chaste tree. R. Campbell Thompson identifies two Assyrian words: šamŠišbânu (which could either be Vitex negundo L. or V. agnus castus L.) and šamŠana-a (as V. agnus castus L. or the chaste tree). The names appear in a list of small trees (which is what the chaste tree is). The first species (which Thompson considers ambiguous) was used on bandages similarly to the Egyptian use. The chaste tree alone was used on the feet for swelling and childbirth.40 The childbirth use will be discussed later; the application on the feet is, again, similar to the Egyptian medical use.The God Priapus and PriapismAn Assyrian medical recipe was used to treat priapism, a serious medical condition when a male maintains a continuous erection. The recipe does not have the pharma-ceutical used to treat it, but the first part reads: “If a person continually has an erec-tion when he tries to urinate . . . .”41 Another Assyrian source explains how serious priapism is: “If the soles of his feet are cold, the rims of his eyes are swollen, his penis is stiff and hard, (and) his navel is supple, ‘hand’ of curse; (if) he lingers, he will die.”42 The condition is a real one, a current aff liction that is caused by neurological and vascular factors; just as the Assyrian text read, priapism is potentially fatal.9780230610644ts07.indd 1199780230610644ts07.indd 11912/7/2009 3:12:31 PM12/7/2009 3:12:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches120Priapus’s mother, Aphrodite, disowned him because of her revulsion for his grotesquely large penis and his foul language. His paternity varied in the ancient sources ranging from Zeus, Pan, Dionysus, and Hermes; disowned by his mother, Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs. In one story, he attempted to have sexual liaison with the nymph Lotis while she slept, but the braying of an ass awoke her in time to escape. The gods and goddesses saved Lotis from his pursuit. They condemned Priapus with a perpetual erection from which he could derive no pleasure by inter-course or masturbation; with it came pain and isolation. Whereas Priapus was never a prestigious god, the abundance of statuettes and paintings (walls and vases) attests to his popularity among the common folk.43 Without labels, Priapus is recognizable by—well, you know.Galen, the physician in the Roman Empire, described priapism (the condition named after the god) and its remedy:Priapism is an increase in length as well as circumference of the entire male organ without desire for sexual intercourse, and without some acquired heat. . . . Some have outlined the condition as follows . . . a persistent, unchanging increase in size of the male organ or a persistent swelling. It obviously has a name derived from Priapus. For human beings sculpt as well as paint Priapus as one who by nature has such an organ . . . And to treat priapism, apply the things that have been discovered by experi-ence to be natura lly ef f icacious, na mely give him [the patient suf fering from priapism] yellow waterlily [nymphaia] to drink, the seed of the chaste tree and pale rue mixed with his food.44About the yellow (or white) water lily, Dioscorides said that its root, ingested, allays wet dreams (“ejaculations during sleep”), and he added, “it effects a slackness of the genitalia for a few days if one kept on drinking it.” Similar results are achieved with its seeds.45 Unable to find modern science research on the possible effects of the white water lily on priapism, several Web sites say that it is an aphrodisiac, and it was employed in ancient Vedic medicine as a sedative.46Chaste Tree in Classical Medicine as Male Sexual Suppressant and ContraceptiveThe English name “chaste tree” has the same meaning as the Greek agnos, which means “chaste,” “pure,” and/or “holy.” A similar meaning was conveyed in Latin. The name itself told only a small part of the story; certainly the plant was thought to suppress the male libido and was connected to the gods in a strange way. Aelian (third century CE) connected agnos’ meaning with its suppressive effect on “sexual appetite/ aphrodisiou kōluma.”47 A mong its uses was to suppress wet dreams or invol-untary nocturnal emissions of semen.Galen said thatThe fruit of the chaste tree . . . does not cause wind [f latulence] in the belly, both when unroasted, and even more so when roasted. And it keeps in check sexual impulses—both the roasted and the unroasted fruit do so—and the leaves and flowers of the shrub can do this same thing, so that it is trusted to effect chastity, not only when 9780230610644ts07.indd 1209780230610644ts07.indd 12012/7/2009 3:12:31 PM12/7/2009 3:12:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"121The Chaste Treeit is eaten and drunk but also when it is strewn underneath as bedding. . . . From all of which it is clear . . . that that chaste tree heats, then it dries at generate f latulent pneuma [air], it would have inflated the belly [womb?] and thus would have sharp-ened the sexual impulses. But . . . it not only does not spur them on but also by nature suppresses them.48Pliny said that the chaste tree inhibits sexual desire.49 Oribasius (fourth centur y CE) said that flakes of lead prevented wet dreams (oneirotokos) when placed under the loins just as do rue and “tender extremities of the chaste tree” in a person’s bedding. He added that the same effect occurs when rue and the chaste seed are eaten.50 Paul of Aegina repeated much of the same thing: “The Chaste-tree . . . consists of fine par-ticles and dispels f latulence, whence it is believed to contribute to chastity, not only when drunk, but also when strewed under one [as in bedding].”51 Galen was once a physician in a gladiatorial school, and he expressed his admiration for an athletic trainer who used chaste twigs in bedding to avoid wet dreams. Presumably Galen thought that prevention of nocturnal emissions helped his athletic prowess.52 The use in bedding, as we shall see below, was also connected to religious ritual.The Chaste Tree, Epispasm, and CircumcisionDioscorides wrote that the chaste tree “slackens the organ of generation,”53 a polite way of saying that the plant prevents or, at least, impedes an erection. As we saw earlier, Aelian wrote that the chaste tree (agnos) was so named because it was “an impediment to sexual impulse.”54 During the Middle Ages, the chaste tree was known as monk’s pepper in English,55 Mönchspfeffer in German.56 The monks used the chaste plant instead of pepper to suppress sexual desires.57 The monk’s pepper name indicates a continuation of use given by the pseudo-Galenic work, which said that priests use the chaste tree to prevent erections. Dioscorides explained the asso-ciation with pepper because, he said, the chaste tree seeds resemble pepper.58 The Benedictine Rules mandated that monks were to sleep in separate beds and that “the younger brothers shall not have beds by themselves, but interspersed among those of the elder ones.”59 Monastic order took steps to curtail sexual activity. As late as 1620s Jean Prevost’s medicinal guide recommended use of the chaste tree, as it extinguished a man’s semen “to impede generation.”60 The natural question is: why, if this were truly a male contraceptive, did it not continue in use and have an impact in today’s society? An answer or, at least, an address of the question is postponed to the next and last chapter.Maccabean Revolt, 167–163The evidence points to common-sense measures to curb male sexuality in classical and medieval societies. Let us return now to the Jews of the second century BCE. The circumstantial evidence is persuasive that the Jewish male youths employed under a physician’s direction the chaste tree in order to have a successful postsur-gical course of action in the epiplasm or circumcision-reversal operation. In 167 BCE Antiochus Epiphanus outlawed Jewish practices, including circumcision—the 9780230610644ts07.indd 1219780230610644ts07.indd 12112/7/2009 3:12:32 PM12/7/2009 3:12:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches122f lash-point. The second policy as a means of Hellenization, celebration of drama in the theater, seemed to produce no emotional opposition. Measures against circum-cision did! Mattathias, a common man who had had enough, killed a Hellenizing Jew who pushed for reform in his village; with his five sons, Mattathias took to the hills. Other Jews joined them and quickly an insurrection was underway. A year later Judah “Maccabeus” (“the Hammer”), Mattathias’s son, achieved a major vic-tory over the Seleucid (Greek) army. Subsequent events enabled an independent Jewish state by 163 BCE. These events, known as the Maccabean Revolt, turned on the action of a plant, the chaste tree along with some skillful surgery. Without the chaste tree, uncircumcision would not be possible. Its critical use in surgery was a factor in the events leading to the Maccabean revolt. James Michener captured the intensity of feeling on both sides, Greek and Jewish. The chaste tree’s inf luence on history did not end with the Maccabean revolt.The Roma ns’ attitude wa s simila r to t hat of t he Greek s: circumcision wa s a loat h-some assault on the body. Nevertheless, even after the Jewish-Roman War and the Destruction of the Temple (70 CE), the Romans did not legislate against circum-cision probably in recognition that its enforcement would lead to public disorder. Although we do not have the wording of the legislation, under the Roman Emperor Hadrian (117–138) circumcision was forbidden on pain of death, not because of reli-gious intolerance but because it was regarded as unacceptable, barbarous behavior.61 The law, probably enacted in the year 132 CE, was not ethno-specific, and, even more to the point, it held as equally felonious castration and circumcision.62 The Jews were not specifically targeted because it applied to a number of groups, includ-ing Egyptian priests. The prohibition of castration, a loathsome and public proce-dure, would apply to the religious rites in Magna Mater or Cybele worship. The next emperor, Antoninius Pius (138–161), reversed Hadrian’s legislation in part, thereby permitting Jews to continue their practice. As quoted in the Corpus Iuris Civilis’ Digest (and essentially in medieval law thereafter): “Jews are permitted to circum-cise only their sons on the authority of a rescript of the Divine Pius; if anyone shall commit it on one who is not of the same religion, he shall suffer the punishment of a castrator.”63 In practice, the law forbade circumcisions of Jews’ slaves and had the effect of preventing proselytizing. The fact that Celsus, the Roman medical writer, had the elaborated discussion of the procedures for circumcision reversal indicates that the surgical procedure was not historical antiquarianism; it was a current prac-tice in his time, early first century.Thesmophoria and Chaste TreeAlready in chapter two we saw the association and use of the pomegranate in the ancient women’s ritual known as the Thesmophoria, the annual cult of Demeter in which Greek women go on a retreat for a period of three to ten days in the late fall. Although the festival was for fertility, on the second day the women—for only they were present—fasted for the day and slept that night on a bed of chaste twigs and leaves. Pliny wrote: “The Greeks call it lygos [an alternate name], sometimes agnos, because the Athenian matrons, preserving their chastity at the Thesmophoria, strew their beds with its leaves.”64 Writing probably a few years earlier 9780230610644ts07.indd 1229780230610644ts07.indd 12212/7/2009 3:12:32 PM12/7/2009 3:12:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"123The Chaste Treethan Pliny, Dioscorides related the same information as Pliny about the chaste tree and Thesmophoria but added “because the women make it a point of religion.”65 Heinrich von Staden’s study of the Thesmophoria and the chaste tree confirms that the symbolism for the day and night’s activities was for abstinence from food, com-fort, and sexual activity. By the women sleeping on a bed of the chaste tree (twigs, leaves, bark), von Staden saw its meaning as “not only a regression into precultural wildness, but also a new beginning, at the very inception both of culture and of human life.”66 Above, we saw that Galen spoke of chaste tree bedding as a way for males to suppress their sexual desires whereas Oribasius and Paul were not gender-specific when they asserted that chaste tree bedding promoted chastity. To us mod-erns it is incongruous that married Greek women would be preserving chastity, but the ancients saw chastity not so much as virginal as pure in actions. Von Staden saw a paradox in that a festival for promoting fertility would have as a component a “suppressant of sexual desire.”67 The practice was more than symbolism because the Thesmophorians believed that their ritualized actions either suppressed sexuality or were instructive about the same. If merely symbolism for a back-to-nature rite, then a set of twigs from any bush or tree would be equally serviceable. Paul of Aegina said that products of the chaste tree either eaten or in bedding promoted chastity, and Galen said in bedding wet dreams were prevented. Our modern science gives evidences that the chaste tree was meaningfully named: it suppresses sexual activ-ity in men. We cannot infer, one way or the other, whether transdermal absorption was sufficient for a pharmacological action when a person slept on the chaste-tree bedding. Certainly the action at the Thesmophoria was partly, not exclusively, sym-bolic. Von Staden assembled many more references in the works of Homer, the Homeric hymns and other pieces of Greek literature for one to conclude safely that sleeping on chaste-tree bedding was rooted in the popular culture.I cannot restrain a speculative indulgence: in going to the Thesmophoria, women were leaving their husbands alone for days. Surely some women left some chaste tree ground bark or seeds in the leftover stew so that their men would not stray from home in lustful quest. The festival would be instructive as well as religious. Women would want to know both how to promote sexual activity and how to suppress it: in a woman’s life, there was a time to have babies and a time when not to become pregnant. They knew both male and female contraception.The Female HerbIn 1571, Gera rd, writing a fa mous herba l, a lleged ly ca lled t he cha ste tree t he “ fema le herb.”68 Heretofore our focus was on the plant’s effects on male reproduction in ritual, myth, and medicine. The banner headline is males’ use of the chaste tree (wittingly or unwittingly), but it probably affected more women than men histor-ically. Gerard wrote: “The decoction of the herbe and seede is good against paine and inf lammations about the matrix, if women be caused to sit and bathe their privy parts therein; the seed being drunk with Pennyroyal bringethe downe the menses.”69In 2003 Christopher Hobbs issued the second edition of his small, well- documented book entitled: Vitex: The Women’s Herb.70 In a brief excursus in the 9780230610644ts07.indd 1239780230610644ts07.indd 12312/7/2009 3:12:32 PM12/7/2009 3:12:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches124plant’s history, Hobbs said that the chaste tree’s popularity waned in the early eigh-teenth century; the return of medicinal uses for the tree came after the researches of Gerhard Madaus in the 1930s in Germany. Madaus patented an extract made from the dried fruit berries that he called Agnolyt®. Most clinical and laboratory stud-ies of the tree’s actions employed the Agnolyt preparation. Using Agnolyt, several studies in the 1950s found that the chaste tree stimulates lactation.71 These studies confirmed what the writer of the Hippocratic work On the Diseases of Women wrote approx imately 2,400 to 2,300 yea rs ago when t he aut hor singled out cha ste tree fruit for the lactation action.72Modern researchers find that in a three-month therapeutic period the chaste tree has a “strong rate of success” regarding various menstrual bleeding disorders: amenorrhea, hypermenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea. The German Commission “E” approved the use of chaste-tree berries for menstrual irregularities, PMS, and mas-todynia (neuralgia of the breast).73 Significantly, the studies are of human subjects. Some thirty-two clinical studies between 1943 and 1997 attest to the chaste tree’s medicinal qualities.74 One double-blinded study showed significant effects of the cha ste tree. Women having ta ken t he cha ste pla nt showed a n “ in hibitor y to pitu ita r y prolactin and therefore beneficial for the treatment of premenstrual mastodynia” when compared to those on a placebo.75 Mastodynon® N is a German proprietary drug containing a preparation of the chaste tree. In 1998 Mastodynon was admin-istered to ninety-six women (36 of whom suffered from secondary amenorrhoea; 37 with luteal insufficiency; 27 with idiopathic infertility). Women treated over a three-month period showed improvement with amenorrhoea or luteal insufficiency, and pregnancy occurred at twice the rate of the placebo group.76The chaste-tree plant is especially effective for PMS linked to abnormally high estrogen levels. Scientists hypothesize that the plant acts on the pituitary gland for chemical signals to balance female sex hormones.77 Heinrich von Staden’s study of the chaste plant’s use in the works attributed to Hippocrates is in line with mod-ern studies. A number of prescriptions are given for various womb disorders and menstrual problems, especially those associated with vaginal discharges (bleeding). Three examples from Diseases of Women II: “If blood f lows violently from the uterus, leaves of chaste tree with dark wine . . . .”; “If the lower abdomen aches because of a watery f lux, grind up chaste tree in honey and apply it nicely as a poultice”; “When worms occur in a woman’s genitals . . . a mixture is made of the fruit or leaves or the chaste tree.” The last prescription was for a restoration of menstrual regularity to promote fertility where we assume that “worms” may be interpreted by us as mean-ing a disorder.78Dioscorides wrote,It [chaste tree] draws down milk and it brings on the menses when a quantity of one drachma is drunk with wine; but it also slackens the organ of generation, and it affects the head inducing deep sleep. The decoction of the plant itself and of its fruit helps in sitz baths for conditions and inf lammations of the uterus.79In Dioscorides and the Hippocratic works, the means of address varied from ingestion, vaginal suppositories, and epidermal application.9780230610644ts07.indd 1249780230610644ts07.indd 12412/7/2009 3:12:32 PM12/7/2009 3:12:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"125The Chaste TreeSoranus, the writer in Greek on gynecology, spoke about the chaste tree’s effects on male and female bodies with, as expected, more attention given to women. Soranus was writing about a woman’s disease whose symptom is the “f lux of semen [seed] . . . in women.” In antiquity there was a debate over whether women produced “seed.” Aristotle, among others, argued that only men produced seed and, when deposited in the womb, could be accepted or rejected by a woman’s body. If accepted, the woman’ body supplied nourishment to produce the offspring but not seed (which would make her more of an equal partner). Other ancients, including some of the Hippocratic writers and Soranus, believed that women’s bodies produced seed nec-essary for conception, thereby subtly elevating women’s status. Exactly what f lux of the woman’s seed meant in corresponding modern medicine’s nosonomy escapes my ability. Soranus was guided by the Methodist School of medicine, which classified symptoms under such terms as contraction, restriction, wasting, condensing, and loosening. In part, he describes this disease and its therapy asThe f lux of semen [gonorrhoia] occurs not only in men, but in women too. It is a dis-charge of seed [sperma] without desire or erection [or “tension”] and happens at short intervals, so that the body become pale, loses strength, and is consumed. For little by little the substance [hyle] of the body f lows into the uterus, undergoing a slight change in the morbid organ, as do the tears of people suffering from ophthalmia [inf lamma-tion in the eye]. The disease is usually chronic and belongs to the “lax” kind. [various physical therapies and drugs are described] . . . One should give [her] as a potion one drachma [=approx. 3.4 g.] of the root of winter-cherry [Physalis alkekengi L.], dried in the shade, together with water, or the seed of the chaste tree in like manner or the seed of hemp or rue. . . . One should also avoid all sexual stimulants; thus one should not show her paintings of shapely form nor tell erotic stories.80A man’s discharge of seed, as stated by Soranus, is likely the suppression of wet dreams as related earlier. Soranus is alleging that the chaste tree and winter-cherry should be taken in addition to a woman’s avoidance of sexual stimulation. Dioscorides recom-mended winter-cherry as good for erysipelas, shingles, lachrymal fistulas, and severe fluxes.81 The Hippocratic author of Women’s Diseases, Dioscorides, and others pre-scribed the chaste plant to stimulate menstruation (Gerard’s “bringethe downe the menses”).82 This action was commonly meant also to cause an abortion if pregnancy were the cause of menstrual interruption. That said, the chaste-tree plant was not prominently mentioned as an abortifacient. Its action historically was more correc-tive of menstrual problems, just as we currently employ it.Hermes, Chaste Tree, and Animal HusbandryIn Greek myth, Hermes was the son of Zeus and the shy, nymph Maia, who lived in a cave where she bore their son. Not an ordinary son, Hermes was called a “rob-ber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the names, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless gods.”83 Hermes’s deeds began during the night of his first day after birth; he rose “cun-ningly” from his crib, miraculously, we would say, and stole some fifty cattle from Apollo’s herd. Cleverly he had their hoofs pointing in opposite direction from which 9780230610644ts07.indd 1259780230610644ts07.indd 12512/7/2009 3:12:33 PM12/7/2009 3:12:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches126he drove them. Upon returning to his cradle in the early morning, his mother had discovered his absence: “You rogue,” she said and told him to report to his father, Zeus. An old shepherd saw the baby Hermes driving “strong” cattle “through many shadowy-mountains and echoing gorges, and f lowery plains.”84 Discovering his cattle missing, Apollo received the testimony of the old shepherd and confronted Hermes, who denied that he was a thief, seeing as how he was only a one-day-old child. At Hermes’s urging, Apollo took the matter to Zeus who heard the evidence. Zeus asked Hermes to take them to where the “strong” cattle were hidden. Seeing his cattle, Apollo feared that, if Hermes had the strength to drive cattle on his first day of life, he would be a danger as he aged; Apollo tied him with chaste-tree bind-ing. The bands would not hold him but fell to the ground and began growing to “cover all the wild-roving cattle.”85 Apollo’s astonishment was tempered by delight when Hermes handed him a lyre with which Apollo instinctively produced song, the lyre becoming Apollo’s symbol. Gladly did Apollo exchange his cattle for the lyre. Hermes said, “But I, o Far-Worker, will graze the filed-dwelling cattle on the pastures of the mountain and on the horse-feeding plain where the cows, mounted by the bulls, will give birth abundantly in both females and males.”86 The Greeks and Romans regarded Hermes as the father of animal husbandry, responsible for livestock reproduction, “the keeper of cattle.”87Other classical sources provide abundant evidence that Hermes was the father of animal husbandry. For examples,She [ Hek ate] is good in t he by re wit h Hermes to increa se t he stock.

Guide to Greece. 2. 3. 4 (W.H. J. Jones, trans. 1: 261).As we have found ancient myths are built on a kernel of truth. Hermes did not steal the god’s cattle, but he separated them, bound them with the chaste tree, and multiplied their reproduction. Breeding is the core to animal husbandry, by both increasing fertility and selection of animals for breeding. Learning from the story, Hermes knew the secret of the chaste tree, and he applied it. He may have fed it to cows and other female livestock to increase their fertility, since we have modern evi-dence that it aids menstrual problems and increases fertility. He may have fed it to bulls and male livestock to thwart the fertility of those animals that he did not wish to have progeny. How this skill was applied escapes notice in the meager records about ancient rural life. Reasonably, it is too much of a coincidence not to recognize the tie between the founder of animal husbandry and the chaste plant.

A lthough the chaste tree accounted for only a small part of the lecture, when the lecture con-cluded a number of students gathered around the podium, as one student asked, and others nodded in approval: “Where can we find this chaste tree?” Thinking that underlying their question was the wish to control the “gentlemen callers” by actions opposite to those of Viagra, I equivocated and replied, correctly, that it grew in the State arboretum. Its bark and leaves were safe in the garden, I thought. Even though sufficient modern science studies support the plant’s action as employed in antiquit y, its use as a pharmaceutical (or nutritional supplement) needs more human clinical studies before one can advocate its revival. The college women were not told that the small tree also, as it happened, grew beside the front door of their science building where the lecture was held. The knowledge about the chaste tree was once a part of popular culture and its stories embedded in their religion. Why is it that the modern, well-educated women in botany were unaware of its historical and pharmaceutical legacy? The answer of a lost heritage will be addressed in the final chapter. Also, we shall have Hermes reappear, reborn as a god with powers dwarfing his cattle-stealing deeds, phenomenal though they were, when we consider that he was at the time only one day old. Hermes learned quickly the chaste tree’s powers.9780230610644ts07.indd 1279780230610644ts07.indd 12712/7/2009 3:12:34 PM12/7/2009 3:12:34 PM"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Chapter 6Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and WitchesTruly, whoever knows how to do these things [alchemical preparation] would have the perfect medicine (medicinam), which the philosophers called the elixir.—Roger Bacon, Opus Minor, 314.Hermes, the young god who rounded up Apollo’s cattle on his very first day of life, was destined to have a long life, longer and more renowned than most pagan gods or goddesses, even Inanna. Hermes went to Egypt and there morphed into a secret-knowing, slow-releasing-of-information god: he acquired knowledge, a prerequi-site many theologians of antiquity would say for divinity. Hermes’s knowledge just was not omniscient knowledge but facts on how to do things. Practical knowledge was a diversion of the intellect according to Plato and many tenets of classical philosophy. In Greek, Hieroglyphs, Hieratic, Latin, Arabic, and the vernacular languages of the Middle Ages, the secrets of Hermes Trimegistus (“Hermes Thrice Great”) stimulated a line of thought that combined with the Chinese concept of an elixir to produce a distinctively Western attitude about drugs. The new way of thinking was substantially different from that of the classical Greeks and Romans. The powers inherent in the pomegranate, mandrake, artemisia, and chaste-tree plants turned toward a new direction. The course was diverted, because its asso-ciation with magic caused them to appear as black or evil magic. The herbs sacred to Inanna, Aphrodite, Demeter, Artemis, and Hermes came to be associated with witches and nefarious forces and not with goddesses (and, in Hermes’s case, a god). Remember: the first witch was Lilith, who made a home in the trunk of the pomegranate tree, thereby robbing Inanna of her power. The secret knowledge had to be suppressed and, largely, it was. This chapter explores the three forces that turned the herbs of goddesses into those of the devil. Simultaneously and ironically developments over a long period of time gave us the hope for miraculous cures, divorced from pagan gods or the God of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The three streams of developments were Hermetic literature, the concept of the elixir, and witchcraft.9780230610644ts08.indd 1299780230610644ts08.indd 12912/7/2009 3:12:52 PM12/7/2009 3:12:52 PM"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches130Thrice-Great HermesTreatises ascribed to Hermes are often referred to as the Corpus Hermetica, but “cor-pus” or “body” is applied to those works only from the classical period. Unlike the Hippocratic Corpus, most of which was written in a little more than a century, the Hermetic works span many centuries ranging from antiquity through the sixteenth century. Conventionally, however, most scholars refer to the Corpus Hermetica as those works written in antiquity until the late Roman period.1 The anonymous and pseudo-anonymous authors of these works had diverse backgrounds and interests, and wrote in various languages. Nevertheless, like the Hippocratic works, there are a few characteristics that underlie virtually all of the works: they have no identifiable religious home, excepting perhaps in obscured ancient Egyptian religion. Pagan, Jew, Christian, and Muslim alike considered the works their own; the writings transcend other religions but have traces of Egyptian and Greek thought with an element of practicality built on philosophical underpinnings; they profess to be “secrets” whose utility must be guarded by their readers, the restricted few. The contents include herbs, stones, animals, sigils (magical signs), alchemy, and astronomy/astrology.In the Middle Ages, people were clearer about the origins of the Hermetic writ-ings than ancient people who mixed classical and Egyptian sources. According to medieval beliefs, Hermes was the messenger of the gods; he was the conveyer of information. He went to Egypt, married the daughter of the Pharaoh, learned the secrets of the Egyptians, and deposited them in the library, presumably the one in Alexandria. When the library burned, the secrets of Hermes were lost except for a few pieces of text that somehow survived. During the first millennium of our era and through the sixteenth century, these treatises circulated because of their pop-ularity. One who discovers a part of the secrets may divulge the secret therein to a few. Those few must keep the information confidential lest by becoming known to common people (vulgarized), the secrets lose their power.Ancient HermeticaThe early Hermetic works were in circulation by the first century of our era; from the third century BCE, Hermes was said to be their author. Scholarly study detects that the early treatises’ contents were derived partly from ancient Greek works but predominantly from ancient Egyptian priestly lore. Hermes and his Egyptian coun-terpart, Thoth, melded into one.2 Thoth was the tongue and heart of Ra, the princi-pal Egyptian god, and, as such, stood beside him and was his spokesman, similar to a messenger. Thoth was responsible for writing, magic, the mathematical and gram-matical sciences, and was the judge of the dead. He kept the list of each person’s good and evil deeds. Hermes succeeded Thoth, even though the works attributed to Hermes are more Egyptian than Greek, in a way reminiscent of a paraphrase from Horace: “Captive Egypt captured its captive.”3 The Egyptian priesthoods studied geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and medicine. Two kinds of knowledge are acces-sible to humans: epistēmē (concrete, specific data, sometimes too loosely translated as “science”) and gnosis (knowledge derived from logos or pure reasoning supplemented by understanding related to faith but not its synonym).4 Humans approach God (or the gods) through knowledge. Such Gnostic sentiments were not alien in Hebrew 9780230610644ts08.indd 1309780230610644ts08.indd 13012/7/2009 3:12:53 PM12/7/2009 3:12:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"131Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesthought. “Wisdom found no place where she could dwell, and her dwelling was in heaven;” so read 1 Enoch 42: 1 (Pseudepipgrapha); Proverbs 3: 13–14: “Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding, for gain from it is better than gain from silver and its profits better than gold.”Gnostic ideas strongly pervaded Hermetic philosophy: a virtuous person moved from ignorance to gnosis (revealed knowledge) but encountered a danger, since some knowledge could lead to evil purpose.5 Virtuous people seeking knowledge had to apply it in a correct, beneficial way. One Greek Hermetic text reads in translation: “The vice of the soul is lack of knowledge (gnosis). A soul that has gained no knowl-edge of the things that are, and has not come to know their nature, nor to know the Good, is but blind. . . . On the other hand, the virtue of the soul is knowledge. He who has got knowledge is good and pious; he is already divine.”6 Knowledge is delivered indirectly, as Hermes explains in a treatise known as Aesclepius (13): “Many make philosophy hard to understand, and corrupt it with manifold specula-tions . . . in this way, by a cunning sort of study, in which philosophy will be mixed with diverse and unintelligible sciences, such as arithmetic, music, and geometry.”7 To us moderns, any assertion is absurd that arithmetic and geometry are irrational by their nature. We must look deeper into the ancients’s souls. “Earth is irrational; heaven is rational,”8 a work of Hermes explains. The facts (epistēmē) are known through the sciences, but facts enable human reasoning only through divine reve-lation.9 This knowledge is revealed in stages, not at once; when known, knowledge is power (dynamis), the very word used to describe the power of herbs.10 The danger lies in how this knowledge is used: for good or for evil?The direction in which these facts point is toward magic—white or black, good or bad magic. Pliny the Elder said it well:The most fraudulent of arts [magic] has held complete sway throughout the world for many ages. Nobody should be surprised at the greatness of its influence, since alone of the arts it has embraced three others that hold supreme domination over the human mind, and made them subject to itself alone. Nobody will doubt that it first arose from medicine, and that professing to promote health it insidiously advanced under the disguise of a higher and holier system . . . [then] it added the powers of religion.As Pliny implied, medical knowledge was very much a central part of Hermetic works. Clement of Alexandria (d. 215), a Christian father, explained that the books contain “all the wisdom of the Egyptians, [including] treating the constitution of the body, maladies, organs, remedies, the eyes, and questions related to women.”11The power of Hermetic philosophy (called, by Pliny, magic) is through specific knowledge of things bringing us to the divine, not by reason but by revelation. To the classical Greeks, truth was the product of free inquiry; to late antiquity and early medieval peoples, truth was known through the scriptures and revelation. Written to an unspecified king, one Hermetic work dismissed Greek philosophy, but ironi-cally, the author used the Greek language for his dismissal:The secrets so holy may not be revealed to Greeks, and that the Greek mode of speech, with its [lacuna: “arrogance” or “disdainfulness”?] and feebleness, and showy strength of language and cogent force of the words. For the speech of the Greeks, my King, is 9780230610644ts08.indd 1319780230610644ts08.indd 13112/7/2009 3:12:53 PM12/7/2009 3:12:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches132devoid of power to convince; and the Greek philosophy is nothing but a noise of talk. But our [wisdom of Hermes] speech is not mere talk; it is an utterance replete with workings.12A modern scholar, Garth Fowden, wrote: “The magician’s potential power [from knowing the secrets] was considered to be unlimited, certainly equivalent to that of the gods, . . . the corollary of the Egyptians’ belief in the dynamism of words and spells.”13 Some Hermetic works contain specific and detailed information whereby one may learn nature’s secrets, which in turn can be harnessed for application. One Hermetic work disparaged the Greeks as engaging in “inane foolsophy of speeches [while] we [possessors of wisdom], by contrast, use not speeches but sounds that are full of action.”14 Thus, it is through knowledge of “things” and “action” that we approach God. In explaining this, Stobaeus, a Byzantine Christian of the fifth cen-tury, said: He who knows these things “is able to form an exact conception of God; nay, if I am able to speak boldly, he is able to see God with his own eyes, and having seen God, to be blest.”15 Artapan, a Jewish writer in Greek (early second century BCE), explained the practical knowledge as coming from the Egyptians through a combined name of Thoth-Hermes: “[Thoth-Hermes] taught the Egyptians [about] navigation, the lifting of stones with cranes, weapons, water pumps, war machines, and philosophy.”16 Much of the Hermetica, especially those treatises known and perhaps written in the medieval period, is about practical subjects, the secrets of nature, but the information is related vaguest and a certain amount of purpose-ful obscurity. Explicit acknowledgment of the obscurity was outlined in a letter in Greek from Asclepius (Hermes’ friend) to King Ammon:My teacher, Hermes—often speaking to me in private, sometimes in the presence of Tat—used to say that those reading my books would find their organization very sim-ple and clear when, on the contrary, it is unclear and keeps the meaning of the words concealed; furthermore, it will be entirely unclear (he said) when the Greek eventually desire to translate our language to their own and thus produce in writing the greatest distortion and unclarity.17The Hermetic works were not “Herbal Medicine for Dummies.” While trying to understand a Hermetic work on herbs, minerals, or alchemy in medicine, I liken Hermetica authors to writers of computer manuals. The authors really do not want me to understand everything (or else I would know what they knew), and so they deliberately leave out a step or two, perhaps assuming that I might know it intui-tively. Alas, I am not the equal of a computer programmer.On the Fifteen Stars, Fifteen Stones, Fifteen Herbs, and Fifteen SigilsIn researching Hermetic works, I found in European manuscript collections a num-ber of manuscripts attributed to Hermes on the fifteen stars, stones, herbs, and sigils (or engraved images). Each star has a secret the author’s treatise will disclose, although not explicitly. Similarly, each star has a specific herb and stone, which the star has impressed on the plant or mineral. Each has a secret, a power which, when 9780230610644ts08.indd 1329780230610644ts08.indd 13212/7/2009 3:12:53 PM12/7/2009 3:12:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"133Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesknown, will benefit its reader. The treatises or sections of treatises on herbs have the familiar medicinal uses, many of which are to us rational, but also each herb can produce effects that we would classify as magic. Similarly with stones: a diamond is “indomitable” and cannot be broken and, for this reason, it is the wedding stone; jasper prevents conception by keeping its wearer from licentiousness; sapphire over-comes envy; chalcedony causes its bearer to win causes; and emerald, when worn, makes one’s words persuasive. Most of the stones’ powers fall under what we would call psychological. Some powers are magic, such as the emerald, which also permits one to foretell the future. The proper stone can control almost any emotion; one stone (whose name will be purposefully omitted) causes a speaker (as in a class-room) to stop talking, a secret that I shall keep to myself. Each herb and stone has a corresponding astrological sign or constellation that impresses its virtues on earthly artifacts. Finally, each herb, stone, and star corresponds to a sign engraved on stone. Initially in looking at these images, I thought them merely scribal scratches, because I could detect neither letter nor animate object. In time, it occurred to me that the signs appear to be a medieval scribe’s attempt to reproduce cuneiform, except that the characters are reversed, as on a signet ring, to produce a cuneiform word.18 Although predominantly ancient and medieval authors of Hermetica assigned the credit for the ancient knowledge as coming from the Egyptians, nevertheless, the “Chaldeans” or ancient Mesopotamians are credited with some of the “secrets.”19 At least some of the information imbedded in this treatise appears to have come from the Mesopotamians.Importance of HermeticaGod has placed in each plant, stone, and star a secret that, when discovered, will be of use to humans. “God will come to meet you,” Hermes stated.20 God, all-powerful to be sure, was virtually synonymous with matter or nature. “This material God, the Kosmos,” Tat said to Hermes.21 And, in a discourse addressed to Hermes: “All things are in God.”22 In a prayer: “O holy Knowledge [dynameis, pl. used], by thee am I illumined.”23 God has placed in humans the potentiality for dynamis [s.], per-haps better translated as “power” or, even better yet, the “potentiality for power.”24 The Hymn concludes with enegeia tōn dynameōn <mou>, or, when one’s dynameis (powers of knowledge) operate, it is God who operates them.25 “For by the working of the mind, you have come to know yourself and our Father.”26 One should not conclude that this is pure pantheism, because it is not. The cosmos had a creator: God, who was greater than his creation. God gave to humans the power of knowl-edge if they were smart enough to learn, understand, and use it. Earlier historians championed Sir Francis Bacon as a founder of the Scientific Revolution when he proclaimed: “Knowledge is power/ Scientia potentia est.” His proclamation was not new. At least a millennium earlier than Bacon, the Hermetic works had asserted that knowledge was power. The essential feature is that knowledge was for utility, the benefactor of humankind.The period of late antiquity and the Middle Ages regarded the knowledge of medicinal herbs as a power given to them by God, but the herbs’ secrets had to be discovered. All things have secrets that, when known, are of benefit to humans. 9780230610644ts08.indd 1339780230610644ts08.indd 13312/7/2009 3:12:54 PM12/7/2009 3:12:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches134Herbal knowledge, as all knowledge, could benefit the knower both physically and spiritually. This view of knowledge was in sharp contrast to classical philos-ophy. Greek philosophers (e.g., Heraclitus, Plato, and Aristotle) sought knowledge (logos, or “pure reason”) in order to grasp the Absolute and to understand themselves through an inquiring mind (“Know Thyself”), and never to better their material being. Fired by the existence of Hermetic secrets, the medieval mind sought knowl-edge, but, in a basic departure from the ancient mind, medieval peoples blurred the distinction between science (“natural philosophy,” to them) and magic. Magic was a means of getting nature to act unnaturally by a suspension of regular laws. Hermes “Thrice-Great” proclaimed that, through magic, one could obtain wisdom, which is the ability to perform miracles. In 1493 Germain de Ganay received a reply from Hermes himself in answer to some questions. Hermes said,Study generates knowledge; knowledge bears love; love, likeness; likeness, commu-nion; communion, virtue; virtue, dignity; dignity, power; and power performs the miracle. This is the unique path to the goal of magic perfection, divine as well as natural, from which all superstitious and diabolical wizardry is totally separated and confounded.27God was approached through magic, not superstition, because superstition comes from the devil. In bits and pieces, the medieval mind wanted to know practical details of how to manipulate nature, not conform to it. The Hippocratic physician wanted to learn the ways of nature so that he could help nature perform the heal-ing process. By the thirteenth century, the medieval medical personnel no longer referred to themselves as medici, because they were physici, or, in English, “physi-cians.” They sought to be “controllers of nature,” and not the Hippocratic assis-tant or enabler of nature. Nothing can be a more optimistic proclamation than that learning practical detail made life easier for the virtuous people, for example, how to plow better a field, to make a better loom, or to discover the good and bad power of Artemisia. Once learned, these practical “secrets” were propelling vir-tuous people in the direction of God. No wonder this optimism drove away the shades of ancient gods. A great gap opened between the medieval mind and the ancient mind: the ancients were informed of the herbs sacred to the goddesses who bestowed benefits, if their rituals were performed and acknowledgment made of the gifts from the divine. Medieval peoples were given the potentiality of knowledge by God; they could on their own merits discover the medicinal secrets, since that was God’s will. God placed those secrets within each herb and stone so that they might be discovered.ElixirsThe concept of elixirs came from the ancient Chinese, not from the ancient Egyptians or the Mesopotamians. In China, as in the Hermetic works, there is a close connec-tion between alchemy and medicine. The big difference was that in China the con-cept that special substances could bring immortality or, at least, prolonged youth. There was the “external elixir” known as wai tan that controlled vital substances 9780230610644ts08.indd 1349780230610644ts08.indd 13412/7/2009 3:12:54 PM12/7/2009 3:12:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"135Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witcheswith emphases on metals and drugs. The corresponding elixir concept was nei tan or the “inner elixir,” which engaged the body physically and mentally through its energies (e.g., seminal essence, meditation, and breathing).28 Through the out-ward and inner spirit a person could achieve an elixir that could prolong youth for decades, some said a thousand years, or, according to other Chinese accounts, mate-rial immortality. The process was purification of the external and/or inner elixirs. The concept evolved from Chinese philosophy and religion, but over time, emphasis turned from the mental aspects (“a comprehensive regimen of mental and physical disciplines”)29 to the actual process of how to discover the external elixir itself. As conceptualized in Islamic and Christian worlds of the medieval periods, the key was the so-called Philosopher’s stone, which was not a stone as such but resembled a stone insofar as fire could not touch it.30Fire was what caused transmutation; the elixir was (to be?) a product of the stove’s transformative powers. Some Chinese regarded a goddess of the Stove as the spiri-tual guide; she was pictured as a beautiful old woman in red dress, her hair knotted on top of her head. She was the inspiration for alchemy. The Emperor Süan (ca. 60 BCE) was intrigued by the prospect of obtaining the (or an) elixir for immortality: to do this, he made sacrifices to the five sacred mountains, the last one of which was medicine. Intrigue turned to greed when the emperor was informed that the magi-cians (alchemists, as it were), who could transmute substances and obtain the elixir, could also make gold. The concept of such a possibility as immortality, youth, and abundant riches with gold traveled widely and for an extended period. In American history we know of its legacy through, for example, Ponce de Leon’s search for the Fountain of Youth in what is now St. Augustine, Florida. Between Florida and the Chinese elixir much happened to transform the way we think about drugs.George Sarton, the founder of the history of science in the United States, said that historians should exclude magic and superstition from their researches because they concern nonreason, and science was about reason.31 Historians today reject Sarton’s methodology. Whereas today rational science considers the elixir of life as magic and superstition at worse, fanciful and extravagant at best, the concept influ-enced early medical science immeasurably.From China the concept of the “elixir of life,” known in Latin as elixir vitae, captured the imagination of the Indians. In the Tantric Period (1300–1550 CE) of Indian medicine, the medical works of the Charaka and Susruta were filled with recipes, predominantly herbal, many of which we might judge “rational.” Over decades extending to centuries, preparations appeared that were the products of the alchemists’s ovens and vials. They included recipes that contained mercury, iron, copper, and other metals. Acharya Rây, a scholar of ancient India’s alchemy, said of these recipes: “Although they could [allegedly] secure immortality [and] revive the dead, [they] were found to be helpful accessories in medicine.”32Islamic cultures took the elixir concept to a higher level of attention or, better, infatuation. First, the word elixir is of Arabic derivation from “al,” as a definite arti-cle, before iksīr. The etymology may be an Arabic corruption from the late Greek xērion, a desiccative powder possibly at first to treat wounds, but its etymology is uncertain. The Arabs adopted the word elixir from the Chinese concept into a def-inition that revolved around two meanings: (1) a preparation used to change metals 9780230610644ts08.indd 1359780230610644ts08.indd 13512/7/2009 3:12:54 PM12/7/2009 3:12:54 PM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches136into gold and virtually interchangeable with philosopher’s stone; (2) a medicine or drug capable of prolonging life, or even preventing death. The double meaning was, directly or indirectly, related to the bifurcated Chinese concept.As Hippocrates’s name was applied to a corpus or body of medical writings, so also was a corpus of more than 2,000 treatises attributed to Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan (ca. 721–ca. 815) that circulated in Latin translations under the name of Geber, for Jabir. So far the task of separating the genuine Jabir from the pseudo-Jabir has escaped our scholarship. Although some attention was given to gold manufac-ture and the medicinal elixir, most Jabirean works were practical, such as how to make glazes, tannins, dyes, and waterproofing for cloth.Alchemy was embraced and celebrated in the Latin West and Greek East from information derived both from translated works from Arabic and ancient Greek but also later Roman and medieval alchemical writers galore in Latin and various vernac-ular languages. The strongest, most eloquent spokesperson for the new science—for science it was called—was Roger Bacon (d. 1294), a Franciscan. He wrote: “Truly, whoever knows how to do these things [alchemical preparation] would have the perfect medicine (medicinam), which the philosophers called the elixir.”33 Medicines “have no power without fermentation. . . . This is a secret of secrets of which the gen-erality of physicians is completely ignorant.”34 Proper (meaning effective) medicines are not simply the sum of their parts (herbs, minerals, etc.) but need to undergo a fermentation process, according to Bacon. The necessity for medical study is to master alchemy, astronomy, and agricultura philosophica. The latter is achieved by specific or particular knowledge of things gained “by way of experience”; it is “the power of recognizing the simple medicines derived from plants and animals.”35 These three sciences certify all conclusions of natural philosophy per experimentiam.36 In viewing Bacon’s remarks from our distance in time, it would seem to be strikingly modern as when he spoke of scientia experimentalis,37 but this conclusion is not merited. By embracing the mysteries of the elixir and alchemy, Bacon and numerous other natural philosophers through the sixteenth century moved the pharmaceuti-cal empirical science of antiquity to the realm of mysterious quasi-magic, all in the name of “science” as they understood science to be.Living at the same time as Bacon and dying a year later than Bacon, a Bolognese physician named Taddeo Alderotti (d. 1295) was enthusiastic about the new medi-cines made from distilled wine (aqua vitae) mixed with various herbs which were “of inestimable glory, the mother and mistress of all medicine.”38 Muslim alchemists invented distillation and thereby made a spiritus advance (pun intended) through-out Europeans’ gullets and into their medicine cabinets as well. These “wondrous” medicines, Alderotti proclaimed, were useful for melancholy (“makes one happy”), weak eyesight, epilepsy, paralysis, deafness, and cleaning wonders.39Elixir and Garden of EdenIn Christian beliefs, the elixir concept was connected to the Garden of Eden and the Fall of Humans. The serpent, the “most subtle of creatures,” told Eve and, through her, Adam, that if she ate of the Tree of Knowledge, the two of them would not die and would be, thereby, immortal.40 The tradition became—because it was not implicit in the Genesis account—that the serpent was the instrument of the devil or 9780230610644ts08.indd 1369780230610644ts08.indd 13612/7/2009 3:12:55 PM12/7/2009 3:12:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"137Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesevil personified. Why had the devil so acted?: because he, feeling himself inferior to God, wanted to alienate God from his created beings, Adam and Eve.41 Paracelsus saw alchemy as the means of extending long life and, even though he is regarded as one of founders of modern science, Paracelsus spoke of “magic” and elixirs. “We see the age of Adam and Methuselah, with whom the art of magic began,” he wrote, so that the new magic of alchemy (“the way of preserving long life”) can restore humans to where once Adam and Eve were in the Garden.42Wonder DrugsDuring the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the notion of a possible elixir fired people’s imaginations; from this line of thought developed the idea of won-der drugs, just as Alderotti proclaimed. In the thirteenth century and for centu-ries thereafter, Galenic pharmaceutical theory gradually was employed both to explain drug actions and to determine theoretically drug administration. Galen proposed a medical concept that was compatible with the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian-Empedoclean cosmic notions about matter and its behavior. Any substance is potentially a drug because of its composition unless it was one of few substances that were inert or neutral because of a perfect balance of qualities. Substances had active (either warming or cooling) and passive (either moistening or drying) qualities. A physician’s task is to restore balance to the four humors constitut-ing the body’s chemistry. Why is it that a minuscule amount of a drug has lit-tle effect, and when one increases the amount and frequency, then the desired effects increase? The increase, however, is only to a point. At that point, increased amounts and their frequencies have deleterious effects. We use the term dosage to explain the observation. According to Galen (who probably was relating an explanation already current among practitioners in his time), each substance has the potential for one of four degrees of activity, for moisture and temperature con-trol. Thus, for example, a fever needs a cooling medicine. An infant might have a higher fever but should be given a lesser amount, whereas a fever in an old person is more threatening and requires a stronger response. Responses are not singular, because the fever-reducing drug would also have one of four degrees of activity to be either moistening or drying. If a fever were wet (sweats), one would need a counterdrying drug. If the drug selected were also moistening, a counterdrug would have to be administered to balance the hydration factor.43 The complexity in prescribing drugs had the cumulative effect of producing compound drugs with elaborate, mathematically balanced qualities. The growth of compound drugs had an appealing factor that made these mixtures economically gainful to apothecar-ies. Medicine was less the kitchen herb garden but now bottles sold in apothecary shops in the precursor to our patent drugs.The wonder-drug concept developed as a response to the complexity of Galenic-drug theory and the idea that there were special substances that could act in a wondrous way to cure virtually every disease and even to control emotions and protect one from harm. The nearest synonym in modern parlance is “silver bullet” (or, variant, “miracle drug”), that is a drug that pathologically cures an intractable disease and, hopefully, pleasantly as well. Francis B. Brévart of the University of Pennsylvania recently studied the “wonder drugs” primarily in German medical 9780230610644ts08.indd 1379780230610644ts08.indd 13712/7/2009 3:12:55 PM12/7/2009 3:12:55 PM"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches138and pharmaceutical treatises. Brévart observed that these wonder drugs also pos-sessed occult forces.44 Wonder drugs combined therapeutic and occult virtues in much the same way as the elixir concept. The difference was one of degree between the two (wonder drugs and elixirs): a wonder drug had specific targeted effects on disease, maladies, and demonic spirits; an elixir extended life in a mysterious way with or without specificity of actions. Even so, Brévart observed: There was “a firm belief in supernatural powers now rendered these objects capable of fulfilling a multiplicity of functions.”45 The concept of wonder drugs was not confined to the elite of natural philosophers who speculated on the nature of things. Brévart’s study looked at the “house books” that were popular guides to daily living. Why should they not be appealing? One with a debilitating, life-threatening disease where the local pharmacy was of no use would grasp at the possibility that there was a drug that potentially cured what ailed him. Do we not do this even today?Artemisia as Example of Wonder DrugThe plant called artemisia or mugwort in our common parlance is a wonder-drug example, all the more so because of its connection with Diana or Artemis. The immensely popular German work Gart der Gesundheit/ “Garden of Health” (Mainz 1485) by Johann Wonnecke von Kaub related mugwort’s pharmaceutical, magical, and apotropaic qualities, all mixed together in a wondrous way. Wonnecke gave as its synonym “Mater herbarum/ Mother herb” and traced its name to King Mausolus’ wife, but he also included Isidore of Seville’s assertion that the plant was consecrated to Diana “by the pagans.”46 Francis B. Brévart observed: “Wonnecke’s introduction of Artemis (Diana), the goddess of childbirth and fertility, the protectress of women, at the onset of the treatise would serve to instill all the more confidence in the vir-tues of this magiferous herb about to be enumerated.”47 Wonnecke related well the medicinal values for the plant as he received them from his classical and medical sources, but there is a greater emphasis on the wondrous or magical qualities. For example, Wonnecke wrote: “Dioscorides, once again, in his chapter on artemisia informs us that an individual using mugwort cannot be harmed by poisons or sor-cery, nor can be injured by the bite of a sick animal.”48 He stretched Dioscorides, who said that, drunk with wine, mugwort is an antidote for deadly poisons and an application with olive oil for “shiverers.” It could be used in a litter or as a fumigant to chase away serpents and, when drunk with wine, it protects against poisonous spiders and scorpions.49 Wonnecke’s rendering of Dioscorides conveys the impres-sion that mere possession of the plant protected one from poisons.50 This inference is made stronger by the two passages that say: “[9] Also, whoever keeps mugwort inside his house will not suffer any damage from the devil. [10] And whoever suspends mugwort root from the neck will not suffer any injury from a venomous animal. And if such an animal has already attacked him, let him drink mugwort juice, and he will regain his health momentarily.”51 Also claiming Dioscorides as his source, Wonnecke said that one who carries mugwort will not have fatigue or, if one hangs it over his house’s threshold, he will be protected from harm.52 Dioscorides’s Greek text has no such claims, but a number of pseudo-Dioscoridean texts circulated in the Middle Ages. To be noted is that Wonnecke neither made an explicit tie of 9780230610644ts08.indd 1389780230610644ts08.indd 13812/7/2009 3:12:56 PM12/7/2009 3:12:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"139Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesmugwort to an astrological sign that would be expected in a Hermetic-inspired work nor did he have favorable calendar times or a ritual for harvesting the plant. One of Wonnecke’s sources, the Middle High German Macer floridus, gave instructions that leaves should be cut downward, in what we suppose was a magic belief that the downward cut would produce the downward effect for menstrual problems, thus its “signature.”53 Female cures and treatments account for the high plurality of phar-maceutical benefits. The numerous listings of artemisia’s medicinal qualities, most with a basis in fact as we know them, were combined with these mystical (magic and apotropaic) qualities to produce a wonder drug, one that cut through the restrictions of nature imposed by the limitations of mere matter composed of water, earth, fire, and air. Herbs once connected with the gods broke the bonds of nature’s laws.Witches, Witchcraft, and DrugsFrom the fourteenth through the seventeenth century in Europe and America approximately one-half million people, more than 80 percent women, were burned at the stake as witches. Some few of the accused were exonerated, after confession under torture. Most were not. Wrestling with a complexity of questions, historians pose these questions: were these witches “really witches,” or was the phenomenon of witchcraft suppression a cruel hoax visited upon innocent people whose only weak-ness was confession to witchcraft practices because of the dreaded agony of torture? The weight of the evidence supports an answer: at least some people believed them-selves to be witches. This thesis moves us to the next question: what do we mean by a witch? Lilith, the old woman who made her home in the bough of the huluppu tree, was considered to have been the first witch. Later, she was depicted in Sumerian art as a barren old woman with wings and taloned hands and feet; standing beside her were owls and lions (see figure 6.1). The owl symbol refers to her snatching babies at night. Also she seduced men while they slept and drank thereafter of their blood. To the Jews, she was (see chapter two) Adam’s first wife. Isaiah 34:14 describes the day of vengeance: “The wild-cat shall meet with the jackals. And the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, Lilith [Liyliyth] shall repose there.”54 The Greek Septuagint rendered Liyliyth into onokentamos, meaning “demon,” whereas the Greek Aquila translation was Lilith.55 In Greco-Roman times Lilith was Lamia who lost her children and there-after tore babies from their mothers’ arms.56 Medieval people’s emphasis on Lilith was as a snatcher of babies before baptism, thereby removing neonatals’ possibility of salvation. A German woodcut in 1470 shows Lilith with wings and a serpent tail offering an apple to Eve. This image connects evil with Lilith (partial serpent, baby- snatching) evil, and the fall from Grace, all in one simple scene (see figure 6.2).If witches were Lilith-like spirits, they were assumed to exist. If medieval witches were nothing more than sorcerers, they had existed from antiquity and without interruption through the Western medieval periods. If, on the other hand, witches are defined as engaging in formalized, ritualistic worship of the Devil, the historical controversy becomes muddled and returns to the question: Were all those witchcraft confessions real or perpetrated upon innocent victims through torture? Partially these associations were an outgrowth of the early medieval belief in demons. One tradition regarded demons as fallen angels; the devil fell from grace because he 9780230610644ts08.indd 1399780230610644ts08.indd 13912/7/2009 3:12:56 PM12/7/2009 3:12:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Figure 6.1 Lilith with owls and lions on each side on a Babylonian cult plaque, ca. 1950 BCE.Source: The Burney Relief, The Granger Collection, New York (0017755).9780230610644ts08.indd 1409780230610644ts08.indd 14012/7/2009 3:12:56 PM12/7/2009 3:12:56 PM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"141Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesenvied Adam and his temptation of Eve. Another tradition held that God com-manded angels to worship Adam and, when they refused, they were cast down from heaven. 57 As bodiless spirits they could occupy and possess a human. There were many variations and manifestations of these stories, but the salient point is that from peasants to high churchmen in both Western and Eastern Christendom, many people believed in the existence of demons in their everyday lives. Witchcraft came from the devil’s placing in humans anger and a “desire to do harm,” as stated by Roger Bacon.58The main parameters of a witch-convent ritual, according to confessions went like this: On a Thursday (or Tuesday, with regional differences) a person’s spirit (usually a woman) arose from her bed, rubbed herself with green unguent (often described as foul-smelling) and flew through the window, wall or roof and was transported (often on a stick or broom) to the woods, where others were arriving in similar ways. Naked, they formed a circle linking their arms and facing outward. They danced, and at the height of frenzied dance the devil appeared in the center, where they gave homage (the devil’s kiss, as often stated whose details I shall spare). Then they had a banquet, gave pledges to act in accordance with the devil’s precepts, engaged in an orgy, and returned home just as they had come. Since it was their spirits, not their bodies, that had been thus transported, the testimony of a spouse was immaterial inasmuch as the body remained in bed. In the fifteenth century, a major accusa-tion against witches was that they killed babies and small children; this became a Figure 6.2 Lilith tempting Eve with an apple in the Garden of Eden.Source: Woodcut, German, 1470.

Supposedly some witches could steal into a home at night while parents were asleep and choke the children to death.59 Historians cannot discern from the confessions what true sentiments of the villagers and towns people who allegedly made these claims were.It was not until the sixteenth century that a number of writers, among them herbalists, gave the formula for the green unguent: it consisted of a variety of herbs, those locally available. All of the recipes contained plants, mandrake and/or hem-lock, nightshade, and jimson weed, all with similar chemistries. A sixteenth-century physician in Spain found the formula and tested it on a woman who became coma-tose for more than a day, around thirty-six hours. When she was revived finally after a great scare that she would not recover, she was upset because she was awak-ened from pleasant memories of handsome young men in sexual fantasies. Another physician in France described those women who smeared the ointment over them-selves and remembered later “dancing, handsome young men, and lovemaking of whatever kind they most desire.”60 Atropine, the active compound in mandrake and some other related Solanaceae plants, has a similar effect when administered topically, of a comatose state for a number of hours, some exceeding a twenty-four. The compound in an ointment is most highly absorptive through the vagina and, when administered on a stick (as one might well do), one of the first visions reported by those so treated is flying through the air on sticks.61 Like many hallucinatory drugs, there is an out-of-the-body experience. Johann Weyer (1533) tested the green unguent on himself and argued that witches should be excused for their activities because their fantasies were all attributed to drugs and were not real. His conclu-sions about witchcraft wereThey frequently abuse of the natural remedies which are given to them for their comfort . . . They think they see theatres, beautiful gardens, feasts, beautiful orna-ments, clothes, handsome young men, kings, magistrates, in short, all those things which delight them and which they thus believe themselves to be enjoying; they also see devils, ravens, prisons, deserts, and other torments. They are therefore the causes of violent dreams.62Note that Weyer wrote from the assumption that those who partook of these hallu-cinatory drugs were women.Maxim Weintraub compared witchcraft accounts regarding the green unguent with modern clinical accounts of atropine toxicity (included subcompounds of hyo-scine and hyoscyamine). He concluded thatImplicit within most of these tales is one or more of the following aspects: that the person was asleep, experienced sensations of flight, and often believed that the expe-rience actually occurred. These symptoms are consistent with the twentieth-century clinical description of hyoscine and hyoscyamine toxicity; specifically coma, visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations and the confusion between reality and drug- induced perceptual distortions.63An historian is not justified in concluding that witchcraft was merely a drug culture whose participants’ visions the Inquisitors and other witch suppressors 9780230610644ts08.indd 1429780230610644ts08.indd 14212/7/2009 3:13:04 PM12/7/2009 3:13:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"143Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesmisunderstood. There were too many witnesses to strange rituals in the woods and accounts of witnesses of rituals to counter a theory that witchcraft/devil worship was entirely a matter of minds under drug control. Moreover, one who has mandrake and other related drugs would not have motor skills to enable dance and movements reported by those who saw the rituals.64 One could argue, not persuasively to me from the evidence, that the witnesses were not reliable. There were too many over too long a period with too many variations to be entirely inventive. What transpired at the village level, however, was one thing to the villagers, another to the suppres-sors. We know what the suppressors thought, but finding the voice of the villagers is more difficult.Instruction about witchcraft comes from a work (first published in 1467) by two Dominican monks whose purpose was to instruct magistrates how to identify, question, and convict witches. “What do witches do?” was a question that these monks posed, citing papal authority. First, however, the heading was “What sort of women are found to be above all others superstitious and witches?” Witches’ acts were sevenfold:1. Inclining the minds of men to inordinate passion2. Obstructing the generative force3. Removing “the member” [i.e., the penis] accommodated to that act4. Changing men into beasts by their magic art5. Destroying the generative force in women6. Procuring abortions7. Offering children to the devils.65Of the seven, six are directly linked to reproduction and sex. The chaste tree was, to our knowledge, the only substance that was available, which could produce some of these seven effects. Allegedly, witches tied an invisible ligature (string) around a man’s penis to prevent an erection. Only the chaste tree could produce effects one through three. The last three, five through seven, concern birth control and snatch-ing neonatals before they can be baptized, the alleged act of Lilith. Abortion was explicit, contraception implicit. The monks cite St. Augustine’s City of God (bk. 36) as saying: “Devils are attracted by various kinds of stones, herbs, trees, animals, songs, and instruments of music . . . [and by] spirits by signs.”66 These phenomena (accusation, in this case) are found in Hermetic and alchemical works, albeit, not for demons’ evil purposes. The existence of devils (or demons) pervades the Hermetic works. Witches were accused of enacting “black magic,” that is for evil purposes, not benign ones. Those who argue that men “can work witchcraft through certain herbs and occult causes without the help of devils” are wrong because devils, not men, produce “corporeal effects.” Men who have a “frantic infatuation of love” are beset by a devilish spell. “The natural reason is that she [a woman] is more carnal than a man”: so stated these two fifteenth-century misogynist monks.67The monks gave little detail on what the herbs and stones were but we can easily extrapolate that some were the sex-related herbs we have discussed: mandrake, arte-misia, and chaste tree.68 Specifically the authors pointed to “absinthium” (worm-wood or artemisia) because of its biblical (Proverbs 5:3–4) reference to a “loose 9780230610644ts08.indd 1439780230610644ts08.indd 14312/7/2009 3:13:05 PM12/7/2009 3:13:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches144woman” with speech as “bitter as wormwood.” In the medieval and early-modern periods, the contraceptive use of pomegranates was only occasional throughout the documents. I speculate that the reason was breeding for tastes had to some degree altered the pomegranate chemistry, thereby reducing the most potent estrogenic compounds. There were more effective contraceptive and abortifacient plants, as I recently offered as evidence in another study.69Who knew these herbs of devilish use? It was the “midwives, who surpass all others in wickedness.”70 Generally, also, women cared for the herb gardens, which provided most medical care in families. Throughout antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, women typically received their extra-family health care from midwives as general advisers on medical care. Henry Boguet’s Examen of Witches (in the 1580s) spoke ofthose midwives and wise women who are witches are in the habit of offering to Satan the little children which they deliver, and then of killing them . . . [or] worse; they kill them while they are yet in their mother’s womb. This practice is common to all witches.71Jean Spot, a sixteenth-century alleged witch, knew the “empirical remedies/ reme-dia empirica” but she also knew “magical remedies/ remedia magica.” She practiced a ritual to promote fertility when done in the sun, but, when she went “against the sun,” she had evil intent for her remedies. A women testifying before the Inquisition in Modena (1499) said it succinctly: “Who knows how to heal knows how to destroy.”72 However we view the witchcraft suppressions and attendant hysteria, this much is clear: the persecutions of midwives were not delusions of drug-crazed minds either of those of the midwives or of their persecutors. The persecutions were real, and they served useful purposes, from the perspective of those who per-secuted them. Most who died because of accusations of witchcraft were doubtlessly innocents, but their knowledge of herbs caused their deaths in many, if not most, cases.Why Witchcraft and Herbal Lore SuppressionTwo German scholars, Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger, compiled data that showed that in those areas of Europe where there were virulent witch hunts, there followed a period of population increase.73 Much of late medieval government was through town or municipal government. Guild leaders—for it was they who largely controlled public life—were acutely aware that economic prosperity was linked to growth in town size. Fewer people meant lower rates of income, and the converse. Who were the suspects for lower population growth?: women acting on the advice of midwives. For that reason some towns outlawed the growing and possession of juniper, a widely used early abortifacient, in what was probably the first law by a governmental entity to regulate substance use and possession. The laws did not work: no matter how dedicated the police were, people were industrious enough to hide their juniper bushes. One method worked, if the Heinsohn-Steiger thesis is correct: the extermination of midwives and those who dispensed herbs and advice 9780230610644ts08.indd 1449780230610644ts08.indd 14412/7/2009 3:13:05 PM12/7/2009 3:13:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"145Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witcheson how to use them to curtail fertility and live births resulted in fewer people having the knowledge.Another means of testing the thesis about the link between population and witchcraft suppression comes with the coincidence of chronology. Some historians (e.g., Margaret Murray and Arne Runeberg74) believe medieval witchcraft was a direct descendant of the ancient fertility cults, modified by Christian thought but not substantially changed from its ancient roots. Without doubt, throughout the Middle Ages, even as a continuation from classical antiquity, there were or were thought to be sorcerers and magicians. It was never that people and the Christian churchmen and women did not believe in magic: they accepted on faith the miracles of saints and of divine intervention. Magic for evil purposes was their dread. For example, Gratian, a well-known canon lawyer, wrote around 1140: “Bishops and their officials must labor with all their strength to uproot thoroughly from their parishes the pernicious art of sorcery and malefice invented by the Devil, and, if they find a man or woman follower of this wickedness to eject them foully disgraced from their parishes.”75 The key question for the historian is why, when there were magicians and sorcerers, even those allegedly serving the devil, living throughout the medieval period, did Western Europe change and no longer to tolerate them? In 1320 Pope John XXII instructed a cardinal to have the Inquisition prosecute sorcerers as heretics. Some historians argue that the Inquisition was an institution; others say the term is too precise for a loose organization evolving from the control of bishopric or other ecclesiastical authorities into virtual operational independence. Not until about the 1420s did the Inquisition evolve out of any central control or authority into the terrible oppression of witchcraft.“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,” so read the King James translation of Exodus 22:18. The Latin and Greek bibles used a term meaning “sorceress” or “poi-soner”; the essential point is that this passage was known as God’s word throughout the Middle Ages, yet it was not until the end of the medieval period that the words evoked actions. Why? History provides an answer: In the twelfth century conven-tional Western wisdom held that right reason will bring all to accept God and Jesus as his Son. After more than a hundred fruitless years of crusader armies marching off to the Holy Land, the few returning reported that the Saracens held to the Prophet, not Jesus, and would not convert by persuasion. Europe faltered in asserting that reason would bring all people to the same conclusions. Also, the Westerners saw the Muslims as a threat largely because of their numbers. They knew two things: Muslim men could have multiple wives and many children. After the depression beginning in the 1320s and cataclysmic debacle of the Black Death (beginning in 1347 and recurring in episodes thereafter), some Europeans and even theologians argued that Christians should drop their monogamy for self-preservation. Whereas the early Christian Church emphasized virginity and chastity, the late medieval Church entertained policies to enhance population size because of insufficiencies of multiplication.76Witches were seen as those who prevented babies from being born through con-traception, abortion, snatching of non-baptized neonatal babies, causing men to be unable to have an erection (impotence), and variously “obstructing the generative act”: so spoke two of its accusers quoted earlier. Hincmar of Rheims (d. 882) discussed 9780230610644ts08.indd 1459780230610644ts08.indd 14512/7/2009 3:13:06 PM12/7/2009 3:13:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Goddesses, Elixirs, and Witches146striga (witch) who used magic (maleficium) to destroy marital affection.77 In classical Latin a strix meant an owl, later meaning also a night-spirit and vampire.How did the witches allegedly enact their mischief: through herbs, potions (the usual term), spells, and enchantments. Spells and enchantments could be subsumed under empowering drug actions as well as such bizarre accusations as causing hail-storms or floods. Who knew how these drugs worked, how to find, gather, and pre-pare them, how much to give and how frequently? The answer to these questions is midwives and old women. To a degree the accusations were true. Heinrich Marzell, a German scholar, demonstrated that certain herbs were associated with witchcraft. He named them “Zauberpflanzen Hexentränke/ Magic plants and witch potions” and “Hexen- und Teufelskraüter/ Witches’ and Devils’ Herbs.”78 He included spe-cifically mandrake and artemisia and other mind-affecting herbal plants such as St. John’s wort. Any woman who possessed these devilish herbs or even had knowl-edge of them would be suspected of being a witch. “The better the midwife the bet-ter the witch,” so was a statement traced to the Middle Ages.79 If one possessed one or more of these herbs or even had the reputation of knowing them, she would be a likely witch suspect and, in the frenzy of a virulent witch-hunt by zealous, fanatical inquisitors, the possession or knowledge would be sufficient for a trial. The knowl-edge of these birth-controlling and mind-altering drugs was virtually erased from folk memory, and such knowledge was not part of formal medical training in the universities. A physician was taught how to heal, not to poison.Words used to designate witches in the Middle Ages indicate just how close the association was between sorcery, witchcraft, poisoning, midwives, and herbalists. The words for “wise woman” was virtually synonymous with midwives: vetula (“old woman”), mulier (“woman”), obstetrix (“obstetrician”), Weise Frau (“wise woman”), saga (“wise woman”), saga matrona (“wise woman”), and sage-femme (“wise woman”). These words indicated a possible witch, that is to say, in fourteenth-century par-lance, suspected of being a devil worshipper or sorceress. Two Germanic words, Nacht Frau (“night woman”) and Feld Frau (“Country Woman”) have a similar connotation. The connection between witches and poisoning is seen in these words also indicating witch: venefica (“poison woman”), and Gifft-Köche (poison-cooker, f.). The word for female herbalist, herbaria, indicated a witch. The English word “witch” in Middle English was “wicca” (masculine) and used as early as about 890 in the Laws of Alfred,80 which threatened witches with death on the basis of the Exodus passage quoted earlier. Edward the Elder (d. 924) exiled all who were wiccan and wigleras (“soothsayers”), and his successor, Ethelstan, executed all wiccecraeftum if their actions resulted in death. As early as 1000 the feminine form, wicce, was fre-quently used for the designation.81Pertinent to our hypothesis about gods, herbs, and witches is the number of words for witches that point to a bird: Strix, as we saw above in the Hincmar quota-tion, was in classical Latin an owl or screech owl. Later medieval forms were strega, striga, or strigimaga that meant witch, usually female, with a connotation of a screech owl.82 A modern source says that strega was a vampire that could turn into an owl and later was applied only to female witches.83 The changing into beasts probably was the last act of the sevenfold witchcraft, cited above (No. 4: “Changing men into beasts by their magic art”) for which herbs were not directly responsible. Similarly, 9780230610644ts08.indd 1469780230610644ts08.indd 14612/7/2009 3:13:06 PM12/7/2009 3:13:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"147Hermes, Herbs, Elixirs, and Witchesscobax refers to both an owl and a witch as a transfer from the Greek, skopō. In clas-sical Greek this kind of owl that was more nocturnal than the Athenian owl was called in scientific nomenclature Athene noctua.84 Interestingly the science name for skopō is Strix scops L. or “the witch owl.” Linnaeus gave the owl its name in Latin apparently knowing its connection with witchcraft. Today the European horn-owl is known as scops. One of the earliest uses of the term for witchcraft (wiccecraefte) in English occurs is a work called Owl and Night about 1250.85 In chapter one, we speculated that the Anzû might have been an owl. Earlier in this chapter, depictions of Inanna show her as an owl that snatched babies at night. In the same chapter, we learned that Ascelaphos, the god who turned in Persephone for eating the pome-granate, was turned into a screech owl.86ConclusionFrom the earliest time when humans in a complex urban socially stratified society left artifacts and writings, goddesses and herbs were strongly connected. Some of the goddesses’ powers were thought to be enacted through specific herbs. Even bib-lical works, while denying the goddesses, attested to their uses. The pomegranate, mandrake, artemisia, and chaste plant are prominent examples, but there were other herbs. Only through Chinese science, which respects traditional folk remedies, did we return to artemisia plants for curing malaria. The medicinal and hallucinatory effects attributed to these herbs were real, as judged by our science. Why did we lose much of this knowledge? After the Western world became Christianized, four move-ments blocked the link between herbal medicine and human usage: the Hermetic philosophy that practical knowledge was useful according to a divine plan; the spread of the imaginative Chinese concept of an elixir to confer prolonged life; the attendant Western development of the existence of wonder drugs; and, finally, the demonization of these miraculous drug-supplying herbs when mere knowledge of them could be a death sentence. The knowledge given to humans by the gods became the instrument of demons and the devil. Inanna, Artemis, Demeter, and Hermes would have been appalled to learn what happened to their herbs. Adam, Eve, John Donne, Robert Service, Vincent Van Gogh, and hundreds of thousands so-called witches knew all too well that god’s herbs could have evil consequences. Also the herbs could work wondrous works to behold. Even now, we cherish, hope and believe that there will be a wonder (variant, “silver bullet” or “miracle”) drug to cure cancer, Alzheimer, and even cardiac diseases and that some day we will find the elixir. As I write this, attention for the elixir turns toward a compound in red wine—not a bad place to look—but, by the time you read this, probably the search will be looking elsewhere. It is out there; we need to only find it, just as Hermes told us. What a shame that in our search, we lost so many of the clues that the past provides for us.9780230610644ts08.indd 1479780230610644ts08.indd 14712/7/2009 3:13:06 PM12/7/2009 3:13:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction1.

The priestess order is the reason that Rachel, not Leah, is the protagonist in the Genesis story. Teubal (pp. 102–103, 135–136) believes that Sarah was the goddess “incarnate” in the mode of Inanna, Abraham was the “intermediary,” and the narrative indicates a transition from a matriarchal to the patriarchal society.14.

Harold N. Moldenke and Alma L. Moldenke, Plants of the Bible (Waltham, MA: Chronica Botanica Company, 1952), p. 137; the Talmud tract Sanhedrin 99b two rabbis as identifying duda’ im as yabruchi and sabiski, but according to Julius Preuss, Biblical and Talmudic Medicine, Fred Rosner, trans. (New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978, based on German ed. of 1923), p. 463, both terms refer to the mandrake. A third rabbi says that it was sigil, a cypress; in the Midrash, more disagreement: one interpretation says that it was barley and another hackberry or myrtle berry (mayish). See Midrash Rabbah, 72, 2 (H. Freeman and Maurice Simon, trans., 5 vols. [London: Soncino Press, 1977], 1:662) but immediately in the next section (72. 3), the commentary assumes that mandrake is the correct identification. Preuss con-cluded by quoting a colleague (Huber) as saying that duda’ im was highly problemat-ical as being mandrake. Certainly in light of the Septuagint and Josephus (discussion below), the identification as mandrake is about as certain as we can come in inter-preting old texts without sufficient context.30.
