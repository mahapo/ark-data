Likewise, the texts and images I have fashioned — arising as they have from the strangest of dreams — were ever held as an especial dispensation of His Grace, and great praise given for the seminal intercession of his Muses. As a postulant of our Order, I donned the Hood, received the blessing of both hands, and took the Vow of Flesh, as once did the Beloved Ones, whose perfumed cranii populate our great ossuary. The day I formally entered into hermitage, I forsook all portrayal of vulgar images and devoted my Art solely to the Divine, that it serve purely as a vessel for its Fire. When, unexpectedly, my devotions unlocked spectral revelation, my exile from the world of common men was complete. No more could I behold such emanations of Nature as a tree, an apple, or its seed in the same manner as before, for each unfolded unto my eyes, petal upon petal, like a luminous rose of infinite interior, graven with a light supernal. Likewise, the artifices of man were unlocked to my perception, such that their vast but subtle hieroglyphs became supremely clear. During this profound exigency of the Path the very Floodgates of Spirit were thrown wide, and a great and furious horde poured through that narrow strait called 'Self. Amid the torrent of my sensorial awakening, my state of alienation was such that, whilst I walked as a man in the world of men, the greater portion of my awareness merged with Eternity. This marked the transmogrification of my soul into something other, a shadow-passage which I have come to call 'The Great Turning Away'. Within our Blessed Order, certain of our austerities sought to master the Hand and the Eye, that by the sacred marriage of the Quill and the Holy Spirit, the Divine Word was roused to life."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"If2gressa By prayer, sacrifice, and rapt contemplation of hallowed images, we sought in isolate fervor the confluence of inspiration and manifestation. At their perfected consummation, these rites manifest in a singular miracle. The Hand of Spirit, spun of flame and lightless aethyr, was seen to extrude from the Eye itself and mark the parchment with the Unrevealed Word, the Angelic Script, and the Signum Dei. This was attained only rarely, and by those holy ones who, because of the extremity of their zeal, had been granted the title Perfecti. Despite the heavenly favour afforded the righteous, there was one among us who instructed us secretly in the opposite devotions: inasmuch as Hand and Eye must be pure and instilled with divine rigour, so too must all faith in God be sacrificed for the pleasures of Earthly Flesh, and the carnal body entire made a vessel for power. For every heavenly power revealed, a corre-sponding infernal casket must open, thereby to make manifest that elder body of knowledge he called 'The Writ of the Companie of Night'. Regarded by some as wise, vilified by others as an idolater, this Brother was, nonetheless, acknowledged by all to be filled with the Holy Spirit. As Providence granted, I was able to work by his side and study his methods. Through this conjunction of magical austerity and liberty, I awakened to the truth that certain images borne of the hands of men are indwelled by spiritous intelligences, having been forged, by Art, as astral palaces for them. As spirits unbound by the constraints of mortal flesh, their assumed bodies poured forth a light of unknown effulgence which served to wholly subvert the souls of the weak. Accordingly, their forms ceased to function merely as titillations of the aesthetic mind, and instead apportioned power as ominous gods, exacting their wills upon the world of mortal flesh."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Ingressa Some of these images miraculously controlled the minds of men or beasts; others functioned in the manner of highly skilled and rapacious soldiers; still others, presenting a seemingly unremarkable exterior, served as infinitely-vast repositories of forbidden knowledge, ever abiding in silence for the hour their seals were broken by the Wise. To some brethren, this artifice of imbuing Angelic Force within Form was surely a Divine Art -a blessing of Holy God. To others, it was diabolism, the accurst dominion of the Lamiae or witches. With regard to this accusation of witchcraft, the Good Brother refused comment, preferring to allow his work to speak for itself. When he composed an illuminated homily on Christ's power of exorcism, all who read it found their physical maladies suddenly healed, their old bones vibrant with renewed strength and vigour. Many returned to its pages repeatedly in pilgrimage as if it were an holy well proffering particularly rare and sweet waters. Thus were the setanim among us silenced: though none dared call it a miracle, the proof of its virtue was undeniable, and many remarked thereafter that it was as if the Hand of the Paraclete had reached forth from shade and touched them. However, as my tutelage with him progressed, this Brother privately revealed to me an altogether different book. Its pages were populated with curious drawings, wherefrom sequences of images and signs combined to evoke aberrant and haunting sen-sations, distortions of the senses in defiance of all personal volition. Certain of these pictures were wholly obscene, yet rendered in such a cunning manner that they fixed the attentions rather than repulsed. Soon it was as if my mind was no longer mine own, but a pleasure-ground of devils. The very structures of my eyes seemed infected by its enchantment, for by some deception of rendering, the centres of the images opened into infinitude, wherefrom hideous faces emerged, IF"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Ingressa shouting and blaspheming the scriptures. Despite sublimated outrage, a curious pleasure overcame me as I read, and instead of condemnation, I quietly sought to embrace its mystery. Mine eyes then opened as never before, their depths extending beyond the fleshly constraints of the skull. I careened from the depths of abhorrence to the summits of divine reverie in the space of a mere breath, knowing I beheld a work of great prodigy, executed by some nameless Adept. On beholding any single image, it spawned a hundred more in my mind's eye, each more transfixing than the last, all co-mingled in a frenzied round-dance seemingly ordered by laws higher than those of heaven itself. An instant was upon me when my reverie assumed unexpected alienation: in amazement I glimpsed mine own likeness in the book, but cunningly rendered in an inconic form wholly opposite myself, bound by dark filaments unto beings monstrous and angelic. Amidst these revelations, my mentor too had become transfixed. The Brother's face contorted in agonised fascination, like a man ravaged by poison, yet who longed inexplicably to taste from the skull-cup once more. This living book, he later claimed, had been obtained from 'The Companie of Night', amongst whom he had learned his Art. I well knew the dangers of becoming transfixed by such images and their indwelling daimones. As a youth, I passed long hours beside streams and brooks, amid whose rushing waters were heard the whispering of water-angels. Their mellifluous voices sung in liquid seduction, the beauty of which overwhelmed, then of a sudden paralysed, the senses. The outpouring of their hymns became as a sovereign hypnotic: the qualities of my very eyesight were transformed, and at last I was brought to the precipice of preternatural awareness, wherein the sentience of my own flesh became aqueous. Great swaying columns — part woman, part 16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Ingressa river — arose as an ever-unfolding alcazar of water, an endless dominion forming and dissolving. Likewise in my younger years, I passed many a night in prayer atop ancient tumuli, wherefrom hoary voices instructed me in the doctrines of mist and moonlight. As the discarnate mutterings waxed louder they assumed visual form:- miasmic faces of grotesque proportion budded forth from the blackness, wavering at the boundaries of the manifest. That I held counsel with the hideous, and retained my faculties when the sun rose on the morrow, I attributed to the mercy and benison of God. But my benefactor insisted that, inasmuch as some might attribute all such miracles to God, these powers of fascination, spirit rev-elation, and image-transfixion arose, in certain persons, from the very Flesh of Man. With the passage of time the Good Brother came to impart additional teachings, and my astonishment gave way to conviction. An adumbrated road opened before me, and it became plain that this Power was at once a light and a shadow, ever enmeshed in consanguinity with the Body of Flesh. Thus it was that I sought, by my steps upon the road, a more per-fect manner of sight. In time, I came to see that 'God' — as the Holy Fathers have long advanced him — is but a derangement of the Body, whose pathology is such that it makes of mortal flesh a prison which no Light may penetrate. Thus was the Way opened before me anew into the Temple of the Lord, and into the Great Circle of the Companions of Night. Frater A.H.I.

According to this doctrine, the Image declared itself Sole Lord over the Void, and forbade the manifestation of all other images. But Void —herself being Monad— would not abide this entity, because, despite its fearsome appearance, the quality of its light was restrained. As a result of the One Image's rejection by the Abyss, its reflection came into being, which was call'd 'The World'. This reflection assumed the form of a great Mirror, and became the opposite of the One Image, containing all manner of wondrous things. Reflecting the emanation of the common, it spawned those transgressions called 'beauty' and 'ugliness'. By refraction of singularity, it begat entirety; with the diffraction of impotence, there arose powers beyond the masks of might. It is conjectured by some that, had Man escryed this Mirror, he would in one instant have beheld All Things, perceiving beyond the plenary swarm of worlds-within-worlds, beyond the surfaceless chasms of Void, even unto the silent turning of the Mill of Eternity. Amidst the manifold treasures the Mirror of All Things contained, the greatest of them all was Spirit, which, by way of both Light and Desire, permeated Totality.

And Void set her eyes upon the Mirror of All Things, beholding the infinitude of its marvels, and was overcome with pleasure: for that once Unknown was now Manifest, and the procession of light which liberated as a result she reckoned as ecstasy. At this moment of mutual beholding, the very Heart of the Mirror manifest as a great fiery one, his golden body assuming great and marvellous proportion, comely beyond all measure, and flew forth from his habitation unto Void. Upon beholding this miracle, the One Image became wrathful and shattered the Mirror, sending its fragmented shards, each containing a portion of Primal Virtue, tumbling through Eternity.1 Likewise, as the Body of the Mirror was divided, so also was there a great sundering of Spirit. And the Heart of the Mirror, who had gone forth unto Void, remained with her, and the One Image remained in his self-wrought dominion of astral debris. This doctrine further asserts that those who wield the power of the Art Magical are divided in twain by a great flaming sword, hung from the firmaments. On one side of the blade stand those who ever seek to exalt the One Image, and in its service further divide and fragment the shards of its reflection, until naught but a scattering of dust remains. On the opposing side of the blade i. Obscure variants of the legend relate that certain shards of the Mirror persisted after the formation of Terrestrial Earth, and on rare occasions fell from the sky-Of these fragmenta, the ancients identified two varieties, Vttrum Occultum (Hidden Glass), which immediately sank into the interior of the earth, and VitrumAdamas, which remained on its surface. The latter were hoarded by sophists who were transfixed by their curious qualities, but understood them not. 2.0"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Mirror and the One Image are those who quietly gather up the shards, that their work serve to re-make the Mirror, and thus 'The World' as they envision it to have been before its division, there to reinstate its exiled Heart. Both groups have called themselves 'The True Faith', and in the interest of their ministrations, they have unknowingly abdicated their command of the Art Magical. This is the teaching, such as it is. And yet, if this superstition obtains, I say unto you that there is a third group, obscure and invisible to the eyes of man, who walk by night upon the sword's very edge, commanding at once both the powers of division and assemblage. Of the shards of the Antient Mirror they take and grind, then re-cast in a million bodies the eternal forms of Spirit, such that their flesh becomes One with its power. This power arises, some say, from the Heart of the Mirror, a fraction of whose ancient light glows, as an ember, within their very flesh. As living artifacts of this eldritch speculum, the highest manifestations of their Art bear specific powers of primal radiance which may see and be seen, which may illuminate and endarken, and which possess in simultaneity the virtues of the Mirror in its complete and ruinous states. Their avocation is sorcery: they are known unto the vulgar as 'heretics' or, sometimes, 'witches'. 21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Of the Mask When, in my way-straying quest for knowledge of the Blessed Sight, I first encountered a witch, her identity as such was unknown to me. Her outward appearance was of a form wholly unfamiliar and I possessed no words to describe her. Nor would her actions, speech, or silences be identifiable to any who presume to understand the Witching Art, save those Veiled Ones who know her intimately as Queen. And yet, at this moment of reckoning, having left the world of common men far behind, my eyes had opened to behold the waking dream - and as a result also became susceptible to the impress of Seeming. As such all perceptions of her became a sudden multiplicity of distortions, as if the scattered refractions of a corpse-candle through mist and darkness. Despite my inability to recognise her, the unlettered, shadow-portions of my spirit knew at once that our meeting was fortuitous, and all wonderment at the truth of her substance was given in sacrifice to the unknown god of the moment.2 In silence she led me over the moor, where wended an old green road, at last entering into a steeply-sloped wood. When the earth at last became flat, we came unto a plot of a most peculiar ambience. Beyond field and thicketed hedge it stood, a monument of inexplicable oddity. Amid the trees I discerned an ancient stone bulwark, its stone carapace carven with a procession of horned grotesques all but obliterated by moss and lichen. Though it bore all of the outward signatures of ruin and abandonment,when I shut my eyes I perceived the whole as a pulsing centre of 2. ldentitasprunam sparsam in cupiditasflammis est.

Upon the statue's pedestal were carved the following words: I. It is the Custom of our Order that all brethren within our Sanctuary shall wear a Mask. II. Each shall fashion his own Mask, whether hideous or beautiful, in secret, and in accordance with the pleasure of the Unknown God. III.

Not only shall the Face be Masked, but also the Word. On seeing this, my guide bid me remain in solitude, contemplating the meaning of this riddle. Her final admonition was that, should I arrive at the correct understanding, its verity would be vouchsafed by a sign.

Conversely, others assert that a witch is a country woman who effects cures and auguries for the gullible. She is found at the periphery of farmsteads and offhardscrabble woodland pathways, if indeed one knows where to look. In this image, she appears with a kerchief tied on her head, and with the following devices: a mortal and pestle, a polished rock crystal, a bunch of herbs bound with cord, divining cards, and a candle set atop a mummied hand. The so-called cunning-man, with his staff, book, knife, cranium, and instruments of horoscopy is also identified with this exemplar. Taken together, theirs is the dominion of charm, exorcism, and nostrum. Phantasie conjures the witch as a nubile temptress, adept at the use of feminine power to overthrow male virtue: a daughter of Eve and Old Eden's Serpent. Here, she is pictured naked, her moon-pale body encircled by the scarlet coils of the Snake, or yet mantled in green: in her left hand is a chalice and in her right a flensed human skull. Because her sorcerous proclivity is seduction, she is sometimes accompanied by an image of the human heart, bound with knotted cord; or with a phial of poison and diverse Herbs of Venus. This type of witch of necessity includes the venefica or poisoner, as well as the fricatrix, or woman who rubs', known for her erogenous application of intoxicating unguents.4 The Holy Inquisitor, considered to possess much knowledge of these matters, insists a witch is one who has turned against God, having sacrificed soul and body to infernal spirits for a measure +• As noted in Weirus, Depnustigis doemonum, ijtfj.

Such enchanters may be male or female, and appear in secret ritual congregation with others of their kind. In this nocturnal ceremony, they join with a horned black devil, a moon-crown'd harlot, or both in a kind of blasphemous reverie said to ape the rites of the Holy Sacrament. Devices present in this depiction are the boiling-pot, forked staff, broom, scourge, desecrated eucharist, wine-cup, feast-table, and the crux inversa. In more sophisticated accounts of these rites the attentive will also note a solitary tree in prominence:- Oak, Walnut, Beech, or Chestnut. Men of Reason too, advance their own chosen genus of our lamia. They proclaim the witch a lunatic, suffering madness, hysteria, unseemly vapours, and aberrations of mind, a victim of both disease and the collective delusions of the irrational. Where representations of this type appear, the face is drawn and skeletal, the body clothed in rags, and haunted by spectral forms emerging from the darkness. More rarely this form of witch may be a sleeping maiden, haunted by incubi, nightmares, and nocturnal daimones; images of the Moon and the Poppy are also present. According to Reason, the witch should not be persecuted, but proffered the cure of strong medicament. Should therapeutics prove ineffectual, confinement in an asylum is preferable to the wheel, gallows or stake. Standing midway between the Inquisitor and the Man of Reason is the Magus, who regards the witch as the inheritor of degenerate forms of ancient high magic.

Men of Science maintain that the witch haunts the minds of the ignorant merely as a specter, an inversion of religious piety or rational order, possessing attributes calculated to rouse outrage among the superstitious and simple-minded. In cases where Men of Science have adopted the Mind as their chosen fetish, the witch is portrayed as a societal scapegoat or victim of mob rule. From these scientific conceptions arise no symbolic exteri-orisation —merely the admonition that the conception of the witch, like that of God, takes its place among the figmenta of the ignorant.

How, then, do witches appear amidst themselves, within the bound circle of their own Art? Few may know, for their outward appearance gives no sign of their proclivity; indeed 'tis their custom to walk among all men unseen.

Why were they so named, and what did they watch? Some say their eyes were captivated by the sight of mortal women, who were fair to behold. Upon seeing them, their desire was roused, and so they courted them, and embraced them as wives. From their union sprung the Giants or Mighty Ones, as well as the great houses of the Art Magical.

My hopes for learning their sublime Arts gradually faded, and my once-strong faith succumbed to rapacious agents of the corrupt, like so much carrion.

The battered face of this nameless god seemed to glower a rupestrian malevolence, commanding a vitality which transcended both the stone and the act of its carving.

In concert with this principle, every manifest form produces an emanation of light which interpenetrates Void and bears distinct, though hidden, signatures of power. The Body of the Perceptible, that entity a witch calls Self, dwells in perpetual congress with the unperceived Abyssal Body, or Body of Void, which is similarly referred to as Other.11 Their mediating power is the Body of Shadow, prefiguring the Perceptible, and, when disciplined, bearing the magical writ of the sorcerer into and from the Abyssal Body.

The infinite tracery of luminous emanations and abyssal chasma, in their totality, comprise the Phantasmal Order; its anatomy is embodied by sentient bonds of interconnectivity, which, when perceived by the Seer, assume the form of intelligences. Intertwining all creation as a vast and phantom lacework, the magnificence of its body eludes the Eye of Clay, but may be glimpsed in part by way of the Sight of the Wise. This subtle conjunction of luminous, umbral and voidful architecture likewise interpenetrates the Subtle Flesh of Man, which we reckon in sum as the Phantasmal Body.11 Deeds of the Art Magical may forge, intensify, differentiate, or disrupt the bonds of phantasmal emanation, thereby re-presenting their sentient qualities. Where Will, Desire and Belief perfectly frame the emanant trajectory, enchantment achieves realisation in the form of hypostasised Eternity.

Such precepts are immeasurably ancient, though for the purposes of our Art we assign especial relevance to the tractate on sentient emanations De Bgdw Stellarum, composed by the ninth-century Arab philosopher Al-Kindi, as well as the works of (i) the Nolan; and (ii) Ioannis Dee. 4tf"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Anatomie of the \"Phantasmal Body Amongst the Companie of Night, these factors infer the presence of an additional principle, an autochthonous light within the witch distinct unto the Art Magical itself, borne of an ancient event and transmitted in shadow, hand-unto-hand, throughout the ages.

As such it is typified by distortion, suggestion, and fluid states of being. When the mundane eyes perceive a shadow, its substance is generated by a co-mingling of both darkness and light; thus in photic terms, they encompass a liminality between the two realms. The dominion of the Magical Shadow may be metaphorically apprehended by consideration of the shadow's mechanical relation to Void, for the visible shapes a shadow assumes indicate an absence in the photic field. For example, a shadow-hand cast upon a surface indicates an actual hand, or a simulacrum thereof, occupies the luminous field of a light-source:- thus a void of corresponding shape and dimension perforates the source-luminosity. Similarly, the shadow's capability of being perceived is also reliant upon that light which surrounds it. The features of the Body of Shadow are typified by the sensus umbrae or 'shadow-sense', this being a complex of sensory moduli existing beyond the parameters of the commonly-acknowledged Human Pentalpha, or five senses. It is the dominion of the extruded sentinel or Fetch, as well as the necromantic zones accessed by more transcendent forms of witchcraft-practice. Where the Body of Shadow becomes consciously empowered through the Art Magical, its form becomes metastable, capable of assuming a multiplicity of powers in accordance with Art. What is True concerning the Body of Shadow also obtains for the dominions it traverses: the Totality of the Prefigurated is become malleable, for them with the knowledge, skill and sensitivity to do so.

Sorcerous Reception, the ingressive modality of Sight, consists in the first instance of imaginis augura13 the diverse sensory rudimenta initially penetrating the sensorial portals of the Flesh of Self, unburdened by meaning.

However, the Art of the Witches reckons its power merely as a route of transmission, for benediction or bane. Its modalities may encompass enchantment, votive offering, oracular query, and the exteriorisation of the Sensorial Body for glimpsing what lies beyond.1* The wise use of this modality of sight lies in apprehending the transience of force and form, or, more appropriately, motion and stasis. r5\"- A Seer may, for example, project visual scrutiny to a precise location beyond the Body of Flesh, to observe events far distant from one's temporal locality.

To predict the parameters of that which may, by Art, be envisioned and imaginally manifest, the virtue of the Eye must first be known. The Eye of Clay reckons outward form and the procession of 'meaning' manacled to its substance.

Some, being youthful, stood as individual bushes, but a greater number, untouched by shears, had formed dense, budded hedges. Yet none of these flowers, despite their intoxicating perfume, had yet opened. And I found that, despite my resolute procession toward the chapel in the distance, I craved them, if for nothing more than to keep as a holy memento of my peregrination. Upon our arrival, I discovered the monument to be of white marble, its lines manifest in accord with the pattern of the Antient Ogdoad. The chapel was ringed about with smiling caryatids, and each of the pale maidens bearing upon her head a curious vessel in the shape of a skull.

She led me to the north-east station, from which we processed around the chamber in silence, contemplating each of the eight images in turn. The First. An alabaster egg, carved with the Seals of the Moon, from which hatched a crimson snake with horns of golden fire. The Second. A carpet of red roses, atop which rested a great fig leaf inscribed with a red pentaculum. In the midst of the star was an iron padlock and a key carved of emerald. The Third. A young bearded man of handsome face arrayed in a simple white robe, standing before an altar heaped high with fruit and grain. The Fourth. An upright staff intertwined with flowering thorn, atop which was perched a mask of a horned grotesque; from its mouth a scroll proceeded bearing the words PER VIA NOVUM CARNIS DEI REGNUM ENUNTIABITUR.

The Eighth. An image of a male corpse wrapped in a burial shroud, lying in an open grave. Above him stands a woman in white looking downward. In her left hand she holds a sod of earth, and in her right a lantern with a blood-red candle. In particular, this final image of the sequence was most disarming, for the eyes of the corpse were open, his expression bearing a distorted rictus, as if still clenched by the rigor of death. In a trice his death-mask seemed to writhe, and I beheld his face as mine own, locked in an expression of paralysed horror. \"Which of these images,\" she asked with severity, \"Represents yourself?\" Her eyes were set upon me like the tip of a poison blade, suspended in air before a swift descent. In response to her challenge, my awareness shifted, and seemed to operate from outside mine own body.

In this manner the Arena functions as a chapel, an holy shrine or sanctum wherein the image is exalted. The Arena is conjoined in a blessed copulation with the magical image it contains, and the child of their union is the perceptual enchantment of Illumination, as seen by the Phantasmal Eye. An eternal image may thus move through many such Arenas, like unto an astral pilgrim, ever wandering from chapel to chapel. In each holy shrine it abides, a different mask of power is donned, yet the image's infinite nature remains the animating force behind the mask. In this manner, one thing becomes many.1' Let us consider the ancient symbol of the sword. Borne first of the flames of the Kerubim, and later of foundry and forge, its origin encompasses the sacred mysteries of transmutation by fire. Thus it is glorified in the courts of Vulcan, Haephestos, Tubalcain, and indeed Azazel, that exiled angel of old who in-structed primal man in the Art Metallurgies The sword also en-compasses the power of division, serving both the utility of war and an arcanum of spirit. This transmutative nature is part of its holy lineage and the confluence of powers which conceive it. 18. The fifteenth-century book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili by Francesco Colonna, in both its substance and narrative exposition, is a manifest exemplar of the arcanum of the Arena of Reception. 1p.1 Enoch 8:1.

Within the compass of the sword's actuality, these attributes perpetually reflect, and oppose, one another, as do light and shadow. Yet the sword's masks may change in accord with the Arena in which it appears. Seen lying upon a battlefield, the blade signifies one thing; seen sheathed at the side of a cavalier, it conveys yet another. The sword fixed within a stone relays one mystery, and a broken sword an arcanum entirely different. The Sword of Justice, held aloft by the courthouse statue as a foundational symbol of civilising power, hearkens to both its nobility and barbarity. In all cases, the sword embodies an eternal power —but also a temporal power determined by its Arena of Reception. In addition to its crystallising influence upon the perceptible powers of image, the Arena of Reception possesses an Interior Form, comprising the type of portal through which the Light of any perceived Image passes. The type of portal and its powers thus aid in the crystallization of Light within the magical sensorium. The Eye and its image-making faculties is the chief interior form of the Arena of Reception within the Seer. But all organs of the known and unknown senses may, by the power of witchcraft become Eyes, that the New Flesh may perceive all. The Lexicon of the Phantasmal The Array of the Perceptible provides an endless procession of stffia accessible by the Wise-of-Art. Because the light-gathering faculties of man are particularly dominant in the sensorial field, and because Civilisation and its metastases favour the development of this fleshly sense over others, these signa frequently assume the form of images.

By its sensorial nature, the Carnal Vessel and all its faculties, whether consciously empowered or not, serves as an Arena of Reception for all luminous emanation assuming the forms of signa. Thus is a Lexicon of Sensation continually created within the Body, comprised of a retinue of signs utilised by the empowered Eye of Seeing. This lexicon is not merely visual, but consists of all entity perceived via the para-sensory routes, as well as the mundane senses. For the Seer, such a lexicon of aethyric signs is linked to corresponding powers, which may be permutated with others via the perceptual modalities of Reception, Projection and Perceptual Congress. However, the powers of the phantasmal signa are manifold, each of which radiates in specificity according to the Arcanum of its host Arena. Thus their potentialities are jointly expressed in Singularity, Duality, and Infinity. As an example, consider the manifold resonances of the wax taper, an ancient symbol of the Witch's Art.

Let patient reckoning and careful observation be the key to test all locks. Where signa arise from the Dominion of the Imperceptible, crossing the gulf into Sensorial Awareness, their eidolons are generated. However, because of their vacuous origin, their shadowy reflections frequently assume the forms of the Hideous, alienating perceptual consciousness. The reflexive response of the vulgar mind is to assign name, value, meaning, or a comparable ngia of the Perceptible so that its numinous breadth is more easily contextualised within the Lexicon. The Eye of the Witch, by contrast, becometh as Void itself, in magical action tenebrating the whole of the Phantasmal Lexicon, thereby to embrace the intrusive sijma's hsecceity.

Though hidden from the waking eye, such may be perceived by some amid silence and stillness, or by the routes of dream, or shadow-senses. The attributes of such signs vary, but the Re-Ordering of the Body of Knowledge will cause them to assume a shape or form that can be visually perceived. Likewise, certain of these luminous emanations are associated with specific witch-clans, and upon ritual entrance to their ranks, the luminous signature is granted, attaching itself to the new initiate as both a phantasmal marker and Ward. Whilst hidden from the waking eyes, these spectral forms may be glimpsed at the height of Sabbatic reverie, usually as an exteriorisation of phantasms.20 These aspects of the aethyrial properly belong to the Body of Shadow.

The Inner Nature of Witch-Cult is such that it has long recognised Imagination as one of the greatest incarnative powers of Man. This faculty, especially in the past four centuries, has been suppressed, manacled, muted, and assaulted in the profane order; content to atrophy in the Station of the Ape, it is thus become, in our present era, a Forbidden Art. Accordingly the Imaginal Lexicon of Witchcraft is concerned with that which may liberate Imagination for self-enchantment. The quintessential teachings are not particular symbols or precepts, but rather dynamic relationships, movements, and postures, each of which assumes its highest flowering from a unique conjunction with each Adept. Imagination, usually defined as the image-making faculty of the mind, is, in its witchcraft-conception, extended beyond the visual into the totality of the sensorial. Its powers he beyond the singular ability to form sensorial simulacra (such as the image of a Rose or the odour of a corpse) at will. The Imaginal Faculty, or the emanant powers of the Phantasmal Body, is dynamic; it actively links zones of power with one another, and in multiplicity permutates and transmutes them.

To this growing assembly of Selves one may then extrapolate the procession to include the Possible Selves of Futurity. As with the ensorcellment of the experiential, all may be empowered as individuals or as legion experienced as One. Whether for pleasure, power, or knowledge, the varying emanations of Self conjured by the Imaginal Faculty serve for a greater unity and magical experience of Self.

The fears of another cannot stand as equals to those devils emergent upon the sorcerer's own path; likewise are his Delights and Ecstasies sovereign over those experienced vicariously. This primacy, however, lies inert, as bones in the hollows of a crypt; it must be claimed, first by acknowledgment, then by sustenance, and finally by possession.

This tests their abilities individually to recognise the Sign upon the same person, as well as serving as an opposing proof against any possible projection of Desire. Should the Eyes of All be in agreement, a pact is made to further observe the person, and, should opportunity arise, approach them discreetly.

If the gate-ways of mundane memory are penetrated with active magical consciousness, as with thzArs Memoria, Memory becomes both a sorcerous art and a sacred means of ordering the Experienced. To the witch, the unconscious memory is envisaged as a ruinous estate, a field of broken monuments, waste ground, and rubble, amidst which innumerable artifacts of importance lie partially revealed, or distorted through layers of dust. Conversely, the symbol of the conscious memory, empowered by Art, is the Book. Scribed across the surface of All Creation, the Book records the Signs of Power in a multitude of magical languages, which may become discernible to the Self. This assignation implies the additional distinction that all portions of the Body of Flesh may serve as individual storehouses of Memory, and may thus be empowered by sorcerous means.'4 This principle of Carnal Memory extends from the feet, whose hoard of memories encompass all steps walked and wandered, to the Temple of the Skull, whose osseous vaults preserve all which has passed therein. Memory may become enciphered within the 34. The encryption of Memory within specific zones of the physical body is a matter long known by practitioners of esoteric medicine and anatomy. In particular, both extreme physical trauma and extreme physical pleasure —and their associated memories or revelations— frequently establish power-matrices within the flesh as a matter of unconscious homeostasis. The witch may access these at a later time by manuductive passes to the zones in question, or by imaginal conjuration therein. 82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Of-Anamnesis flesh where spirits, or differentiated forms of Light, permeate specific areas of the body. This may occur either as a conscious magical operation, or unconsciously, as is the perpetual case with the uninitiated. Of particular importance to Carnal Memory are the corporeal zones of sexual power, for their dual-potency of immense sensitivity and creative potential Thus, for the Wise, every sexual act is a 'pilgrimage of attention' wherein ecstatic pleasure is but a small part of the magical goal. Where carnal memory preserves the artifacts of injury, Formulae of Opposition may be applied to their corporeal matrices such that the affected bodily zones may concentrate and project the quintessence of poison encrypted, or, alternatively, manufacture its nectarous antidote within the Alchemic Shrines of the flesh. Where the ruinous somatic architecture of wounding is accessed for its powers via the Art Magical, this power is known as Encharaxis.u Similarly, the witch may extract Memory from the Hidden Coffers of the Flesh by diverse magical operations. The simplest of these techniques of remembrance is the ritual recapitulation of the original encrypting event. However, because the original event was of sufficient force to preserve memories in the flesh, that zone of carnality has thus become sensitised. Whether by pleasure, pain, sound, sight, or other specified mode of sensorial reception, a lesser quantity and greater quality is required in the context of enchantment to summon memory into the vitality of sensorial consciousness. Such spirituous artifacts often possess their own legion of associated subordinate powers, each of which may be bound or transmuted in accordance with the designs of the Witch's Art.

Of particular importance is the power drawn into the flesh from magical fires.3' Immediated Memory It is the teaching of the Wise that No Thing is ever truly lost, but becomes accessible through magical intercourse with Eternity. This is one meaning of necromancy. As scattered bones, the Body of Wisdom Past is 're-membered' through the Great Work, and diverse corpora of knowledge are revived, even as new bodies take flesh in the present era. Like the cadavers which crowd the ancient plague-pits, the Corpse of Forgotten Knowledge is ravaged by decay, its bones perforated by lacuna: and accretions of the dust of ages. This state of obscurity and neglect is so defined, however, only in relation to the Living, whose apathy has rendered it so. Should the Seed of Numen go forth from the loins of the Devoted unto the recesses of the Crypt, the ancient procession of souls ceases to moulder, and stands upright as a newly-gathered host. One of a number of sorcerous approaches to Remembrance, this sacred rite is Love's Art.37 Immediation of Memory is another such magical approach, and consists in the first instance of recollection of a chosen memory via a magically-empowered primary sensation, such as smell. A secondary sensation, if known, may also be used to bring forth Examples of this principle are readily observed in the living wisdom of Mazdayasna; the ancient British rites of the need-fire and driving livestock rough the hearth at Midsummer; and the ignification of the phantasmal body occurring in the days following the fire-walking ceremony. 37- ve of the Ancestral Retinue is a conscious reflection of the ecstasy of '\"carnation.

The Magical Awareness of the Present then locates within the memory a luminous source at its heart - the Light of the Phantasmal, which shone as its initial informing radiance, revealing the essential power of the thing remembered. This power may be an emotion, a teaching or wisdom, a reflexive reaction or a complex of these. Whatever its nature, it was the animating force sufficient to impress the thing in Memoiy. The Animating Radiance of the Memory thus determined, it is extrapolated as a spirit, daimon, or a godform, within the realm of the Phantasmal. Sacrifice is then given that it assume flesh and the presence of the animated sentience may then become congressive. Memories once bound in stasis, or possessing irrelevant psychic accreta, become animate and dynamic; they cease to be mere artifacts and attain Presence. A result of this practice is that networks of'lost' experience will begin to aggregate and reveal the once-Forgotten. Thantasmal Kinesthesis Ghost-memories of corporeal motion may, through peculiar sensory routes, manifest within the flesh, even as one assumes a posture of stillness. This is readily perceived by consideration of the vertigo arising from whirling, which persists after all bodily motion ceases. Similarly, one who has passed many hours at sea will, upon returning to land, find that the waves still rise and fall beneath his back, even as he descends into the sleep of a stationary bed. Rather than regarding such sensations as mere nervous residua, the witch seeks, by distillation and extension of the sensorial artifact, to magnify its power in linkage with its origination-entity.

This may occur by sudden immersion in the unfamiliar, where the Body of Flesh is subject to violation and ravishment. Such were the austerities of those ancient Desert Fathers who, locked in the isolate depths of the hypogeum, struggled with demons for the Glory of God.3\" Penetration of the Light of Spirit into the Eye of Seeing is accomplished by the supreme sigil of the vesica piscis and its magical progeny.

Where the sexualities become self-serving, the phantasmal body is overrun and becomes the worm-riddled Effigy of Tithioz, and man becomes less than a golem. Pleasure, in particular that liberated by the orgasm, is not seen as a terminal consummation, but a perpetual state of ecstasis with both revelatory and projective power - extending beyond the fleshly shrines of the Secret Place. Through the vehicle of pleasure, especially its unknown, liminal, and aberrative aspects, the routes of the perceptual are magnified, and the Field of Ex-istence broadened.

This exaltation of the Phantasmal Body has been called the 'Carnal Eye', and 'The Body of Sight'. Though there is considerable variation in witch-lore, the primal teaching is that each centre of the Body of Flesh is a hypostasised portion of Eternity, and thus differing sentiences reside in, and preside over them. The force and form of a particular zone of carnal power, or of all in unity, may be summoned as the intellective numen empowering operations of the Art. Taking the Heart as an exemplar, the Seer may, by careful extension of that organ's manifold ingenia, refine and magnify its magical dominions as an organ of sentient luminosity.

More often than this it serves to dull ecstasy: its abuse by the uninitiated in purely hedonistic or addictive contexts reliably engenders foolishness, indiscretion, suppression of wits, disease, and death. Here one must distinguish between mastery of the poison and the poison's mastery of the flesh, as well as the difference between hallucination and spirit-derived vision. Crude derangement of the sensorium produces, like an improperly-functioning machine, senses compromised rather than expanded47 Exceptions occur in cases where, by skill and intent, one or more senses is suppressed so that others may operate unimpeded. This modality is typical of the class of drugs known as hypnotics, but, as with all poisons, the magical skill of the operator is of equal importance to the power of the poison-cup. According to the formula: of the Witches' Sabbath, reorientation of the New Flesh permits magnification of sensorial gnosis such that the power gained by imbibition of poison or nectar may, properly mastered, allow for its future resurgence in absentia of the poison itself. Unlike the addict or glutton, the accomplished veneficus requires less quantity each time a poison is used, sometimes able to engage the Genius with only a single drop or none at all. This state arises from the crystallisation of venefic radiances within the diverse shrines of the flesh. In the correct exactions of this formula, ecstasis thus aroused has been known to exceed that produced by significant draughts of the poison intra corporis. +7- A classic physiological example, not involving drugs, is Ocular Migraine, or Eye Migraine', a malady wherein eyesight becomes distorted in conjunction with severe migraine pain. 109"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Lux Hteresis The recollective faculties summoned to resurrect such phantasmal poisons are linked in the first instance to sensorial nostalgias: the remembered appearance, taste, smell, and texture of the poison, and Immediated Memory of its initial signification within the flesh.

In many cases the object has been forged by the hands of the profane, or fundamentally altered from its natural form so as to be little more than a bauble.

Instead of immersion in the seductive danse of these apparitions, the dreaming-eye must be shut to all, suppressing the influx of dream-light.

In this way, a compound image wields its potentials as a fully-manifest entity, but also in a grotesquerie of forms partially-fleshed and mutually interlaced. We illustrate this maxim by conjuring in the Phantasmal Eye a banquet table, set with a great many foods and drink, for the occasion of a ritual feast. Each victual bears a power which, though savoured individually, supports and glorifies the greater banquet. A goblet of wine is enjoyed for its bouquet, intoxicating virtues, and elevation of the foods it accompanies. The Holy Loaf is passed hand unto hand, exalting the Host of the Com; broken in fellowship, but also bearing the reverberations of ancient murders and betrayals. The living flesh which partakes of this meal is united by its subtle arcana, in the hidden compact of Veneration of the Body. But our banquet also contains sights, odours, and other sensory emanations radiating subtle atmospheres independent of the feast proper, any of which may be accessed in singularity or multiplicity. All feasting-vessels, too, must needs be considered, for each wields a voidful and plenary power. Adjunctive to the feast itself, we must reckon the diverse desires, histories, powers and motives of each guest in attendance, which function individually —and as a spirit-amalgam— in various combinations. Though one may not perceive these shadows of influence during the banquet, they remain operant. Each component, therefore, possesses a potentiality which, though not necessarily fully expressed, nevertheless exerts influence upon its peers. 128"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Image: Beauty and Ugliness In addition, all aggregate magical images unfold the Arena of Reception, which directs individual and conjunctive potentialities of all component portions. The Arena thus serves as the Stone Tablet upon which the Law is graven, its surface dually-existent as inscribed and smooth. In the exemplar of our ritual banquet, the Arena of Reception is the symbol of the Table, whose great power priests —and witches— have long known. Of Beauty and Ugliness Abrahamic Orthodoxy proclaims that images are dead, or the emanation of demons, and their veneration the error of idolatry - an offense whose consequence is stoning. This ancient prejudice, ossified in religious law, reaches its poisonous fruition in the gradual closing of the Eye of Spirit, and the reversion of the Man of Light to the Man of Clay. From the smoke of this extinguished lantern arose the specter of iconoclasm, and the martyrs of the stake, whose burning bodies 'served as lamps by night'. In the present age Eido-latria has become, in the corralled parlance of the common, no longer a Blessed Art but a means of philosophical repudiation, or arrogating power over divine ecstasy. As the witch Alogos Dhul' Qarnen Khidir observed: Religion and its ritual are, for those who have no direct experience of the mystical, the means of repeating and re-encoding the experience of the Founder. In short, religions are founded on the abdication of the right to See for oneself14 Indeed, should we apply the priesdy criteria for proscription of idolatry to the ontological foundations of religion itself, it too Andrew D.

As such it is one hypostasis of mystical congress with the divine, but its perpetuation by codified laws ultimately an induction of catalepsis of the Spirit. From the perspective of the witch, the orthodox religious relationship to spirit is static, and is contrasted with the active spirituous dynamism of the Arte Magical.\" By the witching power of Allure, the magical image or Fetish fascinates the spirit unto which it is consecrated, as the distinctive orchestration of its corporeality is given over wholly unto the Daimon —this embodies the ancient Law of the Virgin Sacrifice. Also offered at the primeval altar of Zha-Baetylon is the labour of the image's inspiration and artifice. Where realisation of the simulacrum achieves its greatest power, ingenium tenebrates the Hand of Formation far beyond the peripheries of the conscious, and is become the Hand of Void. But Allure also functions to fascinate the Eye of the Votary, whose power-in-apotheosis extends unto all dominions of flesh. The bond thus created betwixt the Phantasmal Body and the Daimon is sexual in basis and, in exaltation, gives rise to a sidereal child, the entic manifestation of the operation in sum. In vulgar speech endures an unfortunate burden of association: that of beauty. Whilst it is true that beauty is subjective, it is also defined as that which pleases the eye. Conversely, ugliness, or that which offends the eye, also possesses the power of allure. Even should the eyes be willfully averted from the horrific, there exists a moment of fascination — if ever so brief — which must be quashed in the name of comfort, sanity, or mental immaculation.

Thus the Idolater-Witch holds the heretical view that all truly magical images are living, and worthy of contemplation in both beauty and grotesquerie. All serve as potential reservoirs of fascination and the liberation of power, and the most potent among them achieve a liminality incorporating both states of aesthesis. In this way we may understand how a wrathful deity may also be a deity of compassion, and how its hallowed icons may be both glorious and ghasdy. Such is the iconography of the Flayed Gods, among whose red company dwells Xipe Totec, Mani and Christ the Lord. Further Admonition Concerning the Mask Aside from its practical function of anonymity, the mask is a means of mediation between spirit and flesh. In mundane perception, it is become impersonality, unfamiliarity, and distortion. In the Art of the Wise, the mask is the spectral embodiment of the contours of its indwelling spirit, serving the magical function of effigy-become-flesh. It is thus become an animated cipher, but also a ludubrium. Here, a perceptual distinction is drawn between that which is seen and that which is unseen. Yet this division does not extend to materiality, for just because a thing is not perceived, does not guarantee its nullity/1' Yet the Seen and the Unseen, each f8. The truth of this was profoundly demonstrated to me many years ago when, whilst walking with a Brother of Arte by night in a desert, I walked off a cliff and fell to a considerable depth. By the agency of a miracle, I landed upon my feet and suffered no injury other than momentary shock. Curiously, the accident served as an omen: we had been debating Divisibility of the Unknown, and the veracity of the saying 'what you don't know can't hurt you'. 131"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"possessing unique potentialities, are both interwoven — in stasis and kinesis — with the power of the Mask.

The mask's projected visual distortion upon the Eye of Clay also serves to transfix the magical gaze; allowing entrance into the Dreaming Sabbat. How Spirits Assume Masks As the sorcerer may assume the Mask, a spirit may also do so for the veiling of its arcana. Temporal interpenetration of light into objects creates refraction, giving rise to an eidolon of the emanant luminosity rather than a re-presentation of its monadic form. We may liken this to a gemstone, formed perfectly within the Womb of Nature, and adorned by the skill of the jeweler. Cut and faceted, the Stone presents many outward faces, each both a reflector and refractor of light. Though each face so presented by the facet is individual, it may be traced back to the interior heart of the same stone. 132"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Assumption of the Mask A spectral face seen when walking in the wilderness by night may, upon drawing nearer, be discovered as a curiously-fissured stone or a twisted arboreal corpse. To the rational, such perception is mere pareidola: the assignation of'meaning' to 'random' visual phenomena. This explanation, also mistakenly called 'hallucination', ignores or seeks to repudiate the chains of mystical revelation sparked by the initial distortion of vision, as well as the ecstasy momentarily liberated within the Eye. As reason will assert, within the bounds of the 'illusory' moment, the apparition existed 'in truth' as an amalgam of light, darkness, the peculiarities of the beholding Eye, and the phantasmal substrate of the Seer. Unto this confluence of powers, the Witch admits a fifth element: the spirit which is attracted to these liminalities and chooses, if briefly, to occupy them as a substrate for manifestation or the transmission of knowledge. Spirit presences are drawn unto such Arenas of Reception precisely because of their liminalityj as in-between states, they command a degree of plasticity which by its nature may admit ingress and egress. All totality may serve as the substrate from which such apparitions manifest, including the Flesh of Man. During the heightened phases of Sabbatic reverie it is not uncommon to behold the ancestral swarm physically manifesting from the bodies of initiates. Thus each brother and sister is seen naked and unveiled, or in his True Light. Transecting the phantasmal plane and that of the mundane eye, visual apparitions may also arise as an emanation of focused group devotion, forming a vascular substrate into which the Entity may 'possess'. The parameters of the emanation are both the product of the collective of phantasmal corpora as well as the spirit employing their power to take form. Where magical devotion is sustained and singular, it is often observed that the greater the number of devotees giving power unto the rite, the 133"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Lux Haresis more pronounced the visual apparition becomes, and the greater its perceptual continuity from one Seer to the next. At rare mo-ments of emanation, a spirit may manifest with a materiality of greater coherence than objects in the visually experienced world of the mundane. To most, such visitations are alarming and hor-rifying, and provoke denial or recourse to skepticism, even amongst the most accomplished of the Art. However, at such times the Seer must recognise the 'greater materiality' of such spirits as a Great Benison of the Old Ones, and offer up neither arrogance nor cowardice in their presence, but hospitality. Of False Faces The Mask shall also serve in the role of Deceiver, fulfilling purposes many and great. Of particular note are those which manifest unconsciously as a subroutine of hubris. Where the Seeker-unto-vision fails and misperception occurs, the mind oft' places false faces upon the fragmenta of perception, imposing invention upon phantasmal lacunae. Most often arising as a result of poor magical discipline, they originate in the untransmuted impulse of the desire for familiarity, and the bodily aversion to higher orders of complexity. Such Masks of Deception may be imbued with sufficient free belief to fashion an architecture of denial which come to control the actions of the individual as a hidden god. However, there are some conditions of existence whose degree of manifest reality is far greater than the dominion of any empowered delusory construct/51 As a result of this kind of imprudence, witches assert, j $>. As an example, if a man denies a life-threatening cardiac condition, and allows it to go untreated, he dies, sacrificing his very incarnation upon the Altar of his Delusion. Whilst I have no doubt that there exist a small number of sorcerers who may eliminate such maladies of the flesh by enchantment alone, their state of advancement upon the path is such that they have no need to read treatises such as this. 134"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Vision: \"Discernment and \"Discretion three things occur: self-determination is forfeit, the Fates prick up their ears, and swift intercession follows from the Abyss direct. Of Vision: Discernment and Discretion How may the Revelation of Spirit be known as truth? This is a matter of great import to the Companie of Night, for their very substance, in centre and periphery, interweaves the liminal spheres of the daimones. In comparison to the vast influx of sensorial materia, spirit-revelation is reckoned a great rarity, like unto that spherule of gold which, concealed amid the dull stones of a fast-running stream, is made radiant by an auspicious solar ray. Likewise are True Seers and Prophets reckoned even rarer, for such is an especial flowering of the Sight, and, because of its pervasive influence upon all aspects of Self, it is very often regarded as either Curse or Burden. Yet, despite the rarity of the True Seer, varying layers of spirit-revelation will unfold for them who rightly exact the Art Magical. Are there, then, sine quibus non which may distinguish the False Prophet from the True? In addition to those traditional methods of magical discernment operant behind veils of silence, I have observed the following principles: Oracles arising from True Sight transcend all ego-qualities of the medium; including the human vehicula of sophistry and invention, figurating a distinct intelligence beyond and other to that of the Seer, together with a distinct and alien purpose.

Worse still, such unchecked sensory ingress can in long term assume the concrescent forms of entities parasitic, manifesting tfo. The morass of occultism and popular horoscopy has unfortunately tainted the well; for example conflating the omens of Death with so-called 'symbolic death' or 'rebirth'. Sometimes such moribund images as a skull, corpse, or a coffin signify imminent destruction of the physical body and no more. 136 The Revelation commands the ability to defy expectation and explanation, and to do so for years, even centuries or millennia. As the fountain of its origin lies in Eternity, the virtue of the Oracle shall endure the ordalia of Time and Art. When assuming the Vessel of the Word, True Revelation possesses infinite complexity within the finite simplicity of the Logos. The tension between the two engenders simultaneous cognitive resonance and dissonance. Oracular arcana are not constrained by the metaphoric, and also embrace the literal.

This includes knowledge and mastery of the principles of Silence and Secrecy\", and is the preserve of Ascesis, negation of the senses: the dominion of the Hermit, Sojourner at World's End. The rites of phantasmal attenuation I have learned amongst The Hidden Society, some of which have assumed form within this book, occur largely in an Arena of Reception characterised by Ascesis.42 Such may be a shrine or lonely place, and take diverse forms; yet with all, their correlative aspect is constraint of sensorial emanation. Where the Chorus is eliminated, a spirit may assume a Mask more discernably, and sing with a clear voice. This praxis ofsewe-in-absence, by its nature, allows a natural perceptual expansion of the Body of Shadow. As much as the Fleshly Senses may perceive a thing in manifestation, so the shadow-senses may perceive the unmanifest, such as an approaching spirit. Praxis-in-Hermitage is contrasted with the High Sabbat where of ingress of luminous emanation occurs in multiplicity, and the the Perfected Sensorium of the Phantasmal Body functions with homeostatic automaticity. Each may be seen as a compliment to the other, both in terms of their interpenetrative astral natures, but also as offering radically different perspectives on each other. Each also serves in the magical function of Opposer to overly social or anti-social tendencies in the practitioner. The sorcerer Aossic Aiwass gives excellent admonition on this point in his magical treatise Outer Gateways; see ch. 6 'The Fourth Power of the Sphinx'. tfi.

I had, on occasion, taken it between my hands, felt its odd contours, partaken of its curious odour, but not opened it. The memory of its images haunted me with each step of my exile. Yet I could not dispell the thought that it was not meant for my Eyes, but belonged to some brother or sister of the Hidden Society, and to open it would be a self-pronounced curse. Many was the night I woke to find the book unclasped, as if my Sleeping Body had glimpsed its curious emblems, in spite of the reserve of my Waking Self.

I resolved that I would open it in its proper time and place, when the most appropriate moment made itself known. Thus it was that I stood at last between the Black One himself, Him of the Great Going-Forth unto Convocation, and our Holy Queen, arrayed in argent splendour. As One they went before me in fiery exaltation, and in a multitude of forms enfleshed the Retinue of the Hidden. By dance and by step, by kiss and caress, by exhortations and mutterings, by poison and nectar, and by the Grand Agapae itself, each of the Veiled Ones made their joyous sacrifice: not unto our regents, or even the Great Serpent himself, but unto ourselves. And, in accord with the Way of the Ages, the Rite of Great Unmasking occurred, and I was shown: what is, what is not, and what may be. When all had thrice passed beyond the peripheries of our Rapture, I knelt in the firelight, my hands on the Book's clasp. As was my custom, I thought to petition the Oracle of the Pages, well formulating my question before unsealing it, that its genius deliver unto me the appropriate augury. My hands trembling, I prayed most earnestly, invoking the ancient power of the Sovereign Word: \"Deliver thyself. If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the Cross.

Its dark form was a mere silhouette against moonlit clouds, but was briefly lit by lightning or the flicker of strange fires. From the habitation of my skull, my Eyes flew forth into the flame, through ash, embers, and cloud, unto the very heart of the Vision unfolding. Heat and light suffused my body as I stood before a great inferno: the whole of the fortress was burning, even the great stone buttresses. By degrees my senses awakened to the manifestation before me: a deafening explosion as a library burned; the acrid constriction of my throat as it was seared by carbon black; and the smell of burning bodies, at once savoury and nauseating.

Carved of stone so dark that its margins merged with the night, the great sanctum radiated forth from a central dome. Its architecture was unknown to me, but its grotesques bespoke the holiness of an ancient and sublime mystery, of which the stonemasonry of Old Sumer and Assyria were but malformed degradations.

I perceived within this darkened sanctuary a remote and cavernous roar, as if the churning of some distant maelstrom. A columnar shadow wavered in the muted light: a short distance before me stood a magnificent woman arrayed in a shimmering dress of black adamantine, her back turned. In that moment she turned to face me; it was revealed that the entirety of her form, in flesh and habiliment, was composed of the same shimmering blackness, as if wholly formed of stars and night sky.

With his bare hands he subdued men and beasts one after the next, savagely tearing each apart with his bare hands. As each body was ripped asunder, it was summarily disjointed and flensed. To his left was a pile of skin and entrails, to his left, a great heap of bones. There seemed no end to the number of victims, nor to the amount of blood which stained the chapel.

To my right, my eyes fell upon a second chapel, from which poured forth a light blacker even than the darkness in which we paced. In its centre was a fearsome serpent, its body assuming the form of a circle, whose furious spinning seemed to generate the luminous blackness. Arrayed about its circumference were eight zones of emptiness which manifest — and unmanifest — as eight angels: four male, four female, each of supreme beauty and obscene sexuality, their revealed forms copulating, disappearing into incohesion, then re-materialising once more.

Its source was a great stone head set into the high ceiling, the countenance of a Gorgon or some grimacing god of wrath, carved of black serpentine. This face was the very image of horror, having ten black and hollow eyes, set in a circle around a gaping and many-fanged mouth. From this colossus sprung waters in a great torrent into an illuminated basin of clear topazius directly below, which, through some artifice of the lamps surrounding it, made the waters therein appear as liquid gold. From this bright bowl, the waters flowed outward toward a towering statue of some ancient and comely goddess, skillfully carved of polished porphyry. Her appearance was like unto the statues of the Old Assyrians, and her body clothed in curling vines. With one hand she reached upward to hold the illuminated basin above her; she carried in her other hand an amphora which received its constant libation. From this vessel the water flowed on into the outstretched hands of a kneeling beast-headed god, whose visage was like unto a deified horse, but having the rugged body of a mighty one of old, as Herakles.
