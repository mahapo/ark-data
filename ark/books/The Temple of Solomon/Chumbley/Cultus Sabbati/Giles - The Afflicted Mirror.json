Through the medium of art and narrative, the commonly perceived hidden world is portrayed as existing beyond our physical reality. Not passing for the non-descript, the appearance of the extraordinary depends on accentuating the potentiality of the hidden by reflecting aspects of the living world. How the observer comes to know this world involves the form­ing of a bond between a perceived physical presence and a disembodied metaphysical absence. Rather than safely rely­ing on an appearance which generates mild impression, the transformative quality of this Otherness, which defies abso­lute definition, appears before the viewer in contorted form and thus gives the absence a discernible presence. Many of the primary depictions by which relations are made depend on highlighting an alterity which certifies the notion of an existing unblemished physical form. Being dif­ferent to the inhabited world determines how these images and visions of spirits or Gods are perceived. In some cases the image of another is depicted in its perfection, although this can never be released from its subjective derivation. It is 9"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR normal to therefore expect, when coming into contact with a version of a reified person or spirit, that it will impart purity onto and into the observer. However, if examined carefully, nearly all depictions of spirits, saints, Gods and Devils con­tain, as a causal marker for engagement, certain imperfec­tions. They may be scarred, beaten, crucified, maimed, d e­formed, or signal other physical qualities not of this world. It is fair to state that nearly all of these portraits rely on inscrib­ing spirituality with a deformity. In short, the metaphysical cannot exist in the physical as an Otherness, without exag­gerating its abnormality or difference to physical perfection. This opposition to perfect physicality is perhaps nowhere more prevalent than when exploring how affliction has been used as a marker for indicating otherworldly presences. The hidden and revealed world of the everyday anchors circum­stantial narratives to projected visual representations. These depict and explain how the metaphysical appears to the viewer. Being in a state of deformation, they perhaps reflect the fragility of our everyday existence, and by doing so echo the incompleteness that we experience in our daily lives. Interconnectivity such as this suggests the source of the Other's contortion derives from this world. Yet we continue to rely on deformation to make them appear as being in op­position to our perceived norms. The common thread bind­ing the physical to the metaphysical therefore ensures our everyday volatility converts aspects of Otherness into a mu­tually derived set of shared expressive afflictions. In a similar manner the spirits also come with their own narratives about how they came to Be, and in turn explana­tions are given about their appearance. As a consequence differences between the physical and metaphysical exem-10"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction plify the same experiential moments. For spirits and people alike their mortality and survival depends upon being sup­ported, which in turn cushions them from the fragility of their own existence. In this context, The Afflicted Mirror is an explorative exercise on how spirits and people mirror the same defining qualities when coming into contact with their Other. Never truly revealing themselves in their complete form, both parties project partial aspects of their Being. As a consequence each conveys their presence by making the ab­sence of the Other appear as a physical distortion. There is however a continuity between the world seen and unseen when attempting to apprehend the reflection of our Otherness. What are the spirits, gods and other beings to us if they are not to be realised in subtle abstracted reflections emanating from Self? Across the globe, humans have strived to make sense of their world, not only by explaining what they can see, but also by attempting to understand what they cannot see. Explanations about the dark unknowable mass, exudes a vibrant potential because we reflect back into the nothingness our own imaginings. In distorted and contorted states of Being they emerge as metaphors for our own 'be­coming', consequently they lend themselves to making our world. And in this meeting place, located somewhere be­tween civilisation and the wild we begin to understand our­selves through the partial actions of others. Endeavouring to realise the totality of an Otherness, here inscribed by spirit form, is however unachievable. But to make the metaphysical resonate with magical power does not require full comprehension, and this is illustrated when surveying the formula used for describing the presence of spirits throughout history. As authors to our Otherness, the 11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR physical plane has been used as a reference point for mak­ing sense of the unknown. Accentuating appearance offers a vibrant version with incumbent potentialities for inter­vention. The conditions upon which manifestations occur depend on their physical composition. If there is something which makes them unusual or suggests an absence such as that of a missing limb, then their ability to breach the physi­cal world immediately becomes more likely. A singular semblance signifying pure Being cannot how­ever be testified to when assessing the vision's constitution. Nevertheless, their absences occupy our imagination. In particular, the causality behind their comportment is devel­oped from associative narratives. Detailing their existence, the narratives present a contextual parameter for the type of manifestation taking place. The afflicted form is then apprehended by employing an illocutionary force which asserts that any surviving accounts must include details about the trials and tribulations experienced. Qualifying an appearance is then determined by the proposition: that existence is contingent on acknowledging the instability in commensurate physicality. Appreciating the full extent of this co-existence is brought into relief by the experiential commonality existing between the two planes. Narratives detailing the plight of the subject's hidden world feature thematic reminiscences, which through mutual relevance, acknowledge a salient significance. Narratives on aflliction have seldom changed over the course of time and this allows an opportunity to review the reasons for its longevity as a symbolic indicator for \"Othering\" the unknown.

Exposing the body to potentialities across these three transfonnative states may have remained largely unchanged, however the explanations for why affliction occurs has evolved over a period of time. The manner in which a person, comes into contact with this Otherness, is not so remote, that people are unable to at least meet this notion of difference through their own reflection. The afflicted mirror constitutes the interplay between \"us\" and \"them\", \"I\" and \"you\". Signifying the intercon­necting differences and similarities gives us the ability to substantiate the extent to which we relate to the Other. One particular way of comprehending this difference can be understood by looking at one's own reflection. As we look into the mirror and see ourselves staring back, so we come to perceive our habitat from a particular position. If I stretch forth and touch my own reflection I do not sense myself, but the cold surface of glass, and yet this surface tells me some­thing about how I perceive another. The face that stares back has an innate resemblance to how I \"see\" myself, but does not match my impression of how I see myself. The reason for this is that when using the verb \"to see\" I render an in­tentional action with a reflexive capacity based on previous encounters. As a consequence when I say \"how I see myself\", followed by the subsequent decision to stand in front of the mirror, inevitably results in a retraction of the qualifier because I don't see myself in the same way all the time. Since I don't see myself as constituting a complete representation, how the reflection represents a partial me raises challenging questions about how one may perceive. For example, when 13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR moving towards the glass, my perception in terms of my rela­tion to the object gradually changes according to the shifting perspective, facilitated by my making an intentional move­ment. I become self-aware of the difference to myself in this moment, while also recognising a change in distance from the perceived sentient self of that which stares back at me. This self-awareness colonises the space around me, and by so doing, I continually assess in an attempt to make sense of my surroundings. Self-awareness extends beyond what I can see, since I embody a summation of my surroundings, there­fore I come to know myself despite having only part of me in view. In this moment my perception makes for an incom­plete image. As I proceed to look outside of my reflection, where there should be connectivity, I find an overwhelming remoteness, especially when comparing myself to the other world looking back. Being unable to observe my location in all of its detail, without having panoramic vision, suggests certain inaccuracies when compared to my previous encoun­ters with the same space. For I have known this room from many different aspects as I have tended to my daily activities, and yet the room as it appears to me now through reflection only reveals a partial presence. The possible reasons for this are many. Have I already predicated the reflection with an anticipatory impression of what I will see? Does the room appear at odds with my experience because the physical engagement with the space has always entailed intentional occupancy? Maybe it is the case that the perspective I am now beholden to is due to the intentional stance of wanting to 1urvey a possible version of my Otherness? The probable •n1wer from asking all these questions is yes, and yet they do not alt neatly as sequential qualifiers on how one comes to 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction occupy a pre-designated space. This reflection then has no apparent feelings or emotions that I am aware of because of its partial absence to me. Yet through its remoteness to me as a sentient being, I find that I respond to the absences as part of an innate but not fully quantifiable reflex. I am drawn to this Self that stares back at me, I invade its absence with my imagination and arrive at a stand-off between the logic of this being nothing more than a challenging reflection, and there being something more which can be harnessed. By implanting the absence with an alternative presence, I make it become what I imagine it will be. This, neither confines its potential, nor inhibits its ability to move independently of me. Whether it will or not is neither here nor there, it is more important to know how this image of Self becomes the Other, in the moment when I give it an independence to decide its own choice of movement. Placed ever further into a stylised form of Otherness, the person who stares back also touches the mirror at the same time, our movements suggesting an agentive synchrony. Re­sponsive and yet passive to my emotional advances our two different worlds collide and compress on the surface of the glass, yet retain a connection through partial similarity. Even when some agreement seems to have been silently reached on what our reflection will or won't do, it is never far away from our immediate perception of Self, that the other might move without any instruction being given by the authorial viewer. There is then an Otherness to that which appears in the reflection and this is recognised by our conscious stance. And while we believe we have a semblance of control over the situation, with it being governed by preconceived rules, the chance of some unusual happening which calls into ques-15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR tion the steadiness of our perception can never totally be dismissed. In the same way as seeing oneself, the afflicted mirror is a metaphor for our partial ability to see the world in its entirety. Evidence for this partial, yet fully enveloping no­tion about how we perceive, tends to manifest when depict­ing deformed Gods and spirits. By having only a partial ap­pearance the image of Otherness defines our notion about what it means to be complete and incomplete. Odin having only one eye illustrates the ability of deformation to mean something more than having simply lost his sight. In trading his eye for wisdom, the deformation appears as an afflicted marker which signals not only his divine other-worldly dif­ference to mortal man, but the acquisition of powers embod­ied by having been deformed. In this way, Odin symbolically represents a form of Otherness. While his disfigurement of­fers us an opportunity to make an existential connection to his physicality, it also provides further substance for identi­fying differences between ourselves and those who reside in the metaphysical. Our not knowing or being able to perceive the totality of their Being, presents an opportunity to be­lieve in their capacity to intervene in our lives. And it is here amongst various expressions about deformity that the body takes on a fantastical aspect when combined with a spiritual Otherness. In the absence of completion, by providing only a partial reflection, the role of the hidden or what remains silent is suddenly occupied by a different kind of potential. As the emptiness reveals itself so we feel a compulsion to make sense of what we don't see. By assigning qualities to absence people imaginatively reassemble dissociative powers to cre-16"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction ate a new order. There is therefore a certain irony to this endeavour. Gaining efficacy by colonising the empty space shifts the absences into appearing as deformities. It would seem spirits and Gods alike cannot be left to inhabit their absence without suffering from human intervention. Intervention should not however be thought of as origi­nating solely from the physical side. Our knowledge of an Otherness, with singular or plural dimensions, is placed be­fore us as an object upon which to reflect. Through the me­dium of appearance, the spirits and Gods converge around uncanny aspects of life that are regarded as having the abil­ity to attract our attention. Their distorted forms resemble images which have been refracted by the consciousness of another. Using the means by which their existence can be ac­knowledged as a definite reality, they are compelled to exert an impression which obtains a degree of emphatic recogni­tion from the physical world. Grotesque portrayals convey not only a summation of potential. For in becoming afflicted a link is established be­tween experience and the physicality of life. In Forms of De­formity, Lynn Holden examines how angels and demons have been represented. By focusing on physical abnormalities in a number of Orthodox texts she argues that the purpose of deformity in texts is to confuse, elucidate and transform the world. 1 The loss or contortion of a body part lends qravitas to this endeavour. By placing the stress on the part of the anat­omy which has the most prominent role in a narrative, she doesn't so much highlight an absence rather than accentuate its presence. And we may here have the nub to our fascina-1 Holden, L. 1991. Forms of Deformity.

Each engagement establishes the extent to which the dif­ferences between presence and absence have been bridged. The interlocutory narrative is designed to undertake the responsibility of transforming this perceived separation in order to qualify its contribution. Raising particularly inter­esting questions about what dispositions are suitable when attempting to facilitate congress with Otherness, the narra­tive acts as the go-between meshing as it develops, intrinsic principles for engagement. In an attempt to extend the prac­tical field so as to match the action of alteration within a con­text, it is important to look at how these narratives become interlocutory. In many any cases it is not the author but the words written, describing the appearance of the Other which makes the extraordinary feel real. The style and drama, as well as the predicative unwritten assumptions, drive the account in a particular direction and thereby contribute towards the making of something differ­ent. If the physical disposition is then conducive for actual­ising change, it becomes possible to examine the choice of words which make the Other a substantial reality. This gives us the opportunity to then explore ideas about the compo­sition of Self as well as the Other. Affliction thus becomes a focal point for this discussion because it presents an ob­vious juncture for gauging the extent of Otherness. While affliction addressed as an event provides some detail about the prevailing conditions, it inevitably leads to limiting the scope of this enquiry. A greater insight can however be 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction gained by overriding the event with an account of the cir­cumstances leading up to the event along with what sub­sequently followed. When the narrative is allowed to move beyond the event moment, it qualifies its interlocutory role by producing a multitude of relevant points of reference for further extrapolation. When describing an event, the premise of the narrated ac­count involves detailing what took place at the time. Often the initial contact, circumscribed by defining it as an event, occurs when the few who witnessed the moment proclaim that they were present. As a result, the event is always con­veyed through retrospection. Trying to capture the moment therefore involves having to expand out from the event itself. · Venturing into the actions leading up to, during and after the event, enables the narrative to encompass the circum­stances surrounding the moment. In fact, the event only be­comes an event for most, once the drama of the moment has passed. Relaying details to another requires a context which in turn predicates how the information is reconfigured into something which has meaning. Substantiating the narrative relies on inbuilt illocutionary mechanisms which stratify in­formation. Extrapolating from the event moment, in order to produce a wider deliberative remit, requires having to give an account of the run up to the moment of contact. Obvious elaborations are therefore not developed in isolation to prob­ability. As a consequence the combining of elaboration with probability enhances the narrative's potential agency. If this action can then be emplotted by describing how people situ­ate themselves then we should be able to constitute affliction in diachronic terms. But how will this help our investiga­tion? It is because all accounts of affliction show life stories 19"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR as following a prescribed cyclical course of temporality, in­terspersed by fragmented moments of clarity which are then duly followed by a partial re-assembling of the Self. And it is here amongst the analytical and descriptive detail located within an inherently unstable process for articulating the unknown, that we come to understand our torrid relation­ship with the metaphysical. Considering how specific aspects coruscate from a nar­rative, it is useful to examine the underlying assumptions being made about the order of things. With any generative narrative the author tends towards following a linear devel­opmental line, which has at its premise the desire to produce concordance. This acknowledges a principle of order which informs how facts are arranged. In opposition to a narrative's developmental stage, which relies on this semblance of order to create structural parameters, there is to be found, located within an inevitable discordance which details the up surge in misfortune or change. Positioned in a place which exem­plifies the difference, discordance challenges the anticipated trajectory of interplay and by doing so gives the plot a trans­formative quality. This allows the reader to track the devel­opment of the narrative from initial situation to terminus. The narrative then explicates a torturous route, encourag­ing the reader to become emotionally engaged. Only then can \"the end\" be found to have a satisfactory conclusion. While the dual aspect of order and disorder designate literal movement with all of its accompanying twists and turns, the mutual exclusivity exhibited does not ignore the possibility of conjoining the two into discordant-concordance. A vital aspect to the composition of the narrative the discordant­concordance synthesises emphasises the heterogeneous 20"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction elements within the text. These oppositions manifest a pre-configured crooked course, which enables the reader to participate in the expounding of the narrative. For such an undertaking to work requires the emplotment to obfuscate all possible contingencies, in effect how things could have happened, and it achieves this by replacing the multiplicity of possibilities with a centralised necessity. To make afflic­tion therefore work, to have it stand out from other more common activities and daily interactions, the necessity ap­pears as something surprising or remarkable. The necessity to act in a specific way, to respond in an appropriate fashion to demands being made, only appears retrospectively, since what proceeds must have already occurred before being pre­sented as part of the requisite evidence for transfiguration. The spectacle of a spirit or God lacking a complete physi­cal semblance pertains to this notion of a discordant-concor­dant image within the narrative. Lacking a partial physical presence to the one we think matches our own perception of Being informs the interpretative outcome. Rodney Need­ham in Reconnaissances identifies an object's absence as the \"unilateral figure\" .2 Examining extant material evidence on partial physical assemblages, he studies personages who consist of one physical side. These personages are depicted as having one eye, one arm and one leg on the same side. In its asymmetrical quasi-human form, he suggests particular spirits and Gods obtain a special place in our imagination. Not all the examples cited below retain such a distinct asymmetry, because underlying the asymmetrical aspect there can be found a causality which informs the reflective 2 Needham, R. i980.

What is ev­ident from Needham's work is that the unilateral figure uses as its template the human form. This is interesting to con­sider, when the Other is expected to be exhibiting stark dif­ferences to the common perception about the body. It is pos­sible to surmise that the Other appears in our image because it can only be made into Other by using the human form as a reflective foil. Such a close association between the meta­physical and physical is cited by Needham when he refers to Plato's Symposium. Of particular interest is how human beings came into existence. To begin with human beings as we know ourselves now were originally joined to another hu­man. We had four hands with an equal number of legs, two identical faces, as well as double back and flanks and these together made the human form into a complete circle. In this absolute state of completeness their strength was insur­mountable and so it was that in their arrogance they attacked the Gods. Zeus was so outraged at this sign of rebellion that he cut them in two and in doing so made them weaker. And so it was that Zeus threatened them with a further division if they dared to show such disdain for his authority again. Un­der the auspices of his authority, humanity would come to understand the moral dilemma of causing further infringe­ments by being afflicted. The anecdotal quality of this tale follows a strict linear de­velopment from concordance to discordance, with the end result that these conjoin in the issuing of a lasting threat, if further infringements should ever occur. 3 Under conditions which threaten the integrity of the corporeal form enables 'f Needham 1980:28. 22"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction the extent of our subjectivity to determine the accuracy of our assessments objectively. The dialogue between the dif­ferent afflicted forms all point to the continual renegotiation of our and their existence across punctuated moments in time. If time is moving continuously in forward motion then the ability to capture a moment, where everything seems to stand still has to become a priority. Of course arresting time is never completely achieved, yet during our daily activities many people find time to rest on a point provincially. Caus­ing these ruptures in the time continuum can attract the attention of our Otherness. In the same moment however, time continues to pull the Self and our Other along in its current, and by so doing it becomes almost impossible to ap­pear as complete, especially as a semblance of Self is left in the suspended moment. If this is true then time creates its own distortions, and as our perception of Self is stretched so we become ever more detached from ourselves. Having attempted to capture moments from within an undisputed time continuum, it follows that corresponding corporeal as­pects change or become deformed from having a self-consti­tuted predisposition towards wanting to fragment time into parallel equivalents.

Cast beyond the physical world this utter dif­ference to ourselves is only made so by retaining attributes which equate to our perception of Self. Resembling what we might expect to see but with accompanying deformation en­sures engagement. Not only does this open up the opportu­nity to extrapolate the conditions of their existence, but it also reflects back onto us. Informing decisions on how we use their form and the ways they have been represented ce­ments our relationship to them. Physical and metaphysical differences rather than repelling the Other draw each closer by depending on the Other. The notion of absences, defor­mity, and abnormality all of which are encapsulated by the term affliction, generate the terms and conditions for self­preservation through reciprocity. With a binding degree of wanting to explore and learn from a realised Otherness, gives their manifested form certain potency. Our belief in their ex­istence is made more robust by the Other representing an utterly different corporeal figure from anything that we can embody independently. Yet the emotive response to narrated circumstance creates empathy for the Other's plight, and as the viewer finds comparisons or similarities to his or her ev­eryday circumstance, so overtime, the nothingness becomes colonised with appropriate agentive knowledge. Chapter 1, The Afflicted Gods, explores the spirits' alterity to our aspectual givenness. Here the specificity of contextu­alised engagement with the Other is emphasised. Arguing that through the spirits deformity we come to understand our relationship to the occult, so an explanation is given on how the hidden becomes partially visible. The conditions for affliction then become the vehicle for realising not only their 24"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction existence but also our involvement in their fate. Bound as we are to specific ways of knowing them, so the Other depicts power through injury. Citing examples from Catholic hagi­ography to Haitian Vodou, from the making of fetishes in West Africa's Benin to the witchcraft accounts of deforma­tion in the early modern period of history, the role of afflic­tion is demonstrated as having never strayed very far from being about defining power through the appearance of de­formation. Establishing the relevant descriptive detail on af­fliction further enhances the argument, that any embodied affliction in the physical domain reflects aspects of the spir­its condition. This does not necessarily mean there has to be a direct correlation between affliction types, but it does show there is a propensity to replicate the condition, especially when making the existence of the Other a genuine concern. Chapter 2, Ajjliction in its Maqico-Social Context, describes how affliction is used to measure the appropriateness of the candidate to serve the spirits. Drawing on fieldwork carried out in Haiti in the 1990s, the experience of being afflicted is brought to life through Renold, a Haitian Vodou priest. Using this as an anchor point, the chapter counters Lewis' approach in Ecstatic Reliqions to forms of affliction by ques­tioning his assumptions about the relationship between af­fliction and resource acquisition. Undercutting affliction as a provincial rite of passage allows for an exploration into the importance of having to endure the ordeal. Highlighted as a key aspect in the transformation of a person into a ritual specialist, the chapter focusses on examples of resistance. It will be argued that it is resistance which eventually makes the role of the oungan or mambo powerful. Only by endur­ing the ordeal can the candidate be thought of as having 25"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR been genuinely contacted and chosen by the spirits. Once in­stalled as a spirit representative, the ritual specialist works as the conduit for the spirits. Attending to the people's needs, by acting as the go between, ensures that the ritual specialist becomes the very mirror into which people must look so as to gain counsel from the other side. These are the broad pa­rameters into which we will venture, in an attempt to better understand the role of affliction in any spiritual enterprise. And yet within these outlined constraints are opportunities to establish similitude between disparate or distinct forms of magical practice. With the persecution of witches in the early modern pe­riod there is evidence, without over reaching, that people acknowledged and continue to recognise a metaphorical di­vide separating us from the world of spirits. Such a divide, the very mirror itself, the crossroads to which we must all eventually arrive, does not only act as the point into which we inter our hopes and aspirations to serve and learn, but it reflects back upon us notions about Self and Otherness. In Chapter 3, The Pact and the Witches Mark, the topic of affliction adopts a slightly different and yet complemen­tary approach to the previous chapters. Examining some of the historical evidence the chapter explores how the witch's mark became part of the demonological discourse of the time. In particular, this inclusion popularised the notion of the witch as being diabolical, in addition to perpetuating the idea of there being an Otherness. Portrayed as embodying an integral immorality ensured witches were usually portrayed as having an aversion towards civilisation with all of its as­sociative moral etiquette. This 'Othering' meant they came to represent the conduit for accessing the metaphysical.

Having a philosophical derivation, the purpose of Otherness is to establish a dis­tance from Self, which otherwise might generate confusion when referring to Gods and spirits. By stripping the flesh from the bone, the object of this design is to present an ex­posed referential template. This should allow the reader to generate their own set of signifiers by drawing from signifi­cant aspects of their lifeworld. It is therefore not the author's intention to explicate comprehensive global comparisons by applying the theory presented amongst these pages. As such it is not the responsibility of the author to suggest the appro­priateness of application by citing a multitude of examples from across the world. Avoiding the temptation to draw on a cross-cultural selection of deracinated archetypes has ironi­cally produced its own selection of absences. Awaiting your 4 Zika, C. 2007.

It should therefore become apparent during the course of The Afflicted Mirror that this is a non-reductive exploration on how to comprehend affliction. What becomes evident throughout the text is the reliance on intersubjectivity for differentiating Self and the Other. Without discounting one for the other, affliction depends upon dialogic interaction between the two. This not only influences the outcome, but predicates what will be looked for in the first place. An un­derlying conclusion from evidence cited below is that afflic­tion appears to be an expression of people's desire to make claims about their world, and in particular, their perceived ownership over it. Whether this manifests, when discuss­ing the condition of Gods and spirits or the ordeal as expe­rienced by a Haitian Vodou priest, the same claim can be made, that whatever position the Other maybe to the sub­ject, the conclusion ultimately rests with us acknowledging the Other as influencing the constitution of the Self. If we as­sume this meta-narrative informs this exploration, then the absences or presences, both of which embody an impression of something which we assign as significant, becomes the foil by which we reflect the metaphysical and the physical back onto ourselves. Reflection is then the key attribute to this work along with changing contingencies and time selected circumstan­tial conditions. And while these provide a broad base upon which to build a satisfactory explanation, they do nothing to deter the implicit differences between worlds apprehended by Self.

Indeed it is not the intention of this book to con­solidate the two, but rather explain that it is in their alterity to one another than we come to have a relationship with the metaphysical. Knowing something about another can never satiate the innate human desire for acquiring more knowledge. The af­flicted body then stands as a testament for knowing some­thing more than the observer. As an object of desire it har­nesses its terror to dissuade the fool from trying to press home any physical advantage. What we are then left with is a stand-off between presence and absence. These do not en­capsulate a totality of Being however, but reveal half formed apparitions which move and change in response to the de­mands being made upon them. They \"become\", when there is an anticipated expectation that they actually exist. It is therefore through the use of the narrative that accounts of affliction hold steady against the thrust of passing time. Act­ing as receptacles, narratives present the reader with an op­portunity to survey and analyse the contingencies employed when attempting to contain an inherently fragile lifeworld. While the impact of affliction creates in the aftermath a narrative about the importance of ordeal, it also carries a cautionary subtext for those who actively pursue the per­ceived advantages of becoming a practitioner. Often over­looked by self-claimed magicians, lies the important at­tribute of humility, and while historicity is saturated with accounts of humility as an indelible indicator of correct se­lection, extant reports about its ability to disarm accusations of egotism by effacing self-aggrandisement are more often than not ignored.

This however has not stopped the fascination for the abnormal or afflicted form from being used as a metaphor for comprehending that which lies be­yond our visible world. Grotesque forms draw attention away from morality and direct the observer towards possible reasons for their ap­parent immoral disembodiment. Appearing as a corporeal distortion allays any sense of loss since the imbalance of dis­articulation is countered by an increase in aspectual potenti­alities. This only makes itself known through the accompa­nying narrative which details specific characteristics about their 'becoming'. Filling in the otherwise vacant form with probability eases affliction away from negative connotation. As it pushes past deformity as a limitation, so it becomes possible to establish a platform for exploring the symbolic metaphysical meanings, which have up until now, been hin­dered by occultation. Authors have across the centuries clothed the gods and spirits with reason and intent which has made them ap­pear as transparent entities. Imbibing their attributes with an encompassing visual totality has ensured gravitas, but it has also resulted in obscuring the nature of absence in their figuration. How they came to be placed in relation to other entities and even to ourselves began to take shape when the Other underwent a stylistic restriction. Instead of including a representation's inconsistency, as an added expression of Otherness, it became the norm for people to illustrate the \"true nature\" of spirits by characterising them as being hu­man in form and attitude. Under these circumstances, tran­sitive moments of contact considered as being important, resulted in the development of human personalities with a"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Afflicted Gods complementary comportment towards others. Yet during the selective process, aspects which together made for the contorted form, brought on from having been afflicted, were increasingly censored so as to make them appear more hu­man. Rather than seeking to perpetuate this version where si­lences brought on by affliction are avoided, the afflicted aspect of the spirits or Gods appearance, personality and agency are accentuated to act as a counter balance to this prevailing representation. Accounts of affliction detailing how they came to lose their totality, punctuated only by the silences in the text, provide the background by which to as­sess the reasons for their appearance as being wounded. Nar­ratives about the Gods and spirits have therefore depended on recounting life stories in a way which retain significance for current audiences. By doing so, narratives supply the reader with the appropriate contextual substance. Develop­ing specific themes based on their form will ensure subse­quent elaborations chasten the extraordinary dimension of the strange with parts more commonly associated with the everyday. Audiences are thereby given the means by which to juxtapose themselves to a metaphysical counterpart. Physical and metaphysical conditions then appear as an exaggerated difference in Being. The capacity of the narra­tive to close this gulf is achieved by focussing upon certain commonalities. In short, it is the word itself which becomes capable of endorsing our imagination and the subsequent engagement with the Other.

Images and descriptive depictions of these entities are made more human through injury. The fragile state of life with its daily pressure diminishes the possibility of accessing a complete semblance of meaning. Dwelling in a space con­figured by time, with all of its inaccuracies and embellish­ments, demarcates them as being closer to us than we first imagine. Through affliction their deformity resonates with our everyday life experiences. Our commonalities become explicit, especially when we realise that it is not only our dif­ference to one another but our similarity which defines \"us\" and\"them\". Suffering at great times of stress when our conviction to do the right thing is placed in jeopardy, or when our self­affirmed authority is suddenly deposed by another, can result in feeling like we have been scarred for life. Are not these depictions of affliction mimicking or better reflecting our own ordeal when trying to make sense of the world? Are the spirits telling us that we are not alone in our plight as we struggle? In this instance the tales accompanying their transfiguration provide us with explicit details on how they came to be, and how they continue to mirror our own on­going transformation. There is in this connection between the world seen and unseen a finely polished mirror which reflects back upon both parties an explanation on how we came to dwell amongst others, as well as how we came to be self-aware.

Only by retaining an edge, in that, we cannot know everything about them or their condi­tion, does it become possible for them to exert a presence. This not only invites supplication but is accompanied by the threat of retribution if we do not attend to their needs. If this assessment does indeed prove to be accurate then we must assume our commonality masks an altogether different de­termining factor when trying to comprehend the formation of our path. Inhabiting this world and creating a suitable environment for creativity relies heavily on us being able to negotiate with our Otherness. The absence of a total image, one bereft of perfection, forewarns what may befall if we be­come overly complacent. For although we may face the same fate they are further down the track than where we currently find ourselves. Ordeals endured are for the most part yet to be experienced. And it is this distance between us which has tended to place them at the margins of society. Like the lep­er, they dwell at the edges, in the wild country, those places where civilisation and its savage resentment for imagining the old ways has yet to make landfall. Many of the spirits however still bear the scars from coming into contact with modernity and the forced migration from their homelands. Detailed experiences about how these afflictions came about are conveyed through surviving narratives. Deter­mining our understanding of their plight, these texts colour specific ways of knowing, and yet by them favouring the un­canny over normality allows for a partial revealing of their hidden constitution.

Being more akin to what we would recognise as the ailments of old age threatens to limit our own sense of Self by not being able to fully fathom the inevi­table. In Legba's condition, the image of a stoic man resolute in his resolve to not only stand firm at the crossroads encour­ages the reader, the watcher, and initiate to commend their empathic sensibilities onto others. Finding the connection that can be made between man and spirits gives our afflicted mirror the ability to reflect back an Otherness onto ourselves while simultaneously projecting forth a range of absences. It is somewhere in this transaction of presences and absences, introducing differently positioned reflective forms, that our \"becoming\" is provoked into making itself known. The afflicted form of Legba not only establishes the frame­work for understanding the seen world but gives us the keys for unlocking the world beyond. The gradual diminishment of Legba's form presents the affliction as being an outward sign of passing time, and this is never more explicit than in Deren's depiction of him when wracked by age, he appears as someone who has already started to be consumed by mag­gots. 6 The gradual consumption of the body makes Legba into a vibrant spectacle even at the moment of his demise. The self-realisation of encroaching age being detrimental to physical ability challenges this vision, because it is difficult to imagine the deleterious effects of age encapsulating vital-5 Deren, M. 1953/2004.

Yet it is here in the distorted form, at the confrontational epicentre of our own Being, and in direct contradistinction to Legba, where we come to recognise ourselves through his reflection. Everyday life experiences take on new mean­ing when placed under these new expansive conditions for knowing the world. When remembering Legba and the encroachment of physical absence, we consign him to a disappearing appa­rition and because of this we begin to know ourselves and the potential impact of affliction upon our own body. In the full glare of an ordeal, the link which connects us to them is made more apparent through our remembrance of the Oth­er's condition. Further ordination of Legba's physical condition can be found in the descriptions of St. Jude and St. Lazarus since both of these are his hagiographic equivalents. St. Jude as Saint for the Hopeless and Despaired is depicted as carrying the staff. St.Lazarus is shown supporting his body by using a staff and is commonly seen as a poor emaciated lame man known by many as the carer of lepers. Amongst these seem­ingly disparate images common motifs abound. Such a syn­thesis according to Haitian Vo dou iconography relies heavily on the Catholic saints for its imagery. This synthesis to physical condition has resulted in Leg­ba being associated with the poor, lost and forgotten peo­ple. Each emanation testifies its resemblance to the others through a sense of an overwhelming loss of Being. Afflicted by everyday forms of absence the physical ailments symbol­ise gradual consumptive degradation of the Self. Through these representations, the embodying of affliction tells us about the otherworldly qualities being held within the story. 41"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR These are firmly ensconced behind the afflictive condition and are used as symbolic markers. Guiding people into a po­sition where their own state of Being relies on these markers as referential points, only goes to amplify Legba as the gate­keeper. Generating a resolution capability presents Legba as having the ability to relate his experiences to those of his fol­lowers. For this interconnectivity to work the afflicted mirror must signify its portents by anticipating the everyday frailty of the physical world. The same can be said for Legba's con­dition, for his power to mean anything, he must embody ele­ments of the everyday and the future struggle for survival, so as to reduce the physical distance between himself and the physical world. Measuring the connectivity between the visible and invis­ible, by using physicality as a signifier, brings another aspect to the fore. There appears to be good reason to believe there is a ratio in physical difference when it comes to observing how the metaphysical manifests partial presences. Exponen­tial distortions correspond to how we retain a level of contact with the Other. When these abnormalities become exagger­ated they prompt greater emotive responses, such as fear. By expressing an Otherness in this manner their difference takes on a terrifying dimension which also indicates power. This is illustrated by Legba as Leqba Do Miwa which refers to his position to us as the \"Legba behind the mirror\". The impression given through the use of this epithet is that he is literally there on the other side of the door, all one needs to do is open it. Moreover the reflective aspect bears no general sign of being afflicted whereas Leqba Pie Case or \"Legba with the broken leg\" is described as being the commander to an 42"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Affiicted Gods army of demonic forces. 7 It would seem the manifestation of the affliction measured by its severity corresponds to the type of spiritual power the spirits wield. In Legba with the broken leg's case this amounts to his associated demonic forces also taking on terrible deformed states of being. These are however far more removed from the physical domain, and operate to exaggerate a further removal or distancing from the everyday reflection of Legba. 8 Illustrating a further separation from typical normali­ties, the demonic forces identified as baka are regarded as being small red-eyed, fleshless creatures with their skin be­ing bisected into black and red and then stretched over their bones. Under the cover of darkness they are thought to roam the roads and country tracks looking for people to eat. Ex­hibiting such threatening behaviour towards others makes them further removed from life's condition which may ex­plain their extraordinary appearance. If this is true then Leg­ba must have through his affliction the ability to open dif­ferent aspects of the road connecting the two worlds. In fact this suggests the existence of countless crossroads populated by various manifestations of Legba, with each ever more in­credible affliction corresponding to departures in affiliated form. The strangeness or difference to a norm as perceived 7 Desmangles, L. 1992. The Faces of the Gods: Vo dou and Roman Catholicism in Haiti.

So while the distancing from the physical may indeed lead to greater exaggerated depictions of affliction, the lwa are capable of manifesting their physical absence by contorting and debilitating the body of their host. In this way the absence retains a potential to become a presence in an instant. 43"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR by others contributes towards garnering alien attributes. Each apparition accentuates its otherness to us through its absence and general deformity. Alfred Metraux in Vo odoo in Haiti says the baka can appear as cats, dogs, pigs, cows and monsters with the latter being so foul they defy description. 9 One cited story he tells concerns the fate of a man, who on his way home at night finds a small child crying by the side of the road. Taken with pity he returns home with the child. On arrival the child begins to grow and grow until his legs are dragging along the ground, only then does it make itself known to the family as a baka and in that moment spares them from being consumed.10 Rather than focussing singularly on deformation, this narrative details the proceedings leading up to entrapment. Juxtapositioning moral with immoral intent means the true immorality of the baka can only emerge once the transfor­mation has taken place. In this case the integrity of the ba­ka's Otherness to the human condition signifies a moment where absence declares a presence in the making of the Self. For it is in the baka's difference that we see ourselves more dearly and are thereby able to negotiate our presences with perceived absences. Another great and formative figure in the Vo dou pan­theon is Ezili and it could be that she offers the greatest de­tail on various types of affliction and how this relates to the human condition. Karen McCarthy Brown in Mama Lola identifies two of the main manifestations of Ezili, although there are countless others. For her at least two of the primary 9 Metraux, A. 1959. Vo odoo in Haiti.

Each of these has a Catholic com­parison to the Virgin Mary, Nuestra Senora de la Caridad del Cobre and Mater Salvatoris. 11 Ezili is an earthly sp iritual manifestation and is therefore easier to approach on a daily basis when needing assistance. Encapsulating the emotive states of care, love, anger, frustration, sensuality and lone­liness, she is the mother and warrior, both maternal and frightening. McCarthy Brown considers these female spirits to \"mirror and map\" the everyday circumstances we all face which in turns make them comprehensible. Providing direc­tion and judgement on how to deal with any given situation which surfaces across the course of time, Ezili becomes the mother to all. Her composure is nevertheless fragile and it can easily dissipate at a moment's notice. Lasyrenn is depicted as a fleeting presence, submerged beneath the waves she dwells as a dark mass at the back of the mirror. Ga:z.ing at her is like ga:z.ing at your truer picture of self than is likely to be fo und in the mirrors of everyday life. But it is also dangerous to try and get too close or hold on too tightly to the vision. A person who reaches out to stroke her or tries to lie close by her broad and comfort­ing side may, quite simply, drown. 12 Lasyrenn may not be strictly afflicted but there is something to this description which matches the presence and absence 11 McCarthy Brown, K. 1991. Mama Lola: A Vo dou Priestess tn Brooklyn. Berkeley: University of California Press. u Ibid., p. 223. 45"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR previously mentioned. This image which incorporates a uniltateral impression amounts to her dark side appearing in dreams, while her white side appears when peering into the depths of the ocean. A salient motif for Lasyrenn is her association with drowning, and there is some narrative evidence which sug­gests this particular descriptive development derives from slaves who drowned during their forced migration across the middle passage. This submergence extends to people disap­pearing for three days only to reappear as initiates. During their absence from the physical world the spirits provide in­struction on sacred knowledge. Although no lasting afflic­tion appears to take hold, the initiate emerges knowing that any deviation from his or her chosen path will inevitably lead to provoking the spirits wrath. Ezili Danto has a more explicit afflicted capacity since she cannot speak because her tongue was cut out by French colo­nialists during their occupation of Haiti. The corresponding attributes and afflicted state is shown in the image of the Ma­ter Salvatoris as the Black Virgin Our Lady of Czestochowa. On her right cheek there are two vertical scars. According to Leslie Desmangles in Faces of the Gods, these scars represent her suffering and loneliness which appeared after Christ was crucified. 13 For in her arms as the Black Virgin she is seen holding the Christ child. Further extrapolations are made when viewing the sign or veve for Ezili Danto which char­acteristically illustrates a dagger through the heart, thus in­fe rring emotions more commonly associated with loss, suf­fering and sorrow. There is also some gossip which tells that 13 Desmangles i992:142-143."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Afflicted Gods she actually received these scars from a fight that occurred between Ezili Freda, Ogun and Ezili Danto. 14 Although a caring spirit, Ezili Danto has the ability to unleash a torrent of anger towards devotees. Characterised by McCarthyBrown as a \"maternal anger\" she is capable of unleashing an irrepressible rage upon her attendees, which at times can lack any coherent rational explanation. It may be because of this uncontrollable compulsion to lash out that she has been described by some as a baka. Evidence that this may be the case is indicated by making sure she does not come into contact with blood. Even if she is witness to a sacrifice, and she sees the blood, she immediately becomes wildly aggressive. Given her unstable temperament, she is often used, with great effect, in practises where the immedi­ate implementation of a curse is required to level the life of another. Ezili Danto's appearance resembles a woman who has suf­fered, who has known what it means to have experienced loss. Her physical form however has remained relatively complete other than maybe the scars suggesting a darker ordeal. There are however, other Ezili forms, placed on the margins of daily Vo dou practice which show more signifi­cant signs of physical affliction than that suffered by La­syrenn or Ezili Dan to. Desmangles describes Metre's Ezili as an old woman who is so physically decrepit that to stand she relies on the sup­port of a cane. In the same vein as Legba, her body is terribly deformed. Suffering from arthritis she apparently trembles 14 Rey, T. 1999. Our Lady vf Class Struqqle: The Cult of the Vi rqin Mary in Haiti.

In an attempt to ease the gap between the physi­cal form and her incomplete manifestation, her devotees sing to her a plaintive song so as to illustrate their empathic understanding towards her condition: Ezili, I have no bones (to support me) I have no bones Ezili, oh! I have no bones in all my body Ezili, oh! I have no bones Metres replies: Metres Ezili in back of the gate (of Ginen) I speak, speak and they refuse to listen to me I speak, speak, my children. Ezili in back of the gate I speak, speak they refuse to listen to me. 15 Heartfelt in its acknowledgement of her physical absence the song identifies the source of her sorrow. The overwhelm­ing culmination of her physical ailments, embodying an intractable and yet visible frustration, which testifies to her potency being partially spent galvanises her sense of loss. In this embodied position to her Otherness she is able to realise and disconnect her Self from alterity. For it is the absence through formulated poesis, enhancing the perception by having no bones, that opens the way for extrapolating her condition.

Encap­sulating the interior void of Being means the evident power she retains derives from not being able to achieve her goals. Denied physically from having the appropriate attributes, the absence introduces a different notion about Otherness to the audience. When responding to the words as enunci­ated by the attending company, Metres acknowledges what she already knows as disempowerment, thereby identifying the source of her absence. Straddling presence and absence in this dynamic way the manner in which she acknowledges her condition is only partial. As much as there is a reluc­tant acceptance, she shows fortitude to endure by refusing to totally accept her situation. But does the lack of total ac­knowledgement to current circumstance open the narrative up to further potentialities? In Metres' case it does because the response confirms not only the disability but how it im­pacts on another important aspect of Being, the incapacity to communicate with others. Afflictions associated with crippling deformation brought on by the ravages of time presents to the observer, whether attendee or devotee, a stage in life where a sense of what it means to be powerful gradually diminishes. Dissipation of this kind does not however mean an absolute loss, for what we witness in the case of Metres is a spirit in transition. The reference to being ignored at the back of the gate therefore constitutes avoidance by the living to face the inevitable fat­ed deterioration of their physicality. Although she may re­main unheard, her constitution by being silenced does noth­ing to limit her significance. Rather, the decoupling from the physical world through protracted attempts to communicate without success, places the emphasis on the physical world 49"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR to attend to her needs. Remedying the apparent imbalance or possible distance between worlds, accentuates differences about what it means to Be, and yet the overarching senti­ment clearly invites our attention to placate and thereby ease her loss. In an attempt to reach forth and participate in the afterlife, the back of the gate becomes, through the identifi­cation of the affliction, a contorted web of paradoxes. This is especially made so by the power Metres is capable of wield­ing. Desmangles tells of devotees supplicating her once she has made an appearance so as to reduce the risk of facing her wrath. It would seem it is her deformed Otherness to those who approach which ultimately ensures they adopt the cor­rect composure. Mindful of her ability to inflict harm, the frustration at being afflicted acts as the catalyst by which she becomes powerful. Amidst the deformation she 'becomes'. Her burgeoning strength channelling through floundering weakness, evokes an inner resolve, by which she ultimately prevails, as a partial presence lying at the edge of land be­tween the dead and the living. Absences and physical deformities appearing at the point where affliction becomes a representation of something other than itself is not confined to Haiti. The exterior-in­terior tension between appearance and narrative has been systematically embodied across many parts of the world. For in this tension between, what initially appears as a physi­cal deformity and the accompanying meaning to be gained in the subsequent generated narrative, has allowed special qualities to emerge which inform the depiction.

From surface to depth differentials, to notions about how the viewer claims ownership over the image, ensures the condition of affliction will present opportunities for under­standing the relationship between the two worlds. In the Haitian portrayals of absence brought on by afflic­tion the descriptive quality has the ability to generate a sense of depth to the subject. Rather than confining the represen­tation to a flat one-dimensional form, the narrative carves contours into the body. As a consequence the body becomes an inconsistent mass. The same can be said for claiming ownership over the image. Whether a fetish or a lwa, each depend on the amount of time invested in developing sig­nificances that resonate with the viewer's perspective. Pre­suppositions may determine the acquisition of the affliction and what it means, but what these unforeseen primary de­terminants predicate leads to unanticipated illumination. Accomplished by transferring the Self into an Other, one can imagine, even when taking into consideration inherent inaccuracies, what it means to physically experience the af­flicted condition. Partial realisations consequently suggest a certain irony in the application of our absences when consid­ering this transferal exercise. Displacing the Self by imagin­ing an embodied grotesque vision allows for the possibility to explore other germane characteristics associated with af­fliction, being as it is an expressive form for empowerment. Endorsing the displacement of Self to an imagined loca­tion reveals new modal ranges for knowing. Notions about containment, exclusion, masking, openness, displacement, synthesis, control and ambiguity all indicate the ability of af­fliction to address the aspectual givenness to Being.

It is important therefore to not lose the apperceptive anchorage by which one can discern the genuine nature of the object. Maybe it is not even in the eventual discerning of the threat which is truly important, but the capacity of the bochio to disorientate any pending equilibrium up to and even after the exact moment when its falsehood is declared.

Across the late 15th century to the mid-17th century the on-going adversarial saga between God and the Devil and their battle for ultimate supremacy raged across Europe.

This ability to appear as a transformed and often deformed apparition extended to taking the form of another animal. R. Lowe Thompson in The History of the Devil says the Devil sometimes appeared in comic form as a duck, as a goose, or sometimes as a youth. 20 The one common feature with all of these manifestations was the sense of an enveloping darkness, which would char­acteristically consume any surrounding light. This notion of a consuming blackness translated into being able to disguise activities and identities after nightfall. In this way people under the cover of darkness could escape from having to en­dure overriding moral rigour and participate in debauched festivals. As a \"profligate parodist\" the Devil encouraged dis­simulation, while mimicking attributes more commonly as­sociated with God he would through the actions of people attempt to dehumanise, or at least debase humanity. 21 Such acts of reversal meant the role of the Devil and the witch's cohort was elevated to a position where moral tur­pitude defined the fate of humanity. Through accounts of depravity and physical reversal , the Devil became the antith-20 Lowe Thompson, R. 1929. The History of the Devil: the Horned God of the Wes t.

Not only did this fur­ther the impression of the Devil as being capable of mimick­ing life in all its varied contortions, but it also gave credence to the notion that affliction was something imbued with spiritual significance.

He also appeared to the accused witches as a gentle­man, thus disguising his \"true\" form, although at times he exhibited a capacity for shifting between different \"Other\" affirming figurations. In this way he might appear as the black man but with Oxen fe et , or at other times he turned into a flame, or a dog which grew larger the longer you looked at it. 25 Although it would be easy to reduce the significance of these descriptions to an imaginative flight of fancy, they are not so easy to assign designation without considering the relationship to the analogous afflicted mirror. Assigning the Devil, as already predicated by his title as the \"Opposer\", the responsibility for bringing down the mo­rality of man and thus turning him away from God's plan, has denied us the possibility of exploring the details of the description held within the narrative. As encountered when discussing the manifestation with accompanying attributes of Haitian lwa, the actual deformity from what we may re­gard as the norm, doesn't necessarily need to resemble an implicit evil essence.

Undeniably an aspect of momentary levelling, the aspectual givenness to affliction is nevertheless hard to ignore especially when it comes to identifying the similari­ties between Haiti and the early modern period of witch­craft.

He therefore presents an opportunity, to explore ideas about the relational qualities which make affliction such an impressive forum for understanding our­selves and the metaphysical. This is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in Nicolas Remy's Demonolatry from 1595. Although many at the time questioned the validity of witchcraft, it is interesting to note that in Demonolatry the diabolic constitution, with all of its explicit descriptions, compiled further evidence in support of the spirit's Otherness. 27 It could be regarded as somewhat exaggerated, but our interest in affliction largely bypasses other matters which might obscure this author's contention, that through their difference spiritual certitude is and was assured. In concert with the Bovet, Remy acknowledges the incor­poreal essence of a demon. Assuming mass in air or fire, spir­its are capable of taking on material physical forms which have no limit in there range. They can therefore assume the shape of a cat, or a dog or even a fly, a further indication of their ability to condense and expand. It is also not unusual for them to take on the form of a man or woman, but they also have dextral skills beyond that of humans, for instance 27 Remy, N. 1595/2008.

L'Estrange Ewen in Witch Hunting and Witch Trials pro­vides court indictments for witches accused of entertaining such entities. It is perhaps worth mentioning a few since it further enhances our evidence on the range of manifesta­tions that demons or the Devil could take. For instance in 1662 Anne Silvester of Orsett in Essex was held at Chelms­ford gaol for \"entertaining, employing, and feeding two evil spirits in the likeness of two whelps\" (puppies).28 Bridget Weaver of Harwich also of Essex did feed an evil spirit in the form of a bird. One depiction of a witch with her familiars in the same book by Ewen, entitled \"The Strange Woman and Her Spirits\" (1621) shows the woman with her back to the picture with creatures surrounding her. Some of these are known to us as common wild fowl while others appear to be demons. Orientating around the strange woman are placed wild fowl, which by having a connection to the homestead and domesticity seem to be looking away from the witch. In contrast the creatures and demons associated with the wild are focused on the witch.

There being in this instance a threat from something unknown, allowed people to measure their own sense of well-being, while also looking for assurances in terms which could be used to con­vey a moral sense of Self.

According to Russell the monstrous and deformed depiction of the Devil himself was in accord with \"his inner defect\". Commonly described as being lame having suffered an injury during his fall from heaven, h is incomplete physi­cal presence was measured by man's physical form. Having knees that faced backwards, possibly an extra face on his stomach, as well as other body parts, blind, horns and tail and yet without nostrils, having a sulphurous odour, and being hooved and misshapen. The spirit associated with such a large quantity of inversions therefore represented an alarming array of ab sences and deformities. These physical distortions only became apparent when the accompanying narrative contextualised his appearance against the order of things. Yet these deformities offer a very different interpre­tation when place under the lens of affliction. Rather than being governed by a moralistic schema, the overt difference to our own sense of Self opens up a line of confronting op­positions. Under these circumstances the oppositions being depicted concern the manner in which we are able to address our notion of Otherness. Being germane to the afflicted mir­ror, the Devil et al. encompasses powers that are not arbi­trary in nature, although Christian commentators at the time of the early modern period preferred to highlight the temporary presence of any power capable of overturning the natural order. This was of course to be contrasted with God's permanent, although often detached presence. By associating inconstancy with deformation, the Devil was portrayed as having the capacity for being all th ings to all men. As such he could appear as an angel of light or the most infernal apparition. For people at the time, this abil­ity to shift and shape his appearance according to the de-64"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Affl icted Gods mands expected of him, illustrated a flexibility and more­over a proclivity for capturing the current social mood. As a consequence, it was the Devil and his cohort who became the interface, the very mirror, from which reflections of the everyday, with all its insecurities, peered back at the world and gave commentary about living under the conditions of the time. And it is through his affliction, for example being lame, that he exerts powers as it reflects back upon the peo­ple their own imaginings about the diabolic and the role of deformation when identifying evil. Dramatic differences to the norm, produce alternative subjectivities which act as a cantilever, and by so doing, they part the veil separating the two worlds. By embodying the grotesque, the Devil is given a voice. As the fallen angel he provided an alternative perspective on how people compre­hended themselves and the relationship they had with the world. Places associated with death, darkness and cold corre­spond under this pretext as preparatory areas for engaging with this archetypal Otherness. Rather than simply being comprehended as an Opposer, the representation of the Devil, through his extraordinary appearance as the afflicted, encourages an open dialogue with our perception of strange­ness. Those being things which escape quantifiable empiric summations about the world we inhabit. Following the same principle as found amongst Haitian lwa, the Devil invites the viewer to challenge preconceptions about what it means to be self-aware. Avoiding an inherent inclination to over de­termine evidence, presents affliction as the perfect foil by which to question our relationship to the spiritual subject. Placing notions of deformity with its accompanying ab-65"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR sences as something which only exists within the confines of a spirit realm is not so easy to press home. Remy has already stated the incompatibility of humans with demons and yet reports of deformed offspring are present in Demonolatry. These accounts provide clear evidence of spirit intervention with the offspring visibly showing signs of being partially conceived by an Otherness. Having a preternatural deformi­ty from birth, ranging from having three hands, three feet, two sets of teeth, four eyes, two heads, two bodies, or lacking a certain body part, amputates the semblance of completion from the physical form, resulting in the veil between the two worlds being breeched. Absence appearing as a visible deformity allowed a dia­logue to develop on what were the parameters for discerning morality. Convulsing with pre-given suppositions about the order of nature and its darker side meant the realm where spirits lived was presented as something other than the ev­eryday. In accord with this approach to apprehending the ex­traordinary, the role of affliction not only marked someone as embodying residual qualities perceived to have emanated from the other side, but it also in and of itself qualified the grotesque attributes of the strange unruly world of unlawful spirits. In short these signals needed to be isolated and quan­tified according to the schemas of the day. Remy reports that in 1540 Christianus Massaesus observed a \"hermaphrodite child with one horn projecting from its forehead, with arms like wings, an eye in its knee, the fe et of a hawk, and marked upon the breast with the sign of a V and equidistance cross\".

Giving the narra­tive an overarching structure by using a concordant-discor­dant schema, the story becomes worth telling because it has been turned into a rhetorical device. In isolation the event of affliction as a deformity or as absence does not make the same impression as when the descriptive quality elaborates on further predetermined contingencies. The Devil in his deformed state is limited by his image alone and the same can be said for Metres Ezili, for the words in the narrative en­flesh and embellish the spirit into being a presence. Whether lame or boneless, it is the physical absence from the perfect form which challenges us by using the salient vision of dif­ference. Uncanny or strange apparitions are only ever really af­firmed when an account about experiencing contact is told. Under these conditions the poetic formation of the image attaches itself to certain aspects of Self, and by so doing it be­comes the mirror through which we observe our own sense of Self while also observing the possibilities of an Otherness. Their oddness to 'us', discloses an otherwise ignored sepa­ration or rather it overturns the seamless stitching which makes for an unquestioned empiric object by uncovering the natural divide.

If the worlds seen and unseen are to be measured by our ability to tend to their and our own needs, then affliction gives clear insight into the extent of difference, placed here as an element by which to counterpoint Self with Other­ness. The images presented for your consideration have so far highlighted the extraordinary alterations that the spirits have undergone to gain acknowledgement. Vying for their countenance in an over saturated world of moral images, the spirits impressed upon the population their existence through their deformity. Affliction under these circum­stances became the vehicle for their stories to emerge. Forms of terrifying absence and presence tore at the frontier of hu­man endeavour, and so it was with encouraging temerity they sought to instil an alternative universe. For some this would be reduced to basic superstition, with the attached ca­veat that any societal advancement would be held back by people's ignorance. But for the clamour, the presence of an Otherness never left the population. Terms for engagement changed over the years, but the destructive impulse of these spirits remained intact. Whether imps, sprites, succubi, in­cubi, lwa, witches or the Devil, their critical message never diminished. The ability to converse with them has almost always been based on their differences to us.

Initial fears concerning the presentation of the Other as something fearful, horrendous or horrifying with each de­pending on the perspectival positioning of the Self, hereby turns the object of attention into a manifold manifestation.

Having come to the end of his life Legba appears to be ravaged by time. There is in this instance a certain disassociation from the world as he begins to fade from sight. And yet the waning of his image tells us something about the spirit presence, since through affliction the threat of departure never leaves and yet never actually takes place.

Yet by the narrative having been produced only by being exposed to editing and refinement, the voice of the people becomes inevitably obscured.

Can we then be accused of deforming the source material, or replacing the meaning with something which gives greater clarity to the individual and the path being trodden? The images of lwa and spirit alike portray affliction as an affir­mative marker for visions about deformity. The presence of silence with subsequent loss of knowledge has already ren­dered the narrative as a receptive catacomb for the forgotten.

By imbibing the spiritual quality of a specifically designated form of Otherness, the selected candidates ne­gotiate, from an altogether more empowered position, with those persons who are regarded as representing the elite. In the case of the Bori cult of the Hausa in Nigeria, those who are perceived to be in an already dominant position are obli­gated to respond positively to the demands made by the af­flicted.

Taming the spirit re­inforces the centralised moral and ethical stance by making the word count as an indicator for authorising their position as legitimate powerbrokers. Central moralistic religions at­tempt to control ecstatic states, of which affliction is one, by monopolising their expression and by limiting their impact.

To sustain their control, they must defuse any potential threat from intrusive spirits. Such uniformity of course would betray some of the in­herent complexity to the event .aspect of affliction.

Often these attacks take place without warning although this belies the implicit options a person may oth­erwise have to remedy his or her plight. Socio-economic cir­cumstance may therefore contribute towards developing an environment conducive to spirit contact. As a consequence, the manner in which location specifies how we inhabit space may yet prove a valuable ingredient, and although Lewis re­lies too heavily on the opus operandi of a peripheral and cen­tre dichotomy, the deconstruction of key points during the event remain valid as a broad introduction to this chapter. Being socially constrained by low status is countered by affliction since this facilitates access to a type of freedom found more commonly amongst the elite. The response to this encroachment on their perceived monopoly is to stop or at least take control of this threatening endeavour to chal­lenge the status-quo. But the victim of affliction is not so forthright, because the threat is not of the individual's mak­ing, and yet there is an implicit acceptance the situation will have to be dealt with, culminating in the eventual spirit's propitiation. Another important aspect to affliction is the response to the victim's plight. Affliction brings to the attention of the community the presence of the metaphysical domain and it's intrusion into their physical world. The initial symptoms signify an intervention could be taking place, while the local healer called upon to deal with the potential threat assesses the victim. When the local healer diagnoses the problem and proceeds to undertake the responsibility to cure or at least tame the spirit, the interest of those in close proximity to the victim increases.

The action of the healer reaffirms not only his ability to heal but also his status. Treatment may extract the spirit from the victim, but for Lewis it more importantly confirms that a great power is in close proximity to the victim. The possibility that any cure might be temporary means the ever-present threat from spirit intervention is never far away. Rather than dealing emphatically with the causes of the event, those who are prone to such attacks rely on the existence of a spirit domain, located beyond the safe pa­rameters of the society, to continuously reassess and assert their interests upon another group. Lewis does however dis­tinguish between affliction as a strategy, employed by those who are socially marginalised, and the dominant group who use similar strategies to maintain authority, although the spirits used are of a different calibre. A mystical idiom re­places the last resort strategy associated with the affliction event. Classifying this type of ecstatic state as being particu­lar to more formal mainline religions, rather than that found amongst peripheral possession groups, suggests an on-going unrelenting struggle to assert control over society. Religious leaders attempt to legitimise their position by using highly moralistic spirits who are seen by society as conspiring with the leaders so as to maintain control. The spirits within this exclusive precinct endorse the decisions made by those dom­inant religious leaders by acting as abstracted censors.

Even when Mircea Eliade in Shamanism bypasses the socio-functional aspect of affliction by emphasising the profane and sacred dichotomy, he replaces one effacing construct for another. 32 Neverthe­less, he does highlight the graduated alteration in the iden­tity of the individual through the affliction experience. He thereby uncovers the process of the event after due ordeal, with the ritual specialist finally emerging as a skilled practi­tioner, equipped to deal with demands made by the spirits. From this perspective the suffering of the afflicted takes on the appearance of an initiation. Part of this aspectual as­sumption derives from the torture element that is present in any initiation ceremony. Eliade notes: Vi ewed from this angle, any \"sickness-vocation\" fills the role of an initiation; fo r the suffering that it brings cor­respond to initiatory tortures, the psychic isolation of the \"elected\" is the counterpart to the isolation and ritu­al solitude of initiation ceremonies, and the immanence of death fe lt by the sick man (pain, unconsciousness, etc.) recalls the symbolic death represented in almost all initiation ceremonies. 33 The affliction event does however avoid many of the details that are required to fully comprehend the complexity of the action taking place.

At once the relationship is qualified by its negativity as the the­matic daily routine becomes a non-thematic provocation by manifesting itself as a trauma. Thrown into this maelstrom the affliction must be dealt with prior to being offered a new vocation. The consciousness of a present can only be given once the candidate has answered the call from the invisible. Spirits leave a mark, an imprint of their worldly presence upon the body, subsequently making it a portal through which they can provide guidance and heal those they wish to acknowledge as being worthy of their attention. An invisible potential, of minds, thoughts, dreams and aspirations not of the physical world reach us from beyond the veil. And yet, even within this descriptive detail there is a heavy reliance on what spirits are, or are not doing. The detail is of course imaginary, and at best conjectural, yet the presence of lives lived beyond, continues to retain an essen­tial significance when determining how lives are lived here. Looking at the surrounding world we cannot deny there is a visual harmony to what we see. It is as if there existed a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR pre-established givenness to stability in visual form. Accept­ing that not all things have a visual calm does not undermine this essential sense of stability. Being part of our human nature we are forever transposing our desire for order onto things. Responses to this interrogation are in fact prompt­ed by what we want images to display. And so it is with the perception of our body when placed in relation to another. Tactile correspondences, exploratory movements, the feel of textures serve to anchor the individual to tangible expres­sions of the physical. Maurice Merleau-Ponty in The Vi sible and the Invisible situates the body at the centre of all things: the body unites us directly with the things that through its own ontoqenesis, by welding to one another the two outlines of which it is made, its two laps: the sensible mass it is and the mass of the sensible wherein it is born by segregation and upon which, as seer, it remains open. It is the body and it alone because it is a two­dimensional being, that can brinq us into the things themselves, which are themselves not flat beings but be­ings in depth, inaccessible to a subject that would sur­vey them from above, open to him alone that, if it be possible, would coexist with them in the same world. 35 Such an opening of the body as a virtual correspondent and receiver indicates the possibility at least of spirit interven­tion beyond any requisite visual cue. There is an invited ex­posure towards the Other without their being an assumption 35 Merleau-Ponty, M. 1968. The Vi sible and Invisible.

Yet contact when it does happen inevitably involves physical disruption as the Other collides with a sense of Self. Captured in the moment of crisis the two wrestle to retain a dominant position within the body, as a consequence it signals an invitation to all watching to question authenticity. Where once it was regarded as inac­cessible, the metaphysical invites our attention, although it is not without the threat of having to undergo appropriately harsh ordeals. Transcending the temporality of a perceived Being by the enveloping disorder which levels the candidate, illustrates to those who have come to observe, the veracity of suffering and the treacherous path he or she will have to be undertake. Di s­figuring the physical form manifests an ancient trajectory, an an archical antiquity fragmented and bereft of continuity, where moments from the past are relived and re-inscribed into the consciousness of the audience. Affirmation of the spirits vital continuance is t hus assured as is the expectation to perform services to acknowledge their contribution to the life being led. Disorder of the body marked initially by the disassem­bling of ties between the candidate and others, the deforma­tion of the physical form, as well as the overall disruption affliction causes, takes on the appearance of an initiatory ordeal because it separates the candidate from normality. Under these circumstances there is no division to be found between secular and sacred life, between holy and the pro­fane, between the spiritual and the material.

Left with a range of sensations which are rudimentary aspects of perception, frustrates the acquisition of efficient correspon­dences to explain Otherness. Advocating the exact difference between physical and metaphysical apparitions proves im­possible, since the dimensional depth of spirit complexity cannot be fathomed without observing a referential adher­ence to the world. The physical expression of affliction ac­cordingly presupposes intentional moral acts. No incident of affliction, which places the aspirant in danger of being consumed, can avoid discussing the role of morality. Paul Brodwin in Medicine and Morality in Haiti challenges the idea that there is a stable notion about how to assess illness. 36 By developing a working perspective which focusses on disruption rather than continuity, Brodwin ex­amines the continuity of medical traditions. In particular, he focusses on the interruptions and breaks with consensus and thereby reveals the co ntestation between different forms of medical knowledge. He shows that it is not a contest about having access to medicine which is important, but how a spe­cific religious affiliation influences opinion and determines the decision on the most effective course of treatment. As a consequence, the flexibility of people to draw from Catholi­cism or Protestantism in its various expressions, and Vodou, by way of gaining some informed grounding, is illustrated by examining the negotiating process.

In short, human existence is never a stable state, Jackson notes that \"human beings tend, as a matter of course, to be more or less dissatis­fied with their lot,\" recognising the desire for attainment he observes \"it is rare to meet a person in any society who does not want more of something and less of something else and who imagines that things could be a whole lot better, even while admitting that things could be a whole lot worse\" 38 Uncertainty is therefore ever-present , yet we ignore the pos­sibility of ultimate failure by undertaking practices that may result in achieving our goal. This is further sustained by our imagination which entertains multiple scenarios along with 37 Brodwin 1996:17. 38 Jackson, M. 2007. Excursions.

While this alone does not ensure success, we in part prepare ourselves for disappointment as well as success. Haitians believe that living and suffering are inseparable, and that Vodou is the instrument which allows them to deal with the suffering that is life. Accordingly, Vo dou staves off disaster, minimises pain, e ases the impact of loss while strengthening survival instincts. 39 The drama of Vo dou should not therefore be considered as taking place in the confines of a ritual or related circumstance but should be extended to the interstitial places that lie beyond religious modes of practice. The crisis experienced in the lives of its participants situates the motivation for spiritual solace out­side any explicit religious confine. This provides a possible rationale for why people seek metaphysical intervention. The Fa divination system, an integral part of the Vo dun cosmology in Benin, is described by Douglas Falen in Power and Paradox as a system which provides assurances on the fate of the enquirer, while also certifying the ability of the diviner.40 Each in their own right simultaneously qualifies the presence of the Other, while certifying the significance of a wider set of social networks and obligations. This how­ever does not stop or restrict the activities of the enquirer, indeed if Falen is correct that for the Fon a belief in God is enough for them, then it is possible to imagine an open mar­ket where broad spiritual conceptualisations encourage the person to seek out advice wherever it is available.

These are only some of the possibilities, and yet they have a commonality that is determined not by the prac­titioner but by those who utilise these spiritual facilities. Each offer, though not independent from one another, an option on how to manage vulnerability and the capricious nature of life. This not only includes the obligations that are placed on a person by his/her selected religious specialist, but those that are placed upon the person by the spirit/s. In­dividual trajectories thereby defy the predetermined struc­tural patterning of social life, as people use their understand­ings to make choices that at the time seem appropriate to their needs. Achille Mbembe and Janet Roitman in their article Figures of the subject in times of crisis explicitly undertake an explora­tion into how people weave their existence by tackling inco­herence, uncertainty, instability and discontinuity. 41 Their perspective relies on one premise, that while people attempt to make sense of the world, there are others who have a vest­ed interest in dismantling or at least reconfiguring perti­nent referents used for maintaining a semblance of stability. Such an engagement with an imagined social landscape, one which is continuously shifting according to imposing vaga­ries, means that while continuity is sought, attaining the lon­gevity of singularity is never completed. This however, does 41 Mbembe, A. &. J. Roitman. i995. Figures of the subject in times of crisis.

Mbembe and Roitman believe there is a regime of subjectivities that determine the actions of people, by which they mean a shared ensemble of imaginary configurations of \"ev­eryday life\", imaginaries which have a material basis; and systems of intelligibility to which people refer in or­der to construct a more or less clear idea of the causes of phenomena and their effects, to determine the domain of what is possible and fe asible, as well as the logics of efficacious action. More generally a regime of subjectiv­ity is an ensemble of ways of living, representing and experiencing contemporaneousness while, at the same time, inscribing this experience in the mentality, un­derstanding and language of a historical time. 42 Not wishing to underestimate the effect of external factors that have in part perpetuated a sense of vulnerability in Af­rica, Mbembe and Roitman move beyond the crisis itself, while side stepping a Geertzian return to 'local knowledge', and thereby avoid a reductionist teleological factor which reduces everything down to cause and effect. By \"destruc­turing\" the crisis they look to how it is constituted in all its unevenness. Thus one approaches the crisis not as a system, but as a prosaic: the routinization of a register of improvisa-42 Mbembe &.Roibnan 1995:324. 90"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Affi iction in its Maqico-Social Context tions lived as such by people and, in this sense, belonq­inq at most to the domain of the obvious or self-evident, and at least to the banal or that which no lonqer evokes surprise. 43 Creating this type of sensitivity to the problems that all of us experience in our everyday lives overcomes the epistemo­logical problems that are produced when polarities of differ­ence or opposition are constructed prior to knowledge being transcribed. Rather than imposing an order so as to make an analysis tidy and potentially complete, it is the chaos, the unevenness of things, the inconclusive and plurality of social spaces and the relations therein that contribute towards our understanding of everyday life practices. The incompleteness of this task, the silences and observa­tions made by those whose life one has entered into, can pro­vide reflective material on how the social factors manifest themselves and influence life practices. While at the same time, we must acknowledge that the interpretation of social factors determines any subsequent perspective. It thereby gives us an insight on how to deal with any given situation and furthermore introduces new solutions for solving our own problems. Jackson notes: one does not need to conjure a God of Small Thinqs to celebrate the value of homely events, homely objects, homely words. In a world of ambitious schemes and doqmatic assertions, qrandiloquence is often taken fo r wisdom and we are persuaded that there is no phenom-43 Ibid., p. 326. 91"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR enon that ca nnot be named. Under such conditions, it becomes less imperative to qet the \"the biq picture\" than to recover a sense of the countless little thinqs that qive us a measure of the real, and remind ourselves that a life emerqes from unremarked moments, just as the soil or climate of a reqion impart to a vintaqe its terroir. 44 In regards to Haitian Vodou the relationship between indi­vidual and lwa is one filled with love and devotion as much as it is fraught with any on-going tension over whether or not to serve them. Extending beyond the material reality of everyday life pressures, lwa present to the people a residing presence, the demands of which must be assuaged. Having the opportunity to seek guidance on the concerns of the day conditions the appearance of the spirits. Alfred Metraux in Voodoo in Haiti asked one Marbial peasant to describe the re­lationship a person can have with the lwa, The lwa loves us, protect us and quard us. They tell us what is happeninq to our relations who live far away, they sugqest to us remedies which brings us relief when we are sick .. .If we are hunqry the lwa come to us in a dream and say \"take courage: you will earn money\" and the promise comes. 45 The service offered is conditional since a devotee is expected to repay the debt by making sacrificial offerings. Metraux notes: 44 Jackson, M. 2009. The Palm at the End of the Mind: re\"latedness, reliqiosity, and the real.

Interpreting an action as a form of resistance can only be de­termined by the lwa. When a person suffers from the anger of the lwa it is said that he has been seized. The severity of the punishment does not necessarily need to be in propor­tion to the offense. Reasoning for such an unwarranted re­sponse is normally put down to the fierce passions consum­ing the lwa. So when the affliction starts it may seem like a light ailment, however this inevitably worsens over time, to the point where it may prove fatal, unless the person heeds to lwa demands to yield. Negligent devotees anger their spirit affiliations because they have undermined their promise to serve the life force through the offering of suitable sup­plications. Punishments are administered by affording the lwa the opportunity of disciplining the recalcitrant. By hav­ing entered into agreement with them the task expected of the serviteur is to keep the connection between the seen and unseen world alive. Often when this line of communication breaks down the person who has absconded from attending to their demands is seized and sent mad. Metraux found that the cause of madness is nearly always considered to hap-46 Ibid, p. 96. 93"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR pen because an individual has suffered from a supernatural punishment. He mentions how one particular oungan told me that only those how resisted the will of the 'mys­teries' go mad. At Marbial someone pointed out to me a certain Florilious who, because he had neglected the cult of ancestral spirits, had beco me subject to attacks of madness during which he tore his clothes, scratched his flesh and accused himself of having cast spells on his relations. 47 Providing a cautionary note, Leslie Desmangles in his book The Faces of Gods, warns the reader that not all lwa attacks are due to negligence. When attempting to ascertain the causes for why people suffer from supernatural punishment he sug­gests the lwa can be capricious and hard to please. Reflect­ing the diversity in human characteristics the lwa such as the lord of the crossroads, Kafou, can simply be taken with an in­explicable malevolence. For instance, Kafou has the capacity of showing no mercy when he releases his demons at night. The sufferings that he inflicts upon devotees do not stem fr om human negligence, but fr om the malevolent nature of kafo u and his demons. If vodouisants believe Kafo u can inflict disease or even death upon them despite their supplications to Legba, it is because ill­chance is sometimes an inescapable part of human life . As the Haitian proverb says \"when the day of suffering 94"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Maqico-Social Context arrives even curd milk can break your head. 48 Another germane example, illustrating the way the lwa can have a direct impact on the welfare of the living, comes from one story about Ezili, who appeared in front of a crowd close to the sacred waterfalls of Saut d'Eau in Northern Haiti. Manifesting as the Blessed Virgin Mary on the branches of a palm tree, located near the Catholic church, created a spec­tacular attraction for the Vodun devotees. Upon seeing her many of the attending crowd fe ll immediately to their knees in reverence. People rushed to get the local Catholic priest so he could witness this sacred apparition. Upon arriving he found he was unable to see the Virgin, while everyone about him declared that they could see her. In frustration at this superstitious behaviour, and being convinced there was no sacred apparition, he petitioned the police captain to have his guards cordon off the area so as to stop people from leav­ing offerings. The guards were ordered to open fire if they saw the apparition, when she did eventually appear they let off a volley of shots. She proceeded to leap from tree to tree, quickly followed by rounds of gunfire which always missed their target. The priest, who by this time was incandescent with rage, resorted to asking the police if the tree could be cut down. As the tree was hewn, so those witnessing the defilement saw Ezili Danto rise into the air with an anger which was not going to be easily assuaged. Before the Catho­lic priest could return to his presbytery it was raised to the ground without him being able to salvage anything. Shortly thereafter, the priest suffered from an unexpected stroke and 48 Desmangles i992:111. 95"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR died. As for the Captain who had been so quick to come to the priest's aid, he was seized by the lwa and could be oc­casionally found wondering aimlessly in the local area. His fortune improved, when after pleading for forgiveness, he made offerings to the lwa. Trying to seek forgiveness and by showing remorse over his erroneous course of action caused the lwa to eventually reconsider the blasphemy he had com­mitted against them.49 This interwoven and textured relationship between lwa and people infers that the fate of the physical domain is con­tingent on the response by those dwelling in the metaphysi­cal. As has already been showed the lwa are capable of cross­ing the divide and intruding upon the lives of their followers. The manner in which this occurs can vary according to the context. The examples above suggest the lwa are capable of attacking and committing acts of physical harm upon the liv­ing. Vo dou ceremonies offer a safer arena for making contact. Referring to a ceremony witnessed while carrying out field research in 1996 will allow us to consider how the ritual operates as a reflexive anchor point. For people to negoti­ate a relationship with their Otherness, the attendees of the ceremony needed to observe great feats of power which were regarded as not being physically possible. The possession of vodouisants by the lwa therefore presented an opportu­nity for the lwa to display their skills while dispelling any doubt about their existence. From running burning candles through their hair or across their tongues without harming the person being \"ridden\", the possessed exhibited lwa pow-49 Desmangles 1992: 135. See Michel S. Laguerre's Voo doo and Politics in Haiti for a more detailed history on the role of apparitions in Saut D'Eau."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Ma9ico-Social Context er to the attending audience. Bearing witness to these exceptional feats in physicality, the spirits performed a role predicated by their position. Generating a spectacle such as this, not only confirmed their presence and influence over the everyday, but also warned people about their capacity to control the human body. Dur­ing these possession sagas a further narrative was developed which gave the people a contemporary reference point for negotiating everyday pressures. Words of comfort from the lwa or spectacles of extraordinary strength served to affirm belief and vanquished the cynicism expressed by the Chris­tians attending. Even those who attended and were funda­mentally opposed to Vo dou were unable to deny the strength and agility of the lwa. The primary difference in their inter­pretation was that the lwa were either aspects of the Devil, or were members of his diabolic horde. What became apparent from having witnessed the company of lwa who appeared and gave counsel, was the perpetuation of belief in a sen­tient Otherness. Often in opposition to the demands made by everyday circumstance, the lwa came to address people's hardships and by doing so brought about relief through en­tertainment and by reaffirming their guardian status. The relationship between people and lwa however is not always so harmonious especially when it comes to making claims about religious affiliation. Courlander in The Drum and Hoe describes how Maurice faced a dilemma regarding the making of a stable spiritual affiliation.

From the other, his wife's Protestant church knowing of his attendance at Vodou ceremonies, sought to press home their familial advantage by persuad­ing him to become a devout member of their congregation. Maurice was not immediately amenable to the demands being made for conversion by his wife's Protestant church. As a follower of Vodou and Catholicism, his life had always depended on both, and this had up until the point when he married his Protestant wife served him well. However, hav­ing been married for a while it had become apparent to both Maurice and his wife that they were experiencing problems conceiving a child. Around the same time his wife started to suffer from serious bouts of headaches and earaches. Mau­rice looked to gain a possible explanation for these attacks and sought counsel from an oungan who told him the rea­son for his wife's ailments were due to the female snake lwa Ayida-Wedo. She had aspirations to become his wife, and in a fit of jealousy at not wanting to share Maurice, had thrown an afiliction upon her. Possibly reacting to Maurice's decision to seek advice from an oungan his wife's family attempted to intervene. Be­fore he reached a decision on how to proceed, they informed him that the afiliction was not due to any attack brought on by the lwa, but was in fact God's punishment for refusing to break his ties with Vodou. In an act of desperation to halt the assault upon his wife, her family pleaded with him to break any connection he had with the lwa and Catholicism.

Unfortunately this never occurred, and although the physi­cal symptoms of the attack did subside, Maurice remained convinced the reason for their infertility was because he had turned down Ayida-Wedo's proposal for marriage. What becomes apparent from Maurice's experience is that he was never left alone to endure his ordeal . Indeed the source for much of the pressure came from those who had a vested interest in persuading him to decide on the appropri­ate course of action. Biased by their own interests exposed Maurice to the vagaries of having become a topic for local debate. By favouring Protestantism over his long standing affiliation with Vodou and Catholicism, he not only di­vorced himself from the lwa and oungan but also from being an active participant in a vibrant community. His decision to therefore dismiss his previous allegiances inevitably rever­berated amongst those who knew him. Breaking away from the spiritual communities Maurice had once served, presents an opportunity to briefly explore the meaning of community amongst Vodou practitioners. By simply disavowing his affiliations he would have indi­cated to all concerned that he no longer wished to belong. It is expected that the breaking of the physical tie to the metaphysical world temporarily threw his estranged Vodou adherents along with their accompanying lwa into disarray. Yet it is almost certain having lost Maurice that serviteurs would have rallied to safeguard their community. It is here therefore, within the confines of a Vodou ritual, that a sense of community is normally realised. This is perhaps nowhere more evident than when witnessing the individuality of 99"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR participants undergoing a process of deconstruction.

Bound in synchrony, participants sidestep everyday pressures by encouraging the lwa to attend. The lwa behaving in a particular way establish a space for experi­encing a temporary catharsis. Normally in a possessed state the lwa \"ride\" their adherents, displaying as they go, fe ats of physical wonder which not only confirm their existence but the extent of their power. As an Otherness they channel the frustrations and expectations from everyday interaction and magnify the daily content into a carnivalesque spectacle.

Reflecting back upon them the vagaries of the world lying beyond the ritual precinct, the ritual specialists and the lwa appear to provide comfort and reassurance. In this con­genial atmosphere an individual's conduct towards the lwa, and the keeping of any solemn promise made, is constantly placed under scrutiny. It is not unusual to find a person be­ing admonished by a lwa because they have not kept to their vow to serve and replenish their life force. Keeping in check the activities of its participants, the lwa and their physical representative bind the adherents to­gether through their common devotion, giving them in the 100"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Affl iction in its Maqico-Social Context process a sense of belonging and protection. Methods used to solidify a sense of community include the caring for ad­herents during the ceremony itself. For instance food and water over the course of the ritual are distributed regularly amongst those attending. The ritual specialist counsels those who are known to be experiencing a particularly \"hard time\", and when lwa do appear they often distribute money to those who are deemed to be suffering from the greatest difficulties. Alleviating the relentless struggle to overcome a fragile existence is for a moment suspended by communing with their lwa. Guided and controlled by the ritual specialist gives the ritual a general sense of order. By choreographing the spectacle with regards to the positioning of salutations and supplications generates a conducive environ for congress. The trials and tribulations that accompany the serving of the lwa do not however mean the ritual specialist remains untouched by daily pressure . Indeed being at the very inter­face between the two realms places the oungan and mambo in a precarious position, where the full weight of the lwa's displeasure or the discontent of the adherents can threaten the ritual specialist's standing. For many the wrath of the lwa is not an uncommon ordeal, yet there is amongst the daily demands being made on the physical, the affliction a chosen candidate is expected to endure when selected by the lwa. When carrying out preliminary field research in Limbe in Northern Haiti in the mid-to-late nineties, I found out about this form of affliction first hand from a Vodou priest called Renold. He told me how the course he took to become a recognised oungan did not follow any typical initiatory pro­cedure. Instead his narrative detailed an alternative initia-101"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR tory route, one which relied explicitly on the local populace and lwa for authentication. Affliction as an aspect of any formal Vodou initiation is not normally accentuated in the same way. Although isola­tion from the world for a number of days before being rein­troduced suggests a type of sensory deprivation, when the candidate does emerge he or she is welcomed back into their local serving community. Whether this correlates specifi­cally with Renold's ordeal remains questionable, because his isolation from a support network initially left him alone and exposed. The first time Renold knew the lwa had chosen him to serve was when one of them appeared in dream. He was ap­proached by a man who did not tell him his name, yet Re­nold instinctively knew he was a lwa. The lwa sat before him and said he should serve them.

This did not however result in Rcnold's total compliance with the lwa. Shortly after surrendering to the lwa his oungan godfather sent a message saying, the lwa had spoken to him and they required Renold to \"make\" a ceremo­ny. Uncertain on his ability to carry out this request, based on his on lack of knowledge, along with a visceral fear of be­ing possessed, meant he had no other option but to decline their request. Angered at his disrespect, the lwa preceded to go on strike by refusing to work for any other oungan and mambo in the area.

Renold's torturous ordeal before and after becoming an oungan, was never an easy option for raising his social sta­tus, nor did it lead to acquiring otherwise unobtainable re­sources. In contrast to Lewis's argument, the affliction did not signify an outward challenge followed by self-aggran­disement, but rather brought about dialogic intercourse be­tween interested groups. A key aspect to his transformation was the development of a concordant-discordant narrative, which enveloped aspects of the metaphysical with the prac­ticalities of the physical. For Renold the affliction followed by further threats to comply, forced him into accepting his role. But this wasn't without first being vetted by the local community, as well as other serving oungans and mambos. It is therefore possible to conclude, that the trials and tribu­lations he endured made him an oungan, rather than the in­vitation to serve. Moreover, maintaining a level of resistance proved to be a positive attribute, since it illustrated to others 104"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Maqico-Social Context his inner strength as well as showing it was not part of a cyni­cal ploy to improve his financial situation. Renold's experience is not however unique. Metraux found the lwa let the person know of their selection through possession or symbolic dreams. Before Tullius became an oungan, he often had dreams where he would see a gourd, which contained beads and on the outside surrounding the gourd was a snake boned web of interlinking threads. 51 This was the asson, a ritual implement conferring priestly status. It is thought that if the asson appears in a dream it should be assumed that the person being contacted is destined to become a ritual specialist. The dream certainly indicated for Tullius his destiny, because the asson appearing as a cen­tral motif of the dream anticipated the summoning role he would eventually adopt. While dreams operate as the interface between the worlds, it would not have been enough for the chosen person to im­mediately become a ritual specialist. Although coming into contact with the lwa may be a vital aspect of the ensuing cri­sis, claiming that contact had taken place would not have been sufficient proof that the person had been chosen. Initial contact examples however set the scene for what will then take place. The actual affliction in this moment remains ab­sent, but what is present is the context out of which the or­deal will emerge. Agitating the semblance of order, the invitation primes the outcome of this first meeting by introducing the pos­sibility of an engaging crisis. Tullius, despite being singled out by the lwa initially avoided their request and by so doing 51 Metruax 1959:66. 105"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR placed his own health at risk. As with Renold, it wasn't long after having had the dream that he became seriously ill. Yet for Tullius his relationship to the lwa had been somewhat different. Consistently denying their demands from birth, he eventually reconciled his differences because he believed the lwa had grown tired of his inability to concede, this in turn made him feel ashamed at having ignored them for so long. Though the details of Tullius' transformation vary with that of Renolds', the afflicted drama remains a crucial com­ponent to both of their ordeals. A further relevant compar­ison can be found in Maya Deren's Divine Horsemen where she cites the story of Isnard, son of a rural oungan who was sent to Port-au-Prince to attend school. As he grew up, the city became his home. He fe lt disinclined to follow his fa­ther's footsteps to become a farmer or an oungan. When his father eventually died, Isnard was expected and obliged take on his father's ounganship and the running of the farm, yet he still chose to stay in the city, with the hope he might set up a small business. As Deren points out Isnard didn't exactly ignore the spirits because he retained his ancestral lwa, but at the same time he did not want to commit to being an oungan. Partially due to feeling ill-equipped at perform­ing this role, as well as not wanting to leave the city, made him determined to ignore the call for him to attend to his family obligations. The lwa, not being satisfied at his reluc­tance to accept his destiny began to occasionally appear be­fore Isnard in dreams or by possessing other people. Each time they made themselves known to him, they would tell him not to abandon his inheritance. Thinking the lwa were wrong to expect this of him, he continued to ignore their re-106"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Magico-Social Context quest. But the longer he continued to avoid the lwa so their clamour for him to yield increased. Becoming ever more in­sistent and frustrated by his resistance, the lwa eventually had no choice but to afflict him. He eventually became ill, while any business undertaking he attempted to make sim­ply failed. Increasing the pressure upon him, where his ev­eryday existence was being constantly infringed upon by the lwa, eventually made lsnard realise it was imperative that he accept his destiny. 52 An intrinsic element to this staging of the affliction is the taken for granted sentient or real life presence of the lwa in a person's life. These are not given over to some strange ab­stracted apparition, but appear as people who are simply interacting with others from beyond the veil. Although it would be easy to simply assign lwa a metaphysical attribute by which to locate or place their position to the physical do­main, the implicit danger in doing so would be to limit the extent of their potemtiaL For Haitians who follow the lwa, the world is not quite as divided, although the lwa may not be seen as you intermingle with other people, there is always the assumption that they are nevertheless present, walking where you walk, going where you go. This may not necessari­ly be indicative of them following, rather than it proving that there is an element of Otherness in all of our daily activities. Accepting such potentiality is evident in the accounts of Renold, Tullius and Isnard. Whereas the initial contact through a dream presents an opportunity for the lwa to have a private audience, in isolation to the world, the affliction impacts on the behaviour of all those surrounding the candi-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR date. For instance, the otherwise stable interiority of Being, which up to the point of contact remained unchallenged, suddenly loses its innate equilibrium with the surrounding world. This is thrown into disarray when the invitation is made. Not only does this literally catapult a person into a position of undecided torment, but the consequences of re­fusing lwa advances carries with it an explicit threat to their physical integrity. What we must be sure of is that these events are not hap­pening in isolation to one another. They are part of a wider order of vocational shifts that together produce constant adumbrations, as new versions of a similar type are added. Each account therefore substantiates the role of the lwa. As facilitators for change and continuity they appear to embody causality. Their existence is therefore contingent on making infractions. In these circumstances their presence and sub­sequent demands depend on their invitation being refused. Such reluctance is tantamount to turning ones back on the religion, the community as it is at least perceived, the fam­ily and their associative links to the family lwa. Although we should be cautious to not make this lwa reaffirmation into a functionalist argument, we do need to ask why would the chosen person be reluctant to serve the lwa? If we refer back to Lewis, we see that expressing any kind of reluctance would be a surprising decision to make, especially if the raising of status and the acquisition of scarce resources was re sponsi­ble for driving the affliction drama. It is therefore useful to survey what the affliction may otherwise signify. If we temporarily reduce affliction to the transmission of a signal to expectant receivers, we see the response of the people changes as the affliction increases in severity. If any 108"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Affl iction in its Magico-Social Context of the people cited in our anecdotal evidence emerged the next day from having had a dream and proceeded to let ev­eryone know the lwa had requested they become an oungan, what would the probable response have been? At best, peo­ple would have tended towards cynicism, unconvinced there was anything more to their claim than their own desire to be recognised as something more than their current status or position in the wider society. The introduction of affliction resets therefore the evalu­ative stage, but even here if the affliction remains relatively mild, it remains possible that the people who will potentially come to seek their advice will remain unconvinced. In short, the affliction has to be severe. By displaying ever greater physical signs of trauma ensures the affliction becomes com­pelling. In these conditions the narrative begins to assume concordant-discordant qualities. Producing insurmount­able signifiers engages the fate of the candidate with that of the local community. Beyond the personal ordeal of the se­lected, the attack signals something so incredibly strong and yet absent from everyday experience, that the performance bridges the body's physical decline with a qualitative state­ment that this event is hard to fake. Coughing up blood com­bined with going blind, introduces to the narrative an em­plotted deformation aspect which distorts the physical form, to the point where it starts to mirror the descriptive charac­teristics of the lwa. External referents to those commonly associated with notions about belonging combine with the lack of any scientific diagnosis to explain the intervention. There is therefore an 'honest' quality to the affliction which people 'tap' into when assessing the validity of the attack. Scrutinising affliction as it worsens, receivers are aware"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR of the attempts of the signaller to remedy the illness. The signaller is thereby transmitting information about his own mental state as he resists lwa advances. A reluctance to submit at this point in the crisis inadvertently confirms the power of intangibles over the individual. Amongst the mael­strom, the role of the oungan as \"Master of Gods\" takes on an extended significance from that which is happening at the time of the affliction. Mastering knowledge about the lwa and then knowing how to transfer this into ritual practise requires a particular calibre of person. To accomplish this fe at the oungan, or mambo, is expected to acquire a tech­nical ability by undertaking a graduated processional re-ed­ucation. For the specialist must learn the names of the lwa and know their attributes, emblems, as well as a cornucopia of ingredients, colours, appropriate animal sacrifices, and liturgies for each lwa. Renold's case suggests expressing reluctance, affliction, and further resistance contributed towards authorising his new position. A voluntary flotilla of people saw the poten­tial in his crisis. Affirming his ability to serve the lwa and the local community well, validated his new role as ritual spe­cialist. In fact it would be fair to say that if the community refused to pay attention to his ordeal and subsequent con­version his transformation would have meant nothing. The role is thereby contingent on establishing a spiritual stake hold amongst the local populace. For one of the greatest threats an oungan or mambo faces is the potential mutiny from their local congregation, especially if it is found that certain codes of conduct have been broken. These requisite values are normally imposed by voluntary participants who predicate the conduct of the oungan and then continue to 110"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Maqico-Social Context monitor how he or she conducts themselves. If the local pop­ulace choose not to attend rituals and don't seek advice, the status of the ritual specialist is accordingly undermined. In Haiti, people can resort to serving the lwa within their family compounds when it is felt there is not a reliable oungan or mambo living in the area. There are others who choose to only serve the ancestral lwa . They point out that a real father is more trustworthy than an oungan. They tell of an ambitious oungan who bought a Bossu, and how his fam­ily deities, the good racine deserted him in protest. They told of another who charged fe es which went towards decorating his umfo and making an elegant display, rather than attend­ing to the \"real task at hand\". 53 After becoming a well-recognised oungan, Renold be­ing aware of this communal threat of being abandoned installed counter measures to stop his clientele migrating away from his services. Ever conscious of his precarious position, he placed along every path leading to and cutting across his ritual precinct, a selection of buried bottles. These were \"charged\" to ensure those seeking advice would always come back to him when they required other problems to be resolved. But the reluctance of Renold to take on a new vocation may have also been due to more than being under constant scrutiny. Devised as a system of healing, the commitment to serve can be a sacrifice too far. Deren citing the criticism of oungans says the community are the ones who are enumeratinq the very restraints which would make it 53 Deren 2003:174. 111"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR impossible fo r the oungan to carry any villainy very fa r, fo r he is aware that he is in competition with this recourse that people have to private worship. If he is to build a clientele, he must prove himself in a pragmatic way. He must win a kind of respect normally accorded to the fa t her or mother. 54 Powerful ritual displays ensure their righteousness. Without being righteous and honest the community would expect the lwa to abandon the specialist. Administering successful cures therefore bestows a high level of confidence and trust upon the practitioner. Drawing from the experiences of others, as well as the de­bilitating effect of affliction, meant that Renold gradually became self-conscious about how to successfully conduct himself. At no point did he wish to resume his old life, yet he never totally accepted his destiny until Agaou-Djab offered Renold his support. If people came and asked him to cure their illness, or wanted to find a solution to a bad job situa­tion, Agaou-Djab would appear in a dream telling him how to resolve the person's problem. What seems to then appear from this experience is a divi­sion of Self, between a nonworldliness and worldliness. How these two identify particular types of perception, which to­gether inform the making of Self can only be displayed by adopting a specific perspective. Revealing the Self as the in­terior subjective opens up aspects of life which might oth­erwise remain elusive. Yet strangely familiar, this interiority to the Self's partial constitution establishes the basis for ac-54 Deren 2003:175. 112"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Ajj1 iction in its Maqico-Social Context cepting the existence of the metaphysical. With its penchant for dwelling amongst the Otherness this aspect of Self moves away from the light which threatens to reveal its composi­tion. Formed from a multitude of invisible and yet perceived interventions, means this version of Self depends upon a subtle displacement from the material world so as to make its non-worldly derivation significant. This is to be contrasted with the Self as an intersubjec­tive object, one which takes on a solid material form through the use of the body as an external signifier and respondent. Under these circumstances the body corresponds to the idea of fragmentation. Any undertaking to perceive the body as complete is undermined by the visual and tactile con­nectivity appearing at a localised level. For Renold, the af­fliction manifested itself through the coughing up of blood and the loss of eyesight. Both of these conditions should be considered as the breaking down of the body complete. The relationship between these two physical signs did not however, lead to understanding the overall physicality of the attack. Any constitution of the body based on perception is always imperfect, although its accessibility becomes more pronounced through adumbration. It is when assumptions about the existing body are disrupted that meanings are pro­duced about the Other. As an outward manifestation of lwa contact, the body becomes for the people the gauge for un­derstanding their relationship to the lwa. The connection Renold had to the lwa was not only through the affliction itself but through the medium of dreams. By the lwa reflecting their potential for 'becoming', Renold began to apprehend not only his subjective body but the intersubjective quality of his Being. In short, he came to 113"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR know himself through the intervention of the Other. The affliction, in this case, enhanced how he perceived himself. Zahavi in a moment of erudite perfection says about this re­lation with Other, It is only when I apprehend the Other as apprehendinq me, and when I take myself as the Other to the Other; that I apprehend myself in the same way that I appre­hended them, that I become aware of the same entity that they are aware, namely, myself as a person. 55 When constituted within the context of occult articulation, the Self appears as coherent when challenged by the spirits. Conferring their existence, by overturning any semblance of order, highlights their ethical and moral demeanour towards the living. This indicates the reasoning behind particular candidature selection. As a consequence, intentional inter­action with the Other, from both sides, highlights the com­position of the Self. When examining affliction, the condi­tion under which contact takes place divests two distinct, yet interrelated changes, as it did for Renold when intervention provoked a change in how he saw himself compared to those around him. It placed him in a space he had not occupied be­fore. Opening up new conditional routes of communication, he relied heavily as did Tullius and Isnard on being identi­fied as different from those who had not been chosen. How they then saw themselves and understood their own identity required them to acknowledge lwa interdependency. 55 Zahavi, D. 1999. Self-Awareness and Alterity: A Phenwienological Investigation. Evanston: Northwestern University Press. 114"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Magico-Social Context Encountering such a wild expressive Otherness to the be­ing he had known before, rectified the dissimilitude he had towards the spirits and the local community. The attack re­calibrated his relationship to the lwa. It not only altered his perception, but reaffirmed the people's general perception. No longer seen as a chosen man, they came to rely on his ability to act as a conduit. As an object which could be at­tacked, damaged and transmogrified , Renold became con­scious that being an object for an Other, brought a revelation on how he related to his own subjective sense of Self. In their recipient relationship, the Vodou priest, the lwa and con­gregation, from a principle of acknowledged reciprocation, bound themselves to one another and by so doing became something greater than their parts. To suggest that through affliction there is a reassembling of order after disruption would be to underplay the preva­lence of discordance within the narrative. Temporal readjust­ment and upheaval followed by a long and constant tranquil­lity does not reflect the fragility of the world most of us live in. Without exception, the same can be said for the spirits, for we all continue to negotiate our existence with the Other. The lwa's ability to disrupt is perhaps nowhere more obvi­ous than in the many accounts offered by Metraux. Extant relations between lwa and people portray an unsteady equi­librium or truce. In the same way spirits and gods may mir­ror onto their host aspects of their own affliction, so the af­fliction of the people reflects back onto how they portray and relate to their lwa. Caught in an endless cycle of affliction and retribution, lwa prepare people for the responsibilities associated with maintaining longevity. In the same instance, there is an expectation lwa will treat their serviteurs \"right\" 115"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR as long as they keep to their promised undertaking to serve. Deren describes a particular incident with her cook La Merci who suddenly came down with severe abdominal pains. Having sought advice from a local leaf doctor her con­dition didn't improve. Deren tried to intervene but La Merci refused her assistance. In an attempt to reduce her ever in­creasing discomfort about her failing condition Deren took it upon herself to request a physician to visit. He diagnosed acute appendicitis and advised she be taken to the hospital for treatment. Again La Merci refused to go, on the basis that when people go to hospital they die. La Merci was convinced it was the lwa who had grabbed her. In desperation Deren resorted to threatening her that if she did not go to hospital she would be sacked, then she tried a different tack and at­tempted to cajole her into going by promising her rewards, and yet La Merci's resolve was resolute. When Deren's attempts to assist failed, La Merci returned to her hut, where it was expected news would emerge the fol­lowing day that she had died. Deren was therefore surprised to see that La Merci's condition had improved by the next morning. That same evening a child appeared at her hut and informed her that his grandmother had been mounted by a lwa and he had a message for La Merci. Following the child back to his grandmother's, La Merci offered up the requisite salutations to the residing Ogun, who informed her that the sickness was not natural. She had apparently not carried out to the satisfaction of the lwa her previous obeisance before leaving her ancestral land. Ogun requested she return home and offer a sacrifice to propitiate the spirits. The next morn­ing La Merci looking ever better along with some money from Deren travelled home with a chicken and some gifts for 116"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Maqico-Social Context her neighbours. Upon her return back to Deren's re sidence she was full of energy, and her stomach pains had complete­ly disappeared. The explanation given for her recovery was the reaffirmation of ties to her ancestral lwa. 56 Identifying the affliction as being born from the lwa, de­scribed by La Merci as being \"grabbed\" brings us to the point where a discussion on the notion of \"maladi\" needs to take place. The cause of affliction has various derivations accord­ing to Brodwin. When discussing medicalization and illness experience he explains there seem to be for many Haitians three distinct forms of maladi. There is the \"sent sickness\" more commonly referred to as maladi satan. This does not however refer to the French Catholic icon, the Opposer, or even to a principle of evil. In this context Satan refers to a sickness sent by someone else. This is then contrasted with maladi Bondye which denotes any other form of natural sick­ness. There is embedded amongst these two archetypal ref­erents maladi mo which comes from a sickness sent by the dead. In this case it simply denotes an intervention by the spirit of the dead. Both mo and Satan maladies refer to the sending of an entity to afflict another which overtime results in misfortune, illness or death. In some instances disease has an association to specific spirits and this can even extend to the spirit's age, distinguished by it being a child or an adult spirit. The dispatching of a spirit onto someone can be done through various material means, Brodwin mentions two: a \"powder hit\" and a \"lamp hit\". For the spirit to be dispatched they are required to be hidden from view, but placed in a po-56 Deren 2003: 167-68."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR sition where the person will come into contact with at least one of them while making the daily round. These are known as traps and are capable of bringing about the same kind of illness and death as the mo. In a similar vein to LaMerci's experience, maladi satan and maladi mo cannot be undone by seeking professional biomedical assistance. This does not mean that people afflicted with an illness avoid seeking pro­fe ssional advice, rather they use their consultation to discov­er whether it can be treated. If the professional interlocutor does not give a satisfactory diagnosis, the afflicted and the surrounding family assume the affliction must stem from one of the two metaphysically derived maladies. Each maladi offers us a narrative on the role of spirits, placed as they are within opposing moral and ethical ways of knowing, they compel us to consider in contradistinction to commonality the determinants for their appearance. There can be no overarching narrative which extracts a general con­sensus. Each person comes with an explanation based on shared life experiences and prescribed religious affiliation. As such the antagonistic composition of the narrative Brod­win provides, when describing the plight of a nineteen year old Haitian woman Jerline is worth recounting here at some length. Jerline worked as teacher at a Protestant church school in Jeanty in the south of Haiti. Many of her peers regarded her as an intelligent articulate erudite individual, and as a con­sequence there must have been some consternation when she started to show signs of having been afflicted. There was talk she could have been sent a maladi satan because people were jealous of her position. According to Brodwin she was one of only 20 women who had a job amongst a local popula-118"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Affliction in its Maqico-Social Context tion of 3000. Her position, and with it her acquired status, was thought to have attracted the attention of those who were not so well off. In a fit of jealousy, an individual envious of her position, sought to remedy the difference between them by sending a spirit upon her. She had become through her vocation a prime target for such an attack. The affliction first appeared when on her way back from the school she stopped at her local market. While buying provisions she saw a shadow pass by her, which immediately made her afraid. Other than seeing this apparition nothing else happened, it was only after she had returned home and cooked her family a meal and prepared some juice that the affliction suddenly descended upon her. After the first attack she resumed, what could be described as strained, but rela­tively normal relations with her family. At this early stage in her ordeal she was able to identify her attack as coming from someone who had maliciously sent a maladi mo upon her. Her ability to clearly communicate with her family however quickly deteriorated as the days passed. She gradually with­drew and became disorientated. The affliction phase took on two particular forms of expression. She would become vio­lently agitated or shows signs of extreme fatigue. Brodwin notes the first episodes of the affliction seem to have been the most violent. It was as if the body was under the influ­ence of an external power, she repeatedly endured aggressive convulsions and violent fits. Unable to recognise her family she proceeded to bite and hit those who tried to restrain her. People around her were of the opinion she was insane mal­adi-foli. For two days they were convinced she was losing her mind, and while this diagnosis allowed others to identify the parameters of the problem it did nothing to limit the range 119"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR of probable causes. There were in this case, three probable causes and with it there came an explanation for defining Jerline' s affliction in a particular way. Was it traceable to a break down in her social relations, or possibly a \"natural madness\", one in which no metaphysical intervention was present, or a \"true sickness\"? Overarching these potential causalities were the two desig­nations of maladi Bondye and maladi satan. Brodwin is quick to specify the apparent flexibility that came with diagnosing Jerline's affliction. If indeed it was a \"natural sickness\" the family were free to avoid the inevitable oungan consultation which would otherwise follow, and this meant they didn't need to question the reputation or intention of other people living in the local vicinity. But this diagnosis wasn't without a problem because it meant the family had to accept Jerline' s good soul was lost to them forever. Jerline's family deliberated over the possibility of it be­ing a maladi Bondye but became convinced through the way the affliction expres sed itself that it had to be maladi satan. By turning their attention to mala.di satan they explicitly ac­cepted the affliction as being caused by someone who felt some malicious intent towards Jerline. Not wanting to limit available opportunities to deal with the affliction the family called upon lay Catholic practitioners and an oungan, both of whom offered very different advice on her condition and on how to find an appropriate remedy. The diagnosis proved to be very different with the oungan considering the spirit attacking her as a Satan, in this case this meant that the oungan used a generic inversion of good to characterise the spirit without counter positioning the spirit into a Christian iconography. Whereas the Catholics saw Jerline as embody-120"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Affi iction in its Magico-Social Context ing Satan, through this diagnosis the evil resided within her flesh thus indicating an absolute inversion to Christ and the notion of being a good Christian. The solution for dealing with this problem manifested itself in different ways accord­ing to the diagnosis. For the oungan he dealt with the afflic­tion as something that needed to be repelled and therefore applied surface protection to stop further physical interven­tions. The Catholics on the other hand dealt with perceived cavities within her, where the evil resided, and therefore con­cocted noxious toxins to force Satan out. It is interesting to note that this case was not limited to Catholic and Vodou practitioners only. Alongside the actual application of a remedy there emerged a Protestant narrative which criticised the activities of all concerned. Denigrating lwa and hagiographic Catholics alike, by associating both forms of knowledge as demonic, construed any ritual action being performed as satanic. Indeed for the Protestant Pente­costal community her illness would have immediately disap­peared if she had converted to Protestantism. Moreover, re­ducing the lwa to entities which are intrinsically evil limited their role as malicious interlocutors sent to do harm. From the Protestant perspective the affliction became more severe as Jerline and her family distanced themselves from God, as illustrated by calling on the services of an oungan and the Catholic laic group. These cases of affliction provide an insight into the way people negotiate amongst themselves in an attempt to gain a semblance of order, as well as illustrating the perpetual dialogue people are in with their Otherness. Showing flex­ibility in their resolve to make sense of affliction, the attack from the spirits re-engages the physical with the metaphysi-121"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR cal. Not only does this open up opportunities for developing and understanding the position of the spirits to the people, but it also encourages the elaboration of narratives which in turn ground the experiential into a timeless format. Evident relations are made and broken on the back of the perceived differences between the two realms and yet affliction facili­tates open dialogue. Initiating contact, affliction signifies the beginning of an alteration in the perception of Self. It harnesses the fears and aspirations of a people, while also levelling any drive to be­come something greater than that permitted by others. In this way the lwa and their life history determine the form of their aspectual Otherness. Based on reciprocity their exis­tence renders our position to them as being one where their affliction is acknowledged, spoken about and eased through engagement. When it comes to the ordeal of affliction the deformation signifies the transitional move undertaken by the Self. Embracing new ways of knowing bears down as an arduous ordeal, but as has been shown affliction's poten­tial means that it never takes place in isolation to the pub­lic arena. For this is all about displaying to others that these entities can and do have a definite impact on how people conduct their lives. Whether moral or immoral, an affliction scars and heals while simultaneously pirouetting to the vaga­ries of an uneven fragile living world. 122"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"c}:!

Notwithstanding the superstitious mind, belonging to the often described popular society, rather than the educated elite, gave credence to these accusations as a way of explain­ing their misfortune. In Haiti, the cited evidence emphasised the production of many and often opposing narratives about affliction, whereas the evidence for malicious intent across Europe normally involved the taking into consideration of witchcraft as a possible cause.

As a consequence, the actual meaning of affliction to the people retained its otherworldy source. In particular, the position of the witch as a conduit for the diabolic became an important causal attribute when investigating affliction.

A narrative's moral imperative for engaging with this topic, avoided any attempt to reason why these marks may have had more than a nefarious intent. Given our investigation so far, it is pos­sible to suggest that these marks, which when described as deformations of the moral subject, were intended to only ad­dress one particular aspect of affliction. Jonathan Sharpe in Instruments of Darkness reports during the Essex witch trials of 1566 that Elizabeth Francis confessed to having a cat familiar which her grandmother had given her. 57 The cat was suitably reported to have been called Sa­than. To begin with she used the cat to gain wealth and at­tract the attention of an Andrew Byles who she coveted with thoughts of eventual marriage. Her desire was not however to be realised and she henceforth started using Sathan for malicious purposes. In order to sustain the strength of the cat she would offer hi m a drop of her own blood, which she would achieve by pricking herself. In other cases, such as in John Walsh's examination of the same year, the familiar was described as sucking blood.

By the end of James 1 reign the witch's mark had migrated from the face, chin, forefinger, shoulder and wrist, to the genitalia of the person being accused. By this point the mark was regarded as a teat providing nothing but suste­nance for the Devil or one of his subordinate counterparts. Over a similar period of time the inclusion of the Devil as a descriptive signifier for malicious intent started to take a central role. Whereas before, the familiar could appear in many shapes, the Devil was now thrust into being given a principal role along with the witch. As discussed above the Devil's difference to the norm was mirrored by the witch's difference to the rest of the physical world. A person who was found to be bearing a suspicious mark was set apart and dealt with for perverting the right and mor­al course of life. As an anticipatory device, the Devil's badge confirmed, prior to there being a conviction, that the ac­cused had become a servant for diabolical ends. It is thought the importance of bearing a mark mimicked a saint's stig­mata which meant for the supposed culprit being accused of committing an inversive act. Whether the mark was artifi­cial or natural was of no consequence, it was still exposed to the same exploratory method used for identifying unnatu­ral alliances. If nothing else, the impurity of the person was primed and then put on display by the people who were al­ready convinced they had caught a witch.

The Devil's teeth or claw marks proved congress had taken place, but evidence for fraternising with a malefic source could only be confirmed by imparting further physi­cal infringements on the body of the accused. Investigative measures such as these were all part of due process, which at times extended to shaving the whole body in an attempt to uncover abnormalities that would otherwise remain hidden from view. Although identifying marks required that the person be treated with suspicion, the courts acknowledged that the Devil had the ability to remove any external sign which gave away his relationship to the accused. 59 Remy equates the Devil's mark on a witch to that found on slaves. When the masters scarred their human stock as a way of identifying ownership they made it difficult for them to escape and evade capture. And so to-day the Devil brands and seals those whom he has newly claimed as his own with such tokens of harsh and inhuman slavery, markinq them especial­ly (as some say) on that part of the body which was anointed by the priest on the day of their baptism ... 60 Remy goes on to question this supposition however on the basis that many marks signalling the person's compact were hidden from sight.

On nothing but empty promises for eventual enrichment, people were tricked by his diabolical glamour. Freely enter­ing into agreement to serve, the talon which brands flesh was not normally associated with a witch having endured pain. Scar tissue described by Remy as being hard and insensitive to touch did not bleed when pierced. In offering evidence to support his perspective Remy cites a particular old woman in Essey, France, who was found to have a mark which was then submitted as evidence of her having fraternised with the Devil. As part of the investigative procedure this woman was duly pierced by the sergeant. Upon the blade being in­serted she neither screamed nor did the wound bleed. In or­der to confirm his findings she was once again pierced with a blade next to the mark, whereupon she immediately cried out and the wound proceeded to bleed. Extrapolating from this evidence, Remy ponders on the quality of the mark, finding the similarity between the ac­cused and demon extended beyond the wound itself to the apparition being cold and insensitive. Other adjectives used to assign significance were \"sluggish\" and \"languid\", along with the witch being described as adopting the apparel of death. In this case, her old age and closeness to death meant the blood had grown sluggish and the body had become fro­zen with old age. Not wanting to invite ridicule on his find­ings, Remy observes an untouchable attitude when address­ing the evidence, especially given the nature of the mark and its close affiliation to the demon. \" But it is the nature of the Demons' touch, of which we are speaking, that the insensi­tiveness which it induces endures for ever, and the farther it 131"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR is removed from its cause the more pronounced it becomes.\" Further evidence comes from him also citing a case about a husband who submitted an accusation of witchcraft against his wife. The husband contended that every Thursday, when they went to bed her body would tum ice cold, it was sug­gested this was proof that she must be a witch and therefore practising black magic. 61 The notion of the accused having undergone a perversion of Being, resulting in the physical deformation with accompanying moral deviations from the norm, appears to have been a prevailing motif. Not wanting to adopt a material stance by which I may only consider the hard evidence from the accounts provid­ed, I wish to explore the subjectivities of the body alongside ideas about embodiment. When searching for evidence that the accused was actually a witch, the first requirement was to find a sufficient number of collaborative witnesses. This was then substantiated by submitting indisputable evidence. Under these circumstances the physical integrity of the body became the focal point for moral debate. Not only did the ac­cused present an opportunity to affirm the existence of the supernatural in all its ungodly manifestations, but it also perpetuated the idea of community. Lying in juxtaposition, disorder was set against the societal desire for order by ap­plying a notion about the complete physical form. Witchcraft was not, however, a functional tool by which local communities were able to recalibrate their moral ethos in times of crisis.

The frustration by the clergy towards individuals seeking the advice of cunning folk goes some way towards confirming Christian morality was not as exclusively prac­tised as once supposed. In fact it is possible to suggest that in the same way as people in Haiti use all available spiritual machinations to achieve a better grasp on their everyday ex­istence, so populations across Europe not only entertained the idea of diabolism as an alternative corrective means, but considered it to be an integral part of their lives. 62 As if to cater for the inadvertent interruption of normality the topic of witchcraft required their attention. And it is here when looking at how people attend to the strange that we find an underlying theme to ideas about af­fliction. The description of witches embodying affliction, as realised through different forms of entertainment or accusa­tion confirms their difference to the moral norm was contin­gent on them agreeing to serve the Devil, being branded by their 'master', and offering their life force to their familiars. Physical protuberances deriving from natural design or unnatural magical activity were never ultimately disputed. Embodying elements of an untoward Otherness gave narra­tives the ability to expound possible causes and experiences the individual had undergone to become evil. Transforma­tive in its appearance, the revealing of a suspicious mark meant the accused served a purpose; by which confirmation was sought about the overwhelming threat from a meta­physical world lying beyond the farthest reaches of God. 62 lam not trying to suggest that everyone was a closet Satanist.

Supplanting the resid­ual autonomy of the person with perceived subjective stanc­es from popular culture drew the accused into a distorted carnival like domain of malefic potentialities. Conditions determining the investigative outcome re­duced the body to an iniquitous vessel. Fill ed with malice and the desire to overthrow quotidian stability, the witch ap­peared to represent the deformed underbelly of society. The very notion of community became a referential template with delineated differentials isolating appropriate from in­appropriate behaviour. Endorsing the idea of moral perpe­tuity ensured magical orientated folklore and practice were gradually smothered under the auspices of this stylised form of living. Although this may have given meaning to ideas about how to facilitate a sense of belonging it also avoided having to address the stickier topic of spiritual diversity. This explains the reason why many of the accused witches were considered to be anti-social. Immoral behaviour in­cluded: cursing at neighbours who maltreated them, creat­ing disputes, begging, or simply looking at another's stock with an envious eye. Explanations looked to the unusual in daily events, and in a world where superstitious minds sought comfort from knowing or being able to explain causality, the deformed and wretched, alongside licentious behaviour and the old, pro­duced an array of prime diabolic candidates. Imbibing them with the ability to carry out their suspected deeds could only happen when the accompanying narrative endowed the ac­cused with intent. A range of fantastic accounts were then 134"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Witch's Mark built into the narrative, with the emphasis being on having witnessed an event. Any such abnormality or deformity in this context was then used to challenge a claim of innocence. There is an obvious peculiarity when endeavouring to try and identify a w itch, because in the process of identifying the implicit occult nature, the human condition is brought into stark relief. Affirmation of the Other then appears as an impression which is dependent on the prevaricating au­dience. While wishing to avoid temptation there remained a desire to assert its existence, so as to substantiate beyond reasonable doubt a level of culpable guilt. To achieve this end, the populace bringing the conviction, were required to transgress the order of the day so as to imbibe the proceed­ings with their active imagination. Part of the explorative proceedings required a quality of proof which was going to be hard to fake. It is perhaps no surprise to learn therefore that many of these marks took on the semblance of an ani­mal. A hoof, a hare, as well as all manner of other beasts en­abled a satisfactory conclusion to the proceedings. And yet the voice of the witch or her recorded exclamations over be­ing manhandled, were for the most part never recorded by prosecutors. It is on this point that silences emerge, bringing with it, as it does, further evidence on the various uses for why people needed to acknowledge affliction. Accusatory condemnation of deeds done outside the gov­ernance of the church was inevitably going to attract the at­tention of the authorities as well as the local populace. Af­fliction challenged the Christian orthodoxy and stood as a testament to an alternative world, one which was imbued with properties that opposed the perceived social order. From this supposition we can assume deformity acted as a 135"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR temporal physical mask. Propositioning an alternative spiri­tuality the affliction meta-narrative was largely silenced by the weight of censure. In their attempt to limit the potential of this altogether more evocative Otherness, the local popu­lace embarked on a programme to silence the accused. The mark could then be reduced down to proof of the compact between spirit and human. Rather than giving countenance to the possibility that the affliction was a call to engage with the Other, many people found fear where once there may have been hope. In this way the accused was portrayed as a weak and easily tricked individual. Managing daily pres­sures ensured innovation under this pretext was discarded in favour of a more prevalent malevolence. Afflicted bodies were organised and structured according to the enquiring element of established and renegotiated narratives. At the local level any opportunity to counter this hegemony was shied away from, on fear that denouncing, an antagonist might also face a similar raft of accusations. Affliction there­fore guided the viewer away from thinking the person ac­cused could have any good reason for their malice, or for that matter partaking in meetings with the Devil. Undermining self-intentionality allowed accusers to colonise the body by usurping the individual's explanation with their own inter­pretation. Superficial concessions of this kind meant any agreement the local populace reached could not run deeper than achieving a satisfactory outcome. As a consequence affliction became the means by which to justify any action that took place prior to being taken to trial or the judgement which ended proceedings. It gave reason and provided the means to find fault. Bereft of daily human contact this figure dwelt on the 136"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Wi tch's Mark edge of human habitation. Cast far from the shadow of the church they wondered from the righteous path, here per­ceived as an object beyond compare. Restricted mobility alongside observed behaviour added a further infringement to their freedom. Placed under overt observation anticipated the moment when the people could finally prove the deleteri­ous effect on their crops, livelihood and personal well-being was due to a single person or a group of diabolic individuals. It is possible under these conditions that alternative rem­edies for managing the increased subsistence pressures, especially having been pushed and shunned by the local populace, began to appear as a viable option. Certainly the depiction of the witch has tended to involve the colourful and rather extravagant portrayal emphasising difference over normality. And yet it is here during this assigning pro­cess that the witch begins to represent the interlocutor to a perceived Otherness. When attempting to comprehend the development of the afflicted mirror, with all of its retentive comparative possibilities, enables distortions of the human form to become something more than a descriptive way for visualising deformation. Instead the witch becomes the ve­hicle to explore the composition of the metaphysical. At the centre of a narrative account or pictorial depiction depends on tensions and differences between the two worlds for the witch to emerge. As found in Haiti or when making a fetish n Benin, the element of difference and embodied imaginings converge and are thereby transformed into a vis­ceral horror. Forms describing Otherness, ranging from the black man to evidence of deformed offspring, challenges our ability to strictly perceive within the guidelines of a moral edict. Beyond the limits of what we know or have probably 137"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR seen, the witch takes on the apparel of something which is not fully understood. This archetype therefore requires us to consider the feasibility of having eroticised areas which pro­vide sustenance for a familiar, to the physical form the witch typically adopts, since both of these inform the making of the impression which we have subsequently come to depend upon for producing oppositional qualities about Being. For the late modern period of history this engagement with something other than what people physically knew or could fully comprehend gave space for poesis. From the nothingness discursive images began to be formed. Stretch­ing into the darkness, in an attempt to contain the unseen threat, meant the metaphysical had to be explored. The af­fliction therefore not only challenged the norm but by build­ing on what had been commonly accepted from before it appeared as an evolved composite expression. With each elaboration, the design of the metaphysical became more explicit. As a self-qualifying referent, witches were only ac­cused by those who believed they existed. They became in this instance the vehicle for limiting the unknown, condens­ing as they did the potential for understanding the relation­ship to their own notion of a perceived Otherness. And yet by investing time and energy in this interpretative exercise, they colonised the unseen with comparable inversions from their seen world. As they proceeded in developing a convincing narrative the emphasis turned to making distortions from their own intersubjectivities. This was achieved by including transformations to the body which were then imbibed with secret symbolic strata onto and into the flesh of the Other. Converging known explications onto the unknown pre­vented normality from taking hold. Instead the extraordi-138"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Witch's Mark nary appeared as a viable proposition. Forging the hidden world into being contingent appeared to rely on making ex­empt any previous application which may have contained positive attributes. Significant relations, however, retained elements of the quotidian, and it was amongst the disfigure­ments that evidence of their esoteric understanding about Otherness found an acceptable elucidated avenue. Affliction under these circumstances signalled other-worldly qualities which in its unified thematic course towards eventual inclu­sion sustained a presence in the minds of the people. Estab­lishing commonality where before there was only disjointed associations determined the extent of the absences present in the depictions. Deformation acted as the portal to their Otherness, for only by acknowledging their difference did abnormality come to embody significance. Containing the presence of the witch, by inculcating phys­ical absences, has created a focal point for all practitioners of the arte. The perceived potency is not realised by encompass­ing all aspects of the given, but rather fulfilment is obtained from assessing the explicit absences. Since these convey the difference between the hidden world and the physical world we inhabit, our attention should be drawn to their Other­ness, or that which makes them different to ourselves. Often diabolical in content these distortions mask the truth that we are what they are not, and this is the bridge that we have to attempt to cross. Affliction in this context appears as a met­aphoric key by which to open the door. For it is not about embodying life history or action but finding within the dis­tortions a principle for understanding Otherness. Reflecting back and into the darkness, the witch as archetype presents an opportunity to create narratives about this relationship. 139"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR Evidence of this transformation through the use of narra­tives is exhibited when examining the portrayal of witches. Affliction with its associated absences, details the initiatory alteration required for someone to become a conduit for the spirits. Through the imagined and yet possibly observed Otherness, depicted witches are assigned gnosis by becom­ing deformed. During the process of crossing over they de­velop distortions to their form. It is possible the mirror itself does not allow us to observe them in their completeness. Our acute perception restricts potential acquisition by only re­ferring to objects as we have found them to exist. The noth­ingness encompassing their wonderings surfaces to prevent full emersion and by so doing blinds us. Yet the qualifying of their significance can only be measured by their partial absence. Liminal in stature the witch sheds the confines of a world governed by empiric findings. Breaching the limit of our knowing, the witch through extant narratives and embodied imaginings becomes some­thing more. Greater, larger, and more resplendent the witch image conceals the devices for making them so. Residual sig­nifiers, delineate them as something else, through the con­cealment of half realised signs. Ambiguity dominates their depiction, although again it is from this impartiality to their Being, which forces them to take on a diabolical appearance. As we struggle to fully comprehend their station in the meta­physical world, so their affliction increases. It is as if their existence depends on us not knowing fully their capacity to bring about change. And it is change or rather becoming the witch that requires physical transmogrification. There is a difference however between the afflicted person who becomes a Vo dou ritual specialist and the witch. One"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Wi tch's Mark of the main aspects missing from historical accounts is the absence of reports about resistance towards the spirit's ad­vances. Whereas in Haiti the ritual specialist is gradually in­stalled over a period of time under the scrutiny of the local populace, the surviving narratives about witches from the early modern period tend to rely on trial records, and this has ensured that any obvious testified claim about resistance has been omitted. Transformative processes are then only brought into relief as part of hindsight. This depends on the installation of remoteness to counter the contention of an otherwise reliable eyewitness. So although the conditions may be different, as we might expect given the location, time and societal differentials, the affliction continues to act as an embodied signifier for Otherness. One example will here suffice, but it is expected that readers of this text will look to other images to find suitable comparisons. Hans Baldung Grien's A Group of Wi tches, printed in 1510, predates the era discussed above, yet its symbolic signifi­cance testifies to a prevalent dialogic narrative about witch­craft. Not only that, but upon being published at the time it contributed towards furthering the development of the witch as a diabolical icon. Zika is quick in The Appearance of Wi tchcraft 63 to notice the nakedness of the witches surround­ing the cauldron, which is placed within a triangle demar­cated by forked staffs. Zika identifies these forked staves as cooking forks which were used at the time for tending fires. As already mentioned the cauldron takes centre stage, look­ing very much like an urn, it has around its edge a cypher in 63 Zika, C. 2007.

The drawing captures the five witches in the process of practising a ritual which involves the offering up of food as seen by the witch with accompanying cloth, while another holds a ladle which she uses to open the cauldron while the witch sitting within the triangle holds a drinking cup. From the cauldron one can see a bilious vapour pouring forth from the cauldron and contained therein a toad is carried towards the night sky. Zika throughout the course of his description focusses on the sexualised content. This is nowhere more apparent than the backward facing witch, with legs stretched apart, astride a goat riding through the sky. These gestures evoke ideas about a woman's sexuality and yet within the context of the whole picture other possible interpretations begin to make themselves known. Zika mentions and yet cannot explain, why there are skulls lying to the left of the picture, while on the right an animal which looks like a cat stares out into the darkness from behind the witch. He also mentions the con­vex mirror thought to have been used for ensnaring demons and divination. Indeed the whole scene invites the viewer to be distracted by the sexually exciting content. Entertaining the mind with possibilities encapsulated by the frenzy of the ritual serves to disorientate the viewer. Ex­aggerated distortion, alongside the absence of civility causes the viewer to explore the details of the ritual activity.

Each witch looks to be relatively old and yet stages in age remain an integral part to the narrative of the picture. The most youthful of the witches can be seen flying through the sky, while the two sitting at the forefront look to mirror one another, and therefore are of a similar age, while the old witch seems be the most animated. This animation challenges us to know more and therefore must be considered to extend beyond simple titillation. Although this must have been a theme to the drawing, it is possible to consider Baldung's drawing as evoking a different level of symbolic strata. Reflecting an Otherness associated with affliction, A Group of Witches may actually depict stages of empowerment with the oldest most decrepit looking to be the most agitated and powerful of all them. Described as a group, it is suggest­ed that in fact this also works as a referential staging post illustrating the gradual degradation of the witch into an af­flicted form, in this case defined through the representation of age. However the degree to which this lends itself to our discussion about the afflicted mirror requires a step by step appraisal based on the themes of the work. In many ways the context of this woodcut is in concert with perpetuating the witch archetype. Having gathered in a wood the drawing does nothing to embellish the witch's surroundings. Our apperception for knowing Otherness is drawn to the actions taking place, yet the location and how the space is occupied cannot be ignored. The ground is be­reft of any kind of undergrowth and the only tree in focus, which acts as a supportive spine, is broken and bare. Playing on the notion of fertility and everyday activities, the location demarcates a place beyond the sight and sounds of civilisa-143"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR tion. The wilderness encroaches upon the site, and by doing so contributes towards framing the ritual setting. In the distance trees are shown to be in leaf, yet the world of the afflicted witch depends on the opposite of light and life. As a consequence the absence of the quotidian presents the viewer with barren surroundings, thus imparting a sign to the observer that this place is not for human habitation. And so we are presented with the ritual arena, the place where conjurations will take place, where the worlds seen and hidden shall converge. Out of sight and surely out of earshot, Baldung's draw­ing invites us to witness secret magical activities. Accentuat­ing the importance of the place by being under the cover of darkness limits our perspective, since we can only see what is in the foreground, and as such the quotidian is masked from view. Overlaying such extravagant filters emphasises our innate attraction to the grotesque and supports implicitly our need for entertainment which \"fires\" our imagination. Claustrophobic in its design the overwhelming presence of the setting predicates the type of ritual being witnessed. For in its isolation the ritual display takes on the appearance of celebratory proportions. Clothes are cast aside, hidden from view the naked form suggests another possible absence or rather a departure from the expected moral demeanour normally on display in villages and towns. Abandoning the robes that conceal the flesh, their nakedness, although acting as a form of entertainment, also suggests a hidden knowledge associated with having the necessary skills to congress with nature. Incapable of sustaining societal re­striction, the witches seem to revel in their liberation and yet the aesthetic beauty of the piece lacks any further engage-144"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"HANS BALDUNG GRIEN: A GROUP OF WITCHES"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR ment. The reason for this is that the drawing's purpose is to give the impression to the observer that he or she is watching the ritual actions of the witches, rather than it necessarily be­ing about summarising their immorality by sexualising the female form. If this was the case then we would not expect to see the accoutrements of their work lying in the foreground. Zika surmises what these articles might mean to the witches, and as a consequence the significance of their inclu­sion for the observer. Evidence of the dead is scattered in the left comer, and for this Zika wonders whether they have a necromantic purpose to serve. When considering the com­mon depiction of skulls and death in art at the time, these remains surely suggest something other than nefarious de­sign, for skulls were the vernacular for mortality. It is there­fore likely that rather than this referring to necromancy, the body parts convey an aspect of the participants Otherness. The possibility of this being so comes from the bones lack­ing a focal aspect, instead they lie discarded on the edge of the ritual arena. A transformative quality inscribed by the overturned skull announces to the observer that they have transgressed civility by wondering into the wilderness, and this deserves to be attended too by employing appropriately suggestive imagery. In the centre of the foreground there are a number of in­teresting ritual articles: the eye is drawn to the convex mir­ror already mentioned and yet a bundle of hair, a brush for applying ointment or salves, and a bone not only gives the viewer further insight about theirintentions, but clarifies the acquisition of an alternative type of knowledge. Enticing evidence from the drawing brings the affliction to the fore since all the identified articles retain a theme of having the 146"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Witch's Mark ability to bring harm. All of these ritual utensils rely on a level of moral revulsion. Being partnered up with circum­stantial conditions makes their difference to the everyday more explicit. As such they stand in opposition to the viewer because in their depiction they seem to have harnessed pow­ers which in any other context would not be understood. Garnering a heightened intensity by acquiring the attributes of the diabolical provides Baldung with the opportunity to build into the picture a warning for those who are tempted to undertake similar ritual procedures. The possibility of becoming affiicted in this instance is then being used as a highly evocative and significant tool for warning people off from walking down this particular diabolical path. Turning our attention to the central witch, we find she is the only one present who is sitting within a designated ritual area. The triangle marked out by cooking forks indicates a moment when she is conjuring the spirits. By acting as a pivot she becomes an engaging agency capable of dictating the movement of the eye over the depiction. To her back rests a cat, looking away from the ritual activities it seems be staring into the darkness. Being in the right corner of the picture is it is hard to ignore the relationship between death and transformation as illustrated in the left corner. Resting back against back, the cat and the witch are joined in a famil­iar union. With the witch's attention being on the ritual in a place of Otherness, the cat sits as her familiar, the watcher between the hidden and physical worlds. Between the witches legs rests the vessel which presents to us the greatest spectacle of all. From underneath the lid a cascade of vapour pours out and rises into the air.

In an attempt to em­phasise the animated strength and life held within the cur­rent, a toad appears to be carried along and into the night sky. In direct contrast to an image of procuring food at the homestead the dynamic nature of the vapour from an inert vessel testifies to the power of the witch and her associates. The witch who sits directly out of the staved triangle looks on, while holding to the sky a cup or goblet in salutatory pose. Her posture adds a further dimension to the draw­ing, since she sits with her legs open, but this time her ex­posure faces away from the viewer. Having her back to the picture she sits up against the bones and overturned human and horse's skull lying in the foreground. Her posture mir­rors that of our central witch. They therefore mirror given aspects of affliction. The cat as the familiar, fe eds from the witch to gain its sustenance, while the salutatory witch, hav­ing left the demarcated ritual precinct, conveys the signs of transition. Both are actively engaged in exerting their vi­sion of Otherness through the sequence of ritualised events. Forever moving away from the everyday concerns, Baldung seems to embrace the notion of deformation through the use of these subtle motifs. The afflicted form is nowhere more apparent than with the old witch standing at the back of the woodcut. Reach­ing over and into the ritual area she musters the full expres­sive extent of the afflicted form. In a similar portrayal to the description of Metres Erzili, her being is enveloped by age. Ravaged by time, her body is measured by the grotesque imaginings of her authorial position. Driving the spirit of the depiction forward she becomes the icon of Otherness.

Entranced, she holds to the sky the food offerings to nourish the spirits. She is in this mo­ment an oppositional figure to the everyday. By representing through her comportment to the other witches the enrap­tured frenzied strength of someone who has embraced her Otherness, she commands our attention. As a mirror to the mundane she challenges us to confront the means by which the Self is constituted. Although beyond the strict remit of this work, Baldung's depiction is replicated in many of his other woodcuts, with this background or transitory vision of the old afflicted witch being emplaced in a dominant position. Between life and death she stands at the gate, and thereby marks the point of transition as well as transgression. She is the leaper who pivots on the edge and stares into the nothingness. Investing in the hidden world the affliction carries her for­ward and gives her strength through a deformed exposition about the body. As a consequence she reflects back upon us the potential for making ourselves self-aware. But Baldung's woodcut also reveals a temporal manifestation, replete with exaggerated gestures and body postures. He seems to consciously play with the perception of the viewer through the use of time. Potentialities of Being are consequently acknowledged by him, with the present set of ritual imple­ments and actions delivering an evocative performance. Capturing a moment in and outside of time simultaneously condenses his message. For the witches are defined by time dependent parameters because they are working under the cover of darkness, yet the thrust of this work is that it is itself a timeless abomination.

Whether Baldung was conscious of his endeavour A Group of Witches emits a visceral presence by its absence to our present position. The distance gained from the viewer stems not only from the difference in time, but also through the evidential results from having witnessed the portrayal of this ritual performance. Under these circumstances the woodcut rather than operating as a spectacle to deter people from cavorting with witches, or becoming a witch, actually encourages engagement through the visual. Of course that particular possibility derives from a contemporary viewer's standpoint, although it would be difficult to not imagine with all of its inherent flaws that people who first viewed this woodcut weren't taken by the activity being depicted. Resonating with a commonality for the domestic, the ritual implements on display became significant because of their connection to the home. Based on personal experience the use of these specific utensils generated a sense of knowing, simply by there already being a consensus about their iden­tity and appropriate application. The ability to capture an Otherness without reference to everyday activities cannot therefore be ignored. But what are the connections and disconnections being experienced by the Self when viewing this assemblage of witches caught in the midst of ritual action? Their work is exposed suddenly in this portrayal of magic, naked and oblivious to observa­tion, they are absorbed by the moment. Moments such as these push the viewer into restrictive scenarios where an expectation to imagine brings another altogether more per­sonal descriptive narrative to the vision. Forcing the viewer 150"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Pact and the Witch's Mark to observe the whole ritual semblance the Self is orientated into an oppositional position. It is impossible to avoid this outcome, because the fantastic element to the visual can only be comprehended by disembarking from the contact site. Separating the subjective Self from the objectification of the Other is more explicitly undertaken because the sig­nificance of the portrayal confirms for the person aspects of their knowing as well as inferring the presence of unknow­ing silences. As such the process of depicting an Otherness substantiates prevailing tensions between different states of Being. On the one hand there is the interaction with a known world, however this particular perception is never complete­ly realised, but instead shifts and changes according to the various types of daily engagement. These combine to make an impression of the subjective identity which itself divides according to the notion of Self as an individual and the im­pression others have of the person. Each perceptive process has influence over how the self is constituted. Recognising this intersubjective dimension explains how the accumula­tion of influences makes a person appear as the summation of opinion. The intersubjective moves the viewer away from the no­tion that the Self authors the world alone, but is rather sub­ject to external influences. It is in fact a continuous process which is being witnessed. For the need to appraise, so as to make a claim on the world, transforms elements from the everyday into significances for the beholder. When this is ap­plied to affliction and the inherent tension between what is seen and unseen, the same appraisal process appears to take place.

But this probability runs even deeper, because the idea that we have found a subject worth separating becomes an­other part of the intersubjective enquiry. Finding reason for why divisions need to exist catches the individual in an end­less cycle of 'becoming'. Shifting between temporal states of Being draws out oppositions, which are then raised for the purpose of making sense of the world. According to this cy­cle of knowledge acquisition, the emotive topics of affliction, abnormality and deformity confront the mind with possible scenarios which threaten to degrade the complete impres­sion a person has of him or herself. It is probable the Self will project a contextual scenario which distorts its own physical capacity to make sense of the Other. Having been exposed to a prevalent sense of Otherness by imagining the extent of an affliction upon a stable constitution opens the individual's sensibilities to these external forces. Exerting an imagined difference accentuates the witch's position towards the everyday. But this difference, the very face of the Other, extends beyond our imaginative ability. Through aftliction the form of Otherness appears as some­thing to possibly fear. The transformative quality it brings subdues any lasting uncertainty people may have towards them. By articulating the mysteries of the hidden world through physical difference leads to the world inhabited by others emerging from the dim recesses of history.

It is possible to run this course even further into the depths by assuming the metaphysical is a stable entity. It could be assumed that the metaphysical only becomes so after the event has taken place, once the event has been told and elaborated upon. Only then does it become something different, although its description even under this light is subject to a specific intersubjective gaze. Yet we still have to acknowledge the possibility that the metaphysical does not actually denote difference but rather sameness. It being the projection of ourselves into a world that cannot be physically touched, the metaphysical extends into the beyond a nebu­lous nothingness. Nevertheless the extension also works as an intervention since the metaphysical has the ability to im­pede on everyday activities. Though it may be diffi cult to as­sess the trajectory of ourselves in this matter, keen as some may be to see the unusual in our daily lives as an interven­tion from an Other, it is possible our imaginings about there being an Other informs the intervening style and substance of the experience. This does not take away from the possi­bility that Otherness has independent intentionality. Rather by questioning its composition the possible dimensions of Otherness provide insight into its significance for the occult world. 158"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Conclusion THE PRESENCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANT OCCULT PA RTICLE l}To discern something as being present in a m\"tcirlal way n• quires the acknowledgement of something being thfrt that can be seen.

Indicating a response towards something makes the pres­ence present. A key aspect to there being something which is considered present, depends on engaging with an object on a level where it has become more than it would have other­wise have been. The transference from acknowledging to the making of a signifier verifies the conscious decision, which is required to transform the object into having a presence. One way of externalising this making of presence is by providing a personal example. Sometime ago I entered an antique market, and having spent some time surveying the stalls I beheld a small bellarmine bottle in a display cabinet. Positioned amongst other nondescript items which I did not stop to take account of, presented a contextual foil which accentuated the incongruity of the vessel's position. Com­monly referred to as a witch's bottle these were used to ward off evil spirits across the 16th and 17th centuries. Sometimes found under the threshold of old houses or in the River Thames, these were also thought to have been used as curs­ing vessels, having been found to include animal parts im­paled by nails and pins. My attraction towards this artefact did not diminish even when it was found that these intended objects were no longer contained within. At the time of find­ing the vessel I was not conscious of any explicit cognitive processes contributing towards this being something I want­ed to acquire. Yet my interests predicated my desire to own this vessel. Other contributing factors also played a part, for instance I needed to assess whether this was at a price which could be afforded. Whether this actually gave the object a partial presence is debatable and yet the fact of the matter 160"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Conclusion remains that its acquisition depended on its material and subjective value. My proclivity to find this vessel as enticing illustrated my focus as being somewhat different to the countless oth­ers who may have passed the object and had not noticed or had no interest in what it was. Its presence became so be­cause of my inclination towards it as a historical artefact and its relationship to old witchcraft practices. Overarching categories often mask the exact aspects of the connection being made, yet I knew it was not the history per se or the sublimated witchcraft practises which truly reified the ob­ject into having a presence, but instead the survival of the artefact and its personal yet forgotten history. With this, the importance of it having a presence was made and amplified by the combination of referential factors which together gave it an overwhelming absence. My predetermined inclination for engaging these factors gave the vessel a significant depth. When placed together with a corresponding pre-given pro­clivity for collecting artefacts which resonate with human magical endeavour the presence became set. Combined with the circumstances leading up to finding the vessel, the choices which were made on where to go, with the potential prospect of finding something significant, also primed the situation with a potential for making an unanticipated en­counter special. Yet with all of this composition, the details of the event where a presence was encountered only occurred after the moment and the subsequent acquisition of the object. Be­coming aware of the processes involved which led to acquir­ing the vessel, gave the initial presence being experienced upon first seeing the object an added significance as the tale 161"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE AFFLICTED MIRROR was recounted to others. This doesn't mean however that the processes are ever made explicit, for even when reflections are conveyed there is a certain amount of censure that takes place. In principle the information about the experience is discerned as being relevant by assessing what people need to know. A decision on what details should be included or excluded when the tale is recounted is then determined by relating the pertinence of the subject to the person being told the story. Experiencing a presence is not exclusively about what one can see. Nor does it depend on prerequisite sensibili­ties and presuppositions when assessing the resthetic value of a physical object. Nor does it depend on it having a tac­tile quality. In the case of the bellarmine there are aspects of its presence which have never been defined by the physical. Keeping with its tradition, the presence of the vessel is about what lies beyond, in the imaginings that inform the purpose, from the intentionality which influences my imagination. This artefact hinders investigation, it is unlikely I will ever discover where it was found, or whether this was ever used as a witch's bottle, and I will never know what the thoughts were of the person who first used it, and the reasons for its use. These silences flood the senses with wonder and cause me to venture further conjecture. Lost to its original purpose, this bottle has a presence through its absence. Lacking a pre­cise historical course invites my mind to colonise the empty spaces and give voice to what has been forgotten. Yet I do not know what has been forgotten and what has been retained. From the point when I first observed it resting in the cabinet I knew it had to be mine, but why? What were the reasons for this decision? Was it because of its presence or because 162"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Conclusion of its absence? Not knowing its life history caused me to be fascinated. I pressed my presence into this absence with my partial knowledge and thereby made it my own. I superim­posed my impression of meaning into its cavity and by do­ing so claimed ownership over it. In short, I gave the bellar­mine a presence. Although this presence continued to hold no physical importance, it seized me with a desire to belong. Having no guardian, it coursed through centuries seemingly unblemished by its transit. I now own this artefact, but its meaning will only live for as long as I live, we are connected, my presence gaug­ing its presence by its absence to anything that I can relate too. Born of another time, it remains content to challenge me on how I might acquire its embedded vacant knowledge. This 'insignificant' bottle invites me to tap into its silence, to know its darkness, to understand what it means to forget. These are the emotions invading the absence that create a presence. It is after all, nothing other than a clay fired ves­sel, yet its function ripples through the ages and causes per­petual motion. There is nevertheless one aspect to all of this that troubles me. Am I not, by divesting my notion of Self into a physical object, afflicting its physical presence with a contorted absence which further leads to me feeling satisfied about making the acquisition? In its absence I am distort­ing its Otherness so as to accentuate a sense of difference to me. By it having an absence, which I have also authored, I have afforded myself the opportunity to make claims about its presence.

The magical circle depends on its demarcation to make it so. It does not exist as a mark of invited congress unless it first appears in material form. In a wood the circle inscribes the intention of the practitioner, it signals to the visible and invisible an intention to serve and conjure. The circle's presence how­ever is only made so by it becoming visible. Its presence to a perceived Otherness only becomes significant once it has appeared before 'them'. The circle like the vessel has a pres­ence because there is an overwhelming absence which can­not be contained. If this is indeed true then practitioners cre­ate distortions in their endeavour to \"know more\". Afflicting the absence by offsetting Otherness enables the presence of the here and now to penetrate the perceived absence with in­tention. Never complete, its aspect only speaks of one given potential amongst many. From the nothingness the space becomes colonised with our impression of what there should be. Gathering a selection of apposite meanings gives the op­portunity to apprehend the extent of the deformation so as to make sense of the prevailing absence. MAKING THE OTHER AN OTHERNESS tJTo acknowledge something as being Other involves accept­ing in the first instance a distance between the body and that which lies beyond the physical form.

This doesn't nec­essarily mean it is void, but that there is no adequate mea­sure by which to limit its potential. Although its potential is again predicated by what the viewer thinks the Other is, only then can any attempt to be made to access this phantasm. Being undefined, this apparition brought on by believ­ing there is something else out there, beyond our sight, has not stopped or limited people's desire to capture and con­tain that which cannot be held. Evidence to quantify the limit of its existence has been illustrated through the top­ics covered in this book. Depictions of the Devil, the witch's countenance, the lwa's appearance, all convincingly suggest their constitution pertains to their actual form. As has been argued above, the transformation of the Other, into some­thing which has substance, which can then be related to, has resulted in their depiction relying on distortion. Unable to apprehend the purity of their form, their absence has been transferred into a presence by principally essentialising their imagined Being. Affliction has thus been used to mark their absence with qualities that reflect the contemporary world. Their afflictions thereby resonate with the conditions being experienced at the time. Nothing more than an approxima­tion the Other has become so because it has been placed in opposition to the living world. And if this Is true then the Other has been used as the mirror for understanding our­selves. Throughout the course of time, god names, sigils and signs have been utilised to contain and bring focus to the nebulous. Numinous emanations from the other side have been perceived to be so because a name has been given by which that impression has been contained.

Inspired insight has appeared as divine instruction, yet the circumstances which have led to the making of this gnosis has relied more on the innate proclivity of the individual to make sense of the phys­ical world. It is perhaps easy to overlook the role of the individual when considering how new magical works have been cre­ated. Those who were afraid of witches projected their fears and insecurities into Otherness and as a consequence gilded the witch with a diabolical ardour. Challenged and pilloried these persecuted individuals were doing nothing more than attempting to control their environment. Evidence from Haiti also details similar examples, the lwa guide their devotees, conceal their true appearance and de­rail any semblance of equilibrium if their position is under­mined. They reflect back onto Haitian society the vagaries of the everyday and the challenges that people face. Neither evil or good, they exist as people exist, and so it is that both lwa and people mirror the others behaviour. The Other in this instant becomes an Otherness, an unquantifiable reflec­tion which distorts whenever an attempt is made to touch it. Like a finger which presses onto the surface of a pool, the ripples from making contact cause the tension of the water's surface to distort without end. The conceptual aspect of The Affl icted Mirror has therefore relied on using the Other as an umbrella term for acknowl­edging an informed difference to everyday life existence.

During the course of this book's development I have been lucky enough to have received the unrelenting support of Daniel Schulke at Three Hands Press. During the course of writing Daniel was always there at my side even when an ocean conspired against us having face to face discussions. By being my counsel and guide he has become a dear friend and to him I owe a particular debt of gratitude. As my greatest critical editor, as well as providing artwork for this en­deavour, I thank my wife Carolyn for her support. This has extended far beyond what I expected, for she has driven me to re-evaluate points and has tirelessly rallied against my frustration at having not received her positive editorial approval. The book is better because of her constant presence and research contribution. Her involvement did not stop there however, for while the writing proceeded Carolyn began to draw the accompanying illustrations. Initially apprehensive at having any form of illustration in the book, I quickly came to realise that her acute eye and inspired form from the words being written enhanced the overall piece. In short, she is the shadow in my form, the presence in my absence and the fire which gives my hearth a purpose. Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank my dearly de­parted Renold who died of consumption in 1999. Renold not only inducted me into his Vodou lifeworld in Limbe, Haiti, but shared the songs and many of the rituals required to serve the lwa. His experience from having been afflicted is the cornerstone of this book. Without him this book would not have been written. The time we knew each other was unfortunately brief but I still carry Agaou-Djab with me, and I am certain Renold will continue to inspire me in all my future writing endeavours."}]
