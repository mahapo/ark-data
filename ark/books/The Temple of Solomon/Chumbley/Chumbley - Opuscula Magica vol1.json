Chumbley (I967-2oo4)stand distinct in late 20th-century occultism for their sagacity and vision, specifically their treatment of the witch-cult. The three major texts published during his lifetime, suffused with a lucent apprehension of the arcane, continue to fascinate and command vitality in the field of magic The first of these works, Azoetia: A Grimoire cifthe Sabbatic Craft (1992), enmantled the Witch's Art in universal principles of sorcelJ~ proceeding from the primeval atavistic well of the Sabbat. Informed by many years of magical practice and his own participation in traditional witchcraft lineages, the book was both a slaying and an apotheosis of the witch-construct in popular occultism. restoring her phantasmal and sinistral attributes. Q!ltub, or, The Point (1995), a mystical text of Sufic noesis, identified the continuity of magical inversion and transgressive ethos --summoned as the godform of the Opposer -in many historical forms of sorcery. As with Azoetia, this book wove together diverse magical strands to crystallise a unified body of witch-gnosis. One: The Grimoire cifthe Golden Toad, published in 2000, treated solitary initiation in rural folk-sorcery, particularly the Toad-Bone rites of East Anglia, and their diabolic and transcendental aspects. Each of these works, brought forth by Xoanon Publishing, received widespread acclaim for their originality and insight. A smaller corpus of Andrew's published works, in the form of magical treatises, though lesser known, has been equally influential. These are the subject of the opuscula Magica"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"10 Preface The genesis of the opuscula lies in the Spring of I 996 when Andrew proposed a collection of his previously printed essays to several occult publishers in England. For many reasons the work did not come to fruition. not the least of which was the focus of his Ii terary energies upon The Dragon-Book of Essex and the demanding magical practice required for its reification. Despite the fact that the essay-volume did not manifest at that time, he wrote considerable notes and supportive text, many of which have been drawn upon here. In late 2002, Andrew and I were occupied with the work of preparing the second edition of Azoetia for press. As part of a wider conversation about the aims ofXoanon Publishing, I asked if he planned to bring his collected essays to print. His initial reaction was surprise, deeming the articles of a markedly different magical calibre than his Xoanon works. I raised the point that, given the growing interest in Sabbatic Witchcraft and the published work of the Cultus Sabbati, as well as the rarity of many of the articles, this widely-scattered corpus of work demanded a formalised and artful gathering. Citing commitments to Xoanon, his doctoral research, and overseeing a magical order, Andrew was unable at that time to commit to the endeavour. Yet we agreed that these works, some of which had been published more than a decade prior, still wielded considerable magical and literary power, and were worthy of a prudent reincarnation. After the second edition of Azoetia had taken flesh, the book of collected articles was revisited as a long-term goal. Andrew wished to keep this corpus of work separate from that of Xoanon, with its highly-specified focus as the outer voice of the Cultus Sabbati. Thus an imprint was forged, Three Hands Press, initially for the purpose of publishing works of Cultus Sabbati initiates outside the parameters of Xoanon."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Preface II Work began on a suitable ordering of the articles; Andrew made minor revisions to several essays, and wrote an additional introduction. However, in the final year of his life, work on the article-compilation was eclipsed by the greater concerns of his doctoral thesis. the magical work of the Cultus Sabbati, and completion of The AuraeOI1, his final grimoire intended for outer publication. The present harvest of essays is entitled 'Witchcraft and the Sabbatic Tradition', and indeed one may trace, wending through their procession, not only the historical and folk magical components of the Craft of the Wise, but threads of its more subtle underpinnings as well. Of particular import is the iteration of sorcery as the basis of witchcraft-praxis, rather than a putative 'nature-religion', and its primal link with the ecstatic reveries of the Sabbath. Arrangement of the works in this volume, and others in the opuscula Magica series, is generally thematic. but within this rubric they also appear in chronological order to preserve the evolution of Andrew's autochthonous magical themes. Many essays treat areas of overlapping concern; the present arrangement of texts is thus also governed by considerations of narrative flow, largely following Andrew's structural notations of 1996 and 2003-In most cases, complete handwritten originals of these articles are extant, as well as hand-corrected typescripts. which provided additional texts and editorial insights for this colkerion. The illustrations which appear herein are taken from published and unpublished sources. Many of the latter are various recensions of Azottia written between 1990 and 1992, adorned by numerous magical diagrams that reflect a nascent artistic style which defines that work. Others originate from the fertile period of illustrative activity of the mid-1990s"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"12 Preface that marked the interstitium between Azodia and QEtub, a flowering of Andrew's skills as an artistic visionary and draughtsman, In the labour of bringing these works to print, I have been graciously assisted by a number of individuals whose support of the Work cannot be underestimated, I give especial thanks to Elizabeth Spedding for her collaborative ingenium on the present project and access to the original manuscripts, My appreciation likewise goes to Clive Harper for his editorial counsel and the thorough work of archiving the publications in which these articles originally appeared, Robert Fitzgerald, whose keen editorial eye and constant devil's advocacy was a welcome presence, must also here be given due credit Sincere thanks go to Gavin Semple for his impeccable advice on the manuscript, as well as his bibliographic work in the mono-graph From the Peacock Q!lill, produced with Mr Harper, which underscored the necessity for this collection, My heartfelt appreciation to James Dunk for his assistance in illustrative production, and the faithful restoration of some of the ob-scure images which appear herein, Finally, wi th every honour I thank Robert Ansell of Fulgur Limited, and Michael Howard of The Cauldron, for their sage editorial advice on bringing a work of this importance to light, Daniel A Schulke January 2010, e,v,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Witchcraft and the Sabbatic Tradition I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Proem There are marks upon the magical path: signposts which teach us the Way and its deviations. These signs can come in many forms, as omens, words and sometimes as people. They teach us continually, if we are open to their existence and remain alert and receptive to their voices. People can act as the messengers of the path, narrating to us the comic and tragic tales of fate, demonstrating to us how to act and how not to act. We can therefore thank even those who would throw obstacles in our path, who merely want to dis-pute the Way instead of seeking it. We can thank all, for within both sage and fool alike the Invisible Initiator can disguise and teach. It dances in and out of many worlds; its essence abides in some as 'home' and in others it is just passing through. If it dwells awhile amongst these pages, then only you, the Reader, will know. For myself, I learn much through solitary contemplation in wood, graveyard and meadow; that for me is solace. I also learn from my companions upon the path and to them I must offer my gratitude. My companions are the Night and those who walk within it; they are amid the world, but they are not of it. Amidst all I have sought to make the path my own, to eschew the folly of solely following in others' foot-steps, and thus I have found the secret of the path unique. We can share the path, but not all of our steps upon it. The articles within this book indicate but a few 'steps' which I have taken personally, their words narrate the realisations I have experienced. In writing, the process of realisation has served to crystallise my understanding more completely and this is hopefully to be reciprocated through your own act of reading. Amidst these words and pictures I hope that there are way marks for all."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"16 Proem The articles within this book are gathered together from the various journals of magic, folklore and occultism wherein they were previously scattered. The diffusion of knowledge through such diverse channels was intentional. I wished to address a broad range of people within the en-tire field of the esoteric, from the traditional cunning-man to the modern magician. from the master to the apprentice. This gathering together is likewise intentional. For having engaged the interest of a variety of people who are sincere in their pursuit of the magical path, albeit through very dif-ferent approaches, I thought it appropriate to collect to-gether these various articles so that all may read them in a single, unified context. This is really a metaphorical way for me to talk about the diversity of magical beliefs, the won-drous spectrum of their differences, and the pleasure of being able to address the whole. For there is a design of power which flows and weaves in subtle undercurrents throughout all. The secret of this design is to be realised by each aspirant, uniquely and alone. The seeker must im-merse himself entirely within the current of magic and, in turn, magic will merge entirely with him. This is the secret of the Magical ~intessence: an instant of gnosis cast through eternity: an initiation from the primal source, passed on by the many hands of chance. Aside from the desire to encourage insight and share magical inspiration with the many seekers of the Way. I have some personal reasons for this collection. As a practi-tioner of the Arte, my predilection is toward the sorcery of the Crooked Path and it is through my direct experience of this path that these essays were conceived. Although I consider that the initiatory source of the Crooked Path lies outside of temporal lineage and is revealed \\vithin each"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Proem 17 uniquely, I elect to identify that source within the context of various initiatory streams. It is thus that I participate di-rectly within various magical traditions most notably those of the cunning man and the witch. Throughout this book there is lore pertaining to this personal stance. J hope that such information will give the reader a context for this presentation and also impart some first-hand experiential knowledge into the mentality of the Wytchan Sorcerer. If the content of this book causes you to think about the Arte Magical in new ways, then its primary purpose will be achieved, for magical work of any nature must initiate evo-lution in consciousness. To give oneself the freedom to set aside preconceptions and to simply consider the path and its direction anew, that is a gift we can all afford to grant ourselves. If, by gaining new perspectives. we can realise more fully the scope of magical creativity, we can likewise understand more expansively our own nature writ large amid the infinite possibilities of Mystery Herself. If this book assists any upon the way to freedom, then its work is at one with the very spirit of magic. May the Blessing of the Crooked Path be upon all ... and ever according to its own nature!

Chumbley Chelmsford. 1998 e.v."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"A SHORT CRITIQ!JE AND COMMENT UPON MAGIC Magic is said by some to be a Science, I think that in actuality Magic is a precise art and that there is but a resemblance between Science and Magic in their Method, that of verifying Knowledge by Observation. But Science is a rigid and theoretical construct dealing with empirically observable fact whereas Magic is concerned with the control of hidden energies via a complex cipher of Archetypes, Symbols and Correspondences. Science cannot quantify Belief or, for instance, the energisation of Sigils, but Magic can; not with a standardised system of measurement but through the precise intuitive sense on the part of the individual magician. Science demands proof of its theories and hypotheses but Magic has no need of proof since this would nullify belief in it. Belief is the presumption of a Truth in order to induce its Reality Magic depicts Universal dreams that they might become Manifest Realities. The 'Art' of Magic is to control (and channel the energies of) Belief to realise Desire. It is of note that the word 'Art' in the sense of 'artfulness' implies Cunning and it should be remembered that the old name for a male witch was a 'Cunning Man'; it is a fitting name and Cunning is indeed a principal virtue of Magic. although sadly exchanged by some for common treachery. There is a tendency to make Magic inclusive of far too many things - Philosophies, theories, and attitudes; some people seem to want Magic to include everything in its vast field of Knowledge. I am of the opinion that Magic is a Universal Power, but it is a Secret PO\\.ver, of Mystery, and that there arc secret means of using it. Magic is not for All. It is to be respected and guarded, and not generalized to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"20 OPUSCULA MAGICA the point of becoming lukewarm; it is of no use to make magic popular if it weakens its power, cheapens it, and only increases its commercial value. Many can practice it and perhaps improve the quality of their lives but only the few can work its Mysteries with the conviction of a Born Sorcerer. Magic is not for everyone, if it were then it would be a commonplace vulgarity Fortunately no matter what is written or spoken the True Secrets are always kept Secret I The Arte Magical as a thing of subtlety, of grand poetic ardour, of Awe and of fierce beautiful inspiration is some-thing of exceptional rarity; perhaps this is best. For Myself the Purity of Magic is found in Solitude amid the Glory and Wonder of Nature. Through this primitive fascination, which for many is missing or crushed by Society's culture and sophistication, can be found the fountainhead of Untainted Inspiration. The more 'primitive' or the more simple magic becomes the more effective it is. E.g.: The Working of Rites derived from the innate oracle of Dreams. the use of basic fetishes of wood and stone for magical instruments, divination by Signs and Omens, such wisdom as is evident in the earth and stars. This does not mean the spurning of the intelligent articulation of Magic's complexities in favour of a basic craft-magic that works well yet does not understand itself but rather it is a 'Sigillisation' of specific abstract formulae of magical thought to Primal Obsessions and Glyphic Fetishes.

This"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"A SHORT CRIT1<ZUE AND COMMENT 21 Inspiration must be sought in earnest and if you are to succeed then it must be sought alone.

The Self remains distant from the Work; it is absent, immersed in isolated contemplation; it is the Hand that is possessed of Inspiration driven by Nature's Spirit. Art, in the aesthetic sense, when truly inspired is Illuminative. It has the ability to cause a revaluation and reassessment of our perceptions of the World, and can both clarify our attitudes and change them. It can contain our belief giving it a concrete form that faith can focus upon, and yet Art can also transcend the forms of traditional idols and icons to grant us a glimpse of the Primal Dream that is the root of all Myth and Faith. The First Artist is the most important in History and fortunately is unknown, I say fortunately as he she remains thus the more mysterious and magical. The importance of the First Artist is that he opened the way for Art to demonstrate its powers and gave rise to the awe of others in the artist's unique abilities --thus making him a Magician. To early mankind the first artists must have seemed as mysterious as fire and the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"22 OPUSCULA MAGICA miracle of birth in their ability to translate aspects of Life and Death into the Visionary Permanence of Pictures and Carvings. The Artist was the first to convey Desire and Dream to an objective state, he thus manifested the exteriorisation of our earliest fantasies that by the sympathy of Image to Reali ty they would become True. The role and function of the First Artist and the First Sorcerer are identical and in-separable, that is to fulfil the Dream and bind it to Reality The more we embrace this primitive function the more ef-fective we become as practitioners of the Arte Magical. It is such Sorcerers or Divine Artists in their Solitude that constitute the True Order of Magic. It is an IdeaL the 'Great White Brotherhood', it is without a single true name, its initiates are those born unto the Art, some meet together and some do not, but the Ideal of the network of power-zones forming a Nameless Abstract Sodality has existed through the Ages and will, no doubt, persist through many more. It is not necessary to bring together a Unity of Magicians to work towards the unification of the many currents of Magic but it is of the utmost importance that the individual practitioners are in themselves a Unity --that each is an autonomous cell of the Whole Current. Thus whether in Orders or in Covens or alone, the Individual is the Vessel of Magic, Unique in expression and yet capable of working co-operatively when necessary Through my own Art I have sought to uncover the fun-damental initiating energies of Magic. to look beyond the Images of Deity and of Archetypes in order to gain access to that which gives them power.

The One Current dwells in many houses, flows through many channels, and is comprised of many streams. The more I draw the greater my abstraction of magic becornes, this being shown through the automatism of the Hand; the resulting pictures often transcending the conventional strategies of perception and of recognition, they convey the Inconceivable.

Finally, there is the realisation of Magic as the Origin and Type of all Sapient Endeavour, and; returning to the subject of Science, it has set the patterns where-by all Knowledge has been sought. Magic was the root of Science and still has certain 'scientific' aspects such as Alchemy and Astrology, likewise Magic is the root of Art and Inspiration.

If one is born into a tradition, then this is all well and good, but for those who are desirous of a reunion with native tradition and yet have been distanced therefrom by modern cultural influence, it remains a difficult task to find one's true way. In a sense we must all walk the Paths worn smoother by the passing of Past Adepts, but there is a time when one's individual pathway wanders and takes a unique passage through task and ordeal. Upon such lonely tracks there are none to guide, neither books nor living souls, and so one is required to gaze deeply within oneself and realize the innate predilections and affinities of one's Soul as an integral part of All Nature. Whomsoever is Wise practices no magic but Becomes it. Personally I have been led unto my own Path in two ways. Firstly by birth in the Essex countryside I have naturally gravitated toward the native magical practices and beliefs of my own area -the traditional English Witch Cult -with which I have identified and associated for some years and which is my exterior contact with the Sabbatic Mysteries and is thus my means of assimilating the essence of that tradition. Secondly, I have in Dreams witnessed and partaken of these self-same mysteries of the Witches' Sabbath in all its phantasmagoric splendour. This is my interior contact with the Sabbatic Mysteries, and it is within those Dreams that I haye sought the Arcana that lie at the Heart of All True Sorcery."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"OPUSCULA MAGICA I have, by my natural inclinations, always tended toward Eclecticism, have always been exulted by the realization of Universal Correspondences, and have long felt that underpinning all Traditions of Magic there are a clear and precise set of Principles. It has been the chief objective of my Work to define these Principles and set them out in such a way that they could be used and applied by a fellow practitioner of any tradition -thus I have sought to locate the ~intessential Body of All Magic and reify it within my own lifetime. In my greater dreams, which are set at the Cross'd Roads of Waking, Sleeping, and Mundane Dreaming, I have witnessed Visions which I believe hold the Keys I seek. In that Dreaming, which is the very Continuity of Awareness, I have participated in that which for most is but Mythology, and have danced in the Circle of All Nature, the like of which is mirrored in the Earthly Circle of the Witches' Sabbat. In the Ourobouros-Bound Mirror cifthe One Dream, That is the Oracle of Visions-Itifernal and Divine, I have beheld Eternity's Circle-Dance call'd 'Nature', Whose Patterns have bespoken all sacred Myths of Man. And within Immortality's Border I have danced, Hand in hand with all Worshipped cifMan, With every God and Goddess revered of Our Mortality, Yea, I have known their Touch and Sight, In Conclaves of Blest Carnality.

From a theoretical point of view I seek to realign and find some unity between the seemingly disparate views of the Witch-Cult -that is, between the High Sabbatic Principles of the Ancients and the Pagan Ritualistic Principles of the Traditional Witch. The late Austin Osman Spare was an initiate of the Sabbat and his Portrayal of its Mysteries was and still is of immense value, and yet much of it is at odds with, or at any rate is much more sophisticated than, the Portrayals of the Witch-Cult given by those such as Doreen Valiente or Gerald Gardner. From my own experience of the Traditional Witch-Cult, I have found that within the Ritual Texts there are methods of reification and sorcery that are not readily visible. From one perspective the rites may be interpreted as Pagan religious ceremony and spellcraft. and on another level they may be seen, as portrayed by Spare, as a precise means to Desire Reification via the Sabbatic Ritual and Revelry"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"28 OPUSCULA MAGICA In the works of Kenneth Grant there is also an invaluable insight into the connection between the Sabbat of the Witches as portrayed by Spare and as practiced by the Ancients. Although, I feel, had Spare completed his aesthetic and philosophical expression of the Sabbatic Craft, these connections would no doubt have been made more apparent. It is of interest to note that Spare claimed to have been the Classical Pagan scholar Apuleius in a previous incarnation and even signed some of his work Zos Apulcius, and it is in Apuleius' Book The Golden Asse that a prototype of the central statement of the Pagan Faith is to be found, that is, The Charge of the Goddess. This places AOS at the meeting-place of both the Ancient Greek and Egyptian Mysteries, and also at the fount of the Sabbatic Tradition. Besides working within the same tradition I have a per-sonallink with Spare --Art. I have endeavoured to capture those vertiginous perspectives which he himself could not articulate and yet claimed that he would in a future time. Where words fail I express the Vital Sensations of the Magical Current and try to bind or 'ensorcel' them in pic-torial icons. Drawing thus, in an automatic fashion, is truly contemplative in nature and has led me to many sudden in-sights into the Arte Magical. The greatest illuminative re-alisation concerns the Sacred Alphabet as the Fundamental Point of Correspondence between all Magical Traditions and Systems. The Witch. the Magician and the Shaman, all possess a Sacred Alphabet to encompass the Horizon of their \\Vorks and in this fact lies the ~Iintessence of Magic's Primal Interconnectedness. ff all goes well with my Work it is my intention to publish the Grimoire of the Sabbatic Arcana in which the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":", THE HEART OF THE SORCERER 29 Mysteries of its Ritual, Contemplative Method, and Sacred Alphabet are expounded.

Hopefully, my \\Vork will in time be seen as a serious contribution to Magic, and in my own portrait of the Sabbat's Mysteries there will be seen a glimpse of Magic's ~intessence.

In considering this issue one must attempt to be conscious of the wide variety of viewpoints, taking into consideration the moral, social, and magical implications involved. One must be realistic and primarily accept that sacrifice has a role and a function in the whole field of magical work. By 'sacrifice' I mean the voluntary act of an offering, and this applies to the sacrifice of Time, Possessions and Personal Wealth, as well as to the sacrifice of Life. All genuine practitioners of magick whatever their persuasion, would agree that Time must be sacrificed if one is serious about the pursuit of any magical discipline; this also applies to the offering and devotion of the individual's personal resources and assets to the Path. No-one would disagree with the necessity of these forms of sacrifice, but when it comes to the issue of sacrifice of Life .-the so-called' Bloody Sacrifice' ~ there is a great deal of contention between occultists, and indeed between any persons concerned with the subject of religious devotion. Historically there are references, incidents and traditional practices of Bloody Sacrifice too many to mention or isolate if one is to judge from an accurate historical overview; each act having its own circumstantial and cultural relevance which must be seen in its own context and not from some modern pulpit of moral self-righteousness. The relevance we have to question is the role of such sacrificial practices today -whether or not there is a role."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"QpUSCULA MAGICA Can we justify the taking of another's life for our own ends? If we were to ask an authority of rabbinical law, he would say 'yes' and justify such a sacrifice by his belief that his God has deemed the bloody sacrifice an acceptable offering. ~ite simply, his faith is the only justification required. The same justification would be given by a Hindu devotee of Kali or by a Voudoun Houngan. And yet if we were to ask most Pagans they would probably give us the same answer as most Christians -a categorical 'no'. Their justification would be that their God Gods do not demand it of them, do not need or accept such offerings in this day and age, and that they themselves have no right to take an-other's life. The only right they assert in this matter is the right to lay down their own lives for their faith or their fellow beings. In a social situation where one does not even have the necessity to kill in order to survive or even eat meat at all. then perhaps this justification has some ground, but if such Pagans were to find themselves dependent on hunting and gathering in order to survive then they would soon discover their 'right' to kill.

To the twentieth-century magician the offering of a specific animal to a god or a spirit is not given under the same exterior pressure. It is given out of a belief in some principle or technique which states that power life-force release is conducive to the manifestation of the evoked entity or is conducive to the attainment of some desire or other.

Some might think this is some sort of intellectual cop-out, an attempt to avoid the nasty business of killing animals in ritual-maybe' But in a time when magicians have no excuse for ignorance or lack of thought about these matters, I feel that this is perhaps one answer to the question of sacrifice. At least the offering of one's own blood is genuinely 'felt' and is a true 'sacrifice', a giving of oneself to the Gods, This issue will not go away; it is of no use bowing under the moral pressure of one's Pagan peers or becoming a victim of the scandal-mongering hysteria of the media, We must each decide what we as individuals believe to be right; we must discover for ourselves what our Gods desire from us, Be aware that the actions of a single magician can reflect upon all of us yet if the acts of your faith exhibit reverence for Life and for the living, then you may walk your Path with dignity"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE HERMIT It has often been observed that the greatest of mages is the Solitary, that is to say, he who practises his arte in a truly hermetic environment, focusing himself within the evolving sphere of his own awareness until, through the fulfillment of the Great Work, his paradigmatic microcosm IS of One Identity with all Reality It has also been observed that such is the nature of a 'black brother' or Black Magician.

Magicians self-taught and Magicians traditionally trained are different in their approaches to the subject, but at one point in the path all practitioners are forced into recognition of their necessary autonomy upon the Path of the Arte Magical. It makes no difference whether you have relied on books or people for your guidance; the Initiating Force is veiled by many and diverse personae and may be refracted by a mask of paper as well as flesh, and it will inevitably guide you into a position where you will either fall from the Path or stand firm as a conscious director of its power upon the earth.

There is a singularity of identity between the nature of the True Solitary and the truly autonomous magician. It is perhaps best realized through an understanding of the Sufic maxim: 'To be in the World, but not if the World'. The individual practitioner is literally a conscious focus of the magical current, and as such his activities are an expression and a direction of the current within the world. Whether as an anchoritic isolate or as an integral part of a large organization, the function of the Adept is as a unique power-zone of magical activity, that is, of evolutionary activity The context of his activities should not in any way compromise or diminish his autonomy: the ability to maintain the congruent transmission of the current irrespective of the social context is a demonstration of flexibility: the Current itself is infinitely malleable, and it is only we who are otherwise. It is here that there is a test of one's development and the maturity of one's inner state; for often there is a confusion of identity which becomes apparent in the individual who moves from one context of activity to another. Where one is expected to lead, one should lead: where one is expected to instruct, one should instruct: and where to serve, there one should serve.

It is the inability to fully attain the required degree of in external congruency within one's own paradigmatic sphere of awareness which leads to the numerous pitfalls when attempting to construct or move within any group-structure of occult practice. One of the most obvious pitfalls is that the effort to attain to personal one-pointedness is so overpowering for some individuals that, once attained in an initial degree, it is mistaken for the sole means of subsistence for the magical psyche.

There are many important distinctions to make: distinctions which are presented to the discerning mind through certain underlying principles of the Arte; principles which are perpetually modified by the context of their application and are thus unlike rules of nature which are fixed irrespective of context. These perhaps constitute the subtle tabu of the sorcerous mentality An awareness of these subtleties would perhaps avert or pre-empt certain conflicts of interest which arise within various sections of the occult fraternity and within the various minds which constitute it. There is a design which interconnects those power-zones which are manifest as Initiates.

I make this definition with a distinct purpose in mind. namely its bearing upon the current survivals and the present re-vivals of the Sabbatic Tradition with regard to the emphasis placed upon the preservation of old practices. Theforms utilised by the Sabbatic Cultus in the practice of its craft, the ritual choreography and geometry, the myths, the ritual instruments and so on and so on ... are based upon a number ofprinciplcs which govern function; principles which, although definable, are highly subtle in essence, being universal in their application, infinite in their means of application via their modification in accordance with the diversity of context, and which arc the very Letters and Numbers which constitute the Witches' Alphabet and thus the Grammar of the Arte Entire.

Note also that Ahl-i-haq, the People of Truth -a middle-eastern tribal group, preserve a rite called Sabz which means \"the Making Green of Things\"; they also sacrifice a cockerel at Dawn to mark the liminal edge of night: a custom which has become a glyph of a certain arcanum in Sabbatic Lore. ESBAT -the Witches' lesser rite of meeting where each initiate gives an account of their recent work to the Master and Mistress of the Circle; there is a Persian word identical esbat, meaning 'to prove' or 'to give account'. BAPHOMET -the 'Idol' said to have been worshiped by the Templars; its form was that of a goat's head with a torch between the horns and thus is identical to the Sabbatic Goat: an leon used in the Sabbatic Cult to denote certain arcane.

The magic circle in Babylonian Sorcery was called zisurru -meaning 'flour which makes a boundary'; this was because the circle was traced out by a trickle of flour - a practice still used in the Craft and the rites of Voudoun.

This infers a continuation from Babylon into regions both east and west --that is, into the Near Middle East and into regions of Asia, and it is highly plausible that from the area of Mesopotamia, and more latterly Persia, certain practices spread into Europe, Greece, Asia Minor and beyond.

This practice is based upon a technique belonging to the Tradition of the Sabbatic Craft, and was told to me by a Witch of Essex who had used it with great efficacy. I will merely give such details as are relevant, those with knowledge of these matters will recognize its function. One begins alone in the hermitage of the forest; naked of body one stands stripped of all worldly trappings. This is the centre of the circle and upon it you stand as if newborn from the earth.

One begins to run, and to run without thought: you must not hesitate or care about the thorns, the coldness of the weather, the worldly interpretation of your act.

From this technique the knowledge of many aspects of magick may be gained; it is an example of exposing the body to an act of power. Through repetitive acts such as this the body and the mind are given the freedom to perceive differently; one may dream of such things as shapeshifting, the lore of plants and beasts, the spirits of which myth talk.

In this sense the circle is a mirror, reflecting a reversal of the self; it is this Opposing Form which the aspirant walks toward. Consider the aforementioned technique as an example: it is a means by which one walks upon the Path of the Sorcerer towards That which one is not: The Other. If one can capture the sensation of that Otherness in the freedom of the hand's motion in an automatism of pen upon paper, then has begun the text, the Grimoire of one's Arte. If you can capture that sensation and express it in a willed manner, you are channeling the energy of the Current. 1 I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE SECRET NATURE OF RITUAL The techniques by which the sensations of the Other are attained are superficially self-destructive: one runs naked through briars: one endures abstinence from food or sex: one engages in overstimulation by drugs and fornication: another bathes in the ashes of the dead: and yet another takes a knife to his own skin. Mind and Body are opened, merging with the Beyond and acquiring the extent of the Sentiellt Flesh in Otherness. Fortunately the techniques are such that only the worthy may survive them; many fall by the wayside, trapped by the practice instead ofliberated by it. It is insufficient to overthrow the limits of perception, value and attitude, merely to sink into a pit of overindulgences -addiction, involuntary obsession and imbalance; one must attain sobriety in the midst of self overcoming. The opposition of the normative aesthetic is the means and not the end of the Path. To mistake it for such is to mistake the vehicle for the destination. Ritual encodes the spatial and chronological deter-minants of the Body's interpenetration with the Body of Otherness: it employs techniques which provide the means to align the senses into a new arrangement: to create a form in which the transcarnation of the Void-body and the Flesh will occur. The area of the magical rite is the zone in which new time and place are made; it is the void-womb in which the New Reality of the Magical Will may reify. For instance, the geometry used in \"'!estern ceremonial ritual reveals a specific means of chronological rearrangement, that is, a specialised manner of handling 'time'. The circle is cast so as to be aligned to the propitious influences of stars and planets, capturing their temporal power and focusing it within the ritual area. This chronotype may serve as the foundation for evoking times"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"OPUSCULA MAGICA other than the present: if the signs of the planets and zodiacal houses are traced around the circle for the desired time, past or future, then the abstract 'time' of that alignment is brought to bear upon the magician's present domain. We also perceive the manner in which space itself is treated within the ritual area of the ceremonial circle: the planetary circle is a delineation of the solar system and the cycles of the celestial bodies therein. If one incorporates the zodiacal influence, the circle acquires the extent of a much greater field of space: this zodiacal type of the circle may further be seen in terms of the real positions of the stars as in sidereal astrology or as in the formal arrangement of the tropical system. Both are distinct chronotopical forms of the ritual area. By examining the differing methods of dimensional rearrangement in ritual geometry one may see two basic forms -those which create microcosmic simulacra in order to reflect and focus the natural order of the world, and those in which Nature is reorganized to suite the direction of the Magician's Will. These two types of ritual structuring may be defined as assimilative and invertive. The first will incorporate the environment of the perceiver. An example of this assimilative procedure may be seen in the Voudon Tradition. The houngan or Voudon Priest will incorporate elements of belief which surround him and utilize them to maximum effect. In some cases, as in that of the Voudon assimilation of Roman Catholicism. it is done to present a socially estimable appearance, but in purely magical terms it is to utilize all forms of 'believing' in the world which surrounds the practitioner. The second form, the invertive or opposing type of ritual structure. will take the environment surrounding the perceiver and fashion it anew"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE SECRET NATURE OF RITUAL irrespective of its natural construction. For example, the Sorcerer may reverse the prayers of the orthodox religion of the country in which he lives; as a cultural influence upon him the orthodox believing creates a perceptual bias which needs (() be made functional within his own field: that of pure belief. This is not simple blasphemy but rather a deliberate 'emptying' or realigning of belief to functional direction. Often these two 'types' intertwine according to the requirements of locality and situation. One may cite the Sufic sect of the Mullamatiyah, the Jhakri of Nepal, the Yezidi of Kurdistan, the Dhu'l-qarneni of medieval Morocco, and so on, as examples of the assimilative invertive procedures working together in ritual. Yet one may go further and state that each and every ritual performed is unique in its direction and manner of handling 'belief' and the dimensional arena of its interplay with the World of Flesh. The principle of structure and thus of sequence is 'order', and this is the crux of the matter; reoccurrence may only truly occur in finite sequences, and these occur within the possible range of the infinite. Infinity is beyond ordinary perceptible design. Yet in the artificiality of the ritual area, the geometric finite zone is the 'as if' of the recurrent patterns of the infinite: a cipher for the Ideas of Eternity. The word 'ritual' itself stems from the Sanskrit root rta meaning 'cosmic order'. Rta is etymologically connected with rtu meaning 'menses'; this link demonstrates a fundamental level of ordering the world, that is by the periodic flow of woman: the Priestess.

The primacy of Woman, the Great Goddess, within the fundamental systems of human believing demonstrates the elevation of Otherness personified. The Goddess is the embodiment of the primordial structuring principle within Chaos; she is the original establisher of the principles of directing belief --the rhythms of the rtu: the Primal Ritual. Her blood is the colourer of the liminal horizon of time and her periodic reddening stains the tides of sea and moon within the mind and creates the pattern of change; like a stone which is cast into a pool it has ripples, these are the reciprocations on all levels of being, the echo of the menstrual voice throughout the universe. In response to this the Phallic Will extends: the embodiment of transgression. In the five days of the menses there is no conception, no physical generative act; this is therefore the time of magical creation. In the pentagram there is an identity between the five of days and the five of senses; this is the symbol of perceiving in the time of born less ness. In contrariety to the ordained time of conceiving, the phallic will of magick extends to penetrate the bloodied kteis of the Other: this is the Primal Sacrifice. The child of flesh is 'slain' since no opportunity for birth is given; the coitus is solely for the creation of a 'magical child of will' within the womb of the ritual area.

This sentient alphabet pres-ents an interconnecting web which transverses the borders of any defined state of consciousness, it gives an appearance of synchronous or recurrent aspects of the unfathomable infinity of Mystery The states of Dreaming, Sleeping and Waking are given noetic points of reference transcending the limits of anyone state; these points of transference grant the perceiver a personal basis for ritual construction and development. For instance, the chance possession of a talismanic object in waking may be reaffirmed in dreaming; the object is found involuntarily in both states 'as if one were guided to it. The object accretes significance by association of time, place, and feeling within both states of mind, and gradually assumes an identity within both waking and dreaming. With identity comes entity: the object establishes taboo within the psyche and thus a focus, an obsessional vortex, is created for the interpenetration of human and elemental states of Being.

Although there exists a certain number of people who can give first-hand account about the nature of the Traditional Craft, such adherents are, in truth, few and secretive. During recent times there has been an evident surfacing of the Old Craft into the public domain of published literature, books and articles.

The Old Craft is emerging as a Path possessing a diverse array of aspects, ranging from the practical spell-craft generated at the level of folk-magic -the artes of wort-cunning and animal encharming. through a learned spectrum of magical techniques, reaching in apotheosis to the heights of genuine mysticism. In order to clarify this diversity it is useful to cite and give brief resume of specific exemplary observances which are at the forefront of our present resurgence:-The Way of the Eight Winds: this is an East Anglian recension of the Nameless Arte propounded by Nigel Pennick. In essence, it represents a specific school of magical practise derived from, and continuing the Tradition of Cunning-folk indigenous to the general locus of the Cambridgeshire and Fenland regions. It is derived from the initiatory stream of' Sigaldry', a rune10re tradition incorporating both pagan and christian elements in a coherent magical synthesis. Its manner of succession is, according to Pennick. passed down from Master to pupil and is perpetuated by both oral and textual transmission of knowledge. It is of importance to note that in his book. Secrets of East Anglian Magic, reference is made to the Antient Order of Bonesmen, to the magical fraternity of the Horse-whisperers and to the solitary mysteries of the Toadsmen and women. These are other forms of magical practice still operative in the selfsame regions and which may be referred to, in broad terms, as 'Traditional Craft'. Via Nocturna: the Spirit-hunt Covenant.

His"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"72 OPUSCULA MAGICA teachings are derived from both textual and oral transmIssIons of knowledge and, in their entirety, constitute a synthesis of many diverse aspects of witch-lore, I n brief, the central core of the Covenant is enshrined within the state of magical gnosis in which the seeker undertakes the nocturnal spiritual pilgrimage to the Sabbat, The Via Nocturna is therefore the invisible conclave of initiates conjoined through parity of experience within trance-ecstasis, Its wisdom is accessible to those whom have passed through the transliminal gateways of this world and whom have undertaken the initiatory night-journey to the oneiric realms of the Sabbatic revelry. This particular stream of Traditional Craft is notable in its contribution to what may be called 'Witanic Mysticism', the corpus oflore derived directly through the gnostic experience of Sabbatic formulae. In its contribution to this field, the Covenant has been instrumental in extrapolating the inner mystical essence from the teachings of various other Craft observances, most importantly perhaps from that of the Clan of Tubal-Cain. The clan of Tubal-Cain: this is the Tradition of Craft Observance perpetuated by the late Robert Cochrane (I931-1966). According to Cochrane. the Clan was a body of initiates deriving their myth and methods of occult practice from old Norfolk witches. 1t is notable in that the components of its mythic construct show evidence of influence from late medieval daemonological sources, especially with regard to the Teachings concerning the descent of the Watchers, the role of Tubal-Cain and the reverence paid to him as the preceptor of initiatory genealogy or Witchblood.

Cultus Sabbati: this is a name adopted for purposes of com-munication and identity by an otherwise nameless body of Traditional Craft initiates. In its present form the Cultus is served by the author of this discourse in the role of its Presiding Magister. As such I shall seek to describe its na-ture and function with suitable objectivity The Cultus operates as the vehicle for the transmission of the ~intessential Magical Current and is active in the evolVing recension of magical practice referred to in oral, ritual and textual transmissions as 'The Sorcery of the Crooked Path'. Within the Cultus several observances of the Craft are in concurrent operation; this is reflected in the structure of its constituent groupings. These incorpo-rate the working contexts of both covines and smaller working cells; the emphasis throughout all being upon the autonomy of each initiate. An important function of the Cultus is to serve as a meeting-ground for various initiatory streams of the Elder Faith and thereby to act as the medium for the confluence of their magical forces of empowerment. Although its field of operation is presently centralised within the county of Essex. the Cultus is informed by a number of trans-cultural initiatory lines of succession from around the country and farther afield. The core wisdom-teachings of the Cultus Sabbati are passed down, both orally and ritually. through the Transcendental Sorcerie and Gnosis of the Sabbatic Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"74 • OPUSCULA MAGICA These are only four expressions of the Elder Faith, but their diversity is testament to the rich texture of British Magical Spirituality The his-torical validity of these four exam-ples as 'Traditional Craft' is not wholly mine to affirm or question, but nonetheless the sheer creative impulse which they generate is, for myself, the worthiest form of au-thenticity irrespective of aught else. There is a notable impression of creative insight and syncretism imparted by the published work of these exemplars and this lends itself to the further 'answering' of my initial question. It is typical of genuine Cunning-folk to utilise whatever is closest at hand and to turn all influences, irrespective of religious provenance, to the secret purposes of the Arte. It is therefore that the Old Craft embraces for itself an array of attitudes and methods, ranging from the simple matters of spell-craft to the highest ceremonial forms of conjuration.

This may be seen as a natural evolvement from one stage of religious practise to another more sophisticated level, or yet -from an initiatory stance --one may perceive the emergence of Witanic Mysticism as the timely unveiling of knowledge which has always been at the heart of the Tradition. For even as the fire has always burned brightly at the circle's centre, so we and the circle must eternally turn around its axis through the many seasons of Time and Fate; and through the sacred dimension of the Arte, we are brought ever closer to the timeless centre amidst the changing whirl of aeon and hour. It is possible that one might perceive a development towards the seemingly abstract heights of mystical thought to be occurring in rejection of the simple heritage of the 'good folk of Elphame' that have lived before us, but this is not so. For myself and in example, the basic skein of witcherie -the knotted cord -may be used for both healing and hurting, and also for the mystical task of contemplating the stations of the soul.

In general terms and throughout this discourse 'Tradi-tional Craft' refers to pagan magical and religious practices which have been passed down from at least before the be-ginning of the twentieth century Geographically the term herein applies to past and contemporary British folk-magic, but this may be extended to embrace beliefs and practices of European, mainly Northern, provenance. Despite the spatial demarcation assumed for the purposes of this dis-course, the Elder Faith has innumerable forms and can be seen in many far-flung regions of the Earth. Furthermore, the cultural influences bearing upon past and modern forms of Traditional Craft in Britain are many and diverse, bearing marks of knowledge which testify to a distinctive admixture of initiatory streams from around the world. In esoteric, historical and anthropological literature of the latter half of this century the term 'Traditional Craft' is generally used to refer to the forms of folk-magical practise which predate, or run in concurrent distinction to, the modern or 'reformed' recensions of Craft practice. The modern form of Witchcraft is known generically as 'Wicca', although it should be noted that many variations of this modern movement exist and are called by many other terms. In distinction to 'Wicca' the Old Craft is sometimes referred to by its adherents as 'Weikka' ; this is often pronounced in the parlance of Arte as 'Wytcha'. The common root of these variants is held to be the Indo-"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? 77 European WE IK -said to signify 'The religion of the sorcerers'. Other useful connections and derivations are as follows:-Anglo-Saxon wicce wicca 'witch'; wiccian -'to cast a spell', witte-'wise', witan --'to be wise'; Old German Wikkerie .. '\\Vitchery'; Icelandic vita -'To know' , vitki -'a wizard'; Swedish wika --'to bend. to turn'; Norwegian vikja -' to turn aside; to conjure away. to exorcize'; Anglo-Saxon wikken _. 'to make evil', hence wicked . 'to be evil' and thus to be yfel -beyond the edge of the mortal concensus of perception. Much discussion is made out of such words and names; this can be made useful to the practitioner since it may encourage new perspectives about the path, but when this cannot be done such discussions are irrelevant to those engaged in the practise of the Arte. One should pay heed to what is of use within the circle and what is not, Certain scholars of conventional academia have claimed that the word wicca was originally used solely in a pejorative sense, that is, as a term of abuse or slander against anyone disliked or suspected of malificia or black magic, and that it has, in fact, been out of use in any form whatsoever until the modern witchcraft movement. One may nonetheless cite the non-pejorative use of connected derivations such as witan -'to know' - in various historical instances. However, irrespective of such claims. it may be stated that the derivant word Wytcha has been in use during the twentieth century amongst certain contemporary descendants of the Cunning-folk Traditions in Essex. Whether the term has been passed down through centuries of secret practise or resumed as a identifying name only yesterday, it is pertinent to state some of the reasons for its present use. From the perspective of one practitioner the adoption of this term is a self-conscious means of stating"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"OPUSCULA MAGICA identity as one of the Cunning-folk as a 'Knowing One', a bearer of wise-blood and thus as an initiate of the true witch tradition. Also wytch being 'to bend or turn' is appropriate in regard to the 'crooked' nature of the sorcerous path. If the pejorative use of wicca is accepted, then the present use ofvVytcha embraces this. The Man of Arte moves at the edge of society; he walks within the world of Mankind but is truly' outside' of it. A path of blame and slander will be trodden out of necessity when one moves beyond the normative parameters of society Furthermore, one could say that 'Wytcha' is simply the correct pronunciation of the Anglo-saxon word wicca and that it is used self-consciously by contemporary Cunning-folk as a deliberate reclamation of unique and distinctive identity amongst the scope of modern magical religion. This being said, it is a customary preference of such practitioners to use the self-identifying terms of'sorcerer' and 'sorcery' for themselves and their Arte, and more often than not to use no name at all. Other epithets in use for the Elder Observances of the Craft are, as mentioned above, 'The Nameless Arte', 'The Via Nocturna', 'The Sabbatic Craft' et alia. All such epithetical names may be used in discussions of magic in order to give a name to 'something' which by nature has no name: names are functional for the purposes of communication and self-identity. Whilst it is useful to define and therefore distinguish the various modes of the Old Craft from one another and from their modern counterparts, it should be borne in mind that in certain instances the Old Craft has merged with or adopted beliefs and practices from such reformed observances.

However, the various forms of modern Wicca are not the mJ.tter in question and although they have an important role within the history and development of magical practise in the twentieth century, it is the purpose of this discourse to enquire into the nature of those streams of the Craft whose provenance is of greater antiquity. For within such streams will be found a syncretism which has simply been operative for a longer period of time and is thus likely to have absorbed more influences and to have integrated these within a body of greater spiritual maturity The integration of modern Wiccan influences into older magical streams is but one aspect of confluential development; there are many other influences upon Traditional Craft practices which could also be cited. In speaking about such integration, I must, for courtesy's sake, give full respect to those practitioners of the Old Craft who view their own observances as pure and distinct. The fact of influence from other sources is no blemish nor is it a necessary act of compromise: it can be a conscious part of an ongoing creative spirituality Within the context of my own path I have had direct contact with initiates of other notable magical traditions and have always learned greatly from such interaction. Such contact has led me to active involvemennvithin the Paths of the Uttara Kaula Tantrikas and, upon a subtle level, with the Sufi Tradition of the Ovaysi}Td.

A deeper consideration of such influences I shall leave aside for another occasion. Fundamentally, it is the motives which underlie the purposes of such interaction which, for me, distinguish the various streams of the Craft. In Belief, we are all driven by seemingly similar motivations, but amidst the Breed of Cain there is a distinctive methodology of Believing which has arisen out of natural disposition toward a sorcerous mentality. It is not for nothing that they are called 'Cunning-folk\" When talking of Traditional Craft there is often much mention of it being something 'passed down' or 'passed on'. What is meant by this turn of phrase> From my own experience as an initiand and initiator within the Sabbatic Cultus, I can recount several ways in which the Tradition is transmitted from one person to the next over the generations. The most obvious way is that of oral transmission: the spoken word. This is the 'ear-whispered knowledge' that is related from one practitioner to the next, whether from Master to apprentice, or in the manner of knowledge shared in discussion amongst contemporaries in a circle or clan. It is often in this context that the most precious pieces oflore are preserved and it is around such unwritten wisdom that an aura of taboo exists. For in being untranslated to the written word the oral teachings of the Craft exist in the realm between Thought and Text; they dwell with the spirits in the shifting realms of memory and re-membrance. When should sllch lore be written down> --this is a question I have often asked"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? 81 myself. In answer, I conclude that one should write down such things when there is a danger of their being lost or forgotten. Nonetheless, I believe that nothing is truly forgotten about the Arte, for within its own domain -the Circle -' the spirits will speak to those with ears to hear. It is by word of mouth that the true and invisible grimoire of the Cunning-man is carried through the ages: it is a book whose leaves are scattered amongst many hands and yet is bound in a common cloak of skin and blood. In certain instances, the oral transmission of the Tradition is performed in the formal context of instruction. This is where the spoken mode of transmission is operative within the specialised context of ceremonial initiation. This leads us to the most important manner in which the Tradition is passed down: the ritually transmitted genealogy of spiritual power. This is a complex matter due to the variety of procedures involved, but basically the process to which I am referring is the fulfilment of an aspirant's initiatic induction via the ritual point known as 'the passing-on of power'. This is the magical act whereby the entire power of the Tradition is transmitted directly from an Initiator to his her pupil, as from Master to apprentice. Within various bodies of the Craft, and also within Guild fraternities affiliated derived from Freemasonic Orders, the act of the 'passing-on' is fulfilled thus:· the aspirant kneels upon one knee before the initiator, the left knee directly touching the ground and the right leg forming a square with the earth. The candidate holds in both hands the gramarye or Holy Book of the Order Covine. The initiator in turn places his right hand atop the candidate's head and his left hand upon their right foot, forming a greater square. The initiator then 'wills' all"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"QpUSCULA MAGICA of the power of the Tradition into the receptive body of the candidate. This act, performed in many variations of the manner stated, is executed in order to 'seal' the teaching process through which the candidate has passed. The teaching process lasts for different periods of time and is constructed in accordance with that which is being taught. Within the Sabbatic Tradition, the teaching process is divided into two parts. Firstly, a nine month probationary period is undertaken, during which the aspirant is simply assessed for various requisites of character. When this is completed, the aspirant is invited to take a rite of dedication; this avows them to the path of the Tradition and begins the formal phase of tuition which lasts for one year and one day. During the initiatory year, the candidate is literally led around the circle in a complete circumambulation of mind, body and spirit. At the fulfilment of this circuit, the formal rite of initiation takes place; the central aspect of which is the act of aforementioned 'passing-on'. The act of 'sealing' the tuition process effectively creates the truly autonomous stance of the new initiate. For within the act of the passing-on the entire knowledge of the Tradition flows into the candidate in a state of gnostic transmission. It is then up to him or her to re-member the body of the Tradition according to their own predilection. It will be noted by those acquainted with this mode of transmission, that there are many variations to its execution; these are all equally valid, for it is the initiatic significance encrypted within the ritual gesture which is of sole importance. A third form of the 'passing-down' is the textual transmission of lore; this is somewhat akin to the manner of perpetuating shastras or verses of holy scripture in"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? Tantrism. Within the Craft there are a number of manuscript books or gramaryes of the Arte which are handed down from one initiate to the next. Such books are the repositories of lore belonging to specific streams or observances. Various names are known for such tomes: The Secret Granary: The Bonesman's Bible: The Devil's Plantation; The Dragon-Book, et al ia. Alongside these is the Book of Shadows, the generic name for the hand-written book of Wiccan observance. This name has, in some cases, been adopted by certain members of the Old Craft; its poetic resonance often being the main reason for this. In some forms of the Craft, each candidate must make their own hand-written copy of their Master's book, for each initiate's book of Arte is burned after their death. The essential nature of all such texts is that they are the personal lineal collections of magical knowledge accumulated through direct experience and understanding of the Arte. It is thus that their contents are the sole preserve of their owners; this is their natural taboo and rightly so. The Circle of Arte is cast on many levels and on all it must be cast without a flaw. Akin to the manner of textual transmission is the handing down of magical artifacts. For instance. the passing-on of the wand or stave from Master to apprentice is a form of this custom active in Essex Craft. This establishes a link between initiates over successive generations and endows such objects with a distinctive numen or spiritual aura approximating personality Such objects often bear names which testify to the belief that they have become the dwelling-place of a spirit. It is worthy of mention to note that transmission of magical knowledge can occur solely through the medium of such objects.

From an initiate's perspective. I believe that a magical object can convey knowledge through the activity of the spirit dwelling within it. This form of transmission can operate independently of any other means and can bridge the divide of both time and place. One might, for example, obtain an old scrying-glass from an antique shop or a carved wooden image from a foreign tribal source such as West Africa. Working cautiously with such an object may permit the initiate to engage incommunication with the indwelling spirit and derive therefrom, in trance or dreams, untold wisdom without any physical contact from the object's previous custodians. Such a method of working can bring new influences into the praxes of the Traditional Craft initiate and can activate deep strata of ancestral wisdom which have lain dormant within both the Circle and the body. Although a magically-empowered object partakes most obviously of the material plane, it can serve as a conduit for transmission of the most subtle and intangible kind."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? 85 The passing-on of magical artifacts is in itself a potent means for the continuation and accumulation of magical knowledge and power. It can occur through the seemingly chance acquisition of such, or else can occur in the formal context of the ritual initiation or may even be a matter of family inheritance. This latter form can operate through the initiatory kinship of spiritual descent and or through the blood-line of an hereditary tradition. This brings us to the next form of the 'passing-on': Hereditary Craft and Family Magical Traditions. This type of lineal transmission occurs within the context of familial descent: the knowledge. customs and or magical posses-sions of a pagan magico-religious belief being preserved within the confines of a close-knit and insular kinship group. Such forms of belief can vary greatly from one in-stance to the next. Examples with which I am familiar range from the Traditions of American Hex-craft to the British Christo-pagan faith (sometimes referred to as dual observance) in the power of saints as spirit-guides. Such beliefs can be cited as belonging, although not exclusively. to Hereditary Traditions: for they can also be found tran-secting and becoming operative within other streams. I am at liberty to relate from personal contact, an in-stance where a family preserved an interest in magical and occult matters to the point of collating material from clas-sical sources. such as might be useful in conjurations of the old gods. When a daughter of the family became involved with more modern witchcraft. she then began to use the material passed down to her. The folk-magic, or whatever you might call it. of her family interest became directly op-erative and moved outside of its original parameters. Through subsequent initiatic generations such 'hereditary'"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"86 OPUSCULA MAGICA magical material has become integrated with other obser-vances and has developed into its own stream of succession. Such an example contains elements of both familial descent and ritual initiatory succession; as such it must be regarded as a part of Traditional Craft distinctive in its own right. The manner in which Hereditary Traditions are perpetuated varies from family to family and may be handed down using certain of the ways cited previously. Family Traditions are a rarity and can be highly secretive. In some cases they do not wish to be seen as part of, or as having any connection with, other forms of paganism or magical practice. This has to be respected as an intrinsic facet of their path, but nonetheless such survivals of pagan belief are all part of the spiritual essence which informs the Elder Faith. In instances where a Family Tradition interacts with Crafters from outside the family fold, there can be a mutual enriching of practical knowledge and an assurance of old lore surviving with integrity. Such interaction is, therefore, to be commended. Aside from the previously described ways in which the Tradition is passed down, there are other ways of transmission such as those belonging to the subtle realm. The primary means is that of oneiric induction. It is at this point that I shall cease to write about magic and begin to write through and in magic. It is folly to persist in discussing contexts without contents: the Mystic need not express his heart's revelation in any terms other than those of the heart's native tongue and neither should an artist spend so much time building his own picture-frames that he neglects to paint the picture.

The road to the Sabbatic trance is accessed by means of an array of procedures. often incorporating complex divertive and obsessional praxes of sexual magic and narco-aesthetic induction. The gnosis of the Dreaming Sabbat derives specifically from those initiatory streams of the Craft whose work is focused in Wytchan or Witanic Mysticism (Cultus Sabbati and Spirit-hunt Covenant). Therein. the Sabbat is perceived as the prototypal form of all magical workings and as the unifying circle of a living and vital symbolism. integrating all aspects"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"WHAT IS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? of witch-lore and magical technique. These aspects are re-interpreted via personal mythopoesis and thus re-vitalised by the direct experiential dreaming of the initiated practitioner. From the experience of the dreamer, specific elements are extracted and utilised as the bases for ritual procedures in the waking. The converse can also be useful aspects of waking ritual can be translated into dream and therein can assume new and deeply significant meaning. It is thus that the Sabbat of the Witanic Mystic operates as the crossroads betwixt the worlds and as the arena for the reification of a primal magical power from its source beyond. Initiation into the Dreaming-sabbat is unlike other forms of transmission within the Craft; it occurs outside of the context of temporal linearity and permits the en-trance of anyone possessing sufficient magical ability. Although oneiric transmission is frequently a part of the tuition process within the formal mode of the ritual passing-down of knowledge, it is nonetheless a manner through which any true aspirant can attain entry to the sacred mysterium of the Arte. One might therefore suppose that anyone could claim initiatic status via this means, this may be so, but genuine contact with the inner current of magical gnosis is always apparent and cannot be simply assumed. One must be called forth by night, to leave the carnal house of the body and fly outwards with the Companie of the Spirits.

To return to our beginning: 'What is Traditional Craft'. If we have gained a sense -an ambience by aught in this discourse, then perchance an 'answer' has been given through nostalgic re-assemblance of truth. For we may seek through many ways, but it is often through the atmospheres of magic that its essence may be apprehended in a manner most conducive to the realisation of its substance. I have therefore sought to give brief intimation of the spirit pervading the Old Craft and allied forms of magical practise. With this intent in mind I have made reference to exemplary forms of the Tradition, together with an outline of their range of activity and a precis of five ways in which their knowledge attains perpetuation. All of these aspects transcend the limitations imposed by name and all are often interwoven in a profound contexture of living mythology -in a halo of mystery which surrounds the reality of the Cunning-folk. Some might say the question ought to be 'Does Traditional Craft exist~\". The fact of the title-question and the nature of this discourse are an assertion in the affirmative.

In attempting to do this I shall admittedly be drawing directly from my own experience, specifically from that which I have gained as the present Magister of the Cultus Sabbati. Consequently, a subjective delimitation of the topic is inevitable. Indeed. because the 'Tradition' of the Elder Craft is of so many guises and localised variations, no definitive account of initiatory processes may even be tenable. Undoubtedly omissions and generalisations will occur and for these I offer an apology in advance. Nonetheless, it is hoped that the broad schemata as given below will serve to clarify and to deepen an awareness of the matter in ways hitherto unexplored. With this intent the following article is offered as a stepping-stone to the wiser future of the Way and its children. Passing the Fire-brand of Tubalo-Lucifer: Ritual Initiation. The customary method of entrance into the Sabbatic Tradition is via formal ritual induction. This can take various forms, ranging from the simplest act of ritual 'authorisation' to the so-called 'Grand Array' of the full Sabbatic ceremony. \\Vithin the CuIrus Sabbati there are various concurrent lineal streams, and it is from their example that I shall draw in the discussion below The founding lineage of the Cui tus is that of ' The Red Snake', descended from a Buckinghamshire stream of Cunning-craft practice and folk magic.

From the previous Magister of this lineage J was taught that a candidate is chosen by signs and omens, and that it was forbidden for any outsider to ask directly for initiation. The omen-chosen candidate is firstly 'watched' for a period of time, no less than nine lunar months.

His or her name is entered into the Book of Lineages1 and the names of fellow brethren are communicated. Within the ambit of the lineage in which the above process is actuated there are no grades or degrees beyond the principal initiation ritual, although it must be stated that some traditional lineages, such as The Black Boar and The Serpent-Cross, do utilise graded structures. In the case of the Black Boar lineage, for example, a Three Degree system is operated, broadly based upon the Apprentice. Journeyman, and Master grades of Freemasonry and medieval Craftsmans' Guilds. Tn this system the First Degree corresponds to the Dedication Rite: the Second Degree marks a mid-way stage - suitable if someone does not possess the requisite ability to receive the fun empowerment: and the Third Degree corresponds to the final Rite of Initiation. Although it may be affirmed that in the Cultus Sabbati there are no additional grades of attainment that apply to all individuals, it must paradoxically be stated that a strict hierarchical division of roles is traditionally operated.

A broad experiential basis is commendable, but it is the unique transmission (see below) which validates the path of such a wayfaring Journeyman.

In such instances, the ritual authority to teach others and to incept a lineage for a specific corpus of knowledge is divinely sanctioned. Whilst any man or woman may claim to have received a 'vision', the motives of such claims are made apparent by certain external signs; as the Gospel teaches: 'one must test all things and hold fast to that which is good'.

The composer of a Mystery-rite is known as its Master or Mistress, and it is at their behest that the rite is performed or its textual form is transmitted to others. In and of themselves Mysteria of this kind are Grand Initiations serving to convey the lineages of certain spiritual entities or magical techniques."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"lOO OPUSCULA MAGlCA Within the higher body of our magical lore, known as 'The Gnosis of the Crooked Path'l , there are numerous examples of such advanced workings. For example, 'The Rite of the Turnskin'. This is an initiatory procedure intending the entrance of the aspirant into the circle of therionic atavisms: the Zodiak of Living Forms. By passing through its ordeals the Skin-leaper's Arte is impressed upon the flesh: the bestial ancestry of an individual is 'raised', made self-conscious in his sentient physicality; the animal-headed god is realised' Another notable example is 'The Devil's Masquerade': the initiation rite of Draku-Ezhu, the 'Grand Famulus' of the Crooked Path Teachings. This particular Mystery-rite obtains the meeting, soul to souL between the Aspirant and the Deity. In the stream of Sabbatic Wisdom descended from Yelda Paterson through Zos vel Thanatos (Austin Osman Spare), there is a line of transmission facilitated by the 'passing-on' of a spirit-familiar. In its contemporary manifestation this arcanum has itself 'fleshed out' via the medium of a Mystery-rite. 'The Black Eagle Rite', simply named after the spirit itself. This instance in itself serves to illustrate that a certain type of magical lineage is principally conveyed via the inheritance of spirit-familiars. One might consider that the animal-totem, be it Eagle, Snake, Fox or Boar, functions as a 'mask' for the informing sentience of such traditions.

The absorption of thought word and deed in the all-consuming process of such rituals (many being of great duration and procedural complexity) facilitates the saturation of the mundane self with the magical ambience of a state or entity. Herein the impress of the Unseen Initiator upon the matrix of sentience or 'Mind' is most powerful and efficacious. In practice, Mystery-rites comport additional 'degrees', adjunctive zones of empowerment, to which an aspirant has access and in which he or she may gain authority. Self-initiation If by predilection one is led to the Craft and the only means of entrance there-to is by an initiation self-performed, then let that gate be freely and rightly chosen. If the individual is led there-to by dreams and portents, and is told how to perform such a rite then a Way of Unique Transmission is revealed. If a person accomplishes such a task then I do not consider anyone else -high or low -has the right to doubt that which essentially does not concern them. In fact, it is wiser for us to respect those who enter the Path by such means, for Witchblood's heart is reached by many veins. Distinction should be made between those with Vision and those without.

Fulfilling an outward process of ritual is not initiation: unless the interior link between Self and Other (whether that Other be Man, Deity, or Spirit) is attained then no initiation exists. If a prescribed formula is used and signs ensue, then a link is assured, but it is best if a rite of self-initiation is principally constructed according to divinely-received lore. Can a Self-initiate initiate others> If the basis of their Self-initiation is by a lineage of direct and unique revelation and if a corpus of teachings derives from such an epiphany, then we must be confident and affirm the ability of one to teach another, to pass on that which the Gods have revealed, if only to assist a student to gain self-initiation for themselves. If the Gods reveal themselves then it is with a courage that equals their blessing that we must claim our own spiritual authority and legitimisation. The truth of our vision is aptly tested by this need for bravery: to stand alone, a MasterIess One among Men, is a fate most rare.

The 'falsehoods' may in some instances be adumbrations of something more interior. but first such individuals must be made aware of the inner process whereby phantasy assumes the guise of historical reality A refinement of method is required in order for us to recognise the imaginal fore-shadowing of spiritual presence. As aforesaid, communicable inspiration is the simplest sign of veracity Where a genuine interior activity is augured and imaged-forth in phantastical invention, let us consider that the Divine Imagination contains its own denizens --the 'messengers' of godhood, and that the shadows thereof may impress themselves in 'types' conducive to the perceiver's apprehension. The open mind may thus behold the whispering daimon as an ancestor -an elderly forbear, or as a stranger, a 'black man' bearing a curious gift of book beast, or secret salve. The Sabbat is an astral conclave, a state of gnosis in ecstasy, its impress upon Mind is beyond all simple reckoning. If we can guide well in instances where its activity is fore~shadowed in the play of imagination, an individual may gain insight and succeed in establishing an interior link with the current, above and beyond the mere outward show of an apparent 'history'. Imaginal Transmission may therefore serve as a means of attaining a lineage of direct revelation. For the sake of caution, it is perhaps wise for us to speak plainly where genuine inspiration is absent and tall stories abound, we must beware. Whilst counselling a degree of closer analysis. I consider that those who make a deliberate pretence of initiatic provenance in any way or form are a danger to themselves, to naive seekers, and, in the broader sense, to the historical comprehension of the Craft as a whole.

Initiation is always a matter of relation, whether between Master and Apprentice or between an Individual and the Deities and Powers of the Mysteries. This being so. a ritual performed by oneself is in truth never really so. for the gods and powers that one calls upon are, in union, the Other to our self: the Gods are the 'body of the Initiator'. There is always a relation between ourselves and that which masks the Mysteries. And yet we may say that we are alone in the flesh and in this sense call the processes of self-induction the' Rites of One' or Solitary Initiations. Aside from solitary rites which manifest by way of Unique Transmission, there are certain Craft rites which have strict prescribed formulae and which must, of necessity, be performed alone. The Toadsman's Rite called 'The Waters of the Moon' is a well-known example. This requires a man to find himself a toad, to impale it upon a blackthorn and thereafter to let its body be tlensed by ants. Then, taking its bones to a stream on a clear full moon night, the would-be toadsman should cast the bones into the water. All the world will howl and clamour, a-seeking to distract the attention from the one bone that will move against the current; this is the Charming Bone. said to have power over animals. Thereafter the man should take this bone and keep it upon his person. The next three nights he should sojourn alone in a graveyard, seeking for the power of magic. On the third night it is said that the 'Devil' will come and try to tempt the bone away from its possessor. If the Devil succeeds, the rite has failed. If you can keep the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN CHAIN AND THE LONELY ROAD lOS bone no matter what rc,vard is offered, you are then an initiate of the Toadsman Rite'. As can be seen. this is not a simple procedure and will inevitably place its operant in a position requiring independence and courage. Using the same principle is a solitary Mystery-rite of the Crooked Path called 'The 'Wreath of Seven Laughing Skulls'. This requires the practitioner to deliberately seek out lonely and frightening places, and there to call forth the 'demons' which produce the sensations of terror and danger. These demons are then ritually confronted, the task of the practice being to transform the apparent 'poisons' or mis-aligned sentiences into 'nectars' or benefic states of potent magical gnosis: to realise the Union of Purity and Perfidy Oneiric Initiation and Transmission: The Silver Thread and Road of Green A principal way in which knowledge is transmitted within the Cultus is via dreams. Many of our rites are derived through the medium of lucid or clear-eyed dreaming; their messages being 'fleshed out' using the bases of traditional ritual structures, but enhanced and developed as the dream so dictates. It is indeed considered a talent and a blessing from the Gods if someone has the power to dream viridically -that is to dream true, with a mind made green, 'fertile as Old Eden'. As in the matter of Unique Transmission, if someone receives a dream of initiation into the Sabbatic Mysteries, then that dream is considered to impart its own lineal ~ Sec Pennick. ~ .

It does not comport the same empowerment as that of formal ritual induction, but then neither does a formal rite carry the same power as a dream wherein one meets with the Gods face-to-face. Often these matters overlap and provide insights into the other. However it must be stated that dream-initiation is considered to be a valid mode of induction and as aforesaid constitutes its own path of empowerment. Where dream-teachings are ongoing, there the pilgrim may be said to 'walk the Green Road'6 --the way of Elphame. It is considered a sign of magical veracity if one's magical name was dreamed, by oneself or one's teacher. Furthermore, an oneiric origin for a Mystery-rite is held in great esteem and is considered a guarantor of its spiritual provenance as a boon from the Faithful Gods, the Witch-Fathers and Wise-blooded Mothers. Entheogenic Initiation: The Witches' Supper. Another form of initiation is that which is bestowed through the sacramental use of entheogenic or psychotropic agents. Within Traditional Craft observance this is a method of psychic transformation used principally by experienced adepts as part of their on-going solitary initiation into the Mysteries. Here it must be stated that the use of such substances is the responsibility of the individual and that such practices must be undertaken with due respect and caution. Furthermore, the use of such substances is confined to reverential and sacramental consumption. 6 The reader is invited to compare the l'wa)'si ()rder of the Sufi Tradition. whose lineage of'The Mastericss (lnes' is perpetuated via onciro initiation, Sec 'A Shower uf Stars' by Peter Lamborn \\\\,ilsull. 1,),)6,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"?f.$~~.

Amongst the most frequently Llsed plant-familiars are those inhabiting Belladonna berries, Hemp, Syrian Rue, Black He11ebore, as well as the entheogenic forms of mycotrope such as Liberty Cap and Fly Agaric, collectively known as 'Crow's bread'. Also known is the Unguentum Sabbati or Devil's Salve. This is an ointment used by some practitioners to 'leave the flesh behind' and travel in the Wild Hunt. In communal rites wine and bread are commonly used as the 'Sacrament of the First Murder'. These are consumed as the flesh and blood of Abel, the body of profanity which must be resurrected or re-integrated into the body of Cain or the Initiatic self. The incorporation of more potent elements into the Witches' Supper depends wholly upon the rite and its assembly In solitary rites, it is known that in some forms of Old Craft an entheogenic elixir has sometimes been used to assist in the creation of the initiatory apotheosis: 'The aspirant, after being mentally prepared by his or her sponsor, and drinking of the potion, is left alone to spend the night by three stones that stand overgrown in the centre of the wood' (Taliesin, 'A Wood in the West Country', published in Pentagram, August 1965). This is somewhat reminiscent of the medieval Alpine initiatory potion which provoked its drinker to have 'all of a sudden the sensation of receiving and preserving within himself the image of our art, and the principal rituals of the sect' (Ginzburg. c., Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches'Sabbath, I 989).

This is of great use where a specific body of knowledge has become fragmentary and must be restored using magical techniques. Sexual Means of Lineal Succession: The Agapae of the Wise. In some traditions of the Old Craft it is said that initiation into the 'familial group' or Clan was firstly by sexual intercourse between the aspirant and the senior most initiate of the opposite gender. We may conjecture as to the veracity of this. It may have been used to 'bind' an individual into the kinship group, to make them of the One Blood7. Needless to say, we must exhibit great caution in matters so easily abused. Regardless of historical provenance, if sexual union is employed as a general means for induction after the formal year and a day tuition, then absolute trust must be a prerequisite and all parties must see through their commitment, without question or faltering. However, to my mind. initiation via sexual action is generally best confined to higher rites as operated between individuals of suitable adeptship. To write from experience. I was taught that a Magister can pass on his power via sexual means only once in his life. This might be to his chosen successor. if female. or to his own Consort in the Craft. We must also consider that sexual initiation can occur in the dream-state and that the 'consent' of the aspirant -; Credit to ivlargaret :-\"1atthe\\vs for this insight into tile' Famih of Rose blood'"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"110 OrUSCULA MAGICA may be an irrelevant consideration. It is rather a case of personal sacrifice to the deity. From my knowledge of both male and female adepts in the Elder Craft. the gods can and will take lovers and by their 'elixirs' convey strange knowledges, far beyond the grasp of mortal aspirations. Furthermore, we should also give thought to the transmission of gnosis between adepts via their own sexual fluids. A fully empowered consort is a vehicle for the magical current, his or her blood and bodily fluids are media for the powers of the Arte and its patron deities. In rites performed by higher adepts of the Sabbatic Mysteries the Witches' Supper is literally of 'flesh and blood' -of semen and vaginal elixirs. For it is known that the seasons of the Moon are refracted through the vessel of the Priestess and that the issue of her sexual mouth contains the secrets (secretions) of the gnosis in a fluidic hypostasis8 Likewise the seed of a Priest is the numinous medium for the powers of the Godhead and for the concealed radiances of the Sun. In rites employing a Seeress as the so-called 'Ophidian Oracle', a trance-state is actuated by cunnilingus and the lucid post-orgasmic dream of the priestess is guided by external manuductive passes and verbal conjurations. As can be seen, if one considers it deeply, such matters cannot be operated effectively between inexperienced aspirants. As such I conclude that it is best for such matters to remain the preserve of those capable of deploying their arcana with knowledge and love. Sec Azoeria (Chumbley. A.D.

In such an instance, the pages of a rite are formally given by a Master or Mistress to an aspirant and the spiritual wardens of the Book are bestowed as familiars or guides to the Book's new owner. In cases where face-to-face tuition cannot be accomplished, a one-to-one mode of textual transmission is sometimes utilised, most often accompanied by a psychic linking between Bestower and Recipient. The Lineage of the Serpent-Cross is one such example of a Sabbatic lineage externally supported by textual transmissions and internally augmented via psychic connectivity. In its case, the original motivation of the lineage is oneirically derived and its method of implementation is in accord with dream-tuition.

Conclusion: Initiation is a Bridge with One End Whilst it is evident that there is a broad range in the typology of Sabbatic initiations as operative in the contemporary observance of the Cunning-craft, such differentiation does not adhere to artificial borders; type is not strictly separated from type. In the reality of practice, one form overlaps with another and numerous combinations arise according to circumstantial requirements.

Now first of all I will speak about early modern Cunning-folk and then move on to modern Traditional Craft, if time permits. So you can sec where 1 am heading, it would serve to establish a basic definition of what 1 mean by 'modern Traditional Craft'. By this 1 refer to a cluster of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spell-craft, and devotional mysticism which trace their origins from early modern cunning-craft, but which, unlike the earlier forms of cunning folk, do not operate as a profession. It is also of note that, whilst sharing a common basis in ritual magic and Masonic influence, Traditional Craft does not share initiatory genealogy, nor partake in the neopagan religious dogma of Wicca. So, I will not be talking about modern 'pagan witchcraft'. By 'early modern Cunning folk' I refer specifically to 15th-18th century professional magical specialists· that is to literate cunning men and wise women -who used formal ritual magic, grimoire-texts and Christian charms, and whose primary social function was the performance of magical services within a community in exchange for money or goods --services such as finding lost property, thief detection, fortune-telling, love-spells, healing and in particular unbewitching of people and livestock. that is, acting against the purported malevolence of witches. Though cunning-folk existed throughout Europe and in the Americas, I intend to speak primarily about those in Britain. Even so, there arc regional distinctions and I must ask you to forgive any generalisations made in a context that demands brevity"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"INITlATION AND ACCESS TO MAGICAL POWER 117 By British cunning-craft I refer to a wide range of differing magical specialists, some of whom operated professionally, some of whom did not, some of whom used texts, some of whom used spells and charms held in memory alone. This range includes: healers, charmers, herb-workers, white witches, pellars, ghost-layers, bone-setters, toad-doctors, the Welsh Dyn Hysbys and Gwyddoniad, the Curren of the East Anglian marshes, Toad-witches, Bonesmen, and to some extent initiated Millers and Horsemen of the rural Lost Word fraternities. This understanding of 'cunning folk' is somewhat broader and more flexible than those offered by modern scholars such as Dr Owen Davies and Professor Ronald Hutton, but it is one which 1 personally find more tenable, inclusive and sensitive to the understanding of the subject from the perspective of someone - like myself -who works both as an Historian of Religions and as a practitioner within a magical context directly descended from early modern cunning craft. Now to say a little about access to magical power. For early modern cunning folk magical power was held because one had knowledge and skill; literally one had cunning or 'Art'. Virtue being another name. Thus a working knowledge of how to read Latin and English, write charms, construct magical seals, read astrology, as well as a keen skill in reading people would have placed a person in good stead as a cunning-man or woman.

Most grimoire texts, like The Sworn Book cifHonorius, The Clavicle cifSolomon, Agrippa's Books cif Occult philosophy existed until around I650 as rare printings or as manuscript copies. In I665, Reginald Scot's Discoverie cifWitchcrafi -a thorough condemnation of witchcraft beliefs and magical practices --ironically became one of the main sourcebooks for cunning-folk to learn and employ the techniques of ritual magic and gain an understanding of widespread witchcraft beliefs. Unlike in Europe where many thousands of grimoire chapbooks circulated in the r8th and I9th centuries, Britain's major magical texts were actually fortune-telling chapbooks and dream interpretation manuals. Nonetheless some British cunning-folk made it their prerogative to collect and accumulate substantial libraries of rare occult books.

In Europe these existed in the hundreds from at least the 16th century and in Britain from a later date. Few exist today, some remain in museums, and a few are retained in private hands. They would rarely have names, though in Europe they went by the generic name of Black Book. This said, The Devil's Plantation is one notable example from 19th C. Essex. Nigel Pennick also cites a variety he calls The Secret Granary, each one having its own distinct content or grains. In the Cultus Sabbati, we have a similar notion, with a black book having its own arrangement of charms. In terms of the transmission of magical power from person to person, the inheritance of books and written lore was one particular way that concrete magical practices were conveyed. The charms used by the so-called Physicians of Myddfai provide one of the best examples of an accumulating body of textual lore passed down in a family for several generations - -from the 13th century to the 18th. In the instance of the famous Essex Cunning-man James Murrell his magical texts were passed to him from his teacher Neoboad. Interestingly, one of Murrell's books, with text in both his own hand and that of Neoboad was in recent years still known to exist in private hands. The lady who owns the book was one of the informants of Eric Maple, in his Dark World if Witches. I have myself a collection of Latin charms which were passed down from mother to daughter within a Welsh family from the late 19th century eventually becoming part of the lore passed on ritually in one of the root-lineages of Cet!tus Sabbati.

Lloyd's books came from the faeries and were returned to them upon his death. This could be simply called a story, but from the perspective of a magician it means that the books remain available to one who might gain the favour of the Good Folk. This is a kind of textual transmission outside of literal history and partakes more of magical history Aside from books, magical power could also be obtained by a would-be magician through solitary rituals. These are a personal favourite of mine and provide means whereby anyone interested in traditional folk magic can find a means of access to witching power...if the omens and spirits permit that is.

To feed the Body of Christ to the Devil is not simply to profane the Host. it is to appropriate its power to harness the Devil. This being noted, it is important to state that ostensibly cunning-folk were generally good Christians with exemplary devotion. They used the Bible, particularly the Rook of Psalms, as a source of ritual texts and charms. The Bible was more than just a book, it was a sacred object that told the truth, and so could be used for various kinds of bibliomancy. This said. the pagan is tic elements of fairy beliefs and local legends which prevail in Cornish Pcllar practices, East Anglian Sigaldry and Curren practices, Welsh Craft, and Scottish cunning-craft cannot be ignored. For example. in Bottrell's Hearthside Stories cifWest Cornwall we find the tale of a wise-woman, locally reputed as a witch. but whose power of Sight resided in an ointment or eye salve. which when smeared on the eyelids allowed one to see the faeries and to walk in both human and faery realms. Another example of magical power from the faeries can be found in tales where a mortal man marries a faerie-woman. One such tale is the well-known legend of the Physicians of Myddfai, set in the 12th century but not recorded textually until 1841 where a man falls in love and marries a faerie from the lake of Mydffai, llyn-y-van-vach. The lady from the lake teaches the fellow, whose name was Rhiwallon, the lore of plants and medicine, and sets in motion a hereditary tradition of magic and medicine which existed, as far as the texts reveal, until the 18th -19th century. [n addition to the presence of bery lore in cunning-craft. we should also be mindful of the presence of classical deities from both literary sources and astrological lore"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"122 QpUSCULA MAGICA would again have provided a pagan component in cunning craft practices, albeit at a symbolic and not religious level. Now ... let us turn to the transmission of magical power from person to person. One particular route of transmission is familial. In terms of hereditary transmission of power amongst early modern cunning-folk. most scholars I have spoken with contend that at most this only ever lasts three generations. The instance of the Physicians of Myddfai, who maintained a magico-medical tradition from the 13th to the 18th century are a strong example against this. Continuation can'be supported within a family by praxis or strong interest in the Arte, and supported from outside by dint of reputation. There remain families in several parts of Wales to this day that retain the fame of being charmers 'who know the language of the birds'. In these particular instances 'initiation' was unlikely to have been used as a term, instead a would-be magician would think in terms of 'gaining the power' and this be accomplished most probably via a simple act of transmission or more commonly by a solitary ritual. Initiation as a formal concept was more evident in contexts where specialist magical and professional knowledge could be shared in secret societies. Initiation was here conceived in the Freemasonic manner as 'being made' and thus existed primarily within the allied lodges of the Bonesmen, the Miller's Word and Horseman's Word societies. It is to be noted that the structures of the initiations in these societies was based to a great extcnt on the combined degrees of Freemasonry, with signs, grips, passwords and ordeals.

Following the template of the increasingly widespread Masonic lodges, there arose in the 17th and 18th centuries a wide variety of Friendly Societies, like the Oddfellows, the Order of Woodsmen, The Shepherds, the Foresters, and so forth. In the marginal region of North-east Scotland, where Masonry was originally termed 'The Mason's Word', there was formed a trade-exclusive society calling itself 'The Miller's Word'. Unlike the Freemasons, the Miller's Word held its rituals at night and incorporated a range of intentionally diabolic elements into its initiation ritual. A candidate for the Miller's Word would be invited to the Mill at night, and would bring a bottle of whisky, a loaf of bread and a pot of jam for a mock communion. The ceremony would involve the candidate being blindfolded, challenged by a series of questions by a minister, the swearing of an Oath to absolute secrecy, the secret word was then whispered in the candidate's ear and he was raised from a kneeling position by a grip of the Old Chie!'s hand: a stick covered in phosphorus and animal skin. The blindfold removed, he was then met by a masked figure arrayed as the very Devil himself The night would then progress in feasting and drinking, interspersed with the tuition of magical recipes and expert professional knowledge. The very image of a secret society meeting at night, presided over by the Devil, indulging in excessive drinking, and with much talk of magical spells for controlling animals and women smacks rather strongly of the supposed Witches' Sabbath. The diabolic and willfully blasphemous features of the Miller's Word may simply have been in rebellion against the strict moralism of the Presbyterian Church, but the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"124 OPUSCULA MAGICA context of the society amongst rural workers permitted a range of oral customs and folk beliefs to enter the society Thus it is also to be considered that the diabolism may have modelled on the image of the Witches' Sabbath and thus various terms of 'sabbatic' nature became part and parcel of a rural quasi-Masonry In the 18th century, as the primary beast of burden in Scotland ceased to be the ox and the horse took precedent, the diabolic features of the Miller's Word carried over into the Horseman's Word, which in turn became a larger and more inclusive society. In the nineteenth century as Scottish farmworkers moved to East Anglia and other regions of England. the Horseman's Word travelled with them. Lodges of the Horseman's \\Vord thus perpetuated a certain mock-diabolism as a form of private religious ceremony amongst farm-workers of the nineteenth century. Amongst the recipes and spells found in the Miller and Horseman's Word is the famous solitary ritual of the Toad-bone, providing an interesting cross-over between the isolated figures of cunning folk and lodge-based fraternities. In a work entitled An Exposition cifthe Miller and Horseman's Word, or The True System cifRaising the Devil, as well as in the widely published chapbooks of horsemen, we find various spells and details of initiatory rituals. One thing to consider is that cunning-folk and secret societies may here have had plenty of opportunity to overlap. Furthermore, in the 19th century we also see the rise of urban schools of magic, as well as numerous hermetic societies practicing higher ritual magic in a form of rarefied freemasonry with elaborate mystery rites and degrees of initiation. We also have the advent of spiritualism where circles of people gathered to raise the spirits of the dead"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"INITIATION AND ACCESS TO MAGICAL POWER 125 and commune with them via mediumistic techniques and divination. Given these permutations, it is unsurprising that there should emerge, here and there around Britain, social meetings of people with cunning-craft backgrounds, experience of ritual magic. spell-craft. mediumism, Freemasonic-style initiations. and the Witches' Sabbath-influenced diabolism of the Horseman's Word. Indeed, it is likely that in contexts of Hermetic societies, Masonry, or rural secret societies that the otherwise solitary practi tioners of cunning-craft (especially those who possessed a strong literary interest in ritual magic) may have met group-minded ritual magicians. If this hypothesis is situated in the period 1880-1900, it is exactly the time-frame to which most of the forms of modern Traditional Craft trace their sense of lineage and existence as formalised ritual groups with initiations, hierarchies and... in some cases, explicitly Cainite, Luciferian or what I have termed 'Sabbatic' elements. Now let me explain a little about what I mean by 'modern Traditional Craft'. By this term I refer collectively to magical specialists who continued throughout the 19th, 20th and now 21st centuries to work with the spells, customs, texts, and ritual magic of the early modern cunning folk. but with some important differences. The primary difference is that Traditional Craft in the modern period operates less and less as a profession and more and more as a closed initiatory group of traditions. This is not to say that money is never exchanged for magical services in modern Traditional Craft, in some respects this aspect does continue but very few people actually cam a living from spell-craft and wortcunning. This is to say however that in modern Traditional Craft the knowledge of the Arte"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"126 OPUSCULA MAG1CA Magical is never taught or passed on for financial gain; it is passed on via means of formal ritual initiations and instruction. Thus one of the other characteristics of modern Traditional Craft is that it operates as a self-conscious tradi tion. with a strong sense of i ts o,vn magical genealogies and initiatory lineages. Another distinction is that whilst Traditional Craft maintains its foundation in solitary magical practice, it also incorporates a degree of lodge-based or covine-type rituals. Traditional Craft is not a religion, it generally defines itself as an Arte -the Arte MagicaL it is primarily a solitary-based context of practice, but also employs group workings --the covine being the best-known exemplar -for collective spell-craft and spirit-conjuration. By 'Initiation' I refer to a range of formal practices which lead an individual to change their status from being an outsider to being an insider with privileged knowledge and privileged relations with fellow initiates and in particular privileged access to magical power. Initiation can take many forms: it can be a formal ritual induction whereby one is tested, accepted and led within a secret society --lodge, covine, clan or convocation. This may include various sub-divisions of initiatory transformations of status, that is, means of giving privilege to the candidate such that they change from being an outsider to an insider. These sub-divisions include: passing-on of specialist knowledge (secret words. signs, hand-gestures, recipes and magical spells, passwords, and fellow initiates' names). the passing on of text --a magical book or corpus of rituals; sexual induction whereby ritualised intercourse marries a person into the familial Clan; the ritualised consumption of a sacramental substance --a potion or plant-substance."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"INITIATION AND ACCESS TO MAGICAL POWER 127 Each of these can be treated individuaJly as a means of initiation - a formal way of becoming an accepted brother or sister within a secret society or magical fraternity I wi1l return to these sub-divisions in due course. At its most elaborate, Initiation can be in the form of an elaborate Mystery-rite or sacred drama, the enaction of which leads the candidate through a mythic pilgrimage of ordeals and encounters, and ultimately leads the candidate to a special relationship with the Divine. This new relationship, the bodily, mental and spiritual entrance of a person within a Mystery, constitutes the essence, the very thing,of'initiation'. But initiation can also be undertaken alone. It can be via the performance of a solitary ritual ordeal such as the famous 'Waters of the Moon' or Toad-bone rituaL or via the fulfilment of a test such as an all-night vigil. All of these comprise the arena of 'initiation'. But we must be conscious that in using that word, we may be superimposing a construction of understanding upon actions which never identified themselves as such. In instances such as the Toad-bone ritual, the ritual is referred to by its practitioners as a means of 'obtaining power'. So we must be aware of our terms and where and when they belong. 'Power', its presence or absence. is the vital key to understanding what it is that differentiates an insider from an outsider, and in this subject, the old maxim rings true: Knowledge is Power."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"----.---------------~-----.. --.--~.--------~-----------~ @:&JYZ'CV~'E-r !f-~ £' : ---------.--------~-.7 *' ~ ~'v;g t ~G;1 ~~. 7L~~n_~ _____ ~ •• ~m_nn~_~ .. ~ ____ • __ ~ ~m ___ ... -4 31 t@ ~ T Ef 4: J .~-J,<-~ If ; ~~-d ~ '2 .1;-~-~-~-~-~ N;f,/p ~ ~~~~~t fr~~ ~~~-----------I EJ ~./ )t fa ~ ~: ~I k u\"-I it .QS v ~ '-;?' y ;u jtJ\\~ · r-~--~_-~_~~-~-~_m tff 0: .. =v1~ 1A&~~vt~· j--)f-k. -4l ~--~-~-~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~; ~~ v¥ ~ ~ r~~)L~'t./~ ~~~ ______ . _______ .. _______ . _ -=--\"::c;-=-------c~_c== _________ ...... __ _"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW D.

This is to say that 'magick' is the all-potential power of change characterising the root-nature of all that has existence. Secondly. I would suggest a distinction between 'magick' as 'power' and 'sorcery' as the means of manipulating that power through knowledge: 'Sorcery is the knowledge of the universal points of transmutation. Its Art is to cultivate the ability to manipulate these foci of power in accordance with Will, Desire and Bdief' In practical terms, I consider Sorcery to be the knowledge of the fundamental principles or 'sacred letters' which govern the control. manipulation and application of magical force. These principles are the Sorcerer's Alphabet. When focused via rituaL they determine the very arena of one's unique self-existence. The Principles of the Magical ~intessence are used to coor-dinate force and form, to inform strategies of sorcerous behav-iour and to empower expressions of creative aesthesis. Ritual, the magical 'art' par excellence. reveals new understandings of sorcerous knowledge and by the path that connects moment to moment --realisation to realisation-it brings consciousness into Gnosis. Magick in this sense leads to the direct realisation of Truth. the mystical apotheosis of the Arte Magical. Yet in the most pragmatic sense. magick is the power to bless. curse. attract, repeL calL banish, heal. hurt, bind or liberate.

Finally, 1 would add this: Mag-ick brings one to meet Death before dying and thus bestows an eternally living Wisdom. The light Magia reveals Sophia most fair 'neath the mask of Thanatos most foul. Robert Fitzgerald: Define 'Crooked Path Sorcery'. Where did this term come from? AC: The term 'Crooked Path Sorcery' refers to a specific cor-pus of Teachings and Rituals transmitted from within an inner circle of the Cultus Sabbati. It is distinguished from other bod-ies of Sabbatic lore by its specialised mode of ritual praxis, its distinctly ophidian cosmogony and manifold pantheon, as well as by its particular ethos of sorcerous mentality. The major body of Crooked Path Teachings is contained in The Dracon-ian Grimoire and in this form will be published in due course of time. In a general sense, 'Crooked Path' or Via Tortuosa im-plies the deviating continuum of gnosis, the lightning-path that links one moment of insight to another: it signifies the ability to serve with both hands alike - to both hurt and heal, cure and curse; it denotes the razor-like wisdom that arises from and transcends the conjunction of contraries. More specifically, the Via Tortuosa relates to a cycle of Mystery-rites which may be regarded as initiations into the Way of the Dra-conist into the Path of the Great Dragon Azhdeha. In essence. the Crooked Path Teachings intend a direct means of autonomous initiation into the Knowledge of the Magical ~lintessence. MH: What exactly does the Cultus Sabbati represent in its outer and public form> AC: 'Cultus Sabbati' very literally ere-presents' the Sabbatic Craft Tradition; as a term in the outer it reorientates the ac-tualities and inner dimensions of the Tradition via public texts and images -books, articles. and artistic forms.

In one very significant respect, the magical projection of the Cultus has operated as a pharos for the Curren; that is, a beacon or point of orientation for several manifestations of Traditional Craft. Diverse streams of tradi-tional observance, which otherwise may have passed into spirit. have met, communicated and cross-fertilised, simply because the Cultus has been 'visible' in exoteric terms, whilst at the same time being recognisable in terms of esoteric knowledge. Magically composed works can convey many 'texts' at once; a singular word can open many unseen paths. \\Vhen eye meets eye in knowing it does not matter if a mask is worn. Personally I consider the merit of our 'outer' actions lies in the consolidation of the Tradition and the respectful commun-ion between kindred souls of the Arte Magical Indeed, it is important for one to recognise that magical books and images can if presented appropriately work to quicken the vital seeds of initiatic awakening in fellow practitioners, whether solitary or covine in orientation, often opening avenues of di-rect spirit-contact and self-initiation. I consider that magical books and artefacts operate as entities in their own right, that they are familiar spirits and daimons \\yho may sene, test, bring individuals together. birth new realisations, reyeal dreams, function as omens; they can open a path of aspiration or close it forever.

MH: What exactly is the 'Sabbatic Craft'> What arc the origins of this name> AC: At an outer level of definition, 'Sabbatic Craft' describes a corpus of magical practices which self-consciously utilise the imagery and mythos of the '\\\\,Titches' Sabbath' as a cipher of ritual, teaching and gnosis. This is not the same as saying that one practises the self-same rituals in the self-same manner as the purported early modern 'witches' or historically attested cunning folk, rather it points toward the fact that the very mythos which had been generated about both 'witches' and their 'ritual gatherings' has been appropriated and re-orien-tated by contemporary successors of cunning-craft observance, and then knowingly applied for their own purposes. The term describes the way in which elements of witch-lore, Sabbath mythology and imagery were being employed in the cunning-craft tradition into which I was originally inducted. From what I have learned of previous generations in this and kindred streams of Traditional Craft, the utilisation of Sabbath-im-agery had been in process for some time, but during the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century became fully self-conscious. \\Vhen mythic imagery and direct magical ex-periences of spirit-flight, faerie convocations. and such like conjoin, the language of Sabbatic symbology is actually a very natural vehicle to employ It is useful at this point to emphasise that 'Traditional Craft' as a whole embraces many diverse streams of initiation, rituaL custom and spirit-allegiance. r know of at least seven lineages in Britain and am quite sure there arc many others --each with its own character and spiritual individuality This being said 'Sabbatic Craft', as a unifying term denoting a 'tradition', relates solely to the specific lineages convergent and operative"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW D.

AC: At an inner level of understanding one can speak of'Sab-batic Craft' in more subtle ways. The mythic elements of the Witches' Sabbath can be treated as multivalent symbols, each capable of showing innumerable meanings, some historical-temporaL some pointing toward the atemporal actualities of the Sabbath as a field of transcendental magical existence. In Azoetia, I wrote that the true meeting-place of the Sabbath was at the crossroads of waking, sleeping and mundane dreaming, and that the Sabbatic Rites were to be experienced and par-ticipated in a dimension of True Dreaming, in which one goes forth in spirit-flight into the Field of the Sabbat and there communes directly in its mysteries. Whilst one can write about this, the reality is rooted in personal apprehension which can only be gained if the spirits accept you and elect to call you out in dreaming, or if one is fortunate enough to be taught in a Traditional Craft lineage that possesses the requisite lore and spirit-patronage In the final analysis, Sabbatic Craft is an ini-tiatory tradition and only those who have been so inducted -whether by man or spirit should speak about it, and eycn then guardedly. MH: Can you explain a little about the actual practice of dreaming on a magical level>"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"134 OPUSCULA MAGICA AC: [very word, deed and thought can empower. magnetise, and establish points of receptivity for a magical dream. likewise any of these means can do the opposite --fixating perception in a manner that is not receptive that seals the soul in the body instead of enabling it to go forth at will. Explanations of dreaming practices when given in a ritual context serve their own purpose --they reify the knowledge of the dream and em-power the dreams of knowledge. Dreaming. like possession. trance and mediumism of various kinds. establishes direct communication with spirits and gods. and thus provides the vital means for the constant informing of one's magical work. The Sabbatic Craft employs the Arcana of Dream as a vehicle for the reification of spirit-knowledge the materialisation of the spirit and the spiritualisation of the material. If any aspire to this kind of spirit-relation and wish to gain knowledge of dreaming, let them go out walking by day --away from the company of men. out into the fields of their locality Conscious of their step upon the land. let them ask for a sign or token. If the spirits of the place find you acceptable. an object or omen may be revealed. For example. you might see a white stag. a black dog. a magpie, or find a hagstone. a gnarled root. a fallen antler or a snake-slough. Fixate your perception at every opportunity on this object and ask the spirits to open the way for you. When falling into sleep, hold the object in attention and again entreat the spirits.

In this matter, even the secret's telling holds its shadow beyond sight."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"136 QpVSCVLA MAGICA MH: Do you see that there is any form of historical continuity between the so-called 'witches' of the past and Traditional Craft as it is practised today> AC: Yes, I do, and in a number of different ways. Primarily I consider there to be continuities of basic ritual method, of spirit-community, and of oneiric locus. In terms of 'method', the practices of Traditional Craft change and modify from one generation to the next, some things possessing greater continuity than others, but nonethe-less certain spirit-borne threads continue to maintain the es-sential web. Speaking in a general sense, practices employing Words of Power, dual observance, Latin charms, Biblical verses for prayer, healing and divination, toad-bone magic, knotted cords, witch-bottles, are all attested by folklorists as having been lised by the so-called 'witches', charmers, and cunning-folk of the past: and so --because of their oral continuity and implementation-they remain a part of some forms of Tradi-tional Craft as practised today. Speaking from a personal perspective, I consider it vital to realise, particularly in terms of ritual knowledge, that the ex-perience of evoking the shades of one's lineal and local magical ancestors provides a very real sense of living continuity. It be-stows the sense of belonging to a magical community in which both living and dead participate. This empowers the perpetu-ation of remembrance and maintains a direct understanding of one's personal and communal spiritual heredity This is not just about the present linking to the past, but is about the dead and the living engaging in the present as one. Using academic analysis as an adjunct to initiatic understand-ing can provide other perspectives about continuity. Judging from the historical works of Henningsen, Ginzburg, Behringer, Pocs, ct alia it is evident that motifs and elements of the Witches' Sabbath relate directly to early modern folk beliefs, magical pr;L\"Xis, and attested interactions with dream conclaves"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW D.

One might ask 'whether certain types of praxis yield comparable spirit-com-munion and thus, despite shifts in values, theology. names, and representatiollS, the experiential actualities of magical practice, spirit-congress and oneiric locus maintain a certain constancy of reality. To comprehend the forms of inner continuity one must not however equate dntiquity with authenticity; the source of the Sabbatic Craft is of the Moment, beyond past and future. The linear perspective of'time' assumed by historical analysis must be recognised as having limited value when considering and representing the manifestations of a-temporal contexts of ex-penence. RF: Have you any plans for new books> AC: In many ways I think new books, or rather their spirits, have plans for mel I have never sought to write books 'about' magic. but rather to write magical books -to reify texts and images which are the vessels for spirits, powers and specialised kinds of knowledge. Such books are genuine Grammars of the Arte and arc possessed of a life beyond the apparent manifes-tations of author, reader, page and ink. To answer your question specifically, there are a number of works in process. There is. of course, the new edition of Azoetia. This is scheduled for pub-lication during the latter part of 2002. Azoetia forms the first volume of The Trimagisterion, a three volume set of grimoire texts: the second and third of which arc The Draconian Grimoire and The Auraeon.

These are small grimoire-texts of which one copy only is made. Each is hand-written and illustrated, and accompanied by specific ritual items. These are then either sold, gifted or passed on according to their ritual orientation, thereby being sent forth as emissaries, messengers to carry specific elements of The Trimagisterion. 'Plans' for magical books are vortices of obsessional will that revolve around the gestating 'seeds' of gnosis. According to one's application to the work, visionary impetus is reified and the 'book' takes form. Every 'plan' is thus rooted in a sudden eruption of creativity an epiphany of spirit-knowledge that originally takes one by surprise, forcing a deviation of intent and necessitating an attentive response to the new-turning path. If the source of one's vision is found, one should rejoice - for the sole object worthy of true devotion's love is revealed. RF: Books emerging from the Cultus are all published by Xoanon. Could you give a brief description ofXoanon's birth and development.

It was chosen as the name for the Cultus Sabbati's publishing hOllse because it de-picts the process of reification of spirit into matter, the trans-lation of unseen 'texts' to visible books. I think the name was chosen in a lightning-flash of inspiration and I don't recall any alternative names being considered. Xoanon was founded in 1992 for the express purpose of pub-lishing Azoetia and future Cultus works, both internal and ex-ternal texts. In 1995, Xoanon was greatly assisted by Fulgur,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW D.

In 200I, the vear in which we issued Ars phi/tron, Xoanon was es-tablished as a limited company under both myself and Daniel Schulke, the author of that work. This marked a further con-solidation of Xoanon as a magical vehicle for reification, aug-menting the freedom to move its foclls of will betwixt the \\vorlds of men and spirits. The publication of Ars Philtron marked an extremely impor-tant shift; it began to move the focus away from myself as the sole 'authority' in the Cultus as it is outwardly perceived. I hope that in forthcoming years, as we publish more dnd more works by other Sabbatic initiates, our readership will begin to comprehend that the Cultus has several visionary perspectives and that each has an importance in its own right as well as in the context of the tradition as a whole.

As regards the rituals of solitary initiation, I am aware of seven major forms of induction. the most well-known of which is probably the Toad-bone ritual. \\Vhilst I recognise that anyone who follows the procedure of any of these rites is technically able to receive the full 'power' of witchblood thereby and without human mediation, I must stress that just performing the ritual is insufficient; the authority gained via the process must have the assent and acceptance of a rite's pa-tron spirits. Certain of these rites are unknowingly shared by differing lineages of Old Craft, often being used as an adjunct to teacher-pupil induction. It is my intention to deal with the full heptad of the Lonely Road in The Auraeon. MH: \\Vhat are your views on the subject of blood sacrifice in our modern age> AC: Firstly one would have to ask 'whose' modern age arc we speaking of> Such questions presuppose a relation of all moral issues to what could be generally termed a contemporary western cultural and ethical environment. The ethics of an issue depend upon who, where and when it is contextualised. If one is actually asking about the issue of blood sacrifice in present-day Britain, that is a very different issue from asking about such practices in contemporary NepaL Haiti, or West Africa. In Haitian Voudon, to take one example, the usc of blood sacrifice is vital to the maintenance of harmonious relations between the living community and the spirit-\\vorld of loa and ancestors. To fail to give sacrifice is to starve one's own ancestors, to betray the relations with one's own spiritual forbears. To compare this to someone performing the sacrifice of a dove in a rite to gain the patronage of a goetic demon would result in very superficial resemblance --the cultural contexts of Afro-American religiosity are orientated toward"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"142 OPUSCULA MAGICA communal harmony between this world and the othenvorld: the goetic theurgist is seeking an individualistic coercion of power to personal ends. Esoterically speaking hO\\vever, there may be specific principles operative in both contexts and in such an initiatic context, I must state that as a sorcerer I can have no personal moral objection to blood sacrifice in the appropriate ritual contexts. As far as those magical or religious contexts vvhich require sacrifice for spiritual and communal harmony, I see no difference what 'age' it supposedly is or isn't: the ancestors remain. I appreciate that the 'whole issue is morally sensitive, but basically I think that to partake of food and drink with the Gods and Ancestors is a noble and honourable matter -whether it be meat and beer, or bread and fruit. My thoughts on this issue are such that whatever you are prepared to eat yourself you should be prepared to eat with the ancestors. If you break bread, share wine, take life and share meat, assume personal responsibility for your deeds. However. in terms of Tradi tional Craft in Britain I have no knowledge of blood sacrifice bei ng used, other than the blood of the ritualists themselves-menstrual or otherwise.

In terms of general interpretation, these are positionsof authority held by specific individuals, based upon the posses-sion of specialised knowledge, skills, experience, and the com-mand of respect. However. these offices may also be interpreted as the stations of the soul in its initiatic pilgrimage and thus rclate to each and every initiate. You ask what it means to use the term 'Magister'.

If one may seek amongst these strands -amidst the many other kinds of shared features, one may speak about a body of lore that exists in the Old Craft which incorporates a gnostic fai th in the Divine Serpent of Light, in the Host of the-Gregori, in the Children of Earth sired by the Watchers. in the lineage of descent via Lilith, MahazaeL Cain, Tubal-cain.

Like Cain, Lilith is a com-plex figure. in which many arcana reside simultaneously. She is the ancestress. the first woman to embody the sorcerous will, the light of the star-illumined moon refracted into the blood of the kreis. As the 'mother' of the initiate, Lilith embodies the process of initiation --the entrance to the path and the recon-figuration of the prentice into a form befitting 'birth' into the Circle. The continuity of initiation for all True Seekers makes the womb of Liliya our constant abode; in that sense we are forever coming forth from her womb: the spirit-lineage marks the river of her blood as it courses our Eden. Speaking from my knowledge of the Ophite-Sabbatic lore within the Cultus, its historical provenance is primarily rooted in oral transmission. Nonetheless, beyond the passing of word from mouth to ear. there are many diverse linkages which pre-figure the complex form seen in the present-day mythos. In previous generations Traditional Craft has shared certain fea-tures with the Societies of Horsemanry; reverence for Cain is one such element. In turn, comparable ideas about the role of Tubal-Cain and Naamah can be seen in the allied rites of Freemasonry. Traditional Craft has also made good use of many ritual magic texts such as The Key of Solomon and Agrippa's Books of Occult philosophy. These works also provide avenues for allied figures, such as Lucifer, Asmodeus, Lilith, and the Arch-daemonic Guardians of the Magical Circle led by Mahazae1. Although the emphasis of sacrality is reversed. another strand of genealogy is obviously to Biblical texts vvhere various ele-ments of the mythos are present. Biblical sources likewise con-nect to the Apocrypha. Pseudepigrapha, Jewish folklore and even Manichaean texts as avenues of influence. However, whilst one could 'explain' the presence of Cain and Lilith with recourse to such sources. contesting some kind of dependence of Sabbatic lore upon Christian.

CHUMBLEY I45 the Craft mythos in itself The Teachings of Traditional Craft utilise a cipher of lucifer ian antinomianism which renders Cain and Lilith, our blessed primogenitors, as the Bearers of Light from the Ancient Serpent. The overcoming of Adam by Lilith and the murder of Abel by Cain signify the transformation of the uninitiated condition or 'Clay' into the 'Fire' of Magical Knowledge. This is however the merest inkling of the breadth and depth of these matters. As a parting tale, it is worth speaking about another fascinat-ing path of influence into Traditional Craft, namely that of Gypsy beliefs. Indeed, 1 recall once being told the Tale of the Uncooling Nail by a Romany fellow:--On the night before Christ's crucifixion, soldiers were sent out to have four long nails forged for the deed. They approached Jewish, Greek, and Roman smiths, but each refused once they had heard the nails were for Jesus of Nazareth's crucifixion. Outside the city gates the soldiers found a Romany smith. He didn't ask the need for the long nails so late at night; he just needed the money. The smith obliged and began making the nails, one by one. How-ever, whilst heating the fourth nail in the fire, he asked who they were for. On learning they were for Christ's crucifixion, the gypsy ceased his work abruptly and fled. However, the fiery nail that had been in the forge never cooled down; it remained a glowing spike of blood-red flame. And, so it is said, the Un-cooling 'Now!' will follow the descendants of the Romany smith wherever they go. It is held that the Romany smith was himself a descendant of Tubal-cain, the first metal-worker, and he had in turn learned his Art from Cain.

A Short Critique and Comment Upon Magic SKOOB Occult Review, Autumn, 1990 As Andrew's first published article, 'Critique' was modest in both word length and editorial placement, though substantive in insight and magical conviction. The cardinal themes of solitude as a tutelary genius, and visionary art as a vessel of gnosis would recur throughout all of Andrew's work. The essay contains a section relating to 'The Map of Possibility' from Azoetia and what would later be known as 'The Vision of the Map' in the second (Sethos) edition of that same work (2002). The Heart of the Sorcerer Chaos International No. II, 1991 'Heart' is remarkable for its early clarity of magical vision, as well as Andrew's role as the originator of the named magical concept 'Sabbatic Witchcraft'.
