In the Northern Jurisdictionthe latter is declared “to have assumed a position in relation to the otherOrders of Masonry, that entitles it to a place in a Masonic work.” The fol-lowing account is given of its progress and present condition:“It was introduced into the United States, November ,,by J.E.Marco-nis de Negre, Grand Hierophant. He conferred it upon a number of MasonicBrethren, and established a Supreme Council,th Degree with John Mitchellat its head. Shortly after, a Sovereign Grand Council th Degree, was institut-ed in New York, with David McLellan as Grand Master. But the system, for somereason, did not flourish in this country.“In ,Harry J.Seymour,of New York, who had been one of the earliestsupporters of the system, visited Europe, and was advanced to the th andhighest degree, and invested with authority to establish on the Continent ofAmerica a Sovereign Grand Sanctuary of Conservators-General of the Order.This is the highest authority known to the Rite Under it a Sovereign CouncilGeneral has been established for New England which is flourishing. Other Stateand combined State organization are under rapid headway, the whole embrac-ing many hundred working members.”Harr y J. Seymour th, is the Sov∴Gr∴Master of “The Sov∴Sanctuary ofAncient and Primitive Free-Masonry according to the Rite of Memphis, in andfor the Continent of America;” and Robert D. Holmes,th, is the GeneralGrand Expert. Both these Brethren are Members of “The Supreme Council forthe Northern Jurisdiction of the United States, at New York,”-which claims to bethe regular Council for that Jurisdiction. If these Brethren have not sworn neverto receiveor recognizeany higher degree in Masonry than the d, they are notds. If they haveso sworn, they have violated their obligations, because they doacknowledge and havereceived degrees pretendingto be higher,since they pre-tendto give the d as one of their degrees, the th, perhaps.I had occasion, recently, to heal a Brother (°ofthe Ancient and AcceptedRite), resident in Nevada, who exhibited to me his Patent of the th Degree,signed by Bros∴Seymour and Edmund P. Hays, Sov∴Gr∴Commander of thepresent New York Supreme Council,among other persons.

But this is false, in the sense inwhich it is intended to be taken; and in selling degrees and titles by means of it,the vendors are obtaining money under false pretenses.On the th of April,,Grand Master Marshal Magnan addressed a cir-cular to the dissenting Lodges and Masons of ’ France, inviting them to returnto their allegiance. Marconis seized the opportunity to apply for the affiliationof his Rite with the Grand Orient. His request was granted, and two new Lodgeswere soon after constituted. Yet, although the Grand College of Rites thusadmitted the Rite of Memphis, this admission was accompanied with suchrestrictions that the Rite,in fact,exists no longer. Deprived of its constitution,its government, its Councils, its entire organization, and its degrees,permit-ted only to work in the three Symbolic Degrees, subject to the prescriptions ofthe Grand Orient as regards the obtaining of the higher degrees, the Rite ofMemphis is actually transformed into the Scottish Rite.A member of a Lodge retaining the denomination of the Rite of Memphis, isnot permitted to add the number of his high degree of that Rite to his name, norto wear any jewel or decoration belonging to it. As to its work in the BlueDegrees, it in no respect materially differs from the old printed Rituals of theScottish Rite, of which, as well as the Rite Moderne, any one can buy as many ashe pleases in Paris.Of course, the successors of those who invented the Rites of Mizraim andMemphis have the right to work them. But all Masons ought to be informed thatthey are mere shams, used only for the purpose of making money, by those whovend the degrees; communicating no useful information; as worthless as thetinsel and spangles of the Circus; and most of the degrees being absolutelynothing but idle words and signs.

E . M a r c o nis, the author,who styles himself the founder ofthe Rite in question, thus briefly gives anaccount of its origin.“The Rite of Memphis, or Oriental Rite, was introduced into Europe by,Ormus, a seraphic priest of Alexandria, and Egyptian Sage, who had been con-verted by St. Mark, and reformed the doctrines of the Egyptians in accordancewith the principles of Christianity.”“The disciples of Ormus continued, until ,to be the sole guardians ofancient Egyptian wisdom as purified by Christianity, and Solomonian science.This science they communicated to the Templars. They were then known by thetitle ofKnights of Palestine or Brethren Rose-Croix of the East.In them,the Riteof Memphis recognizes its immediate founders.”In defining the object and intention of his Order, Marconis speaks as follows:“The Masonic Rite of ’ Memphis is a combination of the ancient mysteries; ittaught the first men to render homage to the Deity. Its dogmas are based on theprinciples of humanity its mission is the study of that wisdom which serves todiscern truth; it is the beneficent dawn ofthe development of reason and intel-ligence; it is the worship of the qualities of the human heart, and the repressionof its vices; in fine, it is the echo of religious toleration, the union of all belief,the bond between all men, the symbol of the sweet illusions of hope, preachingthe faith in God that saves, and the charity that blesses.”Thus it will be seen that this Rite, which purports to be it continuation of theAncient Mysteries, and pretends to contain a vast amount of instruction, doesbut announce the aim and mission of modern Free-Masonry. And yet itsfounder is the first to disobey the precepts which it enjoins; for one of the prin-cipal duties of these adept’s is to be always scrupulously truthful; while his workis but a mass of misrepresentations and fictions, invented by him for the purposeVo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of imposing upon the credulity of others. The introduction to his book abovequoted affords one proof; the continuation of his recital will furnish others:“The Rite of Memphis is the sole depository of high Masonry, the true prim-itive Rite, the Rite par excellence, which has come down to us without any alter-ation, and is consequently the only Rite which can justify its origin and thecombined exercise ofits rights by constitutions, the authenticity of which can-not be questioned. The Rite of Memphis, or Oriental Rite, is the veritableMasonic tree, and all systems, whatsoever they be, are but detached branches ofthis institution, venerable for its great antiquity, and born in Egypt. The realdeposit of the principles of Masonry written in the Chaldee language is pre-served in the sacred Ark of the Rite of Memphis, and in part in the Grand Lodgeof Scotland, at Edinburgh, and in the Maronite Convent on Mount Lebanon.”To t h i s e x t r a c t we subjoin the first article of the organic Statutes of the Order,from which the rest may be readily imagined:“Bro∴Marconis de Negre, the Grand Hierophant, is the sole consecrateddepository of the traditions of this Sublime Order.”After this it would certainly be superfluous to ask, what are the Constitutionsor what are those precious documents in the Chaldee language that are “preservedin the sacred Ark of the Rite of Memphis?” The fact is, that they never existed,except in the fertile imagination of the inventor of the Rite. It is but the same oldstory, the same language, the same tactics which Masonic charlatans have for acentury and a half made use of, in order to make partisans and victims.As regards the introduction of the Rite in France, Marconis de Negre informsus, that a certain Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, brought it from Egypt, in (how or from whom he received it, we are not informed), and in company withGabriel Mathieu Marconis (father of Marconis de Negre), Baron Dumas, andthe Marquis de la Rogne, founded a Lodge of this Rite at Montauban, on theth of April,;that this Lodge was closed oil the th of March,(why, weare not told); and that in consequence the archives were confided to the care ofthe father of Marconis, who was appointed (by whom it is not stated) GrandHierophant of the Order.The falsity of these assertions is easily demonstrated. Jacques Etienne Mar-conis was initiated into the Rite of Mizraim, at Paris,st of April,,beingthen twenty-seven years of age. On the same day he received the first thirteendegrees of the Rite, for this Egyptian ladder was not very difficult to ascend. Onthe th of June of the same year, certain charges were preferred against him byseveral of the Brethren, in consequence of which he was excluded from the Rite.Shortly afterwards left Paris and went to Lyons, where, under the name ofNegre,he founded a Lodge ofthe Rite of Mizraim, with the title of “la Bienveillance,” ofwhich he assumed the Mastership. As Master of that Lodge,lie was elevated toHeredomAlbert Pike & William L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the th Degree, by the supreme Authority of that Rite, that is to say, by theBros∴Bedarride, who little imagined that the Bro∴Negre and the Bro∴J. E.Marconis, whom they had previously expelled, were one and the same person.It was not long , however, before new charges were preferred against him, bythe Brethren of Lyons, and on the th day of May,,he was once moreexpelled from the Order. Af te r t h e s e t wo e x pulsions, Marconis, satisfied that hecould no longer play a part in the Rite of Mizraim but feeling that he was bornfor great things, did what many others had done before him—he createdaMasonic power!Appropriating the Mizraimite ladder, manufactured by Lechangeur, andadding a few rounds, he soon constructed his Rite of Memphis, arid the workbeing finished, he constituted himself its “head and front.”To f u r n i s h a n o rigin and a history to this work was no very difficult task; andin accomplishing it we must acknowledge that he showed much more respect forthe common sense of the Masons than did Michel Bedarride who, in his historyof the “Order of Mizraim,” was not satisfied, like Lechangeur, to attribute its ori-gin to the Egyptian king of that name, but went so far as to ascribe it to the DeityHimself. Marconis only dates his Rite from the commencement of our era, hop-ing, probably, that this modesty on his part might induce Masons to accept itwithout distrust, and to put faith in those precious documents written in theChaldee language, which, he informed them, were to be found in the sacred Arkof the Rite of Memphis. Marconis was, in reality, possessed of considerably moreerudition than the manufacturers of the Rite of Mizraim; and in constructing hisown system, ingeniously varied and transposed the degrees of the former, alter-ing the titles, passwords, signs, etc.; thus in a manner disguising their real ori-gin. Many of his degrees, however, were never completed,and remain to this daydegrees merely in name, having no Ritual, or at best,mere skeletons, to be,filledup at the pleasure of any speculator who chooses to purchase them. The extrav-agant character of the Rite need hardly be alluded to; the published Constitu-tions, Diplomas, Edicts, etc., furnish abundant evidence of the fact. This heapingup of such a mass of mystic rubbish, merely for the purpose of constituting andgoverning an association of men, the mission of which is “the development ofreason and intelligence, and the study of wisdom,” is simply ridiculous.In ,after having compiled the Rituals of his Rite, Marconis visited Bel-gium as Grand Hierophant and successor of his father, and opened negotiationsfor the establishment of his Order in that country. Meeting with little encour-agement he returned to Paris, where, under the name ofMarconis Letuillart,hesucceeded in gathering together a few isolated Brethren, and instituted a Lodge,“The Disciples ofMemphis.” On the d of March,,he constituted a GrandLodge under the title of “Osiris,” which was intended to govern and superintendVo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the Subordinate Lodges he expected to create. On the st of May,,he insti-tuted a Chapter “les Philadelphes,” and on the th of February,,a Lodge“les Sages d’Heliopolis.”On the th of April,,he published the Statutes of the Order, and finallysucceeded in establishing two Lodges of his Rite at Brussels. But about this timehe met with a serious and unexpected repulse. When he had constituted his firstLodge at Paris, the leaders of the Rite of Mizraim, taking umbrage it this inva-sion of their Jurisdiction, at once wrote to the Prefect of Police, informing himof the expulsion of Marconis, and praying that he might be debarred from con-stituting and holding Lodges. Not obtaining as speedy relief as they expected,they issued a circular addressed to all their Lodges, Chapters, etc., warning themagainst the machinations of Marconis, and setting forth their reasons for hisexpulsion. The police finally interfered, and on the th of May,,all theLodges of the Rite of Memphis were closed. From that date, until  finding“his occupation gone,” he turned his attention to Masonic literature and pub-lished in succession several works, the “Sanctuary of Memphis,” the “Hiero-phant,” the “Mystic Sun,” the “Mystic Temple,” “the Masonic Pantheon,” etc.In –,taking advantage of the political events of the period, Marconissucceeded in reestablishing three Lodges at Paris: the “Disciples of Menes,” the“Disciples of Pythagoras,” and the “Disciples of Memphis.” The Belgian andother Lodges he had previously founded, however, “slept the sleep that knowsno waking.”During the time that Marconis de Negre managed to keep his Lodges alive,he followed the example of the Bros∴Bedarride, by seeking to procure adher-ents among the members of the Grand Orient and Supreme Council, conferringupon them gratisthe highest degrees of his Rite.In Marconis went to England, and after several attempts succeeded inestablishing a Grand Lodge,“Disciples of Menes,” which was intended to be therepresentative Supreme Council of the Order for Great Britain and Ireland. J. P.Berjean was constituted Grand Master, and Representative of the GrandHierophant.The feeling which arose in against Masonry in general, in France obligedMarconis to close his Lodges, and in December,,they for the second timeyielded to a feeling of somnolency, and “ lay down to pleasant dreams.” The gov-ernment of the Rite was then transferred to the Grand Lodge he had establishedat London, and on the th of November,Berjean was solemnly installed as“Grand Master of Light” ofthe New Mystic Temple, and of the General GrandCouncil of the Order, being at the same time appointed “Agent of the Hiero-phant.” The Order at that time consisted in London of but some thirty mem-bers, chiefly political refugees, among whom were Louis Blanc and a few otherHeredomAlbert Pike & William L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"men of note. These, however, soon retired and their places were taken by a classof men who, in the course of a few years, became so turbulent and unruly thatthe Grand Master Berjean was obliged to dissolve the Lodge, and Marconishimself thought it prudent to declare that lie had washed hands of the wholeaffair, and disowned all responsibility relative to the proceedings of the Lodge.Still fondly hoping for the realization of his pet scheme, Marconis, in ,endeavored through Bro∴Rebold, the well known Masonic author, to negotiatewith the Grand Orient for the affiliation with that authority of the MemphisianLodges. The demand was rejected, and Marconis then again devoted his atten-tion to Masonic publications.In lie came to New York with an assortment of diplomas, charters, jew-els, etc., for the purpose ofpropagating his Rite. He had some time before hisarrival constituted, by Deputy, two Chapters and a Council of his Rite at NewYo r k . O n e o f t h e s e Bodies was composed of “American citizens of Africandescent.” At Troy, N.Y., he instituted a so-called Grand Lodge, “Disciples ofMemphis,” of which a Bro∴Durand was Grand Master. After a brief sojourn inthis country, Marconis and his Prime Minister disappeared somewhat sudden-ly, and were next beard ofas having returned to Paris. The seed sown by themhas indeed sprouted in various places, and still retains a sort of spasmodic exis-tence, but its growth is composed of such heterogeneous and antagonistic ele-ments, that it will, in all probability, soon die a natural death.In London, some of the fragments ofthe former Grand Lodge afterwardsendeavored to revive their organization, and finally succeeded in re-constitutingthemselves.This Body is still in existence, but has no Masonic status whatever,the Grand Lodge of England regarding them as clandestine Masons, and for-bidding its subordinates from holding Masonic communication with them.—————Bulletin du Grand Orient de France Supréme Conseil pour la France et lespossessions FrançaisesMars 1865, pp. 4, 5.THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER, TO THE PRESIDENTSOF LODGES:S∴S∴S∴Ve ry D e a r B r e t h r e n:Article of the Constitution declares that Masonicinitiation has several degrees, which are passed through and conferred accord-ing to the forms indicated by the Rituals, and of which the highest is the d ofthe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.—(Art.of the Constitution.)Vo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The names specially belonging to these degrees, and the insignia appropri-ated to them, and which tradition,the Rituals of the degrees, or theStatutes-General of the Order have sanctioned, are the only ones recognized bythe Grand Orient, and the only ones allowed; all other titles or decorations areinterdicted by Articles ,,and of the Statutes-General.The use of Masonic decorations, indicating degrees above the d Degree, is,then, not only a violation of the law, but the negation of the principles embod-ied in Articles and of the Constitution, which places all Masons and allRites under the level of equality among themselves.We l e a r n , i n t h e m e a n w h i le, that in contempt of these wise principles, anddespite the general prescriptions ofthe law, Masons present themselves in theLodge, and at different Masonic reunions, decorated with jewels and cordonsnot authorized, and which have no claim to be authorized:That some Lodges, under the form of Masonic rewards, distribute jewels thatbear the greatest possible resemblance to the decorations of the Civil Order;and that, while the wearing of the apron, the symbol of labour, is more and moredisused, insignia not recognized by the laws of Masonry are every day more andmore multiplied:That Brethren, Masons originally of the Rite of Memphis, whom the GrandOrient has admitted into its bosom, without, however, recognizing or authoriz-ing the great number of degrees of that Rite, forget the conditions of that admis-sion, and wear on their cordons the ostensible sign of their former degrees,or,in signing their names, ostentatiously affix the high number of degrees they hadacquired:The decision of the Council of the Order, published in the, Official Bulletinof November,,pages et seq., is thus disregarded; for, by the terms of thatdecision, the titles of the Brethren of that Rite having, been visédand regular-ized, either to the degree of Master or to that of Rose Croix, no one among theseBrethren can claim to possess any other degree than that indicated in this visa;and for them as for all, the provisions of Articles and of theStatutes-General are obligatory.It is our dut y, ver y dear Brethren, to put an end to these different abuses; wepoint them out to al Masons, and particularly to the vigilant attention of thePresidents of workshops.Inasmuch as the Statutes-General of the Order define still more particularly,if that is possible, the insignia of every degree, and proscribe whatever incon-gruous or shocking there is in Masonic decorations, restoring everywhere unityand simplicity, we appeal to the firmness and good taste of all our Brethren; butit belongs, above all, to the Venerables to cause, the law to be respected; it is forthem a right and a duty to refuse to admit into their Temples every Mason of theHeredomAlbert Pike & William L.

This statement has never been more fully exem-plified than in connection with legitimate Speculative Freemasonry,which from its very inception after the Revival ofin London, hasbeen beset with imitators ranging all the way from good-naturedmockery to vicious schemes to dupe the innocent and unwary. The excellentreputation of freemasonry and the quite universal knowledge of its high aimsand ideals removes the “sales resistance” which frauds and charlatans wouldencounter in imitating and promoting a less known fraternal organization.Freemasonr y’s own concerns are, unfortunately, an aid to those who would fur-ther their own evil ends by duping innocent and well-intentioned individualsby plausible claims of an easy method of admission to an exclusive fraternity. Itis only when the zeal of such unscrupulous promoters overcomes their discre-tion that they are halted. Sooner or later some of them run afoul of local ordi-nances, state statutes and occasionally of federal postal regulations, and there isan exposure which becomes general knowledge. The Darius Wilson frauds inMassachusetts in ,and the McBlain Thompson Masonic Fraud Case, triedin Federal Court at Salt Lake City, Utah, in ¹are striking examples.These very cases furnish evidence on the spurious rites to be discussed inthis article. Although the Memphis and Misraim rites have been practically dor-mant for long period,there are several parties who claim more or less doubtfulauthority over them, and it is not at all improbable that attempts may again bemade to propagate them in the United States. For this reason we present to theAmerican Masonic Craft, through the columns of the Masonic press, positiveevidence of the history of these rites and their illegal and illegitimate nature.In every case the activities of these rites are tainted in their diffusion becausethey have been promoted, mainly, either by those who had no legitimate or rec-Vo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ognized Masonic status whatever or who have been expelled or excluded fromthe Craft of Freemasonry because of unworthy acts.Shortly after the so-called Revival in ,Freemasonry was introduced fromEngland into France where it became extremely popular. Not satisfied to prac-tice Masonry in the original form in which it had been transmitted to them,numerous ritual writers proceeded to devise additional “degrees” of their own,and by there were several hundred such degrees in existence.²Such of theseas possessed any real merit were cumulated into specific Rites, the most notableof which was the “Rite of Perfection” which was introduced into the WesternHemisphere by Stephen Morin in .This Rite,originally consisting of twen-ty-five degrees, was afterwards expanded to thirty-three degrees and now con-stitutes the well-known and entirely legitimate Ancient and Accepted ScottishRite of Freemasonry. This Rite is controlled by regularly organized SupremeCouncils, the oldest of which is that for the Southern Jurisdiction of the UnitedStates of America, organized at Charleston, South Carolina, in ,to which alllegitimate bodies of this Rite can mediately or immediately trace their origin.While in English-speaking countries,with one or two minor exceptions, thefirst three degrees of this Rite are never practiced, the remaining degrees beingconferred only upon those who have received the symbolic degrees in bodiesregularly chartered by Grand Lodges, in some countries, notably the Latin-American ones, it is almost the only Masonic system known.Origin of the Rites of Memphis and MisraimThis article treats of the history of these organizations rather than of their ritu-alistic and allegorical philosophies. For that reason there is no necessity of dis-cussing the alleged origins of the bodies as set forth in their rituals and lectures.An oriental antiquity is claimed for them which is purely fabulous, and it isamusing to see the variations presented by the self-constituted heads of thesebodies when knaves fell out among themselves and drew upon fertile imagina-tions for fanciful origins.The Rite of Misraim (or Mizraim) is the older of the two, but it takes sec-ondary place in the treatment ofthem as it became merged with the Rite ofMemphis. The two rites are so similar that their names have become synony-mous for each other, although the term “Rite of Memphis” is the one best rep-resenting the two rites when considered independently. The Rite of Memphiswas propagated in the United States, Italy, France, Rumania, Great Britain,Egypt, Germany, and even South America. In all these countries, with the pos-sible exception of Egypt, where it was more or less active up to a comparativelyrecent date, it is now nothing more than a name.HeredomAlbert Pike & William L.

DeGrasse-Tilly, in ,gave the degrees ofthe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Riteto the principal members ofthe Grand Orient of France; and after the fall of theEmpire a Supreme Council in the bosom of the Grand Orient was organized,which still exists⁵though now inactive. Legitimate Scottish Rite Masonry inFrance is now under control of the Supreme Council °, which is independentof the Grand Orient.It has been claimed that the Rite of Misraim owed its principles and form oforganization to the Primitive Rite of Philadelphes of Narbonne, which wasestablished in ,and in united with the Grand Orient of France. Of this,however, there is no positive proof. From certain startling similarities betweenthis Rite and the Rite de la Sagesse Egyptienne,concerning which ver y little hasever been published, the originators of the Rite of Misraim may have had aknowledge ofand drawn upon the latter for their material. At any rate, they didnot hesitate to draw freely upon other rites, and at least five of their degrees were“lifts” from the Ancient and Accepted Rite.⁶The Rite of Misraim originally hadeighty-seven degrees, but was soon expanded to ninety.Some writers contend that the creation of the Rite of Misraim was the workof the Bedarride brothers, but this is not the case. The chief originator, or morecorrectly compiler, of the Rite was one Lechangeur, who had been refusedadmission into the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and who organized theRite of Misraim in opposition to the former.⁷It was, however,the three Bedar-ride brothers, Joseph, Michel, and Marc, the last named of whom perpetuatedtheir memory by publishing a history of the rite in Paris, in ,entitled DeL’ O r d r e d e M i s r a i m,a two volume work of some pages, who introduced andpropagated the Rite in France, about –.There it partook of the dissensionand schisms which were so indissolubly part of the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury French Masonic activities. Thus precedents were established which theAmerican progenitors observed equally as meticulously in subsequent decades.The Grand Orient of France, which controlled a number of degrees otherthan the symbolic grades of Ancient Craft Masonry, refused recognition to thenew rite. The governing body dissolved, but some of the constituent lodges con-Vo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tinued their work. They were very naturally considered as clandestine bodiesand treated as such.The Rite of MemphisIn the absence of contemporary documents and published accounts, we mustrely upon other records for the origin of this rite. The earliest authentic account⁸attributes its beginning to one Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, Egypt, who, withGabriel Mathieu Marconis de Negre and others founded the first lodge,Les Dis-ciples de Memphis,at Montauban,France,in .Proponents of the Rite admitthat this lodge suspended labor the following year, and state that the archiveswere entrusted to Marconis de Negre, Grand Hierophant, who revived the Rite inin Brussels and Paris. The French body was styled the Grand Lodge Osiris.⁹The Rite of Memphis published its Statutes and Regulations on January ,,and Jacques-Etienne Marconis,Jr.,was named Grand Hierophant,depos-itory of traditions and general archives of the Order.¹⁰During and several other Lodges were established,among them being the Chapitral LodgePhiladelphisat Paris; the lodges BienveillanceandSages d’Heliopolisin the Ori-ent of Belgium and the LodgeChevaliers de Palestine,at Marseilles.¹¹On February ,[]. the Prefect of Police in Paris requested the membersof the Masonic Order of Memphis to cease their labors, and on [May , ],the Grand Hierophant declared the Masonic Rite of Memphis at refreshment.They again resumed labor in Paris on March ,,several other lodges beingformed in that year, [] and [].¹²Although unrecognized by the GrandOrient which, as supreme authority of French Masonry, held their lodges clan-destine, the Rite enjoyed considerable prosperity and extended itself into vari-ous parts of Europe and South America. Masonic authorities put a stop to theRite’s emissaries in Berlin in ,¹³but there are evidences of activities in Ger-many in the present century. The trend of political events put the French lodges“to sleep” again on [December, ].¹⁴The Rite in the United States rests upon a foundation which was unsoundfrom the very inception. This fact, supported by a definite pronunciamentofrom the Grand Orient of France, reproduced herewith in full, must be empha-sized at this point, because the proponents of the Rite very conveniently over-look this important detail when presenting their versions. Its development inthis country, however, must be deferred for the moment, but will be treated fullyin subsequent paragraphs.Relinquishment of Marconis’s AuthorityPolitical developments and Masonic opposition in France caused the activitiesof the Rite to be transferred to London, where the Grand Lodge of EnglandHeredomAlbert Pike & William L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"took cognizance of it and condemned it in no uncertain terms, as we shall seelater. Marconis also visited America, and the Rite was established in New Yorkin .This,too,will be dealt with in detail.Masonic authority in France was vested in the Grand Orient of France.Unlike Amer ican Grand Lodges, with which we are more familiar, this bodycontrolled rites and grades other than the symbolic degrees, through a GrandCollege attached to it. This Grand College of Rites assumed authority over allMasonr y in France, at one time claiming to have the Scottish Rite under its con-trol, and influenced the Scottish Rite developments in England and Ireland tosuch an extent that serious situations arose between those bodies and the twoScottish Rite Supreme Councils in the United States.¹⁵Marconis, rightfully believing that his Rite would have a better status if oper-ated under the aegis of the Grand Orient, applied to it for recognition. At thesame time one of the French Lodges, calledSectateurs de Menesof the Rite ofMemphis demanded ofthe Grand Orient an authorization to work under its jur-isdiction. The Grand College of Rites was consulted and by a decree of Novem-ber ,,admitted the Rite of Memphisinto its bosom.It was required,inorder to accomplish this, that Marconis divest himself ofall authority he held upto that time and to deliver the entire Rite and its creations into the control of theGrand Orient. This he did, whereupon the symbolic lodges of the Rite in Francewere recognized and authorized to continue work in the three symbolic degrees;but the higher grades from the th to the th, inclusive, were shelved. At thattime the degrees ofMasonr y from the th to the rd, inclusive, were under thedirection of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, through its chamber in theGrand Orient ofFrance, and authority to work them could only be obtainedfrom that body. The degrees beyond the rd in the Rite of Memphis have neverbeen brought legitimately from the darkness into which they were cast by theGrand Orient, when it assumed control over that Rite. Even the symbolicLodges of the Rite of Memphis soon abandoned their rituals and adopted thesystem of the Modern French Rite, so that by the Rite of Memphis wententirely out of existence so far as any connection with legitimate Masonry isconcerned. While the Grand Orient did violate its policies in regard to someother Masonic rites worked in the United States and South America, it never didmodify its acts relative to the Rite of Memphis, and that Rite became as dead asthe proverbial door nail after Marconis relinquished his authority in .¹⁶Introduction into the United StatesThe controversial exponents of the Rite of Memphis are agreed upon its originsin the United States, no matter how much they differ in the later details.

At that time “sidedegrees” of all kinds were very common, and it was not at all unusual for promi-nent Masons to be recipients of such degrees. Seymour doubtless sought themembership of men of this type to give prestige to his Rite. Later on, when thelegitimacy ofthe rite came to be questioned, we find these same men renounc-ing their membership therein, as will be shown presently.The Grand Orient of France never recognized the patent issued to Seymourby Marconis in .The position of the Grand Orient is clearly defined in a let-ter written to the Supreme Council °, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, North-ern Masonic Jurisdiction, February ,.It reads thus:T∴T∴G∴O∴T∴G∴A∴O∴T∴UNIVERSEGrand Orient of FranceO∴of Paris, Feb.,(E∴V∴)Ve r y H o n o r able Brother:Bro.

It had, however, fallen into the hands of Masonic charlatans and impos-tors who used it with more or less success to further their own selfish ends.Author it y was claimed and assumed by various individuals without the slight-est semblance of legality.The growth of the Rite during the period from to can be attributedin a large degree to the difficulties which existed in the Northern Masonic Jur-isdiction of the Scottish Rite. Due to dissensions, there existed from to three bodies each claiming to be the legitimate Supreme Council for that Rite.Tw o o f t h e s e united in ,and a final “Reunion” of the two remaining SupremeCouncils occurred in ,since which time harmony has prevailed throughoutthe jurisdiction.After the final union of the two existing Supreme Councils in ,Harry J.Seymour altered the Rite of Memphis from a °system to one of°. Heclaimed that the Grand Orient of France had ordered this change, but this claimrests upon a most insecure foundation. The Grand Orient strenuously deniesthat they ever authorized the practice of any degrees of this rite, further than thethird, or that of Master. All authority over degrees above the third was vested inthe Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, and whatever action the Grand Orient tookwith the propagation of such degrees was in the name of that Rite and not theRite of Memphis, all of whose degrees were buried in the archives of the GrandOrient from the time that Marconis placed it under their aegis.That Seymour utilized the Rite of Memphis as a money-making scheme isshown by the fact that he gave these degrees in Washington, D.C. without chargeexcept that each who received them should take a diploma from him and payfive dollars for it.¹⁹Viewed from the American standpoint, Seymour’s change in the system wasobviously an attempt to create a rival body to the Scottish Rite Supreme Councilfrom which he had been expelled.

Burt, became dissatisfied with theirchief, and he (Burt) agreed to sell out to Darius Wilson for ,dollars.A small hole-and-corner meeting, the circular of Brother Lord [of whommore anon] informs us, was held by a few members who were favorable toDarius Wilson—about eight we believe—who were said to represent Chapters and ,members, which was probably a mathematical calcu-lation of what they might expect to get before the world came to an end.But a remainder of the prospective ten thousand members refused to agreeto Darius Wilson’s purchase of the Rite, and elected Judge Parrish as theirGrand Master. Thus there came into existence two spurious branches ofthe Rite; besides which Calvin C. Burt continued to confer degrees. Thisled to a judicial tribunal in which Wilson expelled Burt.... The GrandLodge of Massachusetts formally endorsed the assertion that Wilson isrunning the Rite to make money, and expelled him from the Craft.²⁴A Grand Mystic Temple had been chartered in Canada by Alexander B. Mott.The Canadian members declared themselves independent, organized a Sover-eign Sanctuary, and chartered a body of the Rite of Misraim in the UnitedStates, with W. B. Lord of Utica, New York as Grand Master. Mott claimed thatall rights to the Rite of Misraim in the United St ates b elonged to him by virtueof his office as Grand Master of the Rite of Memphis.²⁵This led to much con-troversy with both Lord and Mott strongly asserting their authority.Wilson went on conferring the degrees of the Rite of Memphis, and, in addi-tion, the three Craft degrees and, as a consequence, was expelled by the GrandLodge of New York in for illegally conferring these degrees under claimedauthority from the clandestine “Grand Lodge of Ohio” which had been organ-ized as a rival to the legitimate Grand Lodge of that state.²⁶About hemerged his branch of the Rite of Memphis with that of Isaac H. Parrish and W.B. Lord, under the name of the “Royal Masonic Rite.” This body never assumedany real importance and soon passed into oblivion.Dr. Alexander B. Mott, head of the Seymour branch of the Rite, died in .He was succeeded by Harvey G. Goodale.²⁷In September,,Goodale turnedover all the papers and control of the Rite to Ellis B. Guild, who kept controluntil just before he died on May ,.There are several claimants to Guild’sauthority, but so far as can be ascertained, this branch of the Rite is now entire-ly dormant, or we might say is “a Shadow body.”It is wor thy of note that practically all those who have been actively engagedin the promotion of the Rite of Memphis have been prominently identified withother spurious Masonic Bodies. Seymour was one of the prime movers in therevival of the clandestine Cerneau Scottish Rite. Burt and Wilson were con-nected with clandestine Craft lodges.

Any Mason underthe jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge who shall hereafter take or receive,confer or be present at, or assist in the conferring of any degree, grade ororder, in or under the authority of any organization or body claiming to beMasonic, or which uses or employs in its ceremonies, either directly orindirectly, or by reference to or otherwise, any part of the esoteric work,signs or symbols of the three degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry, and whichis not declared to be recognized as such Masonic organization or body bythis Grand Lodge, is guilty of a Masonic offence.The Section following the above lists the same bodies as previously referred toas duly recognized.One of the most sweeping edicts against the Rite of Memphis is that adopt-ed by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which is given in full below.HeredomAlbert Pike & William L.

Rabbs, John J. Gorman, and Willard C. Black, pre-sented a memorial asking that they receive recognition as rd Degree Masonsof the A.A.S.R., they having received the Thirty-Third Degree according to theRite of Memphis. This memorial was referred to a special committee, whichreported that “it is evident that these brethren have been victims of imposture,”and that “the prayer cannot be granted without an entire departure from theprinciples and safeguards of the Rite.... Their only remedy is to seek the gradewhich they suppose themselves to possess, through the proper and legitimatechannels.” Their names do not appear in the list of members of the SupremeCouncil, so the distinction they sought was not conferred upon them. John J.Gorman later became Sovereign Grand Commander of the so-called revivedCerneau Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite.³⁰Later Developments in the United StatesIn we find one Ellis B. Guild posing as Sovereign Grand Master of the Riteof Memphis for the United States of America. Guild died some ten years ago,and at present [] there are at least four claimants to the Supreme Authorityover the organization, some holding that they derive authority from Seymour,through direct descent, others that they derive authority from Burt throughWilson and Parrish, and still another claiming authority from Italy. In addition,at least one group claims a French origin of recent years—this, of course, couldnot possibly have any basis of fact, as seen in the early part of this treatment.HeredomAlbert Pike & William L. Cummings"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Between and ,Jacques Ochs,a Rumanian,claimed authority fromthe National Grand Lodge of Rumania to establish masonic lodges in theUnited St ates. His authority was revoked, and he then appeared as a Represen-tative of the Grand Orient of Spain for the Rite of “Memphis and Misraim,” andestablished lodges in New York which he told the initiates were regular mason-ic bodies in which they could get all the degrees at low rates. His operationsextended to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Chicago, Illinois, where he foundnumerous dupes at so much per capita. He was denounced by regular masonicauthorities, and soon found himself under arrest, after which the bodies he hadfounded soon ceased to exist., This was simply another case of a clever degree-peddler preying upon credulity and ignorance. The Ochs Rite of “Memphis andMisraim” was not the Marconis Rite, but evidently some invention of his own.There was also a short-lived Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis for the Cos-mos in Boston, Massachusetts, about ,and there are records of an Ancient andPrimitive (Spanish) Rite of Memphis and Misraim at New York, Philadelphia, andChicago about –,which had no connection with the Rite established hereby Marconis.³¹Evidence of continued activities of this old Boston rite, or arevival of one of Wilson’s various activities, was found in recent years. Theprime mover is a man who headed a clandestine Massachusetts symbolic lodge,as shown by court records in the archives of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.The testimony in the legal prosecution of the frauds is interesting reading.Matthew McBlain Thompson, of American Masonic Federation notoriety,also included the Rites ofMemphis and Misrain in his list of Orders or degrees,as is shown by his testimony in the trial at Salt Lake City, Utah, in ,when hewas convicted of fraudulent use ofthe mails of the United States,fined $,,and sentenced to serve two years in the Federal Penitentiary. His pretension toScottish recognition was exposed by testimony showing that the Grand Lodgeof Scotland does not recognize these Rites as belonging to Freemasonry.³²The Rite of Memphis in EnglandOn October ,,W.Grey Clarke, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge ofEngland, issued a circular (see The Freemason,September ,) directingMasters of Lodges to see that no member of the “Reformed Order of Memphis,or Rite of the Grand Lodge of Philadelphes” should be admitted to any Lodge,and asking them to remind the members of their lodges that they could hold nocommunication with irregular lodges without incurring the penalty of expul-sion from the Order, and the liability of being proceeded against under the Act,George III, for taking part in the meetings of illegal secret societies.In the same issue ofThe Freemason,there appeared a letter from Meyer andLowenstark, which stated that the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis, late-Vo l u m e , The Spurious Rites of Memphis and Misraim"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ly introduced into England by B. D. Hyam, Past Grand Master of Masons of Cal-ifornia, U.S.A., had no connection with the spurious body named.In The Freemasonof October ,,we find this note, “We are requested tostate that the Rite of Memphis is not and never has been recognized by theGrand Orient of France and Further, that it is viewed as an imposture by theheads of the Masonic Order in America, who have reportedly denounced thereputed ‘Sovereign of Memphis,’ Harr y J. Sey mour and his colleague, not onlyas spurious Masons, but of men unworthy of credit in every respect. We areinformed that the rite is impious and atheistical in its teachings and that activemeasures are on foot to expose the iniquity of its proceedings.”Again we find in The Freemasonof October ,,page ,an editorialstating that the Grand Orient of France desired to absorb the Rite of Memphisand so wipe out what it considered an anomaly and a disgrace to the Craft.According to Brother Dudley Wright, all doubt as to the illegality of theAntient and Primitive Rite had been settled on April and ,,when a con-cordat was arrived at between the Ancient and Accepted Rite for England,Wa l e s , a nd the Dominions and Dependencies of the British Crown, the GrandLodge of Mark Mater Masons of England, Wales, etc., and the Great Priory ofthe United Religious and Military Orders of the Temple of England and Wales,by which any member of these three bodies becoming or continuing a memberof the Antient and Primitive Rite was ipso facto excluded from any or all ofthese bodies.³³Despite this decree, a charter was granted, in ,for a Sovereign GrandBody for Great Britain and Ireland, which was formally inaugurated by Harry J.Seymour, Grand Master General of the United States. Most prominently identi-fied with the movement was John Yarker. He had previously been invested withthe degrees by Benjamin D. Hyam, under patent from Harry J. Seymour andwas installed as Grand Mater General of Great Britain and Ireland. Charterswere granted for Chapters in London, Manchester, Havant, and Dublin. Laterbodies were warranted for Burnley and Aberdeenshire.³⁴At this t ime the number of degrees of the Rite had been officially reduced bySeymour to thirty-three (from ninety-six), but according to a letter from JohnYarker permission was granted to the various bodies to work such other side-degrees as they might desire, if in accord with the old system.³⁵John Yarker was the prime moving spirit of the Rite in England. He was aMasonic student of some repute and a writer ofno mean ability. He seemed,however, to have a penchant for erratic quasi-Masonic organizations, includingthe Rite of Swedenborg, of which he was Supreme Grand Master for the UnitedKingdom, the Sat Bhai of Prague, and various other mystic and occult institu-tions.³⁶He also signed himself“F.S.Sc.

This “Society” for a considerable time was listed in thecautionary column of the London Tr u t h.After Sturman’s death,his wife,whowas really the active partner in the business, carried on with some success.³⁷In ,the Supreme Council ofthe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite ofEngland issued a Balustre giving notice of the expulsion of John Yarker,°, forun-Masonic conduct.³⁸The Rite of Memphis never gained any great foothold in England, althoughbodies were reported as working in Liverpool and the Isle of Man at compara-tively recent dates. The “revival” in Belgium, which recognized the Yarkercharters, is obviously irregular and has no standing. A periodical called TheKneph,devoted to the interests of the Rite, was edited first by Kenneth R. H.MacKenzie and afterward by John Yarker. This was succeeded by another peri-odical entitled The Zuzimuth,which was very short-lived.SummaryThe Rites of Misraim and Memphis have been a thorn in the side of legitimateFreemasonr y ever y since their inception.For the most part they have beenexploited by Masonic adventurers, many of whom had been expelled from free-masonry, for their own personal profit. Since it has been under the controlof the Grand Orient of France which has never authorized its working beyondthe first three degrees, and in these only to such lodges of the Rite as had previ-ously been established, all of which soon abandoned it.It appears that Marconis acted in bad faith with the Grand Orient, and that,after the Rite had been taken under its protection, claimed that his renunciationof his authority to the Grand Orient had been for France only, and proceededto issue alleged authority for its promulgation in other countries to Seymourand others.These rites never formed any part of legitimate Freemasonry. Its rituals are amass of anachronisms, distorted history, inaccurate science, and jumbled phi-losophy. Being issued in printed form, they are quite common and easy toaccess. To pay money to anyone for the conferring of these degrees is a case of a“fool and his money.” Whatever abstract interest they may have for the studentof ritual, they are of no practical utility and properly belong in a library ofmasonic curios.HeredomAlbert Pike & William L.

There is alsothe grade of Grand Hierophant °who presides as head of the Rite in theworld. The latter is selected by the presiding Grand Master Generals of the Sov-ereign Sanctuaries existing in the various countries where bodies of the Ritefunction. The last Grand Hierophant (prior to ) appears to have been JohnYarker of England, who died on March ,.On November ,,the Grand Hierophant, Jacques-Etienne Marconis deNegre,°, visited the United States and set up a Sovereign Sanctuary withDavid McLellan,°Grand Master General. The order did not prosper andHarr y J. Seymour,°, who visited France, was designated Grand Master Gen-eral of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the U.S.A. In ,Alexander B.Mott,°became head of the Sovereign Sanctuary.He was succeeded by Harvey Goodale°in and then Elis B. Guild,°in .The successions and splits in theOrder from to are too complicated to rehearse here. There were Sov-ereign Sanctuaries of the Rite in France, England, Germany, Canada, NewZealand and possibly Belgium and Italy, besides in the United States. All thesebodies outside ofthe United States are dormant.The Calvin C. Burt–Isaac H. Parrish and the Darius Wilson groups in theUnited St ates have long since become dormant. The Elis B. Guild group splitand there came into existence a group headed by Roland A. Case. This groupwould have expired but for the authority resting in Henry V. A. Parsell, who con-ferred the °on Harold V.B.Voorhis on November ,by letters patent.SEPTEMBER 29, 1948On the above date Henry V. A. Parsell,°, with Harold V. B. Voorhis,°, actingas Grand Conservator, opened a meeting of the Sovereign Sanctuary of theRoland A. Case group in New York City.
