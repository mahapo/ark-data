[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia Grade V – College of Adepts ­ Adeptus Minor2005The College of Adepts meets in chamber called the Vault of the Adepts. The three Grades of Adeptship are conferred by the Most Worthy Supreme Magus, or by a Chief Adept. The Ceremony of Reception into each grade of Adeptship is performed by three Officers; an Inductor, inthe East; an Expositor, in the West; and a Conductor beside the Portal. A Chief Adept of a Province may appoint any Frater to act as Inductor or Expositor for the purpose ofconferring a Second Order Grade, but the Frater so appointed must be of a higher Grade than that beingconferred. Small pedestals should be provided for the Inductor and Expositor: on these pedestals an illuminatedtransparency of a red cross should be placed, that of the Expositor being optional. Progress into and within the Second Order rests with the Chief Adept, who should receive therecommendation of the College through his Provincial Secretary. Colleges are not empowered in theirwarrants to confer Adept Grades. The Provincial Secretary is responsible for obtaining the approval of the Chief Adept for advancement toGrades V, VI and VII of all Fratres in the Province, and for arranging the ceremonies (which willnormally be held before the meeting of a College), and for summoning the Candidate to attend. Summonses should be sent to all eligible Fratres in the Province, but for convenience these summonsesmay, if time permits, be passed to College Secretaries to send out with the College summonses. TheProvincial Secretary, under the direction of the Chief Adept, arranges the Officers for the Adeptceremonies, and ensures that they are informed in advance. The Provincial Secretary is responsible for submitting the Return (Form A/C), which he must sign toconfirm that the Grade(s) have been conferred, to the Secretary­General, immediately after Adept Gradeshave been conferred, so that Certificates can be made out, for administrative convenience he may arrangewith the College Secretary to submit these returns with the College returns. The appropriate fee should besent by the College Secretary for the Second­Order Grades with the Form A/C, duly signed by theProvincial Secretary, for the Candidate’s Grade V. The Form A/C must show who officiated in each ceremony Minutes – Minutes should be kept of all AdeptGrades worked in the Province, and these should be read and confirmed immediately after opening on thenext occasion Adept Grades are worked in the Province, even though this may be at some other venue. Furniture ­ The Provincial Secretary, or, if one has been appointed, the Provincial D.C., should see thatthe following arrangements are complied with, as far as is practicable, for each Adept ceremony. Seats tobe arranged in the form of a seven­sided figure, in the centre the Pastos (failing which a black cloth foldedto shape and placed on the floor), on the Pastos, from West to East, the Holy Bible (open at St JohnChapter 1), small ‘in memoriam' plate, circular altarplate (Grade VII only), sanctuary lamp or candle.Pedestals for the Inductor in the East and Expositor in the West, each bearing a light enclosed by atransparency, so that the Illuminated Cross is seen by the Candidate, and the officer has the benefit of adim light. NOTE: ensure that the Fratres do not move the chairs from the sevensided shape, and that they"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"understand the significance of the form of the Vault. The Candidates should be veiled, and not blindfolded in the Adept Grades. Prologue – If the Prologue is to be given in Grade V, it is necessary that there is a banner, or diagram, ofthe Tree of Life outside the Portal of the Vault and that it can be illuminated during the explanation, theanteroom should otherwise be in darkness. Lighting ­ In Grade V, if it is the custom to show the Candidates a diagram of the Tetractys to enable themto follow the explanation in the Lecture, sufficient light should be given for them to see this diagram whilethis part of the lecture is given, or a transparency of a Tetractys may be used. With these exceptions (andthe lights in the transparencies on the two pedestals and the Sanctuary Lamp on the Pastos) there shouldbe no lights in evidence during the Adept ceremonies, but if available, a very dim blue light may be usedthroughout, to facilitate movements. Formalities ­ Before opening the Vault of Adepts the Inductor should satisfy himself by enquiry, thatnobody is present who has not taken the Grade about to be worked. He should then call upon theProvincial Secretary to read from Form A/C the names of the Candidates for the Grade, and to confirmthat the form bears the signature of the Chief Adept (or Supreme Magus) approving the Candidate. Note. When in College, Adepti Minores should wear the Jewel of the Rosicrucian Society suspended by ayellow ribbon upon which is the number V, and in addition may wear the Ancient Jewel of an Adept as described in the Lecture. Adeptus Minor In this Grade the Vault is prepared by placing upon the floor a pastos, with its head near the centre of theVault and its foot to the East. The Sacred Volume is placed on the pastos at the head, and a lighted lamp atthe foot: a memorial tablet maybe placed on the pastos, and if this is done it should be placed so that it canbe read from the East. The chairs should, as far as is practicable, be set out to form a seven­sided shape,with apex to the East. The Vault is but dimly lit, in the anteroom, by the entrance to the Temple, should bea banner or chart of the Kabalistic Tree of Life, with a light to illuminate it during the explanation (Thiswill apply only if the Prologue is to be given). The candidate must be a Philosophus, Grade IV and must wear the Jewel of the First Order of the Society.He must have been a member of the Society for not less than four years: if, exceptionally, it is desired topermit advancement at an earlier date, a Dispensation from the Supreme Magus must have been obtainedfrom the Secretary General before the ceremony can take place. Whenever possible, although this may be varied by permission of the S.M or a Chief Adept, there should benot more than two Candidates for Grade V. In the anteroom the Acolyte prepares the Candidate and instructs him how to knock for admission. (Oneand Four). Opening Ind.: Right (or Very) Worthy Conductor, please confirm that all within the Vault are of Grade V or higher. Con.: Right Worthy Inductor, I confirm this. All rise. Ind.: Very worthy Fratres, I open this College of Adepts by giving five and one knocks and with the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mystic Word Thanatos. The knocks are repeated by the Expositor and Conductor: the Conductor opens the Sacred Volume. The Minutes of the last Adept Grade meeting in the Province should be read at this point, unless they havealready been read in Grade VII or Grade VI: the Ind. then calls on the Prov. Sec. to produce and read theForm bearing the authority of the Supreme Magus or Chief Adept for the advancement of the Candidate. Ceremony of Reception The Candidate knocks as a Philosophus, one and four. Cond.: Right Worthy Inductor, A Frater Philosophus seeks admission to our Vault. The following should be audible for all within the Vault. Ind.: I will accompany you and see if he is one of the chosen. Ind. follows Conductor to the Ante­room and stands in the doorway Ind.: Who are you, and what do you seek? Can., (prompted by Con.): I am a Philosophus and I seek Adeptship; if I am received I will never break mycovenant with you. The Banner is illuminated, and the Ind. indicates with a pointer or by hand the points marked. Ind.: Worthy Frater Philosophus, for four years and upwards you have been seeking the path of the returnof the Soul to its Source. In the symbolism of the Kabalistic Tree of Life you started as a Zelator in theSephira of Malkuth and, in subsequent Grades you have progressed to the Sephiroth of Yesod, Hod andNetzach. Thus prepared you have returned to Yesod on the middle pillar but now you are looking upwardstowards the Supernals. Before you is the path of Ayin which leads to the Sephira of Tiphareth, the Christ­centre, while beyond is the hidden Sephira of Daath where all things are dissolved into one. Across the Path of Ayin is the Veil of Paroketh, but my Frater, this Veil has been rent asunder by theRedeemer of Mankind and the way laid open for all who follow Him. Are you, my Frater, in all humility,resolved to follow on that path and dedicate yourself to the Christ­life? The Candidate answers. Beyond this portal is the Vault of the Adepts; it is a sanctuary of seven sides and seven angles wherein youmay learn to travel the Path. No earthly sun can shine therein, but the glimmering ray of a sanctuary lampserves to make darkness visible. You seek to be an Adept and must learn that the central maxim of the truelife of Adeptship is Jeheshua Mihi Omnia – Jesus is all things to me. You may now enter the Vault but your eyes are still veiled and a Conductor must lead you. The light on the banner is extinguished and the Ind. returns to the Vault. Ind.: V.W. Fratres, the candidate has proved himself one of the chosen and the Conductor will admit him. The Conductor places a black veil over the head of the Candidate, leads him into the Vault and stops beforethe Expositor The Conductor then places his right forefinger upon the lips of the Candidate, saying: Con.: Speak not, but follow me. The Conductor leads the Candidate once round the Vault in profound silence, and as they pass theInductor the Conductor utters the word of the 4th Grade, Theosophia. The Inductor answers: Pass, Theosophia. Then they move onward and stop in the West facing the Expositor The Conductor places his right forefinger on the lips of the Candidate saying: Con.: I remove the seal of Silence."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Exp.: Frater, who art thou? Con. (for Can.): I am one who mourns in darkness because of the King of Terrors; my days are compassedwith griefs, and my nights with sorrows. Show me the dawn of that Celestial light, which crowns with joythe perfect man. Exp.: Are you a Christian? Can.: I am Exp.: Enough; watch and pray till the True light shineth. The Conductor places the Candidate at the head of the pastos facing the East. Ind.: Worthy Frater, It was the practice of a distinguished Sage to enjoin strict silence upon all who soughtinstruction in the mysteries. The disciples of this great Teacher were not permitted to speak for a certainnumber of years, when the seal of silence was removed by the potent voice which had imposed it. This wasa sure test of the Candidate’s prudence and discretion, and of his ability to keep the secrets with which hemight be entrusted. In accordance with the custom thus observed by Pythagoras, we require a proof of obedience in this respectfrom each one who seeks the rank of an Adept of the Second Order of our Society. You have obeyed the injunctions of your Conductor, and are doubtless impressed with the importance ofSecrecy and Silence in the manifold affairs of our Society. In days of peril and persecution, when priests and princes sought the lives of all who truly worshipped theCreator, our vows of Fidelity, Secrecy and Silence secured the Order from the attacks of pretended friendsand of open foes; therefore, even as the Holy Prophet Jeremiah exclaims in the 5th verse of the 50thChapter of his Prophecies, \"Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not beforgotten.\" The Anthem is then recited or read, not necessarily by the Inductor: \"Remember now thy Creator in thedays of thy youth\" The Conductor restores the Candidate to light. Ind.: Let the Candidate kneel. The Expositor, Candidate and Conductor kneel at the head of the pastos. Ind.: Are you ready and willing to enter into a sacred and solemn Covenant with the Adepts of the Roseand Cross? Can.: I am Ind.: Then you will place your left hand beneath the Sacred Volume and extend your right hand upwards.State your Christian and Surnames, and the Motto by which you are known in the Society of the Rose andCross and say after me: Both: I, ..., in the presence of the living God, Who hath triumphed over death and the terrors of the grave,solemnly swear that I will ever obey the just commands of the Supreme Magus; that I will not communicateto any living Soul, unless to a duly sworn Adept, the time, place and occasion of my induction; that I willstudy the mysteries of the Three Worlds, Elemental, Intellectual and Celestial; and finally that I willconsider myself bound to the Fratres of this Grade by a peculiar tie, respecting and loving them whileliving, and mourning for them when dead. So help me, the Lord and Arbiter of Life and Death, and keepme faithful to this solemn Covenant. Ind.: You will now once kiss the Sacred Volume which you hold. This is done and the Sacred Volume is replaced on the pastos. Ind.: Having entered into the Covenant of the Adepts, you may rise. The Expositor, Conductor and Candidate rise and the Expositor returns to his place. Ind.: Let me now inform you that the time of your reception as an Adeptus Minor is midnight, the place a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Grave. The Word is Thanatos. Pronounce the Word, Thanatos. I recognise you, Frater, by that Word. I meet you here, my Frater, at this solemn hour and in this solemn place, not to awaken your sympathies byallusion to the grief and anguish caused by death throughout the world, but that henceforth you and I mayhave something more in common ­ the precious heritage of the faithful and discreet ­ that you may learnthat only by dying to your lower self, with its passions and prejudices, and being raised to a higher plane oflife and knowledge can you accomplish your task as a Rosicrucian Adept, and guide those learners whomay be committed to your charge. The Conductor leads the Candidate to the Inductor in the East. The Inductor then gives the Secrets. Ind.: The sign of Adeptship is that of a teacher: stand erect and copy me. Raise right hand and point up with the forefingers, left hand in small of the back. I also give you the Grip of Adeptship; in this position we repeat the Secret Word already given, Thanatos. We face each other. Can: Both hands extended to front, palms up, fingers bent up. Ind.: Both handsextended to front, palms down, fingers bent down. We now grip each others fingers. The grip implies that perfect bond of fidelity which should henceforth exist between us; it is within ourhearts that this bond originates, and while Truth has her residence there, it can never be weakened nordestroyed. The Knocks are 5 and 1: five implying Adeptship and one the first of the Adept Grades. Beseated, my Very Worthy Frater, in the vault of the Adepts, and the Expositor will read a Lecture on theaims and duties of the Adepti Minores. The Lecture of the Expositor Right Worthy Inductor, and Very Worthy Fratres Adepti. Frater Adeptus Minor. —You were chosen foradmission to the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia because having attained the rank of a Master Mason in aduly warranted Lodge, you had in that position shown yourself a man of worth and discretion, seekingmore knowledge of the Mysteries that encompass us. You have been received into the Second Order of our Society this day, because you have made steadyprogress in the studies and duties allotted to Fratres while they are members of the Four Grades of the FirstOrder. In the Grade of Zelator you were recommended to study the powers and properties of Numbers. and thephilosophy of the Hebrew Kabala, in which the relations between Numbers, Letters, Words and Things aredefined. In the Grade of Theorises, the mysteries of Nature, of mineral, vegetable and animal life, are proper studies,and its ritual of admission teaches you that beyond the colours, as well as the forms of objects, there areoccult relations which need investigation. The Grade of Practicus has special relation to the ancient art of Alchymy and particularly in its spiritualaspects. And lastly the Grade of Philosophus teaches the need of the highest mental culture in order to comprehendthe works of the philosophers, and the sacred volumes of the World Religions. The Theology of the Christian Church suggests a study of the older Jewish Faith, and this leads toresearches into the pagan beliefs and the realms of the Greco­Roman mythology, also to the religions ofAncient Egypt and the great Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic Faiths."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Your studies in the First Order should have been so extensive as to give you broad views of humanknowledge, life and duty. Your reception into Adeptship introduces you into a new status ­ that of the Teacher, and be assured, myVery Worthy Frater, that your long probation and extensive tuition have not been only for your ownbenefit. Your studies should have been directed and your mind well stored with science, and your handswell trained in art, in order that you might teach others. What you have received, that freely give. Know,then, that in the First Order you are learners, in the Second Order you are Teachers, while in the ThirdOrder you may become Rulers, Magi, or Magistri. The Right Worthy Inductor has conferred upon you the Sign, Grip, and Word of the Grade of AdeptusMinor. To these secrets I now add that the Jewel of the Rosicrucian Society should still be worn. butsuspended by a yellow ribbon, bearing Grade number. In addition the Adept Grades have their own jewel, which is a triangular plate of gold, an equilateral andequiangular triangle, suspended by a ribbon of yellow colour. Upon its face is engraved the Tetractys, socalled of Pythagoras, the famous Greek philosopher of Crotona, who lived about 520 B.C. This consisted of ten stars, which were in later times replaced by ten Yods, or Jods, the Chaldee or Hebrewletter corresponding to the English I or Y. These were arranged in four rows of 1, 2, 3, and 4, so as to beseen also as four rows in the alternative position. The Yod was considered as the Sacred Symbol of God. In Hebrew Numeration Yod was the Number Ten, called the Decad by ancient philosophers, and in thisfigure the Decad is considered as composed of One Yod referring to God, Unity, the Monad. Two Yodsrefer to IH, Jah; as above, so below; the Dyad, Matter. Three Yods refer to IHV; to Adam, Seth and Enoch; and to the Holy Trinity of the Christian Faith, andFour Yods to Yod He Vau He ­ Jehovah, ­ the Tetragrammaton, becoming INRI in the Christiansymbolism. Around this figure of the Tetractys are spaces in which the names and numbers of the Three Grades can beengraved. On the reverse side are the words Soc. Rosic. in Anglia; around this are the Divine initials IHVHand INRI, and there may be added the initials of the owner and of his motto. The Decad was called the emblem of the universe. If we further consider the Decad and the Tetractys ofPythagoras in the light of the hebrew Kabbalah, and according to the numerical values of the hebrew letterswe shall find that the important symbolic number, Seventy two is produced. Yod, I, alone is ten, Yod, Heh,IH is ten and five, that is fifteen. Yod, Heh, Vau, IHV is ten, five and six that is twenty­one. Yod, Heh,Vau, Heh, IHVH is ten, five, six, five, that is twenty­six. The total is seventy­two, the number of steps ofthe Ladder of Jacob which reached from earth to heaven; upon each step, says the Talmud, was an Angelbearing one of the names of God. These names are derived from the words and letters of the nineteenth,twentieth and twenty­first verses of the fourteenth chapter of the book of Exodus, and to each name isadded the angelic title of AL or AH as a termination. The number 72 is the numeration of the name Chesed. Cheth Samech Daleth, 8, 60, 4, which signifiesMercy; it is the 4th Sephira in the Kabalistic Tree of Life and signifies one of the Divine attributes of theTen holy Sephiroth. As has been already stated, the work of the Adepts is that of Thition as well as self improvement; as anAdeptus Minor it is your special duty to teach the Zelatores and the Fratres of the Grade of Theoricus,while in the College ceremonials you should be at all times able and willing to perform the duties of anAncient. You may feel well assured my Frater that the most sure way to fix any knowledge in the memory, is topractise the art of teaching that knowledge to others who are seeking to reach your own stage of progress.
