The Convocation is held in a Rosicrucian Temple. In the East there is a white Altar as in Grade I. On theAltar; at the foot of the Cross, are five candles ­ one in front of four. The College is closed in a Higher Degree or Adjourned from the Grade of Zelator: if the College isadjourned in the Grade of Zelator: all Zelatores, including the Candidate, are asked to withdraw. TheAncients take up their new positions, and the Candles on the Altar are adjusted by the Torchbearer: Thecandles and the position of the Ancients should be changed before the Opening of the Grade and after theClosing The four Ancients are seated at the centre of the Temple behind their pillars, each facing his own cardinalpoint, the backs of their chairs almost touching thus forming the Cosmic Cross of the Four Elements. ­ the Ancient of Earth, clothed in a black robe, faces North. ­ the Ancient of Water; in a blue robe, faces West. ­ the Ancient of Air; in a yellow robe, faces East. ­ the Ancient of Fire, in a red robe, faces South. Ancients’ Symbols (lamp, fan, bowl of earth, & bowl of water) are required for and should also be on thepedestals as they are the essential symbols of the Elements represented by the Ancients. The FourthAncient’s lamp (for convenience this is sometimes a candle) should be lit before the Temple is opened, andkept lit until after the Temple has been finally closed. The Celebrant is seated in the East, at the South side of the Altar, The Exponent is seated in the West. TheSecretary is seated in the North­East, the Conductor in the South­West, and the Guardian beside thePortal. The Acolyte is in the ante­chamber guarding the Temple. Each Frater must wear the Jewel of the Society with the appropriate ribbon. Whenever possible, although this may be varied by permission of the S.M. or a Chief Adept, there shouldbe not more than three Candidates for Grades II. Should circumstances render it necessary to have morethan the stated number of candidates the ceremony should be worked twice up to the Lecture, thecandidate(s) from the first working being allowed to stay in for the second working, after which the Lectureis given to all. If there have to be more than three candidates, one should be ‘Representative’, and he alonewill be blindfolded. All will enter together; but when the time comes (after the prayer) for theperambulation, those other than the Representative should be told to be seated (in the North­West), and toparticipate mentally in the perambulation, which is made by the Conductor and Representative only. Allcandidates should be called on to rise to join in the responses to the Exponent’s questions, and should thenfollow the Representative to the East, where the blindfold is removed from the Representative, and willremain together thereafter. (This procedure is to avoid the difficulty of leading a string of blindfoldedcandidates around the Temple.)

The Officers of the College have reported to me favourably upon the work of Frater ..., who is a Zelator,and I have resolved to receive him into the Second Grade, and to confer upon him the rights and privileges,as well as the secret knowledge, of a Theoricus.

The Guardian admits them, and they stand within the Portal."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Con.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, I present to you Frater , a Zelator of the Society of the Rose andCross. He has done the work required of him in the First Grade and received your approval. He now seeksto participate in the studies of the Second Grade, and to gain our secret knowledge. Cel.: Frater Zelator, I call upon you to give us the Sign and also the Pass Word and the Grand Word whichwere communicated to you upon your admission to our Society. The Zelator gives them accordingly. Cel.: We acknowledge you to be well instructed. Before undertaking any duty of importance it has alwaysbeen the custom of the Fratres of the Society of the Rose and Cross to invoke the blessing of God upontheir proceedings. Kneel, therefore, upon both knees and join in our supplications. (Candidate only kneels, all others stand with sign of prayer). Cel. (or Chaplain.): O God our Father, source of light and truth, pour down upon us the continual dew ofThy blessing, and prepare our hearts for the reception of a knowledge of the mysteries which surround us,so that we may be able to benefit mankind and fit ourselves for a dwelling in Thy heavenly kingdom. All: Amen and Amen. Cel.: In the name of God, who is our Creator and preserver, you may rise, and the Conductor will lead youaround our Temple in search of more Light upon the mysteries of our being. Fratres, be seated. All except the Conductor and Zelator resume seats. The Conductor leads the Zelator once around the Temple, and places him beside the Exponent in the West.Con.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, our Frater asks to be further instructed. Cel.: Frater Zelator, I commend your desire for knowledge and remind you that the Lord of Life and Lightwill assist and protect those who truly seek His Glory and the welfare of their fellows. Are those yourobjects in seeking reception into this Grade? Zel. (prompted by the Conductor): They are my objects, Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant. Cel.: Prompted by such sentiments you may safely advance. Guided by God’s word, assisted by the Light of Reason and a love of knowledge, you may hope to attainyour desires. Yet, before you can participate in the secrets of the Grade of Theoricus you must assent to the questionswhich will be put to you by the Exponent. Conductor turns the Zelator towards the Exponent. D.C. prompts other Candidates to rise and join in theresponses to the Exponent’s questions. Exp.: Do you promise to study with zeal the mysteries of our art and science? Zel.: I do. Exp.: Do you promise to attend in our Temple once in every year, when summoned, or write to theSecretary a valid excuse for your absence? Zel.: I do. Exp.: Do you promise to conceal the secret knowledge of this Grade from all persons who have not beenregularly received into it? Zel.: I do. Conductor and Zelator turn to face the Celebrant. Exp.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, the Zelator has given the promises which it is our custom torequire, and I now present him to you in all love and humility as being worthy to participate with us in ourtreasured knowledge. Cel.: Frater Conductor, you will lead our Frater Zelator four times around our Temple, and place himbefore the Altar."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This is done (i.e. a half circuit) Cel.: Let Light be restored to our Frater. This is done by the Conductor and all clap their hands four times and once. Cel.: The Cross of the Four Elements which you carry must now be shown to each of the Four Ancientswho in return will give you certain instruction. Frater Conductor, lead the Zelator four times around the Temple, each time stopping before one of theAncients: first to the Pillar of Air in the East then in succession to the Pillars of Fire, Water and Earth. Takecare that the Zelator shows to each Ancient the appropriate arm of the Cross of the Elements which hecarries. The Conductor and Zelator pass once around the Temple and stop at the Pillar of Air in the East. TheZelator presents the Yellow arm of the Cross, and the Ancient stands and holds it in his left hand waving afan with his right hand. A2.: I set in motion with this fan waves of Air which, although unseen by our eyes, are yet essential to alllife on earth. The Fan was an emblem used in all Antient Initiations to represent the Spirit of God, theSpiritual essence in man, the Air as necessary to sustain both life and fire. You must labour and havingprepared yourself by prayer, for the treasured knowledge you hope for, arm yourself with courage and aclear conscience, and fear nothing. Be circumspect and persevering. I give you the Pass Word Favonius. The Zelator repeats the Pass Word and is then led by the Conductor once again around the Temple, theystop at the Pillar of Fire in the South upon which a lamp is burning. The Zelator presents the Red arm ofthe Cross and the Ancient stands and holds it in his left hand, waving a flame with his right hand. A4.: This Flame typifies the Light of God in Nature, that burns ever unseen by mortal eye. Every naturalbody carries a spark within it, but the light is eclipsed by the grossness of matter. According to the presenceof the Lux of Life, all things flourish, or as it fails, they decay. We know that within us, so long as life dothlast, there is a continual burning, and as we lay our hands on our frames we feel the natural heat, which canproceed only from the Fire enclosed within us, a spark of the blessed fire­light with which we areimpregnated from above. Seek then for the true Lux, the Divine Light, which will warm your soul with the Love of God, withoutwhich you will not obtain the treasure of a true Rosicrucian. I give you the Pass Word, Ignigena. The Zelator repeats the Pass Word and is then led by the Conductor once more around the Temple andthey stop at the Pillar of Water in the West upon which is a bowl of water. The Zelator presents the Bluearm of the Cross, and the Ancient stands and holds it in his left hand, sprinkling water around him with hisright hand. A3.: Water is the menstruum or solvent of the world. Without it Man and all animal life would cease toexist, and all vegetation would fail, no blood would flow in our veins, no sap in the vessels of plants. Waterforms by far the largest constituent of our bodies, of our blood, of our drink and also of all our food.Without Water there could be neither growth nor decay, and none of the beneficial changes arising fromfermentation. The common water of the earth is tinctured with fire in its natural warmth, it is impregnatedwith air, and earth is both suspended and dissolved in it. My Frater, I ask you to seek the Living Water,which is the Water of Eternal Life; if you find it, drink of it freely that your sins may be purged and youriniquity washed away. Cleanse your soul in the layer of Regeneration and turn to God, Who willabundantly pardon. I give you the Pass Word, Aquaticus. The Zelator repeats the Pass Word and is then led by the Conductor once more around the Temple andthey stop at the Pillar of Earth in the North upon which is a platter of earth. The Zelator shows the Blackarm of the Cross, and the Ancient of Earth stands and holds it in his left hand, sprinkling earth with hisright hand around and upon the Zelator."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A1.: The Element Earth is typical of the cold and dry nature and is considered passive and fixed. Materialearth is the basis of all bodies in which other principles reside. Man was formed from the dust of the earthsays the Book of Genesis, and to the earth must his body return after death. Man has been called amicrocosm (a Little World) having within him the types of all the elements and forces which surround him.Remember that Fire preserves the Earth from being destroyed by Water, and Water saves the Earth fromdestruction by Fire; the Air preserves the Fire from extinction, and Earth provides a meeting place for theseveral elemental forces and forms of matter. These forces must remain in due equilibrium for the universe might be destroyed if any Element becamedominant, and Man’s progress and destiny would be changed. The Pass Word of the North is Terrigena. The Zelator repeats the Pass Word. A1.: The Exponent will now address you. The Conductor leads the Zelator around the Temple to the Exponent. Exp.: Observe then, my Frater, that Man is a complex being, and that even his body is formed of manyelements and exposed to many forces; we judge, then, that man’s sojourn here on earth is but a passing visitintended to be a period of probation. The Body of man is but the coat of skin enveloping the sentient,thinking, acting being who may rise or fall according to his birthright, his surroundings and the use hemakes of his will and conscience. Let us further consider the constitution of a Man as a type of allhumanity. Man is composed of a Body, Soul and Spirit. The Body is formed from the Material World. The Spirit ofMan is a Ray from the Celestial World of God and His Angels. The Soul of Man from the Celestial Worlddwells in the body, and is illuminated by the Divine Spirit from above. The Soul of Man may be considered as of two aspects; the higher Rational Soul, which gives theunderstanding mind, the intellect and the human will, and the lower or animal soul which gives the vitalpowers and the passions. Frater Conductor, lead the Zelator to the East and place him before the Celebrant. The Conductor does so. Cel.: Hand me the Cross which has secured to you the knowledge granted by the Four Ancients. The Zelator hands the Cross to the Celebrant. Cel.: This Cross is named the Cross of the Elements; it consists of a central white square and four arms ofequal length around it. They are coloured Red, Blue, Yellow and Black; the Red of Fire is above, theBlack of Earth is below; the Blue of Water is on the right, and the Yellow of Air is on the left; this is theposition of the four Ancients in the Temple in this Grade. The four colours are emblems of the four lettersof the Holy Name, Yod He Vau He, which we now call Jehovah. They also refer to the Four Worlds ofExistence, the Divine, Angelic, Formative and Material. You, my Frater, are a Temple of God, and may the Spirit of God always send you Light. Fear and loveGod, honour our Society and respect yourself; only so can you be prepared to exchange this earthly life fora realm beyond the reach of sin and sorrow. The Pass Words which you have received were Favonius, Ignigena, Aquaticus, and Terrigena and theirinitials form the first Word of the great dictum of the Creator, Fiat. The Grand Word is Zaphnath Paaneah, meaning A Revealer of Secrets. The Celebrant rises. Cel.: The Sign is to place the left hand so as to cover the face as in reverence of the Spirit within Man. TheGrip is given by the right hand with the thumb and two fingers only. By the Sign and the Grip thus given, I declare to the Fratres that you are a perfected Theoricus of theSocietas Rosicruciana in Anglia. I present you with a copy of the Ritual of this Grade. You should continue"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to wear the Jewel of the Society suspended by a plain green ribbon, as before. Be seated, Frater, and attend to the Lecture on Colours. The Lecture on Colours The distinctive task of the Theoricus, in the second Grade of our Society, is the study of the significanceand symbolism of Colours. At the beginning of His work of creation God said, \"Let there be Light\", and there was light. This Whiteglory of the Beginning was soon diversified, reflected in a myriad of rays from the air, fire, water and earthof the material world, and Man, in whom the work of creation culminated, became conscious of colours.The rainbow in the heavens made manifest to him the whole range of colours, and he soon was able todistinguish the seven that were most evident, and which we know as Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue,Indigo, and Violet. These colours of the rainbow are also seen on earth as well as in the heavens – we seethem in our flowers and fruits, on our hills and in our valleys, in our metals, and on the birds and animalsaround us. Of the seven main colours there are three that are, by common consent, more clearly perceived ­ Red,Yellow and Blue. White is the combination of all the colours, and all religions have attributed White and Light to God, bywhatever name He may be called. White is an emblem of goodness and purity. The priests and ministers of almost all faith shave been clothed in white garments in token of their highoffice. In the Old Testament we read of the white robes of Aaron and the sons of Levi. And in the NewTestament we read: \"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment\". White is also thesymbol of the beatific combination of love, innocence and faith which lead to purity, peace and perfection.The Diamond is the emblem. Black is the complete absence of Light and Colour and symbolises evil, the antithesis of all that is good,beautiful and true. It refers to loss, despair and death. The three primary colours ­ Red, Yellow and Blue ­ have been attributed to three divine qualities, namely ­Red to God’s Omnipotence, Yellow to his Omniscience and Blue to his Omnipresence, or, in other words,to his Power, Wisdom and Universality. In relation to Man, the colour Red denotes courage, will and force; hence to dominion and power. It is alsorelated to war and to each man’s fight with his passions. Yellow refers to intellect and knowledge, and thusto wisdom, and it is emblematical of calm, peace and gladness. Blue refers to honour, love, friendship andfidelity, hence to benevolence. In the world around us we associate the colour Red with fire, with blood and wine and with the Ruby.Yellow with the sun’s rays, giving life to all animal and vegetable life, with gold, corn and oil, and with theTopaz. Blue with the vault of the cloudless heaven and the deep sea beneath it and with the Sapphire.These three colours predominate in flowers and are supplemented by Orange, Purple and Violet; and Greenis the almost universal colour of leaves and growing shoots of all vegetation. In symbolism Green refers tohope, progress, evolution and regeneration. It is typified by the Emerald. Purple has become associatedwith Imperial Rule and dignity from its combination of power and love. Its emblem is the Amethyst. Orange has been referred to zeal and enthusiasm and to mental and moral development and self­control.Violet is the colour referred to penitence, and Grey is symbolical of humility. Brown is the colour of a large part of the solid earth on which we live, and is associated with durability,firmness, constancy and self­abnegation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"So the varied colours by which we are surrounded in Nature and which show forth the beauties of God’screation, reveal to us something of the Beauty of His holiness, which it is our aim to reflect as best we canin our own lives. Closing Celebrant rises, Knocks once. All rise. Cel.: Fratres, you will rise and assist me to close the Temple in the Grade of Theoricus. All rise Cel.: Join with me in giving the Sign and speaking the Word. This is done by all. Cel.: Let us give thanks and pray. All turn to the East and assume an attitude of prayer. Cel. (or Chaplain): O God our Creator, we thank Thee for our preservation and for the knowledge wehave already acquired; be pleased to grant unto us mercy and peace, and continue to favour us with healthand strength so that we may be enabled to make further progress in the path which leads to wisdom and topersonal perfection. We seek these blessings through the Name of I.N.R.I., the Great Redeemer. Amen. All rise. Cel.: Fratres, our duties in this Grade being concluded. I now close the Temple by giving four knocks andone. Benedictus benedicat nos ad finem. All: Amen and Amen. The College is rearranged and then resumed in the Grade of Zelator.Home"}]
