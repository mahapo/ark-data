[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia Grade III – Practicus 2005This Grade is conferred by the Celebrant of a College holding a warrant for the four Grades of the FirstOrder of the Society. The Convocation is held in a Rosicrucian Temple. A White Altar stands in the East, as in Grade I. Uponthe Altar are also five candles, two in front of three. The College is adjourned in the Grade of Zelator (or closed in the Grade of Philosophus), all Fratresbelow the Grade of Practicus, including the Candidates, are asked to withdraw, the Ancients move to theirnew positions, and the Altar candles are changed (also the Cross of Grade IV has been workedimmediately before Grade III). The candles and the position of the Ancients should be changed before the Opening of the Grade and afterthe Closing. The Celebrant is seated in the East at the South side of the Altar, the Exponent in the West, the Secretary inthe North­East, the Conductor in the South­West and the Guardian near the Portal. The Four Ancients form the Cross of the Elements and are seated in the middle of the Temple, facingoutwards; the First Ancient (of Earth) in black facing North; the Second Ancient (of Air) in yellow, facingEast; the Third Ancient (of Water) in blue, facing West; the Fourth Ancient (of Fire) in red, facing South.Ancients’ Symbols are required. The Acolyte is without the Portal in the ante­chamber. Each Frater must wear the Jewel of the Society with the appropriate ribbon. Whenever possible, although this may be varied by permission of the S.M or a Chief Adept, there should benot more than three Candidates for Grades III. Should circumstances render it necessary to have morethan the stated number of candidates in the Adept Grades, the ceremony should be worked twice up to theLecture, the candidate(s) from the first working being allowed to stay in for the second working, afterwhich the Lecture is given to all. The Candidate must be supplied with an Admission Badge, a SwastikaCross, the arms to be coloured red, blue, black and yellow, the central square alone being white. The Candidate is not blindfolded; he must carry the Cross in his right hand. The Candidate will knock as aTheoricus, four and one, when he seeks admission at the Portal of the Temple. The knocks of a Practicus are two and three. When an Officer is addressing the Celebrant he should give the sign of this Grade. Rituals for Candidates are placed near the Celebrant. Opening Celebrant gives one knock. All rise, and the Guardian stands beside the Portal. Gel.: Fratres, assist me to open the Temple in the Grade of Practicus. Gel.: Frater Guardian, you will take care that the Acolyte is without, and that the Portal of the Temple isduly closed."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Guardian does this and reports. Gdn.: The Portal is closed, and the Temple is safely guarded. Gel.: I declare that the Temple is now duly opened in the Grade of Practicus. Celebrant gives two and three knocks. All assume sign of prayer. Gel. (or Chaplain): May peace and harmony dwell among us, and may our exertions to achieve success inthe practice of our Rosicrucian duties lead us to the solution of the great problems of our Science, thetransmutation of the Elements, the fixing of the Volatile, and volatilization of the Fixed. All: Amen. Amen. Amen. Gel.: Be seated, Fratres. Ceremony of Reception Gel.: Fratres, we are assembled to carry on the work of our Society in the Grade of Practicus, to receive aTheoricus among us, and to confer upon him the rights and privileges as well as the secret knowledge ofthe Third Grade. Exp.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, we rejoice to hear that another Frater has deserved to be receivedas a Practicus; and we will assist in his reception, and will give him, to the best of our ability, all the help hemay need to ensure his further progress. Con.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, Frater ..., having worthily performed his duty as a Theoricus inthe Second Grade, and having been chosen for reception into the Third Grade, is in attendance without thePortal. He seeks admission in order to proceed to the practical and experimental work of the Society of theRose and Cross. Cel.: Frater Conductor, you will leave the Temple and receive from our Frater the Secret Words of aTheoricus, hand to him (if more than one Candidate, to the leading Candidate) the Swastika Cross ofAdmission, and instruct him to knock on the Portal as a Theoricus. Conductor complies; knocks four and one are heard. Cel.: Frater Guardian, you will admit the Conductor and the Theoricus whom he brings with him. This is done, and both stand within the Portal. Con.: Right (or Very) Worthy Celebrant, I present to you Frater a Theoricus of our Society who, havingbeen duly attentive to the studies of that Grade, now seeks to obtain a practical knowledge of our secretwork. Cel.: Frater Conductor, you will lead the Theoricus once around the Temple, and then place him in theWest before the Exponent who desires to put certain questions. This is done. Exp.: Give me the Sign and Word of a Theoricus. Candidate does so. (Shield face with left hand): Zaphnath Paaneah. Cel.: You have been selected for advancement because you have shown zeal and ability in the Theoreticstudies of our Society. Do you make a solemn promise to continue with unabated fervour to pursue yourresearches into the Mysteries of Nature? Can.: I do. Exp.: Will you endeavour to discover the secrets of the Material World by practical Work? Can.: I will. The Conductor turns Candidate to face the Celebrant."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Cel.: Do you solemnly promise on the honour of a Rosicrucian to preserve and keep secret from everyZelator, and from every Theoricus until his reception into a College of Practici, and from every otherperson who is not a Rosicrucian, the hidden knowledge of the Grade, and also the Concealed Word of aPracticus, and any other sign or secret that may be made known to you? Can.: I do promise. Cel.: Fratres, shall we trust this Theoricus with our Secret Knowledge? All: We put our trust in his faith and in his abilities. Cel.: Frater Conductor, you will place our Frater before me in the East. Cel.: Hand to me the Cross you bear. This is done by the Candidate. Cel.: The form of the Cross of especial symbolism in the Grade of Practicus is the Swastika, called also theFylfot Cross. It is an emblem of very ancient date, and has been found in countries widely separated, it isthe Cross of the Jams of India, and was the Hammer of Thor of Scandinavian myths. This Grade is chieflyconcerned with the study of the material Universe, and the arms of this figure are referred to the FourElements of the Ancient Philosophers. The colours Red, Blue, Yellow and Black refer to Fire, Water, Airand Earth, on the lower plane; and on the higher plane, to the Hebrew letters, Yod, Heh, Vau, Heh of theGreat Name Jehovah; and again to INRI, who is Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum; and these initials INRIagain refer to Jammim, Nour, Ruach, and Yabeshah, which were the Chaldean names for the FourElements. The central square is White, to represent the blending of all colours into a Unity. The Celebrant places the Cross on the Altar, below the Calvary Cross. Cel.: I will now reveal to you the Secret Word of the Grade, which is Alchemia, meaning Alchemy. TheSign is given thus; point down with the left hand to your material work, while you look up as for help fromabove. The Conductor places the Candidate in the North, facing South. Cel.: Know then, Frater Practicus, that your new study is Alchemy, the Science of the composition of theMaterial World; in this study Practice and Experiment alone can lead to success, and these require to bepreceded by the Theoretical knowledge of the former Grade. Exp.: Learn then, O Practicus, to separate the Subtle from the Gross, gently and with judgement, for such isthe true process of Transmutation on the Spiritual plane as well as in the Material World. Cel.: We can but point out the Way; you yourself must follow out the path. We can check you when youwander from the narrow way of progress to the goal; but you yourself must perform the steps of theprocess. Exp.: Solve et Coagula; Time and Heat and Moisture act upon the First Matter of the Philosophers, and youwill be led to the Queen and to the King. Through the Black Dragon of Putrefaction and the White Eagleof Sublimation you may at length attain to the Red Stone, the Quintessence, the Son of the Sun, and sobecome possessed of the Key to the Constitution of Malkuth. Cel.: Know then, O Practicus, that there is a Physical Alchemy, and a possible Transmutation ofElementary Matter; and there is a Spiritual Alchymy reserved for your enlightenment in the Grade ofPhilosophus. Exp.: Learn then to preserve our Secret Wisdom. The Alchymists have ever used the language ofMetaphor; and when we describe the Physical processes we veil our ideas in Spiritual language; and whenwe write down the secrets of the Spiritual World, we use the language of Physical Alchymy. Cel.: Ever so, my Frater, have the boasters and ignorant of the outside World been deceived, and have beenhoodwinked and led astray by their own conceits. The Conductor places the Candidate before the Celebrant."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Celebrant stands and, holds out his right hand. Cel.: Swear then with me, O Practicus, swear by your good right hand; ‘May it perish and wither away if itwrite our secrets without Emblem, Metaphor, and Symbol’.

You should continue to wearthe jewel of the Society suspended by a plain green ribbon, as before. I present you with a copy of theRitual of this Grade. You may now take your seat among the Practici, and attend to a Lecture on Alchymy. Lecture The subject of Alchemy is one of great interest and it is well to approach the consideration of the sciencefrom the standpoint of Western Occult Philosophy, handed down to us from the Sages of MediaevalEurope and obtained by them from three principal sources. Firstly, from the Arabs, who almost alonepreserved the ancient sciences through the dark ages. Secondly, from Rabbis of Hebrew culture, whopossessed the traditional lore now identified by the name ‘Kabbalah’, that tradition to which ancientChaldea and Babylon so largely contributed. Lastly, from the ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs, ruled bymighty priest­kings, who were initiates in the Mysteries of Isis, Osiris and Serapis. Alchymy has two aspects: the material and the spiritual. The opinion that Alchymy was only a form ofChemistry is untenable by anyone who has read the works of its chief professors. The doctrine thatAlchymic writings were only religious teachings, and that the chemical references were all foolishallegories, is equally untenable in the face of history which shows that many of its most noted professorswere men who had made important discoveries in the domain of chemistry, and were in no way notable asteachers either of ethics or of religion. Chemistry, the modern science which investigates the construction of material substances, is the linealdescendant of Mediaeval and Antient Alchemy. The syllable Al is the Arabic definite article, meaning‘The’, and so Alchymy was The Higher Chemistry. It treated of the essential nature of Matter of theElements, of metals, of minerals, and of Transmutation. Modern Chemistry is a science devoted chiefly toutilitarian and commercial uses. The earliest use of the word ‘Alchemy’ is believed to be found in theworks of Julius Firmicus Matemus, an Astronomer, who lived in the time of the Emperor Constantine. Theoldest Alchemic Volume known is by Zosimus of Panopolis, in Greek, and is entitled, ‘The Divine Art ofmaking Gold and Silver’; it was written about AD 400. The Mediaeval authors often call Alchymy the‘Hermetic Art’, implying an origin from Hermes Trismegisrus of Egypt, the prehistoric teacher, to whomwas attributed the ‘Emerald Tablet’, which has been not inaptly described as being a résumé of allAlchemic science on a single page. Amongst the most famous names of European Alchymy we note that several were of men who rose to highdignity in the Church; such were Pelagius; Synesius, a Bishop; Heliodorus, a Bishop; Cremer; Ripley, aCanon; Albertus Magnus, a Dominican; Thomas Aquinas; Basil Valentine, a Benedictine: Raymond Lully,a Franciscan; Trithemius, an Abbot of Spanheim; and Pope John XXII. The science of Alchemy taught that all material substances were primordially derived from the basic ‘hyle’(pronounced highlee) or foundation. From this basis differentiation arose, and by myriad steps the immensevariety of material substances, such as we now see around us, originated by progression. From the common Minerals were developed the Metals, also in gradation of purity and excellence, until anacme was reached in the two so­called Perfect Metals, Silver and Gold. Hence arose the Art ofTransmutation, by which it was sought to produce Silver and Gold from other metals below them in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"series, notably from Mercury, Antimony and Lead. Many, indeed, were the processes devised, but therewas a general concensus of opinion that the last three stages of the chemical process were marked by aseries of colour changes, from Black through White to Red; this red matter was the Philosopher’s Stone, orRed Elixir, which could transmute Silver into Gold. The Alchymists also endeavoured to produce from certain herbs an Elixir Vitae, (Elixir of Life) whichshould have power to prolong life and restore health to the sick. The discovery of Elements has been the grand achievement of relatively Modem Chemistry, and certainrenown has for a century been granted to any chemist who has added a new element to the existingcatalogue. The future may change this system, and a niche in the Temple of Fame may be allotted to onewho succeeds in dividing one of our present elements into its constituents. The Chemistry of the future mayseek to gain the power of reducing all compounds, and all the elements to one primordial matter, namedPROTYLE (pronounced Pro­tile­ee). In other words, the ancient chemical doctrine of the proteehulee, orFIRST MATTER, may become paramount in the years to come, as it was in the distant past. If the modern doctrine of Elements be laid aside, the discoveries of the Primordial Matter, theTransmutation of Metals, and the Elixir of Life reappear and once more enter the range of possibleachievements. Ancient Alchemy recognised no Elements, in our modern sense; an element being nowdefined as ‘a body which cannot be decomposed’, or ‘something to which we can add, but from which wecan take away nothing’, or ‘a body which increases in weight with every chemical change’, or ‘a bodydifferent from all others, yet having constant characters itself, and indivisible except into parts of itself. TheElements of the Alchymists were Fire, Air, Earth and Water. A close study of the oldest authors shows thatthese were types of four modes of force or matter, and further that they are four correlative terms, implyingstates mutually related and dependent, and in no way independent and opposed entities. They were namesof four states: Fire Heat and Dryness Air Heat and Moistness Earth Cold and Dryness Water Cold and Moistness This was demonstrated even by Aristotle, who showed that matter, simple, or combined with itsdevelopments, may exist in each of these states. The Alchymists affirmed the existence of the Primum Ens (First Being) or First Matter; two Opposites orContraries; three Principles; and four Elementary states. Beyond these came Minerals, and lastly the SevenMetals, as forms of matter, essentially stable, except in the hands of the skilled operator, who might acquirethe power of Transmutation, or of changing one of them into another. Gold, as the most perfect metal, wasthe effect of the greatest transmutation, which process, once known, rendered all others of little importance.Hence all the efforts of the Alchymists on the material plane were directed to this, the crowningachievement of the work. For this process of Transmutation, one substance was requisite, the Philosopher’s Stone, the Quintessence,or Son of the Sun. This was to be derived from the Philosophical Mercury, Salt and Sulphur, and had topass in the process through the colours Black and White to the Red. This Stone was by some expected tobe also one means for the production of the Elixir of Life. Historical proof may be wanting that the ‘Stone of the Philosophers’ was ever found and used, but nocandid student can doubt that the life­long labours of the Alchymists, their modes of chemical manipulation,and their utensils, laid the foundation of our Modem Chemistry. The number of elements known to the modern chemist is increasing every year. The statement of a fixednumber of elements was only a temporary dogma, which the Alchemists wisely abstained from"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"propounding. Crookes and Faraday have said: ‘To decompose the metals, to re­form them, to change oneinto another, and to realize the once absurd notion of transmutation, are the problems given to the chemistof the future for solution.’ The strongest evidence of the want of elementary characters in our modern elements is provided by thespectroscope, and the intense heat and light obtainable from electricity. Several so­called elements, whenexposed to the latter, show in the spectroscope that they are not simple bodies. Spectroscopic examinations of rays of light from the Sun and Stars point out that while some of ourelements are by their spectra shown to exist in them, other elements are certainly broken up in those regionsof intense heat, and their constituents are disseminated and otherwise associated, thereby proving that in theSolar regions at any rate, such elements are compound bodies. Some examples of Alchemic descriptions of processes on the Material Plane are here given. From the ‘Open Entrance to the Shut Palace of the King’, by Eugenius Philalethes, is this clearly chemicalpassage:­ Take four parts of the perfected Stone, either red or white; melt them in a clear crucible. Take one part ofthis to ten parts of purified Mercury; heat the Mercury until it begins to crackle, then throw in your mixture,which will pierce it in the twinkling of an eye. Increase your fire until all be melted, and you will have amedicine of an inferior order. The following is from Jean d’Espagnet, and shows the use of Alchemic imagery:­ Take a red dragon, courageous and warlike to whom no natural strength is wanting: take also seven or ninenoble virgin eagles, whose eyes will not wax dull in the rays of the Sun: Cast the Birds in with the Beastinto a clear prison, shut them up strongly, under which let a bath be placed, that they might be incensed tofight by the warm vapour. In a short time they will enter upon a hard contention; until about the fiftieth daythe eagles begin to tear the beast in pieces; this one, dying, will infect the whole prison with black poison,whereby the eagles also being injured, they also will be soon constrained to give up the ghost. It may be easily perceived that this Allegory is convertible into a description of chemical processes, thus:­ Take one part of a red powder a and add seven or nine parts of the liquid b, which is volatile, ie, able to fly,mix them, put the mixture into a glass retort ­ the clear prison ­ hermetically seal the opening, that is, shutthem up strongly, set the vessel on a water bath, and then the heat will make the liquid attack the solidpowder and dissolve it, and the result will be the production of a black substance, and both the red powderand the liquid will have lost their previous chemical characters. In the Mytho­Hermetic Dictionary of A. J. Pernety, 1758, an explanation of Alchemic terms upon thematerial plane is supplied. The ritual of the Grade of Practicus alludes to several terms of Alchymic Art, as to which the followingremarks may be useful to students.­ Solve et Coagula: these words meant either Dissolve and precipitate from solution, or Melt and solidify:time and heat would melt substances, time, I heat and moisture would dissolve them. The King and Queenusually referred to Sol or Gold, and to Luna or Silver respectively: but some Alchemists refer the title Kingto the Sulphur, and Queen to the Mercury of the Philosophers. Gold is, of course, often called the King ofMetals. The whole difficulty of carrying out today the processes of the Alchymists, consists in the uncertainty as towhat actual solids and liquids, metals, acids and alkalis are to be taken when Mercury, Sulphur and Salt, orSun and Moon, or King, Queen, and Son are alluded to. The sublimation or volatilization of a substance was called the White Eagle; the Black Eagle referred toputrefaction, by which was meant conversion by heat of dissolved substances or liquids into a sediment orprecipitate, or of melted substances into slag or form of ashes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Quintessence, or Son of the Sun, was the ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, which was made from the Salt,Sulphur, and Mercury of the Philosophers, which by putrefaction or calcination, became Black, and thenby further processes White, and finally the Redness of Perfection was achieved. This ‘Stone of the Wise’ was the Key to Transmutation; the Alchemists declared that by its power one formof matter could be changed into another; Lead became raised into Silver, while Silver could be changedinto Gold, called by them Sol, the Sun or the King. Malkuthis the Kabalistic name for the material world, and for Matter in its multiform states, hence the Stoneof the Philosophers was called the ‘Key to the Constitution of Malkuth’. The old Alchemic books, then, have been shown to be definitely of a chemical nature. Let us now turn toquotations from the works of eminent Alchemists, which illustrate their religious attitude. Geber, the Arabian, wrote:­ \"Our Stone has been described by me in a way agreeable to the Most High, the Blessed Sublime andGlorious God, as it has been infused by the grace of His goodness, who gives and withholds as it pleasesHim. Study with great industry and labour and by continued deep meditation; be sons of Truth and youshall have most excellent gifts of God.\" Nicholas Flamel wrote:­ \"God reserves to Himself to reveal to a select few as such as fear and love Him, certain things toknowledge which therefore ought not to be written.\" In the book of Aureus (i.e. Golden), attributed to Hermes. is the following passage:­ \"My Son, before all things I admonish thee to fear God, in Whom is thy strength,’ whatsoever thou hearestconsider it rationally It behoves thee to give thanks to God, Who has bestowed liberally of His bounty tothe wise, and Who delivers us from misery. I am proven by the fulness of His substance and His wonders,and humbly pray that while we live we may come unto Him.\" ‘The Water Stone of the Wise’, an anonymous tractate:­ \"In the first place the practice of Alchymy enables us to understand, not merely the marvels of nature, butthe nature of the Great Divine One Himself in His unspeakable glory. It shadows forth in a wonderfulmanner how Man is an Image of a Divine Trinity; he represents the Union of Substances, as well as thedifference of Persons. It illustrates our purification from sin, and in brief all the Christian faith, and thereasons why Man must pass through much tribulation and anguish and fall a prey to death before he canrise again to a new and higher life. All this we see in our Art as in a Mirror.\" And then in the next sentence the author reverts to the practical chemical part, adding:­ \"Secondly, its earthly use consists in changing all imperfect metals, by means of a Tincture, into pure Gold,as I shall try to show.\" From about the year 1650 the work of the Alchymists ceased to be given to the world by printed works.Private traditions have, however, always affirmed the permanence of both the theory and art oftransmutation. This silence has been at last broken by the appearance of a new school of philosophers, who have espousedalmost entirely the principle of demonstrating the reality of Alchemy upon the higher or spiritual planes. Dr Kopp, in his ‘History of Chemistry’, takes this view; and there is a masterly volume by E. A. Hitchcock,entitled ‘Remarks upon Alchemy’, where he shows that Man was the ‘Matter’ of some of the Alchemists.Another work entitled ‘A Suggestive Enquiry into the Hermetic Mystery’ takes the same view. The moral and spiritual aspects of the so­called Higher Alchemy were illustrated also by the late AnnaKingsford and her co­worker Edward Maitland. They succeeded in many cases in drawing explanations ofAlchemic language by means of Hermetic allegory, and also in demonstrating an Alchemic mode ofthought and allusions to transmutation on the ethical and higher planes from some of the narratives found in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the early books of the Old Testament. The keynote of Alchemy upon this basis is, of course, the implied possibility of the material once againtaking on the spiritual aspect by successive purifications, which process may be suitably described by termsallied to the art of chemistry. Similar terms of Alchemic art may be used, to describe those schemes of moral, ethical, and spiritualpurification which we call Religion. For Religion should mean the processes which may re­unite us fallibleand erring creatures to our God, the Divine Spirit illuminating us. The Higher Alchemy then is almost identical with Religion, as distinct from Theology. The function ofReligion, like the Great Work of the Alchemist, is Spiritualization, the separation of the subtle from thegross; the redemption of spirit, while still dwelling in matter, from the taint inevitable to the lowest planes ofmanifestation. Or again, the transmutation of the animal forces which are in man ­ in excess of the bodilyneeds of subsistence ­ into the more human and refined emotions, the more delicate shades of feeling, thepurer and higher manifestations of which even the human personality is plainly susceptible. From another point of view, and by the use again of other but allied terms, is perceived that aspect ofmental purification and that form of transmutation into higher powers which is expressed by the ideal ofAtonement, At­onement, the reunion of the spark to the flame, of the offspring to the parent, of the ray tothe sun, of the personal thinker to the divine type of the Christos, of the overshadowing Divine Spirit, fromwhich each one of us has emerged and must remain separate until we shall be again re­united by personaleffort, enthusiasm and self­sacrifice to the Divine Source of all good. The Alchymic expression of ‘Solve et Coagula’ meaning volatilize and fix’ as two contrasted processesseen alike in chemistry, physics, and human development, are traceable in the Biblical allegories of thedescent of the Soul into Man, by the putting on of ‘coats of skin’. The human Ego or Monad becomes fixedin matter, and suffers the consequent loss of the power of direct spiritual communion with the sourceDivine. On the other hand we have the allegory of the Resurrection of the Son of the Divine One, whoobtains reunion with the Godhead by casting off the cloak of matter and returning to His Father, and to ourFather; and this resurrection is promised to all who truly seek it. By birth upon earthman is fixed,coagulated and fettered by his environment. By death, and by the throwing off of his material body and itsanimal passions, man is released from his bondage, and passes at once to a Higher Plane, even if his finalabsorption into Paradise be delayed. Besides the important analogies already alluded to, the terms Sol and Luna, (Sun and Moon) which inchemistry refer to Gold and Silver, may be well understood as referring on the spiritual plane to the souland the Body of Man. The three term,. Mercury, Salt and Sulphur, have also been used as synonyms of thethree persons of the Trinity: the Divine Father ­ Mercury; the Divine Mother, passive principle or the HolyGhost­ Salt; and the Son of God, the Christ, the Divine Power inhuman manifestation. ­ Sulphur. As a lastexample, the Black Dragon of putrefaction, which by time and force can become fashioned into the WhiteSwan of purity, is a beautiful symbol of the change in man, from a life of sin to a reformed personality, tothe man purified by suffering, chastened by humility, and fit to commune with the Holy Ones whom Godhas created. To conclude, it seems manifest that the writings of many mediaeval European Alchemists enshrine adoctrine at once exalted, fascinating in formulation, eloquent in language, and worthy of serious study.
