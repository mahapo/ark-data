The Sacred Volume is placed on the pastos at the head, and a lighted lamp at the foot: a memorial tabletmay be placed on the pastos, and if this is done it should be placed so that it can be read from the East.The chairs should, as far as is practicable, be set out to form a seven­sided shape, with apex to the East.The Vault is but dimly lit. The candidate must be an Adeptus Minor Grade V and must wear the Jewel of the V Grade. Whenever possible, although this may be varied by permission of the S.M. or a Chief Adept, there shouldbe not more than two Candidates for Grade VI. In the anteroom the Acolyte prepares the Candidate and instructs him how to knock for admission. (Fiveand One). Ceremony of Reception One year should elapse between the Minor and Major Receptions, but the Most Worthy Supreme Magus orthe Chief Adept of a Province may abbreviate the period. The Candidate, wearing the Jewel of theRosicrucian Society and ribbon of the 5th Grade, knocks as an Adeptus Minor with five and one; he is notveiled. The Vault is prepared as for Grade V. Ind.: Right (or Very) Worthy Conductor, please confirm that all within the Vault are of Grade VI or higher.Cond.: Right Worthy Inductor, I confirm this. All rise. Ind.: Very Worthy Fratres, I open this College of Adepti Maiores, by giving Five and Two knocks,***** **, and with the Mystic Words Memento Mori. The knocks are repeated by the Expositor and Conductor. Conductor opens V.S.L. All resume their seats. The Minutes of the last Adept Grade meeting in the Province should be read at this point, unless they havealready been read in Grade VII°: the Ind. then calls on the Prov. Sec. to produce and read the Formbearing the authority of the Supreme Magus or Chief Adept for the advancement of the Candidates. The general lighting is extinguished. When the knocks given by the Candidate are heard the Conductor admits him and places him in the Westfacing the Inductor. Ind.: Are you an Adept? Con. for Cand.: I have seen the lesser light that shines in darkness, and have passed the barrier that shutsout the uncovenanted races of men. Ind.: By what word do you seek admission? Con. for Cand.: By the mysterious Word Thanatos whose signification is known only to a true Adeptus"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Minor. Ind.: Frater Conductor, you will give the Candidates your hands, with the grip of Adeptship, and let Virtueunite two Hearts and two Souls, and may Friendship make you one. This is done. Ind.: Worthy Fratres, as you have borne in mind the solemn Covenant that exists between you and theAdepts of the Society of the Rose and Cross, and have now voluntarily presented yourself to renew thatsacred covenant, let me inform you that each step you take, and each word you utter will bind you stillcloser to our Fraternity. Reflect therefore, before you enter into irrevocable engagements. Pronounce notwords which are, to every true Adept, fraught with deep and mystic import unless you are resolved toadhere to the principles they teach. I will now recite to you the Covenant you entered into at the time of your Reception as an Adeptus Minor,and you must again signify your assent, if you can conscientiously agree to abide by the same in Spirit andTruth. Ind.: The Fratres will rise. Let the Candidates kneel. The Expositor. Candidate and Conductor kneel at the head of the Pastos. Ind.: You will place your left hand beneath the Sacred Volume and extend your right hand upwards. Stateyour Christian and Surnames, and the Motto by which you are known in the Society, and renew yourassent by saying after me: I, ..., in the presence of the living God, Who hath triumphed over death, and the terrors of the grave,solemnly swear that I will ever obey the just commands of the Supreme Magus; that I will not communicateto any living Soul, unless to a duly sworn Adept, the time, place and occasion of my induction; that I willstudy the mysteries of the three worlds, Elemental, Intellectual and Celestial; and finally, that I will considermyself bound to the Fratres of this Grade by a peculiar tie, respecting and loving them while living, andmourning for them when dead. So help me the Lord and Arbiter of Life and Death and keep me faithful to this solemn Covenant. Ind.: You will now twice kiss the Sacred Volume. This is done and the Sacred Volume is replaced on the Pastos. Ind.: Having repeated the Covenant of the Adepts you may rise. The Expositor places his right forefinger on the Candidate’s lips with the words: Exp.: You are a man of Honour, and a Rosicrucian Adept; be silent, prudent and wise. The Expositor returns to his place. All, except Conductor and Candidate, resume seats. Ind.: Worthy Fratres, the Occult Sciences reveal to man the mysteries of his nature, the secrets of hisorganisation, and the means of attaining perfection and happiness. From chaos order arose and, out of darkness, light; in like manner from the dust and ashes of our corporealforms springs the pure and lustrous essence of Immortality. No storm can shake, no cloud can darken thespirit of the self­contained and virtuous man. However black may be the night his calm untroubled heart beats on in faith and love, his eye beholds thecoming radiance, and when others sink beneath gloomy terror, the prescience of his glorious future sustainsthe child of hope. For you this dawn appears, for you this spiritual freedom is promised, but you must purify your soul by amoral lustration; you must purge your mind of the earthly dross of mere humanity, and strive in earnest tobecome a partaker of those immortal joys, which are to be found equally in the Past, the Present and theFuture. To guide your progress let me impress upon you the value and importance of our symbols. Study their"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"mystic meaning, and shape your actions by the precepts therein revealed. Our ceremonies may seem tomany curious and obscure, but when thoroughly comprehended they are instinct with life and beauty. We employ these symbols, because knowledge thus communicated dwells longer in our memories thanmere utterances that pass away. The Conductor leads the Adept to theist and places him before the Inductor. Ind.: The words of an Adeptus Major are Memento Mori. Not in the craven spirit of one who goes to a doom he fears, but like a Pilgrim whose heritage of Lightshines afar off beyond these dim and darksome plains. For the wise man Death is not. Men have raised aphantom, which ignorance alone renders terrible. Death is change, and mutability is a law of nature. Wetherefore contemplate this inevitable change with serene and hopeful faith, and regard this mortal life as buta vestibule to the Temple of Immortality. Persevere therefore, my Frater, in the study of true philosophy,and in due time you shall receive an exceeding great reward. The time of your reception is now technically six in the morning or the dawn of day, and in regularprogression we hope you will reach the light and glory of Noon, when the Sun shines in its strength, andthe earth rejoices in its rays. The Sign and Grip are those of an Adeptus Minor. The knocks by which you may on another occasionobtain admission are Five and Two. Five is the sign of Adeptship in our Order, and two the sign of yourhaving obtained the Second Adept grade of Adeptus Major. Be seated, My Very Worthy Fratres, and the Expositor will read a Lecture upon the aims and duties of anAdeptus Major. The Lecture of the Expositor Very Worthy Frater Adeptus Major, as you have now been duly received into the Sixth Grade of ourSociety, which is the second Grade of Adeptship, let me congratulate you on the progress you have made. The special duties of our ancient Fratres in this Grade were the teaching and guidance of the Practici. Inaddition to these duties an Adeptus Major was instructed in the importance of Contemplation and wastaught that great powers are to be gained by Mental Concentration. Each Adept of our Society shouldtherefore make a solemn study of himself, observing any mental or moral failings that beset him, and shouldendeavour to cultivate and strengthen those faculties which he finds lacking in his development. The life ofan Adept well spent in thought, word and deed should be a fitting preparation for a calm repose. The Secret Words of this Grade, Memento Mori, are intended to provide a bridle to your tongue, a guardianto your mind and a tutor to your passions. These Secret Words should also form the text of your self communings, and be a ladder by which yourthoughts may rise from your duties as a man of the world to your privileges as a spiritual being. It may wellbe that, even in this world, by rising above your material surroundings you may in a higher sphere attainwider perceptions and deeper insights. As our Secret Words also remind us that death must come to all sooner or later, and may come to any of ustoday, it is fitting that I refer to the Great Change. The Christian Faith teaches us that when a life here isended the body returns to the earth, and the Spirit to God who gave it. As the end approaches we become more and more conscious of the pattern which has made up our life, andit is well if we are able to realise that, despite error, life has been well spent. The man who has passed his life in selfish enjoyment and mortal sin is indeed to be pitied as he approacheshis last days and is not fortified for dissolution by the consciousness of good deeds done and the uplifting"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"grace of God’s love from which he has cut himself off. Let us ever strive to obey the Divine Commands and to love our neighbours as ourselves. And the body we live in should be respected and preserved in health so far as possible; we are placed hereto live our lives, not to destroy them. In life only can we learn from experience, and progress along the paththat leads to perfection. There is no progress to be made in the grave; so we must work while it is day, forthe night cometh when no man can work. Most Worthy Supreme Magus (or Right Worthy Inductor) my task is done and nothing remains but toexpress the hope that in due time our Very Worthy Frater may attain to the exalted Grade of AdeptusExemptus. The Conductor will now lead the Candidate to the Inductor, who will invest him with the Jewel of theGrade, and present him with a copy of the Ritual. Inductor rises and gives One knock; all rise. Ind.: Fratres, our duties being performed, I close this College of Adepti Maiores with the Mystic WordsMemento Mori and with Five and Two knocks. ***** **. Expositor and Conductor repeat knocks. ***** **. Conductor closes V.S.L. Inductor recites the Benediction. Ind.: Benedictus Dominus Deus noster per secula seculorum. Amen. Note: When in College the Adepti Maiores should wear the Rosicrucian Jewel suspended by a Yellowribbon upon which is the number VI and may wear the Golden Jewel of Adeptship upon which theadditional inscription ‘AD.MA VI’ has been engraved.Home"}]
