[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 Notes for the Theoricus Introduction The purpose of each Grade in the S.R.I.A. is to initiate the Frater into a new level of knowledge and also to introduce a further subject for him to study and into which to gain some insight. In the Zelator Grade, there were several traditions and areas of knowledge brought to the candidate's notice, for example the Kabbalah; the science and meaning of numbers and the Elements in Nature etc. In this, the second Grade, the significance of Colours and how man perceives them is presented as a topic for study, with the emphasis again being that this is only an introduction As in the former Grade, the focus is again on how this subject relates both to man and the universe in which he lives. However, the value of this new Grade depends entirely on how far the Frater pursues his own studies and remember that the unfolding of the primary colours themselves, as well as the increasing complexity of the colours holds many deeper meanings. The Solemn Engagement The candidate is asked to make a solemn engagement to attend the meetings of the College at least once a year. This was in fact one of the undertakings made by the original Fratres Rosae Crucis in the 16th century and this special and solemn undertaking is not to be taken lightly. The reason for this is to be found from a study of the founding of the original Fratres Rosae Crucis which is outlined in the Fama Fraternitatis where the reasons are explained. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 The Ancients The position of the four Ancients is similar to the position they occupied in the Second Part of the Zelator Grade, but their function in this Grade is different. The aspirant travels clockwise, as one would expect , and the journey can be appreciated at different levels. For example he progresses through the Elements; the Zodiac and through to the spiritual planes. The charge delivered by each Ancient has much to convey to the mind of the candidate, and each has a spiritual as well as a moral significance. These charges warrant careful reading and it is suggested that each one is used in turn for reflection and contemplation; because in this way they become more meaningful. The Cross which is carried during the ceremony is related to the Ancients in several ways and this too is worthy of much further study. The Lecture There is no need to go through in detail the Lecture on the Colours because it is straightforward. The Colours referred to here are the three primary; the four secondary or supplementary colours, and others which we perceive in nature and which we commonly use ourselves - such as black and white. All of them correspond in some way to ourselves and the world in which we live. For example we are all well aware of the phrase ‘seeing red’, and we will often refer to a person having a ‘blue period’. Some of these correlations are described in the lecture, but they need to be further explored with the assistance of reference works, such as an encyclopaedia. It is also of particular interest to see how various colours are used for their psychological impact; in our Masonic Orders, and also in ecclesiastical vestments etc. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 The Journey In the Grade of Zelator you passed into the Sephirah of Malkuth which is the 10th Sephirah on the Tree of Life. This Sephirah is concerned with this physical world. It is the final concretion or precipitation into matter of the Creative Divine Plan and as such it represents the whole Cosmos right down, even to the body of man which, as we are told in the Book of Genesis, was formed in the image of God. It is into this earthly world that we are born, “poor and penniless” and it is in this physical world that we first explore the reality of our five basic senses. We also learn to use and to look after our bodies and these basic skills have to be mastered before we are able to progress and recognise, and then to control the various instincts and passions that dominate and rule our lives. Malkuth (basic plans of the Tree of Life are on Pages 7&8) is the first regular step down the pathway of life. It is our first Degree because it is our Initiation and now you have just taken your second regular step on the path and this is the Foundation on which you build your life. In this 2nd Grade you advance to the 9th Sephirah, named Yesod which is called ‘The Foundation’. It is called the foundation of this physical world because it is the etheric framework and to give you an example, you might consider Yesod as the ‘scaffolding’ behind the scenery of a theatrical stage set. It is that frame, or form behind the physical, material and earthly shapes as we recognise them. One of the correspondences of Yesod is the Moon and thereby the personality. Just as Malkuth represents our body, so does Yesod represent our personality. Remember that what we show to the world is but a shadow of our true selves, just as the moon only imperfectly reflects the true light of the sun. It is only on the one day in its cycle that the moon show us its full true face; the rest of the time it projects its shadow side to the world. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Another very important correspondence of Yesod is with the patriarch ‘Jacob’. Jacob had a coat of many colours, but this was not referring to its patchwork quality, but to the fact that he had a coat of many personalities. This is not just a story about Joseph, it is also about ourselves. This is one reason why there is an emphasis on the subject of colours in this Grade. Remember that there is nothing in our rituals and teachings that should ever be taken at face value, there is a world of meaning to each and everything. As a passing thought consider Jacob’s coat and its many colours that allude to the various shades of our own personalities with which we clothe ourselves and remember the phrase “like father, like son”. Consider then the possibility that his 12 sons might also allude to a cycle of archetypal personalities -perhaps even to the 12 signs of the Zodiac or then again perhaps to the archetypes that Jung was familiar with, for after all, Jung was a Kabbalist. The History of the Fraternity Part 2 Christian Rosencreutz formed The Fraternity and thereby the root stock from which we are all sprung. At first there were only the four members, but they eventually finished the new building which was called 'Sancti Spiritus', or ‘The House of the Holy Spirit’. However because of the extent of this work, together with their writing; research and the healing for the many sick people who came to visit them, they were forced to increase their numbers. To this end our Father chose his cousin Bro.G.G.; Bro.B. who was a skilful painter; Bro.G. and lastly Bro.P.D. who was the secretary. All except for Bro.J.A. were German and all were bachelors who had vowed to remain celibate. Eventually these eight brethren so arranged things that they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to their passion of philosophy and magical works. Each thereby became so learned in the study of the secret and manifested philosophy that they decided to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 separate and to travel to widen even more their understanding and to test their wisdom so that if anyone found it to be lacking in any way, then it could be rectified. However, before they separated they all agreed to the following set of ideals and confirmed that they would practice them whenever possible:- I. None of them should profess anything, and should cure the sick gratis. 2. They should not be constrained to wear any kind ofhabit but to follow the custom of the country. 3. Every year on an appointed day they would meet at thehouse 'Sancti Spiritus' or write the cause of absence. 4. Every brother should look for a worthy person to succeed him. 5. The word R.C. should be their seal, mark and character. 6. The Fraternity should remain secret for 100 years. Five of the brethren then departed, but Bro,B. the painter and Bro.P.D. the Secretary, remained with Father C.R.C. for a year, after which they likewise departed after their annual meeting, but left there Bro.G.G. who was Bro.C.R.C.'s cousin and Bro.J.O., so that he always had two Fratres with him. Every year they assembled together and met with their accustomed fraternal fellowship and made a full report of what had been done and the wonders which God had showed them during their journeys there through the world. The first to die was Bro.J.C. in England. He was very learned in the Qabalah as his book \"H\" witnesses. He was spoken of as having cured a young Earl of Norfolk of leprosy. They had agreed that as far as possible their burying-place should be kept secret, and it is not known to us what has become of them, but each one's place was supplied by a fit successor."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 After the death of Bro.J.C. Father C.R.C. called the rest together and from what we can gather laid the plans for his grave. It is not known exactly when that loving Father died, but we do know something about the vault where he was laid to rest. A certain Bro.N.N., who was of the third generation of the fratres, decided that since 'Fortune' had smiled on him, then he would make some alterations to the building. This was in the year 1604. In so doing he came upon a brass memorial tablet containing all the names of the brethren, and some other few things, which he thought he would transfer to some more fitting vault. In this tablet was stuck a great nail and which on being drawn out brought with it a large stone out of a thinly plastered wall, which revealed a hidden door. Immediately he pulled down the rest of the wall and cleared the door, and upon the door he found some large writing which read:- POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO After I20 years I shall be open.\" and with the date.
