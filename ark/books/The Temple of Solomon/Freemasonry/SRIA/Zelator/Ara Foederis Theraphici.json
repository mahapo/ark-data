[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Ara Foederis Theraphici To the Reader, Whoever has doubts about the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, let him read this and having read the poem, he will be certain. ANNO CHRISTI 1617 Written by a Brother of this Fraternity first in Latin, then translated into German and printed by I.S.N.P. & Poet Laureate Printed at Neuenstadt by Johan Knuber 1618. To the very Noble, Powerful and Honourable Balthasar von Schkoelen, Senior Master of the Horse of the Elector Prince of Saxony. To the Honourable, Worshipful and Wise Ambrosius Becker, County Justice and Worshipful Mayor of Schkeunitz. To the Honourable, Respected and Art loving Michael Stemplin, a Noble Erudite and noted Spagyric Expert. To my high protectors and Young Lords, my Brother-in-law, and my trusty friends respectively, Luck, Blessing and Success. Noble and powerful young Lord, kind and beloved Brother-in-law, well known and trusty friend, to you I send greetings first and my service, after that I dedicate and write these presents, which from outward appearance looks a short, little work, yet according to its secret meaning and hidden contents it is a very weighty and far looking work, and of the goodness and truth of my heart. I trust they will receive and recognise it with a thankful mind and heart, read it with full attention, that they will think further over these matters, and wait with patience until something plainer, rounder, opener and more recognisable–as shall happen shortly, but then in Secret and in confidence–occurs. Recommending myself to them jointly or severally as theirs for any service Datum the 16th September Anno 1616. at your service Noble, Honourable, Powerful also Honourable, Worshipful and Wise Gentlemen.

Fratris Christiani Rosencreutz People live in doubt eveywhere"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"If the highly honoured Fraternity of the Rosy Cross exist in truth which men declare to be so virtuous And the Fama is made ridiculous here and there as if it were a fairy tale. The Fama I say declares one condition to the whole world. But whosoever likes to doubt matters clear as the Sun Is starblind at Midday No oculist can help him. Note this, attentive and pious reader, What I tell you in one word I am a branch selected from the Highborn fraternity I tell you without guile In Germany our order exists in truth Right in the heart of the German Lands. And note it well, well known in foreign parts. And although there are but few of us Until now, yet in these days And quite lately with pleasure The order has been extended By ten persons well known for their Understanding, honour, Art and virtue. The Order has also at this present time Been newly and well reconstrued With many bye laws and statutues Which give it order, measure and object. Could you see these, by your oath You would confess without hesitation That all and everything has been carefully Put into new form. There are many who without pause or rest Endeavour and tireless try to come to our order, but by the nature of the thing, one does not easily reach one's heart's desires. But many in their own mind cheat their own selves miserably. For our custom is of this kind that we elect those who are known to us for a long time before, And who are proved full many a year who are their own masters and free Of body not bound to anyone."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Many strict conditions are to be found Which bind the Fratres of our Order Which are to be kept without exception Throughout your whole life. As a fellow a true friend, (Such are a thin crop in these days), may possibly be taken on So soon as he shows within him that he is worthy of such friendship, And is free from guile and tricks. Listen, I will at this time Make round and clear yet another thing. A castle it is, a Castle fine Wherein the fraternal crown great in honour, rich in wonders has its lodging wonderfully. Which our father did erect And entrust to our fraternity and left it to them, as is known, Sancti Spiriti it has been called. But the length of time through many year Have however altered this name. In our documents, however, it remains The same as can be read therein. In this cloister we live, I tell thee Dressed all alike, Yet are we not bound down to the yoke of the Pope of Rome As in former times we were Enveloped with that ill treatment. Together with our well cared for acres We are surrounded by a green forest, A noble river quite clean Runs gently through our domain. Not far from us there exists A fine and farefamed City, Where we procure what we require At any time that we desire. In this place we live, believe me, in the enjoyment of freedom. The neighbours generally, round about Don't know who ever we can be, Many poor people daily and for ever Knock at our door desiring relief which we then send amply relieved away again."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Whoever is troubled with disease and those whom evil fevers plague, All seek their refuge with us Those are helped quickly and at once Wherefore the whole neighbourhood Is affected with loving kindness to us Loves and honours us, wishes us all good things And if a service can be rendered us it is done with joyous heart and willingly. What more then can we now desire There is no man who intends or dares to hurt us in our bodies or goods; What more should we therefore desire That we would like better. I nearly had told the place Where our order is concealed, But to tell that name now I have serious objections to. In order that we have knowledge And news of all things in the order So that everything shall be free And unconcealed from any of us, We travel through all lands Unknown, now here, now there. This is now my third voyage Which I have completed with zeal, Therefore have I rested a day finally in Hagenau. Because the rain without ceasing Has delayed me and the weather is wet Which has prevented me as aforesaid So that I could not get away. Scarcely shall I complete within the space of a year my voyage which is prescribed to me, And how many countries and people do remain Which I have to visit yet In a little time and without vexation. In the meantime it is not forgotten And is often done by me That I salute the order secretly By means of letters And communicate to them truthfully Many secret things frequently What I discover on my travels,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That they know very soon. And although we travel out and home Through foreign lands generally There is no host ever lived on earth Who received vexation and trouble One single time through us. We treat them well Pay for meat and meal and lodgings and what in such a case is fair and customary, Give them addition rich gifts; Wherefore as good friends We never are a burden to anybody. The elder brethren of this order Have come to this agreement That the younger brethren henceforward Shall allow themselves to be used for this purpose But that their knapsacks are filled With rich and ample provender, Until they have in proper manner Deserved for troubles suffered and true diligence Their rest in the future. And have deservedly earned That for the rest of their lives They may live in peace without troubles. We are anxiously desirous To study much more And daily to know much more Is our desire, wish and object If we find anything that is good anywhere Then we do it from that time Note it, and make note of it. Therefore nothing can happen In Germany at any time But we see it at once with our eyes. If any new books come out The Bookguide brings it to us at once, who is properly met for reward appointed to this office We treat honourably Manyfold Arts diligently With science, knowledge, art and handycraft We spend the rest of our time. So that we may never be idle And stand in anybody's light We exercise ourselves at all times In the foreign languages of many lands."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In Polish, Welsh, Spanish We all know how to talk In Italian and free Gallic And also in others whatsoever they may be (we can converse) There is no language throughout all lands Unknown to our Order. Nature is assiduously examined Experience is highly valued What anyone in the fraternity Has newly, through his brain power, Discovered and studied He submits quickly to the Fratres Who examine these matters at once And amply weigh and value them. We have in these times many things Which were invented by the Ancients Which we admit and experiment with And readily allow them to pass Which if rightly looked at Are hardly to be comprehended by human mind. At times also the inclination takes hold of me, When I can hardly help being idle, Idleness being a bad councellor So that I write Poetry, And in this enjoyment kill my time., Amongst us we maintain certainly The due regulations without murmuring Our spirits inward and outwardly learn In peace and flame of love, One mind, one soul, one sense, one heart, One will, one opinion, one pain Are dwelling in us, Unity is our delight and most beautiful ornament. Nobody knows anything but that forthwith The others know equally well Just as nobody owns anything particularly himself It is one heart, one sense, one council. Our worthy overseer Then calls us together At certain hours and orders freely One after the other regularly To refer in Mediem (to practically try) What he has learnt in studying. As soon as that happens We do not all omit"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"To consider the matter Now to argue pro et contra And what then is found correct Is entered at once into the Protocol (Minute Book) What is found false, as false is rejected. Thus do we always proceed There everybody begins to tell What he in all his days Has heard, read, meditated All is truly referred. Then for love of our posterity All this is immediately also Entered with care into a Book. What then pleases the Order The president (praesul) when it suits Knows how to use place, measure and time And sets a task now one or another That he do something and experiment (laborier) According as his known information (according to his ability) And qualification for the art Whom the Brethren altogether Counsel in many ways By (word of) mouth, with (helping) hand and good counsel With assistance, science, and actual help (physical assistance) A library there stands With many thousand beautiful books. No single trouble sorrowfull Is to be thought of in this world Which in the least could Trouble us anymore, nothing can be found That we should go short of here on earth God has given us plentifully With abundance what we lack No shortcomings are to be felt. On little do we live Well satisfied with some thing. Our bodies we cure According to nature properly. Therefore our health is good indeed And we live many a long year, Which creeps softly along like a tender rivulet Runs equally away on its course. If it is required and necessity demands That we require money or goods For honours sake or necessity requires Then it is splendidly everywhere"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"No dearth of Riches is here Of Power, pomp or reasonable adornment God give that every fellow Who hankers after temporary riches Knew thus to arrange matters in this world without guile or trick to do likewise when much honour would ensue to the fear of God And vice and shame would not be so plentiful in our fatherland. God be praised, innocently we have to be blamed by evil tongues about many things by false hearts who charge us With things which never came into our minds. What we began for the sake of the truth, That is explained in evil Therefore what we are charged with in evil We do not repay in evil But suffer patiently In our heart and peacefully He who accuses us of magic lately and without fear, and quite openly incriminated us and branded us with disgrace, That very pious man Does not himself know with whom he has to do. Truly he is in error absolutely And knows nothing at all about us. But this I don't at all deny But grant it readily with all my heart That we naturally in many things Bring many a miracle into effect About which many an ignorant man May easily give many a thought As in chemistry many indeed proceed Without measure or object No day ever elapses Which does not see something in his fire (in his crucible) If he thinks that all this is done And not without the Devil's help, O God he is deceived And is in eternal error. For it is our care always that we together in common promulgate the honour of God Throughout the world in every place Serve God purely with hand and mouth Out of pureness of soul from the bottom of our hearts"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Full of the fear of God is our life Whom we to honour it is our duty To our neighbour our services are Openly ready now and evermore What more do you want dear Christian (brother) Know that our College is an academy full of learning of God's word, what more do you want The time will yet arrive That it shall be hidden from no one In all this world what the power of God Has conceived by means of an order Amongst all people in every land. The value of our order is recognised Be it about high and weighty matters Which will call many to wonder greatly Whereof the stiffnecked world Shall be horror struck–as often declared, Out of our work it can be seen What benefit we have intended. We are not lazy bellies Who are only trained to eat and drink We are no useless world plague Who lay themselves out for idleness But all our leisure is full of labour here and there Which labour serves to benefit The common weal for all his good And serves to your praise Lord Jesus Christ my saviour. True it is and I cannot deny That many a false book is in print As if our society had published the same Which never came from us Nor would we dare to issue it. A pious honest good man Can soon distinguish about these Who rightly considers our Reputation (Famam) And carefully bears in mind its sense To say nothing about many an impudent clown Calls himself our Brother Whereas the unfortunate fool Widely differs from our Society Such a deceiver a short while ago"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Has been found out at Nuremberg Who, amongst the common people Disseminated very many lies Until by reason of the truth he was in a very few hours convicted That he was a scoundrel and annant thief Who did nothing but brought misery on land and people Therefore on the gallows as he deserved His body became the food for the rooks. In Augsburg also in the same way A landlouper was found out in flagrenti delictu And his back well paid for this And the broom on his back he carried Out of the town as a reward And both his ears were cut off the head Of the wicked clown as a reward. It serves them right all these fellows Who want to brag about the joint of meat Who have not tasted the Broth Such pay is proper for such tricks. Here it is well also to bear in mind, Unfairly we are often thought of, That we do not make ourselves known And call ourselves after our first father, But his name clearly do not discover publicly, Indeed those altogether do us an injustice in this case Who say freely and without concealment That our name be only a dream. You godless bumblebees do not err Your hive troubles us little Leave our Beehive undisturbed If you cannot please yourselves otherwise For your iniquity will be brought to light By us in a very short time Therefore do not lightly believe What lyingly is painted to you Without you like to be made a fool of And deceived by false appearances And tell me this without wicked guile That in our days the world throughout Is dressed in the feathers of Lady Fraud Deceit, falsehood and wicked tricks reign now and every instant we find many Landswindlers.

In order to avoid their jaws And look well after our affairs And that our order does not become the prey Of these unmannerly wolves We have always to be careful And not make ourselves too public. O holy and powerful God Save us from this wicked lot Cast down their godless impudence Keep our order in your protection If so be that you are pleased at this time with all our works, Turn away, turn away all our enemies Who have become wickedly wrath That they in no wise on us may Satisfy their great hatred Protect the pious, Lord Jesus Christ Who art the refuge of us all For it is our wish all together To be known pubicly To the world and the globe of the earth As God the best of witnesses knows Oh that this in a short while may happen, How great would be our delight But if without end or finish Yet many obstacles be found We think the best counsel to be To keep as we are for a little while longer But in such a way that meanwhile We certainly make many more friends Therefore we appeal to many a learned man in our writings With letters and by our own hands Although our names are not known, That is known to many a philosopher Many a chemist, many a Doctor"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Many a Reverend, many a worthy man Knows the sound of our trumpet.

I have almost gone too far Therefore that I do not not go beyond My object or say too much Or more than is permitted to me I will finish for this time And lay away my pen Go be with you, and fare thee well And now I beg kind permission WhatI have communicated to you this time If you do that and we get knowledge of you You will soon receive more.
