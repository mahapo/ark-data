Air cosmically signifies the Third or Mental Plane, the true home of the Soul. The Third Triangle is that of Water, with its apex corresponding to Cancer (Midnight). The watery element may be interpreted as a mental subdivision of the emotional psychic phase of con-sciousness. Water signifies the next-interior plane to the physi-cal. It is variously termed the Astral or Psychic plane—Hades the purgatorial zone. It is the plane from which all souls are born into physical bodies, and to which all return at death. In terms of consciousness it bears relation to the feelings, de-sires, appetites, passions and emotions, from the lowest and most animal, to the highest and most refined. It corresponds to the Astral or Kamic body which is the seat of these feelings. The Fourth Triangle that of Earth has its apex in Capricorn (Noon) This element carries with it the idea of vitality, action and doing, as distinct from feeling and thinking, and with refer-ence to man it means the physical body. Earth is the lowest and outermost of the elements and in terms of consciousness it implies mere existence, quite apart from self-consciousness, intellect, or emotion. The Black Central Circle symbolically represents the centre of the Earth upon which the Initiate or Aspirant stands with his arms extended to the North and South desiring to approach the Radiant East and rejoice in the Light of Perfection. Thus we see here symbolically displayed the foundations which the Creator had laid and the various agencies by which, and ways in which Nature works for the benefit of Mankind; all these laws and forces have been well and wisely ordained and established, and we all feel and experience their power. So it is well to bear in mind that these heavenly bodies, com-bined with the influence of the Four Elements, are everywhere equally near, and that nothing ever happens to us that we are not fitted to bear, though at the time it may be we are not fully able to comprehend the beneficence of the design. CLAVICULA ROSICRUCIANA No.1 =============== Explanation of the Rosicrucian Certificate and the Seal of the Supreme Magus with Kabbalistic Notes. By William Robert Woodman, M.D., IXº, Supreme Magus. ================ The Order is essentially a Christian Order, and its members are selected from among those who have already entered the Masonic Brotherhood, and who have learned the true meaning of squares, levels and perpendiculars; to such, a few brief words will suffice to explain the points in the Rosicrucian Certificate which may not be self-evident. The Seven Stars represent the seven lower Sephiroth from דסח (KHESED) to חובלמ (MALKOOTH) inclusive, and these are also equivalent to the seven planets and the seven angels governing them. Cassiel, Sachiel, Zamael, Michael, Anael, Raphael, and Gabriel, representing saturn, jupiter, Mars, Sol, venus, mercury, and Luna. The Crown of Glory is emblematical of the 1st Sephira the Crown דחב (KETHER), which represents the highest trinity of the Sephiroth, Macroprosopus the Father. This Trinity added to the preceding seven stars is ten, the number of the Sephiroth; but inasmuch as this Supernal Trinity is above all things, so it is partly concealed and partly manifest, and, therefore, is given under the symbol of the Crown. On the band is the word “Resurgum.” I.N.R.I. Are the English equivalents of the hebrew initials of the words חשבי חור רעכ םימ י (YAMMEEM, NOAR, ROOAKH, YEVAISHAUH), which mean Water, Fire, Air, and dry Land or Earth, in addition to their well-known meanings— 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum, Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur, Igne Natura Renovanda Tntegrat, Igne Natura Renovatur Integra The cross in the Lozenge is the jewel of the Order and contains a word in which you have been already instructed.

Microprosopus is the reflection of Macroprosopus, as is evi-dent from a reference to the Greek quoted above; see also Heb. 1., v. 3. The Zodiacal Signs, with the Sun in the centre, are emblems of the seasons and the great source of light and life to the system of the planets to which our Earth belongs, the Sun being the representative of the Great Omnipotent giving life, and light, and power, and heat, and motion to everything within its influ-ence. Circling round it is a word of Power—a word of power in four languages—Sanskrit, Hebrew, Greek and Latin. These signs and words with the Life giving Sun in the centre, are contained in a circle, within which are four greater trian-gles, which their intersections form a number of lesser trian-gles. 2 when in due time we return within that Perfect Circle, then and only then, shall we feel the true Glory of its radiance. The Cir-cle also expresses Limitation, and the Signs of Zodiac which are placed on the outer ring serve to indicate the various influ-ences which combine to press forward our Evolution. Under the influence of the Three Essential Qualities (or Gunas, as they are known in Hindu Philosophy) each part of the Zodiacal Circle becomes triple, or throws off two modifications of itself. This triplicity is symbolised by the Equilateral Triangle, the apex of which is placed on one of the four points of the Square, its base then, with the apex, divides the Circle into three equal parts and when four such triangles have been drawn, the Circle will have twelve equal divisions, which form the Twelve Houses and give the position of the Twelve Zodia-cal Signs. The first Triangle is that of Fire, with its apex in Aries (Sunrise). The element Fire implies impulse, vitality and energy. It also affords indications in general outline of personal appearance, character, fortune and health. Thus we find a fiery vital energy and impulse underlies it and acts through it in various forms of emotions and instinct, and in the average man may possibly typify something even much higher than these. Fire implies also all that is above and beyond air, both in matter, in planes and in consciousness. It stands for the energising all-permeating life of the Universe everywhere, and is the main-spring of Evolution and progress. It corresponds to the mental plane in general and to the next highest—the Spiritual or Bud-dhic plane—in particular. It indicates a state not yet evolved in humanity, one far above intellect and carrying with it Love and Understanding. This condition is expected to appear in the next or Jupiter period of the Great Septenary of the World's Evolution. To-day, in the average man, apart from its signifi-cance of Vital Energy, it seems to have a closer affinity with the state of Consciousness indicated by Water, than even those of Earth or Air. The Second Triangle is that of Air, with its apex in Libra (Sunset). This element is associated with various forms of in-tellect. The influence of the Airy Sign Libra is the most active and the most moveable; it separates and differentiates through 27"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of Vesta for Luna; the earth for the negative side of Venus; Vulcan for Mercury; Pluto for Mars; Uranus for Saturn; and Neptune for Jupiter. The use of these Secondary Planets is according to the plan adopted by some of the modern astrolo-gers and this scheme avoids an exact repetition of the sym-bols. The four corners of the Black Square which is here outlined are in contact with Four Zodiacal Signs related to the Ele-ments, viz., the Signs of Leo (Fire), Aquarius (Air), Scorpio (Water) and Taurus (Earth), and indicate their combined op-erative influence. This Square also represents the Sacred Cube by means of which the Ancient Magi were enabled to unlock the mysteries of the Macrocosm. As is well known, this figure also represents the Geometrical Square under which Pythagoras communicated the Ineffable Name of God to his chosen disciples. With regard to a symbology of the Signs of the Zodiac, some writers have assumed that:— Aries reflects the Energy and manifested Life of the Deity. Tau-rus. His peace and immutable Law. Gemini His Joy and Gladness. Cancer. His patience and long suffering. Leo. His Majesty and Glory. Virgo. His Purity and Holiness. Libra. His Beauty and Harmony. Scorpio. His Power and Justice.

His Transcendence, i.e., Unifying Love. Within the Circle of the Zodiac the groundwork is White, which colour being Synthetic, contains all colours within itself, in the same way as God contains within Himself all things in the So-lar System. The Circle being the most perfect Form, without beginning and without end, represents the Creative Principle, perfect in all its parts, attracting towards itself with a Threefold Potency, all those who are sufficiently evolved to feel its influence, and 26 The four triangles interlaced and crossing each other whose union gives twelve, are the four elements—Fire, Air, Earth and Water, each with the Triune form operating therein. The twenty-four Flames, waved and salient alternately, typify the equilibrium of positive and negative, the twenty-four Elders who surround the Throne. These are called in the Kabbalah the twenty-four Thrones of Wisdom, on this matter Solomon says (fragment of one of his Clavicules):— “Number, weight and measure determine the form of all things; Substance is one, and God createth it eternally.” “Happy is he who understandeth Letters and Numbers” “The Letters are from the Numbers, and the Numbers are from the Ideas, and the Ideas from the Forces, and the Forces from the Elohim. The synthesis of the Elohim is the Shêma (the Tetragrammaton הוהי). “ “The Shêma is one, its columns are two, its Power is three, its Form is four, its reflection gives eight יכדא הוהי (Tetragrammaton-Adonai) which multiplied by three giveth you twenty-four thrones of wisdom.” “Upon each throne reposeth a crown with three rays, each ray beareth a name, each name is an absolute idea. There are seventy two names upon the tweny four crowns of the Shêma.” And seventy-two is כע the secret name of the highest world, that, namely, of Atziloth, or Archetypal Form.

In the midst of this immensity, according to Zoroaster, is the First principle of all things, Ormuzd or Ahura Mazda, Who dif-fuses Himself everywhere, but it is there that he is manifested after a more glorious manner; around his Throne are an infinite number of Intelligencies and Powers of different orders and degrees, who carry out his mandates.

The Elements also refer to the Creation of the World as re-corded in the first Chapter of Genesis. And the Spirit of God, (symbolised by Fire) moved upon the face of the Waters, (Water) And God said, let there be a firma- ment in the midst of the Waters, (Air) Let the dry Land appear (Earth). According to the Kabalah, the fire and the Water represent the Abba and Aima, the Great father and Mother, into whom the ETERNAL ONE conforms himself before the Universe can subsist; for before this “the earth was formless and void” Tohu-ve-Bohu; and thus Chaos became Cosmos. This eternal con-junction of the great father and Mother is a “Tetragrammaton Elohim”; but is not “Ain Suph” for before this, He was the “Concealed of the Concealed” of the Kabalah; but when He manifested His latent potency, the Monad had become the Dyad, and the Triad then appeared; hence came the Trinity of all faiths. We find also in the First Part of that Fire is the ultimate and most prominent Element, and it is the beginning of the Tetra-grammaton; but in the Second Part we find that Water asserts itself, being the initial letter of I. N. R. I., represented in Hebrew by Iammin, thus mitigating as it were the Fire of the Father by the Water of the Mediatorial Son. We have in the first part in the east the red Pillar of the severity of the father God, and in the second Part as compensation, we have the blue Pillar of Mercy of the Son God in the west. The Earth represents the darkness of the Aspirant; the Water is baptism the exterior emblem of Regeneration; Air symbol-ises Divine Truth enlightening the Mind: and the Fire of human suffering opens the heart to seek the Love Divine.

The East and West arrangement of the Four Elements in the first Part may be taken to represent the pole which Moses set up and the winding path of the Aspirant round the Pillars is the serpent twined round the pole. (The simple Circumambulation, now in use in small halls, has replaced a more complex and symbolic path in and out between the Pillars, viewed as points in the course of the Sun along the Ecliptic). In the Second Part the arrangement of the Pillars is that of the Cube of the White Stone, which when opened out becomes the Cross.

MACGREGOR-MATHERS, IXº.J.S.M. ——————— In this Clavicula No. 2, is given a short explanation of the Symbolism of those Four important Officers of a College, open in the Zelator grade, who are named Ancients. They preside, in the first place, over the Elemental tests, by the symbolical passing through which alone, the candidate becomes entitled to kneel before the Altar of Light, and to join in the Mystic labours of the Order. It is necessary to consider them, however, in other aspects than as simply preparers of the ordeal of the candidate; and, firstly, what does the Name “Ancient” mean, and why is it applied to these officers? In the Hebrew Kabalah, the terms “Ancient,” “Ancient of the Ancient Ones,” “Ancient of Days,” etc., are titles applied to God in His innermost and most concealed forms; and the term “Ancient of Days” is used in several passages in the Bible. This term “Ancient of Days,” is said, Kabalistically, to refer to God before the Creation, and its meaning is “Ancient before (or anterior to) the Days of Creation”; which days of Creation, mentioned in Genesis, are of course not the simple day and night of this insignificant little solar system of ours, which is but a mere spot in the shoreless ocean of the Universe. The term “elders” (or Ancient Ones) is also used in the fourth chapter of the Apocalypse of St. John, describing the tweny-four thrones before the throne of the Majesty Divine. The word “Antient,” as used in the time of Shakespeare, meant a Banner-Bearer, or Ensign, or he who is worthy to bear the symbol under which 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"men go forth to war; and we shall see presently, of what and how important occult symbols our “Ancients” or “Antients” are the guardians. The Egyptian Royal Cartouche is, probably, the origin of the armorial bearings of heraldry, the hieroglyphics being the charges; and this cartouche borne upon a pole, formed a Banner or Symbol, whichever you like to call it. Now the seats of the Ancients in each point of our Zelator Grade, are pregnant with meaning. In the one they are arranged in a column, as in leading the Candidate from the West to the East. In the second point, however, as if they had then finished their office in this respect, they are placed at the Cardinal points, apparently to mark still further, yet in a secret manner, some particular relations of the arms of a cross to the aspirant, who stands in the centre of that cross, with his arms extended in the form of the same mystic symbol, and is made to say at the same time that he is then standing in the “centre of the Earth”; just as the Greeks were told that for them Delphi represented “ \u000f \u000f\u0011\u001c\f\u0018\u000f\t \r\u0012\t η\u0012\t . ̋ Also the four Ancents preside over the four elements of Air, Fire, Water and Earth; or as the teaching of Occultism would say, over Air, Fire, Water, and their Synthesis; and, therefore, are their robes of the 3 primary colours, one the flame red of fire, the second the blue of water, the third the luminous yellow of air, and that of the fourth is black, signifying the earth, and which colour is obtained by the mixture of the three others. But the Candidate is clad in the white robe, to point out to him that he should not be led aside by the attraction of the elements, but that he should steadfastly follow that path of spiritual purity which alone will lead him to the Divine light. 8 Symbol of water is the triangle pointing downwards. Then lastly we have the Red Pillar denoting the Active Element Fire, and on it in Green, its complementary colour, the Astro-logical Symbol of Leo the Lion, representative of the Fiery Trigon of Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; the Alchemical Symbol of Fire is an upright triangle. These Four Pillars thus represent the Four Elemental States and are capable of various symbolical interpretations. The reason for the Aspirant commencing his steps at the Black Pillar and ending his course with the red Pillar, is because he is supposed to be at first immersed in ignorance of divine things, and Black is the symbol of obscurity; travelling east for knowledge he comes eventually to the Red Pillar the Symbol of Light; the principal colour of which is Red. The arrangement of the Pillars also represents the Creation of Man. We are told in the book of Genesis of the Pentateuch of the Hebrews, that God formed Man of the dust of the ground—Earth; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life—air; and he became a living soul—water; and called his name Adam meaning Red, the colour of Fire. The sacred volumes also refer to man who was created from Earth, being regenerated through baptism of Water by the Holy Spirit of which the Symbols are Fire and Air, as we find nar-rated in the Acts of Apostles, when the Holy Ghost descended on the Day of Pentecost. The primary meaning of the arrangement of the Pillars, is how-ever, that representing I.H.V.H., Jehovah, the Tetragrammaton of the Jews and Gnostic Greeks; the Fire being the Yod, the Water the Heh, the Air the Vau, and the earth the final Heh of that mystic word. These also represent the Four Worlds of the Kabalah of the Hebrew rabbinic Theosophy; as follows:— Fire, for Atziluth the Abode of the Deity Water, for Briah the Angelic World Air, for Yetzirah the Formative World Earth, for Assiah the Material World In the Second Part of the Zelator Ceremony we have the Four Pillars removed from their previous position and we find them 21"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" CLAVICULA ROSICRUCIANA, No. V. ————————— Lecture on the religious Symbolism Of the Four Pillars. ———————— The Ritual of the Grade of Zelator provides much subject for thought, and although Clavicula No. 2 affords an explanation of an astrological character concerning The Four Ancients, yet there remains much religious symbolism which may be un-veiled. In the First Part of the Zelator Ceremony there are Four Col-oured Pillars in the Rosicrucian Temple, arranged from the West to the East representing the Four Elements, Earth, Air, Water and Fire, and they are coloured respectively Black, Yel-low, Blue and Red. Commencing at the West; where the Aspirant is first placed to undergo the trials prescribed by our Ritual we find the Black Pillar bearing a vessel containing Earth, Inscribed on the side of the Pillar we have the Astrological sign of Taurus the Bull, in White, which is the complementary colour to black; it is the principal member of the Earthly Astrological Trigon of Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus; the Alchemical Symbol of Earth is a re-versed triangle with a cross-bar. This Pillar represents the Pas-sive Element Earth. Proceeding Eastward, we have the Yellow Pillar, representa-tive of the Active element Air, with the Fan. Inscribed upon it in Violet is the Astrological Symbol of Aquarius; the most potent of the Aerial Trigon of Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; the Alchemical Symbol of Air is the upright Triangle with a cross-bar. Then we have next the Blue Pillar, Symbol of the Passive Ele-ment Water, with a vessel of Water upon it and the Astrological Symbol of Scorpio in Orange; it is the representative of the Watery Trigon of Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; the Alchemical 20  Now Astrology points out that the signs of the Zodiac partake of the nature of the elements, and that the four most important periods in the year are the respective entries of the Sun into 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the four signs of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, which are represented in the Hebrew Cherubim with the heads of the Bull. The Lion, the Eagle (for the eagle replaces the scorpion, unless the symbolism is intended to be of destructive nature), and the Man. For when the Sun enters the sign of the Bull, in April, he stirs up the earth to vegetation, and the Ancients said that this showed that the sign of the Bull especially had an Earthly operation. In the Lion, in July, the Fiery heat is most evident. In the Scorpion, in October, come the Water floods, and in Aquarius, in January, come the keen and biting Winds, of which the element Air is the type. Note that the aspirant is led, as it were backwards, up the seasons in his course past the Ancients, from West to East. But the Hebrew Rabbis said that the Divine name הוהי, IHVH rushes through the universe, for each letter presides over an element—Yod over Fire, Hé over Water, Vau over Air, and Hé over Earth, and that therefore he who could pronounce it aright would make both heaven and earth totter and quake, seeing that he would have used the creative word which called each element into being. I will, therefore, in conclusion, ask those who wear those mystical robes of the Ancients to remember what they signify separately and collectively; for it is not a light thing to represent materially the forces of the INEFFABLE NAME! 10  רתכ הניב המכח הרוכנ רסח הראפה חצנ רוה רוסי תוכלמ Diagram representing the TEN SEPHIROTH THE CROWN KETHER MALKUTH THE KINGDOM 19"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"18 be justly deemed the End and completion of the Baraisheeth, only waiting for the “restoration of all things” which we are all led to believe will not much longer be delayed by him who is the Great Architect of the Universe.

At what pe-riod of our history the theory of the Ten Sephiroth was pro-pounded we cannot discover, but we know that for many cen-turies this and other doctrines of a cognate character were handed down from father to son, and that Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, who lived in the reign of Titus, AD 70-80, is considered to have been the first to commit these to writing. Three important books of the “Zohar” or “Splendour”, which is the great storehouse of Kabalistic teaching, have been trans-lated into English, by S. L. Mathers; this and the Sepher Yetzirah, translated by Dr. Wynn Westcott, should be in every library. The former work speaks for itself, the latter is an exqui-site gem of Occult Science and is the oldest of the works of Rabbinic philosophy still extant. The Ten Sephiroth or Emanations of Divinity are as follows:- 1st Kether The Crown 2nd Chokmah Wisdom 3rd Binah Understanding 4th Chesed Mercy 5th Geburah Power 6th Tiphereth Beauty 7th Netzach Victory 8th Hod  Glory 9th Jesod Foundation 10th Malkuth The Kingdom 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" By means of a diagram these can be shown arranged so as to resemble the Lightning flash. Another arrangement is in the form of Three Pillars; that on the right, The Pillar of Mercy; that on the left, The Pillar of severity or Justice; and one in the middle, The Pillar of Mildness. Sometimes Kether is omitted from the Middle Pillar, making each of the Three Pillars of equal height, each containing three emanations only. The idea embodied in the Three Pillars is Mercy on the right and Severity on the left, these two equilibrated by the central one of Mildness. Extreme Mercy would be Weakness. Extreme Severity, Op-pression. These two are balanced by the Central Pillar of Mild-ness. We come now to a very interesting part of the subject, the con-nection of the Tetragrammaton, the Four lettered word now called Jehovah or Yahveh, with the Sephiroth. רתכ. KTHR, the Crown, is the Concealed Father, היהא, AHIH, Existence, Macroprosopus; to this emanation, the first, is allotted the extreme uppermost point of the י Yod, the point within a circle. To המכח, CHKMH, Wisdom, the Divine Manifested God Father is allotted י the Yod. To הניכ, BINH, Binah, Understanding, the Holy Spirit of God, is allotted ה the Hé, conjoined, הי is JAH. תדאפת, THPARTH, Tipareth, Beauty represents the Son of God, ךלמ the King, to Whom is allotted ו the Vau, V. Note, Aleph the central letter and Tau at beginning and end. This is the central Sun of the Sephiroth from which emanate the rays of Glory which illuminate these most mysterious words. The incarnate Word by which all things were created. “The Glory of the Father, the express image and reflection of his person.” Also Microprosopus, and it carries with it as its satellites the five nearest Sephiroth, viz.—Power, Mercy, Glory, Victory, Foundation. 12 ת TH, Tau the Ending == Omega, the Last. תישארב,BRASHITH, Beraisheeth. Happy is he who understandeth Letters and Numbers. The Letters are from the Numbers, and the Numbers are from the Ideas, and the Ideas from the Forces, and the Forces from the Elohim. The synthesis of the Elohim is the Shêma. The first few verses of the Volume of the Sacred Law treat of the earth as “without form and void, and darkness was upon the faces of the deep”. This is what we imagine to be the “nebulous period”. “And the Spirit of God moved upon the faces of the waters.” Here we imagine is the gradual development of form, extending probably over myriads of centuries, until it pleased Him to say “Sit Lux—et Lux Fuit”. Then was the earth approaching to form and shape and the luxuriant vegetation on its thin crust was subject to many a cataclysm, eruptions which from time to time burst through its crust submerging all on its surface and forming the coal fields so useful to man, when the time arrived for his creation, when the earth was ready to receive him, and when the gigantic beasts and reptiles had disappeared from its surface, and the steaming seething atmosphere had been in the lapse of ages rendered fit for the support of life as we now see inhabiting our beautiful planet—and a different and less luxuriant vegetation sprang up suited to their requirements. Then came man on this earth, accompanied by the creatures over which he was given to rule, and the vegetation which we now see around us. In our little essay on the word Baraisheeth and the mystic letters of which it is composed, which in so marked a manner indicate the Powers, Influence, and Forces displayed in Creation, we go back to a period when time, as we count it, had no existance. “In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the earth” the Beginning, the mysterious Beraisheeth took place innumerable millions of ages ago. By this word, carrying with it the idea not only of the Beginning but of the End, we arrive at the Creation of Man, after the perfecting of the Earth and rendering it a fit habitation for this the last and most finished work of the Divine being; this may 17"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"even at his entrance into our Order, to note the remarkable analogy, I may say similitude between the commencement of the more ancient volume and the commencement of the Gospel of S.John in the New Testament. In the Beginning, is the first word in both instances, and the word in the Hebrew from its peculiar construction points not only to the Beginning but also to the End, the finish or completion of the work begun. To the ordinary student this may not at first sight appear, but to the students of the Kabalah, to whom every letter has its meaning, the opportune occurrence of the א Aleph and the ת Tau, in the peculiar position they occupy in this most important word, must have a most striking and marked significance. God never begins anything that He does not finish, is the occult meaning of this wonderful word. Space will not permit me to pursue this theme much further, or I should discuss the meanings of the other letters forming part of the word “Beraisheeth”, ש Shin and י Yod, the former representing Fire, and by analogy-Light, and the latter being connected in the Sephiroth with the Wisdom of God “Chokmah”: note also the ר Resh which is the initial letter of Ruach, the Spirit of God moving and brooding upon the “faces of the deep”. All these letters allude to the Powers and Influences displayed in Creation, and it is not to chance that we must attribute the association of these letters to form this mysterious word “Beraisheeth”. ב Beth, the first letter of the word beraisheeth is a preposition meaning In. ר Resh, the initial letter of Ruach, “The Spirit of God moving upon the faces of the waters” at the Creation. א A, Aleph, the Beginning == Alpha, the First. ש SH, Shin, represents Fire, Light, Heat, etc., “Forces from Elohim” י I or Y, Yod, the first letter of the tetragrammaton, The Great Name is allotted in the Sephiroth to Chokmah, Wisdom, the Wisdom of God 16 To תוכלמ, MLKUTH, Malkuth, the kingdom is allotted the final ה Hé of the mystic word Tetragrammaton, now called Jehovah: this final Hé is the bride of the Microprosopus, and is the Church by analogy. We may now study the Sephiroth as grouped in Triads. The first or Supernal Triad consisting of the first three Sephiroth, kether, Chokmah, and Binah, with Kether as its apex. Then we come to the first reflected triad consisting of Chesed and Geburah with Tiphereth as its apex. That which is below is like that which is above. The Son is reflected from the Father. “He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also.” The second erect triad, consists of Netzach and Hod, with tiphereth as its apex. The second reflected Triad, consists of Netzach and Hod, with Yesod as its apex, or with Malkuth the Completion. The “Book of Concealed Mystery” is the book of “Equilibrium” which is that harmony which results from an analogy of contraries, it is the dead centre where the opposition of opposing forces being equal in strength, rest succeeds motion. It is the central point. It is the “point within a circle” of ancient symbolism. It is the living synthesis of counter-balanced power. This form may be decribed as the equilibrium of light and shade, take away either portion and form is viewless. The term balance is applied to the two opposite natures in each Triad of the Sephiroth, their equalibrium forming the third Sehira in each Ternary. This doctrine of equilibrium and balance “is a fundamental Kabbalistic idea”, as is clearly shewn by Mathers, at page 16 of the Introduction to his translation of the “Kabala Denudata”. In each of the three Trinities or Triads of the Sephiroth is a duad of opposite sexes, and a uniting intelligence which is the result. In this the masculine and feminine potencies are regarded as the two scales of the balance, and the uniting Sephira as the beam which joins them. The term balance may be said to symbolize the Triune, Trinity in Unity, and the Unity represented by the central point of the beam. In the Sephiroth there is a Triple Trinity, the Upper, Lower, and Middle. The supernal or highest is represented by the crown Kether, the 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Unity represented by the central point of the beam.

Thus far we have but entered on a subject which is always most inter-esting to the Rosicrucian Student, and to which the attention of the Zelator was directed in “Clavicula Rosicruciana”, No. 1, when the Three Sephirotic Pillars were alluded to, as symbol-ised by the three Egyptian Obelisks on the parchment certifi-cate presented to each initiated Zelator. ———————————————— The accompanying diagrams are supplied by Dr. Wm.

Beraisheeth—In the Beginning— This is the first word of that Book which is called the “Volume of the Sacred Law”, revered alike by Jew and Christian. There is a peculiarity, I might call it a weirdness in the construction of the word itself, the first portion or half of the word terminates in א Aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, the second half ends in חTau, which is the last letter of that alphabet, corresponding with the Α Alpha and Ώ Omega of the Greek Alphabet, used to represent the beginning and the End, the First and the Last, the especial attributes of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, The Word— “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending saith the Lord, which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty.”—Rev.I.,8, and “\u001d\t \u0014\u0015\u001e\u0012 \u0012\t \u000f \u0018\u000f\u0007\u0001\u0006, \f\u0014\u0005 \u000f \u0018\u000f\u0007\u0001\u0006 \u0012\u0015\u000f\u0006 \r\u000f\t \u0017\u0004\u000f\t, \f\u0014\u0005 \u0017\u0004\u000f\u0006 \u0012\t \u000f \u0018\u000f\u0007\u0001\u0006. \u001f \r\u0001\u0006 \u0012\t \u000e\t \u0016\u0015\u001e\u0012 \u0013\u0015\u000f\u0006 \r\u000f\t !\u0004\u000f\t. &c. “In the Beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made, in him was life and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprhendeth it not.”—S.John I.,1 to 5. I havequoted these verses, so well known to the Rosicrucian 15"}]
