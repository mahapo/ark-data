The Freemasonry of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis -Misraïm, a humanitarian, philosophical, initiatic and spiritual institution, has for its essential basis the belief in a Supreme Power expressed and invoked under the name of THE GRAND ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSEorTHE SUBLIME ARCHITECT OF ALL WORLDS2.\tIt imposes no limits on the free search for TRUTH, and guarantees this liberty to all who follow the path. 3. It requires the tolerance of all members. 4. Freemasonry reminds all its members to respect the laws of the Country in which they live and considers the obligation to work within the Craft im­perative. 5. Masonry is a association of independent men and women, free and of good morals, listening to the voice of their own conscience, which compels them to put into practice an ideal of peace, love and fraternity. 6. Masonry has for its aim the moral and spiritual perfection of humanity and for its means the propagation of a true philanthropy, by the use of symbolic and esoteric forms, which can be revealed and explained only by the Initia­tion. 7. Its object is the application of the Royal Art - fashioning the initiated by subtracting all domination and making them free and sovereign masters of themselves, thinking independently, unfettered by the tyranny of reigning prejudices, having shaken the yoke of their passions and becoming fully con­scious of their responsibilities. 8. Masonry, foreign to all sectarian influence, imposes on all its members the respect of the opinions of others, in order to constitute a permanent center of fraternal union where reigns a perfect harmony of thought. 9. The International Order of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis -Misraïm admits women in absolute equality with men (identical Rituals and identical grades); and charters men’s and women’s lodges, but also charters mixed gender lodges.

Freemasonry is a school of freedom where the thoughts and conscience of each member may be freely expressed. The Freemason seeks to avoid instability and psychomental disorders that characterize the ordinary person because the ultimate goal of the Order is personal reintegration into the State of Original Perfection. By the teachings, each person must discover this by themselves; even though it is an integral part of the development in the Masonic search for Truth. No one can take the place of the individual in discovering the Truth. This method is perhaps what most distinguishes Freemasonry from other initiatory societies because it does not impose any ready-made ethics, teach any particular belief or contain any global truth. It refuses the comfort of the truth of others. Neither does it impose any restrictions on the search for Truth, rather it enhances one's possibilities by creating a place outside of the daily routine where rituals and symbols encourage inner reflection. In this way, Masons have the freedom to present works touching on the highest philosophical, moral and metaphysical issues and to discuss them in an atmosphere of openness and nobility and great tolerance, the very basis of all spiritual development.

A group of Socinians (an anti-trinitary Protestant sect) asked a patent of constitution from Cagliostro who was then in Trieste (he came to Venice and stayed for six weeks). They did not want to participate in his Magical-Kabbalistic rituals, so they chose to work at the Templar Rite. So Cagliostro conferredtheir only Masonic Light. He had the first three Degrees of English Freemasonry and the higher Degrees from Germany, which was greatlyinfluenced by the Templar tradition. The name of Misraïm is the plural form of Egyptian, which is the only reminder of this Egyptian Rite which gave their obediential personality. It spread rapidly to Milan, Genoa, Naples, and appeared in France with Michel Bedarride who had received the Grand Mastery (ultimate powers) in 1810, in Naples, from B... DeLasalle. From 1810 to 1813, the three Bedarride brothers successfully developed the Rite in France, almost under the protection of The Scottish Rite. Indeed, it had illustrious Masons at its helm: the Count of Muraire, Sovereign Grand Commander of The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; the Duke Decazeo, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Leicester, the Lieutenant General Baron Teste, etc...During the White Terror, Misraïm quickly became the Masonic Obedience which transmitted the required Third Degree to the Carbonari, and this group then had 22 Lodges in Paris, 6 in Lyon, 6 in Metz, 5 in Toulouse, 3 in Bordeaux, 3 in Geneva, 3 in Lausanne, and 1 in Courtray. The police of the restauration obtained its dissolution because it was fiercely anticlerical and anti-royalist. After being clandestine for 18 years, it was restored in 1838 and dissolved once more in 1841. Again brought out of the underground in 1848, Misraïm evolved towards its merger with the Rite of Memphis in 1881, which was the realization of Garibaldi.THE RITE OF MEMPHISMost of the members who accompanied Bonaparte on the Mission in Egypt were Masons belonging to the old initiatic Rites: Philaletes, African Brothers, the Primitive Rite, and all were Masons of the Grand Orient of France. Having discovered in Cairo a Gnostic-Hermetic survival, and in Lebanon the Druse-Masonry that Gerard de Nerval had also met, and which dated back to the operative Masonry which had accompanied their protectors, the Templars, the Brothers of the Mission in Egypt decided to renounce the Masonic affiliation which had come from the Grand Lodge of England and to start again with a new Rite that would owe nothing to England, who was then the number one enemy. And thus was born the Rite of Memphis in 1815, in Montauban, under the direction of Samuel Harris and Marconis de Negre.HISTORY OF THE RITEOFMEMPHIS -MISRAIMHistorically, this Masonic Obedience, that celebrated its bi­centennial in 1988, originated when the two rites of Memphis and Misraïm were merged in 1881 by Garibaldi, who became its first Grand Master. The Rite of Misra ïm had been founded in Venice in 1788. Its filiation came through Cagliostro who had entrusted it with the lower (first) Degrees of The Grand Lodge of England and the higher Degrees of German Templar Masonry.

The Rite of Misraïm had been founded in Venice in 1788. Its filiation came through Cagliostro who had entrusted it with the lower (first) Degrees of The Grand Lodge of England and the higher Degrees of German Templar Masonry.

A group of Socinians (an anti-trinitary Protestant sect) asked a patent of constitution from Cagliostro who was then in Trieste (he came to Venice and stayed for six weeks). They did not want to participate in his Magical-Kabbalistic rituals, so they chose to work at the Templar Rite. So Cagliostro conferred their only Masonic Light. He had the first three Degrees of English Freemasonry and the higher Degrees from Germany, which was greatly influenced by the Templar tradition. The name of Misraïm is the plural form of Egyptian, which is the only reminder of this Egyptian Rite which gave their obediential personality. It spread rapidly to Milan, Genoa, Naples, and appeared in France with Michel Bedarride who had received the Grand Mastery (ultimate powers) in 1810, in Naples, from B... DeLasalle. From 1810 to 1813, the three Bedarride brothers successfully developed the Rite in France, almost under the protection of The Scottish Rite. Indeed, it had illustrious Masons at its helm: the Count of Muraire, Sovereign Grand Commander of The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; the Duke Decazeo, the Duke of Saxe -Weimar, the Duke of Leicester, the Lieutenant General Baron Teste, etc... During the White Terror, Misraïm quickly became the Masonic Obedience which transmitted the required Third Degree to the Carbonari, and this group then had 22 Lodges in Paris, 6 in Lyon, 6 in Metz, 5 in Toulouse, 3 in Bordeaux, 3 in Geneva, 3 in Lausanne, and 1 in Courtray. The police of the restauration obtained its dissolution because it was fiercely anticlerical and anti-royalist. After being clandestine for 18 years, it was restored in 1838 and dissolved once more in 1841. Again brought out of the underground in 1848, Misraïm evolved towards its merger with the Rite of Memphis in 1881, which was the realization of Garibaldi. THE RITE OF MEMPHIS Most of the members who accompanied Bonaparte on the Mission in Egypt were Masons belonging to the old initiatic Rites: Philaletes, African Brothers, the Primitive Rite, and all were Masons of the Grand Orient of France. Having discovered in Cairo a Gnostic-Hermetic survival, and in Lebanon the Druse-Masonry that Gerard de Nerval had also met, and which dated back to the operative Masonry which had accompanied their protectors, the Templars, the Brothers of the Mission in Egypt decided to renounce the Masonic affiliation which had come from the Grand Lodge of England and to start again with a new Rite that would owe nothing to England, who was then the number one enemy. And thus was born the Rite of Memphis in 1815, in Montauban, under the direction of Samuel Harris and Marconis de Negre."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Memphis-Misraïm higher Degree Workshops must work: the 4th Degree (Secret Master), the 9th Degree (Master Elect of Nine), the 13th Degree (Royal Arch), the 14th Degree (Grand Elect of the Sacred Vault), the 18th degree (Knight Rose-Croix), the 28th Degree (Knight of the Sun), the 30th Degree (Knight Kadosh), the 32nd Degree (Prince of the Royal Secret), and the 33rd Degree (Sovereign Grand Inspector General).

But the Grand Orient was then monarchist in its majority, its seal was comprised of the Fleur-de-Lis, and it succeeded in obtaining the dissolution of Memphis.

In the symbolic plan, which constitutes a method of perfection, the Mason must trim the \"Rough Ashlar,\" which means, symbolically, to remove little by little the being of his imperfections thus permitting himself to pro-gress toward Knowledge. The Initiation orientates him on the path, it will be the developer. All Masonry is thus in essence, initiatic, and the Light given to the profane is the same whatever the Obedience where it is diffused. It is only in the development of this Light that the different sensitivities will define them-selves. The principal specificities of the Order Memphis-Misraïm reside in the following principles: - to vivify the Tradition transmitted by Ancient Egypt;- to develop the spiritual value of the initiatic quest;- to inspire an opening whereby intelligence of the heart and esoteric knowledge harmonize in our time;- to practice a Rite that permits man to find the way to his own interior realization.
