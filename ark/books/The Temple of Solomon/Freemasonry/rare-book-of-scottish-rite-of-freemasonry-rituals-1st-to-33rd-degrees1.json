The god of the temples of freemasonry is Lucifer. Make no mistake about it, if you don't know Lucifer or Satan is the god of freemassonry, you have been DECEIVED. You will find in this report The Ritual. Most masons do not know of, or deny its existance. It was recently found in the Rare Books Room of Pattee Library at The Pennsylvania State University. Indeed it is an authentic copy of the ritual book. Most masons are told it does not exist, The Book of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. This is the actual ritual. Not some quotes from an anti-Mason book, but significant parts of the actual ritual book. It is no wonder that these secrets of the \"craft\" and luciferian initiations are kept from, not only the public, but its own members. It is now revealed. Alleluia Yeshua! Most Freemassons are deceived regarding the truth that freemasonry is a religion of Lucifer. Any \"Christian\" who is a freemason, must come out it, renounce it, and repent of it, or he will be damned. Do you \"Christian freemasons\" think that God Almighty will tolerate members of Lucifer's Lodge? Freemasonry, intentionally misleads and deceives its low level initiates of the Blue Lodge. Does that sound like the work of the True God or a false god? How will you stand before God Almighty as a member of Lucifer's Lodge? The amazing speed with which the church has gone into total apostacy is understandable. When one sees the list of high level freemasons and their positions of power and influence in in apostate churchianity, the speed and extent of the apostacy is understandable. Almost all \"Christian\" TV and radio personalities have taken the luciferian initiations of high level freemasonry. R.G. Stair is a notable exception, as a radio personality who has had the courage to expose the luciferian religion of freemasonry. Most try to keep it hushed; however, the positions of power and influence in the church are in the hands of men who have taken luciferian initiations. In the \"Christian\" seminaries, colleges, universities, TV, radio, and in almost all the large chruch organizations, one will find high level freemason luciferians in control. That is how quickly another gospel has been spread. Most are too proud to recant or remitt. They would rather deny or threaten those who expose their high level fremasonry membership. Why not just publiclly renounce fremasonry? Here are some prominent names. Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagan, Paul (TBN) Crouch, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Norman Vincent Peale, Robert Schuller, Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrahkan and many others. Almost the entire \"Word - Faith,\" \"name it and claim it,\" apostate \"gospel of prosperity\", is the product of luciferian freemasons. Jesus is the only God who is not welcome in the Lodge. Jesus told us that in the last days many would come in His name saying, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and shall deceive many. The True God is the only god that is excluded from freemasonry. Do you see why the ecumenical movements such as Promise Keepers, the Global Ethic, and other easy believism, \"doctrine divides love unites\" movements, are so entheusastically supported by the \"Christian freemasons.\" The great \"falling away\" is often, falsely so called, the rapture.

The great apostacy is here. \"Christian freemasons\" have been at the controls of the larger Christian organiations and have greatly facilitated and accellerated the great falling away from the truth. Freemasons, need to hear this! Lucifer, the god of this world, the god of freemasonry, is a defeated foe although now enjoying his final greatest hour of stealing, killing, and destroying. His followers will join him in hell. Withdraw thyself or be damned. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. Gal 1:8-9 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. 1Tim 6:3-5 Albert Pike is considered American Freemasonry's most eminent philosopher. Some of Albert Pike's most revealing comments, given only to those taking the Luciferian initiations of the 30, 31, and 32nd degrees, are denied by freemassons. Fremasons are taught that Taxil fabricated the most infamous Pike quote 3 years after Pike's death. However, Anton Chaitkin, speaking for the Schiller Institute, tells us that the infamous Pike quote is available in French and English in the Albert Pike vertical file at the library of the Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction at 1733 16th St. NW, Washington D.C. Because freemasons are taught the Taxil explanation, several references are given for these most revealing infamous statements of Albert Pike. Only 5% of 32nd and higher degree freemasons are invited into the Illuminati. Many \"Christians freemasons\" would contend that freemassonry is not a religion. The plan of freemassonry is that the majority of freemasons do not even know it is a religion. The plan of freemasonry is to deceive the majority of freemasons from the truth that Lucifer, or Satan, is the god of freemasonry. The only god who will not be found in the temples of freemassonry is the One True God, Yeshua Messiah, Jesus Christ. You will not be praying in the name of Yeshua, or Jesus, in the Lodge. Albert Pike wrote the \"Morals and Dogma\" of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Freemasonry. Some of the words of this greatest sage of Freemasonry should put Freemasonry in perspective. On page 819 you will find just one example of why there are many people in Freemasonry who believe that it is natural to be a Christian and a Mason. \"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them.\" Freemasonry intentionally misleads the low degree initiates and hides the truth that the god of Freemasonry is Lucifer, except to those in the 30th and higher degrees."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The designed Luciferian deception of Freemasonry intentionally misleads the lower degree initiates away from the truth that the god of Freemasonry is Lucifer. I know of 3 masons of the 32nd degree who have fully renounced Lucifer's religion of Freemasonry and have been redeemed and now serve the True God and honor the name of Yeshua (Jesus). I have 2 very dear friends who will not renounce Freemasonry. One has ministered the gospel for 40 years. Please pray for them and all Masons to know that the Truth that Yeshua (Jesus) is the only way to God and that Lucifer's religion of Freemasonry is a sure way to hell. The following is the infamous quote of Albert Pike. If you still believe the Taxil deception spread within freemasonry, then check out page 321, of the 1942 edition, of Albert Pike's \"Morals and Dogma\". \"That which we must say to the crowd is -- We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. \"To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees -- The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine.\"If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay (The God of the Christians) whose deeds prove his cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and his priests, calumniate him? \"Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive. \" \"Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.\" (Instructions to the 23 Supreme Councils of the World, Albert Pike, Grand Commander, Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry, July 14, 1889.

One of the most recent churches to join with the Holiness Churchs, Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Assemblies of God, Church of the Nazarene, Chritian Reform Church, and others, in publically declaring the Antichrist true nature of freemasonry is the Christian Missionary Alliance Church. The entire Sermon of Pastor David Janssen follows. The reason this is so special is because that in their research, in the Rare Books Room of Pattee Library at The Pennsylvania State University, they located a copy of the ritual book, The Book of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. It will be referenced as \"the Ritual,\" or \"Ritual.\" Many who have tried to find the truth regarding Freemasonry have sought such a book. I would encourage you to take the time to review this in its entirety if you really want to know the truth. There are many strong delusions today. In truth, there may not be any such thing as a \"Christian Freemason.\" The truth is that these are mutually exclusive terms. A Sermon on the Rituals of Freemasonry, by Pastor David S. Janssen State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, 1606 Norma Street, State College, Pennsylvania, 16801 Introduction from a Prepared statement, delivered by an Elder This morning's sermon addresses the subject of Freemasonry. The response it recommends reflects two years of prayerful study by the Board of Elders. After this lengthy deliberation and consultation with Christian brothers who either are or have been Freemasonry participants, we have concluded that intentional or inadvertent involvement in Freemasonry places Christians in a spiritually compromised situation. While Masons deny their secret society is a religion, it nevertheless involves a spiritual fellowship of men who, though they often praise God and accord the Bible a place of public honor, historically commit themselves to an unBiblical system of thought and practice. Out of concern for our brothers who are Masons and for our congregation as a whole, the Board of Elders has asked the Pastor to speak on Freemasonry this morning. The Governing Board has endorsed our unanimous decision to take up this subject and offer the consequent recommendations. What is at stake is the issue of spiritual fellowship. As you will see, the ideas and practices of Freemasonry are inconsistent with a commitment to Biblical Christianity. Put bluntly, the fellowship of Freemasonry is inconsistent with the fellowship of Jesus Christ. In light of the fact that the Scripture (Ephesians 5: 11) teaches us to have \"no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,\" the Elders and Pastoral staff have chosen to inform the congregation about the nature of Freemasonry, and to initiate actions described at the conclusion of this morning's sermon. As a full Board of Elders, we have come to our understanding only within the last two years, and we regret our failure to inform ourselves on the situation earlier. To the extent our tardiness has harmed anyone in the congregation, we ask forgiveness. We trust you will understand that in taking these actions we hope to protect rather than"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"punish our sheep. Out of concern for the flock we encourage our brothers who are Masons to leave Freemasonry and, just as important, we warn our young men against joining that fellowship. [This discussion is a compilation of three sermons on the \"Rituals of Freemasonry\" delivered by Pastor Janssen, on Sunday, September 28, 1997. The sermons includes slides  Pastor  Janssen  described.]  The Elders are represented here as spiritual leaders and overseers of the flock. Not a single Elder, not a single Governing Board Member, neither a Pastor nor a Pastor's wife differs on this issue we talk about this morning. The elected leadership of our Church comes to you this morning in unity on this teaching document. Freemasonry and its conflict with the Gospel of Jesus ChristLet me begin by reading the Word of God from Deuteronomy, Chapter 13, verses 6 to 8. The Bible reads, If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: God takes a dim view of other deities in association with His-Name or Being, which is why the Elders share with you today their concerns about the association of Freemasonry with these other gods. The Father has told us to avoid the worship of other gods, whether they be from Egypt, Canaan, or wherever. Many of these deities, as you will see, are associated with the Ritual of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Pastoral PrayerGod, today we come to you and worship you in the name of Jesus. You are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We know You by the name Jehovah and we want to thank you Father for your son Jesus, for the atonement that He provided and for the power of the Holy Spirit that is resident in this place. We bind any other spirit in the name of Jesus that it cannot speak, that it cannot be boisterous, and that all shall be done for your glory alone. Father we thank you today for your presence and for your Glory. We thank you Lord for your Word. You call us to be obedient to Your Word. And this morning, God, we give you this that all of us may learn more about your Holy Spirit and learn more about your Word and your path for our lives. Father, this morning we tend to matters important to you. We ask that your Holy Spirit may enlighten our eyes that we may understand how you would have us to walk. We ask this in the name of Jesus our Lord and our Savior. Amen. As one travels through the United States, and in particular Pennsylvania, one may find along the highways a certain blue or red sign welcoming visitors to the Lodge. We recognize and affirm that it is the right of us all to become associated wherever we want and with whatever we want to be involved in. Together, we appreciate and cherish this"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"basic constitutional freedom. We are concerned, however, with the fact that as a Board of Elders and Governing Board, we have come to the conclusion that the goals and teachings of this organization, that is Freemasonry, conflict with the purposes and the Bylaws of The State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, and we are vested with the responsibility under God and our church Bylaws to share our concerns with you. Please understand that the Board of Elders has been careful to confer with those Masons associated with our church and that much of this material has already been shared with them, in one way or another. In love and patience we have sustained this dialogue for two years. This teaching today is for the broader congregation. Freemasonry, in the Scottish Rite, believes and states in its own publications that one out of every five adults in the United States comes under its influence. Twenty percent of us- through an uncle, a father, a grandfather, a brother, or perhaps even our membership - has experienced the influence of Freemasonry in our lives. Our concern is less with the individual uncle or the grandfather or other relative than with the Freemasonry organization. We believe this organization runs contrary to the purposes of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and our Church Bylaws, and in that voice we speak today. More specifically, we focus on the relationship of Freemasonry to our local church. Our call is not to hurt people. Our concern is not with individuals, but with an organization we believe violates Deuteronomy 13:6-8 and therefore threatens to compromise Christians. Some of the information you see and hear today may be new to you. Elders are charged with the responsibility of caring for our souls The Elders before you here today are charged with caring for our souls. Some may wonder why these men have come and why they undertook a two year search on this topic. Might they have been spending their time better on other matters? But recall the Elders are charged with the responsibility of a number of important tasks according to the Word of God and judge whether this study matches their responsibilities according to First Peter, Chapter Five. Called to shepherd the flock of GodThe Elders are called to shepherd the flock of God. Peter's letter tells us that as under shepherds, the Elders are to be concerned with how the Flock is spiritually - its overall condition. When the sheep are in danger, the Elders have a moral obligation to express their concerns. Called to oversee in the bodyThe Elders are called to oversee in the body - \"to see over the body\" - and make sure the body is spiritually healthy. So today, they come in unanimity out of their concern for the sheep. In other words, they have been elected by you to be actual overseers gaining a perspective on the body of Christ to make sure the sheep walk in the paths of righteousness, their journey leading homeward toward the Good Shepherd, Jesus. Will give an account of their commitmentThe Elders will give an account of their commitment. If they fail, they must answer for it to God. They must also answer to God if they are too strict. As you can see, these individuals face a challenging job! Sometimes they lack encouragement, and my word to you is to encourage them. Must meet spiritual conditions"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Elders must meet spiritual conditions as outlined in Second Timothy and Titus. These individuals before you have met those spiritual requirements or standards through the nominating committee and through the church elections of recent years. We have seen these individuals in their walk, meet the qualifications to lead us. The Elders are, therefore, in a position to share their studies and insights as is their moral and Biblical obligation. Have been elected by you as ones deemed spiritually responsible You have elected your Elders as the ones you deem spiritually responsible. Your election transcended the routine political choices between Republicans and Democrats. You have elected these individuals over the years to serve you, to help shepherd you and to care for your souls. It is in that capacity they come to you today. We are called to discern the Spirit of Truth from the Spirit of ErrorWe are all called, as first John tells us, \"to discern the spirit of truth from the spirit of error.\" We know that in our world there exists a Spirit of Truth and that is the Holy Spirit, but first John goes on to describe a Spirit of Error. Every single one of us throughout life must remain aware of the difference between the two and base our convictions on that difference between truth and dangerous error. This counterfeiting spirit goes throughout the world trying to mask the way and the plan of God. Notice, for a moment, how that spirit manifests itself: Eph 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. First the Bible says, \"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness but expose them.\" What does God want us to do when we find behaviors associated with darkness? We are to expose them. Is this something an Elder Board should do? Yes. Not people, mind you, but the fruitless deeds of darkness. The fifth chapter of Ephesians calls us not to cover these \"fruitless deeds of darkness\" with thoughts of love, but to expose them. 2 Cor 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; Second, we are called to demolish arguments. It is a solemn call of God through Paul to \"demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.\" So where we find something pretending to be the church, something pretending to be Christ, something pretending to take people to heaven, whatever it may be, if it is not of God, Paul considered it his obligation to challenge these arguments and pretensions. Why? To demolish their ability to counterfeit Christ. 1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Dear friends do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see if they are from God. \"Do not believe every spirit\"--that word has gone out into the world. It is what First John still tells us. Test the spirits to see if they are from God, or from somewhere else. How often in our lives do we fail to test the spirits involved in what we read, what we do, what we may or may not ascribe or belong to? We have that individual responsibility as men and women, as boys and girls to test these spirits throughout our journey. We believe in unanimity that this is exactly what we do this morning."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The spirit of falsehood manifests itself in different ways The spirit of falsehood or error, manifests itself in different ways. To be aware of the different ways, we can examine a few of them: A different gospel Obviously a \"different gospel\" exists. We read in the Galatians of just such a different gospel. When works are added to grace, or faith and works become mixed, it is the spirit of falsehood, called in the scriptures a different gospel. There are other falsehoods. Admixtures of truth and errorAdmixtures of other kinds can be just as dangerous. In fact admixtures of truth and error can be the most volatile and sinister of falsehoods, tending to blind people to the pure truth beyond the amalgam. Admixtures can also be the most difficult falsehood to discern with elements of truth masking the error. A mixture of truth and error may look truthful enough for one to believe the error cannot really be error. We find a complete falsehood somewhat more obvious. A mixture of truth and error takes wing in the spirit of falsehood, and it is also a different Gospel. False religions past and presentFalse religions are clearly within the spirit of falsehood. Whether past religions or present religions, they are composed by humans rather than God. These religions are not merely the musings of a culture, but spring from the spirit of error and falsehood. Man's attempt to present his own good works to God generally account for the approach human religions take. False religions whether past or present represent the spirit of error. CultsCultic organizations also represent the spirit of falsehood. We know cultic behavior separates people by moving them into secret organizations with secret information others cannot share. Cults indoctrinate their members over a long period, withholding all the information at first, then slowly inculcating them until they believe they have been deemed worthy to possess understanding that others cannot have. Slowly these people become isolated from their families and friends. Cults continually surface across the globe and a Christian must study the subject to know what to join and what to avoid. The OccultThe occult is part of the spirit of falsehood as surely as Satan seeks to bring our lives under his dominion and power. The word \"occult\" means hidden or secret things. The occult thrives today in Centre County. It appears everywhere, on television, in our music, in the fascination with witchcraft whether through tarot cards, or Ouija boards, or secretive covens. Whatever the means, the occult is active and we must be careful to recognize it as the spirit of falsehood. SpiritismSpiritism - that is to say, the practice of contacting the dead - is clearly within the spirit of falsehood. Do people still practice this? Without question. In our town and in our county, people still try to contact the spirits of dead people, usually in an attempt to gain information and power. Now we know from the Word of God, the Bible, that we cannot actually contact the spirits of dead people, but Satanic spirits lurk behind those voices that mimic those who are dead. Spiritism of this sort is the spirit of falsehood. Pretenses to Christ"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The New Testament mentions pretenses to Christ, pretenders to the throne of God. Satan establishes organizations, or associations, or heretical churches to challenge the one God who came in the flesh, Jesus of Nazareth. These pretenders live in the spirit of falsehood. Only Jesus can unite the world under His blood atonement. A spirit of falsehood sets up the very pretenses Paul says he demolishes. And so, in a number of different ways, the spirit of falsehood introduces itself to all who care to listen, and be deceived. Following two years of study, the Elders conclude that Freemasonry is in conflict with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the purposes of our Church as defined in our Bylaws. Following two years of study, our Elders reached the conclusion that Freemasonry conveys sufficient material within the spirit of falsehood for one to classify it among those organizations in conflict with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the purposes of our Church as defined in our Bylaws. Please understand what I am saying and what I am not saying. What I speak of today refers to those Bylaws of our Church we are constitutionally able to discuss. I am not saying that a person has no right to belong to Freemasonry, nor am I saying Freemasonry has no right to exist. What I am saying, and what the Board of Elders and the Governing Board are saying, is that Freemasonry is in conflict with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the purposes of this Church as defined in our Bylaws, and this conflict places us on the spiritual ground where we stand today. We are simply saying this: We have the obligation and right to share with you today that we deem Freemasonry an organization conveying the sort of material that classifies it under our Bylaws as an organization in conflict with the purposes of this Church. That is all we are saying this morning. Ten reasons the Elders believe that Freemasonry (the Blue Lodge, the York Rite, the Scottish Rite) is in conflict with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Bylaws of this Church Ten reasons convince our Elders that Freemasonry, which we define this morning as the Blue Lodge, the York Rite, and the Scottish Rite, is in conflict with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Bylaws of this Church. Not every service organization or fraternity is connected to this system First, not every service organization or fraternity is connected to the system of Freemasdnry, and we want you to know that. But many organizations are connected with Freemasonry, and if you belong to any of these organizations you should reflect and pray over your involvement with those organizations. But to repeat, many fraternities, fraternal orders, and service organizations have nothing whatever to do with the teachings of Freemasonry. It is important for every single one of us to recognize what we are involved with, what we are not involved with, and what certain organizations are trying to teach us about God. Why study the Scottish Rite, or higher Degrees as representive of the Lodge?Why study the Scottish Rite or the higher Degrees as representative of the Lodge? Since according to 1991 figures, only about 50 percent of all Masons ever move on to the Scottish Rite or to the York Rite combined, and about 50 percent remain with the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Blue Lodge, would not it be better just to study the Blue Lodge since all Masons have traveled through it together? The Blue Lodge does not teach the deeper principles of FreemasonryFreemasonry defines the Blue Lodge as Degrees one, two and three. During his initiation into the Blue Lodge a candidate is told that nothing in Freemasonry will conflict with his personal religious preferences. The Blue Lodge does not, however, teach the deeper principles of Freemasonry. How do we know that? Ritual in the 26th Degree, the Prince of Mercy or Scottish TrinitarianThe Ritual clearly states, in the 26th Degree, the Prince of Mercy, that Freemasonry discloses its teaching only over time and only by Degrees (Ritual, page 384). You may ask, what is \"the Ritual\"? The Ritual is that set of ceremonies, dogmas, and teachings, by which members are brought into the higher Degrees of Freemasonry. Any one of you can read the book we used in our study in the Rare Books Room of Pattee Library at The Pennsylvania State University. In other words, I am not quoting the works of an anti-Mason. I am quoting a work of the Masons written to bring members into the higher Degrees of Freemasonry within the Scottish Rite. This book is, of course, exceedingly rare. Probe Ministries recently aired a series of teachings about Freemasonry on WTLR, and they could not even locate this book. But thankfully at Penn State a rare Masonic collection has provided the Ritual for all who care to look, and it forms the basis of what I present to you this morning. Masony discloses its secrets cautiously, and never makes the whole truth known at once (26th Degree, Prince of Mercy, Ritual, page 384). If you went to the Rare Books Room and accessed The Book of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry you would find in the 26th Degree, these words: \"Masonry discloses its secrets cautiously, and never makes the whole truth known at once. This is what Masons themselves confirm about Freemasonry as described in the Ritual, the book by which members are brought into the higher Degrees of Freemasonry. This is not my commentary about Freemasonry; this is the Ritual describing what it does. Thus, a member going through the Blue Lodge-that is the first three Degrees-or onward through the Scottish Rite to the 32nd Degree and on to the 33rd honorary Degree, or through the York Rite, will receive information unavailable to them at the first three Degrees, precisely because Freemasonry is cautious about what it discloses and believes that only certain people should hear all of the information available at the Blue Lodge level. Does this description remind you yet of a false gospel? Notice that one must continue on and gain more information before one understands what \"the truth\" is because Freemasonry discloses its \"truth\" only in process. The organization tells, at this point, that its teachings are intentionally cloaked. The 17th Degree, Knights of the East and West The Scottish Rite reveals more information about Freemasonry than the Blue Lodge reveals, as we continue to see in these statements found in the 17th Degree, Knights of the East and West. (We begin) a course of instruction which will fully unveil the heart and the inner mysteries of Masonry (17th Degree, Knights of the East and West, Ritual, page 240). In the 17th Degree, thirteen degrees beyond the Blue Lodge, in the middle of the Scottish Rite, a member begins a course of instruction that will fully unveil the heart and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the inner mysteries of Freemasonry. The teachings of the Blue Lodge are in other words, only the preliminary teachings of Freemasonry. The first three degrees of the Blue Lodge do not reveal the heart and inner mysteries of Freemasonry. Only in the 17th Degree--and not in the Blue Lodge-does a Mason in the Scottish Rite approach the heart and the inner mysteries of Freemasonry. This is why we study the Scottish Rite and not the Blue Lodge.

Used from, approximately 1885 through 1925 to todayThe Ritual has been used from approximately 1885 through 1925 and perhaps up until today. It was the first and last compilation of the individual ritual degrees. McClenachan compiled the teachings of the different degrees from different books. Freemasonry published his work and went on to use it for approximately 40 years. As we talked to local Masons who complained that McClenachan's book was outdated, we asked for the new book and were told that there is no new book There has been no further compilation for good reason: Freemasonry did not want its secrets to be known. Copy in Rare Books Room, Pattee Library at The Pennsylvania State University,with an initiation program from a Scottish Rite Lodge in New Jersey from the 1920sThe copy of the Ritual in the Rare Books Room at Penn State includes an initiation program from a Scottish Rite Lodge in New Jersey from the 1920s. In that book one finds a mimeographed form of how this initiation actually proceeded. If someone were to say this book was not used, it is simply not true. If someone were to say all of this occurred back in the nineteenth century, it is simply not true. We found it was in use in the 1920s, and it probably went on to be used through the Second World War. That may seem like ancient history, but our grandfathers may have used this book. So we know local chapters of Freemasonry used it to move members through the successive Degrees. It is time now for us to list the ten reasons we believe Freemasonry conflicts with the teachings and Bylaws of our Church."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Reason Number One: Freemasonry uses pagan religions as an inspiration for their ceremonies The 21st Degree, Prussian Knight, or Noachite If you have doubts, listen to these words of Freemasonry from the Prussian Knight (who claim Noah as their Patriarch), 21st Degree: They meet only on the nights of the full moon, and allow no other light but hers, because such was the ancient custom of the Order, derived from the mysteries of Ceres and the old worship of Isis (21st Degree, Prussian Knight, Ritual, page 322). \"They (meaning the Prussian Knights) meet only on nights of the full moon, and allow no other light but hers, because such was the ancient custom of the Order, derived from the mysteries of Ceres and the old worship of Isis.\" Isis is the moon goddess of Egypt. Ceres is her Greek equivalent. This ritual obviously uses as its inspiration, the worship of Isis. It is of pagan origin, and it involves the worship of false deities. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one religion, it finds its great truths in all. (26th Degree, Prince of Mercy Ritual, page 380). \"Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one religion, it finds its great truths in all.\" All religions provide accessibility for Freemasonry and the truths within those primitive religions find their way into this organization. All of the great religions, past and present, supply Freemasonry with truths, and it makes liberal use of pagan religions. We reproduce the speculations of the Philosophers (the Kabalists,the Mystagogues, and the Gnostics. Every one being at liberty to apply our symbols and emblems as he thinks most consistent with truth and reason, and with his own faith we give them such an interpretation only as may be accepted by all (20th Degree, Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges, Ritual, page 313). From the Ritual: \"We reproduce the speculations of the Philosophers, the Kabalists, the Mystagogues, and the Gnostics\" Those are three big words. What do they mean? Few people would take the time or have the time to find out. But a quick trip to the Penn State Library can lead to answers. I was able to read four books on the Kabala. You can read them too, if you care to locate them. You can understand these concepts rather than letting these concepts pass unstudied through your mind. Continuing from the Ritual: \"Everyone being at liberty to apply our symbols and emblems as he thinks most consistent with truth and reason, and with his own faith, we give them such an interpretation only as may be accepted by all.\" Someone might ask, Haven't you misapplied these symbols? Masonic orders would compel me to answer, No! This passage has told me that all of the symbols and the emblems of Freemasonry use the primary meaning of the symbol or emblem first. The Scottish Rite states that it uses only the primary or first meaning of any symbol. So when it tells you about Isis it means Isis and when it tells you about Osiris it means Osiris. When you see its symbols, the primary meaning is what you are to understand. We find this out that as we go on. We, like our ancient Masters, mourn Osiris-the type to us of the Sun, of light, of life. ... Weep, my brethren, for Osiris! ... Weep for Osiris, type of the good the true, the beautiful (24th Degree, Prince of the Tabernacle Ritual, page 356)! The M.P. (Most Puissant, or Powerful, Leader) says, \"We, like our ancient Masters, mourn Osiris (that is the sun god of Egypt, the opposite of the moon goddess)-the type"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"to us of the Sun, of light, of life.\" Then the M.P. says to the initiates, \"Weep, my brethren, for Osiris!\" What the M.P. has just asked each initiate to do is weep for a foreign deity, the sun god, Osiris. So I as an initiate in the 24th Degree am being taught to worship the Egyptian sun deity. This is idolatry plain and simple. Reason Number Two: Freemasonry teaches Universalism, that all will be ultimately saved Universalism is the belief that all will ultimately be saved. I wish everyone were saved, but that is not God's plan and, that is not the Gospel. Jesus came and died, calling us to repent of our sins and believe in Him. But what we find Freemasonry saying is that everyone will eventually be saved. Do they really believe that? We can examine the question together. The 29th Degree, Knight of Saint Andrew or Patriarch of the Crusades In the 29th degree, Knight of Saint Andrew, we read in the Scottish Rite: The Masonic system regards all the human race as members of one great family---as having the same origin and the same destination; all distinctions of rank, lineage or nativity, are alike unknown (29th Degree, Knight of Saint Andrew, Ritual, pages 432 and 433). The Masonic system regards all the human race as members of one great family - having the same origin and the same destination. In other words, Freemasonry teaches its people Universalism. I personally do not believe we all have the same destination, and the Gospel does not teach that the human race has the same destination. Jesus clearly explained the two possible destinations, one for the sheep and one for the goats. Freemasonry conflicts here with the Word of God and the purposes of this local Church, which is to uphold truth as revealed in the Old and New Testaments. Reason Number Three: Freemasonry teaches the principles of pagan religions as truth Freemasonry teaches the principles of pagan religions as truth. Are we sure Freemasonry teaches the principles of pagan religions as truth? Yes. Here is what the Ritual says: The 25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent In the 25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent, we read this from the Ritual: The duties of a Knight of the Brazen Serpent are: To purify the soul of its alloy of earthliness through the gate of Capricorn and the seven spheres it may at length ascend to its eternal home beyond the stars; and also perpetuate the great truths enveloped in the symbols and allegories of the ancient mysteries (25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent, Ritual, page 358). The duties of a Knight of the Brazen Serpent are to purify the soul of its alloy of earthliness (this is a tenet of Gnosticism), that through the gate of Capricorn and the seven spheres (this is astrology) it may, at length, ascend (that is to say, the human body) to its eternal home beyond the stars; and also to perpetuate the great truths enveloped in the symbols and the allegories of the ancient mysteries. The ancient mysteries here are the ancient religions, not the Gospel. If you or I wanted to fulfill the duties of a Knight of the Brazen Serpent, one of our obligations would be to perpetuate the truths of the ancient mysteries or the pagan ancient religions. Freemasonry has just"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"taught me the principles of pagan ancient religions and asked me to uphold those principles. We find no commensurate call to perpetuate the truth of Christianity and no call to perpetuate the truth of the Old Testament. Even though the brazen serpent is a prototype of Christ from the Old Testament, I am not called to perpetuate the truths of the New Testament. I am called, rather, to perpetuate the truths enveloped in the ancient mysteries. A good Knight will do that; a bad Knight will not. What Freemasonry is asking of me is contrary to God's call for my life. Reason Number Four: Freemasonry teaches that the cross is not the most important symbol of the world, but rather the pentagramMasons learn that the cross is not the most important symbol of the world, but rather the pentagram. It may be difficult for Christians involved in Freemasonry to accept this belief, but it is clearly stated in the Ritual. The 28th Degree, Knight of the Sun or Prince Adept In the 28th Degree, under Knight of the Sun, this is what we read from the Ritual: Ah the mysteries of Magism, all the symbols of the gnosis, all the figures of the occult philosophy, all the kabalistic keys of prophecy, are summed up in the sign of the pentagram, the greatest and most potent of an signs (28th Degree, Knight of the Sun, Ritual, page 413). All the mysteries of Magism (that is magi and is where the word \"magic\" comes from), all the symbols of the gnosis (that is Gnosticism), all the figures of occult philosophy (I did not insert that word, it is their term), all the Kabalistic keys of prophecy, are summed up in the sign of the pentagram, the greatest and the most potent of all signs. The Gnostics hold to it, the Kabalists hold to it, the Mystegogues hold to it, Occult philosophy holds to it. The dark world outside of \"the one and only true God\" holds the pentagram as the most potent of all signs. If a Mason in the Scottish Rite wants to know what is the most potent sign in this universe, it is not the cross but the pentagram. Take the cross down and raise the pentagram. As the Ritual continues, we read, ... it is a sign ancient as history and more than history; and the complete understanding of it is the key to the two worlds (28th Degree, Knight of the Snn, Ritual, page 413). It (the pentagram) is a sign as ancient as history and more than history; and the complete understanding of it (the pentagram) is the key to the two worlds (the world of God or what they call the macrophage, and the microphage or the world of humanity). Freemasonry teaches that only one symbol brings the two worlds of God and humanity together and that is the pentagram. It is not the cross that gives the Mason an understanding of the two worlds, God and humanity, it is the pentagram. So how am I to understand the nature of God and the nature of his creation? Not through the cross but through the pentagram. Nevertheless, I personally believe the New Testament explains that the cross is the focal point of history and civilization, not the pentagram. Reason Number Five: Freemasonry teaches astrology in its RitualsMany outside the \"craft\" have not grasped the importance of astrology to Freemasonry. The 23rd Degree, Chief of the Tabernacle In the 23rd Degree, Chief of the Tabernacle, we read from the Ritual that: The world, the ancients believed, is governed by seven secondary causes; and these are the universal forces designated by Moses under the plural name Elohim, The Gods. These"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"forces, analogous and contrary the one to the other by their counter-action produce the equilibrium, and regulate the movements of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven Great Archangels (23rd Degree, Chief of the Tabernacle, Ritual, page 346) The world, the ancients (from the Kabala) believed (you must concentrate to catch this point), is governed by seven secondary causes. These are the universal forces designated by Moses under the plural name Elohim. (The Bible teaches that Elohim is the name of God, not the name of seven secondary sources or forces. If you are a Mason in the Scottish Rite you have been taught this, but it is wrong.) These forces, analogous and contrary the one to the other, by their counteraction produce the equilibrium, and regulate the movements of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the \"Seven Great Archangels.\" What I have just heard is that the \"seven secondary causes\" are the \"Seven Great Archangels,\" and the \"Seven Great Archangels\" are God. That is blasphemy! God is not an angel. This organization of Freemasonry communicates neither Biblical nor Hebrew revelation. Instead, Freemasonry teaches astrology. We can examine this contention for ourselves. The Ritual has taught that the Seven Great Archangels are \"Elohim.\" But Elohim is not the name of angels; Elohim is the name of God. When Freemasonry creates angelic orders and calls them God, they err. We shall see these angels in the next slide. The Ritual states that the angels, these seven secondary causes, the Elohim, the Gods, actually control the planets on which they live. It also represents the seven archangels whom the Hebrews assigned to the government of those planets (23rd Degree, Chief of the Tabernacle, Ritual, page 345). They tell us Elohim represents the seven great archangels whom the Hebrews assigned to the government of those planets. But the original Hebrews did not assign angels to planets, and I guarantee that God never revealed that He did. The medieval Kabalistic-Hebrews, however, believed in magic and occult studies, and the origin of this teaching lies there. Is it not deceptive to Freemasonry's own membership to use the term \"Hebrews\" as if this material stemmed from the Old Testament? This is an admixture of truth and error or a spirit of falsehood. Reason Number Six: Freemasonry does not affirm the uniqueness of the Old and New TestamentFreemasonry declines to affirm the uniqueness of the Old and the New Testament. We acknowledge that the uniqueness of the Old Testament and the New Testament is clearly affirmed in the Word of God. Second Timothy 3:16 tells us that \"all scripture is God breathed.\" But what does Freemasonry believe about the Old and New Testament? The 17th Degree, Knights of the East and West In the 17th Degree, we find in the Ritual that: The religion taught by Moses, which like the laws of Egypt, enunciated the principles of exclusion, borrowed at every period of its existence from all the creeds with which it came in contact (17th Degree, Knights of the East and West, Ritual, pages 240 and 241). The religion taught by Moses, which, like the laws of Egypt, enunciated the principles of the exclusion, borrowed at every period of its existence from all the creeds with which it came in contact. What Freemasonry has just told us is that the scriptures are mere compilations of \"borrowed\" material. Moses said nothing new, the Ten"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Commandments said nothing new, the Torah said nothing new, and the prophets had nothing but mainly Egyptian and Canaanite truths rehashed for the Israelites. In fact, the earlier works of the Zoroasterins and the Persians may be the root of the Old Testament as well. Freemasonry teaches that God did not \"breathe\" the Old Testament and the New Testament and that these Testaments are therefore not unique.Every student of religion knows that the differences between Israelite and Egyptian religions are profound. The differences between the Egyptians and Israelites were so intense that God called the Israelites to flee Egypt and embrace the monotheistic God who had no form. But Freemasonry teaches that the Old Testament is merely borrowed material from earlier religions the Israelites came in contact with as they wandered through the desert, and Moses downloaded all this material. Reason Number Seven: Freemasonry states that it is not a religion but then affirms that it actually is Freemasonry states it is not a religion but then affirms it actually is. One of the first tenets Masons tell us is that Freemasonry is not a religion, and I believe they honestly think that Freemasonry is not a religion. But look at what Freemasonry says about itself in its Ritual. The 4th Degree, Secret Master In the 4th Degree, Secret Master, we read this from the Ritual: Genuine Freemasonry, my brother, is a system of morals, and approaches religion: in fact, such was primitive Freemasonry (4th Degree, Secret Master, Ritual, page 43). Genuine Freemasonry, my brothers, is a system of morals, and approaches religion; in fact, such was primitive Freemasonry. Remember that the Fourth Degree is the initiating degree into the Scottish Rite. The initiate has left the first three Degrees of the Blue Lodge and moves now from four onward to thirty-two. In the Fourth Degree, the beginning of their journey into the Scottish Rite, initiates discover that Freemasonry approaches religion and that some form of it called primitive Freemasonry existed earlier. But that is not the whole story. The 20th Degree, Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges or Master Ad Vitam As we travel sixteen more Degrees, we find this passage at the 20th Degree: The degrees of the Ancient and Accepted rite form a connected system of moral, religious, and philosophical instruction (20th Degree, Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges, Ritual, page 312). The degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite form a connected system of moral, religious, and philosophical instruction. Freemasonry says it is no religion but it certainly provides \"religious instruction.\" If it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck They have admitted they provide religious instruction and are involved with religion. Whether they are taught to repeat it or not, the word \"religion\" recurs in the Ritual.If Freemasonry is not a religion, why would it use the word in its initiations? But the story continues. The 26th Degree, Prince of Mercy or Scottish Trinitarian We discover, as we continue six more Degrees, in the 26th Degree that Masonry is a Worship, but one in which all civilized men can unite (26th Degree, Prince of Mercy, Ritual, page 380)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Freemasonry teaches in its initiations it is a worship, but one in which all civilized men can unite. While the cross no longer unites civilized men, Freemasonry is indeed a worship. Freemasonry is not a religion, but it has the ability to provide an avenue along which all civilized men can worship. The 29th Degree, Knight of Saint Andrew or Patriarch of the Crusades As we continue three more Degrees in the Scottish Rite, we find in the 29th Degree that Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundations of all religions (29th Degree, Knight of Saint Andrew, Ritual, page 427). Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundations of all religions. Freemasonry says that it has been able -- and only it has been able -- to preserve all of these primitive faiths, these primitive religions, the foundations of all religion. Although they will not admit to being a religion, their rituals subsume all the primitive religions. They are preserved within those rituals, available to all who care to be involved. Freemasonry first claims to preserve all the primitive religions, provide worship for civilized men, and provide associated religious study and instruction; then it claims not to be a religion. These two claims conflict. Reason Number Eight: Freemasonry uses the Kabala as a base of teaching (17th Degree, Knights of the East and West, Ritual, page 229) \"Kabala\" is a new word to many of us. Few of us have heard it, let alone understand its occult nature. Even seminary graduates can overlook it. But you can access it if you want through the \"Libraries Information Access System,\" LIAS, at The Pennsylvania State University. The Kabala, it turns out, is a classic in occult literature. The Kabalists were a mystical, Judaistic sect in the Middle Ages, and some of their writings appear to have come down to us from the first thousand years or millennium after Christ. The Kabalist Community organized these writings as a theological system used first in Spain and then in Europe. It sought to control God above us and society around us with magical incantations and odd applications of the Hebrew alphabet. A book originally compiled in Spain, the Kabalists believe the Kabala contains traditions that go back to the time of Solomon. Most date it later, in the first century, but it came together around the twelfth century in Spain. The Kabala included a group of mystics within Judaism who shared a number of consistent precepts. The Kabala advances the following ideas in its teaching, as gleaned from The Kabalah. from Its inception to Its Evanescence, by Joseph Wallman, Theological Research Publishing Co. Brooklyn, New York, 1958, (referenced as The Kabalah), and The Wisdom of the Zohar. An Anthology of texts, by Fischel Lachower and Isaiah Tishby, English translation by David Goldstein. Oxford [Oxfordshire]; New York, Published for the Littman Library by Oxford University Press, [1987], c1985, (referenced as Book of Zohar). Soul is pre-existent (The Kabalah, page 17) The Kabala teaches that the soul is pre-existent, which is to say, the soul existed before conception. You existed somewhere, somehow, in some sphere, which they will define for you later. The Bible does not teach this."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"One may recollect from previous existences (The Kabalah, page 17) One may recollect from previous existences. You can \"go around\" more than once. Actually you go around three times if you have to, and at death you just inhabit another body. Nowadays, we call this reincarnation. You can read for yourself that this was the teaching of the Spanish Jewish Kabalists in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. God is in everything and everything is in God (The Kabalah, page 18). God is in everything and everything is in God. We call this idea pantheism. God is in the snowflake; in fact, the snowflake is part of God. We of course believe God created the snowflake, and His presence is related to the snowflake. But He is not the snowflake itself. The soul leaves the body at night (The Kabalah, page 48). The soul leaves the body at night. You probably wondered where you went at night after you fell asleep. The Kabala states that every person leaves his body at night, travels somehow to God, and then comes back mysteriously in the morning. I guess if you sleep late in the moming your soul has lost its way back This idea is called soul travel or astral projection.Creation was not made out of \"nothing\" (The Kabalah page 115). Creation was not made out of nothing. Even though Genesis one tells us that the creation came out of nothing, the Kabala says it was fashioned from the four elements-water, fire, earth and ether-and you see those four elements in the symbols of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Souls may inhabit other bodies at death (The Unifying Factor: A Review of the Kabalah, by Nekama Schoenburg, Northvale, N.J., J. Aronson, 1996, pages 77 - 80). The soul may inhabit other bodies, as I mentioned, and the soul can inhabit another body at death. You really get three chances to go around-that is, three attempts at redemption before going home to the Lord. Stars and planets affect everything on earth through the angelic personalities that rule them (Book of Zohar, page 663) In the Kabala we discover that stars and planets affect everything on earth through the angelic personalities that rule them. Remember the Ritual said (23rd Degree, Chief of the Tabemacle, Ritual, page 345) that on these planets live seven archangels in charge of government there. Well, the Kabala believes the same thing. Where did Freemasonry get this idea that ail these angelic personalities or spirits, rule over these planets? It came from the Kabala.The text and teaching of the Kabala were communicated through contact with the dead while the receivers were in trances (The Kabala, Page 6) The Kabala insists that its text and teaching were communicated through contact with the dead while the authors were in trances. Chief among those the authors identified was Elijah. The individuals who wrote the Kabala fell into trances, communicated mainly with the Satanically mimicked spirit of Elijah, and when they came out of their trances, they recorded the text of the Kabala and gave it to their disciples. This is spiritism, a spirit of falsehood. The text of the Old Testament contains Hebrew letters, which are hidden angelic power sources (The Kabalah, page 6). The text of the Old Testament and the Torah contains, to the Kabalists, Hebrew letters, which exert angelic power. More specifically, either the first twelve or the first fourteen"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"letters of the Hebrew alphabet bear an association with an angel. When reading a verse of the Old Testament, the Kabalist looks for meaning beyond the ordinary meaning of that word or verse. He looks for the angelic personalities or powers that come into play in that verse. When a Kabalist recites that verse, he actually calls on the angel to empower him. Moreover, Kabalists spin the name Yahweh around, and it becomes a new word describing the union of male and female. The Kabaha in the Ritual At this point, we should inquire whether the Kabala is really all this important to Freemasonry. The candiate is subjected to an examination the most strict in regard to the (Pista or) pledges he has given in the degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry: also as to his proficiency in the Kabala of those degrees (17th Degree, Knights of the East and West, Ritual, page 229) The candidate (in the 17th Degree, Knights of the East and West) is subjected to an examination most strict in regard to the Pista or pledges he has been given in the degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry; also as to his proficiency in the Kabala of those degrees. Are these pledges really important? They must be since after sixteen Degrees, they go back and make sure that an initiate knows all the pledges he has taken. Moreover, according to the Ritual, the candidate is checked to make sure he understands both the various pledges he has made and how the Kabala has influenced the Degrees of Freemasonry. Obviously, the Kabala has had a big impact if by this time it must be fully integrated with the pledges.Pausing at the 17th Degree a candidate who has gone from the 4th Degree through the 16th Degree will undergo careful scrutiny to make sure he understands how the Kabala influences the Degrees. Freemasonry affirms that the Kabala is influential within its Degrees. It is that simple.If thy intellect is dull and coarse by nature, or clouded and confused by indulgence the syrnbolisms of the Kabala will have no meaning to thee (25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent, Ritual, page 363). The Ritual continues by saying (at the 25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent): if thy intellect is dull and coarse by nature, or clouded and confused by indulgence, the symbols of the Kabala will have no meaning to thee. In other words, if your head is a block of cement, if you have failed to get it by now, you will not understand because you lack perception, because by this time the Kabala should have had a big influence on your life. By the 25th Degree you should understand how central the Kabala is in your life. The Fraternity of Freemasonry is going to test and make sure that the relationship between the Ritual, magic, and the Kabala has influenced your life.Magic and the Kabala In 1486, Peco, a follower of the Kabala observed that Mastery of the Kabala can give a person unimagined magical skill (Magic in the Middle Ages, Richard Kieckhefer, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990) \"Mastery of the Kabala can give a person unimagined magical skill. That is why in The Satanic Bible Anton Le Vey uses an emblem of Leviathan within an inverted pentagram to portray his organization. He found the symbols and the concepts in the Kabala, which he freely references. The essence of the Kabala is gaining magical occult skills.Book of Zohar, Kabala"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Book of Zohar, the chief book of the Kabala, states that:All the stars and the planets in the firmament are appointed as overseers and officers to serve the world. There is not a single blade of grass in the entire world that is not controlled by a star or, a planet in the firmament (Book of Zohar II, page 664) All the stars and the planets in the firmament are appointed as overseen and officers to serve the world. There is not a single blade of grass in the entire world that is not controlled by a star or a planet in the firmament. We see here a hymn to astrology. Incredible energy apparently exists on my front lawn. I wish I could convince it to stop growing in the summer! Notice that the Kabala is not talking here just about gravity and the laws of physics or plant growth. It is discussing angelic spirits (they may not even be angelic) placed on those stars and planets (an idea based on astrology, the basis of Kabalistic magic) supposedly to influence everything on earth, including human life and behavior. Reason Number Nine: Freemasonry believes it alone is the guardian of spiritual truths given at the dawn of humanityOur ninth reason for avoiding Freemasonry is its belief that it alone is the guardian of spiritual truths handed down at the dawn of humanity. Shall we step back thousands of years to find out who Freemasonry says really preserves the one true name of God and His worship? The Eighth Degree, Intendant of the Buildings In the Eighth Degree, Intendant of the Buildings, we find in the Ritual that:You will advance toward the light-toward the star blazing in the distance--which is an emblem of the divine truth, given by God to the first men and preserved amid all the vicissitudes of ages in the traditions and teachings of Masonry (8th Degree, Intendant of the Buildings, Ritual page 93). You will still advance toward the light--toward the star blazing in the distance-which is an emblem of the divine truth, given by God to the first men and preserved through the traditions and teachings of Masonry. Masons have the right to believe this, if they want. We live in a free country. But it does countermand the purposes of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the purposes of this Church as decreed by our Bylaws under the constitution of churches of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Reason Number Ten: Freemasonry contains material shared by spiritist groups Our tenth objection to Freemasonry centers on the fact that it promulgates material shared in common with spiritist groups. If you read The Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, by Franz Hartmann, in the Penn State Rare Books Room, you will find shared symbols dating from the 19th century translated out of the German and hand colored: proof that Freemasonry did not make up its own symbols, but borrowed many of them from groups like the Rosicrucians. The mysteries, names of deities, rituals The \"mysteries\" are ancient religious systems gleaned from Egypt and nearby Mesopotamian countries. The names of such deities as Isis and Osiris, as well as earlier rituals, come right out of this worship. They are located throughout the Ritual of the Scottish Rite."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The  Kabala,  world  view  When Freemasonry asserts that spiritual forces besides God control all aspects of life, the belief comes from the Kabala. The world view that attributes the power of planets to the angels or spirits on those planets comes from the Kabaia rather than the Old or New Testaments. The   alchemists,   symbols   The alchemists and Freemasonry bear surprisingly strong similarities. Few people nowadays understand the roots of medieval alchemy, though they may recall Mickey Mouse and the Disney production of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\" In general, alchemists tried vainly to turn lead into gold. But the alchemists of Europe actually worked on two levels: the physical and the spiritual. In the process of trying to turn lead into gold, they were trying as well to turn the dress of their lives into gold before Deity. As the alchemists labored on these two different planes, they gradually adopted a number of symbols, like the double-headed eagle. This symbol, which Freemasonry shares in its 31st, 32nd, and 33rd Degrees, comes not from The Scottish Rite but from the 17th century works of the alchemists. The eagle, called the \"tail-eater,\" is the emblem given to persons who have at last learned to control the seven planets in their lives. Is it a coincidence that Freemasonry uses this symbol at the very end of the Scottish Rite degree? I think not. The  Rosicrucians,  symbols We also find a figure called the \"Rebis,\" with the head of both a male and a female on one body. It is standing on a serpent, which is itself atop a globe. This figure appears in the ritual of Freemasonry, as well as on the cover of the book The Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, by Franz Hartmann. It is also rooted in and strongly associated with alchemy. The serpent makes a speech as it is subjugated bestowing unlimited power on the figure above desiring to uncover its potential. Far from unique to Freemasonry, this symbol occurred among the alchemists as well as the Rosicrucians. As we can see, occult philosophy indeed has a strong hold on the \"Craft\" that is Freemasonry. In fact, the Ritual includes this key phrase: \"The understanding of the occult is the knowledge of the Equilibrium (Sohar, Boolt I., Siphra de Zeniutha)\" (28th Degree, Knight of the Sun, Ritual, page 403) Furthermore, the Ritual in the 28th Degree, Knight of the Sun, quotes the Book of Zohar: \"The understanding of the occult is the knowledge of the Equilibrium.\" Whether it be the mysteries, or the Kabala, or the alchemists, or the Rosicrucians-or even the occult-Freemasonry draws ever close to spiritist organizations. Shared symbolsActually, many shared symbols exist. While we cannot discuss all of them today, we will make them all available to you. Do most Masons, or Freemasons, know these things?Probably not! Probably 95 percent of Masons have never understood all of them. For these six reasons, they would probably fail to grasp this material on Freemasonry we have just presented. First, most objectionable material appears in the later degrees"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The most inherently objectionable material appears in the later degrees-that is to say, in the philosophical degrees at the end of the Scottish Rite called the Areopagus. The inner mysteries, the heart of Freemasonry, lie here, and most members never advance to this Degree. Second, words and symbots go undefined If initiates do advance, the words and symbols remain undefined for them. One never finds the Rebis symbol defined. It will be found and described plainly only in esoteric works on alchemy. It will be found in the work of the Rosicrucians. But it has slipped into Freemasonry without adequate explanation. You will never find the double-headed eagle explicitly explained as representing planetary understanding. But look carefully and you will find it in the works of the Rosicrucians and alchemists. Freemasonry often leaves words and symbols inadequately defined. Third, most people are untrained in theology Most people are untrained in theology. I am not an engineer, and you would hardly want me to build your house. I can barely change a tire. Most of us, frankly, have little reading in advanced theology, and so as we come in contact with ancient religions we rarely understand how they connect with each other. Fourth, words and symbols pass by quickly in initiations Words and symbols pass by quickly in initiations. Some Masons have told me that they passed through the entire Scottish Rite in a weekend. Zohar, Kabala-they all seem wonderful and mysterious. But they are not defined. The words run right through the ears. Few initiates really understand that as they put a crimson ribbon with the \"depicted\" names of Osiris and Moses with the words of Isis and Ceres on their chests, which they are asked to do (25th Degree, Knight of the Brazen Serpent, Ritual, page 361), they are really putting the name of Moses with the names of foreign gods on their chests. It all passes too quickly. Fifth, few written records exist Only a few written records exist. The Ritual is a rare book, the last compilation that we know of, unless people are deliberately trying to mislead us. Thus we find that the Freemasonry progression is just not well documented. We asked the Masons in the Scottish Rite to give us a newer version if the older version concerns them. But they could not point to anything newer. It has been taken out of circulation, if it existed at all. But the words of Albert Pike, who wrote Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, seem to coincide with what we uncovered in this 1914 edition. All the material agrees: It is from the land of the Scottish Rite, and it is not far from the Land of Oz. Sixth, the intent of the founders is thickly layered The intent of the founders is thickly layered. I believe, as I mentioned, that most Masons just do not understand the roots of alchemy, the roots of the Rosicrucians, and the rites of the early pagan religions. How did this organization come to be? In the book The Origins of Masonic Symbols. we find a statement by a Mason that gives us a clue: \"Apparently early Christian-Kabalists in the early 18th century formed the Scottish Rite in order to understand the deeper mysteries. It was a time of disenchantment with the church, and with spiritual things. The church was seen as cold and calculating rather than warm and mystical. It: was a time of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"encroaching humanism and rationalism. The idea of uniting the brotherhood of humanity under one religion seemed like a great idea. That is apparently where Freemasonry came from and why it is so heavily layered. A lot from the Old and New Testaments appear in the rituals, but that material is generally used out of context and mixed with religious concepts that are incompatible with the Old and New Testaments. What should love do? Well, what should love do? Maybe someone would say that the love of Jesus embraces everything and everybody. But if my daughter were approaching a hot iron, would I let her touch it? Love would say intervene. It would not be love to let her burn her hand. Embrace the iron, is that love? No. Love warns. And so when we believe that the love of Jesus embraces, and that He forgave the woman at the well, we remember that He also cautioned her to sin no more. Jesus said He came to bring a sword, and a sword He brings. It is a false concept of love to believe that God merely nurtures and gathers His little sheep and lets them do whatever they want. What should love do? Here are four suggestions: First, focus on the organization rather than the peopleRemember that our argument here is with the organization rather than its members. We are not talking about individual people we know; we are talking about an organization. We have problems with its dogmas, its morals, and its rituals. This understanding helps me to love people, yet requires me to warn them about the organization. Second, we wage war not against flesh and bloodWe wage war not against flesh and blood. It is not the person \"lodged\" in the lodge who we fight. It is the spirit of falsehood and error behind the organization we resist. We fight the pretense to Christ. We condemn the spirit of error and falsehood that has infiltrated truth and assumed some of its garb. Third, care enough to informWhat should love do? Care enough to inform people, which is precisely what we are doing. Let every individual make decisions for himself, but love says stop, watch out, you may be burned. Love says be informed. Love tells us when the skull and crossbones are on the bottle, do not drink from it. What is this talk that love encompasses everything, no matter its danger to us? Jesus came to give us truth and to tell us how to separate it from error. We are not rejecting people; we are looking at a pretense to the cross and saying this pretense is spiritually unhealthy. The organization of Freemasonry does not conform to the Gospel of Jesus Christ or the Bylaws of this Church. Fourth, pray and befriendPray and befriend. Most Masons have no idea what they face and in what they are involved. Not the people, as we have said, but the spirit of falsehood and error is behind Freemasonry. Masons need our prayers and friendship. I am not a member of Freemasonry but I have been told that when you enter the Blue Lodge you are told that nothing will violate your religious preferences. You will never be asked to do anything that countermands your beliefs. Then you are blindfolded and told to admit your spiritual darkness, even if you are a Christian! From the very beginning, you must admit that the light of Freemasonry is the only true light."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"It could well be that from the moment \"the initiate is blindfolded and kneeling before the altar of Freemasonry,\" he becomes spiritually blindfolded to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and that the light of Freemasonry close at hand deflects the true light. If the light of Freemasonry is not the light of Christ, then it is a dangerous deception. Spirits and principalities listen closely to the words we use and to what we affirm. We pray for ourselves and others that the spirit of deception may be broken. Today we have taken a little journey which in no way has included all the material we earlier gleaned from the Ritual. To discuss it all would take hours. I realize, too, that Freemasonry is hardly the only issue in our lives. In my own case, as I mentioned last week, I went through my house and made sure images and symbols speaking of foreign deities had not found a place there. It amazes me how these influences can infect our lives. Nor are we singling out one organization; we should be concerned about many other spiritual issues as well. What we are doing is making a statement as Elders that Freemasonry as an organization, though it has the right to exist and flourish, is contrary to the purpose of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and our Church Bylaws under the constitution of churches of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Thank you. The Chairman of the Board of Elders read the following policy statement after the sermonA Policy Statement by the Board of Elders of the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church Concerning Freemasonry General StatementThe Board of Elders believes that members and adherents of the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church should avoid all involvement with Freemasonry. Statement on Church Membership The Board of Elders affirms that Freemasonry is an order or organization whose teaching and requirements of allegiance are contrary to the doctrinal statement and purpose of the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church as found in The Bible and the Uniform Constitution for Accredited Churches of the Christian and Missionary Alliance and Church Bylaws. Therefore, Freemasons shall be ineligible for membership in the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. Statement about Church Members and Adherents Who Are FreemasonsThe Board of Elders will, in love and with a sincere desire, communicate truth in care for the souls of Freemasons who are members and adherents of the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. We hope that those members and adherents of the State College Christian and Missionary Alliance Church who are Freemasons will choose to disassociate themselves from Freemasonry and inform the Board of Elders and the Pastor of their decision. The Board of Elders, along with the Pastor, will meet with each member who desires to remain a Freemason and decide on the appropriate action in each case. Freemasons who are members shall be ineligible to hold any position of teaching or elected office in the Church. you would like a copy of this statement I will make them available here at the front of the church after the service."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Pastor JanssenI would like to close with a reading from the Word of God. After hearing a good deal that deviates from the Word of God, it seems appropriate to hear the Lord speak Bev Reagan brought the following passages from Scripture to our attention a couple weeks ago: 2 Chr 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. As men and women and as families we want to keep the land from desolation imposed by unholy beliefs and behaviors. Listen as the passage from Chronicles continues: 2 Chr 7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 2 Chr 7:18 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. 2 Chr 7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 2 Chr 7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations. 2 Chr 7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto   this   house?   2 Chr 7:22 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them. My family, my marriage, my children, my testimony, my ministry, our lives--I ask you, Do we not want God to heal our land, to heal our marriages, to heal our children, to heal our parents, and to heal our brothers and sisters? This is business that is serious before the Lord. Let us stand together, humble ourselves and pray. Pastoral PrayerFather, today in your presence we give to you our lives because this is not the only issue in my life or all of our lives, God. We ask you to help us by your Holy Spirit to separate the spirit of truth from the spirit of falsehood. Call me, God, to be humble in your sight. Call us, God, to pray. Call us, God, to seek your face. Call us, God, to turn away from any wickedness in me and each of us because we want our land healed. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. God bless you today.

Believest thou this? LET US LOOK AT SOME SCRIPTURES ABOUT KING SOLOMON. I Kings 10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. I Kings 11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, [and] Hittites; I Kings 11:2 Of the nations [concerning] which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: [for] surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. I Kings 11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David   his   father.      I Kings 11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the  abomination  of  the  Ammonites.   I Kings 11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as  [did]  David  his  father.   I Kings 11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

IF YOU ARE A MASON, PLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION - Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? SOLOMON WAS THE WISEST AND RICHEST OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH. YET WITH ALMOST AS MUCH CERTAINTY AS WE HAVE THAT THE GOOD THIEF WHO DIED ON THE CROSS NEXT TO JESUS HAS HEAVEN AS HIS DESTINY, WE KNOW THAT SOLOMON'S DESTINY IS HELL. EVEN THOUGH SOLOMON'S WRITINGS OF SOME PSALMS, THE PROVERBS, ECCLESIASTES, AND SONG OF SONGS IS IN THE BIBLE AND INSPIRED BY GOD, SOLOMON DIED IN HIS SINS. SOLOMON HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH MORE OCCULT LITERATURE THAN WITH SACRED SCRIPTURE. HE DIED FOLLOWING HIS GOD LUCIFER WHO WAS TAKING HIM TO HELL.

A word derived from the Greek sumbolon from sumballein, to suspect, divine, compare; a word of various meanings, even with the ancients, who used it to denote a sign, a mark, watchword, signal, token, a sealring, etc., its meaning is still more various in modern times. Freemasonry is a complete system of symbolic teaching, and can be known, understood, and appreciated only by those who study its symbolism, and make themselves acquainted with its occult meaning. To such, Freemasonry has a grand and sublime significance. Its symbols are moral, philosophical and religious, and all these are pregnant with great thoughts, and reveal to the intelligent Mason the awful mystery of life, and the still more awful mystery of death.
