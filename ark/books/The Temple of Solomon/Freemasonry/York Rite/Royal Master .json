[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Royal Master Iowa20031st Section The council room should be set up as in ppt#1. A representation of the Cherubim should be formed by theuse of nine standards, each with a burning taper, connected by silk rope enclosing the altar with anopening in the south. In the north east corner of the room there should be a table on which are several articles as described inKings I, verses 48­50 and a trestle board on which are several geometric designs. HA is at work there asthe degree opens. Candles on the table remain lighted throughout the entire first section. House lights are dimmedthroughout first section. Each of the three GMs should have a pedestal with a lighted candle upon it. All three are at their stationswhen the class is brought in. HA remains there until after the prologue. Aprons should not be worn over robes, except HA, who puts his on after repairing to the northeast corner. When all is ready the CC will conduct the candidates into the Council chamber and seat them on the southside of the room east of the CC station. CC assumes station and is seated. All candidates should wear white aprons. Only one active candidate should be used. The IM may give theprologue, or it can be done by another companion. Prol: I will take a moment at this time to explain to you in my own words, the setting of this \"The RoyalMaster Degree\" and its officers so you may better understand the work. I represent Solomon, King of Israel, on my right is Hiram, King of Tyre and on my left is Hiram Abiff. Thestation in the west is known as the Captain of the Guard. In the south is the Conductor of the Council. TheSteward and Sentinel complete the Officers that work in the degree. The three roughens are to remind youof the Master Mason degree. The alter is distinguished with the nine standards to represent the Sanctum Sanitarium into which welearned in the 3rd degree that Hiram Abiff entered t offer up his adorations to Deity. As the work begins,Hiram Abiff will take his place at the Trestle Board. Companions, you have repeatedly been informed that Masonry is a never­ending search for light. In theCraft degrees you received light, more light and further light, but your search was note ended. In theChapter degrees additional light was imparted to you, and you found, as you find in life, that eachadvancement in knowledge simply opens the eyes to a vaster field of knowledge yet to be attained. Everyrevealment in Masonry is also a reveilment. Every discovery of new truths also reveals a veil in front ofsome other truth, to be again the object of further search. Ultimate Truth will be discovered only when wehave passed the final veil and entered into the presence of Him who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In taking our degrees there is one thing you must remember, namely, the order in which events happen isseldom the order in which we learn about them. The successive degrees in Masonry picture events in theorder we learn abut them, not the chronological order in which they occurred. For instance, the events ofthe Mark Master degree took place before those of the Master Mason degree, but they were not presented"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to you in that order. The degree you are about to receive pictures events that happened prior to and after thetragedy of the third degree, and we would have you notice how well they fill the gaps in our knowledge ofthat tragedy and its meaning. In this degree you, as a candidate, will represent Adoniram, one of the most skilled of the craftsmenemployed by King Solomon at the building of the Temple, who was a close personal friend of the GrandMaster Hiram Abiff. Lights are dimmed. KS: Companion CG CG rises see that the candidate is prepared and presented. CG retires with K to the prep room and prepares him by divesting him of his coat and rolling up hissleeves, clothes him in an apron as a Fellowcraft and places a beautiful piece of work in his hands. Thispiece of work should be a miniature representation of the three lesser lights, which can actually be lighted. As K is taken out, HA leaves his station, goes to table in the northeast corner, puts on his apron and isworking there as CG and K enter. CG takes K by the right arm. They enter without an alarm and pass directly to the northeast corner of theroom where HA stands at the table examining the Holy Vessels. The K now represents the character Adoniram. KS, holding up the piece of work: My Illustrious Companion Hiram Abiff, this is a piece of work which Imyself gave orders to be made, and which, I observe, has been executed according to my command. It isintended to serve as a reminder of the mysterious triad, expressive of the essence and attributes of Deity andof those great Masonic virtues – Faith, Hope, and Charity. You will deposit it in the Holy of Holies, withthe other sacred furniture, and hereafter, in every Regular Masonic Lodge, let there be displayed about theAltar of Obligation, three burning tapers, placed in a triangular position; and may the virtues which theysymbolize, be a light unto the feet of every true and faithful Mason, in all walks of life, until that perfect daywhen the glory of the Lord shall illumine our souls forever. HA advances and receives the work, then turns to Ad: Adoniram, your work is accepted, and in due timeyou shall receive your reward. HA places the work on the table with the other Holy Vessels and CG & K stand aside to west facing south.HA, after examining all the vessels on the table: Yes, the furniture of the Holy of Holies is now nearlycompleted. Gong sounds 12 times. KS: Illustrious Companion Hiram Abiff, what is the hour? HA: High twelve, Illustrious King Solomon. KS, stands: It being high twelve, call the craft from labor to refreshment. HA: *** All rise: Companions, it is the order of the Illustrious King Solomon, that the craft be now calledfrom labor to refreshment. Take due notice and govern yourselves accordingly. The craft remain standing. HA removes his apron and proceeds to the Altar, going south, then west tosouth of Altar, then north to center of west of the Altar, proceeding by right angles as he goes. When HAstarts for the Altar, CG & K turn west, timing to speech, stop directly north of Altar, faces south and says\"to enter\" just as HA enters from the south. CG: It is now high twelve, at which hour it is the custom of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff to enter theSanctum Sanctorum and offer up his devotions to Deity. HA kneels at Altar and prays: Let me do my work each day and if the darkened hours of despair overtakeme, may I not forget the strength that comforted me in the sadness of other times. May I still remember the bright hours that found me walking over the silent hills of my childhood ordreaming on the margin of the quiet river, when a light glowed with in me and I promised my early God to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"have courage amid the tempest of the changing years. Spare me from bitterness and from the sharp passions of unguarded moments. Though the world know menot, may my thoughts and actions be such as shall keep me friendly with myself. Lift my eyes from theearth and teach me the uses of the stars. Forbid that I should judge others lest I condemn myself. Let me notfollow the glamour of the world but walk calmly in my path. Give me a few friends, who will love me for what I am and not for what little I may possess. And thoughage and infirmity overtake me and I come not within sight of the castle of my dreams, tech me still to bethankful for life and for time’s olden memories that are good and sweet, and may the evening’s twilight findme gentle still. Amen. CG, as the prayer ends, CG & K proceed to a point just west of Altar, then south to wait HA: Our GrandMaster Hiram Abiff, having concluded his devotions, let us await his return by way of the south gate. HA passes around the Altar and out at the opening in the south, then turns west. The CG & K meet andstop him as he turns west. CG does not touch HA. CG: Grand Master Hiram Abiff, when shall I receive the Master’s Word? HA: My worthy friend Ad, I do not know that you will ever receive it, for it is agreed by Solomon, King ofIsrael, Hiram, King of Tyre and myself that the Master’s Word can only be given when the Temple iscompleted, and then only in the presence of all three. HA again attempts to proceed westward and is again interrupted by CG: Grand Master Hiram Abiff, suppose one of you three, even you yourself, should be removed by death priorto that event, how shall I then receive it? HA hesitates, meditating a few moments, then takes K by the left arm, goes west to a line one pace east ofCG’s station, then north; the CG follows directly behind K, until opposite his station where he turns westand assumes his station. As CG reaches his station KS gives one knock (*) which seats everyone exceptHA & K. HA proceeds slowly north, then east, and should not begin talking until all are seated. HA with Kmoves slowly around Altar, speaking as they go, and pausing west of Altar, one pace west of standards,each time around, faces east, gives three taps with toe (***) and pointing down (to a point beneath theAltar), with right hand over left, says: \"It will be ...\" etc.: Companion Adoniram, death is a theme not lightly to be broached by those subject to its power. The youngmay die, the old must die, and the wisest knoweth not how soon. There is none that escapes the inexorabledoom. The youngest EA upon the checkered pavement below dwells ever in shadow of death, while theinvisible hand extends equally above KS on his ivory throne. We walk upon the ashes of the generationswho have gone this way before us, to which our ashes must in turn contribute. It is not for me, CompanionAdoniram, to hope for an exemption from the common doom of man. I may not live to see the Templecompleted; the Master’s Word may be lost, but if I die, (***, pointing down) it will be buried there. Circumambulates 2nd time: Companion Adoniram, death terminates the labor of a man. Thenceforth thegenerations may build and occupy, but he will not be there. The teeming brain, the skillful hand and thesinewy arm are alike useless and superfluous in the grave. As our Most Excellent King Solomon has said,\"The dead know not anything; their love, their hatred and their envy is no perished; neither have they anymore a portion forever of anything that is done under the sun.\" What an incentive is this to an industrioususe of our time and our faculties, that we should build industriously while our strength endures and labor to complete our work ere the week closesand the Sabbath of Eternity sets in. My work, Companion Adoniram, is not complete, though I havelabored long and faithfully to execute it. I may not live to see the Temple completed; the Master’s Wordmay be lost, but if I die, (***, pointing down) it will be buried there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Circumambulates 3rd time: Companion Adoniram, it is through the gate of death that we find an entranceto the place of wages, refreshment and rest. The Supreme Master of the Universe, before whom we bow in adoration, and whose All­Seeing Eye hasmarked our labors in the Lodge below, promises to spread before us in the Celestial Lodge above all thejoys and glories of His eternal Sabbath. After the strong hand of death has leveled all in the humiliation ofthe grave, the Almighty Hand of the Supreme Master shall prevail and exalt every brother to the gloriouscompanionship of that un­dissolving Lodge. There the designs upon the trestle board will be seencompleted. There the adoration of the 12th hour will be everlasting joy. There the noontide bliss willeternally shine.

HA proceeds clockwise around the Altar, again enters from the south and kneels a few moments in prayer.He then rises and proceeds around the Altar and out at the south as before. This time he is met by the 1stX, who thrice demands (in pantomime) the Word of a Master Mason. On being refused the 1st X gives hima low across the chest with a 24 inch gauge. HA proceeds west to a point on a line just east of the CG’s station, then north. Opposite the CG’s stationhe is met by the 2nd X who also thrice demands the Word and is refused. The 2nd X gives him a blowacross the chest with a square. HA proceeds north to a point in line opposite his station, turns east. When he reaches a point just east ofthe Altar he is met by the 3rd X who likewise demands of him the Word, and likewise refused, where uponthe 3rd X gives him a blow on the forehead with a setting maul, which fells him on the spot. The threeruffians then carry him out to the prep room. As ruffians leave with HA a single gong is sounded. KS: Companion CC CC rises what is the hour? CC: One hour past high twelve, Illustrious King Solomon. KS, stands: It being one hour past high twelve, call the craft from refreshment to labor. CC ***, all rise: Companions, it is the order of the Illustrious King Solomon, that the craft be now calledfrom refreshment to labor. Take due notice thereof, and govern yourselves accordingly.

The principle words of this degree are Alpha and Omega. We learn from Masonic tradition that the origin of this grip is as follows: Demonstrating with HKT as he explains. Solomon, King of Israel and Hiram, King of Tyre, meeting in the Sanctum Sanctorum shortly after thedeath of Hiram Abiff, placed themselves involuntarily in the position to give the Master’s Word, whensuddenly realizing that one of their number was wanting, the immediately placed their hands on eachother’s shoulders, Solomon, pointing down, asked, \"What do you see there?\" Hiram, King of Tyrereplying, \"A broken triangle.\" Both throwing up their arms, Solomon exclaiming, \"Alas\", Hiram King ofTyre replied, \"Poor Hiram.\" Companion Conductor of the Council, you will now seat the candidates. KS, HKT and CG return to their stations. CC conducts class to seats and returns to his station. When allare in position, KS gives one knock and all are seated. Historical Lecture This degree originated in consequence of a conversation between Grand Master Hiram Abiff andAdoniram, just before the death of the former. After the Sanctum Sanctorum was completed, and a portion of the furniture deposited therein, Adoniram,on a certain day near high twelve, went there to deposit one of the Holy Vessels. At high twelve, when thecraft were called from labor to refreshment, Adoniram did not retire with the rest, but lingered behind withHiram Abiff, whose custom it was at that hour to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum and offer his devotions toDeity and to draw designs upon the Trestle Board. After the rest of the Craft had retired, Adoniram askedHiram Abiff when he should receive the Master’s Word. He answered, \"I do not know that you will everreceive it, for it is agreed by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre and myself that the Master’sWord can only be given when the Temple is completed, and then only in the presence of all three.\"Adoniram then said, \"Suppose one of you three, even you yourself should be removed by death prior tothat event, how then shall I receive it?\" After commenting on the subject of death, Hiram Abiff with asignificant gesture replied, \"If I die, it will be buried there.\" This conversation having been related to King Solomon by Adoniram, the Master’s Word was deposited inthe Secret Vault, as will be more fully explained to you in the succeeding degree, to which this is apreparatory. After the untimely death of Grand Master Hiram Abiff, the two surviving Grand Masters instituted thisdegree of Royal Master in token of their respect for his memory, and as a partial substitute for the Master"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Mason degree. Being unable to form the triangle in giving the Master’s Word, as one of their number wasdead, they substituted the broken triangle, being the nearest they could come to the original. They first conferred the degree upon the noble Adoniram, and then upon other particular friends of HiramAbiff. As his friend we now confer it upon you, and we give it as illustrative of the Master Mason andRoyal Arch degrees. The furniture of the Sanctum Sanctorum consisted of many Holy Vessels made of pure gold, but the mostimportant article there was the Ark of the Covenant, called the Glory of Israel, which was seated in themidst of the Holy Place under the wings of the Cherubim. It was a small chest, or coffer, three feet nineinches long, two feet three inches wide and deep. It was made of wood excepting only the mercy seat, butoverlaid with gold; both inside and out. It had a ledge of gold surrounding it at the top, into which thecover, called the mercy seat was let in. The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth.At the two ends of it were two Cherubs, looking inward toward each other, with their wings extended;which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy seat, met on each side in the middle; all of which,the Rabbis say, was made out of the same mass without any soldering of parts. Here the Shekina, or Divine Presence, rested and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. Fromhence the Bathkol issued, and gave answers when God was consulted. And hence it is that God is said inthe Scriptures to dwell between the Cherubim; that is between the Cherubim on the mercy seat, becausethere was the Seat or Throne of the visible presence of His Glory among them. IM: This concludes the degree of Royal Master. You will now retire with your conductor, while necessarypreparation is made for the succeeding degree. CC leads the candidates to the west of the altar, where they receive the Prologue. Prologue Companions: The degree you have just received was preparatory to the one that is to follow, but the eventsit pictures occurred prior to those of the Third Degree and those of the Royal Master. As a candidate in the various Masonic degrees, you represented a seeker for Truth symbolized by theMaster’s Word. In the craft degrees this Word was lost when it seemed almost attained. You were given asubstitute with the hope that the true one would be recovered. You again became a seeker for the Word,and in the Chapter degrees it was found. Then the question arose: How was it thus preserved, and howcame it to be in the place where you found it? In the Royal Master degree you had the definite assurance,not given in the Third Degree, that it would be preserved, and you were given a hint as to where it wouldbe buried. In the degree you are about to receive, you will learn how and why it was buried there. In the Select Master degree, Hiram Abiff is still alive and the three original Grand Masters are the principlecharacters in the scenes portrayed. You, as a candidate, will represent Zabud, who was the son of Nathan, and a very close personal friend ofKing Solomon. CC leads the class in giving the signs, IM responds.
