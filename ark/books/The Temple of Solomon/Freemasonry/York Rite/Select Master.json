But I beg Your Majesty to believe that it was not curiosity or disobedience that led me hither,but fervor and zeal in Your Majesty’s service. HKT: Illustrious King Solomon, if this be true, Zabud is not guilty of the charge alleged against him. Hisoffense was owing to an unguarded explanation of your own. He ought to be pardoned and admitted oneof our Select Masters. SKI: My worthy companion of Tyre, how can that be? Is not our number full? HA: ‘Tis true, Illustrious King Solomon, our number is all full, but Ahishar the guard is no longer worthyof our confidence. He is sleeping at his post.

SKI, from his seat: Zabud, my Illustrious companions, being deeply impressed with the zeal you havedisplayed in our service, have, in unison with myself, determined to renew your devotion by admitting youto the secrets of the ninth arch. God has revealed to us in His Word, that this city and Temple which we are now erecting, will, at somefuture period, be destroyed, the nation carried away into captivity, where the worship of the true God will cease for a time among them, and the forms andceremonies which He has enjoined upon us to pursue, will also be forgotten. To avert so dire a calamityfrom the Craft and Jewish people, He has enjoined upon us in His Word to deposit those sacred treasures,which the people most revere, in a secret and secure place, for He has promised us that in three score andten years, He will restore this people to the land which they now inhabit, and He will put it into the heart ofa Prince of the House of Judah to rebuild the Temple to His Holy Name, and He will give him a sign as areward and encouragement for his zeal and fidelity, and the sign shall be the recovery of the Word.. You are fortunate in having come forth at this time, as we are about to make that deposit, and which youwill now have the privilege of witnessing. We will now make the deposit. The 3 GM;s rise, step down from the dias and form a triangle at the Ark, facing the class. SKI takes upscroll or Book of the Law and says: The record of the Book of our Fathers says: reads from ExodusXVI:32­34, \"And Moses said, this is the thing which the Lord commandeth: fill an omer of it to be kept for"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I broughtyou forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, take a pot and put an omer full of mannatherein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, soAaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept.\" SKI hands pot of manna to HKT, and he to HA, who deposits it in the Ark, after HKT has lifted the lid. SKIreads Numbers XVII: 10: \"And the Lord said unto Moses, bring Aaron’s rod again before the testimony, tobe kept for a token.\" Deposit made as before. SKI reads Deut. XXXI:24­26: \"And it came to pass when Moses had made an endof writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites,which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, \"Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the sideof the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.\" SKI takes a key and places it in the Book, saying: Within the Book of the Law, we will place a Key to theCharacters upon the Ark. Deposit is made as before. We will now deposit on the top of the Ark, this triangle containing the Master’s Word or Great and SacredName. Done. And that it may be known that this Ark contains treasures belonging to the craft, we willplace our three squares on the sides of the triangle. After the squares are placed SKI raises his hands and prays: O Lord God of Israel, we ask that Thouprotect and preserve these Sacred Treasures until it pleases Thee to reveal them to future generations.Amen. All is finished. The three Grand Masters resume their stations and are seated. CC seats K, goes to his station and isseated. Lec: In giving the history of this degree, we revert to the building of the Temple, Our three Grand Masters, Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, being inpossession of the writings of Moses and the Prophets, well knew that if the Children of Israel deviated fromthe laws therein contained, their enemies would be let loose upon them, their cities and Temple sacked anddestroyed and all the Sacred Treasures in the Sanctum Sanctorum would be forever lost. In order to preventthis evil, they agreed to erect a secret vault under ground leading from King Solomon’s most retiredapartment and ending under the Sanctum Sanctorum or Holy of Holies. This secret vault was divided into nine arches or apartments. The ninth Arch was erected by our threeGrand Masters as a place wherein to deposit a true copy of all the Holy Vessels and Sacred Treasurescontain in the Sanctum Sanctorum above; also to meet in Grand Council to confer the Master Masondegree when the Temple should be completed. There were employed on the other eight Arches, twenty­two men from Gebal, a city of Phoenicia, together with Ahishar and Adoniram, all of whom were wellskilled in the arts and sciences generally, but particularly in sculpture. Their hours of labor were from nineat night till twelve, the time when prying eyes are closed in sleep. During the erection of this Vault, a circumstance occurred which characterized this degree, and upon whichthe ceremony of initiation is founded. One of King Solomon’s particular friends, whose name was Zabud, discovered that there was a secretwork going on with which he had not been made acquainted and for a long time he grieved in silence. Atlength be complained to King Solomon and received for an answer, \"Be content, friend Zabud, the timewill come when a door shall be open for your reception.\" Meaning that when the Temple should becompleted he should receive the Master Mason degree. This satisfied him. One evening, having some particular business with King Solomon, he went to his most retired room in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"search of him, and finding the door to the Secret Vault open, and not guarded, as usual by the GrandSteward, Ahishar, who was sleeping at his post, he took it for granted that it had been left open for hisreception, whereupon he entered and was dealt with as you have already learned. When the ninth Arch was completed, our three Grand Masters deposited therein an exact imitation of theArk of the Covenant, and placed within it an imitation of the Pot of Manna, and Aaron’s Rod, and also atrue copy of the Book of the Law, or all the writings of the Bible up to that period, and that it might beknown by whom and for what purpose it was deposited, they placed on three sides of the Ark the initials oftheir names, and on the fourth, the time when, meaning, \"Deposited in the year of light 3000, by Solomon,King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre and Hiram Abiff, for the benefit of the Craft in general, but the Jewishnation in particular.\" The Master’s Word was placed on the top of the Ark, engraved on a triangular plate of gold, on the sides ofwhich, in certain mysterious characters were engraved the Key or cover words by which the Master’sWord may be revealed. A key to these characters was placed inside the Ark in the Book of the Law, so thatif the Children of Israel should ever be carried into captivity, and remain so long as to forget their mothertongue, yet on their return, if found, by means of this Key, the Word might be restored; and that it might beknown and distinguished as the Master’s Word when found they placed on the top of the Ark their threeJewels, one on each side of the triangle, knowing that a description thereof would be handed down to thelatest posterity. Thus was preserved the long lost Master’s Word, now the Grand Omnificent Word, orGreat and Sacred Name, which Royal Arch tradition informs us was first communicated by God to Mosesat the Burning Bush and remained in use until near the completion of King Solomon’s Temple. It was then lost at the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, and lay buried in darkness 470 years, when,as you are aware, at the building of the Second Temple after the Babylonish captivity, through the merits ofJeshua, Zerubbabel, and Haggai, it was again restored to the Craft, in whose possession we trust it mayforever remain. I now present you with the Apron of a Select Master. Its color is white bordered in purple. The white isAncient Masonry’s final reminder of that purity of life symbolized in the first Apron you received as anEntered Apprentice; while the purple, the color of kings, exhorts us to rule will our own lives that we maybe numbered with the select nobility who truly practice our Royal Art. The Sword designates us as guardians, whose particular duty is the preservation of those sacred treasureswhich are ours through Masonic heritage. The Trowel reminds us that we are builders, and that our lives should be constructive in their influenceupon the Brotherhood and upon the world. The Broken Triangle speaks to us of mortality – of the uncertainty of our tenure of life, of the importance ofan industrious use of our time and our faculties, and of the place of wages, refreshment and rest whichawaits our entrance through the gate of Death. Enclosing this emblem of our mortal life is the Unbroken Triangle, emblematic of Deity whose love enfoldsus all, whose justice and mercy are alike infinite and alike perfect, and whose Word points the way of lifeimmortal. May you wear this apron with such honor that it may ever distinguish you as a Mason who is truly a SelectMaster. CHG: Companions – Having attained to this degree you have passed the circle of perfection in AncientCraft Masonry. In the capacity of Select Master you must be sensible that your obligations are increased inproportion to your privileges. Let it be your constant care to prove yourself worthy of the high honorconferred, in admitting you to this select degree. Let uprightness and integrity attend your steps; let justice and mercy mark your conduct; let fervency and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"zeal stimulate you in the discharge of the various duties incumbent upon you; but suffer not an idle orimpertinent curiosity to lead you astray, or betray you into danger. Be deaf to every insinuation which would have a tendency to weaken your resolution, or tempt you to anact of disobedience. Be voluntarily dumb and blind, when the exercise of those faculties would endanger the peace of yourmind, or the probity of your conduct; and let silence and secrecy, those cardinal virtues of a Select Master,on all necessary occasions, be scrupulously observed.
