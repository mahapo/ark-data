Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father­in­law, the Priest of Midian, and he led the flock to thebackside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the Lordappeared S1 unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold the bushburned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this greatsight, why the bush is not burnt."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S2 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bushand said: Moses, Moses! And he said: Here am I. And he said: Draw S3 not nigh hither; put off thy shoesform off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, S4 and the God ofJacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. God said unto Moses: Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forthmy people the children of S5 Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God: Behold, when I come unto thechildren of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of you fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shallsay to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses: I AM THAT I AM;and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. Moses was faithful to the Divine Command, and thus became the great emancipator, prophet, leader andjudge of the children of Israel. He led his people out of bondage, through the wilderness tot he border of thepromised land, where on Nebo’s lonely mountain, his eyes undimmed by age and his natural S6 forceunabated, God took him. Joshua became their leader. They entered the promised land. Here they becam agreat nation. Mighty kings and the world’s greatest prophets and teachers rose among them. As long asthey were faithful to God, they prospered, but when the children of Israel forgot and forsook God, nationalruin came upon them. S7 Zedekiah, the last King of Judah, was one and twenty years old when he began his reign, and reignedeleven years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humblednot himself before Jeremiah, the prophet, speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelledagainst King Nebuchadnezzar, and stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LordGod of Israel. S8 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominationsof the heathen; and polluted the House of the Lord, which he had hollowed in Jerusalem. And the LordGod of S9 their fathers sent to them by his messengers; because he had compassion on his people, and onhis dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused hisprophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy. S10 Therefore, he brought upon them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the swordin the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him thatstooped for age; he gave them all into his hands. And all the vessels of the House of God, great and small,and the treasures of the S11 King and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. My brethren, we now represent descendants of those Most Excellent Masters who were present at thedestruction of the Temple by S12 Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who besieged the city, burned theHouse of God, destroyed the Holy vessels thereof, and the residue of the people that escaped the sword hecarried away as captives to Babylon. Here in Babylon our ancestors died, here in captivity we were born,and the rebuilding of the House of the Lord S13 seems afar off. When Cyrus was King of Persia, he issueda decree saying: \"the Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of earth; and he hath chargedme to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of his people? His Godbe with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the House of the Lord God ofIsrael.\" Our enemies in Judah and the poverty of our people have prevented the fulfillment of our fondest hope. Butthe dawn of the great day when a new temple shall arise in Jerusalem S14 is near, for Darius, havingascended the throne, has given commandment that the people be not hindered, and that expenses be paidout of the King’s treasury for the rebuilding of the Temple. We are needed to assist in the noble andglorious work of rebuilding the city and Temple of our God. S15 Shall we go up? Will you? Will you go"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"up? We will go up and the prophesy of Jeremiah will be fulfilled when he said that \"after seventy years beaccomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you S16 in causing you toreturn to this place.\" And, remembering the symbol of the burning bush, which is to impress upon ourminds in the most solemn manner that the words and signs following are of Divine institution, and as suchmust be sacredly regarded by us and transmitted to our posterity as means by which they may be knownand distinguished forever after, let us also remember the words of the Lord which we will give to ourbrethren in Jerusalem, \"I AM hath sent me unto you.\" Let us commence our journey from Babylon to Jerusalem. Projector off. Here begins the Journey. Exit with K, add additional C if available, up to nine may be used. All will remove shoes and socks and rollup pants legs. C will be bound together with halter ropes, each placing one hand on the shoulder of the Cin front. PS, RAC and M1V will lead. Other Companions may assist as necessary. While C are beingprepared, lodge room is set up for the journey. PS: Thanks be unto God we are once more without the walls of the wicked and abominable city –Babylon. We have left its domes and spires behind us, and I can just see them glittering in the sunlight over the hillsand plains of Chaldea. Our trust is in the Great I AM, and although our journey may be long, tedious and dreary, our path rough,rugged and dangerous, yet we will endeavor to overcome every obstacle, endure every hardship and braveevery danger, to promote the noble and glorious work upon which we have entered. Brethren, here the routes diverge, one leading through the desert of Arabia, the other up the Euphrates, andaround by the way of Anath, Tadmore and Damascus. The desert may be less frequented by travelersowing to its extensive sandy plains, its intense heat and great scarcity of provisions and water. The other ismuch more pleasant, though longer and mountainous. There are hardships and dangers in each, but I think,all things considered the river route is most desirable. Let us pursue it. Moving toward Companions with branches. As C pass, branches are presented near their feet and heads,causing them to step over some and duck under others. The recent inundation of the valley seems to have brought trees or limbs and other obstructions down fromthe mountains and deposited them directly in across our pathway. There seems to be no choice bu to goover some and under those which have lodged higher. It is a dangerous pass; but our trust is in the Great IAM and if we are careful we will soon be safely through. Be careful, Brethren, Stoop beneath that limb; now over this – now under that – Ah! We are safely past. Move to east of lodge room where artificial grass is set up. Seat the C and provide with water and fruit. We are now on the grassy banks of the ever­running Euphrates. How beautiful the scenery around us! Wewill tarry here for a while and rest and refresh ourselves. Sit down Brethren. Here is some cool water fromthe river and fruit that grew on its fertile banks. Eat and drink while you listen to a portion of AncientHistory. On this river was built Babylon, the Chief City of the Chaldees, it was situated on both sides of theEuphrates, being connected, however, by a bridge of wondrous construction. This city, from the splendor and magnificence of its public edifices and its immense wealth, became the seatof empire, and was the wonder and admiration of all beholders. History, both sacred and profane, informsus that Cyrus, King of Persia, with his victorious armies, besieged the city, and after having invested it fortwo years, finally took it by strategy, in this manner. He caused ditches to be dug on either side of the city, into which he turned the waters of the Euphrates,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"thereby draining the bed of the river dry, through which he marched his victorious armies, and burstingthrough the tunnels, at midnight the assembled before the gates of the king’s palace; and those of theBabylonians who escaped the sword were doomed to captivity. But not having time to dwell further on this interesting portion of Ancient History, arise, Brethren, let us begoing. PS, RAC & M1V remove fruit and water and assist K’s to rise and get back in line. PS: We have left the river and are traversing the Syrian Desert. We have come to the ruins of Tadmor inthe wilderness. It was situated in the midst of a vast and arid plain – an oasis – a green spot in the desert. Itshigh antiquity and almost countless remains of former architectural beauty and splendor with which it stillabounds, have rendered it the wonder and admiration of all beholders. The city is now waste and desolateand naught awakens the echoes in its empty courts and ruined palaces save the cry of the jackal and thehyena. For years caravans have stopped at the oasis on their long journeys from the Euphrates to theMediterranean and from the mountains of Lebanon to the Red Sea. Two Companions with swords and shields make a loud clanging noise by striking sword on shield, yellinghoarsely as they do so. Stop! What is that I see? Two caravans engaged in combat; let us go around and avoid them. PS speeds upand moves around to the bridge. That was a narrow escape, and it has brought us into an abandoned path.The old bridge over this ravine appears to be unsafe. Stop! Let me examine it. Examines the bridge bylifting one end and letting it fall to make a crashing sound. It is nearly gone, but by care we may cross it. Let us make the attempt. Be careful! The bridge trembles but we will soon be safely over. It seems ready tofall – be careful! Be careful! Ah! We are safely over! K’s are lead over the bridge carefully. Two companions, stationed at either end make the bridge wobbleand shake. When last C is across, the bridge collapses. We are now approaching the flourishing city of Damascus. Through the long lapse of centuries it hasexperienced the various vicissitudes incident to wars and revolutions; but while cities, kingdoms andempires have arisen, flourished, fulfilled their destiny and fallen, this venerable city still survives – hertowers still pointing heavenward. Now we journey toward the south. To the right we may see the Lebanon forest, where our fathers felledand prepared timbers for the first Temple. We are now on the plains of the Jordan and will soon be in sight of the river itself. We are weary, andalthough borne up by the nearness of our journey’s end, we feel almost overwhelmed and desolate, lest theenemies and robbers of this infested route should, at the last, cut off all hope of final success. Stops to instruct K. Here is the ford through the Jordan leading to Jericho that fell before Joshua’s conquering hosts. Come; let us attempt the passage. Now we enter the Jordan. Its waters are not cold, but yonder banks seemsto be covered with rough stones and rocks, so be careful! K’s are lead into the river and across, closely watched by attending companions. Brethren, be careful! We are at last safely over and soon will be near to our beloved Jerusalem. Rough and rugged has been the road, long and toilsome the march, but sustained and favored by the GreatI AM, we are at last near our journey’s end.

PS steps forward one pace while talking: Excellent Grand Council, agreeable to your orders we repaired to the place designated by the Captain ofthe Host, and there began our labors. We wrought diligently for several days among broken columns andruined arches without discovering anything of importance. At length, one of my brethren struck with hiscrow what seemed to be an impenetrable rock, but which gave forth a hollow sound. We redoubled ourexertions, and upon removing the rubbish, discovered an arch, in the vertex of which was a curiouslywrought stone, which with considerable difficulty, we succeeded in raising. Deeming this of importance,we have brought it up for your inspection. The keystone is presented to the HP. Grand Council consults, then HP says: HP: The Grand Council recognizes this as the keystone of an arch, wrought by our Grand Master, HiramAbiff. This is a valuable discovery, and from its position in the arch, it will doubtless lead to furtherdiscoveries. Are you willing to descend into the vault beneath the Arch? PS: To promote the noble and glorious work of rebuilding our city and the House of the Lord, we arewilling to descend into the vault beneath the Arch, although the descent be attended with difficulty anddanger. HP: Then go Brethren, and be mindful of our injunction. PS gives commands, \"Right Face\", and \"Follow Me\".

Should you wish to descend, signal withthe left hand; to ascend, signal with the right. Should you find anything of importance, signal to ascend andwe will draw you up. C is lowered into the vault to retrieve the Ark. On signal to ascend he is drawn back up. Brethren, the workmen whom you represent repaired to the scene of their labors and one of their number,volunteering to descend into the vault, they widened the aperture and let him down, first taking theprecaution of placing a cable tow seven times around his body, he holding a rope in each hand, with theinstructions that should he wish to descend to signal with his left hand; to ascend, to signal with his righthand. He gave the signal to ascend, and they drew him forth, he bringing with him a curiously wrought boxwith three squares lying thereon; and mindful of the injunction they took them up for inspection.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. AndGod said: Let there be light, and there was light.\" Pauses for effect, as if thinking. Let us read further from this ancient book. \"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until theywere finished, that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,saying: Take this BOOK OF THE LAW, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord yourGod, that it may be there for a witness against thee.\" Rolls up the scroll.

Salutes with hand, HP acknowledges: I am unable to read the inscriptions on the box; they are in charactersto me unknown. Returns to his station, remains standing, facing south. HP examining the Book of the Law, finds a key: In the Book of the Law I find what appears to be a key.Let us apply it. HP, K & S rise together, and descend one step. In council, they compare the key to the characters withoutwalking around the ark. Brethren, the Grand Council is of the opinion that this most valuable discovery is an imitation of the Ark ofthe Covenant, containing a true copy of the Book of the Law, imitations of a pot of manna and of Aaron’srod, and a piece of parchment, having on it apparently a key, by means of which we may be able to readthe characters. The original Ark of the Covenant, built by Moses, Aholiab, and Bezaleel, disappeared whenthe Temple was destroyed. As the Ark of the Covenant was the symbol of the Divine Presence with, andprotection of, the Jewish people, and a pledge of the stability of their nation, as long as they obeyed thecommands of God, so is this copy of the Ark a symbol of God’s presence with us as long as we live inconformity to the precepts contained in the Book of the Law. HP, K & S descend to floor and pass around the box, counter clockwise, K in the lead, followed by HP &S. They compare the characters to the key in HP’s hand. When they have made a full circuit, they return totheir original position. HP will read the characters, pointing them out without touching the box. By this key we are enabled to read these mysterious characters. On this side is inscribed S K I; on this end, H K T; on this end, H A; on this side, AL 3000, meaningdeposited in the year of Light 300 by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, forthe benefit of the Craft in general, but the Jewish Nation in particular. Pauses, looking at the top of the box, studies it and the key, then in surprise says: And on the top, engraved in a triangular plate of gold, is the long lost Master’s Word, which was lost uponthe death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff and which the faithful Craft were to receive when futuregenerations should discover it. We will now invest you with this Word. CH forms groups, passing from his station to the rear of the C, and takes position to left of HP.

HP: An explanation of the Key by means of which we were enabled to read the characters on the box willbe given to you by Companion .... KeyTradition informs us there was a secret vault under the Temple in which our three ancient Masters met anddeposited many treasures belonging to the Craft. It was closed after the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff and in time its location was forgotten untildiscovered by three brethren from the Babylonian captivity during the building of the second Temple. You have represented then today and you have also rediscovered the vault and again brought to light thetreasures therein concealed. The characters in this alphabet can be made with two squares and a mallet. The Key shows the charactersarranged in alphabetical order. There are thirteen characters with dots and thirteen without dots. The dotsrepresent the use of the mallet to indicate that the characters belong to the last half of the alphabet. The Keyis read from left to right. The Master’s Word is composed of four Hebrew Characters, corresponding in our language to JHVH, andcannot be pronounced without the aid of vowels which are supplied by the Key or covering words whichare found on the sides of the triangle in the characters of the Royal Arch key. The Hebrew characters JHVH are in the center of the triangle and are read from right to left. As Hebrew is"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"read from right to left, the characters on the sides of the triangle will be read in that manner in searching forthe vowels which enable us to pronounce the Word. Applying the Key we find on this side B .., containing the vowel \" \"; on this side O .., containing the vowel\" \"; on this side J ... containing the vowel \" \". Placing these vowels in order between the Hebrewcharacters in the center of the triangle we are enabled to pronounce the Master’s Word, the name the Jewswere not permitted to pronounce. The key or covering words, when combined form a word of three syllables, which has become the GrandRoyal Arch Word. As these words, when so combined, form the Grand Royal Arch Word, written in theRoyal Arch key, they are read from left to right. You have solemnly sworn that you will not communicate either of these words, except in the presence ofthree, by three times three, under a living arch and over a triangle, also that you will not unlawfully make,reveal or retain the key to the mysterious characters of this degree and will destroy it immediately afterusing it. Complying with this obligation this will now be destroyed. HP: The step, due guard and sign, and the working tools of this degree will now be explained to you by.... ToolsI will now explain to you the step, due guard and sign of a Royal Arch Mason. You were taught toadvance one step with your left foot, bringing the heel of the right to the heel of the left, forming an angleof a square. The due guard and sign of a Royal Arch Mason are given by placing the right hand against the forehead,palm downward, then drawing across the forehead and dropping your hand to your side. It alludes to thepenalty of the obligation, where reference is made to having your skull smote off. The working tools of this degree are the Crow, the Pickaxe, and the Spade. The Crow is used by operativeMasons to raise things of great weight and bulk; the Pickaxe to loosen the soil, and prepare it for digging;and the Spade to remove rubbish. But the Royal Arch Mason is emblematically taught to use them for morenoble purposes. By then he is reminded that it is his sacred duty to lift from his mind the heavy weight ofpassions and prejudices which encumber his progress toward virtue, loosening the hold which long habitsof sin and folly may have had upon his disposition, and removing the rubbish of vice and ignorance, whichprevents him from beholding that eternal foundation of truth and wisdom upon which he is to erect thespiritual and moral temple of his second life. In addition to the Crow, Pickaxe and Spade, are the Squareand Compass, which have been presented to your view in every degree of Freemasonry through which youhave passed. The Square teaches us as Royal Arch Masons that God has made all things square, uprightand perfect. The Compass is used by operative Masons to describe circles, every part of which is equally near andequally distant from the center. The Circle is, therefore a striking emblem of the relation in which thecreature stands to his Creator. As every part of the circumference of a circle is equally near and equallydistant from its center, so is every creature whom God has made, to Him equally near and equally distant. The equilateral or perfect Triangle is an emblem of the three essential attributes of Deity, namelyOmnipresence, Omniscience and Omnipotence; and as the three equal sides or equal angles form but onetriangle, so these three equal attributes constitute but one GOD. Excellent High Priest, the duty is performed."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"HP: The Apron of this degree will be presented to you by .... ApronI now present you with the Apron of a Royal Arch Mason.

The Triple Tau in a triangle, within a circle, is the emblem of emblems of a Royal Arch Mason, typifyingthe Sacred Name, the Author of Eternal Life. It is worn as a mark of distinction, separating us who knowand worship the true Name from those who are ignorant of this august mystery. May you wear it as onewho, knowing and believing, may find in it the highest hope and faith ever given to man. HP: The Historical Lecture will be presented by .... LectureMy Companions, having passed through the ceremonies of this degree, may we express the hope that it isnot an idle or vain curiosity that merely grasps at novelty which has induced you to receive this sublimedegree of Freemasonry, far more important than all which have preceded it. It is calculated to impress uponour minds a firm belief in the Being and existence of God, it teaches a due reverence for His Great andHoly name. It also brings to light some of the most important secrets of the Craft which lay buried indarkness from the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff to the erection of the second Temple, andwithout which the Masonic character is not complete. The degree of the Royal Arch is founded upon thedestruction of the first and the building of the second Temple. The ceremonies of this degree have an interesting and graphic historical setting, and a profound andreverential moral significance. The Royal Arch degree is the complement of the Master Mason degree, theunfolding into a second volume the history of that which was lost to its final recover. Without the RoyalArch, the Master mason degree is like a song half sung, a tale partly told, or a promise unfulfilled. The history of the 418 years from the completion of the first Temple to its destruction by Nebuchadnezzaris filled with the glories, the triumphs, the final fall and degradation of the Kingdom of Judah, and thedispersion and loss of the Kingdom of Israel, and their enslavement in Babylon. Forty­eight years after the destruction of the first Temple, in the first year of his reign, Cyrus, King ofPersia, issued an edit granting permission to the captives to return to their own land and to rebuild theTemple of their God. In this degree you represented three of these Hebrew captives, who, rejoicing in their newly foundfreedom, made their toilsome and weary march over rough and rugged roads from Babylon to Jerusalem,and having proven worthy, were admitted into the presence of the Grand Council as three weary sojournersfrom Babylonian captivity, who had come hither to assist in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding thecity and House of the Lord without the hope of fee or reward. You expressed a willingness to undertakeany portion of that work, however humble it might be. You began your labors, during which certainimportant discoveries were made, the chief of which was the long lost Master’s Word. And, my Companions, if, in all these things, you have seen only a series of unmeaning rites – if the spirit oftruth has not applied to your hearts the morals of these ceremonies – then, indeed, have we labored in vain,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and you have spent your strength for naught. But I am persuaded to believe better things of you.

No one can reflect on the ceremonies of gaining admission into this place without being forcibly struckwith the important lessons which they teach.
