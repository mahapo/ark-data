[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Ritual of Knight of Malta Iowa2003Pro, given prior to the start of the Order: The Order of Malta in the York Rite system serves as thepreparatory degree for the fusion of two great institutions – Ancient Craft Masonry and Christianity. This Order originated in the 11th Century, A.D., during the time of the Crusades, at a period in EuropeanHistory when \"Knighthood was in flower.\" Christianity, by tat time having spread and gained a strongfoothold throughout Europe and the British Isles, had a particularly strong appeal to the nobility as well asto the common masses. For the Knight of that period saw in the life, work and teachings of Jesus, the selfsacrifice, the helpfulness to the weak and the oppressed, the glad, willing and consecrated service to Godand man which should characterized true knighthood. In other words, they found Jesus to be the mirror ofchivalry, the ideal pattern of the true knightly, valiant and magnanimous life. The Order was originally established to give protection and assistance to pilgrims on their journey to visitthe scared places of the Holy Land. So effectively did these Knights perform their tasks, they not onlygained the respect, the admiration and the support of the heads of governments, but also the support of theheads of governments, but also the support of the Church and the blessing of Popes. The Orders grew and prospered in both fame and fortune and Priories were eventually establishedthroughout Christendom. During the centuries that followed, they led a turbulent existence by becoming involved, of necessity, in thequarrels of Emperors and Popes and in the various religious wars which erupted from time to time. A more detailed account of their history will be revealed as you pass through the ceremonies of the Order. We have learned that Ancient Craft Masonry does not concern itself with sectarian religion – it onlydemands the belief in a Supreme Being. Since Masonry requires a belief in God and Christianity also demands a belief in God, it follows that thesetwo great institutions have much in common. In uniting the two the York Rite still adheres tone of thegreatest tenets of Masonry by refusing to make any distinction among Christians of any particular sect orcreed. Christian Masonry is concerned with the humble, whole­hearted, devoted and consecrated service to Godand man as exemplified in the life, work and teachings of Jesus and is not concerned with the intellectualacceptance of any system of doctrines or dogmas. It is Christianity in its purest and simplest form – unbiased and unprejudiced."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Officers line up in the preparation room and enter as soft music plays.

Knight Marshal, Mar rises, you will instruct the newly made Knight of Malta. Mar Goes south of the Altar to K’s right and escorts him to a seat with the class in the south of the room, thenproceeds with the lecture. The history of this Ancient and Chivalric Order is closely associated with the history of medieval Europeand the Near East from the 11th to the 16th centuries. During that period Empires rose and fell, manypolitical and religious wars were fought and the Order, being religious in character and dependent upongovernments for support and assistance, was directly affected by the fortunes of Emperors and Popes andled a turbulent and sometimes precarious existence; being forced to evacuate its home on several occasionsand seek to establish itself in another location. The dates and names on the different ceremonial banners indicate the times and locations where the Orderestablished itself during those years of sojourning. It is worthy to note that the Passwords on the banners, while expressive of events in the history of theOrder, also indicate the important periods and events in the life of Jesus. Bir This Order was founded at Jerusalem in the year of our Lord 1099, by the association of a number of piousKnights with the fraters of St. John’s Hospital, an establishment previously formed for the relief of pilgrimswho had come to worship at the Holy Sepulcher. The name and date upon the white banner, \"Birth,\" \"Palestine, 1099,\" commemorates the country of ourSavior’s nativity; the place where the Order was founded, and the first epoch in its history. Lif After a troubled existence of two hundred years I the Holy Land, and being deprived by the wars raging inEurope of needed and looked for assistance, the Order was compelled to evacuate Palestine, and in 1287 itestablished itself on the Island of Cyprus, and settled in Limisso. The name and date upon the red banner,\"Life,\" \"Cyprus, 1287,\" commemorates the second place of their sojourning, and the second epoch in their"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"history. De In 1310, the Island of Rhodes became the property of the Order by right of conquest from the Saracens.Here they established themselves so firmly that they were able to maintain their possession form more thantwo hundred years, and the remains of the fortifications erected there by the Knights, still bear testimony totheir engineering skill and ability. In 1522 the Island of Rhodes was besieged by the Turks, and after a memorable defense, their fortificationsbeing reduced to ruins, scarcely one stone remaining standing upon another, they were compelled tosurrender and evacuate the island. For the next seven years the Order ceased to exist as a sovereign power.Hence the name and date, \"Death,\" \"Rhodes, 1310\" upon the black banner. Res From 1523 to 1530 the remnants of the Order wandered from place to place without a home. They wentfirst to the Island of Candia where they attempted to reunite and reestablish themselves as a sovereignpower. Hence the name and date, \"Resurrection,\", \"Candia,\" 1523 upon the purple banner. Asc In 1530, after seven years of homeless wanderings, the Island of Malta was ceded to the Order by theEmperor, Charles V, upon condition that they would defend it and repress the ravages of the Moorishrovers who at that time infested the southern ports of the Mediterranean Sea. Accordingly they tookpossession of the Island, became known as \"Knights of Malta\", and rose to their greatest heights of powerand influence. Hence the name and date, \"Ascension,\" \"Malta, 1530\" on the yellow banner. Mar The legend connected with the approach of the Knights to their final and most renowned abiding place hasgiven rise to the distinguishing Sign and Word of the Order. The tradition is, that on coming to takepossession of the Island, the Knights approached the shore in their Galleys, two men to an oar, the oars intheir left hands and their swords in their right hands, singing a psalm as they rowed, in these words, \"RexRegum et Dominus Doominorum\" – \"King of Kings and Lord of Lords\". The Islanders, seeing themapproach in this warlike manner, hailed them through a speaking trumpet, saying in the Arabic language:\"Ah tie toom bis sah Lamh?\" (\"Do you come in peace?\") To which the Knights responsed in the sametongue, \"Ah tie nah bis sah lahm\". (\"We come in peace.\") Then the Islanders responded: \"Fa two bis sahlahm.\" (\"Then come in peace.\") It is worthy of note that these words or substantially the same, are thecommon form of salutation between an Arab and a stranger at the present day. The Mediterranean Pass, which you received in the introductory degree of Knight of St. Paul, traditioninforms us, was instituted at an early period of the Order to enable pilgrims on their way to the Holy Landto recognize each other, and as a protection against the Moorish rovers who infested the Mediterranean Seaand Palestine. There exists within the Order as it has developed, two ceremonials – the American ceremonial and theEuropean ceremonial – and the tables, pointing to them, one in the East, the other in the West represent thepresentation of union between the two. Causes the class to rise and conducts them to a position facing the table in the east. The officers representing the American Ceremonial are seated at the Table in the East, on which isrepresented the upper and transverse limbs of a Latin Cross. Their naked swords, when deposited on thetable, all point to tone spot – the center – where the heart of our Saviour rested when he suffered upon theCross. This is symbolic in a degree of the Christian character of the Order. The number five alsosymbolically reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, and of His five wounds upon the Cross. The number is again repeated in the rounds of the ladder depicted in one of the quarters of the circle upon"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the Cross on the table in the West. Conducts class to a position facing the table in the west. As class halt at the table in the West, the eight Knights seated there rise, take up their swords and come tocarry. There are eight Knights seated at the table in the West. According to the European Ceremonial, theseKnights are officers of the Priory. They represent the eight languages into which the Order was formerlydivided, which were: Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon, Germany, Castile, and Anglo­Bavaria. The table at which these Knights are seated has depicted upon it a large Maltese Cross, on the center ofwhich is a circle, divided into four equal quartering by two transverse bars crossing each other at rightangles in the center. Each of the four quarters of the circle has a figure depicted upon it. A ship or ancient galley. A ladder, with five rounds or steps, with the letters B, L, D, R, A, one on each step, and a speakingtrumpet. A hand and a serpent. A human skull, cloven in twain from the top with a double­edged sword, and a spear beneath it. The galley reminds us of the maritime character of the ancient Order, both in war and commerce. The letters on the steps of the ladder correspond with those of the five ceremonial banners, and are theinitial letters of the passwords on those banners. The hand and serpent reminds us of the history of St. Paul in connection with the Island of Malta. The human skull, cloven by the two­edged sword, reminds us of the penalty that was inflicted upon traitorsto the Order in ancient times. The spear again reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Savior, for withsuch an instrument they pierced his side. Mar: I will now direct your attention to the Grand Banners of the Order, of which there are two: theBanner of St. John, and that of Malta. About, FACE. Class turns about to face banners. StJ: The Banner of St. John is red, having painted upon it a white Greek Cross, the bars of the Crossextending to the edge of the banner, and on the center of the Cross a \"Paschal Lamb.\" The letters F, E, R, T are also on the banner, one in each quarter. These are the initial letters of the fourwords in the Latin sentence, \"Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit\", which in English is \"His courage preservedRhodes.\" According to a tradition of the Order, these letters upon the banner had their origin during theGrand Mastership of Villeret, early in the fifteenth century. In 1415 the Turks laid siege to Rhodes, the newhome of the Order, and were repulsed by the brave Christian Knights. Amadeus V, Duke of Savoy, havingrendered timely and valuable assistance to the besieged Knights Hospitalers during this attack, the GrandMaster, in commemoration thereof, caused the letters to be added to the Banner of St. John. Thedescendents of the Duke Amadeus have, since that time always borne on their shield a white cross, with theword FERT as a device; the word being composed of the initial letters of the Latin words, as beforedescribed. M: The Maltese Banner is black, having upon it a silver or white Maltese Cross, with a Cross of St. Johnon a small shield resting on the center. Around the Cross the legend, \"Rex Regum et DominusDominorum,\" King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\" Music, \"Gloria in Excelsia\".
