Charity was taught you as a Mark Master, Moderation as a Past Master, your industry wasrewarded as a Most Excellent Master, and when you passed under the Living Arch you received a lesson inhumility. When you were created a Companion of the Red Cross you were impressed with the almightyforce and the importance of Truth. When you were admitted a Knight of Malta you were instructed to bezealous and vigilant for the honor of Knighthood. While the world is shut out, meditate upon these things, and prepare your heart for the solemn ceremoniesthrough which you will be called to pass. There lies on the table before you a melancholy memento ofmortality. Beside it is an hourglass, which I now reverse. Done As you behold its slowly falling sands, learn that sosurely are the wasting sands of your mortal life running out to death. There is also on this table the Holy Bible, which is opened at the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. Ienjoin upon you at this time the reading of the thirteenth to the sixteenth verses inclusive of that chapter.When you shall have concluded the reading you will discover three Questions, to which your explicitanswers are required in writing. Reflect on them, and then answer each with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\",according to the dictates of your conscience. Then sigh your name in full, to each of them. I am now about to leave you alone, and will signal my departure by three knocks upon the door. Hearingthem, you will remove the hoodwink, and proceed as I have directed. When you shall have concluded, givethree knocks and I will attend you. JW gives three knocks and candidates proceed as directed.

In childish innocence he played; along the paths of youth he strayed. Having like us, his hopes and fears; His hours of joy, perchance of tears. And when to man’s estate he grew; The feelings we know, he knew. We know not where or when he wrought; What visions dreamed, what aims he sought. Ambitions call he may have heard; Mayhap, his heart by love was stirred. Or a greed of gold he may have felt; Or at the shrine of passion knelt. This much we know, and nought beside; That he was born and lived and died. It may have been his lot to toil; to delve in mines or till the soil. He may have sailed the trackless seas; or felt the heat of dessert breeze. Or a priestly grab he may have worn; or weight of public office borne. But poor or priestly, rich or great; he came at last to this sad estate. With reverence then, behold with me; That which we all must sometime be, And as we near the dread abyss Of death, when we shall be like this, But unto those whose faith remains, Death does not sever earthly chains, Our spirit freed from this poor clod, Is but to sleep, to wake with GOD. EC moves back to apex: Pilgrim, you here behold an emblem of mortality supported by divinity, a humanskull resting on the Holy Bible; which is to teach you that amid all the trials and vicissitudes incident tohuman life, a firm reliance upon the divine truth contained in this Sacred Volume can alone afford thatconsolation and peace of mind, which the world can neither give nor take away.

Move back down the south side of the triangle, reach over and pick up skull. Behold this ruin! ‘tis a skull, Once of ethereal spirit full. This narrow cell was life’s retreat, This space was thought’s mysterious seat. What beauteous visions filled this spot, What dream of pleasure long forgot. Nor joy, nor grief, nor hope, nor fear, Has left one trace on record here. Beneath this moldering canopy; Once shone the bright and busy eye; Yet start not at the dismal void! If holy love that eye employed, If with no lawless fire it gleamed; But through the dews of kindness beamed, That eye shall be foreverbright; When stars and sun are sunk in night. Within this hollow cavern hung; The ready, swift and tuneful tongue; If falsehood’s honey it distained; And when it could not praise, was chained; If bold in virtue’s cause it spoke; Yet gentle concord never broke, That silent tongue may plead for thee; When time unveils eternity. How striking this emblem of Mortality! Once animated like ourselves, but now, behold, it has ceased to actor think; its vital energies are extinct, and all the powers of life have ceased their operation!

Come, see the place where the Lord lay,\" (Matt.

EP moving slowly toward the K from corner nearRec’s station, around the south side of the triangle tot a point east of the StB’s station, midway between theK and the triangle while saying: EP: \"I am the resurrection and the life,\" saith the Lord: \"he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yetshall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\" (John XI: 25,26) And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands raises his hands and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.\" (LukeXXIV: 50,51) A hymn may be played or sung at this point. Pilgrim, the scene you have just witnessed is intended to remind you of the glorious conclusion of thathallowed sacrifice offered by the Redeemer of the world to provide a way of salvation to fallen man. This sacred book shows K the Bible he is carrying in his hand informs us that our Blessed Savior, aftersuffering the pains of death, descended into the place of departed spirits; that on the third day He burst thebands of death, triumphed over the grave, and in due time ascended with transcendent majesty into heaven,where He now sits at the right hand of our Heavenly Father, a Mediator and Intercessor for all those whohave faith in Him. I now invest you with an emblem of that faith EP places a small black cross tied with on a black ribbonaround the K’s neck. It is also a badge of our Order, which you will wear as a constant memorial tostimulate you to imitate the virtues of the Immaculate Jesus, who died that you might live. Pilgrim, the ceremonies in which you are now engaged are intended to deeply impress your mind, and Itrust they will have a happy and lasting effect upon your life and character. EP: You were first, as a trial of your patience and perseverance, required to perform Seven Years ofPilgrimage. It represented the great pilgrimage of life through which you are now passing. We are all wearypilgrims, anxiously looking forward to that Asylum above, where we shall rest from our labors, and be at"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"peace forever. You were next, as a trial of your courage and constancy, required to perform Four Years of Warfare. It wasto remind you of that continual warfare with the lying deceits and vanities of the world, in which it isnecessary for you always to be engaged. You are now performing One Year of Penance, as a trial of your humility. Of this our Blessed Savior hasleft us the only perfect example; who, though He was the Eternal Son of God, humbled Himself to be bornof a woman, to endure the pains and sorrows incident to human life, and finally to suffer the cruel andignominious death of the cross. The penance is also a trial of that faith which will conduct you safely through the dark valley of the shadowof death, and land your enfranchised spirit in the peaceful abodes of the blessed. Pilgrim, ever keep in mind this solemn truth: you know not how soon you may be called upon to render anaccount unto the Supreme Judge, from whom the minutest act of your life is not hidden. Although you nowstand erect in all the pride and strength of manhood, yet in a few brief moments you may be cold in death.This moment, even while I speak, the angel of death may receive the dread mandate to strike you from theroll of the living; and the friends who now surround you be called upon to perform the last sad duty oflaying you in the earth, a banquet for worms, and this frail body becomes as the relic you hold in you hand.Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is cutdown: he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. In the mist of life we are in death; of whom may weseek for succor but of Thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased! Yet O Lord God, most holy, OLord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Savior, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.\" \"And I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord fromhenceforth: Yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" Pilgrim, be you always ready, and rest assured that a firm faith in the truth herein revealed, and a childliketrust in our crucified and ascended Savior, will not only afford you consolation in the gloomy hour ofdissolution, but will also secure you ineffable and eternal happiness in the world to come. Farewell! Ever remember the hallowed sacrifice on Calvary. SW & JW step up beside the K and conduct him eastward, returning to the Asylum over the same routeused in entering.
