However men may differ in creed, yet all men agree that within the pages of the Holy Bible are found thoseprinciples which lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Leads K to altar, SD following, staying behind K. Freemasonry would take all men by the hand and, leading them to its Altar, would point to the open Bibleand urge each to faithfully direct his steps through life by the light he shall find therein. If from our sacredAltar the atheist or irreligious man should ever wrest this Book and thus remove, or even obscure the GreatLight of Freemasonry, that Light which has been for centuries the rule and guide of all Masons, then couldwe no longer claim the proud title and rank of Master Mason; but as long as that sacred Light shines uponour Altar, as long as it illumines and brightens the pathway of the craftsman by the golden rays of truth, solong will Freemasonry live and shed its beneficent influence among men. Guard, then, my brother, thissacred Book as you guard your life. Defend it as you would defend the flag of your county. Live accordingto its sublime precepts.

With RWM on north of K and SD onsouth. RWM takes K by grip of PM, while SD takes K by reverse grip. Masonic tradition informs us that when KS became infirm, he was assisted in taking his seat and risingtherefrom, by means of this grip, given by two faithful Giblites. Seats K. SD returns to place. As KingSolomon wore a crown as an emblem of royal dignity, so, as a mark of distinction, and agreeably to anancient custom, you, as a Master, are to be covered while presiding over a lodge. RWM removes his hatand covers K. I now present you with the working tool of a Master. Done. It is the gavel, your emblem ofauthority. Use it wisely and justly, never in the cause of injustice or oppression. Scottish ChargeRWM: I will now instruct you in the use of the gavel. One knock gives 1 knock brings up the juniorofficers. Two knocks given brings up the Junior and Senior Wardens. Three knocks given brings up thecraft. To seat the craft, knock once given. Let me see ­ you have the master's jewel, you are covered withthat mark of distinction that all masters have worn before you, and you have been instructed on the use ofthe gavel. I think my job is finished. Goodbye and good luck! Argument ensues. After suitable time, RWM prompts K to give one rap. Removes hat from K and takesover presiding. Prompts K to say: K: The Past Masters will form a semi­circle in the East. Lec: My Brother, it would be unfair of me to ask you to stand alone during the trying moments which areabout to experience. You have occupied a position of high honor in Freemasonry, of which you might well be proud. Uponassuming this responsible office you were, as you will recall specifically charged to rule with moderationand decorum, guarding as you would your life, that Great Light in Freemasonry. Upon being inducted into a representation of the Oriental Chair, which is a seat of power, once occupiedby King Solomon, a brief prayer was offered up, that a portion of his wisdom descend and rest upon you.You were instructed in the use of the gavel and the various duties of a Master, at the conclusion of which,you were placed in charge of the lodge. How well you have fulfilled this obligation is for us to decide. Your facial expressions betray your thoughts, but lest they be embarrassing or humiliating causing you torebel within, let us picture for you your present state of mind. As the sun bursts forth in all its glory from behind the dark foreboding storm clouds of early morning, andmelts their terrors into a beautiful sea of blue, bidding us rise and view a perfect day, so now the sunlight ofreason bids you rise to the occasion and view yourself in that mirror of perfect understanding."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Your smile informs me that you have reasoned now, that this has been a test. Your intuition has probablytold you that these heated arguments might not have been the sincere realities they appeared to be, and infact, I doubt if you will find the slightest ill­will existing among these Past Masters whom you have heard inthese misleading arguments. Your present regrets speak well for you, but I am free to inform you that we could hardly expect you totake charge of such a situation with the ability of a Past Master. Our Masonic tradition exacted in olden times of one who aspired to this honorable degree, the ability andexperience of a Master, but in these modern days we find our members in all walks of life, and thenecessity of disseminating Masonic knowledge is increased tremendously. As a consequence and agreeable to the fraternity, we take this shorter method, in the hopes that you willderive great knowledge from the lessons conveyed, and that you will, when time permits, fortify yourselfwith the characteristics of leadership which identify the true Past Master. You have summoned us before you to pass judgement on your ability as a Master, seeking the honorabledegree of Past Master. We are frank to inform you that we have already formed our opinion but beforegiving you our final decision, we shall require of you a seal of your faith and unaltered determination to liveaccording to the sublime precepts contained in that sacred book, to govern yourself that you may be able togovern others, to learn first that you may be able to teach; that you may in truth be worthy of the distinctionwhich the name \"Past Master\" implies. Past Master: give me the due guard and sign of a Past Master. Done. As Freemasonry would take all men by the hand, I am happy to extend you mine in token of youracceptance. Congratulations. All Past Master congratulate the K and class. SD comes around as the last person and takes K to be seatedwith the class. When all are seated: RWM: You will now stand and receive the charge. CHR: My brothers, you have been invested with the secrets of the degree of Past Master and been inductedinto a representation of the Oriental Chair, wherein the wisest of kings once ruled. While brief may havebeen the ceremonies of the degree, the lessons conveyed are of great importance and, according to ancientregulations, essentially necessary before you could be exalted to the most sublime degree of the RoyalArch. For he who would attain to this honorable station must be a Ruler of the Craft. He who would rulemust first learn the great lesson of obedience, and the observance of every obligation heretofore taken,squaring his actions by the square of virtue, and keeping his passions and prejudices within due bounds. Heonly can teach who has passed through the severe school of discipline; and he rules best who has learnedthe important lesson of self­control. Self, a subject although a king – self, a servant but still a master – self, acraftsman, yet a ruler of the craft – a ruler whose scepter is justice, whose kingdom is in the heart ofhumanity, and whose throne is builded in love.
