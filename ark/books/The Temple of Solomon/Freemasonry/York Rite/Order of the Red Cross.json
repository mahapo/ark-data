After the death of Cyrus, the Jews, whom he liberated and sent back to Jerusalem, were forbidden byCambyses, his son and successor, to continue the work of rebuilding, and at the time this Council wasconvened the work had ceased during several years. Zerubbabel, the royal prince of the house of Judah, participated in the deliberations of that council, and wehave admitted you to this presence in expectation that you will assume the name and represent the characterof that illustrious prince, whose hands laid the foundation of the second temple, and whose hands the Lordpromised should finish it.

From time immemorial, it has been the customer of the sovereign of this realm, on occasions like thepresent, to propose certain topics for consideration, and to bestow princely gifts upon the one found wisestin the discussion. In conformity to that custom, I now propose the following question, with the assurancethat he who gives the most satisfying answer shall be suitably rewarded. Which is the greatest: The strength of wine, The power of the King, or, The influence of woman? Pauses and looks for a response. When none comes: Price Chancellor stands, what say you? PC rises and bows:SM, it is the opinion of your Chancellor that the strength of is the greatest. SM: Prince Master of the Palace stands what is your opinion? PMP rises and bows: SM, it is the opinion of your Master of the Palace that the power of the King is thegreatest. SM: Prince Z, waits have you an opinion to offer? Z rises bows: I have your Majesty. In my humble opinion the influence of Woman is greater than thestrength of Wine, or the power of the King, but above all thins TRUTH beareth away the victory. SM: Sayest thou that truth beareth away the victory? Prince Z, this is an important addition you have madeto our question and it shall have consideration. Princes and Rulers, let the discussion begin. Prince Chancellor, wait are you prepared to maintain youropinion by argument? If so, begin. PC rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: O ye Princes and Rulers, how exceedingly strong is wine. Itcauseth all men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the King and the beggar to be all one; of thebondman and the freeman; of the poor man and the rich; it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth,so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt; it changeth and elevateth the spirits and eliveneth theheavy hearts of the miserable. It maketh a man forget his brethren and draw his sword against his bestfriends. O ye Princes and Rulers, is not Wine the strongest that forceth us to do these things? SM: Prince Chancellor, your argument is well chosen. Prince Master of the Palace wait are you prepared to defend your position? PMP rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: It is beyond dispute, Oh Princes and Rulers, that God hasmade man master of all things under the sun; to command them, to make use of them, and apply them to hisservice as he pleases; but whereas men have only dominion over other sublunary creatures, Kings have anauthority even over men themselves, and a right of ruling them by will and pleasure. Now, he that is masterof those who are masters of all things else, hath no earthly thing above his.

Z rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: O Princes and Rulers, the force of Wine is not to be denied;neither is that of Kings, that unites so many men in one common bond of allegiance; but the supereminency of Woman is yet above all this; for Kings are but the gifts of Women, and they are also themothers of those that cultivate our vineyards. Women have the power to make us abandon our very countryand relations, and many times to forget the best friends we have in the world, and forsaking all othercomforts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings, are comparableto the almighty force and of TRUTH. As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but TRUTHalone is unchangeable and everlasting; the benefits we receive from it are subject to no variations orvicissitudes of time or fortune. In her judgment is no unrighteousness, and she is the strength wisdom,power, and majesty of all ages. BLESSED BE THE GOD OF TRUTH!
