Confusion taken up by the rest of the craft. RWM gives *, upon whichofficers return to their stations, except SD who stays with K. Officers and brethren are seated. Brother Senior Warden, SW rises, what is the cause of this confusion? SW: The craft is at a stand for want of a keystone, for which I fear no order has been given. RWM: That piece of work was assigned to our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, and from his well knownpunctuality, I have full confidence to believe that it completed. SW is seated. RWM: Brother Overseers no knock, MO, SO & JO rise approach the East. MO, SO & JO go to east in direct lines from their stations. They are in line in the east, MO to the north,SO in the middle, JO in the south. RWM hands MO design of the keystone. Has a piece of work of this form, and bearing this mark, been presented to you for inspection? MO receives design and consults with SO & JO. Should be audible. MO: Right Worshipful Master, on consultation we find that a piece of work of this form, bearing this mark,WAS presented for inspection. It was neither oblong nor square; square work and square work only is suchas we had orders to receive. Neither had it the mark of any of the craft thereon; being unacquainted with themark which was upon it, we were unanimous in deeming it unfit for use, and heaved it over among therubbish. Returns design to RWM. RWM: This is truly unfortunate, for upon that stone depended the completion of the temple. You will makestrict search among the rubbish to see if it can be found. MO, SO & JO search for the stone, find it and return to the east, MO carrying the stone, taking positionsas before. MO: RWM, strict search has been made and the stone is found. RWM: Present it. MO presents stone to RWM in same manner as K presented it to overseers in the first section. Afterexamining stone RWM holds it high in left hand, mark toward the craft. RWM: THIS is the stone on which was set at naught of you builders, which is become the chief stone ofthe temple. Gives * with gavel, MO, SO & JO return to stations in direct lines west and are seated in unison. Brother Senior Deacon, conduct the brother to the East. SD takes K by right arm and proceeds northward to a point on a line one pace north of the MO’s station,thence eastward to a point one pace west of dais, then south until directly in front of RWM’s station. FaceRWM RWM: My brother, exhibits keystone this is an imitation of the keystone upon which this degree is founded.Its color is white, and alludes to a certain passage of Scripture: \"To him that overcometh will I give to eat ofthe hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no manknoweth, saving him that receiveth it.\" The new name which I now present you as a Mark Master iscomposed of certain words of which the letters, H T W S S T K S, on this stone, are the initials. \"Hiram"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Tyre Widows Son Sent King Solomon\". Repeat them with me, \"Hiram Tyre Widows Son Sent KingSolomon\". Within this circle of letters each craftsman is taught to place his private mark, to which hisobligation alludes. This was once the private mark of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and now is thegeneral mark of the craft. ToolsI now present to you the working tools of a Mark Master. They are the chisel and mallet. The chiselmorally demonstrates the advantages of discipline and education. The mind, like the diamond in its originalstate, is rude and unpolished, but as the effect of the chisel on the external coat soon presents to view thelatent beauties of the diamond, so education discovers the latent virtues of the mind, and draws them forthto range the large field of matter and space, to display the summit of human knowledge, our duty to Godand to Man. The mallet morally teaches us to correct irregularities and to reduce man to a proper level, sothat by quiet deportment, he may in the school of discipline learn to be content. What the mallet is to theworkman, enlightened reason is to the passions; it curbs ambition; it depresses envy; it moderates anger andit encourages good dispositions; when arises among good Masons that comely order, \"Which nothingearthly gives or can destroy, The soul’s calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy.\" RWM: Brother SD, you will seat the brother with the class. SD seats the candidate with the class. Thelecture of this degree will be presented by Companion ... names lecturer. Lec.: My brother, a brief explanation of the ceremonies of this Degree will prove equally interesting andinstructive. At the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were employed 80,000 craftsmen, one of whom you havethis morning represented, whose custom it was, at the close of the sixth day of each week, to repair to theTemple with work for inspection. The inspectors, who were selected from among the most skillfulcraftsmen, were called Overseers, and stationed at the South, West and East gates, to receive all workbrought up for the building of the Temple. To provide against faulty work, wrought by unskilled Craftsmen, being received, King Solomon hadordained that every Craftsman should select for himself a mark, a copy of which should be placed uponeach piece of work by him wrought, so that it might be known and distinguished when promiscuouslypresented for inspection. The wages of a workman were a penny a day, paid by the Senior Warden, who, under orders from KingSolomon, required every Craftsman entitled to wages to thrust his right hand through a latticed window,into his private apartment, bearing in the palm of his hand a copy of his Mark, and at the same time givingthis Token given. The Senior Warden, seeing the Mark and Token, knew that wages were due him andpaid him accordingly; without the Mark or Token, he would be detected as an impostor, and would sufferthe penalty, that of having his right hand struck off. The ceremonies of this degree were founded on the keystone, wrought by our Grand Master, Hiram Abiffand used in the principal arch of King Solomon’s Temple. Our traditions inform us that on a certain sixthday a young Craftsman, repairing to the Temple with work for inspection, found the curiously wroughtkeystone in the quarries, and, observing its peculiar form and beauty, substituted it for his own work. Hethen presented it at the South gate for inspection. The Junior Overseer hesitated to receive it; but because ofits peculiar form and beauty permitted it to pass to the Senior Overseer, who, for similar reasons, passed itto the Master Overseer. The Master Overseer being unacquainted with the principles of the arch, and observing that it was neither"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"oblong nor square, the only work he was ordered to receive, and that it had none of the regular marks of theCraft upon it, called a council of Overseers, and they knowing of no use to which it could be converted inthe building of the Temple, heaved it over among the rubbish. The young craftsman then attempted to receive wages, but for want of this Token given, was detected as animpostor; and had it not been for the timely interposition of a brother, would have suffered the penalty givessign. When the Temple was nearing completion, the Senior Warden reported to King Solomon that the Craft wasunable to proceed with the work because of the want of a keystone belonging to the principal arch of theTemple. King Solomon replied that that piece of work was assigned to our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff,who, from his well­known punctuality, had no doubt promptly executed it. Search was ordered, thekeystone found, and in due time placed in the proper position in the arch. This degree was founded by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, and wasintended not only as a reward for Industry, Fidelity and Skill, but also to render it impossible for anyBrother Mark Master to suffer for necessities of life, when the price of his Mark would obtain them. RWM: The class will rise and receive the charge, as presented by names companion. Charge My Brothers, I congratulate you on having been thought worthy of being advanced to this honorabledegree of Freemasonry. Permit me to impress it on your mind that your diligence should ever be equal withyour duties, which become more and more extensive as you advance in Freemasonry. In the honorable character of a Mark Master it is more particularly your duty to let your conduct in thelodge and among the brethren be such as may stand the test of the Grand Overseer’s Square, that you maynot, like the unfinished and imperfect work of the negligent and unfaithful of former times, be rejected andthrown aside, as unfit for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. While such is your conduct, should misfortune assail you, should friends forsake you, should envy traduceyour good name, and malice persecute you, yet may you have confidence that among Mark Masters youwill find friends, who will administer relief to your distresses and comfort to your afflictions, ever bearingin mind, as a consolation under all the frowns of fortune, and as an encouragement to hope for betterprospects, that the stone which the builders rejected – possessing merits to them unknown – became thechief stone of the Temple. The class may be seated. RWM: Brother Junior Warden rises how goes the hour? JW: The sixth hour of the sixth day of the week, Right Worshipful Master. Sits. RWM: Brother Marshall Mar rises and salutes you will assemble the craft and repair to the apartment of theSenior Warden to receive wages. Mar carries sword, right faces and advances to a point on a line just south of the JO’s station, turns left,advances eastward to a point at least two paces west of the dais, about faces and gives *** with foot. All,including candidates, rise. Craftsmen, you will form in procession on the south side of the lodge, single file, facing East. MO, SO & JO, SD and class form as follows: MO goes to a point north and west of the altar, turns left andfalls in. SO goes eastward, turns right and follows MO. JO goes eastward, and falls in behind SO. SDdirects class to fall in behind him, with active K last in line. SD should be behind the JO. When formedMar steps to left of MO facing east and commands: Forward, Column left, MARCH!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The procession moves northward to north side of lodge, then westward, keeping north of MO & SOstations to a point one pace east of SW’s station, then south past apartment of the SW. Mar commandsColumn left, MARCH as required. The SW & JD will set up the wicket. As Mar approaches the wicket hechanges sword to left hand, thrusts right hand into the wicket, gives token and receives a penny. Marchanges sword to right hand and takes position south of wicket, stands at guard. MO, followed by theprocession each in turn thrusts hand into wicket to receive a penny. SW places a penny in each hand,placing a chapter penny in each candidate’s hand. MO leads procession from apartment of SW in a circle,passing just west of altar. As they pass the SW’s station a second time Mar steps to head of procession andleads it until he reaches a point on south side of lodge, west of the altar, directly opposite rear of line, haltsand inwards faces, as does procession. Mar should have K on his right, with a space at least as wide as thealtar. Mar will pass around the circle asking: How much did you receive? MO: A penny. Mar goes to each in turn asking the same question and getting the same response until he reaches theactive K: WHAT! YOU A PENNY TOO? Turns and addresses the craftsmen, moving backward towards south as he talks until, when he hasconcluded he is back at his former position at the south end of the line. Craftsmen, here are several who came in at the eleventh hour and have received as much as we who haveborne the burden and the heat of the day. It is not right and I will not receive my wages. Mar throws penny on floor. MO, SO & JO do the same, saying: Nor will I! RWM, *: Brother Senior Warden, what is the cause of THIS confusion? SW: The craft are not satisfied with their wages, Right Worshipful Master. RWM: Have you not paid every man according to agreement? SW: I have. RWM, rises: : Then, brethren, why are you dissatisfied? Mar, after prompting by MO, SO, & JO: Right Worshipful Master, salutes and comes to officer’s salute wewho have borne the burden and the heat of the day complain that those who came in at the eleventh hourhave been made equal unto us. RWM: Is it not the traditional law? Mar confers with overseers: We know of no such traditional law. RWM: Will you hear it? Mar, after consulting with overseers: We will. Carries sword. RWM leaves station and goes to altar, turns bible around: This is the traditional law: reads: \"For thekingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hirelaborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them intohis vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market place, andsaid unto them: go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you. And they went theirway. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hours, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour hewent out and found others standing idle, and saith unto them: Why stand you here all the day idle? Theysay unto him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, andwhatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto hissteward: Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when theycame that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came,they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny; andwhen they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying: These last havewrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and the hear of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the day.

Is it not lawfulfor me to do what I will with mine own? Is it in thine eyes evil because I am good? So the last shall be firstand first last; for many be called but few chosen.\" What say you now? Are you satisfied? Mar confers with overseers, turns to RWM and salutes, coming to officer’s salute: We are. Carries sword and each picks up penny. RWM turns bible around and goes back to stations.
