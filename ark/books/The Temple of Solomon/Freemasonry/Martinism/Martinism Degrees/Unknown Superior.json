You will now hear the latest explanation of the symbolism of Associate Degrees, Insider and UnknownSuperior. Brother Speaker, you have the floor. Speech of the Speaker SPEAKER: The Third Degree is divided into two parts: initiation and administrative. Itforms the synthesis of two other degrees. S ::: I ::: is the distinctive signature of the Orderand alone indicate any developments symbolic ritual. The six dots arranged in two oppositetriangles are available for lighting, and layout represents the Ternary in three worlds: God,Man and Nature. the letter S, the initial words Silence and Superior, is the symbolic coat which is coveredevery Initiate. The letter I, Initial word Incognitus, Unknown, symbolizes the mask in all its meanings. The opposition of the two letters and the opposition of the two triangles reveal the perceptive eye, the twocolumns in their active opposition (letters) and passive (points), vertical and horizontal oppositionopposition, key or Symbolism of the Cross. Symbolism of our Rite is more beautifully summarized in the following figure, which is very characteristic.The point in a circle represents the principle in its development, God in eternity, etc.. In the humankingdom, the point or principle, is the Self, the circle, or development,represents humanity. In the intellectual kingdom, the point is the absoluteScience, Circle, scientific theories, Systems and Schools. In the moralkingdom, the point is the Religion, the Circle, all the different forms ofworship. Finally, the point is the Cause, mobile First, the circle is the effectthe result. Martinists see the point in the emblem of the Mask, who teachesSolitude, and in circumference, the Mantle, who teaches Prudence. Linesparalllèes supported by both Saint John, whose celebrations in oppositeseasons of the year, are antagonists of Nature Forces now Eternity itself in themost perfect state of balance and these lines also include alternatives of Goodand Evil, Light and Darkness, of Man and Woman, Spirit and Matter, etc..etc.., oppositions that are essential to establish, on the whole Creation, divinelaw of Universal Harmony, represented in ancient times, the Lyre of Orpheus,and since the Christian era, by the Bible, which crowns the whole symbol. Meditating on the sublimesymbolism of Martinist Rite, we are led to the following profession of faith: The Lighting \"We believe in One God and Religion as the One Him, a God blessed all the Gods and the absorbent orcanceling all Cults Religion. We believe in the infallibility of the Spirit of Charity rather than dogmaticinfallibility of recklessness of a few men. \" The Mask \"We believe in the absolute freedom, the absolute independence, the kingdom itself, the relative divinity ofthe human will, when set by the sovereign reason. We believe that to get rich, you have to give, and thatindividual happiness can only be achieved by the happiness of others. \""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Columns \"We recognize in Being two basic modes: Idea and Form, Intelligence and Action. We believe in the Truth,which is Being developed by Idea. We believe in the reality, which is the idea demonstrated ordemonstrable science. We believe in Reason, which is Being expressed exactly by the Word. We believe injustice, which is Being put into action, according to its true relationship and reasonable proportions. \" The Coat \"We believe that God himself, the elusive Grand Principle of Justice, can not be the bully or theexecutioner of his creatures, he can neither reward nor punishment, but the Law of Universal Harmonydoor itself its sanction, so that the good of oneself is the reward of good and evil retribution, but also theremedy of evil. \" We need to shed more light on the meaning of signs and Pentacles the first two degrees, but should not,however, expect this to be sold here and its esoteric or revealed. It is only the Initiate this task falls,everything is allowed us in this regard is to spawn him the road to discovery. Cross Cross is imagede quaternary Act, itself hidden in the Kabbalistic training Incommunicable Tetragrammatonor four­letter name. This knowledge forms the apex of all Schools of Initiation, whatever their names orrites, but in almost all the letter replaced the mind, and nothing remains of the tradition, if not a fewceremonies are more understood. The Incommunicable Name, Word or lost, we only say in a low voice inthe midst of the most solemn rites, is הוהי the Hebrews, which are derived from the Egyptians, their masters.It is also the INRI of the Rosicrucians and the Kabbalists Rota. The name is also Incommunicable GrandAthanor (G \\ A \\ ), the AZWP (Azoth) followers of the highest degree of Hermetic initiation. Know thetrue pronunciation ­ that is to say have a full understanding of the mechanism of quaternary Act synthesizedin the lost Word of Kabbalists it is to get Master of the four elements and focus in his brain all ideas Science, Religion and Progress. We have seen that the Law of Ternary binds together the opposing forces and returns to the Unit Triangle.The Quaternary is the complement of the Ternary, it brings the Laws of Opposition and a balance in all thatis harmonious entity. Quaternary Act is represented by the square geometry which is composed of fourangles 90 each equal to the fourth part of the Circle degrees, emblem of eternity. Hence the problem of thequadrature of the circle, insoluble in modern mathematics, which is based on the false premise of\"mathematical point \", but perfectly solved by the Ancient Philosophers, who represented this way theabsolute law of the 'Eternal Harmony. The method used by insiders to write SacredWords is available in the form of a cross in a circle. These are the actual initiation instructions Cross, symbol of divinity by the mystery ofIncommunicable name, which is, in truth, the Divinity itself manifest in Philosopherby Great Universal Law of the Quaternary. We can not say anything more about this important topic. We have gave you the Keyto Universal Science, you must open yourself the door of the Sanctuary. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" The Pentagram The Pentagram with five points, appear to destroy the beautiful harmony of the Quaternary. In reality, thisis what he does. It follows that the number 5 is the symbol of the Fall, Death, the ruin of the Corruption ofDecay. But the Flaming Star, which suggests the form of man (that is to say the head and fourlimbs), is the symbol of man in the prime of his free will, capable of mastering hispassions when dominates Intelligence Matter (Fig. 1 ) or to allow his Passions todominate his Spirit (fig. 2). This represents Good and Evil, the direction taken. FIG. I   FIG. 2 The five­pointed star is above all a symbol of the Fall (5) Rights, and as a corrupt status (5), either physicalor moral. But we saw in the previous Steps, the human will is powerful, even against Providence. Also, to make hisredemption. was it necessary that the free Will and Consent Rights unite the designs of Providence. TheAlliance, the Communion was when the Godhead incarnated in the body of man, when the Word wasmade ​​flesh. The man had offended his Creator, defiles the sacred name of God, in other words, destroyedthe harmony of the relationship between Heaven and Earth ­ kabalistically idea expressed by the mutilationof the Holy Name divided into two parts; the sublime Quaternary was violently separated into two binaries,that is to say, in terms of both opposition ­ הוהו . Such antagonism could not continue. TheTetragrammaton wanted Regeneration Rights. This desire is expressed in the triple Tau Kabbalah Hebrew,the letter ש, which affect the form of language, is also the Word, c ' is to say the Godhead itself asmanifested by the Word. the letter ש , (Shin), twice the emblem of God, was therefore introduced into theSacred Name mutilated so as to bring the two fragments: הישהי. This new five­letter name, emblem of theredemption of man, s e Ieoschoua reads in Hebrew and is the name of the Nazarene, and we see that thenumber 5, before Destroyer of Harmony, is under the new provision, net blessed Reintegration of Rights inits pristine purity. You now understand the esoteric meaning of the death of Osiris and the other heroes of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"modern mysteries, even prior to Christ, because since the Fall of Man's redemption has always beenpossible. These esoteric explanations must always be present in our minds. They will lead you, my brother,to the highest conception of the universe, its laws and its Great Architect. Knowledge from thecontemplation of our symbols extends well beyond that which could give you no contemporary secretassociation. We have to tell you, my brother, the sign of this degree: the Seal of Solomon, or doubletriangle, and the Universal Pentacle of Saint­Martin, the illustrious founder of our Rite Sublime. The Seal of Solomon The Seal of Solomon or six­pointed star represents the universe and its two Ternary, God and Nature, and,for this reason, called the Sign of the Macrocosm, or Grand World, as opposed to the five­star points, which is the sign of the Microcosm, or Little World, or Man. It is composed oftwo triangles. One whose top is above is what goes, it symbolizes Fire and Heat;psychologically, it represents the aspirations of man to his Creator materially. It representsthe evolution of the physical forces, the Center of the Earth at the center of our planetarysystem, the Sun. In a word, it expresses the natural return of forces, moral and physical, inprinciple from which they emanate. The triangle with the point at the bottom is all that down, it's thehermetic symbol of Water and Humidity. In the spiritual world, it is the action of the Deity on his creatures,in the physical world, it represents the current involution from the Sun, the center of our planetary system,and from the center of the Earth. Combined, these two triangles express not only the law of balance, but theeternal activity of God and of the universe, they are the Perpetual Motion, Generation and constantregeneration by water , and fire + , that is to say, by the Rot­term formerly usual instead of more scientificword fermentation. The Seal of Solomon is the perfect picture of Creation, and it is with this meaning thatOur Venerable Master, Louis­Claude de Saint­Martin, was enclosed in his Universal Pentacle. Universal PentacleGod, the First Principle of the universe is represented by a circle, the symbol of eternity:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The action of Eternity (ףוםויא of Kabbalah), from the action of latent power, symbolized by the mysticalrelationship of the Centre to the Circumference, the projected six times around the circle radius, theHexagon product CeQui emblematic of the six periods of the Creation.The central point as the seventh period, that of the rest. It is between these creative emanations Nature evolves by two major currents of Involution and Evolution(Triangles ascending and descending).Note that nature, symbolized by the Seal of Solomon, does not reach God, but only the creative forcesemanating from Him.

The Candidate rises: Unknown Superior, you are now come tothe threshold of the Holy of Holies of the Temple of Universal Knowledge. We must leave you here todecide for yourself whether or not you want to enter the sanctuary of the Eternal Truth. First, you havesubjected to trials and tribulations of a purely physical character, and you have overcome many obstacleswith courage worthy of praise. It is true that you had nothing to fear, because you were guided by a faithfulfriend, in whom the trust was well placed. But here, in this school of ancient wisdom than the physical testsare considered insufficient. We demand more proof of your moral and intellectual value. It is events of apurely spiritual nature that you will be subjected, it is the moral man we want to move without assistancefrom ignorance to the light through the dark and arid valleys doubt, moral irresolution, mental anxiety andfear. We can not recommend any reliable friend to the Initiate to guide his faltering steps, we can not givehim any other means of defense than he has procured himself, when, wrapped in mystery and protectedCoat the mask against the morbid curiosity of the Profane, he comes to Great Work of the creation of hispersonality. We can not give him to dispel the darkness that obscures the road, other light than the light ofhis own genius, fueled by oil from a patient meditation. As you able to create your character, you will comeout victorious in your supreme effort to get all the light, or you will be ripped mercilessly by more hideousthan any you could meet villains. These are the kinds of hardships imposed on its followers by Martinism,custodian of the Sacred Tradition, and, contrary to what is practiced in other schools, our trials begin for theInitiate when our task initiator suspended. Unfortunately ­ or fortunately, who knows ­ these eventscontinue as soon as the Chosen floored the four elements and the fatal and blind forces unleashed againsthim. Then only for the winner begins an era of peace and glory, when all created things obey the sign ofhis flowery branch Almond, emblem of the highest initiation. Events Martinism also cease for the weak, onwhich the fate throws the flying sheet of eternal oblivion. But no tears will be paid on the vanquished, noMaster is s e this to help remove the tomb of his corrupt body, and nobody is sent to collect the remains. Intruth, even to the point where he fell victim to his irresolute mind and his wavering will, powerless againstDestiny and unworthy of the help of Providence, even this point, I say, is unaware of his friends , hisfamily, his God ... Unknown Superior, look ahead ... Only a light transparent veil still hiding in your mindthe great Arcane Arcane: decide for yourself between the Eternal Eternal Wisdom and Ignorance ... But if by the power of your free will and the blessing of the Godhead, you come to contemplate the truthface to face, remember that you should keep silent about the mystery that you have entered, even if yourloyalty to you cost lives. Always have in mind the fate of the Great Initiators who have tried, even with thebest intentions, to lift a corner of the multitude Sacred Veil of Isis: Adonis, killed by the boar. Osiris was killed by Typhon. Pythagoras prohibited. Orpheus, cut in pieces by the Bacchantes Moses, abandoned in the caves of Mount Nebo. Hiram murdered by bandits.
