After review, the Unknown Philosopher made ​​some remarks relative to the Neophyte impressions(Question No 1), encouraged to think more and more in order to acquire all ense m ble of esoteric scienceof this important rite of the Order. Very few words are dates in response to the question 2, 3 but thequestion must be highly developed. The UNKNOWN PHILOSOPHER: If you understand the importance of the lessons that have been givento you, the First Degree of the Order Martinist made ​​you a new man. Become a Philosopher of Unity, you can, and former insiders, enter into spiritual communion with thepriests of all Cults, with the followers of all the Schools of Philosophy, ever, get this before the eyes fruitfulsymbol lights, teaching how Diversity keeps coming to Unity, law that the Egyptians symbolized by thepyramid, although the triangular base, however, ends at the top by a single point, the listed unit of Truth orAbsolute. The pyramid has the peculiarity that each side can be taken as a basis, the corresponding vertex isinevitably a point. This teaches us that no nation, no people, no class of people, no one can claim for itselfthe exclusive monopoly of the truth of God, but that it is, however, accessible to any individual, anycommunity, any people, any nation whose aspirations. Congress of Religions, in 1893, Professor J. Estin Carpenter, Oxford, said: \"This is Pagan, the other Jew,this third Muslim. The philosopher sees each one being who seeks God. \" This is a pure Martinist doctrine. As well as all forms of divine worship meet in a World Religion Unit and that all systems are aligned in thePhilosophy of Science Unit, and all men and all women form the Oneness of Humanity. As the cell, anatomical principle of the body, form organs (muscles, glands, blood, veins ...), and organsform devices (brain, heart), and assembling the necessary equipment form the individual. Thus the individual, large cell body of humanity, as the family, the body of humanity. Several families forma tribe and several tribes form a colony, which is a larger individual. Finally form the Colonies and Nationcomprise the Races, and all Races combine sublime in organizing the larger Self: the Human Race.

Humanity itself is an individual, a real person, with hisown conscience, its particular laws of vitality and transformation ­ not death, because humanity is eternal ­and these laws respond to each of us, men who compose the great body, the same way that each of ourcells react anatomical our entire organism, This gives you the cler social necessity for us to have solidarity and destroy the monstrous prejudice againstGender, Religions and breeds, and shows you clearly how it is rational to sacrifice his personality thegreater good of the community, as well as teaches the impressive symbol mask. In the religious system of the Parsis, we see that every follower of Zoroaster, before praying for himself,pray for his sovereign and his Religion Community prescribed to drown his individuality in the interest ofthe Community. It must be regarded as part and parcel of the whole Community. The good of all will bewell ­ and the very solid ­ each party. This sublime philosophy, which was that all Initiates Oriental and Western centers of the Enlightenment, isas old as the world is old, e t, if one believes the tradition, it was the first commandment of God to AngelsSeventh Heaven.

Adammeant the \"all men\"; Eve, the \"all women . \" History of Adam and Eve is nothing other than the history ofthe human race, which was shamefully disguised by theologians.

Philosopher Unit, meditate with all your heart the consequences of a few ideas that come to Thee exposedand clear from the Symbol of lights and the Mask. The Fall of Man will then appear as a sad reality, e t, inthe reinstatement rights and prerogatives primitive, you will see the true purpose of the aspirations of everyInitiate. The rehabilitation of the Community by disinterestedness, e t, if necessary, by the sacrifice ofintellectual individuality, that is the basis of the mysterious teachings of Martinism.

He is blindfolded, representing the blind and fatal lawwhich governs the generation and eternal regeneration. EXPERT: Brother, you came to the portico of the Temple. Brother Feeder, remove the bandage that coversthe eyes of our Brother and keep their badges. The Newbie tends his small branch of myrtle First Feeder e t his sword Second Tray. EXPERT, addressing the Neophyte: We read in the Scriptures, that Solomon, in imitation of the Hindusand Egyptians, placed at the entrance of the Temple in Jerusalem, two bronze pillars: the one was calledJachin Boaz the other, which means Strength and Weakness in opposition. These two columns representthe Man and the Woman, Reason and Faith, Authority and Liberty, Right and Duty, Cain and Abel. Theywere the pillars of the world's intellectual and moral.

The UNKNOWN PHILOSOPHER addressing the Neophyte: Who are you, my brother, and what do youwant? The neophyte: I am a philosopher of Unity, and I would like to receive new light. The UNKNOWN PHILOSOPHER Unit, Brother, can produce nothing as opposed to itself ... Speaker presents the mirror Neophyte remains hidden. This gives rise to the duality principle or binary opposition of opposites, symbolically represented by thenumber 2, which is the ultimate passive principle, or two columns between which you had to pass beforebeing allowed to enter Mystic House. The two columns that explain the mystery of all opposition in Nature,are the two keys that open the doors of heaven. Astronomically, they represent the Equinoxes Summer andWinter. All Initiations show the Neophyte Symbolism of Binary or Opposition Opposites, upon enteringthe Temple, and the search for Truth, the Truth whose light is the object of your longing, is something otherthan the desire of the human soul to discover the Third Term, Element of Balance, the Reconciler twinenemies. So important is the recognition of the third principle which gave rise to the doctrine of the Trinity,which is found at the base of all systems Theogony. In Egytiens the term of balance between male Osirisand Isis is the female child Horus, Osiris himself summarizes Amon deified Active Principle of theUniverse, and Ptah, deified Passive Principle of the Universe . In Hindu Theogony, Shiva, Transformer,brings the power of Brahma, the Creator, and Vishnu, the Conservative. In the Theogony of the Kabbalists,Kether, the Absolute Power balancing combines Chocmah, Absolute Wisdom, and Binah, the absoluteIntelligence. In Christian Theogony, the Mediator between the Father and the Son and Active Principle orPrinciple Curator is the Holy Spirit or the Universal Force that animates. This is what Binary momentarydestroyer of balance, which shows the laws, so little known, this Universal Force spread everywhere andanywhere in essence invisible, terrible force and all­powerful in the hands of the Initiate .. . But justknowing the existence, Brother ... The two columns are represented by the Hebrew hieroglyphic characterך (Daleth), the Kabbalistic meaning is Strength, Power, immutability.
