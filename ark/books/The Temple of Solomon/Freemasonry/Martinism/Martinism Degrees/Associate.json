It existed long before the appearance of the lower seeds, although it has been place onearth long after them. But what stood high above all living beings is that they had their origin in a father and a mother, while he,Man, was derived directly from the divine breath. The functions of these creatures were all inferior to his. The task of the Divine Man was to combat the causes of the disorder, to establish on their ruins the sublimeUnit Peace, while the duty of these inferior beings was to obey man. But as these struggles with unstable governments, pouvalent be very dangerous for the Heavenly Man, hewas protected by armor impenetrable Here the Candidate is coated with an open bag where only his headand feet out, he is attached so as to prevent him from making big not that he could use in different ways,and he was asked to multiply copies of all copies of the original. In addition, he received a spear made ​​of four metals together in such a perfect combination that since theworld began, no one has ever been able to separate It tends to Candidate, for him to grasp, despite its bag,a small stick or a flaming sword or something representing a spear. This launches had the power to burnlike fire itself, it was so slender that nothing lul was impenetrable, and so agile that always ell e knocked attwo places in the same time. These advantages, coupled with many other donations, made the great and powerful man. It is in this delightful place, living the happiness of man and his glorious throne, he was never happy andinvincible because, having been ordered to occupy the center, he could there, observe all safety what washappening around him, and thus \"see\" all the tricks and all the movements of his opponents, but that theynever should discover. As long as he occupied the place that God had assigned him. Rights retained its natural superiority andenjoys peace and happiness incomprehensible to men of our present condition. Silence: The Candidate is gently removed from the center and leads off the Pentacle. But no sooner had he left the center, where the forces are perfectly balanced, it soon ceased to be theMaster, another officer was sent to take his place, and the man fell into the vortex of deadly force. At that time, the brothers soar in confusion out of their places, imitating all sorts of noises, whistling, cr iing, striking the blades of their swords as to simulate in combat, the organ sounded its top rated low noiseof thunder simulates the way of stones rolling down an inclined plane, etc.. etc.. It spins quickly Candidateyear and stopped the throne of the Unknown Philosopher, who gets his speech : So man, having beenignominiously stripped of his rights, was cast in the region of fathers and mothers, where Since then, heremained poor and deprived , in pain and sorrow to me it to lower nature beings, constantly prey to themost abject defects, the most hideous passions. Here we remove the bandage that reco u want vrait of the Candidate, which sees around him, includingred and green flames, the Brothers threatening their swords some wear hideous masks, but not grotesque,all somblent LOANS to kill the candidate. A few moments later, the band is placed over his eyes, and theUnknown Philosopher continued : It is hardly possible to imagine a more pitiful and provided more sadthan unhappy man at the time of his fall. Not only had he lost the invincible lance that no power couldresist, but this wonderful armor that protected fainted It removes the bag over the candidate and wasreplaced by another, which is not as impenetrable as the first, became for him a source of constant danger,so that, having always, as in the beginning, the same enemies to fight, he was much more exposed to theirblows."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"However, as the punishing Father wished not remove all hope his creature fallen and completely surrenderto the fury of his enemies. Moved by repentance and shame of man, he allowed that, by well­directed efforts, man could recover hishappiness first condition, but only after having regained possession of the spear lost that had been entrustedto the Being by which Man had been driven from Center of the Universe . At this moment. the candidate is placed in front of the West, the blindfold is removed and the Newbie seesbefore him, a tall column of fire rising from the center of the Pentagram or eu Sister is wearing a whitedress and gold, to appear a cherub, and brandishing a flaming sword or throwing lightning to theCandidate.

The UnknownPhilosopher continued: So the research of this unique weapon committed men since the fall of theHeavenly Man: e t he s continued every day this long and sad looking, because it is the recovery this objectlost that depends on their reintegration into their original rights and thus enjoy us again prerogatives andfavors which they were intended. You should not be surprised at the many resources left to the man despite his disobedience, it is the hand ofa Father who punished, but it is also the heart of a Father who watches over him, even when justicecondemns the fallen creature to be banished from the presence of his Creator. Because the place whenceman is ready with such wisdom that retracing his steps and following the same routes that have lost, it iscertain to return to its original position again invested everything he was stripped and be in this centralpoint, where only he is able to have some power and enjoy some rest.

Observation. ­It is the duty of the Speaker to explain the symbols of the Order in terms appropriate to thelevel of education of the Neophyte and develop his speech according to character of the report of thecommittee of inquiry and intellectual qualities Candidate However, the conference will include theadaptation of Symbolism to the three worlds of Kabbalah God. Man and Nature , the 'Speaker particularemphasis on the Neophyte favorite subject, or Religion, Morality and Science. The following instructions, itis not necessary to say, are not necessarily Confides to the memory or presented to each candidate all thespeaker is free to on particular topics they contain any development that it may deem proper to the greatestadvantage of Neophyte and members of the Lodge. Speech by Orauteur Symbolism The direct language is unable to express fully and completely thoughts. If it meets the immediate needs ofman, it is still insufficient to provide for a great idea with all its developments, its consequences and itsanalogies. As well as the feelings and passions are best described by intangible languages ​​that speakdirectly to the heart, such as music and painting, even metaphysical conceptions are better developed andmore fully expressed by allegories and figures called material symbols. A tragedy, read in a study, can not produce the effect terriflant ­ Great as are the reader's imagination andexperience dramatic­as interpreted by actors completely penetrated their roles because, reading the mind,the vital principle of the drama, can not encroach on the letter or even manifest by means of the letter. In every idea, whether expressed in words or writing, it is necessary to consider the form and the firstpattern, the letter and the spirit, the material envelope and spiritual essence, or, as the language of theMysteries, the exoteric and esotericism. Direct and precise language can make a thought in its external form e t incomplete. coarse and stubbornnature of our Western languages, combined with the rigidity of our alphabetic system not representingideas, but only sounds completely prevents the essence of thought to open a path through the puresuccession of words constituting what is called a sentence grammatically constructed. The ancient oriental philosophers understood this perfectly and therefore gave their speeches to a broader:for not only their words had a strict sense e t literal, but also and above all they had a figurative sense. Theyimageaient their rich language, and spoke in fables, fables and parables, thus directing the meditations of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"their listeners to an inexhaustible source of religious and scientific applications. In addition, their writing was also imaged , and the Egyptians, our former masters, gave three maininterpretations to each of their graphic characters. In addition to their phonetic value, these characters have asymbolic meaning or hieroglyphic and hieratic or sacred meaning. The sacred language of the Kabbalists, which are based on the philosophy teachings of Freemasonry ingeneral and in particular Martinism was Hebrew. A letter in Hebrew, was: 1 ° a phonetic value, 2 ° anumeric value, 3 ° it was a positive idea, when she was alone, and 4 ° on an idea, when it wasaccompanied by other letters, and finally , 5 ° it was an effective and talismanic power, combiningimmediately thought, word and deed. A simple word of the sacred language contains within itself an inexhaustible subject of meditation that cannot find a place in the volume written by our graphics, direct and mathematical characters, signsmeaningless, strangled in the middle of a barbarous spelling dune syntax and tyrannical. To understand the mysteries of antiquity and perpetuate the ancient wisdom, the use of their symbolism isnecessary, and it was the first language of man, it will be the last, because, as in the circle formed by asnake biting the tail end of things is confused with their origin and thus humanity neverdies only to survive itself. This is the first and the last symbol will Martinism institution that today is the ancient schools ofphilosophy. This Order shall his teachings by means of the highly intellectual method of analogy, which isthe only path to the understanding of the abstract nature of God, Man and the Universe. Following the traditions of our former masters, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Platonists and especiallythe Kabbalists, we believe all the laws of creation are identical and can be combined in a great and uniqueprinciple, called the Absolute, which government with equal regularity the phenomena of nature, thethoughts and actions of man, and the creative power of God. This is the search for the Absolute, another name for what our Hermetic Brotherhood called thePhilosopher's Stone, which commits Martinists meditate patiently on the beautiful symbols that will beexplained to you. The Lighting See these lights, arranged in a triangle and are based on layers of different colors, red and black. Theysymbolize Unity from Diversity."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Just as a single light comes from three different lights, and a single truth is fromdifferent sources and seemingly opposite. In this symbol, the Initiate can recognize religion, always the same as the many cults which translate toprofane. There is a Religion, as there is only one Truth, and no cult, it is called Brahmanism, Buddhism,Catholicism, Judaism or Islam, can not be attributed to the monopoly the exclusion of other Religions. Thiswas the background of the ancient initiations ­ mysteries of Memphis, Eleusis, Mithras, etc.. Every priest of an ancient cult was Initiated: that is to say, he fully understood only Religion existed andthat the different forms of worship that are used to translate the Religion different people, depending ontheir individual temperaments. As an important result of this, the priest of God could be honorably receivedin the temples of the other gods, and allowed to sacrifice. Do not think, however, that this was due to thedoctrine or the idea of Polytheism: The High Priest of the Israelites received in the Temple an Initiate,Alexander the Great, and led him into the Holy of Holies to offer a sacrifice (Papus, The Tarot). Our religious strife for supremacy of Worship on another have a lot of fun and a former Initiate have filledwith contempt for our ignorance and bad faith. The goal of most secret societies è your is by means ofintelligent men, to restore the union, this tolerance among members of the human family. Consider the immense progress that would accomplish the march of peoples to Perfection this UniversalCommunion priests of all Religions, and then you will understand the greatness of the idea that we arepursuing. As Faith, Science should see the unit out of the diversity in the scientific synthesis concilliant finally, in arational manner, Materialism and Idealism. The speaker who addresses a Newbie well aware of the little science here expound the truths and errors ofmodern schools of philosophy. Hierarchy The lights are based on different layers of color as a symbol of true principle of hierarchy, found at theorigin of any organization. Hierarchy is here represented by the lights themselves, and light, represented bythe red and black color fades as you descend. HIERARCHYSOCIAL *SCIENCE *RELIGIOUS *"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Lighting Red BlackExecutive Legislative JudicialMaster Disciples studentsGod Priests Believers* Each of these subjects can serve as theme for long developments, according to the accepted candidatepreferences. This should be the basis of all genuine and reliable organization, whether social, scientific or religious. We worship the Deity in its reporting events in nature in man and in the Divine \"Spirit World is not closed\". About rights, we find the same hierarchy in the three parts that make up the trunk: the belly, the chest, thehead, ­ which respectively give birth: the belly, the body renews it; Chest in Life, she maintains, the head atthe thought that it manifests. Head and Thought, figured by the lights, are the degree of light; Chest and Life, figured by the red cloth arethe degree of Twilight, and the belly and body, figures by the black cloth are the degree of Shadow. In nature as well as in humans, we still find this mysterious hierarchy of three degrees, in what nominatesthe three kingdoms: the mineral, the Plant and Animal corresponding to the body of the mineral kingdomHommeou black sheet, the plant kingdom to the Life of Man or red sheet, and the animal kingdom theThinking Man or lights. God, Man and Nature are the three major hierarchical divisions of the universe, and each term seems to bedriven by a power peculiar to itself. Nature is guided by a lethal force by chance, we would say, if the chance existed. This fatal and blind forceis Destiny, the God of materialists, symbolized by the black sheet. Man is by force, half and half fatal intelligent, his brain by his Will, as powerful as the Destiny, which issymbolized by the red towel. The human will is the God of Pantheism.

Providence is the God of pure Theism of print sive initiation ofVeterans, it is here symbolized by the lights are. But, as these three lights give only one light, even these three great powers, Destiny, human will andProvidence, are only single Universal Force occupying the center of everything that exists. In this great strength, Old Wisdom gave the name of Light, and it is this light, created by God \"in thebeginning \" when the earth was formless and empty, preceded the purely physical sunlight. This is the perfect consideration analogies, even the identity of the three major forces that must be basedreconciliation of the three major schools of modern philosophy ­ Atheism, Pantheism and Theism ­ in alarge, strong association for the triumph of scientific and religious truth: the proclamation of one Act, onestrength, one light, one God. Finally, the three lights, torches true of the Universal Science, also symbolize the three main columns ofKabbalah, which is based on the universe of mind and body Beauty, Strength and Wisdom. In the Gnostic schools, which is closely related Martinism, Beauty, with original Hebrew is G (רםנ,Gomer), is the moral strength, willpower, giver of life and death, the Good and Evil, or, in other words,social power, the Force, the original Hebrew is O (צר, oz) is the dynamic digital or physical strength,wisdom, whose initial Hebrew is D (רפד Dabar), is the spiritual strength shown by the philosophical andreligious science.

Applications of some principles that have been exposed are endless. But you only have to develop yourselfas soon as you have discovered the route. Meditate in your heart the symbol of the three mysterious lightsand their disposal, and Providence will sanctify you. We represent the symbol of the three lights by hieroglyphs and numbers. Teaching the Great Law of the Unity in Trinity, the lights are represented by the Hebrew letter Aleph (א),which, in Kabbalah, is the symbol of God and Man. This letter has two IODS (י) on each side of aninclined vau (ו). These three letters, however, for them, are one single character. This represents three numbers: one, twenty­six and eight. One, because it is the first letter of the Hebrewalphabet, twenty­six, because it is composed of two IODS and a vau, the respective values ​​are 10, 10 and6; ­ eight because it is the sum of the reduction théosophique 26, that is to say 2 + 6 = 8.

The mask of caution always protect you against the inquisitors of those whose characterlooks. E t the conduct does not prove that they are worthy to come and look into the sacred sanctuarywhere Truth delivers her oracles. You being alone in front of people you do not know, you have nothing to ask. It is yourself, in all yourisolation, that you must take the principles of your progress. Do not expect anything other than cases ofsupreme need, in other words, learn to always be yourself. Unknown, you have to order from anyone. Only you are responsible for your actions to yourself, and yourconsciousness is the dreaded master that you should always take advice, severe and inflexible judge thatyou should make an account just for your actions. This mask that isolates you from the rest of your fellow during the period of work, shows you the price youhave to attach to your freedom, all­powerful in your Will to Fate and to Providence, \"this freedom that youcan call the Divinity of Man, the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most binding of all the gifts of Godthe Man, this freedom that the Supreme Creator itself can not violate without denying his own nature; thisfreedom that we must get by force when you do not have to be a supreme autocratic \"(Ehiphas Levi). And, O my brother, thou hast not this freedom, which is freedom of the soul and the spirit, and not merelythat of the body is fighting against your passions, your earthly desires, you can hope to conquer thisindependence s i glorified, if truly divine.
