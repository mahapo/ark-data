It should be held at least once a month, not including the initiation lodges.2. In this lodge, the tables about the members of the Lower Class, if such have been submitted by theAssembly of the Lesser Illuminati, are corrected, expanded, and sent to the Assembly of the DirectingIlluminati.3. All matters concerning the Minerval Assemblies, promotions in the lower degrees, etc. are decided here, orif the matter is too important, they are reported to the Directing Illuminati; thus, they are also provided withall tables and Reverses.4. Everything every member of this degree learns and which concerns the higher Order, Freemasonry, orother societies, the Brothers’ promotion in civic offices and positions of honor, or anything that may relateto such matters, must be indicated in these assemblies, where it is recorded in the minutes and reported tothe other Superiors.5. The members of this degree should primarily instruct those Brethren tasked with recruiting new members;for this, Addendum A, except the Lesson contained in the Minerval files, is used.6. But the main work of this degree is the more precise analysis of the characters according to Addendum B.7. If one of the Lesser Illuminati distinguishes himself through excellence and begins to make himself worthyof promotion, his character is investigated according to each of these question in the Scottish workinglodge. One must have a decisive answer on this point before one can think of a promotion; and if one hasnot been able to investigate an item, one of the members is tasked to focus his observations on this point.Everything is recorded in the various gatherings, and in the end, the entire picture of the man is puttogether from these observations and then submitted to the Directing Illuminati.It depends on the Master, whether or not he wants to have this characterization performed by a selectcommittee from time to time.stnd"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(http://bavarianilluminati.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/knigge­profile.jpg)In Philo’s Reply to QuestionsConcerning His Association with the Illuminati (http://www.lulu.com/shop/jeva­singh­anand­and­adolph­freiherr­knigge/philos­reply­to­questions­concerning­his­association­with­the­illuminati/paperback/product­20042113.html), Baron Adolph Knigge explained that the extensive questions catalog in Addenda A, B, and Cwere intended not only to gather information about a candidate’s suitability for this degree, but also toprovide those members occupying themselves with the study of psychology with authentic research material.This claim is confirmed in the Priest, (or Presbyter) degree, which was tasked with directing and coordinatingthe order’s academic pursuits.Addendum A. Secret instruction for those tasked with recruiting new members to the Order.1. He who wants to bring a new member to the Order, must first secure its perfect trust and love.2. He must conduct himself in such a manner that one should assume hidden qualities within him.3. He should gradually attempt to stir in the Candidate a yearning for friendly and secret connections, and thisapproximately in the following manner:1. He should give him access to books that speak of unity and strength in shared endeavors.2. He should also steer his conversations to this matter and show him how helpless a little child is andhow weak also the grown man is without help from others and how great, and how powerful he canbecome with the aid of his fellow men, how important the advantages of social life are.3. He should deduce to him that all power comes from the unity of will.4. He should focus his attention on the art of knowing and governing people.5. He should demonstrate to him how a single wise man can govern and guide a thousand persons.6. He should provide examples of what subjects can accomplish when they are pitched to the same tune,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"such as armies.7. Then, however, he should speak of the flaws of civil society, how faithlessly human beings act towardone another, how everyone is guided by his own personal interest, and how poorly one can often relyon friends and family.8. “Yea, he shall exclaim from time to time, ‘If the good only were united, they could build Heaven onEarth. But better men are only so weak, because they do not know themselves or are disunited.’”9. Following this, it is time to make him understand what secret societies can accomplish.10. He should show him the example of the Jesuits and the Freemasons. When the conversation turns togreat world events, he should always tell him that these are governed by secret mainsprings, and whoknows if this was not the work of such secret Orders.11. He should awaken in him a yearning to rule in secret, to research everything without being noticed,always giving the world a new direction from his chamber, to rule those who believe themselves to behis masters.12. From time to time, he should speak ambiguously, as if he knew such an Order, but at other times, heshould be silent. On other occasions he should say, “If I had the opportunity to join such an order, Iwould do so immediately.”13. All this must be repeated often.14. Then he should suddenly say, “I have finally found that for which I have wished for so long: onewants to accept me into such an Order. What do you suggest?” One should then make plans he mayfashion himself and discuss them, asking him for his opinion.15. One should place a letter written in cypher where it can be seen.4. The Candidate should be a Christian, honest, sensitive, not stupid, nor older than the recruiter, andgenerally, between 18 and 30 years old.5. If he now petitions, one should present the matter to him as extremely difficult, and one should reveal itonly by and by: but one should only give him as few written documents as possible, at least only for abrief time!6. And then one should surprise him as he picks up these papers.7. One should have him suggest other persons as well, make character sketches, etc.8. One should explore his other relationships.9. One should let him suspect that his best friends may already be in the Order.10. If someone who has been accepted into the Order, or seeks admittance, wants to know a member’s name,one should never name an important Superior, but always a respected and good man.11. However, one must know how to administer the medicine according to each person’s constitution andtherefore place a name with the Order that has an effect on the Candidate. One may seek a new kind ofFreemasonry and another a learned society, while a different man seeks the Rosicrucians and still anotherpolitical connections. Every man must find what he seeks. The Order can accomplish everything, and itdoes not work under the same name in all countries.12. All these things must be reported to the Superiors.13. Every Ill. Major may copy these instructions by hand.Addendum B."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Questions used for assessing the character of a candidate for thisdegree.I. His person.1. What is his name?2.

When a lesser Illuminatus is recommended for promotion to this degree, he must be at least of legal age.As has been stated, his character is then examined according to the questions in Addendum B. This isdone in the various working lodges until every question has been answered. Everything is then read outand noted to determine if such a man is suitable for our final purpose. If three members oppose hiselection, he cannot be accepted. When there are two or one who object, the Master decides.2. The decision is then reported to the Assembly of Directing Illuminati, who can reject or confirm thepromotion.3. If it is confirmed, the Candidate is summoned to the Master’s house who tells him in the presence of theSecret Secretary,You have been found worthy to be accepted to a higher degree. However, this Class is of the utmostimportance: a solid, inseverable bond among the best, tried and tested, most trustworthy men supportingone another in all things and seeking to make their lives sweet and pleasant, that there is no reservation, nopretense among them; however, he should first explain the following items:a) Has he found a better,unspoiled system built on more solid ground in any other society that can satisfy his desires better orfaster?b) Did he join the Order primarily to satisfy his curiosity or to join an alliance with the better part ofhumanity for the happiness of the world?c) Is he satisfied with our system, as far as he knows it, and does he consequently want to contribute toour plans? Does he find any flaws with them, and if so, what are they?d) Will he fully dedicate himself to the Order, or will he fully resign? There is no compromising in thehigher degrees.e) He must state whether or not he belongs to another Order or society, and which.f) Does this society demand anything of him that violates our institutions, and does he wish to obligethese demands, e.g. betray our secrets to it, only work for them, etc.?g) If the same were demanded of him by another order in the future, would he comply or not? And that,by his honor."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4. Once he has answered these questions, one demands of him, “Before we can promote you, you must firstwrite your unadorned autobiography, and when you are finished, seal and submit it the W.M. This finaltest of his honesty will seal his fate.”5. The Candidate’s answers and these entire proceedings are entered into a log, and he is then dismissed.6. Once the Candidate has completed and submitted his autobiography after a certain amount of time, oncehis answered have been examined and nothing dangerous has been found therein, a date is set for hisinitiation.7. Usually assemblies can be held on every day of the first quarter of the moon.1. He is led to a secluded chamber in which he will find a quill, ink, and paper on a table.2. Meanwhile, the lodge is opened.3. The lodge room is completely draped in black. On the floor of the room can be seen a strong, locked door.This lodge represents the vestibule of the Scottish Lodge. Before the door, the Grand Master sits behind atable draped in black, the Secret Secretary to his left. The two Wardens below him are seated at anothertable facing him, and between them is the Introducer. The other Brethren are at both sides in their seats.All wear the Scottish Apron and black coats. The Grand Master and Wardens carry gavels. Otherwise, noone wears a jewel. Further, no tapis[5] is to be seen. The Secretary keeps the minutes. Other than theRitual Book, etc., there is nothing on the table other than the apron for the new Brother and a round mirrorwith a handle. On the Master’s table, there are four candle sticks, and also on the tables of the Wardens.Otherwise, there are no lights in the room. However, to the right of the master hangs a blazing moon in itsfirst quarter.4. After the Lodge is opened the Introducer is sent out of the room; he removes the black coat: however, hegoes to the Candidate and tells him the following,My Br., before I can tell you anything else, place theindex finger of your right hand on your heart, raise your left arm, the hand and index finger pointing up,and repeat after me:What I will hear and learn today and from now on in this close circle of faithful andeternally bound friends and in our illustrious Order, I shall keep as a dear secret with which I have beenentrusted, and I will never betray it, not even in the hour of my death. I promise this by my honor andeverything I hold holy, dear and near.Once the Candidate has repeated this, the other continues,Thisdegree marks the beginning of an entirely new career for you; the close­knit circle of men you wish toenter today is bound in life and in death to assist one another as faithful, honorable friends. This degree isalso the Novitiate of Higher Scottish Masonry, which is in the hands of the Order and its externalcomrades only. The Order also secretly directs the lower degrees most of Fr. Ms.[6] systems at the veryleast that these are not entirely desecrated. The hieroglyphs of the Fr. Ms. contain sacred and serene truths.Even in the next degree, you will receive insights into them. However, all this knowledge is of no valueand becomes lost to the world, if we do not make the world wiser and better. For the execution of thisgrand plan encompasses knowledge of the human heart and self­knowledge as the most essential parts. Tothis purpose, sufficient instruction will be given in this degree, and herein, everyone will receive materialsfor the study of psychology. Later, you will see the progress we have made in this discipline. But let usalso see a sample of your skill in this subject. On this sheet of paper, create a faithful image of yourcharacter as you believe to know yourself, without dissimulation; you are dealing with men who can seeyour innermost self: if you are resolved to do this, I will leave you alone in this business for a fewmoments. (The candidate answers: One may have also prepared him, so that he may have completed partof the essay at home and less time is required here.)5. The Introducer now leaves the Candidate alone and returns to the lodge, where the biography is now readby the Secret Secretary; this piece of literature will give the Master the opportunity to make a fewexplanatory comments on the portrait created of the man."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6. After this, the Introducer leaves once more to fetch the Candidate’s essay about his character.7. This is also read out, and the Master notes to what extent it matches the one created by the secret lodge andif it can be supplemented from both essays by the Candidate.8. Once this has been done, the Secret Secretary is sent to the Candidate; he brings with him the portraitcreated by the lodge and addresses him in the following manner,Dear Br., you have given us anappreciable sign of your candor and trust with the essays concerning your person, and in truth, we are notunworthy of these, and at length this will grow mutually as you get to know us better. Thus, away with allreservation! Among men who seek to better themselves and others and who want to help this diseasedworld, all pretenses must cease. We study the human heart: However, the further one progresses in this art,the more indulgent and patient one becomes and the more one realizes to what extent we are governed bycircumstances and passions, how little it is often our own doing that we are neither better nor worse. Thus,we are not afraid to confess our flaws to one another, to bring this to one another’s attention in brotherlylove, and by this to hone our acumen and powers of observation. Would you not feel insulted if I now reada portrait of you created by the assembly of your most faithful friends? But nay: how could you be insultedby this? This portrait cannot shame you. Otherwise, we would not see each other here today. And no manof your intellect will believe himself to be without flaw. Now let us come to the point: Here is the portrait(now he reads it aloud and continues after this). You will recognize in this portrait at least some of yourcharacteristics. Is it still your will to bind yourself to the men who extend their brotherly arms to you asyou are? (The Candidate answers, and the Secret Secretary returns to the lodge).9. As soon as the Secretary has returned, the Introducer is sent out to bring the Candidate to the vestibule’sgate. Meanwhile, all lights are extinguished, and the room is lit only by the moon. The Brethren, however,cloak themselves with their coats.Introd.

Here you see the sacred circle of tightly knit, true Masons in wisdom’s vestibule, preserving the InnerSanctum where pristine truth and wisdom shine, who will in time spread its light over the entire world. Thesemen, the Holy Legion of Nobler Souls, still conceal themselves from you, but do not believe, that you areequally concealed to them – no facet of your heart is unknown to the illustrious Superiors. Naked andunadorned, even under compunction and in concealment, you stand in the Assembly of the Wise. – And thisgaze, my Br., looks deeply, looks deeply – do not fear this, but rejoice instead. Your heart must be good andnoble.

Br. inspirit! if you want to learn from us the great art to safely complete your journey through the midst of theworld’s hazards, you will need artfully armed eyes to distinguish appearance from truth and the fraud from thefriend. No common eye, no common insight will suffice. The Order gives you this keenness of sight, thisdegree of enlightenment. Behold the image in this mirror! It is your own. Self­knowledge is the magicallooking glass by which you may read the souls of others. (He holds the mirror before him) The path to thehearts of other men begins with our own heart. Therefore, begin with yourself; examine yourself oftenaccording to the questions you will find prescribed in this degree of the Order. – Regard yourself diligently.Do you believe to be inwardly as you appear on the outside? Study your figure often, daily, hourly. You willconstantly discover new features, and you will learn to judge others by these features. What a beautiful and,ah! what and ugly thing to behold the unconcealed human heart can be so very often! Nosce te ipsum (withthis, the WM gives the sign of the degree). Man, discover yourself, if you seek to fathom others (here, all Br.reveal their faces, also giving the sign of the degree.

O! you, havinglearned from this experience, let this mirror be your most faithful council throughout your journey on thisworld, in the noise of the world where everything is so deceptive and dangerous. In yourself, in your heart youwill find all men. All are subject to the same nature, the same instincts. Everyone loves himself, loves himselfin others. As you consistently find actions and consequences similar to your own in others, so the causes andmotivations must be similar with similar actions. He who knows himself well, knows all; he whose does notknow himself, knows no one. He who knows himself falsely or little, will judge others as erroneously. Hedoes not seek in others what they are, but only his most foolish desires, his passions. From yourself, discoverwhat others are, but do not let the treacherous looking glass flatter you; and trust it the least, if it shows you intoo beautiful a light, because we all have our flaws. He who has the fewest and knows them is the best amongus. Come to me now! (He steps to the right side of the altar) Here is the Scottish Leather Apron (He puts it onthe Candidate, removing the Master Apron). It is entirely rectangular, cut by the Square. Thus, straight like theSquare of virtue and wisdom, must be the direction of your heart. Green is the color of hope: Hope foreverything from the Order, if you are honorable and faithful. The sign of this degree is placing the index fingerof your right hand on your heart, while raising up your left arm and hand. The word is, “Nosce te ipsum.” Theother answers, “Ex te nosce alios.[7]” For the grip, unbutton the overcoat and half your vest and kiss the otherperson’s brow.Now take your seat (the Master shows him his seat and has the candles lit; then he continues): You have hadto undergo many preparations, my Br.

Everything conceals itself – the evil to deceive, and the good to avoidbeing deceived. For one, it is to attack and for the other, it is to defend. It is sweet wantonness for connoisseursof the human soul, that human beings are essentially good, that they are merely blinded and do not know theirown interest. It is sweeter still to find in this sacred circle people who are of a single heart and will. Tell me,good Br.1) Do you find that this world rewards virtue and punishes vice? Do you not rather find that outwardly, anevil man is happier, more respected, more powerful than a righteous one? In a word, how satisfied are youwith the world as it is now? – (The new Br.’s ans. are recorded.)2) To change this, would you try not gather the good and make them mightier than the evil, if this were inyour power?

(Ans. i. rec.)You see, my Br., this is how we seek to reward and support better men once we have tried them, one by one,so that we can thus gradually provide a different direction to the world. Since you feel in your own heart howlittle human beings fulfill their destiny, to what degree all public institutions have degenerated, how little theteachers of wisdom have managed to pitch human beings to a different tune and bring their interest in doinggood close to their hearts, you can easily see that this must have been cause by the means they have used:Therefore they must be chosen better, if virtue and wisdom are ever to govern the world once more, and this is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the business of our illustrious Order.

(The Secret Secretary reads:)General Overview of the Entire Order.The further you, my Br., advance in our ill. Ord., the more you will be convinced that our principles are ofsuch a kind that they do not need to fear the light, if human beings were as they should be. Sadly, however,very much is still lacking. Truths that are not presented under concealment and in sacred ceremonies are nottruths to most people. The hidden tempts them, and they are captivated by the pleasure of knowing somethingthat is not known to everyone so that they direct their attention to matters they would have otherwise ignored,no matter how important they are, and in this manner, the unadulterated truth must imprint itself in their soulsin indelible characters. There are also sentences that cannot be presented in a direct manner, that requirethorough contemplation, repeated effort, and not everyone is inclined to this; yet everyone likes to think ofhimself as the wisest man. Thus, if I wish to initiate into a system that relies heavily on middle movements hewould not likely have found in this chain through his own reasoning, I must conceal the completedevelopment with a shroud until he is sufficiently prepared to see the whole light and the allure of attainingthis must move him to pay attention to everything, even the smallest detail. If I were to present the final goal atonce, it would appear to him unimportant, even false, and one would lose the most useful people.Finally, there certainly are also certain truths, hidden behind hieroglyphs in ancient times, preserved by onlythe most tried and tested part of humanity, certain insights into the higher truth which not everyone canfathom, because a thousand obstacles, prejudices, passions, etc. prevent him from penetrating this deeply.These have always been veiled by secret mystery schools behind images, presented to their pupils by and by,and according to this plan, the hieroglyphs of the three symbolic degrees of the Fr.

Order teaches and does must affect the best of the world, must lead to elevation to raisehumanity once more from the depths of perdition into which it has descended, making it receptive for higher agood and wisdom. This is why the Order has also studied the outward institutions of all public and secretorganizations, preserved the best parts, and avoided their errors. Yea! Even now, its outer plan of operation"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"becomes more solid and more fitting to the times every day. But even the best intentions are often thwarted byevil men or desecrated by unworthy ones: However, our secrecy and the strict tests of our mbrs. preserve usfrom both. Now let us summarize the Ord.’s entire plan in a single point: our final goal is to:I. Proliferate pure truth.II. Make virtue victorious.To attain the first goal, people must be purged from prejudice, their minds must be enlightened; then with jointforces, the sciences must be purged from unnecessary subtleties; correct principles, drawn from natures mustbe established, and thus, the unobstructed path to approach the pure, now hidden truth must be opened tohumanity. Therefore, we must unlock every source of research, reward every suppressed talent, pull everygenius from the dust, teach pure principles according to the constitution of the age everywhere, educate theyouth, unite the best minds with an inseverable bond, dispute superstition, faithlessness, and folly boldly, butwisely, and finally train all our people in such a manner that they have a uniform, straight, and correctunderstanding of all things.The Seed School of the Minerval Class serves this purpose, followed by the lesser Freemasonry, whom theOrd. seeks to influence as much as possible and guide according to our grand purpose, and finally the HigherClass, where the results of our efforts and the traditions of our ancestors are fully revealed. However, toprovide virtue a firm seating, we test and train our pupils’ hearts with incredible effort. Afterwards, anythingcan be accomplished with these men. But one cannot proceed with common means. No amount of teachingand preaching will help, or it would have helped long ago. There is no truth to be found that has not beenrepeated often, no duty that has not already been taught, and the world remains as it has always been; where itis no worse, it is as bad as it was a thousand years ago; the reason for this is that there are many institutionsthat promote vice, and they far more powerful than that which our preachers can accomplish. Therefore, fromour side, force must be met with force. But here, one must examine the source of evil: Why are there so manyevil persons, and so few good? Because the allure of evil is greater, since one can accomplish more with it inthe world. – Her, the scales must be tipped in favor of virtue. One must endeavor to bring it to a point wherethe just man also can secure the external reward for his righteousness in this world. (However, the priests andprinces as well as the current political climate oppose use greatly in this endeavor. What then should we do?Encourage revolutions, overthrow everything, drive out violence with violence, replace tyrants with tyrants?Far be it from us! Every violent reform is pernicious, because it does not improve things as long as humanbeings adhere to their passions as they are, and because wisdom does not require such force.)The Ord.’s entire plan is based on educating humanity, however not through declamation, but by promotingand rewarding virtue. One must secretly tie the hands of those who promote vice and govern them withoutoppressing them. In a word, one must introduce a general regimen of morality, a form of governmentencompassing the entire world without dissolving the civic bonds by which all other governments continuetheir progress and can do anything except thwart the grand purpose of making good victorious over evil oncemore. This was even Christ’s intention when he introduced a pure religion. Human beings were to becomewise and good, were to allow themselves to be guided by wiser and better persons for their own good. Inthose days, however, when everything was in darkness, even the sermons could suffice. The novelty ofwisdom had an overwhelming allure. Today, this is not so. More powerful means than mere education must beapplied to give virtue an outward allure for the sensual man. Passions cannot be extinguished, but one mustonly know how to direct them toward noble purposes. One must show the ambitious man that true honor forwhich he yearns rests in virtue and can never be satisfied better by practicing the same. One must show the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"miser who wants own everything that he actually owns nothing, and one must show the libertine thatoverindulgence will sour every joy, – in short, that everyone satisfies his passions, whose origin is pure, bestwhen he keeps it within the confines of virtue and that the Order will provide him with the means for this.Thus, all our people must be pitched to a single tune, cling tightly to one another, have only one goal in mind,assist each other, and thus impregnate the entire world. One must gather a legion of men around the great menof the world, men who tirelessly guide the whole matter for the good of humanity, men who change the entirenation; no external force is required. The rulers of the world will soon open their eyes, and they will see thattheir advantage will be increased, but that they will run into unfathomable difficulties when they enforce evil.The nobler men will soon gain the upper hand on the evil ones who now play masters and bring unhappinessto anyone who resists them. But those who are too womanly, too prejudiced, too inactive to earnestly fight forthe rights of humanity must be motivated; good men must seek one another out; those who do not know ortrust themselves must be brought about, and one must show them that two honorable persons who are unitedcan be stronger than a hundred scoundrels. But all this must take place in secret. Our small heap must notabandon one another and assist everyone who is oppressed, provide every good man temporal advantages,outward happiness, and attempt to win all positions where power can be won for the good cause. Why shouldit not be permissible to establish oneself by righteous and gentle means to influence governments? The firstobjective of every state constitution is to place good persons at the helm, reward merit, and crown virtue. If theOrder can attain this through advocacy and by guiding the heart, if it has educated the most faithful, best,wisest, most thoroughly tests persons for the state, if it tries to promote them and reward their diligence, itconsequently fulfills the duties of the most faithful subjects and thus also fulfills the original purpose of humanbeings entering into social bonds.If, then, one has such a circle of in every nation, if every one of these forms a pair, if they cling to one anothertightly, the Order can accomplish anything, and in this manner, it has already accomplished much for the goodof humankind. But if only one thing is omitted, all doctrines are useless, and the entire matter remains purelyspeculative. Consider everything carefully; it is a grand work, not of our own design. A secure, well thought­out, unspoiled plan. Make yourself worthy of collaborating to the extent of your abilities; no effort goeswithout reward here.Here, my Br., you see the unfathomable scope of our efficacy into which you have been placed.Now hear more information concerning the work of this degree.1.

Major)”1. Terry Melanson says:July 31, 2013 at 8:57 pmIncredible work you guys have going on! Hats off!I don’t see anywhere where they describe the Illuminatus major jewel/medallion. Have you come across adescription of it in the rituals? There’s two sources that describe it: the Original Writings, p. 45, andadditional details in Le Forestier, p. 71 (consulting an archival letter from Jakob Anton Hertel to Franz vonPaula Hoheneicher). Here’s my translation of Le Forestier: “The medallion, less broad and less thick thanthat of the Minervals, was adorned with a crown, a crescent moon and seven Pleiades amidst the clouds.The moon, stars and the crown were enamelled, while the clouds were matt.”I wonder if Markner has seen an example of it or maybe a drawing by someone who saw it in the 18thcentury? What surprises me the most about actually Illuminati symbolism is how much of it is lost. Forinstance, in the raids on Zwack’s house it was explicitly pointed out that the Order’s symbols wereconfiscated, yet a mere three examples of Minerval jewels survived and nothing else from any degree asfar as I can gather. Le Forestier was one of the last to look at the archives in Munich before it was"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"destroyed in WWII and all he could find was a certificate of the Munich Theodore lodge bearing apyramid, a star, and an owl.

Josef Wäges says:July 31, 2013 at 10:23 pmUnfortunately I think much of this is lost. Send me a scan of the Le Forestier or send me the date of theletter and I’ll check the letter in Die Korrespondenz.... that might make an interesting footnote. I’ll dosome digging. In the Eclectic Rite which will also be published, only officers wore jewels, which were theusual jewels used today on blue ribbons. EA’s had plain aprons, FC’s had White aprons with White trim,and MM’s had aprons with blue trim. The Scottish Knight degree is the last to have a jewel.Reply3.

Many other rites have multiple degrees without an oath (SR), which isusually comes at the last or terminal degree, once the lesson has been conveyed in its entirety. I think thatinevitably most Scottish Novices became Scottish Knights. The Novice fully submits himself to the Orderand is then rewarded with leadership over the entire Masonic system of the Eclectic Rite, in the ScottishKnight Degree."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ReplyBlog at WordPress.com.The Columnist Theme.Home"}]
