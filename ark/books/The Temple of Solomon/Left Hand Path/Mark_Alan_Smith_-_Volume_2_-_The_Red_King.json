The gnosis hasbeen hidden by man, buried under the lies of false faiths. That whichremains is fragmented and divided between the civilisations andcultures of the world where it is believed to be of separate origins.The Witchcraft is vast power. It is the true faith and gnosis of the firstGods. Not those created by man, but those who created man.Children of the VoidThe Gods of the ancient arte of Witchcraft do not originate from theuniverse of man, though their power and influence can be felteverywhere within it and their thrones may be reached by those whoin love and devotion strive for this soul ascension. The Gods of theWitchcraft are the true children of the void, born of the one SupremeDark Goddess, She who is Queen to us all, Hecate. From Her own beingHecate created the Dark Solar God Lucifer. It was from Lucifer that theDark Goddess created Belial and other Witch Gods.The First Realm of ManLucifer as Horned God of the Witchcraft is Lord and Master of thisuniverse. This Dark Solar Lord of power, the ruler of the throne ofThaumiel, existed long before the age of the Christian lie; before therace of man itself.The first race of man and their Gods gave rise to the old legends of theFall of the Angels and, through their eventual iate, the mysteries ofAtlantis. They were the Atlantean race. The Atlanteans were afar morespiritually powerful race than that which inhabits the incarnate planein the present aeon. The soul path of their race was not divided by anAbyss which must be crossed during spiritual evolution to attain higherconsciousness with the Gods. Instead they were blessed with teachingwhich came direct from the Gods, both in incarnate form and fromL5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"within the inner planes. The world they inhabited; its reflections uponthe inner planes, and the spiritual state of being gained as a result ofthe structure of their soul path; was the first Eden.The Atlanteans were able, as are the Gods, to tap the raw, primal andunlimited dark energy of the void. This is the source of all dark magick.It is the true realm of the power of Hecate, Lucifer and their kin.Dark power drawn from the void must be controlled, it must beharnessed and channelled through the inner planes to effect change inaccordance with will in order to manifest the desires of those who wouldsummon this unlimited, eternal magickal force. The souls of theAtlantean people, being divine in their structure, had no limits placedupon or within them. The power that the Atlanteans were able to callfrom the void eventually became uncontrollable for them. Their Godswere primal, the first Gods of the first race of man. They allowed thegnosis and power to flow without restraint. They gave too much.The magickal force which the Atlantean people had at their disposalrendered them capable of earthing their own magickal currents. Theybelieved they needed no God or Goddess as such to deliver this to them.Only devotion and true love of the creators would keep such a peoplein worship of their Gods. The Atlanteans, corrupted by this immensemagickal power, lost their devotion for their Gods. Turning away fromtheir love, the Atlanteans turned away from their Gods.A once great people, the Atlanteans descended into bestiality as thedark crushing power of the limitless void opened a blackness withintheir divine souls; a blackness that would lead them to desire anotherpower, one which they could not attain. The Atlanteans wished toconquer the thrones of their own Gods. Many Atlantean souls becamenothing more than a black vortex bound to a mind that had fallen intoslavery of the very power it sought to attain, power that would devourall in its path. The Atlanteans became a race of spiritual locusts,devouring any spiritual essence across the inner planes.As Hecate banished the first eleven Gods, those who ruled Atlantis, fortheir failure; so Lucifer incarnated to channel and direct the will of thet6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Witchblood Goddess. Opening the six-rayed star of destruction throughsix other incarnate watchers Lucifer earthed the stellar currents ofHecate, and the disgraces of the first race of man were washed from theface of the planet. Only a few scattered survivors remained, some ofwhom carried their gnosis of the Witch's Craft, the Atlantean magick,to different lands to begin their lives again.Sealed Gateways of PowerAfter the fall of Atlantis the spiritual state of being known as Eden waslost. The Great Goddess sealed the gateways to the void, placingimmortal guardians, the Witch Gods, as gatekeepers to these doorwaysof limitless power. Lucifer returned to the throne of Thaumiel asSupreme Guardian to these gateways and the custodian of their sacredkeys. He is Lord and Master of the Gateways of the Void. The realm ofLucifer is hidden from the eyes of man. He bows only to Hecate. Belialis Lord of the Depths. Together they are the Trident of Witchcraft.The souls of the children of Atlantis, who were not cast out into thenever ending darkness far beneath the universal soul path of Atlantis,were parted from the power and lure of the limitless void by the spiritualAbyss. This gulf of darkness became the great crossing that must bemade by all who aspire to walk with their Gods. The soul path of allincarnate beings after the fall of Atlantis was changed. As the Atlanteanuniverse and its soul path upon the inner planes were sealed from man,so the path of the souls of all who would subsequently incarnate becamethat of the universal Tree, both the light and the dark. The Abyss isintegral to this path. Both it and the laws of its crossing belong to Lucifer.Now only those who proved themselves worthy at the level of the soulthrough the path of testing laid out by the Witch Gods, of which thecrossing of the Abyss is a most integral element, would be granted thehidden gnosis of deeper magick and the knowledge of the keys togateways of power such as those of the void. Thus the Draconian pathof soul testing and spiritual transmutation was born.L7"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Primary InitiatorAs the Primary Initiator upon the Path of Hecate, it is the Horned KingLucifer who controls the Gates of Knowledge and Power and holds thekeys which open them.

This will initiate a tremendous leap insoul evolution.18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"lTHE PATHWAYS OF ASCENSIONThere are three great crowns upon the transmutative soul path whichleads to divinity. The first crown may be found by following the Pathof Hecate, through the application of the rites of transmutation such asthose given in Queen of Hell, which is the first volume of the books ofthe Trident.The Path of Hecate is that of supreme transformation attained throughthe teaching and power of transmutational sexual magick and Nightsidetravel, leaping the zones of power in soul ascension. Here the soul isaltered and its course, or soul map, is changed as power is bestowed bythe Queen of Hell. Those who follow this path to its successfulconclusion will reach the Throne of the Dark Queen in the void beyondKether / Thaumiel. This process achieves the crystalline transmutationof the soul. Hecate holds the powers of both darkness and light. AsQueen of Hell, Heaven and Earth She grants the crystalline essence ofEmpyrean power, infused with Infernal flame. It is the merging of thesetwo forces and the subsequent ensorcelling of the energy created intheir union that is the power and gnosis of creation. Combined withthe sexual magickal kalas of Her own power the Goddess facilitatesunlimited travel and existence for those souls who have achieved thiscrowning at Her throne once they become discarnate. Those who havesucceeded in this endeavour may forever dwell at the Throne of theDark Queen. This is the re-ification within the soul of the first crown ofsoul divinity.Paths of the Gods of DarknessAll who succeed in the attainment of this first elevated state of beingby following the Path of Hecate are able to step back into the paths ofthe Nightside realm and follow the specific teachings of Lucifer whichguide the questing soul to the remaining two crowns of soul divinity.Those who strive to know the secrets of the Dark Gods are then able tofurther explore the Realm of Possibilities within which may be foundthe concealed power and gnosis that is necessary to open the doorways19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"which lie beyond the Nightside Realm of the witch. This is the Path ofLucifer's Flame. It leads the questing soul through these hiddengateways of power to the forbidden realm of Atlantis where the Gatesof Fire are opened far below the Nightside realm.In the depths illuminated by Belial the most secret gnosis of the historyof all races of man and the power of the first Gods of Atlantis isdiscovered. The gates are revealed to they who have walked the pathsof Hecate and Lucifer in soul preparation for what may be a journeyfrom which neither mind nor soul will return. Through the work withinthis book the pathway to the depths is illuminated.All who wish to pass beyond these gateways, to experience thistransition of the soul to that of the eternal God body, must pass throughLucifer Himself. Lucifer holds the keys to these gates which lead to thetwo remaining crowns, known in some cultures as sacred crystals orprecious stones. It is Lucifer, as Lord of Ascending Flame, who bestowsthe final crown of divinity upon the soul.Those who have succeeded upon the Path of Hecate may continue theirquest for the hidden gnosis of the Witch Gods through the work of theRed King returning to man the gnosis of the soul's transition fromimmortal being to eternal Godform.The Return of the Lost GnosisAs gnosis of the gates of the ancients is once again bestowed uponincarnate man, the lost wisdom will flow at the level of the soul to theywho are permitted entrance to these sacred realms. Those with enoughcourage to face the darkness and power of the endless void, those withenough love to balance the power of the Great Horned King Lucifer.The work within this book re-discovers the gnosis and power that canbe attained through the opening of ancient gateways with lost keysand seals.

Some ofthe workings within this book are therefore aimed at adjusting thereceptivity of both mind and soul to the energies of the various Godsand spirits who serve the Dark Queen Hecate.The Eye of the SunThe third eye of Lucifer can be seen by those who encounter Him inclose proximity, whether His chosen manifestation be that of HornedGod or mighty Witch Dragon. The energy of Lucifer's Emerald Eyemanifests as the Draconian glyph. This is the actual third Eye of theHorned King of Thaumiel.

Once the mind and soul are fully attuned the transitionthrough the gates of hidden knowledge may commence.The Rite of the TridentThis ritual begins as the Rite of the Trident, where all members of theTrident are called to initiate the proceedings. It is a working whichshould be performed under an open sky in a place where solitude canbe found. The spheres of power, if you possess them, should be usedwithin this ritual. Those who have successfully risen from the Rite ofthe Phoenix; as detailed in the book Queen of Hell; or have otherwiseobtained the crystal spheres of power will find them a powerful additionto this rite. One sphere is charged with the magickal essence of Hecate,this is the Obsidian Eye. The other clear quartzcrystal sphere is chargedwith the magickal essence of Lucifer. The sphere of Lucifer is the CrystalEy\". The spheres of power can be created by placing them at the pointof manifestation, during powerful ritual physical plane evocation, oftheir respective Witch Gods. These Eyes of the Gods will assist in theopening of many portals that are necessary to this work.For this rite, the Obsidian Eye of Hecate is placed at the NorthernQuadrant. That of Her consort is placed at the center of the circle, theaxis of power. Once the cloak of Hecate is cast and the elemental quartershave been opened, the Gate of the Abyss should be opened. This can bedone with the formula of the Tassatowah or any other preferred methodof opening this gateway of knowledge.

Whatever affects the being atsoul level will manifest one way or another within the incarnate form.All gnosis that is delivered en masse during powerful ritual work canbe stored at soul level to be retrieved through the rites of sexual magickand other methods of elevated consciousness at the earliest opportunity.This process of energy infusion within the soul; whether Empyrean,Infernal or Cosmic; gives the Witch Gods the ability to grant far moredetailed knowledge than can be retained by the mind alone. Providedthat the gnosis is retrieved, being filtered from the soul to the consciousmind, then there will be minimal disruption to mundane life. However,should the gnosis be ignored or held for too long then the amassingpower that is accumulated through further work and communicationwill attempt to surge through the gates of the soul to the consciousmind.

This will incur displeasure from theWitch Gods who are, in passing this powerful gnosis, attempting toassist the individual soul upon its path.Each loving connection with the Witch Gods, each new passing ofinformation and power is a transition in itself.

This will allow the entity to draw its full power and beinginto the permanent residence that has been created for it. This is a periodof gestation of the new body, a period of re-adjustment of environmentand empowering for the Devil's Familiar. The red, blue and green kalasof Belial, Lucifer and Hecate can be seen in the ether infusing the bodyof the toad flesh with energy. Exactly one week from the rite ofsummoning the familiar, the being now in its new body should betransferred from the gateway and placed in its own housing. An ornatebox or wooden pot, dedicated to the entity in the name of the Tridentof Witchcraft is ideal. This is the perfect self contained altar upon whichto place flowers, incense and other such offerings which are pertinentto the arte.

The truename of the Devil's Familiar that is granted unto you by the WitchGods must never be revealed to another. The seal alone cannot bindthis being.

If both seal and name are known by another then theymay call and bind the familiar to complete tasks for them.Should the body be somehow accidentally destroyed the familiar willremain in close proximity upon the inner planes until another isconstructed in which it may be housed. The bindings of blood, in ritual,to your soul will not be broken and the familiar will still be in yourservice. The re-construction of a new body is essential from theperspective of providing the necessary living footprint upon the materialplane. The ritual for the construction of a replacement body is muchthe same as the initial work with the exception that the being will alreadybe in the circle, upon the subtle planes.At the time of your own physical death it is imperative that the body ofyour familiar be burned, preferably with your own. Though this can bedone separately. If the being is not released by fire at the end of thisparticular incarnation it remains bound to the flesh body of the toad bythe sigils and gateways of the universe which were employed in theconstruction of this form. It will be held in partial limbo from its truetask and promised destiny. While still able to transcend the planes inorder to assist you it will be unable to totally free itself when the timecomes for it to join you at the throne of Hecate beyond your finalincarnation. A Demon familiar that is not released through the mediumof fire will become extremely unsettled if unable to re-join their masterand fulfill their own destiny and desire. Problems arising from such alack of diligence could be considerable, particularly for the living whoremain in close proximity to such beings. Once released by thedestruction of the body in fire the being will immediately return to theside of the soul of Witchblood to whom it was bound.Once fully integrated into your working craft the familiar will aid youin all your magickal and spiritual endeavours from basic ritual to theacquisition of further knowledge and power upon the path of soulevolution.

The tell-tale signs of widened pupils with greatlyenhanced depth and unnatural colour, revealing a little of the foreignintelligence which resides within are likely to be noticed only by onewho is aware of the actual possession.The Seal of Spirit BindingIn the creation of living vessels such as the body of flesh for the Devil'sFamiliar we can see that it is the sigils of the Witch Gods that bind thebeing to the body and ensorcell the required energy to make such workpossible. Once raised and contained by the forces of the Trident andthe Demon Princes the spirit is held and bound by the sigils of the mightywitch Gods. The sigils bind with the power of the Witch Godsthemselves! While this does not give the spirit called the power uponthe planes such as that which is granted to the toad dwelling Infernalfamiliar in the previous ritual, it does grant the ability to bind, controland hold a spirit to any specific object. This magick can be adapted tothe forceful summoning and binding of a spirit, in darker rites, untoany object such as a sigilised bone. Even sympathetic items may beused in this way. The malefic implications here should be more thanobvious. The crown of Lucifer, the Gateway to the City of Pyramidsand the sigil of Belial make a powerful triad of binding as the forces ofThaumiel flowing from the crown are balanced through Satariel andGhagiel. When used with the symbol of Malkuth in the centre of thetriad this is a very potent and dangerous binding seal that can be usedin the darkest of rites.

It is in death that the rite of passage, and as such theopen link for all who pass from their physical incarnation, is made. Theskull is the symbol which holds the power to channel the appropriateforces of the Witchcraft, opening the necessary portals through whichthis energy will be delivered in order to successfully evoke the denizensof other non-material plane realms.The Skull of Lucifer is both aglftand a ritual which grants the summonerthe ability to evoke with the will of the Lord of Ascending Flames.

Therefore a realskull may be used but a head of clay, fashioned in the shape of a skulland consecrated into the names of the Trident and bound into the serviceof Lucifer, is equally effective in this instance.The skull is used in conjunction with the Power Triad of the AversePentagram and the athame or sword.

Simplyplacing the skull in the external triangle of manifestation during anevocation of Lucifer will not fulfill the requirements of this rite. Whilethe skull will become charged with the immense energy of Lucifer whichmanifests within the triangle it will not provide the required link forchannelling the specific current of Lucifer that is needed for thisparticular ritual.

This is due to the nature of the vortex that is created within thecircle by the Horned One when He attends the ritual to deliver this giftof His arte. The vortex may be glimpsed as the shapes of those whoaccompany the Lord of Thaumiel circumambulate in rapid motionaround the inner edge of the circle. The noise within the vortex is veryaudible, sounding like something akin to a raging torrent of water andgrinding metal. This is the true speech of the Gods. This is their languageof symbols, the universal language of the Gods, that which causes manto speak in strange tongues during the works of possession.This vortex is one which may be used by the Witchkin of the Trident intwo-way travelling and communication. It is one of the secret pathwaysthrough which huge amounts of energy and gnosis can be delivered atthe level of the soul by the Witch Gods.

Thismagickal process grants the Keys to the Gates of Forbidden Knowledge.The Eye of Belial ignites the forces below Ghagiel illuminating verysecret paths which lead through the realm of Thaumiel.

They are essential to spiritualevolution serving within themselves as powerful initiations to the mind,heart and soul of all who receive them. As part of the consumate journeyalong the Path of Flame, these dark rituals must be absorbed andunderstood to bring the soul into the correct balance of light and darkin order for it to enter Atlantis.The Path of Ghagiel grants the soul power that is necessary to effectivelyemploy these rites, manifesting their considerable currents upon theinner and material planes.

Power wielded by the hands of the Gods isaimed at the soul for two main reasons. The first being that the truemotive for any attack, though directed by the ego, is often held aboveand beyond the politics of the mind originating from a deeper routeddesire to harm at soul level. The second is simply that the soul is thehigher form which gives life to the incarnate body and any damageinflicted at this level is rapidly and permanently reflected upon theincarnate being responsible for the attack. The Gods of the Trident donot deal in half measures.The Wrath of the GodsThis ritual must be performed under an open sky within a cast circleupon the first night of the waning moon. The circle is to be markedupon the ground in the dirt.
