These practices are also viewed as fearful and dangerous, however, as they shatter and rebuild every single aspect of individual psyche, personal life and the whole perception of the surrounding world. Not everyone is ready for this change, and for many potential initiates, the Path becomes a horrible trau­ma instead of a beautiful and liberating spiritual adventure. The teachings revealed in this book are not for everyone either. Casual experimentation with this Work is strongly discouraged, as these rituals open the gateways of the soul that can never be closed again. The Gnosis of Tiamat, the Pri­mal Dragon Goddess, is terrifying, demanding and transformative on all possible levels of existence. It will take the practitioner to the very Womb of Chaos where the soul will be devoured, dissolved, transformed and reborn, in order to become the Dragon in essence, the living incarnation of this primordial Current.Even though Tiamat and the myth of Creation, which inspired the Work of this grimoire, are derived from the ancient Babylonian lore, the ritual sys­tem presented here can hardly be called “Babylonian magic,” and it does not claim to be such. There are no archeological findings or historical accounts that would confirm any form of worship of the primal gods or demonic be­ings created by the Dragon Goddess.

Instead, they constitute a frame­work for the application of Gnosis that was revealed through the teachings of the demon-gods themselves and are laid down here specifically for those who seek self-deification in the modern world. This is a book for occult prac­titioners of the present century.The foremost inspiration for the Work described in this book was the Babylonian epic known as the Enuma Elish. The research literature on the myth of Creation is almost solely focused on Marduk and his role in Babylonian magic and religion, while Tiamat and her Children are hardly mentioned at all. The only available information is the analysis of the elev­en demon-gods from the linguistic perspective and their occasional meta­phorical interpretations, such as their connection to astrology, which is the domain which made the Babylonians famous across the ancient world. The original magical meaning, however, seems to be lost. In this book, there are no rituals and workings devoted to Marduk. I leave this field to his follow­ers and devotees. This is the book of Tiamat and the primal demon-gods who were born in her Black Waters of Chaos. Here, we will look at each de­mon-god from their historical and linguistic meaning, as well, but the main purpose of this grimoire is to present the Children of Tiamat from their esoteric perspective and to explore their magical powers as they manifest to the modern practitioner. The linguistic and astrological interpretation quot­ed in this grimoire is based on such works as Stephen Langdon’s Babylonian Epic of Creation, F.A.M. Wiggerman’s Mesopotamian Protective Spirits and Leonard King’s Enuma Elish, The Seven Tablets of Creation. For other sourc­es, it is recommended to view the bibliography listed by the end of this book.The occult interpretation and the practical part of this grimoire is based on materials gathered during my personal work with Tiamat and her de- mon-gods in the years 2007-2012. The Work started as a magical project conducted by Lodge Magan, the occult ritual group that was founded in the beginning of the last decade in order to earth and channel the Dra­conian Current through practical application of the Left-Hand-Path phi­losophy. The purpose of the project, which started by the end of 2007, was to gather information about the nature of the eleven spirits, their magical powers and methods of how they can be used for self-initiatory work in the magic of the twenty-first century. The project was also conducted in several phases, according to a carefully chosen curriculum, which included a wide— и—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Introductionspectrum of practices, from simple visual meditations, scrying and dream travels to more advanced works of invocation, evocation, journeys through hidden gateways and dimensions and exploration of forgotten worlds and lost temples.The teachings presented on the pages of this grimoire are derived from my personal experience, but they were also tested by ritual friends, part­ners and those who sought knowledge and power in the Gnosis of the Pri­mal Dragon Goddess. Those reluctant to work with “unverified gnosis” will not find it here. All rituals described in this book were performed and their results were verified to prove their efficacy, both through self-initia­tory work and through manifestation of their results on the physical plane. Therefore, they provide a solid ritual system which lays foundations for the further work with this forgotten Gnosis. It is my personal hope and wish that this book will find its way into the hands of those who will not hesitate to embark on the journey to the Womb of Darkness, reach for the primal wisdom and power and carry the Dragons Fire as a torch to illuminate the Path for others.—in—"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PrimalDraconian Gods"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Tiamat,Her Origin and MythologyEnuma Elishhe story of Tiamat and her eleven monsters derives from the Bab­ylonian Creation epic, the Enuma Elish, named after its opening words, “When in the height.” Also known as The Seven Tablets of Creation, this epic is one of the central works in Babylonian mythology and one of the oldest Creation legends in the world. The myth exists in several versions from Babylonia and Assyria, the most known being the one found in Nineveh, in the library of King Ashurbanipal, which dates to the 7th cen­tury BCE. The legend itself, however, is far older and it is estimated to be dated as far back as the 18th century BCE, the time of a prominent status of the god, Marduk, the leading deity of the Babylonian pantheon, who also occupies the central position in the story.The Enuma Elish was first recovered by Henry Layard in 1849 in Nineveh and published by George Smith in 1870s as The Chaldaean Account of Gene­sis. It consists of about 1000 lines on seven clay tablets. The fifth tablet is par­ticularly damaged and its content has never been recovered in full. The most important, however, is the text of the fourth tablet, which was published in 1887 by E.A. Wallis Budge and translated by A. Sayce. The central theme of the myth is the elevation of Marduk above all other Babylonian gods and his creation of the world and mankind from the primordial Darkness and Chaos, which he closed within the frames of a structured order. Therefore, the whole story presented in the Enuma Elish is, in fact, a praise of Marduk, the creator of heaven and earth, and the lord of the world.—3—"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of TiamatFrom the account of Akkadian rituals described in Rituels Accadiens by F. Thureau-Dangin (1921), we learn that the epic was recited in Babylon during celebrations of the New Year. On the second day of the festival, a priest of Marduk recited a hymn about the victory of the god over Tiamat and her allies. On the third day, artists made two statues for the celebrations: one holding a viper (basmu) and the other holding a scorpion (akrabamelu) in their left hands, which are both animals that represented the defeated monsters of Tiamat. On the fourth day, the chief priest recited the epic of Creation. And on the sixth day, the heads of the statues were cut off and burnt in order to re-enact the defeat of Tiamat s army. The remaining days were devoted to the praise of the gods and on the eleventh day, the gods returned to their temples and the celebrations were over. The epic had a sim­ilar status in Assyria, though with one major difference - Marduk was here replaced by Asur, the chief Assyrian deity.According to the legend, in the beginning, there was nothing but the world of primordial waters swirling in Chaos, undifferentiated and in­finite. Then, the waters divided into sweet, fresh waters of Apsu and salty waters of Tiamat, the two primeval gods, traditionally depicted as the male and the female, the first divine couple, and the parents to all gods and all life. Apart from them, there was also a mysterious entity named Mum- mu, which took the form of the mist floating above the waters and was sometimes referred to as “the vizier” of Apsu. The union of the primordial couple gave birth to the other deities: Lahmu and Lahamu, who, in turn, were parents of Anshar and Kishar (identified with the heaven and the earth). These two had a son, Anu, who fathered Nudimmud, the greatest of the gods (god Ea). The younger gods were very loud and disturbed the sleep of Apsu, distracting him from his rest. Upon the advice of Mummu, his vizier, he decided to kill them, but Tiamat strongly opposed the plan. In order to prevent the murder, she warned Nudimmud, who put a spell on Apsu and killed him, creating his abode on the remains of his slain father. Now, Nudimmud became the chief god and with his consort, Dam- kina, he had a son, Marduk, who was even more powerful than himself. When Marduk was playing with winds, creating storms and tornadoes, he disturbed the sleep of the old gods again. Enraged by the noise, they per­suaded Tiamat that she should seek revenge for the death of her husband. Upon their advice, she took another consort, the god Kingu, and gave him command over her new army - the eleven terrible monsters whom she had-4-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Tiamat, Her Origin and Mythologycreated to fight in the war. These eleven monsters represent her eleven dark powers which oppose the powers of the Light. Tiamat also bestowed on Kingu the Tablet of Destinies, a mythical emblem of the supreme authority over the universe. Until that moment, this dominion had belonged to the Mother Goddess alone, the supreme mistress of the universe and all Cre­ation. The younger gods chose Marduk as their champion and commander of their army, and endowed him with the power of the four winds. In the battle which took place between the worlds, Marduk defeated Tiamat and split her flesh into two halves. From one of them, he fashioned the earth and from the other, the sky. Her weeping eyes became the source of the rivers and her breasts formed the mountains of the earth. He took the Tablet of Destinies from Kingu, and he forced the gods who sided with Tiamat to work in service for the other gods. Eventually, he killed Kingu and from his blood, Nudimmud (Ea) created mankind whose task was to replace the gods in their work. Babylon was established as the residence of the chief gods and Marduk was elevated by receiving fifty names in praise of his great powers.The First MotherIn the Enuma Elish, Tiamat is described as “Ummu-Hubur who formed all things.” The name “Hubur” sometimes refers to the river in the under­world. She is also related to the Hebrew concept of Tehom, the great deep of the primordial waters. Tiamat and Apsu personify the cosmic abyss filled with primal energies which preceded the original Creation, while Apsu s vi­zier, Mummu, is thought to be the archetypal watery form, and his name is sometimes translated as “mold, matrix.”1 The ancient Mesopotamians be­lieved that the world was a flat circular disc surrounded by a saltwater sea. The earth was a continent which floated on a second sea, the freshwater apsu from which all waters, including springs, rivers, wells and lakes, flowed on the land. The sky was a solid disc above the earth, which curved to touch the earth at its rim. The heaven, or the habitation of the gods, was above the sky.The first Mother Goddess was the primordial source of all life, the embodiment of Primal Chaos, the Cosmic Womb which gave birth to all gods and all souls. She held dominion over the forces of Creation and she possessed the power to shape destinies, which is symbolic of the supreme1 Thorkild Jacobsen: The Treasures of Darkness. A History of Mesopotamian Religion-5-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatauthority over the whole universe. In the Enuma Elish, “when of the gods none had been called into being, and none bore a name, and no destinies were ordained,” she was the first force of Creation, the origin of life, the source of all movement and evolution. However, when she turned against her own children, the younger generation of gods, she also became the force of destruction, the devouring monster, the ever-gaping womb and the moth­er of abominations. Once a caring and nurturing parent, she turned into a vengeful warrior goddess, the mother of monsters and all evil of the world.As the goddess of primordial waters, Tiamat was often portrayed in a monstrous, bestial form and imagined as a sea serpent or a dragon. However, not much is known about her appearance from the myth itself. In this sense, she is identified with the sea monsters from other mythologies, such as the biblical Leviathan, Yamm and Lotan from the Hebrew myths or Tannin, the sea demon from the Jewish legends. Etymologically, her name corresponds to such terms as the Greek word thalassa, “sea,” Semitic tehom, “abyss,” Ak­kadian ti’amtum and tamtu, “sea,” or Sumerian ti and ama, meaning “life” and “mother.” Francois Lenormant, in his Chaldean Magic Its Origin and Development, mentions also such names as Tauthe of Damascius and Tha- vath-Omoroca, the latter being a form of the Great Mother as a type of the watery abyss, possibly inspired by the account of the Creation given by Ber- ossus in his History of Babylonia. There are also many theories concerning the possible meaning of the myth, in which the primordial state of “mixing of the waters” is interpreted as the meeting of salty and fresh waters in the Persian Gulf; the creation of gods and monsters is thought to refer to the rise of volcanoes and tectonic movements; or the battle of Tiamat and Marduk is viewed as a cosmic catastrophe in which the presently existing planets were created. Since no unanimous interpretation exists, the myth still leaves a great field for possible speculations.Tiamat, above all, is the universal Mother who gives birth to all creation in her womb, the salty waters. This was the original habitation of the gods before Marduk created the earth and chose Babylon as his residence, while the gods moved to live in the heaven. Marduk does not possess the natural power of creation - his power is the divine speech, the attribute of all patri­archal gods from worlds religions. In the Enuma Elish, he has to prove that he possesses this power before he is allowed to face Tiamat in the battle. He is given a garment which he has to destroy and restore by the power of his word before he is entrusted by the gods as their champion.-6"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Tiamat, Her Origin and MythologyAs the Mother of Creation, Tiamat is sometimes identified with the Sumerian goddess, Nammu, the mistress of the primordial sea who gave birth to An and Ki, the heaven and the earth. They both were thought to per­sonify the constellation in the northern sky known today as “the whale.” In ancient times, it was called by the names of sea monsters, Tiamat or Cetus. It is located in the region of the sky known as the Water, along with other watery constellations, such as Aquarius, Pisces or Eridanus. In the myth of Enki and the creation of man, Nammu (also called Ninmah) is described as “the primeval sea,” “the mother who gave birth to all the gods.” Enki seeks her assistance in his work of creation, as he himself has no power to fashion a human being:“О my mother, the creature whose name you uttered, it exists,Bind upon it the image of the gods;Mix the heart of the clay that is over the abyss...You, do bring the limbs into existence...;О my mother, decree its fate.”2The creature fashioned by Enki is feeble and weak, for only the Mother Goddess has the power to create life and breathe the soul into the vessel of clay.But the salty waters of seas and oceans can hardly be considered a nour­ishing substance. They do not quench the thirst of living beings and they do not make the crops grow. The waters of Tiamat are dissolving, corroding, poisonous and deadly. Opposed to them are the fresh waters of Apsu, the source of all lakes, rivers, springs and wells, the life-giving waters of the earth. Apsu, abzu, or engur (or engurru), originally part of the cosmic Cha­os, was transformed into the source of nourishing waters existing under the ground, as subterranean reservoirs and the veins of the earth. The name of this principle, as well as the mythology, depends on the tradition. The Ak­kadian and Assyrian abzu or apsd was the subterranean ocean, but it was also the great reservoir of cosmic waters surrounding the earth. In Sumerian legends, apsu is the kingdom of Enki (Ea), “the lord of wisdom,” but also the abode of sea monsters that are sent after Inanna when she descends to the watery abyss in order to obtain the me’s, the divine decrees, which she needs to win the authority over the gods. The watery kingdom is transformed into the house of wisdom after Apsu is slain by his eldest son, but it retains its2 Samuel Noah Kramer: The Sumerians. Their History, Culture, and Character-7-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatchaotic and destructive quality, still personified by monsters and abomina­tions of the sea. Enki’s temple in the city of Eridu was believed to be built on apzu and known as “the house of cosmic waters.” From there, Enki (Ea) controlled Mummu, “the original watery form,” thus creating and shaping the world with the multiplicity of forms, while Apsu himself remained mo­tionless and still, resting in eternal sleep. Mesopotamian temples often had pools or watery basins which represented the concept of apsu, the subterra­nean source of water.The Dragon-Slaying MythIn Mesopotamian tradition, we can find several versions of the legend in which the primordial monster is slain by a god or a hero who represents the new world order. Marduk’s defeat of Tiamat is the one that inspired the work of this grimoire, therefore it deserves to be discussed in detail. It is also worth mentioning that Tiamat was not the only dragon slain in the cosmic transition from Chaos to Order. Most of these stories refer to killing a ser­pent, a dragon or a monster that lives in the bottom of the Great Below, in the realm of primeval waters.The Sumerian god of stormy south wind, Ninurta, is the main character of another dragon-slaying myth called “The Feats and Exploits of Ninur­ta.” This time, the adversary is Asag, the demon of sickness and disease, whose abode is the nether world, or Kur. With the destruction of Asag, the primeval waters of the Kur rise to the surface and cover the land of Sumer. The fresh waters are flooded by poisonous waters of the underworld and all vegetation withers. Famine roams across the land and the great calamity falls upon the fields and the cities. Ninurta has to set up a pile of stones like a great wall to divide Sumer from the Kur and to hold back “the mighty waters.” Asag is pictured as a dragon and he seems to be an entity related to Tiamat. Even though these two mythological figures cannot be identified, Asag can be rather viewed as one of Tiamat’s Children, monsters born in her Womb, dwelling among the primordial waters of Chaos.Another Sumerian dragon-slaying myth is the story of the water-god, Enki, defeating “the monster Kur” who abducted the sky-goddess, Ereshki- gal, into the underworld. The legend is incomplete and the ending is miss­ing, but from the existing parts, we learn that he attacked Enki’s boat with the primeval waters which were his domain. Hence, he seems to be but an­other monster related to the Dragon Goddess.*8*"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Tiamat, Her Origin and MythologyThe monster Kur is also the adversary in the myth of Inanna’s glorifica­tion of power. In the story, the goddess of love and battle decides to proclaim her supremacy over the demon and unless he submits to her might and pow­er, she declares to destroy him. And so, she opens the “house of battle” and defeats the monster, after which she gains the epithet “destroyer of Kur,” regularly ascribed to her in the hymns.3Finally, there is also the story of the hero Gilgamesh who kills the mon­ster Huwawa, the guardian of the Cedar Forest, or “Land of the Living ” Huwawa is not, however, a watery demon and he has no direct connection to the primordial waters of the Void. Nevertheless, the story might have been the original source of the legend of St. George slaying the dragon. Also, his appearance implies that he was born in the Womb of Chaos, like the other monsters and demons spawned by Tiamat. His face is described as com­posed of coiled entrails of men and beasts, sometimes resembling a lion, and he can kill with his gaze alone. His roar is the flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire. He is fearsome and terrifying, and he possesses powers that surpass the skills of any human being. Gilgamesh has to trick him to give up these powers before he can eventually defeat him.The monstrous forms of demons composed of parts borrowed from an­imals and beasts were symbolic of the primordial character of beings born in the darkness of chaos, in the Primal Womb of the Dragon. Tiamat herself came to be depicted as a hybrid of animal parts, reflecting the disorder of the primordial Darkness, the abyss of non-being. In a bas-relief found in the temple of Ninib at Nimriid, depicting her fight with Marduk, she has the body, the head and the fore-legs of a lion and the wings, the tail and the hind claws of an eagle. The neck and the upper part of the body are covered with feathers or scales. She represents all that is terrifying, the foul, the abominable, and she is the Mother and the Queen of all fiends, demons and monsters. She is all that lurks behind the Gates of the Night, beyond the safe boundaries of human perception. She manifests through dreams and nightmares, the unknown and the unconscious. The younger generation of gods, however, is usually presented in the human form, in order to represent the comprehensible world, the visible and the familiar.There is also an interesting description of Tiamat in another myth of Marduk (Bel) defeating the monster. The Dragon Goddess is huge and mea­sures fifty kaspu (which was the space that could be covered in two hours3 Samuel Noah Kramer: Sumerian Mythology9-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamattravel, i.e. six or seven miles) in length and one kaspu in height, with the mouth reaching six cubits (traditional unit of length, based on the length of the forearm) and a tail so long that it reaches the sky. This gives a picture of a giant monster with the body extending for over three hundred miles and raising the head in the air to a height of six or seven miles.4The Primal ChaosThe motif of Chaos preceding creation is found in mythologies worldwide. It is usually described as Darkness or Night, the Void, the Gaping Abyss, or Ocean of Black Waters. In the Greek lore this is Tartarus, in Scandinavian myths it is Ginnungagap, Egyptian cosmogony includes the primeval ocean of Nun, and in the Sumerian tradition we have the primordial watery abyss of Apsu and Tiamat. The Womb of Chaos is the birthplace and the abode of dragons, giants, monsters, demons, and primal gods. It is the tohti wa- Ыгдкй, the formless void described in Genesis. The black waters of the First Mother are like the cosmic ocean of Nun. She is called the Deep, the Void, the Womb, and the Abyss. Gerald Massey associates the waters of Nun with Tepht, the abyss, the source of all life, and equates them with Tiamat, the Great Mother. Tepht is the well from whence the waters issue, the dwelling underground, where the Dragon gave birth to her brood of monsters on the earth. It is the “lair of the dragon,” “the hole of the snake.”5 It is also the mythical birthplace of life and vegetation, water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe, the womb of the Cosmic Mother.As the watery Chaos, Tiamat is identified with the Hebrew concept of Tehom, which means “the deep.” There is also a slight resemblance between these two accounts of Creation, as they both include the motif of dividing the waters under the firmament from the waters above. In the Babylonian myth, Marduk splits the body of Tiamat and from her flesh, he fashions the firmament which keeps her upper waters in place, forming the heavenly ocean above the covering of heaven. It is not clear what happens to the lower waters, but a part of them is believed to form Hubur, the river of the un­derworld. The epic also mentions the so-called Ti-amat e-li-ti and Ti-amat sap-li-ti, the Upper Tiamat and the Lower Tiamat, which are equivalents of the waters above and under the firmament.6 And although there are several4 Leonard W. King: Enuma Elish5 Gerald Massey: Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World6 Leonard W. King: Enuma Elish-10-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Tiamat, Her Origin and Mythologyother cosmogonic concepts in the Mesopotamian lore, in all of them, the origin of life and all Creation is the primeval sea which was not created but exists eternally, with no beginning and no end. The primordial waters be­get the heaven and the earth, at first united together as the cosmic moun­tain, then differentiated into the male and the female in order to conceive the younger generations of gods. The Primal Mother is either the sea or the earth, identified with such goddesses as Ninmah, “great queen;” Ninhursag, “queen of the cosmic mountain;” or Nintu, “queen who gives birth.” The world is composed of Heaven, consisting of the sky and the space above the sky which is called “the great above,” and Earth, consisting of the surface of the earth and “the great below” which is thought to be the underworld and the abode of chthonic deities.7The primal Mother Goddess in the Mesopotamian lore is the “first one, who gave birth to the gods of the universe,” “the Mother of Everything,” the self-procreating womb, the goddess without a spouse, the primal matter. She is “the womb of abundance,” the fertile and fertilizing waters which create spontaneously, All in One, the universe as a whole. She is the Primal Dragon of the Void, the Single Mother, the self-contained Womb. The division of pri- ma materia into the masculine and the feminine element is the beginning of the process of Creation. These two primary constituents of the universe are Apsti and Tiamat. The “mingling of the waters” is symbolic of their unity, and they together are thought to constitute the First Dragon, the Abyss, the primal matter of the world. But this also represents their sexual union and the beginning of the cosmic sexual current which underlies the creation of all life in the universe. For this reason, they can be viewed as extension of the Primal Dragon of the Void, or as the first gods torn from the undiffer­entiated body of the Dragon, the Primal Ocean of Black Waters. As the First Manifestation of the Dragon, Tiamat possesses all the powers of the Mother of Everything. She can “mingle” her waters with the male principle in order to create gods, but she can also conceive monsters and demons by herself, tearing them from her boundless flesh, cloaking them with godlike powers and elevating above all other creations. This is the power that belongs to the First Mother alone. Tiamat is, at the same time, the Primal Dragon, the first cosmic force in itself and the first manifestation of the Dragon. However, in the Mesopotamian lore, the original, formless mass or watery matter was called Apsu, which was later the name of the first male deity, and to whom7 Samuel Noah Kramer: Sumerian Mythology-11-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatthe mythology attributed the same powers of creation as to the Dragon Goddess Tiamat. Through the Work with Draconian manifestations, gods, demons and other entities, we can access the original power of the Primal Dragon, which is formless, disordered, nameless, and boundless. This is the mystery of the First Mother which is revealed through the rites of her Dra­conian Alchemy.Tiamat was slain by Marduk in the battle for the new cosmic order, but she remains slumbering under the foundations of the world, ready to awak­en and rise, to shake and devour the creations of gods and the civilizations of man, for she is the one who gives birth to all things and swallows them in the eternal cosmic cycle. Her flesh and bones constitute the structure of the world, her blood flows through the veins of all living beings on the earth, and her primal consciousness dwells at the root of the human mind, reflect­ing the myth of the Primal Dragon in human biological pattern and in the reptilian origin of human brain stem. She is the Inner Dragon, the Dragon Within, the Serpent Kundalini, which awakens and opens consciousness for the flow of the Ophidian and Draconian currents. She is the force that can­not be tamed or locked within the boundaries of a structured order. Her timeless essence is boundless. She rises from within, lilting the soul beyond the Gates of the Night, where consciousness is shattered in the Womb of Chaos, decomposed and stripped from mundane conditioning. She is the Seducer to the wanderers on the Path of Flames who emblazes the divine spark in their blood. She is the Mother to those who dare to descend into the Heart of Darkness in order to be reborn in her Womb and to rise to the heights of heavens on her flaming wings. And she is also the Destroyer of the weak and the false, those who choose stagnation and ignorance over desire and evolution.But Tiamat is also the Dragon Without, the fearsome force of Nature. The thunderstorms, the fire in the volcanoes, the ferocity of hurricanes and tornadoes, the destructive force of floods, the sudden terror of lightning - Tiamat wields all the powerful and ominous weather phenomena that have never been tamed by man. Her energy constitutes the magnetic field of the whole planet and flows through the mystical veins of the earth in the form of “dragon lines,” or “ley lines,” which are believed to connect the pow­er spots (ancient vortices of cosmic energy) or “the chakras of the earth.” These vortices resonate with the Dragon energy, which can be tapped by the mind aligned with the Draconian Current, by those who have awakened the-12"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Tiamat, Her Origin and Mythologyprimal essence of the Dragon within their consciousness.

Her power grows and she creates 11 terrifying monsters, clothed with terror and filled with poison instead of blood. They are fearsome and godlike, embodying the most destructive qualities of the furious Goddess. These 11 monsters are mentioned as vipers, dragons, hur­ricanes, raging hounds, scorpion-men, mighty tempests, fish-men and rams. Primal gods, such as Lahamu, side with Tiamat and they are included into her army of demons as well. Among the gods, she elevates Kingu, her second husband, to lead the army, and bestows on him the Tablet of Destinies, the supreme dominion over the universe.“Ummu-Hubur who formed all things,Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster- serpents,Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.She set up vipers and dragons, and the monster Lahamu,And hurricanes, and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,And mighty tempests, and fish-men, and rams;They bore cruel weapons, without fear of the fight.Her commands were mighty, none could resist them;-16-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Battle of Light and DarknessAfter this fashion, huge of stature, she made eleven [kinds of] monsters.Among the gods who were her sons, inasmuch as he had given her support,She exalted Kingu; in their midst she raised him to power.To march before the forces, to lead the host,To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,To direct the battle, to control the fight,Unto him she entrusted; in costly raiment she made him sit, saying:I have uttered thy spell, in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power.The dominion over all the gods have I entrusted unto him.Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,May they magnify thy name over all of them the Anunnaki.She gave him the Tablets of Destiny, on his breast she laid them, saying:Thy command shall not be without avail, and the word of thy mouth shall be establishedUpon the threat of war, the younger gods are struck by terror and un­able to face the forces of Darkness. At first, they try to appease Tiamat, but her fury is too great and they flee at the very sight of her wrath. Then, Ea’s son, Marduk, offers to act as the champion of the gods and defeat Tiamat and her allies. Being a solar deity, the greatest of all the powers of Light, Marduk becomes naturally the adversary of the Dragon Goddess and her powers of Darkness. At the great council with a banquet, he proves that he is the worthy to fight on behalf of the gods by demonstrating his creative and destructive powers, and he is given the royal insignia: the sceptre, the throne and the ring. Then, he prepares himself for the fight by taking a bow, a spear and a club. He fills his body with fire and sets the lightning in front of him. He fashions a net with which he intends to catch Tiamat, and he places the four winds near it to prevent her from escaping. He also creates evil winds, tempests and the hurricane to assist him, and finally, mounting his chariot upon the storm with a thunderbolt in his hand, he sets out to face Tiamat. The monsters and fiends are smitten with fear at the mere sight of his power, but Tiamat strikes with spells and incantations. Her attack fails, however, and she is killed and split asunder. Marduk smashes her skull with his club and scatters her blood to the north wind. He catches the 11 monsters in his-17-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatnet and tramples upon their bodies as they lie helpless. He takes the Tablet of Destinies from Kingu, seals it with his own seal and lays it on his own breast.“When he had slain Tiamat, the leader,Her might was broken, her host was scattered.And the gods her helpers, who marched by her side,Trembled, and were afraid, and turned back.They took to flight to save their lives;But they were surrounded, so that they could not escape.He took them captive, he broke their weapons;In the net they were caught and in the snare they sat down.”What follows the battle is the act of Creation, the transition from Chaos to Order. Marduk splits the body of Tiamat into two parts. From one half, he fashions the dome of heaven and from the other, he constructs the abode of his father, which he places over the Deep, i.e. Apsu. Between the waters of Tiamat and the newly created world, he places a “bolt” and a “watchman” to ensure that the Primordial Chaos will not threaten the new Order.“He split her up like a flat fish into two halves;One half of her he established as a covering for heaven.He fixed a bolt, he stationed a watchman,And bade them not to let her waters come forth.”Now, he creates E-sara, the mansion of heaven, the dwelling place of the gods, and he continues the process of Creation by organizing the planets and the stars, regulating the sun and the moon and establishing the calendar. He sets the Signs of the Zodiac and associates each sign with a particular month. Then, however, the gods begin to complain that their existence is barren because they lack worshippers who would build them temples and bring offerings. For this reason, Marduk decides to create a human being. Upon Ea’s advice, he chooses to sacrifice one of the gods and use the divine blood for his new creation. At the council of the gods, the choice falls on Kingu, who was the instigator of the fight and who was held captive after the defeat of Tiamat. Marduk kills him and from his blood, the god, Ea, fashions mankind for the service of the gods. Now, the gods who sided with Tiamat and were initially forced into labor for the service of the victorious deities are freed from their work and replaced by man. Babylon is established as the residence of Marduk and he is given 50 names and chosen as the supreme-18-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Battle of Light and Darknessruler of the world and the king of all the gods. The last part of the epic con­tains a long praise of the chief god and his glorious accomplishments.It is worth notice that initially Marduk planned to form man from his own blood mixed with earth. Such account was given by Berossus in the 3rd century BCE in the myth of Bel (Marduk) and Tiamat. In the Babylonian epic, Marduk also declares to create a “bone” for forming man. It is inter­esting to note that the Assyrian word for “bone” used in the text (issimtu) is the equivalent of the Hebrew word esem (“bone”), which is used in the nar­rative of the creation of woman in Genesis.8 The blood of Bel was used not only in the creation of man, but also in that of animals. Man, however, was the culmination of Marduk’s creative work, even though the original role of humanity seems to be rather dismal and pitiful, as they were created solely for the work of the gods, with no higher purpose whatsoever. In Mesopota­mian religious practice, this belief was interpreted in a literal sense and the deities in the temples, likewise the king, were clothed, fed, cared for, etc. by the courtiers and priests. The legend of Marduk served as the foundation of patriarchal religion based on the worship of the solar deity. The representa­tive of the chief god, the king, his consort, children or the “servant gods” all received the service of the rest of mankind.From magical perspective, however, the key to understand the meta­physical meaning of the myth rests on the motif of primordial Chaos being bound and locked within the structures of the new world Order. Marduk defeated Tiamat and her spawn, but did not destroy them. Instead, he made an attempt to tame and suppress these forces by including them in the new­ly created structure of the universe. Tiamat’s soldiers became his trophies; they were disarmed and several of them became the servants of Marduk and later, came to be recognized as his symbolic animals, like e.g. the musussu serpent. Tiamat herself became the part of the world as the Living Nature and the embodiment of the “mother earth” concept. The blood of Kingu, demon warrior-god, was believed to flow in humans, its demonic element being bound and dormant. The archfiends of Primordial Chaos became now parts of the cosmic Order.But the Dragon’s breath can still be heard in the whisper of the wind, Draconian fire pulsates in the heart of the earth and the blood of man stirs when the slumbering Serpent shakes in her sleep. And what sleeps can be awakened.8 Leonard W. King: Enuma Elish-19-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godshe Hebrew concept of Tehom, associated with the Primal Dragon Goddess, in the Qabalah refers to the first of the seven “Infernal Habitations” which correspond to the Qlipoth. The Qlipoth are the “shells,” the realm of evil, the dark side of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. They are thought to be the debris left over from an influx of divine force too strong for the Sephiroth to withstand, which had poured out of the Tree and created an anti-world in the dark regions. They are inhabited by demons and malevolent spirits responsible for all evil in the world. The Qlipoth is the anti-structure to the Tree of Sephiroth, and while there are ten Sephiroth to signify the unity and perfection of God, there are eleven qlipoth to dis­turb the original balance represented by the number 10. The highest qlipha, Thaumiel, which stands in opposition to the divine unity of Kether, is split in two and called the Twin God. Each qlipha represents an adverse aspect of the corresponding sephira and is considered to be its anti-pole. These forces are sometimes identified with the eleven powers of Tiamat and her eleven demons. The whole Tree of Qlipoth is thought to be dark, feminine, and personified by a female deity - most often this is Lilith who acts as the first Adversary and Initiator of mankind, while the primal Dragon Goddess Tia­mat, who embodies the very source of the forces of Chaos, exists outside the structures of Creation and beyond emanations of Divine Light.The eleven monsters of Tiamat are mentioned in the Enuma , along with the terms that signify their nature or species, but not exactly their names. In the research literature, they are often treated as such and so, they are presented in this grimoire. Several of these names signify the plural and might refer to a group of entities. Within the rites of magic, these spirits may seem multiple indeed. This is because of their vast, complex and amorphous—21—"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatnature. They are also chaotic and disordered by nature and they may as­sume a great number of forms and shapes, shifting them within minutes of even seconds, splitting into multiple parts, or manifesting all of them at the same time, which gives an illusory impression that we are not dealing with a single entity but with a multiplicity of beings. This is both true and false. These are extremely powerful, god-like beings who exist on many levels at the same time, and thus, can assume hundreds of forms and manifest all of them together. But their shapes and manifestations constitute one force that should be called as a whole.From the myth, we learn that they are “sharp of tooth, merciless of fang,” their bodies filled with venom instead of blood, “clothed with ter­ror,” decked with splendor, god-like and powerful. Whoever beheld them was overcome with terror and none could withstand their attack. They are referred to as “matchless weapons” and enumerated in the following order: vipers and dragons, the monster Lahamu, hurricanes, raging hounds, scor­pion-men, mighty tempests, fish-men, and bison-men.From magical perspective, they constitute the eleven dark and destruc­tive powers of Tiamat and several of them may be also compared to the qlipothic forces of the Qabalistic Tree of Night. However, it would be rather artificial and limited if we tried to fit each of them into a concrete qlipothic level; their powers are too complex and their nature too chaotic to form an initiatory map of spiritual progress, as the Qabalistic Tree is understood by occult practitioners. There is even possibility that the story might be read in a literal way and that the monsters of Tiamat represent particular aspects of spiritual warfare. In the myth, they were created as an army with each of them as a type of weapon. This is also how these primal forces manifest most frequently in rites of magic. Modern practitioners can successfully use them for magical attack and defense, but their dissolving and venomous powers can also be employed in works of initiatory alchemy and used for self-empowerment. It is possible that a few of them might have connection to astrology indeed, which was suggested by historians and researchers of Babylonian magic and mythology. The historical sources, however, are not unanimous in their interpretation of particular creatures - a chosen mon­ster in one book is described with qualities which in another source are attributed to a completely different entity. Also, the results from practical work and magical research confirm the suggested attributes in several cases, but differ considerably in many others. But, then again, we should stress that22-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godsthe usual attributes were attached to the creatures on the basis of linguistic analysis of the words used in the Enuma Elish. In this book, we will broaden this perspective and present unknown aspects of the Mighty Eleven, which were lost over the ages but can still be accessed by the modern practitioner.But, were these entities really lost and their powers forgotten? To answer this question, we have to take a closer look at Mesopotamian myths and legends that follow the original story of Creation. As we already observed, the eleven monsters of Tiamat were bound and included in the new world structure by Marduk, and thus, forced to serve the gods of Light. From then on, they were believed to exist as signs of the Zodiac, as constellations, stellar forces and servants to the gods and guardians of their temples. Yet, there are enough references to demons, evil spirits, malevolent creatures, and un­quiet souls to prove that not all of them were bound and subjected to the rule of the gods. They haunt places where the veil between dimensions is thin, lurking behind the Gates of the Night, lying in wait for the doorways to open and let them into the world of man. They roam across deserts and wastelands, appear in desolate and abandoned sceneries and dwell in the bowels of the earth or on tops of mountains. These dark realms inhabited by demons and monsters are identified with the Qlipoth from Qabalistic legends, the abode of all Evil in the world. These hordes and legions of fiends dwell in the Womb of the Night, between spaces and dimensions, and each day they breed more horrors, waiting to invade the world and to destroy it, so that the Primal Chaos would reign once again.Ancient mythologies are full of legends of serpents and dragons dwell­ing beneath the earth or among the stars, of primordial beings and entities that existed before the creation of man, of monsters born in the Womb of Chaos. There are also mythological serpents that personify the Primal Cha­os itself, boundless Darkness existing outside the structures of the world, encircling the universe and holding the earth in their timeless coils. The Scandinavian Jormungandr, for instance, coils around Midgard, the world of man, while the Hindu serpent, Sesha, floats in the cosmic ocean, forming the bed of Vishnu, one the supreme gods in the Hindu religion. Sesha is the king of the Nagas, who were ancient deities depicted as snakes, primal beings of Creation. It is believed that when the Serpent uncoils, time moves forward and universes are created; when he coils back, worlds cease to exist. A similar function is attributed to the Egyptian serpent, Mehen, who coils around the Sun God, Ra, to protect him on his journey through the Ocean23-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatof the Night. He is called the Encircler and believed to be the Most Ancient One, the primal serpent-god who comes from primordial times before the creation of mankind.Mesopotamian myths and legends contain many references to demons and evil spirits whose nature seems primal, amorphous and chaotic. These spirits are the “wide-spreading clouds which darken the day” and storms and winds that “cannot be withstood.” They bring terror and gloom upon the world, wreak havoc and destruction across the fields and slay humans and animals alike. They dwell beneath the Mountain of Sunset, behind the Gates of the Night, in caverns of the earth and in desolate places. They have no name and are “unknown in heaven and earth.” In accounts gathered from the tablets, they are mentioned as evil spirits, whirlwinds, hag-demons, plague-gods, ghosts, devils that lie in wait in the desert, bad winds, the Evil Eye that “brings sickness upon men,” or demon-harlots who steal the semen to engender demons and haunt the houses of men to make them barren.From magical perspective, their powers manifest on both macrocosmic and microcosmic level. They are the principles of Primordial Chaos which act against the Divine Order: against Light, laws and regulations, civiliza­tion, religions, and the foundations of the world of man. But viewed as the Chaos Within, they also represent dark instincts, hidden lusts and savage urges that are atavistic, primal, inherent in the human soul, but repressed to the utmost regions of consciousness. On the microcosmic level, they are the antinomian impulses which drive man towards individual isolation and self-deification. They are the hurricane of change, initiators of movement and evolution, the divine flame of Becoming, manifestations of the primal Draconian force underlying the whole Creation.In Mesopotamian lore, however, these demons and evil spirits are also thought to act against man and their destructive powers are believed to cause weakness, diseases and death. They bring headaches, fever, pain, dysentery, tumors, ulcers, leprosy, seizures, and agony. They make men and women barren, slaughter people and tear out their hearts. They can set the house on fire, make crops wither and bring sickness to animals. These descriptions have a great resemblance to the powers of the Mighty Eleven as they are re­vealed in this grimoire. By means of malevolent magic, they can be bound to do the sorcerer’s bidding and to destroy the chosen target. Among works of malediction, the Assyrian formulas given in Chaldean Magic. Its Origin and Development list the following manifestations of a demonic attack:-24-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Gods“Painful disease of the bowels,The infirmity which makes gloomy and cuts...That which acts in the mouth, the poison noxious to the voice,The expectoration of the consumption which noxiously prostrates, Scrofula, pustules, falling off of the nails,Purulent eruptions, inveterate tetters,Shingles causing pits and scars,Leprosy covering the skin,Food which reduces the body of man to a skeleton,Food which eaten is returned again,Liquids which make the drinker swell,Fatal poison,The pestilential wind which comes from the desert and returns not,The frost which makes the earth to shiver,The excess of heat which makes the skin to crack,Evil destiny which unexpectedly cuts off a man’s career...”These maledictions and many others are taught by the particular de­mons of the Mighty Eleven when they are called to manifestation through the rites of evocation. In Akkadian and Assyrian spells, incantations and exorcisms, they are attributed to the works of evil spirits known as Utuq, Alai, Gigim, Telal, Gallu and Maskim. These entities are described as phan­toms, spectres, vampires, incubi, succubae, nightmares and spirits that can be bound by wicked sorcery to work evil against another human being. Te­lal, the bull demon, is possibly a form of Kusarikku, “the bison-man” from the Tiamat legend, but also the other beings are highly reminiscent of the Mighty Eleven. Many of them seem to have primal nature and their work is directed against the cosmic Order. They ravage the heaven and the earth, disturb the stars of the sky and interrupt the movement of planets, produc­ing “the evil command which comes from the midst of heaven; the evil des­tiny which issues from the depths of the abyss.” The whole world trembles at their wickedness and they can even threaten the gods. In exorcisms and incantations, it is usually Marduk, the chief of all gods, who is called to pro­tect man from their malevolent work. One of the incantations, quoted by Francois Lenormant in his Chaldean Magic, provides an interesting exam­ple of their attack:-25-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamat“The execrable Idpa acts upon the head of man,The malevolent Namtar upon the life of man,The malevolent Utuq, upon the forehead of man,The malevolent Alai upon the chest of man,The malevolent Gigim upon the bowels of man,The malevolent Telal upon the hand of man.”Those beings are believed to be wicked and evil by nature and “bad in themselves.” They feed on blood and bow to no gods. They manifest as winds whose burning breath favors the development of diseases, evil spirits of deserts and wilderness who torment mankind, dwellers of bleak summits of mountains, pestilential marshes, and sea demons and monsters. It was thought that “the Utuq inhabits the desert, the Mas dwells on the heights, the Gigim wanders in the desert and the Telal steals into towns.”9 Their orig­inal abode, however, is the desert and the exorcisms are used to send them back to their place of habitation. The desert in the lore of the Middle East seems to represent the original Abyss, the birthplace and the abode of all demons and evil spirits of the world.A popular practice in Mesopotamia was to avert the bad influence of one demon by using a talisman or a statue of another. Hence, the images and sculptures of demons and monstrous beasts were placed on the doors, above entrances and by the sides of the gates. It was also believed that those guardians were real spirits, bound by spells and magic of the gods. Such was the case of human-headed bulls that guarded the gateway to infernal regions at the Mountain of Sunset. According to the same belief, demons or genii watched over heavenly spheres and boundaries between the realm of Divine Order and the primordial Ocean of Chaos which existed outside the world created by the gods. These divine guardians were: the Sed, who was depicted as a bull with a human face, the Lamas, who was a lion with a man’s head, the Ustur, pictured in a human form and the Nattig, with the head of an eagle. In the Western lore, these entities would be later preserved as four symbolic creatures supporting the throne of Jehova, in the form of the so- called “tetramorph.”Monsters and demons served as guardians of temples and were depicted on the doors, placed as statues or carved on the walls, plagues, cylinders and decorations. In the Sumerian temple of E-ninnu, there were ornaments9 Francois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic. Its Origin and Development-26"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godson the door in the shape of idim (uridimmu), or “raging lions;” mus-sa-tur (basmu), i.e. “serpents;” and mus-hus, “terrible vipers and monsters.” Clay plaques from Akkadian period contain depictions of gods fighting monsters and demons, such as fiery Cyclopes, dragons, serpents, lions, dragon-ser­pents, winged beasts, etc. However, the primordial monsters were often depicted as companions, servants and guardians of the gods. The bound­ary-stones (kudurru) are the most characteristic monuments from the Kas- site period and they show Musussu, for example, as the dragon of Marduk, and the goat-fish (which is probably a reference to Kulullu) as the symbolic animal of the god, Ea. In depictions from the post-Kassite Babylonia, we can also see the bull and the lightning (the bull might refer to Kusarikku and the lightning bolt was symbolic of the weather demons) as the emblems of the storm Adad. The epithet of Adad was also “the great radiant bull” and he was pictured as a warrior wearing a helmet with bull horns, possibly an attribute acquired from the primordial demon-god, Kusarikku. Bulls, dragons and lions also appeared as ornaments on Nebuchadrezzar’s Ishtar Gate in Babylon, along the Processional Way, constructed in the 6th century BCE. Musussu, who became the “dragon of Marduk,” was usually depicted as a hybrid creature that was scaly-coated with the head bearing the double horns of the Arabian horned viper. The front legs of the creature were feline, the hind legs resembled the limbs of a bird of prey and the tail terminated in a scorpion sting.10It is also worth noticing that the scorpion-man was a popular entity in Babylonia and Assyria. It was often depicted on reliefs, as well as on bound­ary-stones, the most famous of which is the image of the creature that had the torso, head and arms of a human, the lower body of a scorpion and was aiming with a bow and arrow. Scorpion-men were popular guardians and openers of the way to the Underworld. In the legend of Gilgamesh, they guarded the gates to the land of the Kur at the mountains of Mashu through which the Sun God, Shamash, traveled at night. They are demonic and fear­some. Their heads touch the sky and their glance is death. The scorpion was also the symbol of the goddess, Ishkhara, and represented the constellation and the Zodiac sign of Scorpio. Ishkhara was sometimes described as the scorpion goddess herself, or many-breasted Mother Scorpion who dwelt among the stars and nourished the souls of the dead with the milk from her breasts. Her sacred animals were the scorpion and the dragon.10 Joan Oates: Babylon-27-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of TiamatBut, there are also deities whose nature and attributes reflect the Dra­conian aspects of the Primal Chaos, the First Dragon Goddess. Among those worthy of special note is the goddess Nintu, sometimes identified with Ninhursag, who is associated with the creation of man from clay and blood. The number of votive figures offered to her by women who desired offspring suggests that among the people of Mesopotamia she occupied the position of the Mother Goddess. She was depicted with an elaborate tiara and veil, with a garment covering her loins, but she was uncovered above the waist and sometimes, she was pictured as suckling a child at the left breast. The upper part of her body was that of a naked woman and the lower part was scaly, like the skin of a snake, which represented her primal Draconian origin. It is interesting to note that the form of a half-woman half-snake is also often encountered among manifestations of serpent de­mons that belong to the eleven monsters of Tiamat. These entities usually appear in the female form, with snake or dragon scales, or with reptilian parts of the body. Nintu is possibly one of these primordial creatures, born in the Womb of Primal Chaos but incorporated into the Babylonian pan­theon and the new religious structure.The attributes of Tiamat, the First Mother, were also preserved in pow­ers and attributes of other female goddesses, such as Ninhursag, Namtu, Belit or Ishtar. The Akkadian Belit, or Belit-lli also goes by “Lady of the Gods,” “Lady of the Lower Abyss,” “Mother of the Gods,” “Queen of the Earth” and “Queen of Fertility.” These titles and functions belong to her, as well as to the other female deities who evolved on the concept of primor­dial humidity, which was the source of all life, originally called Tamti, the sea.”11 And even though there are many exorcisms of evil spirits in Mes­opotamian lore, there exists no exorcism of Tiamat, the Primal Dragon. She is the natural and indispensable part of the universe, and she cannot be banished, for the world would cease to exist without the Dragon force that constitutes the flesh and the soul of all living beings. She is believed to sleep below the surface of the earth, not dead but dormant, powerful, primal, fearsome and very real. Her powers can be tapped and accessed by those who do not fear to open the Gates of the Night and to walk through, those “who are skillful to rouse Leviathan.”1211 Francois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic. Its Origin and Development12 Job 3:8-28-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-GodsThe description of Nintu is quoted in R. Campbell Thomson’s Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia, alongside references to other gods and demons whose appearance reveals their Draconian origin. Among those beings, the author mentions a creature whose head is that of a serpent, ears like those of a basilisk, horns twisted into three curls, and the base of his feet are claws. His name is Sassu-urinnu and he is a sea monster, “a form of Ea,” which means that he probably comes from the primeval ocean of Apsii, or per­haps is one of the primordial beings born in the Womb of Tiamat. Another description refers to a female entity whose name is unknown, as it was not preserved on the tablets, but who is “the chosen of Ereshkigal.” She has the horns of a gazelle, one of which is bent over her back and the other grows straight over her face. She has the ear of a sheep, the fist of a man and the body of a fish with snake scales. Another nameless god mentioned on the same tablets has the face of a man, horns of an ox, wings of a bird and the body of a lion. There is also a being named Lahmu ippiru, with the tail of a lion and a body of a kissugu, who touches heaven and earth with his hands and legs. The primordial god, Lahamu, is described here, as well and he is depicted as a man from the waist to the loins. From the loins to the feet, he is a dog, and he has the wings of a bird, ears of an ox and a horn on his head. He also wears a headband and he is clothed with a doublet on his breast. The remaining descriptions refer to a god named Sulul, who has the face of a man and the body of a fish, Niziktum, who has the body of a naked woman and wings of a bird and a nameless goddess with a human body and the head of bird, while she wears a veil hanging from her head to her shoulders and two torches in her hands. These bestial parts of the body suggest the primal nature of the entities and they are also parts of the primordial demons of Tiamat. Snake heads, scale-covered bodies, claws and talons, fish parts and bird wings - these are all common attributes of the Mighty Eleven and man­ifestations of the Primal Chaos.The most popular theory in the source literature on the myth of Creation, however, is that the primordial monsters and god-like beings became the Babylonian Zodiac. E.A. Wallis Budge, in his book, Amulets and Supersti­tions, claims that the Signs of the Zodiac were none other than: Ummu-Khu- bur, i.e. Tiamat, Kingu (her husband), the Viper, the Snake, Lakhamu, the Whirlwind, the Ravening Dog, the Scorpion-Man, the Hurricane, the Fish- Man, the Horned Beast (Capricorn), and the Weapon (Thunderbolt). In oth­er words, these were the creatures originally created by Tiamat to fight in the-29-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatwar, including the demon-god Kingu and the Dragon Goddess, herself. This theory is based on conviction that the Signs of the Zodiac set up by Marduk were different from the old ones and replaced a system which pre-existed the rise of civilization founded on the laws of patriarchal religion. The new Signs were as follows: the Labourer (Goat), the Star and the Bull of Heaven (Bull), the Faithful Shepherd of Heaven and the Great Twins (Twins), Tor­toise (Crab), Great Dog/Lion (Lion), Virgin with ear of corn (Virgo), Zi- banitum (Scales), Akrabu (Scorpion), the god Enurta (Bow), the Goat-Fish (Capricorn), the Great Star (Water-bearer), and the Star and the Band of Fishes (the Fishes).The majority of knowledge about Mesopotamian demons is generally based on incantations, hymns, formulas and exorcisms against evil spirits, who continuously attempt to destroy the safety of man and bring Darkness and Chaos into the world. These conjurations were designed to threat away the demons, to avert their actions and to protect man from their attacks. Among them, we find a long and suggestive incantation against the seven malevolent demons called the Maskim. The formula was translated into English by R. Campbell Thompson and published in 1903 in the book, The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia. The Maskim were the Ensnarers, the layers of ambushes and the most wicked demons that surpassed all others in power and evil. On clay tablets, they are described as “ruthless spirits created in the vault of heaven,” but their nature seems dark and primal. This might suggest that they were originally demons of Primordial Chaos who, while bound within the new structures of the world, had power that was too great to withstand, allowing them to break free and wreak havoc across the land. Their descriptions resemble the nature and attributes of the Mighty Eleven from the Creation myth, and they were the most feared evil spirits in the Mesopotamian lore. Even though they are sometimes referred to as “the messengers of Anu,” the Sky God, manifesting as flash­es of lightning, they were believed to be the creatures of the Underworld, chthonic entities residing in the bowels of the earth. But, there are also accounts which state that the number of the Maskim was “twice seven” - “seven in heaven, seven on earth.” Therefore, they seemed to constitute two distinct groups of spirits, both destructive and terrifying. While the seven chthonic demons caused plagues and disasters on the earth (earthquakes, floods, etc.), the sky spirits manifested as raging storms, hurricanes, bolts30-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godsof lightning and destructive winds that brought “darkness in heaven” and “cast gloom over the bright day.”Like the primordial monsters of Tiamat, they were amorphous and com­plex, without shape or form, neither male, nor female. Described as destruc­tive storms and evil winds, they rushed like a flood over the earth. “From the four corners, the thrust of their advance burns like fire, they violently invade the dwellings of man, they lay bare the town as well as the country.” No door could shut them out, no bolt turned them back. They dashed along from house to house and glided through each door. They embodied the force of Chaos and opposed the natural course of nature. The first was “the South wind;” the second - “a dragon, whose mouth is opened... that none can mea­sure;” the third - “a grim leopard, which carries off the young;” the fourth- “a terrible Shibbu;” the fiffh-“a furious Wolf, who knoweth not to flee;” the sixth-“a rampant ... which marches against god and king;” and the seventh was “a storm, an evil wind, which takes vengeance.” As these descriptions match the attributes of the Mighty Eleven, they seem to be related to the original Children of Tiamat, or they can even be the primordial demons themselves, manifesting their powers in the new structures of the world.The accounts from the tablets depict the Maskim as messengers of Nam- tar and the throne-bearers of Ereshkigal, which points at their connection to the Underworld. Ereshkigal is the Queen of the Great Below, the goddess who rules the land of the dead, together with her consort Nergal. Namtar is her messenger and minister, one of the demons of the nether regions, the bringer of death. His name means “destiny” or “death.” He was believed to command sixty diseases in the form of demons that afflicted different parts of human body. Namtar was also the personification of the plague and together with Idpa, the fever, they were considered as two of the most formi­dable demons who afflicted mankind.According to the legend, the Maskim were born out of Anu, together with other main deities, and are equally ancient. They are alternately referred to as gods, demons and spirits. Their ally is the Imkhullu, “the evil wind,” and their main enemy is the God of Fire, together with other leading dei­ties: Enlil, Ea, and Ishtar. The Maskim were created “to wreak destruction.” In order to avoid it, the gods divided the whole heaven among the three of them: Sin, God of the Moon, Shamash, God of the Sun, and Ishtar, Mis­tress of Heavens, daughter to Sin and sister to Shamash. But the seven evil gods stormed the vault of heaven and brought onto their side Sin, Shamash31-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatand Adad, the God of Storms. They darkened the moon by an eclipse and brought thick clouds to cover the sun. Darkness fell upon the earth. Neither the moon nor the sun was shining. The gods were terrified and called for Marduk, the God of War, to fight the demons. Many fragments of the legend are missing, but what is left gives a powerful account of the nature of the seven demons who managed to threaten the whole Divine Order. They could ravage heaven and earth, interrupt the movement of the stars and darken the sun and the moon. The gods’ efforts to oppose them were futile. Even the powerful God of Fire was helpless in the face of their powers.Descriptions of the Maskim are highly evocative of the original eleven demons, as well. They are dragons and serpents, storms and raging winds, wolves and wild beasts dwelling in desolate places. The demon of the South wind, who is the first of the Maskim, is connected with the desert, the heat of the sun and the drought which brings death to humans and animals alike, causing diseases and destruction of crops. It is an extremely hot wind, burn­ing everything that it encounters on its way, like a black, demonic fire or a destructive tornado. In ancient Mesopotamia, winds and hurricanes were often regarded as demons, usually elemental ones. Sometimes, they were be­lieved to be messengers sent by gods to punish humans for their sins. The demon of the South wind assumes many forms or appears completely form­less: as a whirlpool of black dust. When he manifests, he comes as anthropo­morphic lizard-like figure with long hair and two pairs of wings; as a man with a demonic face and long fiery hair; or as a black shape wearing a mask on the face. He is the black wind of the desert, carving pictures and glyphs on the desert sand, blood-red in the light of the setting sun, marking the entrance to the Underworld. He emerges from dark pits of the earth and guides the wanderers into underground labyrinths, temples, and tunnels. There, the black fire burns so fiercely that one can hardly find any air to breathe and the heat burns the body and releases the spirit, transforming the Initiate into a living torch or a fire elemental. Similar destructive force is attributed to another of the Maskim demons: “a storm, an evil wind which takes vengeance.” This spirit reveals a close connection to violent forces of nature as well: storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy rains, thunder and lightning, i.e. all fierce phenomena which belong to the sphere of air. He appears to the conjuror in the form of a black winged figure or as an airy serpent with human head and horns. He may also manifest as a destructive power of nature: a violent wind that tears trees out of the ground, collapses32-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godsbuildings, and destroys everything on his way. He enters the Temple like a hurricane, lifting the soul beyond the Gates of the Night, raising storms and causing severe damage to the enemies. There is also a demon who personifies the very essence of Chaos and Disorder, a mysterious being who “marches against god and king,” spirit of rebellion against artificial structures estab­lished by humans and their gods. The demon himself is extremely chaotic and assumes hundreds of shapes. However, none of them is permanent and each form is continuously shifting into another. Sometimes, he resembles a tiger, a panther, a werewolf or he might simply consist of many animal parts, as if he embodied all beasts of prey at the same time. He is the beast rising from the Black Waters of Tiamat in order to tear the world apart, destroying the Divine Order and bringing the Current of Primal Chaos onto the earth. The spirit also has necromantic associations; he may manifest as a destruc­tive force of death that does not spare anyone - neither kings nor gods. As we learn from mythological accounts, in Mesopotamia, even gods could die, e.g. Gugal-Ana, the first husband of the goddess, Ereshkigal, died and later, she married her second consort, Nergal. Thus, the force of the demon is not only the principle of cosmic rebellion, but also death, which falls upon living beings, as well as human civilizations.The Maskim also include the demons in the form of dragons and ser­pents. One of them is the dragon “whose mouth is opened ... that none can measure.” The other is “a terrible Shibbu,” which, in Akkadian, means “serpent.” Dragon-like creatures in ancient Mesopotamia were not always viewed as demonic. In the Sumerian poetry, there is a term usumgal (a ser­pent monster), which does not have any pejorative meaning, but denotes a powerful god or a glorious king, and possibly refers to one of Tiamat s monsters, the entity named Usumgallu, who became associated with royal powers in the new structure of the world. In myths and legends, we encoun­ter many dragon and serpent creatures, e.g. the serpent-dragon (Mushussu), or the lion-dragon (Asag or Anzu). As we have already observed, Mushussu was a symbol of divine authority over the Primal Chaos represented by the Dragon, and he was associated with such gods as Marduk, Nabu, or Asur. But, then again, Asag and Anzu were vicious demons, bringing plagues and disasters upon mankind. The nature of the Maskim dragon-demon also seems ambiguous. He assumes forms and shapes connected to all elements. He can become a water serpent-dragon, like Leviathan, with his jaws as the waves of the ocean. But, he also manifests as a fiery dragon, with electric33-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatand fiery breath, casting lightning with his fearsome eyes. Furthermore, he can be wholly chthonic and appear as a part of the earth or the Underworld. His head is a huge mountain and his open jaws form an entrance to the cave with sharp stones and rocks resembling the teeth of a beast. His flesh is the earth itself with its underground caves, labyrinths and temples. His blood constitutes underground rivers, filled with water that looks like blood in the dim light of the Underworld. This form might be connected with Musmah- hu, another entity from the Mighty Eleven. And finally, the demon may also assume an airy form. In this shape, he appears as a huge cosmic dragon, encircling the whole universe, like Ouroboros serpent. His jaws are so vast that he could easily swallow the world. His body is the night sky and his scales are the stars shining bright on the firmament. All these shapes point at the universal nature of the Dragon, the primal force that contains all four elements within, binding them with the fifth one: the Spirit. The entity also seems to unite the powers and attributes of the dragon and serpent creatures from the original myth of Creation. The remaining powers are attributed to Shibbu, the demon depicted as a snake with a pair of horns. This depiction possibly refers to Basmu from the Tiamat legend, but it can also be applied to powers and attributes of other serpent creatures born in the Womb of Chaos. From magical perspective, this Maskim spirit resembles Mushussu, as they both tend to appear as shadowy, ghastly spectres, spitting out deadly venom. They coil around the Initiate and bite him, plunging their teeth into mortal flesh and infecting the soul with poisonous substance. And as the venom flows through the veins, the Initiates fall into hallucinogenic trance and through vapors of greenish smoke, they experience visions of serpents and vipers, serpent-people, underground temples with serpent statues, and endless tunnels, writhing and pulsating, as if they were alive. There, in the bowels of the earth, they meet dwellers of the Underworld - half-human half-serpents ruled by the Snake Goddess. They would invite the wanderers to immerse in the cauldron filled with green venom which induces further visions and hallucinations, through which the Initiate is transformed into serpent in order to glide between worlds, dimensions and angles. The mag­ical power of this Maskim demon is the art of bestial shape-shifting into the form of a serpent through the trance of hallucinatory intoxication with the venomous elixir vitae. The energy of the demon is also very vampiric in its nature and apart from self-initiatory purposes, it could be used in astral-34-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Eleven Demon-Godsvampirism where the victim would be poisoned and drained of his astral energy through the form of this shadowy wraith.Finally, there were also demons in the form of wild beasts, wolves, leop­ards, lions, etc. These entities are highly reminiscent of the eleven monsters of Tiamat, as well. One of such characters in the Mesopotamian lore is “a grim leopard which carries off the young,” also one of the Maskim group. This spirit embodies atavistic instincts of savage hunt. Leopard is an em­blem of the wild predator, shadow demon which hunts under the cloak of the night, searching for prey, and such is the influence of the demon on the consciousness of the Initiate. Human instincts are left behind and one ex­periences a drive of primal animal impulses, evoking visions of running through the woods and wilderness in search of prey, violent killing, the greedy devouring of the flesh and drinking of the blood, as if driven by a primal urge to satisfy the hunger. The leopard demon is the animal spirit worshipped by bloody cults in which people dressed in leopard skins and masks and dancing in a wild fashion around an altar with a freshly cap­tured prey, perform the act of ritual cannibalism. The practice of wearing animal skins is typical of many African tribes. In Nigeria, this custom is cultivated in funeral ceremonies, when the deceased are dressed in leopard skins. Similar practices were also used in funeral rites of ancient Egypt. In Mesopotamia, the custom of wearing animal skins was not unknown either. On ancient reliefs, we can often see people dressed in lion skins, embodying the powers of the animal. Bestial disguise was a symbolic acquirement of the animal skills, strength and agility. In magical practice, it replaces the art of shape-shifting on the mundane level. It induces a particular kind of trance which allows for moving onto the astral level and for a complete transforma­tion into a beast - a manifestation of one’s hidden instincts and lusts. In this case, it is the manifestation of atavistic predatory instincts, which become awakened by absorption of this dark energy. But, there is also another entity among the Maskim who embodies the concept of a spiritual predator. It is “a furious wolf who knoweth not to flee.” This being has a close connection to the concept of lycanthropy, shamanism, nagualism and totem animals. The demon appears as a huge wolf or an anthropomorphic werewolf, with sharp teeth and hard claws, which might have been inspired by the picture of Uridimmu, the entity from the Tiamat myth, who manifests in lupine or canine shapes on occasion. He haunts his prey, eats the flesh of his victims and drinks their fresh, warm blood. In rites of invocation, he also reveals to-35"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatthe Initiate the secret of transformation, under the light of the full moon, in severe pain which tears apart the mundane flesh and releases the soul - the bestial/animal element inherent in human DNA. This concept of bestial soul is rooted in shamanic beliefs in totem animals, guardian spirits and guides through spiritual realms. In various parts of the world, it was known as the nagual, or thefylgia, and in witchcraft, as the familiar spirit of a witch. Like the leopard demon, this Maskim spirit represents the art of therianthropy, which has a long tradition worldwide in many cultures and their mytholo­gies and especially in magical customs. To transform oneself into a desired animal, practitioners of these ancient rites dressed themselves in animal skins, rubbed their bodies with magic ointments, drank water out of ani­mal’s footprints, or used a wide range of magical spells and incantations. It was believed that by these practices one may acquire skills and qualities of the animal. When the transformation and mental identification was com­plete, man was believed to become a savage and cruel animal - a werewolf in which all human instincts were replaced by bestial. In the form of a beast of prey, the Initiate roamed across woods and wilderness, killing men and animals encountered on his way in order to satisfy his primal hunger lust for ultimate freedom from all constraints of mundane reality. This flight of the soul in unrestrained liberation from the flesh is the essence of the Mighty Eleven. It is the ascent to the Gates of Flesh and beyond, through the Gates of the Night into the Womb of the Dragon, when the soul is dissolved, re­born and fortified by the primal Draconian force of the First Mother.-36"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Children Of Tiamat"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Methods of Workefore starting the Work with the spirits presented in this grimoire, it is necessary to get familiar with the basic tools and methods needed for the rituals. Techniques described here are specific for this Gnosis, but they can also be used in other magical workings. Draco­nian magic is personal, dynamic, versatile, elevating individual experience over fixed structures and established traditions. It is its nature to challenge, question, destroy and create anew. Methods of Work presented in this book are but a one way to work with this Gnosis, and in fact, there are as many approaches as there are practitioners. This is how the Current remains alive and the primal essence of the Dragon is ever present in the world and within human consciousness, the microcosmic reflection of the Universe. There­fore, the Gnosis that was revealed during the Work with Tiamat and her Children should spread and flourish among those who seek the knowledge and power of the primal Draconian gods. In the present Aeon of Re-Awak­ening, when the Dragon arises from the Abyss of Oblivion, man should not be afraid to claim the ancient potential and to rise to the stars as well.InvocationsIn rites of invocation, the essence of the spirits is summoned into the Tem­ple of Flesh. It rises from within in consuming waves of energy, which feels ecstatic and overwhelming. Natural defenses are crushed and annihilated by the dissolving nature of these primal entities. The ego is dissolved and what remains is the raw ecstasy of the soul which is taken beyond the gates of flesh, decomposed and reborn in the Womb of Tiamat, from which it rises purified and empowered by the Black Fire of the Dragon Goddess.

Their tendrils will pierce your body from within, like bolts of lightning, penetrating spiritual centers and inflaming them with Draconian energy. The possession is often painful and sexual, the bitter-sweet mixture of agony and pleasure.In order to experience the communion of energies in its totality, you have to offer yourself as the temple, the altar and the vessel for the essence of the demon-gods. For this purpose, you may use certain ego-dissolving tech­niques. However, it is recommended to employ only these practices which heighten the senses and open them for the absorption of energies, such as sexual ecstasy. Sexual energies are an excellent vehicle for the essence of Draconian entities which are ever hungry for spiritual substance. All sorts of sexual techniques, from basic auto-erotic practices to advanced sado-mas­ochistic rites, will provide suitable conditions for the shift of consciousness which will take the soul to the boundaries of exhaustion and beyond, into the Womb of the Dragon. Blood is a perfect medium, as well, for the force of the Dragon is contained within the vital-essence and it is the key to the gates of the soul. Bloodletting, however, depletes the organism and it is rec­ommended to use only as much life-substance, as it is absolutely necessary to open the inner and the outer gateways and to provide a channel for the entities to manifest. You should also avoid mind-altering substances, such as alcohol, drugs, hallucinogens, etc. While these methods prove useful in a wide spectrum of magical workings, in this specific type of Gnosis, they will only numb your consciousness and limit the experience. The primal, transformative essence of Draconian gods is enough in itself to take the soul beyond the body and to elevate it in pure ecstasy of possession.Both in rites of invocation and evocation, the key to the gates of flesh and soul is the blood of the practitioner, the primal substance of the Dragon, the legacy of the Demon-God Kingu. It is the very essence of the Gnosis and the foremost tool of sorcery and spiritual alchemy. Rites of invocation are opened with blood placed on the ritual blade and used to activate the seals. With the blooded ritual blade, you open the Gates of the Night by tracing the glyph of the Key to draw the Current of the Dragon into the Temple. Blood is also required by the gods to manifest, both within and without. Spirits are called by chanting their names and focusing the mind on their seals which should also be drawn or traced with blood. You may wish to prepare the seals prior to the workings, with the blood mixed with paint or ink, but it is strongly recommended that you also trace the lines of the glyphs with blood-40*"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Methods of Workduring the ritual itself. Vital substance is more powerful when imbued with the Essence of Tiamat, the primal Draconian spark which is awakened and ignited in the preliminary invocation of the Dragon.The gates of flesh, once open, cannot be closed again. The invoked en­ergies will transform you from within, rebuilding and restructuring your spiritual centers, forever merging with your soul. When you open yourself to the primal Current of the Dragon, it will flow into your life, changing it from the very foundations. Energies summoned in rites of invocation can be used for protection and empowerment as well as for destruction and male­diction. The powers of gods and spirits manifesting from within are yours to commands and can be directed upon a target. You may choose to use them for self-initiatory purposes, such as to fortify your spiritual body, build pro­tective shields around yourself, open your inner eyes and strengthen your inner vision or transform your consciousness through the alchemy of the soul. But, these energies can also be channeled and directed upon another person, either for protective purposes or in works of hostile sorcery. The Children of Tiamat are very powerful carriers of death energies, ill-wishing and harmful magic. They are bringers of misfortune, weakness and disease. And they are also ruthless vampires, feeding on the life-force of the target, draining it until there is nothing left and the body becomes but an emp­ty shell. However, they are also very chaotic and amorphous, which makes them difficult to focus and control. Effects of destructive magic delivered by these entities manifest upon the victim and in the immediate surroundings. In other words, they will hit not only the target but also every living being around. If you are not powerful enough to control and direct this force, they may easily strike you as well. Another thing that has to be taken into con­sideration is that these energies strongly affect your consciousness and your perception of the world. They are seductive and they incite the desire and enjoyment of all that is abhorred, disgusting and forbidden. What seems re­pulsive, becomes exciting, and in rites of possession, when your soul merges with their corrupting essence, you become perfectly capable of things you would normally never do in your mundane life. Human consciousness is left aside and you become the primal being yourself. This is an experience that can easily drive a weak mind to madness and obsessions. This Gnosis is not for everyone. It is not for dabblers, disbelievers, pretenders, the feeble-mind­ed, the petty, or the faint-hearted. It is for those who seek genuine power, elevation and evolution of the soul.-41-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of TiamatEvocationsIn works of evocation the spirits are called to manifest in visible form through a chosen medium, within the area that serves as a focal point for the energies. In these specific rites, the medium is the smoke of the incense and the area of manifestation is the mirror. The essence of the Children of Tiamat, however, is too vast to be enclosed within any particular space, and it is more likely that you will observe their manifestations in the whole rit­ual room. They can make their initial appearance in the mirror and then assume a visible shape from the thick incense smoke, or they can simply flow through the mirror gateway and manifest above the altar or in any oth­er place in the Temple. But, they rarely stay within the gate itself until the end of the ritual. Protective circles are useless. There are no boundaries that would withhold these powerful entities. The only protection against their overwhelming essence and possible harm is the Draconian Fire, which is ignited by the Invocation of the Dragon and which burns within the soul of the conjuror. It is strongly advised to open all magical operations described in this book with the invocation of Dragon’s power and to work in posses­sion with this primal force itself. The Invocation of Dragon can be replaced by the invocation of Tiamat and merging with her boundless essence, or by the invocation of Kingu, who is the lord and commander of all primal be­ings and stands above the Mighty Eleven.The primal demon-gods are amorphous in their nature and they can assume any shape or form. Sometimes they come as a shapeless mass of ten­tacles, heads and eyes, and have to be specifically asked to appear in a form suitable for communication and more pleasing to human senses. They also need a great amount of energy to manifest. For this reason, an offering of either blood or sexual fluids is necessary, and often it is the combination of both. It is natural to feel drained and exhausted, to smaller or larger extent, after the ritual of evocation, and the only way to avoid it is to offer a sacrifice of a living being. This is a controversial practice, which is shunned by many practitioners and it is left to individual choice whether to include it in the Work or not. The sacrifice is not essential for the demon-gods to manifest and convey their Gnosis, but a few of them may openly ask for an offering of life, large quantities of blood or specific bodily organs to be given to them in order to continue the Work. You have to be aware of this before you call these entities to come and do your bidding.-42-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Methods of WorkCommunication with the demon-gods occurs within the inner mind, though a few of them may also wish to speak to you by verbal means or con­vey their messages through sigils, glyphs and visual imagery. They also often come with tangible physical phenomena, sounds, scents and tastes. The tem­perature in the Temple changes and the air becomes electrified. They reveal the secrets of the Nightside and can be asked to serve as guides on the jour­neys beyond the Gates of the Night. They teach the art of astral shape-shift­ing and show how to fortify the spiritual body and build powerful defenses. They can also deliver a curse, disease or an attack upon a chosen target. Characteristics of the spirits provided in this grimoire include descriptions of their powers and records of their practical application in self-initiatory alchemy and in the works of malediction.The formula of calling includes activating the seals with blood, sum­moning the spirits by chanting their names, providing the substance for manifestation by offering sexual fluids or life energies, reciting the words of a spoken conjuration, scrying for visions of the entities through the mir­ror and communicating with them about the intent of the rite. The spirits may ask for additional sacrifices or offerings before they bestow on you their gifts. This has to be done in order to continue the operation. After the ritual, you should thank the spirits for coming and dismiss them in the name of the Dragon.DreamworkThe eternal Waters of Tiamat can also be accessed through the doors of sleep. Dreams are manifestations of the unconscious and in dreaming state, we can travel through the Gates of the Night and explore forgotten realms which lie beyond the world of waking.

With the proper practice and systematic training, howev­er, the realm of Dreamlands becomes accessible to any devoted practitioner.This grimoire provides a simple method of travelling through the door of sleep, which can be applied to all eleven demon-gods, and which only requires basic skills of meditation, affirmation, and visualization. However, if you have enough skill and prior practice in shaping your dreams, it will be easier for you to embark on these journeys and to profit from them.Before going to sleep, prepare the seal of the chosen spirit, empower it with your own blood if you wish, and focus on it for a while, chanting the-43-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatname of the demon at the same time.

Place the sigil below the pillow and lie down, visualizing a door with the seal inscribed upon its surface. As the seal comes alive, let the door of sleep open for you to walk through. In descriptions of the demon-gods, you will find suitable visual meditations which you can use to induce dreams inspired by the chosen spirit. If you are an advanced dream traveler, you may wish to call the spirit and simply let it take you on the journey, without following the suggested meditation. In either case, keep your mind focused on the intent to continue the vision in a dream and explore the forgotten realms behind the Gates of the Night.The Gates of the NightThe Current of the Dragon Goddess Tiamat can be accessed through the gateways to the Nightside which are hidden from the eyes of the profane, but can be opened by those who seek this primal Gnosis. These gates ap­pear when you invoke the Dragon energy into the Temple of Flesh. As the Draconian force of the Kundalini Serpent rises from the base of your spine, ascending through the spinal column and activating spiritual centers, The Eye of the Dragon opens within your inner mind and the illusions of per­ception are shattered. Then, with your inner eyes, you can see cracks in the surrounding reality, black holes, strangely-looking doors and windows or spots that shine with energy. These portals are the Gates of the Night which connect the Nightside realm with your inner mind. When they are opened, you can travel through these gateways, in between worlds and dimensions, floating with the primal Draconian Current, into the Heart of Darkness, the Womb of Tiamat, the primordial source of ail life and all manifestation. In the same way the Current flows through the Gates of the Night into the Tem­ple, the ritual space in which the operation is conducted. This flow of Dra­conian energies empowers the Temple, fortifies its protections, and provides the energy for the entities of the Nightside to arise and take form on the physical plane.

In the blackness of the Void, which is the Womb of the Dragon Goddess, it shines as a torch, ignited by the inner fire of the soul who travels through the gates of flesh. It is the source of light and the guiding flame on the Path of the Dragon. The eye in the glyph rep­resents the Eye of the Dragon that sees through veils and illusions. The tri­dent is symbolic of the origin of the Current and the primal gods who were created by the First Dragon of the Void.The Key of the Night is drawn whenever you need to open the outer or the inner gateways. It should be used both in rites of invocation and when you evoke the spirits into visible manifestation. It also opens the gates to Dreamlands and lifts the Veil of the Night as you leave the world of waking.

After the ritual it should be covered with black cloth and placed away.-46-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Methods of WorkTools of the WorkThe ritual blade is needed in most of the rites and you can either use the blade you normally employ in your workings or you may wish to obtain a new one and consecrate it specifically for this Work. This can be a dagger, a sword or any sort of a knife. However, it has to be sharp enough to cut the flesh and to draw blood needed for the rites. For this reason, a simple hunting knife would make a better ritual tool than a fancy athame, which is usually designed solely for decorative, not practical, purposes. You may also use a razor or a needle for ritual bloodletting, but this is all a matter of personal choice. Remember, however, that a blade used to spill blood and to take life is a far better medium to draw the energies from behind the Gates of the Night than a decorative dagger, no matter how fancy and beautiful it is.In all rituals, you will need seals of spirits and gods. Sometimes they only serve as a focal point for directing the energy. In other workings, they have to be burnt. You should always use the primary sigils of the demon-gods, but the additional sigils and glyphs may work as gateways to their power, as well. The manner of preparation is left to individual choice. For practi­cal reasons, those seals, which are burnt at the height of the ritual, can be simple drawings in black ink on white paper. Black and white sigils are also good for meditative purposes. However, if you prefer to work with the seals in a more fancy form, it is recommended to use only black, red and golden colors. Golden seals on black background or black glyphs on red parchment will work best in these rites. You can also paint them on wood if you prefer a more solid material than paper, but this is not necessary. Finally, all seals and sigils can also be drawn with blood or with an ink mixed with the vi­tal-substance, but then again, it is better to use blood in the ritual itself, to trace the lines of a sigil prepared prior to the working.All rituals described in this grimoire also require incense, candles and a container to hold the charcoal and to burn the parchments with the sigils. It is recommended to use natural resin incense, burnt on charcoal, or herbal blends which give a great deal of smoke. Thick smoke is an excellent medium for the spirits to manifest and to form into visible shape. Dragon’s Blood is specifically associated with Draconian magic but other types of incense with a strong, intense scent will serve purpose as well. Candles should be either red or black, or both.

The mirror represents the Gates of the Night on the physical plane. It can be opened and activated by the Key of the Night and it can be a powerful vessel for the spirits to manifest in visible form. Mir­rors specifically recommended for this Work are simple black mirrors, with smooth, non-reflective surface, large enough to comfortably focus on them in the ritual. The size and the shape of the scrying mirror is always a matter of individual preferences and so it is left to practitioners’ choice. In case of a few spirits from this grimoire, however, you will need a black watery mirror. A simple black vessel filled with any black liquid, ink, water dyed black, etc. will be fine for the Work. It should also be large enough to provide a suit­able gateway and a point of focus, and it should be consecrated specifically for this Work and not used for any other purpose. All Children of Tiamat are connected with her black ocean and can be called through watery ves­sels, but some of them prefer the medium of water above other substances of manifestation. It is specified in descriptions of particular spirits whether they should be called into a simple black mirror or through a watery sur­face. It is strongly advised to read these descriptions carefully before starting preparations for the ritual.-48-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Opening Ritualf you are an advanced practitioner, you may choose to skip the verbal invocation and simply focus on Draconian energies rising within, or you can replace the incantations provided in this gri- moire with your personal words, flowing spontaneously from your inner mind in the course of the ritual.

In historical sources, this entity is most often depicted as a seven-headed snake or dragon and identified with the constellation of Hydra. For this reason, Musmahhu is also associated with the god, Ningishzida, one of the titles of whom was “The Great Serpent-Dragon” and who was frequently depicted as a horned, winged serpent-dragon, walking on all four legs.Within works of magic, Musmahhu assumes several forms, all display­ing characteristic features of the spirit’s ophidian nature. The demon appears as a blind, horned serpent, holding the eye in its jaws, or as one-eyed serpent with the eye in the center of the forehead or as a snake with a skull and spi­ral horns instead of the head. The eye burns or glows red or yellow and is connected with the powers of the third eye and the inner vision. Sometimes, the eye looks like a diamond and is shaped like a jewel. The diamond may shine with the fiery energy of the spirit but in its essence it is black, reflecting the absolute blackness of the Void where the demon was born in the Womb-59-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatof Tiamat. In a similar way, the practitioner invoking Musmahhu may have visions of glyphs of an eye shaped like a diamond. It is the All-Seeing Eye that was born in the Void from primal sparks of creation. Communion with the spirit is often accompanied by pulsating sensation in the third eye which expands and transcends sensory boundaries of perception.Musmahhu is an entity of feminine nature and in rites of evocation she often appears in woman’s form with the lower part of the body in the shape of a snake. She holds the power of astral poisoning; her venom might be deadly, but it can also be used for magical protection and immunity. When invoked, she enters the mind and endows the practitioner with the skill of astral shape-shifting. At one time, the practitioner might become a snake, rising up to the heights of the cosmic space. At the other, he might become a spider climbing the Tree of Knowledge and in another, a butterfly drinking the juices from the blooming flowers of the Tree. The astral form of the prac­titioner becomes fiery and so is the spirit’s energy. The concept of the tree or garden is recurrent in the visions obtained during the work with Musmah­hu, as well as dark portals or tunnels in the earth which seem to be gateways into the astral worlds where the practitioner can meet the serpent-goddess. She resides in wild landscapes, forgotten forests and hidden caves. Her hiss­ing voice guides the practitioner through black woods to abandoned ritual places. Her jaws are the caverns of the earth, her teeth are the sharp rocks and her gullet is the underground tunnel. Hence, the possible correspon­dence on the Tree of Night would be the Lilith qlipha, the lowest qlipothic level, which functions as the gate and portal to the Other Side.In rituals of evocation, her arrival is heralded by the sigil which appears in the air, glowing with fire or dripping blood. The Temple is filled with clouds of smoke which form into the shape of serpents or a seven-headed hydra. She opens her jaws and reveals the eye which shines like a torch. She incites dreams about shape-shifting, flying and gliding through dimensions in an astral form of a snake. When invoked, she coils around practitioners and devours them in ecstasy of inner illumination, taking them beyond boundaries of flesh. Her mystery is the art of seeing with the Inner Eyes. Her blindness represents limitations of bodily senses. She ignites the primordial spark which rests in the third eye of the practitioner, awakening those senses which exist beyond the veil of human perception.60"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MusmahhuThe Eye of the Blind SerpentEvocationTrace the lines of the sigil with your blood chanting the name of the demon.

Vapors of green phosphorous mist cloak the practitioner in poisonous cocoon which is dense and suffocating. In a more tangible form, you can see her as a blind serpent, in brown and green colors, shifting into half-woman, half-snake. She also appears as a naked woman with a snake coiled around her body. She has dark skin, heavy eye make­up and straight hair in Egyptian manner. She coils around the practitioner, activating the third eye and teaching the art of astral seeing.

You are standing on a narrow path leading somewhere deep into the woods. From the distance, you can hear the hissing of a serpent, inviting you to come closer and guiding you through the dark forest paths. While walking, you notice that the hissing becomes louder and clearer and chang­es into a voice which you can understand in a mysterious way. It speaks to you and guides you further. After a while, the forest ends and you face a huge serpent with spiral horns resembling the horns of a ram. The serpent is blind, her eyeholes are empty and one fiery eye burns in the centre of her forehead. Welcome her with the words, “Ho Drakon Ho Megas.” At this moment, the serpent will transform and become a part of the landscape. Her huge jaws are now the entrance to the cave. When you step inside, the entrance closes behind you, like the mouth of a beast, and you feel as if you were in a gullet of a snake. In front of you, there is a long tunnel at the end of which you can see fiery light. While walking through the tunnel, you notice many snakes writhing on the ground and the air is getting more and more electrified. With each step, the tunnel becomes narrower and smaller and soon, you have to crawl to fit in. At the same time, it becomes alive and you are changing, too. Your human limbs disappear and you shape-shift into a serpent, slithering down into another dimension. When you finally reach the end of the tunnel and crawl onto the other side in your serpent form, you find yourself in a completely new place. Look around and explore the land­scape.

It was associated with various gods and mythological char­acters, first with Ninazu and Tispak, then with Ningishzida. It is also often identified as the symbolic animal of Marduk. It has not been connected with any astrological constellation, though. Its early depictions show the creature as a dragon with a lion’s head and without talons. Later, the lion parts would be progressively replaced by snake parts. In mythology, Musussu originally served the god Ninazu, the king of snakes, and was perhaps a sort of a death messenger, killing with its venom. It is often referred to as “fearless killer” and a very deadly entity.Within the rites of magic, Musussu appears to the practitioner as a vam- piric entity manifesting in female human form, connected with necromancy and death principle, feeding on blood and sexual energies. She usually comes as a black bat-like dragon or a winged serpent. She endows the practitioner-67-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatwith the ability to transform the astral body of shadow and to fly through the astral plane as a wraith, a winged vampiric entity who can suck the life- force of a sleeping person. These characteristics resemble the nature of a succubus or an incubus, vampiric demons residing on the dark side of the moon, the qlipothic sphere of Gamaliel, hence, the possible connection to this qlipha. In dreams and visions, she sometimes appears accompanied by creatures of the Sabbat, devils, horned demons, and creatures of the night, inspiring images of orgiastic celebrations and bloody sacrifices. An essential offering to Musussu are sexual fluids and blood - substances rich with per­sonal life-force.Musussu comes with wraiths and black shadows emerging from the mirror, casting flickering reflections upon the wall. She is the Black Serpent, arising from winding labyrinths of caves and tunnels beneath the earth, but she is also the black-faced bringer of death. Her upper part of the body is shaped like a human, but does not look human. She has black-scaled skin with a pale shade of blue, her mouth drips with blood, her tongue is protrud­ed and her face is distorted by a grimace of hunger. Her teeth are very thin and sharp and shift into fangs when she transforms into a serpent. She is evoked in sexual ecstasy at cemeteries and burial places, among tombstones, in mausoleums and catacombs, where her manifestations are empowered by the essence of death and sex. She presides over the works of necrophilia and incites eroto-necromantic dreams. You can also meet her in a skeletal form of a wraith, dressed in black hooded robe, holding a large black mirror in her ebony fingers. In this form, she holds dominion over the dead and brings the deceased back from the underworld to manifest through the mirror. By writing the name of a dead person on a parchment with your own blood, you can summon any discarnate soul into the mirror, regardless whether they are willing to come or not.Invocation of Musussu is also experienced as a bitter-sweet union of life and death energies, the Eros and the Thanatos. The serpent comes to bite the practitioner, coiling around to awaken and raise the primal ophidian force, which feels erotic and ecstatic. The body is put into comatose trance and the mind is filled with hunger for life-essence of others. Blood seems as sweet as nectar, it is intoxicating and addictive. The spirit can therefore be used in practices of vampirism and necromancy, works of lunar magic, or astral warfare.

In works of malefica, Musussu attacks through the heart, feasting on the warm core and drinking the blood while it is still beating. Her powers can be used in rites of personal empowerment, as well as in hostile sorcery.EvocationThe ritual begins with tracing the lines of the sigil with your own blood while chanting the name of the demon in a low whispering voice. When this is done, place a few drops of blood on the ritual blade and draw the Key of the Night in the air above the mirror which serves as a focal point for the force to manifest.

When this is finished, thank the demon and close the working with the words:In the name of the Dragon,This is my Will and so it shall be!Musussu comes willingly, but manifests in a rather ephemeral, evanes­cent form. It is recommended to conjure her through the medium of smoke and the atmosphere in the temple should be thick with incense, mild resin incense burnt upon charcoal works best. In her ophidian form, she appears as a serpent with bat wings, accompanied by wraiths and shadows. Her eyes are hypnotic and she moves in sensuous, mesmerizing rhythm, putting the practitioner into intoxicating trance. She also comes as half-woman, half- snake, manifesting in clouds of smoke, and tongues of black flame, wild and hissing.

Like other serpent-spirits, she holds the keys to the gnosis of shape-shifting and gliding between worlds and dimensions. She is aggres­sive and bloodthirsty, but also seductive and mesmerizing. Within rites of malediction, she teaches how to kill and removes moral restraints and hesi­tation to take life or inflict pain. She arouses hunger for blood, life-essence, and incites thoughts of murder, as well as lust and sexual urges. If you wish to use her energy in works of malefica, invoke her powers and envision your­self in the form of a black snake coiling around your victim, inducing hyp­notizing trance in which the victim is powerless and unable to fight back.

After a short while, the whole temple is filled with water and the statue of the snake from the fountain becomes alive, it turns into a living black serpent. The water is crystal clear and electrified. It is very cold. The serpent coils around you and bites you again and again until there is not a single spot on your body that would not bleed. Your life warmth is leaving you with each bite and finally the serpent bites you in your third eye. You float from your flesh and watch how it crumbles to pieces like a statue made of ice. The serpent is nowhere to be seen and you realize that you are the serpent now. You can glide smoothly between worlds and dimensions. It feels ecstatic and sexual, also very powerful and invigorating. Enjoy this sensation and let the vision flow freely or explore this power and use it in your further work.Dream WorkProvided below are two meditations that will open your inner mind for the essence of Musussu and induce dreams inspired by the spirit. Before going to sleep, gaze into the sigil of the demon, chanting the name in hissing whis­per. The primary sigil is recommended for both workings. When you feel the presence of the spirit, trace The Key of the Night in front of you and speak the words of dream invocation:In the name ofTiamat,I stir the Black Waters of the Abyss,And I lift the Veil of the NightTo gaze into mysteries which lie beyond the world of Waking.In the name of the Mother,I call Musussu to be my guide and companion through dreams and nightmares.By the Key of the Night I open the Gateways to Dreamlands,And I seek to rest in the Arms of the Dragon,In a dream which will take me beyond the Veil of Shadow,To forgotten temples and ritual places,Where I shall join forbidden rites and face the Darkness within.So it shall be!Place the sigil below the pillow.

Focus for a while on either of the fol­lowing visualizations and let yourself fall asleep with the mind focused on the intent of continuing the vision in a dream.Sabbatic NecromancyWhen you walk through the door, envision yourself in an old cemetery at night. It is a beautiful, gothic graveyard with statues and ornamented tomb­stones, stone crypts and mausoleums. It seems forgotten and abandoned, though. The buildings and monuments start to crumble, dust and cobwebs cover the stone, and the whole cemetery is cloaked with thick white fog. Suddenly, you can hear singing coming from the distance and you notice a procession of phantoms emerging from the fog. They look like monks in long robes going to a mass, holding candles which glow with a cold spec­tral light. The procession walks towards a big, black mausoleum. You follow them and enter the building. The mass is conducted by a naked priest wear­ing a goat mask which covers his face. On his chest, he has a large tattoo of a black winged snake. A naked woman is lying on the altar, as if in a vision of a traditional Black Mass. But all participants are ghosts. At the climax of the ceremony, the priest thrusts the dagger into the victims chest, fills the chal­ice with blood and passes the sacrament around. You drink it with the other participants and you can feel how the elixir transforms your consciousness - you are excited and aroused, it feels like being possessed by the spirit. The priest looks at you and invites you to join the communion: all participants disrobe and a ghastly orgy begins. There are only ghosts, skeletons, zombies and rotting corpses. Join them and let the vision flow in a natural way while you’re falling asleep.Black LakeVisualize yourself in a dark forest, standing on the shore of a small, pitch black lake. It is nighttime and in the sky above you can see the full moon, but it is very dark, as if in an eclipse, or as if you were looking at its dark side which does not reflect the light of the sun. Summon the demon by whis­pering or shouting her name into the darkness of the night. After a while, you will see a creature emerging from the lake. She is partially human, but her face is pale and demonic. Her eyes are glowing red and her mouth drips blood. She is dressed in black, windy robes. The demon walks towards you, looking straight into your eyes. Her gaze is piercing and painful and you can74"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Musussufeel that your flesh is transforming.

You do the same and when you enter the water, you feel that it is not ordinary water but a mirror and a portal to the astral plane.

One of them was called the “Venomous Snake” or usum/ basmu, which is sometimes interpreted as nothing else than a mythologized form of a natural enemy of man. The other was called the “Birth Goddess Snake” or mus-sa-tiir/ basmu and was a horned type of snake. Basmu is usu­ally described as a horned snake, either with forelegs or without any limbs. It might be a rearing cobra with horns and in Akkadian, the word basmu was used to denote the Egyptian Uraeus. But, there are also theories that it was a horned serpent with two front legs and wings. Its name is sometimes un­derstood as the “horned serpent with a womb” and it is regarded as an early name for the constellation known later as the Serpent. After Marduk’s defeat of Tiamat, Basmu became one of the symbolic animals of the god Ningishzi- da, the chthonic deity residing in the Underworld, and was considered a pro­tective entity. Ningishzida is sometimes depicted in human form, with two-77-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamathorned serpents arising from his shoulders. The image of the creature might have been derived from a horned viper called Cerastes, a desert-dwelling animal, which has horn-like protrusions over the eyes.Within the works of magic, Ваши usually comes as a flying serpent, brown or golden, with small curved horns and small forelegs, sometimes winged, sometimes without wings, but always soaring high in the air. He rises from lakes, ponds and vessels filled with ink-black water, often man­ifesting in a ring of fire. He seems to be a mediator between the principles of fire and water. His own essence is fiery, too, and in rites of evocation, he appears with wings of fire, surrounded by flames. A slight stench of sulphur can be scented in the air and tongues of red fire emblaze the Temple with the demon’s essence. When the practitioner invokes the spirit into flesh, the as­tral form changes and flashes with fiery and golden colors and two serpents arise from the shoulders, entwining around the head and expanding con­sciousness. This perhaps confirms the connection to the Egyptian Uraeus as the crown encircling the head.Ваши inspires apocalyptic visions and dreams of earthquakes and disasters, heralding the end of a cosmic cycle, when the whole universe is sucked into a black hole in the centre of the Void, and the beginning of a new aeon, when the world is reborn in the Womb of Chaos. This is the pri­mordial cosmic order: the universe before the birth of life, with the black sun hanging low above the horizon and dripping the nourishing blood over the whole creation. This might perhaps connect the spirit with the Black Sun of Thagirion, the central qlipha on the Tree of Night, but this is a rather loose association. He appears as a fiery serpent and rises up into the cosmic space, devours the sun, the stars and the planets and then, vomits them back in streams of blood, forming a new cosmos in the eternal cycle of renewal.He endows the practitioner with the ability to use magical fire which is highly venomous and destructive, and teaches how to expand consciousness beyond limitations of flesh. His energy is violent and aggressive and may be used both for protective and destructive purposes. The practitioner can use his essence to empower the flesh by transforming blood into liquid fire and strengthen the aura with impenetrable flames, but the same energy can also be employed in works of malediction to poison the blood of a target and to plague the victim with burning pain. Enflamed with the spirit’s essence, the practitioner can shape-shift into a fiery serpent, fly on the wings of flame, breathe fire and burn all that stands in the way.-78-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"BasmuEvocationOpen the ritual with tracing the lines of the sigil with your own blood while chanting the name of the demon.

At the conjuror’s request, he may also assume a human form, with alien pale skin, big head, large eyes and curved horns. Some­times, he has a horned skull instead of a head and looks very ghastly, like a phantom. Basmu holds dominion over venomous fire that burns the world of matter and annihilates boundaries and limitations of flesh. Within rites of malediction, his energies may be used both for personal protection and for magical attack. His venomous essence is an excellent tool for empower­ing ritual objects employed in death magic: daggers, pins, blades, or razors, which are used to stab or cut the victim, may be saturated with Basmu’s poi­sonous fire in order to inflict more pain. Sympathetic objects such as pup­pets or photographs may be burnt in ritual fire empowered by the demon’s energies through the rites of evocation.

In historical sources, this spirit is sometimes mis­taken for Basmu and its attributes are uncertain. The word usumgallu is a derivative from usum and it literally means “Prime Venomous Snake.” Its foremost quality is being a determined killer, killing probably with its ven­om, and frightening even the gods. Also usum (gal) was used as an epithet for certain gods and kings.In magical work, Usumgallu usually appears in the form of a golden dragon or a winged golden serpent. It endows the practitioner with the abil­ity to use golden magical fire: either to purify and protect or to destroy. The fire is attached to the palms of the hands and the practitioner can stretch them through the astral plane and touch the subtle body of a target - in order to purify the person’s energy, e.g. for healing, or to use it for destruc­tive purposes - to burn the life-force of a victim. When invoked, the spirit enters the body and mind from within, causing the aura to glow with golden-85-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatradiance and the astral form assumes the shape of a golden dragon. The practitioner can use a mask of a dragon, painted gold, to attract the spirit into the temple of flesh. Emblazed by the spirit’s essence in a trance of pos­session, the mask grows into flesh and the whole body is transformed into dragon-form, which is a very powerful and tangible manifestation.Within rites of evocation, the demon appears as a royal cobra, dancing, writhing, and hypnotizing the practitioner with his movement and mesmer­izing, red-glowing eyes. He bites the third eye and merges with the personal essence, the core of existence, which feels like a very intense activation of this spiritual center, sometimes accompanied by intense pain and visions of bleeding from the third eye. The cobra may also split into two smaller snakes which enter the flesh of the practitioner through the forehead. One of these snakes is silver, the other golden, which brings into mind associations with the Ida and the Pingala, two aspects of the ophidian energy of Kundalini. This also connects Usumgallu with the Egyptian Uraeus and with Basmu, the other serpent god who sometimes manifests as two snakes entwined around the head and expanding consciousness beyond boundaries of per­ception. In ancient Egypt, the Uraeus was the symbol for the goddess Wad- jet, one of the earliest Egyptian deities, who was often depicted as a rearing cobra. Her depiction was incorporated into a headwear, a type of a crown encircling the head, worn by the pharaoh as a symbol of divine authority. The royal cobra with a crown on its head is one of the most frequent man­ifestations of Usumgallu. The spirit also inspires visions of ancient temples with ornaments depicting cobras, Egyptian drawings and hieroglyphs on walls and columns, and with golden altars and ritual tools. The image of the cobra, splitting into two serpents and coiling around the head, may also be successfully used in invocation and visual meditations.EvocationThe ritual starts with tracing the lines of the sigil with the practitioner’s blood, while the name of the demon is being chanted in low, vibrating voice.

He comes as a golden cobra, with scales of gold and with ornaments in Egyptian manner. He has a jewel at the end of the tail and he wears a golden crown on the head. His dragon-form is more often encountered within the works of invocation. The cobra moves around the practitioner in mesmerizing serpentine rhythm, inducing a hypnotic trance. Usumgallu strikes fast and his venom is dead­ly. In works of self-empowerment, it fills the aura of the practitioner with golden radiance which serves as a protective shield against magical attacks and returns baneful energy to the sender. His essence is golden and fiery, but the fire possesses a melting and dissolving nature rather than scorching and burning. He bites the victim in the third eye, distorts the vision and poisons the mind.

On the altar, there is a golden chalice, a dagger and a golden mask of a dragon. Cut your hand and let the blood pour into the chalice. Then, put on the mask, call the demon and drink the sacrament from the chalice.

His name means “the hairy one” and he is sometimes identified with the Babylonian hero or a protective deity associated with such gods as Enki or Marduk. The word lahama was used to denote fifty spirits in service of Enki and later, it referred to guardian statues which stood in the gateways of great temples.Within the works of magic, Lahamu assumes the form of a fiery de­mon-warrior with long flaming hair and appears on battlefields or places of bloodshed. Sometimes, he has a staff in the shape of a serpent, casting light­ning. On other occasions, his very arms are in the form of lightning bolts. His energy is fiery, violent and extremely aggressive. He comes with rage and fury and he endows the practitioner with knowledge of magical war­fare with the use of fire and lightning. In rites of evocation, he is sometimes accompanied by his twin sister who embodies forces opposite to his own-93-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatpowers. While the essence of Lahamu is fire and lust, his female counterpart represents death and entropy. Her energy is cold and she manifests with vi­sions of filth and waste. She is a ruthless vampire who feeds on life-force of her victims and when evoked, she appears in the form of a huge spider with a human head, torso and arms. She has six arms and all of them have blades instead of hands and forearms. She is called to the Temple by the same for­mula, as her male counterpart and by the same name. Also, both forms may be successfully used in rites of malediction and personal self-empowerment. However, she comes on rare occasions and it is easier and more natural to establish contact with the male, fiery form of Lahamu.Lahamu, himself, has vampiric qualities, as well. When invoked, he enters consciousness with an intense surge of energy, yet this is often ex­perienced by the practitioner as being devoured and deprived of personal life-force, while the nerves are being filled with fire and electricity, the en­ergy of the spirit. This is an ecstatic and erotic experience. Communion of energies occurs through a particular type of sexual union. He bites his fore­arm and lets you drink his essence, while he drinks yours. It feels erotic, but the consumption is not through flesh and sexual fluids but through blood, by devouring each other in ecstatic union until your consciousness entirely merges with the essence of the demon. His blood tastes metallic and it is invigorating and rejuvenating. He comes with tongues of flames and light­ning, which coil around like snakes and consumes your vital force, replacing it with the fiery energies of the spirit as you lie naked on his altar. A rite of invocation leaves the practitioner empowered and focused, alert and excited, but not actually aroused in sexual way. He is called through the sacrifice of sexual fluids, but energies released through erotic ecstasy are sublimated and channelled into the intent of the work.He inspires electric, fiery and ecstatic visions and he brings dreams of forgotten shrines located somewhere in the desert, rivers of blood flowing into underground temples, and altars surrounded by rings of fire. Because of violent and destructive aspects, he might be associated with the qlipha Golachab, the dark and fiery counterpart of Geburah, represented by violent spirits of wrath. Yet, because of the spirit’s masculine and sexual aspects, he might also belong to the level of Ghagiel, ruled by the Dark God of the Qli- poth who brings apocalypse to the world and destroys the universe.-94-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"LahamuEvocationTrace the lines of the sigil with your own blood while chanting the name of the demon.

His teeth are thin and sharp, like the teeth of a beast. His eyes glow amber. Instead of forearms and hands, he has writhing serpents which shift into bolts of lightning. His essence is both fiery and electric, furious and lustful. An offering of sexual fluids is essential, both in rites of evocation and invocation. But, above all, he has to be evoked through blood, both human and animal. In works of hostile sor­cery, he strikes the target with lightning, tearing through protective shields, and rips the spiritual body, feasting on vital forces of the victim. The at­tack triggers a rush of adrenaline into the blood of the target and makes the blood flow faster. This is a form of astral vampirism, a mixture of pain and delight, which leads to a rapid loss of vital energies. At the time of full moon, Lahamu sometimes appears as a dark hunter with face shifting into a skull, clothed with wolf skin and wearing a horned helmet with deer horns.

In this sense, the demon is the punisher of transgressors and the bringer of disease. Some­times, it is depicted with a mace and an upraised dagger and regarded as a protective entity. The name of the spirit translates as the “Big Weather Beast” and it is thought to be the adversary of the Sun God or an associate of the storm god Adad. Violent weather phenomena such as roaring storms were imagined as “released from the sky” and personified by leonine monsters. It is probable that Ugallu is one of these mythological creatures.Within works of magic, the spirit manifests powers connected with air, electricity and water. Ugallu has feminine nature and in rites of evocation, appears either as an abstract vortex of energy or in anthropomorphic female-101-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatform, airy, translucent and made up from the essence of shadows and black clouds. She comes with flashes of lightning and sounds of thunder which resemble the roaring of the lions. She claims to have the power to blast the whole world by violent storms and raging winds. When invoked, the spirit charges the practitioner with a huge amount of electric power, which can be used for magical purposes. This feels like a rapid and extremely ecstatic as­cent of energy along the spinal column, focused in the third eye. A whirling vortex opens in the centre of the forehead, connecting the mind with the energies of the spirit which manifest through the astral plane. By controlling the astral vortex of chaos, the practitioner can “stir” the force and cause changes on material plane, influence events, inflict damage on the enemy, and shape reality. The essence of this energy is highly destructive and when focused, it is possible to cast this astral force as a powerful lightning bolt in magical combat. If trained, this practice is a very powerful magical weapon.It is easiest and most natural to establish contact with this spirit through dreams. Ugallu inspires dreams of flying, levitating and travelling through the air, riding on storms and rising on tongues of lightning. In a trance of possession, she lifts the soul beyond the flesh in ecstatic flight over dark wa­ters, unquiet lakes and raging seas. The astral form of the practitioner shifts into a black wraith and flies through the planes on the wings of shadow. On the qlipothic Tree of Night, this demon might perhaps be associated with A’Arab Zaraq, the astral sphere of storms and lightning, connected with wa­ter and the energy of Dark Venus.EvocationTrace the lines of the sigil with a few drops of your own blood while chant­ing the name of the demon.

He also appears in the city of black pyramids, with hundreds of buildings and constructions made of unearthly material, neither metal nor stone. When invoked, he rips the practitioner’s flesh and releases the spirit, which is experienced as pain­ful but enlightening. He wraps the body in his black essence, which is dense and stifling, and transforms the soul through his nuclear force. It feels like being devoured by a black cosmic hole which is alive and swallows every­thing, including worlds, stars, galaxies, and he decomposes all matter into pure energy.

The heart is ripped out and devoured, and the body turns black, as if burnt. This can manifest as a disease, which deprives the target of vital forces or as an accident with fire and burning.

In artwork of later periods, such crea­tures commonly appear alongside the Sun God and the linguistic part -1и11й usually denotes a human upper body. The legend of Gilgamesh mentions a scorpion-man and a scorpion-woman as guardians of the mountain where the sun rises and sets, yet from a magical point of view these entities are distinct from the spirit described in the Enuma Elish. In early mythology, Girtablullu manipulated heavenly bodies with its pincers and was identified with the constellation of Sagittarius.In works of magic, Girtablullu appears either as a huge black scorpion or as a half-man half-scorpion, with human upper body.

This is related to the art of astral shape-shifting into venomous predator who can inject toxic substances into the aura of his victim. Energies of Girtablullu are solar and fiery and the target is infected with noxious essence which turns blood into burning poison. In rites of invocation, his energy enters the flesh through the solar plexus and spreads onto other bodily parts, inducing transforma­tion, which is experienced at first as agonizing pain but then it changes into ecstasy. This is often accompanied by visions of being torn to pieces and re-created with the very flesh of the demon, or bleeding out on the altar in the temple of Girtablullu, while blood is being replaced by the spirits ven­om. Because of this poisonous power he might perhaps be associated with the Samael qlipha which contains the chalice of spiritual poison and is called “The Venom of God.”Girtablullu is also the guardian of forgotten knowledge and forbidden gnosis of lost civilizations. His temples are hidden underground and buried deep beneath the desert sands, on the Other Side of the world. He appears when the sun disappears behind the horizon, emerging from the Gate of Sun­set. He is the lord of all creatures that dwell underground and hide from the burning sun but walk upon the surface of the earth when the stars shine in the sky, crawling out of their abode in black pits and dark caves. His tem­ples are buried under the desert and hidden among rocks and mountains, and can be accessed through the gate of the setting sun or through portals of timeless sands. They are carved inside huge black rocks and decorated with golden ornaments. He dwells in deserted cities inhabited only by phantoms and undead, where blood flows in fountains and aqueducts instead of water. When summoned, he appears with the army of monsters, scorpions or half­men half-scorpions forming from sands and rocks. Girtablullu, himself, arises from the desert sands, forming into a venomous black scorpion who rules the desert at night. Sometimes, he has a ball of fire at the end of his tail with which he can crush and burn those who get in his way. But apart from the scorpion, he also assumes the shape of a dragon.

She is connected with watery abysses, underwater temples and extremely bloody cults. Her powers represent the principle of death and decay, cosmic entropy and purification of consciousness through putrefaction. She inspires dreams about underground caves and underwater temples with cruel ceremonies in which her priestesses murder male sacrificial victims while copulating with them, feeding the demon with their flesh and their blood. When invoked, she devours the practitioner in an erotic union, which is experienced as be­ing immersed in filth and decaying blood, suffocating or drowning in black water filled with rotten corpses. This is accompanied by atavistic sensations, affecting thoughts, feelings and emotions. Even the breath and natural phys­iology of the organism slow down and it feels like the whole flesh is falling into pieces, transformed by the black essence of the demon.In magical warfare, Kulullu teaches the practitioner how to send out energy in the form of watery predators which devour the life-force of a vic­tim and leave the body empty as a shell. She is venomous and bloodthirsty, feeding on vital essence and sexual energies. She incites thoughts of murder and bloody fantasies. She also feeds on dreams of the victim, transforming them into unbearable nightmares. When evoked to visible form, she strikes the target with her venom, thrusting tentacles into the subtle body of the victim. In rites of invocation, she fills the practitioner’s consciousness with cold, emotionless stillness, which keeps the mind focused and ruthless to­wards the target. On the qlipothic Tree of Night, Kulullu might be associated with the Satariel qlipha, the level ruled by the demon-whore of the Qlipoth, the Saturnian sphere of death and decay.-138-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"KULULLUThe Eye of the SpiderEvocationOpen the ritual by tracing the lines of the sigil with your blood and chanting the name of the demon.

The sacrifice of blood may be partially substituted by the offering of sexual fluids, which she accepts as willingly as life essence. Kulullu manifests in the Temple with the stench of rotting flesh or decaying blood in the air. The atmosphere grows ominous and the temperature drops by a few degrees. The sigil appears in the mirror or above the altar and drips dark red blood. In rites of hostile sorcery, Kulullu brings flesh-eating diseases, which cause the rotting of the body, infections, inflammations, poisoning and slow and painful chronic illnesses. Her essence works slowly, infecting the flesh and stealing the vi­tal force of the victim in a long and harsh process.

Call the name of the demon and trace her sigil in the air. You will see a creature emerging from the lake. She is an entity in human form, but she has the tail of a fish and empty fish eyes. Instead of hair, she has black tentacles coming out of her head and writhing around. At first glance, they look like black eels, but they are not. The water in the lake is pitch black and pieces of rotting human and animal flesh are floating around. The stench of rot and decay is almost suffocating. The demon touches your forehead, gaz­ing straight into your eyes and your consciousness merges with hers. You can feel your flesh transforming into a strange hybrid of half-human, half-fish, with hairy tentacles which resemble spider limbs. You are also being filled with the demons essence which feels cold, deadly and focused. You can use this energy for astral attack, e.g. by sending out astral eels which enter the body of a victim through the throat or through the mouth and devour the vital force until there is nothing left, or by “drowning” the victim in black astral waters of putrefaction.

Everything is green and blue and the water is cloudy. Call the name of the demon. You will see a creature resembling a mixture of a crab and a spider, completely black. The atmosphere is ominous and slightly electrified. Follow the demon until she leads you to an underwater cave, which is the entrance to a hidden temple. Above the gateway, there is a female eye, alive and blinking. Walls are covered with hieroglyphs and each of them contains the glyph of a circle.

It is calm and empty, as if there was no life around, no birds, no animals, not even insects. You are standing in front of a huge rock. Use your blood to paint the sigil of the demon on the rock and chant her name. The rock will crack, revealing the entrance to a cave. The cave is huge and the entrance looks like made of branches of a tree, but they are alive and resemble hairy spider legs. Above the entrance, there is also an eye, alive and moving. When you go inside, you notice that these hairy branches are all around and there is only small space in the center and no passage to go further. Beneath your feet you can see the roots of this strange tree which grow into the cave. Use your blood again - let a few drops fall on the roots and the ground will start moving down, like a lift, taking you to the Underworld. When it stops, you will find yourself in a huge, long tunnel, built around the river of blood. Call the name of the demon again. You will see a barque with a spectral ferryman who will take you to a portal of pulsating red light.

In Akkadian and Babylonian art, this entity is usually associated with the Sun God, Shamash, along with Uri- dimmu. He holds door posts and emblems, often the sun-disc.

His energy is solar and is often experienced through visions of the burning sun, or through sigils and glyphs based on solar imagery. His power is the primal force of creation, initiating dynamic movement, action, progress, and evo­lution. However, it is also very destructive and can be used for death magic, curses and other works of malediction.When invoked, he enters the body and the soul in a surge of overwhelm­ing, abstract and atavistic energy. Mundane perception is immediately swept away and human patterns of thinking are transformed into primal consciousness. This can literally deprive the practitioner of the ability to speak, write or express thoughts by verbal means for a certain time - e.g. a few hours or even a few days. He holds the power to shape the matter and the spirit, to transform the soul and to fortify the body with his boundless essence.Kusarikku inspires dreams of the desert and primordial visions of cre­ation and destruction, images of making golems from clay and breathing the spark of the soul into their mortal bodies, or pictures of wastelands and ruins of civilizations. On the qlipothic Tree of Night, he might perhaps be associated with the Thaumiel qlipha, along with the shadow-demon Uri- dimmu, with whom he is involved in an eternal fight, like two demonic rul­ers of Thaumiel - Satan and Moloch.

When Tiamat was slain by Marduk, Kingu was imprisoned along with the other deities who had sided with the Mother Goddess. Eventually, he was sacrificed and his blood was mixed with earth in order to mould the first human beings. As one of the dead gods, he is now supposed to dwell in the Underworld, in the kingdom of shadows. His blood, however, lives in each human being as the legacy of the Forgotten Gods.The Tablets of Destiny, or the Tablet of Destinies, was reputedly a clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, a legal document, on which all de­cisions of the gods were recorded.

According to legends and stories, there were ei­ther three tablets or one, which Kingu wore as a breastplate in the battle against the army of Marduk. Within the rites of magic, however, the Demon God often appears with twelve tablets, worn around the neck in the shape of a necklace. They are made of dark, unearthly substance, and they look like memory bars with information about the whole universe and all creation recorded in their layers. They represent the knowledge that was lost with the fall of the Primordial Gods and is occasionally tapped and recovered by humanity in the pursuit of technology and science. In metaphorical sense, the recovery of this knowledge bestows the authority over the universe and grants the power to influence the lives and the fates of all living beings, the power over life and death. Hence, the stories about gods fighting over the tablets, monsters and demons trying to steal them for their own purpose, and the legends of mythical powers attributed to those who ever held the Destinies.In rites of evocation, Kingu appears as a demon-warrior, with snake skin and fiery eyes. He is red and his energy is red as well, manifesting as tongues of crimson flame. Snakes coil around his arms and he holds a fiery trident in his hand. He is furious, fierce and virile. He rarely communicates by verbal means and he will rather pierce your third eye with his flaming gaze and speak to you from within than converse in any traditional way.Kingu also comes in his scorpion form, as half-man half-scorpion, red and fiery.

His eyes are burning with red flames and fiery snakes coil around his arms. He inspires visions of underground temples lit by red or purple light, where blood is poured over sacrificial altars, and where the army of demons gath­ers at his command. In works of invocation, when his powers are bestowed on the practitioner, he grants the authority and leadership over the hordes of fiends and monsters lying in wait behind the Gates of the Night. This is the power to command legions of familiars, forces of Primordial Chaos, which can be used in rites of malediction or bound as guardians of the Temple.

Immersion in the waters of Tiamat represents the first, ini­tiatory process: the alchemical solutio or the Nigredo (Blackening). Water is the principle of dissolution which disintegrates and purifies the imperfect body of the initiate. This is the essence of primordial chaos and entropy, represented in mythologies as the Dragon Goddess Tiamat.

It is the matrix of all creation. In psychological sense, they represent the collective unconscious. Purifica­tion and distillation of the flesh and the spirit in the black waters of Tiamat bring the practitioner to the focus on transcendent consciousness and the principle of alchemical coagulation - self re-creation.This process of re-creation begins at the next stage of alchemical Mag­num Opus - the Albedo (Whitening) in which the prime matter is purified. The next step is taken at the stage of the Citrinitas (Yellowing), which enno­bles the prime matter. The final transmutation is accomplished at the stage of the Rubedo (Reddening), which also represents the ascent of the Kundali- ni. This is symbolized by the sun entering the zenith. The consciousness is unified and the process of re-creation or coagulation is complete.

Ideally, the ceremony should be performed by and a male practitioner, providing suitable vessels for the energies. Depending on participants’ choice, the sacrament of communion may be consumed purely on spiritual level or through sexual union, transforming the feast of flesh into ecstasy of the spirit.The purpose of the ritual is to awaken the power of Kingu, the Drag­on Within, by activating the demonic element that is contained in human blood, and to unite it with the energy of Tiamat, the Dragon Without. Therefore, a sacrifice of blood is necessary, and an offering of sexual fluids is recommended. Solitary practitioners can perform this working without a partner. This can be done in two ways: either by invoking the energy of one godform into the temple of flesh and evoking the other to physical manifes­tation, or by invoking both deities in order to experience the communion of the energies from within. It can also be performed as a group ritual, with the Magus and the Priestess leading the ceremony and channeling the energies upon the other participants.The text of the ritual includes quotations from the Enuma Elish13. You will need a ritual blade, a chalice filled with red wine, representing the blood of the Dragon, and enough candles to light up the Temple.

While Apsu personifiedthe underground ocean and the source of all fresh waters on the earth, the whole universe was surrounded by the primordial waters of Tiamat, the ocean of Primal Chaos, the Land of No Return. The Netherworld represent­ed the cosmic concept of the empty space between the earths crust and the primeval sea. There are many stories and legends about the Underworld, and the origins of the myth vary depending on the historical period. Generally, it was believed that either the waters of Apsu were the land of death itself or this realm was located somewhere nearby. It was separated from the world of the living by an underground river Hubur (or id lu rugu, which in Sumerian meant “the river which block’s a man’s way”), and the crossing of the river was equivalent with the final separation from the world of man after which the soul came to dwell in the realm of shadows for eternity.The concept of the journey across the River of the Underworld is en­countered in many cultures, e.g. also in ancient Greece or Egypt. Usually, a discarnate soul travelled to the realm of the dead in assistance of a ghastly ferryman. It was so in Greek mythology, where dead people had to cross Styx in Charon’s boat, the legend which is probably familiar to most of the readers. But, the roots of the story are found in the Sumerian lore. In the famous epic of Gilgamesh, the hero crosses the waters of death with the help of Ur-shanabi, a demonic ferryman. Not much is known about him from the myth itself, but in the story he is associated with uww-snakes, the pri­mordial monsters of Tiamat, therefore we might assume that he is one of the*187*"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatdemonic beings created by the Dragon Goddess, who gained a new function in the Divine Order. There is also a neo-Assyrian poem of the vision of the Underworld in which we encounter another demonic ferryman named Hu- mut-tabal, which means “hurry and take away,” described in the story as a horrible monster.On the other side of the river was the land of the dead to which human souls had to go when they left their mortal bodies. Only they could cross the waters of death. Mortal man was not allowed to travel to the Land of No Re­turn, and those who dared to oppose the Divine Laws, became trapped there forever. Only heroes such as Gilgamesh, who went to the Underworld to visit his dead friend Enkidu, could embark on such a journey and return alive. Also, there are stories of gods descending to the realm of shadows, such as the popular myth of the goddess Inanna, who descended from the heavens to the Underworld, was torn apart by the demons, reborn, and returned vic­toriously to the world of Light.Descriptions of the realm of death depict a rather somber and dire vi­sion of the afterlife, roughly corresponding to the sheol of the ancient He­brews. The Mesopotamian Underworld was the land devoid of any light, full of dust, and there was no water to drink. It was called “the home which one may enter, but never leave,” “the road from which there is no return” and “the dwelling where those entering find blindness.”14 The spirits of the dead were either naked or with wings of birds. Souls wandered hopelessly in search for food, but they did not find anything that could satiate their hunger. Those who were not forgotten by their relatives received food and drinks in the form of offerings left at the graves. But, the souls whose families were no longer among the living had to suffer the fate of endless wandering through the underground kingdom in great tortures and agony. The worst suffering, however, was left for those whose corpses were not buried properly. They became phantoms and haunted the Underworld, and sometimes they also visited the world of man in search for oblivion or in order to torture the living. It is also significant that in the realm of death all souls were equal. From the epic of Gilgamesh, we learn that even kings and emperors suffered the same fate as the souls of servants and slaves. There were also spirits who became demons. The Underworld was the abode of the gidim (Akkadian etemmu), restless souls who had to be propitiated by offerings of food, drink, and olive (the offering was called kispu). This was the duty of the dead per­14 Francois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic. Its Origin and Development-188-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Underworldson’s family and relatives. It was believed that the gidim, when deprived of food, might become vicious and return from the Underworld to haunt and torture the living. They could even possess a living person by entering the body through ears, or they caused painful and deadly diseases: e.g. there was a psychic disorder called qat et (literally “the hand of the ghost”), or sibit etemmi (“seizure by a ghost”), which had physical symptoms of an illness but was believed to be a form of possession.The Underworld was associated with many names and attributes: arali, irkalla, kukku, ekur, kigal, ganzir, or simplu ki, kur (Sumerian “earth”), or the Akkadian ersetu. The land of the dead was called “the land of no return,” “the desert” or “the great below.” It was usually located far away, in an un­known distance, often in the west or south-west. However, these depictions are different in each myth, epic and legend. Sumerian accounts locate the Underworld east of Mesopotamia. Its entrance was in the mountains and the gate was ganzir, to which the soul descended down the long stairway. At the gate, there was a guardian who watched to ensure that no one, apart from the dead souls, entered the land of death. In the myth of Inanna’s de­scent into the Underworld we encounter a guardian named Neti. In other accounts, these are the twin brothers, Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea, standing at the left and the right sides of the gate. In Mesopotamian artwork, each of them is depicted with an axe and a club. Sometimes, the entrance to the Netherworld was watched by the Scorpion Man, alone or assisted by other similar beings. However, there are also sources which do not mention any creatures guarding the gate at all.The rulers of the Underworld were the goddess Ereshkigal and her hus­band Nergal. The name Ereshkigal is translated as the “Queen of the Great Below.” She was also known as the Akkadian goddess Allatu. Her first hus­band was Gugal-ana. It was his funeral celebration that brought Inanna to the land of her dark sister, though there are several different versions of this myth as well. The son of Ereshkigal and Gugal-ana was Ninazu, the god whose sacred animal was the serpent-dragon (mushussu). After the death of her husband, the queen of the Underworld married Nergal, the violent and terrifying warrior-god. Nergal was believed to be the son of Enlil and Ninlil. He was also called Erra (but it was rather the name of another dark deity with whom Nergal was associated) and sometimes, he was identified with one of the twin brothers who guarded the gate, Meslamta-ea. The main centre of Nergal’s worship was located in the Sumerian city of Kutha, the—189^"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Grimoire of Tiamatname of which became one of the names of the Underworld, specifically associated with the main city in the land of the dead. Originally, Nergal was the god of the sun heat, fever, and plague. He was responsible for fires and disasters. His planet was Mars. He was depicted in a long robe, with one leg stretched out, and with his foot on a dais or treading upon a human being. In his hand, he usually held a curved sword and a sceptre with lion heads. Together with Ereshkigal, he dwelt in the palace protected by seven gates. Each gate was locked and watched by a guardian. Everyone who wanted to pass through the gates had to leave all things connected with the world of the living, as it is presented in the myth of Inanna’s descent into the Under­world. At the entrance of each gate, the guardian requested that she removed and left one article of clothing and jewelry. This is because the souls could enter the land of the dead only after breaking all ties with the world in which they lived before.The souls travelling to the Underworld were not subjected to any judg­ment. Ereshkigal only sentenced them to death, and then their names were written on the tablets by the scribe, the goddess Geshtinana.15 Other deities from Ereshkigals retinue were: Ningishzida, Namtar, and Enmesarra. Nin- gishzida was the son of Ninazu. In Babylonian magical charms he appears as the keeper of the demons of the Underworld. His symbolic animal was the horned serpent or a dragon (basmu), and in astrology, he was ascribed to the constellation of Hydra. Namtar was Ereshkigals vizier and messenger. His name meant “destiny” or “fate ” As we observed before, he was also a malevolent demon and a bringer of disease. Also, there was a group of deities called Anunnaki who were believed to reside in the land of the dead. They were the offspring of the sky god, Anu, and their number varied depending on a literary source, but generally, they were fifty creatures. Although orig­inally they were deities of the earth and the sky, in the middle-Babylonian period, they came to be identified with the lower world, contrary to the de­ities of the sky, the Igigi. In certain accounts, the Anunnaki resided in the Underworld city of Irkalla, where they passed the judgment over the souls entering the Land of No Return.Apart from discarnate souls of men, gods presiding over the land of death, and occasional visitors, we also encounter many demons and dei­ties who reside in the Underworld after death. According to Mesopotamian15 There are sources which mention a sort of “judgment” of the dead but there are no details and the whole concept is very unclear.-190-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Underworldbeliefs, gods were not immortal, or in other words, not all gods possessed the gift of immortality. They did not die from natural causes, but were usu­ally killed in fight. In Mesopotamian artwork, we often see gods fighting demons, monsters or deities and one slaying the other. Inanna, killed by Ereshkigal, is forced to stay in the Underworld until the gods of the heav­ens come to rescue her. The dead deities had to dwell in the Netherworld like the souls of humans. But, sometimes, the fate of the dead deities was unknown, as it is in the case of such “dead” gods as Tiamat, Apsu, Kingu or the demon, Humbaba (Huwawa), killed by Gilgamesh. The dead gods, however, were still worshipped and received offerings. It was believed that even though they dwell in the land of the dead, they still have their powers and can influence the world of the living. It was the same with the demons of Tiamat, even though slain by Marduk, they were still regarded as dangerous and deadly.There were also legends in which the Sun God Shamash traveled at night to the Land of No Return as the Sun of the Underworld. It was believed that each day at sunset he descended to the land of death in order to shine the light over the lowest regions. This story resembles the Egyptian tale about the daily journey of the Sun God Ra into the Underworld realm of Amenti, from which he returned at sunrise. This journey was the cause why the low­est regions of the Underworld became associated with fire and heat which sometimes manifests on the earth in the form of volcanic eruptions. Never­theless, in other accounts, Shamash rests at night not in the Underworld, but in the centre of heavens. A similar function is ascribed to god Nindara, who was the nocturnal sun, the sun of the Netherworld. Plunged in the regions of the night, he defeated the Darkness which surrounded him with his solar power and rose triumphant at the dawn of the day. He was a warrior god, an arbitrator, a judge, and a regulator of destiny16Among Mesopotamian myths which describe the Underworld, one of the less known and the most interesting stories is the neo-Assyrian epic of the vision of the Other Side seen by the prince Kumaya. He prayed for a dream in which he could see when he was going to die. Having heard his prayers, the goddess, Ereshkigal, promised that she would show him what he wished to see. And so, in his following dream, he descended to the Un­derworld where he saw fifteen demonic creatures. They were so terrifying that he was unable to describe them. He also noticed a dark human figure16 Francois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic.

He was furious that the prince dared to enter the land of the dead and wanted to kill him, but the god, Ishum, came to protect him and the prince went back to the world of the living. It is often thought that this prince was Assurbanipal, the future king of the Assyrian Empire.Descent into the Great BelowThe working is a visual journey to the Underworld, based on the imagery from myths and legends about the Mesopotamian land of death. It is de­signed as a path-working with the opening of the Gates and the invocation of the gods of the Underworld.Place a few drops of your blood on a ritual blade and trace the Key of the Night in front of you.

You are facing the gate to the land of the dead. The entrance is guarded by two human figures, one of them is armed with an axe, the other with a club. Speak the words of greeting in the name of Tia- mat, the Dragon of the Void, and ask them to open the gate for you. When this is done, walk through the door.You are now on a long stairway which leads down, into the land of the dead. As you descend, it gets darker and darker, and after a while, all you can see is a strange red light. Now, you stand before the first gate to the Land of No Return. A demonic watcher comes to greet you and demands that you leave a piece of your clothing (or jewelry), which represents something personal, something that binds you to the mundane world. Whatever he asks, give it to the watcher, who will then let you walk through the gate, and continue your journey. The same happens at the remaining six gates. Each item you leave is meaningful and represents your attachment to the world of the living. You have to sacrifice it all before you can enter the land of the dead. There are seven gates to the Underworld and you have to pass this test at each of them. Take as much time as it is needed for this part of the journey. Meditate on what you are asked to leave behind and what these things mean to you. When you feel ready, proceed with the meditation.You are now in the Underworld.
