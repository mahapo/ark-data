LewisIn October 1994, 53 members of the Order of the Solar Temple (l’Ordre du Temple Solaire, or OTS) in Switzerland and Quebec, Canada, were murdered or committed suicide. On 4 October, a fi re destroyed a villa in Morin Heights, Canada, belonging to Joseph Di Mambro, the group’s leader. Police found fi ve charred bodies in the ruins. Three had been stabbed to death before the fi re. At 1:00 a.m. on 5 October, a fi re started in Ferme des Rochettes, near Cheiry, in the canton of Fribourg, one of the centers of the Solar Temple in Switzerland. Police found 23 bodies in a room that had been converted into a temple. Some had been shot; many others were found with their heads inside plastic bags. At 3:00 a.m. on the same day, three chalets inhabited by members of the Solar Temple caught fi re almost simultaneously at Les Granges-sur-Salvan, in the Swiss Valais canton. Here police found 25 bodies, along with the remains of the devices that had initiated the fi res as well as the pistol used in the Ferme des Rochettes shootings.For many months prior to this initial spate of murder-suicides, rumors of fi nancial mismanagement had been circulating among Solar Temple members. On 30 September, shortly before the group’s dramatic fi nal “transit,” a three-month-old infant was killed at their Canadian site by a wooden stake driven through its heart. The parents, who were ex-members of the Temple, were also brutally murdered. Surviving members explained that Joseph Di Mambro had ordered the killing because the baby was the Antichrist. Several days later, Di Mambro and 12 followers convened a ritual Last Supper together. The murder-suicides took place not long after this meeting. Fifteen members of the inner circle—referred to as the “awakened”—took poison; 30 others—the “immortals”—were shot or smothered to death; while another eight, termed “traitors,” were also murdered.The plan seems to have been for the fi re to more or less completely destroy everything in the Swiss centers. This would have compelled investigators to focus on the group’s self-interpretation of their actions—a self-interpretation embodied in four letters, or “Testaments,” that were sent to 60 journalists, scholars, and government offi cials. However, because the incendiary devices at the main center in the Cheiry farmhouse failed to ignite, many documents and other artifacts remained intact. One of the Testaments, addressed “To All Those Who Can Still Understand the Voice of Wisdom,” issued a call for other Solar Temple sympathizers to follow their example: [F]rom the Planes where we will work from now on and by a just law of magnetism, we will be in the position of calling back the last Servants capable of hearing this last message ... may our Love and our Peace accompany you during the terrible tests of the Apocalypse that await you. Know that from where we will be, we will always hold our arms open to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple2receive those who are worthy of joining us. [See Appendix 1 for the complete text of the Testaments.]This invitation from the Temple members to join them in the beyond found a receptive audience. On 16 December 1995, 16 of the remaining European members disappeared from their homes in France and Switzerland. Four left notes hinting at a second mass suicide. Thirteen adults and three children were later found dead in a remote forest in southeast France. Investigators concluded that at least four of them did not die willingly. Most had been drugged. Two of the 16 had shot the others, poured gasoline over their bodies, set them on fi re, and then shot themselves so that they would fall into the fl ames. Finally, fi ve additional adult members and three teenage children apparently tried to commit suicide on the spring equinox of 20 March 1997, in Quebec. The attempt failed due to faulty equipment. The teenage sons and daughter of one of the couples convinced their parents that they wanted to live. They were then allowed to leave, and the adults subsequently succeeded in burning down the house with themselves in it. Four of the bodies were arranged to form a cross. The teens were found drugged and disoriented, but otherwise safe, in a nearby building. A note was found describing the group’s belief that death on earth leads to a transit to a new planet where their lives would continue.The Solar Temple tragedies played a pivotal role in infl aming the cult controversy in Europe. Although European anticultists had been active for decades, the spectacle of the murder-suicides infl uenced public opinion to support harsher actions against new religious movements (NRMs). Interestingly, this came at around the same time that the North American anticult movement suffered a severe setback as a consequence of the bankruptcy of the Cult Awareness Network (Melton 1999: 229). The Solar Temple incidents were directly responsible for prompting European governments to begin issuing offi cial reports on the dangers posed by nontraditional religions (Introvigne 2004: 207) and, particularly in France and Belgium, a growing campaign emerged to “combat” alternative religions (Hervieu-Léger 2004: 49; Palmer 2004: 65; Lucas 2004: 346). The incidents also helped bolster the North American anticult movement, which supplied consultants for European governments, as well as the mind control ideology that became a central element of European reports and subsequent legislation (Shupe et al. 2004: 198).Neo-TemplarismThe Solar Temple’s founder, Joseph Di Mambro, had sampled a variety of esoteric groups, including the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC). In the 1960s, he came into contact with several persons who would later play a role in Solar Temple history, including Jacques Breyer, who had initiated a “Templar resurgence” in France in 1952. Several groups, including the Order of the Solar Temple, have their roots in Breyer’s work.“Templar” in this context refers to the Knights Templar, the medieval order to which groups in the neo-Templar tradition ultimately trace their lineage. (This"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction3claimed lineage is spurious; instead, neo-Templar groups are esoteric organizations in the theosophical tradition.) A wealthy, powerful order, the Knights Templar had inspired envy among European rulers. As a consequence, in 1307 the Templars were accused (probably falsely) of heresy and arrested en masse. In 1310, 54 knights who had recanted earlier confessions were burned alive at the stake. And four years later, the Grand Master of the order and a provincial leader were similarly burned alive. The fi res set or attempted by Solar Temple members during all the murder-suicide incidents recounted above seem to have been inspired by the fi ery deaths of the original Templars. Some observers (for example Introvigne, in this volume) have noted that the 53 OTS deaths in October 1994 almost certainly represented an attempt to mimic the 54 original Templar deaths. However, this attempt was frustrated by the last-minute escape of Thierry Huguenin, a Swiss dentist and ex-member who had “sensed trouble at Granges-sur-Salvan and fl ed” before he could be murdered (Harriss 1997).Though a secretive organization, the original Knights Templar were almost certainly Orthodox Christians. However, their secrecy—in combination with the charges of heresy leveled against them in the fourteenth century—provided fertile grounds for speculation, allowing later esotericists to hypothesize that the order was secretly an esoteric-magical group. This line of speculation—bolstered by the unlikely claim that the order secretly survived into modern times—underlies contemporary neo-Templarism.Massimo Introvigne, a scholar of the western magical milieu (Introvigne 1990), observes that most modern neo-Templar groups trace their origin to the Order of the Temple founded in 1805 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat. “This French physician and Freemason claimed to represent an uninterrupted succession of Templar ‘Grand Masters’ operating secretly since the suppression of the medieval Order in the fourteenth century” (Introvigne 2000: 140). It was this tradition that Breyer revived in the mid-twentieth century. It is interesting to note that the same neo-Templar tradition that attracted the founders of the Solar Temple informs the fi ctional Templarism found in Dan Brown’s bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code (2003).OverviewDespite the obvious importance of the Solar Temple, there have been relatively few scholarly studies of this group. The present collection brings together some of the best research on the Solar Temple—a selection of articles previously published in English, translations of French articles, a set of original papers, and a selection of Solar Temple documents—to produce the fi rst book-length study of the group in English.The fi rst fi ve reprinted articles appear in the order in which they were originally published. Jean-François Mayer’s “Templars for the Age of Aquarius: The Archedia Clubs (1984–1991) and the International Chivalric Order of the Solar Tradition,”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple4which appeared in French in 1993, was the only academic treatment of the Solar Temple before the fi rst tragedy in 1994. It is translated here into English for the fi rst time.Massimo Introvigne’s “Ordeal by Fire: The Tragedy of the Solar Temple” was one of the fi rst scholarly articles to appear in the wake of the initial Solar Temple incident. In addition to providing an overview of the murder-suicides, Introvigne places the OTS in the context of contemporary occult-esoteric movements, particularly the neo-Templar tradition.In “Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple,” Susan Palmer explores the Solar Temple within the framework of Mary Douglas’s thinking about pollution fears and purity rituals. Palmer views this aspect of the OTS as an important factor in the murder-suicides, suggesting that “the magical aspect of the mass suicide expressed a concern for purity and for protecting the boundaries of their community.”John R. Hall’s and Philip Schuyler’s “The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple” is a reprint of the fi fth chapter of Hall et al.’s Apocalypse Observed. To date, this overview is probably the most comprehensive account of the Order of the Solar Temple and the murder-suicides available in English. Readers with little or no background knowledge of the OTS might best be served if they begin with this chapter.Jean-François Mayer’s “The Dangers of Enlightenment: Apocalyptic Hopes and Anxieties in the Order of the Solar Temple”—originally presented at a conference in 1999—provides an overview of some of the apocalyptic beliefs of the Solar Temple. Mayer is also concerned to draw lessons from this case that might be applied to other, potentially violent apocalyptic groups.In “Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence: The Case of the Order of the Solar Temple,” John Walliss points out that, despite their vision of a planetary apocalypse, the Solar Temple’s message was nevertheless optimistic. In the early days, OTS leaders not only believed they would survive, but also believed that they themselves would serve a role in the transition to the Aquarian Age. Walliss argues that this ideology of survival eventually gave way to one of death as a consequence of a series of crises in the group’s charismatic authority.In “Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple,” George D. Chryssides discusses how the Solar Temple’s worldview played a signifi cant role in the events that led to the group’s demise. He argues that there is a clearly identifi able worldview associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and that the group’s intellectual and spiritual pedigree can help to explain the notorious collective deaths of 1994, 1995, and 1997.Henrik Bogdan’s “Death as Initiation: Order of the Solar Temple and Rituals of Initiation” surveys Western esotericism and Masonic initiatory societies, focusing on the notion of death. Bogdan then examines the Solar Temple’s initiatory system and analyzes a number of rituals. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the suicides in relation to Western esotericism and rituals of initiation, suggesting that these factors might provide us with a partial key for explaining the OTS murder-suicides."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction5In “The Ordre du Temple Solaire and the Quest for the Absolute Sun,” Marc Labelle begins by noting that many contemporary religious movements are preoccupied with the eschatological signifi cance of the nuclear menace. He then discusses how the Solar Temple’s ideology was grounded in the desire to respond to—and, ultimately, escape from—nuclear and ecological disaster. This response was focused on a transformation of the human species. In his analysis, LaBelle draws on a variety of theorists, from Eliade to Freud.Roland J. Campiche’s “Sects, Media and End of the World” is essentially a condensation of his 1995 book Quand les sectes affolent: Ordre du Temple Solaire,medias et fi n de millénaire, which focuses on the representation of the OTS tragedy in the French-speaking media. Campiche is especially concerned with how the characteristic discourse of the modern mass media inevitably interprets religious organizations—especially groups like the Solar Temple—in non-religious terms."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Chapter 1Templars for the Age of Aquarius: The Archedia Clubs (1984–1991) and the International Chivalric Order of the Solar TraditionJean-François MayerForeword (2005)Before the 1994 “transit” of the Solar Temple made headlines across the world, few scholars were even aware of the existence of this small group. The following article was originally published in the January 1993 issue (no. 153) of the French newsletterMouvements Religieux. Insofar as I know, it is the only research article ever published on the group before it became infamous. For this reason, it can be considered as historical material. Consequently, it has been translated into English for this volume without any changes, updates, or corrections. Of course, we know much more today about the group. Moreover, the article had not used all the information that I had already gathered at the time, and focused primarily on the person of Luc Jouret and his work as a representative case of the way the “cultic milieu” operated. The article was part of a wider research project on the history and sociology of alternative religions in Switzerland; the full results of that project were published in the form of a 400-page book, Les Nouvelles Voies spirituelles. Enquête sur la religiosité parallèle en Suisse (Lausanne, 1993).Sometimes, the article was unknowingly premonitory—for instance when it claimed that the group would “draw researchers’ attention again one day,” although certainly not in the way the author had expected! The following article, published for the fi rst time in English in this volume, provides an insight into the way the Solar Temple could be seen from outside before it became tragically famous.As one will notice, the expression “Solar Temple” itself never appears. This reminds us that the group used several names (consecutively as well as simultaneously) over the years and launched several, partly overlapping structures, as can already be seen in several passages of this article. “Solar Temple”, however, became a convenient general label following the 1994 events. This paper covers what could have been described as the “exoteric” work of the organization in the late 1980s."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple8In contrast, most of the later articles on the Solar Temple have focused on its inner circle.Original Foreword (1993)As part of a large-scale study on new religious movements in Switzerland under the auspices of the Swiss National Foundation for Scientifi c Research (PNR 21), in 1987 we approached the Archedia Clubs active at the time in several cities of French-speaking Switzerland and France. In the fall of 1987, the “International Association of Sciences & Tradition Archedia Clubs” counted more than 350 members worldwide. The Archedia Clubs’ activities ceased during the summer of 1991. However, the movement embodied by the Archedia Clubs has not disappeared and could, in other forms, draw researchers’ attention again one day. The following case study is therefore intended as both a contribution to research on trends in contemporary alternative religiosity and an analysis of one stage in the history of a movement.1. Observing and Participating in a ClubOn 18 March 1987, homeopathic doctor Luc Jouret gave a lecture on the topic of “Love and Biology” in Lausanne (Switzerland) for “Archedia—Sciences and Tradition”. “In all existing forms, from the smallest to the largest, from the electron to the galaxy, we are witnessing a phenomenon of attraction,” read the fl yer. “Can we speak ... of an awareness underlying all things that drives us to regain our original unity?” The hundreds of people from Lausanne and beyond pressing their way into the room were undoubtedly expecting answers to these questions. A talented speaker, Luc Jouret knows how to captivate his audiences. He projects dynamism and youthfulness; he speaks in a friendly voice and does not use notes. The fact that he is a doctor also adds to his aura. However, his lecture soon strays from medicine and onto other topics. The main thread in his discussion is that humanity is on the cusp of the Age of Aquarius; religions will still exist in this new age, but will be “called to transform themselves in a unitary vision.” Luc Jouret discusses healthy eating (the majority of diseases are caused by not eating properly) as well as apocalyptic topics (forests are dying, volcanoes will erupt, and so on). He thus seems to possess both scientifi c knowledge and traditional wisdom.At the conference exit, members of the Lausanne Archedia Club handed out fl yers advertising an informational meeting about this group and its activities. I sent in my registration form and attended the 15 April information session in a rented room at a cultural center. The president of the local club began by explaining to the small audience that the Archedia approach was based on one fact: humanity was heading toward an impasse. Yet people can change the world only by changing themselves, and such was precisely the goal of the Archedia Clubs: “Everyone participates in the healing of the world at his or her own level.” He continued to explain that, as far as practical considerations were concerned, each club was managed by seven members"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Templars for the Age of Aquarius9and concentrated on a particular theme—food was Lausanne’s. A plenary meeting was held once a month. Since Archedia International was in fact an international association, it supervised the local clubs and ensured that the Charter and club ethics were respected. Moreover, he said, a more interior and spiritual work existed; it was founded on the “Solar Tradition.” In addition to the “Exterior Relations Commissioner” (who was French), a Solar Tradition representative who had traveled from Geneva was also present at the meeting. During the question and answer session we learned that these spiritual teachings fall within a Templar tradition.The Lausanne Club, founded three years earlier, counted 12 members at the time. The membership fees came to 142 Swiss francs per quarter, 105 of which went to Archedia International. The few newcomers present that evening were not asked to join the group immediately. Rather, the Archedia Clubs offered an “observer” membership as a fi rst step; this permitted one to participate in activities without commitment (for three or six months, depending on the club) before making an informed decision. Of course, to respect certain thresholds in the progression, those with this temporary status were not allowed to participate in activities of the Solar Tradition branch (to which not all members of the clubs belonged, in any case). However, a three- to four-month preparatory course for entrance into the spiritual group was available.This commitment-free trial period allowed contact to be maintained easily. On 6 May 1987, I was thus able to attend the monthly plenary meeting of the Lausanne Archedia Club. The meeting followed a precise order. In fact, that evening the club was inducting a new member. A vase containing a rose was placed on a table, and the new member read an “engagement of honor” aloud, promising to respect the ethics of the club and to work toward its growth.There were about fi fteen people present, including three “observer members.” The main topic of discussion was the fi rst international convention of the Archedia Clubs, which had taken place in Tours in April. The results of Dr Jouret’s March conference in Lausanne were also discussed. Because of the large audience, they had tried to launch a variety of activities; but in light of the small number of “observer members” it seemed that the predictions had been too optimistic. We later learned that out of the 618 people present on 18 March, one member and fi ve observer members joined two months later. The uncircumscribed nature of alternative religiosity makes it quite open to anything offered in the realm of the spiritual, but it does not lend itself to taking fi rm root: this was once again proven by the disproportionate number of enthusiastic audience members at Dr Jouret’s conference versus the number of those actually interested in joining the Archedia Clubs.On 21 May 1987, another kind of event took place in Lausanne: an “inter-club” meeting for the clubs of the Lake Geneva region (French-speaking Switzerland and neighboring areas in France). Sixty to 70 people had traveled there to attend. The discussion focused mainly on exterior relations. Two main concerns were raised: communicating a unifi ed image of the clubs and projecting an impression of professionalism to the outside world."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple10On 18 June 1987, the Lausanne Club organized a new information session. Of the 19 people present, nine were non-members. Several of the main topics of discussion from the 15 April session were picked up again, though in slightly different forms. At the 1 July 1987 club meeting, this information session was judged a success, even if it had resulted in only one observer member joining. However, it was noted in the minutes that, in order to meet the expectations of audience members, “it is necessary to further develop [the way we explain] the history of the club and what is really behind it.” The public is clearly interested in more than just the workshops on food—their curiosity is “above all piqued by the increasingly spiritual nature of Dr Jouret’s lectures,” as the president of the Lausanne Club explained at the 23 May “interclub” meeting.On 27 June 1987, near Bonneville (the headquarters of one of the clubs), we attended the festival of St John along with the members of that region’s clubs. The event took place in a prairie, with a pole in the middle to mark the location of the bonfi re—this spot had not been chosen at random, but according to cosmotelluric considerations. We made our way to the large circle, following a path marked by stakes to which ribbons had been attached. We were told that we should move within the circle only in the clockwise direction. A lot of attention had been given to the details: the harmonious arrangement of the buffet tables for example, as well as the trays of aesthetically pleasing food (freshly picked organic vegetables).There was a friendly and relaxed atmosphere among the eighty or so adult and several dozen children and adolescents who attended this event. When it came time for the ceremony, everyone formed a circle around the pole, the symbolic representation of the earth’s axis. The lighting of the fi re followed a precise order: seven people each brought a bundle of a different type of wood and read a short text summarizing the essential symbolic aspects of their wood before placing it on the pyre. The wood was then simultaneously set on fi re by the club presidents in attendance. Chanting and dancing around the fi re followed. All of this, combined with the nighttime and the magic of the fi re, contributed to a very warm and sociable feeling. A certain number of people remained there until dawn to watch the sunrise, according to the ancient custom.After these two months of attending Archedia Club events, it was already possible to summarize a few observations:a)Triple structure in the movement’s activities: at the Archedian conference in Tours the need to pursue “Operation Pelican” was stressed. This involved setting up a (Solar Tradition) lodge for each club in the near future. The triple structure was observable in: 1. External activity: conferences, intended for large audiences attracted by Luc Jouret, and generally organized by Amenta (the name Amenta Club had been used by the group which had assembled around Luc Jouret before the Archedia Clubs were founded in 1984.)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Templars for the Age of Aquarius11 2. “Internal-exoteric” activity: the Archedia Clubs proper, that had come into being in Geneva in 1984. According to Archedia leaders, A group of men with different backgrounds and complementary abilities, aware of the deterioration of the world and the disappearance of traditional values, decided to gather together sincere men and women who were sensitive to the same concerns. At fi rst existing in the form of experimental groups (Sciences & Tradition), they very quickly organized themselves into Clubs and, powered by their success and the desire to pursue further research into spirituality, the Solar Tradition Branch was born. 3. “Internal-esoteric” activity: the International Chivalric Order of the Solar Tradition, which was also created in 1984.b)Structure already in place for a movement of much larger dimensions: the number of activities led by the handful of Lausanne members was striking. What is more, it all took place in a very structured context, each activity being recorded in minutes, reports, etc. The text of the “Universal Charter of the Sciences & Tradition Archedia Clubs,” the “International Constitution of the International Association of Sciences and Tradition Archedia Clubs” and the “Rules for Application” of the latter confi rmed this fi rst impression: there were precise and detailed rules, projects organized geographically by “sector,” “region” and “country”: from the start, the founders of the movement had thought big, intending to progressively develop it into a large-scale organization.c)Emphasis on practical activities in the Archedia Clubs: anyone expecting long spiritual meditation sessions would have been rather surprised by the Lausanne Club’s activities. Its members placed a lot of importance on nutrition and organized cooking classes, workshops, etc. Although the Club had given up the idea of opening a vegetarian restaurant (too much of a commitment compared with the number of people willing to help out), one member was managing a health-food store in the heights of Lausanne. It had been created as a cooperative with the very active support of club members. This “practical” side was an explicit goal of the movement: “We are original in that we spread a Science of Concrete Life in the form of an initiatory spiritual teaching which can be applied to the Clubs’ practical projects (health, nutrition, education, cultural performances, etc.).” In fact, many spiritual seekers belong to esoteric organizations and apply different techniques, but in the end, very few change “in their everyday lives, their state of awareness and at the level of their being.” They discover new “ideas,” but “all these aspects ... remain at the level of their ‘heads’—they neither enter their ‘hearts’ nor are ‘integrated’ in their lives” (Roche de Coppens 1986: 4)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple12d)Social side of club life: the club members working together to open a health-food store provides a glimpse of a level of social interaction going beyond simply belonging to a cultural club. Each new member, in principle, had a sponsor; this further reinforced personal connections. One of the advantages of Archedia Club membership given at the 18 June informational meeting was the fact that a traveling member would no longer have to stay in hotels but could be accommodated by other members.At the end of June I decided to reveal the reasons for my participation to the club leaders I had met. This approach was well received and gave me the opportunity for even greater access, including the chance for a long private interview with Dr Jouret in December 1987. Of course, my sources have not been limited to the information coming from the Archedia Clubs themselves. I met some (occasionally very critical) outsiders who had followed certain stages in the development of the movement or Dr Jouret’s activities. I also met at least one former member. Nevertheless, it is diffi cult to reconstitute the early history of the Archedia Clubs. Much of the data is vague, even contradictory, from one informant to another, and I do not claim that the following information is complete: I will gratefully accept any corrections.2. The Archedian World and its HistoryIf my information is correct, the Archedian movement has its origins in both a series of Geneva-area spiritual groups and an attempt to recreate the Order of the Temple. In Saconnex d’Arve, in Geneva, there was a very attractive conference center called the Golden Way Foundation. When Luc Jouret arrived in Geneva in the early 1980s he was invited there to give several lectures for the Foundation (he had begun a career as a professional speaker in Belgium two years before). In 1983, Jouret spoke there for the Amenta Club (cf. La Suisse newspaper, 11 March 1983). Apparently, this club was international from the beginning, since that same year it also listed an address in Quebec, where Dr Jouret would also lecture. (During my fi eld investigation in 1987, I several times heard mention of a farm established by the movement in Canada. Swiss members would occasionally travel there to work.) In 1984, there were Amenta Clubs in Brittany, Angers and elsewhere. The Archedia Clubs seem to have been created that same year, but it is clear that they grew from a foundation that was already well developed even before Dr Jouret came onto the scene.The International Chivalric Order of the Solar Temple was also born in 1984. It was the fruit of the 1952 attempt to bring about the resurgence of the Order of the Temple in France; it began its present phase of activities at a meeting held in Switzerland on 21 March 1981 (cf. Delaforge 1987: 136–7). The date of 1952 is signifi cant if one takes into account that the Archedia Clubs willingly circulated"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Templars for the Age of Aquarius13writings and cassettes by Jacques Breyer, whose work was frequently alluded to. Jacques Breyer then lived in Arginy Castle (in Rhône) and belonged to the group at the origins of the foundation of the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (founded 12 June 1952), although he left it in 1964 (cf. Bayard 1989: 43). Undoubtedly this is where the 1952 Order of the Temple resurgence efforts (to which the International Chivalric Order of the Solar Temple alluded) had taken place—the “solar” reference confi rms this impression. Breyer is the author of a rather diffi cult work; his main book,Arcanes solaires; ou les secrets du Temple Solaire,1 was published in 1959 (cf. Destin, March 1960, p. 1665). We also fi nd an echo of his work in the journal LaVoix Solaire2 (founded in 1961), which often featured Jacques Breyer’s articles, all written in his very particular and rather hermetic style.The Renovated Order of the Temple—founded in 1968 with Julien Origas at its head—would follow in the tradition of the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple and.AMORC.3 (It is interesting to note that, according to Luc Jouret himself, several members of the Solar Tradition had come from AMORC.) Luc Jouret was said to have met Origas (who had also been to the Golden Way Foundation) for the fi rst time in a restaurant in Geneva. Jouret briefl y succeeded Origas as head of the Renovated Order of the Temple after the latter’s death, but the hostility of some members soon forced him to resign. As in any confl ict of this kind, severe accusations were made on both sides. In 1983 Luc Jouret joined the Renovated Order of the Temple, which was dissolved in the autumn of 1984. Its members received the fi rst four issues ofExcalibur, a journal being put out by Amenta at the time (it stopped publication in the summer of 1987).Clearly, the origins of the Archedian activities had a background that was much more complicated than Dr Jouret’s audiences could imagine. Especially striking is the interaction between the different groups. But it can be said that their core group, as it appeared in 1987, was composed mainly of:a) ex-members of the Renovated Order of the Temple;b) patients of Luc Jouret (from his homeopathic practice in Annemasse);c) people who had been to Luc Jouret’s lectures.Because of the large role played by Luc Jouret, one must examine his approach and message, such as they could be observed in 1987. I will deliberately emphasize in the following section the “spiritual” aspects of his approach, without attempting to cover the entirety of his discourse.1 Solar Mysteries or the Secrets of the Solar Temple. After 1995 new evidence surfaced. The author today is certainly less persuaded that secret services really had a signifi cant role in the event.

Dr Luc Jouret’s messageA Belgian citizen, Luc Jouret was born in Africa on 18 October 1947. He studied medicine at the Free University of Brussels, earning his doctorate in 1974. He then practiced general medicine for three years. After this, dissatisfi ed by traditional medicine, he began a “personal quest through all medical practices and made many trips all over the world,” synthesizing the practices into a medicine that “treats man in his totality.” One learned from Luc Jouret’s speeches that he lived in the Philippines from 1976 to 1977 and that he worked there with two or three well-known healers, acting “at the level of the energetic bodies of his patients.” In the second of a series of interviews broadcast in 1987 on Yvette Rielle’s program L’Eternel Présent4 (Radio Suisse Romande), Luc Jouret declared “for me, the Philippines was an environment to learn my profession,” and that it was an experience that led him to “return to the West to accept my evolution.” He said his travels were the chance for him “to integrate different human components.” But Luc Jouret’s experiences were not only medical in nature, he said: although his was a “non-religious education” and a “diffi cult youth”, he had had spiritual experiences at certain times:There were some transcendent experiences in my life, some experiences that made me directly experience a superior aspect of man—to which I had previously been blind ... (L’Eternel Présent, 1987, 1st episode)Dr Jouret acknowledges having been curious, having done multiple experiments, having gone to investigate many groups. He says, however, that he had not read much in the fi eld of spiritualism. But, in his mind, the homeopathic approach necessarily had to lead to other dimensions, he explained during the private interview I conducted with him in December 1987. “Perhaps medicine needs to have a dimension that is—why not?—sacerdotal” (Conference of 5–6 October 1987 in Lausanne).in all great civilizations we notice that doctors were always priests and vice-versa ... I am convinced...that a doctor who is not concerned with reintegrating himself into a dimension in which the spiritual is more important than the physical cannot understand his patient as such. And this is rather the tragedy of medicine today, not to denigrate its authentic value concerning what it has allowed as far as transformation of man, but it nevertheless still leads to a dead end ... because it refuses to integrate the spiritual man into the physical man, even though the spiritual has conditioned the physical ... . (L’Eternel Présent, 4th episode)The union of therapeutic and sacerdotal is key to understanding the philosophy that attracted Luc Jouret and several other doctors who ended up taking on the role of “spiritual guide” (even if they do not always defi ne their work in these terms). The simple fact of being a doctor confers an aura of credibility. And, particularly if the doctor insists on a “holistic” approach or integrates spiritual considerations into his work, he can easily fi nd himself slipping into a role similar to one that, in the 4 The Eternal Present, broadcast on Channel 2 of the Swiss National Radio."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Templars for the Age of Aquarius15past, a priest would have played for his congregation. This can happen even more easily when the doctor is already supposed to hold the answers to physical or even psychological problems: if he goes on to address other fundamental questions it is only a shifting or extension of his competence.It is ... a common observation in the literature about social infl uence and decision-making that relatively high-status, especially when based on technical expertise, can easily be used to gain deference in areas beyond the scope of actual competence. (Ofshe 1986: 186)In this particular case, the “sacerdotal” dimension that Luc Jouret insists upon perhaps manifests itself more concretely because, according to one participant, there are liturgical celebrations within the Templar branch, at least some of which include an “Essene rite.” On this subject, it is interesting to note that an “Essene rite” was already being practiced in the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (cf. Plume and Pasquini 1980: 338), the group that had resulted from the 1952 resurgence.Although Dr Jouret claims to be “one of the representatives [of the Temple resurgence] in the secular world” (Geneva, 13 October 1987) and that he is guided by Templar superiors (interview of 15 December 1987), he does not present himself as an initiate, but as a person mandated to take care of work in a precise sector. However, at the seminars he hosts, Jouret clearly brings his audience to believe that they belong to a small chosen circle, and that they can understand the meaning of events and world changes: no one is here by chance; the people present have come because they are ready to understand certain things. I met people at seminars in Switzerland who had come from Belgium, Nice, and Brittany simply to hear Jouret speak for one or two evenings.Like many others, the message propagated by Luc Jouret is intimately tied to the conviction that we are entering the Age of Aquarius: each astrological era is marked by a totally different rate of vibration; at the beginning of the Age of Aquarius we can no longer live with laws from two thousand years ago, a time when no scientifi c contributions had yet been made (Geneva, 5 October 1987). “If we do not consider tradition in light of scientifi c facts, it is useless; nothing can be learned from it. By the same token, if science does not incorporate tradition into its facts, it too is useless” (L’Eternel Présent, 3rd episode). We live in a period of fundamental transmutation: “We are in the reign of fi re, everything is being burned” (Geneva, 13 October 1987). Gigantic upheaval is on the way, “we are making a leap into what I call macro evolution” (L’Eternel Présent, 3rd episode). Luc Jouret feels that humanity is currently in a very sad state; that it “has completely slipped” (L’Eternel Présent, 5th episode). Humanity’s brutishness is all the more tragic as it is occurring at the moment in evolution when new abilities can awaken, when man should transform himself and make a leap:Our brains will undergo modifi cations, physical in the second phase, but certainly subtle and vibratory at fi rst, which will cause man (the ones who are able) to react completely, and in a different way to events. (L’Eternel Présent, 2nd episode)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple16For, despite all humanity’s deviations, “the worlds’ energetic contingencies are such that there is hope that a group of men and women will rise up to live the experience” (L’Eternel Présent, 2nd episode). In two lectures (in October 1987) on the topic “Templar tradition and the modern world,” Luc Jouret explained the nature and function of the Temple in a little more detail: it is the manifestation of a celestial archetype among men and will bring together men and women who are marked with the celestial seal and are willing to serve. Templars reappear during each phase of humanity’s development. The Temple is at the origin of all the great currents of awareness—even religious movements and Masonry.What then is the attitude toward religions? The tragedy of faith, Luc Jouret says, is that it isolates the Creator from His Creation, that it sees a God outside of us, even though according to mystic vision, “the Creator is fused with His Creation” (Lausanne, 5 October 1987). “... the essence of God is what makes things evolve ...” (L’Eternal Présent, 4th episode). Or, in other words: “My notion of God is that He is the essence of what makes all things happen” (Lausanne, 5 October 1987); “God cannot be defi ned in terms other than movement and evolution” (Lausanne, 6 October 1987).Luc Jouret makes frequent reference to Christ, as he does to Christianity in general: he has given talks on the Apocalypse (Lausanne, October 1987) and “Parables throughout the Gospels” (Geneva, November 1991). But it is clear that Luc Jouret’s interpretation is rather different from that of the Churches. Christ is presented as an initiate, as “a solar entity” (L’Eternal Présent, 5th episode). “All religions fall and have failed in their duty”; “the Vatican has certainly forgotten the primordial and basic teachings” (13–14 October 1987). Nevertheless, according to Dr Jouret, the Templar is fundamentally Christian. The Temple pursues seven core goals that we can attempt to summarize, according to Jouret, in the following ways:a) Reestablish knowledge of authority and power (power of the Spirit) in a period of dissolution;b)Affi rm the primacy of the spiritual over the temporal (one must pass through exaggerated materialism to rediscover the value of the mind);c)Make man aware of his dignity (pull him out of his brutishness, laziness, unhealthy eating, consumer mentality);d)Help humanity through its passage by being aware that we will live through a dissolution on a collective scale;e)Participate in the assumption of the Earth: the Templar is aware that the Earth is his surrogate mother, and Templars have always been devoted to their earthly mothers, represented by the Virgin; the universal Virgin gave birth to the universe; one of the Temple’s goals is to make the Earth sacred and preserve it."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Templars for the Age of Aquarius17f)Help unify the Churches (and reunite the three great religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam);g) The key objective is the return of Christ in solar glory.The essence of Luc Jouret’s message can be characterized by the word “unity”: awareness must be brought back to the original unity; a scattered awareness must be reassembled into a unitary awareness. The fi nal phase of the cycle is the “reunifi cation of awareness to Omega”. We pass through the disparity of life only so we can merge ourselves again into primordial unity. This “unitary” perspective indeed corresponds to an aspiration that is quite widespread in the world of alternative religiosity.ConclusionThe Archedia Clubs’ activities ceased in the summer of 1991, and a certain number of high-ranking members seem to have distanced themselves from the movement during this period. But the Solar Tradition branch still exists, and Dr Luc Jouret, who recently published a book in Canada (Jouret 1992), is pursuing his career as an international speaker under the auspices of Atlanta. The movement has seen changes, reorganizations, and departures, but one must not lose sight of the permanence behind the changing labels, nor let oneself be misled by their variety."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 2Ordeal by Fire: The Tragedy of the Solar Temple1Massimo IntrovigneOn 4 and 5 October 1994, fi fty-three people were found dead in Switzerland and in Canada.

The movement is part of one of several currents which as a whole compose the universe of the contemporary occult-esoteric movements, the neo-Templar tradition.

The Neo-Templar Tradition“Templar” Degrees within FreemasonryThe modern neo-Templar tradition is not a continuation of the Order of the Temple, a monastic-chivalric Catholic order founded in 1118–19 by Hugues de Payens (or Payns) and dissolved by Pope Clement V after the cruel persecution by Philip the Fair, King of France, in 1307. After its suppression, the order survived for a few decades outside of France, but by the beginning of the 15th century the Templars had totally vanished. The theory of a secret continuation of the order has been criticized 1 This paper was originally given in February 1995 as a report for associates and friends of the Centre for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR), Turin, Italy.2 Sources I found very useful include a dossier of Canadian press articles on the Solar Temple preceding the events of October 1994, compiled by Montreal’s Centre d’Information sur les Nouvelles Religions, as well as CESNUR’s collection of associated US, Swiss, and Canadian articles.

Its origins were too humble to be acceptable to the European nobles Freemasonry hoped to attract. The legend was thus formulated of persecuted knights fi nding a “hiding place” in the English and Scottish guilds of masons, where they could continue their activities. Especially in Germany, these mysterious knights were quickly identifi ed with the Templars. These are the origins of the Templar degrees of Freemasonry. They were created in continental Europe, but extended to the United Kingdom through the activities of Thomas Dunckerley (1724–95), who in 1791 founded the “Grand Conclave of Knights Templars” (later known as “Grand Priory of Knights Templars”) within English Freemasonry.5 “Templar” Masonic degrees are today found in both the Scottish and the York Rites, and originated from the present Encampments of Knights Templars, composed exclusively of Freemasons and widespread within Anglo-American Freemasonry.6The presence of Templar degrees in the great majority of Masonic rites and obediences found today throughout the world must be correctly interpreted, and there could be two different levels of interpretation. At a fi rst level, one could mention the idea of propagating a new organization such as Freemasonry through a captivating ritual, such as the one derived—with a lavish display of costumes and swords—from the chivalric world of medieval times. At a second level, dating from the 18th century, a tension was already developing within Freemasonry between a rationalistic “cool current” and a “warm current,” more interested in esotericism and the occult. Such tension not only divided each of the several obediences and lodges from the others, but also often existed within the same obediences where a lodge 3 Régine Pernoud, Les Templiers (Paris, 1988), p. 11. For more details, see Marco Tangheroni, “La leggenda templare massonica e la realtà storica”, in Introvigne (ed.), Massoneria e Religioni (Turin, 1994), pp. 63–78.4 For a detailed account of the matter, see René Le Forestier, La Franc-maconnerie templière et occultiste aux XVIIIe et XIXe siècles (Paris, 1987), vol. 2.5 See Frederick Smyth, Brethren in Chivalry: A Celebration of Two Hundred Years of the Great Priory of the United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of St. John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta of England and Wales and Provinces Overseas (London, 1991). According to Smyth it is possible that “Templar” Masonry reached Ireland even before England, maybe as early as the 1760s (p. 19). 6 See Massimo Introvigne, “Che cos’è la massoneria: il problema delle origini e le origini del problema”, in Introvigne, Massoneria e Religioni (Turin, 1994), pp. 13–62."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire21could easily include both rationalists and occultists.7 The Templar legend appealed, for different reasons, to both “cool” and “warm” currents. The “warm current” presented medieval Templars as esoteric magicians, keepers of occult secrets (in the wake of what today’s historians regard as libelous allegations of witchcraft generated by the propaganda spread by Philip the Fair in his desire to destroy the Templar order for economic and political reasons). The “cool current,” considered the Templars to be not only victims of tragic historic circumstances, but rebels against the French monarchy and the Roman Church (“against the Throne and the Altar,” according to the terminology of that time), and therefore predecessors of the Enlightenment protest and, later on, of the French Revolution. This consideration is once again false, if we consider the Templars’ real history, but represents an integral part of the myth surrounding them in the 18th century.The Origins of Independent Neo-TemplarismDuring the French Revolution—an especially complicated time in Masonic history—not everyone agreed with the assumption that the set of Templar degrees was only a part of the Masonic system, and that it was therefore to remain subordinated to Freemasonry as a whole and to its leadership (although today such an assumption is accepted in the majority of Masonic obediences and rites). The fi rst disagreements originated in the Lodge of the Knights of the Cross in Paris. There it was argued that, if the Templar legend is true and the British guilds of Freemasons are “interesting” only because they have offered, since the fourteenth century, a hiding place to the heirs of the Templar Order, then the Templar Order precedes Freemasonry, and the Masonic organizations must be subordinated to the (neo-)Templar ones and not vice versa. This controversy began with a Masonic adventurer active at the time of the French Revolution, a Paris physician called Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat (1773–1838). In 1804 he declared to have discovered—together with his colleagues of the above-mentioned Masonic Lodge of the Knights of the Cross in Paris—some documents proving the existence of an uninterrupted succession of Templar “Grand Masters,” operating secretly from the suppression of the order in 1307 to 1792 (when the last “hidden” Grand Master, Duke Louis Hercule Timoléon de Crossé-Brissac, died in Versailles, massacred by the Jacobins). With the French Revolution and the fall of the French monarchy, the Templars were now able to come into the open. In 1805 Fabré-Palaprat reconstructed the Templar Order, and proclaimed himself Grand Master. The idea of an autonomous Templar Order (independent of Freemasonry, unlike the Templar degrees) was generally well accepted in the occult subculture, and caught the interest of Napoleon himself, who authorized a solemn ceremony in 1808.87 See Introvigne, Il cappello del mago. I nuovi movimenti magici dallo spiritismo al satanismo (Milan, 1990).8 On Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, his Order of the Temple and the Johannite Church, see ibid., pp. 233–7; and—from a skeptical yet favourable viewpoint—the work of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple22In spite of Napoleon’s interest, the Catholic Church remained obviously hostile to neo-Templarism. Fabré-Palaprat called the Roman Church “a fallen church” and founded in its place an “esoteric,” so-called “Johannite” church, of which more later—due to his supposed prerogatives as Templar Grand Master—he consecrated as bishop the radical socialist and former Catholic priest Ferdinand-François Châtel (1795–1857). From the 1830s onwards the neo-Templar movement intertwines therefore with the “independent churches,” schismatic groups led by “bishops” claiming an irregular, but nevertheless “valid” consecration of more or less remote Catholic or Orthodox origins, due to the Catholic theory that the apostolic succession may validly continue also outside the Church of Rome as long as the consecrating bishop is a “real” (although schismatic or excommunicated) bishop and was in turn consecrated by a “valid” bishop. The intertwining still remains today, within certain limits, and often, wherever there is a neo-Templar order, we fi nd an “independent church” under the same leadership (and vice versa). There is no evidence that Luc Jouret, the co-founder of the Solar Temple, was consecrated as a bishop, but he was ordained a priest in one of the French “independent churches” and in this capacity occasionally celebrated what he called an “Essene ritual,” in fact a version of the Catholic Mass.In any case, Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat gave birth to a neo-Templarism independent of Freemasonry, though largely composed of “knights” who were at the same time Freemasons. Today the Templar knights and degrees within Freemasonry are found mostly in Anglo-Saxon countries, while Fabré-Palaprat’s autonomous neo-Templarism has remained largely confi ned to Latin countries.The Neo-Templar Movement from 1838 to 1970After Bemard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat’s death in 1838, the neo-Templars experienced their fi rst schism, dividing promoters and opponents of the ties between the Templar Order and the Johannite Church of Ferdinand-François Châtel. (The Johannite Church, the history of which is not part of this paper, continues to have heirs to this day, though not all of them are at the same time neo-Templars.) The two branches, led respectively by Count Jules de Moreton de Chabrillan and Admiral William Sydney Smith, reconciled in 1841 under the leadership of Jean-Marie Raoul. The Templar Order had, however, gone out of fashion and—in Masonic terminology— one of Raoul’s successors, A.M. Vernois, put it “to sleep” in 1871. Later on, the “regency” of the order was given by some surviving members to the poet Joséphin Péladan (1858–1918), who, however, was mainly interested in another order he himself created, the Order of the Catholic Rose-Croix of the Temple and the Grail. Those were the years of the occult revival of the late 19th century. The Templar Order, with dozens of other groups, ended in the great melting pot of occult orders operated by the strange bedfellows Joséphin Péladan and Papus (nom de the Gnostic Church’s bishop, Léonce Fabré Des Essarts, Les Hiérophantes.

In 1932 the Order of the Temple was legally incorporated by the Belgian group under the name of the Sovereign and Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (OSMTJ), having as its “Regent” Théodore Covias (the number of members was considered to be too small to nominate an actual “Grand Master”). The next Regent was Emile-Clément Vandenberg, elected in 1935. In 1942—in the midst of World War II—the Order of the Temple agreed to pass the regency on to a member residing in the neutral country of Portugal, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes, who secured for the neo-Templar movement a great international propagation, opening national “priories” in almost all Western countries.9 On the events mentioned here, see my Il cappello del mago, pp. 187–94.

The 1970 convention started a rather unclear connection tying neo-Templars, secret services, and European politics. The turn of events that brought on the election of Zdrojewski was in fact due to the massive enrolment in the Sovereign and Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem by members of Service d’Action Civique (SAC), a private French right-wing organization with ties to the Gaullist party: half-way between a private secret service and a parallel police. Right after the election, Zdrojewski nominated as his chargé de mission Charly Lascorz, an infl uential member of SAC. The OSMTJ’s headquarters were located on the same premises as Etudes Techniques et Commerciales (ETEC), a Paris corporation later exposed as a front for SAC. The OSMTJ, unsanctioned by any law—unlike the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, whose passports are recognized as valid by many countries—began issuing “diplomatic passports” in the name of the order, from which many members of SAC benefi ted. In 1972, the police—accusing ETEC of several irregularities, including possible collusions with organized crime—raided ETEC’S premises in Paris and put an end to its operations (seen by the press as a “cover” for SAC’s illegal activities). As a result of the raid, in 1973 Antoine Zdrojewski put the OSMTJ’s French Priory “to sleep”. The history of SAC ended with the murder of police inspector Jacques Massié (a local leader of SAC) and his family in Auriol, near Marseille, in 1981. This affair, one of the most obscure of recent French history, culminated in a court case, and in a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, which dissolved SAC in 1982. During the trial—held in Aix-en-Provence in 1985—Jacques Massié’s career within Antoine Zdrojewski’s OSMTJ was brought to light. Even after the OSMTJ’s offi cial dissolution in 1973, in fact, SAC members had kept alive the order’s activities, which included the traffi cking of OSMTJ passports and (according to press sources) an international traffi c of weapons (never fully proved) between the neo-Templars connected with SAC and the notorious Italian Masonic Lodge P2 headed by Licio Gelli (later also dissolved in Italy after a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry).12 On the events described in this paragraph and the next, I have based my considerations on personal interviews with members of the occult milieu in France, and on two books which include, along with interesting information, also obvious inaccuracies, and which must therefore be read cautiously: Arnaud Chaffanjon and Bertrand Galimard Flavigny, Ordres et Contre-ordres de Chevalerie (Paris, 1982)—which has as its main purpose the separation of the true chivalric orders of ancient and noble descent from counterfeits; and André Van Bosbeke (with Jean-Pierre De Staercke), Chevaliers du vingtième siècle.

Fernando Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes declared the election invalid and proclaimed himself as Regent, as his father’s successor, thus creating in almost every country at least two orders of the Temple (often sharing the same name, OMSTJ): one loyal to Sousa Fontes and one loyal to Zdrojewski. Especially important for the number of members and for international relations was the Swiss Great Priory, directed by Alfred Zappelli and recognized by Fernando Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes. When Antoine Zdrojewski left the stage in 1973, Alfred Zappelli tried to operate from Switzerland on an international scale, and to salvage what was left of Zdrojewski’s organization, establishing a French Priory dependent on the Swiss one. He then nominated as leader of the French Priory—according to press sources—Georges Michelon (also a member of SAC). At the time of the murder in Auriol, Antoine Zappelli issued a press release, clarifying that Jacques Massié had no part in his OSMTJ. During the same years Philip Guarino, an American political lobbyist, introduced himself as leader of an OSMTJ Priory in the USA. Philip Guarino was also—according to the Italian Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on the P2 Lodge—the American “correspondent” of Licio Gelli’s lodge. Perhaps it is for this reason that a fi le on the OSMTJ was found during one of the raids carried out by the Italian authorities at Licio Gelli’s villa in Arezzo. Many “fringe” and “irregular” Freemasons belonged to an Italian Grand Priory of the OSMTJ (established, as it seems, with Alfred Zappelli’s authorization) which had as bailli(local leader) Pasquale Gugliotta (himself a member of the P2 Lodge) and comprised, among others, Pietro Muscolo of Genoa and Luigi Savona of Turin—both leaders of “clandestine” Masonic fraternities and, according to the Parliamentary Commission, Masonic allies of Licio Gelli.13At this point however, the OSMTJ loyal to Sousa Fontes or Zappelli and the remainder of Antoine Zdrojewski’s OSMTJ were no longer the only two main characters of the neo-Templar scene. Almost everywhere, “independent’ orders had sprung up, which—when not claiming to be receiving direct messages channeled from medieval Templars from the spirit world—produced genealogical trees which usually included both Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat and Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes. It is perhaps also worth mentioning two branches stemming neither from Antoine Zdrojewski nor from Fernando Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes. The fi rst branch was established by a bizarre Spanish gentleman, Guillermo Grau, who—convinced that he was a descendant of the last Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II—began claiming, in the 1960s, the throne of Mexico under the name of Guillermo III de Grau-Moctezuma, granting (not for free) honors, chivalric tides and even university degrees from a (mail-order) “college” in his “kingdom.” At that time a student of esoteric lore, Antonia Lopez Soler asserted that the Templars, 13 This Grand Priory did not represent the fi rst Italian neo-Templar order. Since the nineteenth century there had been a few more, which later entered into the orbit of one of the main leaders of occult movements in Italy, Gastone Ventura (1906–81). See also his Templari e templarismo (Rome, 1984)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple26suppressed since 1307 all over Europe, had survived in Catalonia. The alleged Moctezuma enthusiastically espoused not only the theory, but also the student, changing Antonia Lopez Soler’s name to Countess Moctezuma and immediately proclaiming himself Grand Master of a Catalan Branch of the OSMTJ. The Catalan Branch, founded in the 1960s, began establishing priories all over the world in the 1970s, taking advantage of the confl ict between Fernando Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes and Antoine Zdrojewski.A second “independent” branch sprang from the mystical-esoteric experiences of Jacques Breyer, a member of the current most interested in esotericism in French Freemasonry. After these experiences, which he underwent in 1952 in the castle of Arginy, France, the French occultist came into contact with Maxime de Roquemaure, who claimed to be a descendant of a branch of the medieval Order of the Temple which had survived through the centuries not in Catalonia but in faraway Ethiopia. Breyer and de Roquemaure subsequently founded the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (OSTS). Some of the initial members of the OSTS founded one of the many French Masonic organizations, the National Grand Lodge of France “Opéra” (the history of which is outside the scope of this paper). The OSTS faced a crisis in 1964 following Breyer’s resignation, but was reorganized twice after that, in 1966 and 1973.14 Within this order appeared most persistently apocalyptic ideas on the end of the world and the glorious return of the “Solar Christ.”Julien Origas and the Renewed Order of the TempleThe more apocalyptic neo-Templar ideas caught also the interest of Julien Origas (1920–83), who frequented other occult orders as well—including the Saint Germain Foundation in Marseille (not to be confused with the Foundation of the same name in the USA, which constitutes the organizational structure of the new religious movement called I AM Religious Activity). The French Saint Germain Foundation was led by a certain “Angela” who claimed to be a reincarnation of Socrates and Elizabeth I of England, and at the same time the mother of the Count of Saint-Germain, the eighteenth-century French occultist who never died and is still active—according to ideas common to dozens of groups of theosophical origins—in the Grand Lodge of Agartha, composed of “Ascended Masters,” which secretly governs the world. Julien Origas was also a member of the world’s largest Rosicrucian organization, the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), founded in the United States by Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883–1939) and extremely successful in the French-speaking countries. It is in those same French-speaking countries, in fact, that AMORC tried, in the 1970s, to gain a sort of total control of the esoteric 14 See Jean-Pierre Bayard, La Guide des sociétés secrètes (Paris, 1989), p. 43; Chaffanjon and Galimard Flavigny, pp. 169–71. From the OSTS also descend other present-day orders, such as the Ordre des Veilleurs du Temple in France, with corresponding parallel organizations in other countries, which have nothing to do with the developments described in the next paragraph."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire27community. Due to widespread interest in Martinism, for example, in order to avoid AMORC members seeking Martinist experiences elsewhere, AMORC created its own Martinist order. Around 1970, Raymond Bernard, then “Legate” of AMORC for the French-speaking countries (today he has no more ties with AMORC, but in the meantime much has changed within the international Rosicrucian community), enthusiastically embraced Julien Origas’s idea of creating a Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT)—not to be confused with the similarly named Order of the Renewed Temple joined by famous esoterist René Guénon (1886–1951) at the beginning of the twentieth century.15Origas’s ORT may have offered the opportunity of keeping within AMORC fold members of the occult subculture interested in joining a neo-Templar group. It seems that the creation of the ORT was even confi rmed by the apparition of a mysterious “White Cardinal” to Raymond Bernard in Rome, and that, as a result of this event, Julien Origas was crowned “King of Jerusalem” with an actual crown. For several years before the coronation, Origas had been in contact with Alfred Zappelli, and their two groups (the ORT and the Swiss Branch of the OSMTJ) —without actually coming together— had developed some common ventures, even if some strong disagreements arose soon after.16 It seems that there was also a “Secret Order” (assembling important members of the ORT and several branches of the OSMTJ), unknown to the other members, within which were formulated ideas on the imminent end of the world and on the presence on Earth of living “Ascended Masters,” including Origas and “Angela,” the leader of the Saint Germain Foundation. Members of the “Secret Order” even offered prayers “to Angela and Julien” (Origas), both destined to assume a critical role in the soon-coming universal confl agration.Julien Origas, to say the least, did not receive good press coverage in France. Several journalists noticed his relations with neo-Nazi and White supremacist groups from half of Europe and (once again) with members of SAC. A few years later, his neo-Nazi ideas and his relations with the Saint Germain Foundation in Marseille caused his separation from AMORC. Julien Origas’s ORT continued to operate independently (undergoing, of course, several schisms), accepting ideas from Jacques Breyer’s OSTS and from “Angela” on the end of the world and on messages received directly from the Ascended Masters of the Grand Lodge of Agartha. After Julien Origas’s death in 1983, these ideas became even more odd. It was in 1981 that 15 On René Guénon’s Order of the Renewed Temple see my Il cappello del mago,pp. 237–8.16 Fernando Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes also tried to keep the OSMTJ’s priories free from ties with controversial groups, mainly fearing the loss of independence from Masonic organizations so greatly stressed by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat. During the second half of the 1980s a confl ict arose between the Portuguese Regent and Alfred Zappelli. The majority of the Swiss Grand Priory’s members accepted the authority of de Sousa Fontes and reorganized their priory in 1988, with Joseph Clerc as Prior. Joseph Clerc’s branch is still quite strong, while Albert Zappelli, old and in poor health, keeps only a handful of followers (author’s telephone interview with Joseph Clerc, 19 October 1994)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple28Luc Jouret, one of the main characters in the Solar Templar tragedy, fi rst contacted Origas’s ORT.Around 1980 all over the world there were over one hundred rival Templar orders. Today there are probably many more, and every large western city (in Italy as well as in other countries) hosts at least a couple of them. It would be a serious mistake—especially right after the October 1994 tragedy—to lump all of them together. They vary greatly, from apocalyptic associations to “cover groups” for espionage and political machinations, from organizations dealing with sex magic to others that are little more than clubs where one dresses as a Templar mainly to cultivate social and gastronomical interests (as happens in a couple of Italian organizations).II. Luc Jouret, Joseph Di Mambro and the Solar TempleLuc Jouret (1947–94) was born in Kikwit, Belgian Congo (present-day Zaire), to Belgian parents on 18 October 1947.17 Fear of violence against Belgian citizens at the time of decolonization persuaded his parents to settle back in their home country, where Luc enroled in the Department of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels. In the 1970s the Belgian police opened a fi le on Jouret as a member of a small communist group, the Walloon Communist Youth. In 1974 he graduated as a medical doctor. In 1976 he enlisted as a paratrooper and took part in the Kolwezi raid, which allowed Belgian troops to bring back home a group of fellow citizens threatened in Zaire. The prevailing ideas among paratroopers were diametrically opposed to Luc Jouret’s communism but, according to a former college mate, Marc Brunson, now a veterinarian, the young doctor asserted that, at the time, joining the paratroopers “seemed the best way to infi ltrate the Army with Communist ideas.”18After the military experience, his interests focused on alternative forms of medicine. He studied homeopathy and later became a registered homeopathic practitioner in France (in many French-speaking countries homeopathy is in fact regulated by law). In 1977 he had visited the Philippines (later he also reported visits to “China, Peru and India”) in order to study the techniques of local spiritualist healers. According to Jean-François Mayer, Jouret claimed—in a long interview he had with him in December 17 The only scholarly study on Luc Jouret and his activities, published before the tragedy, is Jean-François Mayer, “Des Templiers pour l’Ere du Verseau: les Clubs Archedia (1984–1991) et l’Ordre International Chevaleresque Tradition Solaire”, Mouvements Religieux,14/153 (1993): 2–10 (summed up in Mayer, Les Nouvelles voies spirituelles. Enquête sur la religiosité parallèle en Suisse (Lausanne, 1993), pp. 148–9). The Templar Tradition in the Age of Aquarius (Putney, VT, 1987), a curious book by Temple defector Gaetan Delaforge, argued that the Order of the Temple had indeed survived after the 14th century, keeping in its possession much occult knowledge, and that the International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition (that is, Jouret’s order) was its true and legitimate heir. The book was circulated in the occult-theosophical subculture, but it is obviously not a scholarly work.18 Post et al., p. 13."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire291987—that the experience in India was crucial in turning him to homeopathy, although he had been in contact with European homeopathic practitioners before.19For a short while he supposedly became a follower of guru Krishna Macharia. In the early 1980s he started a homeopathic practice in Annemasse, France, receiving clients also from nearby Switzerland. His success as a homeopath was remarkable. People came to him from as far as the other side of the Atlantic and, after a few years, Jouret had several practices in France, Switzerland and Canada.In the 1980s, Geneva and Montreal were perhaps the two cities with the greatest number of esoteric groups in the world. Besides continuing with his homeopathic practice, Luc Jouret also became a lecturer on naturopathy and ecological topics, active in the wider circuit of the French-speaking New Age movement. Around 1981, he established the Amenta Club, an organization managing his conferences (the name was later changed to Amenta—without “Club”—and then to Atlanta). He spoke in New Age bookstores (in France, Switzerland, Belgium and Canada) and in eclectic esoteric groups such as the Golden Way Foundation of Geneva (previously called La Pyramide). This had as its leader Joseph Di Mambro, 1924–94, who later became the co-founder—and largely the real leader—of the Solar Temple, while the Golden Way became, to all intents and purposes, the parent organization of the Atlanta, Amenta and later Archedia clubs and groups (see Chapter 1). In 1987, Jouret was able to be received as a paid “motivational speaker’ by two district offi ces of Hydro-Québec, the public hydroelectric utility of the Province of Quebec. Besides getting paid 5,400 Canadian dollars for conferences in the period 1987–89, he also recruited 15 executives and managers who later followed him to the end.Amenta was nothing but the outer shell of an actual “Chinese box” system. Those who most faithfully attended Jouret’s homeopathic practices and conferences were given an invitation to join a more confi dential, although not entirely secret, “inner circle”: the Archedia Clubs, established in 1984, in which one could already fi nd a defi nite ritual and an actual initiation ceremony, with a set of symbols taken from the Masonic–Templar efforts of Jacques Breyer (whose books—and one audiotape, according to Jean-François Mayer—were still being circulated). According to Canadian reporter Bill Marsden—who in 1994 interviewed some former members of the Solar Temple and whose fi ndings have been compiled by Susan Palmer in an unpublished manuscript she kindly sent to CESNUR—Breyer personally attended meetings of the International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition (OICTS) in Geneva in 1985: an ex-member described Origas, Breyer and Di Mambro as having been earlier “the three chums who spoke of esoteric things” in the fi rst Templar meetings he had attended in Geneva. Jean-François Mayer also notes that in 1987 Amenta organized a seminar on Breyer’s thought. The Archedia Clubs were not yet the truly inner part of Jouret’s organization. Their most trusted members were invited to join an even more “inner” circle, one that truly was a secret organization: the 19 Luc Jouret, Medécine et Conscience (Montreal, 1992), p. 4; letter from Jean-François Mayer to Massimo Introvigne, 14–15 December 1994.

The OICST can be considered both a schism and a continuation of Julien Origas’s ORT, which Jouret had joined in 1981 with the knowledge of only a few friends. Apparently former communist Luc Jouret and neo-Nazi Julien Origas understood each other very well, at least for a few months. After Origas’s death, Luc Jouret tried unsuccessfully to be recognized as the ORT’s leader, facing opposition from the founder’s daughter, Catherine Origas: hence the 1984 schism and the establishment of the OICTS. On the other hand, some of Luc Jouret’s co-workers in the Archedia Clubs, such as Joseph Di Mambro, co-founder of the OICTS, and Geneva businessman Albert Giacobino, had been members, according to press sources, of Alfred Zappelli’s Sovereign and Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem20 and possibly of AMORC. But according to Jouret’s most secret teachings, the schism that had given birth to the OICTS was not only the mere fruit of disagreements, but was instead according to the will of the Ascended Masters of the Grand Lodge of Agartha, who had revealed themselves in 1981 (before Julien Origas’s death) and had disclosed a “Plan” that was supposed to last 13 years, until the end of the world, predicted for the year 1994.Di Mambro’s and Jouret’s OICTS teachings stressed the occult-apocalyptic themes of Jacques Breyer’s OSTS and Julien Origas’s ORT, connecting three traditions on the end of the world: (a) the idea found in some (but by no means all) New Age groups of an impending ecological catastrophe (for instance, Jouret was very insistent about the lethal nature of modern diets and food); (b) some neo-Templar movements’ theory of a cosmic renovatio revealed by the Ascended Masters of the Grand Lodge of Agartha; (c) the political ideas of a fi nal international bagarrepropagated by survivalist groups both on the extreme right and on the extreme left of the political spectrum, with which Jouret had contacts in different countries. It seems that, in the years spanning from 1986 to 1993, Jouret and Di Mambro kept receiving “revelations” following Julien Origas’s tradition, especially of four “sacred objects”—the Holy Grail, the sword Excalibur, the Menorah, and the Ark of the Covenant—(“apparitions” of which, according to ex-members, were fabricated through electronic tricks and holograms), until it was revealed to them that between the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994 the Earth would have been forsaken by its last “guardians”: at fi rst six “entities” hidden in the Great Pyramid of Egypt, and later—but this could have been a metaphor used for a spiritual experience of three leaders of the Temple—three Ascended Masters who had received a revelation on the end of this cycle near Ayers Rock (now Uluru), Australia (a country in which the Temple had in the meantime established itself).20 This information is also denied by Joseph Clerc, Grand Prior of the Swiss OSMTJ loyal to Sousa Fontes, who states that Joseph Di Mambro had only casual relations with Alfred Zappelli, without ever becoming a fully fl edged member of the OSMTJ (author’s telephone interview with Joseph Clerc, 19 October 1994)."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire31Luc Jouret was able to keep up his speaking engagements on the New Age circuit as long as the existence of a secret order with peculiar ideas on the end of the world was well hidden behind the different Amenta, Atlanta, and Archedia groups and clubs. When some curious journalists and the unavoidable disgruntled ex-members started to talk about the Solar Temple, the doors shut. The Archedia Clubs dissolved in 1991, and various European New Age bookstores had by this time begun refusing to host Luc Jouret’s conferences. There remained, however, a solid operation in Canada, where Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro spent a great deal of their time from 1986 onward, and where they had founded a Club Archedia de Science et Tradition International. Under the Atlanta and Archedia Clubs’ labels, Luc Jouret could thus keep up his conferences—on topics such as The Sphinx, Christ, and the New Man—in Quebec (and it seems even at the University of Quebec at Montreal) in the years 1991 and 1992. Motivational classes were offered to companies under the aegis of an Académie pour la Recherche et la Connaissance des Hautes Sciences (ARCHS), whose literature was printed by Editions Atlanta. The “Chinese box” system continued in Canada, to where Solar Temple members from Switzerland, France and Martinique had also moved. According to the Marsden interviews compiled by Susan Palmer, ex-members claimed in 1994 that in 1991, 11 members of the Solar Temple were brought to Canada from Martinique in order to increase the French “female” energy in Quebec and further balance the English “male” energy there. The order’s headquarters were located in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, in a historic boarding school purchased on 26 October 1984 from the Catholic Brothers of the Sacred Heart, for 235,000 Canadian dollars. In the 1990s the house was the property of the Association pour l’Etude et la Recherche en Science de Vie Québec, and of the Société Agricole 81. In fact, “Science of Life” (Science de Vie) was often the topic of Luc Jouret’s conferences, as he blamed many of the world’s ills on today’s poor diet, suggesting as an alternative “naturally grown” products. The house in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade was also a center for the production of “natural” food products, partly marketed through an “ecological’ bread shop, the Boulangerie Aliments Naturels. Another Solar Temple center was established in 1992 in Saint-Sauveur, in a luxurious house on Rue Lafl eur, bought for 450,000 Canadian dollars. A PO Box address and a bank account were kept in Charlesbourg, another small Quebec town. In Morin Heights, a mountainous area, were the two villas which served as personal residences for Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro, with apartments for two other Temple leaders, Camille Pilet and Dominique Bellaton. Focusing on Canada and communal living meant a decrease in the number of devotees. In 1992–93 only the “hard core” of about one hundred members of the Solar Temple was left, as opposed to the international membership in the 1980s of about 200–300 people.On 8 March 1993, a crucial episode in the history of the Solar Temple occurred in Canada. Two Temple members, 54-year-old Jean Pierre Vinet, engineer and project manager for Hydro-Québec, and 45-year-old insurance broker Hermann Delorme, were arrested attempting to buy three semiautomatic guns with silencers, illegal weapons in Canada. Daniel Tougas, a police offi cer of Cowansville and a Temple member, was temporarily suspended from offi ce on charges of having helped the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple32two. On 9 March, Judge François Doyon of Montreal committed them to trial, freeing them on parole. Luc Jouret—who according to police reports asked the two to buy the weapons—was also committed to trial, and an arrest warrant was issued against him. (The Temple leader could not be found, as he was in Europe at the time.) The event drew the attention of the Canadian press to what newspapers called “the cult of the end of the world.” Rose-Marie Klaus, the estranged Swiss wife of one of the members, took advantage of the situation, calling for a press conference on 10 March, in which she denounced sex magic practices and the economic exploitation of members. On the same day, another press conference was held in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade. Sitting beside Jean-Marie Horn, President of the Association pour l’Etude et la Recherche en Science de Vie Québec, and Didier Quèze, Solar Temple spokesman, was the town’s mayor, Gilles Devault, who declared that the Temple “never caused any trouble” but, on the contrary, “contributed to the development of the community.” “A cult? ” Not at all, said the mayor, “Their children take part in the town’s amusements, they play hockey. Actually I believe that they are people that give a very positive contribution.”21Even the reporters most inclined to sensationalism could not fi nd any hostility between this Quebec town and the Solar Temple, and recounted that “residents of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade [who] met yesterday [10 March 1993] do not seem to have any grievances towards members of the Order.”22 Rose-Marie Klaus was considered an unreliable fanatic, and even the local parish priest, Father Maurice Cossette, admitted that, true, they were not Catholics, but he let them “advertise their conferences on nutrition and health on the church bulletin,” as long as they didn’t “talk about Apocalypse.”23 Later on, the Solar Temple’s lawyer, Jacques Rochelle, hinted of a “schism” that would have happened “more or less” in 1990, during which the Canadian members supposedly left Di Mambro and Jouret. Allegedly also Hermann Delorme and Jean-Pierre Vinet “had left the Order several months before” their arrest.24 It is unclear whether this information represented a simple attempt to sidetrack the investigations, or if tension within the Order of the Solar Temple actually existed. In any case, the offi cial leader of the Canadian Branch in March 1993, Robert Falardeau, head of a minor department at the Quebec Ministry of Finance, died in October 1994 with Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro.A few days after the arrests, the press started to reduce the intensity of its attacks on the Solar Temple, asking the police for clarifi cations. Police offi cials were then forced to reveal that the operations against the Solar Temple were not motivated simply by a desire to emulate their American colleagues at that time engaged in the siege of the Branch Davidians’ ranch in Waco, Texas. On 23 November 1992, a man 21 See Yves Boisvert, “L’Ordre du Temple Solaire n’a pas l’air de beaucoup déranger Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade”,La Presse (Montreal), 11 March 1993.22 Denis Bolduc, “Les membres de l’Ordre nient vouloir importer des armes”, LeJournal de Québec, 11 March 1993.23 Boisvert, “L’Ordre du Temple Solaire”.24 Norman Provencher, “L’Ordre du Temple Solaire se dit victime de diffamation”, LeSoleil, 12 March 1993; Martin Pelchat, “Jouret avait été ecarté de l’Ordre du temple solaire”, La Presse (Montreal), 18 March 1993."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire33identifying himself as “André” had phoned four Canadian members of parliament on behalf of a mysterious group, Q-37 (so called—according to “André”—because it had 37 members, all from Quebec), announcing the impending murder of Quebec’s Minister of the Interior, Claude Ryan, found “guilty” of adopting a political line too favorable to the claims of Native Americans. Reports by some informers—perhaps members of the Canadian intelligence services—to the Quebec police, stating that the group Q-37 was tied to the Solar Temple, prompted the investigations which culminated in the entrapment of two Temple members who tried to buy illegal weapons from a person who turned out to be a police agent. Police authorities had to admit, however, that in fi ve months of investigations they had not been able to fi nd any proof of ties between the Q-37 group and the Solar Temple (except for the Solar Temple’s hostility toward Native Americans, which came from Julien Origas’s White supremacist ideas). In fact, they could not even fi nd any proof that a Q-37 group actually existed. Since this was about all the information the Quebec police could offer (apart from a wire-tapping report relating how Luc Jouret advised a member of the group to practice shooting with a pistol—advice justifi ed by his lawyers because of the need for self-defense in the isolated Swiss centres), at the 30 June 1993 court proceedings in Montreal, Hermann Delorme and Jean-Pierre Vinet pleaded guilty only to having bought illegal weapons—justifi ed again by reasons of self-defense—and were freed with the local formula of “suspended acquittal”, with afi ne of 1,000 Canadian dollars each to be given to the Red Cross. Judge Jean-Pierre Bonin justifi ed the decision, stating that [the accused] have until now been victims of biases and bigotry which have become tremendously widespread through this event’s coverage; they have been regarded as members of a cult, and cults were not very popular in the media at the time of these events, especially due to the incident in Waco.25On 15 July—discreetly and without the previous knowledge of the media—Luc Jouret returned to Montreal to answer in court the same accusations and to obtain his own “suspended acquittal”—under the same conditions as Hermann Delorme and Jean-Pierre Vinet. Meanwhile, in Quebec, three institutions were concerned about connections their offi cers and employees had with a “cult”: the police (which had convicted offi cer Daniel Tougas, paroled him and expeled him from its ranks); Hydro-Québec (which nominated an investigation commission that verifi ed how 22 employees had participated in the activities of the Solar Temple and 15 were actual members of it, advising Hydro-Québec to refrain in the future from hosting occult-religious “motivational” conferences), and the Ministry of Finance (which sent Chief of Department Robert Falardeau on leave for one week, then let him slip quietly back into offi ce). The tempest seemed to end smoothly, even if on 17 March 1994, a letter signed “Order of the Solar Temple” was found in Montreal, in which the order claimed responsibility for an attack against a Hydro-Québec tower in Saint-Basile-25 Richard Hetu and Martin Pelchat, “Le Juge absout deux ex-membres de l’Ordre du temple solaire”, La Presse, 8 July 1993."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple34Le-Grand on 24 February. The police questioned the authenticity of the letter as it mentioned only the Saint-Basile-Le-Grand attack and not another one committed the same day against a Hydro-Québec installation in the Native American reserve of Kahnawake but kept secret by the authorities (which, however, had obviously been known to the attackers).26The Canadian incident later appeared to be extremely signifi cant in the fi nal crisis of the Solar Temple.III. The TragedyIt will take months, perhaps years, to fi nd out exactly how the events developed during the fi rst week of October 1994. The most essential information has been extensively covered in the world media. On 30 September, nine people, including Luc Jouret, had dinner at the Bonivard Hotel in Veytaux (in the Vaud canton, Switzerland). On 3 October, Joseph Di Mambro was seen having lunch with others at the Saint-Christophe Restaurant in Bex (same canton). On 4 October a fi re destroyed Joseph Di Mambro’s villa in Morin Heights, Canada. Among the ruins, the police found fi ve charred bodies, one of which was a child’s. At least three of these people seemed to have been stabbed to death before the fi re. In Salvan (Valais canton, Switzerland), Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro asked a blacksmith to change the lock in their chalet, and bought several plastic bags. On 5 October, at 1:00 a.m., afi re started in one of the centers of the Solar Temple in Switzerland, the Ferme des Rochettes, near Cheiry, in the canton of Fribourg—which was also a center for natural agriculture—owned by Albert Giacobino, who, as mentioned earlier, was an associate of Joseph Di Mambro in several esoteric and neo-Templar activities. The police found 23 bodies, one of which was a child’s, in a room converted into a temple. Among the corpses was Albert Giacobino’s. Some of the victims were killed by gunshots, while many others were found with their heads inside plastic bags. The same day, at 3:00 a.m., three chalets inhabited by members of the Solar Temple caught fi re almost simultaneously at Les Granges-sur-Salvan, in the Valais canton. In the charred remains were found 25 bodies, along with remainders of devices programmed to start the fi res (such devices were also found at Morin Heights and at Cheiry), and the pistol which shot the 52 bullets destined for the people found dead in Cheiry. On 6 October, Swiss historian Jean-François Mayer, secretary of the International Committee of CESNUR (Center for Studies on New Religions)—the scholar who in 1987 had conducted a participant observation of the Archedia Clubs—received a package mailed from Geneva on 5 October (in the space for the sender it said simply ”D.part,” meaning “departure” in French). The package included four documents summing up the ideology of the Solar Temple and explaining what had happened that night, together with an article extracted from theAmerican Executive Intelligence Review as republished in Nexus on the Randy 26 See Bernard Plante, “L’Ordre du temple solaire serait impliqué”, Le Devoir, 18 March 1994."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire35Weaver incident.27 Other copies of the package, or parts of it, were also sent to some Swiss newspapers. On 8 October, in Aubignan, France, the police discovered, in a building owned by a member of the Solar Temple, a deactivated device which could have burned down the house, similar to the ones found in Switzerland and Canada. On 9 October, the French Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua, received in Paris the passports of Joseph Di Mambro and his wife Jocelyne (both already identifi ed among the victims of the Swiss fi re). The sender’s name on the envelope was that of a “Tran Sit Corp.” in Zurich. Canadian television announced the same day that, according to their investigations, Joseph Di Mambro used the Solar Temple as a cover for weapons smuggling and for money-laundering, and had huge bank funds in Australia. The fi gures allegedly involved in this traffi c (millions of dollars), which supposedly corresponded with those of the Australian bank account, were however drastically reduced by the Swiss prosecutors. On 13 October, the Swiss police stated that, among the charred bodies they had identifi ed without a doubt that of Luc Jouret (whom many thought had escaped), and to have recognized Patrick Vuarnet (a young member of the Solar Temple and son of former Olympic ski champion and president of a multinational fashion fi rm, Jean Vuarnet) as the “mailman” who had sent the documents to Jean-François Mayer and the passports to French Minister Charles Pasqua following instructions from Joseph Di Mambro.IV. Elements for an InterpretationSuicide and/or murder? We can fi nd some answers—if we know how to search for them beyond the esoteric jargon and without barring the possibility that they could also include some information aimed at sidetracking—in the four documents sent to Jean-François Mayer (whom we thank for passing them on to the CESNUR network promptly). The explanation includes a suicide and two types of murder. According to the documents, some especially advanced members of the order are able to understand that—as the cycle started by the Grand Lodge of Sirius or of Agartha in 1981 is completed—it is time to move on to a superior stage of life. It is “not a suicide in the human sense of the term,” but a deposition of their human bodies to receive immediately new invisible, glorious and “solar” ones. With these new bodies, they now operate in another dimension, unknown to the uninitiated, presiding over the dissolution of the world and waiting for an esoteric “redintegratio.”There is also another class of less advanced members of the Solar Temple who cannot understand that in order to take on the “solar body” one must “depose” the mortal one. The documents imply that these members must be helped to perform their “transition” (in other words, must be “helped” to die) in the least violent way possible. Lastly, the documents state that within the Temple’s membership were also found backsliders and traitors, actively helping the arch enemies of the Solar 27 In this incident in Idaho in the 1990s the FBI surrounded the home of a white separatist, Randy Weaver.

To them the documents promise “just retribution” (in other words, murder, without the cautions used with the less advanced members). According to a survivor, Thierry Huguenin—whose last-minute escape was apparently responsible for reducing the casualties to 53—Jouret and Di Mambro had planned that exactly 54 victims should die in order to secure an immediate magical contact with the spirits of 54 Templars burned at the stake in the fourteenth century.28This scenario may seem consistent with the different ways in which the victims in Switzerland and in Canada died, and with the results of the investigations, which seem to indicate that the murders in Morin Heights and Cheiry were carried out by two members of the Temple, Joel Egger and Dominique Bellaton (a manicurist-turned socialite through a sequel of love affairs with businessmen, well known in Geneva and in the ski resort of Avoriaz), who later joined the other leaders in the suicidal act in Les Granges-sur-Salvan. In Morin Heights two Swiss members, Colette and Gerry Genoud, may have committed suicide, while Antonio and Nicky Dutoit were savagely murdered with their three-month-old son Emmanuel. According to the Quebec police report of November 1994, the Dutoits were also included in the traitors’ list because they had named their son Emmanuel. The report argues that Di Mambro’s daughter Emmanuelle—whom Nicky Dutoit had been babysitting and whose mother was Dominique Bellaton—was regarded as the “cosmic child,” an exalted being with a precious future. By calling their son Emmanuel the Dutoits had usurped the unique position of Emmanuelle Di Mambro, the “cosmic child,” and had in fact transformed their baby son into the Antichrist. Hence, according to the Quebec police, the particularly elaborate ritual used for killing baby Emmanuel Dutoit and his parents.On the other hand, there seems to be a contradiction between the fi rst three documents and the fourth one. From the fi rst three documents it seems that the tragedy was prearranged, as part of the Grand Lodge of Sirius’s “Plan,” and as a preparation for the end of the world, which is at any rate impending for all humanity. The fourth document—on a more “political” note—presents the suicide as an act of protest against persecution by the government of Quebec, which the document accuses of “mass murder,” fi nding a parallel with the activities of the US authorities in Waco and with other episodes of violent repression of new religious movements by police or government authorities. Perhaps the contradiction is only apparent if we interpret the Canadian incidents of 1993 as the instigating force leading to the fi nal stage of an apocalyptic itinerary which actually began a long time ago. The Quebec police report of November 1994 claims that, although no evidence of weapon traffi cking by the Solar Temple exists to date, the police action taken in 1993 in fact prevented a mass suicide-cum-homicide taking place in Saint-Sauveur, Canada, at least one year before the October 1994 tragedy, and may thus have saved some lives.28 The story of a survivor (with true names hiding behind pseudonyms) is told by Thierry Huguenin, Le 54e (Paris, 1995)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Ordeal by Fire37After the tragedy of October 1994, a faulty interpretation spread widely among the international press, and most probably among the general public. The Solar Temple incident was compared to earlier events—from Jonestown, Guyana to Waco—and was simply blamed, once more, on the “danger of the cults.” Sociologically speaking, however, one can immediately notice a difference. The victims of Jonestown and Waco (two events which are already very different from one another) all belonged to low economic strata (unemployed young people, unskilled workers, low-salary employees facing diffi culties), as is the case with the members of many Christian-apocalyptic (or, in the case of Jonestown, political-apocalyptic) new religious movements. If we run through the list of the identifi ed victims of the Swiss fi res, we immediately notice a different picture. It is perhaps enough to read the names of the victims (some of whom we have already mentioned): Robert Falardeau, chief of a department of the Ministry of Finance of Quebec; Joyce-Lyne Grand’Maison, a reporter for the daily Journal de Québec, who worked for eight years as contributing editor for the fi nancial page; Camille Pilet, recently retired as international sales manager of the Swiss multinational watch corporation Piaget (who was in the process of launching his own brand of designer watches); Robert Ostiguy, mayor of Richelieu, Quebec; Albert Giacobino, businessman in Geneva. For a sociologist, this is not a typical list of members of a “cult” or a new religious movement. The media comparisons with the Jehovah’s Witnesses or The Family could be humorous if we were not talking about a tragedy. The high-ranking government offi cer, the fi nancial reporter, the multinational manager, the mayor are all types of people one expects to fi nd enlisted not in a new religious movement, but rather in a club or fraternity. The anticult movements have tried to exploit the Solar Temple tragedy to attack the “cults” in general and to launch campaigns against The Family, Scientology and even Jehovah’s Witnesses or Hare Krishnas, which are, on the contrary, religious movements and must be carefully distinguished—from a sociological and doctrinal viewpoint—from occult-esoteric groups such as the Solar Temple. As Jean-François Mayer has noted, the structure of the Solar Temple may recall, for some, features of new religious movements. On the other hand, as I have argued elsewhere, “new magical movements” share some external features with new religious movements but should not be confused with the latter since the experience they offer is inherently different.29 Even the expectation of the end of this world by Christian-based groups, such as The Family or the Jehovah’s Witnesses (as well as by millions of pre-millennialists in the evangelical Protestant world), does not resemble the expectation of destruction and of magical reconstruction of the members’ and of the world’s 29 Letter from Jean-François Mayer to Massimo Introvigne, 14–15 December 1994. For the differences between new magical movements (NMMs) and new religious movements (NRMs) see my Il cappello del mago. This difference—and the category of NMMs—has been acknowledged in a paper on NRMs by the Roman Catholic Church, the general report of Francis Cardinal Arinze at the Extraordinary Consistory of 1991, and is implied in Raphaël Aubert and Carl A. Keller, Vie et mort de l’Ordre du Temple Solaire (Vevey, 1994)."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple38destiny, as found in the magical-esoterical views of the Solar Temple and similar groups.An acceptable interpretation of the Solar Temple tragedy must be reached on two levels, which are not mutually exclusive. The fi rst level must necessarily consider the odd intrigues between secret services, more or less “deviant” clandestine lodges and Templar organizations in recent neo-Templar history. Both the elderly Joseph Di Mambro and the younger Luc Jouret took part in orders such as Julien Origas’s Renewed Order of the Temple, and the Sovereign and Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (in several of their controversial branches, not to be confused with others with similar or even the same names) long enough to enter into the orbit of infl uence of groups whose ties with the French SAC, with the Italian P2 Lodge and with several countries’ secret services seem probable in view of court and parliamentary fi ndings. The fact that Joseph Di Mambro’s and his wife’s passports were sent to French Minister Charles Pasqua—who, according to the French media, was once linked to SAC—is, in this context, a strange coincidence (or perhaps a warning). Even more puzzling is the way some information of yet unclear origins provoked the Quebec police to attack the Solar Temple in 1993, thus exacerbating its apocalyptic fears.The second level, referring to grounds more familiar to sociologists than the world—certainly more obscure to them—of secret services and political intrigues, takes into consideration the specifi c nature of the apocalyptic current within the magical-esoteric universe. The vision of a “renovatio,” or a total renewal of the world—which frequently adopts as its symbols fi re and death—is typical of an occult tradition which, though a minority trend in the world of magical-esoteric groups, seems to be growing in importance at the end of the second millennium. This occult tradition—which, unlike the new religious movements, appeals mostly to middle-aged people from a good social background who generally elude to Christian beliefs and religion in their traditional meanings—usually maintains a metaphorical relation with the symbols of fi re and death and, more generally speaking, with the idea of the destruction of the present world. The Solar Temple episode, however, proves that it is not impossible for small, fringe sections of the apocalyptic current within the magical-esoteric milieu to live the ideology of destruction to tragic and extreme consequences."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 3Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple1Susan J. PalmerBased on research conducted in Quebec, this study explores the shape of the social life, apocalyptic ideology and authority structure of l’Ordre du Temple Solaire (OTS) or Solar Temple within the framework of Mary Douglas’s typology of “group and grid.” The pollution fears and purity rituals of this controversial new religious movement are analyzed as an important factor in their decision to orchestrate a religiously motivated mass suicide/homicide, explained in their suicide documents as a “transit” (a magical feat of soul travel) to the star Sirius. Douglas’s insights into how the human body becomes a “natural symbol” for small, persecuted groups, mirroring the social body and the vulnerability of its exits and entrances vis-à-vis the surrounding culture, are applied to the alternative patterns of sexuality and parenting in the OTS. It is suggested that the magical aspect of the mass suicide expressed a concern for purity and for protecting the boundaries of their community. It is also suggested that the ritual homicides in Morin Heights resemble the “witch-hunts” characteristic of Douglas’s “small society” that conceives of itself as the perfect, impermeable vessel.IntroductionOn 4 and 5 October 1994, 53 people suffered a violent death, all of them members (or former members) of a magical-esoteric religion, l’Ordre du Temple Solaire (OTS), also known as the Solar Temple. This ritual mass suicide/homicide was staged using bombs and other incendiary devices in three locations—Quebec in Canada, and in Cheiry and Salvan in Switzerland. Most of the Templars were drugged and shot before the fi res exploded.A set of four “suicide” letters (the “Testaments”) were distributed to Swiss scholar Jean-François Mayer and to selected newspapers. These explained the group’s “otherwordly” rationale for dying en masse as a “transit to Sirius” or magical feat of soul travel, empowering members to assume their glorious “solar bodies” on the star Sirius. The media and police continued, nevertheless, to investigate the OTS as a criminal organization suspected of money-laundering and international arms smuggling. Anticult offi cials made facile comparisons between OTS’s charismatic 1 This chapter originally appeared in the Journal of Contemporary Religion, 11/3 (1996): 303–18."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple40recruiter, Luc Jouret, and David Koresh. The real charismatic leader, however, was soon identifi ed by the Swiss police in November 1994, as Joseph Di Mambro, the 70-year-old Grand Master in Switzerland.The Sûreté du Québec then closed the case, but the Swiss delayed until 3 April 1996 before reporting the results of the inquest. Swiss magistrate André Piller sorted the dead into the three categories already laid out in the “Testaments,” but gave them numbers: 15 true suicides, he claimed, were committed by the core group who called themselves “the Awakened”; 30 members, “the Immortals,” were trapped unwittingly in a ritual “suicide” through sedatives and bullets in the head; and seven “traitors” were executed. The magistrate identifi ed the perpetrators of these crimes as Di Mambro and his appointed executioners, and called it “a long-planned apocalypse” (Globe and Mail, 4 April 1996: AI).Many secrets remain hidden, and the meaning of this esoteric religion’s violent act is still obscure. For scholars, the aftermath of a sensational “cult mass suicide” presents an uninviting research fi eld. Impediments to data collection are many and include the vows of secrecy required of Templars, the legally privileged nature of much of the evidence, and the stigma borne by the “survivors” who are understandably reluctant to be identifi ed. The OTS was a secret society, and only the leaders were privy to its revisions in prophecy and decision-making procedures that contributed to their fi nal morbid choice. Many false or unverifi able trails have been laid: second-hand testimonies are traded by journalists, ghost-written apostate memoirs are in progress and conspiracy theories abound.2One docudrama is focusing on the (alleged) connections of the OTS with the Mafi a and P2 terrorists; another documentary extrapolates on the notion that Luc Jouret lives(!)3 A local Templar suggested that the murders in Morin Heights were perpetrated by the CIA to cover up President Carter’s dirty deal with a delegation of extraterrestrials who built a subterranean laboratory in the Nevada desert. Another has argued that the original magical suicide had been desecrated by the Sûreté du Québec who rearranged the evidence to frame OTS leaders as murderers.4While formulating a moral to the tragedy of l’Ordre du Temple Solaire is beyond the scope of this study, it is possible to derive some insights into how the very shape of this small society may have contributed to the tragedy. The essay in hermeneutics that follows makes use of the theories developed by Mary Douglas (1966, 1973). I propose that her theories are useful for analyzing the internal factors and external 2 Through trading data over the telephone, I became aware of a fi erce competition between the French and anglophone newspapers (“It’s a French sect!”) and of journalists claiming a national treasure (“It’s a Quebec suicide—those American journalists will steal our story and sell it to Hollywood!”).

It is diffi cult to determine whether these theories are idiosyncratic or collectively held beliefs."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple41pressures that helped rationalize the core group’s decision to resort to “magical” violence.Douglas makes two points that are useful for this undertaking: fi rst, that the human body is conceptualized as a set of symbols by its particular society. In small, persecuted minority groups, she notes, the perceived and/or actual threat to the social body tends to be acted out in purity rituals that govern the exits and entrances of the human body, and reorder its viscous bodily fl uids, thereby enhancing the collective’s social control over the individual (Douglas 1966). This serves the vital function of preventing the tribe’s assimilation into the larger, surrounding society. Douglas then addresses the task of fi nding “some relation between cosmological ideas and characteristics of social relationships” (Douglas 1973: 84) and proposes a four-part typology for analyzing societies, based on the variables of grid (the clarity of a group’s meaning system) and group (a society’s degree of social cohesion and control) as a tool for measuring the strength/weakness of various societies’ belief systems and collective identities.Douglas describes the “strong group, weak grid” type as a claustrophobic, paranoid society: The members know each other and can count their ranks, hemmed ... in with intrigue and jealousy ... contradictory rewards and ... impossible goals. .... They put immense pressure on each other and strive incessantly to defi ne and close their circle of friends. (1973: 88)Where social control is strong, but the belief system is weak, she argues, we tend to fi nd “a dualistic cosmology that reckons with the power of demons and their allies; justice is not seen to prevail” (Douglas 1973: 91). L’Ordre du Temple Solaire fi ts this category, for it was a society that exerted powerful pressure on individuals, but had a rather vague and confusing classifi cation system.In a manner similar to the ancient gnostic schools, the OTS lacked a normative theology, but used the interpretive method of allegory and symbolism to refi ne its own ideas under the cloak of existing traditional traditions (Rudolph 1987: 54). This method of “protest exegesis” has been denounced by heresiologists as parasitical, but has been vaunted for its psychological sophistication by students of mysticism like C.G. Jung. Thus, while OTS theology contains the abstract of gnostic tenets (Jonas 1963: 42), it was highly eclectic. Members dabbled in occult subjects ranging from Rosicrucianism to Egyptian thanatology to Luc Jouret’s oriental folk medicine and ecological apocalypticism. Experts in various schools of the occult, like the astrologer Marilou Saint-Aignan, and the Jungian alchemist and orchestral conductor Michel Tabachnik, were periodically invited to give workshops. There was no coherent syncretizing curriculum, and the approach to gnosiswas experiential. Mists of tasteful hermeneutics carefully obscured the more striking doctrines, such as reincarnation and the tutelary presence of a White Brotherhood. This aesthetic, elitist and “unfundamentalist” approach seemed to attract a clientèle of predominantly middle-aged, prosperous and highly cultured professionals."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple42History and Social OrganizationIntrovigne states that the OTS is but one atypical example of the magical-esoteric movement known as the Knights Templar. He notes that “around 1980 there were over one hundred rival Templar orders worldwide ... from apocalyptic associations to cover groups for espionage ... from ... sex magic to ... clubs where one dresses as a Templar mostly to cultivate ... social and gastronomic interests” (Introvigne 1995a: 273).Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro were established Grand Masters in the Knights Templar tradition and had collaborated in organizing workshops since 1976. In 1984 they entered into a more formal relationship by establishing l’Ordre International Chevaleresque de Tradition Solaire (OICTS) in Geneva, from whence the OTS emerged. Di Mambro, born in 1924, was trained in the Rosicrucian tradition (AMORC), and became leader of La Pyramide which became later, in 1974, the Golden Way in Geneva. A man of romantic and expensive tastes, he was fascinated by ancient Egyptian mythology, loved the opera and claimed to be an adept in sex magic.Jouret became their star speaker, and brought charismatic claims and gifts of his own to the Order. Born in the Belgian Congo in 1947, he was a successful homeopathic doctor with practices in Switzerland and Quebec. He organized over 200 conferences in France and Quebec to communicate his broad interests in alternative medicine. In 1983 he joined l’Ordre Renové du Temple (ORT) and, when its founder Julien Origas died, he briefl y assumed the leadership, but was expelled by Origas’s daughter Catherine, after a struggle over the leadership and funds. He then formed a schismatic group with 30 ORT Templars, and became their Grand Master, opening branches in Martinique and Quebec (Mayer 1993). A series of public organizations orbited around the OTS functioning rather like “Chinese boxes” (Mayer 1993; Introvigne 1995a). The Clubs Amenta offered seminars on health and natural foods, and the Clubs Atlanta and Archedia were a forum for Luc Jouret’s recruiting and fundraising talents. Gifted and committed members would be invited to join the inner circle of the OTS. It was hierarchical and involved three levels of initiation. Frères du Parvis, Chevaliers de l’Alliance and Frères des Temps Anciens, (Mayer 1993).Jacques Breyer, French esoteric author and founder of the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple in 1952, was a spiritual mentor and a strong presence in the Swiss OTS. One Quebec member who met him in Switzerland in 1985 described him as “un gentilhomme désaxé” (eccentric) and recalled seeing Breyer, Julien Origas and Di Mambro, as “the constant threesome” who hung out together at the Geneva temple in the early days: “the three chums who spoke of esoteric things.”5The treasurer of the order was Camille Pilet (1926–94), a wealthy corporate manager for Piaget and former member of AMORC. The main administrators were 5 William Marsden of the Montréal Gazette conducted this interview."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple43Di Mambro’s wife Jocelyne, his former mistress, Odile Dancet, and his old friend, Françoise Belanger (Introvigne, Chapter 2 this volume; Centre Roger Ikor, 1995)The order was small, numbering between 300 and 400 core members at its peak. Extraordinary demands were placed on core members, but there were varying levels of involvement, and most remained on the fringes of the group without making undue sacrifi ces. In Quebec, members donated as little as $90 per month, although others contributed $350.6 A commune was established in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec, which demanded a high investment of money and voluntary labor to operate their businesses: the bakery, gardening, farm, the school, a printing press and administrative work.The OTS offered members a spiritual path, elegant social gatherings, occult study sessions, personal counseling and therapeutic work. There was a high attrition rate in the outer clubs, but initiation into the OTS required vows of secrecy, and apostate Rosemary Klaus claims that death threats were directed toward potential defectors—probably an exaggerated reading of the dire consequences of betrayal implied in the ritual vows of secrecy. Paradoxically, a high value was placed (at least in theory) on individualism and free choice.The OTS evolved an elaborate ritual life that drew upon traditional esoteric symbols, but made use of modern technology—and possibly hallucinogenic drugs—to enhance the individual’s experience.7 Ceremonies were held in medieval robes under the full moon. The epiphany that formed the climax of the ritual at the underground Sanctuaire at Salvan was a hologram of the Holy Grail. Lasers, slides, sound and lighting effects were employed to create illusions of the Masters of the White Brotherhood, lightning storms, divine music and gold dust. These devices were a secret shared by a select core group, and served to bolster Joseph Di Mambro’s charismatic claims and the belief in the tutelary presence of the White Brotherhood.The Geneva Templars would occasionally stage operas: members would dress up as characters, make the sets, hold lengthy rehearsals, and perform the works of Wagner, Verdi or Puccini, miming the arias to CDs playing in the background, complete with dramatic gestures. These performances would be videotaped. Joseph Di Mambro and his circle once fl ew to Manhattan for the weekend to attend an opera at the Met.8LeadershipAuthority patterns in the OTS were unspecifi ed and constantly shifting. Formal offi ces were established – president, secretary, treasurer – but members interviewed 6 William Marsden of the Montréal Gazette provided this information.7 One member claimed they drank coffee before entering the Temple and was convinced it contained some mind-altering substance.8 Peter Pearson’s researchers for his docudrama collected this story."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple44stressed the notion of the communion of souls and denied that there was a hierarchical model. One Templar claimed:I was the leader, anyone could be the leader. You know the planets? Some are close to the sun, Mercury is the closest, and some are further out. ... And yet each planet has their fi xed course, and it was like that with us. Everyone has a role to play, we are all important.9The OTS as a social organization corresponds to the “body politic” of a “small group” that tends to have a clear external boundary, but a confused internal state in which “envy and favouritism fl ourish and continually confound the proper expectations of members.” Joseph Di Mambro would tell a member that he (the member) was the reincarnation of one of the Apostles. The very next day he would say, “I was mistaken, it is not you, it is him,” indicating another member. He would invite certain people into the inner sanctum to watch the light and sound illusion. They would come out reporting, “It was marvellous! I can’t tell you what I saw!” The next time they would be excluded and others would be invited.10There is considerable disagreement concerning Luc Jouret’s authority in the group. Some felt he was appointed as Di Mambro’s successor, but Huguenin (1995) claims that he was appointed, and insists that Jouret was “just like us.”11 Others offered testimonials to Jouret’s extraordinary charisma. Former Rosicrucians from AMORC say they joined the OTS because Jouret “captivated” them in his speeches. One man said, “He put his fi nger on my forehead and I experienced an energy, a sharing of knowledge! Afterwards I felt relaxed and joyful.” A woman recalled, “At one point Jouret looked at me. It was like his third eye penetrated my body. It was a loving sensation of kindness. Then he crossed his arms, cut the spell and went on to the next person.”12Rosemary Klaus, a hostile ex-member, described the profound effect Jouret had on her husband when they fi rst joined the OTS: “I think it was like falling in love with someone.” She described ritual events that fi t Kanter’s (1972) model of a “mortifi cation mechanism.” Jouret, dressed as a priest, would walk around the room, praising or criticizing individuals. “If Jouret was severely critical ... the lights in the room would fl ash off and on.”As a homeopathic doctor, Jouret apparently used some of the tricks common to shamans: “It’s lucky you came to me when you did!” he told one patient who consulted him on a minor ailment. “You had cancer, and I’ve just cured it!”13While Jouret was an inspiring preacher, he seemed to be a clumsy pastor. Quebec Templars complained about his insensitive handling of people in the Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade commune, and after 1987, his charisma was waning: “When I saw Jouret in ’91, I saw there was a change in him.” In contrast, two Quebec Templars 9 Templar interviewed in the Bar St Manoir, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec.10 Personal communication.11 Personal communication.12 William Marsden’s interview notes.13 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple45expressed a deep and abiding admiration for “Jo” (Joseph Di Mambro) who “was a different case” from Jouret: “In 1984 I met him, he was maybe one of the last conscious persons on earth. He moved with the forces, it was that simple. I don’t like to use the word ‘power’.” In contrast to Jouret’s crude manipulations, Di Mambro’s spiritual authority was perceived as subtle and understated—“a fountain of truth, but in conversation, not by preaching.”14There was a struggle over the leadership of the Quebec branch which resulted in a schism in the order. When Luc Jouret arrived to govern the commune, he antagonized members, short-circuited their decision-making processes, and interfered in members’ lives—pushing some toward divorce and others to remarrying inside the OTS. In 1987, the administrative council met, voted Jouret out of offi ce and appointed Robert Fallardeau, a Quebec civil servant, in his place, while allowing Jouret a role in public relations to save face. According to Jacques Larochelle, the OTS’s lawyer, Jouret quit the executive committee in 1993. Roger Giguere, the treasurer, claims that the Quebec branch was non-hierarchical and that its administrative council functioned in a democratic fashion. The European branch of the OTS rejected this decision, and did not recognize Fallardeau, but Jouret fell out of favor with Di Mambro.An important factor behind the schism was the Quebec nationalist pride and resistance to the perceived forces of Gallic colonization and condescension. One informant observed that the separation/sovereignty issue was being acted out withinthe OTS almost as a self-conscious parallel to Quebec’s negotiations with the federal government.15Radical AsceticismThe radical body/spirit dualism that Hans Jonas claims as a “cardinal feature of gnostic thought” (Jonas 1963: 46) was espoused by the OTS. In many ways Di Mambro’s inner circle resembled the Manicheans:For the initiated Manicheans, the teachers themselves developed a typical sectarian cosmology. Their tightly organized group maintained its identity by elaborate rituals, ruthless rejection of the bad outside, and affi rmation by symbolic means of the purity of the group ... their system of moral control and bodily asceticism offered a technique for achieving mastery over the self. (Douglas 1973: 181)In strong group/weak grid groups Douglas fi nds ascetic attitudes which reject what is external: the husk, the empty shell, the material world. The OTS brand of asceticism involved, on the one hand, a conspicuous display of wealth and beauty, the connoisseur’s intoxication with art and history, but, on the other hand, members cultivated an inner detachment from the body and from social roles. The newspapers have puzzled over the irrational handling of money in the OTS—the “fl ipping” or 14 Interview with Templar in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade.15 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple46resale of chalets among the leaders and the transfers of large sums from bank to bank. The police have investigated these leads, suspecting “money-laundering”, “arms smuggling” or “mafi a connections”—but to no avail. It appears not unlikely that these potlatch-like transactions were public expressions of an ascetic indifference to personal possessions. One close associate of Jouret offered an occult explanation for the mysterious source of wealth in the OTS:During the Crusades it was the Templars who had the fi rst bank in the world. It was dangerous to travel with money then. People trusted them ... and they always got [their money] back when they got to Jerusalem. They never had fi nancial problems in history—it is still like that. ... The Templars learned to move money, not only across physical spaces, but through time—usually in the form of jewels ... by putting it in secret places, burying it for a century, sometimes through decorporealizing. ... They were always rich, in one way or another.16A radical asceticism also governed their social/ sexual experiments. Conventions of age and gender were fl aunted so as to cause a kind of communitas (Turner, 1968) of disembodied souls. Many couples were formed between partners with unusual age discrepancies: Collette Genoud was 49 and her husband, Gerry, was 39; Huguenin’s wife was in her mid-thirties when she teamed up with Di Mambro’s 14-year-old son, Elio. Huguenin points out a prominent couple who had an unusual marriage; she was 30 years younger than he (Huguenin 1995: 183). Di Mambro was 58 when he began his affair with the 21-year-old Bellaton. She, in her thirties, was involved in a secret affair with Patrick Vuarnet, who was 14 years her junior.A Quebec Templar expressed the notion that the inner self was sexless: Women are warriors, too. There is no difference. They fi ght their own egos. ... They discovered in Russia when they weighed the body, right after the person died they weighed 33 grams less. Why? Where did it go? It is the soul. ... And it always weighs the same, if the body is male or female.17Marriage was a highly valued state in the Order, but the leaders encouraged “defamilialization” (Kanter 1972). Di Mambro would periodically endow members with new spiritual identities by revealing to them their previous incarnations: Luc Jouret was Bernard de Clairvaux, his wife Maat, daughter of Re; Dominique Bellaton was Queen Hatshepsut, Patrick Vuarnet was Manatanus; Thierry Huguenin was Ram, Melchesidech’s priest, and Falardeau was Akhenaton’s scribe. Then Di Mambro or Jouret would arrange a “cosmic marriage” so that the new couple could embark on an important mission. While sudden revisions in identity were often a prelude to promotion or demotion (Huguenin 1995: 160), these narratives of previous lives seemed to lend drama and the illusion of spiritual progress to members’ lives.Some members claimed that the group did notseek to interfere in their private relationships or family life (Aubert and Keller 1994), but several ex-16 Personal communication.17 Interview with a Templar in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple47members complained they were railroaded into “cosmic weddings.” Much of the experimentation reported in the Quebec commune might be analyzed as classic “commitment mechanisms” which Kanter (1972) fi nds necessary for the success and survival of communal utopias.Douglas notes that “small groups” have diffi culty in containing confl ict, because their system of authority has “very weak resources.” Beyond a certain size, she argues, they cannot persist without introducing a sharper defi nition into the structure of roles at this low level of organization. Two strategies, she notes, are the expulsion of dissidents and group fi ssion. “Cosmic marriages” seemed to serve the same purpose—members’ identities were altered and their relationships re-ordered so as to form new confi gurations. In this way, the OTS adapted itself to the “dynamics of renewal and continuity in such social systems” (Douglas 1973: 162).The “Perfect Vessel”Lt Richard St Denis noted in the Sûreté du Québec press report that the followers of Di Mambro were deeply preoccupied with issues of purity:They wouldn’t sit on the seat another person had used for fear of contaminating their own energy. Members wouldn’t allow their children to play with non-OTS children for the same reason. ... When OTS children played together they had to wear gloves so that their energy wouldn’t be transmitted and mingled through their toys. (Gazette, 19 November 1994: A2.)The alternative family patterns in the OTS were based on notions of purity. Their goal was to create nine “cosmic children” to usher in the New Age. Only fi ve existed at the time of the “transit,” and the arch-child was 12-year-old Emmanuelle, who died in the fi re at Salvan.Dominique Bellaton was the mother of Emmanuelle, who was believed to have been conceived immaculately. Bellaton had been brought to Di Mambro at the age of 19 by her parents who were worried by her interest in boys and drugs. He told her she was the reincarnation of Queen Hatshepsut, dressed her in elegant silk dresses and make-up, and made her his chief mistress. She enjoyed a charismatic career in her own right; she wrote tracts, performed priestly functions and gave workshops (personal communication; Huguenin 1995: 130). Di Mambro chose her to be the mother of the “avatar,” and claimed that she conceived “without my touching her.” The “rite of conception” was staged in the green room of the subterranean Sanctuaire,where the apparition of an ancient “master,” Manatanus, appeared eight feet in height amidst special effects and dramatic lighting. The entity extended his sword to direct a laser beam across the room toward the kneeling Bellaton. As it touched her throat, a fl ash of fi ght illuminated the sanctuary, and the immaculate conception was believed by the astonished congregation to have taken place. Jocelyne Di Mambro"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple48was disguised as Manatanus, wearing a cape and mask, and Bellaton held a fl ashlight inside her mouth so that her throat appeared swollen and glowing.18During the birth, on 20–21 March 1981, members held an all-night vigil of liturgical chant. Di Mambro had announced even before the conception that the spirit of his mother, Madame Di Mambro, who had died recently, would return in a body of a child born by Bellaton. For three months after the birth, no one was allowed to look at the child. The placenta was buried under a red oak. The baby was baptized with Jordan water and holy oils from Jerusalem blessed in the tomb of King David (Huguenin 1995: 131). Every evening her stools were taken to the garden and planted in the vegetable garden.Emmanuelle was considered to be “the avatar” who would usher in the New Age and the other “cosmic” children were not allowed within a meter of her. Di Mambro declared that since she was conceived by “theogamie,” she only had one blood in her veins and, hence, was fragile. She wore a helmet and gloves to protect the purity of her aura and a training halter as a toddler, so that she would never fall to the ground. Emmanuelle, affectionately called “Doudou,” lived with the Di Mambros, and their son, Elio; her father would always refer to her as “he.” No one but her family was permitted to touch her. She was instructed in Templar philosophy by Nicky Dutoit, who became Bellaton’s closest friend and confi dante, and served as an indirect link to her daughter. One member recalls that “Doudou” spoke fi ve languages and was very intelligent. She grew up believing that she had magical powers, for when she entered the temple, she found she was able to glance at doors and windows and, utter “Ouvrez!,” and they would respond to her will. In fact, Di Mambro had an electronic device under his cloak and would press the appropriate button.19InNatural Symbols, Douglas (1973) explores the notion that the body is a microcosm of society whose orifi ces are symbols of the entrances and exits regulating a small community’s intercourse with the larger surrounding society or with competing tribes. In a logical fashion, she shows how purifi cation ceremonies, as well as dietary and sexual taboos, serve to strengthen the boundaries between a minority group and the larger society. She applies this theory to the early Christians’ emphasis on virginity:The idea that virginity had a special positive value was bound to fall on good soil in a small, persecuted minority group ... these social conditions lend themselves to beliefs which symbolize the body as an imperfect container which will only be perfect if it can be made impermeable. (Douglas, 1966: 158)The OTS conceived of its own community as shaped like a vessel or container. It was a “hollow earth cult” in the sense that members believed in the existence of Agartha, the theosophical subterranean world, where the Ascended Masters lived in a superior state of civilization. Huguenin (1995) describes the subterranean realm beneath Zurich where the Elder Brothers themselves emanate the necessary light. 18 Peter Pearson’s interview notes.19 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple49The OTS built underground sanctuaries which were concealed behind false walls and reached by secret passages, requiring the ritual descent of 22 steps.The notion of a communion of souls or charismatic community was conveyed by the term egregore, which means the “common aura” or “bank of consciousness” of the group. Emmanuelle, like the early Christian virgin-martyrs, became the microcosm or symbol of this small, threatened society. The body of Luc Jouret served a similar function. During full-moon ceremonies members were instructed to avoid looking into his eyes, since he was “the Christ.” Rosemary Klaus tells a startling tale in a Quebec tabloid that eight couples practiced “sperm drinking” in the chapel for purifi cation:Jouret would reduce our food rations, we lived almost exclusively on peanut butter and bread, because Jouret said we must fast in order to survive the end of time. When a woman complained she was weak with hunger [we were told] the sperm of the “maitre” will restore her lost strength. (Photo Police, 14–21 October 1994: 5–7)Several “leaks” in the “perfect vessel” were caused by the Quebec schism headed by Fallardeau, and by a series of scandals and police investigations. On 23 November 1992 an anonymous phone call warned Quebec government offi cials of a mysterious Q-37 terrorist group that was plotting to murder Claude Ryan, Quebec’s Minister of the Interior, because he was indulgent toward the claims of the Native Americans. On 8 May 1993, two OTS leaders, Pierre Vinet and Hermann Delorme, were arrested for attempting to purchase illegal handguns. They were initially suspected of being part of the Q-37 plot. At the 30 June 1993 court hearing they received a “suspended acquittal” and a fi ne.The theory advanced by the Swiss police is that the Quebec members who died at Cheiry were murdered to avenge the schism led by Fallardeau who supplanted Jouret as the leader in Quebec in the early 1980s, and these murders represented the “just retribution” to “traitors” threatened in the “Testament” (The Cult Observer 11(9 and 10), 1994: 21).“Witch-hunts” and HomicideIn “small group” societies, Douglas notes, “the body of the witch, normal seeming ... is equipped with hidden ... malevolent powers ... often body excretions are the weapon of his craft ... soul sucking, food poisoning” (1973: 138–9).The OTS had a long history of “witch-hunts,” for betrayal of the order was considered a very serious offense. A local member revealed that he had a serious confl ict with Jouret years earlier in Switzerland, and that the very next day a member of his family was hit by a car while cycling through the Alps. The person’s limbs were broken, death was narrowly averted, and the person ended up in hospital with considerable memory loss. When the sad news was reported to Luc Jouret, his comment was “We must refl ect upon this event–as a sign!” The informant suspected that Jouret might have arranged the “accident” and, on learning of the slaughter of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple50the Dutoit family in Morin Heights commented, “There may have been murders before in the group!”20The treatment of Mme Jouret recalls the negative magic of “soul sucking” found in shamanic religions. Her “outcasting” contributed to the construction of charisma around the person of her husband. One day Di Mambro announced that the “Masters in Zurich” had revealed that Jouret was the reincarnation of Bernard de Clairvaux, the “true founder” of l’Ordre des Templiers in 1128, but that his wife was an obstacle to his new mission, because she was Maat, daughter of Re, and the couples’ “vibrations” were incompatible. A purifi cation ritual was held in the innermost sanctuary at Salvan to “deprive Maat of her energy so as to save St. Bernard.” Huguenin describes how Mme Jouret’s eyes lost their luster, how her cheeks became lined, her walk hesitant, her skin turned green, as she was reduced to “an empty shell, a body without a soul” (Huguenin 1995: 132).Next, Dutoit’s pregnant wife, Nicky, became a symbol of evil and pollution. The background to this extraordinary situation was explained by Giles Therriault, head of criminal investigations for the Sûreté du Québec:After Nicki Dutoit had suffered a miscarriage, Di Mambro forbade her to bear children. But after the Dutoits left Switzerland and moved to Quebec they gave birth to a son whose middle name was Emmanuel. Di Mambro then described the Dutoits as “polluted” and their baby as a reincarnation of the “Antichrist”. (The Gazette, 19 November 1994: A1–A2)Di Mambro warned members to avoid the expectant Nicky Dutoit and to bar her from entering the kitchens or dining room (Huguenin 1995: 157). This recalls Douglas’s observation that witches are often accused of poisoning food. The day Christopher Emmanuel was born, Di Mambro announced, “We must observe strict rules, without which we are lost ... You must never look at the baby, and you must on no pretext approach Nickie ... you must disinfect all the rooms” (Huguenin 1995: 159).The baffl ing murder of the Dutoits and their baby in Morin Heights certainly suggests elements of the witch-hunt. Dutoit was the lighting engineer who created illusions for the rituals in l’Ermitage in Salvan through sophisticated electronic devices, with the help of mirrors, holograms, projections, and lighting effects. He defected in 1991 and moved to Quebec, although he continued to be employed by the OTS. Ex-members have speculated that his brutal murder may have been provoked by his indiscretion in boasting to other members about his work, thereby undermining the charismatic claims of Jouret and Di Mambro, the maestros of these epiphanies; they had encouraged the illusion that these visions of the Grail and spirits were conjured up by the powers of the Grand Masters. These experiences may have been enhanced by drinking coffee laced with stimulants and hallucinogens. A rumor circulated among members that Dutoit was a spy reporting to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Huguenin describes how Di Mambro decided to “cast down the star” of Dutoit and effect a “symbolic execution,” so that Dutoit “lost his aura” and became a “shadow of his former self” (Huguenin 1995: 156–8).20 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple51The Swiss police believe that Di Mambro ordered the killing of the Dutoits because they gave birth to the “Antichrist” and had the temerity to call him “Emmanuel.” These murders were performed in a ritual fashion:Antonio Dutoit was murdered with 50 knife wounds that could correspond to the number of victims of the OTS. ... Nicki Robinson [Dutoit] received 14 blows of a knife, four in the throat to prevent her having another child in another life ... eight in the back, symbolic of justice ... and two to her breast because she had nursed the Antichrist. The baby was killed by a single stab to the heart, the only way to kill the Antichrist. In his chest the police found a “pieu de bois symbolique”. (The Gazette, 19 November 1994: A1–A2)According to the Swiss magistrate, André Piller, the executioner was Joel Egger and the Genouds were his accomplices. Huguenin states that Di Mambro revealed to Gerry Genoud that he was the reincarnation of the soldier who had pierced Christ with his lance. In order to expiate this terrible crime, he must destroy the “Antichrist” and his parents in a rite of purifi cation. After the “execution” Egger and Bellaton boarded a plane for Switzerland to die in Salvan, but the Genouds remained behind to hide the bodies and to purify their souls by washing the walls of the room. Then they committed suicide.21 The nature of Bellaton’s participation in the murder of her closest friend is unclear. Her voice on a cassette recording of an OTS meeting tells of “certain conditions to fulfi l, notably that justice and sentences are rendered. There is a ritual to do, perhaps that will be the most diffi cult” (Paris Match, 18 April 1996: 56).The Dutoits posed a threat to the boundaries of the group, for they moved from the very center and crossed the margins when they defected. As Douglas notes, “magical danger is associated with the idea of boundary, for evil is a foreign danger” (1973: 138).The Signifi cance of the “Transit”It has been shown that the OTS belonged to that striking species of primitive or small society described by Douglas as “strong group/weak grid.” It was a “small competitive society” demonstrating the “contraction and ... confusion of social ties which go with the witchcraft syndrome,” and its ruthless treatment of dissidents is characteristic of the “witch-hunts” found in “small group” societies (Douglas, 1973: 137). While the distinctive shape of this new religion does not adequately account for its violence, and this study is in no way intended to be used as a blueprint to detect potentially “dangerous” NRMs, understanding its shape is necessary before one can address the question of what problems the “transit” solved for the OTS and its leaders.I propose that the “transit” resolved two dilemmas. First, it was a response to the felt threat of pollution. It was a purifi cation ritual that guarded the OTS’s secrets and 21 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple52preserved its magical power. Secondly, the “transit” was intended as a charismatic display and a radical solution to perceived threats to the leadership and the diffi cult problem of the succession.Douglas argues that when the small group is threatened from outside sources, these perceived threats will be acted out in body rituals. Like many NRMs, the OTS suffered from external threats: lawsuits by ex-members, police investigations, and schism. These perceived threats to its integrity were warded off by purity rituals. When core group members defected, their belongings were burned and their rooms sterilized with water at 90°C (Huguenin 1995.) Dissident members, as a kind of “mortifi cation” (Kanter, 1972), participated in ceremonies where they placed garbage bags over their heads as a symbol of environmental contamination (Marsden, 15 October 1994). Many of the bodies of the Quebec “traitors” at Cheiry had their heads encased in plastic garbage bags. The fi res that engulfed the Swiss and Quebec chalets were lit for magical purposes: to purify the Templars’ spirits and to transport them to another world. The apocalyptic qualities of fi re were explained by Jouret, who believed that the Earth was on the cusp between the transition from Pisces to the Aquarian Age (L’Actualité, February 1995: 20–25).Thus, it might be argued that the “transit” was a drastic measure to preserve the group’s integrity by saving secrets that were solis sacerdotibus. It was a way to repair the “leaks” in their “perfect vessel” and transport it to a safer realm. One researcher expressed this theory in lay terms:The suicide was organized to save their secrets. The whole group was built on everyone having secrets—secrets within secrets. Every time the police came to Morin Heights, members trembled lest they stumble upon the crypt in the basement, or desecrate their sacred temples and brotherhood rooms in Geneva. One word to the wrong source, one traitor or indiscretion and all their secrets might be revealed. (personal communication)The “Testament” expresses pollution fears: “According to a commandment from the Great White Lodge of Sirius, we have closed and chosen to blow up all the sanctuaries of the Secret Lodges to prevent their desecration by ignorant people or impostors.”The very pattern of the 1994 explosions reveals a strategy for protecting the secret core of the OTS. Initially, the outer ring and most “polluted” layer was “sealed” by fi re—after the execution of the “traitors” in Morin Heights. The middle ring of fi re at Cheiry included members whose purity/pollution status was mixed or ambiguous—the schismatic Québecois “traitors” and “Immortals” who were “gently assisted” in involuntary “suicide.” Twenty of the 23 bodies had bullet holes in their heads from Joel Egger’s .22-calibre rifl e equipped with a silencer, found 168 km away at Salvan. As for the inner ring of 15 “awakened” souls—the leaders and their families—they were among the 25 dead at Salvan, none of whom had bullet wounds,The “transit” might also be interpreted within the framework of Weber’s (1978) theory of charismatic domination—as a drastic solution planned by Di Mambro to prevent the inevitable “loss of charisma” that accompanies old age and infi rmity. Di Mambro was affl icted with kidney failure; he became incontinent and had to wear"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Purity and Danger in the Solar Temple53a diaper. Then he discovered he had diabetes and began to have diabetic fi ts.22 He also confi ded in Huguenin (1995) that he had cancer. His empire of relationships was under stress. “Doudou” was entering puberty and chafi ng at the restrictions entailed in being the “cosmic child,” and expressing an alarming interest in other teens, and their “tasteless” pop culture.23 Di Mambro’s ex-mistress and protégée, Dominique Bellaton, was angry that he had been using her apartment without permission to throw parties, while she was in Quebec; she was defi antly engaged in an “uncosmic”’ relationship with Patrick Vuarnet, and was planning to accompany him to his golf tournament in the US.24 In 1990, Di Mambro’s son, Elio, left home and wrote a letter to his father saying, in effect, “You’re a monster!” Elio returned, but he then discovered the closet containing the props used to create the illusions in theSanctuaire: the masks, the sword and the fake Grail, and accused his father of fraud (Huguenin 1995: 240–41).The “transit” might also be analyzed as a solution to the problem of succession. Di Mambro was not pleased that Jouret had bungled his leadership of the Quebec commune, and the two were known to disagree (Introvigne 1995b: 6). Some versions of the “Testament” were supplemented by a brief note complaining of the “barbaric, incompetent and aberrant behaviour of Dr Luc Jouret” that caused a “veritable carnage,” when the “transit” had been designed to occur in “Honour, Peace and Light.” Does this signal a rivalry between the two leaders? Was Di Mambro, the fastidious opera afi cionado, deploring Jouret’s violent means when, failing in his mission to inspire the “Immortals” assembled at Cheiry to nobly opt for self-destruction, he lost his temper and shot them, leaving 22 bodies riddled with bullets as he drove to Salvan? Was Di Mambro, the aesthete, concerned lest this distressing carnage would undermine the dignity and moral high ground of the fi nal act of his Templars?Joseph Di Mambro was steeped in Egyptian lore and revealed himself to be a reincarnated Pharaoh. Perhaps he chose to stage a Pharaoh’s funeral so that he could close the magic circle, keep his power intact and take his retinue with him into the afterlife. The “transit” was also intended as a “charismatic display,” a tribute to the Elder Brothers and an ecological-apocalyptic message for posterity. As a display, it appears to have dazzled several of the surviving members. One Templar reports:I knew all these people they found in Switzerland—and each one of them, to my knowledge, was perfectly capable of de-corporealizing at will. But some of [them] were worried they might not make it all the way to Sirius—that they might lose their way and wake up back in their bodies. So, an obvious way to prevent that was to destroy the bodies so they would not come back!25Similar responses were recorded among other members:22 Peter Pearson’s interview notes.23 Personal communication.24 Personal communication.25 Personal communication."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple54I was struck by their serenity ... I found them strangely detached. “What is death?”, one of them asked with a strange glimmer in his eyes. These people were not crazy ... they readied themselves for the end of the world the way others get ready for an exam. (The Gazette, 14 October 1994)The Swiss police have revealed that an elegant, middle-aged woman wearing expensive jewelery appeared at the police station shortly after the fi res. Distraught at being left behind, she wished they had taken her along with them. She even said perhaps they would have had to execute her to help her, because she might not have had the courage to face the “transit” alone.26Shortly after the winter solstice of 1995, the remains of another Solar Temple “mass suicide” was discovered on a wooded hill near Grenoble, France. Among the 16 who died were Patrick Vuarnet, his mother, two policemen, and three children. The charred bodies were arranged in a star formation, and most had been drugged and shot before the fi re consumed them. The investigation is still pending, but theories are polarized. “Conspiracy” theorists suggest that it was a revenge murder which targeted the police infi ltrators who “went native.”27 “Revitalization” theorists point to a mediumistic leader in her early fi fties, who received an invitation to join the “awakened” community on Sirius, contacted surviving members, and orchestrated the second “transit.”While the fact that this puzzling event occurred 14 months after the demise of the original perpetrators may suggest that both mass suicides arose to front deeper subcultural and theological forces than a mere fanatical and unscrupulous leadership, it is also worth considering this “copy cat transit” as an awesome tribute to the posthumous charisma of Grand Masters Di Mambro and Jouret.Throughout the history of heresy, the morality of the possessors of gnosis(pneumatics) has been “determined by hostility toward the world and contempt for all mundane ties” (Jonas 1963: 46). This stance has led to two contradictory conclusions: the ascetic and the libertine. Perhaps the Solar Temple’s “mass suicide” was a means of reconciling these opposing moral strands. The stance of the ascetic pneumaticwho feels obliged to avoid further contamination from the world was expressed in the “Testament” of the OTS: “We will not risk pollution by enraged madmen [or] take part in the murder of the earth” (“Transit pour le Futur”). Also voiced were antinomian rationales for killing: “Don’t call it suicide”, they beseech the reader, they are “board[ing] Osiris’ starship”; the murders of “traitors” are explained as a “just retribution”; and those victims forced into “suicide” are really being “gently helped,” so that they might “partake in the Christic fi re,” albeit unconsciously (“Testament”). These passages refl ect the libertine mortality of gnostic adepts who not only consider themselves free from the yoke of moral law, but even believe through “intentional violation of [wordly] norms [they] paradoxically contribute to the work of salvation” (Jonas 1963: 46).26 William Marsden’s interview notes.27 The investigation has since been completed and, to the best of my knowledge, there were no police infi ltrators."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter 4The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple1John R. Hall and Philip SchuylerAt one o’clock in the morning on 5 October 1994, investigating judge André Piller was duty offi cer in the Judge’s Registry in Fribourg, Switzerland, when the telephone rang. “It was the police,” Piller told us later. “They said, ‘Your intervention is requested at Cheiry for a fi re.’” Half an hour after the phone call, Piller arrived in Cheiry, a hamlet about 30 km southwest of Fribourg. On a hill overlooking the village, the barn of La Rochette farm was completely engulfed in fl ames. While volunteer fi remen tried to save the structure, Piller and his colleagues entered the farmhouse. They quickly found that this was no ordinary fi re. Canisters of propane and garbage bags full of gasoline sat hooked up to detonation devices that hadn’t gone off—yet. Then, Piller reported, “We saw this Monsieur with a plastic bag over his head. Albert Giacobino. We said to ourselves at fi rst that this could be—could be! Conditional!—a suicide with a fi re.” There were only two problems with this hypothesis: although Giacobino had apparently been killed by a bullet to the brain, there was no gun near the body, and no hole in the plastic bag.Searching long into the night, police eventually discovered a hidden salon where ten or fi fteen briefcases lay open on the fl oor. In them investigators found papers that mentioned something called the Order of the Solar Temple (l’Ordre du Temple 1 In addition to scholarly and journalistic sources, this chapter draws on interviews with former Temple members, government offi cials, and other individuals in Switzerland and Quebec, and from documents in the archives of the Centre d’Information sur les Nouvelles Religions (CINR) in Montreal.

The room looked as though a meeting had been in progress. “But that raised a question,” Piller noted. “Where are these people?” Finally, around four o’clock that morning, just as Piller and his colleagues were ready to quit for the night, they discovered a secret door in the wall of the salon; behind it was a narrow corridor with more incendiary devices. At the end of the corridor, the men entered a room. There lay 18 bodies, dressed in silk capes and arranged in a circle, radiating outward like the spokes of a broken wheel. Beyond the circle, a door opened into a small, octagonal chamber with mirrors on the walls and three more bodies on the fl oor. In a small room next door, yet another body lay alone. Altogether, there were 23 dead, 20 of them shot with a single gun, about half of them with plastic bags over their heads.Piller and his colleagues had barely absorbed the shock of their discovery when they received news from Granges-sur-Salvan, a resort town about 60 km away, where three vacation villas had caught fi re. The houses belonged to Camille Pilet, a retired sales director of the Piaget watch company; Joseph Di Mambro, owner of a chain of jewelry stores; and Luc Jouret, a homeopathic doctor and former Grand Master of the Order of the Solar Temple. The police connected the two events when they found a car registered to Joel Egger, a resident of the torched farmhouse in Cheiry, parked outside the Salvan compound. When the fl ames died down, investigators discovered 25 bodies scattered around two of the three chalets; most of them burned beyond recognition.Police in Quebec, Canada, heard the news from Switzerland the next morning and they realized that there must be a connection with a strange fi re in Morin Heights, a resort town in the Laurentian Mountains near Montreal. There, on the morning of 4 October, only hours before the events in Switzerland, a blaze had engulfed a complex of luxury condominiums owned by the same men—Pilet, Di Mambro, and Jouret—and a woman named Dominique Bellaton. A Swiss couple, Gerry and Colette Genoud, had perished in the fi re with no obvious signs of violence. After the news from Switzerland, on 6 October, police returned to the Morin Heights complex and found three more bodies, hidden in a storage closet. Antonio Dutoit, a Swiss citizen, had 50 stab wounds in the back. His British wife, Nicky Robinson Dutoit, had been stabbed eight times in the back, four times in the throat, and once in each breast. Their baby boy, Christopher Emmanuel, just three months old, had been stabbed six times in the chest, resulting in 20 gashes to his heart. According to police reports, Mrs Dutoit and the baby had been “bled white.”News analysts were quick to compare the deaths in Switzerland and Quebec to the mass suicide and murders at Jonestown, Guyana in 1978 and the fi ery carnage at Waco, Texas in 1993. Much the same connection was made by whoever wrote four letters with return addresses of “D. Part” and “Tran Sit Corp.,” postmarked the morning after the fi res and mailed to 60 journalists, scholars, and government offi cials worldwide. One letter, addressed “To Those Who Love Justice,” noted “a particularly troubling coincidence” between the Waco standoff and a 1993 raid by the Sûreté du Québec against Luc Jouret and two associates, Jean-Pierre Vinet and Hermann Delorme. The writers maintained that their group had been subject"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple57to “systematic persecution” by authorities on three continents. Nevertheless they defi ned their own deaths as a “transit, which is in no way a suicide in the human sense of the term.”In already tragic company, the Order of the Solar Temple seems truly bizarre. Whereas the People’s Temple and the Branch Davidians included mostly ordinary folk, the Solar Temple, like Aum Shinrikyo, was hardly a sect of the dispossessed. Many of its participants were quite wealthy and socially established, and most others participated in the New Age culture and economy that fl ourishes in postindustrial cities, resort areas, and other venues of the relatively educated new middle class. Among the dead in the October 1994 “transit” were Robert Ostiguy, a wealthy businessman and mayor of the Québec town of Richelieu; Jocelyne Grand’Maison, a business correspondent for the Journal de Québec; Robert Falardeau, an offi cial in the Québec Ministry of Finance; and Guy Berenger, a French nuclear engineer. The roster of known survivors and associates was even more illustrious, and included Alexandre Davidoff, nephew of the cigar manufacturer, and Edith and Patrick Vuarnet, the wife and son of the French skier and sportswear manufacturer, Jean Vuarnet. Michel Tabachnik, a distinguished orchestra conductor and student of Pierre Boulez, had often lectured to the group (although he denies ever being a member). These kinds of people could easily fi t in at the Chamber of Commerce or a ski club; they might be expected to embrace rationalism or mysticism, perhaps yoga or Tai Chi, but never Armageddon.Initially, the Swiss police suspected that the leaders of the group might not be found among the dead. Police were unsure of the whereabouts of several members of the group, including Camille Pilet, the wealthy former Piaget representative, and the prime suspects in the Morin Heights murders—Joel Egger and Dominique Bellaton. The police detained Patrick Vuarnet, who had mailed the transit letters from the Eaux-Vives post offi ce in Geneva on Joseph Di Mambro’s orders. Two days after the fi res, André Piller issued warrants for the arrest of Luc Jouret, the charismatic master of the group, and Di Mambro, the presumed fi nancial director. News reports began to portray the two as international racketeers who had amassed an enormous fortune—$93 million in Australian banks alone—through spiritual confi dence tricks, money-laundering, and gun running. In this scenario, the cult became a gang and the deaths became part of a plot to dispose of the Temple’s inner circle and make off with the loot.But within a week, Swiss authorities announced that the gang suspects—Pilet, Di Mambro, Egger, Bellaton, and Jouret himself—were all indeed dead. A month after the fi res, identifi cations were announced for the last bodies, including Line Lheureux, an anesthesiologist from the Caribbean island of Martinique, and Jean-Pierre Vinet, a former executive at Hydro-Québec, the state-run power company. Swiss police confi rmed that 20 of the victims found at Cheiry had died of gunshot wounds. The rest had probably died of smoke inhalation and, perhaps, of a drug overdose or poison. At a lurid press conference the same month, the Sûreté du Québec police force played to the most sensational aspects of the case. Their spokesman interpreted the symbolism of each of the knife blows that had killed the Dutoits and declared"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple58categorically that the infant Dutoit, Christopher Emmanuel, had been killed because he was “the Antichrist.” Joel Egger and Dominique Bellaton had perpetrated the Morin Heights killings and then boarded a fl ight for Switzerland. From there, Jouret and company had intended to depart for Sirius, the Dog Star.The October 1994 transit was not the Solar Temple’s last attempt to reach Sirius. Over a year later, on the winter solstice of 1995, 16 more people associated with the sect died in a similar ceremony in a wooded mountain area in France, near the Swiss border. And fi ve more adepts died in a third transit, held near Québec around the spring equinox of 1997.The signifi cance of the transit will continue to be contested. From one perspective, the people who have died under Temple auspices must be dismissed as either selfi sh cynics or hapless postmodern fools. For others, the events suggest one or another clandestine plot. From a third direction, the deaths are seen as the product of “cults” enacting some vision of the millennium. But these possibilities are not necessarily contradictory. They all attach to the dynamics of countercultural religious movements and their uneven relationships to an established social order.Many countercultural religions offer mystical association or quietistic community for individuals who, as Max Weber (1946: 155) aptly put it, “cannot bear the fate of the times.” But in the most volatile apocalyptic sects, charismatic prophecy gives “religious” meaning to an anticipated cataclysmic end of the world as we know it. The Solar Temple developed a quasi-Catholic mystical theology not unlike Aum Shinrikyo’s quasi-Buddhist doctrines about moving from this world to the next, and even though it lacked the strongly apocalyptic Protestant (and in Jones’s case, crude communist) sensibilities of the People’s Temple and the Branch Davidians, it ended in murder and mass suicide that bore a striking resemblance to the violence of Jonestown and Waco. However, as with Aum Shinrikyo, the affl uent, mostly post-Catholic society of francophone Europe during the early 1990s hardly seems like the place where apocalyptic anxieties could take hold among people like those associated with the Solar Temple. Would it not be an exaggeration to understand the Solar Temple in terms of a cultural struggle like those that swirled around the People’s Temple, the Branch Davidians, and Aum Shinrikyo? On the face of it, and for multiple reasons, the Order of the Solar Temple does not seem a likely candidate for apocalyptic violence. It is thus important to consider whether the deaths of people associated with the Solar Temple resulted from a dynamic similar to the confl icts at Jonestown, Mount Carmel, and in Japan. If not apocalyptic murder and mass suicide, what was it? And if it was apocalyptic violence, how can its occurrence be squared with the generic narrative model that describes the other three cases? To answer these questions, we need to explore both the historical fi liations of the Solar Temple and the actual trajectory of its unraveling."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple59The Countercultural Movement as a Hybrid ReorderingAt their most successful, countercultural movements infl uence the cultural orderings of society, by producing new meaningful accounts of existence and new forms of social organization. To the degree that, on whatever basis, such cultural innovations yield a competitive advantage to their advocates, they pose a serious threat to the existing social order. The pathways, degree of resistance met, and success of any such reordering as it diffuses through society will vary. Thus, there are vast differences between the hierarchical, bureaucratic diffusion of Catholicism through Europe and the Americas, the sectarian congregational spread of Protestantism, and the early growth of Mormonism as a sort of patriarchic proto-ethnic group. Nor can these developments be understood simply as alternative channels of diffusion: they simultaneously embody the principles of the innovative cultures and forms of social organization themselves.Wondering whether the Solar Temple was caught up in such a process, on a cold, snowy day in February 1995, we met a surviving member, Louis-Marie Belanger, in a bar in the little Québec town of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade on the north bank of the St Lawrence River. Louis-Marie Belanger lives on after the deaths of others in the Solar Temple, but he seems to telescope history by transcending time. As Louis-Marie tells it, the Solar Temple of our era met the same fate that befell the original Knights Templar whom they took as their inspiration. “What’s the difference between the Middle Ages and now?” he asks. “None. Maybe the way it’s done is a little more subtle. The result is the same ... We had to close too, because we were publicly banished. Flushed out, you know. We’ve been fl ushed. Right there.” The Middle Ages? The way it’s done? Banished? “Check in history books,” says Belanger.2In the twelfth century, when Christian soldiers “took the cross” (hence the word “crusade”) as a promise to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the Order of Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon was formed to protect Jerusalem and the pilgrimage routes to it. Based at the site of the Temple of Solomon, the knights took religious vows, and they obtained sanctifi cation of their order by the Church of Rome, with the help of St Bernard, the Abbot of Clairvaux, France. Not that Bernard was particularly enamored of the knights’ religious fervor. “You will fi nd very few men in the vast multitude which throngs to the Holy Land,” he observed, “who have not been unbelieving scoundrels, sacrilegious plunderers, homicides, perjurers, adulterers.” Europe, St Bernard suggested, would be better off without such men, most of them badly educated and illiterate, drawn from the lower echelons of the feudal order’s warrior class. As Knights Templar, they could serve the Church in the unseemly duty of killing infi dels. But this was a sticky point. Whereas medieval theologians previously had insisted on keeping the carnage of war separated from the direct works of the Church, Bernard produced a fusion: “For Christ! hence Christ is attained ... The soldier of Christ kills safely: he dies the more safely. He serves 2 The following discussion of the original Knights Templar is based largely on the excellent account by Partner (1982)."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple60his own interest in dying, and Christ’s interests in killing!” Thus wrote the man who Dante, in The Divine Comedy had intercede with the Virgin Mary on behalf of the pilgrim who had fi nally arrived in heaven seeking God.During their glory years of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Templars took up wearing the white mantle (symbolizing innocence) with a red cross (affi rming their readiness for Christian martyrdom). Under the leadership of a Grand Master, they established cohesive fi ghting cadres and organized other military ranks of troops under their command. From their early duties maintaining strongholds and protecting pilgrimage routes to Jerusalem, the Templars developed an increasingly widespread organization that helped fi nance the religious crusades with support from feudal nobility. So many donations fl owed in that the Templar order became adept at property speculations and banking functions, such as protecting, transmitting, and loaning funds—services that they began to provide for dukes and kings. Chartered directly by the pope outside any authority of the bishops, the Templars also established lay memberships in the order, in some instances operating a sort of parallel religious organization that collected dues and offered the sacraments, even to men and women who had been excommunicated from the Church. By the end of the thirteenth century, the Order of the Knights Templar had become something of a hybrid corporate conglomerate: operating outside the religious and feudal orders, it combined military and security operations with banking, money-lending, and the dispensing of salvation.Unfortunately for the Templars, however, their organizational successes overreached their military prowess. The infi dels won in the Levant, infl icting a series of defeats on the crusading forces that culminated in the disastrous loss of Acre, on the coast of Galilee, in 1291. Many martyrs attained Christ in that battle, but the defeat raised a thorny theological question. Why had the forces of righteousness under God failed? Because the Templars lacked any solid base in medieval society, and because the order was powerful yet secretive, they became suspect. Perhaps the Templars were not truly servants of Christ but something much more sinister. The money-lending had always offended feudal sensibilities. “Atrocity tales” that began to circulate described the Templars as greedy, corrupt in matters of honor, and foolishly heroic in the crusades. Rumors surfaced that they were sodomites. The king of France, Philip the Fair, dispatched undercover agents to infi ltrate the Templars, and in 1307 he ordered an amazing feat for its day—the simultaneous arrest of every known Templar in his kingdom. Two months later, Pope Clement V demanded that other European monarchs undertake similar mass arrests.Once locked up, Templars found themselves accused of having denied that Christ is the son of God. The tortures to which they were subjected ended only when they confessed to this heresy and disavowed their allegiance to the Knights Templar. Some knights committed suicide rather than repudiate a religious military order governed by a strict rule, but hundreds broke down and admitted to defi ling the Cross. Later, when it seemed they might actually get a fair trial, 54 knights recanted their earlier confessions. But before any new trial could be organized, a Church provincial council in Paris sentenced them to death for this “relapse” into heresy. On"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple6112 May 1310, amidst protestations of innocence to the end, the 54 were burned alive at the stake. Four years later the Grand Master himself, Jacques de Molay, denied the charges against the order, and he and a provincial leader of the Templars were also burned at the stake in Paris, on a small island in the Seine. Within the year, Philip the Fair and Clement V were both dead too, victims, legend has it, of the curse placed on them by the Grand Master for their infamy. Dante’s pilgrim later found Philip the Fair in purgatory, in the area devoted to avarice.What then can we make of the possibility that countercultural religious movements engage in hybrid reordering of the social fabric? There is at least a prima facie case for understanding the medieval Knights Templar and their fate in light of this thesis. They concocted an innovative hybrid religio-military-fi nancial organization outside the existing order that, if left unchallenged, might have led to an entirely different direction of development of the nascent European power complex toward a sort of religiously sanctioned military capitalistic socialism. By comparison, the Solar Temple of our day has not been nearly so central to the axis on which historical development turns. But Louis-Marie Belanger’s seemingly romantic allusion to a distant past should not be lost on us. This man, holding forth over coffee in a bar in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Québec, wearing a white T-shirt, red V-necked sweater, and black nylon jacket, claims an affi nity with the medieval Knights Templar that seems like the commitment of a true chevalier. Louis-Marie shows neither relief nor open regret that he wasn’t asked to take part in the transit, and he refuses to judge his fellow Templars. “Maybe they are a little more conscious than I am,” he suggests, “and they knew things I didn’t know.” To the world at large, a group that claims murder and suicide as a “transit” will seem incomprehensible. Yet the sincere and refl ective faith of Louis-Marie Belanger gives pause to wonder what that small number of seekers from our era did fi nd in the Solar Temple.The Salvation Resonance of the Solar TempleTo succeed even modestly, a countercultural religious movement must offer a formula of salvation that resonates with the existential needs, interests, and anxieties of its audiences. This cultural resonance may develop because of a decline in the relevance or availability of previous salvation formulae, and it may be amplifi ed by the emergence of new felt needs for salvation on the part of audiences—sometimes themselves members of newly emergent or changing social strata. This, in broad strokes, is the story that Max Weber told of the Protestant Reformation in modern Europe, where an ethic of self-denial and self-regulation resonated deeply with the spiritual and worldly anxieties of diverse classes participating in the emerging urban capitalism.No one now suspects that the Solar Temple will bear the same sort of signifi cance for the postmodern world that Protestantism held for modernity. But neither is it very satisfactory to say that the hapless participants in the Solar Temple were victims of an elaborate con game, for charlatanism does not necessarily distinguish fl ash-in-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple62the-pan cults from movements that attain world historical signifi cance. As Weber (1978: 242) remarked, the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, “may have been a very sophisticated swindler (although this cannot defi nitely be established).” The question thus becomes, what kind of con game, with what possible appeal?To understand the deep resonance of l’affaire Temple solaire with age-old cultural tensions of religion, we can go to Catholic Switzerland, to the canton of Valais, below the Great St Bernard Pass, near Granges-sur-Salvan, where the inner core of the Solar Temple took their October 1994 “transit.” The roots of faith in Valais run deep. The town of St Maurice is named after the leader of martyred Roman legionnaires who refused to worship the Roman god Mercury. A church grew up around their tombs, and it amassed a great treasure from the huge numbers of pilgrims who visited the holy site in the Middle Ages. Today, the church suggests much about Catholicism. Its stained-glass windows and sacred reliquaries offer clues about how the medieval Roman Church regarded Judaism as blind to salvation through Christ, and how it incorporated astrological symbols of the planets, the moon, and the sun into its pantheon. But today, its sanctuary is empty except for a handful of Sunday tourists. Only four candles burn at a chapel altar. The Catholic Church has worked hard to rekindle the allegiances of Catholics with increasingly secular orientations, most notably with the Vatican II reforms that dropped Latin from the Catholic mass. But in Europe, this strategy does not seem to have succeeded. And in the process the Church gave up the sense of mystery and tradition that the Latin mass marked, and lost some of its most traditional followers to schismatic sects.The same bifurcation also occurred on the other side of the Atlantic. Once as Catholic as the pope, Quebec underwent “la revolution tranquille” in the early 1960s. “People left the church massively,” remembers Daniel Latouche, a researcher at the Institut National de Recherches Scientifi ques in Montreal. The Québecois are still part of a Catholic tradition, argues Bertrand Ouellet, the director of Montreal’s Centre d’Information sur les Nouvelles Religions (CINR). But given the exodus 30 years ago, “they only have memories of the Catholic Church before Vatican II. And when they arrive at the period of life where the great questions come out again, they have nothing, zero, zip for an answer, and they search elsewhere.” Ouellet muses, “Formerly, there was one great religion, like a garden that was fully cultivated. Well, we chopped down the garden, and now things sprout up everywhere. It’s not a spiritual desert, it’s a forest. A jungle.”Indeed, the CINR has fi les on as many as 3,000 groups in Québec—Eastern, New Age, fundamentalist, mystical, worshippers of extraterrestrial life, the whole gamut. Most of them are perfectly peaceful. And they are not just found in cities where the New Age bookstores fl ourish. As Luc Chartrand, a journalist for the news magazine,l’Actualité notes, “If you go out of Montreal, in the small towns, you’ll fi nd a surprising amount of everything exotic—acupuncture, Tai Chi, this Japanese massage, Shiatsu.”The Solar Temple does not draw its cultural inspiration from the East, but from European Catholicism and its countercultures. Not only did its members invoke the medieval Knights Templar, they also became adepts of the longstanding Rosicrucian"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple63heresy that claims, as one seventeenth-century French poster put it, to “rescue our fellow men from the error of death.”Over the centuries, a series of mystics, prophets, and charlatans have taken up the mantle of the Knights Templar and reported contacts with the “Unknown Superiors” reputed to make revelations to Grand Masters of the Rosy Cross. Both traditions have inspired secret societies dedicated to chivalry, alchemy, and the gnostic wisdom of the ancient Egyptians and Essenes, heralded either as the “true” Christianity or as a far more encompassing spiritual tradition. Eventually, Masonic fraternities began to claim descent from the martyred Templars and the Order of the Rose+Cross as a way of substantiating their ancient heritage. These claims fi t easily into the odd Masonic mix of esoteric lore, Enlightenment philosophy, egalitarian conviviality, and “aristocratic” status-graded membership. In the secret Masonic world, the Enlightenment became subject to magical erasure through esoteric wisdom that held out the promise of bridging the Western dualisms between science and religion, reason and faith, spirit and sexuality. Just as surely, secret organizations became venues of political intrigue. By the nineteenth century, conservatives (and, later, fascists) facing unruly rising social classes began to use the lodges to reaffi rm the old order, virtue, authority, and the aristocracy of a master race. Yet radicals just as readily drew on the esoteric traditions to invoke reason, community, and a revolutionary theory of “synarchy”—a utopian plan to establish a technocratic oligarchy of Templar initiates.Over the last two centuries, hundreds of neo-Templar and Rosicrucian orders have formed, dissolved, and re-formed. Religious movement scholar Massimo Introvigne has valiantly attempted to trace the lines of schism and fusion among these groups (1995a). But the task is not a simple one, for the history of concrete events has become mixed with imaginary history. Here, the wall of secrecy surrounding the enchanted inner Masonic world is also a mirror, refl ecting anxieties of the everyday outside world. Thus, whenever the Masons surface in the news, fact and rumor and belief are quickly woven into contradictory conspiracy theories. In the popular imagination, clandestine struggles unfold between vast but submerged apparatuses of secret organizations, from the Catholic lay group, Opus Dei, to the Trilateral Commission. This hidden world of intrigue feeds both the semiotic fantasy of Umberto Eco’s 1989 novel, Foucault’s Pendulum, and the populist paranoia of Pat Robertson’s The New World Order (1991). Whatever their truth, assertions spill back into the wider course of events.The man who would launch l’Ordre du Temple solaire, Joseph Di Mambro, moved in this murky world for 40 years. At one time or another, he was closely associated with the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), and with the Sovereign and Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, a neo-Templar society. (Both groups deny that he was ever a member.) Tracing the arrows on Massimo Introvigne’s chart, one can easily imagine Di Mambro rubbing shoulders with members of the Mafi a, the Italian Masonic lodge P2, and the private Gaullist police organization, Service d’Action Civique (SAC). On the other hand, there is no proof for any of these connections. There is, in fact, very"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple64littlesolid information about Di Mambro’s life. Born in the south of France in 1924, he is known to have been a jeweler. In 1972 he was convicted of fraud for impersonating a psychologist and passing bad checks. Around the same time, invoking the longstanding mystics’ fascination with Egypt, he established a communal group called La Pyramide at a farm near Geneva. When the farmhouse caught fi re in 1979 (a possible insurance swindle), he started a group called the Golden Way Foundation in a Geneva mansion. By this time, Di Mambro had become quite friendly with Julien Origas, reputedly a former Gestapo agent in Brest, and the founder of the Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT), a group that combined Templar and Rosicrucian ideas. Di Mambro also came under the infl uence of Jacques Breyer, a French alchemist.The main ideas of the Solar Temple trace to the crucible of neo-Templar and Rosicrucian movements in Switzerland and southern France (Introvigne 1995a; Mayer 1996). Julien Origas had participated in the broadly Rosicrucian post-World War II milieu of French mysticism, where claims circulated about the existence of “Ascended Masters” who possess the gift of eternal life, moving in and out of historical existence either in material bodies or as specters. In particular, Origas was in touch with a quite accomplished esoteric practitioner named “Angela,” who claimed to be a reincarnated fusion of Socrates and Queen Elizabeth I of England. Through her, Origas began to establish stronger contacts with the Ascended Masters of the Grand Lodge of Agartha.The other clearly evident source of the Solar Temple worldview was Jacques Breyer. In French Freemasonry circles during the 1950s, Breyer met Maxime de Roquemaure, who claimed to carry the true esoteric legacy of the original Knights Templar through a branch of the medieval order that had survived over the centuries in far-off Ethiopia. Together they founded the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple, based on apocalyptic ideas about a “solar Christ.” Breyer even published a book on the subject—Arcanes solaire; ou, Les Secrets du Temple solaire (1959)—followed in 1964 by another on the relation between alchemy and The Divine Comedy, Dante’s famous poem in which, at the very end, the pilgrim arrived in heaven fi nally glimpses “the Love that moves the Sun.” In the early 1980s, as one former Temple member recalls, Di Mambro, Origas, and Breyer were “three chums who spoke of esoteric things.”The homeopath who became central to the Solar Temple, Luc Jouret, entered the Di Mambro–Origas–Breyer orbit in 1980. Born in the then Belgian Congo in 1947, Jouret had received a medical degree from the Free University of Brussels in 1974, practiced conventional medicine for a couple of years in the Belgian countryside, and then discovered homeopathy in India while on an expedition to learn the medicines of the world. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he established a homeopathic practice, fi rst in Belgium, then in France, just across the border from Geneva. There, Joseph Di Mambro invited him to speak at the Golden Way.In turn, Di Mambro arranged for Jouret to meet Julien Origas, and in 1981, Jouret joined the Renewed Order of the Temple. At some point, following the path of Origas, Jouret was ordained as a priest, in his case by a dissident Roman Catholic"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple65“self-proclaimed bishop” (Agence France Presse, 4 April 1996). When Origas died in 1983, Jouret took over the ORT as Grand Master. Forced out in a schism within a year, he took more than half the membership with him. By that time, Jouret had tied his fate to Di Mambro. In 1984 they founded the Ordre internationale chevalresque tradition solaire, later called l’Ordre du Temple solaire, with Jouret again as Grand Master.The alliance with Di Mambro opened a new world of possibilities to Jouret. In effect, he became the front man who provided channels to a Templar- and Rosicrucian-inspired secret society via an integrated, holistic vision of the New Age. Luc Jouret’s public persona was centered strongly in his homeopathic medical philosophy—an approach that proved attractive to francophone audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Under the sponsorship of Club Amenta and Club Archedia, organizations that he helped found in the early 1980s (see Chapter 1), Jouret undertook a lecture and conference circuit of hotels and universities in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Martinique, and Québec, making presentations on topics such as “Love and Biology,” “Christ, the Sphinx, and the New Man,” and “Old Age: The Doorway to Eternal Youth.” Jouret’s publications, lecture cassettes, and tickets to his symposia were sold through a network of health-food stores and New Age bookstores, and he became something of a phenomenon. At one 1987 lecture in Lausanne, Swiss religious historian Jean-François Mayer counted more than 600 people in the audience, some from as far away as Belgium and Brittany.With his deep, soothing voice and dark, penetrating eyes, Jouret was, by all accounts, a riveting speaker. Hermann Delorme, for one, was tremendously impressed when a girlfriend invited him to attend a Jouret lecture in Montreal in 1990:You start listening, and by God, you know, you just all of a sudden feel so attracted to what he is saying. You talk about the universe, you talk about how man is made of four ingredients and how the stars are made of these same four ingredients. Then you go back to Egypt and Egyptology, and then somewhere along the line comes the possibility of extraterrestrials. And it goes on and it goes on like that. But the more you hear, the less you understand, and therefore, the more you want to know. You slowly get caught up in the web.Out of the hundreds who came to the public lectures, at least a handful were usually tempted by the web, and Jouret and his associates gave them special attention. Those who were interested in the “art of living” could join one of his clubs, each of which specialized in a different area: nutrition and organic gardening, or music and theater. For those drawn to more spiritual matters, Jouret had something else to offer. After Hermann Delorme attended his second seminar, he was called up on stage, and Jouret told him, “If you make the fi rst steps, I’ll make sure that you make the other ones.” “Well,” Hermann said, “I had no idea what he meant, but it sounded so great, you know, coming from him. I felt like I had been singled out. He had that ability to make you feel important, and it was important to me to feel that way.”In Jouret’s vision, the practice of homeopathy connects with the unity of all energies: “In the interior of the physical body there blooms a vital force, a vital"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple66energy which was there before Man’s physical appearance on earth,” he asserted. In turn, every pathology results from a disruption of the vibrations of vital energy, manifested in symptoms. But the homeopathic practitioner is not interested in clinical symptoms. What matters is the Sick Being. As Jouret concluded on one of his cassettes, “You are not sick because you have a disease; you have a disease because you are sick.”Given the unity of all things, it was an easy jump from homeopathy to environmentalism, and from there to ecological apocalypse. Pollution, Jouret said, affects the earth in the same way that a bad diet affects the human body—it disrupts the vital energy. In fact, pollution is not merely “the exterior degradation of the Planet, of Life as such,” it is “an exterior refl ection of a pollution much deeper inside Man—mental pollution, emotional pollution, and, at the extreme, an authentically spiritual pollution.”Against this grim vision Jouret counterposed the transition from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. However, the passage would not be as peaceful as the 1960s vision. We face “a kingdom of fi re, in which everything will be consumed.” For those who survive and cross over, the Age of Aquarius will bring new laws, new ways of thinking, and new vibratory harmonies. In the meantime, Jouret intimated, controlling the vital force will not only assure victory over disease and pollution in this world, it can completely liberate us from the human condition.Vital force or no, with l’Ordre du Temple solaire hardly begun, Jouret already began to feel restrictions on his freedom in Europe. According to Jean-François Mayer, Jouret was quite upset that his name was mentioned publicly in connection with Origas’s Renewed Order of the Temple, a group identifi ed as “very dangerous” in a 1984 publication issued by the Center for Documentation, Education, and Action Against Mental Manipulation, a French anticult organization. That same year Jouret told journalist Mario Pelletier in Montreal that Europe was old and worn out, its land fi lled with millions and millions of bodies, and too many vibrations of war and violence. Across the Atlantic, Jouret revealed to followers, Québec was blessed with a broad granite plate and a strong magnetic fi eld that would protect the area from earthquakes in the coming cataclysm. By 1984, he and Di Mambro had decided to establish a base in North America.It was around this time—back in Switzerland—that Rose-Marie and Bruno Klaus met Luc Jouret, when Bruno consulted the doctor on the advice of a friend. Bruno thought he had a bad earache, but Jouret found something far worse, a “cancer” that he proceeded to “cure.” After that Jouret liked to remind Bruno, “You should be dead. You owe me your life.” Bruno seemed to take this literally, and he became a devoted follower. Sometime later, the Temple astrologer, a former hairdresser named Marie-Louise Rebaudo, saw major changes in Bruno’s chart: planetary alignments revealed that he was to move to Québec to help start a 350-acre “ark of survival.” “We were leaving Pisces and going toward Aquarius,” Rose-Marie recalled. “Europe was going to be burnt up, and we needed to escape to another continent. They said they wanted one hundred people, enough to repopulate the world afterward.”"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple67The survival farm was in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, on the north shore of the St Lawrence River, two-thirds of the way from Montreal to Québec City. The group’s headquarters was an old orphanage where Jouret’s Club Amenta also established a kind of New Age retreat called Le Centre Culturel du Domaine du Sacré-Coeur. Advertising fl yers from the late 1980s announce programs on various disciplines in “the science of life,” as well as chamber music concerts and “spectacles.” In addition to half a dozen members of the group who actually lived in the house, others who had moved to town took their meals there nearly every day. Once a month, on the night of the full moon, members of the Order of the Solar Temple came from all over Québec for a meeting.Gatherings both in Québec and Europe also marked the transits of the earth around the sun. Jean-François Mayer recalls attending such a bonfi re held in the French Savoie countryside near Geneva to mark the 1987 summer solstice. “The only ceremonial part was the fi re, and people came from several sides, each with a torch, and put it in. And there were also some instructions: we had always to turn around the fi re only clockwise.” During the event, Mayer remarked to a Temple representative, “Oh, this is ritual.” “Well, no,” the man replied, “Real ritual, it’s something much more.”Deemed worthy, the Temple seeker gained the opportunity to experience deeper spiritual truths. But the experience came not through meditation, as in Aum Shinrikyo’s Buddhism. “Come on!” says Louis-Marie. “You may meditate, you may meditate, but you don’t pass your life meditating. You need your bread and butter on the table, dammit.” Nor does personal prayer establish the direct communication with the Divine that the Protestant reformers had championed. The central device was the time-tested practice of ritual. Like traditional Catholicism—indeed, like all religions that ritualize the mysteries of the Divine—the Order of the Solar Temple could distribute its core religious experience even to people who were not “musical” in esoteric theology or in the disciplining of the mind in the pursuit of transcendental illumination. What the order offered was a mystical mood available to the many, not just the spiritually gifted.By 1990, the rules of the order described an organization under the absolute authority of a secret inner group called the Synarchy of the Temple. There were three major degrees—Brothers of the Court, Chevaliers of the Alliance, and Brothers of Former Times—each with three internal ranks. On the occasion of one ritual, men and women wearing white mantles with a red cross over the breast fi le slowly, two by two, into a round room. Each couple bows before a candle standing on a mirrored triangular pedestal in the center of the chamber, and then the pairs split to form two lines along the wall. Suddenly, from beneath their robes, the chevaliers pull forth long épées. Raising the swords in unison, they bring the cruciform hilts to their faces, then stretch their arms outward, pointing the blades toward the light.The event is a Solar Temple initiation ceremony, recorded on a video seized by the Quebec police. As the soundtrack switches from Wagner’s Lohengrin to Gregorian chant, two white-mantled Templars lead in a man wearing a business suit. The escorts take a new robe and surplice from an altar and carefully place them"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple68around the initiate’s shoulders. He then kneels before a priest, his hands on the altar next to a red rose and a Bible held open by a sword. The priest picks up the sword and dubs the initiate on his right shoulder, his left shoulder, and the top of his head. After the ceremony ends, the members fi le out of the sanctuary, two by two, into a long corridor. At the end of the corridor, one can barely see a mirrored door slide open. The video closes with a close-up of Luc Jouret giving a priestly benediction (followed by a fullscreen shot of a fi replace, crackling warmly).Behind the mirrored door lies the inner sanctum, a small round room just large enough for a handful of people to stand. At a ceremony with 40 people, perhaps only three or four would be admitted to the room, leaving the others to wait outside, sometimes for hours. The chosen few saw and heard the Ascended Masters, emanations of eternal life who dispensed gnostic wisdom and practical advice. Police in Québec and Switzerland have mentioned holographic projections in the crypts, and Temple survivor Thierry Huguenin talks of “montages.” It is probable that only Tony Dutoit, Di Mambro’s longtime technical assistant, knew how all the special effects really worked; and he was murdered at Morin Heights. However they were created, the projections—together with the robes, candles, incense, and music—created a powerful sacred tableau.Initiates not only encountered the divine, they joined an eternal chain of reincarnations. Di Mambro especially seems to have promoted this idea. “He made me believe that I was a great reincarnation of Bernard de Clairvaux,” Thierry Huguenin told us. He continued: Whether or not one believes in reincarnation, you have to admit that man lives with emotions, and you know that one can have an experience as a child and remember it at eighty. And you can imagine, if you do believe in reincarnation, that there is a memory, a cellular memory, which, across time and space, comes back home to live in man.Thierry remembers seeing the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, and almost all the apostles of Christ:And then, Egypt, well, there we had a lot. Akhnaton, of course, was Di Mambro. Di Mambro was Akhnaton, Moses, Cagliostro, Osiris. He used to say, “You understand, in all my incarnations I always had to fi ght, because my spiritual development was always so far in advance of the time when I was living.”Inside the Order, according to Huguenin, Luc Jouret had no special status; he simply had a job to do, like everyone else. Jouret was the Grand Master, but Di Mambro was the secret master, unknown to the outside world. “He was one of the last on earth,” as far as Louis-Marie Belanger is concerned. “Maybe one of the last conscious persons on Earth. It’s that simple.”“So, could you feel his energy?” The only thing I can answer: you’re just next to me, I don’t need to touch you. And something may happen—that depends on the Big Guy up there. We’re channels. So if a channel opens, fi ne. That energy can go"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple69through. But if you don’t have anything to get from me except words and ideas, we won’t be channeling, that’s all. You take that radio on that FM dial, how can you catch the message on 107 point 5 if you’re stuck at 92 point 3?The Solar Temple is a hybrid that transcends neat modern distinctions between science and religion, reason and faith, spirit and sexuality, technology and popular culture. Jouret played on wide interests in homeopathic medicine to unveil a theology of health and environmental consciousness that would counter the ecological apocalypse. These ideas became wedded to other “New Age” motifs—astrology, numerology, and time travel—that themselves have been persistent elements in both the syncretic symbolic codes of European Catholicism and the “invented traditions” of Knights Templar and Rosicrucian mysticism. The Solar Temple’s neo-traditional Catholic countercultural worldview eliminated any sharp distinction between life and death, and it extended the pantheon of eternal fi gures like the saints into the world of everyday life by the visits of the Ascended Masters. In a world beset by secular infl uences even within the Church itself, the Solar Temple resurrected enchantment.In all of this, the Solar Temple appealed almost entirely to people of francophone Catholic background who felt that the Church had become increasingly irrelevant to the felt New Age concerns of postmodern Europe and Québec. However, its principal innovation—erasing the fi rm boundary between life and death—resonates with similar religious ideas that have a wider following. In Texas, a woman named Annie Kirkwood—who operates as something of an Ascended Master herself, offering advice on how to move back into the spirit world after physical death—reports on her conversations with Mary, the Blessed Virgin (1991). And the leader of the Church Universal and Triumphant in Montana, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, also sometimes talks about the possibilities of moving in and out of this world. Apparently, the image of heaven as the reward for the faithful upon death is no longer compelling for those who believe in reincarnation. The Solar Temple may not be the avatar of a dramatic cultural reordering, but it refl ects a broader New Age reconstruction of religious meanings that has gained the attention of a substantial audience.The Struggle for Cultural LegitimacyHowever marginal countercultural religious movements may appear, they must have a certain power and appeal in wider society, for they are treated as though they pose a real threat, and alternately are subjected to ridicule and repression. Like the medieval Knights Templar, such groups are “utopian” in the specifi c sense that their ascendancy on a wide scale would entail a dramatic reordering of culture, power, and social relations. In the extreme case, an established Church may suffer a loss of legitimacy at the hands of states that side with a countercultural movement, as was the case with the Protestant Reformation. Given this potential, it is hardly surprising that the trajectories of countercultural religious movements are often"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple70shaped by confl icts with an established social order. As we have seen in the cases of the People’s Temple, the Branch Davidians, and Aum Shinrikyo, these confl icts sometimes play out as struggles between the group and a loose alliance that develops among cultural opponents (including former participants and distraught relatives of members), mass media stories that frame issues of moral deviance, and modern states that have absorbed the “religious” function of enforcing cultural legitimacy. In all three cases, the confl ict resulted in deadly violence. Yet is there really any comparison? Was the Solar Temple actually subjected to “systematic persecution” as the transit letter claimed?The leaders of the Solar Temple worked assiduously to promote a public image of high cultural legitimacy, meeting in the best hotels, holding seminars at rented halls in universities. Yet the public facade protected a secret world, and it turned out to be a fragile construction. A trickle of defections that began in the 1990s left the Solar Temple potentially subject to embarrassing revelations by its apostates, and cut into the fi nancial vitality of the group (Mayer 1996). The person who ended up causing the group the most trouble, Rose-Marie Klaus, was the exception who proves the rule of the group’s appeal to a culturally Catholic audience. “Mysticism,” says Rose-Marie Klaus with considerable distaste. “All this tra-la-la and all those robes. It’s a thing very far from Protestantism. Luc Jouret depended on the Masters, but they didn’t exist. I never believed in that. I am too Protestant for anyone to tell me that there’s something else besides God.”Louis-Marie Belanger thinks that Rose-Marie Klaus was “a pain in the neck all the way,” but he did like one thing about her—“she was able to say what she believed in, right in your face. She said once, ‘I’m gonna put you into trouble.’ She said that to Jouret; I was there.” Belanger adds, “And she did.” Six months after arriving in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, while her husband Bruno, a lapsed Catholic, grew more deeply involved in the order, Rose-Marie had pulled back. Nevertheless, she continued to live with Bruno in a house just down the street from Sacré-Coeur. But then, as Rose-Marie remembers it, Bruno came home one day and announced, “The Masters have decided. I am going to live with another woman.” Upset, Rose-Marie called upon Luc Jouret to mediate, but his solution followed a Temple formula of “cosmic” coupling that ignored the boundaries of earthly marriage. In other words, Luc set Rose-Marie up with another man. “But, ouf, it didn’t work,” she says. “Six weeks. Because I saw later that this man went with other women, the women had other men. It was very mixed up.”In most cases, married couples separated if one partner did not want to follow the other into the temple. Otherwise, both husband and wife participated—either as a couple or in “cosmic” arrangements. But for years Rose-Marie neither followed her husband nor left Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade. “I had a foot inside, but always one outside,” she says. After repeatedly trying to get her husband back, however, Rose-Marie says she eventually gave up. Her complaint was fi nancial as well as marital. “I said I won’t do it any more. I can’t. I’ll be ruined.” Sometime in 1990, she began talking about her troubles with friends, including a police offi cer whom she had met through her daughter’s school."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple71One of the friends suggested that Rose-Marie contact Info-Secte, a privately funded organization in Montreal that works, according to its fl yer, “to help families of cult members and ex-members of cults.” Info-Secte (or Info-Cult, as they call themselves in English) defi nes a “cult” as “a highly manipulative group which exploits its members and can cause psychological, fi nancial and physical harm.” Info-Secte has close ties to the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), an organization that operates on a much larger scale in the United States. A similar group, l’Association pour la Defense des Familles et de l’Individu (ADFI) has branches around France, and on the Caribbean island of Martinique, but not in Quebec. “We are the equivalent,” says Yves Casgrain, research director at Info-Secte.When Rose-Marie Klaus came to their offi ces around 1991, Info-Secte already knew a little about the Solar Temple from scattered, unsubstantiated complaints. Klaus told Casgrain about her separation from her husband and her troubled efforts to recoup her investment in the farm at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade. Casgrain recalls Rose-Marie Klaus also telling him “that there were problems.” The farm project was going bankrupt, investors were losing money, and Robert Falardeau, an offi cial at the Québec Ministry of Finance, had replaced Luc Jouret as Grand Master at Sacré-Coeur. Still, she didn’t provide enough detail or corroboration for Info-Secte to go public with accusations. Rose-Marie Klaus was pursuing a lawsuit at the time, says Casgrain, so “she would never unpack her bags for us.” But Casgrain soon learned more from another source. On 10 September 1991, the president of ADFI in Martinique, Lucien Zécler, sent a circular to Info-Secte and other organizations in Quebec requesting information about the Solar Temple. Zécler’s letter cited the 1984 anticult publication connecting Jouret to the Renewed Order of the Temple and Julien Origas, “alias Humbert de Frackembourgde, former head of the Gestapo at Brest.” The leaders of the OTS, Zécler concluded, “sit at the extreme right of God.” He also described the order’s message of planetary catastrophe. “Only ‘elect’ beings who will be able to change forms can ‘regenerate’ humanity and save it,” Zécler reported, and he quoted a 1991 Temple bulletin announcing, “the countdown is locked in.” The immediate threat, from Zécler’s point of view, was that Jouret had been trying to persuade wealthy and infl uential Martiniquans to sell their possessions and depart the island for Québec, where the Temple was constructing an “arch” to the new world. And indeed, Jouret had convinced several Martiniquans to invest in complex real-estate deals in which he, Di Mambro, and other temple entrepreneurs traded property among themselves, their initiates, and a variety of shell companies.“We have come to the conviction,” Zécler’s letter ended, “that the only way to save the relatives of our friends and stop the hemorrhage is to unmask this organization in its noxious practices.” This letter did not get many responses from Québec, but one of them proved fruitful. A little over a month after he sent it, on 20 October 1991, Rose-Marie Klaus composed a four-page handwritten letter, and Info-Secte sent a copy to Zécler. Addressing herself “to all [in] this beautiful world who hope to have a better life here in Canada, believing in Luc Jouret, Grand Spiritual Master of the Order of Templars,” Klaus echoed the themes of “the elect” and “the arch” mentioned in Zécler’s letter, sarcastically suggested how “urgent” it was for her"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple72readers to invest in “this ‘monument’ of manipulation, deception and mystifi cation,” and closed by offering to “give you other information, or to meet you.”“It was Casgrain who said to us that if we got in touch with Mme Klaus, she was ready to give us a lot of information,” Lucien Zécler recalls. Rose-Marie received a typed letter from Zécler dated 17 July 1992. “Dear Madame,” it read, “In October 1991, Info-Cult provided our association against cults with a photocopy of a letter that you were willing to write to denounce the swindle in which you and your family have been victimized by the Temple solaire.” Public opinion in the Antilles and metropolitan France would benefi t from learning about the “actual machinations” of Jouret and the order, Zécler wrote, and he asked Klaus for written permission “before undertaking the necessary steps.” Whatever Klaus did in response, in October 1992, she received another letter from Martinique. “A woman wrote to me and she said, ‘Spend Christmas with us, in the heat, and we’ll discuss the affair. And we want to go to the press to say that it must stop, because the police do nothing. It’s necessary to publish.’”By the end of the year, Klaus had completed her divorce from her husband, receiving a $150,000 settlement from the OTS. In the court’s reckoning, this amounted to half the money that she and her husband had originally put into the project. But the settlement did nothing to diminish Rose-Marie’s bitterness; if anything, it freed her to amplify her denunciations. She continued to assert that the Solar Temple had taken her money. With ADFI-Martinique paying for the plane ticket, Klaus traveled to the Caribbean island in December of 1992. During a stay of about two weeks, she spoke to the Rotary Club. Stories about her appeared in Frances Antilles, the island’s newspaper. “After the visit of Mme Klaus,” says Zécler, “there was a fi lm that we produced, and the Templars calmed down. As for the project of departure to Canada, they put that in the background.” The campaign of ADFI-Martinique to “unmask” also seemed to produce other results. From what Zécler heard, some Martiniquans “went to Canada to demand the money that they had invested in the project. Because they realized fi nally that Jouret had fooled them.”To this point, the Solar Temple had managed to keep increased internal dissension and apostasy outside the public eye in Europe (Mayer 1996: 55–61). The developments in Martinique revealed what a determined opponent could do to fuel public controversy. And indeed, the apostate career of Rose-Marie Klaus soon became connected to a different chain of events in Canada, already in motion. At Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Luc Jouret had been replaced as Grand Master, as Klaus told Info-Secte. The change occurred in 1990 or 1991, when Jouret began to put more urgency into his already apocalyptic message, and people in the group increasingly responded by questioning his common sense. “He was maybe right, okay?” Louis-Marie Belanger told us. “But he didn’t take it, to be pushed aside. ’Cause he was a man of pride, you know.” Jouret’s solution was to found a new group, called l’Académie de Recherche et Connaissance des Hautes Sciences (ARCHS), a pun on Jouret’s favorite images of an ark of survival and a bridge to the future. In the schism, he took a number of loyalists with him, just as he had done after the ORT schism in 1983. His key ally, Jean-Pierre Vinet, a vice-president at Hydro-Québec,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple73helped Jouret move into a new fi eld—giving seminars as a “management guru.” In 1991 and 1992, Jouret gave lectures on such topics as “Business and Chaos,” and “The Real Meaning of Work.” By early 1993, as many as 15 offi cials of Hydro-Québec had become members of ARCHS.Vinet and Jouret asked their associate Hermann Delorme to become president of ARCHS, but that turned out to be an honorary title with no more meaning than the knightly ranks within the OTS. “One day I managed to get a little private session with Jouret,” Delorme recalls, “and he says, ‘Hermann, you’re where you’re supposed to be, so just do what you’re supposed to do without question.’ And you’d do it.”In November 1992, Vinet asked Delorme to get him a pistol with a silencer. Vinet explained that he needed protection, but he didn’t know how to shoot, and he wanted to practice without alerting the neighborhood. Taught to obey, Hermann sought to honor this request, fi rst approaching Daniel Tougas, a policeman whose wife had attended several of Jouret’s lectures. Tougas could provide pistols but not silencers, so Hermann turned to his karate instructor, who suggested a student in one of his courses “who had done some time on a drug charge or something.” That man, Bernard Gilot, turned out to be a police informant.At about the same time, the Sûreté du Québec reported having learned of a man identifying himself as “André Masse” who made calls to various government offi ces, threatening to assassinate the Minister of Public Security, Claude Ryan, and several parliamentary deputies. The Sûreté du Québec (SQ) has never been able to fi nd any information about “André” or the organization he claimed to represent, Q-37, whose name was supposedly derived from the 37 Québeckers who made up the group. The Sûreté asserts, however, that at the time their investigators saw a possible connection between Q-37’s threats and Hermann Delorme’s interest in buying guns. Following this slim lead, the SQ obtained a warrant to tap Delorme’s phone, then Vinet’s, and then those of other members of the OTS. When the SQ searched a villa in St Sauveur owned by Temple member Camille Pilet, Jouret and Pilet got wind of the investigation while on a trip to Switzerland. They engaged a Montreal attorney, Jean-Claude Hébert, to look after their interests, but Hébert was unable to learn the reason for the search.News of the investigation never got back from Pilet and Jouret to Vinet and Delorme, who were proceeding with their plans to buy weapons. Gilot, the police informant, kept stringing them along until the police arranged for him to come back to Delorme with a sting. He showed me pictures of AK-47s and tanks and Isuzus—what you call them?—Uzis. And I was telling myself, what do I have to tell these people to get a simple little handgun with a silencer? And here they are, asking me all sorts of questions. “How big a group are you?” Of course, you know, we’re about thirty. “You serious?” Of course we’re serious, we’re all business people. “Do you have any political ideology?” Hermann chuckled. “I hate politics! But then you can interpret that as I hate politicians, or I’m gonna shoot politicians. They would interpret everything that I said according to what they thoughtwas going to happen.”"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple74Hermann Delorme fi nally settled on a set of three pistols and a vague agreement to “buy a ton” later. He made the pickup on Nun’s Island, in Montreal on the afternoon of 8 March 1993. Forty-fi ve minutes later, as he was pulling off Highway 74 near his home, he was ambushed by a SWAT team and forcibly arrested. Within hours of police nabbing Delorme, they also took Jean-Pierre Vinet into custody and issued a warrant for the arrest of Luc Jouret, who was in Europe at the time.Three days after the arrests, Rose-Marie Klaus appeared on the front page of the tabloidJournal de Montréal, scowling and holding up a white robe with a red cross. “I Lost One Million,” the headline declared. A week later, Photo Police, Québec’s equivalent of the National Star, turned up the volume. Next to a picture of Rose-Marie in the same pose, the headline promised “What They Haven’t Told You About THE HORROR OF THE ORDRE DU TEMPLE SOLAIRE.” The revelations in these stories—and in interviews with other newspapers, radio, and television stations—turned out to be a repetition, with some infl ation, of Rose-Marie’s allegations to Info-Secte in 1991.The news coverage continued for over a month, and some of it was more balanced. Active members defended the group in several articles, and the citizens of Sainte-Anne said that they had no objections at all to the OTS. For its part, the Sûreté du Québec kept insisting that, while gun laws had been broken, they had found no evidence of terrorism or arms traffi cking. Claude Ryan (Minister of Public Security) himself put out an appeal for public “prudence” on the subject of sects. Yet, even while printing such statements, the newspapers continued to characterize the OTS as a doomsday cult bent on stockpiling arms. A number of commentators, including Yves Casgrain of Info-Secte, could not resist making a comparison to events in Waco, where the government siege of the Branch Davidians had just begun.The arrests also set off an investigation within Hydro-Québec that was also closely watched in the media. The examiner’s report confi rmed that Jouret had given lectures at Hydro-Québec facilities, that 15 employees had been members of the OTS or ARCHS, and that other employees had attended meetings. The report concluded that any fi nancial improprieties had been marginal, but Jean-Pierre Vinet lost his job. (A year later, in March 1994, the OTS and Hydro-Québec were linked again when two transmission towers were blown up. The Sûreté du Québec released a letter that claimed responsibility on behalf of the OTS. The writer, however, betrayed an ignorance of both OTS style and the details of the bombings, and the police dismissed the letter as a prank.)Attorney Jean-Claude Hébert thought he could win an acquittal on the weapons charges; in fact, afterwards, he still doubted the legality of the warrants and phone taps. Jouret, however, didn’t want any publicity. “They were very preoccupied by a question of image,” Hébert said of Jouret and Pilet, whom he visited in Switzerland. “At that period, they had the wind in their sails, and I could understand that the negative publicity put out in Canada might come down in France, in Switzerland, in Martinique, and spoil his whole network of activities.” When the case came to trial in July 1993, the Crown Prosecutor accepted a plea bargain, and Jouret’s hearing lasted just 40 minutes. The judge’s decision repeatedly asserted that the weapons"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple75had been purchased for defensive purposes and that the defendants had already been abundantly penalized by the media. He sentenced Jouret, Vinet, and Delorme each to one year of unsupervised probation and a fi ne of $1,000 to be donated to the Red Cross.Outside the public eye, in key police circles the gun incident became framed as illegal arms traffi cking, and it triggered a chain reaction of offi cial investigations. Within two days of the arrests, the Sûreté du Québec publicly announced an inquiry into fi nancial aspects of the OTS. Australian police opened a parallel inquiry later in 1993. An Interpol bulletin went out, alleging that Joseph Di Mambro and a confi dante, Odile Dancet, had taken part in two banking transactions in Australia of $93 million each. French authorities initiated an investigation in 1994, putting a temporary delay on reissuing the passport belonging to Di Mambro’s wife, Jocelyne. By March 1994, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were cooperating with Australian Federal Police inquiries concerning possible money-laundering. Swiss authorities also received bulletins from Australia.The initial “transit” took place in October of 1994, more than a year after the gun incident and the negative press stories centered on the claims of Rose-Marie Klaus. The organizers of the transit never fully understood the extent of the investigations into their activities, but they had their suspicions. Their transit letters clearly assert the belief that the group was the target of a conspiracy, and the beleaguered tone of their writings is unmistakable: “We do not know when they can close the trap on us again ... what days, what weeks?” (Mayer 1996: 100). Joseph Di Mambro did know about the delay in the renewal of Jocelyne’s French passport. On 4 October 1994, he gave Patrick Vuarnet his own and Jocelyne’s passports, along with a bitter letter of complaint to send to the French interior minister, “Very dear Charlie” Pasqua (who himself has been associated with Interpol and Service d’Action Civique).The transit letter, “To those who value justice,” never mentioned the rumors of money-laundering that circulated on the Interpol network. But it did air suspicions that a “pseudoplot” had been concocted as a pretext for moving against the OTS by connecting the order with a Québec terrorist group, Q-37, that had never been mentioned publicly before the gun arrests.By 1995, SQ sergeant Robert Poeti would say, “Q-37, as far as we’re concerned, never existed. It was a joke, a guy who called. There are people who are deranged, who do this. We are convinced that the one who made the calls had nothing to do with l’Ordre du Temple solaire. Nothing at all.” If so, we are left with an irony of history—that a mere coincidence should have drawn together police action, the Temple’s most formidable dissident, and cultural opposition to the group in the mass media.We are not in a position to know fully about either the events surrounding Rose-Marie Klaus’s denunciations of the Solar Temple or how the Sûreté du Québec came to unleash a full-scale gun-running investigation of individuals seeking to buy several pistols with silencers. Perhaps the purchase of arms in 1993 really was ordered to protect survivalists from attack during the big Apocalypse, as Vinet somewhat lamely asserted to Jean-Claude Hébert. Perhaps there had been no plan for a violent transit"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple76in Québec, only the original plan to survive the end times on a solid granite plate. Perhaps. But if plans for the end times ever had a more benign interpretation, the situation changed dramatically after the scandals erupted in March 1993. Hermann Delorme never spoke to Jouret again after the gun incident. “But,” he said, “Vinet told me about Luc and a couple of others—desperate. It was downhill all the way from there. His mind changed, he was a tired, tired, tired, disappointed, disillusioned person.”The Multiple Constructions of Templar RealityCountercultural religious movements often traffi ck in reconstructions of cultural meanings that create tensions with more conventional views of reality. These tensions are especially volatile in an apocalyptic movement, which may locate itself either within the Apocalypse as a warring sect engaged in a struggle between the forces of good and evil that amounts to the Apocalypse enacted, or beyond it, as a post-apocalyptic other-worldly sect seeks to escape “this” world to establish a tableau of “heaven on earth” beyond the evils of the secular world.The People’s Temple and the Branch Davidians advanced strongly apocalyptic ideologies that alternated between escape to a heaven-on-earth versus confrontation with their adversaries, with no other mystical element than the mystical imagery of the Bible’s Book of Revelation (especially important to the Davidians, who nevertheless were far from mystics). In the Solar Temple, like Aum Shinrikyo, a more complex set of tensions presents itself—between the two apocalyptic orientations and the collective search for transcendence in a mystical association devoted to meditation or other procedures designed to produce enlightenment and ecstasy (Hall 1987). Thus, three alternative constructions of reality came into play at various junctures: a mysticism of eternal transcendence that nevertheless intervenes in this world; an apocalypticism of escape from impending disaster by establishing a colony “beyond” the “old” world, on the granite bedrock of Québec; and an apocalypticism of persecution by forces that could not countenance their countercultural movement. The tensions among these alternative constructions came to a head in the “gun incident” and the campaign against the OTS channeled through the person of Rose-Marie Klaus. These events seriously destabilized the operations of the group, yet, to date, there is no evidence that they derived from any conspiratorial campaign of persecution involving collusion among law enforcement and cultural opponents. Indeed, although investigations of the group were continuing at the time of the initial transit, they amounted to nothing like the direct state assertion of jurisdiction at Jonestown and Mount Carmel. The Solar Temple as a whole never faced any proximate visible threat. However, for the Temple’s principals to sustain the collective honor of their enterprise, they had to construe their failure as the consequence of persecution and resolve the crisis in a way that affi rmed their mystical powers. The cultural formula to do this was already in their possession, and they may have planned to use it even before the troubles with Rose-Marie Klaus and the gun incident."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple77The Solar Temple had long held to a secret doctrine of soul travel between earthly existence and eternal transcendence, and even in the absence of persecution, their theology might have been developed toward warranting a “transit,” which would look like mass suicide in earthly terms. The most esoteric of Temple doctrines claimed to bridge the gulfs of separation between this world and other realms, between the historical present and other times, between fi nite life and infi nite immortality. If you worked through the complex charts and alchemical formulations in Jacques Breyer’s 1959 book, Arcanes solaire; ou, les secrets du Temple Solaire, you would grasp the relation between eternity and cycles of history; then you could move from one to the other. Many of Breyer’s formulations are based on ancient wisdom concerning triangles (the two-triangled Star of David, Breyer claims, derives from a revealed religion that preceded Jews, Aryans, or Celts). In one diagram, the triangle’s apex is “disincarnation”—beyond material existence; the base of the triangle rests on the line of historical time. Along the triangle’s sides, sages can move from incarnation to disincarnation, carrying the Solar Depository in and out of historical time, if they coordinate their actions with rare dates of high energy.For the Age of Pisces, the phases of the astrological cycle on the base of the triangle are defi ned by rays representing the colors of the rainbow, which radiate from the apex. With seven colors, each having a temporal projection of 308 years, the Age of Pisces “granted to our Elementary Human Species” lasts 2,156 years. A foldout chart directly aligns Pisces with the Apocalypse of St John the Divine, beginning with the birth of Jesus Christ. The last phase, beginning with the revolutions of 1848, is divided in half, with the fi rst half ending in the year 2002. Leading up to this moment, “After Struggles on all Planes, Union achieved between Sulfur and Mercury. (Grand Monarchy. Temple. Apotheosis. Truth.) ‘Fire!’.” Breyer enthuses, “Ask God: that Israel (among others) convert to Christianity, now that we have reached the End of Time!” On another chart, the “End of Incarnation” is calculated to the year 1999.8 (all dates are only approximate, Breyer notes, based as they are on mere mundane calculation). On a third chart, he points out that Jesus was born four years before the year 1 ME, and concludes, “The Grand Monarchy ought to Leave this world around 1995–96.”Already in 1986, the Temple’s astrologer, who wrote under the name of Marilou de Saint-Aignan, grandly described an “evolution toward the state of God” and the opening of “a door to the infi nite.” The astrologer foresaw man’s “voyage across the stars.” “Through plutonian infl uence,” she asserted, “he ought to be able to undergo the disintegration of the physical body so that he may set free the foundation of his soul.” But the seeker had to steel himself: “The absence of fear in facing the events, however painful they may be, is evidence that he is on the right path.” Much the same narrative could be found in Voyage Intemporel: Terre Ciel Connection, a photo-comic book published in 1982 available for sale at Luc Jouret’s lectures.3 And these ideas are part of a wider francophone New Age culture awash with ideas of immortality, reincarnation, time travel, and astral voyages.3 Guery and Macedo (1982). We thank Jean-François Mayer for bringing this publication to our attention."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple78In the early 1990s, Hermann Delorme reminds us, “There was talk of this ‘departure’ for Sirius.” This indeed was the location of the “Great White Lodge” mentioned in one transit letter. Another of the letters, “Transit for the Future,” alludes to a group of 33 Rosicrucian Elder Brothers who once lived their own terrestrial lives, but who now use “assumed bodies to manifest themselves in this world and to accomplish the Divine Plans” (in New Age language, they are “walk-ins”). Because their message was rejected, the Elder Brothers decided to leave this historical period of Earth. However, before going, they gathered together people enlightened enough to cross the apocalyptic end of our era and initiate the New Age. As the author of a transit letter put it, “We leave this Earth to rediscover, in complete lucidity and freedom, a Dimension of Truth and the Absolute, far from the hypocrisies and oppression of this world, with the end of producing the embryo of our future Generation.”“October the 4th, 1994,” mused Hermann Delorme. “Add up the numbers, one by one, and see what we come out to. The fourth, okay, and the tenth month. Four plus one is fi ve plus zero is still fi ve, plus one is six, plus nine is fi fteen, and nine is twenty-four. Twenty-four plus four is twenty-eight, two and eight is ten, one and zero is ... one. One is a new beginning.” There was, in fact, a new moon that night, coming into phase just as the planet Mars entered the house of Leo, the polar opposite of Aquarius. The signifi cance of this passage may be explained in a cassette tape found on the door of the farmhouse at Cheiry, but Swiss police will only say that it is the voice of a woman talking about astrology. Either way, said Hermann, “I think everything was well calculated in advance.”There are two widespread and mutually contradictory myths that have served as backdrops for speculations about the Solar Temple’s transit—that the group was rolling in money and that they executed the transit because of a fi nancial crisis. Television miniseries, movies, and pulp books about the Solar Temple doubtless will spin conspiracy theories based upon both. The fi rst myth, stemming from the famous legend of the $93 million, originated from an Interpol bulletin about banking transactions between Switzerland and Australia, where Jouret, Di Mambro, and Pilet visited frequently from the late 1980s. Commenting on reports of these transactions after the events of October 1994, Pascal Auchlin, a journalist with the Swiss weekly l’Hebdo, reminded readers of the legend of the original Templars’ treasure. Pierre Tourangeau of the Canadian Broadcasting Company announced the treasure as fact, and speculated that such huge amounts could only be garnered through drug smuggling or international arms traffi cking, and that an operation on that scale could not succeed without the collusion of government offi cials. (When asked to back up these claims, a Radio Canada spokesman was reported by Le Devoir to be “mute as a carp.”) Later, reporters at La Presse in Montreal became captivated by Introvigne’s genealogical chart, connected Di Mambro and Giacobino to the infamous Italian Masonic lodge P2 and the Gaullist Service d’Action Civique, and suggested that all 53 deaths might be the result of a massive Mafi a hit. After an 18-month investigation, Swiss authorities reported that they never found evidence of money-laundering or anything remotely approaching $93 million, but with the seemingly limitless capacity of Templar and Rosicrucian chronicles to absorb conspiracy theories, the failure to"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple79fi nd the big money will no doubt be used to draw the Temple into a far-fl ung network of intrigue that may even include governmental coverups.The second myth is that the group around Di Mambro and Jouret took their own and others’ lives because of imminent fi nancial disaster. According to this scenario, the gun incident precipitated a wider defection of members (which had already begun with the schism in 1991), and the example of Rose-Marie Klaus encouraged not only Martiniquans, but other disaffected members to try to get their money back. Thierry Huguenin claims that he had fi led a criminal complaint as well as a civil suit against Di Mambro and his wife, and that others were after them as well. However, they still held a considerable amount of property at the time of their attempt at transhistorical travel, and cash does not seem to have been a problem. Even if the group around Di Mambro were forced to sell off some property at a loss, they could have continued their lavish lifestyle for some time to come. In short, they did not face any fi nancial crisis in the short term.What they did face was the loss of something that had been an obsession—the honor and good name necessary to sustain their network of enterprises. Even though the Sûreté du Québec investigation yielded only three handguns with silencers, it unleashed ruin for Jouret, Di Mambro, and their inner circle. Under the glaring spotlight of bad publicity in Martinique and Québec, the lucrative career of a charismatic public lecturer itself became a scandal, closing off a major avenue of legitimation, recruitment, and cash fl ow. The growing bubble of an expansionary movement burst after March 1993, and the change of circumstances seems to have precipitated a crisis of morale. Jean-Claude Hébert remembers going to visit Jouret in Switzerland after the gun raid. “That’s what started to destroy his pedestal. And he experienced it as an enormous anguish,” says Hébert. “Frankly, he was frightened by what had taken place. I think that in his mind, it was perhaps the beginning of the end.” The Swiss authorities concur that, though the idea of a transit dates from 1990, psychological preparation did not begin until 1993 (Le Monde, 5 April 1996).The Sûreté du Québec seems to accept the idea that at least the core group of Templars truly calculated a departure for Sirius. Indeed, the SQ has argued that if their investigators had not stumbled on the plan to buy guns, the murders and suicides would have taken place in Quebec in the spring of 1993, with perhaps twice as many participants. Building on the Temple theory that higher consciousness feeds on other consciousness, one SQ informant explained that 100 people would have provided enough fuel for a non-stop transit to Sirius. Because their plans had been frustrated in 1993, the story goes, they could only gather 53, and so needed to make a stopover in another solar system.The SQ also offers a theological explanation for the murder of the Dutoits in Quebec before the transit in Switzerland. In their account, the family’s fate was sealed in the summer of 1994, when Tony and Nicky Dutoit had the temerity to name their newborn baby Christopher Emmanuel. Di Mambro had not wanted the Dutoits to have a child in the fi rst place, and he regarded the name as a usurpation of his own daughter’s name. Emmanuelle Di Mambro was a “cosmic child” (supposedly conceived when Joseph pointed a magical sword—with a battery-powered light—at"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple80Dominique Bellaton’s throat). “She was the Avatar who was going to rebuild the Temple and prevent the Apocalypse,” according to Lieutenant Richard St Denis of the SQ. The Sûreté insists that the Dutoit baby was the “Antichrist,” Emmanuel versus Emmanuelle, and they report having found a written ritual procedure according to which “the Antichrist had to be killed by two knights with a stake.” Investigators maintain that they found the stake along with the baby enclosed in a plastic bag. (Thierry Huguenin disagreed with this analysis. “There was an Antichrist,” he claimed, “but it was a boy, and he’s still alive.” Louis-Marie Belanger was skeptical about the entire ritually saturated account. Concerning the stake, he argued, “Somebody put it there after. Come on.”)We must take the SQ analysis with a grain of salt, for the simple reason that its interaction with the Solar Temple was not simply an investigation after the fact of the murders. At least from the Temple viewpoint, the SQ was part of the plot against them. In one of the transit letters that denounces the “deceitful accusations” leveled against the group in France, Australia, Switzerland, Martinique, and Canada, the writers reserve their most bitter venom for the Sûreté du Québec and the “pseudoplot” of the Q-37 investigation. They claim that systematic persecution on the part of government agencies, in league with the Mafi a and Opus Dei, pushed them to leave this earth. “We accuse them of collective assassination,” the letter concludes. It is small wonder that Quebec authorities prefer a theological interpretation of the transit.The rhetoric of persecution in the letters suggests that the fi rearms arrests in 1993 did not delay the transit, but rather hastened it. Perhaps the group intended to fi ght its way through the cataclysm, not fl ee it, and the pistols Delorme purchased really were intended to protect the survivalists from attack. In any event, one of the letters calls the departure of the order “premature.” And it was, at least according to Breyer’s calculation of the Apocalypse; the clock was ticking, but there was still time before the End of Time. Even at the End, it should be noted that other groups, most famously, the nineteenth-century American Millerites, seeing their long anticipated and precisely dated Apocalypses come and go, have then either recalculated, or lost the critical mass of support for their movement. In the case of the Solar Temple, Breyer’s calculations left considerable room for revisionist fl exibility, and other theological resources oriented the group toward post-apocalyptic survival on earth.We are not in a very good position to conduct the experiment with history that would inform us of what would have happened if the followers of the Ascended Masters had not believed themselves to be the target of a conspiracy. As Casaubon, the Templar scholar and narrator, remarks in Umberto Eco’s novel, Foucault’s Pendulum, “Counterfactual conditionals are always true, because the premise is false.” What we do know is that after the scandals erupted in March 1993, Jouret and his group found themselves in dramatically altered circumstances. There are also rumors that Di Mambro was in poor health; he had cancer, people say, of a sort that Jouret could not cure. In his last days, Piller suggested, Di Mambro"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple81could have reached the end of his rope. He could be at the end in terms of health. He could be at the end in fi nancial terms. He could be harassed by people who want money. He could be at the end on the level of the sect—there was a loss of members, loss of support, abandonment by his close relatives.Perhaps, seeing his life near its end, Di Mambro orchestrated the transit as an effort to dispose of his enemies and salvage personal and collective honor in the face of an earthly organizational future that could promise only further decline.The distribution of the bodies and their manner of death lend considerable support to the outlines of Piller’s explanation. The Dutoits were obviously murdered, but probably not because their son was the Antichrist. According to several sources, Tony Dutoit had become disillusioned with the group in the early 1990s, but he continued to work for Di Mambro because he needed the money and because his wife, Nicky Robinson, was also deeply involved, making robes for the chevaliers and serving as governess for Emmanuelle Di Mambro. When Tony Dutoit began openly questioning Di Mambro’s motives and procedures, however, his family was exiled to Quebec. There, Dutoit had begun to reveal the backstage secrets of crypt electronics. That betrayal might have been enough to lead to his condemnation as a traitor. Clearly, those who orchestrated their own departure were not above murder if they could rationalize it as “justice.”Collette and Gerry Genoud just as obviously committed suicide. According to the Sûreté du Québec, they had assisted Joel Egger and Dominique Bellaton in the murder of the Dutoits on September 30, and then spent the next four days cleaning up the evidence and preparing for departure. Then they set the timers on the incendiary devices, and laid themselves out on their beds, dressed in their robes and medals. Both Genouds were sedated, but still alive when the fi res began in the Morin Heights villas, and Gerry, at least, was apparently conscious, and still ready to make the transit.The bodies of Collette and Gerry Genoud were never reclaimed by their families. They were laid to rest on 12 December 1994, in a communal plot of the Laval Cemetery, in St François. Frances Houle, spokesperson for the coroner’s offi ce, explained, “In all such cases, people are buried without a religious service, because no one knows their religious convictions. They are not cremated, in case someone comes someday to reclaim the bodies and bury them somewhere else.”The four children and three teenagers who died in Switzerland—the 12-year-old cosmic child named Emmanuelle Di Mambro, three others at Salvan, plus three at Cheiry—were murdered, in legal terms and in emotional terms as well. The question that remains is whether parents knowingly participated in the events and brought their children along. That happened in seventeenth-century Russia, when the Old Believers locked themselves in churches and set them on fi re (Robbins 1986), and it happened again in 1978, in Jonestown, Guyana, when women brought their babies up to receive the cyanide poison.The death at Salvan of Joseph Di Mambro’s 25-year-old son may mark something equally as twisted—murder for the sake of appearances. If, as reports suggest, the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple82young man had distanced himself from his father, his presence at Salvan brought the family back together in death. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that a number of Jouret’s and Di Mambro’s associates were not unwilling participants. Most of the 25 people found dead at Salvan were evidently loyalists or longtime members. They included Luc Jouret, his woman friend, Carole Cadorette, and Joseph Di Mambro, his wife, mistresses, secretaries, and their children. Also found there were Joel Egger and Dominque Bellaton, the presumed Morin Heights murderers, Egger’s mother, Bernadette Bise, and his wife Annie, as well as Jouret’s Canadian ally, Jean-Pierre Vinet, and his companion Pauline Lemonde. Hermann Delorme recalls the last time he saw Vinet. “I’m leaving defi nitely,” Jean-Pierre told him in July 1994. “You probably will never see me again. You don’t have anything left to accomplish, but I do.” Others made similar foreboding comments before their deaths. Martin Germain gave a will to one of his daughters. “Take it,” he told her, “One never knows what might happen.” His wife, a surviving daughter recounts, told her that “One day they were going to depart for Venus, and there was no reason to be sad when they disappeared.”Some transits are worse than others, it would seem. Joseph Di Mambro gave Patrick Vuarnet a short fi fth letter printed in the same computer font as the other four. “Following the tragic transit at Cheiry,” the letter says, “we insist on specifying, in the name of the Rose+Cross, that we deplore and totally disassociate ourselves from the barbarous, incompetent, and aberrant conduct of Doctor Luc Jouret.” It continues, “he is the cause of a veritable carnage which could have been a transit performed in Honor, Peace, and Light.” Twenty-one of the 23 people at Cheiry died of gunshot wounds after having taken powerful sleeping pills; some had three or more bullets to the head. The two others died of suffocation, although eight other bodies were found with plastic bags over their heads (perhaps intended to accelerate the incineration of their faces). Some died much earlier than others and their bodies were moved after death. Several showed signs of struggle.It has been widely reported that Albert Giacobino, the principal investor in the Cheiry farm, and his friend Marie-Louise Rebaudo, the group astrologer, were both disenchanted with the Solar Temple, and trying to recover investments. A group of Canadians, including Robert Falardeau, Jocelyne Grand’Maison, and Robert Ostiguy, came to represent the group in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade. (Indeed, Louis-Marie Belanger insists that Falardeau, Grand’Maison, and Leopoldo Cabrera Gil, a Spaniard from the Canary Islands, were the only members among the 53 who still belonged to the offi cial Ordre du Temple solaire.) At least some of the Canadians are thought to have gone seeking a reconciliation with Luc Jouret, but Jouret seems to have had other plans. Ostiguy’s wife, Françoise, was said to have gone to “ransom” her husband. Jouret’s ex-wife, Marie-Christine Pertué, may also have been invited to Cheiry for more personal reasons. (Jouret and she had married in the early 1980s, but they divorced after their only child died in infancy.) Three of these people, Swiss authorities concluded, were murdered for revenge.Yet many who died at Cheiry clearly had close or enduring ties to the core group. Jocelyne Grand’Maison had been a member of the Renewed Temple before"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple83the Solar Temple was started. Camille Pilet, the organization’s chief fi nancier, was there, as was 70-year-old Renée Pfaehler, one of the founding members of Golden Way and a vigorous recruiter for the group. Several of the dead had direct family ties to individuals who died at Salvan, or belonged to networks that went back to the founding of the Golden Way in 1979.Since all the dead at Cheiry were clearly assassinated, the question remains of whether they submitted freely. Notwithstanding the foreshadowing of departure, there are considerable pressures to declare a judgment of wholesale deceit, trickery, and murder. Friends, associates, and relatives understandably fi nd it disconcerting to believe that someone they thought they knew well could have hidden such an enormous compartment of life. They rightly remain incredulous that anyone could ever have wittingly participated in such a far-fetched project as the transit plan to effect a transmigration of living souls. Some small dignity of the dead might be salvaged if it could be shown that they had been murdered. However, precisely because the organization emphasized secrecy, the accounts that people who are now dead gave of going to “sign papers” cannot be fully credited as proof that they were tricked.Evidently, people died at Cheiry under a variety of circumstances, from murder to suicide, with shadings in between. Even those who went willingly may have been duped: expecting a spectacular transit, only to be surprised by a bullet to the brain. Yet the possibility remains that a number of those shot to death joined in the voyage, as the transit letters state, “in all lucidity and all liberty.” During the investigation into the deaths, a beautiful woman in her forties came into Piller’s offi ce, dressed in a dark red cape, draped in necklaces and little crosses. She was devastated, she told Piller, that she had not been summoned to the transit. And Piller repliedTransit? Twenty out of twenty-three with bullets in their heads? What kind of a Transit is that? She answered me, “Listen. They all wanted the Transit, but they didn’t have the courage to go. I might not have had the courage either, and I would have been happy if someone had helped me. If it was necessary. Why not?”In TransitWe cannot rule out the possibility that the Ascended Masters continue to walk amongst us. Despite all the information amassed about the Solar Temple since October 1994, secrets and intrigues remain hidden. The shadowy events that contributed to the sense of destabilization within the Solar Temple, the ambiguity of evidence about a secret organization, and the opportunities for conspiracy theorizing all insure a continuing fl ow of wildly confl icting speculative scenarios. Investigators and journalists, academics and scriptwriters all try to contain the irrational, to force the affair into some matrix that makes sense. By manipulating symbols, we try to capture the spirits, like tourists taking photographs of the natives. At the moment of photographic success, natives lose control over their souls. But when we develop"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple84the Solar Temple fi lm, the negatives are luridly overexposed, or simply blank. In its bizarre and tragic failure, the transit established an almost impenetrable veil of secrecy.As in the fourteenth century, the visible order has disappeared in fl ames. But the transit letters insist, “The Rose+Cross has not fi nished surprising you.” True, some former members are trying to move on. Having failed to settle with Di Mambro over wages he claimed, Thierry Huguenin has tried to recoup his losses by publishing his memoirs and consulting on a television fi lm. In Granby, Québec, Hermann Delorme considered joining Creations, a multilevel marketing scheme with spiritual overtones. But Lucien Zécler, the anticult activist, asserted that the OTS in Martinique would re-form itself quietly, under a new name. And why not? After all, according to the transit letters, “their name or the label of their organization matters little. We will say simply that they appear and disappear at a precise time, always at critical moments of civilization.”In the Manoir Ste Anne in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, the jukebox seemed to grow louder as night fell on the icy world outside. Reminded that the letters mailed by Patrick Vuarnet justify the attempted transit because the world wasn’t ready for the truth, Louis-Marie Belanger allowed, “Well, in my opinion, they’re not wrong.” His pause was punctuated by pool balls colliding with one another. “Maybe they are a little more conscious than I am. And they knew things I didn’t know.” Belanger would continue on his spiritual path alone. As he remarked:The thing is, you don’t need to be in an order, a templar order, to be a templar. Whatever you do, when you’re on the path of spirituality, you’re always facing yourself in the mirror. You’re alone, even if you’re four hundred members around the world. See, it’s your soul, your consciousness, and that’s it. But I think the Big Guy out there is so just in his creation, that if you need a little help when you’re making a step, he’ll make it up to you.Anyone who still believes in transit need not despair. Because of “a just law of magnetism,” the authors of the letters mailed from Eaux-Vives proclaimed, they will be able to “call back the last Servants capable of hearing this fi nal message.” From their new state of being, they “hold out their arms” toward anyone who turns out to be “worthy” of joining them. The rest of Earth’s peoples, trapped in the mundane world of time, have their Love and wishes of Peace as we face “the terrible ordeals of the Apocalypse.”How long into the future servants will be called back remains to be seen. After the winter solstice in 1995, near Grenoble, French authorities found a circle of 14 charred, bullet-ridden bodies of people associated with the Solar Temple who had not made the initial transit. Three were children. The others included Patrick Vuarnet and his mother, Edith. Near the 14 lay the bodies of two other Templars—a French immigration inspector and a French police offi cial. Apparently they had shot the others before starting the fi re that would consume the whole group after they had shot themselves. Police later found notes in four homes of the dead describing wishes to “see another world.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple85Given that the leaders had all supposedly died in October 1994, this “transit” produced a strong public response. Both French and Hydro-Québec offi cials voiced concerns that the secret order had infi ltrated government agencies, and France formed a government watchdog group to “battle against the dangers of cults.” Authorities temporarily removed a child from the home of her mother, a known Temple associate before 1994. In Québec, Yves Casgrain of Info-Secte warned that the sect probably continued to operate underground, and Hermann Delorme predicted that 10–12 people might be caught up in a new suicide at the summer solstice of 1996 (nothing happened). Police in France undertook preventive roundups involving scores of suspected Temple members, apparently fearing another collective suicide on each new moon, equinox, or anniversary of the dates when the 54 medieval Knights Templar and their last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, were burned alive at the stake at the beginning of the fourteenth century. But even the close watch could not prevent Rose-Marie Klaus’s former husband Bruno, another man, and three women from taking their lives in a burning house in a Québec village during the spring equinox of 1997; police had last had contact with them the previous summer solstice. Three teenaged children of the deceased were given the choice, and decided not to attempt the transit.4For all our own sciences and religions, we do not know what happens to the souls of the deceased. Atheist, agnostic, or believer, our attitudes toward death are matters of faith. Uncertain of the alternative, most of us do our best to prolong life. We may disagree about capital punishment and war, abortion and assisted suicide, but we fi nd murder and suicide among the young and the healthy to be an unconscionable assault on religious and humanistic values alike. If the letters of transit bear faithful witness, however, death for the believing adepts was not the fi nal frontier, but rather a ritualized journey to be undertaken when transcendent purpose called for it, willingly, with noble spirit, without remorse or fear. By choosing the transit, the true believers among those who died affi rmed their heresy by enacting a demonstration.From the seventeenth century onwards, Rosicrucian societies have claimed to reverse the Fall, offering their secret knowledge to transform human existence from its presently mistaken paths, promising immortality as the reward for breaking through the mantles of illusion. This assault on modern religion and science offers a ready explanation to those of us whom Hermann Delorme describes as “disconnected” from life, family, job. The most alienated among us can convince themselves that they have no home in our world because they really are members of an eternal brotherhood. The disbelief in the outer world sustains the boundaries that divide them from us. The transit letters mailed from Eaux-Vives reject an apocalyptic struggle with detractors who would label them as a cult, and they refuse to sully the wisdom of the ages with transitory struggles against some latter-day inquisition.

Immortals do not make such a sacrifi ce. They have no life to give. They simply return to eternity.Refl ectionsDid the transits of the Solar Temple members amount to apocalyptic religious violence similar to what occurred at Jonestown, Mount Carmel, and in Japan? To answer this question, it would be helpful to know what would have happened if the followers of the Ascended Masters had not believed themselves to be the target of a conspiracy. Although, as Umberto Eco’s Casaubon argued, there can be no defi nitive answer to a counterfactual question, certain elements can be disentangled. At Jonestown and Mount Carmel, the violence began with murder of outside opponents, and in Aum Shinrikyo it began with the murder of a member who knew about the cover-up of the death of a devotee. The fi rst transit of Solar Temple faithfuls followed this pattern, beginning with the murder of the handyman who knew the secrets of the technology used in the crypts to create fantastic sensations during “visits” from the Ascended Masters. Absent Rose-Marie Klaus and the gun incident, if the Temple had attempted a transit, this family with knowledge of organizational secrets might still have died.A central question, then, is whether the Temple would have attempted its initial transit in the absence of the negative publicity from Rose-Marie Klaus and the gun incident. The Sûreté du Québec asserted that it prevented an earlier transit by their arrests, whereas the transit letters describe the departure as “premature.” This very description acknowledges the plan for transit, independent of external opposition—a plan that can be tied to Jacques Breyer’s (1959) calculation that “The Grand Monarchy ought to Leave this world around 1995–96,” that is, around the time of the second transit, at the winter solstice of 1995.If the Solar Temple were to follow some version of Breyer’s script, the plan would not be to wait passively for an external sign of the Apocalypse, but to take action to “leave this world” at a specifi c point in time in order to feed upon the presumed convergence of harmonic energy force fi elds. It is thus not completely implausible that the initial transit could have taken place even without either the specifi c elements of apocalyptic confl ict that did occur (that is, the gun incident, the efforts of Rose-Marie Klaus brokered by Info-Secte, the resulting media coverage, the trial, and subsequent investigations) or some alternative crisis that might have been precipitated by actions of other apostates in the wings (for example, Europeans, Martiniquans, the Dutoits).How, then, would a hypothetical non-confrontational transit be understood within the sociology of religion? This question brings us to core issues about the meaningful structures of mass suicide, apocalypticism, and mysticism. By considering it, we can come to a clearer understanding of the parallels and differences between the episodes of violence associated with the People’s Temple, the Branch Davidians, Aum Shinrikyo, and the Solar Temple."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple87On the one hand, a transit seems contradictory to any ideal typical logic of mysticism, since mysticism does not acknowledge either time in its social construction or a strong dualism between this world and some eternal world (Hall 1987). On the other hand, the model of religious violence we have presented characterizes apocalyptic mass suicide as bound up with issues of collective legitimacy in the face of mobilized public opposition. A counterfactual “pure” transit of the Solar Temple in the absence of perceived external threats (as opposed to the fi rst transit that actually occurred) approximates neither this model nor the ideal typical logic of mysticism. Mysticism has other routes to eternity than physical death, and without a manifest social opposition, mass suicide lacks any apocalyptic raison d’être.These theoretical considerations about ideal typical logics suggest that the specifi c hybrid character of the Solar Temple has to do with how it combined apocalyptic and mystical elements. As we have seen, the theology in Aum Shinrikyo combined mystical and apocalyptic elements by shifting the Buddhist idea of seeking transcendence into an apocalyptic transformation that legitimated violence against the less evolved. The Solar Temple, by contrast, did not offer its rank-and-fi le participants any practice such as meditation that would yield direct mystical experience. Instead, the production of religious experience in the Solar Temple depended on a spiritual hierarchy in which a mystagogue, acting as priest, served as an intermediary between divinity (the Ascended Masters) and the audience of religious seekers. Believers took the role of clients who received a mystical experience produced through participation in ritual.But here another puzzle arises, for what can be called “client mysticism” is a staple of New Age spirituality, found in other Templar and more strictly Rosicrucian groups, tarot readings, and ritual practices under other diverse auspices. Yet there is no obvious theological reason to anticipate mass suicide or any other form of collective death among Rosicrucians in contact with Ascended Masters. Thus, even in client mysticism not so dissimilar from the Solar Temple’s, physical death as a sinequa non seems odd. Either death is illusory, and transcendence (that is, the transit) doesn’t depend upon it, or, in the realist Zen Buddhist view (which Aum Shinrikyo rejected), death is the end of life that closes off the possibility of transcendence. There are indications that the Solar Temple theology fi nessed these alternatives by the thesis that the trauma that seemed like death in the transit wasn’t really death at all, only the wrenching shift from quotidian to eternal reality by Ascended Masters whose existence eclipses life and death in any humanly understood terms. Yet any such claim begs the question of why previous Templar and Rosicrucian adepts had not found suicide necessary for union with the eternal. These are deep puzzles, and ones that are not subject to any tidy answer now that the spiritually most evolved of the Solar Templars have orchestrated their own deaths, along with those of certain of their enemies. With the third transit at the spring equinox of 1997, perhaps all their closest followers have now departed.The diffi culty in squaring the transit with either pure mysticism or currently predominant kinds of client mysticism on their own suggests that these cultural structures are not adequate to explain the violence. A much more likely cultural"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple88source is the Western religious dualism that equates life with temporality, death with eternity and (potentially) transcendence. After all, the Solar Temple operated as a neo-traditional quasi-Catholic organization that both mirrored the client mysticism of the Church itself and embraced the saga of the medieval Knights Templar, who reputedly died martyrs because they dared to embrace the true teachings of the gnostic Christ. In these aspects, faced with opposition, the Temple drew from the deep well of the Western tradition that mixes the client mysticism of dispensed salvation with quasi-apocalyptic struggles for the true faith—in the death of Jesus, the martyrdom of early Christians, and the burnings at the stake of the Knights Templar who refused to recant their allegiance to the order (Cohn 1993; Williams 1975; Frend 1967; Riddle 1967; Partner 1982). Specifi cally, Temple theology, in appropriating the idea of transit from the writings of Jacques Breyer (1959), combined Christian millenarianism with the concept of astrological eras and mystical harmonics of transcendence. In sum, a meaningfully coherent model of mystical mass suicide is diffi cult to consolidate. When this sociological incoherence is traced in relation to empirical forms of religiosity, its source is to be found in a mysticism colored both by dualism and by connections with Christian apocalyptic martyrdom.In the Solar Temple, the theology of ecological apocalypse and survival initially did not depend on external opponents for its meaningful coherence within the group. Thus, if the transit letters had not ranted against the “persecution” that the group alleged, the insistence in one letter that the collective death was “in no way a suicide in the human sense of the term” would have been perfectly plausible. Absent the sense of persecution, the deaths would not amount to mass suicide of the sort that we have posited as the potential denouement of confl ict between an apocalyptic group and its detractors. Instead, the deaths would be better understood as the product of an idiosyncratic theology made possible by a form of client mysticism that mapped transcendence within a dualistic matrix of life and death. As Mayer has observed, however, Joseph Di Mambro was fl exible and syncretic in tapping theological sources and principles as occasion required. From what empirical information is available, it seems that the initial transit in October 1994 was not the product of a purely mystical theology; nor did it stem from mysticism colored only by an ideology of apocalyptic survivalism. Rather, there was a shift from earthly apocalyptic survivalism to passage beyond the earthly apocalypse in the early 1990s, but this theology only became fully elaborated as “departure” in the context of an increased perception of earthly opposition, from February 1993 onward (Mayer 1996: 70–78).Whether the October 1994 deaths would have been orchestrated absent the opposition and ensuing scandals is a counterfactual experiment that cannot be completed. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the second and third transits would have occurred in the absence of the initial one. The evidence is ambiguous. What does seem plausible as a conclusion about what did happen—especially given the transit letters’ condemnation of the Temple’s opponents, and also the murder of the Dutoits—is that opposition was suffi cient to push believing adepts already enamored with mystical transcendence to the initial physical enactment of transit through death under apocalyptically framed circumstances. Although apocalyptic mass suicide is"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Mystical Apocalypse of the Solar Temple89properly associated with external confrontations, the dialectic between the Solar Temple’s theology of mystical consociation with eternity and the play of events on the ground shows that apocalyptic developments of confrontation can be quite powerful, even if the apocalyptic element of theology is initially relatively weak and other-worldly. As for the second and third transits, even though our understanding of them cannot be disentangled from the conditions under which the fi rst transit occurred, at least implicitly, they raise a central question: could there be religious mass suicide in the absence of apocalyptic confrontation?"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Chapter 5The Dangers of Enlightenment: Apocalyptic Hopes and Anxieties in the Order of the Solar Temple1Jean-François MayerFollowing the spectacular deaths of 53 people in October 1994 and the subsequent “transit”2 to another world of two other, smaller groups of members in December 1995 and March 1997, the Order of the Solar Temple became instantly famous around the world and is now quoted as an eloquent example of a deviant “cult.” However, like most other groups which have made the headlines in recent years through violent actions or confrontations, the Solar Temple3 had been unknown even 1 This is a slightly revised and updated version of a paper originally presented to a group of academics and law enforcement agents at the conference “Millennialism and Its Risks” (Neve Ilan and Jerusalem, June 1999), organized by the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University and the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies. Many references quoted relate to internal, unpublished Solar Temple documents and rituals recovered by the Swiss police during their investigations, to which I was granted access. 2 The word “transit” was used euphemistically by the Solar Temple’s leaders to describe the group’s departure from this world; they did not consider it a suicide in the usual sense of the word. The word “transit” is derived from the vocabulary in use in the Rosicrucian Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), to which Joseph Di Mambro had belonged from 1956 to the late 1960s. AMORC uses the word “transition” as an equivalent for death—a word which it considers to be inappropriate, since what happens at that time is “just a transition,” consisting in the division between the soul and the body (the material elements of which will then separate from each other and return to their primary form as living matter). SeeManuel Rosicrucien, 2nd edn, Villeneuve-Saint-Georges 1961, 191 (the fi rst edition in French was published in 1958; there were several subsequent editions, but I quote from one in use at the time Di Mambro was a member of the order). This was not the only instance of borrowing from AMORC vocabulary in the Order of the Solar Temple. 3 The group used various names throughout its history. The Order of the Solar Temple properly so-called was in fact only a part of the organization, and several members of the core group had never formally become members of that order.

To be sure, Luc Jouret (1947–94), who occupied an important position in the group and contributed, as a gifted speaker, to its propagation in French-speaking countries, was not unknown in the circuit of esoteric and New Age lecturers. The fi rst time I listened to one of his lectures in Lausanne, in 1987, there were no less than 700 people attending in a crowded hall; that same year, he gave a series of fi ve one-hour interviews on one of the French-speaking channels of the Swiss National Radio. However, even if a few “cult-watchers” had already mentioned the group in a critical way and some people in the “cultic milieu” privately expressed their dislike of Jouret and other leaders of the Solar Temple, it was certainly not as controversial as a number of other, well-known movements—and, nevertheless, it was this group which met a violent end.This article deals with two issues: fi rst, it briefl y examines some of the apocalyptic beliefs of the Solar Temple; next, it attempts to draw lessons from this case in order possibly to gain some knowledge for our approach to other, potentially violent apocalyptic groups. It does not repeat the whole story of the Solar Temple, which can already be read in other publications.6Catastrophic Millennialism and SurvivalThe Solar Temple held a dualistic worldview. At regular intervals, new members of the order received monographs for personal study; the fi rst one explained to the new 4 Although in several cases there had been a few isolated scholars, fortunately, who had studied the relevant movements before the events that brought those groups fame: in the case of Heaven’s Gate, Robert Balch had even monitored it from its very beginning and written several articles, the last one published just two years before the suicides (Robert W.

However, it was especially intense among followers of the Solar Temple. A former member whom I had interviewed as early as November 1988 remembered having heard Jouret say at a Christmas 1986 celebration: “Here it is white, outside it is dark.” Such views were associated with the belief that diffi cult times lay ahead: “The fi ght has begun between two antagonistic and complementary Forces: White and Black, Light and Darkness, Christ and Antichrist, illusion and reality.”8Jouret’s public talks or interviews never failed to mention that mankind had reached a critical point: environmental problems were seen as a main proof of human foolishness. “It is monstrous to do with our Earth what is done to her ...” he declared on Swiss National Radio in 1987. His lectures repeatedly emphasized that mankind was about to face major problems linked to ecological disaster,9 and sometimes he made even more precise predictions: at a seminar which I attended in Geneva in December 1987, he predicted that a major disaster would occur within six years, “maybe by accident.” Pollution had reached the point at which fi re was necessary in order to operate a purifi cation and consequently to re-establish a balance.10 Disasters were seen as a refl ection of deeper, more subtle developments: the truth was that mankind was entering a period of major mutations. “Nature gives us obvious signs that there is a transmutation of the world going on. ... We are making a leap in what I call macro-evolution.”11The Solar Temple very much believed in the imminent arrival of the Age of Aquarius, although this would be associated with major upheavals. Its internal documents sometimes addressed the members as “Templars of the New Age.”12 The planet had “entered the end of a cycle”13 and now found itself at a crossroads. The fundamental idea was one of transmutation: the Earth was giving birth to a new race, the “Solar Race,” the “5th Kingdom,” which would inaugurate a new era, the “Age 7 Tradition Solaire, Plagium No. Al (from a series of internal, unpublished teaching booklets for use by members of the Solar Temple).8 Order of the Solar Temple, Survivre à l’An 2000, I, Toronto 1986, 78.9 For more details about the Solar Temple’s views of an ecological Apocalypse, see J.-F.

A Templar order is more suited to those who have been born, so to speak, with the Temple ‘in their blood’. Such people are marked by destiny or temperament and are the natural pioneers of the Age of Aquarius” (Gaetan Delaforge, The Templar Tradition in the Age of Aquarius, Putney, VT 1987).13 Ibid., p. 131."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple94of the Spirit.”14 “... the Kingdom of Aquarius will be the kingdom of a realized being, of a being who will no more have the features of the being which we are today ...”.15Such were the hopes cultivated by the Solar Temple in the 1980s. The disasters to come were seen as very serious, very real—so real that the group published and distributed a 150-page handbook detailing in a very concrete and down-to-earth manner how to behave in and survive a nuclear or bacteriological war, how to use fi rst aid in order to relieve the wounded, and so on.16 Such disasters could no longer be avoided, since mankind had already gone too far,17 but the members of the order had equipped themselves for survival through the apocalyptic events to come, and would gather in areas supposed to be less affected by the disasters.Obviously, during the last few years of the Solar Temple’s existence, its leadership lost interest in the idea of secret survival centers18 and another option moved to the foreground, namely, to leave this world. The hope of surviving the Great Tribulation in safe places on this Earth was replaced by the hope of being away from Earth during these terrible times.19 While the idea of a departure had previously been understood by most members as leaving one place for another one before imminent disasters, it began to take on a more radical meaning in the mind of Grand Master Joseph Di Mambro and those close to him. The idea of a forthcoming transmutation could be understood in the more classical terms of a gnostic scenario: that is, discarding the physical body in order to reach other spheres. One of the rituals practiced in the sanctuary of the farm in Cheiry, Switzerland—where nearly half of the victims were found in October 1994—was the Ritual of the Resurrection of Osiris. It contained phrases like “Brothers ... let’s go across Space before Fire will let loose its forge,” or “Let Divine Creation abandon terrestrial bodies;”20 life’s ultimate goal was said 14 Ibid., p. 105.15 Jouret’s fourth interview with Swiss National Radio, 1987.16 Survivre à l’An 2000, II, Toronto 1986.17 “... we are experiencing greater and greater tragedies on Earth, and I think this will lead us to an irreversible cataclysm ... because mankind refuses its original dimension ... it has not understood the reason of its voyage” (Jouret’s fourth interview with Swiss National Radio, 1987).18 However, even in 1991, one could fi nd a report about a visit to a possible site for a survival center in Quebec; such centers were supposed to be established as secretly as possible and to be equipped for any emergency, with strong security measures to ensure that not even all the members of the order would know their location.19 “Will you still be on this Earth when the countdown will begin? Will you still be on this Earth at the time of the Great Tribulation, when Antichrist and the false prophet will reign? Will you still be on this Earth when the world will go through the darkest days of its history? This may surprise you, but it is up to you to decide whether or not you will be present in these endtimes. Keep the hope of leaving this world before the Great Tribulation ...” (“Dernier Voyage”—apparently written in February 1993, this text was the fi rst to refer explicitly to a physical departure from this world).20 In another ritual, called the “Osirian Alliance,” one fi nds the phrase: “Divine Creation abandons earthly and impure bodies” (“Ecole des Mystères—Alliance Osirienne”)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Dangers of Enlightenment95to be “beyond Form”.21 Passing through materialization was an experience required for spiritual evolution,22 but it was not the end. To describe the Solar Temple as a “millennial group” may be misleading if millennial salvation is seen primarily in earthly terms. More precisely, the idea of a great purifi cation of the Earth as an introduction to the Age of Aquarius and the emergence of the 5th Kingdom was not at all in contradiction with the idea of survival on other planes, or a temporary retreat to them if circumstances proved not to be conducive for the initiates to continue their mission on Earth. Throughout history, they had returned again and again in order to contribute to the evolution of mankind; and at the time of their transit they declared: “... we will continue to work in other places, in other times.”23 They would wait for “circumstances favourable to a possible Return.”24 Mankind’s refusal to accept what was being offered left the elect with no other option than to leave this world to its own destiny. In other texts, the passage through the “Narrow Door” (that is, the departure of some “conscious beings” from this world) was interpreted as “the Resurrection of the Soul so that the Redemption of the [Human] Race may become a reality.”25 The success of the transit “will guarantee the survival of the universe.”26Lessons from a TragedyIt is not for the sake of dramatization that I use a word like “tragedy.” In contrast with a case such as Heaven’s Gate, the “transit” of the Solar Temple did not only consist in suicides of consenting adults. Several people considered as “traitors” were assassinated, some of them in a savage way; children had to follow their parents in death. Therefore the lessons to be learned are more than just an academic exercise.1) The story of the Solar Temple shows how diffi cult it is to predict what group may resort to violence and what could happen in such circumstances.The fi rst real public criticism of the group took place on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, in late December 1992. A Swiss former member of the Solar Temple, 21 “Ecole des Mystères—Resurrection d’Osiris” (several copies of this ritual were discovered in the secret sanctuary of the farm in Cheiry).22 “Let our experience, our joys and our sorrows ... enrich Creation ... and let our synthesis ... perpetuate Evolution beyond the worlds” (“Ecole des Mystères—Alliance Osirienne”). “From Evolution to Evolution, having gone through mineral, vegetal and animal, in order to reach the human [level] and go beyond it”.

More serious trouble followed in March 1993, when two members were arrested by the police in Quebec after attempting (upon instructions from Luc Jouret) to illegally buy guns equipped with silencers. The three men were eventually given a light sentence. But the Canadian media had become interested, and using information from police wiretaps, they reported on the strange content of conversations between order members. The movement was described as a “doomsday cult.” However, neither former members nor outsiders seemed able to explain what kind of doomsday was to be expected: Jouret had encouraged a few trusted members to train themselves to shoot, but it was assumed that the members of the Solar Temple intended to use the weapons for self-defense during apocalyptic turmoil.28 At that time, even tabloid newspapers which published sensationalist reports and salacious allegations about the Solar Temple did not suggest that the group intended to commit violence.29 Representatives of cult-watching organizations such as Yves Casgrain of Info-Secte explained that the order was a survivalist group intending to use the weapons for self-defense after cataclysmic events.30 Indeed, he also rightly wondered why the group would need silencers for such purposes, since such devices seemed to indicate an offensive more that a defensive purpose.31 Nobody had any answer. From my observations in the 1980s, I likewise evaluated the movement as a survivalist, apocalyptic group. While it is quite possible that, in some cases, a survivalist group will turn violent, it would have seemed a contradiction for survivalist believers to take their own lives as well. But what no outsider knew was that survivalism in the Solar Temple had shifted from the idea of surviving a cataclysm on this planet to the goal of migrating toward other, non-terrestrial planes.2)When a group becomes involved in violent or criminal activities (or in the preparation of such activities), it may well be that not all its participants are privy to them. Even members or former members are not necessarily aware of what is going on.In March 1993, several members of the Order of the Solar Temple tried to explain to the media that they were an innocuous group, devoted mainly to moral improvement and biological gardening,32 and that the group was not a “cult” but held principles 27 She did not hold a high position in the group, but her husband remained a devoted follower of the Solar Temple’s teachings to the end and lost his life in the third transit, in March 1997.28 La Presse (Montreal), 3 April 1993.29 See Photo-Police (Montreal), 26 March 1993. 30 Le Journal de Montréal, 10 March 1993.31 La Presse, 11 March 1993, and Le Journal de Québec, 11 March 1993.32 See La Presse, 11 March 1993."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Dangers of Enlightenment97rather close to those of Freemasons or Rosicrucians.33 And, to some extent, they were right: when making such statements, those members who were speaking to the media may not have known that their leaders were already involved in preparing the “transit” toward another world—and, if they did know, they certainly did not imagine that the event would involve violence and murder, but more likely would have seen it as a soft and gentle passage to another dimension (or possibly an evacuation by spaceships).In the case of the Solar Temple, many rank and fi le members had little or no direct interaction with the real leaders, above the structure of the order properly speaking; and the people they were in touch with, while aware of problems inside the movement and sometimes even critical of the upper leadership, were hoping to be able to correct them.Even those with inside knowledge would have had diffi culties in believing that the leaders of the Solar Temple might decide to murder several unwilling members or “apostates.” A former member of the order told me that although she had become suspicious of the head of the group (Joseph Di Mambro) before the 1994 events, nevertheless, when an acquaintance came to visit a few months before the “transit” and explained that Di Mambro had apparently developed sinister projects, such a scenario seemed so far-fetched and unbelievable that it could not be taken seriously.3) Depending upon a variety of internal as well as external developments, the projects of a group may change. Few groups (if any) are predestined from their beginning to end up in violence. We should never forget that young movements, especially smaller ones, can change rapidly, for better or for worse.The fact that insiders as well as outsiders were unable to foresee the tragic end of the Solar Temple does not mean that their assessment of the group was wrong. But, in addition to the fact that some elements were known only to a core group, we should remember that movements change,34 and not necessarily only in a positive direction. The Solar Temple was defi nitely survivalist in the 1980s: the idea of setting up so-called “survival farms” (fermes de survie) was very attractive to members, and the main farm established in Quebec was clearly seen as an “ark of refuge,” as I could observe from comments heard from members when I was conducting participant observation in a local group in 1987. Nothing indicated that the order intended to leave this planet: on the contrary, members cultivated the hope of surviving unscathed through the imminent apocalyptic turmoil.4) The case of the Solar Temple illustrates the fact that not only revolutionary millennial groups sometimes develop dangerous and criminal activities. While 33 Le Soleil (Quebec), 12 March 1993.34 Cf. Eileen Barker, “Plus ça change ...”, Social Compass 42, 2 (1995), 165–80."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple98members of many millennial groups with an infl ammatory rhetoric about a world soon to be turned upside-down remain peaceful and law-abiding citizens, the leaders of the Solar Temple, whom nobody would have suspected of being potential assassins, carefully and over a long period planned the suicide and murder of more than 50 people.In several publications, especially her book How the Millennium Comes Violently,35American millennial scholar Catherine Wessinger distinguishes three types of millennial groups that may become involved in violence: 1) fragile millennial groups that initiate violence in response to a combination of internal weaknesses and external “cultural opposition,” in order to preserve their ultimate concern; 2) revolutionary millennial groups that seek to overthrow the existing order to establish their millennial kingdom; 3) assaulted millennial groups, which are attacked because they are mistakenly thought to be dangerous. Clearly the Solar Temple fi ts the fi rst category. It was a group in decline, losing members at an increasing rate, and some of these members were becoming critical; in addition, the movement’s founder was aging, and the dream of creating a large movement had not been fulfi lled.365) A violent reaction is not necessarily proportionate to the objective degree to which a group is assaulted; rather, it is proportionate to the group’s perception of being assaulted. In the case of a fragile group, even a limited level of opposition can be perceived as unbearable. In addition, the perception of being assaulted, even if it does not always correspond to reality, can be used as a powerful tool by the leadership to convince itself and (even more so) to convince some followers to take recourse to violent action.Judging from the group’s literature, it would certainly not have put itself in the category of a “fragile group” and would have preferred to be seen as an assaulted one. Texts posted to several media and other addressees (including myself) by a member of the order, on instruction of the leaders, on the day when the events became known, simultaneously try to suggest two (somewhat contradictory) explanations: the order had freely chosen to leave this planet, but was also forced to do so by the opposition with which it had met; “... the superior Experience which they were radiating was 35 Catherine Wessinger, How the Millennium Comes Violently: From Jonestown to Heaven’s Gate, New York 2000.36 I had already mentioned this point in my article published in early 1993: the structures had obviously been planned for a movement much larger than it ever became. The success of Jouret’s lectures had mistakenly led the order’s leaders to believe there was a potential for many more adherents; they obviously misunderstood the dynamics of the “cultic milieu” and the fact that many “seekers” in this milieu prefer permanent seekership and a succession of “spiritual experiences” to formal and lasting affi liation with one group only.

The level of opposition was in fact not very high, even if the exposure was quite painful for a group eager to cultivate secrecy.43 The media reports remained limited to Canada, although it might sooner or later have had an impact in Europe too.44 While there were quite sensationalist reports, the Public Security Minister, Claude Ryan, hastened to say that members of “cults” would not become targets of surveillance: “Don’t ask me to start to establish any organized surveillance of a police nature. ... Religious sects are perfectly legal and principled. They have a right to exist, as have all kinds of associations.”45 A few days later, he denied information according to which the order had planned to commit terrorist attacks in Quebec, and invited the public to exert caution before 37 “Transit pour le futur”.38 Ibid.39 Ibid.40 “Aux Epris de justice”.41 Ibid. 42 “Delusions of omnipotence and refusal to compromise or hear criticisms may appear as a dogmatic need always to be right and an inability to admit error, to apologize, or to recognize the hurtful effects their behaviors have on others. Such leaders are diffi cult to work with because they must always get their own way” (Len Oakes, Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities, Syracuse, NY 1997, p. 13).43 The Quebec daily Le Soleil even accurately revealed, relying upon information provided by former members, that the real head of the Solar Temple was not Jouret but Jo Di Mambro (7 April 1993). The title of the report was: “Le vrai patron, un dictateur” [“The real boss: a dictator”]. This must have felt very unpleasant to a man who had chosen to keep out of the limelight.44 In early 1994, the quarterly of the main French cult-watching organization, the Association for the Defense of Families and Individuals (ADFI), published a report about the problems experienced by Jouret in Quebec (Bulles 41, 1, 24–6).45 The Gazette (Montreal), 11 March 1993.

When interacting with a group, it is not always easy to assess what the impact of opposition really is or can become.6)As much and even more than external pressure, internal dissent and apostasy may be felt as major threats by leaders of a group and may lead to violent actions: “fallen members” do not only know what is going on inside the group, but, even if they do not go public,47 the sheer fact that they leave and put their experience into question seems to shake the very foundations of the group.The problem of determining the factors leading to violence is a diffi cult one. Due to the context of “cult controversies” and also to the trauma of events like Waco, much emphasis has been put upon the emergence of violent reactions as a response to hostility and external pressure.48 While it certainly played a role in the fi rst transit of the Solar Temple, and even more so in the subsequent ones,49 it was intriguing to discover, during the investigation, that the fi rst document clearly alluding to a “departure” from Earth had apparently been prepared shortly before the problems encountered by the group in Quebec; several policemen in Quebec are convinced that their intervention unknowingly forced the order to postpone a “transit” which may originally have been planned earlier than October 1994. While there is no conclusive proof that an earlier, specifi c date had been set, the fact that Jouret had instructed followers to buy guns with silencers, as well as the content of wiretapped conversations in early 1993, indicate that some members of the Solar Temple were already on their way toward violence before the public exposure of the group (if we ignore the events in Martinique in December 1992, which, however, had a quite limited and local impact). Then what is it that triggered the evolution toward violence? It is striking to observe that the idea of there being no other way than 46 Le Soleil, 17 March 1993.47 Except for the member (not a high-ranking one) who publicly denounced the order in Martinique in December 1992 and repeated her criticism in Quebec in March 1993, other former members did not spread their criticisms beyond the circle of members or other former members. One ex-member who was trying to get compensation from the group for years of unpaid labor had, however, threatened to publicize what he knew about the group if he did not get what he was asking for; and, his argument actually seems to have been quite effi cient in pressuring Jo Di Mambro.48 An excellent book partly advocating that thesis (while not excluding other factors) has been written by John R. Hall (with Philip D. Schuyler and Sylvaine Trinh), ApocalypseObserved: Religious Movements and Violence in North America, Europe, and Japan, London/New York 2000. A well-researched book about Aum Shinrikyo, by one of the leading experts on that case, strongly emphasizes the role of internal factors (Ian Reader, Religious Violence in Contemporary Japan: The Case of Aum Shinrikyo, Richmond 2000).49 Convinced members who had been “left behind” felt that the order was entirely misunderstood and vilifi ed by the rest of the world."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Dangers of Enlightenment101leaving the earthly spheres seems to emerge strongly in the months and years after the order met its fi rst serious internal dissent, with the departure of people who had belonged to the communal core.Several facts tend to confi rm this interpretation. First, while the documents sent to the media in October 1994 heavily criticize some outsiders, there seems never to have been any attempt by the group to commit violent action against those who had exposed it in the media:50 it reserved its wrath for “traitors” who once belonged to the order. Obviously, in the dualistic worldview of the Solar Temple, people belonging to the profane world could not be considered in the same way as those initiates who once knew the truth, but had then abandoned the movement. Another striking indication that the leaders had been strongly affected by “apostasies” or alleged “treasons” consists in the fact that, in the very last days of his life, at a time when several members had already perished, Di Mambro still wrote drafts of two letters (dated 3 October 1994), denouncing two former members to the Attorney General, accusing them of having blackmailed him. This shows how strongly Di Mambro may have resented this “treason.” In addition, there are clear indications that, during the last weekend of his life, he tried (unsuccessfully) to lure into his chalet the fi rst person who, years earlier, had left the communal core of the group. If the man had accepted the invitation, he would certainly have become one of the victims.7) Whatever the role of ideological and other factors, the psychology of the leader will play a decisive role in the evolution of a group toward violence.The fact that Di Mambro felt he had the right to decide about life and death, as well as the fact that he apparently did not realize how incongruous the idea was of denouncing former members to the Attorney General at a time when he himself had already caused several of his followers to lose their lives, also shows that the founder of the movement had lost touch with reality. While the popular perception that members of a “cult” must be “crazy” or at best “bizarre” is an oversimplifi cation, and while it is no less certain that most members of the order were capable of functioning in a perfectly normal way in the “profane” world, a case like Di Mambro’s also shows that mental unbalance may play a role in such violent behavior. In addition, it seems quite likely that a dangerous interaction developed between Di Mambro and Jouret, which contributed to the violent outcome.8)In some cases, violent and spectacular actions are meant to prove something to the world and to have an impact on the general public. Media recognition 50 However, it cannot be ruled out that, with a slightly different set of circumstances, the order’s leaders might have decided to act against outsiders. A former member I talked to in November 1988—well before the events—reported, with some concern, to have heard Jouret declare at an internal meeting in 1986: “Last time, they got rid of the Templars; next time, we will act in such a way that we get rid of them!” I tend to think that the border between internal and external violence is a thin one."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple102may be an important element in the eyes of such groups, even if they would not acknowledge it openly and may not even be fully conscious of it.Such a psychological mindset also explains that what appears to us as a desperate escape may actually be interpreted in quite different terms by the group, or at least by its leaders. The transit was indeed—as Susan Palmer suggested—a “drastic solution” to counter the “loss of charisma,”51 but it was more than that: it was a supreme statement to the world. Di Mambro and his followers undoubtedly claimed to be above the rest of the world, but several elements in their behavior indicate that they also wanted the world to pay attention and to recognize them for what they considered themselves to be. Otherwise, why would they have cared to prepare mailings to a number of media organizations before their death? Why would they have tried to explain what they did and why? Why would they have wanted to leave behind their own legend? In several reports I have already quoted an amazing (tape-recorded) discussion within the core group, in which Di Mambro boasts that the order would do something “more spectacular” than Waco. Why should it be more spectacular, if not for proving something to the world? Di Mambro looks like a modern replica of Erostrates, who set fi re to the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus (fourth century BCE) in order to make his name famous—and, like Erostrates, he succeeded to some extent, by making the headlines.52 At last, a stunned world is compelled to listen. Even if the price is his own life and the destruction of his fl ock, the presence of the prophet fi nally becomes acknowledged in some way.While I tend to believe that media coverage (if not one-sided and ridiculing the group) may play a preventive role in defusing potentially tense situations before they reach the stage of confrontation, since it gives a feeling of recognition (“at last people are paying attention to our message!”), it is more diffi cult to assess the consequences if the media enter the fi eld once the violent scenario has already been launched.Conclusion53If ten years ago I had been asked which of the religious groups I had met might commit suicides or homicides, the Solar Temple would certainly not have sprung to mind. Even with the same ideology and in the same circumstances, people other than 51 S. Palmer, “Purity and Danger”, p. 315.52 One is reminded here of remarks made by Mark Juergensmeyer about the theatrical nature of religious terrorism: he speaks of “performance violence” and comments that such acts are intended to make “a symbolic statement” (Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence, Berkeley 2000, p. 126).53 This conclusion was originally written with an audience of law enforcement agents in mind, and primarily attempts to address their needs and questions."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Dangers of Enlightenment103Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret might not have lapsed into violence.54 Ideological factors are certainly not to be neglected, since people will not take their own lives as well as the lives of others without having some well-developed doctrinal arguments for justifying such action.55 However, except in those cases where religious messages clearly call for murder or subversive activities, it remains diffi cult to deduce from teachings the probability of violence. One of the few serious indications is a previous use of violence or an inclination toward means allowing violence. After a case like the Solar Temple, if a leader were to incite his followers to take shooting lessons, or tried to acquire guns, I would defi nitely feel concerned.As we have seen, we can draw lessons from past events, and they may allow us to better understand the dynamics leading to a violent outcome.56 But we should also be careful not to become over-zealous in the identifi cation of potentially dangerous groups. Driven by the legitimate desire to prevent a repetition of such tragedies, we might end up seeing such groups at every street corner and misinterpret purely rhetorical statements—and an overabundance of “suspects” would fi nally render any preventive action an impossible task! Before 1994, I had never received any request asking me if there was a danger of collective suicide in some group; nowadays such questions are not unusual. This should also make us aware of another risk in our analytical work: we should not be overimpressed by the way events have unfolded in the past. While future actions may be inspired to some extent by widely reported ones that have taken place before, we should keep in mind that they may equally well follow entirely different patterns. Before October 1994, the story of the Solar Temple would have sounded like a bad novel. Unfortunately, some spiritual leaders can obviously become quite imaginative when devising such plans; accordingly, if we want our scenarios and analyses to be of some use, they should not only avoid becoming paranoid, but should also remain suffi ciently fl exible and open to deal adequately with unexpected or surprising developments.54 While clearly not in the leading position, Jouret nevertheless played an important role in the “assisted suicides” due to his medical knowledge; during the investigation, a notice written by him was found, with indications about narcotic substances to be used. In addition, he showed some fascination with violence.55 The power of an ideology over the minds of followers can certainly be remarkable: if more members of the Solar Temple took their lives in December 1995 and in March 1997, long after the founder was gone, it is certainly not because they were compelled to do so, but because the message made sense and remained convincing in their eyes.56 During a research trip to Uganda in August 2000 to investigate the case of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God (several hundred victims in March 2000), I was amazed to see how some facts would make sense analogically for somebody familiar with other cases of religious violence."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Chapter 6Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence: The Case of the Order of the Solar TempleJohn WallissIntroductionIn the early hours of 5 October 1994, police were called to investigate a fi re in a farmhouse on the outskirts of the small village of Cheiry, Switzerland, inside which fi refi ghters had discovered the body of a man lying on a bed. The man, Albert Giacobino, had apparently been shot and then had a plastic bag placed over his head. Searching outside, the police discovered a removable wall in a garage that led to a room which had been converted into a makeshift temple. This, they found, contained a further 18 bodies, dressed in ceremonial robes and arranged in a circle like spokes on a wheel, heads facing outwards. Like Giacobino, most had plastic bags over their heads and most had been shot. Close by, in a mirrored, octagonal chamber and in a small room they discovered a further four bodies. Everywhere they looked, the police found canisters of propane gas and bags of petrol linked up to detonation devices which, for technical reasons, had not gone off.While the police were making their grim discovery at Cheiry, similar fi res erupted 60 km away at Les Granges-sur-Salvan in three holiday chalets belonging to Camille Pilet, a retired sales director of the Piaget watch company, and Luc Jouret and Joseph Di Mambro, both of whom were leaders of an occult group, l’Ordre du Temple Solaire (The Order of the Solar Temple, or OTS). Inside two of the chalets police found 25 charred bodies along with the remains of explosive devices similar to those found at Cheiry and a pistol which, it was later determined, had been used to kill the 23 Cheiry victims. Outside, a further link between the two events was discovered: a car registered to Joel Egger, a resident of the Cheiry farmhouse.These incidents were quickly linked with another fi re that had occurred approximately 6,000 miles away in Quebec, Canada. Here, on the morning of 4 October, only hours before the Swiss deaths, fi res had engulfed a condominium complex owned by Pilet, Jouret, Di Mambro, and a woman called Dominique Bellaton. During their subsequent examinations, the police found the bodies of a Swiss couple, Gerry and Colette Genoud, along with those of Antonio and Nicky"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple106Robinson Dutoit and their three-month-old son, Christopher Emmanuel. Autopsies determined that although the Genouds had perished in the fi re, the Dutoits had met a more violent end: Antonio Dutoit had been stabbed 50 times in the back; his wife eight times in the back, four times in the throat and once in each breast; while their son had, according to police reports, been “bled white” as a result of having being stabbed in the chest six times. These latter deaths, the police also determined, had taken place several days before the fi re (Hall et al. 2000).The deaths, however, were not to end there. Over a year later, on the winter solstice, the bodies of a further 16 Solar Temple members, including three children, were found dead in a wooded area near Grenoble, France. As was the case at Cheiry, the victims were arranged in a star formation and, autopsies revealed that all had been drugged and shot before their bodies were burned. Moreover, some of the deceased had left notes behind about going “to see another world” (Mayer 1998; Wessinger 2000a). Finally (or, at least one assumes so), in March 1997, fi ve more bodies were discovered in a house in Saint Casimir, Quebec. One of the deceased had been suffocated with a plastic bag while the others had died in the fi re that engulfed the property (Introvigne 2002). Shortly after the fi rst set of deaths, letters purporting to be from the Solar Temple were received by a number of journalists, scholars, and government offi cials. Aside from outlining aspects of the Solar Temple’s beliefs, these “Testaments” or “transit letters” offered an insight into the motives behind the group’s actions. Those who had died, whether voluntarily or with assistance,1 had done so in order to travel to Sirius where, it was believed, they would assume glorious “solar bodies.” Moreover, the Testaments also issued a call to other Solar Temple members to join them—a call which was evidently taken: Men, cry not over our fate, but rather cry for your own. Ours is more enviable than yours. To you who are receptive to this last message, may our Love and our Peace accompany you during the terrible tests of the Apocalypse that await you. Know that from where we will be, we will always hold our arms open to receive those who are worthy of joining us (“To All Those Who can Still Understand the Voice of Wisdom ... We Address this Last Message”).Although the spectacular nature of the OTS’s self-destruction is both fascinating and curious in and of itself, what makes it particularly interesting is that it occurred at all. 1 It was later (1996) determined by the Swiss magistrate investigating the Solar Temple deaths that only 15 of the 53 deaths in Switzerland and Quebec were in fact true suicides. These represented a core group of people who saw themselves as “The Awakened.” The remaining deaths fell into two categories; 30 people, dubbed “the Immortals,” who had apparently been lured to a ritual, drugged and then shot; and eight individuals had been executed as “traitors” (Lewis 2005). It is, of course, impossible to determine how many of “the Immortals” were simply aware of what was happening and were “assisted” in their deaths, and how many were simply tricked and murdered. For a discussion, see Palmer (1996), Introvigne (2002), Mayer (2003 [1999])."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence107From the very beginning the OTS leadership had always held to an apocalyptic vision of the future, believing that the Earth would be destroyed in the near future through some kind of ecological disaster. Drawing on his work in homeopathy, Luc Jouret had claimed in his public lectures that just as disease is a sign of some underlying sickness of the body, pollution is the exterior manifestation of a sickness within planet Earth, which in a manner akin to James Lovelock (1979), he envisaged, as a living entity. Going further, he also spoke of how cataclysmic upheavals in nature were the manifestations of how the Earth was poised on the brink of ecological disaster (Mayer, 2005).2Nevertheless, despite this pessimistic vision, the Solar Temple’s message was optimistic, and, indeed, “fundamentally one of survival and not of death” (Mayer 1998: no pagination). Acknowledging that the planet had reached “the end of a cycle,” the order considered its mission to be that of gathering an elect group (referred to in some OTS documents as “Templars of the New Age”) who would survive the ecological apocalypse and inaugurate “the Kingdom of Aquarius” (Mayer 1998, 2001). In 1986, for example, the Order published two books entitled Survivre à l’An 2000 (Survival Beyond the Year 2000), the second volume of which dealt exclusively with “survivalist” themes such as how to survive in the aftermath of atomic, bacteriological and chemical warfare attacks (Introvigne 2000). Similarly, in the mid-1980s the OTS had established an “ark of survival” or “survival farm” in Canada, prompted by the belief that the area around Toronto in particular would experience less upheaval in the event of any environmental disaster because it was situated on a broad granite plate with a strong magnetic fi eld (Mayer 2003).Indeed, not only did the OTS leaders believe that they would survive the Apocalypse, but they also believed that they themselves would serve a role in the transition into the Aquarian Age. Those at the core of the OTS believed that they were an elect group of people who incarnated periodically on Earth to play key roles in the evolution of humanity. One female member, for example, who died in the 1995 transit, claimed that she had “lived since the most remote times,” adding that:the time which was given to me on planet earth is completed and I go back freely and willingly to the place from which I came at the beginnings of the times. Happiness fi lls me because I know that I have fulfi lled my duty and that I can bring back in peace and happiness my capitalised energy enriched through the experience which I have lived on this earth back to the source from which everything comes. (quoted in Mayer 1998: no pagination)2 This concern about the environment was also shared by Di Mambro and, it appears, by a number of the Solar Temple membership. According to Mayer, Di Mambro kept several video recordings of TV reports about ecological problems and, moreover, he and his wife considered listing an ecological organization in their will (Mayer 1998, 2003). Similarly, one female member who died in the 1995 “transit,” wrote in one letter, “I think that our planet is slowly dying and I will do everything possible in order to be with her until the end, insofar as it will be possible” (quoted in Mayer 1998: no pagination)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple108Why then did an ideology of survival eventually give way to one of death? Why did a group who had gone so far as to publish manuals for its members on how to survive in the aftermath of ABC (atomic, biological, chemical) warfare attacks eventually come to believe that their only chance of survival was to escape the earth prior to the Apocalypse? More importantly, why did the order come to believe that their only chance of survival lay in death? In this chapter, I intend to answer these questions by discussing the role of several “crises of charismatic authority” that occurred within the OTS in the early 1990s.3 These crises, I will show, played a crucial role in transforming OTS ideology from one of optimistic survivalism to a more pessimistic vision emphasizing the necessity of fl eeing earth prior to the Apocalypse, and, by extension, were instrumental in precipitating the 1994 transits.4Accounting for the TransitsIn the initial aftermath of the 1994 transits, a number of theories were put forward to explain the deaths. According to some conspiracy theories, for example, the OTS members had been murdered and their deaths made to look like suicides in order to cover up a deal made between President Carter and some extraterrestrials who had built an underground laboratory in Nevada (Palmer 1996; Chryssides 1999). Similarly, sections of the press claimed that the order had in fact been an elaborate front for Di Mambro and Jouret who, it was alleged, were international racketeers who had amassed $93 million in Australia alone through gun running, money- laundering and confi dence tricks.5 Going further, it was alleged that the transits were an attempt by both men to dispose of the order’s inner circle and make off with their ill-gotten gains. Other sections of the French-speaking press made immediate connections between the incident and other examples of “cult suicides.” Thus, in the week following the 1994 transits, leading Swiss French-language newspapers consistently applied the countercult stereotype to the incident; labeling the order a “cult,” dismissing its ideas as “fanaticism,” “delirium,” and the “manipulative ideas of a guru,” and describing members as “weak,” “marginal,”6 “sheeplike,” and 3 Several of these themes were initially presented in Walliss, J. (2004). 4 This is, of course, a separate question from what made this option convincing to those OTS members who went along with the transits voluntarily. See Chapter 8, this volume for a discussion of this issue.5 Interestingly, similar claims were also made about the Ugandan Movement for the Restoration for the Ten Commandments of God following their deaths in March 2000 (see Walliss, 2004, Chapter 6).6 Socially, the OTS members were, however, anything but marginal. At its peak (1989) the order had 442 members, the majority of whom were wealthy, educated, and infl uential members of the middle and upper classes. Among those who died in the 1994 transits, for example, were a mayor of a Quebec town, a wealthy Geneva businessman, a retired sales manager for the Swiss watch corporation Piaget, a high-ranking offi cial in the Quebec government, and a reporter for a Quebec newspaper (see Palmer 1996; Introvigne 2000; Wessinger 2000a; Chryssides 2005)."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence109“gullible.” It was also claimed that the members had been brainwashed by Jouret and Di Mambro (Campiche 1995; Introvigne 2000; Introvigne and Mayer 2002).If, however, we are to believe the material left behind by the OTS, the transits were a response to a very real sense of opposition and persecution—or “concentration of hate”—that the order felt it was encountering.7 In one audiotape, for example, recorded shortly before the transits, Di Mambro is heard to say: we are rejected by the whole world. First by the people, the people can no longer withstand us. And our earth, happily she rejects us. How could we leave [otherwise]? We also reject this planet. We wait for the day we can leave ... life for me is intolerable, intolerable, I can’t go on. So think about the dynamic that will get us to go elsewhere. (quoted in Wessinger 2000a: 225)Likewise, a fi le found on Di Mambro’s computer at Salvan reads:We don’t know when they might close the trap on us ... a few days? A few weeks? We are being followed and spied upon in our every move. All the cars are equipped with tracing and listening devices. All of their most sophisticated techniques are being used on us. While in our house, beware of surveillance cameras, lasers and infra-red. Our fi le is the hottest on the planet, the most important of the last ten years, if not the century. However that may be, as it turns out, the concentration of hate against us will give us enough energy to leave. (quoted in Wessinger 2000a: 218)These feelings of paranoia and persecution are further evinced in the Testaments. In one entitled “To Lovers of Justice,” and addressed “to those who, in this rotten world, remain devoted to justice and truth,” the authors rail against “the political-judicial scandal perpetuated against the Order of the Solar Temple ...,” claiming that Jouret and others “were the victims of slander and false accusations of the most sordid kind for many months ... .” Going further, it claims that several unnamed Solar Temple members were also “submitted to hateful harassment (lengthy interrogations, public arrests, blackmail, pressure from the mass media, the use of false documents ...). Not even their children were spared.” Indeed, toward the end of the document, the author(s) go so far as to link the persecution encountered by the order with the existence of a New World Order conspiracy:We affi rm that to conceal their political, economical, social, and police bankruptcy, governments use the same means and process of misinformation, intimidation and manipulation as those that were used in the blackest periods of history. It is suffi cient to note all the futile, lying and useless distortions of international authorities concerning current confl icts in the world, in order to convince oneself of the existence of a secret evil organization on a worldwide scale, highly supported fi nancially, and determined to silence or destroy all those who would be likely to interfere with their interests. Warned a long time ago of the existence of this order, we have managed to frustrate their plans 7 This view has also been expressed in several academic discussions of the OTS. See in particular Hall et al. (2000) and Bromley (2002)."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple110concerning us. Thus, despite everything and beyond appearances, the authentic bearers of an ancestral wisdom have been able to perpetuate the Work.However, although the OTS leadership may have felt that they were persecuted, in reality they received nowhere near the amount of opposition intimated in the above documents. As Mayer observes: “compared with other controversial groups, the Solar Temple encountered very modest opposition; it would be excessive to use the term ‘persecution’, despite what the group’s spiritual testament would have us believe” (Mayer 2003: 217; see also Introvigne 2000: 155; Robbins 2002: 60).8In 1991, Rose-Marie Klaus, the wife of an OTS member, contacted Info-Secte, a Montreal anticult organization with links to the Cult Awareness Network (CAN). Klaus told them about her separation from her husband, Bruno, who had joined another member in a “cosmic marriage,” and how she was attempting to recoup some of the money that she and her husband had donated to the OTS’s Quebec “Ark.” She did not, however, provide enough corroboration or detail for Info-Secte to go public with any accusations. Shortly afterwards, however, Info-Secte received a letter from the president of the Martinique branch of the Association pour la Défense des Familles et de l’Individu (ADFI), requesting information about the OTS. The letter discussed Jouret and the OTS connection with another neo-Templar, Julien Origas (“alias Humbert de Frankembourgde, former head of the Gestapo at Brest”), claiming that the OTS leaders “sit at the extreme right of God.” Going further, it described OTS beliefs regarding planetary catastrophe and expressed concern that several wealthy Martiniquans had sold their worldly goods, left their families, and had moved to Quebec to construct an “arch” [sic] to the new world. Klaus replied to the letter and the following year was invited to Martinique to speak out at various events against the OTS, prompting a number of Martiniquans to go to Canada and demand that the money that they invested in the “Ark” be returned (Hall et al. 2000; Introvigne 2000).At the same time as Klaus was attacking the OTS in Martinique, several members of the Canadian parliament received death threats from a mysterious terrorist group calling itself Q-37 (allegedly because it included 37 members from Quebec). By a cruel twist of fate, around the time that police were investigating these threats, Jouret asked two OTS members, Jean-Pierre Vinet and Hermann Delorme, to buy three semi-automatic guns with silencers for him. One of the dealers they approached, however, was a police informer and both men were arrested in March 1992 and charged, along with Jouret, with purchasing illegal fi rearms. Although, at the subsequent trial all three men received light sentences (a fi ne of $1,000 each and one year’s unsupervised probation), the incident triggered international police investigations into various aspects of OTS affairs (Hall et al. 2000). 8 For example, in 1984, Jouret had two lines written about him in an anticult movement booklet. Both he and the OTS, however, were omitted from the 1987 edition (Mayer, 2003; Hall et al. 2000)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence111In this way, the OTS leadership did have some grounds for feeling that things were not going as well as they would have liked. One would be hard pressed, however, to claim that they were experiencing anywhere near the level of opposition which they claimed. While the OTS was the subject of a number of international police investigations, it was surely an exaggeration on their part to believe that their “fi le [was] the hottest on the planet, the most important of the last ten years, if not the century” and that “all of their most sophisticated [surveillance] techniques are being used on us.” Indeed, Claude Ryan, one of the politicians singled out as a target for the Q-37 plot, apparently rejected any such requests that “religious sects” should be the target of “organized surveillance of a police nature.” Such groups were, he claimed, “perfectly legal and principled” and, as such, “have the right to exist, as have all kinds of associations” (quoted in Mayer 2001c: 446). Why, then, did a level of cultural opposition experienced by a number of New Religious Movements lead the OTS to react in such an extreme way? Crises of Charismatic AuthorityThe answer to this question, I would argue, lies within the OTS leadership itself, and relates to several crises of charismatic authority that Jouret and Di Mambro were experiencing at this time—crises which served to exacerbate the effects of any criticism or opposition they encountered. Charismatic authority, as Max Weber and more recently Roy Wallis (1982, 1983) have argued, is by its nature precarious in that it “exist[s] only in the process of originating” and thus is “constantly being proved” (Weber 1947: 364; 1991: 248). In contrast to traditional or legal-rational forms of authority, charismatic authority thus requires constant “legitimation work.” When this does not occur—when, for example, the leader is unable to offer “signs of the miraculous” or feels “forsaken by his God”—(s)he may thus be said to have experienced a “crisis of charismatic authority”. In such situations, the potential for volatility increases (see Dawson 2002).In the last years of its existence the OTS was undermined by several such crises, all of which in combination served to undermine both its leaders’ authority and, by extension, its “millennial goal” (Wessinger 2000a). Jouret’s reputation, for example, was irrevocably damaged through his connection with the handgun incident and he subsequently found it increasingly diffi cult to lecture again on the New Age circuit. This not only closed off the OTS’s main avenue of recruitment and income, but also affected Jouret personally. As one member later recalled, following the incident “his mind changed, he was a tired, tired, tired, disappointed, disillusioned person” (quoted in Hall et al. 2000: 135). Police wiretaps of Jouret also, according to Mayer (2003: 215), show that he “was in a depressed mood, constantly complaining about feeling tired and expressing eagerness to leave the world.” Di Mambro was also experiencing a similar loss of charismatic authority, although his stemmed from more natural causes. Approaching his 70th year in the early 1990s, he was not in good health; not only was he suffering from kidney failure (and had to wear incontinence"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple112pads), but he had also contracted diabetes, and begun to experience diabetic fi ts. He had also been diagnosed with cancer (Palmer 1996; Wessinger 2000a).Jouret and Di Mambro were also experiencing similar crises on several other related fronts. In 1990, Di Mambro’s 29-year-old son, Elie (Elio), discovered that the various supernatural apparitions that appeared during OTS rituals were in fact faked through the use of lasers, slides, and light and sound effects operated by a member called Antonio Dutoit. Dutoit confi rmed that this was indeed the case and then left the order; Elie then began to speak about what he had discovered to all who would listen (Palmer 1996; Wessinger 2000a; see also Harriss 1997 for a discussion of some of the items used). Although the fakery was explained as “an unfortunate but necessary way to keep weaker souls within the fold” by some members (Introvigne 2000: 151), many others, already embarrassed by the gun incident, defected and demanded a refund of money they had invested in the order. As one member wrote to Di Mambro late in 1993: Rumours about embezzlement and various [forms] of skulduggery are propagated by infl uential ex-members. Many members ... have left or are leaving. They feel their ideals have been betrayed ... It is even said that you have fallen because of money and women, and you’re no longer credible. This is very serious for the Order’s mission. There are even more serious grumblings, and you know them. Here they are: everything we saw and heard in certain places has been a trick. I have known this for some time. Tony [Dutoit] has been talking about this for years already ... I have always refused to pay attention to these rumours, but the evidence is growing, and questions are being asked. This calls into question many things I’ve seen, and messages. I would be really upset if I had to conclude that I’d sincerely prostrated myself in front on an illusion!!! (Quoted in Mayer 2003: 212–13)If this were not bad enough, Di Mambro was also having diffi culties with another of his children, the 12-year-old “cosmic child” Emmanuelle. Raised from birth to be the avatar of the New Age, by 1993 Emmanuelle had become what Wessinger (2000b: 28) refers to as “a messiah diffi cult to deal with”; not only was she rejecting her cosmically assigned role, but she was also becoming unruly and expressing an interest in teenage pop culture. She was also, Di Mambro believed, under threat from the Antichrist, who had been born to Antonio and Nicky Dutoit in the summer of 1994. Following a miscarriage, Di Mambro had forbidden Nicky Dutoit to bear children. However, after leaving the OTS and moving to Quebec, she had given birth to a son who was named Christopher Emmanuel. Viewing this as a double affront to his authority, Di Mambro is said to have ordered that the family be “symbolically executed” shortly before the 1994 transits by Joel Egger, with the Genouds as his accomplices (Palmer 1996; Hall et al. 2000)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence113DiscussionThe decision by the OTS leadership to abandon its belief in survivalism in favor of an ethos emphasizing the necessity of escaping from Earth through death prior to the Apocalypse, may thus be seen as a clear response to a feeling of persecution, exacerbated by the effects of several crises of charismatic authority within the order. At around the time that the order came to the attention of the authorities, Di Mambro’s metaphysical world was beginning to collapse around him. Not only was he seriously ill, but his charisma had been thoroughly undermined by the revelations of technological fakery and the subsequent defections. It was also becoming more and more apparent to those within the order that Di Mambro was not in contact with occult masters, hidden deep beneath Zurich as he claimed. If this were not bad enough, Di Mambro had also been exposed as a fraud by his own son, and the child that he and the order had raised to be the avatar of the New Age was not only rejecting her messianic mission in favor of teenage pop culture, but was also—he believed—in danger from the three-month-old Dutoit “Antichrist.” Defections were also crippling the order fi nancially and undermining everything that he and Jouret had sought to achieve. In this way, the highly ritualized nature of the transits can also be understood as an attempt by Jouret and Di Mambro to salvage some honor by producing a charismatic display or symbolic gesture to the world (Palmer 1996; Mayer 2003). For example, Mayer quotes the following audio-recording of a conversation between Jouret and Di Mambro made shortly before the transits: Di Mambro: People have beaten us to the punch, you know.Jouret: Well, yeah. Waco beat us to the punch.Di Mambro: In my opinion, we should have gone six months before them ... what we’ll do will be even more spectacular.(Mayer 1998: no pagination; emphasis added)Through their fi ery deaths, he argues, the OTS leadership hoped, like the original Knights Templar, to create an enduring legend for themselves: Joseph Di Mambro, Luc Jouret, and those who, over the course of months, methodically prepared their own deaths and the deaths of dozens of others were quite concerned about the impact their departure would have on the public mind and spent many hours creating a kind of legend that would survive their earthly exit. Why else would they have felt the need to send manifestos justifying post mortem their decision not only to order members but also to television stations, newspapers, and some other correspondents ...[?] (Mayer 2003: 208).On one level, the transits may thus be conceptualized as an example of what Mark Juergensmeyer terms “performance violence.” According to Juergensmeyer, while"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple114on one level such acts of spectacular violence are “performative acts, insofar as they try to change things,” on another level “such instances of exaggerated violence” may also be conceptualized as actions intended to make a symbolic statement to their audience:The very adjectives used to describe acts of religious terrorism—symbolic, dramatic, theatrical—suggest that we look at them not as tactics but as performance violence. In speaking of terrorism as “performance violence”, I am not suggesting that such acts are undertaken lightly or capriciously. Rather, like religious ritual or street theatre, they are dramas designed to have an impact on the several audiences that they affect. Those who witness the violence—even at a distance, via the news media—are therefore part of what occurs. Moreover, like other forms of public ritual, the symbolic signifi cance of such events is multifaceted; they mean different things to different observers. (Juergensmeyer, 2001: 124, 122; italics in original)Similarly, Mayer notes how, in some cases, “staging a spectacular action allows a small group to attract the attention of the world and may to some extent be intended to reach that goal” (Mayer 2003: 365). In particular, he goes on, “a spectacular action may ... [alongside other motives] ... constitute a tempting option for a group that is experiencing decline or has not met the success for which it had hoped” (emphasis added). From this perspective, the transits may thus be seen as one last spectacular ritualistic gesture to the world, through which the OTS leadership could reassert their authority over their followers and create some kind of legend for the order. On another level, the transits may also be viewed as an attempt to save the many secrets and, indeed, “secrets within secrets” on which the group was built. As one unnamed source, cited by Palmer observes:The suicide was organised to save their secrets. The whole group was built on everyone having secrets—secrets within secrets. Every time the police came to Morin Heights, members trembled lest they stumble upon the crypt in the basement, or desecrate their sacred temples and brotherhood rooms in Geneva. One word to the wrong source, one traitor or indiscretion, and all their secrets might be revealed. (Palmer 1996: 314)From this perspective, then, the transits were thus also “a purifi cation ritual that guarded OTS secrets and preserved their magical energy” (ibid.). Two main pieces of evidence would seem to support this view. Primarily, the transit fi res were supposed to destroy all evidence of the OTS, including even the bodies of the members, leaving behind only the Testaments as their legacy (Mayer 2003). Indeed, one of the Testaments expresses a fear of “our bodies ... being soiled by frantic lunatics.” Second, drawing on the conclusions of the magistrate who investigated the 1994 deaths, Palmer (1996) notes that they were organized in a highly ritualized way, designed to progressively “seal” the OTS “core” in three stages. Primarily, the ritual “execution” of the apostate Dutoits at Morin Heights effectively “sealed” the outer, most “polluted” layer. Following on from this, “the middle ring of fi re at Cheiry included those whose purity/pollution status was mixed or ambiguous” (ibid.) and who had to be assisted in taking their lives. Finally, the inner, most awakened/pure"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Crises of Charismatic Authority and Millenarian Violence115members, such as Di Mambro, Jouret, and Bellaton, consciously took their own lives at Les Granges-sur-Salvan.ConclusionsIn their discussion of the OTS, Introvigne and Mayer warn against focusing on one single factor in accounting for the murder-suicides. Rather, they argue, the deaths were the result of four key factors working in combination: “[a] predisposing apocalyptic ideology, perception of external opposition, internal dissent and apostasy, and crumbling charismatic authority of the leader” (Introvigne and Mayer 2002: 178). Indeed, although acknowledging that an emphasis on the role of crises of charismatic authority “has its merits” in understanding the initial murder-suicides, they argue—rightly in my view—that such an explanation is of little or no use in understanding the subsequent suicides. Rather, and again I would agree with them on this, the subsequent suicides may be better understood as a consequence of external opposition. As one member, for example, who took his life in the 1997 suicides wrote to his family:We have been hunted down like dogs because what we were telling, what we are relating, disturbs at a high level ... we are relieved to know that we as well as our children will no more have to endure the craziness of this earthly world. Don’t believe anything that you read about us. (quoted in Mayer 1998: no pagination)However, conversely, I would argue that external opposition by itself is of little or no use in understanding the motivation for the initial transits. Rather, while not discounting the role of perceived external opposition, the focus of attention should be more on the role of internal pressures in precipitating the initial murder-suicides, not least because the OTS’s ideology began to develop in the direction of fl eeing planet Earth prior to the experience of cultural opposition. As Mayer notes, “the idea of there being no other way than leaving the earthly spheres seems to emerge strongly in the months and years after the order met its fi rst serious internal dissent, with people leaving it who had belonged to the communal core” (Mayer 2001: 447–8). It is also noteworthy, he argues, that the order did not lash out at any of its perceived enemies in the outside world—as did, for example, Aum Shinrikyo or the People’s Temple—but rather reserved their wrath for those deemed to be “traitors” (or “the bastards who have betrayed us,” as Di Mambro refers to them on one audio recording made shortly before the transits [Mayer 1998]), such as the Dutoits. These internal pressures—most, if not all, of which were fundamentally bound up with the progressive undermining of Di Mambro and Jouret’s charismatic authority—distorted the OTS leaders’ perception of the outside world, leading them to see affronts, opposition, plots, and conspiracies where arguably there were none, and to radically revise their view of salvation. Rather than seeking to survive the ecological apocalypse, they would, instead, abandon the world to its fate and effect a transit “with all lucidity and in full consciousness” to their home in the stars. There,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple116according to Testament Transit to the Future, they will await “favorable conditions for a possible Return.” As another of the Testaments, The Rose+Croix, enigmatically suggests, “The Rose+Croix has defi nitely not fi nished surprising you”:Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed and everything is renewed in a Space–Time continuum. Alternately hunted down and adulated, the Immortal Rose+Croix will follow its path more than ever. Its mission will remain forever and ever. (See Appendix 1)"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Chapter 7Sources of Doctrine in the Solar TempleGeorge D. ChryssidesExplaining mass death within a religion is not easy, especially where some degree of voluntariness appears to have been involved. Survival, rather than self-destruction, is a basic human instinct. When mass deaths occur within religions—and the frequency of their occurrences has been much exaggerated by the anticult movement—they must either be involuntary acts of murder, or else they must be forms of suicide where the victims have been persuaded that death will be highly advantageous. Explaining the deaths in the Solar Temple is problematic, since the extent of the participants’ voluntariness is unclear. Plainly, it is not possible to commit suicide with several bullet wounds in one’s own head; yet the circumstances of the deaths in Cheiry and Granges-sur-Salvan in 1994 indicate that the members were taking part in a ritual, and the dress and the position of the corpses indicate an absence of resistance or attempt to escape.Although mainstream Christianity, particularly in its Protestant evangelical forms, emphasizes the importance of orthodox belief, many new religious movements—as well as old ones—do not attach such importance to maintaining creedal orthodoxy or doctrinal consistency. In his analysis of religion, Ninian Smart (1995) identifi ed a number of elements—or “dimensions,” as he called them—which make up a religion: the doctrinal, the mythological, the experiential, the ethical, the ritual, and the social-institutional. Of these six dimensions, the ritual and the experiential were arguably the most important to the Order of the Solar Temple (Ordre du Temple Solaire, or OTS), access to these being controlled by the movement’s social-institutional spiritual hierarchy. Doctrines were relegated to a secondary role; as Susan Palmer, following Mary Douglas’s typology, puts it, the OTS exemplifi ed “strong group, weak grid” (Palmer 1996: 304).It is possible that the group thrived on ceremony without any strong doctrinal underpinning, and it has been suggested that the multiple deaths are capable of being explained without reference to the group’s teachings. Thus, Susan Palmer suggests that its leader Joseph Di Mambro experienced a loss of personal charisma as a result of his deteriorating health and internal confl icts within the organization. Certainly the OTS had encountered problems. Within its own ranks, Antonio (Tony) Dutoit,—who had taken sole responsibility for the technology that created the remarkable apparitions in the OTS’s underground chamber in Cheiry—had affi rmed that they had merely a natural technological explanation, and were not authentic appearances of Ascended Masters. He had left the organization in 1991, although he continued to provide technological support to the OTS. His new-born son had been"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple118named Immanuel, as a rival to Di Mambro’s offspring Emmanuelle, who had been regarded as the “cosmic child,” and Di Mambro had designated the Dutoit infant as the Antichrist. In the same year, Lucien Zecler of the Association for the Defense of Families and Individuals (ADFI—the leading French anticult organization) had commenced inquiries concerning the movement. In Martinique and Canada, the OTS had received negative media publicity, and in 1993 two OTS members, together with the co-leader Luc Jouret, had been arrested and convicted for buying handguns. Three members who had become disenchanted with the Solar Temple had wanted refunds of their fi nancial input over the years, and one member had evidently been blackmailing Di Mambro. It is possible, therefore, that Di Mambro’s solution to these mounting problems was to put an end both to himself and to the organization.Introvigne and Mayer (2002) question this explanation, pointing out that the subsequent deaths in 1995 and 1997 occurred after Di Mambro’s death. (Sixteen members died in similar circumstances at Vercors, Grenoble, on 23 December 1995, and a further fi ve were found dead at Saint-Casimir, Quebec on 21 March 1997.) Indeed, although the Solar Temple attracted some opposition and faced these problems in 1994, a proposed solution entailing either collective suicide or mass murder seems seriously disproportionate.Equally, attempts to explain the deaths by “brainwashing,” “mind control” or guru manipulation are implausible. The Solar Temple was not a “typical cult”: it did not attract the vulnerable or the dispossessed. Instead, supporters tended to be drawn from the higher echelons of society, and included successful business people, an orchestral conductor, and a mayor. Although the OTS’s premises at Salvan and Cheiry were somewhat remote, the community itself was not isolated: although Di Mambro’s earlier organization, the Golden Way Foundation, facilitated community living, the house was in a Genevan suburb and hosted meetings for non-members, and those who participated in the ceremonies at Cheiry and Salvan combined the OTS’s activities with pursuit of their own secular work.Social science tends to look for “causes” of human behavior. However, although natural and social environment have some bearing on the outcome of human events, it seems likely that the Solar Temple’s worldview had a much greater role in these events, and that the group’s key ideas resulted in their “exit.” As Mayer writes:the fact that several more members chose the same way to die (i.e. “transit” to another world, as they euphemistically described their deaths) at a later time demonstrates how strong the doctrinal justifi cation had succeeded in becoming in the eyes of some followers. (in Partridge 2004: 348)In what follows, I shall argue that there is a clearly identifi able worldview associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and that the intellectual and spiritual pedigree of the group can help to explain the notorious collective deaths of 1994, 1995, and 1997."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple119The Beliefs of the Solar TempleOutlining the beliefs of the Solar Temple is problematical for several reasons. Firstly, it was an esoteric group, and it is diffi cult to ascertain the beliefs of a group whose teachings can only be understood through privileged access. Such access was through what Massimo Introvigne calls a “Chinese box” system: initially one joined the Amenta Club (subsequently known simply as Amenta), progressing through the Archedia Club to the International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition (OICST). It seems likely that most of the dead belonged to the ranks of the spiritually most adept: of the 53 dead at Morin Heights, Cheiry, and Salvan, 15 appear to have been “awakened ones” and 30 “immortals.” If this is so, then members left behind were those who lacked access to the key ideas of the group; and additionally, because of the stigma now attached to being an OTS member, most are reluctant to talk about their experiences. Inevitably, conspiracy theories abound: one such theory is that the deaths were part of a CIA cover-up; the subterranean chambers were really built by extraterrestrials, and the then US President Jimmy Carter wished to ensure that word did not get out!Notwithstanding these problems that hamper serious investigation, a number of sources remain available to us, and can enable us to reconstruct the Order of the Solar Temple’s worldview. Both Di Mambro and Jouret were associated with several Templarist and Rosicrucian organizations, whose ideas and practices can be readily ascertained. Additionally, material is available in the “transit letters” (otherwise known as the “Testaments”)—communications sent to the media by a small number of members before the deaths took place. The Swiss historian of religion Jean-François Mayer, who had been researching the group before the notorious incidents, attended some of Jouret’s lectures, and has published material drawing on their content. Of course, it is also important to acknowledge the existence of religious creativity: new movements do not simply reiterate the teachings of parent organizations, and the fact that the OTS was the only neo-Templarist organization to bring about these multiple deaths indicates that its leaders added their own distinctive contribution to the group’s spiritual pedigree.The rudimentary ideas and history of the OTS are fairly widely known. It was taught that a Blue Star appeared some 26,000 years ago. This star—Sirius—was the home of a number of Ascended Masters, also known as the Great White Brotherhood, who came to earth, and inhabited a subterranean spiritual realm known as Agartha. These Masters are essentially souls, but can occasionally manifest themselves in corporeal form: in the underground chambers of the Solar Temple privileged members could be granted the opportunity to witnesses these epiphanies, although it is beyond doubt that the visions afforded to these initiated members were the ingenious creations of Antonio Dutoit, an expert in the production of holographic images. Like the Masters, humans are inherently souls rather than bodies, and the bodies they possess are temporary abodes: on death the soul moves on from one corporeal manifestation to another. Thus reincarnation was one of the OTS’s key tenets, a process to which Ascended Masters and humans alike were subject. Luc Jouret"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple120claimed to be a reincarnation of St Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Knights Templar, and Joseph Di Mambro claimed various past incarnations, including one of the Egyptian Pharaohs, one of Jesus’ 12 disciples, the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus’ side at the crucifi xion, and Manatanus—one of the Ascended Masters. (It is not clear how it is possible for Di Mambro to have experienced two past existences with substantial temporal overlapping, the apostle and the Roman soldier: either this is a misunderstanding on the part of informants, or, equally plausibly, Di Mambro may have had little regard for doctrinal consistency.) A small spiritual elite could become capable of decorporealizing, according to their degree of initiation within the Temple; corresponding to the three levels of membership were three levels of initiation—initiates, awakened souls, and immortals.The history of the universe from the Blue Star’s appearance onward was held to be divided into a number of astrological ages. In common with many other occultist and New Age groups, the OTS held that the earth was on the cusp between the outgoing Age of Pisces and the dawning Age of Aquarius. This emergent New Age would herald an apocalypse, in which the Earth would be destroyed by fi re, and hence the group’s aim was to produce a communion of souls who would survive this fi ery ordeal. In order to achieve this aim, sex magic appears to have been involved. Sex magic entails the use of sexual activities to obtain spiritual benefi ts, and Di Mambro had an obvious interest in this area of the occult. One important rite within the Temple was “cosmic marriage”—a ceremony in which selected members were paired and underwent a ceremony which supposedly bonded their discarnate archetypal forms. Di Mambro underwent such a ceremony, in which he was bonded with Dominique Bellaton (1958–94), who was believed to be an incarnation of the Egyptian princess Hatshepsut.At this point messianic imagery appears to feature, although its exact role is far from clear. Di Mambro and Bellaton gave birth to a daughter, whom they named Emmanuelle (1982–94). This child was regarded as special, and was known as a “cosmic child” and sometimes as an “avatar.” Although biologically female, Emmanuelle was always referred to as “he”: it is said that the group held that spirits had no gender, although this is diffi cult to reconcile with ideas of cosmic marriage, or with the group’s concepts of Ascended Masters, who appear to be inherently gendered, and whose various incarnational manifestations appear to be gender-consistent. The precise salvifi c role of the cosmic child is unclear, but “he” appears to have been the object of extraordinary veneration by OTS members, with a unique role admitting no rival: Emmanuelle underwent a special baptism with water from the River Jordan and chrismal oil from Jerusalem. When Antonio and Nicky Dutoit, whom Di Mambro had forbidden to have children, gave birth to a son whom they named Immanuel, Di Mambro took great exception, and the child was referred to as the Antichrist. The Dutoits left the group in 1991, although Antonio continued to offer his technical support. Shortly before the mass deaths, the Dutoit family were hunted down, probably by Jouret, and were found dead in their homes. The baby had been stabbed repeatedly, and a stake nailed through his chest."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple121The Templar TraditionA search for explanations is plainly necessary, and in what follows I hope to show why the OTS leader thought it necessary for the group to end by death. In order to do this, I propose to look at a number of movements that had an important infl uence on the Temple. The most obvious of source of beliefs and practices is Templarism. The original Knights Templar were formally established by Pope Innocent II (1130–43), who gave them exemption from all earthly authority (except papal authority). The Cistercian Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) was appointed to lead the crusades against the Muslims, with the specifi c purpose of returning the City of Jerusalem to the Christians. The Templars provided the ancillary service of offering physical protection to Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem, since their journey was extremely hazardous. They offered particular protection for money, and became the fi rst European bank, offering the facility to deposit one’s wealth at one location and to collect it at another. After the crusades, the Templars returned to their chapters, and continued to engage in secret meetings and rites.The early fourteenth century marked a turn in the Templars’ fortunes. Having an eye on the wealth amassed by the Templars, Philip IV (“the Fair”) of France (1268–1314) conspired with the pope to disband the Templars as a means of appropriating their wealth. The Templars thus became the victims of conspiracy, being accused variously of heresy, blasphemy, and homosexuality. Pope Clement V (c.1264–1314) formally disbanded them in 1312 by his papal bull Vox in Excelso. A few remaining Templars relocated to Portugal; there they established the Order of Christ, but it is doubtful whether any line of succession exists from Jacques de Molay, the Templars’ last Grand Master, to the more recent Templar movement that was revived in the late eighteenth century.Although formally disbanded, many modern-day Templars claim that the movement lived on clandestinely. Some sources claim a covert lineage, while others claim that the emergent Freemasons provided a method of propagating the succession; others again maintain that the links between former and present-day Grand Masters are transmitted psychically rather than physically. This last explanation was the one favoured by the OTS and its precursors. The physician Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat (1773–1838) is regarded as the founder-leader of modern Templarism when the movement experienced a revival in the late eighteenth century. The French Revolution eliminated royal opposition to the movement, but ecclesiastical opposition prevailed. Fabré-Palaprat established his own rival “Johannite” Church, which was based on the teachings of a book entitled the Levitikon, a second-hand copy of which he claimed to have discovered and purchased at a Paris bookstall on New Year’s Day 1814. The Levitikonpurports to be authored by a fi fteenth-century Greek monk called Nicephorous, and is based on the Gospel of John, but omitting reference to Jesus’ resurrection, miracles, or messianic status. The book included a commentary entitled the Evangelikon, which made reference to Jesus’ “lost years”: he allegedly spent his youth in Egypt, where he became a priest of Isis and gained initiation into the Egyptian mysteries. Attempts were made to associate the “Johannite heresy”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple122with the Hospitallers—organizations that acted as auxiliaries during the crusades by offering care to sick or injured pilgrims.Fabré-Palaprat claimed to have discovered an unbroken lineage of Grand Masters, running from Jacques de Molay to himself. A “Charter of Transmission” had allegedly been discovered around this time, which named Jean M. Larmenius as successor to de Molay, and provided a coded set of signatures naming a line of descendants. Fabré-Palaprat secured ordination as an “irregular bishop”—that is to say, someone who is ordained in the Church’s apostolic session, and in the correct manner, but without the Church’s authority. Such ordinations are therefore considered “valid,” but not “legal”. As Introvigne observes, neo-Templarism thus became intertwined with various independent Christian-related organizations with irregular bishops. Luc Jouret, he believes, was probably not consecrated as an irregular bishop within these traditions, but was possibly an “irregular” priest.Theosophical StrandsOther important components of the Solar Temple’s ideas came from Theosophy, and perhaps more especially from Rosicrucianism. The two movements are interrelated, and cannot truly be disentangled when attempting to establish the Solar Temple’s sources.The infl uence of the Theosophical Society, although now considerably in decline, lives on in numerous emergent spiritual movements. Founded by “Madame” Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–91), Henry Steel Olcott (1832–1907), and William Q. Judge (1851–96), the Theosophical Society had the professed aims of investigating “unexplained laws of nature”—that is to say, paranormal powers with which individuals are endowed; additionally, its membership aimed to study “comparative religion, philosophy, and science.” Blavatsky’s early interests included ancient Egyptian religion, and her book Isis Unveiled (1877) combines ancient Egyptian ideas with those of Eastern spirituality. Blavatsky’s later work The Secret Doctrine(1888) was infl uenced substantially by her travels with Olcott across India and Ceylon, and draws largely on her knowledge of Hinduism and Buddhism which she acquired during that period, and which was not publicly known or disseminated in the West at that time. Blavatsky’s interest in ancient Egypt bears obvious importance for the subsequent development of the Rosicrucian movement, and hence for the ideas of the OTS.The Theosophical Society was also renowned for its belief in the Ascended Masters, another key concept within the Solar Temple. Blavatksy wrote about “mahatmas” or “adepts,” who were supernatural beings with whom she claimed to have established contact. These mahatmas were enlightened beings, now free from the cycle of birth and rebirth, but who chose to contact selected humans from their celestial abode in order to help humankind. They later came to be known as “Ascended Masters” or the “Great White Brotherhood.” Ascended Masters include leading fi gures from the Judaeo-Christian tradition—for example, Abraham, Moses,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple123Solomon, Jesus Christ, and the Virgin Mary—as well as leaders of other major religions, such as Lao Tsu (the founder of Taoism), Confucius, and the Buddha. Other celebrated human thinkers were regarded as enlightened: examples include Plato, Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), Roger Bacon (c.1214–92), and the magician-adventurer Alessandro Cagliostro (1743–95). Other Ascended Masters do not appear to have an accredited historical existence: Blavatsky claimed contact with Master Morya and Koot Hoomi (Kut Humi). One Ascended Master who features largely in the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), as well as several other spiritual groups infl uenced by it, is the Comte de Saint-Germain (c.1710–84). Saint-Germain appears to have been a Portuguese Jew, nicknamed “The Wonderman” on account of his remarkable adventures. He is believed to have been the founder of Freemasonry, into which he initiated Cagliostro. Among other accomplishments, he apparently was a chemist, renowned for his claim to have discovered secret methods for eliminating fl aws in diamonds, and for metamorphosing metals. (The importance of alchemy will be discussed in the next section.)After the demise of the Theosophical Society’s founder-leaders, a number of successors developed Blavatsky’s ideas. Of particular interest to the present discussion is Alice A. Bailey (1880–1949), at fi rst a Theosophical leader, but subsequently expelled from the Society, principally on account of the ideas that related to her idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Once outside the Theosophical Society, she founded her own organization, known as the Arcane School. In common with the early Theosophical founder-leaders, she claimed to have contact with Ascended Masters, in particular a spiritual being named Djwahl Khul, who worked in association with Master Morya and Koot Hoomi, and from whom her writings were allegedly channeled. (Djwahl Khul, also known as “the Tibetan,” does not correspond to any known historical character.) The fi rst of these channeled writings was entitled Initiation: Human and Solar (1922). In this work Bailey taught of humankind’s debt to advanced spirits inhabiting the Sirius star system. She wrote:First and foremost is the energy or force emanating from the sun Sirius. If it might be so expressed, the energy of thought, or mind force, in its totality, reaches the solar system from a distant cosmic center via Sirius. Sirius acts as the transmitter, or the focalizing center, whence emanate those infl uences which produce self-consciousness in man. During initiation, by means of the Rod of Initiation (acting as a subsidiary transmitter and as a powerful magnet) this energy is momentarily intensifi ed, and applied to the centers of the initiate with terrifi c force; were it not that the Hierophant and the two sponsors of the initiate pass it primarily through their bodies, it would be more than he could stand. This increase of mind energy results in an expansion and an apprehension of the truth as it is, and is lasting in its effects. It is felt primarily in the throat center, the great organ of creation through sound. (Bailey in 1922: 99, italics in original)Bailey’s subsequent books introduced the notion of the “reappearance of the Christ.” Jesus, Bailey taught, was a medium whose body was inhabited and used by the Christ. This Christ would reappear sometime toward the end of the twentieth century, to herald a new age and inaugurate a new world in which people’s consciousness"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple124was heightened. The Masters would draw close to humanity, with the Christ heading the spiritual hierarchy. In order for this to happen, the conditions had to be right: these included the confi guration of the planets, a spiritual awakening on the part of humanity, and invocation of the Masters.It is hard to overestimate Bailey’s infl uence on the Solar Temple. In particular, her preoccupation with Sirius and her emphasis on Ascended Masters provided momentum to the modern Rosicrucian revival. Jacques Breyer (1922–96), who heralded the so-called Arginy Renaissance, drew substantially on Bailey’s ideas, and Joseph Di Mambro himself used Bailey’s Great Invocation to commence OTS ceremonies:Let the Forces of Light bring illumination to mankind.Let the Spirit of Peace be spread abroad.May men of goodwill everywhere meet in a spirit of cooperation.May forgiveness on the part of all men be the keynote at this time.Let power attend the efforts of the Great Ones. So let it be, and help us to do ourpart.(Bailey,1951: 571)It is hardly necessary to point out of course, that the New Age Movement, in which Luc Jouret was caught up, also owes a considerable debt to Bailey.The RosicruciansI referred above to the Rosicrucian revival, and it is therefore necessary to examine the role of Rosicrucianism in the development of the Solar Temple. Rosicrucianism derives its name from Christian Rosenkreutz (trad. 1378–1484), who allegedly founded Spiritus Sanctum in 1409. The somewhat amazing life of Rosenkreutz is recounted in Fama Fraternitatis (“Account of the Brotherhood”), fi rst published in 1614—the fi rst extant written source referring to Rosicrucianism. According toFama Fraternitatis, Rosenkreutz traveled to Egypt, Arabia, and Morocco, and acquired three principal disciples to whom he passed on his teachings, forming an order in 1407. Spiritus Sanctum was an esoteric society, which allegedly used magical ritual for healing (alchemy), and which, more widely, was dedicated to the improvement of society. It is more likely, however, that Rosenkreutz was an entirely fi ctional character, created some two centuries later by Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654), a Lutheran pastor. Others have named the physician and alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541) as the founder of the movement. If Rosenkreutz ever did exist, and there was a lineage of Grand Masters (Imperators) going back to ancient Egypt, then this would make Rosenkreutz an initiate, not the founder-leader. The same observation applies to Paracelsus and Andreae.Other accounts of the origins of Rosicrucianism place its inception either much earlier or slightly later. According to some sources, it was founded in 46 CE by Ormus, an Alexandrian gnostic who is said to have been converted by St Mark."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple125Others contend that various ancient Middle-Eastern thinkers, including Plato, Jesus of Nazareth, Philo of Alexandria, and Plotinus, espoused Rosicrucianism. Some branches of Rosicrucianism, including AMORC, suggest that the origins of the movement go back into ancient Egyptian history, especially the Egyptian Mystery Schools of the fi fteenth century BCE, and in particular to the pharaohs Thutmose III (fi fteenth century BCE) and Akhenaten (fourteenth century BCE). Whatever the authenticity of such a pedigree, such claims signal AMORC’s considerable interest in ancient Egypt—a recurring theme in the OTS.Until the formation of the more modern Rosicrucian orders, Rosicrucianism has been more of a movement than a structured organization. While a number of celebrated individuals have been claimed as supporters—such as Roger Bacon, the Spanish scholar-mystic Raymond Lully (c.1232–1316), Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Paracelsus, Isaac Newton (1642–1727), Spanish theologian-physician Michael Servetus (1511–53), English physician and alchemist Robert Fludd (1574–1637), and René Descartes (1596–1650)—there is no uniform creed or set of practices that they have shared, and not all have welcomed the description. Fludd’s and Newton’s interests were principally alchemical, believing that the purifi cation of metals mirrored the purifying of one’s own life through death and resurrection. Descartes’ interests were in medicine and the prolongation of longevity; but he rejected the magical and the mystical.It is worth noting at this point that alchemy is not necessarily to be understood as a form of primitive science. Although it is typically associated with attempts to transform base metals into gold, to discover a panacea or elixir, to create human life non-biologically, or to discover a philosopher’s stone that might accomplish any or all of these, many alchemists from the eighteenth century onward came to regard alchemical discourse as symbolic and metaphorical, and associated more with religious than with scientifi c goals—an interpretation also supported by Carl Jung. Some alchemists taught that Christ was the philosopher’s stone, attaining perfection through death and resurrection. The nineteenth-century “spiritual alchemist” Mary Anne Atwood wrote, “Alchemy is a universal art of vital chemistry which by fermenting the human spirit purifi es and fi nally dissolves it. ... Alchemy isphilosophy; it is thephilosophy, the fi nding of the Sophia in the mind” (cited in Encyclopaedia Britannica CD-ROM, 1999). Alchemy thus offers the key to personal, rather than physical, transformation, which, as I shall argue, was the Solar Temple’s fundamental quest.Roger Bacon’s Rosicrucian ideas require some comment, in particular his ideas on astronomy. Bacon was familiar with Liber magnarum coniunctionum—a treatise by the Muslim philosopher Albumazar (787–886), a disciple of al-Kindi (d. 870), who combined Greek philosophy with Islam. According to Albumazar, minor planetary conjunctions occur every twentieth year, and major conjunctions every 960 years. Bacon used Albumazar’s scheme to postulate a pattern for the birth of famous leaders in human history: dividing this 960-year period into a further three sections, he noted that Alexander the Great, Jesus of Nazareth, Mani, and Muhammad were each born 320 years apart. (The story of the Magi seeing the star of Bethlehem has"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple126been adduced as confi rmatory evidence associating the birth of great human leaders with planetary conjunctions.)It would be simplistic to suggest that the Solar Temple derived its philosophy of history from any one single source. The interest in dividing human history into a series of eons is found not only in Bacon and in the Rosicrucian tradition, but also in astrological zodiacal theories relating to the Pisces–Aquarius transition. They are also to be found in certain forms of Christian thought, and also the Hindu notion of theyugas(ages). Christian apocalypticism featured substantially in OTS thought, and on at least one occasion Luc Jouret referred to the Hindu yugas, although, as I shall argue, it is unlikely that there was direct Hindu infl uence on the group. As will be evident, a number of strands of esoteric thinking merge in the Solar Temple, and this brief sketch of Rosicrucian thinking highlights the ways in which gnostic Christianity, ancient Egyptian religion, and alchemy blend.Modern Revivals of Templarism and RosicrucianismThe more recent revivals of Templarism and Rosicrucianism are in forms that inextricably intertwine. However, two interrelated organizations are of key importance in the development of the Order of the Solar Temple: the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), and the Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT).AMORC—the largest present-day Rosicrucian organization—claims to trace Rosicrucianism’s origins back to ancient Egypt, although not in an unbroken physical lineage. Founded as the Rosicrucian Research Society (also known as the New York Institution for Psychical Research) by Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883–1939) in 1904, the organization assumed the name of AMORC in 1915. AMORC’s symbol is a red rose with a gold cross, representing love and secrecy respectively. It is structured into lodges: a lodge required at least 50 members, and was empowered to perform degree initiation rituals. In common with the Order of the Solar Temple, the lodge had two inner sanctums, namely chapters and Pronaoi (Pronaos is the Greek for “antechamber”).Of key importance in the rise of the Order of the Solar Temple was Julien Origas (1920–83), who was a member of AMORC but who came to lead his own Rosicrucian organization, the Renewed Order of the Temple. The ORT was founded in 1970 by Raymond Bernard (1922–96). Bernard was the leader of AMORC in the French-speaking world, but he swiftly gave way to Origas, fi nally abandoning neo-Templarism in 1972. Origas continued to lead the movement until his death.A further key fi gure in the development of the Solar Temple was Jacques Breyer (1922–96), who inaugurated what has come to be known as the Arginy Renaissance. This began in 1952. Breyer claimed to have discovered a mid-eighteenth-century document in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, which supposedly stated that Jacques de Molay, the last Templar Grand Master, had passed on his authority to his nephew Guillaume de Beaujeu, and that Templar relics were to be found in their family estates. Breyer identifi ed Arginy as the original location at which Hughes"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple127de Payens, together with his nine knights, had founded the Order of the Temple on 12 June 1118. No relics were ever found, but Breyer began to organize some workshops in Ergonia, which aroused a certain amount of interest. Breyer also drew on apocalyptic ideas, teaching of an imminent destruction and the possibility of escape; he mentioned 1995 as the year in which this would take place, although he also cited other dates. Together with Maxime de Roquemaure, who claimed to be descended from a branch of medieval Templars, he established the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple on 24 June 1966, and it was incorporated in Monaco the following year.Breyer’s organization was distinctive in a number of ways. He created clubs, which provided a means of introducing seekers to his Templar group, and of spreading the ideas of Templarism. Unlike traditional Templarism, which claimed to trace a physical lineage of Grand Masters, the Solar tradition was based on presumed psychic contact with spirits of the medieval Templars, with whom it continued to encourage mediumistic communication. Belief in psychical communication provided an effective means of solving the problem of the unbroken tradition of Grand Masters: Templarism’s past Masters could re-emerge in apparitional form and participate in initiations. Breyer also drew to a considerable degree on Alice A. Bailey’s writings, and his organization, which gave rise to the OTS, laid emphasis on communication with the Ascended Masters, the star-cluster Sirius as their point of origin, and the apocalyptic elements to which Bailey had attached great signifi cance.Joseph Di Mambro’s connections with AMORC and with Breyer’s movement are well accredited. He joined AMORC in 1956 and remained a member until 1970, by which time he had become associated with the Arginy movement. He had become a teacher of the occult, and in 1978 he established the Golden Way Foundation. This organization was open to the public, and thus provided a means of introducing the uninitiated into Templarism. The Foundation’s premises were called The Pyramid, and they also housed the Fraternity. Luc Jouret joined the Golden Way Foundation in 1982.In 1981 a joint meeting was held between the Renewed Order of the Temple, the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple (another neo-Templar organization), and the Golden Way Foundation, at which an important ceremony, renewing their Templarist oath of allegiance, was enacted. Di Mambro came to regard this ceremony as the founding ceremony of the Solar Temple. (Introvigne and Mayer, 2002: 177). Luc Jouret was present at this event, and was introduced to Origas. The two established a rapport, and it seems that Origas nominated Jouret as his successor. When he died in 1983, Luc Jouret offi ciated at Origas’s funeral.After Origas’s death Luc Jouret became Grand Master. This caused disquiet to Origas’s widow and their daughter Catherine. A split emerged, in which the majority of members followed Catherine, leaving Jouret to establish his own schismatical group in 1984, called the International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition (OICST), which became the precursor of the Order of the Solar Temple."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple128Eastern Infl uences?One further possible source of OTS philosophy should be considered at this juncture. A few allusions to Eastern religion occur in the Solar Temple’s ideas, and this has caused at least one commentator to consider whether religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism played any role in Di Mambro’s and Jouret’s thinking. One writer goes as far as to classify the OTS as an “eastern cult,” stating that “The Order of the Solar Temple is based on Hinduism and ‘Reincarnation’” (Dominguez 2004).1The OTS made various allusions to concepts that feature in Hinduism. Apart from belief in reincarnation, the “cosmic child” Emmanuelle was sometimes referred to as anavatar(in Hinduism, a “descent” of a high deity into physical form—sometimes loosely translated as “incarnation”); and Jouret spoke of the Earth being in its fi nal yuga.To account for the place of such ideas in Jouret’s worldview, it is not necessary to go outside the sources of doctrine that have already been identifi ed, together with the familiar zeitgeist of New Age thinking. Reincarnation featured signifi cantly in Theosophical ideas, and it was also one of the key principles of Catharism, which the historical Templars’ last crusade set out to suppress. Indeed, it has been argued that the Templars themselves accepted recruits from excommunicated members of the Roman Catholic Church, and hence may have had Cathars within their own ranks (Martin 2004: 135). Of course, notions of karma and reincarnation are also widespread within the New Age movement. There is therefore no need to look beyond Theosophy, Templarism, and the New Age to trace this component in the Solar Temple’s philosophy.The OTS’s notion of “avatar” does not seem to be used in any profound philosophical sense. As far as we can tell, there is no substantial philosophical underpinning of the notion, and Di Mambro’s contrast between the avatar Emmanuelle and the Antichrist Immanuel indicates that he continued to think in quasi-Christian rather than Hindu ways. Similarly, Jouret’s use of the term yuga is imprecise: in Hindu thought a yuga is not a 6,000-year period, but a much lengthier one: in Hindu thought, the kali yuga, which is the shortest as well as the most corrupt, lasts for a duration of 432,000 years and still has a considerable period to run before it expires. A period of 6,000 years is much more germane to the Christian and Western astrological views of time, being associated with traditional dates of creation—precisely 4004 BCE according to Bishop Ussher (1581–1656), seven 1,000-year long “days” of creation, and 2,000-year-long astrological ages in which Pisces (the “fi sh” being the symbol of Christianity) is in the process of giving way to the dawning Age of Aquarius (the “New Age”). Again, there is no need to suspect any direct infl uence from Eastern thinking.1 “Eastern Cults”, located at http://religion-cults-com/Cults/Eastern/E-CULTS.htm#solar; accessed 11 February 2005."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple129Jouret’s 1987 Lecture and the “Transit Letters”Thus far I have examined external sources relating to the Solar Temple. However, we can also fi nd important information about the Temple from Luc Jouret’s own lectures, and from the so-called “transit letters.” The “transit letters” were communications written by four OTS members shortly before their deaths, posted to some 300 recipients, including Jean-François Mayer, explaining their motives. According to Mayer, Jouret talked in 1987 about an imminent apocalypse that the Earth was facing; humankind, he affi rmed, had reached the end of the kali yuga, a 6,000-year period at the end of which there would be ecological disaster. However, a New Age was dawning, and survival was possible if the Earth’s inhabitants showed due concern for the environment. The Solar Temple, in fact, went on to set up designated survival centres, in Quebec and in Australia.Jouret defi ned the following seven principles as the goals of the Solar Temple. These were derived from the Sovereign Order of the Solar Temple, in virtually unaltered form. Collectively they reinforce the notion of a global predicament, a need for reappraising one’s values, and a transition to an ideal state involving a renewed Earth.(1) Re-establishing the correct notions of authority and power in the world.(2) Affi rming the primacy of the spiritual over the temporal.(3) Giving back to man the conscience of his dignity.(4) Helping humanity through its transition.(5) Participating in the Assumption of the Earth in its three frameworks: body, soul, and spirit.(6) Contributing to the union of the Churches and working towards the meeting of Christianity and Islam.(7) Preparing for the return of Christ in solar glory. (Cited in Peronnik 1975: 147–9)During this stage of the OTS’s development, Mayer notes, Jouret’s message was world-affi rming and positive: humankind could escape the coming disaster, and there seemed no need to view the world as irredeemable, or to be escaped from by death. Even the reference to Islam in the seven principles is conciliatory rather than confrontational, in contrast with the medieval Templars, and looks forward to an era of religious harmony. There is no allusion to, or even hint of, violence.This contrasts with the “transit letters,” which were world-renouncing and pessimistic about the planet’s future. Mayer reports that one of the four “transit letters” rejected the idea of positive creative forces in the earth, recommending withdrawal from the world in the face of coming destruction. Another stated that the group’s mission had been interrupted prematurely: the author maintained that the group had been misunderstood, deploring the police investigations of the group and the blackmail to which Di Mambro had been subjected. A third letter spoke of scandals relating to the group, and of the need to punish “traitors.”"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple130Reconstructing OTS TeachingWhy was there the change from Luc Jouret’s 1987 optimism, which looked forward to a golden age of peace, harmony, and a renewed Earth, to the subsequent pessimism that led to the 1994 disasters? And if there was cause for despair, what function did the mass deaths serve? In the absence of substantial concrete evidence, explaining Jouret’s volte-face must entail elements of speculation, but a number of factors, internal and external to the group, may well have contributed to the tragedy. In the external world, there was little to inspire confi dence in the late 1980s and early 1990s that the Earth was becoming renewed. Although the demise of communism in Eastern Europe had given some religious organizations (including new religious movements) hope of a better world, the process was violent, and other wars marred the planet, for example the Iraq war, and the escalating Arab–Israeli confl ict. Jouret may also have felt that there was little evidence that an ecological disaster might be averted. Added to this, the OTS had its own problems, to which Susan Palmer and others drew attention.As I have suggested, the group’s problems are insuffi cient to explain the disasters. The acceptance of death as the solution must be related to an emergent worldview within the OTS. A number of key themes within the organization, I believe, help to explain Jouret’s ultimate solution to their problems. First, I have identifi ed the role of Sirius in the group’s thinking. This was the home of the Ascended Masters, who had appeared on earth in discarnate form in the OTS’s subterranean chambers. But if the Ascended Masters were not enabling humanity to achieve the golden age on Earth, then it is an understandable step, although perhaps not a justifi able one, to substitute the notion of the transformed Earth to another world—Sirius—to which they would journey. This transit can be viewed in terms of spiritual alchemy: it purported to provide a means whereby the souls of the OTS members could be transformed to perfected beings in this new world.A second key theme was reincarnation. In the OTS’s worldview the soul was the essence of the self, and not the body; and the soul was capable of transmigrating from one body to another. As we have seen, both Di Mambro and Jouret, as well as several leading OTS members, claimed to be reincarnated forms of various spiritual leaders who had previously left their bodies; and conversely a number of the Ascended Masters themselves had once inhabited human bodies, but had now moved on to a higher plane. If humans could end up as spiritual beings on Sirius, this set a precedent for present-day earthly mortals: transition was a realistic possibility. In Chapter 2 of this volume Massimo Introvigne has suggested that the role of fi re in the incident was an attempt to ensure that members’ bodies were destroyed, to prevent the possibility of souls returning to them.A third theme was the apocalyptic message. Jouret held that the Earth was in its last days, and probably concluded that it was irredeemable. In common with much traditional apocalyptic writing, Di Mambro and Jouret not only believed in earthly opposition to the group, but also projected this opposition to a supernatural plane: evil forces and an Antichrist were confronting the group, and required more than"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Sources of Doctrine in the Solar Temple131conventional ways of being dealt with. Not only did Emmanuel Dutoit have to die, but in a ritual manner that exorcized the evil forces that were at work.Allied to the apocalyptic message was the fi nal theme of the periodization of human history, and the use of astrology and numerology to reach the conclusion that the Earth was in its last days. Christian apocalypticism, the doctrine of the yugas(although evidently misunderstood by Jouret), the Rosicrucian notion of historical eras starting from the Earth’s creation, and the astrological evidence of a transition from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius all pointed to a crucial point in the Earth’s history, which the OTS associated with the appearance of the star Sirius. A date sometime near the end of the twentieth century is consistent with a number of millennial end-time calculations, marking variously the end of a 2000-year astrological era (Pisces), the 6,000th year of creation, 2,000 years after Jesus’ birth (normally reckoned by historians to be either 4 BCE or 7 BCE), and it is consistent with dates suggested by Bailey and Breyer. There were only short windows of opportunity to make the transition. As Mayer reports, Di Mambro had already acknowledged David Koresh’s Waco group (Branch Davidians) as having achieved collective death at this appropriate time, stating that, although the OTS may have slower to achieve this fi nal goal, its exit would be more dramatic. It is not unreasonable to suggest that, like the slightly later Heaven’s Gate group, they expected their souls to depart from their bodies and journey to the star Sirius.ConclusionAny attempt to reconstruct the worldview of a spiritual group—most of whose initiates are now dead, and whose rites and teachings are esoteric—must inevitably be tentative. What has been outlined above is, I believe, consistent with the known facts about the OTS, and in line with the various traditions on which the group drew. Unless one assumes, contrary to reliable research, that there are spiritual teachers who are capable of mesmerizing and “brainwashing” their followers in such a way as to make them commit suicide for unobvious cynical purposes, one must look to the leaders’ and members’ worldview to explain their deviant behavior. Although it may be that members of the Solar Temple were drawn to the organization by its rituals rather than its teachings, doctrines provide the underlying rationale for a spiritual group’s practices, and, in the case of the Solar Temple, for its untimely end."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Chapter 8Death as Initiation: The Order of the Solar Temple and Rituals of Initiation1Henrik BogdanDeath is the same for us all.It is how we leave Life that makes the difference.You must be able to die to the profane worldin order to be born again to the Cosmic World.2In the aftermath of the multiple homicides and suicides committed by members of the Order of the Solar Temple (Ordre du Temple Solaire, or OTS), numerous articles have been published in which scholars attempt to provide answers to the question of why the OTS met with such a violent end. The simplistic answers provided by the media and anticult organizations have been challenged by more complex and analytical approaches by various scholars. For instance, Massimo Introvigne and Jean-François Mayer argued that four factors might explain the OTS tragedy, namely predisposing apocalyptic ideology, perception of external opposition, internal dissent and apostasy, and crumbling charismatic authority of the leader (Introvigne and Mayer 2002: 178–83). These four factors should not, however, be regarded as potentially dangerous or violent on their own—it is only when these factors are combined that there is cause for worry. In their comparative study of the OTS with the People’s Temple and Heaven’s Gate, Introvigne and Mayer show that the combination of certain factors could have a lethal outcome irrespective of other apparent differences between the movements. Another example of a scholarly approach is the work of James R. Lewis, who questioned the often-assumed connection between violent movements like the Solar Temple and millennialism and external provocation and instead focused on internal factors such as the failing health of a leader (Lewis 2005). 1 I would like to thank Jean-François Mayer for graciously providing me with copies of the following Solar Temple rituals used as primary sources: Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali:Ceremony of the 4 Elements;Traditional Ritual for the Donning of the Talar;Reception Ceremony; Order TS: Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross;Passageof the Surplice;The Dubbing of a Knight.2 Order TS: Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross; see Appendix 2 for the complete ritual."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple134What these scholars have in common is that they do not advocate a simple “the-one-and-only” explanation, but rather see the complexities and multilevel factors of the case. This approach is adopted in the present chapter, and the aspects of the Solar Temple that will be discussed are not seen as the only relevant ones. Rather, the chapter should be understood as offering a new approach to the multifaceted tragedy of the Solar Temple.A survey of the literature dealing with the OTS shows that scholars have not been consistent in defi ning what kind of movement the OTS actually is. Although there seems to be a consensus among scholars that the members of the OTS differed considerably from the preconceived notions of “typical” members of a sect or a cult (OTS members were generally quite wealthy and held important positions in society), it is obvious that the organizational structure of the OTS has baffl ed scholars. Are we dealing with a doomsday cult, a sect, a new religious movement, a new magical movement, a suicide cult (Lewis 2005), a magical-esoteric religion (Palmer 1996: 303), a Rosicrucian and/or neo-Templar organization (Introvigne 1995: 267), a secret society (Palmer 1996, 304), a magic and gnostic movement (Mayer 1999: 223), or an esoteric new religious movement (Introvigne 2000: 138)? The answer to that question depends, of course, on how these labels are defi ned and what aspects of the OTS are emphasized. However, in this chapter it will be argued that an essentially overlooked characteristic of the OTS is the fact that it is an initiatory society and that, as such, it belongs to a particular type of initiatory society that has been present in Western culture since at least the end of the seventeenth century: the Masonic initiatory society. This essay will provide an overview of Western esotericism and Masonic initiatory societies, with a particular emphasis on the notion of death. After this overview, the initiatory system of the OTS will be discussed, followed by an analysis of a number of rituals of initiation found by Mayer in the debris of the OTS lodges in Switzerland. Finally, the chapter will conclude with a discussion of the suicides in relation to Western esotericism and rituals of initiation. It will be suggested that these factors might provide us with a partial key as to why the members of the OTS chose death as the fi nal solution.The Solar Temple as a Masonic Initiatory SocietyThe use of rituals of initiation is not an uncommon practice in new religious movements and it can be found both in movements with Eastern roots such as Transcendental Meditation and in those of Western origin, such as the modern witchcraft movement. Even though information published about the rituals of the Solar Temple is limited, these rituals have been described as pseudo-Masonic and neo-Templar. But what does this actually mean? In discussing the rituals of the Solar Temple we are dealing with a very specifi c form of initiation ritual: Masonic rituals of initiation. The term “Masonic” should in this context not be interpreted in its restricted sense as referring exclusively"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation135to the Order of Freemasons which was founded in London in 1717. Rather, it refers to a certain type of ritual originating from Freemasonry, but not necessarily having any links to an offi cial Masonic organization (Bogdan 2003). The purpose, the teachings transmitted, and the mythological setting of these rituals vary considerably, but they share a number of components or building-blocks. These components include: 1. the opening of the lodge during which the candidate is not present;2. admission into the lodge-room in which the candidate answers a number of questions;3. circumambulations of the lodge, often symbolic of an ordeal;4. obligation or oath never to divulge the secrets of the degree (often the sign, grip, and word), but often also including certain ethical rules which the candidate swears to observe;5. formal admission into the degree;6. instruction in the secrets of the degree (often a sign, grip, and word), but also in the Order’s particular teachings;7. the giving of one or more visible tokens, such as gloves or aprons, sometimes also a new name or motto;8. closing of the lodge, during which the candidate is present.These components form the skeleton, as it were, of Masonic rituals of initiation, but the rituals show a wide variety both in terms of length and ritual elaborations. The reason why these rituals are called “Masonic” is the simple fact that it was within the various forms of Freemasonry that they originated and subsequently spread outside the fold of Freemasonry. The development of the rituals of Freemasonry was a gradual process and the content owed much to the reception rites of medieval English and Scottish guilds of operative stonemasons. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries an increasing number of persons who were not operative stonemasons joined Masonic lodges, and subsequently many lodges became purely non-operative. Four of these non-operative lodges in London decided to form the Premier Grand Lodge of Freemasonry in 1717, and thus the Order of Freemasons was formally created. Our knowledge of the rituals used by the Freemasons in the fi rst decades of the eighteenth century is based on a number of manuscripts and so-called exposures: that is, published texts which aimed at revealing or exposing the secrets of Freemasonry. These early sources are in catechism form, which means that they are in the form of questions and answers. With the publication of Samuel Prichard’s Masonry Dissected in 1730 the development of the so-called Craft degrees had reached its completion in the sense that there were now three degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. These three degrees form the basis of the initiatory system of Freemasonry even to this day and they center on the themes of birth, life, and death respectively. The mythological setting of these rituals is the Old Testament and the legendary setting centers on the construction of Solomon’s Temple. Apart from the"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple136signifi cant fact that Prichard’s Masonry Dissected is the fi rst exposure to contain the three degrees of Craft masonry, it also contains the fi rst account of the Hiramic legend. The Hiramic legend remains the most important and characteristic legend of Freemasonry to this day and it plays a key role in the third, or Master Mason, degree. Briefl y, the Hiramic legend centers on the murder of Hiram, King Solomon’s chief architect, who was entrusted with the erection of the Temple of Jerusalem. Hiram had divided his workers into three classes according to their skill and, in order to differentiate among them, each class was given a certain password. Three workers who belonged to the second class wanted to obtain the password of the third class—the master’s word. It was Hiram’s custom to pray each day inside the uncompleted temple, and the three villains trapped Hiram inside the temple and demanded that he divulge the master’s word. Hiram refused, and attempted to escape but the villains struck him forcefully one time each. The third and last blow killed Hiram before he had divulged the master’s word and consequently the word—YHVH—was lost. The murderers buried Hiram’s body under some shrubs. It did not take long before Hiram’s absence was noticed, and King Solomon sent out search parties. Upon fi nding the body of Hiram, a new master’s word was adopted. The new word was Macbenac, which is supposed to mean “the fl esh falls from the bones” in allusion to the decomposed state of Hiram’s corpse. Central to the Hiramic legend is the search for the lost way of pronouncing the name of God and an initiatic interpretation of death.3 As will be discussed further on in this chapter, the candidates were identifi ed with Hiram and in the ritual they symbolically experienced death. The three Craft degrees spread quickly across the continent, and many lodges were established throughout Europe and in the colonies during the fi rst decades after the formation of the Premier Grand Lodge in 1717. It did not take long, however, before new rituals appeared on the Masonic scene. These new rituals—often referred to as High or Additional degrees—were often considered to be completions or elaborations of the Craft degrees. The most characteristic elements of these new degrees are the virtues of chivalry, such as fi delity, courage, and compassion, but it also became increasingly popular to infuse the rituals with Western esotericism. Many of these new rituals were subsequently collected into systems or Rites, such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Swedish Rite, and the Rectifi ed Scottish Rite. The two most common types of eighteenth-century High Degree Freemasonry are the Scottish or Ecossais degrees, and the Templar degrees. The latter have their origin in France and it is this particular form of Freemasonry that later on in the nineteenth century—directly or indirectly—formed the basis of many neo-Templar orders, which in their continuation can be considered as the antecedents of Order of the Solar Temple. The Templar degrees of Freemasonry center on the legend of Freemasonry deriving from the medieval Knights Templar. The Order of the Knights Templar, 3 For a discussion of the early development of the Hiramic legend see Snoek, J.A.M. “The Evolution of the Hiramic Legend from Prichard’s Masonry Dissected to the EmulationRitual, in England and France” (1999)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation137founded in the fi rst decade of the twelfth century, was disbanded by Philip IV “The Fair” of Bourbon (1268–1314) and Pope Clement V (1264–1314) in the fi rst decade of the fourteenth century, but according to a Masonic legend the Templars survived in the highlands of Scotland and later reappeared to the public as the Order of Freemasons.The fi rst person to present this theory of continuation was the Scotsman “Chevalier” Andrew Michael Ramsay (1686–1743) who lived as an expatriate in Paris. Ramsay was the orator of the lodge Le Louis d’Argent, whose Worshipful Master was Charles Radclyffe (1693–1746). In a famous oration given at the lodge in 1737, Ramsay stated that Freemasonry was founded by the medieval crusaders in the Holy Land, or Outremer. Ramsay’s oration proved to be a milestone in the development of Masonic rituals of initiation and soon rituals began to appear that incorporated Ramsay’s thesis. It was in the milieu of the Jacobite Parisian lodges that the Masonic Templar degrees fi rst developed, perhaps as early as 1737. The best-known propagator of Templar degrees in Germany was Baron Karl Gotthelf von Hund (1722–76) and it is often claimed that he had been initiated into a Templar degree in France in 1743. On the basis of this initiation, he set up the Rite of the Strict Observance, which consisted of three additional degrees: Scottish Master, Novice, and Knight Templar or Knight of the Temple. Von Hund furthermore introduced a peculiar feature in the structure of his Rite, namely that of the Unknown Superiors orSuperiores Incogniti. These Unknown Superiors ruled, through von Hund, the Rite of the Strict Observance, and the members of the Rite were expected to strictly observe the decrees of these Superiors. It has been suggested that the actual head of the Rite was none other than the young pretender Bonnie Prince Charlie, Charles Edward Stuart (1720–88). From then on, the presence of Unknown Superiors or Hidden Chiefs became a recurrent theme in many initiatory societies, particularly among Templars and the more esoteric orders such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley’s (1875–1947) A?A?. This idea was picked up by the Solar Temple in which they became known as the Mystical Masters. These masters were seen as the intermediary between the order and God, and it appears that it was believed that the members themselves could become such masters after the “transit.” During the second half of the eighteenth century Templar degrees fl ourished on the Masonic scene, but soon enough the Masonic supremacy over the Templar degrees started to be questioned. If Freemasonry is nothing but the medieval Knights Templar in modern form, then why should Freemasonry be required at all if one wanted to be a modern Templar? As Massimo Introvigne4 has shown in great detail, the origins of independent neo-Templarism can be traced to Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat (1773–1838), who in 1805 proclaimed himself as Grand Master of the Templar Order. By 1980 there existed literally over one hundred rival Templar 4 The reader is referred to Massimo Introvigne’s indispensable “Ordeal by Fire: The Tragedy of the Solar Temple” (1995 and Chapter 2 this volume) for the complex history of neo-Templarism and its connections to the Solar Temple."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple138orders across a wide spectrum, ranging from social clubs to organizations which indulge in sexual magic (Introvigne 1995: 267–73). The Solar Temple and Western EsotericismIf we are to believe Introvigne and Mayer (and I see no reason why we should not), the members of the Solar Temple “were literally businesspersons by day and servants of the occult Masters by night” (2002: 176). The relationship between the Solar Temple and Western esotericism has been noted by several scholars, but there has been little discussion as to what this relationship actually consists of.5Western esotericism is a scholarly construct which covers numerous currents that share a family resemblance, and which can be described as a form of holistic spirituality characterized by resistance to the dominance of either pure rationality or doctrinal faith. Instead, the importance of the individual effort to gain spiritual knowledge, or gnosis, is often emphasized (van den Broek and Hanegraaff 1998: vii). This gnosis is not limited to intellectual or rational knowledge but is rather based on an experiential knowledge that is unconstrained by the limits of the intellect. The path to gnosis is often considered to pass through self-knowledge since man is seen as a microcosm of the universe—the macrocosm. Man is created in the image of God and therefore refl ects the whole creation. The created universe is usually regarded as emanations of the Godhead, and since man is perceived as a microcosm of the macrocosm, the esotericist believes that the Godhead can be found within man. The quest for self-knowledge is thus also a quest for the divine aspect of existence, just as knowledge about the Godhead by necessity is knowledge about ourselves. The holistic understanding of the universe to be found within Western esotericism is based on the idea that the entire universe is alive and traversed by a network of sympathies and antipathies that link everything in nature (Faivre 1994: 10). The network is often referred to as mystical links and it constitutes the theoretical basis for such esoteric “sciences” as astrology and ritual magic. Today, the most common approach among scholars to the understanding of the term “Western esotericism” is the one proposed by Antoine Faivre in 1992. According to Faivre, Western esotericism should be understood as a form of thought which is characterized by four constitutive components. These four components are required to be present simultaneously in a discourse in order to be able to be labeled as esoteric, and they consist of (1) correspondences which link everything in Nature together; (2) the idea of living Nature; (3) the importance placed on the imaginative faculty and the use of mediating aids such as rituals, symbols, and intermediary spirits; and (4) the experience of transmutation, often understood as the process leading from uninitiated to initiated or enlightened. Besides these four constitutive components 5 For an introduction to the relationship between Western esotericism and new religious movements see Hammer, Olav “Esotericism in New Religious Movements” (2004). For the impact of esotericism on the New Age movement see Hanegraaff, Wouter J. New Age Religion and Western Culture (1998), especially 365–524."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation139Faivre adds two secondary or relative components which are not necessarily found in esoteric discourses, but which are nonetheless frequently to be found. The fi rst of these secondary components is the “praxis of the concordance” which implies the notion that all different religious traditions ultimately stem from the same root. The second relative component is the importance attached to the way in which esoteric knowledge is transmitted, for instance from teacher to disciple or in the form of an initiation (Faivre 1992: 1994). These ideas can be found already in late antiquity, particularly in Hermetism and the various forms of gnosticism. However, the majority of scholars working in the fi eld of Western esotericism tend to agree that it was during the Renaissance that esotericism emerged. It was particularly in the intellectual milieu of the New Platonic Academy at Florence that philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino (1433–99) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–94) laid the foundation of what today is called Western esotericism. This particular point in history is characterized by an intensifi ed period of syncretism and a number of seemingly divergent religious traditions—such as Christian mysticism, medieval ritual magic, Jewish Kabbalah, Platonism, Neoplatonism, Pythagorism, and Hermetism—were seen as not only compatible with each other but even as different branches of one and the same tradition. From the Renaissance onward a large number of esoteric currents appeared on the scene, and, from the seventeenth century on, some of these currents became intimately associated with secret or closed societies. Perhaps the earliest, and certainly one of the best-known, examples of an esoteric secret society is the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, or the Rosicrucians, who allegedly made themselves known to the public at the beginning of the seventeenth century by issuing three short pamphlets or manifestos—the Fama Fraternitatis(1614),Confessio Fraternitatis (1615), and Chymische Hochzeit (1616). In the manifestos it was claimed that there existed a secret brotherhood which had been founded by a certain Christian Rosenkreutz, and that this brotherhood possessed a secret knowledge (which Rosenkreutz had received on his travels in the East) through which a new Reformation could be brought about. More importantly though, the manifestos contained an open invitation to join the brotherhood, although there was no mention of how to get in touch. Today it is generally assumed that there never existed a Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross as it was portrayed in the manifestos, and that the authors of the manifestos were a group of Lutherans, of which only the Protestant theologian Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654) has been identifi ed. This fact notwithstanding, during the fi rst decades of the seventeenth century rumors of this mysterious fraternity spread like wildfi re across Europe and, soon enough, individuals and groups claiming to be the original Rosicrucians appeared. Many of these groups were in one way or another connected to Freemasonry which had established itself throughout Europe during the 1730s. It was particularly in the high degrees of Freemasonry that Rosicrucian symbolism became fashionable, and Rosicrucianism became increasingly linked to spiritual alchemy. One of the most infl uential Masonic Rosicrucian Rites to appear on the scene was Der Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuzes, which was founded in the middle of the seventeenthcentury"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple140in the German-speaking countries. This Rite was a Masonic offshoot of an alchemical brotherhood called Der Orden des Gülden und Rosenkreutzes, founded in 1710. Other Masonic Rosicrucian Rites include The Royal Order of Scotland (perhaps founded as early as 1741), and later nineteenth-century orders such as Societas Rosicruciana In Anglia (founded in 1866) which was, and continues to be, restricted to Master Masons. The end of the nineteenth century and the fi rst decades of the twentieth century witnessed a virtual boom of occultist self-styled Rosicrucian initiatory societies all over Europe and the USA, such as Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, the inner order of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (England, 1888); the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross (France, 1888); The Order of the Catholic Rose Cross (France, 1890); the Rosicrucian Fellowship (USA, 1909); the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross (England, 1915); the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, AMORC (USA, 1915); and Lectorium Rosicrucianum, originally founded under the name Rozekruizers Genootschap (The Netherlands, 1924), to name but a few. Rosicrucian infl uence on the Solar Temple comes primarily through Joseph Di Mambro’s membership of AMORC, which he had joined in 1956 and in which he remained as a member for at least 12 years (Mayer 1999: 209). Immediately prior to the transit in 1994 Di Mambro founded in Avignon the ARC which had the double meaning of Alliance Rosy-Cross for the initiates, and the Association for Cultural Research for the public (Introvigne 1999: 304; 2000: 152–3). It is unclear whether the ARC was a reorganization of the Solar Temple or whether it was created as a separate organization. The Notion of Death in Western Esotericism and Masonic Initiatory SocietiesIn Western esotericism death is often seen as a symbol of an initiatory passage from one state of being to another, where the candidate is leaving the material world and values behind him to embark on a spiritual quest for enlightenment. This symbolical interpretation is especially common in alchemical literature in which death is seen as a prerequisite of a spiritual resurrection, often connected to the alchemical notion ofputrefaction (Linden 2003: 17). Death is thus the fi rst stage in the alchemical process which leads from an unenlightened state to enlightenment. Even though no two alchemists appear to be able to agree on what the alchemical process looks like in detail, a frequently recurring description is that it consists of three stages: nigredo,albedo, and rubedo, or the black, white, and red stages. The alchemical process of transmutation is based on the fundamental theory that all material objects and matter consist of various proportions of the four elements, and that these proportions can be manipulated. Gold, which is seen as the purest metal, is considered to be composed of the four elements in perfect balance. From a spiritual perspective, this implies that the qualities which make up our personality need to be in balance in order for us to be able to be united with the Godhead. But in order to cause this manipulation, it is fi rst necessary to “kill” or dissolve (the nigredo phase) the original form of the matter one wishes to transmute; or from a spiritual point of view, the old self needs to “die” before it is possible to progress spiritually. In the fi rst stage the material is killed or"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation141putrefi ed, that is, it is dissolved into its original form, or prima materia. According to alchemical theory, there can be no regeneration without corruption, no life without death. This state of dissolution, or mortifi cation, is often symbolized in alchemical imagery by symbols of death and corruption, such as skeletons, skulls, and coffi ns. In the second or white phase the blackened matter is purifi ed by the mercurial water, the universal agent of transmutation. “The body has been whitened and spiritualized (that is the fi xed is volatilized) and the soul has been prepared to receive illumination from the spirit” (Abraham 2001: 5). This stage can also be interpreted as the spirit’s separation from the body, which will reunite when the body is purifi ed and made pure and spotless, and is often symbolized by things pure, white, or silver, such as the moon, snow, and virgins. Finally, in the third or red stage, the spirit is reunited with the white matter. This union is frequently described as a “chemical wedding,” and upon its completion the desirable philosopher’s stone is achieved. Images such as red lions, basilisks, red roses, and the sun often symbolize the rubedo phase of the opus alchymicum.The notion of death in alchemy is thus seen as the fi rst step in an initiatory process, but this initiatic interpretation of death is not restricted to alchemy. Death as part of an initiatory process is a recurrent theme in many Masonic rituals of initiation. In Freemasonry the theme of death is especially connected to the third, or Master Mason, degree and its Hiramic legend. As already mentioned, the legend centers on the murder of Hiram Abiff, the architect of King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. In the ritual the candidate is identifi ed with Hiram and he undergoes a symbolical death, which is often interpreted as the death of the old profane self and the birth of the new spiritual self. Hiram was, furthermore, often interpreted as Christ, which meant that the candidates, through the symbolic death, were united (Unio Mystica) with Christ and thereby conquered death and achieved eternal life. A frequent theme in a number of High degrees (especially in Templar High degrees which are often Christian in nature) is the elaboration on the soteriological aspects of the initiatory identifi cation with Christ. Death and resurrection as an initiation also form a regular theme in many Masonic rituals of initiation which are outside the fold of Freemasonry, such as in the Adeptus Minor degree of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Regardie 1938: 198–244), the third or Master Magician degree of Ordo Templi Orientis as revised by Aleister Crowley (King 1973: 85–100), and the third degree of Gerald Gardner’s (1884–1964) modern witchcraft movement, High Priest/High Priestess (Bogdan 2003: 229–33).In Western esoteric thought the human being is often considered to consist of three parts: fi rst, the physical or material body which is composed of the elements; second, the astral body which is often seen as connected to the spirit; and, third, the soul which is connected to the Godhead.6 The consequences of physical death can 6 It is evident from the “Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross” of the Order TS that the Solar Temple considered man to consist of body, soul, and spirit: “Vestal, go and cense our Brother(s) and Sister(s) Neophyte(s), making a circle around him/them 3 times in order to purify his/her/their bodies (physical–soul–spirit) and to protect him/her/them.”"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple142be divided into two main theories. The fi rst theory is based on annihilationalism in which the individual identity dissolves in death as the soul unites with the Godhead. Conversely, the other category is based on speculations concerning personal post-mortem existence. The post-mortem existence is usually understood as reincarnation of the soul and spirit in a new physical body of the material world, or as different speculations concerning life in the afterworld. As Gibbons has noted, “although the concept of reincarnation in western occultism has a Pythagorean provenance, since the nineteenth century it has been increasingly reformulated in terms of Eastern religious thought, most notably in the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–1891) and the Theosophical Society” (Gibbons 2001: 83). However, Blavatsky and her followers differed signifi cantly from the Hindu and Buddhist views of reincarnation in that she regarded reincarnation as something positive, as a possibility of progressing spiritually in each incarnation. This positive attitude toward reincarnation was adopted by many other occultist societies and is today a standard feature of such large movements as the New Age movement. The positive outlook on reincarnation was not, however, limited to speculations and ideas concerning future incarnations; rather it was often popular to try to “remember” past incarnations. This practice seems to have been a recurrent feature in the Solar Temple, and Di Mambro revealed to a number of members their previous incarnations, which included Bernard de Clairvaux, Maat, Queen Hatshepsut, Manatanus, Ram (Melchesidech’s priest), and Akhenaton’s scribe (Palmer 1996: 309). As already noted, ideas concerning personal post-mortem existence were not limited to reincarnation but also included more traditional Christian notions of life in hell, purgatory, and paradise. A development of this traditional view is the idea of a separate realm where the dead live. This idea became extremely popular through the spread of spiritualism from the 1850s on, in which the basic idea is that it is possible to interact with the dead through mediums. There were different speculations as to where this “realm of the dead” was located, but the most common one was that it was on a higher or more subtle plane of existence. The French spiritualist Allan Kardec (1804–69) claimed, however, that the dead lived on the other planets of our solar system. To what extent, if at all, Kardec’s ideas infl uenced Heaven’s Gate and the Solar Temple has not been properly investigated, but it is nonetheless important to note that these ideas were not unheard of in the esoteric milieu.Among the esotericists who did not adhere to annihilationalism (the latter have always been in minority) it is evident that the way in which we live our lives and our spiritual level are directly linked to the afterlife. Furthermore, the afterlife was often seen as a state which was not conditioned by the gross matter of our bodies, but rather as a state suitable for the spirit and soul. Or to put it into the words of Gibbons:In contrast to orthodox thinkers, the occultists tended to neglect the beautifi c vision in their discourse on the afterlife, being preoccupied with the idea of a somatic immortality. They emphasised that postmortem embodiment would be purely spiritual, but they were equally emphatic that it would be embodiment, and they went into detail as to its nature."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation143The occult mystical representation of the spiritual body clearly represents a yearning to be released from an existence that was conditioned and contingent. The mystic wanted to return to a reality that transcends our mundane experience, but he wanted to return inperson. (2001: 87) To the members of the Solar Temple death was seen as a “transition,” something that Joseph Di Mambro had most likely picked up from his time in AMORC. AMORC was founded by H. Spencer Lewis (1883–1939) in 1915 and quickly became the largest Rosicrucian group in the world. According to one source from 2001, AMORC might have as many as around 250,000 members (Barrett 2001: 357). The teachings of the organization are highly eclectic, with a fi rm foundation in occultist spirituality. Death is seen as a transition in which the physical body (which is subject to change and decay) becomes separated from the soul. According to H. Spencer Lewis, “the soul of man, or the divine essence which animates him is the only part of man which is not subject to the law of change” (Lewis 1941: 238). The soul is thus eternal and not limited by the mere death of the physical body. In a letter from 1938 Lewis explains his beliefs concerning death:To me the change called “death”, and which is better understood as transition, is merely a change from one form of physical, material and psychological existence to another. I believe the change is identical in importance and consequence to that change which takes place when the embryo of a newly born child takes its fi rst breath and becomes a living entity on this earth plane. I do not attempt to say how, or what form or type of existence the individuality, personality, character or mentality of a human being may be like after this so-called transition, but of one thing I am convinced, and that is that this transition which we call “death” does not end the whole of our existence nor affect our existence except in its mode of physical, mental, spiritual and psychological expression. Consequently I have no fear of death except that I would not like to have it occur suddenly before I could prepare papers and other matters that would concern myself or my family after my inability to function any further here in this particular form. (H. Spencer Lewis to August H. Wagner, 31 January 19387)It would appear that Di Mambro and Jouret shared Lewis’s dislike of having the transition occur before all the paperwork was prepared: prior to enacting the transition the motives of their actions were carefully laid out in detail in the so-called Testaments and mailed to a number scholars and the media. The Initiatory System of the Solar TempleA common characteristic of many new religious movements is that their organizational structure is in a state of more or less constant change, and in that respect the Order of the Solar Temple was no exception. Introvigne has described the various layers of the organization as a ‘Chinese box’ system (Introvigne 1995: 274). The outer 7 In the author’s collection."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple144shell consisted (at least for a period) of the semi-public Amenta Club (which later changed its name to Atlanta) in which Luc Jouret lectured on New Age topics such as homeopathy, naturopathy, and ecology. This outer shell worked as a recruiting ground for members to the inner and semi-secret Archedia Clubs which were established in 1984 (see Chapter 1, this volume). According to Introvigne, in this layer of the organization one could “fi nd a defi nite ritual and an actual initiation ceremony, with a set of symbols taken from the Masonic-Templar efforts of Jacques Breyer” (1995: 274). The third and central layer of the organization, to which only the most trusted members of the Archedia Clubs were invited, was the secret International Order of Chivalry Solar Tradition (founded in 1984), which later changed its name to the Order of the Solar Temple. To further complicate matters, a fourth organization existed: the Golden Way Foundation (previously called La Pyramide), which had been founded by Di Mambro, served as the parent organization of the Amenta and Archedia Clubs. The order was most successful in French-speaking countries but tried, unsuccessfully, to establish itself in the English-speaking world, particularly in the USA and Australia. In the English world the order was known by at least two names: the Order TS and the Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali. Compared to other Rosicrucian and Templar organizations the Solar Temple was a comparatively small organization. At the height of the order in 1989 it had a total of 442 members: 90 in Switzerland, 187 in France, 53 in Martinique, 16 in the USA, 86 in Canada, and 10 in Spain (Mayer 1996: 54).The Order of the Solar Temple was organized in the fashion of a Masonic initiatory society with a strict hierarchy divided into different degrees. As in Craft Freemasonry, the Solar Temple had three degrees: Frères du Parvis, Chevaliers de l’Alliance, and Frères des Temps Anciens (Brothers of the Court, Knights of the Alliance, and Brothers of the Former Times). It is unclear whether or not these three degrees make up the Solar Temple, or if they constitute an even more secret and inner group. At least one source suggests that by 1990 the Rule of the Solar Temple “described an order under the absolute authority of a secret inner group called the Synarchy of the Temple,” which consisted of the above three degrees (Hall and Schuyler 1997: 294). In order to attain these degrees, members had to undergo a rite of initiation for each degree. The number and titles of the offi ciants in the rituals of initiation vary in the different rituals and it is thus impossible to give a clear picture of how the local “sanctuaries” were organized. In the “The Dubbing of a Knight” ritual of the Order TS the following offi ciants are mentioned: Priest, Deacon, Ritual Master, Matre, Chaplain, Sentinel, Master of Ceremonies, Guardian, and Escorts. The Rituals of the Solar TempleThe practice of rituals appears to have been the core activity of the Solar Temple. These rituals seem to have been highly elaborate and suggestive, and the experience of the rituals was often enhanced by the use of operatic music and visual effects, and possibly by hallucinogenic drugs (Palmer 1996: 306). The visual effects included"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation145lightning effects through which apparitions of the Masters appeared, and objects such as the Holy Grail materialized (Mayer 1999: 217). The rituals of the Solar Temple can be divided into two categories: magical/mystical rituals and rituals of initiation. The fi rst category allegedly included sex magic practices (Introvigne 1995: 276) in which couples practiced “sperm drinking” (Palmer 1996: 311). The extent to which such practices actually occurred is, however, unclear. According to Susan J. Palmer, the Solar Temple constructed “special underground sanctuaries which were concealed behind false walls and reached by secret passages, requiring the ritual descent of 22 steps (Palmer 1996: 311). It is not stated to what the 22 steps refer, but given the esoteric context they probably allude to the 22 paths on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. An unpublished ritual entitled “Ceremony of the 4 Elements,” which was issued by Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali, gives a clear picture of the types of rituals that were practiced by the Solar Temple. This ritual is a full-moon meditation which brings together several Cenacles (local bodies) and “provides an opportunity to focalize cosmic energies and attract them to nourish the Egregore of the Temple and permit the realization of the Great Work.” The meditation is directed by a Magister of the Cenacle, who for that occasion is called the Magister Offi ciant, and all members of the order from the grade of Brothers of the Parvis are invited. Every aspect of the ritual is regulated in detail, from how the objects in the meeting room should be placed, who should say what, where the members should sit and how they should move, to how loud the music should be played (“never too loud”). It is further stated that the Collegium (each page of the document has the text “Exclusive property of the Collegium” at the bottom) requests with fi rmness and vigor that the instructions are followed to the letter, and that “Personal improvisations or modifi cations even if well meaning, will not be tolerated for this ceremony or any other.” The ritual begins with the Magister instructing the members to relax, after which he guides them through a solar visualization:Fratres and Sorores, together, let us imagine a shower of golden white particles ... of which the source emanating from the Father is a Luminous Centre of Power, of Energy and of Consciousness situated above us. It descends on us ... in us ... At each expiration it dissolves everything which is crystalized and negative in us. It descends with these impurities into the earth ... to be transformed—all that is impure ... heavy ... superfl uous. The instructions for the visualization continue with how the shower of white particles descends from the universe and passes through the head, through the body and penetrates every texture of the tissues, and then pushes downwards, fi lled with the impurities of the body to the abyss of the earth to be digested. The object of this visualization is purifi cation and regeneration “on all levels.” After the visualization the Magister Offi ciant reads a few paragraphs in which it emerges that the Solar Energies are also called the Christ Light, and that this light or energy is considered to purify the members of the Solar Temple and assist them to “participate in the evolutionary movement of Kingdoms and Beings from Darkness to Light.” After 60"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple146seconds of music, the Master of Ceremonies lights four colored candles which refer to the four elements: blue candle for earth, yellow candle for air, green candle for water, and red candle for fi re. When each candle is lit, an offi ciant reads a short text in which the qualities of the element are described. The text for the fi re element is especially evocative:Wild fl ames/that dance on human hearths,/from the victims of convention,/your Fire you hide.Yet a redemptive glory/of Light and of Love/attracts to its bosom/the revealed Christ-bearer,/who shall be consumed in the Grail/in the purple forces of Agni.Crowning the portal,/the North,/like an incandescent volcano,/in a blazing furnace/breathes into Life,/Universal Womb of the Worlds,/the Fire of the Spirit,/Immanent Light of the Father. And by Divine Marriage,/through the Power of perpetual movement,/rubifi ed Alchemy/remounts in the South./Magical Gold of a crimson diamond,/forged in the Athanor of the fl aming Sword,/densifying its Pure Essence/from the Unity of All,/Melts into the Glowing Life of Immortality. Following some music the Magister Offi ciant tells the members that the power of the four elements enters the Oratory from the four cardinal points and blooms in the middle, and he continues with a short prayer in which, among other things, he asks the Lord that they “become a clear channel for Thy Will and the humble servant of Thine Action.” After some additional music the ritual closes with the words “I return the profane light to the profane world, so that the true Light may shine forever in our hearts.” According to the document, this ritual should be performed once a month at the full moon and it probably gives a good picture of the type of ritual practiced by the members of the Solar Temple. The rituals of initiation of the Solar Temple can be described as typical neo-Templar Masonic rituals which incorporate symbols and concepts from alchemy, Rosicrucianism, and New Age. Surprisingly little has been published about the Solar Temple rituals of initiation, the only exception being a short description of a videotaped ritual (Hall and Schuyler 1997: 295). The rituals of initiation were secret and it is stated that “The text of this Ceremony remains the sole property of the Collegium which retains the right to request its immediate restitution at any moment without any explanation. It is understood that no copy of any kind shall be made. All offi cers must promise this on their honour.” The so-called “Reception Ceremony” of the Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali constitutes the “Offi cial Entry” or the initiation into the fi rst degree (Templi Noviciae). As in all the other rituals of initiation of the Solar Temple that I have been able to examine, the ritual is written not for just one candidate but rather for a group of candidates. The candidates (referred to as aspirants in the document) are instructed to wear navy-blue suits for men and off-white clothing for women, and are told to shower before arriving. Before the rite begins the candidates are given a copy of the oath they are about to take so that they can familiarize themselves with it and meditate on it. This practice is not common in most Masonic initiatory"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation147societies in which the oath is not divulged prior to actually taking it. The ritual objects include a table or an altar with a large white tablecloth, a Prie-Dieu or red cushion, a Templar cross, a sword, a red rose in a vase, a three-branch candelabrum with white candles, a Bible open at the Gospel of St John (or other sacred book requested by the postulant), a red votive candle, matches, incense, and the crosses to be given out to the new members. A total of six offi ciants are required for the ritual, and its opening is very simple compared to other Masonic rituals. It consists of playing the “Toccata” by Bach, lighting the votive candle, and then ushering in the assembly. The chief offi ciant then lights the three candles of the candelabrum and the incense, says a few words of opening, and then calls all to prayer. After the prayer he explains the purpose of the ritual (namely to receive new members), and then instructs the members to meditate on the importance of the act the aspirants are about to perform. The candidates are then brought into the room while the recorder plays a Gregorian chant. The chief offi ciant welcomes them and asks them if they are still determined to continue, to which the candidates should answer one by one. The candidates are then seated and the chief offi ciant informs them that the taking of the oath “reaches beyond human limitation,” and that they should remember that, from now on, their whole life will be dedicated to the “Path of Service, of Light, and Unity.” He further declares that “at this instant, with the help of the Egregore of the Temple and with the benediction of the Cosmic Masters, your fi eld of consciousness will broaden and your scale of values will change, giving the full signifi cance to the notions of Honour, Loyalty, Courage, Disciple and Effort.” The main concern of the candidates should from now on be “to preserve and respect the Consciousness of Life, to maintain Harmony and radiate Love,” and “to develop and intensify the Christ Light in the service of the Law.” Then either the Chancellor or Vigia (the latter offi ce appears to be restricted to female members) proceeds to instruct the candidates in the meaning of the symbols of the degree, which include the Templar cross, the sword, the red rose, the three-branched candelabrum, the Bible, the red votive candle, the incense, the Talar, the cloak, and the Beauceant. The symbolism of the red votive candle is worth noting:THE RED VOTIVE CANDLE: Divine Presence in the midst of men, reminds us that the Fire of the Spirit abides in the heart of each atom of matter. Symbol of Purifi cation, Illumination and Love, it is the likeness of Spirit and Transcendence. The candidates in turn approach the altar, kneel on their right knee, place their right hand on the sacred book, read the oath aloud, and then sign it. The chief offi ciant then formally declares that the aspirants have reached the degree of Templi Noviciae and gives them a cross as a visible token of their degree. The cross is the “Sacred Emblem of our Venerated Order, is its symbol and guarantor.” It is further explained that the cross has been blessed by an “Offi cial Priest” during a special ceremony, and that the members should wear it at all meetings. This part of the ritual ends with the congregation reciting the “Templar Psalm”:"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple148NON NOBIS DOMINE NON NOBISSED NOMINI TUO DA GLORIAM (three times)NOT FOR US, LORD, NOT FOR USBUT TO THY NAME GIVE GLORY. This psalm is to be found in all the Solar Temple rituals of initiation that I have examined. After the chief offi ciant has extinguished the fl ames of the candelabrum and votive candle, he declares his work to have come to its end and with the recorder playing Hallelujah “fairly loud,” everybody except the Master of Ceremonies and the Guardian leaves the room. The “Reception Ceremony” of Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universali is a surprisingly simple ritual, and its two most important parts are the instruction in the meaning of the symbols of the degree, and the taking of the oath. Unfortunately, the oath is omitted in the document, but in a ritual entitled “The Dubbing of a Knight” of the Order TS an oath of the order is printed in full, giving us a picture of the nature of the oaths taken in the Solar Temple:THE OATH OF THE KNIGHT OF THE COVENANT(Knight of the White Cloak)I .................... swear here and now a solemn oath to nobly serve the cause of the Temple, in a spirit of detachment and humility.I shall strive in all circumstances to maintain a worthy and just attitude, not only with regard to my co-disciples, but also whenever I represent our Venerable Order in the world.I promise to respect the sacred rules of the Temple which rule our Venerable Order, to live them permanently in accordance with the Ethic which constitutes its force and to obey the directives of my Superiors without reserve.I commit my self to respect and conform to the customs and laws of the countries in which I might be called to serve. “The Dubbing of a Knight” is not an admission ritual into the Solar Temple (or the Order TS) but a higher degree, possibly for the second degree. It is clearly stated in the document that a knight can only be dubbed by the Grand Master (that is Di Mambro himself), the Deputy Grand Master, or by “a Dignitary specially appointed by the High Authorities of the Order.” It is further stated that the candidates to be knighted must observe a complete fast during the day of the ceremony, and follow a light diet without meat for three days before the ceremony. The candidates wait from two to three hours in an antechamber, during which they are supposed to meditate and familiarize themselves with the oath of the Knight before they are admitted into the temple. The ritual is markedly Catholic in nature and includes a mass which is performed simultaneously—described as a shortened form of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation149the Holy Eucharist, and it begins with a priest who asperges himself, the altar, the sanctuary, and the assembly while saying the following prayer:In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.May the Lord purify me that I may worthily perform his service.In the Strength of the Lord do I repel all evil from His Holy Altar and Sanctuary,And from this House, wherein we worship Him;and I pray our Heavenly Father that He will send His holy Angel to build for usa spiritual Temple through which his strength and blessing may be poured uponHis people. Through Christ our Lord. The Escorts then go to the antechamber and blindfold the candidates and then lead them into the temple, facing the altar in the east. The lights are switched off, and for a moment everything is in total darkness and silence. At the sound of a gong the Escorts remove the blindfolds and music is turned on (for example, Don Carlos), and colored spotlights are slowly turned on. The seven-branched candelabrum is lit and gradually the whole temple is illuminated. After a brief explanation by the Ritual Master of why the group has gathered, the priest blesses the candidates and then continues with the Eucharist in a low voice while the rite continues. Some of the basic principles of the order are then explained to the candidates in turn by the Matre, the Chaplain, the Sentinel, and the Ritual Master. It is explained that the members of the order are the Knights of the Temple: “We are the survivors, the Incarnated Ones from the Heavens, the new Templars.” It is further explained that they are, among other things, Guardians of the Holy Grail and that their commitment carries a “solemn importance both for [their] own future as well as the future of the entire planet.” This apparently involves a new “State of Consciousness,” which implies a new comprehension of existence, where “spirit and matter are one.”After the oath has been taken, the Ritual Master informs the new knights that they have progressed spiritually and that they have been watched over by the “Masters” and that, if they are worthy, they might encounter the “Hidden Ones.” The priest then gives each candidate the communion, and then the “most solemn moment” of the ritual takes place: they are dressed in the White Cloak. Following this, the candidates are ordered one by one to advance to the prie-dieu and kneel on their right knee. The Ritual Master then dubs them by touching on the right shoulder, on the left shoulder, then on the head, reciting: “By virtue of the powers vested in me by the function that I exercise in this Lodge, I now promote you to the rank of a Knight.” The candidates are then invited to take their place in the Circle of Knights, and after some additional instructions by the Ritual Master the ritual ends after the so-called Grail Song has been sung. Just like the “Reception Ceremony,” the “The Dubbing of a Knight” is a comparatively plain ritual and the teachings conveyed are simple by nature, especially if compared to the “Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross” of the Order TS. This has also survived in a slightly shorter version, called the “Traditional Ritual for the Donning of the Talar” of the Hermetica Fraternitas Templi Universi. The"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple150central part of the ritual consists of the candidate (with his or her head covered in a black veil) being led round the temple, and at each cardinal point being instructed by a different offi ciant in the teachings of the order. At each station is a colored candle which corresponds to one of the four elements, just as in the “Ceremony of the 4 Elements.” Given the Solar Temple’s fi ery end, the Watcher’s instructions at the north station, which correspond to the fi re element, are particularly ominous: Death is the same for us all.It is how we leave Life that makes the difference.But always rememberthat Death is an illusion.In fact,It is only another aspect of Life.At this Station, let me tell youthat you must also consider Lifeas ephemeral as smoke passing by,or a cloud drifting overhead,and all its gloryis like a fl ower in the meadowwhich unfolds in the morning and dies at eventide.In the world of illusions,all must pass away.Everyone must one day confrontThe great problem of Deathwhich alone gives meaning to Life.You must be able to die to the profane worldin order to be born again to the Cosmic World.Therefore, let the quality and the wholeness of Lifecompensate for its shortness.You, wishing to be a Knight of the Temple,Do not think of living according to Cosmic Good.And since nothing is more uncertainthan the hour of Death ...prepare yourself each day to be FREEto leave this Earth and to continue on a parallel Invisible plane,free from all human and terrestrial chainswhich keeps you prisoner of yourself."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Death as Initiation151The other signifi cant part of the ritual is the purifi cation of the candidate, which culminates in the donning of the Talar or white robe. Following a short prayer by the Chaplain, the Master of Ritual conducts the purifi cation in which he says, among other things: “increase your efforts to purify yourself, to purify yourself always and forever, not through mortifi cations, deprivations and imposed penance ... For it is not your body, but your Soul and Heart that must be purifi ed.” It is explained that the Talar symbolizes purity, unity, force, and “the choice of Light and Knowledge,” and that it is consecrated by the Spiritual Masters, the latter described as “intermediary between God and us.” Before the actual donning, the candidate takes an oath (which unfortunately is not included in the document), and is then asked to take off their clothes, leaving only their underwear, while saying:[T]he moment has come for youto purify yourself/selves, casting offall impurities, all habits andall the human conditionswhich keep you prisoner of the material world.Symbolically, rid yourself of theseby taking off your worldly clothes. As the candidate dons the Talar, the ritual draws to a close, but prior to this the Master of Ritual urges the candidate to:always remain worthyof wearing this Sacred Robewhatever may happen,even if your physical life is in danger,for you will soon learnthat physical life is of no importance.By October 1994, it would become clear that this was not to be interpreted metaphorically, but literally. Concluding Remark: The “Transit” as InitiationAs a rule, scholars who have attempted to explain the suicides and homicides of the Solar Temple have focused on the two leaders of the movement, Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret. For instance, Lewis explains that he focused on “the founder of the OTS because his idiosyncrasies provide keys for understanding the Solar Temple’s fi nal ‘transit’” (Lewis 2005: 313). The role of the leaders of a “suicide cult” is undoubtedly particularly important in trying to understand the motivating factors for such extreme groups as Heaven’s Gate, the People’s Temple, and the Solar Temple, but at the same time such a focus runs the risk of avoiding the question of what motivated the members to follow their leaders in death. Strategies of authority"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple152notwithstanding, suicide must appear as a plausible option for the members in order for them to carry out such a drastic action. In the case of the Solar Temple, I would argue that a close reading of the rituals of initiation and the esoteric context of the movement can afford us with at least a partial key to understanding why the members (or at least some of them) chose to join the transit. Through the rituals it is possible to understand the symbolical universe of the members and thus to place the transit within a frame of reference. In common with rituals of many other Masonic initiatory societies, a recurrent theme in the rituals of the Solar Temple is the notion of purifi cation. As demonstrated by the “Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross,” it is not the body which needs to be purifi ed, but rather the “soul and heart.” This spiritual purifi cation is a common feature in Western esotericism, particularly in spiritual alchemy which sees the alchemical process as a transmutation leading from “lead to gold,” from unenlightened to enlightened. In a ritual entitled “Passage of the Surplice” of the Order TS the candidate is ritually purifi ed through a symbolic crucifi xion:My Brother/s, nothing happens by chance, everything is acquired by effort, consciousness and trials. Thus before reaching this new level, you have to pass through the Cross and the Labyrinth of Transmutation. As a sign of self-sacrifi ce, and with deep humility, lie down with your face resting on the ground, with your arms extended in the form of a cross; lie down as did our Brothers of the Ancient Times. The candidate is then guided in a meditation which takes him through the “7 Halls of Wisdom” in which he banishes in turn Pride; Envy, Covetousness and Jealousy; Avarice; Greed; Sloth and Disorder; Anger and Maliciousness; and fi nally, in the seventh hall, Lust. The identifi cation of a symbolic crucifi xion with spiritual purifi cation is important as it highlights the fact that death was interpreted as an initiation among the members of the Solar Temple. This identifi cation of death with initiation is stressed a number of times in the rituals, for instance in the “Ritual for the Donning of the Talar and the Cross,” where it is said that “You must be able to die to the profane world in order to be born again to the Cosmic World.” Statements like this are not uncommon in religious literature in general, but they would usually be interpreted in a metaphorical way as alluding to the fact that the spiritual seeker should not be constrained by the values of profane society but instead focus on his inner self. In the Solar Temple, however, the notion of transmutation and death to the profane world went beyond a mere metaphorical interpretation:The Testament claimed that what the OTS was about to do was not suicide, but something radically different. The Templars—as explained in more detail in three videos sent to a French Templar together with the written documents—through the force of the Blue Star (connected to Sirius) were expected to reach Jupiter where they could eventually become secret Masters themselves.

This paper analyzes the compensatory thrust towards sacredness, and examines its modes inside the Ordre du Temple solaire (Order of the Solar Temple, or OTS), whose ideology was fi rmly rooted in its will to escape nuclear and ecological disaster. The focus will be on the function of the Absolute in the transformation of the human species as viewed by the order.The Trialectics of Master–Mediator–MemberThe hermeneutics of the Romanian philosopher Mircea Eliade (1907–86) are helpful in establishing a pertinent line of analysis. His general approach is phenomenological, and he used the term hierophany to defi ne the manifestation of the sacred through different modes, such as locations, plants, objects, forms, rites, myths, symbols, animals, human beings. The hierophanic process is constituted by three elements: a) the object or physical being; b) the invisible force and c) the mediator, or the sacred object or being. For example, the tree Yggdrasill, Jacob’s ladder, the Golgotha mount, and the consumption of the Vedic beverage soma transforming the offi ciant into a cosmic giant all have in common the function of elevating one to heaven. In the case of the OTS, the “transit” of the chosen members towards Sirius via Jupiter by the pseudo-alchemical method of “calcination,” whose power of representation is evaluated in this paper, plays this role. The mediator is separated from the profane world, with its spatial and temporal limits, in order to rejoin the source, the “divine.”On the collective level, the dialectic of sacred/profane is translated into the Cosmos/Chaos duality. Space is not homogenous: it is discontinuous and oriented around a fi xed point or central axis, the Axis Mundi or World Center. Likewise, primordial time (ab origine, ab initio, in principio, or in illo tempore) is reactualized by rites in temples (templum-tempus) or other sacred places representing the cosmic pillar (universalis columna). Sacred time is reversible or circular because the perfection of its beginnings is linked in a complementary manner to the eschatological dissolution of the profane world. Thus, rebirth in the eternal present can be accomplished in"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple156any sacred time or place. This is the reason why the 33 Sages of the Rosicrucians (33 Sages or Frères aînés de la Rose+Croix)—“these carriers of the original fi re”1from the astral dimension, venerated by the followers of the order—were dwelling in an underground city in Zurich (Switzerland). This reference group’s mission was to regenerate humanity by alchemical means.Since Eliade’s ultimate perspective is theological, Régis Debray’s “atheological” perspective offers a compensatory solution. However, in order to avoid the excessive materiality of Debray’s mediology (médiologie), which gives primacy to the instruments of transmission, Freud’s psychoanalysis and the philosophy of Manuel de Diéguez, who presents himself as a “mystical atheist,” will be resorted to, along with other thinkers.Representation AidsAs we have already learned, the Solar Temple was led by a trio of very different personalities: Joseph Di Mambro,2 Luc Jouret,3 and Michel Tabachnik (1942–).4 The eclecticism of the order is obvious: it proclaimed that it belonged to the Templar tradition, but also to gnosticism and esotericism, while picking up on the most popular themes of the New Age. However, the primordial theme of fi re or light led the order’s destiny. The fi ery ritual massacres performed by the order were rooted in the medieval tradition of the stake,5 the “purifi cation” altar of the human soul.The order owned a great deal of real estate—some 80 houses or estates—throughout the world: in Switzerland, metropolitan France, Martinique, Canada, Monaco, and Australia. Of particular importance was the organic Sacré-Cœur farm in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade (Quebec), which was considered a refuge of the elect 1 Videocassette Joseph d’Arimathie—message, internal OTS document watched by its most faithful followers just prior to the 1994 slaughters; cited in Jean-Marie Abgrall, Lessectes de l’Apocalypse, p. 207. All passages from the French documents cited here are my translation.2 Originally a jeweler, Di Mambro participated in the Rosicrucian movement for a long time before creating his own organizations, including La Pyramide and the Golden Way Foundation. Notwithstanding, many exoteric organizations (Archedia Clubs, for example) centered on health issues and personal development, which served as a cover for the recruitment of future members of the Solar Temple. Although physically unattractive, Di Mambro was nonetheless an outstanding organizer.3 Holder of a PhD diploma, the homeopathic doctor was moreover cultured, brilliant, a socialite, a smooth talker, fl attering, attractive, and charismatic. In short, he had all the qualities of the perfect recruiting agent.4 Tabachnik was a well-known orchestral conductor, and created a musical language called Sirius. He was president of the Golden Way Foundation from 1981 to its dissolution in 1990.5 In France, the original Order of the Knights Templar was abolished by King Philip IV. In 1314, Grand Master Jacques de Molay was condemned to the stake along with, according to tradition, 53 Templars."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Quest for the Absolute Sun157for when the Apocalypse came as it was equipped with a nuclear bunker. A villa in Vaucluse (France) also hid an atomic fallout shelter. In addition, the order’s houses were provided with a sanctuary, usually underground.The following is the entry formula of the initiatic ceremony pertaining to the fi rst degree in the order’s hierarchy, called the Frères du Parvis:I swear to respect the absolute secret because of its sacredness for myself and our revered Order. Aware that an immortal and cosmic order governs all life in the universe, I commit myself to respect the hierarchy of the Temple. This oath is binding towards humanity, but fi rst and foremost towards myself and the divine. 6Di Mambro magically opened the doors of the holy rooms where rituals were conducted with a remote control hidden under his cape. During nightly group performances, special effects such as electrifi ed swords producing fl ashes were used to create an impressive son et lumière, and not only objects such as the Holy Grail, but also personages such as Christ, materialized.7 A voice was heard giving orders. The assembly would witness Di Mambro’s communications with beings from the beyond. Such performances were repeated whenever the leader perceived a decline in the group’s fervor.An elaborate array of communication instruments—material or virtual—was put in place to disseminate the order’s views and actions. According to Di Mambro, the invisible Masters from the Superior Lodge of Zurich (Loge mère de Zurich) had the most advanced spectrographs, which had the capacity to register a person’s energy waves at long distance, to assess the state of their aura or current vibratory fi eld. For over $60,000 apiece, Di Mambro purchased sophisticated machines in the United States that produced holograms: great fi gures or uncommon ones, such as patriarchs dressed in white. Contact with the underground Masters (in Zurich) and cosmic Masters (on the planet Proxima) energized the organization’s operational axis.As we know, the 1994 murder-suicides of OTS members took place at three locations: Morin Heights in Quebec on 30 September and 4 October (5 deceased), Cheiry (23 victims) and Granges-sur-Salvan (25 deaths) in Switzerland from 3 to 5 October.8 These 53 deaths were interpreted as follows by their authors: “Fully conscious and without fanaticism, we have planned our transit, which is not a suicide 6 Arnaud Bédat, Gilles Bouleau and Bernard Nicolas, L’Ordre du Temple solaire.

In one of the order’s dwellings in Quebec, apparitions of Grand Master Jacques de Molay were preceded by many days of fasting and meditation. Some fi gures that materialized were 3 m tall.8 In Cheiry, most bodies were found in the sanctuary, wearing ceremonial capes.

A cocktail of drugs had softened the passage to the star Sirius and its planet Proxima, supposedly inhabited by the Supreme Masters. The leader of the rite of passage, psychotherapist Christiane Bonet, a medium since October 1994, wrote: “On the other side of the veil, death is an illusion.”13Imaginative RepresentationHere follows a brief description of some of the major esoteric symbols of the Order of the Solar Temple.The Templar forked cross, the instrument of Christ’s torture, became the spark of the Christlike light.

This respresents the philosophical formula “Sirius’s point of view,” to designate the global view of the transcendant One, in opposition to the fragmentary view of the multiple profane. The Solar Temple interpreted this formula literally.Conceptual RepresentationHere follows a brief description of some of the major concepts of the Order of the Solar Temple.The elite of the secret order visited Ayers Rock (Uluru), the sacred place of the Aborigines located in the center of Australia. Called “the realm of the First Born,” it was identifi ed with the Mountain of the Prophets, “holder of the Secret of Secrets.”16According to Di Mambro, “humanity must rediscover the original knowledge lost with the advent of free will.”17Messianism took many forms inside the order. Revealing a complex of self-deifi cation, Jouret declared he was none other than the Lamb of God, that is the Savior. By comparison, one could say that Di Mambro reserved for himself the role of God the Father, or rather the role of Zeus-Pater (Jupiter), and that the “ethereal” Tabachnik evokes the Holy Ghost. Élisabeth Huneau, a young girl suffering from personality disorders, was left by her parents in Di Mambro’s care. He took her to Deir el-Bahari in Egypt to meditate together in the temple of Queen Hatshepsut, of whom Di Mambro said she was the reincarnation. He announced a revelation: Hatshepsut would give birth to a being as powerful as Christ. Hatshepsut was made pregnant by the god Manatanus ... of whom Di Mambro was—guess what?—the reincarnation. After this “divine” episode, all had to respect “a purity zone” of many meters around Hatshepsut, who was adorned with luxurious dresses and jewels.15 Its exoteric name was Association de Recherches Culturelles, to be compared with the Académie de Recherche et de Connaissance des Hautes Sciences (ARCHS). Led by Luc Jouret and his devoted associates Hermann Delorme and Jean-Pierre Vinet, the ARC’s social goal was the training of managers on the spiritual level.16 Testament—La Rose+Croix, Marhic, p. 224.17 Jacques Guillon, “Tabachnik se présente comme un candide envoûté par Di Mambro,” AFP, 24 April 2001, accessed on the Tussier website: www.multimania.com/tussier/ots.htm (Sectes > Ordre du Temple solaire).

Other children were forbidden to approach the Immaculately Conceived. (Even the vegetables on her plate came from an off-limits garden patch.) All Solar Temple members were under her orders. She was renamed Emmanuelle in order to reaffi rm her messianic role.20“Facing the general degradation of the human race, incapable of halting its destructive impulses, facing the increasing rise of environmental, climatic, chemical, nuclear,21 military perils ... and especially in the face of police intimidation ...everywhere we have strived to reveal the Mysteries of the Great Tradition, we have decided to withdraw from this world, in full lucidity and in the plenitude of our conscience.”22Thepunishment is collective: “We, the Lords of the Flame, Guardians of the sacred SHEKINAH,23 we proclaim that a Power and Will superior to ours have seen that an irreversible disorder and chaos ruled over the Earth.

If his words were metaphorical, many of the elect chose a literal interpretation.The fundamental goal is to grant one’s “Interior Being to take the place which was assigned to him since Eternity.”28 Closely related to this goal, the order aspired to arouse in its members “the Spirit of an Eternal Knighthood.”29 The Rosicrucians promised to those joining their ranks “the greatest of all gifts: IMMORTALITY.”30“The individual progressively discovers himself to be part of the Unique (= cosmic conscience).”31 “The human being is multiple in the form but remains ONE in Spirit, ONE in Essence.”32 The transit “was accomplished ... with the real-life knowledge of an exact science and in accordance with Matter’s and Spirit’s natural rules which are truly ONE.”33 The container (the form) is multiple whilst the content (the meaning) is unique: unity is believed to be shrouded by appearances.It’s a question of discovering the genuine supreme reality of “a Universal Order whose parameters do not belong to this world.”34 “We are leaving this Earth to rediscover, in full lucidity and liberty, a Dimension of Truth and Absolute.”35The Desire for RenewalThese are the chivalrous qualities required to become part of the order: “an absolutediscretion, loyalty and faithfulness” (my italics). The goal of the order included an “ecumenical” aspect: each follower had to commit themself to create “an authentic Fraternity amongst all members of the order and those of Fraternal Organizations to build the Celestial Jerusalem.”36 However, the order met obstacles that would have prevented it from accomplishing its mission.

The order’s elite aspired to escape from matter’s density but, being too heavy, they needed to shed their bodies in order to transit by the “relay-star” Sirius and join the Masters, these “entities of light, in the image of the risen Christ.”39As mentioned above, during the last meeting on 24 September 1994, before the mass deaths, the order was renamed the Alliance Rose Croix (ARC) so as to reach “the irreversible stage of the return to the Father”40 and the Vth Reign, that of the Spirit, where hierarchies would be abolished.41 The herald completely dressed in black who announced that the ARC had succeeded the Ordre du Temple solaire was none other than Michel Tabachnik. He later claimed that this was only a metaphor. Nevertheless, the corpses at Cheiry formed an arc. Also, it should be noted that Tabachnik was the author of the Archées, alchemical texts used at the third degree of initiation.42 The Archées—a collection of 21 articles of 15–20 pages each, written between 1984 and 1989—are considered abstruse even by the followers of the order. These texts were part of the order’s teaching, and French judge Luc Fontaine concluded that it “had a dimension of absolute since it was supposed to be offi cially 38 Testament—Aux épris de Justice, Marhic, p. 221.39 Acaccio Pereira, “L’OTS, une secte qui avait fait de la mort ‘le cœur de sa doctrine’,” Le Monde, 17 August 2000, www.multimania.com/tussier/ots.htm (see note 17).40 Acaccio Pereira, “La nébuleuse de l’Ordre du Temple solaire,” Le Monde,16 August 2000, and “Le procureur a requis cinq ans de prison contre Michel Tabachnik dans l’affaire de l’OTS,” Le Monde, 28 April 2001, ibid. This theme was not only included in the speech delivered by Michel Tabachnik during the meeting, but earlier in his writing was titled “Épiphanie 91”.41 Les Cahiers de Sarah assert that “humanity can be classifi ed into fi ve categories: the mineral man, the vegetal man, the animal man, the human man and the divine man.” The Vth Reign is supposed to be “the logical outcome of the cosmic and human evolution.” Cited in Abgrall, p. 192, note 1, and p. 193.42 It seems that the arc was a mascot symbol in Tabachnik’s life: in 1982 the conductor composed a work called the Arch (for soprano and orchestra) for the city of Geneva. The same year, the property management company ARCH, jointly run by his wife Sabine Reutter, bought a building at Le Barroux in the Vaucluse, where Di Mambro and other members of the order were often seen. It came to be known at the end of 1996 that the Alliance Rose Croix (ARC) was installed at 41 Ramey Street, in the 18th district in Paris; Tabachnik’s Parisian pied-à-terre was located in the same building.

At fi rst they had envisaged what one could call a “sublimation,” that is, a transport by fl ying saucer to Proxima. Later, an energetic transit by the alchemical test of calcination to reintegrate the primordial cosmic energy was favored. Jacques Breyer’s doctrine of “carbonization of bodies,” which claims that the power of fi re is suffi cient to prompt the energetic leap, was adopted literally by the order.45The fusion of the image and the concept took place in the overexcited minds of the cosmic elect. By burning their bodies, the pyromaniac superego has consumed its own support. Thus, contrary to expectations, the protection of the order’s sacred places against nuclear fi re turned out to be ineffective.An Unlimited Dilatation, or the Jupiter ComplexWhy has the fate of the Ordre du Temple solaire been so tragic? The swindles are only a small part of the explanation. The spiritual adventure of the order—of Joseph Di Mambro, Luc Jouret, and Michel Tabachnik in particular—was rich in resources (especially in the communication department) but poor in critical thought. The sharing of an inauthentic knowledge was arbitrarily reserved for a few members, especially those who were rich and submissive. In correlation, the knowledge that remained secret acted as a magnet on the minds of other members. The liberty of the followers, and above all that of their children, was wolfed down by the “sociospriritual” ambition of the order’s leaders. They liked to think of themselves as the privileged spokespersons of an authority from the beyond.

However, the fall was a shared responsibility. Here is the cut-and-dried testimony of former Solar Temple member Hermann Delorme:No one had pointed a gun at my head to make me join the Order .... I could easily cry out that the people of the order had manipulated me, enslaved me, brainwashed me, indoctrinated me. There is some truth in that assertion. The rest of the truth, the biggest part, is my responsibility.46Another OTS ex-follower (and survivor of the murder-suicides), Thierry Huguenin, was convinced that “the Masters [moved] in mysterious ways.”47 The pursuit of superior goals justifi ed resorting to special effects or illusions; even when their secret was discovered, the belief of many followers remained intact. Automanipulation is one side of mental manipulation. This is the syndrome of the shepherd:48 the crossing of immoderate aspirations between leaders and their followers produces an osmosis of megalomaniac willpowers.The naïve dilatation of the New Age eclecticism, on the horizontal, was centered on the superfi cial appropriation of the Templar tradition, on the vertical. The expansion of an ego with a narcissistic immanence toward total reality found its stake in the class of the supreme Masters: “The absolute on the ordinate creates fullness on the abscissa.”49 Reiterated pan-psychic communication between the two swelled to deadly paranoia because the average ego of the follower trapped itself in the infi nite mutual refl ection of the mirrors of a captive message.If Freudian psychoanalysis defi nes secondary narcissism as the investment of the psychic drive targeting the ego as “a system of linking representations between themselves,”50 in my opinion, tertiary narcissism consists in a systemic closure absorbing any phenomenon by making it serve as a foil to the ego bewitched by itself: that is, imprisoned in the infi nite lock of a knowledge transformed in an incantatory solipsism. This apparently perfect linking becomes an unquestionable certainty: the expansive ego identifi es itself with the external reality, refl ecting astrophysical or cosmological knowledge. Finally, obsessed by the omnipotence and omniscience attributed to the divine superego, the blind id suggests to the hallucinated ego their own defi nitive sacrifi ce, aiming for the fusion of the three levels of the psyche into a single one, but turning out to be a deluding superegoic effi gy since it is totalitarian.46 Monique Giguère, “L’admiration demeure malgré tout,” Le Droit (from Québec’s Le Soleil), 12 October 1996, p. 18.47 Thierry Huguenin, Le 54e.

Mimetism (unconscious imitation) turns out to be an incomplete explanation: we need to understand why these luminous superior entities have suddenly appeared from nothingness.Out of Nothingness ExperienceIn the life of our species, each body is animated by an idea or a system of ideas, and any idea occupies, or has occupied, a body. The capacity of unfolding the body/spirit pair has been suppressed in the Solar Temple’s approach by an idolatrous fi xation on a metaphor or concept. Because the stellar light of Sirius was immortality in the mind of the followers of the order, reaching this much desired absolute meant the outcome of the quest for a perfect life. By this icono-stasis (etymologically, the fi xation of the image) of Sirius, the followers of the order hoped to seal the existential gap which opens up in these vulnerable beings: the “developing humans.” It was thus believed that this gap could be closed by the turgidity of the tautological loop: ego = universe = Ego. The quest of so many followers, directed on an absolutist imaginary model—or “Sirius’s point of view”—led to the fatal outcome, absolutist whatever the mode, full or empty:The actual man feels abandoned, dreadfully lonely. His interior emptiness is necessary to the investment by the conscience. When completely stripped of everything, plenitude will happen. Thus, by his own divinity, the mere mortal will give way to the Man-God: the Future Solar Race.53To avoid this deadly trap, the philosopher Manuel de Diéguez exhorts learning to “live in nothingness.” It is a question of mastering recurrent existential anguish, or 51 Or the imitatio dei – that is the imitation of the epic of the gods to accomplish the salvation project.52 Testament—Transit pour le futur, Marhic, p. 227.53 Les Cahiers de Sarah, cited in Abgrall, p. 196."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple166what the sociologist Peter Beyer considers as a “perceived insecurity” linked to a new situation of rupture.The anxiety inherent in the unfi nished process of globalization gives rise to debates on its unbridled expansion, contradictions, crises or confl icts.54 Because of the mutual links between the state or political power and international new religious movements—for example, the infi ltration at the top of the public company Hydro-Québec by the OTS55—the increase in the searing dangerousness of new religions rather than in their numbers requires the sharpest vigilance.56With the growth of new religions, “residual matters” dramatically re-emerge, such as “personal or group identity ..., ecological threats [and] increasing disparities in wealth, power, and life chances both within and between regions,” which are of religious affi nity.57 The feeling of existential “non-fulfi lment” stated by philosopher Régis Debray then ensues; this can, however, be assumed and transformed in the creative will to surpass oneself. Taking up this challenge is prevented by the trap of idolatry: “Since the most ancient times, our disabled encephalon exteriorizes fantastic effi gies, elevating them to the rank of cosmic persons and giving them an existence outside the conscience.”58Sacred—or even profane—stories enhance the fi ction of entities holding an extrahuman omniscience or omnipotence, divinities for example. The interstices of the discourse from which they emerge are as many blind spots before any examination—necessarily blasphemous.

CampicheWhen addressing the topic of sects, we are faced with the problem caused by the representations that we have of what is religiously “incorrect.” These representations are fueled above all by the media, which have been paying increasing attention to religious issues, especially since the year 2000. This interest has developed in close correlation with sociocultural changes that have been affecting both the area of mass communication and religion. We need only think of the hold of emotional elements or of the transformation of the relationship with authority. Therefore we should not be surprised to observe that the “dramatization of the religious sphere by the media” is—at least partially—beyond the control of even the best-organized religious institutions, and obeys laws that regulate their own discourse.Furthermore, the relationship that the producer of images, spoken words and texts maintains with the religious sphere cannot help having an impact on the product. In other words, the process of individualization that characterizes modernity is to be considered as a matter of priority when attempting to understand some aspects of transformation of the representations of the religious sphere, which have an effect on religious change itself.1Media and Religion in Connection with the Suicide-Massacre of the Ordre du Temple Solaire2Four quotations will serve as my theoretical basis.The media are not merely communication agencies of a technologically advanced kind engaged in the transmission and diffusion of information.

It contains some elements of the line of argument developed below; the latter has been expanded on with the comments made by numerous colleagues further to the publication of the above-mentioned book.

They operate impersonally in perfect congruity with the increasing depersonalization of the role-articulated social system. But they also imitate communal culture and manipulate the symbols of a more intimate and personal world.3This media culture extends to the sphere of religion, where the media are not content with reproducing specialists’ opinions but prefer to position themselves as authoritative interpreters of the phenomenon in question.The media obey their own laws as far as perception of reality is concerned. Only someone who knows and cracks this code is able to relativize the way in which the media present reality. This is particularly important for a topic such as drugs and politics because the vast majority of the public is familiar with these issues, mainly through the description of them given by the media. While it is true that readers purchase the newspapers that reinforce their prejudices, the choice of titles in a region and the undifferentiated opinions on editorial staffs have a doubly negative effect on objectivity and consensus.4This observation can be transposed to the religious sphere, particularly to its poorly known “zones” of sects and “new religious movements.” The two conventional and confl icting hypotheses on the infl uence of the media, which are considered to be either “omnipotent” or “ordinary refl ections of public opinion” can be replaced by a new hypothesis on the power of the media’s impact when the public are unfamiliar with an issue.Sensational stories about the “new religious movements” do not require a knowledge of religion on the part of users of the mass media. The focus on the non-religious aspects of the movements means there is no need to address the problems relating to beliefs or religious experience. By drawing a parallel with stories of fraud, political exploitation, racketeering and crime, the public is offered a script to which it is accustomed. In short, the anti-sects movement provides journalists with material that does not require much adaptation for it to be easily ingested by a public that does not have much taste for religion.5This observation, which reinforces the hypothesis set out above, is echoed by Jean Baubérot’s6 reaction to Chapter One of Quand les sectes affolent (1995) in a personal correspondence to me:3 Bryan Wilson, “Culture and religion”, Revue suisse de sociologie, special edition, Religion et Culture, 17/3 (1991): 444. 4 Boris Boller, Der Drogendiskurs der Schweizer Presse.

Perhaps the preliminary step before a sociological approach is to allow people to dissociate themselves from the media’s gaze. (Letter dated 20 December 1995)Religiously Correct and Sectarian DangerThe way the Ordre du Temple Solaire (OTS) was treated by the media revealed the existence of what we might call the “religiously correct,” which expresses the expectation or representation that religion cannot be a source of confl ict in a secular society. This representation of what is religiously correct obscures the historical relationship between religion and violence and strengthens the theory of privatization of religion. The position can be explained if one considers that the generation of babyboomers, which believes in religion without institutions,7 is currently the generation which is in control of the media.The type of explanation put forward to explain the suicide-massacre oscillates between two levels of individual and collective argumentation. The individual explanation generally takes the route via psychology, confi rming what was observed, for example, at Waco, where credence was given to the opinions advocating abnormal individual behavior and submission to a guru.8 As for the arguments at the collective level, they form part of the familiar script: money-laundering, arms smuggling, corrupt practice. It will be noted, however, that virtually all the analyzed editorials written the day after 5 October 1994 in France and French-speaking Switzerland refer to the collapse of reference points. But none of them—with one notable exception—goes as far as to say that “human beings are religious animals who need values,” thereby explaining a religious phenomenon in religious terms.In some cases the sect was treated as a dangerous consumer product. The programe in the A bon entendeur series on French-speaking Swiss television on 25 October 1994, entitled “Sects, how to get out of them?”, is a good example. Other programmes blew out of all proportion the extraordinary features of certain religious groups, but without putting them in context or attempting to verify whether the beliefs being discredited might make sense to the persons involved (such as the programmeSans aucun doute on the French television channel TF1 on 10 January 1996).The need to put programes together in a hurry does not explain the choice of proposed interpretations, because it can clearly be seen that when the media return to the tragic event, they do not change their register but continue to treat the subject according to the script—that is, to explain the dramatic event in non-religious terms.7 The term “spirituality” indeed denotes the personal, experience-based beliefs characteristic of this generation, which are differentiated from a religion conceived in terms of dogmas and tradition.8 Beckford, p. 107; James D. Tabor and Eugene V. Gallagher, Why Waco?

Little change can be perceived in the way the problem was approached and the “sixty-nine dead in the name of a sect” were covered (53 in the fi rst suicide-massacre and 16 in the second). The exceptions were rare: the commentaries on French-speaking Swiss television, for example, became more moderate, leaving room for a qualifi ed explanation, differentiating between sects and paying attention to the circumstances that may cause them to “drift out of control.”The Sociologist Faced with the Force of Representations and the Emotional Factor Can one propose an analysis and an explanation that do not form part of the script? After the dramatic events at Cheiry and Granges-sur-Salvan, my reply is in the negative. It appears impossible to change or even attenuate the representation of the sect as a group of people under the sway of a “guru,” whose actions are suspect and concealed. It is even diffi cult to get people to perceive the heterogeneity of the universe of religious minorities. Stigmatization of their internal diversity, which was previously effected by religious institutions, has thus been taken over by civil society. The observation has a paradoxical aspect in light of the social legitimacy conferred on religious pluralism.Seen from this perspective, an explanation that emphasizes an analysis of religion and the religious process (seeking salvation, the quest for purity, breaking away from the world, the limits of religious recomposition) is not adopted. Yet in a secondary analysis the hypothesis claiming that the population adopts the script without any other form of examination is only partially verifi ed. Let me give some evidence of this. An analysis of about one hundred questions asked by viewers during the French-speaking Swiss television programme Table ouverte on Sunday 14 January 1996 reveals that the prime concern of those who phoned in was to obtain information, as they insistently asked for a defi nition of “sect.” Questions followed about the repression/freedom alternative, characterized by the worry about control, but in a rather partial way. It should be noted that of the three questions concerned with the causes of the dramatic event, only one placed the problem in the context of society. This observation shows the diffi culty of proposing an analysis of the relationship between social change and religious change, or of revealing religion as a component of social life.Faced with the media, the sociologist can only take note of the successive collapse of all monopoly positions when it comes to interpreting the phenomenon of religion. After the theologians, it was the turn of the social scientists to gauge the limits of their possibilities or their ability to get people to understand social phenomena. It does not suffi ce to take a critical position amid the confl icting interpretations. One still has to propose explanations that are capable of contributing to political management of “borderline” situations, such as that illustrated by the transit of the members of the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Sects, Media and the End of the World173Solar Temple, or even of creating the conditions liable to prevent a fatal outcome, such as that of Waco. In doing so, we are accepting our social responsibility.Ordre du Temple Solaire and the Recomposition of ReligionThe changes undergone by this Order deserve our attention; in many respects its trajectory might help us to understand a type of religious recomposition whose logic obeys more the law of supply and demand (depending on the circumstances, preference is given to the religious message over fashion and what attracts people) than that of building a new, more or less exclusive religious tradition. In other words, the OTS would appear to constitute a religious group with a “variable gnosis.” The promise of salvation is characteristic of any religious movement; it implies a judgment about the world. It may have been stated here in apocalyptic terms, involving the construction of bunkers and the distribution of survival kits. It may have taken the New Age route, linking the announcement of disaster and the advent of a new age prepared by self-transformational work, as was well described by Françoise Champion (1995). The announcement of salvation fi nally took the form of transit, a notion probably borrowed from astrology, esotericism or even belief in fl ying saucers,9 but accompanied by elements taken from Buddhism or Hinduism, since the idea of a return to Earth (reincarnation) was also present. The fact that the OTS leaders Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret had made use of these different elements and had incorporated them into an esoteric organization of the Rosicrucian type appears to be proven by the inquiry. Nothing tells us, however, that the members followed them along this tortuous path; like the seekers described by Wade Clark Roof (1993), they were able to make OTS a stage in their spiritual quest. In this sense, sharing the same convictions would have been less important for them than the exchange and communion brought about by similar experiences. Their attitude would therefore not be very different from that identifi ed in other religious networks today.10 These few remarks justify use of the concept of “post-New Ageorder,” which describes the OTS as an extreme and perhaps atypical version of contemporary religious recomposition.Four hypotheses can be stated about the OTS’s fi nal uncontrolled drift, in view of the fact that research aimed at understanding the “end of OTS” is far from complete. They range from the particular to the general.The fi rst is that of the logic of failure. It had already been proposed by Jacques Gutwirth (1979) in connection with the tragic end of Jim Jones’s Temple of the People in Guyana.

Survivor Thierry Huguenin’s attitude is symptomatic in this respect.11The third hypothesis, known as that of the “explosive cocktail”, explains the incompatibility of the different religious traditions to which the OTS leaders referred, either separately or by mixing them up. This hypothesis is controversial. Some people, like Carl Keller (with Raphaël Aubert), by relying on the texts, see the OTS as the pure heir of esoteric gnosis. To my mind, this argument does not hold water if one analyses the link between the producers of the texts, the texts produced and the effect brought about by the texts. In relation to the apocalyptic solution, the Age of Aquarius and transit do not constitute similar replies to the question of salvation (the effects are manifestly different). This third hypothesis explains why the existence of the OTS had to be terminated, as the contradictions were becoming too fl agrant; it does not enable us to understand the fi nal act itself but it has the advantage of asking the question about the limits of religious recomposition.I am borrowing the fourth hypothesis from psychology, although I am altering its meaning. A dissociation may have existed, based on personality disorders and the existence of a mental structure in which each of the personalities present thinks and behaves autonomously and with no relation with the other(s). This hypothesis might explain the dissociation that has been made between the religious sphere and the other spheres of social life, owing to the extreme fragmentation of our societies and growing individualization. At the same time it would make it possible to explain the incredible: that is, the ability of OTS members to conceal their intentions and to live right up to the last moment “as if nothing was going to happen.” But it also dramatically provides an example of the process of decomposition of the religious sphere, “which is said to be committing suicide” through its inability to propose a social utopia or to provide a general meaning. In short, the mental dissociation is founded on the rift between religion and the social bond, as illustrated by the tragic fate of the OTS.Thus owing to the fragility of the knowledge available to us—to which the four hypotheses set out above testify—it appears that the OTS tragedy, as covered in the media, teaches us less about the reasons that led its members to embark on the “journey to Sirius” than about contemporary representations of the religious phenomenon. The media are developing a “religiously correct” discourse, linked to the values of a democratic society, to civic-mindedness and basic morality. They are evading the fact that religious phenomena are also a force behind, and a refl ection of, social violence.11 Thierry Huguenin, Le 54e (Mesnil-sur-l’Estrée, 1995)."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Sects, Media and the End of the World175With the passing if time, one could have imagined that the OTS case would be distinguished from the case of other sects. Apparently, nothing of that kind has happened. The affi rmation that sect equals danger is now a stereotype. The questions asked by journalists on the tenth anniversary of the OTS’s suicide-massacre testify to this evolution. The use of the sociological concept of sect to nominate this type of religious organization is problematic and aims at a deontological discussion. So it is no surprise to discover in the evangelical movement a trend demanding that the communities of this Protestant tradition be called denominations instead of sects."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Appendix 1The Testaments1To All Those Who Can Still Understand the Voice of Wisdom ...

Amongst numerous members as well as the principal people in charge, Mr Jean-Pierre Vinet and Dr Luc Jouret were the victims of slander and false accusations of the most sordid kind for many months, such as: debauchery, individual or collective manipulation, swindling, illegal drug dealing, possession of weapons, etc. ...This was a great deal, especially for men whose actions have only been motivated by desire to help the Beings in search of justice and to awaken in them the Spirit of an Eternal Knighthood through the Order to which they belong.Let us remember that more than 80 agents of the Security Guard of Quebec were mobilized to launch a general investigation on the activities of the above-mentioned organizations. During this whole affair, the attitude of the Security Guard of Quebec was particularly questionable, ambiguous and cowardly. The investigation and the different police operations (the use of armored cars, machine guns, untimely arrests ...) carried out with a great deal of publicity, have cost Quebec and Canadian taxpayers more than $6 million. If it were not for its tragic and pitiful aspect, one would want to laugh at the absurdity of the affair.Throughout the investigation, unscrupulous reporters excelled in perfi dious manipulations consisting of misinforming the public. We specifi cally mention Mr Pelchat, whose responsibilities were great during this somber and nauseating spectacle.Since no proof existed, government and police offi cials strove to fabricate an evil scenario of a “plot of terrorists whose subversive activities were fi nanced by dangerous sects ...”Several members of the Solar Temple Order and of ARCHS were in this manner submitted to hateful harassment (lengthy interrogations, public arrests, blackmail, pressure from the mass media, the use of false docuuments ...). Not even their children were spared.All of this intervention, along with biased trials, fi nally ended in a conditional acquittal for misdemeanors in the case of Messrs Delorme, Vinet, and Jouret. The accused were invited to donate $1,000 to the Red Cross.Let us openly and directly pose the following questions:"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Appendix 11851) Why did the Security Guard of Quebec work to continue a senseless investigation, when their own informers confi rmed from the beginning of the affair that no criminal suspect existed on any level? Even the offi cial responsible for tapping telephone conversations for the region of Montreal confi rmed that the information was delivered to reporters during the investigation by high-ranking offi cials, answering to the Minister of the Interior, Mr Ryan, personally.2) Why was Mr Jouret identifi ed with a certain André Masse, the leader of the Q37, a hypothetical network of more than 37 terrorists whose plans were supposedly to take the lives of several politicians, including Mr Bourassa and Mr Ryan, people whose names Dr Jouret hardly knew?3) Why reveal to the Press, with a great deal of publicity, the existence of Q37 when they had never been able to establish anything about the actual existence of this group? Let us remember that the search warrants were abusively and illegally served, based on this allegation.The arguments presented by the police agents and politicians amply demonstrate their intent to conjure a plot so as to be able to intervene with total against the Solar Temple Order and ARCHS as well as their leaders.4) Why was false information ostensibly disseminated (with the support of audiovisual set-ups) regarding the existence of the traffi cking of weapons to La-Fleur, when the authorities of the Security Guard of Quebec knew perfectly well that all of the allegations were unfounded? 5) Why was Mrs Rose-Marie Klaus of Saint-Anne-de-la-Pérade pressured to appear at length on several television and radio broadcasts and in the press to confi rm the worst lies, slanders, vulgar and ill-tempered accusations? Certain authorities in the mass media have in this way deliberately taken advantage of a person who is visibly in a precarious psychiatric state.6) Why have reporters lent their support to such libelous violence concerning us? Why were all the voices that were raised in an attempt to establish the truth systematically stifl ed or muffl ed? The scenario strangely resembles the kind of manipulation of the media orchestrated by certain dictatorships.Let us remember the strange similarity between the Quebec affair and that which took place in the USA (cf. Nexus, annex2). Is this a simple coincidence, or could it rather have been staged by politicians or judicial authorities whose criminal schemes led them to fear the publicizing of certain disturbing truths? 7) Why were the contents of the teachings of the Solar Temple Order and ARCHS systematically silenced during the entire scandal, as well as those distributed by Dr Jouret through conferences, seminars, television and radio broadcasts, press releases, tapes, audiovisual documents, books, etc. ... Our detractors know too well that the only objective of these teachings is to ennoble the conscience of man.2 A reference to events in Waco, Texas, as reported in the Australian magazine Nexus."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple1868) Why does the mass media, who organized the scandal in collaboration with judicial and political authorities, obstinately refrain from clearly stating the decisions of the Court in regards to the three persons accused. 9) Why did the authorities of Hydro-Quebec, after having carried out a meticulous and costly investigation in regards to the supposed infi ltration of their company by the Solar Temple Order, get rid of Mr Vinet, one of their best managers, when all the investigations proved his innocence? Why, once again, did the Press pass over in silence the results of the investigations conducted by Hydro-Quebec?10) Why did the Security Guard of Quebec persist in systematically intimidating some members of the Order of the Temple after having destabilized this organization, when dangerous, manipulative cults, known perfectly well to the judicial authorities, devote themselves freely to their activities, endangering the mental, emotional or psychic stability of their members and of society at large? 11) Why did the authorities allow, without any reaction, certain Mohawks to appear at length on television, to describe openly and without scruples the different forms of traffi cking (cigarettes, drugs, etc.) that they devote themselves to?Why did they permit these dangerous, lawless beings to openly exhibit all their weapons (including assault weapons), which they have in their possession, without incurring minimal judicial pursuit?Why the guilty silence of the Security Guard of Quebec or of the political authorities, including Mr Ryan, against them?The cowardice of the Security Guard of Quebec is only equaled by its incompetence in controlling certain particularly dangerous groups who devote themselves with all impunity to the most horrible violence.The simple evidence once again clearly demonstrates the close bonds that exist between the Security Guard of Quebec and criminal groups such as the Mafi a, among others.Of course, it’s much easier to attack honest people, who are not broken down by the extortions of a totally deviated social structure, humanly and materially impoverished by drugs, alcoholism, pornography and other perversions which are the shame of our so-called democratic societies.Certainly everyone knows that the Security Guard of Quebec, on the eve of being granted certain credits, had to reestablish its value after having been implicated in several gross errors, clear failures in the face of robbery, the implication of certain agents in illegal traffi cking. ...The facts that have unfolded oblige us to pose the question of whom the Security Guard, originally intended to serve the citizens, actually serves.Therefore, we strongly denounce all existing authorities that have shown such cynicism and cowardice during this scandal.An article that appeared in the Australian magazine Nexus of February 1994 entitled “Towards the New World Order, The Secret Police Force of the United States” describes the situation that would come to pass at this present time in the USA."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Appendix 1187A particularly troubling coincidence between the scandal in Quebec and the Waco affair should make us refl ect on the true motives of the powers that be.This is why, in the face of this somber affair, we affi rm that the politicians, among them Mr Bourassa and mainly Mr Ryan, are responsible for having fi nanced a particularly dirty and questionable operation in order to conceal some of their own intrigues.

This is not to deny that possibly other secret organizations could have intervened in an illegal manner to organize the scandal (we were warned of the existence of offi cial police forces and other parallel forces who were seeking to destroy us).

For it is not your body, but your Soul and Heart that must be purifi ed. The Talar, The White Robe of Monks, symbolizes Purity, Unity, Force and the Choice of Light and Knowledge rather than Darkness, Ignorance and the forces of Separativity.

But if the actual clothing itself is suffi cient for the ordinary man, this must not be the case for us, Templars. In order for the Talar to be perfect and to become sacred, it must be consecrated by the Spiritual Masters, intermediary between God and us and whom I humbly represent here in this Temple.

But fi rst, let me recommend, Brothers and Sisters, that you do not try to retain everything but just allow yourself to be imbued with the essence of what is being said. The Master of ceremonies comes forward and reads.MASTER OF CEREMONIES: THE TEMPLAR CROSS is red. By its vertical branch, it forms a link through Spirit between Heaven and the Earth; by its horizontal branch it enables the manifestation of Spirit into form. For the Templars, there is no supremacy of one over the other, but a perfect and complementary Balance of Spirit and Matter. The Templar Cross is a pattee cross so as to receive at its points (its indented ends, the grail cups) the Celestial and Terrestrial Energies, to unite them and to bring them to perfection at its center, then send them out through its points with discernment to the world. THE SWORD: if, for many it is synonymous with bloody battle, for us, TEMPLARS, it is our Strength, our Courage and the symbol of our inner Fight to master our primary nature, but especially to incarnate the Word in all its Justice and its Truth. Symbol of Creative Peace, it activates the Celestial Light and enables the liberation of the Divine Being through Knowledge. The Noble Knight carries within him a vertical Sword of Light which keeps him within the LAW of the Lord and renders His manifestation possible. THE RED ROSE is the rose of Love for all. In the Temple and for the Mystic, the Red Rose, like the blood—vehicle of the soul—is synonymous with Perfection, transmutation and the perfect Realization of the Being. The Eternal and Immortal Rose bursts forth, comes into full bloom in the center of the Cross and radiates out Universal Love, LIFE, and Cosmic Consciousness through the Heart, THE THREE-BRANCHED CANDELABRUM: Universal Light of the Worlds, representing Life and Salvation. Its three lighted Flames reinforce during the Ritual the manifestation here and now of LIFE, LIGHT, and LOVE. It also symbolizes our Adhesion, our Obedience, and our Consecration to the Great Universal Principles. THE BIBLE (or other Sacred Book recognized by the Aspirant): it would not be enough to say that the Sacred Book is the Symbol of Divine Science and Wisdom. It is also the Symbol of the Universe, of Revelation through the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Appendix 2205Word and the Divine Message of Cosmic Order. Similarly, in the Quest for the Holy Grail it is the symbol of the Supreme Search that has become accessible to common mortals and where the Christ, through Jesus, shows us the Way and opens the Door. THE RED VOTIVE CANDLE: Divine Presence in the midst of men, reminds us that the Fire of the Spirit abides in the heart of each atom of matter. Symbol of Purifi cation, Illumination and Love, it is the likeness of Spirit and Transcendence. THE INCENSE raises prayer to Heaven and heightens the perception of consciousness by purifying and etherealizing the air. It associates man to Divinity, the Finite to the Infi nite, the mortal to the Immortal and seals the Covenants.THE CLOAK of the Knight is adorned with the Cross of the Temple; by putting himself under the yoke of the Cross and all that it symbolizes, the Knight works voluntarily and totally in the Service of the Temple and the Christ in Glory; he institutes within himself the preponderance of Spirit over Matter and commits himself to placing Service for Glory of the Father before profane requirements. If the Noble Knight of the Temple still wears the White Mantle, it is to affi rm his retreat into himself and into God, his non-identifi cation with the profane world and its temptations as well as his renouncement of material instinct, attesting thereby to the Continuity of the Templar Tradition. By donning the White Mantle of invincibility, invisibility, forgetfulness of self and of metamorphosis, the Noble Knight reinforces his choice for Wisdom and assumes his responsibilities and functions in the worthy Service of the Temple. THE BEAUCEANT, Banner of the Temple, represents the Mercy and Rigour of the columns supporting its Pediment. It creates a link between Heaven and Earth and symbolizes the victory of the RESURRECTED GLORIOUS CHRIST. It protects our Egregore by the power of its symbols, because all mystical Symbols are Forces in movement and action-bearing currents of Energy and Consciousness. MASTER OF RITUAL: Thank you, Master of Ceremonies. Brothers and Sisters, let us meditate for a few minutes and allow the power of the symbols we have just evoked to act within us One minute of silence."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Order of the Solar Temple206MASTER OF RITUAL: Brothers and Sisters, by the Oath you have just taken, you have now become Full Brothers and Sisters of the Temple.
