[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Mysteries of Germany's Most Secret Occult Order The hidden teachings and practices of German occultism have long held a strong fascination for the poet as well as the historian. The largest German secret lodge—the Fraternitas Saturni—revealed nei-ther its membership, its inner teachings, nor its rites. Still the most active and important magical society in Germany today, the FS has been the object of specu-lation, suspicion, and suppression. It is only through a chance occurrence that the inner documents of this order were published in Germany. The book you now hold is the first comprehensive interpretive study of these documents and of the inner workings of the FS which they reveal. Within these pages you will discover the fasci-nating stories of this order's founders and leaders. You will witness the development of its magical doc-trines and practices, its banishment by the Nazis, and its postwar dissentions and conflicts. The Saturnian degree system of initiation will be revealed in full detail, as will some of the order's unique cosmologi¬ cal and sex-magical teachings. A selection of some of the most powerful and unusual rites historically practiced by the FS are also offered. Fire and Ice throws a unique light on one of the world's darkest and most mysterious philosophical corners. It is a book of accomplished scholarship and a compendium of fascinating anecdote.

Many of the most powerful forms of magick in the West were developed to an early perfection by Teutonic magicians—Albertus Magnus, Agrippa, Paracelsus— some were even elevated to the level of legend, such as Faustus. Teutonic Magick is multifaceted—it has its own innate traditions—those of the ancient Germanic peo-ples (Anglo-Saxons, Germans, Dutch, Scandinavians) and in addition it has those of the general Western Tra-dition which they received from southern Europe in the Middle Ages—and proceeded to develop with charac-teristic scientific zeal. The world of Teutonic Magick is full of truly secret, some sinister, corners as well. Many of these—like so much else that we believe to be sinister—are thus char-acterized simply because they are unknown and per-haps also misunderstood. There are whole realms of Teutonic Magick that have largely been kept truly secret until the latter part of this century. Llewellyn's Teutonic Magick Series is the first to explore this world in a systematic and authoritative way. It will reveal the secrets of German rune magic, the obscure mysteries of Gothic Kabbalah, the magic of Faustus, and the deepest mysteries of the German occult orders such as the Rosicrucians, the Illuminati, the Fraternitas Saturni, and the dreaded FOGC-Lodge. The path of Teutonic Magick is focused on the expansion of consciousness through a will to power and knowledge—the way opened for the Teutonic magician by Woden on an archetypal level and fol-lowed by Faustus and most modern magicians."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Other Books by the Author Runes and Magic: Magical Formulaic Elements in the Older Runic Tradition, Peter Lang The Secret of the Runes (by Guido von List); translated, edited, and introduced by the author, Destiny Books The Galdrabok: An Icelandic Grimoire; translated, edited, and introduced by the author, Weiser Futhark: A Handbook of Rune Magic, Llewellyn Runelore: A Handbook of Esoteric Runology, Llewellyn At the Well of Wyrd: A Handbook of Runic Divination, Llewellyn The Truth About Teutonic Magick, Llewellyn A Book of Troth, Llewellyn Rune Might, Llewellyn The Nine Doors of Midgard, Llewellyn The Book of Ogham, Llewellyn Northern Magic, Llewellyn Forthcoming Lords of the Left-Hand Path Hermetic Magic"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Llewellyn's Teutonic Magic Series FIRE & ICE The History, Structure, and Rituals of Germany's Most Influential Modern Magical Order: The Brotherhood of Saturn by Stephen E.

Deep within this secret world there is an order known as the Fraternitas Saturni— the Brotherhood of Saturn. This can without doubt be called Germany's greatest secret lodge. The order is still the most active and important magical society in Germany today, but from its formal beginnings around 1926 until 1970 it was almost totally secret. Only through a quirk of fate did the inner documents of the order slip into the hands of those who published them in Germany. Fire and Ice coherently summarizes and presents the vast array of documents available in Ger-man concerning the FS. There is no such study avail-able on this order even in German. In this book the reader is given a rare glimpse into the inner workings and secret rites of this occult lodge. xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv / Fire and Ice The FS as it is constituted today may or may not bear any resemblance to the form of the order pre-sented in this book. What you see here comes from the period between 1926 and 1970. In exploring Fire and Ice you will be able to begin to open the hidden way to the Saturnian sphere which rules the New Age. The Saturnian path of initiation, until now only darkly perceived—as if through a mist—will be revealed. You will be able to begin to work with the magical formulas of Saturnian magic for self-development as well as for more practical or concrete ends. Fire and Ice opens the pathway to an age-old tradition of magic that influenced, and may have even formulated, the traditions in Britain and America, for example that of the Golden Dawn. The FS preserves a vibrant Thelemic current of magical tradition and practice. The old Grand Master of the order, Gregor A. Gregorius, stored up a unique Thelemic philosophy, which remained secure from public scrutiny for almost forty years. He was safe to pursue the directions and consequences of Thelema free from the influences of mediocre philosophies that elsewhere stultified and prevented it from reaching its ultimate Aeonic en¬ foldment. Fire and Ice is an important cornerstone of the Llewellyn Teutonic Magic Series; it demonstrates in contemporary and practical terms a unique current of magical culture at home in the Teutonic homeland which has greatly influenced the world beyond the borders of that region."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION The Fraternitas Saturni (FS), the Brotherhood of Saturn, has become known to English readers through fragmentary descriptions which emphasize the sen-sational, sex-magical aspects of this lodge's work or else its darker, more Satanic, side.1 This is under-standable in light of the fact that the FS is (or was) the most unabashedly Luciferian organization in the modern Western occult revival, and its practice of sex-ual occultism perhaps the most elaborately detailed of any such lodge. The FS represents a unique blend of astrological cosmology, neo-Gnostic daemonology, sexual occultism, and Freemasonic organizational principles. This grand synthesis was originally the vision of one man, the long-time Grand Master of the FS, Gregor A. Gregorius. This book is probably the first attempt ever made XV"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi / Fire and Ice in any language to present a comprehensive view of the history, organization, doctrines, rituals and prac-tices of the most powerful and influential magical lodge in modern Germany. The \"compendium\" of FS material cited in Richard Cavendish's Encyclopedia of the Unexplained is an enormous, but sometimes disorganized, trove of documentation which was collected by Prof. Dr. Adolf Hemberger of the Univer-sity of Giessen, West Germany.2 Other recent treat-ments of the FS in German have also made use of the mountains of documentary evidence, but have made little attempt to organize it comprehensively.3 Here, I will try to present an organized and comprehensive outline of this magical lodge. The reader should be advised that the author is not an initiate of the FS. However, I had the advice and consultation of the Brotherhood, as is cited in the Acknowledgments. I hope that this combination, coupled with my long-time experience in the history and practice of magic, will provide a sense of objective sympathy. The FS is an organization that has undergone several transformations during its most recent mani-festation (from about 1927 to the present). Most of the material used for this book and the ideas dis-cussed in it have been drawn from the period when Gregorius was Grand Master, or shortly thereafter (to about 1970). Therefore, it cannot be assumed that doctrines or practices discussed in these pages are in fact still a part of the current doctrines and practices of the FS in Germany. In these pages there is, however, a complete vision of the lodge, including many of its most secret"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction / xvii doctrines and ritual practices from that earlier period. A comprehensive overview of its organizational struc-ture of thirty-three degrees of initiation is one key to the understanding of the lodge's work and purpose. The chapter on the doctrines of the FS is concentrated on what is perhaps the three most unique aspects of FS doctrine: 1) the astrosophical teaching of Saturnus as the Demiurge ruling over the present stage of cos-mic evolution, 2) the strongly Luciferian aspect of this doctrine, and 3) the teachings of sexo-cosmology and sexual occultism—the Yoga of the Dark Light—as it is tied up with these theories. The rituals presented here are complete treat-ments of rites found in archival material. They amply demonstrate the liturgical scope of the Brotherhood, and provide further significant insights into their philosophy that are inaccessible in theoretical dis-cussions. After studying the doctrines of the FS for almost a decade, and after significant experimentation with a number of its formulae, I believe that the Brotherhood of Saturn indeed holds a unique place in the history of the revival of the Western magical tradition. For too long, the English-speaking magical forum has been ignorant of the exact nature of German occultism and magic. Although a great deal of \"English occultism\" is actually, or supposedly, derived from sources in her Continental sister nation (e.g. Rosicrucianism, the Golden Dawn [cf. cipher manuscripts], even the O.T.O. itself), little has been done in the way of sys-tematically analyzing this vast and vibrant world. Generally, it might be said that what the Golden"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii / Fire and Ice Dawn has been to Anglo-American occultism over the past hundred years, the Fraternitas Saturni has been to German occultism. But whereas the \"secrets\" of the GD have been published and reprinted over and over, the mysteries of the FS have—until recently— remained behind a veil of obscurity. Therefore, any-one who would really understand the depths of the magical subculture of today, be it in German or Anglo-American society, needs to have a thorough grasp of the history and doctrines of the Brotherhood of Saturn."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter I A History of the Brotherhood of Saturn Distant Roots As with all organizations of an occult nature, accurate and consistent historical data for the FS is hard to obtain. On some aspects there is an abun-dance of information, while on others we are left to speculate. In this chapter, I want to trace the history of the FS as an organization and as an idea, and at the same time remain as much as possible within the con-text of events in the contemporary occult subculture. Documents within the FS1 point to the idea that on some mystical level there is a connection between the ancient mysteries of the Germanic past and the Fraternitas Saturni. It is held that there were Satur¬ nian Brotherhoods working as early as the end of the 1600s in Sweden, Denmark, and Poland. Also, it is indicated that there is a mystical connection between he Greco-Roman Saturnian Principle {fatum, fate)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 / Fire and Ice and the old Germanic high god, Wotan, whose name is also spelled in these documents as \"Fuotan\"; hence the link with fatum. Supposedly both Hoëne-Wronski2 in the nineteenth century and Gregorius in the twen-tieth century made these connections. This Fuotan is seen as the All-ruling Principle of Fate, which does not itself succumb to the ultimate \"Twilight of the Gods.\" It is understandable in light of the neo-Romantic Ger¬ manicism prevalent in late nineteenth- and early twen-tieth-century Germany that FS doctrine would to some extent derive from the Germanic (or as they would have it, \"Aryan\") North rather than from the Mediterranean region.3 Later, it was emphasized that the Brotherhood had its origins in the rituals of the Roman Saturnalia (which takes place around Decem-ber 27th),4 which made clear the FS's tendency away from the Christian world-view and toward a darker side of things. At one point, apparently between 1927 and 1933, there was a provision of the group that only \"Christians\" (i.e., non-Jews) could be initiated and that all neophytes had to acknowledge the basic \"Nordic\" ideology of the lodge. This is mentioned to indicate the underlying belief that the FS itself has its mystical origins in the North, and that there was indeed an early Saturnian Brother-hood in the Scandinavian region whose history remains quite obscure. It was to these dim roots that the early FS traced its origins. As far as the Scandinavian Brotherhood of Saturn that was supposed to have been working during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is concerned, all that is said is that it was active in"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 3 alchemy and in mathematical and Pythagorean mys-ticism, and that this group was probably based on an even earlier brotherhood in the region. By the end of the eighteenth century those lodges had disappeared and nothing further was heard of them.5 According to FS documents, a Saturnian Brother-hood was revived in Warsaw by the mathematician and mystic Joseph Maria Hoëne-Wronski (1776-1853). This lodge was said to have had outer courts in Krakow, Posen, and Thorn. Ultimately these lodges were de-stroyed by various wars.6 Although the mysterious Hoëne-Wronski may have indeed revived a Saturnian lodge in Poland, the historical record makes it clear that he could not have remained active there, because by the time he was twenty-one he was studying philosophy in Germany.7 Hoëne-Wronski spent most of his life as a Polish expatriate in France, where he is generally held to have been the magical initiator of Alphonse Louis Constant, or as he was better known, Eliphas Levi.8 Hoëne-Wronski was indeed an \"occult master\" involved with the ideas of the Kabbalah, Gnosticism, and the teachings of Jakob Boehme, but he was also a well-respected (if a bit eccentric) mathematician and phi-losopher of his day. He was also dedicated to romantic social reform movements, and was the leader of a group called the \"Antinomian Union.\" Among other things, Hoëne-Wronski held that humanity was to pass through five evolutionary stages, and that his theories would open the way to the fifth and final stage. Perhaps the most important of Hoëne-Wronski's theories was his Principle of the Absolute, which held"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4 / Fire and Ice that knowledge of truth was possible through human reason combined with a secret mathematical formula However, he never seems to have been able to com-municate this formula. Related to this was his Law of Creation, which posited that man could \"create reality\" from the sum of his sense impressions, again com-bined with a mathematical formula. The historical connections between Hoëne-Wronski and the FS are tenuous, but there are several points on which his theories and legacy touch upon the later development of the FS itself. Certainly not the least of these is his role as initiator of Eliphas Levi (between the years 1850 and 1853), who was to be instrumental in the general occult revival of the late nineteenth century. Rebirth Before we can fully understand the founding and subsequent development of the present FS from 1928, a more complete context for the magical revival in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany needs to be outlined. The German-speaking region of central Europe was itself the breeding ground of cer-tain underground streams of occultism, but these were often so deep underground that they did not call much attention to themselves. Some of these currents were taken up by individuals and groups outside the region—especially in England, where we note the Ger-man roots of such organizations as the Golden Dawn"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 5 and the O.T.O.10—and subsequently re-imported into the German-speaking world in a more popularized form The popular occult revival came somewhat later to Germany than it did to France and England, but once it did arrive it struck deeper roots there than it had elsewhere.11 This might be due to the long-standing, subcultural presence of occultism already mentioned. The most important single stream of the early magical revival in Germany and Austria for the his-tory of the FS is that of quasi-Masonry, or Win-kelmauerei, as it is called in German. Various Masonic and quasi-Masonic lodges had been active in Ger-many from at least the eighteenth century.12 Many of them were highly secretive due to their own political activities or due to their fears of political suppression. Here we will only be concerned with those groups known to have done magical work and to have some connection with the eruption of occult activity in cen-tral Europe between the World Wars. One of the most important, and certainly the most diabolically mysterious, of these shadowy lodges was the Free-Masonic Order of the Golden Centurium (FOGC). This order was supposedly founded in 1840 in Munich by some rich German industrialists and well-placed citizens.13 The FOGC was an openly daemonological order that maintained magical con-tact with a tetrad of daemons: Barzabel (planetary demonium of Mars), Astaroth, Belial, and Asmodeus. The service of these entities was to provide the initiates he order with untold personal power, influence, and wealth."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6 / Fire and Ice In essence the FOGC was a cult of human sac-rifice. The centurium in its name is Latin for a group or division of one hundred. Actually, the number of initiates in the lodge was limited to ninety-nine—the one-hundredth member of the order was the demonium itself. Each year a new member was elected and initi-ated, so the extra human initiate had to be sacrificed to the demonium. This whole affair was taken care of on the night of the twenty-third of June, St. John's Day. On that night, the lodge members would con-vene, and if no brother had died in the course of the year, a \"lodge sacrifice\" had to be chosen. This was done by drawing lots. The initiate chosen for this honor would then drink a poison draught in order to complete the sacrificial act. In the case of their refusal, this could be accomplished at a distance by means of the dreaded \"Tepaphone\" (German: Tepaphon)—a machine which, when coupled with the will of a magi-cian, could kill anyone no matter where they were. This machine is also mentioned and described in the FS documents. The sinister FOGG plays a dominant role in the \"magical autobiography\" of Franz Bardon, Frabato,14 wherein dramatic instances of the applica-tion of the Tepaphone are portrayed. Most of the material having to do with the FOGC seems quite legendary and fantastic in tone, but certain features of it are more practically treated in the FS materials. Less mysterious, but still quite obscure, was the early work of Theodor Reuss, who is said to have revived the Order of Illuminati in Bavaria in 1880. There were even two new Orders of Illuminati, one headed by Reuss and another by Leopold Engel in"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saterni / 7 Dresden. By 1899 these were unified, but they only worked together until 1902. After 1902, Reuss seems to have fully shifted his emphasis toward the devel-opment of the O.T.O. Engel continued with his branch of the order until 1924, and then founded a new Illuminati group, the World League of the Illuminati, in 1927. This newer order lasted until 1933, two years after Engel's death.15 After abandoning his efforts to revive Bavarian Illuminism, Theodor Reuss devoted himself to quasi-Masonic work that would culminate in the Ordo Templi Orientis. Reuss edited a journal called the Oriflamme from 1902 to 1923. This was a general outlet for various orders and lodges founded by Reuss, and was dedicated to an eclectic synthesis of Masonic, Rosicrucian, Templar, Gnostic, and certain forms of Indian occultism. Reuss, who was a half-German, half-English, some-time singer, press agent, language teacher and spy, bought the charters of two Masonic organizations, the Ancient Primitive Rite of Memphis (95°) and the Egyptian Rite of Misraim (90°), from the English Mason John Yarker. These two groups were unified by Reuss in 1902 and called the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Misraim. Working with Reuss at that time were the well-known Theosophist Franz Hart-mann and another occult figure named Joshua (also known as Heinrich) Klein. Hartmann had known Karl Kellner, founder of the O.T.O., since at least 1886, when the two collaborated on a form of inhalation therapy for tuberculosis based on Kellner's process of manufacturing cellulose. Klein ran a Utopian colony in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 / Fire and Ice Upper Bavaria called Erdsegen (\"Blessings of the Earth\"), which he established after inheriting a half-million marks. All three men—Reuss, Hartmann and Klein— were at one time or another involved with the pro-gressive underground Utopian colony near Ascona, Switzerland, called Monte Verita.16 In its earliest phase, the O.T.O. was developed by a wealthy Viennese industrialist and high-grade Free-mason, Karl Kellner. It began about 1896, but no docu-mentation of it exists before it was mentioned in the Historische Ausgabe der Oriflamme (1904).17 It was sometime between 1896 and 1904 that Reuss, Hart-mann, and Klein began to collaborate with Kellner in their collective quasi-Masonic endeavors. Kellner had apparently already developed a system of sexual occultism based on what Indian Tantrism he was able to learn and on the teachings of the American sexual mystic Paschal Beverly Randolph, as transmitted through a French branch of Randolph's organization. Traditionally, Kellner is supposed to have travelled in the East, where he learned sexo-yogic secrets from three adepts, two of them Hindu and one Muslim.18 Shortly after the collaboration among Kellner, Reuss, Hartmann and Klein began, Kellner died (1905), and Reuss became the Outer Head of the O.T.O. Under Reuss the O.T.O. flourished as it never had before. In 1912, Reuss openly published the true nature of the work of the O.T.O. in the Oriflamme: \"Our Order possesses the KEY which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets, namely the teaching of sexual magic, and this teaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of Freemasonry and all systems of religion.\""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 9 Also in that year, Reuss met with the English magician Aleister Crowley, whom Reuss supposedly accused of revealing the Order's secrets of sexual magic. Crowley really knew nothing about the tech-niques Reuss was alluding to, but the works of Crowley are so full of sexual references that it cer-tainly seems that he did. A sort of mutual conversion took place, in which Reuss convinced Crowley of the power of the O.T.O. sex-magical technology and Crowley converted Reuss to the Aeonic Law of The¬ lema. In 1922, Reuss resigned his position in the O.T.O. due to poor health, nominating Crowley as his successor. Reuss died the next year. The Beast was, however, not immediately accepted as the new Outer Head of the Order (OHO). The translation of Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law) in German in 1925 was a watershed in that some dissidents were won over, while others were totally repulsed by the con-tents of the book. In time, the rituals and ideology of the old O.T.O. were \"Thelemized\" by Crowley's in-fluence, and finally Baphomet (Crowley's O.T.O. nickname) was firmly established as the international Outer Head of the Order. Besides the O.T.O. there was another group working in Germany in 1925 that had attracted Crowley's attention—the Pansophical Lodge, or Pan-sophia. This group was headed by Henrich Tränker (Br. Recnartus), and was founded originally as a loosely organized study group in Berlin shortly after the First World War. However, it soon became formalized as the \"Grand Pansophical Lodge of Germany, Orient-Berlin.\" The Grand Master of this Lodge was Br. Rec-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"10 / Fire and Ice nartus, its Master of the Chair was Master Pacitus (Albin Grau), and its Secretary was Gregor A. Gregorius (Eugen Grosche). Another important initiate of this lodge was Karl Germer (Br. Saturnus), who was also the paid personal secretary of Heinrich Tränker. Tränker was the head of a whole eclectic, occult, \"pansophi¬ cal\" movement made up of several orders, lodges, and societies. Some of his authority was derived from Theodor Reuss, at least according to Aleister Crowley's own account.19 It was from contact between this group and Crowley that the Fraternitas Saturni under the Grand Mastery of Gregor A. Gregorius came to be founded in 1928. These affairs will be addressed later. Finally, with regard to the quasi-Masonic back-ground of the FS, these are the supposed German origins of Die Goldene Dämmerung—the Golden Dawn. This magical order was founded in England in 1888. Its own tradition holds that its authority was derived from a German order of the same name. Ellic Howe has carefully thrown a good deal of doubt on the whole tradition of the German origin of the organiza-tion in his Magicians of the Golden Dawn.20 He con-tends that W. W. Wescott essentially forged the documents relevant to this tradition. Howe's arguments make a great amount of sense. An interesting question that remains is why Wescott would have chosen Ger-many as a source for his imaginary lodge. On the sur-face the explanation that Germany was suitably remote, yet plausible—at least more plausible than the subterranean Himalayas—seems reasonable.

One historical factor that may have led to this was the traditional presence of \"Secret Chiefs\" (Superiores Incogniti) in the German Masonic Order of the \"Strict Obser-vance,\" active since the middle of the eighteenth cen-tury. Ellic Howe speculates that Wescott did not have the Secret Chiefs in mind so much as he did the hidden mahatmas of Blavatsky's Theosophical Society.21 This may well have been, but there were sufficiently deep and long-term, network-like connections between the German and English Masonic and quasi-Masonic groups to warrant the idea that these Secret Chiefs were thought to be akin to those of the Masonic Strikte Observanz. As a feature of organization and doctrine this concept is inexactly reflected in the FS as the GOTOS entity—the guiding force of the order embodied in the 33°, which is actually the superhuman Saturnian Demiurge. Whatever the origin of the idea of Secret Chiefs, it cannot be denied that the founding and development of the Theosophical Society had a transformative effect on the history of occult movements in Western society. The Theosophical Society was founded in New York in 1875, and its influence was felt throughout the occult subculture from that time on,22 mainly in the popularization of occult ideas of the East and West and in the eclectic synthesis of these ideas into a more or less coherent whole. Theosophy was introduced into the German-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"12 / Fire and Ice speaking world in the late 1870s by the Viennese Friedrich Eckstein. By 1884 it had been officially established in Germany. At about that time, a high official in the Theosophical Society in Adyar, India, Dr. Franz Hartmann, made a trip to Germany, where he met Karl Kellner and became involved with him in occult work of the kind mentioned above. Here there is a definite and early connection between a leading Theosophist and the future Outer Head of the O.T.O. Later, of course, Hartmann would be one of the lead-ing figures of the German O.T.O. along with Klein and Reuss. Another Theosophist, Rudolf Steiner, also had O.T.O. connections. Theodor Reuss gave Steiner a charter to found an O.T.O. lodge in Berlin around 1906, while Steiner was General Secretary of the Theosophical Society in Germany. In all of this there is evidence that the world of quasi-Masonry in Germany was open to Theosophical ideas, and that individual Theosophists were also seeking deeper, practical magical applications of occult teachings in the ranks of the quasi-Masonic orders. A further important contextual element for the development of the Fraternitas Saturni was the Ario-sophical movement. Again there are vital intercon-nections with the Theosophical and quasi-Masonic worlds. The most important single figure in the general Ariosophical movement was Guido von List (1848-1919). From early in his career he was in the Theo-sophical milieu in matters völkisch and occult. In the 1890s, he was involved with a Viennese literary society which included Rudolf Steiner and Jörg Lanz von"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 13 Liebenfels (Adolf Joseph).23 List was the son of a wealthy Viennese tradesman, but his talents and desires ran more to the literary and the occult. He eventually succeeded in winning a place for himself as a poet, novelist, and playwright within the largely establishment völkisch circles of Austria. Beginning in 1902, however, List gave full vent to his mystical inclinations, and embarked on the path of an occult master. In that year he underwent an operation for cataracts, after which his eyes were bandaged for eleven months. In this enforced state of blindness and darkness List was enlightened to the runic mysteries. (The runes are a system of written symbols used by the ancient Germanic peoples as a sacred or magical script.24) Two years later, List wrote his first occult study: Das Geheimnis derRunen.25 The Ariosophical/ runic occultism of the FS is ultimately derived from this basic text, List's subsequent studies, and the magical work of those inspired by those studies, e.g. Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Rum-mer. In the FS, Frater Eratus (Karl Spiesberger) was one of the leading exponents of rune magic.26 The Guido von List Gesellschaft (society) was founded in 1905 to support the master and his work in occult Germanicism. Among the members of this society were Dr. Franz Hartmann and Lanz von Liebenfels. Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, an ex-Cistercian monk, also became involved in the generally theosophical and völkisch milieu after 1900. In 1907 Lanz revived the order of the Templars—in the form of the Ordo Novi Templi (ONT)—the Order of the New Templars."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 / Fire and Ice This organization shared the use of Templar sym-bolism with the O.T.O. Both orders also revolved around sexual mysteries, but the kind of sexual mys-ticism practiced by the ONT and the O.T.O. were very different indeed. Lanz preached a doctrine of racial enlightenment through the practice of strict eugenics, through which the Grail of pure Aryan blood would be restored. In addition to the previously stated Ariosophical leanings within the FS, the other significant shared elements between Ariosophy and the FS seem to have been their doctrines of a coming age of higher spiritual evolution, an interest in Templarism, and the belief in hidden masters. All but the interest in runes are also shared with Theosophy and quasi-Masonry. In addition to quasi-Masonry, Theosophy, and Ariosophy, another branch of esoterica that burst on the scene in early twentieth-century Germany was astrology. Until sometime after 1914, astrology was just one more of the many arcane sciences practiced within the mysto-magical cultural milieu of quasi-Masonry, Theosophy, and Ariosophy. By the 1920s, however, astrology had become more popular in Ger-many than any of these other branches of occultism. The interest of the FS in astrology extends to the most esoteric levels of the subject in its doctrines concern-ing the Aquarian/Saturno-Uranian Age. But the attrac-tion of widespread interest in a lodge with obvious astrological implications is clearly based on the pop-ularization of astrology in the 1920s.27 It was in the context of these major streams of occultism that the Pansophical Lodge of Master Recnar-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 15 tus existed, and from which the Fraternitas Saturni was to emerge. As mentioned before, Pansophia must be character-ized as a movement overseen by Heinrich Tränker— Master Recnartus. Tränker, like Theodor Reuss, engi-neered a number of occult groups. And as we have mentioned before, Tränker is even supposed to have derived his Masonic authority from Reuss. The main period of activity for Master Recnartus was just after the First World War. At first, the \"Pansophical Society\" was a study group founded just after the war in Berlin. Their areas of interest included Gnosticism, the ancient mysteries of Greece, Egypt, and Babylon, as well as problems of philosophy, religious history, metaphysics, depth-psychology, \"cosmosophy,\" and the Kabbalah. In the early 1920s, Tränker founded a Collegium Pan¬ sophicum. This organization, which may have existed only on paper, gave Tränker's work a more Masonic, orderly cast, and acted as a background for the publi-cation of some of Tränker's occult works. In 1921 all the Pansophical streams governed by Tränker were brought together in the Grand Pansophical Lodge (of the Light-Seeking Brethren) of the Orient-Berlin. Besides Tränker, one of the leading members of this lodge was Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus), who was Tränker's secretary and who later became the Grand Treasurer General of Crowley's O.T.O., and eventually Outer Head of the Order upon Crowley's death in 1947. Another leading figure was Albin Grau (Master Pacitus), who was also a set designer for the UFA studios in Berlin, where he designed the sets for such films as Nosferatu (1922) and Shadows"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16 / Fire and Ice (1923). (Indeed, there seems to have been a good deal of occult involvement among the German film-makers of the pre-1933 era; some of the mysteries of this milieu have yet to be unraveled.) Finally, there was Eugen Grosche, who was initiated by Tränker and given the lodge name Gergor A. Gregorius. It was Gregorius who was the actual founder of the Pan-sophical Lodge and who was its general secretary. Gregorius ran an occult bookshop in Berlin at the time. In the summer of 1925, the most important event leading to the emergence of the FS took place. Without apparently knowing very much about his teachings, Master Recnartus invited Aleister Crowley to his house in Weida in Thuringia, Germany. The purpose of this meeting was to confer the leadership of the groups controlled by Tränker onto Crowley. Or so it seemed. After Theodor Reuss died in 1923, the interna-tional leadership of the O.T.O. passed to Crowley in England. Crowley had been an initiate of the Golden Dawn from 1898 to 1900. In April 1904, while in Cairo, Egypt, Crowley received a book—called the Liber AL vel Legis—which was transmitted to him by a praeterhuman entity calling itself Aiwass. This text is known more simply as the Book of the Law. With the reception of this book Crowley began to function as a Magus, and proclaimed a new Aeon with a new lema was summed up in the motto: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,\" to which the oblig-atory response became: \"Love is the law, love under will.\" All this constituted the Law of Thelema, (Thelema: True Will). The Law of The-Word:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 17 which one either accepted or rejected. During the ensu-ing decade, Crowley worked on trying to develop his or Silver Star. This order was constructed in 1907, and announced for the first time in the first issue of The Equinox (March 1909). However, this instru-ment proved unsatisfactory to Crowley's plans for dissemination of his new Aeonic Law. When Crowley met Theodor Reuss in London in 1912, the Great Beast found a more suitable institu-tion in the O.T.O. Reuss made Crowley the head of the order in Britain at that time. Crowley took the magical name \"Baphomet\" for his elevation to the X°—the highest title the O.T.O. had to bestow. The secret of the O.T.O. is, as we know, the practice of sexual magic and mysticism. Crowley had up until this time par-tially understood such things, but with the reception of the O.T.O. teachings on this subject he began to delve into the practice almost exclusively. From 1912 until 1922, when Reuss suffered a stroke and retired from active participation in the order, there was a sense of collaboration between Baphomet and Merlin (Reuss). Crowley received the innermost magical sec-rets of the order, and Reuss had Crowley revise the rituals of the O.T.O. in a form which accorded with the Law of Thelema. Reuss apparently named Crowley to succeed him as O.H.O., but there was substantial resistance to this among members of the German O.T.O. It must be said that Baphomet rapidly spread both the O.T.O. and his Word, Thelema, in the English-speaking world through his own contacts and by means of The Equinox, in. which he began to print own magical order—the Argenteum Astrum"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 / Fire and Ice O.T.O.-related material after 1912. After Merlin's death in 1923, things moved inevitably to a crisis point. The German branch of the O.T.O. had apparent-ly fallen into the control of Heinrich Tränker after the death of Reuss. This was perhaps due to the fact that Crowley's teachings were not universally acclaimed in Germany. The lack of acceptance stemmed both from Crowley's doctrine of the New Aeon—which had not yet appeared in German—and from Crowley's veiled references in his writings to the secret of the IX°—sexual magic. The German branch had generally guarded this secret closely, and only revealed it in part at the VIII0, where the secrets of solitary sex-magic were taught. Without being specific, Crowley had revealed too much to persons unprepared for such mysteries. When the overall picture in Germany at this time is assessed, it is clear that there was a split be-tween those enthusiastic about Crowley's teachings and those highly suspicious of them. It was into this set of circumstances that Crowley moved in that fateful summer of 1925. He, along with his entourage of Leah Hirsig, Dorothy Olsen, and Norman Mudd, left from Paris to go to the home of Heinrich Tränker in Weida. Karl Germer had paid for their trip to Germany. Crowley had sent a copy of the Book of the Law ahead to Weida, where it was promptly translated into German. The \"Weida Conference,\" as it came to be known, was attended by Crowley's entourage, Heinrich Tränker (Grand Master of the German Rosicrucians and Pansophists), his wife Helene, Albin Grau (Master of the Chair of the Pansophical"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 19 Lodge), Eugen Grosche (Secretary of the Pansophical Lodge), Karl Germer, Martha Küntzel, and a few other occult leaders. The real purpose of this conference was the acceptance or rejection of the Law of Thelema, and the exploration of the possibility of uniting several occult factions under the leadership of a New World Teacher—the Great Wild Beast 666. Accounts of this conference vary in detail, scope, and conclusion;28 certainly the most amusing account is that written by A.C. himself. None can be com-pletely trusted, as each writer has some sort of ax to grind. But subsequent historical facts allow us to reconstruct the actual outcome of this occult conclave. To begin with, the translation of the Book of the Law caused quite a stir. Both Albin Grau (Pacitus) and Tränker (Recnartus) were ill-disposed toward its anti-christian stance. Recnartus is supposed to have softened his criticism and come to some new under-standing of the book's contents. But Pacitus remained opposed, if tacitly. On the other hand, as subsequent events were to show, Gregorius was favorably im-pressed with the Beast and his Word. The conference ended with an obviously uneasy communique entitled \"The Testament of a Seeker.\" Its text read: \"The Teacher of the World, whose appearance was predicted for this year, and who has been awaited by all true seekers— and especially by those of the Theosophical Society—has appeared at this exact time in the person of the Master To Mega Therion (i.e., Aleister Crowley). We the undersigned have seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears and we know, certainly and without lies, that he is in truth the transmitter of the Word after which the soul of hu-manity thirsts.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 / Fire and Ice Events following the so-called Weida Conference show just how uneasy this agreement was on all sides. Tränker and Grau renounced the communique almost immediately following the event, and eventually even Mudd (in 1927) and Leah Hirsig (in 1928) withdrew their support. During the months and years following the meet-ing at Weida, Gregor A. Gregorius must have been studying and assimilating Crowley's teachings, as well as those of the Pansophists, Rosicrucians, and others in his environs. On Maundy Thursday 1926, the Pan¬ sophical Lodge was ritually closed and dissolved. On the following May 8, five Fratres founded the Frater¬ nitas Saturni. This was to be a magical order which accepted the Law of Thelema, but which was to be totally independent of any other magical order. A few days later Gregorius wrote to the Beast, informing him of the aims of this revived Saturnian Lodge. The letter and the document outlining these early aims are printed here as Appendices F and G. As far as the Rosicrucian-Pansophical Lodge fac-tion and its leaders, Tränker and Grau, were con-cerned, there seems to have been a falling out over, among other things, the treatment of the Master Therion by Recnartus. It was rumored that Tränker had a hand in having Crowley expelled from Ger-many.29 This was apparently one of the critical events which led to the final dissolution of the Pansophical Lodge in 1926. Although it is possible that Tränker and Grau continued their occult work, nothing more is heard of them in this capacity. A full one-third of the members of the Pansophical Lodge became the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 21 core of initiates of the FS. Between May of 1926 and Easter Saturday 1928, the FS was further consolidated and refined into a more cohesive structure. It is this day in 1928 which actually serves as the date of the official magical in-ception of the FS. After this there followed a period of intensive activity for the newly (re-) founded FS, especially in the environs of Berlin, where Gregorius had his book-shop. Gregorius began publishing FS material, some of which was available to the public, some of which was only for distribution within the Lodge. Five issues of the journal Saturn-Gnosis were printed. In this jour-nal, articles on magical subjects by Gregorius and other writers within and without the FS, including Masters Pacitus and Therion, appeared. (Neither of these men had any official connection with the FS.) There was also a series often Magische Briefe (Magical Papers) published from 1926 to 1927 or 1928. These were for the most part supposed to be translated from English, and to have been written by To Mega Therion. However, it seems more likely that they were actually written by Gregorius or by other FS initiates, as they bear little resemblance to Crowley's typical work. Finally, in this period Gregorius produced a series of fourteen printed Lectures of the Lodge-School, as well as other interna for initiatory instruction. Many of these works were published by the lodge's own house, INVEHA. The relationship between Aleister Crowley and and the FS was an ambivalent one. Gregorius had"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"22 / Fire and Ice made it quite plain that although he accepted the Law of Thelema, he would accept no official relationship with Crowley or his organizations. On the whole it seems that Gregorius claimed a closer link with Crowley and his work than actually existed. FS materials, doc-trines, and rituals, as can be seen in this book, are only laced with Crowleyanity—their shape and substance remain something other than what the Beast promul-gated. There was some contact between Crowley and Gregorius between the years 1928 and 1933, and some opportunities for meetings. Crowley was in Germany in 1929, when he married Maria Theresa Ferrari de Miramar, and on different occasions in 1930 he was in Berlin during some rather frantic affairs.30 Most of Crowley's influence on Gregorius seems to have come through his published writings, many of which were translated into German by initiates of the FS. Gregorius was later to publish translations of magical works taken from Magick in Theory and Practice (1929). The actual accomplishment of Gregorius and the FS was a more or less cohesive synthesis of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Luciferianism, astrological mythology, Crowleyanity (or Thelemism), sex-magical practices of the old O.T.O., various Indian yogic systems, and medieval and modern doctrines of alchemy and ritual magic."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 23 Interregnum The great storm-cloud broke over the Fraternitas Saturni and all other Masonic and quasi-Masonic lodges in Germany on January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler, Führer of the NSDAP, took the oath as chancellor of Germany. By the next month emergency powers had been invoked and many groups thought to be of a sub-versive nature, from Communists to Masons, were suppressed. This began a process in which secret societies and occult orders of all kinds began to be sys-tematically suppressed. Most sources on the history of the FS state that the lodge was closed and banned in 1933.31 Certainly Gregorius' bookstore and the pub-lishing house would have been closed down by 1934. In 1935 another wave of \"voluntary\" dissolutions of secret societies followed. Finally, in a declaration of Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler in 1937, all occult and quasi-Masonic organizations, even the völkisch ones that had generally and originally been support-ive of National Socialist aims, were banned. These völkisch groups included those founded by Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. Early in this cycle of bannings Gregorius is said to have emigrated first to Switzerland and then to Cannero, Italy. There he remained until October of 1943, when he was arrested and extradited back to Germany through pressure from the Nazi government. He was released on his own recognizance after only one year, and apparently allowed to continue his occult studies after his release. After the war ended in 1945, Gregorius set about refounding the FS. There is more than one odd aspect"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"24 / Fire and Ice to these events of l933 to l945. We know very little about what actually happened to Gregorius in these years. The fact that someone extradited from a foreign country by the Nazis would then just simply be let go after a year's detention—and then allowed to con-tinue his suspect activities within Germany—is almost unbelievable. Renewal Supposedly Gregorius was able to maintain con-tact with many of the Fratres of the FS while he was in Switzerland and Italy. After the war, he called the Brothers together to reorganize the order; but as he found himself at that time in Riesa in the Soviet occupation zone, it was impossible to carry out the work of the Order. It was not until 1950 that Gregorius went to the Western zone of occupation and from there to West Berlin. His five-year sojourn in the east is also rather odd. In any event, in 1950 the FS again became active and the first issues of the Blätter fur angewandte okkulte Lebenskunst (\"Papers toward the Applied Occult Art of Life\") began to appear. About twelve issues of these per year continued to be published until 1962. On March 18, 1957 the FS was declared the Grand Lodge of the Fraternitas Saturni at Berlin. At that time there were outer courts in many German cities. Of course, Gregorius was named its Grand"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"A History of the Fraternitas Saturni / 25 Master. The period from 1957 to the date of Gregorius' death in 1964 was one of intensive activity and growth for the order, but the time between 1960 and 1964 was apparently beset with various internal problems generally characterized as a power struggle between Gregorius and Grand Chancellor Amenophis.32 Upon the death of the GM Gregor A. Gregorius in January of 1964, these internal conflicts became more acute. Discords and Harmonies Between the time of Gregorius' death and 1969 there were numerous conflicts within the FS. The \"First Council of the Grand Lodge\" met at the Easter Festival Lodge meeting of 1964 and elected Magistra Roxane, who had been the Lodge Secretary and a close personal associate of Gregorius, as the next GM. Several long-time initiates left the order at that time. Within a year Roxane was dead. In 1966 a triumvirate was elected under the leadership of Magistri Giovanni, the Lodge Secretary. Frater Daniel 12° was subsequently elected to the Grand Mastery. The fact that a Frater of such a relatively low degree was elected to the Grand Mastery could have been taken as an ill omen. Daniel set about reorganizing the Brotherhood. One of his innovations was the installation of an \"inner circle\" of initiates within the FS itself. This was the Alter und Mystischer Orden der Saturnbruder-schaft—AMOS-OMS (Old and Mystical Order of the Brotherhood of Saturn). Only nine initiates could"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"26 / Fire and Ice belong to the AMOS. These actions led to even more dissension. In 1969, yet another GM was elected. This time the Brother, Br. Jananda 8°, was of an even lower grade. Jananda had entered the order only in 1964, so the lineage of Gregorius had already been virtually broken with this election. This precipitated a crisis that indirectly caused the internal documents of the FS to be published. Daniel continued with a schis-matic FS, while another schismatic group calling itself the \"Theosophical Order Fraternitas Saturni\" under GM Immanuel was formed in Frankfurt. The main body of the FS elected a new GM known as Andrzey. Therefore, there were at least three groups working under the FS banner in 1969. Apparently it was the former GM Daniel who gave or sold a mass of internal documents in 1969 to Prof. Dr. Adolf Hemberger, who then published many of them in his 1971 study of the organization. The FS had, up until that time, been a truly secret lodge which preserved those rituals and practices they wanted to keep hidden from outsiders. Now the whole interna, or at least the vast majority of them, had been exposed. This led to the necessary reorganization of the system. On Easter Saturday of that same year, the various factions of the FS reunified. The material used in this book comes from the period before 1969 and therefore does not reflect the rituals and doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni as it is working in the world today."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Doctrines of the Brotherhood of Saturn LUX E TENEBRIS LUCET ET LUCEAT Doctrines and teachings concealed within the magical lodge Fraternitas Saturni are wrapped in the dark cloak of the Demiurge Saturnus, and are truly revealed only to those elect of Saturn who are able to comprehend and understand the Saturn-Gnosis.

But it is also enlightened by the \"higher octave\" of Saturn—Lucifer—and by the dark light of Saturnian yoga, or sexual mysticism and cosmosophy. The teachings of the FS are highly eclectic. This is understandable given the lodge's \"pansophical\" origins. \"Pansophical\" here means \"wisdom that encompasses all other forms of wisdom.\" In the early part of the twentieth century there were several \"-sophies,\" all based on analogy with Blavatsky's Theo-sophy.

The original pansophy of Heinrich Tränker was an attempt to synthesize all forms of occult teachings then in practice. This, however, proved a difficult task, as there seemed to be no unifying element or central focus for the maelstorm of occult lore swirling around in the pansophical movement. It was the Fraternitas Saturni and Gregor A. Gregorius, directly or indirectly through the accept-ance of the Aeonic Law of Thelema, which provided the necessary elements of cohesion to the pansophical approach in Germany. In this chapter we will concen-trate on those things which make the FS teachings unique and give them definite shape. Underlying all of this is the usual post-Theosophical mixture of Eastern and Western doctrines and practices to be found in quasi-Masonic orders of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, e.g. the Golden Dawn and its derivatives. The elements that make the FS unique are its focus on the Saturn archetype, the Saturnian mythos of a new aeon based on an astrological process, and an unabashed Luciferianism. Further aspects which, although not unique to the Brotherhood, added to the lodge's working focus are: the doctrines and practices of sexual magic (principally taken over from the O.T.O.), and the Law of Thelema, which had been for-mally accepted from the Master Therion (Aleister Crowley) at the inception of the FS. From the standpoint of existing magical and mys-tical traditions, the FS is a mixture of Eastern and Western streams. A survey of the contents of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"30 / Fire and Ice issues of Saturn-Gnosis, the Papers toward the Applied Art of Living (1948-1950), and the Papers toward the Applied Occult Art of Living (1950-1958) shows how this is so. From Eastern (really Indian) ideologies come the themes of awakening of the chakra system in the magician,1 the laws of reincarnation and karma, and the practice of tantric sexual mysticism. From various branches of the Western (for want of a better term) tradition come the doctrines of ritual magic (taken mainly from the medieval and Renaissance grimoires), astrology, Rosicrucianism, Gnosticism and, of course, the overriding Masonic form of the lodge's organization and ritual. The documents indicate that the Eastern influence became stronger after the re-organization of the lodge after the Second World War. It is also interesting to note that in comparison to similar eclectic lodges, the FS laid relatively little emphasis on the Tarot and the Kabbalah. Within the FS teachings, special emphasis is placed on crystal and mirror magic,2 pendulum magic,3 and \"daimonic magic.\"4 Saturn-Gnosis The gnosis of the FS is a complex set of magical doctrines. These include a special path of initiation as well as a complete astral or planetary cosmosophy and a Luciferian element. In many regards the Saturn-Gnosis is in accordance with what is known of the Ophite and Barbelo Gnostic sects of antiquity.5 Gnosis"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 31 is a form of knowledge concerning the cosmos to which the individual feels called, or \"elected,\" and which is based not on the belief in certain dogmas but rather on deep personal experience. The teachings, practices and rituals of the FS are intended to provide just such an initiatory experience. Although in ancient times Gnosticism existed in a myriad of often mutually incompatible sects, there were certain doctrines common to most of them. First, they held that there existed a godhead beyond all categories as well as a three-fold god subsisting in the fullness of being (pleroma), or light. This divine realm of fullness of being transcends the place in the world where matter exists; these two realms are separated by a great barrier (horos). How these realms became separate is a matter of diverse speculation, however, what is certain among the Gnostics is that our world was not created by the god of light, but rather by an entity that resulted from a deficiency in the pleroma. This deficiency came about either through progressive degeneration as the outflow of being got further and further from its source, or through a conscious with-drawal of divine will (thelema) from the outer reaches. By whatever process, lesser independent entities arose in the graduated levels (called aeons) of the new cos-mos. These entities were called archons. One of these archons is the entity—or demiurge—that created our world of matter. This entity is identified by some Gnostics with Jehova (YHVH), the god of the Old Testa-ment. Finally, it was held that man, as a mixed entity consisting of elements with origins in both the world of light (of God) and the world of darkness (of the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"32 / Fire and Ice demiurge), could only be redeemed by knowledge (gnosis). This knowledge was a direct experience of being, not something acquired by learning or even by conclusions reached by logical methods. The demiurge Jehovah demanded faith (pistis); the \"Good God\" could only be reached through gnosis.6 The Saturnian Archetype From the perspective of FS teachings, the essences of the planets are complex entities. The central focus of the Brotherhood is the Saturnian complex, which we will refer to here as an \"archetype.\" From an aeonic perspective, the planetary complex surrounding Uranus is also important in FS teachings. A review of any modern astrological text will show what the common views of Saturnian characteris-tics are: practical, cautious, constructive, responsible, patient, ambitious, thrifty, reliable and self-disciplined. Negative characteristics might include: mean, narrow-minded, severe, aloof, dogmatic, heartless, and cruel. Some of the older characteristics of Saturn were taken over by Uranus. Again, a review of standard texts will show certain Uranian characteristics: humanitarian, friendly, kind, independent, original, inventive, strong-willed, versatile, loathing restriction. Negative char-acteristics might be: eccentric, perverse, rebellious.7 A synthesis of all these characteristics will basic-ally give the entire picture of the Saturno-Uranian complex as it is projected in the ideology of the FS."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 33 In the Saturn-Gnosis the planet and archetype of Saturnus is the focal point for the manifestation of the Demiurge. This Demiurge is identified with Lucifer— the Bearer of Light—as the higher octave of Saturn. In this capacity it is the \"Guardian of the Threshold\" to higher initiation and being.8 According to secret FS teachings, Saturnus is the Great Judge that manifests justice; he also brings reason and intelligence, and governs all standards of weights, measurements, and number. He is the Lord of the Seven Dwellings (= planetary genii of the outer realm), and governor of the revealed world and lord over life and death, and over the light and darkness. Saturnus is seen as the breaker of cosmic order and unity—thus he instituted death, causing regeneration and change to come into being. One of the ways in which he broke the cosmic order was in the revelation of divine secrets to mankind.9 For this he was punished. Thus in many ways Saturnus is identical with Pro-metheus of Greek tradition, and is certainly to be identified as well with the Serpent of Paradise. This Demiurge Saturnus is identified with the number 666. He is the Beast 666, manifest in the Man (or Men) 666, and in the Living Center of the Sun—Sorath 666.10 Further Luciferian aspects of the Demiurge Sa-turnus will be explored below when we discuss the specifically Luciferian/Satanic11 facets of the Saturn-Gnosis. What is important to realize at this juncture is that Saturn is seen not in an exoteric sense—relevant primarily to the non-elect of Saturn—but rather in an esoteric sense relevant to his chosen ones. Here Saturn"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34 / Fire and Ice is seen as the tester and judge, and ultimately as the initiator into higher knowledge and power. This capac-ity is further amplified by the underlying Uranian influence. Besides these general teachings on the nature of the Demiurge Saturnus, the FS has a special doctrine, particular to it, concerning an entity attached to the planet Saturn and active on the Earth, called the GOTOS. This is the specific egregore or daimonion of the Brotherhood, of which the Grand Master 33° is the personal representative. The GOTOS functions in a way similar to the way the Secret Chiefs worked in the Golden Dawn system. The belief of this system of lodges having hidden, praeterhuman intelligences at their esoteric heads is commonly held in the FS. Mem-bers would, for example, say that Baphomet was the lodge daimonion of the Knights Templar. The name GOTOS is actually a formula made up of the initial letters in the official name of the 33°: Gradus Ordinis Templi Orientis Saturni.12 The daimo-nion GOTOS is understood as a preexisting entity, but it is also used as the egregore of the lodge. An egregore is a sort of \"group spirit\" or thought-form magically created by a community of people from its collective ideals. The egregore can be seen as a collective hyp-notic suggestion which can be experienced directly, if subjectively, by the participants in rituals wherein the egregore is invoked. This tends to take on objec-tive reality as the experience of the egregore becomes an experience that is shared within lodges.13 GOTOS guides the initiate toward divinity. It has a dark and light aspect and stands beyond all notions"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 35 of good and evil. This is related to the +/-Absolutum. The initiate who has been informed by the GOTOS will combine the Apollonian and Dionysian within him—he will put the Apollonian in the center of his world-view, but will joyously observe the sacramen-tal daemonic liturgy of life and death. The magical synthesis of this duality is thought to make it easy for the initiate to \"change raiments\" (i.e., to die), as he passes from one plane of being to another.14 Jananda, writing as Aythos, defines the GOTOS in the following terms: \"The GOTOS, as a magnetic accumulator in the Saturn-sphere, stores ... projected magical powers in the causal sphere through the Chain of Brotherhood.\"15 Here it is clear that the egregore is intended to work in a particular magical way. It is a kind of \"battery\" which can be charged with the psychic energy of the lodge. This \"battery\" is given a particular form, which acts as an access-key to its power. When members of the lodge have need of the accumulated and stored magical energy, they can \"tap into\" it if they have the proper ritual keys. In the ritual practice of the FS, the GOTOS is especially charged during the Easter Lodge when, through the formation of the magical Chain of Brotherhood, energy is circulated to the GOTOS. In trance states certain initiates of the FS could actually gain \"astral\" visions of the humanoid appearance of the GOTOS. This image was at some point cast in a sculpture by Sorella Gabriele and set up in the Lodge Temple in Berlin. At one time all members of the FS were to have one of these busts of the \"Master Gothos\" in their private sanctuaries (see page 72)."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36 / Fire and Ice Through the experience of the GOTOS the Satur¬ nian Brother or Sister is able to feel directly the qualities of personality that he or she is expected to develop as an initiate of the FS: compassionless love, willpower, resolution, severity (with him- or herself and others). These are developed in order to create the conditions for higher spiritual development through mastery of one's own self and the environment. In other words these are the characteristics of the Saturnian magician. Gregorius himself, in a poem published in Saturn-Gnosis 1 (1928), described the GOTOS as a leader on the path into the solitude of Saturnian-Uranian knowledge (a knowledge into which each must go alone). He portrays the \"love\" of Saturn as \"severity,\" but declares that whoever can withstand the tests will ultimately be greeted as a friend and brother.16 Aim of the FS—The Lodge Concept The Brotherhood of Saturn characterizes itself as a \"just, enlightened, perfect, secret, magical, ritual lodge.\" Each of these terms further defines and clari-fies the nature of the FS.17 It is \"just\" or \"righteous\" in that all initiates are ethically trained in order to become balanced, pro-ductive and most importantly conscious members of the lodge and of society as a whole. In Masonic terms, the new initiate is compared to a rough-hewn stone which is to be finished by the mason.

True to Gnostic doctrine, the FS holds that this understanding must come from outside the limitations of normal deductive or inductive logic. Magical work is made up of experience and only the elect may ever truly under-stand it. The FS is a \"secret\" lodge in that the public iden-tities of the members are supposed to be unknown to the other members. Each new initiate is given a lodge-name which he or she is to be known by in lodge-related affairs. During the ritual lodge work which takes place when a new initiate is received, his public name along with his lodge name are burned together in the brazier to bind them together \"astrally.\" \"Ritualistic\" means that the lodge celebrates cer-tain ritual ceremonies at appointed times as an integral part of its overall work. The most sacred night is that of \"Good Saturday\"—when in the lore of the Christians it is said that Christ was in the Underworld preaching to the \"good pagans.\" The word \"magical\" here denotes the idea that the lodge works with invocations and evocations of entities from beyond the mundane realm. It is a \"Brotherhood\" in that the bonds made within it are intended to continue beyond death on the \"mental plane.\" In the concept of Brotherhood both men and women are included. Quite often Brothers and Sisters place three points This is an exhortation \"to work in the triplicity: harmony-justice-fraternity.\"18 This three-fold motto either before or before and after their lodge names."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"38 / Fire and Ice can also be taken as an indication of the value system within the lodge. Among the highest aims of the FS is the spiritual perfection of its initiates. But this is not really seen as an end in itself, but rather as a means to the elevation of the consciousness of the lodge as a whole, which in turn leads to a sympathetic raising of consciousness in the world outside the lodge. An esoteric aim of the lodge especially pursued by the High Grade Masters (30°—33°) is the binding of the so-called \"outer lodge,\" i.e. the FS as it is known in the world, to the \"inner lodge\" which exists on the \"mental plane.\" It is from this inner lodge that the High Grade initiates are to receive instructions for magical work to be dis-seminated within the order. Through this interaction, the two lodges, the inner and outer, begin to reach higher and higher levels of harmony. Additionally, the FS, as a Thelemic order, is concerned with activating the Law of Thelema on this planet. In the higher grades it is taught that the higher sense of the Law of Thelema involves the binding of humanity closer to the Saturnian influence.19 The Way of Saturn The path of Saturnian initiation is one often wrapped in darkness in which the initiate finds the light. It is one of solitude (as the FS has come to recog-nize the existential problem of modern humanity), which it has incorporated into its program. As an"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 39 order the FS provides a definite initiatory path and curriculum which is particular unto itself. Despite the recognition of the initiate's lonely path, the FS tries to provide a magical environment in which the individual can most clearly find his or her way to the Guardian of the Threshold—and beyond. The cultivation of solitude is a primary task of the Saturnian brother or sister. As the initiate has chosen a pathway to higher knowledge through the Saturnian sphere, he has naturally isolated himself from the mass of humanity. By so doing he has also liberated himself from a vast number of the influences of the masses, influences that are detrimental to his initiatory progress. The initiate's need for this spirit-ually undifferentiated humanity becomes less and less as his progress accelerates. So despite his solitude (and more to the point, because of it) he is happy as a self-contained individual. Because he stands more and more outside the standards of common human measurements and evaluations, the Saturnian brother has progressively less spiritual need of common human society. The solitude is a joyous one, mainly because the initiate is always conscious of, and focused on, his initiatory aims.20 This cultivation of magical and initiatory solitude, when applied to the FS as a body, manifests as an elitist philosophy. As a link in the self-contained Chain of Brotherhood, the initiate is not only able to over-come in perfect serenity all difficulties that might arise in life, but also to put behind him all the doc-trines and dogmas of the outmoded religions of the masses—Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc. He knows"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"40 / Fire and Ice that the gnosis of the Absolutum (= \"divinity as an immaterial spectrum\") is an unattainable goal for the mass of humanity given its present state of evolu-tion.21 Knowing this, the FS does not reject humanity, but merely takes a more realistic view of it, and attempts to accelerate the evolution of mankind by means of the magical/initiatory tools at its disposal. The main spiritual tool of the FS is the initiation and transformation of individual brothers and sisters. This is done through magical training and ritual initia-tion. Through years of concentrated meditative and contemplative work in which he has been very severe with himself, the chela acquires the Saturnian attri-butes of seriousness, concentration, and critical thinking, as well as the Uranian qualities of intuition and knowledge. One of the first steps in this training is the rejection of speculative fantasies, and the concen-tration on fact and intellectual pursuit. This, it would appear, is the best foundation for more occult or magi-cal practices. Eventually, by following the magical curriculum of the FS, the brother or sister will become the master of all spheres of activity and endeavor. The initiate will become master of both the dark and white lights, and will be able to command the daemons of the nether regions as well as the angels of the mental spheres.22 Anyone already familiar with the work and curriculum of modern occult lodges will have noticed the unusual emphasis found in the FS on the \"dark side\" of the initiatory process. This, of course, origi-nates to some extent from the Saturnian archetype itself as it is commonly understood. But there are"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 41 further mysteries behind this that we will explore later. For now let it suffice to say that the FS preserves a gnosis of the shadow side of the light, the \"nightside of being.\" In Kabbalistic terms this is known as the qliphothic realm. However, and this is the pivotal point, at the same time the FS tries to cultivate the highest ethical standards when dealing with these forces.23 This is another instance of the Saturnian ten-dency to synthesize opposites into a dynamic process. Another manifestation of this tendency is the training principle of going against the natural grain of the character of the initiate. The magician willfully \"re-polarizes\" himself in ways contrary to his own innate nature. \"The rationalist must discover his soul, the romantic must express his essential rational char-acteristics ... \"24 In more esoteric terms this describes the alchemical process of coagulating the Saturnian lead with the Solar gold, or in astrological terms the from where it can descend to rule in an enlightened condition in the realm of Earth. Common to all these processes is the idea of a coagulation (a synthesis) of the extremities of a polarized system. Consequential to this process is an emphasis on the \"dark side\" which is just as essential as the \"light side.\" This is in contrast to the average modern occult lodges, which shun any reference to the darkness and pursue a unipolar development. This curiously enough leads them into an entanglement with the problem aspects of dualism—for the darkness abideth forever. In the final degrees of Saturnian initiation the brother or sister can fearlessly gaze upon the Guardian"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42 / Fire and Ice of the Threshold and the gate will be opened to him/ her that he/she may pass into the trans-Saturnian spheres. This may, it appears, come at the end of the brother's/sister's present incarnation. In any event, they will remain an integral part of the Brotherhood. The abyss does not frighten them as they prepare for their next incarnation, in which they may continue to serve the Earth in the interests of Saturn.25 Or they may permanently enter into the existence of the arche-daimonium in order to fulfill some higher tasks in the inner order. Whatever they do, they do it of their own truly free wills. By the time they reach this stage of initiation, the powers of life and death are in their hands, and these powers they can use as they will. The High Grade initiate \"will always re-crystallize him-self, even after he loses his present form.\"26 In an aeonic perspective, as understood within the FS, it is becoming more possible in the rising \"Emerald Dawn\" of the Saturnian-Uranian age to reform humanity in the light of this dawn. Ultimately, the goal is to bring this process to fruition, and to real-ize the exalted state of solitary freedom.27 Astral Gnosis As the name of the order indicates, the Frater¬ nitas Saturni places a heavy emphasis on astrological doctrines or astrosophy. The teachings which involve Saturn are derived from a basically Gnostic cosmol-ogy, in which the planet Saturn is identified with the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 43 Demiurge and with the Guardian of the Threshold (Hüter der Schwelle), who comes between the initiate rising through the planetary spheres and their access to the firmament and the light.28 As mentioned be-fore, the archetype of Saturn as portrayed in the FS is a manifold which fits into a complex cosmology. The FS teaches an astrosophical cosmogony and anthropogony (how the world and mankind came into being), as well as a unique cosmology describing the map of the world as it is now. Many elements of its cosmogony and eschatology are derived from the mystical Ger-man cosmologist Hans Hörbiger, who is perhaps best known from the portrayal of his ideas in The Morning of the Magicians.29 Most significant, however, are the FS doctrines concerning the procession of the equinoxes, which heralds the coming of the Age of Aquarius. The FS has a special perspective on this New Age. Astrosophy According to FS doctrines, on the seventh day of creation an angel (= Lucifer-Saturn) emanated from the Absolutum (= the Kabbalistic ainsoph). This angel was given rulership over the outermost sphere and became the Guardian of Time and Eternity. This entity stood at the outer limits of the limitless, girding itself in space and being and all creation. (The Gnostics also sometimes ascribed this function to Leviathan—the ouroboros—the serpent at the edge of the firmament grasping its own tail.) This angel, or god, rebelled"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 / Fire and Ice against the static, established cosmic order and set into motion the forces of change and evolution, which also imply death and destruction. This rebellion is referred to in Judeo-Christian mythology as the \"War in Heaven,\" and the angel or daemon is sometimes identified as (Hebrew) Abadon or (Greek) Apollyon. Reference to this may be found in Isaiah 14:12-15 and in Revelations 9:1. By breaking the static cosmic order the Rebel—Lucifer—became the creator of the visible world. This battle still rages between the polar opposites of the outer Saturnian sphere and the inner Solar Logos, with the Earth in the middle as the main field of battle.30 What for the most part seems to be a Gnostic cos-mology has been deeply influenced by the theories of Hans Hörbiger (1860-1931). Hörbiger believed that there were two principal forces contending in the universe: cosmic fire and cosmic ice (or German: Welteis). This fits admirably well with Germanic ideas of cosmogony, of course.31 For Hörbiger the cosmos was constantly expanding and contracting. It did this from central points. The primeval cosmos spewed out galaxies, galaxies spewed forth suns, and suns emitted planets. But the centripetal force of cosmic ice will cause each in its turn to collapse back in on itself. Into the solar system there have also wandered bodies that did not originally belong to this system, e.g. the Earth's moon(s), and the planets beyond Saturn. These trans-Saturnian planets belonged to the neighboring solar system of Alcyone in the Constellation of the Swan (Cygnus). In time these trans-Saturnian planets will be absored by Alcyone and eventually our Sun will"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 45 unite with that star as well.32 According to FS doctrines concerning the history of the Earth, there have been several moons orbiting the planet at one time or another. These moons were eventually drawn into the Earth by the centripetal force of \"cosmic ice\" as delineated by Hörbiger. There was a moon over \"Lemuria\" and subsequently one over \"Atlantis;\" both were catastrophically pulled to the surface of the Earth. Two twin moons, a white one, Luna, and a black one, Lilith, were then pulled into the Earth's orbit. The Earth has already absorbed the black moon, leaving Luna yet to be pulled down in a world catastrophe.33 These astrophysical phenomena are seen as the outward manifestations of the \"War in Heaven.\" The Luciferian Principle is understood as an expelled spark of the divine which has struggled through the dark-ness of matter, where this principle manifests itself as crystalline structure and as light. It struggled its way further through the kingdoms of plants and animals, and eventually emerged in humankind where the spark was liberated. Although generally ignorant of its true home and origin, this spark does carry in itself the memories of its primal state.34 It is a mainstay of Saturnian gnosis that the dark-ness contains the light. Therefore the darkness is necessary for light to exist. It follows then that in fact the darkness is superior to the light—ohne Finsternis leuchtet kein Licht! This light is activated within the matrix of darkness by the Logos—of the Demiurge Saturnus—that constantly speaks the words: \"Let there be light!\" The outermost station of this light is in"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 / Fire and Ice the planetary sphere of Saturn, where the light melts into darkness.35 As the solar system stands now, there is a dy-namic tension between the centrifugal force (the outer limits of which are defined by Saturn) and the cen-tripetal force (the center of which is the Sun). The centrifugal force—outward moving power—is the force of creativity and manifestation wielded by the Demiurge Saturnus, which is an expression of that force. This is the \"divine negative\" as the Creative Principle.36 The centripetal force—the centralizing or concentrative power—is that of restriction and lim-itation ruled by the Solar Logos: the Chrestos Princi-ple. Chrestos is Greek for \"the good one.\" These two forces are in continuous balance and each force con-tains the seed-principle of its opposite. There is, therefore, a profound and incomprehensible dark-ness at the center of the Solar Logos. This is the object of the Saturnian Solar Cult. At the same time, those who serve Saturn are also conducting a spiritualized solar cult in that they are promoting the return of the lost son (Saturn),who was hurled out of the Sun to his paternal Solar sphere.37 According to FS teachings, the Earth is also a com-plex sphere. Parallel to the physical plane of existence on this planet are two other planes or dimensions: the astral underlying this physical plane and the mental overlying it. Magically these are respectively seen as the dark-ness and light the magician must master in his work. Interestingly, the secret doctrine has it that the astral dimension has historically been interpreted as \"hell,\" while the mental zone has been seen as \"heaven.\"38"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 47 Kabbalistically, the effects of the negative causal principle of Saturn, which corresponds to the third sephira, called Binah (Understanding), is reflected in the ninth sephira, called Yesod (Foundation), which corresponds to the Moon. Therefore, in the astrosoph¬ ical doctrines of the FS, the effects of Saturn (= 3) are transmitted through the Moon (= 9)—the power of Saturn squared (32).39 The state of dynamic tension in which the cos-mos finds itself is, according to the laws of cosmic ice, eventually going to collapse. In fact, this collapse is already underway. Astronomically, this is a process of various planetary bodies being reabsorbed into the Sun. On the spiritual level this is tantamount to the principles, of which these planets are manifestations, being redeemed. Four planets have been redeemed as the FS doctrine has it. Two, Vulkan and Hermes, have already been consumed by the Sun, while Mercury and Venus have been drawn within its sphere of in-fluence. At some point, Jupiter and Saturn will merge, combining the mildness of Jupiter with the severity of Saturn. This will give rise to a new Golden Age.40 Eventually all the planets of the solar system will be thus \"redeemed,\" bringing to an end this cycle of exis-tence. In this whole process Gregorius said that the \"task of spiritual humanity is to participate con-sciously in the evolution of the Earth in order to redeem her.\"41"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"48 / Fire and Ice AEONIC COSMOSOPHY The Dark Side of the Aquarian Age The strict doctrines concerning cosmic aeons (from Greek aion, age) have their origin in Gnostic teachings of the early centuries of our era. This concept, although it had a certain magical role in ancient times, became enormously important with the magical work of Aleister Crowley following 1904. The FS, inspired by Crowley and by the current astrological speculations concerning the dawn of a New Age of Aquarius, devel-oped its own aeonic philosophy. It is essential to un-derstand this philosophy if the whole work of the Brotherhood is to be grasped. The ancient Gnostic sects of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions held that the aeons were the emanations of God. These emanations descended from the fullness (pleroma) of God's light into the darkness. Aeons are made up of an array of elements, the archons that rule them, the angels (Greek aggeloi, messengers) that provide for their dynamic interaction with the cosmos, the \"reasons\" (Greek logoi, or \"words\"), etc. In Gnostic practice these aeons were seen as barriers through which the initiate would have to pass after death until he gained the pleroma. In actual Gnostic teaching, then, an aeon is a phenomenon of time/ space.42 The Earth may pass though \"ages\" ruled over by archons (\"rulers\") of astrologically determined periods of time, but the individual soul of a man must"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 49 (Thelema), the True Will. In this the Great Beast had synthesized the old Gnostic idea of a natural progres-sion of the aeonic rulers on Earth and the idea of a god-like intervention from above, exemplified in the Gnostic Christology. Crowley had conjured a new way of magical thinking with his aeonic formulation, and it was one that struck a few responsive cords. Gregor A. Grego-rius accepted the advent of the aeonic current of also pass through the barriers of the aeon in order to return to the light. So much for the ancient doctrine. In Cairo, Egypt, Aleister Crowley received the text of a book dictated to him by a praeternatural entity identified as Aiwass or Aiwaz. This happened in 1904, and from that time on Crowley began to preach the advent of a new aeon, the Aeon of Horus, which in turn superceded the Aeons of Isis and Osiris. It is clear that Crowley understood himself as an agent and an indespensable element of this new aeon, the Word of the Aeon made flesh. From that point he was to func-tion as a Magus (although he was not to claim that grade until 1915), and as the Utterer of an Aeonic Word. Theoretically, it became his task and his curse to or O.T.O.), nor his authority in non-aeonic matters. In 1948 Crowley's own disciple, Charles Stansfield Jones (Frater Achad), claimed to have uttered a new Word superceding that of Thelema. Achad's Word was supposedly Ma-Ion or Ma'at—the Egyptian goddess of truth and justice. All this turned out rather badly, as Jones ended his days in obscurity and insanity."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"50 / Fire and Ice Of course, many hold to orthodox notions of \"aeonic questions\" pronounced more or less clearly by Aleister Crowley, while others even attempt to work with Achad's formulation. The dynamic under-standing of the Setian Xeper, as continually articulated by its Magus, provides a more individuated and clearly articulated aeonic pathway than any of the previous attempts to work with such \"Aeonic Words.\" In any event, some perspective on these aeonic concepts cannot be ignored when one is trying to understand the history of magical thinking in twentieth-century Western tradition. In the FS the advent of the new aeon is seen first and foremost in astrological terms. It is the equivalent of the Age of Aquarius, ruled by the planetary archon Saturnus. The role of the Master Therion's Aeonic Word seems to be of secondary importance. What might be of widespread interest is the magico-astrological insight into the fact that the Aquarian Age will be one ultimately ruled by the dark Saturno-Uranian archon or demiurge. The cosmosophy of the FS is dependent on the natural procession of the equinoxes into the sign of Aquarius, which as a sign of the zodiac is traditionally said to be ruled by the planet Saturn. With the dis-covery of trans-Saturnian planets, and after astrology had synthesized them into its system, the planet Uranus was also said to rule this sign. This physical event, as well as the other astrophysical phenomena taking place in the cosmos and more particularly within our solar system, are reflections of metaphysi-cal events occurring simultaneously with the physical ones. The same can be said for the birth of the solar"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 51 system, and its eventual entropic collapse. Although it is stated that \"every age or epoch contains within itself the power necessary to its own fulfillment,\"43 humanity as a whole resists this reali-zation. It is only open to and known by the truly elect within a society. Humanity is for the most part still dominated by an unyielding law of self-destruction that rules in all realms of being, organic as well as inorganic. Knowledge and experience of the archdai-monic principle embodied in Saturn can, however, free the initiate from the laws of cause and effect. In other terms, man can liberate himself from his own karma.44 Beyond the moral aspects of this, these ideas are also useful in formulating a notion of how Satur-nian magic works. It is the progression of the individual beyond the threshold—beyond the barrier—in order to become separate from the internal, objective cos-mos. In theory, the Aquarian Age, the aeon of Saturn, should be manifest first and foremost within the magically elect. The influence of the coming Aquarian Age is being guided by the Demiurge Saturnus, which is in turn being transformed through Uranian influence. The present, fading Piscean Age is (was) ruled by Jupiter, under the hidden influence of Neptune. The Neptunian influence is thought to be exercising tremen-dous force at the close of the Piscean Age in the area of politics; hence the upsurge in collectivistic and com-munistic ideals. This tide will, however, suddenly turn, and this influx will be destroyed by the surging Uranian power.

It will be up to the emerging Saturno-Uranian spirit and its elect to bring a new order out of this chaos. In this process the old nature of Saturn is undergoing a transformation as well. It is becoming more \"spiritual,\" while at the same time it retains its basic quality of stability and solidity. The synthesis of these qualities leads to a powerful balance in which the powers of the spirit are directed and manifested in exacting, precise ways which are as yet unheard of.45 In the Saturnian view, there does seem, to be sure, a dark side of the Age of Aquarius. Based on some fairly objectively interpreted astrological teach-ings, it could be concluded that the Aquarian Age will only appear to be one of rational and humanitarian egalitarianism.

The FS has its own mytho-magical understanding of what the nature of this entity is, how it relates to the order's astrosophy, and to the initiatory work of the order. Gregorius, although not as ingenious a poet or artist as Crowley, was nevertheless more straightforward in his approach to the role of darkness and the Luciferian light than was the Master Therion. Perhaps it is for this reason that Gregorius was less \"perplexed\" than Crowley. In the FS, Lucifer is understood as the Light Bearer for mankind. As a result of being given this light by Lucifer, which continues to be reborn in every generation of humanity, mankind will be able to take a measure of egocentric power from the solar Logos. In this way Lucifer is the savior of humankind, at least for that part of humanity that has been able to com-prehend his Principle. The essence of the Saturnian cult is the effort to understand this entity and to con-sciously make use of its power in the service of the solar Logos (Sorath).46 Gregorius was always anxious to point out that this Luciferian mythology was in fact older than the ignorant misunderstandings and willful distortions of the Judeo-Christian tradition. He claimed to have his"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"54 / Fire and Ice knowledge from a pre-Christian and/or non-Christian sect of \"Barbelo-Gnostics.\"47 In the FS Lucifer is the embodiment of enlightenment and reason; there are none of the destructive slanders against him as in the Christian tradition. However he came by it, Gregorius does seem to have a correct interpretation of the relative roles of that entity referred to as the Light-Bearer (Greek Eos-phoros) and that referred to as \"God.\" Perhaps the oldest version of the Lucifer myth is that of the Greek Prometheus (\"he who has foreknowledge\"). Traditions differ on many details of the Promethean mythology, but what is essential is that Prometheus, wishing to help and preserve mankind (some say he even created mankind), brought the divine fire—or higher con-sciousness—and bestowed it upon men. This was the first enlightenment of humanity. Zeus, however, was angered and punished Prometheus by hurling him into the depths of Erebus. There he was staked to a mountain—an image prefiguring the crucifixion by hundreds of years. The point is that the \"creator god,\" here Zeus (in the Judeo-Christian tradition Jehova), wants to keep humanity in subjugation and slavery to the \"natural laws\" which he has set up—but a rebel figure, here Prometheus (elsewhere Lucifer) befriends man and brings him the means to become as one of the gods. This is the fundamental idea underlying the Luciferian stance of the FS and its connection to pre-and non-Christian attitudes toward the myth.

The rebel spirit Lucifer opened the way for man's rebellion and hence his salvation; Jahveh would have held man in the eternal bondage of ignorance. The Serpent gave Knowledge (Gk. gnosis)—and thus is the true friend of mankind and his true liberator. Any other interpretation of the text of Genesis 3 would seem wildly imaginative. Following basically Gnostic thought, the doc-trines of the FS contain a Christology that is consistent with this view of the Eden myth. They would hold that the Ophite/Naassene teaching that the Serpent (Heb. nechesh) in the Garden of Eden and the Anointed One (Heb. messiach)—the Christos—are one in the same. This could be backed up with the Kabbalistic interpretation of nechesh = N.Ch.Sh. = 50.8.300. = 358 and messiach = M.Sh.Y.Ch. = 40.300.10.8. = 358. That both, according to the esoteric laws of gematria, render the sum of 358 demonstrates their essential unity. The Christos is a messenger and son of the Serpent, therefore, and not of the Creator. This Christos preaches gnosis (knowledge) and not pistis (faith). The Serpent of Eden is further identified with the brazen serpent of Exodus and with the serpent-entwined staff of Hermes, the caduceus.48 According to FS teaching, the Serpent of Eden may also be iden-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"56 / Fire and Ice tified with Satana, the feminine aspect of Satanas. This in turn corresponds to the kundalini—serpent power—of Indian tantric lore. The truly beneficent principle is, however, identified as the Chrestos, not Christos. The Chrestos, the Good-One, is the designa-tion of the beneficial solar entity. Lucifer would also appear to have a central role in the origin of humanity, and in the origin of death. It is thought that Lucifer brought about physical procrea-tion through a primeval sexual act with Cheva (Eve). With procreation came death; but of course without death there is no change, no evolution. Thus the opening of the gate of death, the act of \"sinking into matter,\" was a necessary step to link man to the current whereby Paradise can again be gained. But this time humanity will do it consciously and of its own will, and thus gain eternal life and wisdom. Then man will have truly become his own god—which is the path of Saturn.49 Also in accordance with its Gnostic heritage, the FS doctrines lay a strong emphasis on dualism. Not so much a good-versus-evil dualism, but rather a beyond-good-and-evil dualism summed up in the Saturn-Gnostic dictum: lux e tenebris—Light from the Dark-ness! In an article entitled \"Saturn-Yoga,\" Gregorius stated: \"Without Darkness there is no Light. The Light shines in the Darkness and the Darkness is more powerful than the Light!\"50 This is an idea we have already met which simply states that the Light is held in a matrix of Darkness, that both are necessary to existence, and that it is the goal of the practitioner of Saturnian Gnosis to gain experience in, and mastery over, both the Light and the Darkness. The Saturnian"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 57 view is one clearly shown in the familiar yin-yang symbol used by the Taoists: Figure 2.1: The Yin-Yang in which the seed of the opposite quality is shown to be embedded in the depths of its counterpart. Thus there is a heart of Darkness within the Sun, and the Saturnian Darkness shines with a profound Light. The true god of Saturnian Gnosis is a Janus-faced entity—Baphomet: Temohpab—a god containing both a positive and a negative side. Both paths, that of the Right and that of the Left, lead to the Absolutum, which stands beyond good and evil. Again, true to Gnosticism, the Saturnian emphasizes that the initiate must enter a path—and work and experience.51 The Luciferian mythos is, of course, also accounted for in astrophysical terms within the teachings of the FS. The \"Fall\" of Lucifer from \"Heaven\" is equated"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"58 / Fire and Ice with the physical event of the expulsion of the plane-tary masses from the solar sphere. Lucifer is identified with the \"higher octave\" of Saturn (in astrology this is also equated with the planet Uranus, the planet of rebellion). In this planetary position, Saturn-Lucifer has been able to rule all the planetary entities within its orbit, being especially forceful on the planet Earth. Again the Earth is the main field of contention be-tween the Solar Logos and the Luciferian Principle.52 The initiate struggles toward a harmonious arrival at the Theonium of Saturn, and not toward the Sun, because the Sun would destroy and consume him. The Saturnian sphere offers enlightenment, control, and independence. This always returns to the essen-tially complex structure of that which is called Saturn. It must always be remembered, for example, that the Saturnian sphere contains the seed of the Chrestos-Principle.53 Gregorius poetically described some of the Luci-ferian Gnosis in a poem entitled Fallen Angel, which was first published in the Blätter (January 1955), p. 11: For millions of years he stood before God's Throne as a guardian, watchman, and caretaker. But when the son returned, his hand grasped only emptiness. He stood before God and saw him not. He called unto God in vain and his soul wept. But in the distance glowed in the firmament a blue star, and a voice spoke unto him:"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 59 I seek Thee, come Thou to me, give me Thy hands. A pale visage shone in the distance, and a slender hand began to work. Aeons descended from him to sink into the sea of ages. The great angel standing there, was once his brother and commander, who now has left him. Now his voice again calls to him— and through the spheres his call resounds out to one, who created him: \"Satanas Triumphator!\" The basis for the ambivalent stance of the FS toward the whole Luciferian aspect in the Saturnian Gnosis is clearly revealed in the doctrines concerning the actual esoteric structure of the entity Saturnus. Around the physical planet Saturn is arrayed a com-plex of entities constituting internal and external aspects, as well as higher and lower octaves of the planet. A composite of these might appear as shown in Figure 2.2 on the following page. As has been intimated, the outer and ruling aspect of the planetary genius is that of Saturn with all its previously outlined characteristics. A part of this is the egregore of the FS itself—the GOTOS.

How-ever, this purely \"Satanic\" aspect can be ultimately as dangerous and destructive to consciousness as is the self-obliterating power of the Sun. The Saturnian brother must remain concentrated on the higher octave in order to remain fully conscious and inde-pendent (consistent with the Luciferian Principle), and not fall into the lower to become a mere tool of the Demiurge. In the working or ritual aspects of the FS curricu-lum the Luciferian Principle is also highly evident. Some of this will be far more fully explored in the practices and rituals of the Brotherhood in Chapter 4. However, at this time it is worth pointing out that the \"Sacrament of Light\" in the FS is understood primarily as a Luciferian Mass in which the initiate experiences the transcendent in the immanent. This experience leads to meranoi—transformations in the initiate. The ultimate end of these transformations, according to FS doctrine, is the cessation of the necessity of incar-nation, as the individual light merges with the Light of the World.55 This transformation in the Luciferian Light is not completely manifested in the grade system of the FS until the 33°. The complete name of this degree makes the nature of this attainment clear: \"Gradus Ordinis Templi Orientis Saturni im Orden des dunklen Lichts\" (i.e., Grade of the Order of the Eastern Temple of Saturn in the Order of the Dark Light).56 Ultimately, this work does not end in the obliteration of the self in the ainsoph, but rather in the deification of that transformed self.

In their astrosophy, the spiritual changes coming about in the world which are mirrored in astrophysical processes (i.e., here the procession of the equinox into the zodiacal sign of Aquarius ruled by Saturn/Uranus) are tantamount to the advent of an Age of Lucifer. This is what Gregorius must have recognized in Aleister Crowley's \"Equinox of the Gods\" concept, in which the Age of Osiris gives way to the Age of Horus.57 But it must be quickly pointed out that Gregorius had his own ideas of what all this meant and how the aeonic process worked. Generally speaking the ideas of Gregorius were more consistent, mainly because he did not shrink from the \"dark aspects\" and clear Luciferian connotations. The Lucifer of the FS system is understood first and foremost as a part of the Saturnian planetary sphere and is clearly identified with pre- or non-Christian Gnostic con-cepts. Therefore any attempt to characterize the FS as \"Satanic\" in the Christian sense of the term must fail."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"64 / Fire and Ice THE YOGA OF THE DARK LIGHT FS Sexual Mysticism It is probably in the area of the practice of sexual magic that the FS has become most notorious in esoteric circles. This notoriety has chiefly come about through the publication of reports or isolated documents58 that perhaps give some idea of the kind of sexual magic practiced in the FS. But these reports are never-theless largely taken out of context and therefore can not give anything but a distorted picture of actual FS theories and practices. In Chapter 4 we will provide some practices of Saturnian sex-magic, as well as the full rite of the Pentalphic Grade, which has until now only been alluded to in print. The background of sex-ual magic in the FS is closely related to that of the O.T.O. as discussed in Chapter 1. However, the FS under Gregorius developed some of its own ideas, mainly based on astrosophical and Gnostic precepts, along with what was at the time (i.e., late 1920s) modern sexology.59 Here we will try to concentrate on those concepts and doctrines relatively unique to the FS.60 For the most part, sex-magical practices in the FS were confined to the work of the 18° (Pentalphic). In this degree the initiate makes a deep study of the sex-ual magic and mysticism as outlined in the O.T.O. sys-tem. It is clear that the whole O.T.O. system—which is supposed to be something more than sex-magic—"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 65 obviously exerted a strong influence over the FS. The clearest expression of this is in the name GOTOS. Beyond the overt practice of sex-magical techniques, a whole \"sexual cosmology\" was deeply embedded in FS doctrine. This teaching is partly taken from tantric and quasi-tantric systems and partly derived directly from Gnostic sexual cosmologies. From tantrism the FS derived its theories of the chakra system in the human body, which was conceived of as being naturally polarized in one way (negatively) in women, and another way (positively) in men.61 A survey of the numerous allegorical and mythic representations of Gnostic cosmologies62—descriptions of how the world came into being—shows that many of the FS doctrines on sexuality could have possibly been taken from the general picture outlined in Gnosticism. In the ancient gnosis the ultimate god-form manifested from the god-head. This god-form is three-fold, consisting of mind (Greek nous), thought (Greek ennoia) and reason (or word, Greek logos). From this masculine entity emanated the first aeon, which is defined as his own mirror image reflected in the \"pure water of light.\" This first aeon is called either Barbelo or Sophia (wis-dom)—the feminine aspect of the father-god—herself androgynous. She is the mother of the Demiurge and is also responsible for implanting the \"divine spark\" in humanity. This Sophia is regarded ambivalently by the Gnostics as she was the first entity to suffer a \"fall,\" perhaps due to her excessive cravings and curiosities concerning knowledge. This ambivalence is subsequently reflected in human women, and is"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"66 / Fire and Ice represented in the esoteric Eden myth by both Lilith and Eve.63 There are obvious correspondences be-tween the relationships of Father—God : Barbelo/ Sophia; Adam : Lilith/Eve; and astronomically, Sun : Moon/Earth, etc. This lore seems to form the matrix of FS sexual mysticism. But it must be remembered that the FS is essentially an eclectic, innovative, and somewhat pragmatic order, so no one set of doctrines tends to dominate it completely. The Saturnian Gnosis is a unique Gnostic teaching. The very nature of the sexes is, according to the Saturnian Gnosis, a part of the same phenomenal process as the manifestation and evolution of the planetary bodies. Gregorius held that the negatively polarized manifestations of Saturnian and Lunar forces were, on Earth, incarnated in the forms of women, who are the vicars of the Luciferian Principle. The sometimes ambivalent attitude toward this principle leads to an ambivalent stance toward women as a phenomenon. It is even stated at one point that the esotericist should seek to free himself of the feminine daimonium by means of sexual magic.64 In contrast, men are esoterically the manifestation of the Solar and Jupiterian forces. For sex-magical work, of course, women are seen to correspond to the planet Venus, and men to the planet Mars. This will be outlined further in the sections dealing with sex-magical prac-tices. Gregorius claimed that Karl Kellner (founder of the O.T.O.) taught that sexuality held the key to understanding cosmogony, and that the natural laws of sexuality were a mirror or shadow image of cosmic"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 67 processes. The most concentrated manifestation of these cosmic realities were in those physical parts of the sexes which most distinguished one from the other: the sexual organs themselves. Thus, the phallus is a symbol and manifestation of the divine willpower of imagination, of the faculty of image-making. Converse-ly, the female genitalia, or kteis, is the symbol and manifestation of the plasmic emulsion of expansive chaos, the matrix in which reality takes shape. The manifestation of all realities is then made possible by a willed projection of consciously visualized image into this chaotic matrix.63 There was a relative lack of women initiates in the FS, which is revealed in the rosters printed in some of the interna from the 1950s and early 1960s. This, no doubt, would be explained in poetic terms from the libretto of the opera Die Zauberflöte by W. A. Mozart: Ein Weib, das Nacht und Tod nicht scheut Ist würdig und wird eingeweiht.66 (Act II, Scene 5) The essential problem would seem to be that women are thought to be generally shy of the night-side of reality, despite men's hopeful projections upon them. It is truly a special woman who comes to terms with this aspect. This reference to Mozart's Magic Flute is telling in another way in that it is deemed an important accomplishment in the initiatory progress if the magi-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"68 / Fire and Ice cian can find and work with a woman who embodies his \"sister soul.\"67 Conversely, the woman magician must find her \"brother soul.\" In its early years the FS was in many ways unable to fulfill its own \"New Age\" vision of itself with regard to sexual mysticism. From an aeonic perspective per-haps it was just too early. Probably not until the latter half of the 1960s were the aeonic elements in place to give a true expression to \"Saturnian sexuality.\" Much that was lacking seems due to the \"nature bound\" aspects of sexuality and the aforementioned \"ambiva-lent\" attitude toward women. Some greater under-standing in these fields has been offered by Frater Nietzschean Thelemism The official motto of the FS is \"Tue was Du willst ist das ganze Gesetz, es gibt kein Gesetz über tue was Du willst. Liebe ist das Gesetz—Liebe unter Willen— Mitleidlose Liebe.\" (Do what Thou wilt is the whole of The Yoga of the Dark Light is quite literally the practice of the union, here through sex-magical tech-niques, with the fleshy embodiment of one's own opposite self. Here, the Dark Light is interpreted as the Saturnian/Luciferian light as incarnate in the sexual partner, with whom ritual coitus or other practices are performed. The Dark Light can also be equated with the magical power of sexuality and of the orgasm."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Doctrines of the Fraternitas Saturni / 69 the Law, there is no Law beyond do what Thou wilt. Love is the Law—Love under Will—Compassionless Love.) The first part of the motto is the familiar Crowleyan Thelemite formula, which is left unaltered. The second part, which is the response to the first, has been slightly altered in Saturnian practice. The words mitleidlose Liebe, which may be translated as \"com-passionless love,\" or \"love without pity,\" make the Saturnian nature of this love clear. It refers to both the \"love\" of the Demiurge Saturnus or the GOTOS for his minions on Earth, i.e. his stern \"testing,\" and to the kind of \"love\" that a Saturnian brother should show toward others. One of Aleister Crowley's most interesting dis-cussions of love is found in his Eight Lectures on Yoga,69 where he says that \"love under will\" is a unit's \"instinct to unite, and the act of uniting... with its opposite.\" Here Crowley appeals to a model of nature when he says that hydrogen seeks to combine with oxygen and not with other molecules of hydrogen— which is not in the \"nature, or the 'true Will,' of hyd-rogen.\" Thus Crowley identifies natural order with \"true Will.\" According to Crowley's theories, if not his own practices, the ultimate act of love should be the act of flinging \"ourselves up into the furnace of ecstasy which flames from the abyss of annihilation.\"70 To avoid and to deny the desirability of this act of love is the essence of Black Magic—as the essence of White Magic is self-annihilation. It seems that it was this aspect that the FS wished to clarify with the addition of the phrase \"compassionless love.\"71"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"70 / Fire and Ice It appears certain that here too the FS doctrines are drawn from Nietzschean concerns. In his great book, Thus spoke Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche devotes a whole section to \"On Pitying.\"72 Here, and in many places elsewhere, Nietzsche equates the act of pitying with that of self-annihilation. Here Nietzsche says indeed \"God is dead\"—but what does he say killed him?—\"his pity (i.e. 'love') for man.\" Zarathus-tra preaches \"all great love is even above all its pity, for it still wants to create the beloved\"— love with-out pity. A \"pitiful\" love is one in which the lover is annihilated by the beloved; love without pity is where the lover—or magician—creates his beloved out of his own self. So in many ways the FS addition of these two words to the whole Thelemite formula put a whole new perspective on the philosophy. Rather than seek-ing self-annihilation beyond the threshold, the Satur-nian Brother seeks to become his own god. Crowley never tired of calling those who endorsed, or seemed to him to endorse, this path of non-self-annihilation \"Black Brothers\" (or \"Brothers of the Left-hand Path\"). Perhaps it was because the Beast himself was one of these (yet denied it, even to himself) that, when con-fronted with the ultimate moment of truth, he was so \"perplexed.\"73 In summary, the doctrines of the FS are generally consistent with its cosmology and theology (or \"dae-monology\").

This is articulated through their grade system, which generally allots special work and functions to each of the thirty-three degrees. The lodges are largely administrative structures designed to support this initiatory path as best they can. Magically, the first step in initiation in the FS sys-tem is the blending of the chela into the \"Chain of Brotherhood\" by ritually bonding him into the order's stream of psychic power. The initiate takes advantage 73"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"74 / Fire and Ice of this reservoir of energy for his work, while provid-ing some measure of it to the collective work of the whole Brotherhood as well. In point of magical fact it is the Demiurge Satur-nus that is the true initiator of all brothers and sisters in the order. This process of initiation—of being brought into gradually higher sacred states—is also called \"Saturn-Yoga.\" This is described as a form of raja-yoga (= intellectual path to union). By this path the initiate is led through the starry spheres toward a mental unity. In the final level of this process the brother becomes a king-like lord at the summit of knowledge. He attains what is called \"Saturn-Gnosis.\" The actual number of paths to this gnosis, to the Guardian of the Threshold, are very few. Those who reach this goal are marked by their \"serious, taciturn, and deeply philosophical\" natures. It is only these who can truly understand what \"Do what Thou wilt\" and \"compassionless love\" mean.1 After a certain point a Saturnian brother must recognize that he can no longer worship the personal god commonly imaged in Christian churches. The need to do so will be an indication of his lack of prepa-ration for higher knowledge. The Demiurge sternly tests those on the path toward it. Before crossing the Threshold one will often have to suffer in a state of preparation. But once this Threshold is crossed the initiate is—through Gnostic experience—protected from the former perception of suffering.

In the Outer Court Grades (0°—11°) no lifelong commitments are made. Once one enters the Rosicrucian Grades (R+C Grades, 12 °—20°), lasting commitments are made to the order and to the Satur-nian current. The High Degrees are 21°—29° and are referred to as Degrees of High Honors. The degrees 30°—33° are the High Honorary Degrees. The degrees from 29°—33° can be held only by one living person. In other words, there can only be one holder of each of these last five degrees living at any one time.

These cells were com-pletely private unto the individual initiates engaged in them and had nothing officially to do with the FS proper. The writings relative to them were the private diaries of the members of the group, copies of which could be sent around in confidential correspondence. Supposedly this not only lent the legal element of \"deniability\" to the lodge, but it also magically diverted any responsibility from the lodge to the individuals involved. This last point has special reference to the general occult doctrine of karma. At one time or another, general sex magical practices (especially those involving multiple sex partners or partners of the same sex), ceremonies involving illegal drugs (which the FS especially likes to use in its incense), animal sacrifice, and even evocatory magic or spiritualistic operations were treated in such \"study circles.\"8 At various times in the history of the FS its official relationship to practical magic in general and to the distinctions between \"black\" and \"white\" magic have been very ambiguous. In this book we have been con-centrating on what the documentary record shows rather than on official statements meant more or less for public consumption."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Magical Work The magical work of the Fraternitas Saturni takes place on many levels. One strongly emphasized aspect is the regular curriculum of private magical training. This is undertaken essentially in solitude and is shaped by the progressive curriculum outlined in the degree system. But powerful and elaborate group rituals, some of a sacramental nature, are also regularly prac-ticed. The complete rubrics for four of these are given below. Perhaps what the FS is most notorious for are its sex-magical practices. Although the importance of these practices seems exaggerated when put into perspective, they are a core aspect of the order—given its Gnostic cosmosophical understanding—and one that deserves further exploration. Among the many unusual features of Saturnian magical usage are its use of Freemasonic ritual formulae, its Luciferian emphasis, its full complement of sacramental rites, 89"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"90 / Fire and Ice the use of electrical technology in a magical framework, and the detailing of sex-magical practices. Finally, the undisguised way in which most of these features are treated also is notable. This latter aspect is entirely due to the fact that we have been made privy to the old interna of the order, which were not originally meant for \"public consumption.\" Magical Training Magical training of the chela (a Sanskrit word roughly meaning \"student of a master\") is something the student is expected to largely glean from the ex-tensive graded internal literature of the FS, which comes in the form of the Papers for the Applied Art of Life, the Papers for the Applied Art of Occult Living, other instructional letters, and a vast reading list of books to be studied at various levels.1 Gregorius was in a good position to provide the published literature, as he was in the business of selling new and used occult books. The grade system of the order provides the curriculum of magical study, and the literature specific to each guide constitutes the lessons along the way; the formal workings provide the grounds for demonstration and ceremonial affirmation of the progress made by the student. Elements of the chela's private magical training include the disciplining of the will through pro-gressive exercises in visualization or imagination, autosuggestion, contemplation, and meditation. In"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 91 addition, exercises in mantra-mysticism (i.e., incan-tational formulae) are linked to the awakening of the chakras. This also includes work with \"vocalic breath-ing\"2 in conjunction with visualization and concen-tration. Dream-work is also engaged, wherein the initiate observes and learns to control his dreams. While the chela is engaged in these exercises, he or she is also encouraged to begin to develop a comprehen-sive \"physical culture\"—that is, a regimen of physical fitness and what amounts to a \"cult of the body\"— and also to cultivate a general love of nature. Once these things have progressed sufficiently, practical magical re-designing of one's personality and magical experiments in influencing the environment are begun. In the sex-magical sphere, the chela is encouraged to master the sexual drives and direct them in harmonious and magically beneficial ways. The experience of sex-uality becomes spiritualized and the initiate learns to polarize the sexual \"odic\"3 forces. One of the aims of this work is the healing of the relations between the sexes in this aeon. The initiate creates trance states for contact with his own prenatal life, as a proof of the doctrine of reincarnation. There is also the develop-ment of a special relationship with the Earth-Spirit {Erdgeist)4 and eventually experiments in which com-mand is gained over intermediate astral and/or plan-etary entities and daemons.5 This latter set of practices is largely gleaned from old German grimoires of the Faustian tradition, first published from the 15th to the 17th centuries. Some of these were reprinted by the FS for internal use.6 At various points the FS literature will refer to the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"92 / Fire and Ice initiate's experience of epopteia, which will even-tually come due to his magical work and training. This term is taken from the vocabulary of the Greek mys-tery religions and denotes the third stage in their pro-gressive initiatory process. The first stage is katharsis (purification), in which the candidate is prepared but remains in a probationary status. The second stage is myesis, which is the actual initiation into the mystery where communion is taken. Finally epopteia is the direct or indirect experience of the god of the mystery itself. It is considered direct evidence of the truth of the god. This final stage is blessedness or \"salvation itself.\"7 Here again we see the close parallels between the work of the FS lodge and the ancient traditions from which it draws its techniques. The ultimate aim of this process is for the initiate to pass beyond good and evil and to attain the ultimate power of an independent, and truly real, entity: to become his own god. This can be done if one attains this status without violating the laws of harmony.8 Lodge Rituals Most of the well-documented magical workings of the FS take place in the context of a lodge ceremony. Outside the lodge setting, other private magical workings take place for purposes of training or for other indi-vidual operative ends. We will take up a discussion of some of these private, sometimes \"unofficial\" workings under the heading \"Secret Sex-Magical Practices of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 93"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"94 / Fire and Ice the FS\" below; but for the most part, we will focus on the various sacraments and lodge rites of the FS and the furnishing of the lodge itself. The lodge room (or temple) of an FS lodge is set up according to the general structural principles found in the work of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, as shown in Figure 4.1. A vivid picture of the appearance and atmos-phere of a Saturnian lodge is provided by Gregorius himself in his occult novel Exorial.9 Most typically the lodge room will be draped in black with silver magical signs on the walls, or draped in dark green with black insignia. Most often the magical sigils would be in \"inverse\" position, pointing downward in order to activate telluric or chthonic powers. Black and dark green are the emblematic colors of the lodge. The brothers and sisters will usually be garbed with black satin robes fitted with arcane insignia par-ticular to the order and to their grades. Other vestments can be worn for specific operations; these garments would be affixed with magical and astrological signs particular to the spirits being invoked. In the photo of Gregor A. Gregorius on p. 28, he is wearing a hoodless black satin robe, to the front of which has been added a dark green panel. Over this is affixed a white Tau-cross. The stola around his shoulders is decorated with the pentagram, sigils of Saturn and Pluto, and a symbol of the cosmic phallus. The talisman around his neck is an emblem of the 33° which consists of a Rosy Cross superimposed on a pentagram under which a circular mandala is fixed. On his head he wears a magical headband to which is attached an emblematic"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 95 staff, which symbolizes his power to rule through Saturn—the lord of this world. Among the many magical weapons that might be used in an FS or related rite, perhaps the one invested with the greatest importance is the magical ring. The basic design of this ring appears in Figure 4.2. Each aspect of the ring's design has a magical significance. It is made of silver, the metal corresponding to the Moon. The Moon is the channel through which Satur-nian influence is transmitted to the Earth. The ring's overall circular shape represents the arch-serpent as the divine principle. The isosceles triangle symbolizes the number of Saturn, while the glyph of Saturn is its main emblem. A stone corresponding to the initiate's grade is set in the crook of the Saturnian glyph. This ring is more than an emblem of membership. It is considered to be a magical channel for the com-munication of the Saturnian force to the individual member. As such it would ideally be worn at all times, but if not, was supposed to be worn at least on Satur-days. When not being worn the ring was to be stored in black silk. As a medium by which the Saturnian initiate is connected to the lodge over time and space, there are certain ritual procedures by which these linkages could be effected. If the initiate wants to make con-tact with the lodge the ring is turned with the point of the triangle outward. But normally it is worn with the point facing back towards the initiate. This allows for the constant flow of power from the Brotherhood to isosceles triangle decorated with an inverted Tau-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"96 / Fire and Ice the individual. Also, when the initiate receives the ring it is to be charged by being placed in the light of the full Moon or in the moonlight during Moon-Saturn conjunctions, or when these two planets are in trine or sextile aspects. Figure 4.2: The Satumian Ring Besides these personal rings there are also rings particular to certain degrees or types of workings. The Pentalphic (18°) ring is (or was) especially important. There are masculine and feminine forms for this ring. The masculine form consists of a rectangular ruby flanked below by two small moonstones, making the with a small diamond set at its lower tip.

There are also rings designed for specific thauma-turgical use independent of grade. These are octagonal with an inverse golden pentagram, and set with amethyst. The ring itself is of hollow silver filled with mercury.10 The lodge ritual often also included the perfor-mance of certain ceremonial grips or signs, which were a part of the Masonic heritage of the FS. The Grip of Brotherhood is done by touching the pulse-point of the other person with the tip of the index finger. The master sign is done by laying the right hand over the solar plexus with the thumb spread out from the hand. The sign of the 31° is the upraised index finger laid across the lips vertically, the 32° does the same with the index and middle fingers, and the 33° sign consists of laying the right hand with the thumb spread out across the throat.11 The Saturnian Liturgy The two main direct sources for FS rituals are the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (for the initiation ceremonies) and the Pansophical Lodge. However, there was a constant effort to con-nect the rites to sects of pre-Christian Gnostics.12 Other masses and rituals are derived from the O.T.O. (pre- and post-Crowleyan), and from Crowley's revisions"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"98 / Fire and Ice In addition, the FS freely innovated from what can be gleaned from Rosicrucian, tantric, goetic, and Gnostic practices and rituals. From Gregorius' novelized account we have a good idea of what initiation into the lodge is like.13 The first part of the ceremony takes place in an antechamber outside the temple-room. The neophyte is hooded and placed in a chair before a mirror. The hood is removed and photographic images are projected onto the mirror. These images portray the Guardian of the Threshold, signs of the order, and depictions of the four tests of Egyptian initiation,14 through which he is taken by means of guided visualizations. In the second part of the rite the candidate is led through a green door into the temple room, where he or she is tested in a question-and-answer exchange with the Master of the Ceremony. The candidate then receives the in-structions relevant to the 1° and is given a lodge name. This new name, written on a piece of parch-ment, is later burned in the brazier together with a piece of parchment on which the candidate's profane name has been written. This is supposed to magically bind the two names together. Finally the initiate is ceremonially addressed with the words: \"Brother (or Sister) N. N., we greet thee!\" He/she then receives a seat in the lodge reserved to his/her special lodge number, and he/she is given a green-bound book with the sign of the lodge on it. In this book the initiate is expected to record his work. As what follows will show, the FS has an especially rich liturgy with a wide variety of ritual types and functions. However, there are certain basic structural"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 99 features that underlie most of their workings. This structure is analyzed by Hemberger in twelve stages:15 1. Doors are closed and guarded by the Wardens armed with swords. 2. In the antechamber the brothers prepare for the ritual by silently donning their vestments. 3. The initiates silently go to their appointed seats in the lodge room. 4. Lodge candles are lit. 5. A meditation is engaged in. 6. Mantras are demonstrated and sung. 7. An invocation is performed. 8. An evocation is effected through magical for-mulae and the formation of the Magical Chain of Brotherhood, accomplished by a rhythmic breathing exercise. 9. Direct experience of communion with the daimon of the lodge or the intelligence(s) that have been called upon. 10. A mysto-magical submergence into a trance state. All lights except the Eternal Light of the lodge are extinguished. 11. The collected will is sent out to form the dynamide or condensation of power. At this point contact is made with other lodges work-ing the rite simultaneously, or with those brothers who have passed away. 12. In conclusion, a license to depart is pronounced in which all powers and intelligences that have been called upon are sent back. All brothers then leave the temple room."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"100 / Fire and Ice These twelve steps could be summarized by the key-words: 1) Sealing, 2) Compression, 3) Procession, 4) Illumination, 5) Meditation, 6) Mantra, 7) Invoca-tion, 8) Magical Chain, 9) Communion, 10) Sub-mergence, 11) Projection, and 12) Departing. The general purpose of this process is the conditioning of the psyche to project its will (collectively or individ-ually) in a magically effective way. The Saturnian Sacraments The FS is a magical initiatory order, but it also has the functions of a sacerdotal religion. It therefore also maintains a complete sacramental liturgy of mystical rites in addition to its magical workings. Here the main distinction between mysticism and magic is that in magical rites the working of the will of the magician(s) is primary, while in mysticism (as in religion) there is a preordained state or process into which the will of the celebrant(s) is merged. Mysticism tends to be an end in and of itself, whereas magic is a technical means to further the will of the magician. Sometimes, however, mystical techniques can be turned to magical ends. This happens when, for example, the magician sub-merges the will into an egregoric form in order to enhance the working of his or her own self-determined willed ends. To do this without being consumed by the egregore is, of course, one of the difficulties of magical work.

The Sacrament of Nativity (of new-boms) Not all of these sacraments are dispensed to, or used by, all grades within the FS. However, this is a fairly comprehensive list of the possible sacraments practiced by the order over the years. Within this structure there was at some time considered to be a set of Seven Sacraments of the Servants of Saturn (the Morning Star).17 These are: 1) Purification (baptism of fire and initiation into the Light [= 1 °]), 2) Confirma-tion (strengthening of faith in the Frater-grade), 3) Heptagathon (experience of brotherhood-agape), 4) Holy Sacrifice (communion), 5) Kiss of the Magician (out-pouring of Saturnian spirit through the kiss and laying-on of hands), 6) Eternal Bonding (blood-brother-hood with Saturn), and 7) Preservation (extreme unc-tion and funeral mass). Among the sacraments that deserve more ex-tended commentary are the Luciferian Mass and the various forms of the elemental eucharist or com-munion. The ninth sacrament is the Sacrament of Light or the Luciferian Mass.18 As we have already seen in Chapter 2, the FS holds Lucifer to be the higher octave of Saturn, and considers Lucifer to be the \"Good God\" who in the guise of the Serpent brought mankind the Divine Light. The ritual mass itself follows the liturgical form found in the Catholic church (which was ultimately taken from pre-Christian, pagan rituals). It has certain antinomian characteristics in common with the \"tra-ditional\" psychodramatic messe noir. Each element of"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 103 the mass formula is turned to a Luciferian end. The purpose of the rite is to celebrate and to commune with Lucifer as the Light of Reason. In this ritual the participants are supposed to be able to experience the transcendence of the Luciferian Light directly. This is said to be experienced through the actual emanation of the Light as it is manifested in each individual. As the self of the individual is transformed, he or she is able to experience this inherent and primeval dark light within. The chant heard during the rite is: \"Luxe tenebris lucet et luceatl\" (\"The Light shines out of the darkness and let it shine on!\"). It should be clear that the Lucifer of the FS is not identical to the medieval Christian notion of the Devil, although it must also be realized that the medieval image is seen as a largely misunderstood vision of the truth. The myth contained in the Book of Genesis is considered to be basically true in the cosmic events it recounts. However, the Serpent is seen as the bringer of knowledge [gnosis), and hence a force for true good, while the Creator-God is seen as a force of ignorance and fear. The FS consciously tries to think of this entity in pre-Christian or Gnostic terms, and tries to follow the concepts outlined by what they consider \"Luciferian Freemasons\" such as Albert Pike or Giosuè Carducci.19 The Saturnian concept of the eucharist is one that holds that absolute Divinity (which is bipolar in nature) is constantly \"sacrificing itself into matter\" in order to vivify matter. This act of sacrifice of self is what brought Divinity itself to a state of self-consciousness. Divinity continuously pours itself out to a state of"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"104 / Fire and Ice self-consciousness, in order to maintain the status quo of existence, but also in order to evolve itself. All acts of sacrifice on the part of magicians are understood in this context. All sacrifices are mutual ones in which the initiate sacrifices to Divinity and Divinity sac-rifices to the world of the initiate. Such rites are tradi-tionally thought to aid the absolute Divinity in its two main purposes of static maintenance and dynamic evolution.20 Technically, there are seven forms of elemental eucharists practiced with the FS liturgy.21 The eucharist of one element is contained in the so-called \"Baphomet Ritual,\" which corresponds to the eucharist of seven elements. The sacramental eucharist of two elements consists of bread and wine, in which the quantitative is transformed into the qualitative essence—the exoteric into the esoteric. A eucharist of three elements is based on the Indian doctrine of the three gunas: tamas = darkness - chaos rajas = activity - cosmos sattva = rest (being) - nirvana Three substances are used: a sedative, a stimulant, and a substance that \"corresponds to the Moon.\"22 The eucharist of four elements consists of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth—symbolized by flame, wine, incense (or roses) and bread and/or salt. A eucharist of five elements is provided by the tantric \"Five-Ms\" ritual fully outlined on p. 109. The eucharist of six elements is a pseudo-Christian one consisting of the trinity and breath, water, and blood. Finally, the eucharist of"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 105 seven elements is a rite of sexual magic (sometimes symbolically understood) connected to the Sacra-ment of the Grail. This ritual consists of the following steps: 1) The Holy Lance and Holy Grail are brought into the temple and placed upon the altar. 2) These objects are consecrated. 3) The egregore of the lodge is invoked—in this case the animus and anima mundi (\"spirit and soul of the world\"). 4) Magical sigils are traced over the Grail, which draws transcendental power into it. 5) Bread and wine are ritually transmuted and sacrificed. 6) Priest and priestess take communion. 7) Priest \"mixes the bread and wine\" to effect an epopteia. (This is done either symbolically, or it can be done according to tantric practice involv-ing the completion of an act of ritual coitus with the priestess.) 8) The circle is closed when the \"seven\" have become the \"one.\" Lodge Rites As can be seen, the full liturgy of the FS is a vast one. But many of its rites are based on the structural principles already outlined. In appendices A—D the complete rubrics of four major rituals to be performed in a full lodge setting are presented."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"106 / Fire and Ice In some ways the rituals are reminiscent of those printed by Francis King in The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O., but there are more significant differences than similarities. The rituals printed in this book are, for the most part, direct translations of actual FS documents. Be-cause these texts were created for initiates already familiar with standard magical, and FS, procedure, two important procedural clarifications are certainly in order. First, the complex sigils that on occasion appear in the texts are to be traced in the air in front of the speaker, using a magical weapon or the hand in the indicated gesture. These are to be traced with the utmost care and concentration, visualizing the shapes indicated as if traced in light in front of the magician. Another point is the frequent use of foreign and magi-cal languages in the texts of the rites. Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and \"barbarous\" mixtures and mod-ifications of these are apparent. Where the language is straightforward and natural (even if archaic or cor-rupt), translations are provided. But where the effect is apparently intended to be emotive and \"bar-barous,\" no translation is possible. A Note on \"Electrical Magic\" Certainly one of the most unique aspects of FS magical technology is (or was) its involvement with electrical instruments to enhance or to effect magical ends.23 This was part of a general field of interest"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"among initiates of the FS, a field which included the study of, and experimentation with, the magical effects of high-frequency sound, electromagnetic fields, so-called \"Tesla energy,\" ozonization of the atmosphere, ultraviolet light, etc. In the FS these theories were usually spoken of in connection with teachings con-cerning \"aethric waves,\" or the chakra system. This brought the discussion into a more \"traditional\" magical framework. Very little is explicitly outlined about these instruments. The best known of these instruments is the Tepaphone (German: Tepaphon). This is described at some length in Franz Bardon's magical autobiography Frabato,24 in which he recounts how it was used by the dreaded FOGG Lodge to kill its enemies or \"human sacrifices\" at a distance. Various theories surround how the Tepaphone was supposed to work. It is clear, however, that it was believed that the instrument could be used to load a person with vital odic force, or to draw this force from him/her, which would cause sickness and death. Grand Master Daniel experimented with a Tepa-phone made out of multiple optic lenses and a copper spiral consisting of twenty-four coils in the center of which was a copper plate. An image of a person could be placed beneath the lenses and in the stream of electrical current running through the instrument. This would eventually affect the person in some posi-tive or negative way. The spirals were tools for engag-ing the concentrated mental force of the operator or operators of the instrument so that they could guide its effects.

While this is largely true, it must be remembered that the sex-magical aspects are mainly concentrated in the work of one degree, the Pen-talphic (18°), and are not the raison d'etre of the order as a whole (as is the case with the O.T.O.). The Pentalphic rite—to which Francis King is able to allude in an obscure way—is fully reproduced in appendix D. Besides this lodge ritual, there are a wide variety of sex-magical operations that could be carried out between and among members of the FS. Many of these remained on a largely experimental basis. However, perhaps the most traditional rite of erotic magic taught in the FS curriculum is the so-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 109 called \"Five-M Rite,\" based on the procedures of Hindu tantra. This rite is also called the \"Sacrament of the Pentagram\" and is the same as the eucharist of five elements. Its purpose is to create living mental (or \"astral\") images (or psychogones) by means of con-centrating and directing sexual energies. A psy-chogone is a talismanic creature shaped and given life by the magical work of the magician(s). It has a mag-ically imparted \"soul,\" or psyche, but acts according to the willed directives of the creators as if it were an energy form. The Five-M Rite27 This rite is performed by male and female magicians who are bound to one another by a high level of erotic desire. The pair spend some time in sexual abstinence and in meditation before beginning the rite. 1) Preparation. The temple room is hung with black satin decorated with inverse silver pentagrams. The lodge apron worn during the ritual work is black with a gold or red pentagram (reversed). If each of the participants holds 18°, they wear the respective rings of the degree (described on p. 96 above). 2) Entry. The pair enter the temple room and step within a circle, in the middle of which is a low stool. The male magician (magus) sits on the stool, while the female (medium) crouches between his out-spread legs. 3) Charging. A parchment upon which are in-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"110 / Fire and Ice scribed the sigils of the psychogone which is to be evoked is laid on the floor between the \"magus\" and \"medium.\" This parchment is odically loaded by means of magnetic passes and rhythmic breathing techniques. This remains on the floor between the legs of the male. 4) Working. The female partner stands and lowers herself onto the erect penis of the male. They com-plete the act of ritual coitus with the male ejaculating into the vagina of the medium before her climax. After the orgasm of the female, she stands and allows the sperm and the collected, magically charged sexual fluids to fall upon the parchment. This parchment then becomes the focus for the development of a psy-chogonic entity— the purpose of and will of which is directed by the magicians. These four steps actually constitute only the lat-ter part of the complete \"Five-M Rite.\" Before partak-ing of this fifth \"M\"—Sanskrit maithuna (eros)—the magicians will have already partaken of the other four \"M's\": mansa (meat), matsya (fish), mudra (grain), and madya (wine or mead), in a ritual meal. The aim of this operation is similar to that of several others practiced by the FS: to create living entities that will do the bidding of a magician. This is something quite different from calling upon spirits, angels, or daemons to work for the magician, in that the psychogone is considered to have been created out of the magician's own energies (or out of the com-bined male and female essences). Another similar practice designed to create an astral entity or psychogone is called \"Astral Procrea-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Magical Work / 111 tion.\"28 The ritual procedure may be summarized as follows: 1) A male magician and a female medium enter a magical circle, closed by a pentagram and armed in the four cardinal points with four other inverse pen-tagrams. She lies face up on a bed or sofa. She is nude with her head toward the south. 2) The magician draws another inner magical circle around the medium and puts her into a deep magnetic trance. (The original FS documents suggest that drugs—an incense made of hashish, for example— might be helpful!) It is also noted that the room tem-perature should be very high. 3) The magician sits (in the lotus asana) to the right of the medium. He draws a small magical circle in front of himself and sprinkles seven drops of wine or other alcoholic spirit into the middle of the circle. By means of visualization, breathing and mantric techniques (using the u-vowel), the magician should evoke the image of the psychogone in the small circle. In the circle before him he then places a piece of parchment upon which are inscribed the sigils of the entity to be created. 4) With the left hand the magician strokes the medium's solar plexus (surya chakra), her heart region (anahata chakra), her sexual area (svadisthana chakra), and finally and most importantly her spleen region {chandara chakra).29 As he does this he draws out odic force from each of these centers and directs it through his body from his left hand to his right hand, which he is holding over the parchment in the small magical cir-cle in front of him. This force is projected in a contin-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"112 / Fire and Ice uous stream into the parchment. This whole cycle is carried out from seven to nine times. This can be accompanied by singing of mantras corresponding to the entity to be created. 5) The medium is then awakened from her mag-netic trance, and rises from her lying position. The magician sits on the edge of the bed or sofa with the circle and parchment between his legs. He pulls the medium toward him and onto his erect penis. They complete ritual coitus (as described on pp. 109-110 above). The charged sexual fluids that flow from the vagina after the act are mixed with an alcoholic spirit and used to soak the parchment. Also, three drops of the magician's blood, drawn from his Saturn (middle) finger, are added to the parchment. 6) The parchment is then dried over a brazier and the ceremony is closed. A pendulum is used to determine the presence and relative strength of the psychogone inhabiting the parchment. On Mondays and Fridays, both \"parents\" of the entity may direct more odic force to the entity— feeding it and making it stronger. This increasing strength can be monitored with the pendulum. The time during the full or waxing Moon is favor-able for producing friendly and beneficial psy-chogones, while during the time of the new or waning Moon dangerous and malevolent entities can be en-gendered. Also, with regard to the character of these entities, it is noted that although it is largely a matter of the magician's will and design, the basic character is also affected by the personality of its \"parents.\"30"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Figure 4.3: \"Astral Procreation'"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"114 / Fire and Ice Astrology and Sex-Magic The subject of the internal document translated in Francis King's Sexuality, Magic, and Perversion31 is the use of astrological data in the design of sex-magical practices. Since this has been translated in its entirety in that work, it serves no purpose to repro-duce it here. However, we will summarize its basic ideas. The major premise of this work is that astrologi-cal aspects (i.e., the angles by which planets are related to each other at a given time) are magically useful. It is stated that squares (90°) between the planets Venus, Mars, Neptune, and the Moon provide daemonic gateways to the psyche. Conjunctions can also be considered the equivalent of squares. These aspects and others discussed may be in effect at the time of a given working, or be in transit aspect to the planets in the natal chart of one or the other partner in a sex-magical operation. Astrological data of this kind is then used to determine which sexual partner is to be in a dominant position for the act of ritual coitus. If, for example, Venus is exalted in its zodiacal sign at the time of the operation, the woman takes the dominant position, while if Mars is similarly exalted the man is dominant. If Mars is square Venus the ritual coitus takes place in a sitting position; if the Moon is square Mars either partner can be dominant. The Moon square the Moon (in transit) indicates the favorability of a lesbian operation, while Mars square Mars denotes a male homosexual work. If Neptune is found in a square aspect with any of these planets, the use of drugs in"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"it is suggested that no sex-magical operations be undertaken. However, under these conditions the partners can engage in activities designed to heighten erotic tensions (but avoiding orgasm) in order to build to a more powerful ultimate act when conditions are more favorable. It is also noted that the trine aspect (at or near 120°) is useful when trying to conceive a child under magical conditions. This final point brings us to the conclusion of this discussion. As it is considered possible to create a psy-chogone, the physical focus of which is a piece of parchment, through an act of magical will, so too is it considered possible to focus a magical creation on a human zygote. This would result in the creation of a physical \"magical child,\" or \"moonchild.\"32 Figure 4.4: Arrangement for the sex-magical act of \"Astral Procreation.\" Magical Work / 115 the rite is favorably indicated.

I had little occasion for the language since 1902 and forgot much of what I knew. In 1925, I could un-derstand German only when spoken clearly and slowly with special consideration for the state of my knowl-edge and an occasional recourse to paraphrase. I could, however, follow the merits of German composition especially in the case of translations of my own work where I already knew the meaning. 165"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"166 / Fire and Ice I note these facts so that the investigator may form a clear idea of the value of my testimony in case it were my ability to understand is the question. I should, however, add that I have travelled a great deal in savage countries and accustomed myself to understand the gist of conversations in totally unknown languages and communicate with the natives by means of gestures. I have also devoted many laborious years of research to psychology. In the autumn of 1924, my then representative in America [C. Stansfield Jones] wrote to me that he had got in touch with a man called Heinrich Tränker whom he believed to be the true representative of the ancient Rosicrucian Brotherhood, adding that he was certainly in the possession of a certain secret science known to extremely few people [i.e. IX° O.T.O.]. He regarded this latter fact as certifying Tränker to be a man of proven honesty and ability. From the year 1898, I had myself been in touch with a body which claimed to derive its teachings proof has never been supplied. I wrote at once to Trän-ker asking him if he could furnish this proof and cer-tain other information on kindred subjects. I received answers voluminous indeed, but vague and evasive. I gathered, however, that the Proof re-quired was to be obtained at Tränker's headquarters. From the correspondence which ensued, I ob-tained the following main impressions: (1) That Tränker was a man of independent means and one who, if not actually, would have been so had"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Appendix E / 167 (5) That Tränker derived at least part of his authority from the late Theodore Reuss, known as Frater Merlin or Frater Peregrinus. (I had known Reuss and understood that he left Germany in consequence of a scandal connected with his Order. It would be too much of a digression to discuss the rights and wrongs of this matter, especially as my information of this matter is very imperfect and of doubtful value.) Only the last two of these assertions of Tränker proved in the end to have any basis in fact. He showed me documents signed by Reuss conferring upon him certain authority. This authority was formally valid tor me because whatever may have been the merits or demerits of Reuss personally, he was certainly in the possession of certain secrets. An analogous case would be that of a King of questionable kingliness, but who was without doubt the son of his father and the father of his son and as such an authentic monarch he not devoted his fortune unselfishly to the good of the Order. (2) This Order, with an inner circle of few but dis-tinguished names, international in scope, was work-ing openly in Germany under the title of Pansophia or Lodge of the Pansophic Orient, or some variants of this term.

He invited me to his house as a guest for the sum-mer. The main object of this was twofold. Firstly, various Brethren of the Order from many countries were to be invited to meet me there in order to acclaim me as the supreme authority on the planet. (This is explained and confirmed by Tränker's published statements in Pansophia Nos. 3, 4, and 7 and by various private letters.) The second object was to come to a closer agreement on various obscure points both of theory and practice and to work together at the issuing of my instructions as translated by Herrn Karl Germer. For various reasons these translations were not carefully examined after publication [in Pansophia] for some months, when it appeared that after Germer had passed the proofs for press, Tränker secretly altered them in all sorts of ways thereby completely destroying their value for representing my work. This barefaced outrage on hospitality and literary honesty and decency seems to show that he clearly contemplated an early breach of faith in any event; as his trickery was bound to be discovered sooner or later and was inexcusable. The hospitality of Heinrich Tränker was indeed of a singular kind. I personally would not have treated a dog as he treated me and my wife, both of us in poor health, after the first few weeks. In fact, immediately after the publication of No. 4 or 7 of Pansophia his manner markedly changed. There was practically"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Appendix E / 169 nothing for us to eat; while he and his wife devoured enormous meals secretly in the kitchen. On the question of motive I can only explain this conduct in one way. There was no quarrel of any kind, his manner was always that of deference and reverent affection, but he had succeeded in stealing as much of my work as he could and he had no further object in making life tolerable for me. During this period in the first few weeks of which he had treated me extremely well within the limits of his imagination which in that direction were not large, I had formulated certain proposals to which he agreed enthusiastically. Up to and including the time of what is here called the Hohenleuben Conference [else-where the Weida Conference] there was no difference of opinion between us on any but minute points, and these differences were commonly the result of misunder-standing owing to the language difficulty. Mr. Germer's tactful translation usually removed these obstacles at once. The increasing discomfort of life at Hohenleuben forced us to spend more and more of our time at Mr. Germer's house near Weida. My real conviction that Tränker was a common thief and swindler and therefore an imposter in his claim to represent the Brotherhood, was first implant-ed in me by my observation of his treatment of Herrn Hopfer. Cross examination of Germer made it clear to me that Tränker had deliberately set himself to de-fraud Germer. I must add that Germer was a most unwilling witness and defended Tränker's integrity with the greatest loyalty until the facts became too"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"170 / Fire and Ice strong for him and his eyes were opened. But even after that, his extraordinary nobility and generosity of character has hitherto prevented him from taking firm steps to recover the money stolen from him by means of false pretenses. This revelation has led immediately to the dis-closure of Tränker's motive in the incidents to be recounted in the following section of the statement. At the time of my arrival in Germany, Herr Ger¬ mer was seeking a divorce from his wife. They were, however, for convenience sake, both living in his house near Weida. On my first visit to Weida I caught a distant glimpse of Frau Germer in the garden. She was dressed in white and was walking swiftly into the woods beyond the front gate to call her mother to lunch. She gave the impression of remarkable grace, energy and buoyancy. I looked at Germer in the greatest surprise; he told me: \"That's my wife.\" I had been given to under-stand that she was a hopeless morphine addict and in an advanced state of diabetes. It was evident that any such story was sheer nonsense. (I studied medicine at Cambridge and Kings College Hospital [London] and have specialized in insanity and particularly drug neuroses.) [!] I asked Germer to present me to his wife saying that I was perfectly sure that their quarrel was a lover's tiff and that I could put things right between them in a few minutes.

I did not realize that he and his wife were not on speaking terms."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Appendix E / 171 Germer was very much impressed with this diag-nosis of morphinism and diabetes, quoting Tränker as his authority.

Nevertheless, on my return to Hohenleuben I brought up the question, and expressed an earnest hope that an early reconciliation might be possible. Tränker opposed any such idea, dilating at some length on Frau Germer's inveterate wickedness; but I cer-tainly found it strange in the following weeks that he should return to the subject again and again without provocation. In Germer's absence he would frequent-ly bring up the subject saying emphatically: \"Frau Germers Morphinism us\" with a knowing look, at the same time going through the motions of making a hypodermic injection. In this conduct there was nothing suspicious, be-cause no bad motive was apparent, it seemed merely eccentric. But as soon as it became clear that Tränker's only interest in Germer was to rob him of his last Pfennig, his whole plan became absolutely clear. Frau Germer, the woman of the world, the highly educated doctor of medicine, was just the one person he had to fear as capable of protecting her husband from his frauds. It will be seen from the varied incidents in the above statement that every action of Tränker becomes intelligible only on the hypothesis that he is perfectly unscrupulous, a cunning ignorant peasant, who is"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"174 / Fire and Ice functions in his office for a legislative period of three years.

The Brotherhood relies upon the personal intui-tion of the leading Brethren and tries—by magical ceremonies and holy traditional rituals—to focus itself upon the higher octave of Saturn as aspired to in esoteric astrology and religious philosophy. Saturn as the Guardian of the Threshold, as the highest planetary intelligence of this solar system, is considered the spiritual leader. We endeavor to per-ceive the planetary vibration of his higher octave. On the exoteric plane the execution of this cult must be carried out accompanied by a certain exclu-sion of base humanity, and by an aspiration toward an individual and psychic solitude, by a deepening of the whole of exacting, spiritually based knowledge, by a maturing of the inner Man [Menschtum], by simple deepening of cosmic contact with the higher spheres, and through harmony with the infinite con-ception of God. The Brotherhood itself—containing seeking, ser-ious men—is to be a refuge and a retreat for seekers, borne by true fraternity.

A survey of the entire contents of this work shows that the order actually has a broader base than that, but that nevertheless the magical symbolism of human sexuality for cosmological workings is essen-tial. Although the early FS procedures often took a simplistic \"recipe\" approach to the practice of sexual magic, there was also always a pragmatic, experimen-tal edge to its work. (Remember, the FS and modern sexology arose in the same environment.) A current senior initiate of the FS, wrote a manual of sexual magic that is generally pragmatic in its approach. But a coherent, enlightened, and fully pragmatic manual is not yet available. This appendix is intended to provide some pragmatic instructions on 185"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"186 / Fire and Ice the practice of sexual magic as free as possible from the lore and doctrines of specific schools and sects, so that more persons can more easily make use of the basic formulas discussed in FS or any other material. It will come as no shock or surprise if I say that human sexuality is a subject long surrounded by layers of ignorance and misconception. These layers are generated as much by religious bigots of the Judeo-Christian tradition as by the often equally narrow clinical proponents of the therapeutic state. It may even be that the latter are more dangerous to the will of the magician, because they are generally thought to be more credible. The pragmatic sexual magician must first learn to know him- or herself in the depth and breadth or his or her sexuality. This is the first chapter in any true grimoire of sexual magic. Here the true keys are provided. In culturally specific doctrines of sexual magic, such as that generated out of the Tantric traditions of India or perhaps those with their origins in Arabic tradition, the magician must deal with historically and culturally conditioned proscriptions and prescrip-tions. These may have a useful religious function, but magically they are probably without value. In traditional historical sex magic, as it has been filtered into the \"Western magical tradition,\" there seems to have been the common belief in the notion that the sexual fluids contain/are a power which can be manipulated by the will of the magician. One tra-ditional approach would have the practitioner always turn the flow of this power inward (sublimating and \"elevating\" the power within the self), while another"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Appendix I / 187 would have the practitioner project this fluid/power outside to be manipulated as are other magical sub-stances and symbols. These two approaches are usually tangled up with moral and religious dogmas concerning \"good\" and \"evil\" and the Right- or Left-Hand Path. The distinctions will always be dependent upon who is doing the defining at the moment. To the pragmatic sexual magician the uses of these two pathways along which sexual power can be directed should be obvious: that which is projected outward has (direct) effect in the objective world, while that which is projected inward has (direct) effect on the subjective world. This is viewed from the standpoint of technique only. In practice the magician can use subjective directives to have ultimate objec-tive effects, and the reverse is equally true. From a pragmatic viewpoint the central fact surrounding sexual magic is that it works on the basis of sexual energy or arousal. The higher the level of sexual excitement, the higher the level of energy avail-able to the magician. In observing \"traditional\" forms of sexual magic it is usually found that what seems to be exotic and \"deeply religious\" is in fact a reflection of the forbidden and/or \"fetishistic\" in the given culture. Again from a pragmatic viewpoint the central event in the performance of sexual magic is the orgasm (or sublimation of it). If we assume that every object or event outside the will and consciousness of the magician is a candidate for being used as a magical tool (be it the sight of a sigil, the feel of a wand in the hand, or the smell of incense), then we must grant that the orgasm and sensations and events (subjective and"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"188 / Fire and Ice objective) leading up to and triggering it are among the most powerful and universal available to any magician. Here the orgasm has at least two levels of meaning. First, it is a physiological, and hence psychological, mechanism of energy release. (The magical value of this alone is very great.) Second, and more importantly, it is a manifold and multifaceted magical-symbolic \"substance\" in the form of a powerful sensation. This, like the ink used to make a magical sigil, can be formed in any \"shape\" and bent to any purpose the magician wills. In the actual practice of sexual magic the magi-cian must first explore all of the ways in which sexual energy can most powerfully be raised within him- or herself. The more ways this can be done the better, and the more intense the desires and arousal possible the better. Pragmatically, this is just saying: \"These are the variety of levels and qualities of potentially magical energies I have at my disposal.\" Once this aspect of magical research has been explored suf-ficiently—which may have already been virtually completed by imaginative sixteen-year-olds—then comes the practice of harnessing and controlling these forces. This is done by manipulating the orgasm in every way. The most useful exercise involves bringing one's self to the brink of orgasm as many times as pos-sible and retreating from that point, while remaining in a state of sexual arousal. But all other practices are also to be engaged in: see how quickly orgasm can be reached, see how many orgasms you can have in a cer-tain span of time (in an hour, two hours, etc.), refrain-ing from sexual activity for certain lengths of time (a"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Appendix I / 189 day, a week, etc.). But all of this hard work will go for nothing if one does not put it in the context of general magical training in concentration, visualization and strengthening of the will. The actual performance of practical sex-magical rituals should also be approached on an experimental basis at first. Dabbling in the recipes of this, that or the other sect can be helpful as long as it is approached with an experimental attitude. The following formula and variations could form the framework for many such experiments. (1) Preparation. One should always have a specific magical goal in mind before undertaking a working experiment. Before the rite all preparations proper to the working should be taken care of: the aim clarified and made unambiguous, symbols and procedure fixed and made ready. It is useful to have some standard (even if only to yourself) way of engaging in magical work. Some use the Ritual of the Pentagram, while others use other devices to gain a sense of magical orientation. Once ritual space/time has been entered and all other magical preparations have been com-pleted, the working of sex-magic itself can begin. (2) Intensification. The pragmatic magician will use whatever means at his or her disposal to intensify and build sexual excitement and energy. The primary directive at this point is the intensification of this energy by whatever means. The magical focus of the working will hover in the consciousness, and be ready for implementation at the magically proper time. During this intensification phase the magician can let his or her consciousness oscillate between the erotic focus"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"190 / Fire and Ice and the magical focus (assuming there is a distinction between the two!). (3) Release. Once this energy has been built up to the level desired it is to be \"released\"toward its magi-cal aim to do its work. This may come in the form of orgasm or in the form of a sublimation or \"swallow-ing\" of the orgasm. In either case, a sense of satisfac-tion or completion will be the sign of a successful \"release.\" The subtle and symbolic preparations will ensure as much as possible that that which is released will find its willed target. The actual release is a highly concentrated event of intense power. The magician's task is to have the concentrated magical aim attached to this event. (4) Break. As soon after the release of the \"energy\" as possible, the magician should make a psychological break with the magical aim of the working. Attach-ment of the aim at this point will perhaps keep those subtle, even in part unconscious, parts of the process from working as they can. In this regard, the sexual atmosphere and feelings can again be pressed into ser-vice as a pleasurable diversion, as the formal part of the ritual is ended. These pragmatic suggestions can in some be used to help magically unravel what is really occurring in the sex-magical rites of not only the FS, but other sim-ilar orders and sects as well.

An alternate system, also made popular through publication, is that presented by Louis T. Culling, A Manual of Sex Magick (St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1971).
