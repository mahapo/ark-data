[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temple of SetResources Directory- as of March 16, 2003 -_____________________IntroductionIncluded in this directory are names, addresses, and descriptions of retail establishments which deal, by mail-order and/or over-the-counter, in books, publications, and ceremonial equipment which may be useful to Setians - particularly those who cannot find such facilities in their home areas.This directory is provided as a convenience to Setians, and is not paid advertising by the establishments included. Information from this directory should not be reproduced or released outside the Temple in whole or in part.The Resource Directory consists of a series of individual entries for each establishment. Completely-updated directories are provided with each new Crystal Tablet, and are also immediately available to all Setians on the Intranet.The inclusion of an establishment in this directory does not imply endorsement by the Temple of Set [nor endorsement of the Temple by that establishment], and the Temple assumes no liability for orders placed. On the other hand, we are interested in the experiences of Setians who have commercial dealings with any of these establishments. If an establishment renders exceptional service, we will annotate the directory accordingly. If we receive reports of significant customer dissatisfaction, we will remove the establishment in question from the directory.Adding or Updating an EntryTo recommend an establishment known to you for inclusion in this Directory, or to recommend updates/corrections to an entry, please email/pmail the Executive Director [with copy to the High Priest] with the appropriate information. Provide as much of the information contained in the standard Directory datafields (indicated on this printout) as possible.The directory emphasizes but is not limited to publications and magical equipment dealers. If you know of some other kind of legitimate business establishment in which you think Setians might be particularly interested, let us know.If you know of a change in the business involved, such as a change of address, please let us know.If you are recommending a business with which you are familiar, please consider asking it whether it would be willing to give Setians a discount (for example 10%) when they identify themselves as such during an order. Point out that this would be mentioned in our Directory and might accordingly promote additional business.The success and usefulness of this directory depends upon your input to it. The more such outlets are publicized to Setians, the more we can secure the most desirable publications and equipment at the best prices. Please share your discoveries and your experiences."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NAME: 12th House Arts & Publishing *** UPDATED: 20030301PROPRIETOR: Ms. Ruth A.
