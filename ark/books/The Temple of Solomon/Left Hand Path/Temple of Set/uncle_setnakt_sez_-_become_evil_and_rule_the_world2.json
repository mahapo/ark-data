[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Become Evil and Rule the World:2Don WebbMay all the readers of Brimstone enjoy a gladsome Yule! May those that live bythe watchword of Indulgence find joy in the succulent meats, candies, andcookies as well as the revelry of New Year's Eve! May those that live by thewatchword of Xeper exalt in these things and in the dark Work of Yuletide! HailYear XXV!Now concerning the task of becoming Evil and ruling the world:1. Control daydreams. Encourage people to live in their daydreams. Tell themthey may become great writers, painters, hunters, etc. Fantasy is the mostintoxicating drug. If you become their pusher, they need you. As a BlackMagician, you must tone down (or eliminate) your own daydreaming. Setextraordinary goals for yourself. As you achieve real goals and put asideintoxicating fantasy, you will become aware of new things. Just as the drug addictis unaware of the physical world around him, the daydreamer is unaware of thespiritual realities surrounding him.In White Light religions, you're supposed to pray first and then hope big G willsend you things. In the Left Hand Path, you must achieve your goals on yourown. As you achieve them -- as you become yourself -- only then can you feelthe presence of other intelligences that have separated themselves from theuniverse.2. Create your own goals. Some people join the Left Hand Path to learn LesserBlack Magic to gather all the status tokens of the American dream. Others pourthemselves into Greater Black Magic to become some muddy-thinking occultists.These people try and try, but all they're practicing is White Magic -- the art oftransforming yourself into one of the herd. Consider the true Black Magician.She's always wanted to be that vampire she saw on a movie when she was five.She uses strategy and reason in her LBM. She gets enough money to drivearound in her Black Massarati. She learns the cosmetic arts to shape herself toher true form. She moves in a sea of elegance and desire.The great American dream? No. A nut at the crystal counter? No. She hasbecome herself. If she worked with an initiatory society, she didn't becomeinvolved in its politics. She didn't try to conform to nonexistent rules. Shebecomes herself and then she's ready for GBM. She invokes the vampire withinher. If she accomplishes this carefully chosen goal, then the Lord of Darknessmay dwell within her. The lady vampire in the movie? No, it wasn't an outsidegoal she fixated on. It was a touch from her future self. We are Gods after all.Don't look for omens -- you only recognize them long afterwards.3. Personalize your magic. White Magic insists on repetitions. You say this, do"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that, breathe this way. In Black Magic, we move toward our own godhood. This isa harder path. We actively use our own memories and moods in the ritualchamber. This is not to be confused with introspection or simple moments ofreligious ecstasy. We refine and use our moods deliberately. They are just asconcrete as swords, bells, incense, etc. and much more powerful. But like tools,we pick up our moods and use them and put them away. Since Black Magicrequires a tremendous self awareness, it is not for psychotics or weak-willedindividuals. We do not deny that unaware individuals may achieve great sorcery,but they will never achieve godhood. When you find those moments that you trulyare, you have a glimpse of godhood. Awareness first, then Magic.4. Satanism has comon aspects with feminism. Both insist on politics of thepersonal. Both grew from the philosophical cauldron of the sixties. They brokefrom the institutionalized dialectic of America. Party one says these are theissues, and here's how we solve them. Party two says yep, that those are theissues, and here's how we solve them. Satanism and feminism said no. Theimportant issues are things that society doesn't talk about. Freedom begins withmy body. Freedom begins here with my mind. Feminist work centered on bodyand sexual freedom. (It saddens me that many feminists have internalized thepaternalistic concept of Virginity rather than the liberationist perspective ofexploration. Uncle Setnakt tips his horns to liberating feminists, Anne Rice andKathy Acker.) Satanism centered on the freedom of desire and thought. Theword Indulgence brought about a reversal of morality. We could seek out allthose things denied us by Christ and Freud. We no longer hid our fetishes -- weflaunted them. We could even admit to greed (note how deeply the word ofIndulgence has penetrated our society -- evangelists now preach the love ofmoney, no doubt to the puzzlement of the pale Nazarene). But we escaped fromthe trap of being a simple antithesis to Judeo-Christianity; in X we received theword of Xeper. We now go beyond external systems of good and evil. Just as ourfeminist sisters are beginning to achieve freedom of their bodies, we areachieving freedom of our whole being.5. Satanism has common aspects with Situationism. The criticism of theFrench New Left has begun to ask, What is the self in a commodified economy?What are we in a society which attempts to buy, sell, and (above all) packageeverything? A world in which quantity has replaced quality and advertising hasreplaced thought is antithetical to coming-into -being. The Situationist approachhas been a duality -- the inner life of the individual must become her own work ofart, the outer work becomes an endless act of criticism -- decoding anddeconstructing everything for its hidden texts. Whereas the Satanist mustbecome aware of hidden texts, the ceaseless mental masturbation ofdeconstructionism is merely another trap. The Satanist does pursue the innerwork of making his life a work of art. But the Satanist does not waste timecriticizing/deconstructing society; instead she imposes an order on the economyof signs. She takes what she will for her own life and co-opts society's packagesfor the purpose of control. Anton LaVey once remarked that the truly Satanicsociety could be symbolized by a shiny Duesenberg parked at the curb"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"surrounded by twenty admirers. The car has more life than its fans. Anton didn'tgo far enough -- only if the car is owned by a Satanist who is co-optingits fame for his own use is it a truly Satanic society. Both Satanism andSituationism are grounded in semiotics, but Satanism alone goes beyond thecriticism of society to the imposition of our own order upon it.6. Satanism shares some aspects with Nazism. Both contain the notion of anelite which energize and direct the masses. Both are frank about the power ofDarkness and the stimulation of dark images. Both draw power from the distantpast and the far future. Both are committed to the ideal of speeding massevolution by speeding individual evolution. Where the Nazis went wrong wasturning their dynamism against the life forces of others. Satanists consider lifeforce as a precious resource. (By the way, if you hear of any group sacrificinganimals or humans, they are not Satanists. If you live by -- or aspire to live by--Satanic ideals, make sure you contact the correct authorities.) Satanism andNazism release tremendous forces within their elite (and in the masses).Consider impoverished post-WWI Germany, which rose from its ashes under thedynamism of Nazism. Consider how the German rocket movement lives on.There's a pure example of lifeforce worship. The desire to push ourselves furtherand further into the great Dark. Both Satanism and Nazism push at the individual;however, Satanism has replaced the destructive hatred of Nazism with the pureblack light of challenge.7. Learn how to use the external nervous system. We have an opportunity asBlack Magicians which generations of our kind would've given up their familiarsfor. An electronic net of TV, fax machines, personal computers, telephones,radios cover the world as never before. This presents the Black Magician with aone-to-one and a one-to-many chance to exercise his magic. The personalcomputer (plus a modem and telephone) enables us to work one -on-one beyondspatial and temporal limits. New Age buffoons are trying to get information fromtheir \"channels\" -- we can exchange information instantly. If I'm designing a ritualinvolving a strobe light and I want to know what Hz to set the light at, I can dial upa neurophysiologist Black Magician colleague. He'll tell me 6.66 Hz will induce astate between alpha and theta rhythms. The personal computer allowsnetworking -- the elect can exchange its knowledge under the noses of theprofane. Perhaps more than any other piece of technology, the personalcomputer is an external manifestation of the word of Xeper. In addition to one -toonenetworking, one -to-many communications provides an opportunity for largescaleLBM. The Satanic potentials of TV and film are only beginning to beexplored. We can illuminate or control. We could even create new archetypes. Iam sure as the words of Indulgence and Xeper reach more individuals, we'll seemany more Satanists following the lead of my nephew, the Daemon Egan.Human society is providing a nervous system -- it's up to us to provide a brain.8. Learn to be gentle with yourself. The word of Indulgence teaches us theimportance of ourselves. It reflects both delight and reason. We must fill our liveswith our own comforts. Not as hermitages, but as places of strength. As we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"progress we will encounter more and more resistance from the profane world. Ifwe fail to make our lives places of beauty, we will wither under the pressure ofprofane life. Since we are the one-eyed men in the kingdom of the blind, we musttake time to fill our lives with paintings and parks. It is not enough to becomeawake in a world of zombies, we must take responsibility for our enjoyment insuch a world.9. Learn to make the gesture of support. We are not under the commands ofthe Right Hand Path to love everyone. Black Magicians are by natureindividualists. However, if we are to become aware of our own natures, we mustlearn to recognize the Satanic in others. Whenever we see the sparks of theBlack Flame stirring in another breast, we must make a gesture of support. Wecan give a book, or have a talk, or best yet challenge by example. We don'tproselytize or interfere in the fates of those struggling to awareness, but we'vegot to let them know that awareness is out there. That it is possible to be aseparate intelligence. As we grow in power and knowledge we may even fan theBlack Flame in others through lasting works of art and communication. BlackMagicians are -- for the most part -- a solitary lot. That we find friendship (andeven love) along a path which emphasizes individuality over all is truly a mystery.But we are the keepers of mystery and the administrators of the Dark Estate.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
