[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Understanding DarknessDon WebbUncle Setnakt would like to share with you a few exercises you can do withDarkness.1. Close your eyes. Inside this Darkness, you can picture anything. Conjure upthe notion of an extraterrestrial invader. One entirely of your own making. Thefact you can visualize this here-to-fore nonexistent object shows that yourawareness is not bound to, nor constrained by, the natural order. The knowledgethat your stand separate from the universe is the beginning of the Left HandPath.2. Look at the stars. Find a grassy hill and look up at the stars on a warm, clearmoonless night. Relax and let your mind soar towards the stars. That feeling offalling up into the Abyss of Stars is a predictable part of your natural self. Thedesire to project your psyche to its utmost limits is one of the forces that drivesthe Initiate along the Left Hand Path. It is why we choose role models like Set,the first historic example of the rebel against cosmic injustice.3. Sit quietly in a darkened room. Find a place away from radio, TV, family etc.Here alone and away from a constant stream of messages telling you what tothink, just relax and see where your own thoughts go. Don't try to interfere. Thismay be the first time you've heard your own voice. When you've done this for afew minutes, light a candle and write down three things -- the thought thatsurprised you the most, the desire that appeared most often in your thoughts,and the thought from somewhere else (advertising jingle etc.) that intruded themost. The next day search out the source of the unusual thought - - this bringsyour actions in line with your godhood. Do something that distances you from theunwanted mind control (even if it's just being aware of it and rejecting it) – thisbrings you closer to controlling your own mind.4. Make a list of associations. Write down all the things that Darkness implies.Start with personal things like, \"Darkness is excitement -- Father Christmasbrings me goodies in the dark. Darkness is the time of transformation – manytimes has my mind made monsters out of the pile of laundry at the foot of thebed. Darkness is the time of sexual arousal --etc.\" Then add historical meaningsof Darkness, \"Darkness plus the sound of the bullroarer creates the sacred spacefor Aboriginal initiation. Darkness is the time when Vampyres are said to roam.Etc.\"When you've made your list consider what the Prince of Darkness can mean asmodel for your own Initiation. Consider how these things stimulate yourimagination and will."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"5. Make of Night a personal symbol. It is in the nature of mankind to assignmeaning to events in the meaningless natural order. They fashion constellations,omens, etc. and then bend themselves to their creations. The Black Magiciancan consciously assign a symbol to an operation and use that symbol for his/herown growth -- and discard it when necessary. Since night is the traditional timefor Satanic/Black Magical activity, you may wish to invest it with meaning. Hold aritual that places a certain meaning in the dark of night -- so that its coming willbegin to Work your soul automatically. I choose, \"Night is a time of rebirth.\" Thisway, the non-ego parts of mySelf begin to recharge the batteries of inspirationand magic every time the sky darkens. If I am doing some other kind of Work aspart of my life work of Becoming, I can choose another meaning.6. Seek out the Brothers of Darkness. Learning the art of magic goes a hell ofa lot swifter if you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You'll accomplish your goalsfaster if you're drawing on the experience of others. It's a lot easier Working withpeople who think the way you do.Look around for a group whose approach to Darkness is the same or very similarto yours. If the group has been around for a few years, you have the additionalbenefit that some of their magic has already Worked itself into the fabric of theobjective universe and you have a greater magical lever to use for your ownWork. Uncle Setnakt is, of course, a proud member of the Temple of Set.7. Contemplate Darkness as a place of growth. In the soulcraft of the ancientGermanic peoples is a concept very useful to the Left Hand Path. The Sal is thatpart of the soul into which one evolves. It is a holder of potential, a dark vesselthat cannot be filled. By using this imagery life is not a simple discovery of theself, but an active creation that may be consciously drafted. As long as there isDarkness, one can grow -- there are no limits except those you consciouslycreate. If you become aware of this Dark container within you, it can becomemore than a mere symbol, but an actual vessel for awareness to survive afterdeath.8. Contemplate Darkness as a symbol of mystery. In the Right Hand Path,white light is used as a symbol of Initiation. In the light everything is quicklyrevealed and the self extinguishes itself because of boredom. There are nomysteries, nothing to discover, and ultimately nothing to think about since there isa total unity between the perceiver and the perceived. In the Left Hand PathDarkness is the symbol of mystery. By accepting Darkness, you acceptdynamism -- you don't know what lies within your Black Heart. And as youdiscover more and more; the desires from within cause you to act to bring yourdeepest Self into Being in the objective world.In short as you become the Self created god, you must create creations.Ultimately you will begin to have a sense of the great twofold secret -- one pole ofwhich lies deep within yourSelf -- the other is hidden deeply within the objectiveuniverse."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"9. Seek to unleash the Darkness in others. Look for and strengthen themanifestations of Darkness in those around you. This should be done very gentlyand with great forethought. After you have begun to master steps 7 and 8 aboveconsider that Darkness also resides in the other human beings around you. If youcan transmit some of that excitement and potential for awareness into others –not only will you have made the world a more darkly resplendent place to live, butyou will have opened up the world around you for more exciting potentials foryour own growth.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
