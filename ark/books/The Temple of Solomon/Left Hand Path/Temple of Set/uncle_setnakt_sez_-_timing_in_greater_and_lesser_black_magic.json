When you need to establish yourself as a control figure, arrive early. Itmay seem boorish, but if you help the host do the set up, you can greet eachnewcomer with phrases like, \"we have decided to\" or \"We were just talkingabout\" -- this set you up as being a member of the Inner Circle and also lets youset the agenda for the evening.2. When you need to discover the true leaders of a group, arrive late. Simplyask a few people what you've missed. If anything has been said rather than theirsimple human venting of hot air, they'll point it out not only with their words butwith their to ne and body language. This will also let you know what their feelingsare about the current string of topics. People find it very hard to be neutral whensomeone whispers to them and acts sheepish about being late. This mode ofinteraction automatically puts them into conspiratorial mode.Be sure to reward your best sources by telling them how perceptive they are.Some people's self importance comes entirely from their ability to pass onsecrets. Use them.3. When you have an agenda to pass on to your business, pick a time whenyour co-workers are sleepy. When I want to get something started at work --rather than brainstorm on a topic, I schedule my meetings after lunch, in a slightlytoo warm conference room (if it has flickering fluorescent lighting this is a plus).People are full and sleepy. They want the meeting to be over, and if I talksmoothly, distinctly, and in three quarters time they absorb my suggestions asthough I've hypnotized them. Which in fact I have. If you need to judge threequarters time, practice doing Dracula's lines from Lugosi movie -- but lose theaccent.4. If you want to gain more Self knowledge, occasionally radically alter youbiological rhythms. Sleep, food and sex are the keys here. Take a nap in theafternoon (if you already don't) and be sure and record the strange dreams thatcome in your dream diary. Fast until you feel deliciously faint, and see how yourconsciousness both is and is not a product of your body. Have sex much more ina single session than you do normally and study the powerful lucidity thatexhaustion brings. Abstain from sex until you become a walking flame of desire.These exercises will tell you more about yourself than any number of Cabalatextbooks. An important thing here -- while recording these exercises in yourmagical diary, do not tell anyone else about them (they may notice the behaviour-- particularly the sex), but keep them quiet. You will also begin to see the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"arbitrary nature of the world and this experiential insight will strengthen yourGreater Black Magic and your Becoming.5. If you want to train will, test your concentration against the clock. Likethe athlete trains his body, the magician must train his psyche. Many beginnersfind that they cannot concentrate for more than seconds at a time. They perceivethis as a failure rather than the natural outcome of societal training (docilesheeple aren't supposed to concentrate). A simple and powerful exercise is to putaside nine minutes a day to meditate on projecting your godhood from the realmof Being into the realm of Becoming. During this active meditation hold a longleather thong with a few beads on it. Every time you find that your concentrationhas wandered, move a bead from one end to the other. Don't nag yourself, justreturn to the process. At the end of the exercise note in your magical diary howmany beads you've had to move. In a short time you'll find that you're movingfewer and fewer beads.6. If you want to master your mind, make clocks work for you. Most of thetime our consciousness is purely reactive. We see something and think about itin the shallowest way possible. The Black Magician needs to train his mind tomove him toward alertness and control. Paradoxically the use of an arbitrarysymbol to remind us to awaken is one of the best ways to move toward an alertstate. Just as we use an alarm lock to end physical sleep, we can use a regularclock to move us toward consciousness.Pick a time that you will think about a certain topic, such as, \" Tomorrow at threeo'clock I will inventory my life to see how well I am using Indulgence as awatchword in my life.\" Learning how to program your thought paths in advance isexcellent magical training. It makes you the master of your subjective universe aswell as making you constantly aware of your efforts in the objective universe.This exercise will change you from an animal reactive state into a godlikecontrolling state – as well as reminding you of yo ur inner-directed priorities soyou can change your actions in order to be more in line with what is trulyimportant. As with all training, be gentle with yourself -- persist but don't castigateyourself at early failures. You've got a lifetime of sleepwalking to overcome.7. If you want to gain mastery over the world, affirm your good timing.Affirmations are the simplest way to make an operant change in yourconsciousness. By telling yourSelf that something is good, pleasurable, etc. yourmagical self will begin to alter itself and the world to bring about this good thing.So the next time you arrive at a shop exactly the right moment, or run into afriend on the street, or any piece of really good timing comes your way – tellyourself, \"I the Great God N. have given myself this pleasant gift through mymastery of time.\" Eventually the missed moment, the awkward scramble to getsomewhere, becomes a thing of the past.8. If you want to make lasting change in the minds of men, learn to observethe times. Study the lives of Satanic masters like Zaharoff, Rasputin, Cagliostro,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rosenburg, von List, the brothers Grimm. How was the perfect historical timingthe key to the changes that each of these flock have Worked upon humanconsciousness? Contrast them with other figures in history that had the rightidea, but expressed it at the wrong time.Learn to be patient and vigilant -- coiled like a snake ready to spring. Sayingsomething too early just to prove you're clever may give you an instantgratification, but preparing your ground is the key to a good harvest. This tip is astrue for influencing one individual as it is for the mass of humanity as a whole.9. If you wish to have fulfilment in both this life and beyond, make a lifeplan. There is a secret teaching among the Gurdjieffians that different types ofWork must be done at different times. This reflects changes in the body and thechanges wrought by the growing articulation of the psyche as a separate entityfrom the natural order (initiation).Although you should change your life plan as your vision changes, you shouldbegin to study the lives of geniuses to see what sort of Work the different ages ofa man are best suited for. When did the great writers write their great books,when did great religious leaders do their work, when did politicians do their beststatecraft? Couple this study with the study of role models and you will learnwhen it is easier to effect certain changes in your self and the world. Also if youcan find a group of likeminded individuals -- you can observe how the processesof maturation and individuation effects their magical/philosophical progress andskills.Lives of increased excellence and power are not accidents.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
