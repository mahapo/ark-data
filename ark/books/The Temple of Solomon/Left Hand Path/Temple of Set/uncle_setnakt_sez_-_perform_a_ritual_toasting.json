[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Perform a Ritual ToastingDon WebbThe spring is upon us. Uncle Setnakt's yard is yellow with daffodils and fragrantwith hyacinths. Uncles Setnakt is in a generous mood and has decided to giveyou a seven-step ritual (in honor of the seven heads of the first beast), whichmust be performed exactly at midnight on the Wednesday /Thursday cusp or -- ofcourse anytime you feel like it. I'll round out my column with a couple of remarksabout the rite (in honour of the two eyebrows -- ahem horns of the SecondBeast). This rite may be done alone or by a group. If by a group, each participantmust take part in each round of toasts -- NO PASSING!1. Prepare your chamber. The preparation of a sacred space sets up all themoods and expectations you want for Self-exploration and Magic. If you reuse achamber often, the mere entering of it can put you in a state of communicationwith yourSelf and -- perhaps -- the Unknown that lies beyond. For communicationwith the Prince of Darkness, the creator of isolate intelligence, the chambershould be dark, display His Pentagram (the Kaliyuga Productions Pentagram willdo excellently if like Uncle Setnakt you can't paint your own), and those ritualtools you deem necessary. You'll also need a quantity of sweet liquid (UncleSetnakt recommends water with a little honey -- this mixture may touch off somedim ancestral memories indeed considering that the roots of the words\"mead\"and \"soma\" both mean honeyed water). The chamber should be quiet andout of the way, so you can relax, calmly listen to yourSelf.2. Prepare yourself. Read through this article and be sure you've found theinternal and external facts you'll need. Dress for the occasion, whether it is ritualrobes or just a black tasteful suit, you are going to honor the highest part ofyourSelf! Your attitude and demeanor should be one of solemn joy! Don'tapproach this rite until you are both prideful and joyful. When you enter thechamber, remain in darkness and silence for a while, until your mind is workingsmoothly and the rite can flow out of you freely.3. Begin in your standard manner. Ritual openings improve with time and use,you don't have to cut new channels to the Unknown every time you work. Forthose of you who are trying to reinvent the wheel, I recommend the ringing of abell nine times and an invocation to the Prince of Darkness.An invocation in which your Will joins with His to Work a change in the world -- tobreak the fetters which bind us to the natural order and increase the developmentof mankind's evolution and consciousness as well as your personal joy andpower. An invocation is not a prayer -- it is the causing of that noble part ofyourSelf to rise to the surface and seek out alliances with those of its own kind.None of this \"Grant me this\" or \"please send me so-and-so.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4. Drink in a principle or god you'll need for step 6. This continues theprinciple of invocation. If you wish to effect a Work in the world that requires --let's say the use of words -- you may wish to say something like, \"I raise mydrinking horn to Wodenhaz, who through sacrifice of Self brought us the runes bywhich we may change the wyrd of the world through our writing.\" Drink deeplyand Become Wodenhaz. If you prefer not to use the stimulation of mythology youmight simply invoke a principle -- as in, \"I drink to Communication through which Icast my Will upon other men and by which I establish a link with the other secretside of the Universe.\"5. Drink to a human you wish to honor. This continues the principle ofinvocation as well as forging links between the living and the dead (if you'vechosen a dead hero to honor) or between the Work you are doing and a livingforce in the objective universe. This reminds us that \"Man is God\" and keeps usfrom becoming hopeless cynics. The Hero chosen for this honor should bepicked by the most personal of standards. It could be your father, or an Egyptianpharaoh of the XXth dynasty. If it's someone you don't know personally, researchyour guy (or gal). This will acquaint you with the possibilities in the human psycheas well as the combination of method and persistence needed to achievegreatness.Here's an example, \"I drink to Howard Phillips Lovecraft, who remained true tothe weird vision he created, and brought it forth in his own work and others that itmight work upon the collective unconsciousness of mankind forever.\"6. Drink to your own accomplishment. Now you are beginning to weaveyourSelf into this strand. This accomplishes three things. First it helps youbecome prideful of real accomplishments. In our society, we are taught not totake any pride in what we do -- the \"Aw shucks\" attitude. This fetters us to a stateof unworthiness as well as preventing us from expecting to achieve greatness.Pride is the breaker of that fetter. Second it makes us aware of the force of ourBecoming, this is an important step in the LHP -- seeing yourSelf first as a tinystream cutting your way through the world, but growing into a vast river thatreshapes the land. We discover that our life has purpose and meaning and thatSelf doesn't flair up in random incidents, but is an unbroken continuum. Third toprepare for this toast you must examine you own life looking for objectiveachievements. This leads to Self knowledge, one of the principle roots ofpersonal immortality. An example would be, \"I drink to Setnakt, who cast theRunes into BRIMSTONE so that others may use them for the brilliance and gloryof their desire and to His eternal glory.\"7. Drink a pledge to yourSelf of a deed to be done. Herein lies the magic ofthis rite, through the great exaltation/invocation which you have just done, you'vereached a state of changing that which is coming into being. By stating the deedyou intend to accomplish, you are bringing to bear the very force you haveinvoked against the resistance of the world in the direction of your goal. This goalshould be a real measurable goal that furthers your Being. This isn't praying to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Somebody somewhere to send you something somehow -- this is you directingthe forces that are within and beyond you to further your own Self. This is anextension and magnification of YOU!An example would be, \"I Setnakt do raise this horn in troth to the Great Setnaktswearing that I will have finished my novel before I next sit in this hall! I swearthat this work will reveal the strength, beauty, and terror of my art!\" After thisfearsome pledge, you must meditate on past failures and triumphs slowly lettingthis meditation take you to an Understanding of the nature of isolate intelligence.When this is achieved, you may close in the standard manner. For those of youoperating outside of the Temple of Set, I would recommend crying out, \"Hail Set!Hail Loki!\" and ringing the bell nine times.8. To be effective this rite must be done many times. Sometimes you willhave to come to the chamber with an Understanding that you've failed in yourgoal. This will teach about resistance, you may have to recast your oath orredouble your efforts. By meditating on this you will have learned about yourSelfand the Universe. Sometimes you will come to boast on accomplishments. Youwill begin to sense your Becoming -- to make real contact will your godhood. Thiswill enable you to become mightier in your magic and achievement. If practicedregularly -- say one a month at chosen midnights -- not only will you throw offmuddy subjectivity but you learn the path whereby that which is within your blackheart may be brought forth into the world.9. This rite has been done countless times. This is a very simplified form of arite of Germanic warriors called the sumble. This combination of toasts and oathsis scattered throughout Northern European literature -- its last form being foundin the myths of King Arthur and the Round Table. It has been revised in a darkerform by a Warrior-Priest within a knightly Order of the Temple of Set. More thanthis I cannot say, but here lies a Great Secret for ritual construction. Take a ritualthat was Worked and when you ReWork it according to the principles of your trueSelf -- it will Work again.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
