[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Set It Straight!by DenytEnAmunThis article discusses Set as portrayed in ancient Egypt and as understood inthe modern day Temple of Set. This was DenytEnAmun's first article on Set.Every Setian is sooner or later bound to form some sort of opinion on the entitywhose name s/he has taken as a part of her/himself. Whether Set exists or not,and what should we think about his Priesthood, are two of the bunch of veryfrequently discussed issues in the Temple. The lack of empirically testifiableevidence gives these questions an aura of perennial problems. Sometimes thepossibility of Set's existence has been tried to be refuted on the basis thatwe cannot know about it, that all attempts at apprehending him are mere mysticalnonsense. What more, profane society - if it is at all familiar with Set theEgyptian god - knows him as an envious and savage murderer, sexual pervert, andwhat not that seems to justify condemning his 'followers' as sneaky 'devilworshippers'.This sketchy article will focus on whether there is any evidence to support ourimage of Set as the universal god of consciousness and non-nature (theparticularizations of which we in a way are) -- not the butcher of Osirian myth.In his lucid account Seth: the God of Confusion, H. Te Velde states that themeaning of the name of Set is uncertain by modern etymological standards. Thisin mind we may examine some of the pseudo-etymologies. Plutarch offers 'theovermastering' or 'overpowering', and then indicates that in many cases the namemay mean 'turning back' or 'overpassing'. No egyptian speculation supports thelatter meaning directly. Te Velde suggests that the egyptian theologian wouldhave agreed with the first meaning as it goes hand in hand with Set'smythological function. In the Coffin Texts (of the Middle Kingdom) the firstmeaning might have been avoided by substituting the Set-animal by a sign thatmeans 'to separate'. This sign later fell into disuse, but Te Velde says themeaning of Set as 'the god set apart' or 'the god who separates' was carried on.\"The Seth-animal functions as a determinative for words indicating conceptsdivergent from the normal order, which to the egyptian mind was given by godsand is guarded by them, and it has a negative meaning.\" (p. 24) In Gods of theEgyptians (part II: p. 244) Budge puts it that Set was generally thought to bethe cause of every thing which tended to reverse the ordinary course of natureand of law and order. From a moral point of view he was thus the personificationof sin and evil. Recalling what Serge Sauneron's The Priests of Ancient Egypthas to say about the Egyptian world- view, the negative connotations becomeunderstandable. Sauneron explains that the Egyptians thought that \"the universe,predetermined since its creation, has been organized for all eternity accordingto patterns unvaryingly alike\" (p. 29), and that holding up this balance isindispensable, moreover not by 'inventing' new solutions when difficulties"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"arise, but rather by seeking the already existing remedy from old texts.(p. 119) Rostislav Holthoer, the professor of Egyptology in the University ofUppsala (in Sweden), who teaches the subject also in Helsinki University,mentioned on one class that \"The 'nefer' of the people was to particularize theneteru, thus to uphold Ma'at, the universal order. This was felt to be just,good and purposeful.\"According to Te Velde Set's (and Nepthys') birth was the beginning of confusion.Set caused disorder even before his name existed, and disturbed the regularprocesses of creation [as reflected in his allegedly disorderly birth; Plutarch:\"not in due season or manner, but with a blow he broke through his mother's sideand leapt forth\".] Te Velde observes that this is in keeping with Set'sunpredictable and violent nature. While discussing the significance of Set'stesticles he comes to a like- minded opinion: \"The testicles of Set represent thesavage, elementary, yet undifferentiated urges ...\" He seeks to establish thatSet was a sort of inevitable disorder in order, whose myths render possibleexperiencing unacceptable things within fixed bounds. Set would thus be a\"'spirit of disorder'... the lord of unbridled forces in nature and incivilization.\" (p. 56) Set, the antisocial god, cut off from the community ofthe gods?Well, Set does not really fit into the established view, that seems clear. Thede Lubicz [See #2L, S] interpretation of Set as per the premise that the aim ofEgyptian religion was a conscious return to theCause/Source, is that Set is theprinciple of concreteness, fixation, and separation. He represents \"the fallinto nature\" ('Sethian affirmation of duality'), materiality, and in generaleverything that de Lubicz considers animalistic. This is a very Osirian (or'Horian' as she might call it) interpretation and sounds as if she ratherforcibly tried to integrate Set into her scheme.Personally I think Te Velde has a good point, for non-Setians might indeed havetried to include Set into their world- view (and thus 'negate' his power), orpersecute (for the sake of the harmony of the universe!) his Priesthood whenthis didn't work out. That Set's name was used to denote to non-naturalconcepts (to what was not of the neteru/natural principles), indicates that heoriginally stood for something that didn't belong to that order. If we takeinto account that at the very least after the XX dynasty Set's cult suffered areal persecution mania and that in later theology he was reinterpreted, it seemsthat nothing certain of his original concept has survived. [For hardly would anyoriginal Egyptian Priesthood have been a lettuce-eating bunch of bacchanaliancriminals?] In the Osirian myth he became merely \"the enemy of gods and themurderer of Osiris, the being who revolted against the order established by thehighest god.\" (Te Velde, p. 150) de Lubicz must have seen Set through theOsirian lense. On the basis of this material, however, I think that we are notat all too far out on the limb if we presume Set might indeed have been the god"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of consciousness, the neter of that which is the single manifestation of lifeunbound by fixed laws on this planet. Consciousness has made man unpredictableand often an instigator of confusion, disorder and violence as well [see #17D].Te Velde says that Set came into being accidentally (p. 29) [as if by \"anunknown celestial fusion\"...], and that despite attempts to marry (or tame) him,he remains an outsider. (p. 30) The latter has been true of consciousness, too,throughout the ages of suppression, sublimation and what ever tricks to 'playit out'. But was the whole thing an accident? Set - 'the one apart', 'the causeof separation' - did not fit into the Egyptian all-embracing model, and neitherdoes a distinct and autonomous psyche fit into most non-Setian philosophies.[de Lubicz should perhaps have taken Set, the Giver of the Gift of independentconsciousness (which is not seeking to harmonize with the way of Providence, theway of the One), as a kind of 'extracosmic Providence' that she denies on page132 of #2S.]The concept of Set in the present day Temple of Set has been discussed over andover again, and so I'll remain content with a scrap on the general subject ofthe possibility of communicating with him. From an Ouspenskian point of view[#19B, C], Set might be taken as a symbol for what you are not yet enoughyourself. If you do not know yourSelf and are not truly conscious of yourSelf,then hardly will you be able to apprehend someone who is defined as the originof that which is still undeveloped in you (consciousness). It might prove a bitdifficult to emphathize with a neter of non- nature in case your consciousnessis most of the time in the grip of mechanical/natural phenomena. Even the Bibleis plain about this: \"He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hearthem not, because ye are not of God.\" (John 8: 47) To fulfil the promise of theBible (:)), take steps to develop the non-natural presence of Self in you, andto establish its independence of and control over the mechanical objectiveuniverse, and you will certainly also increase your chances of apprehending Set,the Being whose very essence is not of nature. [You cannot establish meaningfulrapport even with your fellow humans unless yo u first learn a common language.]From another vantage point, any noetic experiences of yours will probably remainon the level of belief and imagination (mystical nonsense) unless you havetrained yourself in sound reasoning also. Moreover, you will not be able tocommunicate the experience intelligently without sufficient mastery of thedomain of reason (and language). This in turn again depends on your properly'arranging' your soul (Plato's allegory of the state in which all parts do theirproper job -- the belly and heart subservient to the head; Ouspensky's ideasabout developing a 'Deputy Steward', and so on). I think a most commendable wayto approach Set [if the reasoning for the necessity of the influence of Set inCrystal Tablet makes sense to you in the first place] is simply to get on withXeper. In due time you will most probably uncover new instruments of cognition[learn to think in non-natural categories], which may help you deal with theissue more carefully. Only then can Set really become more than a symbol foryou - regardless of whether you conceive of him as an objective entity who in a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"way comes to 'dwell within' (energize) you as you restructure your psyche, oras an indwelling potential for development and an energy source within the humanmind (a metamodel for transformation). Of course this doesn't mean that youshould hide questions in the nearest closet; rather I urge you to think aboutthem, and to discuss them with others. That's the only way to refine yourdialectic and to get somewhere with yourSelf."}]
