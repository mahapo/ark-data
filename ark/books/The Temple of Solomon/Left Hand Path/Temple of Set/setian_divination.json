[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Setian DivinationDon Webb VÂ°The Tarot is not my divinatory system of choice, but I think my remarks mightshow how a Setian would make a somewhat different use of divinatory systems.You are all free to try the following ...The use of a Divinatory system requires four things to be of use to theAwakened Black Magician. Firstly it must reflect a Sovereign viewpoint, that isto say these are Symbols that apply to the questions of kingship, not when thecrops need to be harvested. Secondly the system must be usable within arational and ordered life. Thirdly the questioner must be of great emotionalmaturity. Fourthly, the system must have uses in sorcery.Let us consider the idea of war. Now if you asked a general to write down thecategories of war, he might write battles, logistics, strategy, civil affairs,morale, and so forth. If you asked a physician, her list might be shell shock,limb loss, field surgery, and the like. The lowly private might have boredom,mud, death of friends, and fear. Now each of these is a complete map of warthat serves the person doing the mapping. It reflects their needs, theirobservations and their wisdom. The Setian looks for a system designed by rulers,for rulers -- whether it would be Crowley's Tarot deck, the Runes, the Oghamand so forth ...If you choose to read the Divinatory system to aid/manipulate your friends, youimpose upon them three things. Firstly a viewpoint of a class to which you arebecoming a member. Secondly awe and respect for that class. Thirdly wisdombeyond (but tempered by) your own. This moves them toward change and you towardstatus.If you use the Divinatory system to help yourself out of a jam, by checking forwhich areas to aim your Will at, you are imposing three things upon yourselfand your surroundings. Firstly you are imposing rules for an idealized worldthat you would rather work in. Secondly you are allowing your dilemma to moveyou toward the Judgment/Control aspect of your being. Thirdly you arealleviating the stress of chaos by a meaningful method, rather than say abottle of Old Grandpa. This Divination attunes you to the Divinatory system andthe world to you.If you use the fullness of ideas expressed in the Divinatory system as a mapshowing where your true core self stands, you are imposing three things onyourself. Firstly you are separating your self from the universe by the simpleact of reminding yourself that you are the center of it. Secondly you aremaking yourself aware of blind spots in your Initiation. If you can't see how"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"a certain world is important as another, it reflects a lack of balance, thatneeds to be corrected by Willed action, or will be corrected by the universe inher usual sweet and loving way. Thirdly it reminds you of the Deeper work thatneeds to be done -- making your own map of the Cosmos, so that you can affectit with utter precision now, and after your death. This later exercise inObjective Consciousness is very hard.I hope that as Setians Play with the Divinatory systems, you draw yourAttention to these nine ways of its Working often, so that you begin to unlockmore than the average occultist who would like to add the Divinatory system toa collection of other neat, but ultimately useless toys.Now I would give the following exercise to someone who wanted to learn theSetian use of the Tarot.First ask yourself these questions:1. How does my current situation reflect possibilities for my development?2. How have my weaknesses contributed to my being where I am?How can I use getting out of where I am to get where I need to be?3. What will the real impact of my current situation be in six days, sixmonths, and six years?4. How many factors are governing the current situation?Second write down the answers in your magical diary.Third do an Invocation:Oh Self that I seek to Become, open your mysteries to me. Rejoice in steps toovercome that which hinders me, bless my serenity in accepting that which Imust suffer to change me, and energize my magical curiosity that I may knowthe difference. Let my view extend beyond time and space! Hail, my Self-to-Be!Fourth put the cards and read them according to the methods you have seen used.A good historical understanding of the system is very important as well ascommon reading skill.Fifth write down the reading and your interpretation of it. Be brutal withyourself.Sixth look for other patterns, things like who the cards remind you of, noisesin your room, other synchronicities. Note them as well."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Seventh, now pick up the cards you don't like, put down cards in their placefor the reading you would like to see. Think about how you would need to changethe things in your life to move toward this pattern. Keep the cards out whereyou can study the pattern every day for four or five days, during this time youcan make a few more changes. At the end of that time say another invocation,\"From the Future you come!\" Leave the cards out in the Dark that night. Thenbegin working to make your Willed prediction come true.Eighth, write down your successes and failures.Ninth, every six or seven months review your progress. Are you becoming moreaccurate with your predictions? (If not, try a different system.) Are youbecoming better at bringing about what you want? (If not, examine your life verycarefully.)This procedure reflects a Setianized use of an existing occult technology. Itis, of course, much harder than the occult world would teach you, it is alsomore useful.]Xeper,Don WebbHigh Priest"}]
