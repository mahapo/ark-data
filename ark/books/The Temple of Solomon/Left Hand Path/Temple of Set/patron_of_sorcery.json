[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE PATRON OF SORCERYDakhla Sba16 July XXXI, Aeon of Set(1996 CE)During a recent conversation, a student of ancient Egypt mentioned to me thecult of Isis and Osiris and its survival of the fall of Egypt as a Mediterranean\"mystery religion\". As an initiate of the modern Temple of Set, I began towonder to what extent the original cult of Set had survived that civilization,and what documented forms this survival had taken.I found an answer in Hans Dieter Betz's edition of The Greek Magical Papyri inTranslation Including the Demotic Spells (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,1986). In the twilight of Egyptian civilization, Set, the Lord of Darknessdenounced by followers of Osiris, became a patron of sorcery. This apparentlyoccurred by way of Egyptian priests moving into freelance magical practice afterforeign domination led to loss of royal funding for the temples.It is strange to envision the Egyptian priests consigning their lore to thewritten word, given their notorious reputation for xenophobia and secrecy.Significantly, while these spells span the full range of magical operations,little of a theoretical character is disclosed.In PGM IV 154-285, there's an invocation of the Feared One that specificallymentions the defeat of Osiris, the dying god, and the Setian power over thehypotic gaze of Apep, serpent and neter of chaos that threatened the solarbarque:\"Oh dark's disturber, thunder's bringer, whirlwind,Night- flasher, breather-forth of hot and cold...I'm He who searched with you the whole world andFound great Osiris, whom I brought you chained.I'm he who joined you in war with the gods!I'm he who closed heav'ns double gates andput to sleep the serpent who must not be seen...\"Later in the same text the magician addresses the rising sun:\"...You who are fearful, awesome, threatening,You who're obscure and irresistable,And hater of the wicked, you I call,Typhon, in hours unlawful and unmeasured...\"As mentioned elsewhere, the rising sun was one of the symbols of Xepera, theancient Egyptian concept of Self-Creation."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fragments of Egyptian are found everywhere in these Greek spells. The 'truenames' \"erbeth\", \"pakerbeth\" and \"bolchoseth\" appear repeatedly in invocationsof Set. They may be corrupted praise names. The words are seen in binding andrestraining spells (PGM IV 2145-2240, perhaps PGM VII 467-77, PGM XXXVI 1-34),spells to charm and subject (PGM VII 940-68, PGM XLVI 4-8), to cause separation(PGM XII 365-75, PDM XII 62-75 and XII 76-107), \"evil sleep\" (PDM XIV 675-94)and crazed lust (PGM XXVI 69-101).It is in the spells for self- initiation that one gets a sense of how thedestruction of their civilization shaped the perspective of those who usedthese conjurations. The social machinery of the temple tradition responsiblefor these spells was dying, or already dead, and it was the individual who nowpursued the magical arts for individual ends. Freelance practice of this typewas solitary and secretive compared to the observances of state cults or eventhe mystery-religions. This presents problems in evaluating the significance ofthe papyri as evidence for survivals of the ancient cult of Set.The magical papyri presented by Betz are thought to have come from a privatelibrary in Thebes and date from the 2nd century BCE through the 5th century CE.We can't be sure if this collection of surviving scrolls is representative, orif it reflects a cult of Set in Graeco-Roman Egypt. But they do show that someliterate Egyptians not only identified Typhon with Set but invoked the powers ofSet-Typhon, hailed Set-Typhon as a divine power, and so forth.Strange though the magical papyri seem to us today, they document a flow of\"operative\" temple knowlege from Egypt into the Mediterranean world. Thisnaturally invites speculation as to what theoretical or abstract knowlege mightalso have passed by way of the Egyptians who wrote these papyri in the twilightof their civilization.In Hermetic Magic (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1995) Stephen Flowersaffirms that the magical papyri were a major root of the Western magicalphilosophy called Hermeticism. Betz states frankly in his preface to The GreekMagical Papyri --\"It is known that philosophers of the Neopythagorean and Neo-platonic schools,as well as Gnostic and Hermetic groups, used magical books and hence must havepossessed copies. But most of their material vanished and what we have left aretheir quotations.\"By the 2nd century of the common era, Roman hostility had driven undergroundthe legendary state magic of Egypt. Thessalos, a Greek physician, reported thatTheban priests were scandalized at his inqury as to whether anything remainedof the old Egyptian magic. Nevertheless, an old priest agreed to perform a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"divination for Thessalos. His account of the working corresponds pefectly withdescriptions in demotic and Greek magical papyri that have come into our hands(Robert K. Ritner, The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, Chicago:University of Chicago, 1993, p. 219).We thus have cause to think that these papyri reflect authentic temple practice,and that priests of Egypt under Greek and Roman rule performed such rites untilthe temples were shut down. Whether this includes the invocation of Set foraggressive magic, under temple auspices, is an open question.However diabolized Set ma y have become in the final days of ancient Egypt, thepapyri show that his esteem among magicians survived the destruction of histemples and images. The spells of the Theban cache found their way onto cursetablets in Rome, Athens and Jerusalem. Details and comparisons of the papyriand tablets are found in John G. Gager's Curse Tablets and Binding Spells fromthe Ancient World (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). More generally,the practice of the \"spell-book\" of European tradition found its prototype inthe \"magical cookbook\" approach exemplified by the Theban papyri. Thus thewritten magical tradition of Europe began under the auspices of Set-Typhon, andprovided the matrix for the Remanifestation of Setian thought hundreds of yearslater.That the papyri themselves survived Roman suppression, a ferocious campaign ofdestruction of magical books under Christianity (Acts 19:19), and the rise ofIslam, may itself be reckoned to border on magic. What the papyri may yet revealof the original cult of Set-- and of such survivals as have found their way intothe wellsprings of Western thought--remains to be seen.Xeper.Compiled by Dakhla SbaSpecial thanks to the Order of Setne Khamuast for their help in researching thispage.Revised 13 March 1997 CE."}]
