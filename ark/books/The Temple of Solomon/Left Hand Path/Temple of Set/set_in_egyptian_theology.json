[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Set in Egyptian Theologyby Oz TechSet was one of the earliest Egyptian deities, a god of the nightidentified with the northern stars. In the earliest ages ofEgypt this Prince of Darkness was well regarded. One persistanttoken of this regard is the Tcham scepter, having the stylizedhead and tail of Set. The Tcham scepter is frequently foundin portraits of other other gods as a symbol of magical power.In some texts he is hailed as a source of strength, and inearly paintings he is portrayed as bearer of a harpoon at theprow of the boat of Ra, warding off the serpent Apep. Yet thewarlike and resolute nature of Set seems to have been regardedwith ambivalence in Egyptian theology, and the portrayal of thisNeter went through many changes over a period of nearly threethousand years. Pictures of a god bearing two heads, that ofSet and his daylight brother Horus the Elder, may be compared to theoriental Yin/Yang symbol as a representation of the unionof polarities. In time, the conflict between these two abstractprinciples came to be emphasized rather than their primal union.Set's battle with Horus the Elder grew from being a statement ofthe duality of day and night into an expression of the politicalconflict among the polytheistic priesthoods for control of theEgyptian theocracy. This was rewritten as a battle between Goodand Evil after Egypt expelled the Hyskos in the 18th Dynasty.Some say the Hyskos were Asiatic invaders, and others say theywere an indigenous minority that seized control of the nation.This tribe ruled Egypt for a time and happened to favor the Setcult, seeing a resemblence to a storm-god of their own pantheon.The Set cult never recovered from this identification with the Hyskos.mages of Set were destroyed or defaced. By the timeGreek historians visited Egypt, wild asses, pigs, and other beastsidentified with the Set cult were driven off cliffs, hacked intopieces or otherwise slaughtered at annual celebrations in a spiritakin to the driving out of the Biblical scapegoat. The reportof these historians is often thought to be a valid account of aa timeless and immutable theocracy , but just looking at thefrequency with which the ruling capital moved to differentcities (each being a cult-center) is enough to dispel this idea.One controversial Egyptologist has suggested that the worshipof Set might have predated the concept of paternity. Later cults"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"incorporating a father god would reject this fatherless son.This introduces another bizarre factor in the transformation of theNight/Day battle between brothers into an inheritance disputebetween Set and Horus the Younger. Any book on Egyptian myth youpick up contains the gory details of this cosmic lawsuit, whichincludes things that make DYNASTY look like a prayer breakfast.I have always been intrigued, though, that while all books affirmthat Set tore Osiris to pieces, everybody knows about Osiris, and itis quite hard to collect the pieces of the puzzle that is Set.Egyptologists have never agreed what the animal used to symbolizeSet actually is. Since the sages of ancient Egypt did not use anunrecognizable creature to represent any other major deity, wemay guess that this is intentional, and points, like the Tchamsceptre, to an esoteric meaning.References:Budge, E.A.
