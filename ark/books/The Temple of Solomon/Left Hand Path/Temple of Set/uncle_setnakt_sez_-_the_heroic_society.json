[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - The Heroic Society (his vision)Don WebbRecently I was offered a lot of money for some of my writing. I had to turn it downbecause I had already given my word to sell the article to someone else for apittance. An acquaintance told me, \"I thought you should have taken the bucks!\"\"I gave my word\", I said. \"I thought you were a Satanist\". \"I am a Satanist.\" Then Irealized my acquaintance would never be a Sata nist. He didn't Understand thatwe neither lie nor cheat - and that the use of Lesser Black Magic is to movezombies out of our way when all else fails. If you Understand that, thensomething of our word reaches you. Let's consider the Heroic Society:1. In an Heroic Society inequality is recognized as a fact -- not to bring aboutstagnation but to encourage a constant striving on the part of all.2. In an Heroic Society the state would not be idealized. There would bediscord -- since as we sought out Higher Selves these Selves would not alwayshave the same goals -- but discord would be tempered with respect.3. In an Heroic Society evil would not be perpetuated. Repeat offenders ofthe laws the current society holds so dear (rapists, murderers, child abusers,drug dealers) would be put to death. Repeat offenders who force their cultureand religion upon others (q.v. Aleister Crowley Liber Oz) would suffer the samefate.4. In an Heroic Society aid would flow freely to those attempting greatquests. The government wouldn't sponsor the arts, and PBS wouldn't havethose endless telethons.5. In an Heroic Society excellence would be recognised as the goal. Athleticor intellectual or spiritual excellence would be the goal. This does not mean theweak are to be despised -- when the 'business as usual' society has faded away,each man and each woman will strive to Become more than they seem.6. In an Heroic Society nothing guarantees excellence. You don't get itthrough being born to a certain race, belonging to a certain creed (evenSatanism!), being a certain sex. The physically challenged person whoovercomes his/her handicap is a prime example of a Hero.7. In an Heroic Society isolate intelligence -- the Black Flame -- is prizedabove all things. Sellers of drugs (legal and illegal), purveyors of numbingentertainment, preachers of individuality-denying systems will disappear asnightmares in the dawn of reason.8. In an Heroic Society one will seek after the mysteries. We will celebrate"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and Understand the transcendental moments of ALL cultures.Not through some crystal-counter 'channeling', but with a careful interplay of realresearch (archaeology/anthropology) and mystic insight from the talented amongus. We will study all, accept all, but we will revel unabashed in the pride of ourown ancestral streams. The honour of all mankind will be Remanifest in anHeroic Society.9. In an Heroic Society we will explore OurSelves and find the full range ofour voices. By being true to ourSelves rather than to a cultural norm (or god),our acts are freed from the heavy burden of claims of universality, eternality, andabsoluteness -- such total ponderous oneness with the natural order -- our workbecomes sparkling, free and joyous. The hero speaks with the justified voice â€“the Ma'at Kheru -- and his Word changes the worlds.This is Setnakt's vision. If it is yours -- take it into the depths of yourSelf -- andcast it upon the world with the strongest of your magical might! Magic can be inevery intentional act.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
