[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The God Setby SetnaktThe best English study of Set is Te Velde's Seth: God ofConfusion Brill 1977.If this particular text is unavailable through your library, I recommend a a shortcheap and very reliable book by George Hart: A Dictionary of Egyptian Godsand Goddesses, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986. This very ambiguous god wasalternately deified and demonized depending on the cultural/political currentsrunning through Egypt. Allow me to present here a brief history of Set.Predynastically: Set was an important deity appearing in the art of the Hamiticpeoples living in the Ombos and Naquada regions. Interestingly, his was theonly god- figure not composed of parts from recognizable Earth animals.(The Hamitic speakers donated most of the terms to religious philosophy to theEgyptian langauge that seperate it from other Semitic languages including ba,ka, neter, etc. If somebody really wants to find the roots of the Egyptianreligion, they should go up the Nile and do some serious anthropology amongHamitic speaking native cultures-- the roots of the Nile may hold keys toEgyptian thought that mute stones do not).Archaic Egypt: Set generally occupies a secondary role to his enemy Horus,champion of the people of the North (except in the 2nd dynasty when one pharaohtook a \"Set\" name rather than a Horus name.) Set is intimately connected withteaching astronomy,the methods of agriculture, medicine, and above all magic.He is said to have opened the mouth of the other gods, and is the patron of thesem ritual. His cult titles include \"Great of Magic\" and \"Eternal\". There isindeed evidence that Set is set apart from other gods to die (Bonnet'scommentaries on the Pyramid texts).The astronomical cult, which placed the afterlife in the region of the Northernheavens -- particularly in and around the constellation of the Great Bear wasreplaced in the Fourth dynasty by a growing sun cult centering on Re and Horus.The great stellar monument that Imhotep designed were replaced by the solarpyramids of the Fourth and Fifth dynasty's. (Notably Cheops took no chances inthe great Pyramid's design -- although outwardly a solar monument he had a holebored through the stones aligned with the position of Alpha Draconis (a star in theGreat Bear called Thuban = \"the Subtle One\" a Set cult title?) just in case that waswhere his ka was heading.During the next few dynasties (4 - 17), Set is generally ignored. His functions areabsorbed into other gods. Thoth picks up the attributes of magic, Osiris picks upthe attributes of Mysterious time djet as opposed to exoteric time neheh. Setkeeps his attributes a storm and stellar god, and gradually comes to be associated"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"with all night fears -- nightmares, desert fiends, and bad animals such as the hippoand the jaguar of the South. He is mentioned in a famous 12th dynasty writingcalled The Discourse of a man with his Ba in which his solar aspect IAA isreferred to. Bikka Reed has a great translations of this text.In the 18th dynasty a remarkable Pharoah Hatshepsut reintroduced the worship ofSet by building a Temple dedicated to him and Horus the Elder at Ombos. Thismarked a strong interest in Set's eternal nature, for example in Hatshepsut isthe prophecy (which she had placed in her tomb at Der el-Medina) that \"She willnot only enjoy the days of Horus, but the days of Set will be added to her span.\"She was also interested in the antinomian nature of the Set cult -- in fact shepreformed one of the most scandalous acts available to a woman -- she actedas a man. This early feminist clearly found Set, a great archetype to Work with.Set was popular among her family until the Kingship of Akhenaton.(may he be reborn forever drowning in the jaws of Sobek the crocodile god).The very militaristic pharaohs of the Nineteenth dynasty, who were probablydescended form a family of Set priests at Tanis, delighted in Set both in hismilitaristic role and as God of Foreign places. Ramses II for example calledhimself the Son of Set. The Set cult too was very popular with foreignerscoming to live in Egypt. His worship has always been connected with theoutsider.The Twentieth Dynasty began by looking very favorably on this god, as is shownin the name of its founder Setnakt, \"Set is Mighty.\" There is also considerableevidence that the set cult was favored among artisans of the time (see Romer'sAncient Lives, Henry Holt, 1984, and if you've got as copy of Stephen Quirk'sAncient Egyptian Religion check out the beautiful Stella of Aapehty --probably the most beautiful surviving example of Setian art).By the end of the Twentieth Dynasty, as the funerary cult of Osiris became thedominate force in popular Egyptian religion,more and more, Set as the murdererof Osiris became the Evil One. In fact by the Twenty Sixth dynasty it was acommon practice to disfigure any representations of Set. He became --for allpractical purposes the Christian devil. Some scholars have even derived the nameSatan from Set-Hen, a cult title meaning the Majesty of Set, but I am dubious of thisparticular derivation.However Set was not down for the count. During the Ptolemaic period Set, mergedwith the Greek titan Typhon, became the figure for the goes or sorcerer to use.After Hermes the most often invoked god in the Magical papyri is Set-Typhon. Thisentity was used to bring spirit helpers ( bird would fly down and announce that themagician was now under the protection of a god -- a popular Typhonic practiceoutside of Egypt as well se Morton Smith's Jesus the Magician). Set was also thegod to invoke to send dreams, perform healings on the head or spinal column, and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to cause enmity between enemies.There seems to be a few common threads running through the Set cult: the questfor immortality, antinomianism, and the practice of magic. Perhaps this is whyMichael Aquino's current Temple of Set finds this figure so appealing as anarchetype for the Left Hand Path. Like Hatshepsut before Aquino has Opened theMouth of this ancient god, and the articulation of the Principle ofIsolate Intelligence is available to us today."}]
