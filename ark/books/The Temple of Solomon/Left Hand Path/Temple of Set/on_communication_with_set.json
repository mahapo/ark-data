[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"On Communication with Setby Don Webb VÂ°, High PriestThe nature of communication between Set, god of the Subjective Universe and anindividual, depends on the contents of the mind of the individual. Imagine ifyou will a PH.D mathematician being told that has been she told she has an hourto give her last year's research to a group of people. She composes her notes,creates and speech and walks in to find the audience composed of four year olds.This would be Set's dilemma in interacting with us. The medium with which ourhypothetical professor has to work -- the language and attention span of a fouryear old -- is not unlike the medium Set has to Work with -- the contents of ourminds gathered randomly through the course of our lives.Set can communicate in the fashion of a concentrated Greater Black MagicalWorking, but these communications are rare and usually leave the Worker withmore questions than he had before.The last time I talked with Set he suggested that I run the Heb-Sed Working forthe Temple. It took six months to research, a year to do, needed 12 articlesfor the _Scroll of Set_, caused me to found an Order in the Temple, and requiredthat I make trips to the British Museum and then Oasis of Las Vegas. I learneda great deal about myself, the world and Temple through this -- and the *real*meat of the Communication wasn't in the twenty minutes of reception of the _Bookof the Heb-Sed_ but in the processing of all that I did in the 18 months thatfollowed. I am still processing it, and expect that I will be throughout myearthly incarnation.Just as an average magician may write a talisman on a piece of parchment, Setwrites His talismans on certain hard-won human qualities such as Courage,Curiosity, Determination, Play, and Creativity. Just as the human magician useshis talisman to draw wealth or love into manifestation in the Objective Universeform the the Unmanifest, which the profane call the Future, Set uses histalisman to draw Xeper form the Unmanifest.Set's Purpose does not require communication. His method for Working in theObjective Universe is by providing an insight into the nature of personhood.This insight given through the medium of his Aeon is fourfold.Firstly there is the observable fact of the Xeper of Setians. This takes yearsto see, but when you've seen former street people getting their Ph.D.s oraverage guys form Dallas re-creating the Runic tradition; you discover thatthe limits that you have placed on yourself are false. Average people, who havebeen purposeless dreamers all their lives, have learned to achieve. The Need"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"for seeing this is why the Temple, Set's chief (but by no means only) Tool inthe Aeon exists. We see other people getting better, and we know that gettingbetter is possible. Our Bond between the Living and Dead (sometimes referred toesoterically as the Bond of the Nine Angles)is that we will in our turn becomesuch sources of inspiration to those that come after us. Thus our biographiesare Set's talismans.Secondly there is the observable fact of the genius of your own creation. Thereare moments when you exerted Will and became what you are now. (Will is theprocess of choosing between two or more desires). You draw inspiration forfuture adventures based on Knowledge of your past states. This process iscalled Xeper = \"I Have Come Into Being.\" Desiring more of such Knowledge theself is impelled to start new tasks. This is the source of further Will, anddefines the object of that Will.Thirdly there is the observable fact that others have used the powers of magicthrough out history, and gained a Victory over evil. (Let us recall that forthe Setian Evil = Stupidity). By study of their methods and results we canobtain Knowledge of the nature of Set, and of *ourselves* for we are theproducts of such magic.Fourthly there is the observable fact of the magic of the Aeon, which is thatwhen sincere intelligent people get together to discuss the Ideas that feed orare fed by Xeper, the general level of brilliance goes up. That there is infact a \"quickening\" of the minds involved as they benefit not only from theirhard Work and the thought-provoking ideas of their fellows, but actually forman otherwise hidden force.These methods of communication with the Prince of Darkness are much more profundand subtle than what may be experienced in the emotional aspects of the ritualchamber. Learning to Hear and Heed the Law as we can best understand it throughthese personal and difficult methods, is the process of Awakening to the Aeon.Facilitating these arenas is the job of the Priesthood of Set, and because oftheir own success with these methods they have Become Sacred to and Consecratedby the Prince of Darkness.Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law.Great Is The Might Of Set, Greater Still He Through Us."}]
