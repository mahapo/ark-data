[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Seven Yogas for Postmodernsby Don WebbWe spend a great deal of our time in chaos and nonattainment.Our modernist forebears had at least thedriving thought of a central paradigm. They knew what theGood was, what Virtue was -- and how by pursuing thesethings they could gain in material wealth and physicalvitality. As the modern world decayed in the napalm showersof Vietnam and the demanifestation of public virtue duringWatergate, the values were lost, the goals set astray, andthe center gave way. This has produced the two greatfactors that rule the postmodernist world -- weakness andspeed.Weakness is the condition of a having no rulingthoughts. Anybody that's loud enough, stylish enough, orotherwise can present themselves with the appropriate Symbolcan gain a group of followers. God is indeed a shout in thestreet. We will see any number of opportunistic cults,enraged bombers, and marching morons. Some looking withnostalgia to the end of the modernist era may think thatsuch mass movements are some healthy remanifestation of theprotests of the 60s. In fact it is just the opposite.Today's mass movements are people looking for anEstablishment to join.Speed comes from the lack of a ruling paradigm. Withno anchoring place for soul or mind, sudden -- basic selfchange can occur in a few hours. And when the indivual isso metamorphic -- \"Society\" which after all arises from theindividuals is even more metamorphic. The landscape ofhuman will and consciousness changes like the clouds.These two factors give mankind something it has neverbefore possessed -- a great freedom. Most will not opt forthis freedom since it will require each individual to findwhat is Essential in and of themselves. It will take work,a concentration of purpose that makes each an eye of thehurricane of the world. But it is only in that individualism that survival from annihilation is possible. Otherwise we will grow into the world machine changing our minds to reflect the latest CNN poll. Orwell was wrong -- propaganda isn't necessary for Big Brother to thrive, only inaction."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I am going to purpose seven mental disciplines thatmight help people find and refine their individualism. Theapplication is up to you. Send no money.1. Decide who your worst enemy is. Is it your mathteacher, your boss, your mother? Now make a list of all theamazing good things that came about because of them. Didthe math teacher sending you to summer school cause you tomeet your girlfriend? Did your boss clue you in on thedoctor that saved your life? Make a list of how the 'enemy'shaped your life in a truly beneficial manner. Make a habitof this practice and you will come to see that the importantissue is not the ill- will that washes over us likesplattered mud from a puddle, but the shaping that comes toour lives. Thus you will begin to see all changes aroundyou as an opportunity for self sculpture.2. Learn to suffer fools. So often we let our besttrainers escape us. There's that neighbor with the cruddyankle snapping dog and his obnoxious politics that hedesires to share with us any chance he gets. What anadmirable trainer! Cultivate an attitude of seeing him asan actor. Fantasize that's he's not really like he is, butplaying a role. Learn to appreciate his performance. Thusyou become habituated to seeing life as a comedy played foryour pleasure rather than endless string of irritatingevents ruled by random fuck-ups.3. Learn to see your place in history. Forget yourrealtionship to the Zeitgeist -- it's been replaced by thePoltergeist!! How you fit into the now is uninteresting whenthere is no central Now. Begin a list of all historicalevents absolutely necessary for your birth to happen. Didan ancestor come to America because of the potato famine inIreland? Was an ancestor captured from the coasts of Africaand sold here? Thus you will begin to see that endlesscycles of creation necessary for your existence -- dothis not to think that the universe owes you something --but to consider how important your actions are in creatingthe lives of future men and women. You and you alone arethe Now.4. Do a video festival for friends. Make a list of allthe movies that profoundly influenced you. Was it a horror"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"movie on Midnight Shlocko Theater? Rent them and show themto your friends. Watch their reactions. Get them to talkabout their thoughts and feelings for each film. Thus youwill begin to see how having the right thoughts at theright time has made you what you are. Using thisknowledge begin actively seeking the correct lifeexperiences that would likely make you have the rightthoughts for that which you would become. Thus you learnmore and more how to shape yourself by shaping yourpreconscious. And you habituate yourself to being in chargeof your thoughts rather than some random media programmer.5. Create a mask. Never before has it been so easy tocreate a persona to try on new features. The genderswitching, age changing, fantasy world of the InformationAutobahn provides endless opportunities. Much has beenwritten on this yoga, so I need to say little. But observeno matter what mask you wear -- that the very act of endlesschange and creativity points to some underlying core self ofstability. Learn to feel that core that center as you typeaway at your fantasy manifestation. Thus you begin to feelyour own center -- your own eye in the postmodern hurricane.6. Keep a secret. Find some place calm andinteresting to hide out. Tell no one about it. Here youwill have bent space to your will. Slowly the hiding placewill become a map of your conscious ness. You will see in itan external representation of the inner hidden place that noone knows. Go to this place when you need calm or when youneed omens. Such objective gateways into the subjectiveworld will begin to exert a calming influence on others aswell. If we as indivuals create enough secret sanctuaries,the world itself will grow calmer.7. Find a random alarm clock. Observe yourenvironment. Is there some event that occurs daily at arandom time? Perhaps the arrival of the postman? If so makeuse of this seeming intrusion into your life. Play like itis an alarm clock. That it's time to wake up now. Get upstretch, walk around. When you return to your work -- playthe following game. Assume you don't know what's going on.Gather data. Act on the situation to change it in some way.(There are many books on problem solving on the market --read some). Thus you learn to bring consciences into thetrance like life of your work. You become for a brief"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"moment the one-eyed man in the Kingdom of the Blind.These yogas only work if worked.
