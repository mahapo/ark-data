[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ANTINOMIANISMby Roger Whitaker IV°copyright © 2000 CEAntinomian: Metaph. A contradiction between two principles each of which is takento be true, or between inferences correctly drawn from such principles. A genuineantinomy does not involve any logical fallacy.Kant held that: natural antinomies ensue when reason endeavors to apply categories ofthe understanding, suitable to empirical experience, to the transcendental and absolute.He distinguishes; first, the antinomy of the conceptions of a finite and an infinite in spaceand time: second, of the divisibility and individuality of matter; third, of freedom andnecessity; fourth, of the existence or non- existence of a necessary being, or God.Antinomianism can be traced to the 2nd century Gnostics, (the Davidists and Familistsare the most well known antinomian Gnostic cults) from which the concept that morallaw is not obligatory emerged.What is frequently misunderstood about antinomianism is this idea of non-obligatorymoral law. Often I see this idea distorted to mean having no morals or ethics. This isabsolutely and historically innacurate. What the concept of non-obligatory moral lawmeans is that morality cannot be an obligation to doctrine as emphasized by religion orculture. Rather, morality must issue as a principle from the individuals own soul, heartand conscience as opposed to doctrinally instituted and enforced. Obviously there is anelement of self responsibility and personal development involved here.Antinomianism as a praxis of spiritual dissent manifests as both a methodology and apracticum to personal spiritual freedom. Antinomianism represents a historicalmethodology and post- modern evolution of individualized thought that seeks freedomfrom the confines of cultural, social and genetic/memetic programming. The path ofspiritual dissent has most often been documented and categorized as that of the Left HandPath (LHP). The path of harmonious acceptance of man as he is and the giving over ofself responsibility to a higher force has most often been represented by the Right HandPath (RHP).The Right-Hand Path vs. Left-Hand PathThe distinction between the RHP and the LHP is one of the most misunderstooddichotomies I have personally encountered. The pagan community misunderstands it,most contemporary Satanists misunderstand it, certainly mainstream religion hasn't got aclue. So, let me fill you in. The true distinction between the LHP and the RHP is one ofintention: The LHP seeks a separation from God or nature for the purpose of selfdeification and the inherent personal responsibilities that implies. The RHP seeks tomerge with God, to join the natural forces, to be with god and to allow the doctines ofthat god determine the degree and form of self responsibility."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The RHP vs. LHP is NOT good against evil in the classic socialized, religious,cultural sense. It is about the most important choice a conscious being can make duringhis/her life. The loss of personal individuality and egocentric consciousness to thegentleness, solicitude and peace of God OR fighting to maintain the individual Will, thesense of Self knowledge and Being that the LHP recognizes as a special \"Gift\" whichenables that choice to be made, and of which carries a tremendous degree of personalresponsibility to successfully manifest.The LHP seeks to retain individuality of self, the RHP seeks \"oneness\" with God. TheLHP understands oneness as a technology that promotes the dissolution of the individualself into a greater whole. The LHP is a Path of individuation and Willed activity. In otherwords, it does not come to you, you must go to it. This intrinsically makes the LHP adifficult one to follow. The RHP will come to you, it will embrace you with open arms.On the other hand (literally) the LHP requires a willed alteration of the way you perceivethe objective and subjective realities that form a personalized understanding of life and itsmeaning on all levels of activity.The Left Hand Path is a syncretism in the post modern era taking liberally fromseveral areas of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. Existentialism, relativism,antinomianism, hermeticism, all share ideas which are synthesized into the LHPconception. Tracing the roots of these ideas we find hints and glimpses contained in theextant thoughts of certain Gnostic sects, the Graeco/Roman Egyptian philosophies andaspects of the ancient Egyptian philosophical and religious cults. Particularly we see thisin the reflections of the ancient Setian Priesthoods of Egypt which have been integratedinto other lines of philosophical thought.As previously stated, the differentiation between the LHP and the RHP is one ofintent. For instance, in the Church of Rome (Catholic) ritual is utilized. All the elements -altar, bell, candles, incense etc., form the components of ritual. However, if you were toread Howard Stanton Levee's (A.K.A. Anton Szandor LaVey) \"Satanic Bible\" ritual isalso utilized using those same elements. The difference lies within the intention of theparticipants. Therefore, the technology itself does not distinguish one methodology fromthe other, rather the perceptions and cognitive structures of how these technologies maybe utilized are the essential determinants.Whether a candle is white or black doesn't mean squat in and of itself. However, howthe symbolism of the colored candle is perceived within consciousness and then manifestas a psychological component within oneself and their environment means everything.Therefore, initiation itself is largely a psychological process.Understanding the above statement, everything that initiatory systems have promisedcan be within the individuals grasp. Higher consciousness, wisdom, the ability to \"do\" oraccomplish what one envisions for themselves all become within reach. It would not betoo far of a stretch to infer that certain aspects of psychology rather than being arelatively \"new\" science are actually very ancient. The intent of these methodologies"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"being transformative - developed to alter the way in which one perceives their internaland external environments for the purpose of accomplishment.The Functional Prosthesis of AntinomianismThe function of antinomianism is to dissent from established religious, cultural andsocial ideas that are often not the result of personal experience. The purpose of thisspiritual dissent is to come to conclusions and ideas about the objective and subjectiveenvironment - on a personal level - that are your own. The antinomian spirit dissents fromfaith that is not arrived at through a careful introspection via intellectual and creativemeans. It does not deny faith, it denies blind faith and obedience to ideas that you are notyour own through experience or developed contemplation and philosophical inquiry.It is fully possible to have a rational faith in very large ideas (such as the essentialnature of human consciousness) without having to simply \"accept\" it because religion,cultural ideology or socialization have told you that it is so. The alternative to this \"blindacceptance of dogma\" is to carefully evaluate the known facts from largely unbiased datasuch as scientific, archaeological and well developed philosophical concepts and thencome to your own conclusions. Sometimes to successfully accomplish this task one mustlearn very new thinhgs such as a new language, or go to school and take some courses inphilosophy or to create a unique art. This is part of the responsibility that the antinomianpraxis demands of its adherents.Through the utilization of the process I have just described you can reach the limits ofwhat is known to you and begin to project - based upon that known - into the unknown.This personal projection will have a very different form than what is possible through theundeveloped constructs that are AND never were your own in the first place. Comparethis idea to those of Plato regarding dianoia and noesis, you will find that they are similar.Divine inspiration can only result from the use of the truly divine Gift - the full use of theintellectual faculties - it cannot, and never has occurred as the result of the sublimation ofconsciousness.When you begin to disperse ideas that are not your own, and replacing them with whatyou do KNOW the entire world as you view it will change. Wisdom comes from ideasthat help free you from that which is not your own. Thus opening the floodgate to whatcan be yours through the divine Gift. Any text which asks you to accept its tenets - onblind faith or dogma - is an abhorrence to the dignity of the soul which seeks its trueexpression through its own knowledge of self. Any text which asks you to examine itsideas and sources and then determine for yourself the validity of its ideas is to beesteemed. The answers are out there, but it will take an awakening, a desire, and the Willto Seek for the tree to bear its fruit.Antinomianism is not only a dissent from spiritual ideas that are not your own, thatyou have not experienced, but also from cultural and social ideas that are not your own.The entire antinomian spirit is motivated by a praxis that denies the blind acceptance ofideas no matter their source. It is one which urges each individual to make up their own"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"minds on religious, social and cultural paradigms. This understanding must be basedupon what the individual has learned through the strength of their own desire toconsciously understand the contents of the proxemic environments each must inhabit.A genuine antinomy has no logical fallacy. One seeks to understand and conceive theunknown through the known so what was once hidden becomes then revealed. This is anantinomian perception. One seeks the spirit through the vehicle of the flesh for it houseswithin its finite experience, an infinite (for all purposes) existence. These ideas cannot beunderstood or approached through Oneness, these ideas are approached through divisionand then an eventual separation of elements within the singularity and individuality ofconsciousness (another antinomy). Given the above description of antinomianism it ispossible to understand that it is a proportional construct. It is the perfect reconciliation ofopposites not into unity, but rather, into a separate syncretism from which AleisterCrowley's formulaic conception of 0=2 becomes fully revealed as the antinomian formulafor spiritual dissent."}]
