Between Pithecanthropus Erectus and Cro-Magnon the cranial cavity almost doubled in size - from about 900 cc to about 1,700 cc. Darwinian evolutionists are completely unable to explain this development and therefore deal with it in texts by simply glossing over it. The Temple of Set does not.17A. Childhood’s End by Arthur C. Clarke. NY: Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc., 1953. [Deutschland: WU: 34/16-683] (TOS-3) (LVT-1) MA: “A most fascinating - and delightfully diabolical - speculation on the Gift of Set that, in a more abstract version, was later brought to the screen as 2001: A Space Odyssey [see #F17A.] The eventual sequel to that film, 2010, broke no new ground; what more was there to say?” J. Lewis VI°: “Is there another book by man which describes the Gift of Set in better ‘fiction’?”17B. The Eternal Man by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier. NY: Avon Books #380-16725-150, 1972. [Deutschland: Die Entdeckung des ewigen Menschen - Die Umwertung der Menschheitsgeschichte durch d. phantastische Vernunft, Wilhelm Heyne Verlag (Nr. 7009), München, 1975] (TOS-1) MA: “There are a great many sensationalistic paperbacks on the market dealing with ‘startling discoveries concerning human history and prehistory’. The Setian may browse among them at will, picking and choosing substantive data for further investigation. This book, by the dynamic duo who brought you #4B and #22B, is, however, a unique item.”17C. Lifetide by Lyall Watson. NY: Simon & Schuster, 1979. (TOS-3) MA: “Dr. Watson, an anthropologist who is only very slightly ‘tainted’ by his interest in phenomena that polite academia carefully avoids, is the author of #22D and #22Q as well. Here he discusses scientific evidence for the extra-terrestrial origins of life on Earth and attempts to describe the development of the phenomenon of self-consciousness through purely-natural means. It is a valiant attempt. He stumbles, however, on certain features (such as the working vertebrate eye) that cannot be explained by evolution, and finally he is forced to admit that there is something beyond the natural order at work. In an effort to avoid taking the plunge into theology, he coins the term ‘lifetide’, a sort of neo-version of the ‘vitalism’ used as an escape-valve for inconvenient facts by hard-core Darwinists. An excellent book for seeing just how far science can go in beating its head against the door of non-natural tampering with the human intellectual equation.”17D. The Ordeal of Change by Eric Hoffer. NY: Perennial Library #P-110. [Deutschland: Die Angst vor dem Neuen, Rowohlt-Verlag, Hamburg, 1968 (WU: ZC-751-288)] (TOS-1) MA: “This book is listed specifically because of its included essay ‘The Unnaturalness of Human Nature’, which is brilliantly conceived.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"17E. The Neck of the Giraffe: Darwin, Evolution, and the New Biology by Francis Hitching. NY: New American Library (Mentor) #0-451-62232, 1982. (TOS-3) MA: “The recent attack on accepted Darwinian theories of evolution and natural selection by religious fundamentalists has prompted a few brave natural scientists and biologists to question some of the ‘sacred cows’ in the field of evolution. Evolution as a principle stands up to the most exacting tests, but some of the Darwinian sub-assumptions are found not to. There are ‘gaps’ in the fossil record between major species - for example, between early invertebrate sea creatures and ancient fishes. And between fish and amphibians. And between the reptile & the mammal jaw. How could the hyper-intricate human eye have evolved through ‘intermediate stages’? Hitching then launches into a careful discussion of mutation, genes, and cellular coding, after which he analyzes the best arguments the creationists have to offer. While dismissing creationism as ridiculous, he agrees with British Museum palaeontologist Colin Patterson: ‘They [the creationists] didn’t have the right answers, but they certainly asked a lot of the right questions.’ In addition to a 4-page bibliography of technical works, Hitching provides an additional 4-page annotated bibliography of introductory reading, keyed to points brought out in the chapters of his book. If you intend to think or talk about evolutionary theory, this book should be considered TOS-1; if you don’t, then TOS-3.”17F. The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life by Robert O. Becker, M.D. and Gary Seldon. NY: William Morrow, 1985. (TOS-3) MA: “Becker is an orthopedic surgeon who gradually uncovered a number of correlations between electromagnetic phenomena and the behavior of living tissue. In this tightly argued and well-documented book, he discusses human brain evolution and behavior in terms of past and present EM field influences, as well as the more general effects of EM radiation on living beings. This book is reviewed in detail in Runes #III-3. From the text: ‘Francis Ivanhoe, a pharmacologist and anthropologist at two universities in San Francisco, made a statistical survey of the braincase volume of all known Paleolithic human skulls, and correlated the increase with the magnetic field strength & major advances in human culture during the same period. Ivanhoe found bursts of brain-size evolution at about 380-340,000 years ago, and again at 55-30,000 years ago. Both periods correspond to major ice ages, the Mindel & the Wuerm, and they were also eras when great cultural advances were made - the widespread domestication of fire by Homo Erectus in the early Mindel, and the appearance of Homo Sapiens Sapiens (Cro-Magnon peoples) and gradual decline of Neanderthals (Homo Sapiens) during the Würm ...’ [See also #19I/J.]”17G. The Rise of Life by John Reader. (LVT-3) J. Lewis VI°: “Published as a coffee-table book, this history of life from the time of core formation 4.5 billion years ago through the present day is highly readable. Within its pages can be found evidences of the Gift of Set as life moves from one-celled presence to the succeeding rulers of the Earth. Keep an eye out for this one; it is worth its $15.95 price, though it can be found for less at book warehouses.”- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"17H. Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness by Roger Penrose. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 (ISBN: 0-19-853978-9). (TOS-4) MA: “Penrose is a Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, and this book is a strongly scientific effort to ‘get at’ the thing called ‘consciousness’ - which Penrose ultimately acknowledges cannot be attributed to the physical machinery of the brain, nor of any artificial intelligence systems in existence. It remains scientifically elusive. An interesting feature of this book is Penrose’s discussion of what he calls the ‘Platonic Universe, in which mathematical concepts and truths inhabit an actual world of their own, that is timeless and without physical location’. Penrose sketches his discussion in terms of the *interrelationship* of this ‘Platonic U’ with the ‘Physical U’ of scientific observation (the Temple of Set’s ‘objective universe’) and the ‘bridge’ of the ‘Mental U’ of observing/reflecting intelligences.”17I. The Tangled Web: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit by Melvin Konner, Ph.D., M.D.. NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1982. (TOS-3) Patty Hardy IV°: “A thoughtful and cautious study of human nature, particularly its destructive facets, from a biological perspective. The author realizes that humans are oddly transitional, and calls for self-knowledge guided by a sense of wonder. He fears the political misuse of behavioral biology, but he fears ignorance still more.” DW: “Magistra Hardy suggested this book for Category #16, Magister Ronald L. Barrett for #17. Konner is currently Professor of Anthropology at Emory University, jointly appointed to the Department of Psychiatry at the Emory School of Medicine.”17J. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. NY: Harper & Row, 1990. (TOS-1) DW: “If the crisis of 1975 had not caused the rapid change from Indulgence to Xeper, but things had happened gradually, we would have Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of Flow. The way to happiness lies not in mindless hedonism but in mindful challenge. This is about the art of obtaining happiness by learning to control the psyche and seeking new challenges for the self. It is about Xeper, written from the perspective of a non-magician. A great book, and one that you can give to your nonSetian friends.”17K. The Stars my Destination by Alfred Bester. Various editions beginning 1956. (TOS-5) DW: “Gulliver Foyle is lost in space, floating away from the wrecked rocket. He discovers a great secret, and in using it changes the world forever. What he does is to put the secret into the right hands, and by giving it away accomplishes his goals from the meanest to the greatest. It provides a better look at Revelations 13:13, and reveals the real reason why the Temple of Set is a scary organization. ‘Gully Foyle is my name,/ And Terra is my nation./ Deep space my dwelling place,/ The stars my destination.’”* * *- 3 -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F17A. 2001: A Space Odyssey. MGM/United Artists, 1968. MGM/UA VHS #MV700002. (12-1022). Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. Directed/produced by Kubrick. (LVT-1) MA: “As noted in #17A, the conceptual roots for 2001 go back 1-1/2 decades to Childhood’s End, though this was [for obvious religious reasons] not advertised with the film’s release. Even so it is surprising that the film did not draw fire from conventional religion, its theme being that mankind is essentially an experiment on this planet by an alien intelligence. The simple device of changing the ‘Devil’ Karellen [or Set] to a Golden Sectioned monolith made the plot sufficiently abstract to be non-threatening. Besides, most audiences were less interested in the Nietzschean/Setian implications of the film than they were with HAL the computer [supposedly more advanced than IBM, so his name was created by ‘the next higher letter’], space scenes with Strauss waltzes, and the final ‘stargate trip’ scene. Seen through Setian lenses, 2001 remains a beautiful essay on the Gift of Set.” J. Lewis VI°: “The message of 2001 took many a person around many a mulberry bush on its arrival on the theater circuit. I saw it shortly after its release while in the company of several Christian brothers and priests, and grew weary of hearing the monolith being described as ‘God’. They missed the point completely: The monolith served as a god-like instrument, but readers of #17A get a far better picture of what was actually occurring. [Setians attending Set-VIII visiting Universal Studios got to see HAL and the Discovery during the holiday. The monolith was not available at the time, but we managed to interact with the real thing later on during the Conclave.]”F17B. Five Million Years to Earth. British, 1968. DW: “This sci-fi adventure in the Quatermass series shows the Gift of Set in a thriller format. Workers unearth a spaceship (powered by an inverse pentagram) in a remote part of London (named ‘Hob’s End’ after the Devil said to have appeared there in ancient times). It’s part of a Martian plot: The Martians look like ‘demons’ (an idea reused in #F19C2), and they’re coming back through a Remanifestation of their ideas. Sadly Satan loses, but this is a great treat for Pylon film night.”- 4 -"}]
