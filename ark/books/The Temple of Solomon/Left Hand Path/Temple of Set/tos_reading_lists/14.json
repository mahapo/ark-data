[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temple of Set Reading ListCategory 14: Fascism, Totalitarianism, and MagicFaschimus, Totalitarismus und Magieas of February 26, 2003MA: This is a very potent, controversial, and dangerous area of magic, whose implications are rarely examined, understood, or appreciated by the profane [which is just as well]. Much of the data concerning it derives from Nazi Germany, whose character as a state based upon magical rather than conventional principles goes a long way towards explaining the “peculiar” fascination which that episode continues to exert on students of history and political science. Many of the techniques pioneered or perfected by the Nazis continue to be used/ abused - generally in a superficial and ignorant fashion - by every country of the world in one guise or another [never avowedly as “Nazism”, of course].The Temple of Set emphasizes the potential of human individualism. Metapolitical concepts such as Nazism do strengthen the power of humans, but only through a degree of collectivization of the will in a political state system. Well-run states can maximize virtue and minimize vice, as in Plato’s ideal Republic. Poorly-run states can do just the opposite, suppressing or corrupting virtue, as in Orwell’s 1984. Most contemporary political systems exist between these extremes. The Initiate/citizen must be sensitive to both the positive opportunities his society provides, and the repressive/destructive constraints it places on his freedom. Thus he may maximize the benefits of the former and avoid the damage of the latter.14A. The Mass Psychology of Fascism by Wilhelm Reich. NY: Simon & Schuster, 1970. [Deutschland: Die Massenpsychologie des Faschismus, Fischer Taschenbuch-Verlag, Frankfurt, 1974] (TOS-3) MA: “The controversial Reich examined both the Nazi and the communist elements of Germany, found them wanting, and was roundly denounced by them in return. This book exposes their use of mass movements and mob psychology as a sexual substitute, and their repression of ‘innocent’ sex as a deliberate political technique [compare #14E]. This manipulation of expression and repression is applied to other social phenomena as well - such as certain organized religious bodies. A lucid and hard-hitting study. A biographical profile of Reich is presented in #6N, Appendix 75 - ‘The Frankenstein Legacy’.”14B. The Occult and the Third Reich by Jean-Michel Angebert. NY: Macmillan, 1974. (TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA: “This book contains sections on the Grail (both Christian and pagan), traditions concerning Atlantis and ancient initiatory societies, the theories of Nietzsche and Wagner, Nazi mysticism, and the Catharist tradition. Well footnoted. The almost fantastic subject material tends to make the author’s objectivity suspect, but on close examination his argument is grounded in responsible research. On the other hand Otto Rahn, the young German mystic whose theories are advanced in this book did not hold the alleged high rank in the SS, nor commit suicide because of politico/mystical reasons. He was an Unterscharführer (sergeant) who killed himself after being expelled from the SS because of his sexual preferences.”14C. The Grail Legend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz. NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1970. [Deutschland: Die Gralslegende in psychologischer Sicht, Olten-Verlag, Freiburg, 1987] (TOS-4) (TRP-1) MA: “Another book for the C.G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology [see also #19K], this impressive study treats all major historical versions of the Grail legend, identifies their common features, and evaluates their significance. The definitive work on the Grail. See also #6N, Appendix 36 - ‘In Quest of the Unholy Grail’.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"14D. The Spear of Destiny by Trevor Ravenscroft. NY: G.P.

Read critically but thoughtfully. Since it is heavily footnoted to Theosophical Society (Blavatsky) and Anthrosophical Society (Steiner) sources, this book cannot be considered factually reliable.

[Deutschland: Ullstein Taschenbuchverlag, Frankfurt, 1981] (TOS-3) MA: “Orwell’s classic portrait of a ‘negative utopia’, with many features adapted from Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia - but also a satire of socialist trends in postwar Britain. Many features of Orwell’s imaginary society may be increasingly applied to actual ones today. The shape of things to come?”14F. Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1943. [Deutschland: Verlag Franz Eher Nachf., München, um 1935] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA: “Everyone knows that this is ‘the most evil book ever written’*, but few have taken the time to actually read it, hence cannot really explain why. Further complicating the situation is Hitler’s interspersion of political philosophy (interesting) with emotional tirades (not so interesting). Look for the discussions concerning the selection of leaders, control of the masses, and the justification for human social organization. You may be surprised at what you discover. Keep in mind that this book was written not as a historical memoir, but rather as a propaganda device to lend an image of philosophical substance and coherence to the still-fledgling and somewhat [due to Hitler’s incarceration in prison at the time of MK’s writing] disorganized Nazi Party. A far more revealing ‘Hitler Memoir’ is #14K. [* During the antiSatanism hysteria of the 1980s, the entire Temple of Set reading list was denounced by one major newspaper thus: ‘a reading list which includes MK’ (evidently to the unimportance of any other book on the entire list)!]”14G. Hitler: Legend, Myth, & Reality by Werner Maser. NY: Harper & Row, 1971. [Deutschland: Adolf Hitler: Legende, Mythos, Wirklichkeit, Bechtle-Verlag, München, 1982] (TOS-3) MA: “As time passes, biographical profiles of Hitler become increasingly more objective. This is probably the most useful one currently in print, which Colin Wilson calls ‘the most important document on Hitler so far published’. It is noteworthy for its focus on the man rather than on the political official [for the political official see #14H]. If you are going to take a look at Hitler’s own writings and statements (#14F/K/L), read this first for perspective.”14H. The War Path (NY: Viking, 1978) and Hitler’s War (2 volumes) (NY: Viking, 1977) by David Irving. (TOS-4) MA: “1933-39 (WP) and 1939-45 (HW) through Hitler’s eyes. An impressive work of research that will show you peacetime Nazi Germany and World War II as you’ve never seen them before. Sound scholarship, objective evaluation.”14I. The Bormann Brotherhood by William Stevenson. NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973. (TOS-3) MA: “Around VI-VII the pursuit of underground Nazi-survivalist organizations was all the rage, and there was a flurry of Bormannism, ODESSA films/novels, etc. This little book was sort of overwhelmed in the general stampede, but it didn’t deserve to be. A cold, clear, fact-packed study of the post-World War II survival of the original Nazi hierarchy.”- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"14J. Three Faces of Fascism by Ernst Nolte. NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1963. [Deutschland: Faschimus: von Mussolini zu Hitler, Verlag Kurt Desch GmbH, München, 1968] (TOS-4) MA: “This is a political science text analyzing 20th-century fascist movements in France, Germany, and Italy. The observations concerning the metapolitical implications of the philosophy are among the most profound yet voiced. The analysis of the failure of the French movement is as instructive as that of the successes of the German and Italian movements. It is interesting to contrast Nolte’s assessment of fascism with Hitler’s [as set forth in #14F].”14K. Hitler’s Secret Conversations 1941-1944 by H.R. Trevor-Roper (Ed.). NY: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953 [simultaneously published in England as Hitler’s Table Talk by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London]. [Deutschland: Hitlers Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquartier, Picker, Goldmann Taschenbuch Nr. 11234, München, 1979 (Englische Ausgabe Herausgeber Trevor-Roper)] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA: “Martin Bormann was sufficiently fascinated by Adolf Hitler’s private conversational comments on various topics that he persuaded Hitler to allow them to be stenographically recorded. After 1945 the transcriptions were found among Bormann’s private papers and were ultimately compiled and published by Professor Trevor-Roper (who also edited and published the final entries of Dr. Goebbels’ diaries). Hitler’s conversations cover an astonishingly broad spectrum of topics - organized religion, metaphysics, dogmatism, Voltaire, origins of the human race, æsthetics, Egyptian & Greek culture, Hoerbiger’s cosmology, genius, philosophy of law, superstition, mental diseases, etc. An impressive look into the mind of an individual whom the postwar world has been conditioned to dismiss as a crude, criminal, and unintrospective thug. Read, then judge for yourself.”14L. The Voice of Destruction by Hermann Rauschning. NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1940. [Deutschland: Gespräche mit Hitler, Europaverlag, CH-Zuerich, 1988] (TOS-5) (TRP-3) MA: “Rauschning was a regional party leader (Gauleiter) of the early Nazi Party who was a confidant of Hitler’s during 1932-34. At first so impressed with the Führer’s private statements that he took extensive and immediate notes, he later took fright and bolted to Paris. In 1937-38 he wrote a theoretical condemnation of Nazism entitled The Revolution of Nihilism: Warning to the West (NY: Alliance Book Corporation, 1939). It seemed so alarmist that few took it seriously - until World War II broke out. Then Rauschning was able to publish these transcripts and analyses of Hitler’s conversations. Topics include: Aristocracy, Antichrist, barbarism, ethics of war, a new social order, the Human Solstice, Black & White Magic, and the mystical elements in Obersalzburg. Most of the material for Nazi occultism alluded to in #4B came from this book. It was regarded as so ‘weird’ as to be spurious until after the war, when the #14K material came to light and substantiated it.”- 3 -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"14M. Hitler’s Secret Sciences by Nigel Pennick. Suffolk: Neville Spearman, 1981. (TOS-4) (TRP-1) MA: “The esoteric section of the German Nazi SS was not the Sicherheitsdienst [as alleged in #6L] but the Deutsche Ahnenerbe (German Ancestral Heritage Organization). Most histories of the SS concern themselves with the better-known organizations and activities of the Black Order, mentioning the Ahnenerbe only in passing. This is one of the first books to discuss it in any detail. Again there is a lot of #14B/C/D material, but it is all relevant and coherently organized. This is a concise (177 pages), fact-packed book bolstered by a strong bibliography of rare and unusual publications and periodicals. If you are seriously interested in the Ahnenerbe, and are fluent in highly-technical German, see Kater, Michael H., Das ‘Ahnenerbe’ der SS 1935-1945: ein Betrag zur Kulturpolitik des Dritten Reiches (Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1974). [The complete archæological, magical, and administrative records of the Ahnenerbe are contained on microfilm rolls #120-211, Microcopy T-580 (10-135-4) in the National Archives Building of the United States, Washington, D.C. These papers have never been sorted, indexed, and annotated in detail, but the Order of the Trapezoid has compiled a working index with brief annotations pending a more thorough study. Initiates of the Order who may be traveling to Washington and wish to examine that microfilm are invited to contact the Temple office for a copy of the index.] [See also #5H.]”14N. The Passing of the Great Race by Madison Grant. NY: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1916. [Deutschland: WU: 8*-913] (TOS-5) MA: “You can still find #14F in print, because it’s a good whipping-boy for sanctimonous finger-waggling. It is less easy to find the books from ‘our side’ that argued along similar lines. This is [was!] one of the more famous, and you may still uncover an occasional copy in the back room of a used-book store or in the darkest corners of obscure libraries. Grant was not exactly a nonentity or lunatic-fringe fanatic. He was Chairman of the New York Zoological Society, Trustee of the American Museum of Natural History, and a Councilor of the American Geographical Society. In this book [by a prominent publisher] he argues a forceful case for a European race history that would have done credit to Hitler and Rosenberg. The most interesting aspect of this book is that only a very few years ago it was accepted as a respectable contender in the academic/scientific community. After World War II it was, in Orwell’s terms, guilty of Crimethink and thus condemned to be an Unperson. There is a lesson to be learned here concerning the durability and invulnerability of ‘established scientific fact’ when it becomes politically or socially inconvenient. I hereby suggest that you make up your own mind as to whether the book is convincing. After all, I wouldn’t want to get in trouble for even appearing to endorse it ...”14O. Race and Race History and Other Essays by Alfred Rosenberg (Robert Pois, Ed.). NY: Harper & Row (Harper Torchback #TB-1820), 1974. (TOS-5) MA: “Extracts from the major race-history writings of the Nazis’ ‘official philosopher’ - with a finger-waggling introduction, of course. It is O.K. for this book to be in print; it has the appropriate editorial condemnation. [See also #14S.]”- 4 -"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"14P. Geopolitics: The Struggle for Space and Power by Robert Strausz-Hupe. NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1942. (TOS-4) MA: “The study of international relations on the basis of power politics is academically known as political realism (Realpolitik), and before reading #14P you might want to flip through the bible of this school, Hans Morgenthau’s Politics Among Nations, for a general familiarity with its principles. In 1926 and 1928 Oswald Spengler published his powerful indictment of contemporary Western civilization, The Decline of the West, and this made a great impression on a German General named Karl Haushofer. Haushofer became a professor who gained increasing fame in Germany as the master-theoretician of ‘Geopolitics’, being a part-political, part-geographic, and part-mystical rationale for aggressive state expansionism. Haushofer was considered by many to be the evil genius behind Hitler’s ‘blood and soil’ and ‘living-space’ programs. He wrote no single, coherent text of his philosophy. This book was commissioned in order to explain Geopolitics to a still-uncomprehending U.S. diplomatic community, and it does a good job. Geopolitical thinking was out of favor in the West until reintroduced by Henry Kissinger (a Morgenthau enthusiast), but it has always been the lynchpin of Eastern (Soviet/Chinese) foreign policy. Strausz-Hupe summarizes: ‘World policy evolves towards several continental systems, and technology accentuates the strategic importance of large, contiguous areas. Thus the era of overseas empires and free world trade closes. If this reasoning is pushed to its absolute conclusion, the national state is also a thing of the past, and the future belongs to the giant state. Many nations will be locked in a few vast compartments. But in each of these one people, controlling a strategic area, will be master of the others.’”14Q. Wewelsburg 1933 bis 1945: SS Kult- und Terrorstätte by Prof. Dr. Karl Hüser. Paderborn: Verlag Bonifatius Druckerei, 1982 (German language edition only). (TOS-5) (TRP-5) MA: “The first in-depth documentary study of the role of the Wewelsburg Castle in the mythological and Black Magical practices of the SS. This is a historical, not an ‘occult’ publication; in the first few paragraphs it easily discounts the fanciful, ignorant accounts of the Wewelsburg such as appear in #14B/D/N/R, etc. Here is bedrock: bewildering to some, but a Gate to the Order of the Trapezoid. [See also #14AC.]”14R. Hitler: The Occult Messiah by Gerald Suster. NY: St. Martin’s Press, 1981. [Deutschland: WU: B-45-197] (TOS-3) MA: “This is a short (200-page) hardcover book which brings together most if not all of the occult speculations concerning Nazi Germany, with a reasonable degree of footnoting. Hence it is included here as a good introductory survey of the field. Extensive quotations from Crowley and an ‘Æon of Horus’ theme throughout the text expose the author’s Thelemite bias.”- 5 -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"14S. The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology by Robert Cecil. London: B.T. Batsford Ltd, 1972. (TOS-4) (TRP-3) MA: “The best biography and critical analysis concerning Alfred Rosenberg, ‘official philosopher’ of the Nazi movement. Much of the material otherwise in existence concerning Rosenberg is suppressed by the Soviet Union, while previous Western biographies and editions of his memoirs were crudely edited to portray him as more of a monster than a human being, much less a philosopher. Nevertheless Cecil is no apologist for Rosenberg, bringing out his weaknesses as well as his strengths. This book also describes the ideological background and climate of Nazi Germany as a whole, and summarizes the main arguments of Rosenberg’s Myth of the Twentieth Century.

Metapolitics from the Romantics to Hitler by Peter Viereck. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1941. [Deutschland: WU: 25/16-504] (TOS-4) (TRP-1) MA: “This is quite simply the definitive history and analysis of the Germanic mystical and magical tradition as it has been applied to society and politics. No other political analysis of Nazi Germany compares with it, and an understanding of the Nazi phenomenon is impossible without it. Major sections deal with Romanticism, life-worship, Kultur, dynamism, Wagner, Chamberlain, Fichte, Hegel, Rosenberg, and Hitler.”14U. For Freedom Destined: Mysteries of Man’s Evolution in the Mythology of Wagner’s Ring Operas and Parsifal by Franz E. Winkler. Garden City, NY: Waldorf Press, 1974. (TOS-4) (TRP-1) MA: “The definitive study of the magical and philosophical aspects of the Ring and Parsifal operas. From the book: ‘When we think of the origin of man, we insist illogically on confusing the history of his purely biological being with the history of his spirit; the latter defies any attempt at investigation by methods we now call scientific. Darwin and his followers deal with the emergent evolution of visible man, while on the other hand religion and mythology deal with the evolution of his invisible soul. In his cycle of the Ring and Parsifal, Wagner uses the magic power of music, words, and scenery to open man’s heart to the history of the hidden essence of his own self, and to the changing forces that are active behind the sensory phenomena of man and Earth.’”14V. The True Believer by Eric Hoffer. NY: Harper & Row, 1951. [Deutschland: Der Fanatiker: Eine Pathologie des Parteigängers, Rowohlt-Verlag, Hamburg, 1965] (TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA: “Hoffer’s thoughtful study of the mind of the fanatic and of the various media through which such a mind attempts to fulfill itself - religious, political, or social. It is particularly instructive to compare Hoffer’s theses with the experiences of Hitler, Himmler, and Rosenberg as treated elsewhere in this reading-list category. The book’s strong point is Hoffer’s famed common-sense, but this same feature is also its weak point, because it is obvious that Hoffer is not aware of [or does not understand] the principles discussed, for example, in #14T.”- 6 -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"14W. Astrology and the Third Reich by Ellic Howe. Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: Aquarian Press, 1984.

A revised and expanded edition of Howe’s earlier Urania’s Children, this book also presents and critiques basic astrological theory and explores the Lesser Magical use of astrology as a psychological warfare device during World War II. Howe, in addition to being the author of #10F and a contributor to #4E, served in Britain’s Political Warfare Executive during World War II.”14X. The Occult Roots of Nazism: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany 1890-1935 by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: Aquarian Press, 1985. (TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA: “This new and very scholarly book fills a crucial need in the study of 20th-century Germanic occultism, namely a detailed and non-sensationalistic account of Guido von List’s Armanenschaft, Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels’ Order of New Templars, and Rudolf von Sebottendorff’s Thule Gesellschaft. Also profiled is SS-Oberführer Karl Wiligut, occult counselor to Heinrich Himmler and architect of such projects as the Wewelsburg restoration and the SS-Totenkopf ring.

Metairie, Louisiana: Thunderbird Press, Inc., 1988 (ISBN: 0-1913159-05-0). (TOS-3) (TRP-3) MA: “Buechner was a surgeon in the U.S. Army during World War II; Bernhart was a German U-boat officer and recipient of the Knight’s Cross in the same war. This intriguing collaboration by them expands upon the themes of #14D. An initial section traces the [legendary] history of the Spear of Longinus through its arrival in the Hofburg Museum of Vienna. Subsequent sections deal with the disposition of the Spear during the Third Reich & thereafter, the Wewelsburg, Nazi/SS occultism in general, the death of Adolf Hitler, and the dispostion of his body and/or the Lance and/or Nazi/SS treasure at the end of the war. As is the case with #14D, how much of this book is fact and how much is either speculation or outright fiction is open to debate. Nevertheless, also like #14D, it tells a colorful tale and is an entertaining read. It even ends on a suitably ominous note, proclaiming that the Knights of the Holy Lance exist even today (underground), and will, Barbarossa-like, remanifest themselves at the proper magical moment. This book is privately published and unlikely to be found in your local bookstore, so if you are interested in it, write to the Thunderbird Press at 300 Cuddihy Drive, Metairie, LA 70005 for purchase information.”- 7 -"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14Z. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism by Stefan Kuehl. NY/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, ISBN: 0-19-508260-5. (TOS-4) MA: “One of the most criticized elements of Nazi Germany was its attempt to ‘purify the Aryan race’ through all manner of breeding-control and non-‘Aryan’ suppression policies. All of this was based upon a concept of ‘race’ that went only skin/appearance deep, ignoring actual genetic factors. As a result the Nazi program, and earlier/later ones like it by other states, descended into mere arbitrary prejudice and cruelty. An unfortunate by-product of this is the stigma that hangs over all human genetic engineering research - which critics attack as ‘genocide’ rather than as a scientific means for the gradual improvement of human physiology and health. In this remarkable book Kuehl, who is a sociologist and historian at the University of Bielefeld in Germany, shows how the Nazi eugenics programs were inspired by original programs in the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the century, and analyzes the ‘new scientific racism’ which societies are grappling with today.”14AA. Trading with the Enemy: The Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1945 by Charles Higham. NY: Barnes & Noble, 1983 (ISBN: 0-76070-009-5). (TOS-3) MA: “While World War II was being orchestrated by the politicians and fought & endured by the masses, many large companies and financial institutions on both sides continued to do business with all sides, maximizing their profits through the demands and stresses of the war. Indeed the remarkable thing is how little notice they took of the war, save as a changing economic ‘playground’. Higham, a former _New York Times_ writer, calmly documents this astonishing ‘peek behind the curtain’, offering the reader sobering insights into what any international war really means, and to whom. The importance of this book lies not just in its historical cynicism, but in the lessons it implies for present and future ‘national conflicts’.”14AB. Al Khemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political, and Private Aspects of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz by André VandenBroeck Hudson. NY: Lindisfarne Press, 1987. (TOS-5) DW: “This book is essential for fully understanding all of the work of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Schwaller began his magical/political career as a fascist, trying to work out the dilemma of a people becoming self-empowered, godlike beings yet cooperating in a nationalistic group. He was a member of the Tala, the esoteric core of Les Veilleurs, a group which also included Rudolph Hess and possibly had ties to the Thule Society. When pressure was brought to bear on his group, he emigrated to Egypt and became an advocate of ancient Egyptian wisdom. A couple of notable quotes from the book: ‘Black Magic is a Pandora’s box, not because the practitioner is evil, but because he lacks the “sense of the temple” as safeguard of ideas.’ ‘“Il faut voir cela dans sa nue crudité” was all the moral advice he would ever offer. It implies a free vista of the existing state of affairs, unhindered and unembellished by an artificial code of morals.’ VandenBroeck was Schwaller’s student the last two years of the latter’s life. The book explains the experiment of social alchemy to create empowered individuals: His magical work was an attempt to recreate the pharaonic secret. This is the hidden ground behind Fulcanelli, Lucie Lamy, Bika Reed, John Anthony West, Robert Lawlor, Ronald K. Barrett, and many other transformational elitists in the New Age movement, including the Temple of Set. A great study of the Word Al-Khemi, meaning both the secret of the pharaohs and the method of its attainment.

As a modern-dress version of the Conflict of Horus and Set [but which is which?], this film oscillates between the harshly real and the surreal. Screenplay writer & director Michael Mann (the wizard who brought you Miami Vice) took F. Paul Wilson’s plodding, ‘here-comes-Vlad-the-Impaler-again’ novel and rewrought it into this expressionistic banquet for the senses. One is left wondering, at the end of the film, which one of the dæmon-beings’ influence would have proved better for humanity - that of the tranquil Glenn, who remained aloof and remote from human suffering, or that of his ‘evil’ counterpart, who takes swift and savage vengeance against humans deemed to deserve it - and aids others deemed to deserve that.”F14B.

Unsolved Mysteries of World War II. Castle Communications; P.O. Box 1445; St. Laurent, Quebec H4L-4Z1; Canada; 1992. #UMW-3-4520. MA: “This is a boxed set of six cassettes for about $20, the price possible because the six hours of film are recorded in EP-mode. Neverthess the quality is quite adequate for viewing. Volumes: ‘People & Plots’: (1) The Riddle of Rudolph Hess, The Strange Death of Geli Raubal, Drugs and the Fuehrer. (2) Hitler’s Secret War, Kill Hitler. ‘Battle Mysteries’: (1) Pearl Harbor, The Phantom Invasion. (2) Decision at Dunkirk, Stalin’s Secret Armies. ‘Occult & Secrets’: (1) Hitler’s Secret Weapons, Enigma of the Swastika, Himmler’s Castle. (2) The Eagle and the Swastika, The Last Days of Hitler. These are ‘teaser’ mini-documentaries, not as detailed as #F14E, but often with fascinating facts rarely aired elsewhere - for instance the Allies’ uneven use of Enigma intelligence vs. the Germans’ strange failure to discern the breaking of their codes, some of the most detailed period film footage of the Wewelsburg yet, and the odd German decision to declare war on the USA when American concentration on Japan would have been to German benefit, etc. A ‘food for thought’ item, easily worth its price.”- 10 -"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"F14G. The Empty Mirror. Universal, Lion’s Gate Films, 2000. MA: “Portrayals of Adolf Hitler in postwar films have been inflexibly propagandistic: He is never to be shown as anything other than an ugly, screaming, drooling, and of course insane Orc. TEM is perhaps the first film to at least partially defy this requirement, showing him, at least for part of this film, as a rational, introspective visionary. The film’s title refers to a speculation: What would Hitler, looking back on his career, ‘see in the mirror’? Hitler is played by the British actor Norman Rodway, who not only looks reasonably like AH but represents him responsibly. I am not surprised that this film was an official selection at the Cannes Film Festival, but I am surprised that it was not suppressed altogether. Hurry up and see it before it is.”- 11 -"}]
