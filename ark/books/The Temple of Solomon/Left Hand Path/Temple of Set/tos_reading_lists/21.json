[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temple of Set Reading ListCategory 21: The FutureDie Zukunftas of February 26, 2003MA: An effective magician must be able to move within and influence the fourth dimension as well as the first three. Such skill involves understanding and applying the principles which define and govern past periods of focus within the time-continuum, together with both passive analysis and active manipulation of the future. Time-Magic as employed by the Temple of Set may involve either Greater Black Magic techniques [referred to as Erotic Crystallization Inertia (ECI) techniques by Anton LaVey; see Runes #II-6] or Lesser Black Magic technology. The following selections include some of the more sophisticated futurological thinking in conventional society - as well as a few experiments-gone-wrong from The Outer Limits [“There is nothing wrong with your television set ...”]21A. The Future by Gerald Leinwand (Ed.). NY: Pocket Books #671-80316-6-195, 1976. (TOS-2) MA: “An anthology of selected readings concerning the future, selected by the Dean of the School of Education, City University of New York. Included are articles and extracts by such futurologists as Asimov, Orwell, Huxley, Clarke, Kahn, Reischauer, Toffler, and Skinner. Most of the contributions discuss developments of the near future which can be interpolated more or less reliably, but there are some long-range speculative essays as well. A good introductory work.”21B. The Last Days by Anthony Hunter. London: Anthony Blond Ltd, 1958. (COS-3) AL: “A fairly scarce work from England which explains the workings of the prophets of doom who prey upon their followers’ fears that the world will end, tidal waves, earthquakes, etc.”21C. Mankind at the Turning-Point by Mihajlo Mesarovic and Eduard Pestel. NY: E.P. Dutton & Co., 1974. [Deutschland: Menschheit am Wendepunkt, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, Stuttgart, 1974 (WU: 24/14815)] (TOS-3) MA: “This is the second major book sponsored by the Club of Rome [the first being Meadows’ The Limits to Growth]. It expands upon and updates the data in Limits and responds to critics. Far more sophisticated than the sensationalist ‘doomsday’ books that sprang up following the appearance of Limits (which Raghavan Iyer, author of #16F and a member of the Club of Rome himself, told me was deliberately sensationalized in order to ‘shock’ the public - which of course it did).”21D. War in 2080: The Future of Military Technology by David Langford. NY: William Morrow & Co., 1974. [Deutschland: WU: B-39-249] (TOS-3) MA: “Langford is a physicist and science-fiction devotee [#7D], and he applies his skills in both areas in this excellent work. Topics treated include fission & fusion bombs, concepts of nuclear warfare, death rays (lasers, grasers [gamma-ray lasers], antimatter projectors, particle beams), orbital battlegrounds, geological warfare, ecological warfare, and human & non-human warfare in space. A good theoretical background study for #22N. For a specialized discussion of space warfare probabilities and possibilities, see also Space Weapons/Space War by John W. Macvey (NY: Stein & Day, 1979.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"21E. The Next Ten Thousand Years by Adrian Berry. NY: Mentor Books, 1974. [Deutschland: Die grosse Vision, Econ-Verlag, Düsseldorf, 1975] (TOS-3) MA: “This is definitely long-range! An optimistic challenge to the ‘doomsday’ books that followed Limits to Growth, and a scientific scenario for survival within the Solar System with technological aid. Well-argued, with consideration given to the many influential factors. Nevertheless Berry seems excessively confident in the ability of the masses of humanity to cooperate in egalitarian ‘master plans’.”21F. Foundation/Foundation and Empire/Second Foundation by Isaac Asimov. NY: Avon Books, 1951. [Deutschland: Das galaktische Imperium, Deutscher Bücherbund, Stuttgart, 1981 (WU: 31/11530)] (TOS-4) MA: “Brilliant trilogy of the future, based upon Asimov’s concept of ‘psychohistory’. This concept and others introduced in the text inspired certain aspects in the original design of the Temple of Set. In late 1982 Asimov published a sequel to the original trilogy - Foundation’s Edge - which I reviewed in Scroll of Set #IX-3, which in turn was commented upon by Asimov. The series was merged with Asimov’s robot series [cf. #15D] in Foundation and Earth (NY: Doubleday, 1986), in which the ultimate justification for mankind’s galactic unification is considered to be the eventual invasion of the Milky Way Galaxy by denizens from other galaxies. [Too late, Isaac - see #22N.]”21G. Metropolis by Thea von Harbou. NY: Ace Books #441-52831-125, 1927. (TOS-5) MA: “An Expressionistic portrait of a negative utopia in which humans are controlled by machines - save for one Black Magician (Rotwang). The novel from which Fritz Lang’s classic UFA film was made, and the basis for many electronic/audio-visual ritual techniques employed by the Church of Satan and further developed by the Temple of Set. A King in Yellow of science-fiction, preserved today through the personal efforts of Forrest J Ackerman. To understand Metropolis in the context of German Expressionist cinema, see The Haunted Screen by Lotte E. Eisner (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973). [See #F21A.]”21H. Political Science and the Study of the Future by Albert Somit. Hinsdale, Illinois: Dryden Press, 1974. (TOS-3) MA: “This is a theoretical text with accompanying case studies, and it is primarily valuable for its explanation and illustration of various social forecasting techniques, including: social physics (ideological theories, logistics curves, Kondratieff cycles), economic forecasting, demographic extrapolation, technological change, structural certainties, operational codes, operational systems, structural requisites, overriding problems, prime movers, sequential development, accounting schemes, scenarios, and decision theory. Another good introductory work without social science emphasis is Edward Cornish’s The Study of the Future (Washington, D.C.: World Future Society, 1977).”- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"21I. Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology by K. Eric Drexler. NY: Anchor Books, 1986 (paperback 1987). (TOS-3) Patty Hardy IV°: “Nanotechnology is a fledgling field of engineering that involves manipulation of matter on a molecule-by-molecule basis. This book is addressed to laymen, and ponders the limits of human ability to transform the natural order. This is the science perfected by the Krell in Forbidden Planet. Drexler’s analysis of possible responses to technologies of radical risk, ‘Strategies and Survival’, is worth skimming even if one is not interested in nanotech itself. Setians with training in physics or chemistry may want to seek out the published version of Drexler’s doctoral dissertation. Drexler is a graduate of MIT and a Visiting Scholar at Stanford.”21J. A Quick & Dirty Guide to War by James F. Dunnigan & Austin Bay. NY: William Morrow, 1985+. [Deutschland: WU: B-56-805] (TOS-3) MA: “This heavy-duty paperback is subtitled ‘Briefings on Present and Potential Wars’, and that pretty well sums it up. As depressing as it is to admit, the world continues to move away from international peace and cooperation and closer to a kind of ‘tolerable/continuous state of war’, and - by geographic area - this book provides ‘intelligence briefings’ to tell you what is most likely to hit the fan where [if it isn’t already doing so]. Regularly updated, so look for the latest edition. This project is an attempt by the authors to overcome the short-sightedness of most press coverage, and to tell you about things before they happen. Jammed with facts and data: political forecasting of the most substantive kind.”21K. Futurehype by Max Dublin. NY: Penguin, 1989. (TOS-2) DW: “This book shows not only the short-sightedness of prophecy but its use as a way of ruling institutions. Dublin charts the rise of futurologists and the profound effect prophecy has on politics, business, education, the military, and the health-care system. The Setian has learned not to follow the RHP religious prophet, but also needs to see how futurologists may similarly limit social choices.”* * *F21A. Metropolis. UFA, 1926. (10-2030) Fritz Lang, director. (LVT-5) MA: “See discussion under #21G above.” James Lewis VI°: “Lang’s silent film remains one of the early and best of those with a Black Magician. Rotwang’s machinations are a King in Yellow of the cinema. Audiences then were not prepared for the world with which Rotwang would have replaced their own. Already wages were insufficient for the needs and wants of most; the thought of a robotic army able to take over the city of Metropolis was an unpleasant reminder of that which could happen to themselves. The story ended with the defeat of Rotwang, and all through a chance happening, that of Maria’s escape from his dark old house into the freedom of the city’s streets. Had she not made the escape, the robotrix would have triumphed and it may be that its admirers would have rallied to save her from the angry mob of workers. What could have been makes for intriguing speculation.”- 3 -"}]
