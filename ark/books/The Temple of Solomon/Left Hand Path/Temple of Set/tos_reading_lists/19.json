[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temple of Set Reading ListCategory 19: The MetaMindDer Metamindas of February 26, 2003MA: The Æon of Set heralds the expansion and extension of Elect minds into yet a third stage of intellectual evolution - a point of perspective as far removed from that of mankind as mankind’s is from Pithecanthropus. [No doubt the prospect will seem as incredible to humans as a forecast of their Coming Into Being would have seemed to Pithecanthropus.] Many phenomena casually called “ESP” are in fact the first symptoms of what may be termed the Metamind. Setians should gain an understanding of the human mind’s characteristics, physiology, and potential - then apply Metamental experiments to appropriate situations. “The most exhilarating thing in the world, I think, is the ability of the Setamorphic Metamind to correlate all its contents.”19A. The Philosopher’s Stone by Colin Wilson. NY: Warner Paperback Library #0-446-59213-7, 1974. (TOS-1) MA: “A novel concerning the Metamind - with a Lovecraftian accent. A more intellectual treatment of the theme than Wilson’s better-known #7E [although #7E has a more colorful plot]. An expansion on much of the historical and bibliographical data in #19A may be found in Wilson’s earlier book The Outsider (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1956). Subsequently Wilson wrote #4A and became thoroughly confused when he tried to explain the Metamind as a natural phenomenon.”19B. The Psychology of Man’s Possible Evolution by Peter D. Ouspensky.

If you’re unfamiliar with G., see Gurdjieff by Louis Pauwels (NY: Weiser, 1972). See also the section on G. in #4A.” DW: “This is a great book for Pylons to discuss - one lecture per meeting. For those who catch the Gurdjieff bug, I recommend that they later read Ouspensky’s In Search of the Miraculous (NY: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1949).”19C. The Fourth Way by Peter D. Ouspensky.

(TOS-4) Lee: “To realize freedom, the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vast movement without the bondage of time, for freedom lies beyond the field of consciousness. Watch, but don’t stop and interpret, ‘I am free’ - then you’re living in a memory of something that has gone.

Well-researched and documented. This book is an excellent jumping-off point for further investigations. An especially interesting section describes the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the brain to physical and psychological stimuli or deprivation. In other words, the mind is affected by the body more than most persons realize. This is important to the magician in control both of self and of others.”19F. Physical Control of the Mind: Towards a Psychocivilized Society by José M.R. Delgado, M.D. NY: Harper and Row (Harper Colophon Books), 1969. [Deutschland: Gehirnschrittmacher. Direktinformation durch Elektroden, Ullstein-Verlag, Frankfurt, 1971 (WU: 22/11-115)] (TOS-4) MA: “Delgado, Professor of Physiology at Yale University, is one of the most distinguished authorities in the field of Electrical/chemical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). This book is necessarily dated, but it is so well-written that it deserves to be perused as a preface to more recent works on the subject. In various sections of the text, Delgado discusses ESB techniques and experiments, clinical & psychological applications of ESB, the definition of the mind and ‘soul’ as distinct from the brain, and the many ethical issues involved in such a line of research. For a discussion of the Central Intelligence Agency’s ESB experiments, see Operation Mind Control by W.H. Bowart (NY: Dell #0-44016755-8, 1978).

Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1974. (TOS-4) MA: “Reed is Professor of Psychology at Canada’s York University. This book addresses unusual, irregular, and puzzling experiences - dejá vu, illusions, delusions, hallucinations, etc. - in terms of the mind’s normal psychological processes of gathering, monitoring, processing, and storing information. Drawing from the Existenz of Jaspers (#16B) and others who have stressed the distinction between the form and content of psychological experience, Reed approaches the border between psychology and philosophy. An extremely useful reference text for the magician attempting to identify valid mental vs. Metamental impressions.”19H. The Roots of Coincidence by Arthur Koestler. NY: Vintage Books #V-934, 1972.

To date Psi has not yet been proven to standards of scientific law, but then neither have a great many other interesting and useful phenomena. In their anxiety to gain academic respectability, parapsychologists have been easy victims for the Uri Gellers and other opportunists and fringe-occultists. This book by Koestler cuts through all the confusion and discusses the concepts of telepathy, psychokinesis, precognition, ESP, and clairvoyance in a rational and logical context. Subsections relate the concepts to Einsteinian theories of physics and fields, and to the controversial theories of Lamarck and Kammerer. Selected theories in this book were later tested by Koestler, and the results were compiled as The Challenge of Chance by Alister & Robert Hardie and Koestler (NY: Vintage Books #V-393, 1975). The physical, physiological, philosophical, and metaphysical conclusions drawn by Koestler from his cumulative research are set forth in his Janus: A Summing Up (NY: Random House, 1978), recommended as a complement to the aforementioned earlier works.”- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"19I.

(TOS-4)MA: “During a period of more than forty years, Burr and his colleagues at the Yale University School of Medicine conducted research that indicated the existence of electrodynamic fields surrounding an permeating living entities. Even more interesting was the evidence that these fields can be ‘mapped’, and that changes in the fields can be used for diagnostic purposes. [See also #17F.] #19J is Burr’s own account of his research; it is both more technical and more scholarly than #19I (which is a deliberately sensationalized speculation on the possible implications of the L-field theory). Accordingly #19J may be considered a work of scientific calibre, while #19I is more along the lines of ‘food for thought’. For example, #19I hypothesizes the existence of similar fields for thought (‘T-fields’), which might be a way out of the difficulty of justifying ESP in terms of energy required for electronic transmission. Normal electrical thought impulses are too weak to pass through the skull, much less the air beyond.”19K. The Game of Wizards: Psyche, Science, and Symbol in the Occult by Charles Ponce. Baltimore: Penguin Books #3864, 1975. (TOS-3) MA: “Ponce is a member of the C.G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology [see also #14C]. In this book he attempts to formulate the connection between the human psyche and the ‘occult’, and on the whole he is successful. The reader will note the influence of #19I/J in his methodology. Ponce’s only problem is that he is a neo-Cabalist; hence he hangs himself by one foot from the Tree of Life. His book is interesting and provocative nevertheless.”19L.

This book defines the concept, illustrates its social applications & effects, and evaluates its psychological consequences in a careful, scholarly manner.

Necessarily Pearce investigates the conceptual processes involved in ‘thinking’ and finds that the entire body - not just the ‘roof brain’ - is involved in the process.

This book summarizes and analyzes the findings of his earlier books and reports, and offers practical guidance concerning the construction and use of isolation tanks. Lilly, who along with his work was portrayed in the 1980 film Altered States, comments: ‘In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experientally and experimentally. When the limits are determined, it is found that they are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind, there are no limits. The body imposes definite limits.’”19O. A New Model of the Universe by Peter D. Ouspensky. NY: Alfred A.

He surveys many Eastern and Western cultural traditions, together with modern scientific principles, in an attempt to find common threads. The title of the book is somewhat misleading, because the book does not comprise an integrated argument towards a particular conclusion. [The title is actually that of one of the included essays.] I would recommend #19B and #19C first, after which one will be sufficiently familiar with Ouspensky’s idiom to derive the greatest benefit from his essays.”19P.

Szasz is an M.D. who is motivated by outrage at what he perceives as unethical practices within his profession. In this volume he explains how an initial, tacit decision is made to consider a deviant - as an ‘Other’ (i.e. something less than a ‘normal’ human being), whereupon any social, religious, or humanistic rights that ‘normal’ humans have may be denied him with impunity. Once accorded ‘Other’ status, the unfortunate victim becomes the helpless plaything of the society and its officials. In this sense a medieval person accused of witchcraft, a concentration-camp inmate, and a member of contemporary society declared legally insane are all ‘Others’.

An End to Ordinary History by Michael Murphy. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher [distributed by Houghton Mifflin], 1982. (TOS-4) MA: “Like many other works on this list, this book is an iceberg-tip. The entire field of parapsychological research in the Soviet Union and other communist countries has long lain under a blanket of semi-suppression - not because such research is discredited, but rather because it is considered a potentially vital state secret. Since the publication of Ostrander & Schroeder’s Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain in 1970, there hasn’t been much written outside of obscure technical material [which is fine for the Temple’s archives but inconvenient for individual Setians’ libraries]. #19U is a novel, but derives much of its ‘fiction’ from Murphy’s extensive experience in this field in collaboration with the ‘Transformation Project’, a San Francisco-centered data base of human consciousness evolution.

Nevertheless this is a rather impressively researched and written book, packed with data found nowhere else outside of classified government research reports. McRae analyzes the ‘remote viewing’ experiments conducted amongst much fanfare & big bucks by the Stanford Research Institute [see #2O] and concludes [as I do] that their results are unconvincing. Excellent chapter entitled ‘The Need to Believe’ on wishful thinking concerning Psi phenomena. The debunking of phony psychics like Uri Geller is treated. The chapter on the ‘First Earth Battalion’ is zany; its deletion would have improved the book. There is an excellent 12-page bibliography, listing both classified and unclassified sources.”19X.

It is a tour to leave even the most cynical & suspicious Satanist thoroughly stunned at the calculating ‘machinery’ operating behind the apparently-innocent peace/love movement of the ’60s/’70s. This story does not devalue the genuine idealisms of some of the more visionary and idealistic people described in #4K, but it does show that every silver cloud has its dark lining - to rearrange the aphorism a bit! In this case the lining was/is a very dark one indeed.”19Y. Psychic Warfare: Fact or Fiction? by John White (Ed.). Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: The Aquarian Press, 1988 (ISBN 0-85030-644-2) (Distributed in the U.S. by the Sterling Publishing Company, 2 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016).

White, former Director of Education for the Institute of Nœtic Sciences (an ESP/metaphysics-oriented think-tank loosely affiliated with the Stanford Research Institute [see #2O & #19W] and the Transformation Project [see #19U]), adds concluding chapters of his own dealing with the possible nature of ‘psychic energy’ and the ‘psychic warfare’ attributed to Nazi Germany. White confesses he is no closer to a ‘smoking gun’ of ESP than others who have written on the subject, but he invokes the work of Russell (#19I) and Burr (#19J) as most promising in this direction. A good survey of the current literature in this fascinating field.”19Z. The Philosophy of Horror, or Paradoxes of the Heart by Noel Carroll. NY: Routledge (ISBN 0-415-90216-9), 1990. (TOS-4) MA: “Why is ‘horror’ as a feature of fiction so enduring and appealing? What exactly is it? These are the questions which Carroll, an Associate Professor of Philosophy [and Theater] at Cornell University set out to answer in this complex and precise text. Drawing from ancient Classical tragedies as well as from the latest ‘slasher/gore’ films and novels of the present era, Carroll establishes that this fascination is as much a normal psychological need as an affectation or deviation from the norm.

The Will: Its Nature, Power, and Development by William W. Atkinson. London: L.N. Fowler & Co., 1915. (TOS-3) Leon Wild II°: “Will is a faculty often taken for granted by magicians. Will is more than desire and intent. This book is an introduction fo the development and use of will. The book has an essentially pragmatic ‘new’ psychological basis. The nature of will is discussed, to include desire, decisiveness, and action. The active will (or volition) is the aim of the book’s exercises, which are useful for concentration and visualization development. Atkinson’s will description almost goes as far as GBM, and is certainly useful in LBM concepts, in that the imagination creates patterns or mental molds which the will subsequently causes to manifest. Recognizing and countering negative marks of the will are also discussed.”19AB. Luck by Nicholas Rescher. NY: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1995.

The Psychic Battlefield: A History of the Military-Occult Complex by W. Adam Mandelbaum. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2000 (ISBN 0-312-20955-X). (TOS-3) MA: “A methodical and thoughtful survey of psychological and quasi-parapsychological warfare techniques and experiments during the past 5,000 years. The only weak point of the book is a little too much ‘wishful thinking’ on the subject of ‘remote viewing’, though it can be argued that Mandelbaum is essentially just reporting on what was a long, expensive, and profoundly stupid snipe-hunt by the U.S. government. One section of the ‘Cast of Characters’ chapter deals with ‘one of the darker denizens in the history of the military-occult complex’, Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino.

(LVT-2) MA: “In the middle of the 50s, MGM reared back and produced this first big-budget ‘intellectual’ space opera, drawing from Freudian theories of the ego & id, salted with a bit of Shakespeare’s Tempest, and peppered with the most charming robot since Gort. The design of the spaceship and even the casual uniforms of the crew were all forerunners of the original Star Trek television series. The plot centered around an ancient, highly-civilized race (the Krel), who had succeeded in expanding their mental powers almost to infinity. They were destroyed, however, by the id-monsters of their subconscious minds - a process which Walter Pidgeon, as a human scientist, comes all to close to repeating.” J. Lewis VI°: “Forbidden Planet has deliberate parallels with Shakespeare’s The Tempest. The island is transformed into a planet, the magician Prospero is a scientist living alone on the planet with his daughter, and Ariel has taken on a metallic shell as Robby the Robot. The story is entertaining in its own right; those familiar with The Tempest will find it even more so. For the Setian the greatest lessons in it are those of the power of the mind. Evolution does not cast away those parts of ourselves we now have under control. It takes the darker parts along on the journey and accentuates their power should they be loosened. The Initiate heading for eternity should give Forbidden Planet an evening of his time.”- 7 -"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"F19B. Altered States. 1980.

Lewis VI°: “The question of man’s abnormal mental evolution is one that has puzzled him since the time he began to realize his difference. The question is addressed by the Temple of Set in ‘Genesis III’, in the papers of the Priesthood of Set and the Book of Leviathan. It has also appeared in science-fiction. Doctor Who has shown three such ventures into the question:”F19C1. The Dæmons. “Jon Pertwee’s Doctor entered into The Dæmons to give viewers an action-filled show with a little something for everyone. An ancient barrow, the Devil’s Hump, found near the quaint village of Devil’s End, is being opened by an archæologist. [The gossip center of the village is the pub known as the ‘Cloven Hoof’, appropriately enough.] This Doctor Who story had witchcraft, hypnosis, a Satanic cult headed by Mr. Magister [the Master masquerading as the new rector], the gadgetry of which Pertwee is so fond to this day, and a gigantic creature with cloven hooves, horns, fangs, and the whole nine yards. This dæmon, Azal, stayed behind in 100,000 BCE as a representative of his race, awaiting the day man would become sufficiently advanced to awaken him and allow the dæmon to judge whether mankind had responded to the subtle nudges given him by the dæmons and therefore was fit to rule his planet with the dæmons’ scientific knowledge; or whether the race should be wiped out as a failure. The strategy of the two Time Lords is fascinating to watch. After all, for what purpose did Set instill the Black Flame in man? I doubt he would close his experiment by dropping the entire human race in the rubbish bin as Azal decides to do. No need to; mankind is quite capable of wiping itself and its planet out of existence without the aid of aliens. The Dæmons was released in black and white and is still visually stunning. The rumor among Doctor Who enthusiasts is that there is a color version of the show out there somewhere, last known to be at some undisclosed location in Canada.”F19C2. Image of the Fendahl. “‘Like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread, and having turned once, turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread.’ That charming little piece of poetry by Coleridge formed the beginning of the Fendahl script, a science-fiction/horror story commencing with the murder of a hiker by an unknown monster in a dark wood and proceeding to a study being done on an ancient human skull unearthed in Kenya in 1984 CE, an inverse pentagram making up a congenital anomaly in its makeup. The secrets of the skull unfold as the Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela discover it to be a link with the Fendahl, an æons-old force which lives through absorbing life and is therefore the personification of death. The suggestion in the story is that the Fendahl bred a certain genius in man to enable him to eventually grow so sophisticated as to open the gates for the force. This is another of the shows complete with it all: witchcraft, one of the explanations of ESP, an evil cult at work in the midst of it all, and the Doctor working to save mankind as those he seeks to help go out of their way in their attempts to kill him. Image of the Fendahl is a story which deviates from the reasons we suspect man to have the Gift of the Black Flame, but it does explore via fiction the darker alternatives.”- 8 -"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"F19C3. The City of Death. “The explosion of a Jagaroth spaceship on the prehistoric planet Earth of 400,000,000 BCE splinters its pilot, Scaroth, into identical selves who are scattered throughout time. Each self is in contact with the others, and each strives to push the advancement of mankind up to a point at which, like the other two parallel shows, the alien can benefit from the upward leaps. In the case of Scaroth, the goal is to finally bring about men of intelligence sufficient to create a time machine which will allow him to return to the original disaster and halt it. The Doctor (Tom Baker) stops the Jagaroth pilot, but only just in the nick of time; had he succeeded in reversing his original mistake, man would never have evolved from the primeval soup affected by the radiation released on the ship’s explosion. In The City of Death, Image of the Fendahl, and The Dæmons, there was a common theme: An outside intelligence altered the genetic makeup of that which would become man, and for a definite reason. Only Azal is clinical about the task and so comes closest to Set’s own plans. The obligatory threat to mankind would have left viewers with an uneasy feeling of incompleteness in its absence.”F19D.

Dutton, 1969), this deals with G.’s trek through Asia and Africa in search of Truth. It reveals many things and is worth repeated viewings. Of special note is the concept of resonance in the scene of the singing contest, and the old Persian metaphor of ‘going to Egypt’, which means working through mastery of this world as one’s first test.
