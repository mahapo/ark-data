[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Temple of Set Reading ListCategory 23: Lesser Black MagicNiedrigere Schwarze Magieas of February 26, 2003MA: There are Lesser Black Magical principles to be found throughout this reading list, to be sure, but there are also works which focus primarily or principally on the concept or technique itself. LBM is defined and discussed in “Black Magic” in the Crystal Tablet of Set, and generally embraces what ordinary human minds conceive as “magic”. Hence this category begins with four books on stage-magic, which will (a) enable the Setian to satisfy those who ask to “see some magic”, and (b) offer the Setian excellent training in the basic techniques of attention control and behavior & attitude manipulation so crucial to more serious applications of LBM. Following the stage-magic works are books dealing with the social environment so conducive to LBM operations. Setians are advised to pursue active operations of LBM only after they have schooled themselves in the relevant ethical fields as treated in category 16.* * * * *DW: LBM shouldn’t be used as the first resort in any situation, when reason and courtesy can be used instead. The Black Magician, a one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind, must likewise learn not to become a Cyclops. However the ability to amaze and delight your friends is a primary art of the magician.23A. The Great Book of Magic by Wendy Rydell with George Gilbert. NY: Harry N. Abrams, 1976. [Deutschland: Das grosse Buch der magischen Kunst, Lichtenberg Verlag, München, 1978 (WU: 28a/3505)] (TOS-2) MA: “There are a great many stage-magical manuals on the market, but I have recommended this one because it fills a great many requirements: It is a large, well-printed, clearly illustrated, quality paperback. It is reasonably priced ($10). It contains instructions for over 150 very effective tricks and an excellent introduction (the first half of the book) dealing with the history and major personalities of stage-magic, with major sections on the Black Arts [with rare photos of the Church of Satan’s Central & Lilith Grottos in 1972].”23B. Thirteen Steps to Mentalism by Corinda. NY: Louis Tannen, 1967. (TOS-3) MA: “This and #23C are the recognized classic texts in the stage-magic art of mentalism. It is one of the more difficult fields to master, but it is also one of the most impressive - even frightening - to use in a non-entertainment setting. The same principles used for these mentalism tricks can be adapted to a great many LBM situations. Both this and #23C are usually stock items in stage-magic shops. Despite this, it is surprising how few people read the books, hence know their secrets.”23C. Practical Mental Effects by Theodore Anneman. NY: Tannen Magic, 1963. (TOS-3) MA: “The second classic in the mentalism field. Since it is a reprint of a 1944 work, I would recommend #23B as being more clearly printed and in general easier to read. But either work is excellent from a technical standpoint.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"23D. The 1985-86 Magic Directory by Christopher Monson (Publisher). Monson Productions, P.O. Box 5324, Madison, WI 53705. (TOS-3) MA: “This is a magazine-size, annually-revised paperback directory of almost every store, association, publication, company, club, and venture associated with stage-magic. It is subdivided into state and national sections, as well as English and foreign-language sections. There is nothing else quite like it. Even if you are not a stage-magic devotee, it is a good book to toss into your suitcase when traveling, since local magic shops are always good points of interest and contact in unfamiliar areas. [And many of them, particularly in Europe, are impressive mini-museums as well.]”23E. The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli. NY: Washington Square Press, 1963. [Deutschland: Der Fürst, Kröner Verlag, Stuttgart, 1955 (WU: Z49-235)] (TOS-3) MA: “You’ll find a summary of The Prince in #16A, but if you’re going to get seriously involved in the social jungle, you should probably read the book itself, since it is still the classic of practical power politics. A short, succinct work written in a crisp, no-nonsense style. Nevertheless it is not, as the vulgar assume, an argument for viciousness or callousness in political affairs, but is predicated upon the prince’s underlying ethical goals for his country.”23F. The B.S. Factor: The Theory and Technique of Faking It in America by Arthur Herzog. NY: Simon & Schuster, 1973. (TOS-2) MA: “In Machiavelli’s day the world was sufficiently lawless to make force a viable alternative in day-to-day affairs. In a highly ordered nation such as the United States, however, manipulation must often take more subtle and psychological forms. This book is one of the best analyses of them. It focuses on the twisting and warping of language to mold opinions and behavior. Written humorously, but with serious underlying principles.”23G. A Primer of Politics by James E. Combs and Dan Nimmo. NY: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1984. (TOS-3) MA: “A political science textbook dealing with the study of power according to the definitions, maxims, and recommendations of Machiavelli. Individuals, episodes, organizations, governments, and ideologies from ancient times to the present are offered as case studies. Mini-biographies of the various political leaders used in the case studies are included, with the result that this book reads like an anthology of dramatic episodes in the shaping of history - which in a way it is. Some leaders treated: Walter Lippman, Jefferson, Catherine the Great, Charles de Gaulle, Hitler, Madison, Madame de Pompadour, Disraeli, John Marshall, Elizabeth I, Eva Peron, Gandhi, Richard III, Mao, Cicero, Lincoln, FDR, Richelieu, Bismarck, Jackson, J. Edgar Hoover, Henry II, Tallyrand, Lenin, Goebbels, Stalin, Augustus Cæsar, and Nicholas II. Whenever I have prescribed this text for a Political Theory course, students have gone wild over it, reading far more than assigned and using its concepts as a knife to cut through the jungle of doubletalk, deceit, hypocrisy, and inertia of modern political society. A book for the 1980s - in some ways regrettably so.”- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"23H. The Hidden Dimension by Edward T. Hall. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Co., 1966. [Deutschland: Die Sprache des Raumes, Pädagogischer Verlag, Düsseldorf, 1976 (WU: 26/8627)] (TOS-3) MA: “The best study to date of ‘proxemics’ - the LBM technique involving, in the author’s words, ‘social and personal space and man’s perception of it’. Included are both a discussion of the principles involved in the design, control, and manipulation of proxemics, and a number of case studies - several ethnic and/or national/cultural in orientation - illustrating these principles. #23H is reviewed in Runes #III-4.”23I. Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In by Roger Fisher and William Ury. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1981 (Penguin paperback edition available). [Deutschland: WU: 33/8696] (TOS-3) MA: “This is a succinct (160 pages) manual on how to win arguments, particularly in a group or organizational setting. The step-by-step process results from studies and conferences by the Harvard Negotiation Project, a group which deals continually with various levels of conflict resolution. This is a book which raises what for most people is a ‘blind, stumbling’ (Pistis) experience to a deliberate, controlled (Dianoia) exercise.”23J. Success with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1990. (TOS-1) Rosemary Webb III°: “This volume of Dr. Elgin’s ‘Gentle Art’ series summarizes her first five books. An example of LBM techniques, that is to say metacommunication applicable to long-term successes in the business world. Useful to teach the magician the difference between her purposes and the reactive environment. Unlike most NLP manuals, this book doesn’t serve as a hook to get you to buy more NLP manuals. Its TOS-1 rating reflects both ease of readability and broadness of topics covered.”23K. Class by Paul Fussell. NY: Random House, 1983. (TOS-3) DW: “This slightly dated tome teaches both the reading and the presentation of economic class - a key to achieving metacommunication. The Black Magician is free from the social taboos that ‘politically correct’ society insists upon, and can use those taboos to his advantage while exploring the positive and negative effects they have had on his own life.”* * *F23A. Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. Viacom Enterprises. (LVT-4) James Lewis VI°: “This film never really made it big in the theatre circuit and taken overall, viewers can see why. The performances of Cher, Karen Black, and the others are good, but for the Order of Leviathan member the outstanding theme is that of watching an attempt at Magic gone awry because of what amounts to a religion built on a lie. If you have passed this by in the video store because of the title, give it a chance and see a cinematic rendition of the dangers of Black Magic.”- 3 -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F23B. The Adventures of Baron von Munchausen. Prominent Features & Laura-film Productions, a Terry Gilliam film, fantasy fiction. (LVT-2) James Lewis VI°: “The Village Voice reviewed this movie as ‘No great job of storytelling, this movie is disjointed, exhausting, and overloaded with flamboyant bric-a-brac. It needed a slow movement. Yet how many films these days can be faulted for excess of riches? At his best, Gilliam seems the most legitimate heir to Melies working today.’ With all due respect to reviewers, the magic with which the Baron weaves the subjective into the objective world is worth the viewing time of the Setian. Imagery is an important tool for the Magician and few have the skills and adaptability of the old Baron.”- 4 -"}]
