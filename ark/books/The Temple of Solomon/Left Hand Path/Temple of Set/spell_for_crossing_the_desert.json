[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Spell for Crossing the Desertby SetnaktThe Divine formula of Xepera Xeper Xeperu, whose physical form had entered theconsciousness of Magus Aquino from Budge's Egyptian Language, had as its most recentform before Budge a spell of Slaying Apep and Knowing the Manifestations of Re, writtenthe same year that Alexander the Great died. An earlier form of the spell appears on a statueof Ramses III, second Pharaoh of the XXth dynasty, in which Ramses III is depicted as thegod Khepher. The image of Khepher exists at a shrine in the eastern desert, which travelerswould stop at before attempting a crossing to the East. Ramses III is a significant figureamong Setian emperors, because he is described in the Great Harris Papyrus as Xu thenruast ast a ari-f em suten (Translated as \"He did many glorious things and mighty deeds asHigh Priest). This phrase was incorporated in the Book of Coming Forth by Night todescribe Anton La Vey, and providing a Hidden link to the Xepera Xeper Xeperu formula.The spell is not intended for illustrative purposes, although it does illustrate the myth ofCreation. It was an operative spell for survival across the expanse of the desert. This is aninteresting moment. You are leaving behind the Known and are entering the Unknown. TheKnown is the divine land of Khem, before you the Unknown desert with its mirages,bandits, scorpions, sandstorms, etc. Beyond that are the foreign lands ruled by Set. What doyou say as a charm? Not a prayer to Set, whose lands you were entering. Not a prayer to thefamiliar gods of Egypt. No, a statement of one's Coming Into Being as the Creator. Nowwhy would this be protective? Or more to the point, what was being protected?The answer is that it is not protective of the body. It's not a prayer for rain, nor a cantripfor food, nor a conjuration against desert brigands. It is for the soul. The smart traveler hasalready taken care of the body's needs in the proper realm. They've stored food and water;they've sharpened their swords. But now they pause -- at the edge of the Unknown -- tostrengthen their mind/soul. They are going into a realm where they may lose their purpose--even die in a distracted manner. What better time than using the urgency of an upcomingstruggle to Work for the immortalization of the mind/soul?We too could benefit from the example. As Setians we are constantly seeking difficultexperiences -- our semidivine nature requires us to disturb the Cosmos. So where and whendo we use the divine formula Xepera Xeper Xeperu? It becomes an operant formula when itused for the perpetuation and furtherance of the subjective universe. It won't give you waterin the desert, but Understanding it will help you gain the strength of mind to remember topack your water. It won't save your body from bad strategy, but it can change the likelihoodof your surviving the body's demise. This was its original magical use, and is still itsmagical use. It operatively connects the Setian to two points of reference. The eternal pointof reference, that realm where such concepts as Justice and Beauty exist -- and of the factthat you partake of that realm since you can conceive of these concepts. The other point isthe everchanging world of time, where you can see the effect that your Coming Into beinghas had. Like the ageless Intelligence of the universe, you can interact with either realm,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and you are in a place of your own making between them. You dwell in this borderland atall times -- but one of the best magical opportunities to explore this threshold is when youare on the threshold. Freedom and Responsibility (which are the conscious forms of Chaosand Order) swirl around you. All is made new and the decisions you take shape the future --yet your only guide is the wisdom you've squeezed from your past. What a wonderfulmoment to pause and fill yourself with the words Xepera Xeper Xeperu. I have Come Intobeing and by my Coming Into Being the way of Coming Into being has Come Into being! Itreminds you of the importance of the present as shaping the future. It reminds you of yourforce of being which has created all of your knowledge of your past. It actively takes yourpast, present, and future and Creates from them a gate to the Eternal. It takes from theEternal and makes a gate for its manifestation through your life, which is afterall themagical link for the Great Work.Pause at the threshold, touch the Real, and move on. There's a Universe waiting."}]
