Zappitelli III°- by Ricco A. Zappitelli III°In Egypt and ancient Greece psychology In Egypt and ancient Greece psychology [defined by [defined by Webster’sWebster’s as “the science dealing with as “the science dealing with the mind and mental and emotional processes”] the mind and mental and emotional processes”] originally existed in a form known as the Mysteries, originally existed in a form known as the Mysteries, but later split into several fragmented forms, among but later split into several fragmented forms, among them alchemy, magic, masonry, occultism, and them alchemy, magic, masonry, occultism, and Theosophy.Theosophy.The important thing to note from this historical The important thing to note from this historical information was that the ancient form of the study information was that the ancient form of the study of man’s behavior was reduced from the “all-of man’s behavior was reduced from the “all-encompassing” school of Mysteries to specialized encompassing” school of Mysteries to specialized parts, making comprehension of the whole almost parts, making comprehension of the whole almost an impossibility.an impossibility.Today the two systems of psychology as they Today the two systems of psychology as they exist are (1) the study of man as he is imagined or exist are (1) the study of man as he is imagined or thought to be - a system based upon man’s being thought to be - a system based upon man’s being asleep, and (2) the study of man from the point of asleep, and (2) the study of man from the point of view of his view of his possiblepossible evolution - a system based on evolution - a system based on man’s awakening.man’s awakening.An acceptance of the former system (placing An acceptance of the former system (placing rest and preservation as ultimate goals) can only rest and preservation as ultimate goals) can only bring about stagnation, whereas pursuance of the bring about stagnation, whereas pursuance of the latter (placing change and creating above all, or latter (placing change and creating above all, or XeperXeper) is our concern.) is our concern.I give to you my great pentagram ... and it is I give to you my great pentagram ... and it is shown inverse that creation and change be shown inverse that creation and change be exalted above rest and preservation.exalted above rest and preservation.The first step toward this evolution must be The first step toward this evolution must be brought about by brought about by effortsefforts of a of a controlledcontrolled kind in an kind in an observantobservant state.

[Ouspensky defines this as a “school”.] This I feel [Ouspensky defines this as a “school”.] This I feel is one of the most valuable functions of the Temple is one of the most valuable functions of the Temple of Set and its pylons - to afford a vehicle to aid of Set and its pylons - to afford a vehicle to aid towards the individual’s total possible expansion towards the individual’s total possible expansion toward the goal of toward the goal of XeperXeper. I can’t help but feel . I can’t help but feel without this “school” our individual evolution, [and without this “school” our individual evolution, [and thus the Temple’s evolution] would be slower and thus the Temple’s evolution] would be slower and more arduous to bring about.more arduous to bring about.There are several reasons I can see why we There are several reasons I can see why we could be obstructed from further growth.

After coming to . After coming to terms with ourselves, as it were, and deciding we in terms with ourselves, as it were, and deciding we in fact fact dodo want this evolution, the magician must (1) want this evolution, the magician must (1) develop the dormant powers he presently considers develop the dormant powers he presently considers himself as already having to their fullest potential, himself as already having to their fullest potential, then (2) work on developing these powers further to then (2) work on developing these powers further to the point of acquiring new facilities and powers the point of acquiring new facilities and powers which presently they don’t possess and under which presently they don’t possess and under “normal” circumstances could never have, and “normal” circumstances could never have, and finally (3) elevate the self to the “all-finally (3) elevate the self to the “all-encompassing” prospective of “higher man” or, as encompassing” prospective of “higher man” or, as defined by the philosophy of Nietzsche, the defined by the philosophy of Nietzsche, the “superman”.“superman”.This concept of higher self is an important step I This concept of higher self is an important step I feel toward our progress of Setamorphosis to be feel toward our progress of Setamorphosis to be attained through higher consciousness.attained through higher consciousness.What exactly is consciousness?What exactly is consciousness?Such easy questions I’m frequently asked!
