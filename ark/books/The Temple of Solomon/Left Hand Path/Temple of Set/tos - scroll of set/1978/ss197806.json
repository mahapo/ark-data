The recent resignation letters of Richard Murad and Howard Sinnott have prompted Richard Murad and Howard Sinnott have prompted me to explore this entire situation in greater depth me to explore this entire situation in greater depth from magical and philosophical perspectives.

As a result I believe I have been able to identify the major result I believe I have been able to identify the major factors involved.factors involved.Historically the roots appear to lie in the Church Historically the roots appear to lie in the Church of Satan and conflict resulting from “inner” and of Satan and conflict resulting from “inner” and “outer” teachings. At the level of the public and the “outer” teachings.

The Church of Satan, in other words, attempted to have its cake and eat it too other words, attempted to have its cake and eat it too by appealing to both a popular movement and an by appealing to both a popular movement and an inner elite.

Upon Astral/Telepathic Experiment (C.A.T.E.). Upon release of the analysis of our separate accounts, I release of the analysis of our separate accounts, I hope to be able to write a short note about it for hope to be able to write a short note about it for ScrollScroll publication, with the help of Priestess publication, with the help of Priestess Huddleston and others. Let me reiterate that Huddleston and others. Let me reiterate that telepathic communication - a perceptive sort of telepathic communication - a perceptive sort of talking that far outclasses the verbal type - can be talking that far outclasses the verbal type - can be accomplished by direct, conscious effort of Setian accomplished by direct, conscious effort of Setian will!will!You may ask: “But how do I learn to develop You may ask: “But how do I learn to develop my telepathy and how is it connected to Set and the my telepathy and how is it connected to Set and the Temple?”Temple?”The latter question should be answered by now.
