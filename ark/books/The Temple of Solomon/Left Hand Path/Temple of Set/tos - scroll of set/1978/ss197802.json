Most various aspects of our lives depicted in circles. Most of what we usually consider to be mandalas are of what we usually consider to be mandalas are Buddhist in origin, but the rose windows of the Buddhist in origin, but the rose windows of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, the ceiling of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, the ceiling of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Wheel of Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Wheel of Fortune in the Tarot, and the Earth as seen from the Fortune in the Tarot, and the Earth as seen from the Moon are also examples of mandalas, for they are Moon are also examples of mandalas, for they are circular, pictorial representations of one or more circular, pictorial representations of one or more aspects of our lives.

They have left me with a feeling of incompleteness. They are two-dimensional, and life - as we all know - is are two-dimensional, and life - as we all know - is multi-dimensional. Just as the magician’s circle multi-dimensional. Just as the magician’s circle could not keep out the Devil who could enter from could not keep out the Devil who could enter from above or below, we go up and down as well as in above or below, we go up and down as well as in and out in a past and a future.and out in a past and a future.Trying to depict a true Setian mandala begins Trying to depict a true Setian mandala begins with our Pentagram. Our pentagram-within-a-circle with our Pentagram. Our pentagram-within-a-circle is a mandala, as it is a circular representation of our is a mandala, as it is a circular representation of our lives. It depicts the beginning of our progress on the lives. It depicts the beginning of our progress on the path to path to XeperXeper by being empty, and it will depict the by being empty, and it will depict the end of our path as it becomes full. The end of our path as it becomes full. The Sutra Telling Sutra Telling the Heart of the Great Transcending Wisdomthe Heart of the Great Transcending Wisdom, a rite , a rite of the Bubastis Pylon based on a Buddhist text, of the Bubastis Pylon based on a Buddhist text, begins:begins:When the Elect One was freely traveling in When the Elect One was freely traveling in transcending wisdom, he clearly saw that the transcending wisdom, he clearly saw that the five points of the Pentagram were empty, and five points of the Pentagram were empty, and crossed over them with no distress.crossed over them with no distress.The The SutraSutra later proclaims: “Form is nothing but later proclaims: “Form is nothing but emptiness, and emptiness is nothing but form. Form emptiness, and emptiness is nothing but form. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.”is emptiness; emptiness is form.”But the Pentagram itself is still two-dimensional, But the Pentagram itself is still two-dimensional, and life has many dimensions, many directions. and life has many dimensions, many directions. How to solve this dilemma of turning the Pentagram How to solve this dilemma of turning the Pentagram into a multi-dimensional representation of our into a multi-dimensional representation of our Setian lives and Path has taken up quite a bit of my Setian lives and Path has taken up quite a bit of my time over the past year and a half, and this is what time over the past year and a half, and this is what I’ve come up with:I’ve come up with:The Setian Mandala, as I visualize it, is a double The Setian Mandala, as I visualize it, is a double cone, which we ascend or descend along a path cone, which we ascend or descend along a path which, when viewed from above or below, would which, when viewed from above or below, would appear to be a Pentagram.appear to be a Pentagram.The bottom half of this double cone is depicted The bottom half of this double cone is depicted by Michelangelo’s “Man” in a pentagram with one by Michelangelo’s “Man” in a pentagram with one point up. It represents our lives on a merely human point up. It represents our lives on a merely human plane, from birth to the time when we evolve through plane, from birth to the time when we evolve through the juncture of the two cones as Setians. The stages the juncture of the two cones as Setians. The stages in this cone can be represented by the Fibonacci in this cone can be represented by the Fibonacci Series: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ...Series: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ...If we think of our birth as the first “1” in this If we think of our birth as the first “1” in this series, as orientals do [not without some logic], and series, as orientals do [not without some logic], and the other numbers as chronological ages, the the other numbers as chronological ages, the relationship becomes more clear. All of us know the relationship becomes more clear. All of us know the “terrible twos”; a child first becomes aware of his “terrible twos”; a child first becomes aware of his relationship to the world at about age 8, reaches relationship to the world at about age 8, reaches puberty at about 13, becomes adult at 21 [despite puberty at about 13, becomes adult at 21 [despite our laws], reaches middle age at about 35, and so our laws], reaches middle age at about 35, and so on.on.Somewhere between 21 and 34 we either Somewhere between 21 and 34 we either become Setian or remain in the bottom cone, become Setian or remain in the bottom cone, regressing downward to senility or death, at which regressing downward to senility or death, at which point there again is no existence.point there again is no existence.[Illustration: Pentagram of Set within circle: [Illustration: Pentagram of Set within circle: “The Basic Setian Mandala”]“The Basic Setian Mandala”]The bottom cone, as I visualize it, is clear. There The bottom cone, as I visualize it, is clear. There is nothing there to grasp at for life and survival. is nothing there to grasp at for life and survival. Again “Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.”Again “Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.”The upper cone is depicted by our Setian The upper cone is depicted by our Setian Pentagram, representing here the Setian aspect of Pentagram, representing here the Setian aspect of our lives as well as our Path toward our lives as well as our Path toward XeperXeper, which is , which is infinity on the Fibonacci Series. At the narrow end infinity on the Fibonacci Series. At the narrow end the upper cone is colored white, progressing the upper cone is colored white, progressing through red, black, blue, purple, and other colors through red, black, blue, purple, and other colors until the color of until the color of XeperXeper is reached - the “Color Out is reached - the “Color Out of Space” for lack of a better description. If “form of Space” for lack of a better description. If “form is emptiness and emptiness form”, color is is emptiness and emptiness form”, color is colorlessness and colorlessness is color.colorlessness and colorlessness is color.The Setian progresses through the cones’ The Setian progresses through the cones’ juncture between the ages of 21 and 34 in a process juncture between the ages of 21 and 34 in a process analogous to the Christian parable of passing analogous to the Christian parable of passing through the eye of a needle. It is not easy, and only through the eye of a needle. It is not easy, and only a few succeed; but once a person a few succeed; but once a person hashas passed passed through this juncture, he or she is forever Setian, through this juncture, he or she is forever Setian, whether within or without the Temple of Set, unless whether within or without the Temple of Set, unless a conscious effort is made to return to the bottom a conscious effort is made to return to the bottom cone.cone.[Some enter our Temple who are not Setian.
