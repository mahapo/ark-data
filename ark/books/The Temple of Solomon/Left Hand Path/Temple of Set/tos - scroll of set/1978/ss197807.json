This past year the expectations were a bit premature. This past year the momentum of the Temple was interrupted by two momentum of the Temple was interrupted by two unfortunate incidents.unfortunate incidents.In November our first Executive Director, Priest In November our first Executive Director, Priest William F. Murray, experienced an emotional and William F. Murray, experienced an emotional and physical breakdown, necessitating his resignation physical breakdown, necessitating his resignation from office, retirement from the Priesthood, and from office, retirement from the Priesthood, and convalescence under medical supervision.convalescence under medical supervision.Twenty-four hours after Murray’s breakdown, Twenty-four hours after Murray’s breakdown, Magister Robert Ethel, Chairman of the Council of Magister Robert Ethel, Chairman of the Council of Nine, resigned from the Temple to form an Nine, resigned from the Temple to form an organization of his own. After trying unsuccessfully organization of his own. After trying unsuccessfully to get me to turn my back on the I°/II° Initiates and to get me to turn my back on the I°/II° Initiates and Priesthood of the Temple and cooperate with him, Priesthood of the Temple and cooperate with him, Ethel suddenly reversed himself. He leveled charges Ethel suddenly reversed himself. He leveled charges of corruption at me, sneered at the Temple and of corruption at me, sneered at the Temple and Priesthood whose care and guardianship he had Priesthood whose care and guardianship he had accepted only four months earlier [upon accepted only four months earlier [upon reappointment to the Council Chairmanship], and reappointment to the Council Chairmanship], and endeavored to lure personal friends into his new endeavored to lure personal friends into his new group with promises of higher titles than they had group with promises of higher titles than they had been able to attain within the Temple.been able to attain within the Temple.Ultimately two Priests - Roland Holt and Ultimately two Priests - Roland Holt and Howard Sinnott - opted to follow Ethel, as did about Howard Sinnott - opted to follow Ethel, as did about six or seven I°/II° Setians who believed his six or seven I°/II° Setians who believed his accusations. A few other Temple Initiates, accusations. A few other Temple Initiates, presumably dismayed by the very fact of the crisis, presumably dismayed by the very fact of the crisis, have since resigned from the Temple without have since resigned from the Temple without affirming a position one way or the other.affirming a position one way or the other.In terms of numbers the schism affected the In terms of numbers the schism affected the Temple very little, but the Temple has never Temple very little, but the Temple has never measured itself in terms of numbers. measured itself in terms of numbers. Psychologically the damage was serious. The Psychologically the damage was serious. The reputations of the Priesthood, the Masters of the reputations of the Priesthood, the Masters of the Temple, and the Council as groups of high integrity Temple, and the Council as groups of high integrity and impeccable motives were shaken. My own and impeccable motives were shaken. My own ethics and credentials as High Priest of Set and a ethics and credentials as High Priest of Set and a Magus V° were attacked not partially, but with Magus V° were attacked not partially, but with venom as sudden as it was extreme.venom as sudden as it was extreme.It would have been a farcical situation save for It would have been a farcical situation save for Ethel’s high degree and office, and for the Ethel’s high degree and office, and for the unfamiliarity of many of our newer Initiates with the unfamiliarity of many of our newer Initiates with the actual facts. In the resulting confusion the Council actual facts. In the resulting confusion the Council and I were forced to state, restate, and document the and I were forced to state, restate, and document the truth to such an extent that many of our other truth to such an extent that many of our other projects and responsibilities came virtually to a projects and responsibilities came virtually to a standstill for the ensuing eight months. At this standstill for the ensuing eight months. At this writing I think we’ve cleaned up the bulk of the writing I think we’ve cleaned up the bulk of the damage and deceit attempted by Ethel and Holt, damage and deceit attempted by Ethel and Holt, although I understand a few more Setians are still although I understand a few more Setians are still being propagandized.being propagandized.Why did something like this happen to the Why did something like this happen to the Temple? More importantly, what can we learn from Temple?

As it began to grow beyond the Church of Satan. As it began to grow beyond the scope of a San Francisco organization, it too scope of a San Francisco organization, it too encountered revolts and attempted schisms. At first encountered revolts and attempted schisms. At first Anton LaVey rode through these as fairly as he Anton LaVey rode through these as fairly as he could. But, as there seemed to be no end to the could. But, as there seemed to be no end to the incidents, he grew increasingly cynical and incidents, he grew increasingly cynical and disillusioned, first about the integrity of the C/S as disillusioned, first about the integrity of the C/S as an organization and then about the sanctity of the an organization and then about the sanctity of the degree system. He spoke more and more about the degree system. He spoke more and more about the necessity to evaluate Satanism as a “movement”, necessity to evaluate Satanism as a “movement”, not as an institution, and of the failure of the degree-not as an institution, and of the failure of the degree-system to draw meaningful distinctions among system to draw meaningful distinctions among individuals.individuals.To make it more difficult for incidents to spread To make it more difficult for incidents to spread beyond a local level, Anton severely curtailed beyond a local level, Anton severely curtailed conclaves, inter-member communications, and conclaves, inter-member communications, and local/regional publications. Finally, in May of X, he local/regional publications.

All funds have been system of checks and balances. All funds have been kept in corporate savings and checking accounts kept in corporate savings and checking accounts requiring multiple signatures for transaction, and the requiring multiple signatures for transaction, and the legalizing of the Temple as a California non-profit legalizing of the Temple as a California non-profit corporation was accomplished to make it just that corporation was accomplished to make it just that much more difficult for someone to abuse it or much more difficult for someone to abuse it or exploit it.exploit it.[Complete sets of the Articles of Incorporation [Complete sets of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are provided to every III°, and every and By-Laws are provided to every III°, and every Setian is welcome to view them.] Finally since our Setian is welcome to view them.] Finally since our inception we have endeavored to maintain a climate inception we have endeavored to maintain a climate of openness and trust that would inhibit cliques and of openness and trust that would inhibit cliques and predatory factions from gaining a foothold.predatory factions from gaining a foothold.The effectiveness of these various safeguards The effectiveness of these various safeguards can be seen, I think, both in the way in which the can be seen, I think, both in the way in which the Ethel schism developed and in the operational Ethel schism developed and in the operational profile of the Temple itself during and after the profile of the Temple itself during and after the crisis. Although he was Chairman of the Council, a crisis. Although he was Chairman of the Council, a position with, among other things, the power to position with, among other things, the power to remove a corrupt High Priest from office, Ethel remove a corrupt High Priest from office, Ethel could not have established credibility for false could not have established credibility for false charges among a majority of the Nine [who would charges among a majority of the Nine [who would have had to confirm any such action of his by vote]. have had to confirm any such action of his by vote]. Hence the Chairman’s office, although powerful Hence the Chairman’s office, although powerful enough to protect the Temple against an enough to protect the Temple against an incompetent/megalomaniac High Priest, is useless incompetent/megalomaniac High Priest, is useless as a platform from which to stage a “palace revolt”.as a platform from which to stage a “palace revolt”.Ethel’s only option was to disassociate himself Ethel’s only option was to disassociate himself completely from the checks and balances of the completely from the checks and balances of the Temple structure, placing himself in a position in Temple structure, placing himself in a position in which he would be responsible only to himself. And which he would be responsible only to himself. And that is what he did. Although he announced that his that is what he did. Although he announced that his O.I.P. would be governed by a council, it would be O.I.P. would be governed by a council, it would be as toothless as the old Church of Satan Council of as toothless as the old Church of Satan Council of Nine - at most a group of favored advisors who Nine - at most a group of favored advisors who would have no institutional or legal power to would have no institutional or legal power to challenge or overrule Ethel’s desires.challenge or overrule Ethel’s desires.Because the Temple By-Laws specify Because the Temple By-Laws specify procedures for the replacement of all officials, procedures for the replacement of all officials, designation of a new Chairman of the Council and designation of a new Chairman of the Council and Executive Director was orderly and systematic.
