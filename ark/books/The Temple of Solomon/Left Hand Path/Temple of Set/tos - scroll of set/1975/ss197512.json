This radiation became partially radiation. This radiation became partially transformed into equal amounts of matter and transformed into equal amounts of matter and antimatter. The particles thus formed began to draw antimatter. The particles thus formed began to draw toward each other, and toward a center. During this toward each other, and toward a center. During this process, particles of matter met other particles of process, particles of matter met other particles of matter and fused yielding larger bodies of matter. matter and fused yielding larger bodies of matter.

When Set is energy, HarWer is matter/antimatter, and vice versa.HarWer is matter/antimatter, and vice versa.The Universe is basically ordered, but there are The Universe is basically ordered, but there are certain things that disrupt this order [we will not certain things that disrupt this order [we will not even consider mankind!]. The existence of even consider mankind!]. The existence of antimatter (anti-particles) in a system composed antimatter (anti-particles) in a system composed entirely of matter is one such disruption. Hence entirely of matter is one such disruption.

No! By Contradiction of our above statements? No! By means of explanation let us define “order”. means of explanation let us define “order”. According to Funk and Wagnall’s According to Funk and Wagnall’s Standard Standard Encyclopedic DictionaryEncyclopedic Dictionary, “order” is defined as “a , “order” is defined as “a condition in which there is a methodical, proper, or condition in which there is a methodical, proper, or harmonious arrangement of things”. We shall harmonious arrangement of things”. We shall discount “methodical” and “proper” and concern discount “methodical” and “proper” and concern ourselves with “harmonious”.ourselves with “harmonious”.The same source defines “harmonious” as The same source defines “harmonious” as “made up of sounds, colors, or other elements that “made up of sounds, colors, or other elements that combine agreeably ...” The key word here is combine agreeably ...” The key word here is “agreeably”. When matter and antimatter collide, “agreeably”. When matter and antimatter collide, they produce an explosion, which we hardly find they produce an explosion, which we hardly find agreeable if we do not plan it.agreeable if we do not plan it.Remember we are concerned with Set and the Remember we are concerned with Set and the creation of the Universe; the “creation” of matter creation of the Universe; the “creation” of matter [and antimatter], and - since we are matter [most of [and antimatter], and - since we are matter [most of us are anyway] - we are ergo concerned with us are anyway] - we are ergo concerned with ourselves.ourselves.Since Set has communicated with us [through Since Set has communicated with us [through the the Book of Coming Forth by NightBook of Coming Forth by Night], he is ], he is concerned with us. Therefore our opinions count, concerned with us. Therefore our opinions count, and if we consider something disagreeable, it and if we consider something disagreeable, it isis disagreeable. Set as an Intelligence is obviously able disagreeable. Set as an Intelligence is obviously able to think, in which case he must consider some to think, in which case he must consider some things disagreeable. Hence Set is “distinct from the things disagreeable. Hence Set is “distinct from the Order of the Cosmos” as man is distinct from the Order of the Cosmos” as man is distinct from the order of the cosmos [we do many things which are order of the cosmos [we do many things which are against logic and order].against logic and order].Scroll of SetScroll of Set - December 1975 - Page - December 1975 - Page 44"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Set is “ordered in and of himself” as man is Set is “ordered in and of himself” as man is ordered in and of himself.
