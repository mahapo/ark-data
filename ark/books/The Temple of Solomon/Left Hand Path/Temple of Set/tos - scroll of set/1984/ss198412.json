The Jews have built themselves a opposition. The Jews have built themselves a reasonably fancy nest with Hanukkah, which is reasonably fancy nest with Hanukkah, which is supposed to commemorate the Maccabees’ victory supposed to commemorate the Maccabees’ victory over Antiochus of Syria and the subsequent over Antiochus of Syria and the subsequent rededication of the Temple of Jerusalem umpty-ump rededication of the Temple of Jerusalem umpty-ump years ago. This is all well and good, but no one can years ago. This is all well and good, but no one can tell me that it isn’t just a handy excuse for partying tell me that it isn’t just a handy excuse for partying in December [’scuse me, in December [’scuse me, KislevKislev on the Jewish on the Jewish calendar].calendar].The neopagan subculture hasn’t quite gotten it The neopagan subculture hasn’t quite gotten it together yet. Every year both Black & White together yet. Every year both Black & White Witches talk themselves blue and purple about the Witches talk themselves blue and purple about the Winter Solstice, Candlemas, Yule, etc. and go Winter Solstice, Candlemas, Yule, etc. and go through all sorts of contortions to demonstrate to through all sorts of contortions to demonstrate to anyone who cares that, whatever kind of fun they’re anyone who cares that, whatever kind of fun they’re having, it definitely is not icky having, it definitely is not icky ChristianChristian fun and fun and furthermore is umpty-ump centuries older to boot.furthermore is umpty-ump centuries older to boot.The Church of Satan and Temple of Set have The Church of Satan and Temple of Set have engaged in something of the same contortions. engaged in something of the same contortions. December was Winter Solstice time in the C/S, even December was Winter Solstice time in the C/S, even if a grumpy Anton LaVey used to get dragged off to if a grumpy Anton LaVey used to get dragged off to Christmas dinner with his in-laws every year. If I Christmas dinner with his in-laws every year. If I put up a tree, I made sure it was properly Satanic via put up a tree, I made sure it was properly Satanic via red ornaments and a bat up top instead of the usual red ornaments and a bat up top instead of the usual angel. Later on, in the Æon of Set, we could [and angel. Later on, in the Æon of Set, we could [and did] frolic within the complexities of the ancient did] frolic within the complexities of the ancient Egyptian calendar and Khem’s rich astronomical Egyptian calendar and Khem’s rich astronomical and magical traditions concerning this time of year.and magical traditions concerning this time of year.But I must say, after watching this annual effort But I must say, after watching this annual effort for so many years, that I wonder if we aren’t beating for so many years, that I wonder if we aren’t beating a dead reindeer by mounting the barricades a dead reindeer by mounting the barricades whenever the radios switch over to Xmas muzak and whenever the radios switch over to Xmas muzak and the Salvation Army ding-dongs materialize on the the Salvation Army ding-dongs materialize on the street corners.street corners.The first question we should ask ourselves is The first question we should ask ourselves is how seriously the vast majority of Christians take how seriously the vast majority of Christians take Christmas. Now if you ask one if he/she respects Christmas. Now if you ask one if he/she respects the symbolism of the event, of course the answer the symbolism of the event, of course the answer will be yes. But once past the formal question, will be yes. But once past the formal question, doesn’t said Christian doesn’t said Christian reallyreally think in terms of think in terms of parties, trees, gifts, vacations, Santa Claus, and parties, trees, gifts, vacations, Santa Claus, and pigging-out? Couldn’t he/she care less about pigging-out? Couldn’t he/she care less about alleged incarnations of gods 2,000 years ago? Sure.alleged incarnations of gods 2,000 years ago? Sure.Similarly the majority of Christians could care Similarly the majority of Christians could care less about non-Christians’ and neo-pagans’ less about non-Christians’ and neo-pagans’ frenzied efforts to disassociate themselves from frenzied efforts to disassociate themselves from Christmas. “If they want to make a production Christmas. “If they want to make a production about about notnot enjoying themselves, that’s enjoying themselves, that’s theirtheir problem,” probably goes the opinion of the few problem,” probably goes the opinion of the few who even think about it.
