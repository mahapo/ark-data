Albert the existence of a fourth dimension. Albert Einstein’s famous theorem put an end to this Einstein’s famous theorem put an end to this speculation by proving that the fourth dimension is speculation by proving that the fourth dimension is synonymous with what we call time. This by no synonymous with what we call time. This by no means answers the many questions regarding the means answers the many questions regarding the true nature of time and how we are affected by it. To true nature of time and how we are affected by it. To this end there is much further speculation, and this end there is much further speculation, and perhaps someday man will answer this.perhaps someday man will answer this.This is not what my brief essay is concerned This is not what my brief essay is concerned with.

What we call the “now” moments to form motion. What we call the “now” is one of these cross-sections. This alone boggles is one of these cross-sections. This alone boggles the lower mind with its infinite definition, and seems the lower mind with its infinite definition, and seems to satisfy the curiosity of most contemplative to satisfy the curiosity of most contemplative individuals; but four dimensions are as an empty individuals; but four dimensions are as an empty stage.stage.At this point we must look philosophically At this point we must look philosophically toward that which fills the void. If the universe is toward that which fills the void. If the universe is examined from “beginning” to “end”, a clue may examined from “beginning” to “end”, a clue may be found. Ask yourself what defines the be found. Ask yourself what defines the arrangement of elements. What force places planets arrangement of elements. What force places planets and stars in space and time? When we examine this and stars in space and time? When we examine this randomness there appears some logic and yet some randomness there appears some logic and yet some “blind luck”. Looking to the extremes we see that “blind luck”. Looking to the extremes we see that logic is defeated, for what dictates the direction and logic is defeated, for what dictates the direction and patterning of matter when none initially exists? In patterning of matter when none initially exists? In mathematics the study of probability comes closest mathematics the study of probability comes closest to describing the laws of random events, yet along to describing the laws of random events, yet along with the most basic premise of this study comes the with the most basic premise of this study comes the admission that “God only knows” [or: “I don’t, admission that “God only knows” [or: “I don’t, and I can’t see how anyone could.”].and I can’t see how anyone could.”].What if all that could exist did? If all decisions What if all that could exist did? If all decisions were made in every possible way, and that which we were made in every possible way, and that which we ignorantly assert as factual were but one ignorantly assert as factual were but one combination, one universe in an infinite field of combination, one universe in an infinite field of universes?
