Since Heimans and Drury stressed that groups. Since Heimans and Drury stressed that their documentary was seeking the “cutting edge” their documentary was seeking the “cutting edge” of modern occultism - the “best and the brightest”, of modern occultism - the “best and the brightest”, as it were - I relented and came out from under my as it were - I relented and came out from under my rock.rock.Magistra Sinclair’s and my appearance in the Magistra Sinclair’s and my appearance in the film, however, is limited to an interview sequence.

It would not have been difficult to stage a ritual, as would not have been difficult to stage a ritual, as other groups and individuals in the documentary other groups and individuals in the documentary did. But such staging, no matter how well- did. But such staging, no matter how well- intentioned, inevitably strikes me as a profaning of intentioned, inevitably strikes me as a profaning of an action that should an action that should itselfitself be regarded as a sacred be regarded as a sacred experience.experience.While watching the film, it is easy to forget the While watching the film, it is easy to forget the camera-crew’s presence in the various episodes, but camera-crew’s presence in the various episodes, but - again as recounted in - again as recounted in ScrollScroll #X-6 - you certainly #X-6 - you certainly can’t ignore it during the filming proper. Every one can’t ignore it during the filming proper. Every one of the other groups portrayed in the film, seemingly of the other groups portrayed in the film, seemingly so absorbed in the authenticity of what they were so absorbed in the authenticity of what they were doing, must have been put through exhaustive doing, must have been put through exhaustive rehearsals, re-plays, and rearrangements for the rehearsals, re-plays, and rearrangements for the benefit of the camera’s eye. More than any direct benefit of the camera’s eye.

After viewing viewing The Occult ExperienceThe Occult Experience five times and five times and pondering it for a month or two, I think that it pondering it for a month or two, I think that it indeed makes virtually every individual and group indeed makes virtually every individual and group other than the Temple of Set appear adolescent and other than the Temple of Set appear adolescent and comic - with only three exceptions (Saunders, comic - with only three exceptions (Saunders, Norton, Giger).Norton, Giger).I don’t say this to gloat, since we are not in I don’t say this to gloat, since we are not in competition for the kinds of people who join such competition for the kinds of people who join such groups.

Berkeley argued that our senses from the senses. Berkeley argued that our senses are the sole source of our knowledge of the outside are the sole source of our knowledge of the outside world, and that those senses are easily confused or world, and that those senses are easily confused or misled. Thus he held that there can be no contrast misled. Thus he held that there can be no contrast between “subjective” sensations and “objective” between “subjective” sensations and “objective” properties of matter. It follows that, if objects of the properties of matter. It follows that, if objects of the senses are subjective, we can have no knowledge of senses are subjective, we can have no knowledge of anything beyond ourselves.
