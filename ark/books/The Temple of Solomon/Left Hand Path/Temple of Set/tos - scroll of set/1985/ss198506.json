In my experience This is simply not the case. In my experience glamor and physical appearance are very much a glamor and physical appearance are very much a part of the higher self and the Black Arts.

Not so. When of such “superficial” things. Not so. When working with the Black Arts, we first create and working with the Black Arts, we first create and surround ourselves with a magical universe, both surround ourselves with a magical universe, both internal and external.

In some cases, if the intrusion is strong enough, it may some cases, if the intrusion is strong enough, it may negate the working entirely.negate the working entirely.An example of this may be seen in the movie An example of this may be seen in the movie Somewhere in TimeSomewhere in Time, a story about a young man , a story about a young man who travels back in time to find the woman he had who travels back in time to find the woman he had loved in the distant past. He was able to accomplish loved in the distant past.
