So when my landlord discovers that the “nice young man downstairs” discovers that the “nice young man downstairs” has a chamber of horrors in his storage room, I need has a chamber of horrors in his storage room, I need to resort to LBM; and to resort to LBM I need a to resort to LBM; and to resort to LBM I need a good grasp of the semantics of the situation.good grasp of the semantics of the situation.Here’s the problem as I see it:Here’s the problem as I see it:As humans it is our supernature to have As humans it is our supernature to have meaningful experiences and express them with meaningful experiences and express them with complexes of symbols. The experience of meaning complexes of symbols. The experience of meaning by way of symbols can touch a whole range of by way of symbols can touch a whole range of feelings within us, and thereby enrich our lives. It feelings within us, and thereby enrich our lives. It also requires some effort, and doesn’t always make also requires some effort, and doesn’t always make us happy. When an individual human opts not to us happy. When an individual human opts not to consider meaning, and instead goes straight from consider meaning, and instead goes straight from symbol to emotion, he begins dying inside. His symbol to emotion, he begins dying inside. His ability to critically reason decomposes to the point ability to critically reason decomposes to the point that even the meaning of his emotions is reduced to that even the meaning of his emotions is reduced to the binary categories of positive and negative, the binary categories of positive and negative, “good” and “bad”. Thus “democracy”, “good” and “bad”. Thus “democracy”, “American flag”, “freedom”, and “God” are “American flag”, “freedom”, and “God” are “good” (positive stimulus); and “communism”, “good” (positive stimulus); and “communism”, “Noriega”, and “Satan” are “bad” (negative “Noriega”, and “Satan” are “bad” (negative stimulus).stimulus).It is by this means that a culture dies. Men go to It is by this means that a culture dies. Men go to war and are willing to risk their lives for “flag”, war and are willing to risk their lives for “flag”, “freedom”, and “God”. They are equally willing “freedom”, and “God”. They are equally willing to kill the “communists” and the “Satanists” to kill the “communists” and the “Satanists” without ever being able to tell you what all those without ever being able to tell you what all those words meant. Theirs is a war of “good” and words meant. Theirs is a war of “good” and “bad”.“bad”.The problem comes when two entirely different The problem comes when two entirely different cultures (us and them) share the same symbols. To cultures (us and them) share the same symbols. To many it does not matter that we claim a different many it does not matter that we claim a different meaning, because meaning was never the issue. The meaning, because meaning was never the issue. The issue, for those who would move against us, is that issue, for those who would move against us, is that we represent negative stimulus & fear; and that is we represent negative stimulus & fear; and that is “bad”.“bad”.The status of the word “Satan” in the global The status of the word “Satan” in the global village is an interesting one at present. The binary village is an interesting one at present. The binary theme of duality continues to thrive in Judaism, theme of duality continues to thrive in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Additionally this world-view Christianity, and Islam. Additionally this world-view has dominated many persons who consider has dominated many persons who consider themselves atheists or agnostics. It is still themselves atheists or agnostics. It is still fashionable among large populations of humans to fashionable among large populations of humans to deny responsibility for their psyches, and store the deny responsibility for their psyches, and store the “goods” and “bads” of their conscious in an “goods” and “bads” of their conscious in an unconscious containing two diametrically-opposed unconscious containing two diametrically-opposed entities. This is the preferred method, because it entities. This is the preferred method, because it allows them to conserve brainpower otherwise used allows them to conserve brainpower otherwise used toward finding meaning in a complex universe, and toward finding meaning in a complex universe, and to divert their energies toward other useful tasks to divert their energies toward other useful tasks such as excretion and procreation.such as excretion and procreation.So what to do?
