Undeniably Huysmans took Satanism blunder. Undeniably Huysmans took Satanism quite seriously, but his attitude towards it was rather quite seriously, but his attitude towards it was rather ambivalent. On one hand, despite his atheism at the ambivalent. On one hand, despite his atheism at the time he wrote time he wrote La-BasLa-Bas, he considered Satanism as , he considered Satanism as pure evil possessing the soul and making mischief pure evil possessing the soul and making mischief in the world, an idea also expressed by Catholicism. in the world, an idea also expressed by Catholicism.

These scenes are taken from an insane asylum. These scenes are completely different from Black Mass descriptions completely different from Black Mass descriptions by other authors.by other authors.22 Probably the author adapted his Probably the author adapted his version to his personal insights about Satanism, so version to his personal insights about Satanism, so only the blasphemous and ritual aspects reveal the only the blasphemous and ritual aspects reveal the true character of the Black Mass as celebrated in true character of the Black Mass as celebrated in Paris, Lyon, etc.Paris, Lyon, etc.In this context it was the French occultist In this context it was the French occultist Joanny Bricaud who pointed out that Huysmans’ Joanny Bricaud who pointed out that Huysmans’ Mass was derived from three sources: documents Mass was derived from three sources: documents from the archives of Vintras procured by Boullan, from the archives of Vintras procured by Boullan, documents bearing on the case of Cantianille [as we documents bearing on the case of Cantianille [as we are informed within the novel itself], and the are informed within the novel itself], and the attending of a real Black Mass by Huysmans at the attending of a real Black Mass by Huysmans at the Rue de Sevres.Rue de Sevres.33Before addressing the question of the real Before addressing the question of the real identity of the Canon Docre, it is necessary to identity of the Canon Docre, it is necessary to explore the background of the mistress of Durtal, explore the background of the mistress of Durtal, Hyacinthe Chantelouve, which is as important in Hyacinthe Chantelouve, which is as important in reality as it is in the novel.

Further research reveals that a second Courriere. Further research reveals that a second model was involved. In the first place Berthe model was involved.
