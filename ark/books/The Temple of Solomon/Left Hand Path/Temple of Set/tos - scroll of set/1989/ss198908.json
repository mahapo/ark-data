Each inherit a collective memory of their kind. Each system is shaped by “morphic fields” system is shaped by “morphic fields” containing a collective or pooled memory. Thus containing a collective or pooled memory. Thus rabbits are rabbit-shaped not only because rabbits are rabbit-shaped not only because DNA encodes their proteins, but also because DNA encodes their proteins, but also because nature has a “rabbit habit”, a rabbit-”field” that nature has a “rabbit habit”, a rabbit-”field” that informs their growth and instinctive behavior. informs their growth and instinctive behavior. According to the hypothesis of formative According to the hypothesis of formative causation, this inherent memory depends on causation, this inherent memory depends on morphic resonance, a process that involves morphic resonance, a process that involves action at a distance in both space and time.action at a distance in both space and time.The theory of morphic fields, or “morphic The theory of morphic fields, or “morphic resonance”, thus regards the evolution of organic resonance”, thus regards the evolution of organic forms and psychic form as broadly reciprocal or forms and psychic form as broadly reciprocal or synchronicitous events. The connection with Plato’s synchronicitous events. The connection with Plato’s theory of the Forms and with Jung’s archetypes is theory of the Forms and with Jung’s archetypes is quite plain, and is discussed by Sheldrake in a quite plain, and is discussed by Sheldrake in a concise and lucid fashion. Whether or not the concise and lucid fashion. Whether or not the essential Forms are eternal, as in Plato’s scheme, or essential Forms are eternal, as in Plato’s scheme, or are themselves part of the changing pattern of are themselves part of the changing pattern of evolution, is not of great importance. Either way the evolution, is not of great importance. Either way the expanses of time involved are so enormous as to expanses of time involved are so enormous as to render such speculation entirely academic. Besides, render such speculation entirely academic.

The crucial idea is “chicken and egg” quandary. The crucial idea is that of essential Form, which exists acausally and, that of essential Form, which exists acausally and, we may say, magically - beyond the world of we may say, magically - beyond the world of manifestation.manifestation.The notion of morphic fields or essential Forms The notion of morphic fields or essential Forms is closely related to the ancient, esoteric concept of is closely related to the ancient, esoteric concept of the “group astral”, which in the case of all the “group astral”, which in the case of all recognizable animals save humanity represents a recognizable animals save humanity represents a collective pool or “headquarters” of the appropriate collective pool or “headquarters” of the appropriate formative energy.formative energy.The rabbit-field of the example quoted above The rabbit-field of the example quoted above would thus be conceived of as the “Great Rabbit”, would thus be conceived of as the “Great Rabbit”, which entity could be contacted and directed by which entity could be contacted and directed by magical methods which have been know to shamans magical methods which have been know to shamans from time immemorial.
