Generally teachings are monitored quite closely. Generally teachings are handed down from a guru to a disciple, pretty much handed down from a guru to a disciple, pretty much in a one-to-one relationship. Now this is a in a one-to-one relationship. Now this is a fundamental form in which the tradition is handed fundamental form in which the tradition is handed down. This does not indicate whether it is L or down.

It is here that the East and West Valley in India. It is here that the East and West meet. The Silk Road from China comes to this meet. The Silk Road from China comes to this Arabic empire. Another reason for using the Arabic Arabic empire. Another reason for using the Arabic is that Islam generally did not turn against its is that Islam generally did not turn against its mystical traditions as Christianity did.
