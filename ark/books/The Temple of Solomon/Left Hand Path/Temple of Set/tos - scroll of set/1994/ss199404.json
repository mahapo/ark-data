The camp had cast the words, “Arbeit Macht Frei”. The camp had become a museum, and, like several of its Eastern become a museum, and, like several of its Eastern European counterparts, it was a monument to the European counterparts, it was a monument to the lessons of history which were “never to be lessons of history which were “never to be forgotten lest they be repeated”.forgotten lest they be repeated”.The soldier looked around him and thought The soldier looked around him and thought hard.

He had spent a week with her family in a small, southern town near the with her family in a small, southern town near the Swiss border where they had a wonderful time Swiss border where they had a wonderful time together - for the most part. The soldier remembered together - for the most part. The soldier remembered taking Sara, the family dog, out for long walks in the taking Sara, the family dog, out for long walks in the park, and thinking about what it was like to live in park, and thinking about what it was like to live in that pretty little town during the Second World War.that pretty little town during the Second World War.He was taken with the little town, with his hosts, He was taken with the little town, with his hosts, and with all the other families in the park who and with all the other families in the park who greeted him and who obviously shared his feelings greeted him and who obviously shared his feelings about the importance of going out on walks.

But what did these older folks do during American. But what did these older folks do during the war? Were any of them Nazis themselves? Did the war? Were any of them Nazis themselves?

The old guy seemed happy to meet an American, The old guy seemed happy to meet an American, and stated with pride that he had been to Arizona - and stated with pride that he had been to Arizona - in 1945. The soldier remembered one of the girl’s in 1945. The soldier remembered one of the girl’s friends bitterly telling him that “we (Germans) are friends bitterly telling him that “we (Germans) are not allowed to be proud of our country.”not allowed to be proud of our country.”These words echoed in his thoughts as he sat in These words echoed in his thoughts as he sat in the family room of his hosts. There the mother the family room of his hosts. There the mother brought out a book of art that had been kept in a brought out a book of art that had been kept in a special place. She had placed the book in the special place. She had placed the book in the soldier’s hands, stating with great animation that the soldier’s hands, stating with great animation that the art was Jewish, and “wasn’t it beeaauutiful?!” The art was Jewish, and “wasn’t it beeaauutiful?!” The soldier looked up from the book to see the soldier looked up from the book to see the exaggerated smiles of parents who might well have exaggerated smiles of parents who might well have been in the Hitler Youth - big, wide smiles of a been in the Hitler Youth - big, wide smiles of a people whose country had then become divided in people whose country had then become divided in two, and whose government had now subsidized the two, and whose government had now subsidized the building of synagogues left empty by a population building of synagogues left empty by a population of worshippers that had long since died or moved of worshippers that had long since died or moved away - smiles that could barely conceal the look of away - smiles that could barely conceal the look of desperation in the eyes which stood fixed and alert desperation in the eyes which stood fixed and alert upon their American visitor, waiting for signs of his upon their American visitor, waiting for signs of his approval - and forgiveness for the sins of their approval - and forgiveness for the sins of their ancestors. It was no wonder that the young woman, ancestors. It was no wonder that the young woman, whom he had dragged to Dachau, had become so whom he had dragged to Dachau, had become so depressed in the last days of their travels together.depressed in the last days of their travels together.Soon thereafter the soldier struck out for Berlin Soon thereafter the soldier struck out for Berlin on his own. There he obtained a day visa to visit the on his own. There he obtained a day visa to visit the other side of yet another human barrier. This time other side of yet another human barrier. This time the barbed wire contained not a museum, but a city - the barbed wire contained not a museum, but a city - West Berlin. The soldier had begun his journey West Berlin. The soldier had begun his journey from the “inside” of a wall that was surrounded by from the “inside” of a wall that was surrounded by a country kept prisoner by its own government.

The soldier found themselves at an abrupt dead end. The soldier could see the guard towers, and from a raised could see the guard towers, and from a raised platform the guards and dogs as well. But from the platform the guards and dogs as well. But from the east he could not even see the wall, its adjacent east he could not even see the wall, its adjacent neighborhoods having been closed down and made neighborhoods having been closed down and made “verboten” to visitors.“verboten” to visitors.The German Democratic Republic (DDR) had The German Democratic Republic (DDR) had described the wall as the “anti-fascist protection described the wall as the “anti-fascist protection barrier”. They too felt that the lessons of history barrier”. They too felt that the lessons of history should not be forgotten. With even greater fervor should not be forgotten. With even greater fervor they repeated the chants of their Soviet liberators as they repeated the chants of their Soviet liberators as a continuous reminder of the sins that its citizens a continuous reminder of the sins that its citizens had inherited. No, these people need not think about had inherited. No, these people need not think about the evil that lies beyond the wall. The government the evil that lies beyond the wall. The government will protect them, and save them from their sins. The will protect them, and save them from their sins.

Together they refer to a meaning “to burn”. Together they refer to a sacrifice that is wholly consumed by fire - in short a sacrifice that is wholly consumed by fire - in short a burnt offering.

However, quoting again as a process is eternal. However, quoting again from Magister Menschel’s letter:from Magister Menschel’s letter:Throughout the history of Throughout the history of XemXem’s ’s discussion within the Temple of Set, we’ve had discussion within the Temple of Set, we’ve had an almost neurotic need to state, confirm, and an almost neurotic need to state, confirm, and repeat that repeat that XemXem is is notnot the end of more change the end of more change ......This repeated protestation has to some This repeated protestation has to some extent lessened the importance of extent lessened the importance of XemXem as a as a goal in many eyes ...
