Barrett III°- by Ronald L. Barrett III°On the weekend of March 5-6, XXIX, Priestess On the weekend of March 5-6, XXIX, Priestess Lance and the R’lyeh Lodge held a two-day Lance and the R’lyeh Lodge held a two-day symposium on symposium on RunaRuna in San Francisco. During the in San Francisco. During the first day of presentations, I included within my own first day of presentations, I included within my own an invitation for the attending Initiates to view a an invitation for the attending Initiates to view a crime scene in the back room.

But it was bound to happen sooner or later. Nietzsche’s was bound to happen sooner or later. Nietzsche’s Zarathustra once gave the same pronunciation to a Zarathustra once gave the same pronunciation to a wholly different kingdom of animal. It was a false wholly different kingdom of animal. It was a false myth of dubious origin that had been obsolete for myth of dubious origin that had been obsolete for some time, if not all time. This myth, however, was some time, if not all time. This myth, however, was none of these things. In fact, just prior to its demise, none of these things. In fact, just prior to its demise, there had been a recent resurgence of there had been a recent resurgence of XemXem in the in the Temple. I myself heard a great deal about Temple.

Why did I “Xill” ritual? Why did I “Xill” XemXem??Well, I must confess that it was all in jest Well, I must confess that it was all in jest [except the killing part].

To me it always was a very over the years. To me it always was a very simple, clear, and brilliant concept: the creation of an simple, clear, and brilliant concept: the creation of an artificial “focus” for artificial “focus” for XeperXeper by each individual, by each individual, much after the fashion of Nietzsche’s “horizon-much after the fashion of Nietzsche’s “horizon-building”, in order to give personal building”, in order to give personal XeperXeper some some cohesion, some direction.cohesion, some direction.Consider Consider XeperXeper as a sort of light-bulb, with the as a sort of light-bulb, with the individual as the bulb and individual as the bulb and XeperXeper as the emitted light. as the emitted light. The individual is thus “expanding/evolving = The individual is thus “expanding/evolving = Becoming” in a total sense - well-rounded, one Becoming” in a total sense - well-rounded, one might say! Its drawback is that it is non-focused, might say! Its drawback is that it is non-focused, that it is diffuse. It is accordingly difficult for the that it is diffuse. It is accordingly difficult for the individual to comprehend the development of his individual to comprehend the development of his state of being, because too much is happening too state of being, because too much is happening too subtly. The result can be bewilderment, frustration: subtly. The result can be bewilderment, frustration: the feeling that something wonderful is going on the feeling that something wonderful is going on with oneself but not being able to encapsulate or with oneself but not being able to encapsulate or define the entire experience. define the entire experience. XeperXeper is thus “plagued is thus “plagued by the vague”!by the vague”!XemXem as originally Uttered by Magus Ronald K. as originally Uttered by Magus Ronald K. Barrett acted as a kind of lens to focus Barrett acted as a kind of lens to focus XeperXeper: to : to take the “radiant light” and turn it into “cohesive take the “radiant light” and turn it into “cohesive light”, like a laser, directed towards a personal goal light”, like a laser, directed towards a personal goal which the Setian constructed “at his personal which the Setian constructed “at his personal horizon”. As horizon”. As XeperXeper is constantly expanding, so the is constantly expanding, so the Setian’s “personal horizon” constantly recedes; Setian’s “personal horizon” constantly recedes; hence hence XemXem must constantly be “re-targeted”. must constantly be “re-targeted”.As there is a problem with As there is a problem with XeperXeper in being in being difficult for the individual to apprehend in himself, difficult for the individual to apprehend in himself, so there is also a problem with so there is also a problem with XemXem. It is that the . It is that the moment one creates a horizon which is necessarily moment one creates a horizon which is necessarily limited in its “breadth”, if not in its “distance from limited in its “breadth”, if not in its “distance from the observer”, one sees only a part of the whole. As the observer”, one sees only a part of the whole. As one fashions the laser-beam of one fashions the laser-beam of XemXem to approach that to approach that horizon, one utilizes only a part of one’s entire horizon, one utilizes only a part of one’s entire XeperXeper accordingly. accordingly.Consider this analogy: With Consider this analogy: With XeperXeper one is one is standing out under the night sky, seeing an ocean of standing out under the night sky, seeing an ocean of stars. With stars. With XemXem one looks through a telescope. one looks through a telescope. What one sees through the telescope is clearer, What one sees through the telescope is clearer, sharper, bigger; and the mind can make more sense sharper, bigger; and the mind can make more sense of it. Over a period of time an astronomer can look of it. Over a period of time an astronomer can look at lots of individual stars, galaxies, etc. through his at lots of individual stars, galaxies, etc. through his telescope, all of which is a scientific experience. But telescope, all of which is a scientific experience.

I would go so far as to say that this also affected I would go so far as to say that this also affected RKB himself, and that his holding of the High RKB himself, and that his holding of the High Priesthood made it a little too tempting to just Priesthood made it a little too tempting to just “order people to align themselves to his “order people to align themselves to his XemXem”.

But after a few years I think he got a impressively. But after a few years I think he got a bit tired of it particularly with some Setians who bit tired of it particularly with some Setians who seemed to want him to “go over it just one more seemed to want him to “go over it just one more time” and finally yielded to the temptation to use time” and finally yielded to the temptation to use Scroll of SetScroll of Set - June 1994 - Page - June 1994 - Page 2020"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"his Temple office to say, “Just his Temple office to say, “Just dodo it and shut up or it and shut up or get out!”get out!”Some did it and shut up; others got out with the Some did it and shut up; others got out with the result that the Temple was down to about 30 result that the Temple was down to about 30 members by the time of the Set-IV Conclave crisis. members by the time of the Set-IV Conclave crisis.
