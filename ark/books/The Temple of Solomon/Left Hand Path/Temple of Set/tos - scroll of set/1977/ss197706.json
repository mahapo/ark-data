Aquino V°- by Michael A. Aquino V°High Priest of SetHigh Priest of SetAs you can see from the Executive Director’s As you can see from the Executive Director’s report, we have devoted much of our second year of report, we have devoted much of our second year of operation to refining the systems created in the first operation to refining the systems created in the first year, as well as to introducing some new ones for year, as well as to introducing some new ones for testing. We have experienced some complete testing. We have experienced some complete successes and some failures - all of which adds up successes and some failures - all of which adds up to a year well-spent. [I mistrust “failure-free” to a year well-spent. [I mistrust “failure-free” situations; it is an unmistakable sign that little or no situations; it is an unmistakable sign that little or no experimentation is tolerated, or that unfavorable experimentation is tolerated, or that unfavorable results of experiments are being swept under the results of experiments are being swept under the rug. A crucial part of the “atmosphere” of the rug. A crucial part of the “atmosphere” of the Temple of Set must be the freedom to err without Temple of Set must be the freedom to err without fear of lingering ostracism after corrective measures fear of lingering ostracism after corrective measures have been applied.]have been applied.]I think it is about time to explain the “model” I think it is about time to explain the “model” of the Temple of Set to you in detail - the conceptual of the Temple of Set to you in detail - the conceptual vision of this institution that I have in mind when I vision of this institution that I have in mind when I make decisions concerning its development. Once make decisions concerning its development. Once you understand what it is that we are heading you understand what it is that we are heading towards, the intermediate steps - and the growing towards, the intermediate steps - and the growing pains - will seem somewhat less mysterious.pains - will seem somewhat less mysterious.Let me begin by answering a question which Let me begin by answering a question which arises quite frequently in discussions with new arises quite frequently in discussions with new Setians and non-members alike: Just how - if at all - Setians and non-members alike: Just how - if at all - does the Temple really differ from other occult, does the Temple really differ from other occult, magical, or religious groups? Isn’t it just “the same magical, or religious groups? Isn’t it just “the same old story” with slightly different mythological old story” with slightly different mythological trappings and a higher degree of organizational trappings and a higher degree of organizational efficiency?efficiency?There are three very important parts to the There are three very important parts to the answer. The first part is that, before developing its answer. The first part is that, before developing its philosophy, the Temple has attained a perspective on philosophy, the Temple has attained a perspective on human history [both philosophical and practical] human history [both philosophical and practical] that is, in the strictest possible sense, all-inclusive that is, in the strictest possible sense, all-inclusive and detached. We have made a careful study of and detached. We have made a careful study of human ideas and behavior for the express purpose human ideas and behavior for the express purpose of avoiding repetition of patterns, on the principle of avoiding repetition of patterns, on the principle that those who do not understand and appreciate that those who do not understand and appreciate history are condemned to relive it.history are condemned to relive it.The detachment involved in this perspective is The detachment involved in this perspective is equally important. Objectivity in any analysis equally important. Objectivity in any analysis requires a complete lack of bias on the part of the requires a complete lack of bias on the part of the analyst. [This is why computers are invaluable as analyst. [This is why computers are invaluable as analytical tools ... to the extent that they do not have analytical tools ... to the extent that they do not have human bias programmed into them!]human bias programmed into them!]The Setian mind differs from the human mind The Setian mind differs from the human mind precisely in its ability to detach itself from the vast precisely in its ability to detach itself from the vast panorama of the “natural” course of events and to panorama of the “natural” course of events and to assess that panorama from an independent vantage-assess that panorama from an independent vantage-point. The crystal-clear “vision” that results - and point. The crystal-clear “vision” that results - and the subsequent operations of the Setian mind upon the subsequent operations of the Setian mind upon that panorama to influence it - are the essence of that panorama to influence it - are the essence of what the natural, human mind can only understand what the natural, human mind can only understand as “magic” - because the principles involved are as “magic” - because the principles involved are completely beyond the reach of its vision. This completely beyond the reach of its vision. This principle of complete historical scope and detached principle of complete historical scope and detached perspective is found in no other institution on this perspective is found in no other institution on this planet. It is entirely unique to the Temple of Set.planet. It is entirely unique to the Temple of Set.The second part of the answer is that the Temple The second part of the answer is that the Temple is gradually being configured to operate in an is gradually being configured to operate in an environment that is distinct from that of material, environment that is distinct from that of material, natural events and non-comprehensible to those natural events and non-comprehensible to those whose value systems are limited to the natural whose value systems are limited to the natural universe. This means that the behavior of the universe. This means that the behavior of the Temple will ultimately not be influenced or Temple will ultimately not be influenced or controlled by outside events, but will be based upon controlled by outside events, but will be based upon a matrix of principles and priorities determined by a matrix of principles and priorities determined by the Temple itself.the Temple itself.Technically this also means that the Temple will Technically this also means that the Temple will never pose a deliberate threat to human political or never pose a deliberate threat to human political or social developments, because it will not be an social developments, because it will not be an interested party to them. It will merely take them interested party to them. It will merely take them into objective account when evaluating the material into objective account when evaluating the material environment in which it must exist. In “escaping” environment in which it must exist. In “escaping” from the natural course of human events, the Temple from the natural course of human events, the Temple must never make the mistake of ignoring it. In fact must never make the mistake of ignoring it. In fact we must understand and appreciate it far more we must understand and appreciate it far more thoroughly than the humans who exist completely thoroughly than the humans who exist completely within its confines if we are to neutralize its - and within its confines if we are to neutralize its - and their - influence upon us.their - influence upon us.As in the relationship between Hari Seldon’s As in the relationship between Hari Seldon’s Foundation and the Empire, human society cannot Foundation and the Empire, human society cannot claim that the Temple of Set poses a deliberate threat claim that the Temple of Set poses a deliberate threat to it. But human nature is such that it fears anything to it. But human nature is such that it fears anything outside of its comprehension and will actively outside of its comprehension and will actively attempt to destroy it rather than to tolerate it. We attempt to destroy it rather than to tolerate it. We would be quite foolish if we did not appreciate this would be quite foolish if we did not appreciate this fact; on the other hand we must not allow that fact; on the other hand we must not allow that appreciation to give way to paranoia.appreciation to give way to paranoia.The Temple must control events in such a way The Temple must control events in such a way so that it is never perceived or isolated as a target. so that it is never perceived or isolated as a target. This is a task which has many ramifications. The This is a task which has many ramifications. The first and simplest one is that the Temple must not first and simplest one is that the Temple must not distort its true admissions process - one of distort its true admissions process - one of recognitionrecognition rather than of attempted conversion or rather than of attempted conversion or indoctrination. If we seek numerical growth as a indoctrination. If we seek numerical growth as a measure of “success”, we will completely violate measure of “success”, we will completely violate the principle of the Elect Setian mind as the only the principle of the Elect Setian mind as the only criterion for membership.criterion for membership.Another aspect of distorted admissions is that Another aspect of distorted admissions is that humans who are exposed to the internal workings of humans who are exposed to the internal workings of the Temple will necessarily perceive them in a the Temple will necessarily perceive them in a different way than we do - at best as nonsensical different way than we do - at best as nonsensical and at worst as a threat. When such humans are and at worst as a threat. When such humans are eventually processed out of the Temple, they will be eventually processed out of the Temple, they will be"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"suspicious and fearful of it.

But forecasting is a long way from Temple. But forecasting is a long way from established fact, and is by no means a justification established fact, and is by no means a justification for over-reaction on our part. It is a research tool, for over-reaction on our part. It is a research tool, not a crystal ball. [I don’t mind saying that the not a crystal ball.

Using the efforts of its Initiates are directed. Using the analogy of analogy of MetropolisMetropolis, it is not a machine feeding , it is not a machine feeding upon the energy of its tenders.

The vast Let us examine this point carefully. The vast number of factors and the great personal expertise number of factors and the great personal expertise which a magician must bring to bear upon a given which a magician must bring to bear upon a given problem make the probability of error and/or problem make the probability of error and/or inaccuracy very high. Accordingly a lone inaccuracy very high.
