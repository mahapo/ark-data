The discovery use of the pentagram’s configuration. The discovery of the Divine Proportion by Max Raphael in of the Divine Proportion by Max Raphael in prehistoric cave paintings, published in his book prehistoric cave paintings, published in his book Prehistoric Cave PaintingsPrehistoric Cave Paintings, places the Divine , places the Divine Proportion with the first known attempts by man to Proportion with the first known attempts by man to develop an art of figurative and symbolic develop an art of figurative and symbolic representation.representation.Of all the properties which researchers have Of all the properties which researchers have extracted from analysis of the Great Pyramid at extracted from analysis of the Great Pyramid at Giza, perhaps one most significant is its cross-Giza, perhaps one most significant is its cross-section, a triangle which, if its base be assumed section, a triangle which, if its base be assumed equal to one, the hypotenuse is equal to equal to one, the hypotenuse is equal to φφ, and the , and the adjacent side, or apothem, is the square root of adjacent side, or apothem, is the square root of φφ..Peter Tompkins, in his Peter Tompkins, in his Secrets of the Great Secrets of the Great PyramidPyramid, speculates that since the squaring of the , speculates that since the squaring of the circle is practically resolvable as a function of the circle is practically resolvable as a function of the number number φφ, the Pyramid was designed as a tool with , the Pyramid was designed as a tool with which the squaring of the circle as well as the which the squaring of the circle as well as the cubing of the sphere was possible. Using the (√cubing of the sphere was possible. Using the (√φφ) - ) - φφ - 1 triangle, the ancient Egyptians could construct - 1 triangle, the ancient Egyptians could construct maps using a Mercator projection from a spherical maps using a Mercator projection from a spherical quadrant of 90° latitude onto a flat surface of equal quadrant of 90° latitude onto a flat surface of equal area. Thus the Divine Proportion provides the key to area. Thus the Divine Proportion provides the key to the resolution between curved surface and flat the resolution between curved surface and flat surface as one of its many unique mathematical surface as one of its many unique mathematical properties.properties.Schwaller de Lubicz has analyzed the triangular Schwaller de Lubicz has analyzed the triangular loincloth worn by pharaohs on dozens of stone loincloth worn by pharaohs on dozens of stone relief representations. He invariably found two relief representations.

Similarly Max Raphael hypothesizes Proportion. Similarly Max Raphael hypothesizes that the Golden Section - using the 19th century that the Golden Section - using the 19th century name for the Divine Proportion - was the key to name for the Divine Proportion - was the key to form-making of the most profound sort.form-making of the most profound sort.The Golden Section is the synthesis of The Golden Section is the synthesis of space and motion (time).
