I destruction ritual on Tuesday (the day of Mars)? I think there’s a lot to be said for “magical hours”.think there’s a lot to be said for “magical hours”.There are actually two methods of calculating There are actually two methods of calculating “the day and hour of the Sun”. Both will give you “the day and hour of the Sun”. Both will give you the same result: the Sun crosses the meridian each the same result: the Sun crosses the meridian each day at noon, local standard time, and passes through day at noon, local standard time, and passes through the nadir at midnight, local standard time. Midnight the nadir at midnight, local standard time. Midnight Saturday/Sunday would therefore be the nadir of the Saturday/Sunday would therefore be the nadir of the Sun on the day of the Sun, and this is the reason for Sun on the day of the Sun, and this is the reason for working Black Magic at this “witching hour”.working Black Magic at this “witching hour”.There are several books in print which give There are several books in print which give directions for the use of the day and hour of the directions for the use of the day and hour of the various visible planets. But there is a catch to them! various visible planets. But there is a catch to them! The “magical hour” is seldom sixty minutes long, The “magical hour” is seldom sixty minutes long, because the period from sunset to sunrise is divided because the period from sunset to sunrise is divided into twelve equal parts. A “magical hour” would be into twelve equal parts. A “magical hour” would be sixty minutes long only when sunset took place at sixty minutes long only when sunset took place at 6:00 p.m. and sunrise at 6:00 a.m. Because this 6:00 p.m. and sunrise at 6:00 a.m. Because this rarely happens, even on the equinoxes, the “hours” rarely happens, even on the equinoxes, the “hours” of the day or night will invariably be longer or of the day or night will invariably be longer or shorter than sixty minutes.shorter than sixty minutes.The duration of “magical hours” is relatively The duration of “magical hours” is relatively easy to determine. Most daily newspapers and tide easy to determine. Most daily newspapers and tide tables give the time of sunrise and sunset. If, on a tables give the time of sunrise and sunset. If, on a given day, sunset is at 4:50 PM, local standard time, given day, sunset is at 4:50 PM, local standard time, and sunrise the following morning is at 7:14 AM, and sunrise the following morning is at 7:14 AM, the problem would be worked as follows:the problem would be worked as follows:Sunset: 16h50mSunset: 16h50mSunrise: 07h14mSunrise: 07h14mInterval: 876 minutesInterval: 876 minutesDivide by 12: 73 minutes in each “magical Divide by 12: 73 minutes in each “magical hour” of the nighthour” of the nightFirst hour begins: 16h50m “clock time”First hour begins: 16h50m “clock time”Second hour begins: 16h50m + 73m = Second hour begins: 16h50m + 73m = 18h03m “clock time”18h03m “clock time”Third hour begins: 16h50m + (2 x 73m = 146m) Third hour begins: 16h50m + (2 x 73m = 146m) = 19h16m “clock time”= 19h16m “clock time”This calculation would be necessary if you This calculation would be necessary if you wanted to perform a working of the Sun on a day wanted to perform a working of the Sun on a day other than Sunday. There are several books which other than Sunday. There are several books which mention the medieval system of “hours”, and I mention the medieval system of “hours”, and I urge you to consult one if you use this method.urge you to consult one if you use this method.The second method of determining timing of The second method of determining timing of ritual magic, and the one I prefer, is a bit more ritual magic, and the one I prefer, is a bit more complicated. It involves determining the time of complicated. It involves determining the time of meridian crossing of, say, the Moon on Monday [or meridian crossing of, say, the Moon on Monday [or Mars on Tuesday, Jupiter on Wednesday, etc.]. Mars on Tuesday, Jupiter on Wednesday, etc.]. Because absolute accuracy isn’t necessary, an Because absolute accuracy isn’t necessary, an astrological ephemeris will suffice, although the astrological ephemeris will suffice, although the American Ephemeris and Nautical AlmanacAmerican Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac is far is far more complete and accurate. You will also need more complete and accurate. You will also need either a pocket calculator capable of logarithmic either a pocket calculator capable of logarithmic functions or a logarithm table.functions or a logarithm table.The first part of the problem is to determine the The first part of the problem is to determine the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for your local noon, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for your local noon, standard time. (Pacific Standard Time = 04h00m standard time. (Pacific Standard Time = 04h00m GMT). To be truly accurate, it would be necessary GMT). To be truly accurate, it would be necessary to determine “true local time”, which can be learned to determine “true local time”, which can be learned from a book on calculating horoscope charts, but from a book on calculating horoscope charts, but this degree of accuracy isn’t necessary. The total this degree of accuracy isn’t necessary. The total time of a magical working would ordinarily time of a magical working would ordinarily encompass any error in your calculations which encompass any error in your calculations which derive from the difference between “true local derive from the difference between “true local time” and “standard time” on ^your clock.time” and “standard time” on ^your clock.Next determine the interval between your GMT Next determine the interval between your GMT (04h00m) and noon, GMT. (For Pacific Standard (04h00m) and noon, GMT. (For Pacific Standard Time, this is 08h00m.) Determine from the Time, this is 08h00m.) Determine from the logarithm table the log for this difference (08h00m logarithm table the log for this difference (08h00m = 0.4771).= 0.4771).The following table shows each step in the third The following table shows each step in the third part of the calculation:part of the calculation:SunSunMoonMoonComing noon positionComing noon positionfrom ephemerisfrom ephemeris10°36’ Cancer 10°36’ Cancer 06°10’ Aries06°10’ AriesPrevious noon positionPrevious noon positionfrom ephemerisfrom ephemeris09°39’ Cancer 09°39’ Cancer 22°57’ Pisces22°57’ PiscesTravel in 24 hoursTravel in 24 hours 00°57’ 00°57’13°13’13°13’Logarithm of travelLogarithm of travelfrom log tablefrom log table1.40251.40250.25910.2591Permanent log from abovePermanent log from above0.47710.47710.47710.4771Sum of logarithmsSum of logarithms1.87961.87960.73620.7362Travel between noon GMTTravel between noon GMTand noon, local standard timeand noon, local standard timeextrapolated from log tableextrapolated from log table1100°19’00°19’04°24’04°24’Position of planetsPosition of planets10°17’ Cancer 10°17’ Cancer 01°46’ Aries01°46’ Aries"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1.

Simply working with Mars, Jupiter or Saturn. Simply determine the Sun’s travel between noon GMT and determine the Sun’s travel between noon GMT and noon, local time, and proceed from there, using the noon, local time, and proceed from there, using the planet’s position at noon, GMT.

As Fromm states, “Love is an active power love”.

Fromm states, “Love is an activity, not a idea. Fromm states, “Love is an activity, not a passive affect; the active character of love (its first passive affect; the active character of love (its first aspect) can be described by stating that love is aspect) can be described by stating that love is primarily giving.” Not, of course, in the exploitive primarily giving.” Not, of course, in the exploitive or sacrificial sense, but rather as an outward or sacrificial sense, but rather as an outward expression of one’s own potency. In your act of expression of one’s own potency. In your act of giving, you will experience strength and power. In giving, you will experience strength and power.
