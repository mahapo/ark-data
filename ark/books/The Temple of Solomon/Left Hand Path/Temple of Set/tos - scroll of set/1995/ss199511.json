The other is to think in the middle of this time-line. The other is to think that we are at the end of the time-line: standing on that we are at the end of the time-line: standing on the edge of a precipice and being compelled to step the edge of a precipice and being compelled to step forward with no knowledge that there is anything to forward with no knowledge that there is anything to step onto. Yet when we take the step, we find that step onto. Yet when we take the step, we find that this new moment is as firm as the last. But we know this new moment is as firm as the last. But we know that one day we will take the step and fall into the that one day we will take the step and fall into the timeless void.timeless void.The ability to think about the future - being able The ability to think about the future - being able to plan for and fear what is to come - is probably the to plan for and fear what is to come - is probably the most profound component of the Gift of Set. The most profound component of the Gift of Set. The potential to think about and cause change in the potential to think about and cause change in the future is also known as willpower. Will is different future is also known as willpower. Will is different than desire, as it is power over the future. The than desire, as it is power over the future. The question “What do you want to do?” is a question question “What do you want to do?” is a question of desire and tends to be limited to immediate, of desire and tends to be limited to immediate, profane desires. However if the question is “What profane desires. However if the question is “What will you do?”, the potential for future action is will you do?”, the potential for future action is controlled by will.controlled by will.A good exercise for a Setian to see how much A good exercise for a Setian to see how much control you have over the future is to make a note of control you have over the future is to make a note of how you express the future. If you find yourself how you express the future. If you find yourself saying “What am I going to do?”, you are saying “What am I going to do?”, you are wondering how you will react to a situation. Stop wondering how you will react to a situation. Stop there and rephrase the question to “What will I there and rephrase the question to “What will I do?” Stoke the Black Flame up, and will yourself do?” Stoke the Black Flame up, and will yourself into the future. Take a bold step into the void; don’t into the future. Take a bold step into the void; don’t allow yourself to be pushed. You are “going” allow yourself to be pushed. You are “going” through time. Whether you like it or not, things are through time. Whether you like it or not, things are “going” to happen. We don’t want things to “going” to happen. We don’t want things to happen (”hap” means chance or luck); we want to happen (”hap” means chance or luck); we want to apply the Gift so that we can will the future.apply the Gift so that we can will the future.The future is unknown and probably our The future is unknown and probably our greatest fear, and as such the blackest part of the greatest fear, and as such the blackest part of the Black Flame. Our fear of the future is not limited to Black Flame. Our fear of the future is not limited to the fear of death. To alleviate our fear we invest in the fear of death. To alleviate our fear we invest in insurance policies, and we try to order our lives with insurance policies, and we try to order our lives with routine. We have tried to have a greater control of routine. We have tried to have a greater control of the future with calenders, which have become a the future with calenders, which have become a mundane tool of mankind. We have lost the awe mundane tool of mankind. We have lost the awe which people of an earlier time had when the Sun hit which people of an earlier time had when the Sun hit the horizon at the appointed time and place on the the horizon at the appointed time and place on the wheel of Stonehenge. It would have seemed as wheel of Stonehenge. It would have seemed as though the builders of the henge had control of the though the builders of the henge had control of the Sun and willed it to appear on the horizon when Sun and willed it to appear on the horizon when they said it would. What great magicians they were!they said it would. What great magicians they were!Religion uses the fear caused by an unknown Religion uses the fear caused by an unknown future to control people. Christianity has a god with future to control people. Christianity has a god with a plan, albeit an inscrutable plan. Reading the a plan, albeit an inscrutable plan. Reading the Christian Christian BibleBible, however, one can tell that YHVH , however, one can tell that YHVH was not a recipient of the Gift, as it appears he had was not a recipient of the Gift, as it appears he had no control over the future.no control over the future.My contention is that the auxiliary verb “will” My contention is that the auxiliary verb “will” has grown from the noun “will” and originally was has grown from the noun “will” and originally was the prerogative of the gods. If the gods willed it to the prerogative of the gods. If the gods willed it to happen, it came to pass. The terms “it is my will to happen, it came to pass. The terms “it is my will to go” or “it is my will to be” have been shortened to go” or “it is my will to be” have been shortened to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“I will go” and “I will be”. The word “wilt” is an “I will go” and “I will be”. The word “wilt” is an abbreviation of “will to”.abbreviation of “will to”.As gods, can Setians will the future? Can we As gods, can Setians will the future? Can we change or manipulate the future, or are we as change or manipulate the future, or are we as powerless to control the future as YHVH?powerless to control the future as YHVH?I think we need a clear idea of what “will” is so I think we need a clear idea of what “will” is so that we don’t fall into the trap which Wiccans and that we don’t fall into the trap which Wiccans and the like fall into. When they glibly announce “do the like fall into. When they glibly announce “do what thou wilt”, they tend to define the word “will” what thou wilt”, they tend to define the word “will” as “desire” or “want”, which are in the realm of as “desire” or “want”, which are in the realm of the natural (present tense) universe. Freedom of will the natural (present tense) universe. Freedom of will is the freedom to choose your future.is the freedom to choose your future.Our fear of the future is so deeply imbedded Our fear of the future is so deeply imbedded that it is avoided as much as possible. I have noticed that it is avoided as much as possible. I have noticed that when magicians work with “fear” themes, they that when magicians work with “fear” themes, they tend to utilize demons, symbols of death, grotesque tend to utilize demons, symbols of death, grotesque images, and obscenity. These are images which, images, and obscenity. These are images which, though shocking, do not usually engender fear - though shocking, do not usually engender fear - especially amongst Temple members, who are quite especially amongst Temple members, who are quite at home with Gothic symbolism.at home with Gothic symbolism.I don’t put the fear of death in the same I don’t put the fear of death in the same category as the fear of the unknown. We know category as the fear of the unknown. We know death, and we fear the loss of a loved one more than death, and we fear the loss of a loved one more than we fear our own death. Tomorrow, however, holds we fear our own death. Tomorrow, however, holds the greatest fears for us.the greatest fears for us.Why do people turn to astrology and the Tarot Why do people turn to astrology and the Tarot to divine the future? Why also do we hedge around to divine the future? Why also do we hedge around cards such as the Tower when they turn up, and tend cards such as the Tower when they turn up, and tend to dismiss messages of disaster? To believe cards to dismiss messages of disaster? To believe cards can tell us the future leads us down the path of can tell us the future leads us down the path of determinism, a planned future over which we have determinism, a planned future over which we have little or no control, which is a panacea for our fear of little or no control, which is a panacea for our fear of an unknown or unknowable future.an unknown or unknowable future.Seen in this context, the Black Flame is a Gift Seen in this context, the Black Flame is a Gift which the profane would prefer to live without. But which the profane would prefer to live without. But looking into this, the blackest part of the Flame, we looking into this, the blackest part of the Flame, we can discover our desire to have a future, a time to be. can discover our desire to have a future, a time to be. To To XeperXeper we have to get over the fear of death and we have to get over the fear of death and address our fear of tomorrow and of what happens address our fear of tomorrow and of what happens after we have lost the use of our mortal bodies. The after we have lost the use of our mortal bodies. The future is unknown whether it is before death or after future is unknown whether it is before death or after death. You are death. You are goinggoing to die, but to die, but willwill you cease to you cease to be?be?Many of us have done visualizations to explore Many of us have done visualizations to explore the void, but we tend to think in terms of a spacial the void, but we tend to think in terms of a spacial void, and sooner or later bump into stars or demons. void, and sooner or later bump into stars or demons.

The O.S.O.M. working on fear, at the Set-XVI Conclave, O.S.O.M. working on fear, at the Set-XVI Conclave, illustrated this when the fear of being alone turned illustrated this when the fear of being alone turned out to be the dominant theme. The Gift gives us the out to be the dominant theme. The Gift gives us the opportunity to look into the void of the future. opportunity to look into the void of the future. Without will the void is empty and lonely and feared Without will the void is empty and lonely and feared by all who look at it.by all who look at it.XeperXeper is defined as “coming into being under is defined as “coming into being under will”. There is an interesting shift in the time-will”. There is an interesting shift in the time-continuum inherent in this definition: “will” being continuum inherent in this definition: “will” being the future, “coming” being the present. Looking at the future, “coming” being the present. Looking at it this way, we could interpret this definition as it this way, we could interpret this definition as “making your future manifest in the present”. This “making your future manifest in the present”. This can also be seen as creating time, so that when you can also be seen as creating time, so that when you take a step into the future, it is a moment of time take a step into the future, it is a moment of time which you have brought into being.which you have brought into being.Make time to Make time to XeperXeper..______________________________________________________________________[3] [3] Horus & Set -Horus & Set -The Year of the Heb-SedThe Year of the Heb-Sed- by James Graeb III°- by James Graeb III°There has been discussion within the Temple There has been discussion within the Temple with regards to an Order of HarWer. This with regards to an Order of HarWer. This discussion, occurring in Year XXX of the Æon of discussion, occurring in Year XXX of the Æon of Set, is quite timely. In the thirtieth year of a Set, is quite timely. In the thirtieth year of a pharaoh’s reign, a commemorative jubilee known as pharaoh’s reign, a commemorative jubilee known as the Heb-Sed rite was customarily performed. Part of the Heb-Sed rite was customarily performed. Part of the Heb-Sed rite involved the symbolic unification the Heb-Sed rite involved the symbolic unification of the “Two Lands” of Egypt - Upper Egypt and of the “Two Lands” of Egypt - Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt.Lower Egypt.Many scholars believe that as part of the Many scholars believe that as part of the reunification of the Two Lands, which occurred reunification of the Two Lands, which occurred symbolically as part of the Heb-Sed jubilee, the Two symbolically as part of the Heb-Sed jubilee, the Two Powers, those of Set and Horus, were also Powers, those of Set and Horus, were also symbolically re-united. It is thought that Set may symbolically re-united. It is thought that Set may have been associated with Lower Egypt (the Nile have been associated with Lower Egypt (the Nile delta) and that Horus may have been associated with delta) and that Horus may have been associated with Upper Egypt (the southern regions).Upper Egypt (the southern regions).My own speculations into this joining of the My own speculations into this joining of the Two Powers, which traditionally occurred during the Two Powers, which traditionally occurred during the Heb-Sed festivities, inspired me to take a new Heb-Sed festivities, inspired me to take a new magical name: Khasekhemway Merenset. This magical name: Khasekhemway Merenset. This translates roughly as “Lord of the Two Powers, translates roughly as “Lord of the Two Powers, Beloved of Set”. Historically Khasekhemway was Beloved of Set”. Historically Khasekhemway was the last pharaoh of the Second Dynasty of Egypt, the last pharaoh of the Second Dynasty of Egypt, and is noteworthy because he displayed both the Set and is noteworthy because he displayed both the Set animal and the Horus falcon in his pharaonic animal and the Horus falcon in his pharaonic inscriptions. The working that I performed with the inscriptions. The working that I performed with the Bull of Ombos Pylon as part of taking this name, is Bull of Ombos Pylon as part of taking this name, is described in the Pylon publication described in the Pylon publication Vox TauriVox Tauri (highly recommended).(highly recommended).Many of us in the Temple are accustomed to Many of us in the Temple are accustomed to think of HarWer as the natural cosmic order of the think of HarWer as the natural cosmic order of the objective universe, to which those of us who objective universe, to which those of us who embrace the Gift of Set are in fundamental embrace the Gift of Set are in fundamental opposition.
