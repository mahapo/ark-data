XeperXeper is “becoming” is “becoming” according to Ipsissimus Aquino. It represents the according to Ipsissimus Aquino.

All it takes is one word to of the human psyche. All it takes is one word to build the framework upon which you can hang the build the framework upon which you can hang the concept itself, and concept itself, and XeperXeper is that word. is that word.It is foolish to believe that just because It is foolish to believe that just because XeperXeper was Uttered in the year X ÆS that what it embodies was Uttered in the year X ÆS that what it embodies did not exist before that. On the contrary, did not exist before that. On the contrary, XeperXeper has has always been there; it’s just that few understood its always been there; it’s just that few understood its meaning - and if they did, it was only a fragment of meaning - and if they did, it was only a fragment of the whole.the whole.This is why the Æon of Thelema and Age of This is why the Æon of Thelema and Age of Satan came into being.

One such tool is the one needs tools. One such tool is the Word Remanifest as Uttered by Ipsissimus Lewis. Word Remanifest as Uttered by Ipsissimus Lewis. Like Like XeperXeper this is the fundamental lynch-pin upon this is the fundamental lynch-pin upon which a universal concept hangs.which a universal concept hangs.Remanifest is the idea of the crystallization of Remanifest is the idea of the crystallization of knowledge and experiences gathered during the knowledge and experiences gathered during the process of process of XeperXeper. This crystallization, i.e. . This crystallization, i.e. Remanifestation, is the process whereby the Remanifestation, is the process whereby the psychepsyche integrates what has been learned and thus moves integrates what has been learned and thus moves forward to forward to XeperXeper again. This will then lead once again. This will then lead once more to the process of Remanifestation - a continual more to the process of Remanifestation - a continual cycle that never ends as long as one wills to cycle that never ends as long as one wills to XeperXeper..As explained by Ipsissimus Lewis in the As explained by Ipsissimus Lewis in the Crystal Crystal TabletTablet, the Word Remanifest initially looked into , the Word Remanifest initially looked into “continuation of the self once the biological “continuation of the self once the biological envelope eventually ceased”. This is one obvious envelope eventually ceased”. This is one obvious part of the word, but the self continues and part of the word, but the self continues and undergoes undergoes XeperXeper while the biological envelope while the biological envelope exists. This is the reason Remanifest is such an exists.

The first lies within to be two aspects of HarWer. The first lies within our physical bodies, instilled with the Black Flame our physical bodies, instilled with the Black Flame by Set, and used by us for purposes of interacting by Set, and used by us for purposes of interacting with the OU - primarily in the form of LBM. with the OU - primarily in the form of LBM.

It is as we know it is not pure Setian self awareness. It is a confused sort of half- awareness, partially a confused sort of half- awareness, partially intelligent and partially mechanical, being a intelligent and partially mechanical, being a composite fusion of Setian awareness and Osirian composite fusion of Setian awareness and Osirian mechanism. In the cosmology of the mechanism. In the cosmology of the Book of Book of Coming Forth by NightComing Forth by Night, HarWer owes what little , HarWer owes what little intelligence he has to Set, his creator.

In so cause the OU to reflect our own idealized SU. In so doing, can we help but imbue that OU with aspects doing, can we help but imbue that OU with aspects of our own consciousness?
