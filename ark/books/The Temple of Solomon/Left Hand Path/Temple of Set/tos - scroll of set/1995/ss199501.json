Death is of course the Now what of death? Death is of course the Great Unmanifested in our lives. It changes every Great Unmanifested in our lives. It changes every day; it informs and tests. There is no natural event day; it informs and tests. There is no natural event that has the force it has on our that has the force it has on our psychepsyche. Like .

Unfortunately most of mankind turn to a do. Unfortunately most of mankind turn to a worship of their ideas of death, which is their own worship of their ideas of death, which is their own creation.creation.We can consider this mysterious thing We can consider this mysterious thing intellectually or emotionally, but the real experience intellectually or emotionally, but the real experience is going to be different. We do have one clue, in that is going to be different.

We who live freely within the LHP know mankind. We who live freely within the LHP know that there is no hope for mankind, but for us there is that there is no hope for mankind, but for us there is a hope that we can learn to see our death. Let it a hope that we can learn to see our death. Let it install in us a sense of urgency, an Understanding install in us a sense of urgency, an Understanding of the unmanifest, of darkness herself. Then we will of the unmanifest, of darkness herself. Then we will cease to view darkness as our friend, and see her for cease to view darkness as our friend, and see her for what she really is - an absolutely necessary element what she really is - an absolutely necessary element for our initiation. If death weren’t of darkness - if for our initiation. If death weren’t of darkness - if we could freely speak with the dead - if we we could freely speak with the dead - if we knewknew - - then we wouldn’t have the possibility for Becoming: then we wouldn’t have the possibility for Becoming: none of the urgency, none of the many-layeredness none of the urgency, none of the many-layeredness of of XeperXeper..But if darkness is not our friend, and as death is But if darkness is not our friend, and as death is certainly not our friend, are we friendless? No, for certainly not our friend, are we friendless? No, for the first of our kind is our friend for creating these the first of our kind is our friend for creating these things. The Prince of Darkness created the things. The Prince of Darkness created the unmanifest with his first thought: “unmanifest with his first thought: “Xepera Xeper Xepera Xeper XeperuXeperu.” With each use of that formula, good or .” With each use of that formula, good or bad, we create the darkness around us and beckon to bad, we create the darkness around us and beckon to ourselves manifestations of the darkness.

Mankind’s element in the year of the Heb-Sed? Mankind’s relationship with the unmanifested has changed relationship with the unmanifested has changed because of our Æon. The rate that the new - which because of our Æon. The rate that the new - which to say the dark - manifests is much, much faster to say the dark - manifests is much, much faster now.
