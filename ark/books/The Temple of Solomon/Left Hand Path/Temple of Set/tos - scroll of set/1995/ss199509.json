Graeb III°- by James T. Graeb III°Last summer I was taking a class at the Last summer I was taking a class at the University of California at Berkeley. The professor University of California at Berkeley. The professor had received his doctorate in Philosophy from had received his doctorate in Philosophy from Oxford University and a post-doctorate in Oxford University and a post-doctorate in Intellectual History at Tubington University in Intellectual History at Tubington University in Germany. We were reading Hegel’s Germany. We were reading Hegel’s Science of Science of LogicLogic, Hegel’s opus on the dialectic. Of course we , Hegel’s opus on the dialectic. Of course we doctoral students think we’re a pretty smart bunch, doctoral students think we’re a pretty smart bunch, and it wasn’t very long before someone stated that and it wasn’t very long before someone stated that he understood the dialectic: It involved thesis, he understood the dialectic: It involved thesis, antithesis and then a synthesis. The professor antithesis and then a synthesis. The professor recoiled at this and stated: “Oh, you must be talking recoiled at this and stated: “Oh, you must be talking about Fichte or Schelling. Hegel never uses the about Fichte or Schelling. Hegel never uses the terms ‘thesis, antithesis, synthesis’.”terms ‘thesis, antithesis, synthesis’.”Well, that rather pointed remark has stayed with Well, that rather pointed remark has stayed with me and I recommend that you try it on someone me and I recommend that you try it on someone whenever you find yourself trying to explain Hegel. whenever you find yourself trying to explain Hegel. The remark has the general effect of a mild stun gun The remark has the general effect of a mild stun gun on the victim, and generally will leave him on the victim, and generally will leave him speechless for a short while. I recount this remark to speechless for a short while. I recount this remark to you as a preamble to this discussion of the dialectic you as a preamble to this discussion of the dialectic as it may apply to the Horus principle. While I as it may apply to the Horus principle. While I might in general allude to the notions of Set and might in general allude to the notions of Set and Horus as being dialectical opposites, like the thesis Horus as being dialectical opposites, like the thesis and antithesis, there are far more subtle nuances at and antithesis, there are far more subtle nuances at work: nuances which go far beyond the scope of work: nuances which go far beyond the scope of this article.this article.As many of you know, Magister Barrett has As many of you know, Magister Barrett has been doing quite a bit of work on the process of been doing quite a bit of work on the process of initiation as a dialectical movement. At the risk of initiation as a dialectical movement. At the risk of oversimplification of that work, the dialectical oversimplification of that work, the dialectical movement and the alchemical process of movement and the alchemical process of transformation seem to have substantial similarities. transformation seem to have substantial similarities. It is in the spirit of Magister Barrett’s use of the It is in the spirit of Magister Barrett’s use of the initiatory process as an alchemical dialectic that I initiatory process as an alchemical dialectic that I will set forth some thoughts that I have regarding will set forth some thoughts that I have regarding the two principles of Set and Horus.the two principles of Set and Horus.If reduced to a philosophical or metaphysical If reduced to a philosophical or metaphysical principle, Set would represent the principle of isolate principle, Set would represent the principle of isolate intelligence or individual self consciousness that is intelligence or individual self consciousness that is centered in itself. That is, Set would be each centered in itself. That is, Set would be each person’s psychecentric individuality and person’s psychecentric individuality and independence. Horus, then, would represent the independence. Horus, then, would represent the principle of that which revolves around this principle of that which revolves around this psychecentric center: the universe of thoughts, psychecentric center: the universe of thoughts, feelings, and the content of psychic activity. Hence I feelings, and the content of psychic activity. Hence I would suggest both Set and Horus are necessary would suggest both Set and Horus are necessary elements to self-conscious existence.elements to self-conscious existence.What I want to suggest in this article is that the What I want to suggest in this article is that the principles of opposition and harmony alternatively principles of opposition and harmony alternatively dominate the relationship between the Set principle dominate the relationship between the Set principle and the Horus principle, such that a dialectical and the Horus principle, such that a dialectical movement of initiation occurs. To oversimplify for movement of initiation occurs. To oversimplify for ease of discussion: If the self and the content of the ease of discussion: If the self and the content of the psyche were at all times in an antinomian psyche were at all times in an antinomian relationship (a relationship of opposition), psychic relationship (a relationship of opposition), psychic imbalance and disturbance would ensue. If the self imbalance and disturbance would ensue. If the self and the content of the psyche were in perfect and the content of the psyche were in perfect harmony all the time, an individual might be blissful, harmony all the time, an individual might be blissful, but there would be no initiatory movement.but there would be no initiatory movement.Hence the relationship between Set and Horus Hence the relationship between Set and Horus would have to alternate between the antinomian would have to alternate between the antinomian attitude and the harmonious attitude. In Egyptian attitude and the harmonious attitude. In Egyptian mythology Set and Horus were brothers (i.e. the mythology Set and Horus were brothers (i.e. the harmonious relationship) and were also uncle and harmonious relationship) and were also uncle and nephew fighting for kingship in the outer world (i.e. nephew fighting for kingship in the outer world (i.e. the antinomian relationship). While few ancient the antinomian relationship). While few ancient Egyptians apparently read Hegel, they may have had Egyptians apparently read Hegel, they may have had some notions regarding this dialectical relationship. some notions regarding this dialectical relationship. However the dialectical assertions in this article are However the dialectical assertions in this article are emphatically not based on our knowledge of emphatically not based on our knowledge of Egyptian culture.Egyptian culture.Nonetheless the parallel is perhaps not Nonetheless the parallel is perhaps not unreasonable. For initiatory progress the self and unreasonable. For initiatory progress the self and the content of the psyche would need to move the content of the psyche would need to move through alternating phases. At times of initiatory through alternating phases. At times of initiatory movement the psyche might seem strained or hard-movement the psyche might seem strained or hard-pressed. It then recovers its balance on a new level pressed. It then recovers its balance on a new level as the initiatory movement has become part of the as the initiatory movement has become part of the individual. This harmony would then last for awhile individual. This harmony would then last for awhile until further initiatory progress were set in motion until further initiatory progress were set in motion and another period of inner conflict would and another period of inner conflict would commence. This movement of initiation, as it leads commence. This movement of initiation, as it leads to ever increasing states of consciousness, would be to ever increasing states of consciousness, would be dialectical in nature.dialectical in nature.Hence while Set and Horus are not in Hence while Set and Horus are not in themselves a thesis and an antithesis, they permit the themselves a thesis and an antithesis, they permit the dialectical process to operate such that a new dialectical process to operate such that a new synthesis of consciousness (which we call initiation) synthesis of consciousness (which we call initiation) occurs. As presented above, the moving force in the occurs. As presented above, the moving force in the initiatory process is the Set principle. It is Set acting initiatory process is the Set principle. It is Set acting upon the content of our psyches that permits upon the content of our psyches that permits initiatory progress. It might also be noted that if the initiatory progress. It might also be noted that if the foregoing is valid, then all initiation would involve foregoing is valid, then all initiation would involve Set as the initiating factor: Set, the Lord of the Left-Set as the initiating factor: Set, the Lord of the Left-Hand Path.Hand Path.______________________________________________________________________[2] [2] Springtime Magic in Texas!Springtime Magic in Texas!- by Rosemary Webb III°- by Rosemary Webb III°We’re holding a Conclave in Texas in late We’re holding a Conclave in Texas in late Spring, and we’d love to have fellow Setians from Spring, and we’d love to have fellow Setians from all over join us.

The pharaoh can be seen as an pharaoh’s reign. The pharaoh can be seen as an archetype of the Elect of Set, and the pharaoh’s archetype of the Elect of Set, and the pharaoh’s kingdom Set’s Temple. The Heb-Sed year was a kingdom Set’s Temple. The Heb-Sed year was a time of renewal for the pharaoh personally and for time of renewal for the pharaoh personally and for his kingdom through him, since he is the presence his kingdom through him, since he is the presence of the god(s) among his people. His being then not of the god(s) among his people. His being then not only nurtured all that depended upon him, but his only nurtured all that depended upon him, but his was the task of resolving all discord that threatened was the task of resolving all discord that threatened him and the kingdom, from within and without.

We are all at home with each other when things go We are all at home with each other when things go peaceably, when we are able to share magically and peaceably, when we are able to share magically and discuss our differences with tolerance. But discuss our differences with tolerance. But sometimes misunderstanding and intolerance give sometimes misunderstanding and intolerance give rise to painful silence, and the magic we shared rise to painful silence, and the magic we shared becomes hidden. What then is the nature of discord, becomes hidden. What then is the nature of discord, and how can it contribute to and how can it contribute to XeperXeper??One technique that is helpful when Setians are One technique that is helpful when Setians are faced with a dilemma, either personally or faced with a dilemma, either personally or collectively, is to turn it into a mystery. A mystery is collectively, is to turn it into a mystery. A mystery is something we don’t know enough about to fully tap something we don’t know enough about to fully tap its power. So I called into being the Mystery of its power. So I called into being the Mystery of Discord and offer this to the Temple of Set as my Discord and offer this to the Temple of Set as my gift for the Heb-Sed year.gift for the Heb-Sed year.I invite each one who reads this article to explore I invite each one who reads this article to explore the Mystery of Discord as it operates in your life, the Mystery of Discord as it operates in your life, both on the mundane and the spiritual. Study its both on the mundane and the spiritual.

ThenThen look at it for its magical power, and you look at it for its magical power, and you should be able to see it as an opportunity for should be able to see it as an opportunity for XeperXeper much more easily than without this process.much more easily than without this process.To offer some preliminary insight on the To offer some preliminary insight on the Mystery of Discord, I turned to several traditional Mystery of Discord, I turned to several traditional occult symbols as well as well as insights from past occult symbols as well as well as insights from past rituals. I chose the Tarot Trump card “Tower”, the rituals. I chose the Tarot Trump card “Tower”, the rune rune RaidhoRaidho, and the , and the I ChingI Ching’s One Fixed Law. In ’s One Fixed Law. In all of these I saw the influence of the Prince of all of these I saw the influence of the Prince of Darkness and found a word of wisdom for us as his Darkness and found a word of wisdom for us as his Elect. And that word of wisdom is that differences Elect. And that word of wisdom is that differences have a have a magical powermagical power, beyond any philosophical , beyond any philosophical consideration, that contributes to consideration, that contributes to XeperXeper on an on an individual basis as well as for the larger Temple.individual basis as well as for the larger Temple.The “Tower” card is perhaps the one feared The “Tower” card is perhaps the one feared most by readers, as it portends drastic change, most by readers, as it portends drastic change, upheaval, open conflict with the potential for leading upheaval, open conflict with the potential for leading to ruin, and means that things will never be the same to ruin, and means that things will never be the same again. So it aptly represents Discord. Aleister again. So it aptly represents Discord. Aleister Crowley in his Crowley in his Book of ThothBook of Thoth states: states:[The Tower card] in its simplest [The Tower card] in its simplest interpretation ... refers to the manifestation of interpretation ... refers to the manifestation of cosmic energy in its grossest form ... It may be cosmic energy in its grossest form ... It may be taken as the preface to ... the Coming of a New taken as the preface to ... the Coming of a New Æon. This being so, it seems to indicate the Æon. This being so, it seems to indicate the quintessential quality of the Lord of the Æon.quintessential quality of the Lord of the Æon.I understand this as the quality (process) of I understand this as the quality (process) of profound changeprofound change or or XeperXeper, so that while the card , so that while the card represents the worst-case scenario, it also represents represents the worst-case scenario, it also represents the potential for a new state of being - the potential for a new state of being - ifif as Setians as Setians we can keep our hands off the panic button long we can keep our hands off the panic button long enough to get a spiritual “grip” on what our enough to get a spiritual “grip” on what our options really are.options really are.Crowley bears this out by going on to explain Crowley bears this out by going on to explain that the ultimate reality which is Perfection is really that the ultimate reality which is Perfection is really Nothingness. “Hence all manifestations, however Nothingness. “Hence all manifestations, however glorious, however delightful, are stains.” But again, glorious, however delightful, are stains.” But again, this leaves the door open for LHP exploration into this leaves the door open for LHP exploration into the nature of Nothingness, which itself is subject to the nature of Nothingness, which itself is subject to illusion [since it can be named] and therefore also illusion [since it can be named] and therefore also subject to the Law of Opposites. By that I mean subject to the Law of Opposites. By that I mean where Nothingness exists so does Perfection, and where Nothingness exists so does Perfection, and therein lies the Mystery of the unKnowable, the therein lies the Mystery of the unKnowable, the Ain Ain SophSoph of the Hermeticists and the enigma of being. of the Hermeticists and the enigma of being. The unKnowable is the allKnowable. It’s a matter The unKnowable is the allKnowable. It’s a matter of daring to go that far by conscious choice, of not of daring to go that far by conscious choice, of not accepting that we have reached the limit of accepting that we have reached the limit of perception or understanding.perception or understanding.Crowley goes on to say: “The above should Crowley goes on to say: “The above should make it clear that magical symbols must always be make it clear that magical symbols must always be understood in a double sense, each contradictory of understood in a double sense, each contradictory of the other.”the other.”But it occurred to me that all of life is like that. But it occurred to me that all of life is like that. In everything is the seed of its opposite and In everything is the seed of its opposite and therefore its transformation as portrayed in the Yin-therefore its transformation as portrayed in the Yin-Yang symbol of Ultimate Reality. When this truth is Yang symbol of Ultimate Reality. When this truth is perceived for its perceived for its magicalmagical value beyond any value beyond any philosophical considerations and harnessed by the philosophical considerations and harnessed by the Elect, it becomes the power within the process of Elect, it becomes the power within the process of Balance. It is the activity within Balance. It is the activity within TaoTao (which is not an (which is not an inertial system at all), and it is essential to the inertial system at all), and it is essential to the operation of operation of RunaRuna..Next I turned to Next I turned to RaidhoRaidho, which I see as a rune of , which I see as a rune of change. It is called a chariot or wagon, and is change. It is called a chariot or wagon, and is interpreted as a “vehicle on the path to cosmic interpreted as a “vehicle on the path to cosmic power”. A chariot is useless without a team of power”. A chariot is useless without a team of horses to pull it and a driver to direct it. In that horses to pull it and a driver to direct it. In that combination is the balance by counterpoint of the combination is the balance by counterpoint of the chariot’s basic inertia with the potentially wild chariot’s basic inertia with the potentially wild power of the team, focused and controlled by the power of the team, focused and controlled by the will of the magician-driver. The chariot represents will of the magician-driver. The chariot represents things that need to change, or that will be changed things that need to change, or that will be changed by opposition. The team represents the forces that by opposition. The team represents the forces that challenge the very nature of the chariot, testing it for challenge the very nature of the chariot, testing it for all its worth. If it falls apart, the driver is without a all its worth. If it falls apart, the driver is without a means to continue his journey except on foot. If it means to continue his journey except on foot.

Samarrai II°- by Sami A. Samarrai II°Ever since I first encountered the concept of the Ever since I first encountered the concept of the curse in the curse in the Satanic BibleSatanic Bible, I have wondered how we, , I have wondered how we, as Black Magicians, should ethically decide whom as Black Magicians, should ethically decide whom to curse, and why.to curse, and why.As I read more of Magus LaVey, it became As I read more of Magus LaVey, it became apparent to me that the curse was an extremely apparent to me that the curse was an extremely important part of his magical philosophy. But then important part of his magical philosophy. But then so were ethics.so were ethics.The impression that I got of Satanic ethics, The impression that I got of Satanic ethics, however, was that they were simply based on however, was that they were simply based on avoiding problems with the law! That seemed to be avoiding problems with the law! That seemed to be the basic guide.the basic guide.We all know, however, that ethics and the law do We all know, however, that ethics and the law do not necessarily coincide. In fact it has been my not necessarily coincide. In fact it has been my observation that they are often on opposite side of a observation that they are often on opposite side of a given issue. For example, we are a law-abiding, given issue. For example, we are a law-abiding, above-ground type of organization which does its above-ground type of organization which does its best to cooperate with the laws and authority of the best to cooperate with the laws and authority of the United States; I probably would not have become United States; I probably would not have become part of the Temple were it otherwise. What if a law part of the Temple were it otherwise. What if a law were passed [and this is not at all that far-fetched] were passed [and this is not at all that far-fetched] which made us and our activities illegal? Would we which made us and our activities illegal? Would we cooperate? I will leave that as an open question. The cooperate? I will leave that as an open question. The point is, ethics are a far more complicated issue than point is, ethics are a far more complicated issue than just cooperation with the authorities. This brings me just cooperation with the authorities. This brings me back to the curse. How do we ethically decide back to the curse. How do we ethically decide whether to curse someone or not?whether to curse someone or not?When I asked this question of other Setians, the When I asked this question of other Setians, the only answer that I kept getting was “only to curse only answer that I kept getting was “only to curse someone who deserves it”. This is a very subjective someone who deserves it”. This is a very subjective decision. I do not believe that these decisions should decision. I do not believe that these decisions should be made lightly, but I also acknowledge that there be made lightly, but I also acknowledge that there are times when there really is an S.O.B. who are times when there really is an S.O.B. who deserves to be fried. How does one reconcile this deserves to be fried. How does one reconcile this dilemma?dilemma?I have come up with what could be regarded as a I have come up with what could be regarded as a partial solution at least. It is based on the reasons partial solution at least. It is based on the reasons behind placing a curse. They are “vengeance” and behind placing a curse. They are “vengeance” and “peace of mind”.“peace of mind”.First looking at vengeance, let us ask ourselves First looking at vengeance, let us ask ourselves why we need it. Does vengeance change the past? why we need it. Does vengeance change the past? Does it cause an injury not to have happened? No! Does it cause an injury not to have happened? No! It does none of these. Why curse someone for a It does none of these. Why curse someone for a past wrong then? This person could be a better past wrong then? This person could be a better individual by this time; he may have forgotten what individual by this time; he may have forgotten what he did to you; he may even be dead. What’s the he did to you; he may even be dead. What’s the use?use?It is my feeling that when one is injured by It is my feeling that when one is injured by another, a dæmonic remnant of the injuring party is another, a dæmonic remnant of the injuring party is left inside the injured party. This remnant is at once left inside the injured party. This remnant is at once independent of the injuring party. If the victim is independent of the injuring party. If the victim is weak-willed or young, however, this dæmon can weak-willed or young, however, this dæmon can become extremely powerful, filling its host with become extremely powerful, filling its host with hatred, feelings of inadequacy, uncontrollable hatred, feelings of inadequacy, uncontrollable emotions, you name it. This is where the curse of emotions, you name it. This is where the curse of vengeance can be most effective. The person who vengeance can be most effective. The person who committed the original injury is not longer committed the original injury is not longer important, just the monster which has been left important, just the monster which has been left behind. This has given rise to what I call the internal behind. This has given rise to what I call the internal curse. One flings a curse, but keeps it within one’s curse. One flings a curse, but keeps it within one’s own subjective universe seeking to destroy the own subjective universe seeking to destroy the dæmonic remnant which has been the cause of dæmonic remnant which has been the cause of suffering. In this way, the original party is left suffering. In this way, the original party is left completely out of the picture.completely out of the picture.What about the second reason, peace of mind? What about the second reason, peace of mind? In this case, somebody is out to get you and making In this case, somebody is out to get you and making your life miserable. As far as I am concerned, this is your life miserable. As far as I am concerned, this is someone who deserves to be fried, and I would someone who deserves to be fried, and I would throw a curse at full strength at him. Once again, throw a curse at full strength at him. Once again, however, once the problem is resolved, it is time to however, once the problem is resolved, it is time to close the books on the case and get on with one’s close the books on the case and get on with one’s life.life.This is, to me, related to the idea of the twin This is, to me, related to the idea of the twin flames, the Black and the Red.

You type English into the top, and the program translates it English into the top, and the program translates it into German in the bottom. Then you copy the into German in the bottom.

You can also teach the dictionary you want to take.

If you type “Let’s hang and idiomatic expression. If you type “Let’s hang out in your room in Vegas” to Magister Winkhart, out in your room in Vegas” to Magister Winkhart, the program will probably tell him that you would the program will probably tell him that you would like to hang yourself from his window. So with like to hang yourself from his window.
