These points or angles of consciousness are loci that may be communicated consciousness are loci that may be communicated through the Setian initiatory process, and through through the Setian initiatory process, and through which the self may pass in its own quest for which the self may pass in its own quest for immortality.

The Dæmons reveal that once they bestow the Gift, The Dæmons reveal that once they bestow the Gift, they cannot control it. In that framework man is they cannot control it. In that framework man is hailed as divine. Notably the “Statement of Belial” hailed as divine. Notably the “Statement of Belial” is the great statement of not only hailing man as he is the great statement of not only hailing man as he is, but also hinting at a purpose beyond the plane of is, but also hinting at a purpose beyond the plane of the now.the now.Why was this necessary? The Gift had been Why was this necessary? The Gift had been given in the dim past. There were two reasons for given in the dim past. There were two reasons for the reception. Firstly was to begin the work of the reception. Firstly was to begin the work of destruction. Mankind had used the Gift in a blind destruction. Mankind had used the Gift in a blind and fitful way, raising it in various times and places and fitful way, raising it in various times and places to near-perfection, then destroying it. In short to near-perfection, then destroying it. In short mankind had modeled the Gift on patterns found in mankind had modeled the Gift on patterns found in the realm of constancy (nature/OU). Mankind was the realm of constancy (nature/OU). Mankind was poised to destroy its freedom through the use of its poised to destroy its freedom through the use of its very own unnatural creation. The Age of Satan was very own unnatural creation. The Age of Satan was the breaking of cultural centrism. The post-Vietnam the breaking of cultural centrism. The post-Vietnam world is now a very diverse place, and true world is now a very diverse place, and true individualism is the only way to avoid annihilation. individualism is the only way to avoid annihilation.

These didn’t come as the non-natural realm as well. These didn’t come as a series of gifts bestowed as a reward for patient a series of gifts bestowed as a reward for patient service to God or nature - but could be created by service to God or nature - but could be created by the will of the individual.the will of the individual.Again this manifestation happened throughout Again this manifestation happened throughout the world, and like all true æonic moments had cast the world, and like all true æonic moments had cast its shadow before it. Around the world an interest in its shadow before it. Around the world an interest in spiritual technologies for self empowerment spiritual technologies for self empowerment appeared. Notably Wotan, the archetype of the appeared. Notably Wotan, the archetype of the magician who seizes the Gift, manifested to Stephen magician who seizes the Gift, manifested to Stephen Edred Flowers in the Year IX. We also had that Edred Flowers in the Year IX. We also had that great outer hall called the New Age movement great outer hall called the New Age movement bloom around us. How convenient that makes bloom around us.
