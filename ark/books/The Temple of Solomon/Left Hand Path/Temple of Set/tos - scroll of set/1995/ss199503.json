These inertial laws tend ultimately to total These inertial laws tend ultimately to total consistency, threatening to devour all that is consistency, threatening to devour all that is individual and non-conforming. Why? Because it is individual and non-conforming. Why? Because it is easier that way - and non-conscious inertia favors easier that way - and non-conscious inertia favors the easiest course.the easiest course.Setian self-ordering is contrary to this. Rather Setian self-ordering is contrary to this. Rather than relying upon the “asleep” state of the than relying upon the “asleep” state of the instinctual animal nature, we choose the difficult and instinctual animal nature, we choose the difficult and “awake” state of self-knowledge, evolution and “awake” state of self-knowledge, evolution and effort towards that which is higher, nobler, and more effort towards that which is higher, nobler, and more individual. We seek to tear ourselves free from this individual. We seek to tear ourselves free from this cosmic consistency that would blank us out. In cosmic consistency that would blank us out.

The self is conscious recognition and integration. The self is made a discreet and separate entity in its own right, made a discreet and separate entity in its own right, awake and aware.

And [if it possessed awareness] the own entropy. And [if it possessed awareness] the cosmic order would perceive the self as chaotic, as cosmic order would perceive the self as chaotic, as the Setian has rebelled against its consistency and the Setian has rebelled against its consistency and championed individuality over union. These terms championed individuality over union. These terms “order” and “chaos” are therefore relative, “order” and “chaos” are therefore relative, dependent upon context. We seek to order and dependent upon context. We seek to order and understand our selves, but revile the smothering understand our selves, but revile the smothering order of the cosmos.

A succession of existentialists - Kierkegaard, succession of existentialists - Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre, Jaspers, Marcel - grappled with Heidegger, Sartre, Jaspers, Marcel - grappled with this situation, trying to move the realization into a this situation, trying to move the realization into a philosophy, but failed - in my opinion because they philosophy, but failed - in my opinion because they were all unaware of the Form of Set, its were all unaware of the Form of Set, its juxtaposition to the OU, and its relationship to juxtaposition to the OU, and its relationship to individual human self-consciousness. This is why individual human self-consciousness.
