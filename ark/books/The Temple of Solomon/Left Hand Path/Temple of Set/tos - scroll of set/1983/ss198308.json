Aquino VI°- by Michael A. Aquino VI°Divination, by one definition, is the explanation Divination, by one definition, is the explanation of the present or the prediction of the future by of the present or the prediction of the future by recourse to a device or machine. By this definition recourse to a device or machine. By this definition both a crystal ball and an electronic computer with a both a crystal ball and an electronic computer with a social forecasting program are divination devices.social forecasting program are divination devices.Obviously we don’t think of the two as similar.

The computer’s program offers us an objective way The computer’s program offers us an objective way to extrapolate trends, cross-reference and weigh to extrapolate trends, cross-reference and weigh various social developments, and come up with a various social developments, and come up with a composite picture. Nor is this “rational” means of composite picture. Nor is this “rational” means of prediction limited to computers; futurologists prediction limited to computers; futurologists employ many similar techniques to approach valid employ many similar techniques to approach valid forecasts. The best basic text on this subject I have forecasts. The best basic text on this subject I have encountered remains #21H on the reading list, and encountered remains #21H on the reading list, and the World Future Society in Washington, D.C. can the World Future Society in Washington, D.C. can offer many more resources for the interested Setian.offer many more resources for the interested Setian.Scientific forecasting, whether modest or Scientific forecasting, whether modest or exhaustive in scope, falls into the category of Lesser exhaustive in scope, falls into the category of Lesser Black Magic (LBM) to the extent one employs its Black Magic (LBM) to the extent one employs its revelations to accomplish something. Is there a revelations to accomplish something. Is there a Greater Black Magic (GBM) counterpart?Greater Black Magic (GBM) counterpart?Indeed there are several supernatural [or at least Indeed there are several supernatural [or at least super-rational] devices reputed as means of super-rational] devices reputed as means of divination. The simplest - and superficially the least divination. The simplest - and superficially the least impressive - are “windows” of one sort or another: impressive - are “windows” of one sort or another: pools of black ink, “shew-stones”, witches’ pools of black ink, “shew-stones”, witches’ mirrors, and of course the crystal ball. The more mirrors, and of course the crystal ball. The more impressive devices are ones which convey the impressive devices are ones which convey the impression of an intricate and complicated impression of an intricate and complicated “machinery” behind them - Tarot, astrology, and “machinery” behind them - Tarot, astrology, and the the I ChingI Ching..Certainly divination in general has had a bad Certainly divination in general has had a bad press: There is no other field so readily associated press: There is no other field so readily associated with crankdom. The tabloid headline “World’s with crankdom. The tabloid headline “World’s Leading Psychics’ Predictions” has long since Leading Psychics’ Predictions” has long since become a bedraggled cliche’. Yet many people still become a bedraggled cliche’. Yet many people still study and play with divination devices either for study and play with divination devices either for simple entertainment or because such devices serve, simple entertainment or because such devices serve, in Anton LaVey’s words, as “God in sports in Anton LaVey’s words, as “God in sports clothes” - a means of reaching out to the mystery clothes” - a means of reaching out to the mystery and glamor of the metaphysical unknown without and glamor of the metaphysical unknown without having to involve oneself in the tedious mumbo-having to involve oneself in the tedious mumbo-jumbo of religion or the brain-strain of higher jumbo of religion or the brain-strain of higher philosophy.
