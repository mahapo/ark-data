Few ever penalties, and other changes in legislation. Few ever mention the need for new skills such as better mention the need for new skills such as better training for police officers, methods of personal training for police officers, methods of personal survival in violent situations, or self-defense in survival in violent situations, or self-defense in general.general.As an option, as early as elementary school, I As an option, as early as elementary school, I chose self-defense training as the means of dealing chose self-defense training as the means of dealing directly with the problem of gangs and bullies. I directly with the problem of gangs and bullies. I studied the forbidden art of Shaolin boxing, known studied the forbidden art of Shaolin boxing, known in Cantonese as in Cantonese as Sil Lu Ch’uan FaSil Lu Ch’uan Fa..In the past, martial arts have been used in In the past, martial arts have been used in response to attacks by hostile invaders. In Okinawa, response to attacks by hostile invaders. In Okinawa, for example, “some 350 years ago, invading for example, “some 350 years ago, invading warlords prohibited the use of weapons. So the warlords prohibited the use of weapons. So the Okinawans turned to Karate for protection.”Okinawans turned to Karate for protection.”11I have an intimate understanding of the perils the I have an intimate understanding of the perils the Okinawans encountered, since in my life history Okinawans encountered, since in my life history repeated itself. My “invading warlords”, however, repeated itself. My “invading warlords”, however, were the leaders of gangs who roamed the school were the leaders of gangs who roamed the school grounds preying on the weak like a pack of hungry grounds preying on the weak like a pack of hungry dogs. I was nine years old when I first experienced dogs. I was nine years old when I first experienced defeat at the hands of an experienced warrior - a defeat at the hands of an experienced warrior - a deceptive youth who feigned friendship in order to deceptive youth who feigned friendship in order to lead me to an uninhabited locality. I immediately lead me to an uninhabited locality. I immediately decided to learn everything I could about all the arts decided to learn everything I could about all the arts of self-defense. I began training with a simple of self-defense. I began training with a simple “right-arm throw”, practicing with friends I could “right-arm throw”, practicing with friends I could trust.trust.It was only a few months later when the warrior It was only a few months later when the warrior came again with his gang to make sport of me. This came again with his gang to make sport of me. This time he shoved me using his right hand against my time he shoved me using his right hand against my shoulder. I seized the opportunity, and with the shoulder. I seized the opportunity, and with the enthusiasm and speed of a tiger slammed him to the enthusiasm and speed of a tiger slammed him to the ground with all the strength I could put into a single ground with all the strength I could put into a single circular motion. They were too confused and awed circular motion. They were too confused and awed to continue their aggression. Instead they tended the to continue their aggression. Instead they tended the wounds of their leader.wounds of their leader.The value of the martial arts was learned in my The value of the martial arts was learned in my study of study of Sil Lu Ch’uan FaSil Lu Ch’uan Fa Kung Fu about ten years Kung Fu about ten years ago, when a Shaolin temple was erected here in the ago, when a Shaolin temple was erected here in the city. That value is that of secrecy in which we city. That value is that of secrecy in which we learned the virtues of self-discipline and patience - learned the virtues of self-discipline and patience - the strength to “deny the dragon”, according to the the strength to “deny the dragon”, according to the teachings of my master.teachings of my master.22Secrecy involves the strength to redirect our Secrecy involves the strength to redirect our energy elsewhere in situations that tempt us to boast energy elsewhere in situations that tempt us to boast of our knowledge or skill. The function of secrecy of our knowledge or skill. The function of secrecy is not immediately obvious until it is put into is not immediately obvious until it is put into practice. In the case of aggression the dragon, if practice. In the case of aggression the dragon, if allowed to exist, is anger. Evidence which allowed to exist, is anger. Evidence which demonstrates how aggression leads to the demonstrates how aggression leads to the continuation of aggression in other people is given continuation of aggression in other people is given by the example of punishment. A treatise on the by the example of punishment. A treatise on the effect of punishment is as follows:effect of punishment is as follows:Not only does punishment show that Not only does punishment show that others may hurt one, it also teaches that one others may hurt one, it also teaches that one way in which people deal with one another is by way in which people deal with one another is by causing injury or distress. And it teaches the causing injury or distress. And it teaches the value of the power to do so.value of the power to do so.33Hence the Shaolin warrior, by redirecting his Hence the Shaolin warrior, by redirecting his energy, does not abuse his power to cause injury or energy, does not abuse his power to cause injury or distress, teaching others to do the same. However distress, teaching others to do the same. However nothing can be said for the attacker who chooses to nothing can be said for the attacker who chooses to abuse his power on a Shaolin warrior. Here the abuse his power on a Shaolin warrior. Here the Shaolin warrior will demonstrate the futility of Shaolin warrior will demonstrate the futility of aggression by using the energy his attacker gives aggression by using the energy his attacker gives freely.freely.44An attacker intent on learning to improve his An attacker intent on learning to improve his skill however may attack again, just to learn from the skill however may attack again, just to learn from the Shaolin warrior what he knows. The Shaolin warrior Shaolin warrior what he knows. The Shaolin warrior is aware of this and therefore uses only the is aware of this and therefore uses only the minimum amount of skill required to put an end to minimum amount of skill required to put an end to the matter.the matter.Although the aggressor may go elsewhere to Although the aggressor may go elsewhere to learn new skills, one thing is clear: He knows the learn new skills, one thing is clear: He knows the price he must pay for his aggression should he price he must pay for his aggression should he encounter an individual who has control of the encounter an individual who has control of the power he is abusing. Secrecy means that the power he is abusing. Secrecy means that the aggressor doesn’t know who has this power or to aggressor doesn’t know who has this power or to what degree this power has been cultivated.what degree this power has been cultivated.But secrecy has no value in our present state of But secrecy has no value in our present state of affairs if the chances of encountering a Shaolin affairs if the chances of encountering a Shaolin warrior or any other martial artist are minute. The warrior or any other martial artist are minute. The advocates of stiffer penalties or more severe advocates of stiffer penalties or more severe punishment overlook one thing. They themselves do punishment overlook one thing. They themselves do not possess the amount of power the aggressors not possess the amount of power the aggressors abuse, and therefore can only act upon the attacker abuse, and therefore can only act upon the attacker indirectly and after the fact.indirectly and after the fact.Secrecy in the martial arts has the most effect Secrecy in the martial arts has the most effect when the number of martial artists increases to when the number of martial artists increases to where an aggressor will believe it is inevitable he where an aggressor will believe it is inevitable he will be damaged rather than his victim. This is the will be damaged rather than his victim. This is the value of the martial arts - that the belief an aggressor value of the martial arts - that the belief an aggressor has that he may encounter a Shaolin warrior or a has that he may encounter a Shaolin warrior or a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"martial artist of another style will inhibit his actions.martial artist of another style will inhibit his actions.The oath of secrecy ensures the Shaolin warrior The oath of secrecy ensures the Shaolin warrior himself does not become the enemy.

And if we presume that aggression is they punish. And if we presume that aggression is some sort of “instinct” or “innate drive”, then it some sort of “instinct” or “innate drive”, then it should be more the reason for advocating the use of should be more the reason for advocating the use of training in the martial arts which can control these training in the martial arts which can control these “forces” rather than to use punishment without “forces” rather than to use punishment without understanding its effect.
