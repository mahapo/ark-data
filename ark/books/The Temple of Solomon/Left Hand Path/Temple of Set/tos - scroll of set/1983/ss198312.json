It seems just finished their celebration of Easter. It seems appropriate to reprint the article at the beginning of appropriate to reprint the article at the beginning of the Christian cycle.the Christian cycle.Osiris is a nocturnal Sun-god, a god of the Osiris is a nocturnal Sun-god, a god of the chaos of night, and his original birth as the light of chaos of night, and his original birth as the light of Ra was symbolic to the Egyptians as the origin of Ra was symbolic to the Egyptians as the origin of all humanity.

Thus, we have so far the sunset it is Atum or Tum. Thus, we have so far the child-Sun, Horus, the adult Sun at noon as Ra, a child-Sun, Horus, the adult Sun at noon as Ra, a dying Sun as Atum, and a dead Sun as Osiris. The dying Sun as Atum, and a dead Sun as Osiris. The Sun at night fought Apep and his fiends (symbols Sun at night fought Apep and his fiends (symbols of darkness) and overthrew them. The sequence was of darkness) and overthrew them. The sequence was repeated daily, with Osiris always the victor, and at repeated daily, with Osiris always the victor, and at dawn the Sun was resurrected as Xepera. One might dawn the Sun was resurrected as Xepera. One might note that Xepera is one of the nine gods who note that Xepera is one of the nine gods who destroy damned souls, and Atum is damned! The destroy damned souls, and Atum is damned! The cycle so far is:cycle so far is:• Dawn = Horus/nativity.• Dawn = Horus/nativity.• Noon = Ra/adulthood.• Noon = Ra/adulthood.• Evening = Atum/death.• Evening = Atum/death.• Midnight = Osiris/tomb.• Midnight = Osiris/tomb.• Next Dawn = Xepera/resurrection.• Next Dawn = Xepera/resurrection.Because the entire mythology of these gods is Because the entire mythology of these gods is connected with the Sun, we might expect to find connected with the Sun, we might expect to find stars involved, and we do. There are four principal stars involved, and we do. There are four principal goddesses, all of wham at one time seem to have goddesses, all of wham at one time seem to have been forms of Isis connected with the solar legend:been forms of Isis connected with the solar legend:• Selket (Antares) announced the autumn • Selket (Antares) announced the autumn equinox ca. 5000 BCE.equinox ca. 5000 BCE.• Nepthys (Vega setting at the winter • Nepthys (Vega setting at the winter solstice, as well as all stars when they rose or solstice, as well as all stars when they rose or set, and sunset itself).set, and sunset itself).• Nuit (Alcyone in the Pleiades) announced • Nuit (Alcyone in the Pleiades) announced the vernal equinox ca. 500 CE.the vernal equinox ca. 500 CE.• Isis (Sirius rising) announced the summer • Isis (Sirius rising) announced the summer solstice and the Nile flood, the life-giver of solstice and the Nile flood, the life-giver of Egypt.Egypt.Along with these there are goddesses of the four Along with these there are goddesses of the four cardinal points.

The god Thoth annunciation at the vernal equinox. The god Thoth appeared to Isis to announce the forthcoming birth appeared to Isis to announce the forthcoming birth of Horus, and we find a hymn to Nuit, the Isis of the of Horus, and we find a hymn to Nuit, the Isis of the vernal equinox, in vernal equinox, in Gods of the EgyptiansGods of the Egyptians, Volume I, , Volume I, page #459:page #459:Hail, great star, thy birth has not been Hail, great star, thy birth has not been accomplished.

Uatchet her to bring forth her firstborn son, Horus. Uatchet (the “Elizabeth” of this story) was with her and (the “Elizabeth” of this story) was with her and helped her.

One word for she was called the “lady of life”. One word for “life” has a star-symbol as a determinative, and “life” has a star-symbol as a determinative, and Bast could also be called the “lady of the star”. Bast could also be called the “lady of the star”. Mary is “Stella Maris” (star of the sea). As Ra-t, Mary is “Stella Maris” (star of the sea). As Ra-t, Bast is the wife of Ra.Bast is the wife of Ra.In Christianity it is John the Baptist who is born In Christianity it is John the Baptist who is born at midsummer, June 25th. In Egypt stars were at midsummer, June 25th. In Egypt stars were seldom gods, but heliacal rising of Sahu/Orion seldom gods, but heliacal rising of Sahu/Orion occurs just before that of Isis/Sirius near the occurs just before that of Isis/Sirius near the summer solstice. Orion was one asterism a pharaoh summer solstice.

Isis is the prototype of nursing as a mother would. Isis is the prototype of the Christian Mary, mother of “God”. And Sirius - the Christian Mary, mother of “God”.
