So the Force discretion, a dematerialized form. So the Force appears to hold properties long associated with the appears to hold properties long associated with the Philosopher’s Stone. To Setians this should serve Philosopher’s Stone. To Setians this should serve as an example of alXemy and of part of the Great as an example of alXemy and of part of the Great Work that is yet to be. However, not to jump the Work that is yet to be. However, not to jump the gun, we must first actualize that which we are to gun, we must first actualize that which we are to transmute. Furthermore there are at least two transmute.

It implied, and rightly so, freedom of choice change. It implied, and rightly so, freedom of choice as wrought by the individual will. The proof of as wrought by the individual will. The proof of initiation was, for the Jedi, that they did not know initiation was, for the Jedi, that they did not know what a particular element or person was about to do what a particular element or person was about to do next. That would have meant that some sort of next. That would have meant that some sort of predestination existed, and that their efforts to predestination existed, and that their efforts to exercise will would have been based on a higher exercise will would have been based on a higher instinct that allowed them simply to sense what was instinct that allowed them simply to sense what was “coming next” in the predetermined future.“coming next” in the predetermined future.As far as Setians are concerned, the above is no As far as Setians are concerned, the above is no less true.
