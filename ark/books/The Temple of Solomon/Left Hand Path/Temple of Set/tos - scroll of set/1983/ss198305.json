By this Nietzsche meant that men endeavors to make this Nietzsche meant that men endeavors to make sense of the predicament of his existence, to give sense of the predicament of his existence, to give himself purpose, by creating a framework of truth himself purpose, by creating a framework of truth within which to move. Such frameworks, if within which to move. Such frameworks, if sufficiently sophisticated and not deliberately sufficiently sophisticated and not deliberately fraudulent, are called “philosophies”. Successive fraudulent, are called “philosophies”. Successive horizons are constructed by theorists who are under horizons are constructed by theorists who are under the impression that they are discovering truth; the impression that they are discovering truth; actually they are creating a new horizon - a more actually they are creating a new horizon - a more comprehensive philosophy which seems to remedy comprehensive philosophy which seems to remedy the defects of its predecessors.

How ironic - and how true! The others. How ironic - and how true! The philosophical depth of the Temple of Set is far philosophical depth of the Temple of Set is far beyond that of history’s many great systems of beyond that of history’s many great systems of thought- [I might note here that in my Ph.D. thought- [I might note here that in my Ph.D. capacity I teach collegiate political philosophy, capacity I teach collegiate political philosophy, hence work extensively with said systems.] Yet it hence work extensively with said systems.] Yet it has been very difficult for us to appreciate the has been very difficult for us to appreciate the essence of what we have discovered. Like Parsifal in essence of what we have discovered. Like Parsifal in the Hall of the Grail, we shake our heads in the Hall of the Grail, we shake our heads in ignorance and confusion over the marvelous vision ignorance and confusion over the marvelous vision before us. And, like Parsifal, we have since spent before us. And, like Parsifal, we have since spent years blundering about in the wilderness, suffering years blundering about in the wilderness, suffering distractions and injuries, yet always trying to distractions and injuries, yet always trying to understand that vision.understand that vision.Our most recent adventure - the Our most recent adventure - the Xem/ Per-tXem/ Per-t episode - led us towards a poetic, artistic mysticism episode - led us towards a poetic, artistic mysticism so divorced from rationality that it bordered on so divorced from rationality that it bordered on sheer fantasy and ultimately excused almost any sheer fantasy and ultimately excused almost any organizational policy, no matter how repressive and organizational policy, no matter how repressive and absurd, which served to reinforce that fantasy. The absurd, which served to reinforce that fantasy. The great mystical movements of history, like the great great mystical movements of history, like the great philosophical schools, have had a powerful appeal. philosophical schools, have had a powerful appeal. While philosophy appeals to our hunger for rational While philosophy appeals to our hunger for rational understanding, mysticism comforts us in our understanding, mysticism comforts us in our frustration at never attaining that understanding. We frustration at never attaining that understanding. We want desperately to be certain of want desperately to be certain of somethingsomething. If we . If we resign ourselves to ignorance, we at least want to resign ourselves to ignorance, we at least want to believe that our particular mystical guru believe that our particular mystical guru isis certain, certain, that that hehe understands, that we will arrive in port as understands, that we will arrive in port as long as he captains the ship.long as he captains the ship.The The Xem/Per-tXem/Per-t error was not that mysticism was error was not that mysticism was admitted to play a part in the Æon of Set. Mysticism admitted to play a part in the Æon of Set. Mysticism is as necessary to Black Magic as rational thought, is as necessary to Black Magic as rational thought, since it is our capability for supra-rational mental since it is our capability for supra-rational mental activity which enables us to conceptualize creatively activity which enables us to conceptualize creatively and to pursue operations of Greater Black Magic as and to pursue operations of Greater Black Magic as discussed in the discussed in the Crystal TabletCrystal Tablet..But mysticism, to be helpful to the coherence of But mysticism, to be helpful to the coherence of the mind, must rest upon a solid foundation of the mind, must rest upon a solid foundation of rationality - What Plato termed “nœtic rationality - What Plato termed “nœtic apprehension”. His mystical jump towards the apprehension”. His mystical jump towards the supra-rational Forms was possible only supra-rational Forms was possible only afterafter the the philosopher had first attained the most rigorous philosopher had first attained the most rigorous precision in his rational thought processes. This is precision in his rational thought processes. This is the underlying massage of the Platonic Dialogues. the underlying massage of the Platonic Dialogues. The The Xem/Per-tXem/Per-t error was that this rational error was that this rational prerequisite was ignored; hence prerequisite was ignored; hence XemXem and and Per-tPer-t became incoherent, insubstantial, subjective became incoherent, insubstantial, subjective fantasies.fantasies.XeperXeper has never suffered from mystical has never suffered from mystical distortion, because it is an attitude towards evolution, distortion, because it is an attitude towards evolution, not something which can be idolized or even not something which can be idolized or even conceptualized in itself. You cannot claim to “be” conceptualized in itself. You cannot claim to “be” it, or possess it, or to control it. Its only actualization it, or possess it, or to control it. Its only actualization is through one’s active, deliberate is through one’s active, deliberate experienceexperience of it. of it.This is perhaps why my own task as a Magus This is perhaps why my own task as a Magus has always been less self-centered than those of an has always been less self-centered than those of an Aleister Crowley or an Anton LaVey. There is no Aleister Crowley or an Anton LaVey. There is no necessity for me to portray a personalized ideal necessity for me to portray a personalized ideal towards which disciples ought to aspire. Nietzsche towards which disciples ought to aspire. Nietzsche proposed no “standardized” superman; he stressed proposed no “standardized” superman; he stressed that the metamorphosis was both possible and that the metamorphosis was both possible and desirable, yet must be exclusively individualistic.desirable, yet must be exclusively individualistic.Therefore the Temple of Set’s original policy - Therefore the Temple of Set’s original policy - now reaffirmed and reemphasized in the now reaffirmed and reemphasized in the Crystal Crystal TabletTablet - of expecting each Setian to assume - of expecting each Setian to assume personal responsibility for both the rational and the personal responsibility for both the rational and the supra-rational requirements of his initiation, remains supra-rational requirements of his initiation, remains valid. It is, as Nietzsche might say, a horizon which valid. It is, as Nietzsche might say, a horizon which has continued to stand the test of time without has continued to stand the test of time without revealing inaccuracies or errors. This, I may add, revealing inaccuracies or errors. This, I may add, lends support to the validity of lends support to the validity of XeperXeper as deserving as deserving the dignity of a Word of a Magus.the dignity of a Word of a Magus.The continuing dilemma of the Temple, of The continuing dilemma of the Temple, of course, is how to maintain an organization which is course, is how to maintain an organization which is sufficiently strong to guard itself against petty sufficiently strong to guard itself against petty personal abuse, yet sufficiently flexible to encourage personal abuse, yet sufficiently flexible to encourage constructive, creative individualism in Lesser and constructive, creative individualism in Lesser and Greater Black Magic.

Our most important only part of the solution. Our most important resource will always be our clear appreciation of the resource will always be our clear appreciation of the dilemma and a sincere, enlightened attitude towards dilemma and a sincere, enlightened attitude towards incidents arising from it.

But Nietzsche went on to say that we need not But Nietzsche went on to say that we need not regard these desires and passions as sinful or regard these desires and passions as sinful or crippling; we need only to resolve to become their crippling; we need only to resolve to become their master rather that their slave.
