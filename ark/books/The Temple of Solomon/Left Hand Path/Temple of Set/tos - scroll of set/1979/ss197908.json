Hail Set, Prince of Darkness!Darkness!______________________________________________________________________[19] [19] The First Foundation - AgainThe First Foundation - Again- by L. Dale Seago IV°, Director- by L. Dale Seago IV°, DirectorAs those of you familiar with the Temple As those of you familiar with the Temple reading list should be aware, Isaac Asimov’s reading list should be aware, Isaac Asimov’s concept of the First Foundation in his concept of the First Foundation in his FoundationFoundation trilogy was that of a group of research scientists trilogy was that of a group of research scientists (psychohistorians) who were to develop an (psychohistorians) who were to develop an Encyclopædia GalacticaEncyclopædia Galactica in which the accumulated in which the accumulated knowledge of the human race would be stored in knowledge of the human race would be stored in order to facilitate man’s rise from barbarism order to facilitate man’s rise from barbarism following the inevitable collapse of the Galactic following the inevitable collapse of the Galactic Empire. Its role was actually a good deal more Empire. Its role was actually a good deal more complex than that, and the First Foundation found it complex than that, and the First Foundation found it necessary to configure itself in a number of necessary to configure itself in a number of different ways at different time periods as the different ways at different time periods as the Temple of Set may conceivably find it necessary to Temple of Set may conceivably find it necessary to do.do.In reference to our First Foundation (1F), the In reference to our First Foundation (1F), the Temple’s second-stage informational document Temple’s second-stage informational document states:states:As was noted earlier, one of the key As was noted earlier, one of the key interests of the Temple is futures research the interests of the Temple is futures research the systematic estimation of future social, scientific, systematic estimation of future social, scientific, and environmental conditions and the and environmental conditions and the formulation of contingency plans for the formulation of contingency plans for the Temple and its Initiates in a variety of possible Temple and its Initiates in a variety of possible situations.situations.In short, the efforts of 1F are being directed In short, the efforts of 1F are being directed toward the solution of the First Problem of this toward the solution of the First Problem of this peculiar metapsychological, evolutionary process we peculiar metapsychological, evolutionary process we refer to as “Setamorphosis” - the First Problem refer to as “Setamorphosis” - the First Problem being that of surviving long enough to address the being that of surviving long enough to address the Second Problem. To accomplish this we must be Second Problem. To accomplish this we must be able to formulate a reasonably accurate picture of able to formulate a reasonably accurate picture of the future so we can prepare to address certain kinds the future so we can prepare to address certain kinds of problems We may encounter.of problems We may encounter.Futures research nowadays has progressed Futures research nowadays has progressed somewhat beyond the crystal-ball stage. We can’t somewhat beyond the crystal-ball stage. We can’t really tell what is going to happen precisely next really tell what is going to happen precisely next week or next year, but we can get a pretty good idea week or next year, but we can get a pretty good idea of general trends and the probable occurrence of of general trends and the probable occurrence of certain kinds of activities by monitoring some of the certain kinds of activities by monitoring some of the major factors which make up the future. The most major factors which make up the future. The most important for our purposes are the following:important for our purposes are the following:I. Energy and Resource Development and I. Energy and Resource Development and AllocationAllocationMost of you are probably becoming aware of Most of you are probably becoming aware of this one, if only through gasoline lines and rising this one, if only through gasoline lines and rising utility bills.utility bills.II. EconomicsII. EconomicsThis is largely dependent on the energy and This is largely dependent on the energy and resource situation. Everything is becoming scarcer, resource situation. Everything is becoming scarcer, hence prices are rising. Not only that, but due to hence prices are rising. Not only that, but due to increased energy costs products of all kinds cost increased energy costs products of all kinds cost more to manufacture, and these increased costs are more to manufacture, and these increased costs are also passed onto consumers. Thus we pay more for also passed onto consumers. Thus we pay more for direct consumption of energy, and we pay for direct consumption of energy, and we pay for energy costs “hidden” in manufactured products.energy costs “hidden” in manufactured products.Globally the economic situation is exceedingly Globally the economic situation is exceedingly delicate. Practically every country depends on one delicate. Practically every country depends on one or more other countries for something vital to its or more other countries for something vital to its present mode of existence, and the balance is not present mode of existence, and the balance is not difficult to upset, as we are seeing with the oil difficult to upset, as we are seeing with the oil situation.situation.As another example, there was supposed to be a As another example, there was supposed to be a slight worldwide surplus of wheat this year. But the slight worldwide surplus of wheat this year. But the Russians had problems with their wheat crop, and as Russians had problems with their wheat crop, and as a result there will be a world deficit. This means the a result there will be a world deficit. This means the Soviets will have to buy more wheat, and it means Soviets will have to buy more wheat, and it means that you will be paying higher prices for breads and that you will be paying higher prices for breads and pastries in the supermarket.pastries in the supermarket.III. PoliticsIII. PoliticsIf you have the idea that the economic situation If you have the idea that the economic situation can be controlled politically, forget it. Politics are can be controlled politically, forget it. Politics are controlled by economics, which is a function of controlled by economics, which is a function of availability and allocation of energy and resources. availability and allocation of energy and resources. Politics and economics are two sides of the same Politics and economics are two sides of the same coin.coin.IV. TechnologyIV.

We have the technology, right now, to use atomic and solar technology, right now, to use atomic and solar energy sources, but the cost involved in converting energy sources, but the cost involved in converting to them is staggering not to mention being contrary to them is staggering not to mention being contrary to what powerful international corporations perceive to what powerful international corporations perceive Scroll of SetScroll of Set - August 1979 - Page - August 1979 - Page 88"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"as their own best interests.

There is a great “leveling” effect at work in our society, and it great “leveling” effect at work in our society, and it is becoming recognized that those who have nothing is becoming recognized that those who have nothing possess the “right” to be supported by those who possess the “right” to be supported by those who earn their own incomes.earn their own incomes.These phenomena will most probably lead to a These phenomena will most probably lead to a repressive authoritarian backlash. I’m not talking repressive authoritarian backlash. I’m not talking about totalitarianism - nothing as dramatic as about totalitarianism - nothing as dramatic as Orwell’s 1984. But you can expect to see tighter Orwell’s 1984.
