For that matter I have never had anything like this. For that matter I have never had any adverse reaction of any kind. So I asked myself any adverse reaction of any kind. So I asked myself why. After careful examination I arrived at the why. After careful examination I arrived at the following conclusions:following conclusions:(1) The Setians who seem to be subject to this (1) The Setians who seem to be subject to this phenomena [at least those I have heard of] are those phenomena [at least those I have heard of] are those who have embarked on their magical life during the who have embarked on their magical life during the Age of Satan, or the Set-HarWer period, and have Age of Satan, or the Set-HarWer period, and have had an exposure to HarWer. “But HarWer, My had an exposure to HarWer. “But HarWer, My opposite Self, is a Strange and Fitful presence.” opposite Self, is a Strange and Fitful presence.” Also the Age of Satan, if my understanding is Also the Age of Satan, if my understanding is correct, was the time of a separation between Set and correct, was the time of a separation between Set and HarWer. Such a separation would produce HarWer. Such a separation would produce confusion and, yes, fear - particularly to a person confusion and, yes, fear - particularly to a person who has so much human still a part of him. My who has so much human still a part of him. My magical life, on the other hand, began during the true magical life, on the other hand, began during the true Æon of Set, and I somehow missed this exposure to Æon of Set, and I somehow missed this exposure to and separation from HarWer.and separation from HarWer.(2) I have always known and been aware of Set (2) I have always known and been aware of Set has an honest-to-goodness, real-live being. And so has an honest-to-goodness, real-live being. And so when I read the when I read the Book of Coming Forth by NightBook of Coming Forth by Night, I , I accepted it as the literal word of Set. This being the accepted it as the literal word of Set. This being the case, I take Set at his word. When he tells me to case, I take Set at his word. When he tells me to “come to me as a friend, and I will hear as a “come to me as a friend, and I will hear as a friend”, I approach my magic on this basis. How friend”, I approach my magic on this basis. How can one fear a true friend? And I don’t think Set can one fear a true friend? And I don’t think Set offers his friendship lightly.offers his friendship lightly.(3) I used to worry that I was doing something (3) I used to worry that I was doing something wrong or that there was something wrong with me. wrong or that there was something wrong with me. After analyzing the situation I realize that this is not After analyzing the situation I realize that this is not the case at all. I simply arrived by a different the case at all. I simply arrived by a different approach. I have no spectacular experiences to approach. I have no spectacular experiences to report. I just seem to slide from one stage to the report. I just seem to slide from one stage to the next, and somehow I feel the difference in my state next, and somehow I feel the difference in my state of being. I can’t say that it has been easy. It has of being. I can’t say that it has been easy. It has taken a lot of time, study, hard work, and exercise to taken a lot of time, study, hard work, and exercise to strengthen the will.strengthen the will.(4) When I joined the Temple of Set, I knew (4) When I joined the Temple of Set, I knew exactly what I was doing. Now came the process of exactly what I was doing. Now came the process of learning and education in Magic. I was fortunate in learning and education in Magic. I was fortunate in that I had the that I had the Book of Coming Forth by NightBook of Coming Forth by Night, and it , and it gave me a good foundation on which to build and gave me a good foundation on which to build and learn.learn.Starting to live a completely new and different Starting to live a completely new and different life can cause a lot of fear and anxiety from time to life can cause a lot of fear and anxiety from time to time, not to mention the misunderstandings that can time, not to mention the misunderstandings that can and do occur. I have been more fortunate than many and do occur. I have been more fortunate than many in that I have always had a III° close at hand to help in that I have always had a III° close at hand to help me when I went too far afield. I have come to realize me when I went too far afield. I have come to realize that one does not become truly cognizant of that one does not become truly cognizant of XeperXeper until one reaches the II°. The time before that is a until one reaches the II°. The time before that is a time of preparation and education - a period of time of preparation and education - a period of getting to know oneself. I think this relates directly getting to know oneself. I think this relates directly to the finding of a magical name.to the finding of a magical name.I have always been slow and easy, so things do I have always been slow and easy, so things do not progress for me as quickly as I want them to. not progress for me as quickly as I want them to.
