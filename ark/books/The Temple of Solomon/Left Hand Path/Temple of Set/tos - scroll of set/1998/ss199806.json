The fifth Element, ether, is space, mass, and energy. The fifth Element, ether, is postulated to represent the so-called “shadow time postulated to represent the so-called “shadow time dimension” used to account for the apparent dimension” used to account for the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics.paradoxes of quantum mechanics.Consider the trapezoid with these elements as Consider the trapezoid with these elements as attributes of the four vertices and the fifth element, attributes of the four vertices and the fifth element, ether, as an attribute of the descendant point of an ether, as an attribute of the descendant point of an inscribed pentagram. Peter Carroll describes this inscribed pentagram.

These correspondences, in Chaos Magic. These correspondences, summarized in the table below, are taken from summarized in the table below, are taken from various schools of thought inspired by a single various schools of thought inspired by a single unifying trapezoid principle in Native American unifying trapezoid principle in Native American LHP magic.LHP magic.Unlike systems of correspondences that appear Unlike systems of correspondences that appear in other branches of magic, the correspondences in in other branches of magic, the correspondences in this table should not in any way be considered as set this table should not in any way be considered as set in stone.

In the last episode I shared my general In the last episode I shared my general understanding of understanding of Xem.Xem. Now I want to focus on a Now I want to focus on a specific idea that RKB viewed as pivotal, specific idea that RKB viewed as pivotal, MaatMaat. . MaatMaat is very important to RKB. He even states that is very important to RKB. He even states that XemXem “... is the constant construction of a “... is the constant construction of a metaphysical/magical/philosophical state of being metaphysical/magical/philosophical state of being and state of beings with the principles of and state of beings with the principles of XeperXeper and and MaatMaat as the cornerstones”. as the cornerstones”.In his In his Book of Opening the WayBook of Opening the Way, RKB’s most , RKB’s most detailed elaboration of the detailed elaboration of the MaatMaat neterneter occurs when occurs when he is explaining the symbolism of his Stele of he is explaining the symbolism of his Stele of XemXem::Once entered, the trapezoid becomes a Once entered, the trapezoid becomes a hall through which all aspirants to hall through which all aspirants to XemXem must must pass. This is the hall of judgment, and within it pass. This is the hall of judgment, and within it stands stands MaatMaat, , neterneter of truth and justice. of truth and justice.This particular This particular MaatMaat is the aspirant’s is the aspirant’s individual individual MaatMaat or individual truth, and her or individual truth, and her function is to determine the balance or function is to determine the balance or imbalance of the self who is being led through imbalance of the self who is being led through initiation.initiation.If this If this MaatMaat’s feather is balanced by the ’s feather is balanced by the heart of the aspirant, then the aspirant will heart of the aspirant, then the aspirant will recognize the macrocosmic recognize the macrocosmic MaatMaat, for his own , for his own MaatMaat will reflect her.

He takes an ancient notion of the afterlife and He takes an ancient notion of the afterlife and reshapes it into a vision of the living modern reshapes it into a vision of the living modern magician’s initiatory journey.magician’s initiatory journey.But I would argue that his understanding of But I would argue that his understanding of MaatMaat does not go far enough for those who study does not go far enough for those who study things from the perspective of what we call the Left-things from the perspective of what we call the Left-Hand Path. RKB only partly liberates Hand Path. RKB only partly liberates MaatMaat from from the RHP, Osirian context. He does not fully escape the RHP, Osirian context. He does not fully escape from that idea of a “judgment” which is so from that idea of a “judgment” which is so common in certain traditions.common in certain traditions.Perhaps he did not feel the need, did not see the Perhaps he did not feel the need, did not see the need to cast need to cast MaatMaat in an LHP form. This seems clear in an LHP form. This seems clear because he still speaks of a “macrocosmic because he still speaks of a “macrocosmic MaatMaat” ” that we must “reflect”: a statement that flirts with a that we must “reflect”: a statement that flirts with a surrender of individuality.surrender of individuality.Also take note when RKB says “the self who is Also take note when RKB says “the self who is being led through initiation”. He cannot seem to being led through initiation”. He cannot seem to shake loose from these old ideas of needing a guru, shake loose from these old ideas of needing a guru, of giving up self to some other authority in order to of giving up self to some other authority in order to achieve some sort of enlightenment. Maybe this was achieve some sort of enlightenment. Maybe this was because his personal work revolved around Anubis because his personal work revolved around Anubis as “the escort” to the point where he was distracted as “the escort” to the point where he was distracted from the fact that achieving from the fact that achieving MaatMaat is the key to is the key to XemXem, , even though he clearly knew this.even though he clearly knew this.But this is only a partial failure because he also But this is only a partial failure because he also clearly brings forth the idea of “individual clearly brings forth the idea of “individual MaatMaat”, ”, of “individual truth” and of understanding that of “individual truth” and of understanding that truth. Herein was the key to entering truth. Herein was the key to entering XemXem as an as an equal and not as a servant.equal and not as a servant.To attempt to fully allow To attempt to fully allow MaatMaat to escape the to escape the wrappings of Osiris, we should go back to ancient wrappings of Osiris, we should go back to ancient Khem and find her for ourselves. Who exactly was Khem and find her for ourselves. Who exactly was MaatMaat in ancient Egypt, and more importantly can we in ancient Egypt, and more importantly can we recast her into a modern form? For I will not claim recast her into a modern form? For I will not claim to bring to bring MaatMaat back unchanged. I will instead create back unchanged. I will instead create my own my own MaatMaat, of which this writing is a reflection., of which this writing is a reflection.I will start by questioning the definition of I will start by questioning the definition of MaatMaat as the goddess of truth and justice. It may be as the goddess of truth and justice. It may be misleading, if not exactly untrue.misleading, if not exactly untrue.Let me start by imposing my understanding Let me start by imposing my understanding onto the past by suggesting that the Egyptians onto the past by suggesting that the Egyptians believed that their entire society had actualized believed that their entire society had actualized XemXem, , that their entire culture was a mutually beneficial that their entire culture was a mutually beneficial alliance between humans and alliance between humans and netersneters, that the Two , that the Two Lands were united.Lands were united.Such a frame of mind is almost impossible to Such a frame of mind is almost impossible to comprehend, so alien is it to our modern views. But comprehend, so alien is it to our modern views. But the unity had to be constantly renewed; it was not the unity had to be constantly renewed; it was not just to be taken for granted. Both gods and men had just to be taken for granted. Both gods and men had to actively participate in exchanges of magic, ritual, to actively participate in exchanges of magic, ritual, and power.
