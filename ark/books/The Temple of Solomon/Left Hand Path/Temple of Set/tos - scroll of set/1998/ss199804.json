The primary owed to several ancient manuscripts. The primary source of Sethian thought and practice is the Nag source of Sethian thought and practice is the Nag Hammadi Codex, a collection of original Gnostic Hammadi Codex, a collection of original Gnostic and Coptic manuscripts from Egypt.and Coptic manuscripts from Egypt.The Codex is the source of two precious texts The Codex is the source of two precious texts called “The Second Logos of the Great Seth” and called “The Second Logos of the Great Seth” and “The Three Steles of Seth”, which is the revelation “The Three Steles of Seth”, which is the revelation concerning Seth transmitted to the reader by concerning Seth transmitted to the reader by Dositheus. These three short verses (steles) are Dositheus. These three short verses (steles) are based on material which Dositheus himself claims based on material which Dositheus himself claims to have seen, to have remembered, and then to have to have seen, to have remembered, and then to have shared with a group of people called “the Elect”.shared with a group of people called “the Elect”.Other Gnostic texts identified as specifically Other Gnostic texts identified as specifically Sethian documents are the “Apocalypse of Adam”, Sethian documents are the “Apocalypse of Adam”, “The Gospel of the Egyptians”, “Zostrianos”, “The Gospel of the Egyptians”, “Zostrianos”, “Allogenes”, “Marsanes”, and the “Untitled “Allogenes”, “Marsanes”, and the “Untitled Text” from the Bruce Codex.Text” from the Bruce Codex.A document from antiquity which sheds light on A document from antiquity which sheds light on Sethian magic is the “Stele of Jeu the Sethian magic is the “Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist” (PGM V.96-172), which has been Hieroglyphist” (PGM V.96-172), which has been studied and commented on by Magus Flowers in studied and commented on by Magus Flowers in Hermetic MagicHermetic Magic and Magus Webb in and Magus Webb in Seven Faces Seven Faces of Darknessof Darkness. This stele is important because of the .

While his work does not present a complete day.

This means there exists a spirit world and a material This means there exists a spirit world and a material world.world.The spirit world was the creation of a pre-The spirit world was the creation of a pre-existent power from whom all creation has its origin, existent power from whom all creation has its origin, including all spiritual and celestial powers who including all spiritual and celestial powers who could be interpreted as divinities or angels.could be interpreted as divinities or angels.The material world was the creation of the The material world was the creation of the Demiurge (Greek: “craftsman”), who was also Demiurge (Greek: “craftsman”), who was also known as Sabaoth, Iapas, Ialdabaoth, and several known as Sabaoth, Iapas, Ialdabaoth, and several other names through the Græco-Egyptian magical other names through the Græco-Egyptian magical papyri. He was a created being, and he is best papyri. He was a created being, and he is best identified with the Jewish deity of Old Testament identified with the Jewish deity of Old Testament (Iao), and was understood by all Gnostic sects as a (Iao), and was understood by all Gnostic sects as a malicious being.malicious being.The Demiurge sought to create a world of its The Demiurge sought to create a world of its own where it might be worshipped by a subservient own where it might be worshipped by a subservient race, and so it brought into being the material race, and so it brought into being the material universe as we know it. It created the planets, suns, universe as we know it. It created the planets, suns, and the Earth. It then created a series of Archons and the Earth. It then created a series of Archons (Greek: “rulers”), which the Demiurge set to (Greek: “rulers”), which the Demiurge set to governing various aspects of the created material governing various aspects of the created material world.world.If we imagine the material world in the form of If we imagine the material world in the form of an onion, with the earth as the center and each planet an onion, with the earth as the center and each planet corresponding to an outer layer, then we have a corresponding to an outer layer, then we have a decent image of the cosmological plan that the decent image of the cosmological plan that the Gnostics themselves used.Gnostics themselves used.The human was a product of both worlds, since The human was a product of both worlds, since each human was a material body with a spiritual each human was a material body with a spiritual component to the soul. After death this spiritual component to the soul. After death this spiritual component would attempt to flee the Earth and component would attempt to flee the Earth and ascend to the stars, but in doing so it would be ascend to the stars, but in doing so it would be opposed by the Archons, who would hurtle it back opposed by the Archons, who would hurtle it back down to Earth to be reincarnated.down to Earth to be reincarnated.The Gnostics believed that these spiritual The Gnostics believed that these spiritual barriers could be overcome if one could gain access barriers could be overcome if one could gain access to secret knowledge (to secret knowledge (gnosisgnosis).

What set the Gnostics apart from the Christian What set the Gnostics apart from the Christian groups was the emphasis on personal experience groups was the emphasis on personal experience with the divine instead of salvation through with the divine instead of salvation through obedience. The spiritual development of each obedience. The spiritual development of each Gnostic was a pilgrimage that called each initiate to Gnostic was a pilgrimage that called each initiate to focus on the divinity within.focus on the divinity within.The Sethian Gnostics were a unique group for The Sethian Gnostics were a unique group for several reasons, and primary reason for this several reasons, and primary reason for this uniqueness stems from the being of whom uniqueness stems from the being of whom Dositheus claimed instruction: this figure was the Dositheus claimed instruction: this figure was the celestial power known as Seth.celestial power known as Seth.An interesting observation is found in An interesting observation is found in Dositheus’ name: it is Greek for “gift (Dositheus’ name: it is Greek for “gift (dosidosi) of the ) of the god (god (theostheos)”, and the spelling of the name implies )”, and the spelling of the name implies that the god is Seth, who hails from “Setheus”, that the god is Seth, who hails from “Setheus”, understood as a secret celestial realm.understood as a secret celestial realm.Most Gnostics were familiar with Typhon, but Most Gnostics were familiar with Typhon, but he is always understood to be the ass-headed Iao, he is always understood to be the ass-headed Iao, the Jewish deity who is the Demiurge. So why did the Jewish deity who is the Demiurge. So why did the Sethians see him as a positive figure?the Sethians see him as a positive figure?This can appear confusing at first until you This can appear confusing at first until you recall that Sethians began as Samaritans who recall that Sethians began as Samaritans who adopted the Gnostic cosmology under Dositheus’ adopted the Gnostic cosmology under Dositheus’ leadership. The Sethians associated Set-Typhon leadership. The Sethians associated Set-Typhon with both Seth and Iao. Previous to adopting the with both Seth and Iao. Previous to adopting the Gnostic cosmology, the Samaritans were a Gnostic cosmology, the Samaritans were a messianic Judaic group who worshipped Iao.messianic Judaic group who worshipped Iao.All Gnostic groups identify ass-headed Iao All Gnostic groups identify ass-headed Iao together with the Demiurge and Seth-Typhon. What together with the Demiurge and Seth-Typhon. What made the Sethians unique is that, when they were made the Sethians unique is that, when they were confronted with a system (Gnosticism) that was confronted with a system (Gnosticism) that was hostile to their deity Iao (Set), they allowed him to hostile to their deity Iao (Set), they allowed him to take the outward form of a “negative” power. They take the outward form of a “negative” power. They shifted Iao-Set into the role of the savior “Seth” or shifted Iao-Set into the role of the savior “Seth” or “Aberamentho”, who is separate from Iao but who “Aberamentho”, who is separate from Iao but who still resembles his image (an ass-headed figure).still resembles his image (an ass-headed figure).The Sethians still invoked Iao the Demiurge for The Sethians still invoked Iao the Demiurge for magical purposes. The best example is the Rite of magical purposes. The best example is the Rite of the Headless One, which employs the original the Headless One, which employs the original Samaritan pre-Gnostic concepts of Iao (Set) as a Samaritan pre-Gnostic concepts of Iao (Set) as a positive figure.positive figure.If this type of duality seems confusing, bear in If this type of duality seems confusing, bear in mind that many cultures in this era split a mind that many cultures in this era split a neterneter into into three separate persons to explain separate functions three separate persons to explain separate functions - the Trinity or the Maid/Mother/Crone are both - the Trinity or the Maid/Mother/Crone are both examples.examples.Several observations can be made regarding Several observations can be made regarding Seth:Seth:Seth as a Historical/Celestial PowerSeth as a Historical/Celestial PowerSeth was known to the Judaic and Samaritan Seth was known to the Judaic and Samaritan communities as an early figure from the communities as an early figure from the TorahTorah.
