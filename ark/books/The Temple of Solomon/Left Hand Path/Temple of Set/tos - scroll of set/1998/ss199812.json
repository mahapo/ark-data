Often we may decisions and taking many actions. Often we may start out thinking we wish to do one thing and then start out thinking we wish to do one thing and then moments or hours later find that we’ve changed our moments or hours later find that we’ve changed our mind or someone or something has helped us to mind or someone or something has helped us to change our mind. This is caused by a fragmented change our mind.

Each “I” has its own plan and is many “I”s. Each “I” has its own plan and is connected to one or more of the functions. These connected to one or more of the functions. These functions are as follows:functions are as follows:1. The Emotional Function1. The Emotional Function: This is what we : This is what we call our feelings.

Imagination is also connected to the realm of the Imagination is also connected to the realm of the intellectual function.intellectual function.Ouspensky considers imagination to be a very Ouspensky considers imagination to be a very negative thing. This can be true in many cases, but negative thing. This can be true in many cases, but imagination can be used in very beneficial ways that imagination can be used in very beneficial ways that will be discussed later.will be discussed later.The negative use of imagining is as Ouspensky The negative use of imagining is as Ouspensky states: “One does not take it (imagining) as self states: “One does not take it (imagining) as self deception. One imagines something, believes it, and deception. One imagines something, believes it, and forgets it was imagination.”forgets it was imagination.”Robert Wilson makes some useful distinctions Robert Wilson makes some useful distinctions which are somewhat the same as Ouspensky’s. which are somewhat the same as Ouspensky’s.

Wilson calls them crystallization” moments. Wilson calls them “imprint vulnerability”. With less jargon it means “imprint vulnerability”.

Learning4. Learning: This is pretty much the same as : This is pretty much the same as the intellectual function of Ouspensky. The only the intellectual function of Ouspensky. The only distinction would be that it would be related to the distinction would be that it would be related to the three things listed above.three things listed above.Somewhere in the mess of all these functions Somewhere in the mess of all these functions and various combinations of these functions that and various combinations of these functions that make up the person we call “I”, can be found the make up the person we call “I”, can be found the true self.true self.One way to recognize the true self is to One way to recognize the true self is to recognize the things it is not. The true self is not recognize the things it is not. The true self is not required to react to any of the functions. It does, required to react to any of the functions. It does, however, take the intellectual function to recognize however, take the intellectual function to recognize and put a form to the true self.and put a form to the true self.For continuation of life on this planet the self For continuation of life on this planet the self doesn’t usually decide to just not react to the doesn’t usually decide to just not react to the instinctive functions. There are cases where people instinctive functions. There are cases where people have just willed to die. There are also cases when have just willed to die. There are also cases when not reacting to the instinctive functions can be not reacting to the instinctive functions can be helpful as in controlling the tendency to helpful as in controlling the tendency to automatically step back from a blow and things of automatically step back from a blow and things of that nature which are practiced in the martial arts.that nature which are practiced in the martial arts.If the true self can be found and used by a If the true self can be found and used by a person to control all other functions, a person can be person to control all other functions, a person can be said to be said to be awakeawake. “Sleep” is defined by . “Sleep” is defined by Ouspensky as “the absence of unity or of a Ouspensky as “the absence of unity or of a controlling ‘I’”.controlling ‘I’”.Sleep creates a condition know as Sleep creates a condition know as “mechanicalness”, wherein a person is not actually “mechanicalness”, wherein a person is not actually acting but only reacting to events and situations in acting but only reacting to events and situations in an uncontrolled manner.an uncontrolled manner.The illusion of being in control is very great and The illusion of being in control is very great and hard for most to see as an illusion.hard for most to see as an illusion.Another important definition to be made is that Another important definition to be made is that of being of being awareaware. Being aware must preclude being . Being aware must preclude being awake. Noticing the functions and separating them awake. Noticing the functions and separating them from the true self is being aware.from the true self is being aware.Noticing how others (and sometimes even Noticing how others (and sometimes even yourself) are asleep is being aware. The more one yourself) are asleep is being aware. The more one can be aware, the better the chances for reaching the can be aware, the better the chances for reaching the state known as state known as awakenedawakened. It is through the . It is through the awakened state that we can actually put our will into awakened state that we can actually put our will into effect and further evolve the self. This is effect and further evolve the self. This is XeperXeper..The First Tool: AwarenessThe First Tool: AwarenessThe beginning tool for The beginning tool for XeperXeper is the tool of being is the tool of being aware. This requires no special preparation except aware. This requires no special preparation except the desire to become aware and the understanding the desire to become aware and the understanding that you may not already be aware.that you may not already be aware.Simply begin to notice each function as it comes Simply begin to notice each function as it comes up in your daily life. Try to leave the analyzing for up in your daily life. Try to leave the analyzing for later unless it is an easy analysis that will work with later unless it is an easy analysis that will work with whatever you are doing at the moment.whatever you are doing at the moment.It is very hard to analyze in the middle of an It is very hard to analyze in the middle of an emotional event. Sometimes it’s enough to just emotional event. Sometimes it’s enough to just know that it is a function responding, and not the know that it is a function responding, and not the true self, and get to the analyzing later.true self, and get to the analyzing later.I save the analysis for an end-of-the-day I save the analysis for an end-of-the-day meditation, and during a morning meditation make a meditation, and during a morning meditation make a sort of commitment to be as aware as possible all sort of commitment to be as aware as possible all day.day.It is amazing what just noticing the functions in It is amazing what just noticing the functions in yourself and other people can do. Noticing the yourself and other people can do. Noticing the functions in yourself can alert you to where you functions in yourself can alert you to where you have things that have gone wrong.have things that have gone wrong.These things we can chalk up to natural These things we can chalk up to natural “imprints”, faulty conditioning, and faulty learning. “imprints”, faulty conditioning, and faulty learning. As soon as they can be recognized for wrong As soon as they can be recognized for wrong functioning (or as a faulty learning), they can be functioning (or as a faulty learning), they can be changed.changed.Soon you will begin making decisions based Soon you will begin making decisions based from this awareness, and that will lead to moments from this awareness, and that will lead to moments of being fully awake.of being fully awake.The more you can separate the true self from the The more you can separate the true self from the functions, the more you will see ways to functions, the more you will see ways to XeperXeper..When you notice other people in this awake and When you notice other people in this awake and aware state, you will see how controlled they are by aware state, you will see how controlled they are by their environment and surroundings and really every their environment and surroundings and really every little thing that comes their way. They act very little thing that comes their way. They act very “natural”: blown about no differently than a leaf in “natural”: blown about no differently than a leaf in the wind or swept along with whatever direction the the wind or swept along with whatever direction the currant is flowing. People in this natural state think currant is flowing. People in this natural state think they are actually doing and controlling themselves, they are actually doing and controlling themselves, but in truth it is all being done to them, and they are but in truth it is all being done to them, and they are completely out of control.completely out of control.To evolve, to To evolve, to XeperXeper, the Setian uses a state of , the Setian uses a state of non-natural awareness instead of the natural sleep non-natural awareness instead of the natural sleep common to the mass of humanity. This non-natural common to the mass of humanity. This non-natural awareness is one way of perceiving isolate awareness is one way of perceiving isolate intelligence.intelligence.The Second Tool: Conscious VisualizationThe Second Tool: Conscious Visualization“Conscious visualization” is one term I use to “Conscious visualization” is one term I use to describe beneficial imagining.

For that reason and for brevity’s sake, twenty pages. For that reason and for brevity’s sake, I am only going to focus on the basic I am only going to focus on the basic underpinnings, primarily the ones pertinent to the underpinnings, primarily the ones pertinent to the Left-Hand Path.Left-Hand Path.First I should give some background First I should give some background information.information.The first part of the The first part of the Ruby Tablet of SetRuby Tablet of Set contains contains a synopsis of many modes of philosophical thought a synopsis of many modes of philosophical thought ranging from ancient Egypt to the mid-19th century.ranging from ancient Egypt to the mid-19th century.In looking over this section, an interesting thread In looking over this section, an interesting thread is seen in an overview of these. They deal with the is seen in an overview of these. They deal with the nature of man in socio-political terms.nature of man in socio-political terms.Looking at philosophies dealing with the duties Looking at philosophies dealing with the duties of man (such as with John Locke and Karl Marx), of man (such as with John Locke and Karl Marx), the ethical mores of man (such as with David Hume the ethical mores of man (such as with David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau), and even in relation to and Jean-Jacques Rousseau), and even in relation to the cosmos (such as with the Mesopotamians), all of the cosmos (such as with the Mesopotamians), all of these were reflected in terms of man’s relation and these were reflected in terms of man’s relation and status with his fellows, but not in terms of man’s status with his fellows, but not in terms of man’s inherent individuality. inherent individuality. However, towards the latter part of the 19th However, towards the latter part of the 19th Century, a shift - one noted in the works of people Century, a shift - one noted in the works of people like Henri Bergson and Charles Sanders Pierce - like Henri Bergson and Charles Sanders Pierce - occurred that emphasized the principles of creativity occurred that emphasized the principles of creativity and change that existed in the self rather than the and change that existed in the self rather than the absolute in which man existed. It is out of this shift absolute in which man existed. It is out of this shift that Process Philosophy was born.that Process Philosophy was born.The basic differentiations between Process The basic differentiations between Process Philosophy and its predecessor philosophies can be Philosophy and its predecessor philosophies can be broken down into becoming and being respectively. broken down into becoming and being respectively. For the sake of a brief but substantial explanation in For the sake of a brief but substantial explanation in the face of a vast amount of information regarding the face of a vast amount of information regarding both sides, I’m breaking this presentation down into both sides, I’m breaking this presentation down into three sections:three sections:I. Becoming vs. beingI. Becoming vs. beingII. Becoming in relation to beingII. Becoming in relation to beingIII. Process Philosophy and the Left-Hand PathIII. Process Philosophy and the Left-Hand PathIn looking at the difference between becoming In looking at the difference between becoming and being, the split is better seen in reference to and being, the split is better seen in reference to transition vs. the absolute. Within a transition transition vs. the absolute. Within a transition perspective, the universe is seen as creative and perspective, the universe is seen as creative and organic in nature. Within this standpoint, reality organic in nature. Within this standpoint, reality consists of unit-events.consists of unit-events.By this I mean that contingent and changing By this I mean that contingent and changing experiences and events are the core units of experiences and events are the core units of measurement for reality, which then manifests measurement for reality, which then manifests further by the combination, recombination, and further by the combination, recombination, and manifestation of said experiences and events.manifestation of said experiences and events.From an absolute viewpoint, reality is measured From an absolute viewpoint, reality is measured in terms of being, wherein change is treated either as in terms of being, wherein change is treated either as an illusion or as the exchange or substitution of one an illusion or as the exchange or substitution of one set of qualities for another in an abiding substratum. set of qualities for another in an abiding substratum. Even then, change is considered intrinsically Even then, change is considered intrinsically negative or inferior.negative or inferior.Essentially, if being is not of the highest Essentially, if being is not of the highest possible kind, then this lack of absoluteness is seen possible kind, then this lack of absoluteness is seen as a deficiency that is evident by the fact that it must as a deficiency that is evident by the fact that it must undergo change in order to rectify said deficiency.undergo change in order to rectify said deficiency.If on the other hand it is of the highest kind, If on the other hand it is of the highest kind, then by necessity it could only be for the worse and then by necessity it could only be for the worse and therefore pointless.therefore pointless.Scroll of SetScroll of Set - December 1998 - Page - December 1998 - Page 2020"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Ergo, the highest possible form of being is Ergo, the highest possible form of being is changeless while the rest of us, poor schmucks that changeless while the rest of us, poor schmucks that we are, keep changing.

With the intrinsic notion that “transition equals inferiority”, the early church “transition equals inferiority”, the early church founders grabbed this idea with both hands and ran.founders grabbed this idea with both hands and ran.Another interesting point of differentiation Another interesting point of differentiation between becoming and being is that the philosophy between becoming and being is that the philosophy of becoming does not denigrate being in order to of becoming does not denigrate being in order to qualify itself. Being is seen as an aspect of qualify itself. Being is seen as an aspect of becoming through the notion of permanence as an becoming through the notion of permanence as an aspect of novelty.aspect of novelty.To further understand how becoming To further understand how becoming interrelates to being via within the self, looking at the interrelates to being via within the self, looking at the self as territory, with being and becoming as its self as territory, with being and becoming as its respectively geographical and historical analogies is respectively geographical and historical analogies is useful.useful.In looking at being as geography, the known In looking at being as geography, the known singular events and experiences, or “landmarks” singular events and experiences, or “landmarks” that the self has undergone via becoming reference that the self has undergone via becoming reference the identity of the self as known at this time through the identity of the self as known at this time through the structure of being.the structure of being.I emphasize the temporal aspect on purpose, as I emphasize the temporal aspect on purpose, as what is known of a thing is not necessarily equal to what is known of a thing is not necessarily equal to the totality of the thing. In other words, the map is the totality of the thing. In other words, the map is not the territory.not the territory.In looking at becoming as history, the self has In looking at becoming as history, the self has experiences that lead to other associated and experiences that lead to other associated and contingent experiences. These grouped experiences contingent experiences. These grouped experiences form foundation points that, while being things unto form foundation points that, while being things unto themselves, are also building blocks, or foundations, themselves, are also building blocks, or foundations, upon which new experiences and new states of upon which new experiences and new states of being can be aspired to.being can be aspired to.A good analogy of this would be the A good analogy of this would be the metamorphosis that a butterfly undergoes towards metamorphosis that a butterfly undergoes towards its final form. It starts off in a state of qualifications its final form. It starts off in a state of qualifications that can be defined as a caterpillar, then goes that can be defined as a caterpillar, then goes through a transition period wherein it is now a through a transition period wherein it is now a completely different form as a butterfly, but still completely different form as a butterfly, but still maintains the state of the caterpillar as part of its maintains the state of the caterpillar as part of its heritage.heritage.This being said, the association between being This being said, the association between being and becoming lies in the somewhat paradoxical and becoming lies in the somewhat paradoxical concept that permanence only exists truly in the concept that permanence only exists truly in the novel. Basically the static form that takes on the novel. Basically the static form that takes on the smallest new factor becomes new in its totality.smallest new factor becomes new in its totality.The consideration of how both time and space The consideration of how both time and space are integral to the process of self-evolution are integral to the process of self-evolution (especially if one considers history bound in the (especially if one considers history bound in the temporal and geography bound in the spatial) is temporal and geography bound in the spatial) is interesting in that it actually goes towards clearing interesting in that it actually goes towards clearing up earlier philosophical contemplations that, up until up earlier philosophical contemplations that, up until the emergence of Process philosophy, were the emergence of Process philosophy, were considered paradoxical.considered paradoxical.Specifically I’m referring to the idea of Zeno’s Specifically I’m referring to the idea of Zeno’s arrow. Zeno of Elea lived circa 470 BCE. Zeno was arrow. Zeno of Elea lived circa 470 BCE. Zeno was very much opposed to the idea that things actually very much opposed to the idea that things actually changed. [I admire the guy for this, taking on a changed. [I admire the guy for this, taking on a toughie.] He qualified his argument by toughie.] He qualified his argument by contemplating a fired arrow.contemplating a fired arrow.His basic question was this: In any indivisible His basic question was this: In any indivisible instant of its flight, is an arrow moving or at rest? If instant of its flight, is an arrow moving or at rest? If it is considered to be moving, how can it move in a it is considered to be moving, how can it move in a static instant? If it is considered at rest, it was never static instant? If it is considered at rest, it was never moving to begin with.moving to begin with.If one considers the question in relation to being If one considers the question in relation to being and becoming as an “either/or” issue, then you and becoming as an “either/or” issue, then you have the arrow as not moving either way, even have the arrow as not moving either way, even though empirical evidence (i.e. seeing the arrow though empirical evidence (i.e. seeing the arrow flying) proves otherwise.flying) proves otherwise.However, if one were to consider the paradox However, if one were to consider the paradox from the standpoint of being operative in from the standpoint of being operative in conjunction with becoming, a reconciliation of the conjunction with becoming, a reconciliation of the problem presents itself. Simply put, the arrow can problem presents itself. Simply put, the arrow can be considered a “different” arrow from moment to be considered a “different” arrow from moment to moment, as its identity in part is qualified by the moment, as its identity in part is qualified by the temporal and spatial coordinates that the arrow temporal and spatial coordinates that the arrow occupies at that moment while at the same time occupies at that moment while at the same time maintaining an overall qualification of “an arrow”.maintaining an overall qualification of “an arrow”.This is analogous to the self-evolutionary This is analogous to the self-evolutionary process. Our selves exist from moment to moment process. Our selves exist from moment to moment in a state of being in the now, and through the in a state of being in the now, and through the contingent experiences that we will into being, we contingent experiences that we will into being, we Remanifest to the next state of being.Remanifest to the next state of being.Hopefully this gives an adequate foundation to Hopefully this gives an adequate foundation to now focus upon the relation between Process now focus upon the relation between Process Philosophy and the Left-Hand Path. This portion Philosophy and the Left-Hand Path. This portion can more or less be entitled “What does this have to can more or less be entitled “What does this have to do with us?”. I have refrained from going into do with us?”. I have refrained from going into certain key principles of Process Philosophy until certain key principles of Process Philosophy until now on the basis that I feel they would be best now on the basis that I feel they would be best qualified through specific aspects of Setian qualified through specific aspects of Setian philosophy.philosophy.Although there are many Process philosophers Although there are many Process philosophers who could be seen as putting forth ideas pertinent to who could be seen as putting forth ideas pertinent to Setian thought, I have chosen to focus upon the Setian thought, I have chosen to focus upon the works of Alfred North Whitehead, due both to the works of Alfred North Whitehead, due both to the pragmatics of brevity and the fact that I feel he pragmatics of brevity and the fact that I feel he comes the closest in his ideas to qualifying Process comes the closest in his ideas to qualifying Process Philosophy as what Magus Webb once referred to Philosophy as what Magus Webb once referred to as “as “XeperXeper without the magic”. without the magic”.Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), an Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), an Englishman whose work started primarily in the Englishman whose work started primarily in the field of mathematics, can indeed be considered the field of mathematics, can indeed be considered the primary proponent of Process Philosophy in the primary proponent of Process Philosophy in the 20th century. His 20th century. His magnum opusmagnum opus on the subject is on the subject is Process and RealityProcess and Reality. Although it is a dry, complex . Although it is a dry, complex read, it does contain the cumulation of his work on read, it does contain the cumulation of his work on the subject.the subject.One of the more interesting tenets of Whitehead, One of the more interesting tenets of Whitehead, in my opinion, was the notion of in my opinion, was the notion of consequent consequent naturenature as the driving force of the universe. This is as the driving force of the universe. This is an idea that bears considerable weight when one an idea that bears considerable weight when one contemplates Setian ideas such as “Mighty is Set, contemplates Setian ideas such as “Mighty is Set, mightier still is he through us.”, and the quotation mightier still is he through us.”, and the quotation Scroll of SetScroll of Set - December 1998 - Page - December 1998 - Page 2121"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"from the from the Book of Coming Forth by NightBook of Coming Forth by Night “I think “I think not of those who think not of me.”.not of those who think not of me.”.Whitehead saw creativity as being universal and Whitehead saw creativity as being universal and not limited to any particular god. This made not limited to any particular god. This made creativity a two-way street. It holds both the abilities creativity a two-way street. It holds both the abilities of self-creation and the creative influence of others.of self-creation and the creative influence of others.In this paradigm a god would then be affected In this paradigm a god would then be affected by the creative manifestations of others. In making by the creative manifestations of others. In making creativity universal, freedom is then the essence of creativity universal, freedom is then the essence of reality and not a special case scenario.reality and not a special case scenario.To exist then means to be capable of creating To exist then means to be capable of creating one’s self and also influencing the creation of those one’s self and also influencing the creation of those by whom one is known, including any god. by whom one is known, including any god. Whitehead qualifies this notion by stating that a Whitehead qualifies this notion by stating that a self-creative creature must also create something in a self-creative creature must also create something in a god, for someone who manifests something in god, for someone who manifests something in within their self also manifests something in the within their self also manifests something in the knowledge of all who know him or her.knowledge of all who know him or her.As mentioned earlier, Whitehead touched upon As mentioned earlier, Whitehead touched upon principles congruent to principles congruent to XeperXeper and Remanifestation and Remanifestation in his works. This is seen in his central doctrine: in his works. This is seen in his central doctrine: “The Many become One and are increased by “The Many become One and are increased by One.” Basically, with each experience we have, One.” Basically, with each experience we have, there are the preceding foundational experiences that there are the preceding foundational experiences that it was built upon. These are the “many” referred to. it was built upon. These are the “many” referred to. They coalesce into a new qualifiable unit of reality They coalesce into a new qualifiable unit of reality and become “one”.and become “one”.Going back to the idea of permanence existing Going back to the idea of permanence existing in the novel, the coming into being of this new in the novel, the coming into being of this new collective unit of reality and its addition to collective unit of reality and its addition to contingent experiences therefore increases it by one; contingent experiences therefore increases it by one; In effect, the synthesis of the many into a new one In effect, the synthesis of the many into a new one produces a new many. The parallels with produces a new many. The parallels with Remanifestation are, I think, obvious.Remanifestation are, I think, obvious.In closing I want to reiterate that this article only In closing I want to reiterate that this article only scrapes the surface of the potentiality that scrapes the surface of the potentiality that explorations into Process Philosophy could explorations into Process Philosophy could manifest in our individual and collective journeys manifest in our individual and collective journeys upon the Left-Hand Path. That being said, if we can upon the Left-Hand Path. That being said, if we can further understand further understand XeperXeper as a process, we can better as a process, we can better understand the “how” as well as the “why”. understand the “how” as well as the “why”.
