That’s not what as the goal of dialectical training. That’s not what Plato was after. Plato was after Plato was after. Plato was after epistemeepisteme, which is a , which is a Greek word that has a number of connotations over Greek word that has a number of connotations over and above mere “knowledge”.and above mere “knowledge”.The post-Enlightenment notion of The post-Enlightenment notion of “knowledge” as some intellectual apprehension is a “knowledge” as some intellectual apprehension is a very pale cousin to Plato’s notion of very pale cousin to Plato’s notion of epistemeepisteme.
