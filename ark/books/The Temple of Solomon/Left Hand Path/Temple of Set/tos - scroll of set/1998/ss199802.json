This quote came to mind as I started . This quote came to mind as I started to write this article, because these words lead us to write this article, because these words lead us directly to its heart: what is it that we seek to directly to its heart: what is it that we seek to understand when we enter into the study and understand when we enter into the study and practice of magic, and upon what First Principles do practice of magic, and upon what First Principles do we base the design of a magical order so as to we base the design of a magical order so as to maximize the initiation of its members.maximize the initiation of its members.Such an understanding of First Principles seems Such an understanding of First Principles seems particularly important as the Order of Horus starts particularly important as the Order of Horus starts its next phase of growth within the Temple of Set, its next phase of growth within the Temple of Set, and as it also begins to invite inquires from persons and as it also begins to invite inquires from persons in the larger magical community who may or may in the larger magical community who may or may not have any background in Setian notions of not have any background in Setian notions of initiation. Thus it seems prudent to exercise that initiation. Thus it seems prudent to exercise that specifically Setian faculty of foresight and, through specifically Setian faculty of foresight and, through use of that faculty, consciously plan how we wish to use of that faculty, consciously plan how we wish to see the Order of Horus continue to unfold.see the Order of Horus continue to unfold.As a Left-Hand Path organization, the Order of As a Left-Hand Path organization, the Order of Horus is based on the notion of individual Horus is based on the notion of individual XeperXeper with the goal of psyche-centric immortality. The with the goal of psyche-centric immortality. The Order of Horus is specifically the “royal” order: Order of Horus is specifically the “royal” order: the Order within the Temple of Set which focuses the Order within the Temple of Set which focuses particularly upon its members attaining those particularly upon its members attaining those aspects of royalty that we find manifested by the aspects of royalty that we find manifested by the Setian pharaohs of old and, hopefully, by the leaders Setian pharaohs of old and, hopefully, by the leaders we are creating for the future.we are creating for the future.This “royal” flavor has to do with Horus as an This “royal” flavor has to do with Horus as an aspect of the divine kingship, which role Horus aspect of the divine kingship, which role Horus shares with his brother Set. Although it is a topic for shares with his brother Set. Although it is a topic for another article, the coronation ritual for an Egyptian another article, the coronation ritual for an Egyptian pharaoh [see Van Gennep] involves the pharaoh pharaoh [see Van Gennep] involves the pharaoh receiving the dual aspects of Horus and Set. As receiving the dual aspects of Horus and Set. As currently understood within the Order of Horus, currently understood within the Order of Horus, these dual aspects entail action or command (the these dual aspects entail action or command (the outward-facing Horus aspect) and the reflective outward-facing Horus aspect) and the reflective consciousness upon which action is based (the consciousness upon which action is based (the inward-facing Setian aspect).inward-facing Setian aspect).Royalty also entails a study of “firsts”. After Royalty also entails a study of “firsts”. After all it is the king or queen who “comes first” and all it is the king or queen who “comes first” and leads. Essential to any person who aspires to such a leads. Essential to any person who aspires to such a position is the proper training in what First position is the proper training in what First Principles are, how one finds them manifest in the Principles are, how one finds them manifest in the external universe, and how one draws from them external universe, and how one draws from them into one’s own consciousness, wherein they form into one’s own consciousness, wherein they form the basis for future manifestation or command.the basis for future manifestation or command.This study of First Principles is therefore This study of First Principles is therefore something central to the task of the Order of Horus. something central to the task of the Order of Horus. It is by finding, internalizing, and then manifesting It is by finding, internalizing, and then manifesting such First Principles that god-kings and goddess-such First Principles that god-kings and goddess-queens function in their roles as leaders or royal queens function in their roles as leaders or royal persons.persons.The study of First Principles is something that The study of First Principles is something that occurs on at least two different levels - the individual occurs on at least two different levels - the individual and the larger external. These two levels are not and the larger external. These two levels are not really different, since it is the nature of First really different, since it is the nature of First Principles (by definition) to be identical in both the Principles (by definition) to be identical in both the subjective and the objective universes.subjective and the objective universes.This is a very important point. First Principles This is a very important point. First Principles are what make the world knowable to us. They allow are what make the world knowable to us. They allow us to organize our thoughts in a systematic manner us to organize our thoughts in a systematic manner so that we come to understand both the external so that we come to understand both the external world and ourselves. So we can see that to attain to world and ourselves. So we can see that to attain to “Understanding” one needs to first be able to “Understanding” one needs to first be able to ascertain the First Principles that are “out there” in ascertain the First Principles that are “out there” in the world around us, and to organize and the world around us, and to organize and contemplate these First Principles so that we come contemplate these First Principles so that we come to not only know the external world, but to to not only know the external world, but to understand it, and thus come to understand understand it, and thus come to understand ourselves.ourselves.There are four upward ways of extracting First There are four upward ways of extracting First Principles from the external universe and four Principles from the external universe and four downward ways of manifesting them from the downward ways of manifesting them from the subjective universe. The four upward ways of subjective universe. The four upward ways of extracting First Principles are:extracting First Principles are:1. Nœtic (direct) apprehension,1. Nœtic (direct) apprehension,2. Induction (empirical observation and 2. Induction (empirical observation and experiment),experiment),3. Deduction (logical reasoning and dialogue - 3.

Mathematics (the pure essences and their interaction).interaction).The four downward paths can be conceived of The four downward paths can be conceived of as the four elements, all of which perform an aspect as the four elements, all of which perform an aspect of manifestation (or a movement from the subjective of manifestation (or a movement from the subjective to the objective). While much can be written of the to the objective). While much can be written of the downward paths, suffice it to say that they are the downward paths, suffice it to say that they are the various ways in which things manifest - the various various ways in which things manifest - the various thoughts, actions, commands or happenings that thoughts, actions, commands or happenings that entail an embodiment.entail an embodiment.The reason that I have dealt with this in such The reason that I have dealt with this in such detail is that one way of conceiving of detail is that one way of conceiving of “Understanding” is to say that to understand “Understanding” is to say that to understand means that an individual understands the First means that an individual understands the First Principles from which things arise, and therefore Principles from which things arise, and therefore understands why they must necessarily be the way understands why they must necessarily be the way they are. Such an individual can also look at they are. Such an individual can also look at something in the external world and extract the First something in the external world and extract the First Principle(s) that underlie it (i.e. its essence), and Principle(s) that underlie it (i.e. its essence), and thus one immediately understands why the thing is, thus one immediately understands why the thing is, and must be, the way it is.and must be, the way it is.For example, a straight line (in Euclidian space) For example, a straight line (in Euclidian space) has as its essence, or First Principle, that it is the has as its essence, or First Principle, that it is the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"shortest distance between two points.

That is see what are the First Principles of magic.

As a first approximation which the Order is based. As a first approximation we can say that the Order of Horus is a magical we can say that the Order of Horus is a magical school of initiation whereby First Principles of school of initiation whereby First Principles of magic and initiation are discovered and worked. magic and initiation are discovered and worked. Hence this article turns out to be an invitation to Hence this article turns out to be an invitation to others to join in this search for First Principles.others to join in this search for First Principles.This is terribly important to me as the Grand This is terribly important to me as the Grand Master of the Order of Horus, as it is imperative that Master of the Order of Horus, as it is imperative that the Order of Horus formulate itself, consciously and the Order of Horus formulate itself, consciously and deliberately, upon the very First Principles of magic deliberately, upon the very First Principles of magic and initiation. As was stated in prior articles, to the and initiation. As was stated in prior articles, to the extent that the Order of Horus is a remanifestation, extent that the Order of Horus is a remanifestation, along LHP lines, of the A.'.A.'., then we need to along LHP lines, of the A.'.A.'., then we need to ascertain the First Principles underlying the A.'.A.'. ascertain the First Principles underlying the A.'.A.'. system. Similarly, if we are looking to the First system. Similarly, if we are looking to the First Principles of how a pharaoh transformed himself Principles of how a pharaoh transformed himself into a divine being, we need to discover what those into a divine being, we need to discover what those First Principles are.First Principles are.Among our membership we have a wide variety Among our membership we have a wide variety of interests in various topics, and I couldn’t wish for of interests in various topics, and I couldn’t wish for anything better. By studying various topics, from anything better. By studying various topics, from the A.'.A.'. to zoology, from goddesses to Germanic the A.'.A.'. to zoology, from goddesses to Germanic runes, we can look to various fields of manifestation runes, we can look to various fields of manifestation to extract First Principles upon which the Order of to extract First Principles upon which the Order of Horus is centered: those upon which self-Horus is centered: those upon which self-transformation into a divine being can take place. In transformation into a divine being can take place. In the early stages of the development of the Order of the early stages of the development of the Order of Horus, it is particularly important that we find the Horus, it is particularly important that we find the First Principles underlying our work.First Principles underlying our work.If I as Grand Master were to say that we should If I as Grand Master were to say that we should formulate the Order of Horus with four elemental formulate the Order of Horus with four elemental grades, three Adepti grades, and the Magister grades, three Adepti grades, and the Magister Templi, Magus, and Ipsissimus grades that the Templi, Magus, and Ipsissimus grades that the Order of Horus shares with the Temple of Set Order of Horus shares with the Temple of Set degrees [these designations are not identical degrees [these designations are not identical between the Order and the Temple for a number of between the Order and the Temple for a number of reasons], then we need to understand the First reasons], then we need to understand the First Principles underlying each of these grades. Only Principles underlying each of these grades. Only then can we intelligently reformulate the meaning as then can we intelligently reformulate the meaning as a LHP organization of these grades. Only then will a LHP organization of these grades. Only then will we understand the essence of these grades, such that we understand the essence of these grades, such that we are thereafter able to Remanifest those grades we are thereafter able to Remanifest those grades along LHP lines.along LHP lines.By way of a first approximation, it is important By way of a first approximation, it is important to master the four elemental grades, so that as to master the four elemental grades, so that as magicians we have command over the fourfold magicians we have command over the fourfold means of magical manifestation. We must also means of magical manifestation. We must also master the three Adepti grades, so that as magicians master the three Adepti grades, so that as magicians we have self-mastery over the central aspects of we have self-mastery over the central aspects of consciousness, will and self, which rule over the consciousness, will and self, which rule over the streams of manifestation. Likewise we must at all streams of manifestation. Likewise we must at all times continue to seek the Understanding, Wisdom, times continue to seek the Understanding, Wisdom, and Perfection that are the attributes of the divine and Perfection that are the attributes of the divine self as reflected in the three highest grades.self as reflected in the three highest grades.Thus it is our task to ask ourselves - as we will Thus it is our task to ask ourselves - as we will ask our all of future members - what are the First ask our all of future members - what are the First Principles underlying our particular fields of interest Principles underlying our particular fields of interest and expertise. By asking this question we ask each and expertise. By asking this question we ask each other to understand the First Principles that have other to understand the First Principles that have attracted us. By such understanding we come to a attracted us. By such understanding we come to a place where the Order of Horus can convey to place where the Order of Horus can convey to others an understanding of these various First others an understanding of these various First Principles. We can develop each other as future Principles. We can develop each other as future masters of understanding, since we ask each other to masters of understanding, since we ask each other to apprehend and manifest the First Principles that are apprehend and manifest the First Principles that are nearest and dearest to each of us.nearest and dearest to each of us.This focus on First Principles and mastery This focus on First Principles and mastery seems appropriate to a magical order that is based seems appropriate to a magical order that is based on royal principles. Wouldn’t we be false to each on royal principles. Wouldn’t we be false to each other if we were to ask any less of a group of people other if we were to ask any less of a group of people who seek to transform themselves into divine beings who seek to transform themselves into divine beings - leaders of the magical movements of the next - leaders of the magical movements of the next millennium? I invite you all to join me in this quest millennium? I invite you all to join me in this quest for First Principles and Understanding, whereby we for First Principles and Understanding, whereby we can set forth a magical order whose mind dwells in can set forth a magical order whose mind dwells in the highest realms, and whose base extends to all the the highest realms, and whose base extends to all the various facets of the manifest universe.various facets of the manifest universe.______________________________________________________________________[2] [2] New MetaMind ElementNew MetaMind ElementOpen for Business!Open for Business!- by Robertt Neilly IV°- by Robertt Neilly IV°About thirteen months ago it became clear that About thirteen months ago it became clear that the timing and a host of other magical ingredients the timing and a host of other magical ingredients had formed a recipe for the Remanifestation of the had formed a recipe for the Remanifestation of the MetaMind Element.

You cannot prove that belief.

The belief that by doing a person by his own merit. The belief that by doing a good job at the duties of your caste you would be good job at the duties of your caste you would be rewarded by being born in a higher caste is rewarded by being born in a higher caste is intrinsically no different from the Christian doctrine intrinsically no different from the Christian doctrine that promises a post-mortem reward for being a that promises a post-mortem reward for being a good little slave to YHVH.

This area of study exotic world of quantum physics. This area of study has explained hitherto mysterious phenomena while has explained hitherto mysterious phenomena while leading to even greater paradoxes than the ones it leading to even greater paradoxes than the ones it has explained. One of the thought experiments has explained. One of the thought experiments which illustrates this is the famous “Schrödinger’s which illustrates this is the famous “Schrödinger’s cat” scenario from the mind of physicist Erwin cat” scenario from the mind of physicist Erwin Schrödinger:Schrödinger:Imagine a cat is in a box, which at some Imagine a cat is in a box, which at some point in time will be filled with poisonous gas. point in time will be filled with poisonous gas. Pick any point in time - is the cat alive or dead? Pick any point in time - is the cat alive or dead? Well, both and neither - without actually Well, both and neither - without actually opening the box and looking, one can only opening the box and looking, one can only give probabilities of the cat’s status. When give probabilities of the cat’s status. When actually observed, then the probability is actually observed, then the probability is resolved into one state or the other. The very resolved into one state or the other. The very act of observing changes the outcome.act of observing changes the outcome.This might seem like an entertaining thought This might seem like an entertaining thought with no practical applications. But actually with no practical applications. But actually physicists have found this describes the actual state physicists have found this describes the actual state of the subatomic particles which constitute reality as of the subatomic particles which constitute reality as we know it.we know it.Take a group of particles - such as the one that Take a group of particles - such as the one that makes up this sheet of paper. Can you calculate makes up this sheet of paper. Can you calculate exactly the location and activity of every particle? exactly the location and activity of every particle? Anything that exists, as existence is usually Anything that exists, as existence is usually understood, has a location in space and time, like the understood, has a location in space and time, like the sheet of paper which is in your hands right now. So sheet of paper which is in your hands right now. So you should be able to locate every particle in space you should be able to locate every particle in space and time. But again those particles only have a and time. But again those particles only have a probability of where they actually exist, until the act probability of where they actually exist, until the act of observing “causes” them to take a particular of observing “causes” them to take a particular location in space-time, a phenomenon known as location in space-time, a phenomenon known as State Vector Collapse (SVC).
