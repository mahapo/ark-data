In order to accomplish this a certain amount deceit. In order to accomplish this a certain amount of self-preoccupation is necessary. However it is of self-preoccupation is necessary. However it is possible to carry this to the point where we become possible to carry this to the point where we become virtual hermits, and I have observed this in the virtual hermits, and I have observed this in the Temple of Set.

To eat, breathe, the Temple of Set his/her whole life. To eat, breathe, and sleep nothing but magic, especially on the level and sleep nothing but magic, especially on the level which we practice it, would be to lose one’s balance which we practice it, would be to lose one’s balance and perspective very quickly. We all have mundane and perspective very quickly. We all have mundane concerns, families in some cases, and outside concerns, families in some cases, and outside interests, and that is fine.interests, and that is fine.What is not fine is when the Temple of Set What is not fine is when the Temple of Set consistentlyconsistently takes a back seat to these other things. takes a back seat to these other things. I am appalled at some of the reasons Setians give I am appalled at some of the reasons Setians give for not attending or participating in Temple for not attending or participating in Temple functions, especially those of a magical nature: functions, especially those of a magical nature: “There’s a program on T.V.
