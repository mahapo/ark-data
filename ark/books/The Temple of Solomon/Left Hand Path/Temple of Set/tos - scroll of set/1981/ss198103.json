Conventional religions are correct in saying that one could be destroyed through the saying that one could be destroyed through the acceptance of this blessing and curse. However such acceptance of this blessing and curse. However such destruction comes from oneself, not from Set. Set destruction comes from oneself, not from Set. Set acts as a mirror, and he has said that he has given us acts as a mirror, and he has said that he has given us (Setians) free will. This echoes the old mythological (Setians) free will. This echoes the old mythological legend of selling your soul to the Devil, because if legend of selling your soul to the Devil, because if such freedom is mishandled, you can obliterate such freedom is mishandled, you can obliterate yourself.yourself.In the discussion on “Love and Hate”, the In the discussion on “Love and Hate”, the Pylon was faced with the question of what love and Pylon was faced with the question of what love and hate mean to us as Setians, and how they apply in hate mean to us as Setians, and how they apply in our lives. Adept Mitchell said that she regarded both our lives. Adept Mitchell said that she regarded both as being applicable to the self. Love means being as being applicable to the self. Love means being aware of yourself, liking who you are, liking that aware of yourself, liking who you are, liking that which you are Becoming. Hate applies when you which you are Becoming. Hate applies when you confront those aspects of yourself that you do not confront those aspects of yourself that you do not like, to change them constructively. Outward love like, to change them constructively. Outward love directed towards other Setians, she continued, directed towards other Setians, she continued, occurs because they are of ourselves; we have a link occurs because they are of ourselves; we have a link to each other.to each other.I pointed out that it was also possible to love I pointed out that it was also possible to love non-Setians, because certain aspects of theirs non-Setians, because certain aspects of theirs enhance and complement certain aspects of enhance and complement certain aspects of ourselves.

Viewed in will be self-evident to II°+ Setian readers. Viewed in historical context, the scope of Machen’s vision and historical context, the scope of Machen’s vision and its ultimate failure can be seen as almost inevitable.its ultimate failure can be seen as almost inevitable.Arthur Machen was an initiate of the Hermetic Arthur Machen was an initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the British magical Order of the Golden Dawn, the British magical society in which Aleister Crowley received his society in which Aleister Crowley received his preliminary training. The G.'.D.'. was a White preliminary training. The G.'.D.'. was a White Magical order in the precise sense understood by Magical order in the precise sense understood by the Temple of Set, involved in the quest for initiatory the Temple of Set, involved in the quest for initiatory harmony with the existing state of the natural harmony with the existing state of the natural Universe. As such its operative magical Universe.

Accordingly he could only Side of the Force. Accordingly he could only conjecture about the Dark Side.conjecture about the Dark Side.The White PeopleThe White People is a conceptual examination is a conceptual examination of the nature of evil. Machen rejects as inadequate of the nature of evil. Machen rejects as inadequate the traditional, primitive notion that evil is the traditional, primitive notion that evil is necessarily antisocial or even destructive. Evil in its necessarily antisocial or even destructive. Evil in its true sense consists in that which is outside the true sense consists in that which is outside the natural order of the universe. Seeking, however, to natural order of the universe. Seeking, however, to achieve harmony with that universe, he makes two achieve harmony with that universe, he makes two erroneous assumptions: that true evil must be erroneous assumptions: that true evil must be unconscious of itself, and that the evil man will be unconscious of itself, and that the evil man will be an ascetic.an ascetic.Consciousness evolves through a synthetic Consciousness evolves through a synthetic process in the Hegelian sense via the comparison of process in the Hegelian sense via the comparison of contrasting data, beginning with the recognition of contrasting data, beginning with the recognition of “self” and “not-self”.“self” and “not-self”.Awareness of oneself as an isolate identity, Awareness of oneself as an isolate identity, distinct and apart from the natural universe distinct and apart from the natural universe (”God”) is the original and most deadly sin, (”God”) is the original and most deadly sin, bringing with it the knowledge of good and evil. bringing with it the knowledge of good and evil.

He was unable to perceive should not be surprising. He was unable to perceive the Dark Side and could only hypothesize it as an the Dark Side and could only hypothesize it as an inversion of what he knew, just as Christians seem inversion of what he knew, just as Christians seem unable to conceive of the Left-Hand Path as being unable to conceive of the Left-Hand Path as being anything but a version of their own simplistic myth-anything but a version of their own simplistic myth-system in reverse.system in reverse.The “saint”, enraptured by the submersion of The “saint”, enraptured by the submersion of his personal ego in the universal order, would be his personal ego in the universal order, would be unconcerned with any single manifestation of the unconcerned with any single manifestation of the universe. More appropriately, perhaps, he would be universe. More appropriately, perhaps, he would be equally unconcerned with all. There would be no equally unconcerned with all. There would be no distinction of value between gold and brass, veal and distinction of value between gold and brass, veal and hamburger; for all things are but manifestations of hamburger; for all things are but manifestations of “one”. The universe is seen as a hologram, with the “one”. The universe is seen as a hologram, with the whole implicit in every part; hence his passion for whole implicit in every part; hence his passion for the whole might well make him an ascetic and lead the whole might well make him an ascetic and lead him to eschew the parts.him to eschew the parts.The true “sinner”, on the other hand, from his The true “sinner”, on the other hand, from his perspective of intellectual detachment from the state perspective of intellectual detachment from the state of the universe, might also be an ascetic, but not of the universe, might also be an ascetic, but not necessarily.
