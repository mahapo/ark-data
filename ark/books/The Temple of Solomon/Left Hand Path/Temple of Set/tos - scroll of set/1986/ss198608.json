There were four workings done - through March 1. There were four workings done - the first two using the first of the ritual texts that the first two using the first of the ritual texts that follow and the third and fourth using the second of follow and the third and fourth using the second of the attached texts.the attached texts.The impetus for these developments came from The impetus for these developments came from the powerful conclave working under the direction the powerful conclave working under the direction of Priestess Moffatt and Magister Neilly in Las of Priestess Moffatt and Magister Neilly in Las Vegas at Set-VI. It was my intent to explore further Vegas at Set-VI. It was my intent to explore further the concepts of ECI as presented and also to attempt the concepts of ECI as presented and also to attempt to develop a system of working that would also to develop a system of working that would also combine it with certain psychological concepts.combine it with certain psychological concepts.One of the things I have learned in counselling One of the things I have learned in counselling is that people have to cope as children with how to is that people have to cope as children with how to handle difficult situations. Unfortunately a child handle difficult situations. Unfortunately a child does not have the psychic wherewithal to handle does not have the psychic wherewithal to handle confrontation or stress in the best possible manner. confrontation or stress in the best possible manner. It is during childhood that we learn patterns of It is during childhood that we learn patterns of behavior and those things which make up our adult behavior and those things which make up our adult personalities. In order for an adult to learn new personalities. In order for an adult to learn new patterns of behavior, especially almost instinctual patterns of behavior, especially almost instinctual approaches that a person has to stress, one must approaches that a person has to stress, one must “unfreeze” this behavior/personality trait and “unfreeze” this behavior/personality trait and “refreeze” in what is desired. As a mundane “refreeze” in what is desired. As a mundane example, refer to the military’s boot camp.example, refer to the military’s boot camp.What I intended to do was set up a return to What I intended to do was set up a return to early, early childhood, using a strobe set on the early, early childhood, using a strobe set on the same speed as a heartbeat recording. This proved same speed as a heartbeat recording. This proved impossible because of the equipment at hand, so we impossible because of the equipment at hand, so we used the strobe at twice the speed of the heartbeat used the strobe at twice the speed of the heartbeat recording. We also wore the scent of our mother or recording. We also wore the scent of our mother or father as remembered from childhood. In addition father as remembered from childhood. In addition we feasted on favorite childhood foods prior to the we feasted on favorite childhood foods prior to the first and second workings. These were to serve two first and second workings. These were to serve two purposes: to allow us the same kind of time-travel as purposes: to allow us the same kind of time-travel as the first part of the Set-VI working, and also to tap the first part of the Set-VI working, and also to tap our individual child-unconscious in order to allow our individual child-unconscious in order to allow the adult to unfreeze and refreeze oneself.the adult to unfreeze and refreeze oneself.In order to initiate the time travel, a clear In order to initiate the time travel, a clear visualization [along with the other senses] is visualization [along with the other senses] is required. Also in order to tap the true subconscious, required. Also in order to tap the true subconscious, images must be invoked. It is my contention that images must be invoked. It is my contention that any verbalization during this period of time would any verbalization during this period of time would destroy the visually symbolic process. The destroy the visually symbolic process. The psychological concept is that personal history serves psychological concept is that personal history serves as a foundation for all capabilities and limitations.as a foundation for all capabilities and limitations.In our experiment to change the past, celebrants In our experiment to change the past, celebrants would be asked to visualize themselves in an would be asked to visualize themselves in an unpleasant situation, form a “snapshot” image of it, unpleasant situation, form a “snapshot” image of it, then float out of the picture and look at it then float out of the picture and look at it (disassociation). The celebrants then float out of that (disassociation). The celebrants then float out of that and look at themselves looking at themselves. We and look at themselves looking at themselves. We would then watch and listen carefully to everything would then watch and listen carefully to everything happening to that younger person. The person must happening to that younger person. The person must be reintegrated at this point by reversing the process be reintegrated at this point by reversing the process - float back and rejoin himself.- float back and rejoin himself.Our first working was held December 14. The Our first working was held December 14. The experiences of the celebrants were very similar in experiences of the celebrants were very similar in that we explored a space or location that held some that we explored a space or location that held some significance for several years during childhood, significance for several years during childhood, rather than a particular childhood incident or rather than a particular childhood incident or specific memory. The wearing of a scent didn’t specific memory. The wearing of a scent didn’t seem to make any difference. All of us explored seem to make any difference. All of us explored scenes without a parent, in fact mostly without other scenes without a parent, in fact mostly without other people.people.I wanted to try and establish a particular I wanted to try and establish a particular crystallized moment in the second working, because crystallized moment in the second working, because the following two ECIs were to be attempts to the following two ECIs were to be attempts to rewrite the past. The heartbeat [which went at one-rewrite the past. The heartbeat [which went at one-half the time of the strobe because I couldn’t get the half the time of the strobe because I couldn’t get the strobe to go that slow] had the very positive effect of strobe to go that slow] had the very positive effect of a focus. I suspect any drum beat would work as well a focus. I suspect any drum beat would work as well however. It did have the added psychological impact, however. It did have the added psychological impact, though, of being a “mother’s heartbeat”. I timed though, of being a “mother’s heartbeat”. I timed the speaking part of the ritual to the speed of the the speaking part of the ritual to the speed of the heartbeat.heartbeat.We performed the second of the ECI workings We performed the second of the ECI workings in January and obtained very similar results to the in January and obtained very similar results to the first. Priest Flowers suggested, half in jest, that we first. Priest Flowers suggested, half in jest, that we call it “acceleration” instead of “inertia”.call it “acceleration” instead of “inertia”.I might mention at this point that in all our I might mention at this point that in all our experiences with ECI thus far there had been no experiences with ECI thus far there had been no interaction aurally with people. In fact only one interaction aurally with people. In fact only one scene out of the seven experiences had any people scene out of the seven experiences had any people in it at all. I felt certain, however, that the in it at all. I felt certain, however, that the “unpleasant” experiences we were about to recall “unpleasant” experiences we were about to recall would.would.The third and fourth workings were to be The third and fourth workings were to be attempts to change the past through two different attempts to change the past through two different methods. The first would use the methods involving methods. The first would use the methods involving the watching of the childhood self from the adult the watching of the childhood self from the adult viewpoint, with little or no tampering with the scene. viewpoint, with little or no tampering with the scene.

The fourth was February 25, unpleasant incidents. The fourth was February 25, and I offered two choices: either a “re-write of the and I offered two choices: either a “re-write of the script” of the incident, which must of course be script” of the incident, which must of course be multi-sensory, or the alteration of the original scene multi-sensory, or the alteration of the original scene by such methods as changing a moving picture of by such methods as changing a moving picture of the time to a still, from color to black and white, the time to a still, from color to black and white, reduction in size until it disappears, etc. Since the reduction in size until it disappears, etc. Since the members of the Pylon tried both methods, I can members of the Pylon tried both methods, I can report that the latter method seemed to be the most report that the latter method seemed to be the most efficacious.efficacious."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the third and fourth workings. there were In the third and fourth workings. there were some across-the-board kinds of results, and some across-the-board kinds of results, and naturally some that were specific to the individual. naturally some that were specific to the individual.
