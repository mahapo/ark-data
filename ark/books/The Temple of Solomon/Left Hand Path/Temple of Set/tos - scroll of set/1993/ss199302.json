We criticize our activities or those of our society. We must die to that way of being - reconstruct ourselves must die to that way of being - reconstruct ourselves - become self-created gods to be truly alive. This - become self-created gods to be truly alive. This process isn’t a onetime affair in our Initiation but a process isn’t a onetime affair in our Initiation but a continuing one. We are always dying to an old state, continuing one. We are always dying to an old state, for example your recent transition to the state of for example your recent transition to the state of Adept entailed a dying to the state of the I°, or on a Adept entailed a dying to the state of the I°, or on a more mundane level college represents dying to the more mundane level college represents dying to the state of high school.

The soul is then sent obedience to the laws of God. The soul is then sent to a Heaven or a Hell to receive the result of that to a Heaven or a Hell to receive the result of that judgement. Death is not the end in the view of a judgement. Death is not the end in the view of a person who adheres to these beliefs, it is merely a person who adheres to these beliefs, it is merely a graduation of the life to another level (which is graduation of the life to another level (which is nonetheless ordered by God).nonetheless ordered by God).C.

If the life of the body and the life of the the psyche. If the life of the body and the life of the psyche are indeed separate from one another, it psyche are indeed separate from one another, it necessarily follows that the term “life”, referring to necessarily follows that the term “life”, referring to the body, ends with its death - but beyond this death the body, ends with its death - but beyond this death the life of the psyche may continue!the life of the psyche may continue!To denote which life is being spoken of in To denote which life is being spoken of in written/oral references, I propose that the profane written/oral references, I propose that the profane term “life” be used in regard to that which term “life” be used in regard to that which motivates the body, and the term “the life” when motivates the body, and the term “the life” when that of the psyche is to be indicated. In addition the that of the psyche is to be indicated. In addition the profane term “death” would be used in respect to profane term “death” would be used in respect to the extinguishing of the human body while “the the extinguishing of the human body while “the death” would refer to the end of the psyche’s death” would refer to the end of the psyche’s being.
