The only work along the lines of the elements. The finding of the Philosopher’s Stone works in cycles finding of the Philosopher’s Stone works in cycles of physical matter being destroyed, purified, of physical matter being destroyed, purified, vaporized, and returned to a more pure physical vaporized, and returned to a more pure physical form. The process works in cycles, just as the form. The process works in cycles, just as the process of process of XeperXeper is the experience of life, initiatory is the experience of life, initiatory death, and Remanifestation. This is my vision of death, and Remanifestation. This is my vision of Setamorphic alchemy; a mechanical system of self-Setamorphic alchemy; a mechanical system of self-initiation that crystallizes the components of self, initiation that crystallizes the components of self, and forms interaction between life and death as a and forms interaction between life and death as a whole.whole.The elements of the alchemists stand as symbols The elements of the alchemists stand as symbols of the components of being. Out of First Matter of the components of being. Out of First Matter (potential), the first element manifest was that of fire, (potential), the first element manifest was that of fire, and the first active element in the “making” of the and the first active element in the “making” of the Philosopher’s Stone. The alchemical fire is Philosopher’s Stone. The alchemical fire is symbolic of will, the initial momentum that symbolic of will, the initial momentum that commences the path of commences the path of XeperXeper. Will is the force that . Will is the force that causes change without, and Setamorphosis within. It causes change without, and Setamorphosis within. It is the animating factor of First Matter. When the is the animating factor of First Matter. When the fire of will is applied to the vessel of the human fire of will is applied to the vessel of the human mind, potential moves and becomes individual mind, potential moves and becomes individual reality. The desire to Come into Being remains inert reality. The desire to Come into Being remains inert without the application of will. The process begins without the application of will. The process begins with will and self-realization: a birth. The first five with will and self-realization: a birth. The first five processes of the Stone are steps of sacrifice and processes of the Stone are steps of sacrifice and death. The raw material is heated until it is reduced death. The raw material is heated until it is reduced to ash, separated, removed of obsolete surface to ash, separated, removed of obsolete surface qualities, and allowed to decay in order to release the qualities, and allowed to decay in order to release the “spark of Life”. The material is reduced to First “spark of Life”. The material is reduced to First Matter, stripped of all surface qualities to allow the Matter, stripped of all surface qualities to allow the spark of life to escape. The potential has become spark of life to escape. The potential has become reality. The death of the qualities that may hinder the reality. The death of the qualities that may hinder the self has occurred, and the higher self is realized, and self has occurred, and the higher self is realized, and one may begin creation of his own universe. This one may begin creation of his own universe. This concept is inherent in the wand. “With the wand concept is inherent in the wand. “With the wand createth he.” The wand is used in traditional magic createth he.” The wand is used in traditional magic to direct will upon the natural realm. With the self to direct will upon the natural realm. With the self now free from the hindrances of the mundane, one now free from the hindrances of the mundane, one can enter the process of life and death that brings can enter the process of life and death that brings Immortality.Immortality.The second element to manifest is that of water.

The cup is the magical and brimming with Life! The cup is the magical instrument of the water element, the Graal that instrument of the water element, the Graal that contains the Elixir of Life. The cup is the horizontal contains the Elixir of Life. The cup is the horizontal element, the plane of infinity. The wand is the element, the plane of infinity. The wand is the vertical element, the touch of the Creator. The vertical element, the touch of the Creator. The element of water becomes active in the third element of water becomes active in the third alchemical process of separation, the crucial point of alchemical process of separation, the crucial point of self-analysis. It is out of the fluidic/water element self-analysis. It is out of the fluidic/water element that the Philosopher’s Stone begins to crystallize as that the Philosopher’s Stone begins to crystallize as the qualities of the elements converge within the the qualities of the elements converge within the Stone. Water remains active through the seventh Stone.

The self has evolved to a state of being that of air. The self has evolved to a state of being aware, and is said to be conscious. In the eighth aware, and is said to be conscious. In the eighth process of the Philosopher’s Stone, the Stone is process of the Philosopher’s Stone, the Stone is transubstantiated into vapor, the air element. This is transubstantiated into vapor, the air element. This is compared to the Soul’s survival post-mortem. Air is compared to the Soul’s survival post-mortem. Air is the element of the Intellect, the Gift of Set. From the the element of the Intellect, the Gift of Set. From the state of being vapor, the Stone is re-materialized into state of being vapor, the Stone is re-materialized into solid form again. According to the alchemical texts, solid form again. According to the alchemical texts, this process is performed repeatedly to remove this process is performed repeatedly to remove impurities that may remain from the initial impurities that may remain from the initial processes. The repetitive initiatory death and processes. The repetitive initiatory death and Remanifestation is demonstrated in this process, and Remanifestation is demonstrated in this process, and is crucial to the Black Magician. It is following this is crucial to the Black Magician. It is following this process that the Stone of the Wise becomes gold, process that the Stone of the Wise becomes gold, containing the virtues of all four elements, in varying containing the virtues of all four elements, in varying quantities.
