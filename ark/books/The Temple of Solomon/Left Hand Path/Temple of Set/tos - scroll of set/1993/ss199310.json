I welcome which are no longer functional. I welcome discussion from the High Priest, III°+s, and other discussion from the High Priest, III°+s, and other Sentinels.Sentinels.IdentityIdentityThe functioning pylons seem to be strong in The functioning pylons seem to be strong in their sense of identity. This is something a pylon their sense of identity. This is something a pylon needs, but which can be established when it evolves needs, but which can be established when it evolves of its own accord. It should have broad outlines in of its own accord. It should have broad outlines in the beginning so as not to be constricting later on, the beginning so as not to be constricting later on, but enough definition to let the current of the but enough definition to let the current of the Temple focus through it. The pylon is not the Temple focus through it. The pylon is not the personal “Temple” of the Sentinel nor the personal “Temple” of the Sentinel nor the “hobby” of the Sentinel, as tempting as it may be “hobby” of the Sentinel, as tempting as it may be to make it that. It is an established portal of the to make it that. It is an established portal of the Temple of Set which has as its outer form the Temple of Set which has as its outer form the imagery given it by the Sentinel.imagery given it by the Sentinel.This imagery may or may not contribute to the This imagery may or may not contribute to the initiations of the members. In currently functional initiations of the members. In currently functional pylons it appears to be so. To ensure that it has a pylons it appears to be so. To ensure that it has a probable likelihood of being helpful, however, the probable likelihood of being helpful, however, the imagery should be something that has broad imagery should be something that has broad application to a number of magical styles. I think application to a number of magical styles. I think real specific and advanced concepts should be left to real specific and advanced concepts should be left to sub- or side-interests of the pylon so as not to sub- or side-interests of the pylon so as not to distract or confuse new Initiates.distract or confuse new Initiates.A pylon should not try to model itself after an A pylon should not try to model itself after an Order. A pylon is meant for basic initiation for all Order. A pylon is meant for basic initiation for all concerned. It is a catalyst and facilitator of concerned. It is a catalyst and facilitator of XeperXeper. . The pylon members are led into the Temple’s The pylon members are led into the Temple’s magical current, its Mysteries, and to Set, as the magical current, its Mysteries, and to Set, as the source of, or end point of, whatever imagery is being source of, or end point of, whatever imagery is being used. If they become lost in or confused by the used. If they become lost in or confused by the symbolism and need repeated explanations, then the symbolism and need repeated explanations, then the imagery is in need of simplification or of breaking-imagery is in need of simplification or of breaking-down into levels of appreciation for the various down into levels of appreciation for the various levels of ability.levels of ability.I felt at the beginning of Draconis Pylon that I felt at the beginning of Draconis Pylon that perhaps I should have done a lot more “fleshing perhaps I should have done a lot more “fleshing out” of the out” of the neterneter. I wanted to do lots of “dragon” . I wanted to do lots of “dragon” workings. But we didn’t get around to that, because workings. But we didn’t get around to that, because other workings became more important. I realized other workings became more important. I realized that getting new Setians started is more important that getting new Setians started is more important than doing the “fun” stuff of dreaming up neat than doing the “fun” stuff of dreaming up neat netersneters and edifying symbols. So we did workings and edifying symbols. So we did workings that dealt with understanding and personalizing that dealt with understanding and personalizing XeperXeper, Set, the Graal, Maat, the mechanics of a basic , Set, the Graal, Maat, the mechanics of a basic ritual, and repetitions of that, which led to the ritual, and repetitions of that, which led to the exploration of the elements in order to be able to say exploration of the elements in order to be able to say we had worked with every part of the ritual format.we had worked with every part of the ritual format.The magical current generated by the pylon has The magical current generated by the pylon has become the matrix within which the elemental work become the matrix within which the elemental work and the work of Dynamic Balance arose. As such it and the work of Dynamic Balance arose. As such it is part of the legacy of the pylon. And through the is part of the legacy of the pylon. And through the pylon being a portal of the Temple’s magical pylon being a portal of the Temple’s magical current, what is done here then flows back to the current, what is done here then flows back to the Temple. As Sentinels and as Priests working with Temple. As Sentinels and as Priests working with others, even though it may be our ideas and impulse others, even though it may be our ideas and impulse that sets things in motion, we need to appreciate that that sets things in motion, we need to appreciate that we might well not have gone this far without these we might well not have gone this far without these Setians to provide that energy base and sustain the Setians to provide that energy base and sustain the current in our area.current in our area.Personal WorkPersonal WorkI think it is paramount that at all times each I think it is paramount that at all times each pylon member understand that individual personal pylon member understand that individual personal work is the norm, and pylon work the exception. If work is the norm, and pylon work the exception. If the Setian sees pylon night as the time to get the Setian sees pylon night as the time to get pumped up and “do some pumped up and “do some realreal magic for a magic for a change”, then there is a serious problem for the change”, then there is a serious problem for the Setian concerned. This is what the folks do who Setian concerned. This is what the folks do who warm church pews on Sunday. It needs to be warm church pews on Sunday. It needs to be repeated frequently that the vast majority of work is repeated frequently that the vast majority of work is homeworkhomework that we should feel personally driven to that we should feel personally driven to do. Our work flows from a “magical necessity”, as do. Our work flows from a “magical necessity”, as Magus Flowers once put it. When we meet and Magus Flowers once put it. When we meet and work with the pylon, we share the “overflow” of work with the pylon, we share the “overflow” of that personal work. But we are not drained, nor that personal work. But we are not drained, nor depleted, nor do we attend out of desperation to depleted, nor do we attend out of desperation to gorge on the offerings of others. This latter is a state gorge on the offerings of others. This latter is a state often seen in new Setians, but it is brief if they truly often seen in new Setians, but it is brief if they truly work and work and XeperXeper..Setian GatheringsSetian GatheringsWhen Setians who are geographically close, When Setians who are geographically close, meet often socially and to share ritual time, there is a meet often socially and to share ritual time, there is a danger. One would think this the ideal situation for danger. One would think this the ideal situation for a pylon, as I did. If there is a III°+ close, available a pylon, as I did. If there is a III°+ close, available and involved, it can be. However what happens if and involved, it can be. However what happens if there isn’t is that those who get together frequently there isn’t is that those who get together frequently become clones of each other. If relationships become clones of each other. If relationships become problematic, the group can break up become problematic, the group can break up because of “bad feelings”. This might not have because of “bad feelings”. This might not have happened if initially all had kept the focus of the happened if initially all had kept the focus of the pylon, and regardless of their close proximity, pylon, and regardless of their close proximity, concentrated on personal work, except for the pylon concentrated on personal work, except for the pylon rites or occasional special personal rites.

It is necessary for all pylon members to “cut their own way through the jungle”, to quote “cut their own way through the jungle”, to quote Ipsissimus Crowley. It is the sole responsibility of Ipsissimus Crowley. It is the sole responsibility of the Sentinel, or supervising Priest, to directly guide the Sentinel, or supervising Priest, to directly guide the work of the members. The Priest realizes what is the work of the members. The Priest realizes what is needed in individual cases, is often not at liberty to needed in individual cases, is often not at liberty to discuss it with the eager-to-help Adepts, and simply discuss it with the eager-to-help Adepts, and simply must expect that they will follow the protocol of the must expect that they will follow the protocol of the pylon model.pylon model.If pylon members plan on living together, I If pylon members plan on living together, I speak with them about their intent, go over the speak with them about their intent, go over the potential problems, and ask how they intend to avoid potential problems, and ask how they intend to avoid or deal with them.

Secondly is the comfort level of those working area. Secondly is the comfort level of those working within that area. If I sense someone in the pylon is within that area. If I sense someone in the pylon is having difficulty, my first concern is that the portal having difficulty, my first concern is that the portal remain sound and effective. I will talk with the remain sound and effective. I will talk with the person(s) concerned and offer to work with them person(s) concerned and offer to work with them individually, but apart from the formal pylon individually, but apart from the formal pylon gatherings and rites. I remind them that gatherings and rites. I remind them that XeperXeper and and initiation are possible that way as well. I make all initiation are possible that way as well. I make all information of pylon rites and meetings available to information of pylon rites and meetings available to them, and them, and dodo consider them members of the pylon, consider them members of the pylon, ready to include them at some future time when that ready to include them at some future time when that works out.

For that made it possible, even if it is a new pylon. For that reason alone it is imperative that all pylon members reason alone it is imperative that all pylon members try to understand and appreciate the importance of try to understand and appreciate the importance of contributing to the Æonic current. If the goal of our contributing to the Æonic current. If the goal of our work is strictly selfish, without regard for the impact work is strictly selfish, without regard for the impact of generating a personal current that feeds into the of generating a personal current that feeds into the current of the Temple, then we lose out on current of the Temple, then we lose out on something significant. The fact of being a Setian is something significant. The fact of being a Setian is not enough. Personal not enough. Personal XeperXeper, regardless of the color , regardless of the color of our medallion, or accolades from others, is the of our medallion, or accolades from others, is the factor that determines the strength of one’s factor that determines the strength of one’s individual current.
