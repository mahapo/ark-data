She asked me, more serious than other groups. She asked me, “How?” I hemmed and hawed awhile. Now I have “How?” I hemmed and hawed awhile. Now I have the beginning of an answer:the beginning of an answer:1. The Group Within as Attractor1.

Diversity of MembershipHistoric manifestations of LHP [however Historic manifestations of LHP [however differently understood by their followers - we are all differently understood by their followers - we are all creatures of our time] have had a membership drawn creatures of our time] have had a membership drawn from the extremes of society. Medieval Satanists from the extremes of society. Medieval Satanists wore either the leader types born as downtrodden wore either the leader types born as downtrodden serfs who cried out in their pain for a better serfs who cried out in their pain for a better existence, or nobles like Gilles de Rais, seeking to existence, or nobles like Gilles de Rais, seeking to make gold, or scholars like Agrippa seeking make gold, or scholars like Agrippa seeking knowledge.

Generally this is expressed as “I seemed to have Generally this is expressed as “I seemed to have known X all my life”. In the Temple this is not an known X all my life”. In the Temple this is not an uncommon experience. As we develop a sense of uncommon experience. As we develop a sense of self in this community of selves, there’s a flash of self in this community of selves, there’s a flash of recognition/Recognition of seeing some aspect of recognition/Recognition of seeing some aspect of yourself in another’s writings, words, or magic. yourself in another’s writings, words, or magic. That you see these things in others so frequently in That you see these things in others so frequently in the Temple is a sign of the validity of your own the Temple is a sign of the validity of your own experience, of their experience, and the property of experience, of their experience, and the property of the Temple as an organization to bring about such the Temple as an organization to bring about such occurrences.

Noticeable Lack of Equality Coupled with RespectRespectOne of the strongest signs of authenticity of the One of the strongest signs of authenticity of the Temple I’ve encountered is the obvious difference Temple I’ve encountered is the obvious difference between myself and individuals of a higher initiatory between myself and individuals of a higher initiatory degree. It’s not the simple difference of knowledge degree. It’s not the simple difference of knowledge or experience; there’s a genuine difference in the or experience; there’s a genuine difference in the quality of being. It is as though I’ve had but a brief quality of being. It is as though I’ve had but a brief draught at the well of being and they have become draught at the well of being and they have become the well themselves.

In addition to usefulness as an initiatory toolbox. In addition to providing a large array of scholarship and skills, the providing a large array of scholarship and skills, the Temple provides a series of working models of Temple provides a series of working models of human evolution. You can understand the goal of human evolution. You can understand the goal of initiation because you have living models to initiation because you have living models to consider. Not only do the individuals with more consider. Not only do the individuals with more advanced degrees provide evidence of higher states, advanced degrees provide evidence of higher states, but watching others go through the same initiatory but watching others go through the same initiatory experiences as yourself [or arriving where you are experiences as yourself [or arriving where you are by different means] gives you a concrete idea of by different means] gives you a concrete idea of your own progress.

Your own self can excitement at your own being. Your own self can only find definition in interactions with other selves, only find definition in interactions with other selves, and no other community will offer as many different and no other community will offer as many different types of graded interaction.types of graded interaction.7. The Validity of Common Language7. The Validity of Common LanguageSince we seek to deal with experiences beyond Since we seek to deal with experiences beyond common human experience, we face the dilemma of common human experience, we face the dilemma of communication. How can we share our findings communication. How can we share our findings with one another without common words? Mystics with one another without common words? Mystics of the past have usually resorted to neologisms - so of the past have usually resorted to neologisms - so each mystic comes along and creates a whole new each mystic comes along and creates a whole new set of names, and people beginning on the path set of names, and people beginning on the path aren’t even sure if all these people are talking about aren’t even sure if all these people are talking about the same thing.the same thing.The Temple’s common language, by remaining The Temple’s common language, by remaining simple [although each word or phrase may have a simple [although each word or phrase may have a great logical depth], permits its Initiates to explore great logical depth], permits its Initiates to explore and expand knowledge, although they may be and expand knowledge, although they may be removed from one another by space or time. This removed from one another by space or time. This permits a large group to interact on magical or permits a large group to interact on magical or philosophical problems without an inflation of philosophical problems without an inflation of terminology. The simple language system also terminology. The simple language system also encourages clarity and honesty; it becomes encourages clarity and honesty; it becomes acceptable to say “I don’t know” or “I think”.acceptable to say “I don’t know” or “I think”.8.

Their devotees are supposed to spend a lifetime just Their devotees are supposed to spend a lifetime just studying them, and even then they don’t know if studying them, and even then they don’t know if they got it right. Did I pick up the hidden meaning they got it right. Did I pick up the hidden meaning of that parable? Or there are systems where the lines of that parable? Or there are systems where the lines between the known, the unknown, and the between the known, the unknown, and the unknowable are so fuzzily drawn that the unknowable are so fuzzily drawn that the practitioner can never state with any accuracy what practitioner can never state with any accuracy what he is doing - or recognize a result as having been he is doing - or recognize a result as having been accomplished. Such systems usually look for magic accomplished. Such systems usually look for magic outside the self and equate incomprehensibility with outside the self and equate incomprehensibility with the numinous.the numinous.Within the Temple mysteries are recognized as Within the Temple mysteries are recognized as identifiable things; we can label them, point to them, identifiable things; we can label them, point to them, and enable others to recognize them - without losing and enable others to recognize them - without losing sight of the fact that they are mysteries.

This implies is the Sense of the Unknown. This implies an element of subjectivity, which will have a an element of subjectivity, which will have a different quality depending upon the level of different quality depending upon the level of Initiation of that Subject. For the non-Initiate, Initiation of that Subject.

One of the greatest of all vitally than anything else. One of the greatest of all human drives is the drive to uncover the hidden, to human drives is the drive to uncover the hidden, to discover that which was previously unknown.

What they may mean by by “mystics” of the past. What they may mean by “mystery” and what I mean by “mystery” and what I mean by RunaRuna are two are two different things. different things. RunaRuna does not lead to obscurity; does not lead to obscurity; rather it is the first step to clarity. Just as Socrates rather it is the first step to clarity. Just as Socrates was declared the wisest man in all Hellas because he was declared the wisest man in all Hellas because he claimed to “know nothing” - as all knowledge claimed to “know nothing” - as all knowledge begins with the assumption of ignorance - so too begins with the assumption of ignorance - so too does clarity begin with a Sense of the Hidden. This does clarity begin with a Sense of the Hidden. This is an eternal process: As we push back the veil of is an eternal process: As we push back the veil of the Hidden in one field, that very act creates yet the Hidden in one field, that very act creates yet more fields of the Unknown beyond.

Humanity, however, is another story entirely.Humanity, however, is another story entirely.First there have been arguments centering on the First there have been arguments centering on the “free will” vs. “predestination” issue.“free will” vs. “predestination” issue.Free-will extremists say that humanity is Free-will extremists say that humanity is completely discretionary: that people are free do completely discretionary: that people are free do whatever they want or allow one another to do, with whatever they want or allow one another to do, with no “higher standard” of any sort involved beyond no “higher standard” of any sort involved beyond social consensus.social consensus.Predestination proponents, usually religious, try Predestination proponents, usually religious, try to constrain human freedom and individual choice to constrain human freedom and individual choice by insisting that mankind has a “fate” or a by insisting that mankind has a “fate” or a “mission” dictated by God [or gods].“mission” dictated by God [or gods].Telos Telos supports neither of these positions, and is supports neither of these positions, and is something far more subtle and elegant.something far more subtle and elegant.According to this approach, the According to this approach, the telostelos of each of each human is dictated not by any external God [or social human is dictated not by any external God [or social standard], but by his or her potential and capacity to standard], but by his or her potential and capacity to realize that potential. Fulfilling realize that potential.

It does not necessarily require ascertainable. It does not necessarily require complex intellectual gymnastics: A person whose complex intellectual gymnastics: A person whose telostelos involves forestry may gravitate towards that involves forestry may gravitate towards that lifestyle and profession without writing a graduate lifestyle and profession without writing a graduate thesis on it. All he knows is that he “likes to do it thesis on it. All he knows is that he “likes to do it and is good at it”.and is good at it”.One way of looking at “initiation” is to say that One way of looking at “initiation” is to say that it is a means for identifying, achieving, and it is a means for identifying, achieving, and maximizing one’s maximizing one’s telostelos..Seen thus, the Word of a Magus is essentially a Seen thus, the Word of a Magus is essentially a teleological statement. Crowley’s teleological statement.
