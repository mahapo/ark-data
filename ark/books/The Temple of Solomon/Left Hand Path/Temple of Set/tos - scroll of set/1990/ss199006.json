Barrett III°- by Ronald L. Barrett III°During the Set-X Conclave in New Orleans last During the Set-X Conclave in New Orleans last summer, an Initiate posed a question to me which summer, an Initiate posed a question to me which went something like this:went something like this:If we as Black Magicians are consciously If we as Black Magicians are consciously existing outside of the natural order, and effect existing outside of the natural order, and effect magical change solely by the will within magical change solely by the will within ourselves, why then do we go through all the ourselves, why then do we go through all the trouble of employing all these rituals and trouble of employing all these rituals and symbols in our magical work?symbols in our magical work?My answer at the time was that he was correct in My answer at the time was that he was correct in theory, but that, at the present stage of most of our theory, but that, at the present stage of most of our initiations, these symbols are probably necessary initiations, these symbols are probably necessary tools to help us in our respective journeys. The tools to help us in our respective journeys. The important thing is that we recognize that we are important thing is that we recognize that we are utilizing them to tap into our own potential, and that utilizing them to tap into our own potential, and that we are the ones who are in conscious command of we are the ones who are in conscious command of this process.this process.The question also reminded me of The question also reminded me of Black MagicBlack Magic in the in the Crystal TabletCrystal Tablet, wherein is given the example , wherein is given the example of Dumbo as an aspiring Black Magician who was of Dumbo as an aspiring Black Magician who was eventually able to fly without having that feather in eventually able to fly without having that feather in his nose.

So here I sit in front of my keyboard, with spare time and this stupid elephant keyboard, with spare time and this stupid elephant flying around in my head - flapping his ears and flying around in my head - flapping his ears and giving me that cute, animated grin. Questions are a giving me that cute, animated grin. Questions are a powerful tool in initiation when they inspire the kind powerful tool in initiation when they inspire the kind of exploration which can reveal new directions along of exploration which can reveal new directions along the Left-Hand Path, and I think this one provides a the Left-Hand Path, and I think this one provides a good azimuth into the issue of the role of symbol good azimuth into the issue of the role of symbol and ritual in initiation.

The problem lies in profane individuals’ problem lies in profane individuals’ misunderstanding and misdirected use of the word: misunderstanding and misdirected use of the word: that “Satanism” is the opposite of what they are [or that “Satanism” is the opposite of what they are [or at least pretend to be]. Therefore it is not to be at least pretend to be]. Therefore it is not to be allowed, and the “soul” of him who touches it will allowed, and the “soul” of him who touches it will be punished.

On this level not be recognized until the Year Ten. On this level the meaning of Walpurgisnacht is obviously one of the meaning of Walpurgisnacht is obviously one of new beginnings - at least on a magical level - and a new beginnings - at least on a magical level - and a time to recognize our roots.time to recognize our roots.The apparent reason LaVey chose this night to The apparent reason LaVey chose this night to declare the advent of the Age of Satan is that this is declare the advent of the Age of Satan is that this is the night of the greatest traditional gathering, or the night of the greatest traditional gathering, or sabbat, of the witches in Germany and central sabbat, of the witches in Germany and central Europe. [See J.W. von Goethe’s Europe.

February 25 is her true Festival Day on 25, 777 CE. February 25 is her true Festival Day on the Monastic Calendar, but it is said to have been the Monastic Calendar, but it is said to have been “moved” to April 30 in the Roman Calendar. “moved” to April 30 in the Roman Calendar. Conventionally it is simply explained that her April Conventionally it is simply explained that her April 30th Festival Day coincides with May Eve, which 30th Festival Day coincides with May Eve, which was important to the pre-Christian Teutons and to was important to the pre-Christian Teutons and to Celts as well. In Irish it coincides with Beltaine. So Celts as well. In Irish it coincides with Beltaine. So the dear old saint’s day just happened to fall on a the dear old saint’s day just happened to fall on a night important to the pagans and subsequently to night important to the pagans and subsequently to the practitioners of survivals of pagan customs often the practitioners of survivals of pagan customs often identified as “witches.” In this theory it is pure identified as “witches.” In this theory it is pure coincidence that St. Walburga’s is associated with coincidence that St. Walburga’s is associated with the “Witches’ Sabbat”.the “Witches’ Sabbat”.This explanation has something to recommend This explanation has something to recommend it. It is very likely that for hundreds of years after it. It is very likely that for hundreds of years after the nominal [and almost always violently coerced] the nominal [and almost always violently coerced] “conversion” of the various Teuton tribes to “conversion” of the various Teuton tribes to Christianity they continued to worship their own Christianity they continued to worship their own gods and goddesses in the guise of saints. This gods and goddesses in the guise of saints. This process of magical syncretism can be readily seen in process of magical syncretism can be readily seen in the more modern context of the Afro-Carribean the more modern context of the Afro-Carribean region, e.g. “Santeria” - the cult of the saints. There region, e.g. “Santeria” - the cult of the saints. There we see how the pagan African gods and goddesses we see how the pagan African gods and goddesses are symbolically “dressed up” in the outer forms are symbolically “dressed up” in the outer forms and even names of Catholic saints. On an outer level and even names of Catholic saints. On an outer level the “faithful” may appear to be piously the “faithful” may appear to be piously worshipping the martyred Christian or angelic worshipping the martyred Christian or angelic being, but in the inner reality the underlying, purer, being, but in the inner reality the underlying, purer, pagan form is being addressed.pagan form is being addressed.There is overwhelming evidence that this took There is overwhelming evidence that this took place in Europe as well, and that from the place in Europe as well, and that from the beginnings of Christianity to at least the time of the beginnings of Christianity to at least the time of the Counter-Reformation and Enlightenment (ca. 17th Counter-Reformation and Enlightenment (ca. 17th century) many were consciously practicing century) many were consciously practicing something which might be called “European something which might be called “European Santeria”. Several forms of this system, which Santeria”. Several forms of this system, which varied from tribal area to tribal area, have been varied from tribal area to tribal area, have been identified by historians of religion.identified by historians of religion.Such an explanation would already identify St. Such an explanation would already identify St. Walburga with some Germanic goddess having Walburga with some Germanic goddess having something to do with magic or witchcraft. The something to do with magic or witchcraft. The explanation could stop there, but amazingly enough explanation could stop there, but amazingly enough it does not end with this.it does not end with this.The greatest single clue to a deeper and older The greatest single clue to a deeper and older authentic and non-arbitrary meaning for authentic and non-arbitrary meaning for Walpurgisnacht comes on a clay tablet (Greek Walpurgisnacht comes on a clay tablet (Greek ostrakonostrakon) found in Elephantine in Egypt. The tablet ) found in Elephantine in Egypt. The tablet dates from around 200 CE and reads “Baloubourg dates from around 200 CE and reads “Baloubourg Se(m)noni sibylla (Walburg sibyl of the Se(m)noni sibylla (Walburg sibyl of the Semnones)”. This “Walburg” is the same name Semnones)”. This “Walburg” is the same name which later becomes “Walburga.” But its meaning which later becomes “Walburga.” But its meaning would tend to make us think that it was originally would tend to make us think that it was originally more a title of magical name rather than an ordinary more a title of magical name rather than an ordinary personal given name. The “Wal(u)” probably personal given name. The “Wal(u)” probably means “the dead” or “fallen” [as in means “the dead” or “fallen” [as in Wal-hallaWal-halla (hall of the fallen)], while the “-burg” means (hall of the fallen)], while the “-burg” means “enclosure” or “fortress”. So the name basically “enclosure” or “fortress”. So the name basically means “Fortress of the Fallen” - an ideal name or means “Fortress of the Fallen” - an ideal name or title for one whose major function would have been title for one whose major function would have been necromancy.necromancy.With this information an altogether deeper and With this information an altogether deeper and more complex picture begins to emerge. It would more complex picture begins to emerge. It would seem that not only did the time of Walpurgisnacht seem that not only did the time of Walpurgisnacht and the places where this time was celebrated (high and the places where this time was celebrated (high mountain top) hold sacred significance to the pre-mountain top) hold sacred significance to the pre-Christian Germans, but also the very name of this Christian Germans, but also the very name of this saint has its roots in the practice of pre-Christian saint has its roots in the practice of pre-Christian magic.magic.The true significance of May Eve is that it is the The true significance of May Eve is that it is the dark inner seed of the manifestation of the “Lord dark inner seed of the manifestation of the “Lord Scroll of SetScroll of Set - June 1990 - Page - June 1990 - Page 33"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"May” - the herald of summer in which the seeds of May” - the herald of summer in which the seeds of magical will planted in the subjective universe are magical will planted in the subjective universe are brought to fruition in the objective universe. brought to fruition in the objective universe.

Eliot’s several years I quoted these lines from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding”, made [more] famous by their “Little Gidding”, made [more] famous by their cryptic use in John Fowles’ cryptic use in John Fowles’ The MagusThe Magus (#6I): (#6I):We shall not cease from explorationWe shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.And know the place for the first time.That Fowles was strongly moved by Eliot’s That Fowles was strongly moved by Eliot’s lines is further demonstrated by his use of them for lines is further demonstrated by his use of them for the concluding statement of the screenplay he wrote the concluding statement of the screenplay he wrote for the film-version of for the film-version of The MagusThe Magus..Paradoxically, however, it was precisely this goal Paradoxically, however, it was precisely this goal that proved impossible for that proved impossible for MagusMagus protagonist protagonist Nicholas Urfe. The teaching of the Magus Conchis Nicholas Urfe. The teaching of the Magus Conchis was that the quest for a “higher purpose” to human was that the quest for a “higher purpose” to human adventure was merely a conceit: there is no “god”; adventure was merely a conceit: there is no “god”; the sea of circumstances and events in which we the sea of circumstances and events in which we swim is the product of pure hazard. In swim is the product of pure hazard. In The AristosThe Aristos Fowles developed this theme:Fowles developed this theme:The purpose of hazard is to force us, and The purpose of hazard is to force us, and the rest of matter, to evolve. It is only by the rest of matter, to evolve. It is only by evolving that we, in a process that is evolving, evolving that we, in a process that is evolving, can continue to survive. The purpose of can continue to survive. The purpose of humanhuman evolution is therefore to recognize evolution is therefore to recognize this: that we must evolve to exist.this: that we must evolve to exist.Fowles faulted all religions, all philosophies as Fowles faulted all religions, all philosophies as being in some sense machinery to limit the free being in some sense machinery to limit the free exercise of human perceptions and genius. He exercise of human perceptions and genius. He would presumably challenge even the Temple of Set would presumably challenge even the Temple of Set because, despite its commitment to individualism, it because, despite its commitment to individualism, it nonetheless erects an artificial structure by which nonetheless erects an artificial structure by which this individualism may be defined and strengthened: this individualism may be defined and strengthened: our system of Recognized initiation. Fowles’ ideal our system of Recognized initiation. Fowles’ ideal manman... knows everything is relative, nothing is ... knows everything is relative, nothing is absolute. He sees one world with many absolute. He sees one world with many situations; not one situation. For him no situations; not one situation. For him no judgment stands; and he will not permanently judgment stands; and he will not permanently join, because if he permanently joins with join, because if he permanently joins with others, however intelligent, however well-others, however intelligent, however well-intentioned, he helps to constitute an elect, a intentioned, he helps to constitute an elect, a Few. He knows from history that sooner or later Few. He knows from history that sooner or later every congregation of the elect is driven to every congregation of the elect is driven to condone bad means to good ends; then they condone bad means to good ends; then they cease to be a congregation of the elect and cease to be a congregation of the elect and become a mere oligarchy.become a mere oligarchy.The means by which the Temple of Set may The means by which the Temple of Set may avoid degenerating into oligarchy is really quite avoid degenerating into oligarchy is really quite simple: it is to remain itself an existential simple: it is to remain itself an existential devicedevice: to : to provide ever more excellent provide ever more excellent meansmeans but never a but never a dictated, common end towards which those means dictated, common end towards which those means are to be employed. Hence the necessary absence in are to be employed.

Why? Because he had created the concept Magus. Why? Because he had created the concept (= Uttered a Word) of supercars which, while as (= Uttered a Word) of supercars which, while as excellent as they might be, were nonetheless excellent as they might be, were nonetheless incomplete and imperfect in themselves.
