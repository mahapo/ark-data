In my discussions with Setians on the individualist. In my discussions with Setians on the subject of astrology, a frequent comment has been subject of astrology, a frequent comment has been that they don’t like the idea of “something out that they don’t like the idea of “something out there” determining what they will do. This concern there” determining what they will do. This concern has been turning over in my mind for some time as I has been turning over in my mind for some time as I sought to correlate what I have experienced of sought to correlate what I have experienced of astrology first-hand in my ongoing studies, and astrology first-hand in my ongoing studies, and what I have come to know of Set and Leviathan what I have come to know of Set and Leviathan through the Temple of Set and its writings.through the Temple of Set and its writings.It was the reading of some of these that brought It was the reading of some of these that brought the mystery of astrology into focus for me for the the mystery of astrology into focus for me for the first time. Here I use the word “mystery” in the first time. Here I use the word “mystery” in the sense explained in the “Apologetics” articles - a sense explained in the “Apologetics” articles - a core belief that moves one into initiatory states when core belief that moves one into initiatory states when one explores it relevant to one’s self or deity. A one explores it relevant to one’s self or deity. A diluted/distorted version appears in mythology diluted/distorted version appears in mythology coexisting with the mystery. Its primary value lies in coexisting with the mystery. Its primary value lies in the personal answer to the question: “What does the personal answer to the question: “What does this mystery do for me?” The Setian means: “How this mystery do for me?” The Setian means: “How does this mystery assist in my process of self-does this mystery assist in my process of self-discovery, self-actualization, or discovery, self-actualization, or XeperXeper?”?”The questions that I had were the following:The questions that I had were the following:(1) How can a future event or condition be (1) How can a future event or condition be known in the present?known in the present?(2) How can free will exist if its choices are (2) How can free will exist if its choices are already known?already known?It has been sad that Set does not remember the It has been sad that Set does not remember the future. In considering this, I would like to suggest future. In considering this, I would like to suggest that Set, however, knows that Set, however, knows where to lookwhere to look for the for the future, and future, and how to discern it should he choosehow to discern it should he choose. I . I suggest that this is so because the trail of Leviathan suggest that this is so because the trail of Leviathan must reach into the future - if it exists at all and if it must reach into the future - if it exists at all and if it is true to its nature of being the principle of is true to its nature of being the principle of continuity and ageless existence.

I which we initiated our own personal evolutions. I think of Leviathan as the spark of think of Leviathan as the spark of initiativeinitiative that that keeps everything moving along in the mechanical keeps everything moving along in the mechanical universe, and that nourishes the deep yearning universe, and that nourishes the deep yearning within to realize our potential, thus inspiring us to within to realize our potential, thus inspiring us to use the Gift of Set.use the Gift of Set.As physical beings we are part of the mechanical As physical beings we are part of the mechanical universe, like it or not.

That pattern of acting and reacting which gives us our character, acting and reacting which gives us our character, personality, and shoe size may well have been personality, and shoe size may well have been deliberately chosen by deliberately chosen by oneselfoneself in a long-forgotten in a long-forgotten past in our first encounter with Set as a companion past in our first encounter with Set as a companion intelligent being, charting our course along the trail intelligent being, charting our course along the trail of Leviathan. It’s my speculation that we chose then, of Leviathan. It’s my speculation that we chose then, for ourselves now and for the future. It is also my for ourselves now and for the future. It is also my speculation that somewhere in our core being exist speculation that somewhere in our core being exist our future selves, already full-grown and willfully our future selves, already full-grown and willfully directing the choices of the moment to bring directing the choices of the moment to bring themselves into the existence we have chosen. The themselves into the existence we have chosen. The ebb and flow of life eternal begins and ever is ebb and flow of life eternal begins and ever is nownow..Perhaps Set can see the future - if he chooses.

Free will, I think, can exist even if its future . Free will, I think, can exist even if its future choices are already known in the present, if one can choices are already known in the present, if one can accept the future selves. The choices of the future accept the future selves. The choices of the future selves are none but our own.selves are none but our own.In all this it seems that the greatest difficulty is In all this it seems that the greatest difficulty is the fear that such a belief will allow no choice nor the fear that such a belief will allow no choice nor exercise of will in the future. However it seems such exercise of will in the future. However it seems such a fear is due more to a lack of real self knowledge. a fear is due more to a lack of real self knowledge. We don’t think much about the past and present We don’t think much about the past and present having been determined by genetic material - even having been determined by genetic material - even down to our emotional response patterns. I suggest down to our emotional response patterns. I suggest that is so because we are familiar with the past and that is so because we are familiar with the past and present.present.We have experience in manipulating the We have experience in manipulating the “givens” of nature and nurture in the exercise of “givens” of nature and nurture in the exercise of free will. It is true that we often delude ourselves free will. It is true that we often delude ourselves into thinking that a willful act is truly willful when in into thinking that a willful act is truly willful when in fact it is an impulsive action related to genetic fact it is an impulsive action related to genetic programming. But to the aware Setian such an act programming.

But one of the first of them comes in the question. But one of the first of them comes in the form of a reformation and a maturing of existing form of a reformation and a maturing of existing Satanic rites.
