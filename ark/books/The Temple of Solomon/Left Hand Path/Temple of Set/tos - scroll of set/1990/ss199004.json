In this age to say that ideals of Romanticism. In this age to say that something is “natural” is to equate it with something is “natural” is to equate it with something “good, right, and moral” - so saith the something “good, right, and moral” - so saith the Gospel According to the Cereal Box (a Gospel According to the Cereal Box (a contemporary American icon). For the most part contemporary American icon). For the most part this emphasis on the natural has been a positive this emphasis on the natural has been a positive development, and has been used as the chief development, and has been used as the chief battering-ram against the edifices of monotheistic battering-ram against the edifices of monotheistic totalitarianism. But this can be considered only a totalitarianism. But this can be considered only a provisional weapon in the fight to return to a more provisional weapon in the fight to return to a more spiritual heritage. It seems that “Mother Nature” spiritual heritage. It seems that “Mother Nature” can be fairly easily substituted for “God the can be fairly easily substituted for “God the Father” - so easily, in fact, that we might suspect Father” - so easily, in fact, that we might suspect that “Mother Nature” is none other than “God the that “Mother Nature” is none other than “God the Father” in drag.Father” in drag.Before we go on, two important concepts must Before we go on, two important concepts must be defined and their synonyms explained. be defined and their synonyms explained.

It might be worth pointing out objective universe. It might be worth pointing out that the word that the word natur-alnatur-al is derived from the past is derived from the past participle of the Latin verb participle of the Latin verb nascinasci (to be born).

The ancient Greeks knew well the difference natural. The ancient Greeks knew well the difference between between physisphysis (nature) and (nature) and psychepsyche (spirit). Modern (spirit). Modern German academic faculties have no problem German academic faculties have no problem drawing the distinction between the Natural drawing the distinction between the Natural Sciences and the Intellectual Sciences (which we call Sciences and the Intellectual Sciences (which we call the “Humanities”).the “Humanities”).The Right-Hand Path essentially teaches that The Right-Hand Path essentially teaches that these two categories are illusions, and that in reality these two categories are illusions, and that in reality the two are identical. Its solution is to subordinate the two are identical. Its solution is to subordinate the “illusion” of self-awareness, of the psyche, to the “illusion” of self-awareness, of the psyche, to the “reality” of God, Nature, or whatever.the “reality” of God, Nature, or whatever.The Left-Hand Path solution is simpler. It The Left-Hand Path solution is simpler. It teaches that the two categories we are capable of teaches that the two categories we are capable of perceiving as being distinct are in fact just that.
