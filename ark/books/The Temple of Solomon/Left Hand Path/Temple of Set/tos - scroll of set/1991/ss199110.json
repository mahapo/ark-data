No, this is not a A School for Vampyres? No, this is not a vampyre-wannabe “how to” lecture. Nor, as vampyre-wannabe “how to” lecture. Nor, as outsiders may think, is this a set of explicit outsiders may think, is this a set of explicit instructions for sucking the blood of your enemies, instructions for sucking the blood of your enemies, disposing of the bodies, and getting away with it. In disposing of the bodies, and getting away with it. In fact, this has nothing to do with the sucking or fact, this has nothing to do with the sucking or drinking of blood at all. If what you’re looking for drinking of blood at all. If what you’re looking for is a Gothic tale of horror, blood lust, and one is a Gothic tale of horror, blood lust, and one creature cheating death by sucking the blood of creature cheating death by sucking the blood of another, you will not find it here. But then, you another, you will not find it here. But then, you might ask, what is this person, who has the audacity might ask, what is this person, who has the audacity to call himself a vampyre, talking about? Well, the to call himself a vampyre, talking about? Well, the door to my perspective is now open; enter freely and door to my perspective is now open; enter freely and of your own will.of your own will.For many years, I have thought about the For many years, I have thought about the transformative process that a warm-blooded human transformative process that a warm-blooded human would have to undergo to become a vampyre. Oh would have to undergo to become a vampyre. Oh sure, I read the fiction and saw the movies and sure, I read the fiction and saw the movies and gloried in the promise they portrayed.

These qualities are considered inherently vampyric. These qualities are generally thought of as being supernatural and are generally thought of as being supernatural and therefore beyond the reach of humanity.

Somehow the discussion turned to werewolves and Somehow the discussion turned to werewolves and animal metamorphosis. The Lady Lilith, who had animal metamorphosis. The Lady Lilith, who had orchestrated the meeting, said that Dr. Aquino could orchestrated the meeting, said that Dr. Aquino could transform himself into a werewolf.

He then altered his was he wanted to become.
