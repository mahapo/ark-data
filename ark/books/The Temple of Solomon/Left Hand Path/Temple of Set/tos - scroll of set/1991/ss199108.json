Everyone has his immense scope of the discussion. Everyone has his own theory to advance, and reasonably good points own theory to advance, and reasonably good points to back up his opinions.to back up his opinions.Within those conversations the debate of Within those conversations the debate of genetics being a factor in determining the Elect genetics being a factor in determining the Elect would invariably arise. That is to say: “Are the Elect would invariably arise. That is to say: “Are the Elect genetically predisposed to being Elect?”genetically predisposed to being Elect?”Genetics by itself will not pass muster. Setians Genetics by itself will not pass muster. Setians (who are Elect) come from too many different (who are Elect) come from too many different racial/ethnic backgrounds to allow for a genetic racial/ethnic backgrounds to allow for a genetic explanation. So then is anyone who sends in his explanation. So then is anyone who sends in his membership fee and is accepted into the I° “Elect”? membership fee and is accepted into the I° “Elect”? Obviously not.Obviously not.It seems to me that to make a workable model It seems to me that to make a workable model on which to base one’s belief, one must first get to on which to base one’s belief, one must first get to the most fundamental level of the question regarding the most fundamental level of the question regarding the Elect. This is where the Gift of Set comes into the Elect. This is where the Gift of Set comes into play.play.In this case the question implies a causal In this case the question implies a causal relationship even before one can examine the relationship even before one can examine the question of being Elect. That causal relationship question of being Elect. That causal relationship comes from the idea of the Gift being given, which comes from the idea of the Gift being given, which assumes a giver. One must have a [somewhat] clear assumes a giver. One must have a [somewhat] clear idea of who [or what] the giver is in this question, idea of who [or what] the giver is in this question, and his/its motives, if they can be ascertained at all.and his/its motives, if they can be ascertained at all.At this point one is forced to speculate on the At this point one is forced to speculate on the nature [or one’s perception of the nature] of Set. nature [or one’s perception of the nature] of Set. Not to be daunted at this point, I defined what I Not to be daunted at this point, I defined what I think Set is for the purpose of this model. think Set is for the purpose of this model. This is This is purely speculation within this model.purely speculation within this model.Set can be likened to a Set can be likened to a GestaltGestalt, an archetype of , an archetype of being which has existed for at least as long as being which has existed for at least as long as Homo SapiensHomo Sapiens began to wonder about the planet. began to wonder about the planet.Before going further I should define Before going further I should define “archetype”, because I’m probably using it in a “archetype”, because I’m probably using it in a sense contrary to the ordinary one. When I use the sense contrary to the ordinary one. When I use the term “archetype” [subject to change at any time], I term “archetype” [subject to change at any time], I mean a noncorporeal, non-local, quantum event mean a noncorporeal, non-local, quantum event generated and sustained by a means unclear to me generated and sustained by a means unclear to me by the collective consciousness of humanity by the collective consciousness of humanity (corporeal or otherwise).(corporeal or otherwise).It - the Set-archetype - is a reality which is less It - the Set-archetype - is a reality which is less like a race memory and more like Sheldrake’s like a race memory and more like Sheldrake’s morphogenetic fields. It is capable of a meta-morphogenetic fields. It is capable of a meta-intelligence which is mirrored by the DNA/RNA intelligence which is mirrored by the DNA/RNA structures’ ability to reproduce themselves. The Gift structures’ ability to reproduce themselves. The Gift of Set is the self-consciousness (i.e. capable of of Set is the self-consciousness (i.e. capable of objective thought about one’s self and one’s objective thought about one’s self and one’s surroundings) of the human race in general. The surroundings) of the human race in general. The Elect are members of the human race who are more Elect are members of the human race who are more than just self-conscious; they are aware. What than just self-conscious; they are aware. What causes this condition of one being Elect?causes this condition of one being Elect?Even in the most rudimentary forms of life on Even in the most rudimentary forms of life on Earth, the instinct to reproduce in order for the Earth, the instinct to reproduce in order for the species to survive exists. One could argue that the species to survive exists. One could argue that the whole point of life is simply to reproduce one’s whole point of life is simply to reproduce one’s kind. One can make the analogy that the kind. One can make the analogy that the “archetype” would seek to survive, to grow and “archetype” would seek to survive, to grow and “reproduce” as do other forms of life. So how “reproduce” as do other forms of life. So how might it accomplish its reproduction? I don’t know might it accomplish its reproduction? I don’t know the mechanics, but it would seem that on a very the mechanics, but it would seem that on a very discreet level, certain persons are singled out to discreet level, certain persons are singled out to “carry the seed”, to be “children of Set”.“carry the seed”, to be “children of Set”.There is a point then where the human intellect There is a point then where the human intellect can no longer grasp certain concepts clearly, where can no longer grasp certain concepts clearly, where verbalization is impossible. Is this the crossing of verbalization is impossible. Is this the crossing of the Abyss? Where the ordinary human says, “I’ll the Abyss? Where the ordinary human says, “I’ll just let go and fall back on my comfortable just let go and fall back on my comfortable paradigm, since I cannot grasp anything.”paradigm, since I cannot grasp anything.”But it is at this point, where one seems unable to But it is at this point, where one seems unable to stretch his mind any more, that Setians rise to the stretch his mind any more, that Setians rise to the top - apart from the rest because of their refusal to top - apart from the rest because of their refusal to accept that limit. Perhaps it is at that moment in accept that limit. Perhaps it is at that moment in one’s life where one dedicates oneself to that task one’s life where one dedicates oneself to that task that one becomes Elect. Perhaps the internal stresses that one becomes Elect. Perhaps the internal stresses of the process trigger a neuro-chemical change of the process trigger a neuro-chemical change within the brain. This may well be genetically within the brain. This may well be genetically encoded within humankind as a potential, but it encoded within humankind as a potential, but it can’t by itself explain why one pursues the path can’t by itself explain why one pursues the path which causes the change in the first place. Of which causes the change in the first place. Of course, just because I don’t have an answer to that course, just because I don’t have an answer to that question at present doesn’t mean I plan on giving question at present doesn’t mean I plan on giving up the search!up the search!______________________________________________________________________[2] [2] A Working in the Garden of EdenA Working in the Garden of Eden- by Rebecca Lance III°- by Rebecca Lance III°Darkness surrounds the participants as they file Darkness surrounds the participants as they file into the room, males on one side, females on the into the room, males on one side, females on the other.
