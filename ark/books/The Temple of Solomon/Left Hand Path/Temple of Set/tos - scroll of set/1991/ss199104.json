No impossible for the human mind to achieve. No matter how far-fetched an idea may seem, if we can matter how far-fetched an idea may seem, if we can conceptualize it then it is possible for it to come into conceptualize it then it is possible for it to come into being. In Colin Wilson’s being. In Colin Wilson’s The Mind ParasitesThe Mind Parasites one one passage in particular stands out: “But the spaces of passage in particular stands out: “But the spaces of the mind are a new dimension. Space extends to the mind are a new dimension. Space extends to infinity outwards, the mind stretches to infinity infinity outwards, the mind stretches to infinity inwards.” At first impression this would seem to inwards.” At first impression this would seem to refer to space refer to space per seper se, but it can also be interpreted as , but it can also be interpreted as meaning that the capabilities of the meaning that the capabilities of the evolvedevolved mind mind are limitless, bounded only by our own imagination are limitless, bounded only by our own imagination or lack of it!or lack of it!Numerous volumes have been written setting Numerous volumes have been written setting forth all manner of “mind control” exercises forth all manner of “mind control” exercises involving complicated and confusing mental involving complicated and confusing mental gymnastics.

The point is that considered as such by the Elect. The point is that only our own fears and/or lack of perception and only our own fears and/or lack of perception and imagination stand in the way of the attainment of imagination stand in the way of the attainment of our higher self and the abilities that are the our higher self and the abilities that are the manifestation of this being.

And while I’m sure that most Initiates of passage. And while I’m sure that most Initiates are familiar with this concept, I believe it a worthy are familiar with this concept, I believe it a worthy topic of further investigation within the context of topic of further investigation within the context of Initiation. Rites of passage exist in many forms Initiation. Rites of passage exist in many forms throughout all cultures, yet all employ a similar throughout all cultures, yet all employ a similar formula which, when employed with the conscious formula which, when employed with the conscious will of the black magician, can prove to be a will of the black magician, can prove to be a powerful tool of self-transformation.powerful tool of self-transformation.The Threshold DefinedThe Threshold DefinedA popular image of the rite of passage runs A popular image of the rite of passage runs something like a something like a National GeographicNational Geographic film: a group film: a group of primitive adolescent males, wearing nothing but of primitive adolescent males, wearing nothing but mud and paint, forcibly held to the ground while mud and paint, forcibly held to the ground while their foreskins are sliced off. This image is not an their foreskins are sliced off. This image is not an incorrect one. Many primitive societies engage in incorrect one. Many primitive societies engage in puberty rites involving ritual mutilation. In many of puberty rites involving ritual mutilation.

Rites of passage exist in the forms of marriage ceremonies, passage exist in the forms of marriage ceremonies, funerals, coronations, and inductions into secret funerals, coronations, and inductions into secret societies.

The question then arises: If we are so Hand Path. The question then arises: If we are so different from profane society, and if rites of different from profane society, and if rites of passage pervade what we do, then how do we passage pervade what we do, then how do we distinguish our thresholds from those belonging to distinguish our thresholds from those belonging to the rest of humanity?the rest of humanity?The difference is one of principle rather than The difference is one of principle rather than form.

We note that Set’s view of history and mankind is different from ours. By mentioning a mankind is different from ours. By mentioning a man unknown to historical records as equal of note man unknown to historical records as equal of note to the first three Magi of this century, Set breaks to the first three Magi of this century, Set breaks with the “æonic” system of Florence Farr/Aleister with the “æonic” system of Florence Farr/Aleister Crowley.

But as Set has revealed in his ancient Egypt. But as Set has revealed in his WordWord, , he no longer dwells in Egypt. This means that he no longer dwells in Egypt. This means that current use of the current use of the WordWord may be of global may be of global consequence. An examination of the changes that consequence.
