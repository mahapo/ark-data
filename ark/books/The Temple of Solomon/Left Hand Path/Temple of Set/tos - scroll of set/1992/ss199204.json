For me, meditational philosophies that background. For me, meditational philosophies that l have encountered are RHP in orientation. From the l have encountered are RHP in orientation. From the initial conception of the Black Meditation, I have initial conception of the Black Meditation, I have attempted, in my explanation of its mechanics, to attempted, in my explanation of its mechanics, to change this vision. What defines this technique as change this vision.

Therefore it is not easy. This is not mantra Therefore it is not easy. This is not mantra meditation where a meaningless word is used to meditation where a meaningless word is used to induce a euphoric state. Rather this is willful induce a euphoric state. Rather this is willful indulgence in the mind’s ability to expand to its indulgence in the mind’s ability to expand to its own evolving limits.own evolving limits.I would describe the process as such It is the I would describe the process as such It is the will that is key in the establishment of the Black will that is key in the establishment of the Black Meditative state. One should practice training the Meditative state. One should practice training the mind to break the concept that meditation is a “have mind to break the concept that meditation is a “have to” method. It is simply the focusing of awareness to” method. It is simply the focusing of awareness upon itself. This is usually done by entering the upon itself. This is usually done by entering the inner world, essentially closing one’s eyes. The inner world, essentially closing one’s eyes. The reason mantras are employed by RHP practitioners reason mantras are employed by RHP practitioners is to give the mind a focal point to “drift away” and is to give the mind a focal point to “drift away” and experience universal union. This is not the point experience universal union. This is not the point here. It has more to do with the “directed stream of here. It has more to do with the “directed stream of conscious will”.conscious will”.Every Black Meditation I do has a Every Black Meditation I do has a specific specific purposepurpose. For example, I have a Black Meditation . For example, I have a Black Meditation called the “Black Tower”. Its purpose is to charge called the “Black Tower”. Its purpose is to charge the 9 energy points of the interrelationship of my the 9 energy points of the interrelationship of my body and soul. This is an exercise in the concepts body and soul. This is an exercise in the concepts that I have assigned to the individual energy points. that I have assigned to the individual energy points.
