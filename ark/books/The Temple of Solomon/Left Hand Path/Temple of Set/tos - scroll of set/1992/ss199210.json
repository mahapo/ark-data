Ouspensky counted envy as a subspecies of one of the four main mechanical manifestations, of one of the four main mechanical manifestations, which hinder man’s possible evolution: a negative which hinder man’s possible evolution: a negative emotion. In emotion. In The Psychology of Man’s Possible The Psychology of Man’s Possible EvolutionEvolution he wrote: he wrote:The term “negative emotions” means all The term “negative emotions” means all emotions of violence or depression: self-pity, emotions of violence or depression: self-pity, anger, fear, annoyance, boredom, jealousy, anger, fear, annoyance, boredom, jealousy, and so on. Ordinarily, one accepts this and so on. Ordinarily, one accepts this expression of negative emotions as quite expression of negative emotions as quite natural and even necessary. Very often people natural and even necessary. Very often people call it “sincerity”. Of course, it has nothing to do call it “sincerity”.

It has manifested itself in with this problem. It has manifested itself in numerous situations: at first when I read other numerous situations: at first when I read other Initiates’ articles or heard someone else praised for Initiates’ articles or heard someone else praised for his work, and later it has become more and more his work, and later it has become more and more invisible - almost so subtle that I cannot even feel it invisible - almost so subtle that I cannot even feel it sometimes. But it hasn’t disappeared - and this is sometimes. But it hasn’t disappeared - and this is very important because it is the base of my thesis: very important because it is the base of my thesis: feelings like envy and jealousy cannot be completely feelings like envy and jealousy cannot be completely rooted out; they remain, but if we struggle with them rooted out; they remain, but if we struggle with them and observe their manifestations, they are refined and observe their manifestations, they are refined little by little and can be more consciously little by little and can be more consciously controlled.controlled.So my answer to the question “Should we envy So my answer to the question “Should we envy others?” is at the present: “No, but we cannot stop others?” is at the present: “No, but we cannot stop envying them before we know how this mechanism envying them before we know how this mechanism works and how we can control it.”works and how we can control it.”If you have any ideas or comments, feel free to If you have any ideas or comments, feel free to write me.

One final note, and I’m going out on a limb here: Martial arts are by nature elitist and contain here: Martial arts are by nature elitist and contain many hidden secrets [Sound familiar?]. Few people many hidden secrets [Sound familiar?]. Few people really stick with martial arts long enough to get that really stick with martial arts long enough to get that deep. This is almost inevitable, and I call it the deep. This is almost inevitable, and I call it the “Hadit rule”: if you take one finite thing or “Hadit rule”: if you take one finite thing or concept, work with it and analyze it infinitely inward, concept, work with it and analyze it infinitely inward, seeking ultimate understanding of it, you will seeking ultimate understanding of it, you will eventually pull great secrets and Understanding eventually pull great secrets and Understanding from it [although the source of such Understanding from it [although the source of such Understanding is usually the self].is usually the self].If you are interested in the martial arts, you If you are interested in the martial arts, you might question which system you would like to try might question which system you would like to try and work with.
