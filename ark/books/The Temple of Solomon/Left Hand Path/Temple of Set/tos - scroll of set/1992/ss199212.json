This gathering was one of our largest “Conclave”. This gathering was one of our largest to date, and I looked at it with the eyes of a veteran to date, and I looked at it with the eyes of a veteran of many a past one - assessing, judging, and feeling of many a past one - assessing, judging, and feeling overall a great sense of satisfaction at seeing so overall a great sense of satisfaction at seeing so many products of the Black Flame moving with skill many products of the Black Flame moving with skill and harmony through the world.and harmony through the world.American Setians hosted visitors from Canada, American Setians hosted visitors from Canada, Germany, and Finland; and the interaction of Germany, and Finland; and the interaction of cultures was fascinating to behold. All of us come cultures was fascinating to behold. All of us come from varying backgrounds, and yet we have a from varying backgrounds, and yet we have a common, uniting bond which was so self-evident to common, uniting bond which was so self-evident to ourselves and others.ourselves and others.As usual, no one slept. Wisdom intermingled As usual, no one slept. Wisdom intermingled with repartee, ritual with insight, and Setian freedom with repartee, ritual with insight, and Setian freedom with acknowledgement of our allegiance to That with acknowledgement of our allegiance to That which is Set.which is Set.We overran Salem and Danvers, saw the history We overran Salem and Danvers, saw the history of Boston, and some of us even braved the Combat of Boston, and some of us even braved the Combat Zone. Power shoppers shopped, and few people at Zone. Power shoppers shopped, and few people at the hotel looked twice at the black-garbed guests the hotel looked twice at the black-garbed guests enjoying the season of the year, although one small enjoying the season of the year, although one small group on an elevator assumed I was with the hotel group on an elevator assumed I was with the hotel and asked me about the people wearing the upside-and asked me about the people wearing the upside-down stars. I replied they were the Temple of Set down stars. I replied they were the Temple of Set and that we were thoroughly enjoying having them and that we were thoroughly enjoying having them with us!with us!Our meetings were beyond the norm with those Our meetings were beyond the norm with those in attendance drinking in the stellar essences in attendance drinking in the stellar essences abounding. Here were ample opportunities to abounding. Here were ample opportunities to engage in dialogue with any number of Initiates, and engage in dialogue with any number of Initiates, and small groups predominated between the major small groups predominated between the major meetings. The subjects ranged from Altair to meetings. The subjects ranged from Altair to XemXem, , with all points between being covered. Senior with all points between being covered. Senior Initiates found themselves faced with minds sharper Initiates found themselves faced with minds sharper than razors, and the combined dialogues than razors, and the combined dialogues Remanifested into new and different shapes as more Remanifested into new and different shapes as more recently-affiliated members often found themselves recently-affiliated members often found themselves with more troves of magical knowledge than might with more troves of magical knowledge than might have been expected.have been expected.As I remarked in the As I remarked in the Trail of the SerpentTrail of the Serpent, we , we missed the company of the High Priest, who missed the company of the High Priest, who unfortunately could not attend due to pressing unfortunately could not attend due to pressing business. We owe a number of people a debt of business. We owe a number of people a debt of gratitude, among them Magistra Lilith Aquino, gratitude, among them Magistra Lilith Aquino, without whose tireless work our Conclaves would without whose tireless work our Conclaves would not be the successes they are. Many hands went into not be the successes they are. Many hands went into making Set-XIII what it was, and for better or for making Set-XIII what it was, and for better or for worse we left Massachusetts as changed people.worse we left Massachusetts as changed people.The Recognition of a Master of the Temple is an The Recognition of a Master of the Temple is an unusual event at any time, but Set-XIII attendees unusual event at any time, but Set-XIII attendees saw the Recognition of three: Patty Hardy, William saw the Recognition of three: Patty Hardy, William Butch, and Dennis Mann. Having personally known Butch, and Dennis Mann. Having personally known these Initiates since their I° days, it was a double these Initiates since their I° days, it was a double pleasure for me to see their pleasure for me to see their XeperXeper and then to act in and then to act in the High Priest’s place and perform the ceremonial the High Priest’s place and perform the ceremonial IV° ordinations.IV° ordinations.New Masters bring fresh Understandings into New Masters bring fresh Understandings into the City of the Pyramids, and from there these the City of the Pyramids, and from there these radiate to the world. It is reassuring to see the radiate to the world. It is reassuring to see the quality of Initiatory work coming forth from that quality of Initiatory work coming forth from that City to ensure the continuance of the Temple and City to ensure the continuance of the Temple and the Æon.the Æon.Set-XIlI also saw two ceremonial Recognitions Set-XIlI also saw two ceremonial Recognitions of new Priests of Set, William Van Patten and Paul of new Priests of Set, William Van Patten and Paul McAtee. Like the Recognition of Masters, the McAtee. Like the Recognition of Masters, the ordination of Priests is an Æon-changing event in ordination of Priests is an Æon-changing event in that the III° is a crucial one in the functioning of the that the III° is a crucial one in the functioning of the Temple.Temple.Our new Priests start out on paths which they Our new Priests start out on paths which they themselves must blaze through the cosmos. They themselves must blaze through the cosmos. They will see their peers also forging trails, but can never will see their peers also forging trails, but can never be other than parallel to them due to the singularity be other than parallel to them due to the singularity of souls working in concert toward our goal. It is of souls working in concert toward our goal. It is noteworthy, as the Recognition announcement noteworthy, as the Recognition announcement elsewhere in the elsewhere in the ScrollScroll points out, that Priests points out, that Priests McAtee and Van Patten are our first new III°s McAtee and Van Patten are our first new III°s ordained under the Temple’s recently revised By-ordained under the Temple’s recently revised By-Laws, with each being assessed by two other Laws, with each being assessed by two other Masters of the Temple.Masters of the Temple.It is easy enough to discuss specific events It is easy enough to discuss specific events which took place at Conclave, but to encapsulate the which took place at Conclave, but to encapsulate the entire event in a few words is impossible for entire event in a few words is impossible for anyone. Those who were there will understand the anyone. Those who were there will understand the difficulty well. To those of you who were not, join difficulty well.

This element within the Temple of Set Drosophila. This is a project consisting of a network of Black is a project consisting of a network of Black Magicians dedicated to the alchemical inquiry into Magicians dedicated to the alchemical inquiry into human evolution. Within this project, human human evolution. Within this project, human evolution will be the subject, object, and purpose of evolution will be the subject, object, and purpose of investigation.

He could even state his relation to a a Christian. He could even state his relation to a previous states of being by saying, “I have previous states of being by saying, “I have advanced,” or “I am advancing.” The danger lies advanced,” or “I am advancing.” The danger lies when he uses a statement of relative comparison like when he uses a statement of relative comparison like “I am advanced” in absolute terms. When this “I am advanced” in absolute terms. When this happens, the entire process of Becoming is given a happens, the entire process of Becoming is given a beginning and an end. Furthermore, not only does beginning and an end.
