In other words, as a principle is recognized, it can transform words, as a principle is recognized, it can transform by revealing to the individual knowledge that carries by revealing to the individual knowledge that carries the potential of self transformation.the potential of self transformation.However the principle However the principle itselfitself does not change, it does not change, it remains stable and consistent. For example, the remains stable and consistent. For example, the principle of isolate intelligence is the First Principle principle of isolate intelligence is the First Principle of self consciousness. From this principle the of self consciousness. From this principle the knowledge of self being is extended. Once knowledge of self being is extended.
