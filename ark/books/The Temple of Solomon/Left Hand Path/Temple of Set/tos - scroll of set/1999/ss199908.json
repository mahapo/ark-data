Or one Does the Setian also seek some end? Or one might ask, “Where does might ask, “Where does XeperXeper lead?” lead?”XeperXeper is indeed an ongoing process as we is indeed an ongoing process as we understand it. Even if there is some future point at understand it. Even if there is some future point at which one may be unable to “which one may be unable to “XeperXeper any further”, any further”, we tend to find it better for the question at hand to we tend to find it better for the question at hand to work under the presumption that there is no such work under the presumption that there is no such point.point.If one decides there is such a point, the next step If one decides there is such a point, the next step is of course deciding you have achieved it, followed is of course deciding you have achieved it, followed quickly by the realization that efforts are no longer quickly by the realization that efforts are no longer necessary.

Indeed when one considers with the Magus himself. Indeed when one considers what is known about both the time period in which what is known about both the time period in which he lived and also what is known about him from he lived and also what is known about him from non-biblical sources, a very different picture of the non-biblical sources, a very different picture of the magician known as Jesus emerges.magician known as Jesus emerges.First and foremost, he would have never have First and foremost, he would have never have called himself “Jesus”, which is the Greek version called himself “Jesus”, which is the Greek version of the Hebrew of the Hebrew JeshuaJeshua, which translates into English , which translates into English as “Joshua”. While it seems to be popular now as “Joshua”. While it seems to be popular now amongst Christian New-Agers [Is that a term to amongst Christian New-Agers [Is that a term to make you cringe or what?] to claim that he traveled make you cringe or what?] to claim that he traveled everywhere from Arthurian England to the outer everywhere from Arthurian England to the outer rings of Saturn, there is not a single shred of rings of Saturn, there is not a single shred of evidence to show that he ever left Palestine. While it evidence to show that he ever left Palestine. While it may have been possible that he would have met may have been possible that he would have met somebody speaking Greek, he certainly would not somebody speaking Greek, he certainly would not have called himself by the Greek form of his name.have called himself by the Greek form of his name.This may seem like a trifling point, but I bring it This may seem like a trifling point, but I bring it up to show an example of how absolutely ignorant up to show an example of how absolutely ignorant of any historical facts present day Christians are.of any historical facts present day Christians are.I am going to endeavor to stick to just these I am going to endeavor to stick to just these historical facts, as well as to offer my interpretation historical facts, as well as to offer my interpretation of them. I will avoid trying to tie Jesus into any of them. I will avoid trying to tie Jesus into any occult paradigms, whether LHP or RHP, as this occult paradigms, whether LHP or RHP, as this avenue has already been explored very eloquently in avenue has already been explored very eloquently in Magus Flowers’ Magus Flowers’ Lords of the Left Hand PathLords of the Left Hand Path..What I am going to attempt is to show that the What I am going to attempt is to show that the overwhelming evidence points to the conclusion that overwhelming evidence points to the conclusion that Jesus was a local Galilean prophet like so many Jesus was a local Galilean prophet like so many others of his time, and that he was not the gentle others of his time, and that he was not the gentle “Prince of Peace” as he has been represented.“Prince of Peace” as he has been represented.The first thing that needs to be considered is that The first thing that needs to be considered is that for which Jesus is best known - his death. More for which Jesus is best known - his death. More specifically, I am referring to the fact that he was specifically, I am referring to the fact that he was crucified. Crucifixion was at that time a specific crucified. Crucifixion was at that time a specific punishment for a specific crime, and that crime was punishment for a specific crime, and that crime was treason against Rome. The Jewish leaders of the treason against Rome. The Jewish leaders of the time did not have the authority to crucify anyone for time did not have the authority to crucify anyone for any reason, and the Roman overlords would not any reason, and the Roman overlords would not have given a damn that Jesus was blaspheming have given a damn that Jesus was blaspheming against the Hebrew god.against the Hebrew god.The account of his trial that shows Pontius The account of his trial that shows Pontius Pilate believing him innocent but being pressured to Pilate believing him innocent but being pressured to condemn him is both illogical and without factual condemn him is both illogical and without factual basis. There are a considerable number of historical basis. There are a considerable number of historical sources that show Pilate to be ruthless in his sources that show Pilate to be ruthless in his governorship over the Jews. He was, to put it quite governorship over the Jews. He was, to put it quite plainly, an asskicker! It is highly unlikely that he plainly, an asskicker! It is highly unlikely that he would have been convinced to sentence Jesus to would have been convinced to sentence Jesus to death if he did not believe him to be guilty.death if he did not believe him to be guilty.Also the story of Pilate releasing Barabbas Also the story of Pilate releasing Barabbas instead of Jesus is also unrealistic. There is no instead of Jesus is also unrealistic. There is no mention anywhere except in the Old Testament of mention anywhere except in the Old Testament of releasing one Jewish prisoner during Passover, and releasing one Jewish prisoner during Passover, and the notion that Rome would have followed such a the notion that Rome would have followed such a practice in the most rebellious province in the practice in the most rebellious province in the Empire is absurd. Imagine the British releasing an Empire is absurd. Imagine the British releasing an IRA terrorist on St. Patrick’s Day as a gesture of IRA terrorist on St. Patrick’s Day as a gesture of good will, or the Israeli government releasing an good will, or the Israeli government releasing an Arab prisoner on Ramadan.Arab prisoner on Ramadan.Pilate in the “Gospels” is presented not only as Pilate in the “Gospels” is presented not only as being weak-willed, but also enormously stupid. To being weak-willed, but also enormously stupid. To give the people a choice between Jesus and give the people a choice between Jesus and Barabbas with the intention of saving Jesus is the Barabbas with the intention of saving Jesus is the act of an imbecile. Given the political climate of the act of an imbecile. Given the political climate of the time (which I will get to later), the Jews would have time (which I will get to later), the Jews would have clearly preferred to free a Jewish nationalist rather clearly preferred to free a Jewish nationalist rather than a man who the “Gospels” claim said “Love than a man who the “Gospels” claim said “Love the Romans ...” and “Render unto Caesar the the Romans ...” and “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s ...”.things that are Caesar’s ...”.If for some reason Pilate did act as they claim he If for some reason Pilate did act as they claim he did, he would have certainly had to answer to his did, he would have certainly had to answer to his superiors. If Jesus were preaching a philosophy of superiors. If Jesus were preaching a philosophy of peace towards the Romans while Barabbas was peace towards the Romans while Barabbas was killing Roman soldiers, Pilate would have put killing Roman soldiers, Pilate would have put himself in grave danger by releasing Barabbas and himself in grave danger by releasing Barabbas and executing Jesus. More than likely, he would himself executing Jesus. More than likely, he would himself have been convicted of treason and crucified!have been convicted of treason and crucified!So what can be taken from this is that Jesus was So what can be taken from this is that Jesus was a political prisoner, not a religious one. More a political prisoner, not a religious one. More specifically Jesus was seen as enough of a threat to specifically Jesus was seen as enough of a threat to Roman rule for him to be condemned for treason.Roman rule for him to be condemned for treason.When I mentioned above the climate in which When I mentioned above the climate in which Jesus lived, what I was referring to is [although you Jesus lived, what I was referring to is [although you would never know from reading the “Gospels”] would never know from reading the “Gospels”] that Jesus grew up in the midst of perhaps the that Jesus grew up in the midst of perhaps the fiercest guerrilla uprisings in history.

It has a great many variables, which will empirically. It has a great many variables, which will cause differing placebo reactivity in different people.cause differing placebo reactivity in different people.For some people an inert hypodermic injection For some people an inert hypodermic injection in the arm will cause greater anticipation of results in the arm will cause greater anticipation of results than swallowing a pill. Likewise a treatment given in than swallowing a pill. Likewise a treatment given in the cold, stainless steel environment of a hospital the cold, stainless steel environment of a hospital will evoke for some people a stronger anticipation of will evoke for some people a stronger anticipation of positive results, than simply buying a bottle of pills positive results, than simply buying a bottle of pills at the local drug store and taking a couple while in at the local drug store and taking a couple while in the home environment.the home environment.The anticipation of positive results, is important The anticipation of positive results, is important both to the person receiving the treatment (the both to the person receiving the treatment (the recipient), and on the part of the person prescribing recipient), and on the part of the person prescribing the treatment (the practitioner). How they both view the treatment (the practitioner). How they both view the efficacy of the treatment is important. This is the efficacy of the treatment is important. This is obvious from the way we study placebos and see an obvious from the way we study placebos and see an increase in the effectiveness of placebo treatments increase in the effectiveness of placebo treatments rise as more parties are unaware of the inert nature rise as more parties are unaware of the inert nature of the treatment, or more properly stated, the of the treatment, or more properly stated, the recipient has his expectation of positive results recipient has his expectation of positive results unconfirmed or denied by the practitioner’s actions unconfirmed or denied by the practitioner’s actions and attitudes.and attitudes.If a recipient takes a sugar pill from a doctor If a recipient takes a sugar pill from a doctor who gives it to him announcing (by word or subtle who gives it to him announcing (by word or subtle actions) that the inert substance will not have any actions) that the inert substance will not have any effects, it frequently will not.effects, it frequently will not.However as the recipient builds expectation by However as the recipient builds expectation by believing that the sugar pill is actually powerful believing that the sugar pill is actually powerful medicine containing active ingredients, incidents of medicine containing active ingredients, incidents of placebo reactivity begin to increase and reach an all placebo reactivity begin to increase and reach an all time high when both the recipient holds strong time high when both the recipient holds strong belief in the treatment, and has this belief reinforced belief in the treatment, and has this belief reinforced in particular by the interactions with a practitioner in particular by the interactions with a practitioner who equally has expectation of positive results. who equally has expectation of positive results. “Probably the most important factors are those “Probably the most important factors are those which relate to specific attitudes toward the illness, which relate to specific attitudes toward the illness, medication, and physician.”medication, and physician.”22(2) Spontaneous Change(2) Spontaneous ChangeThis is where we see the power of suggestion This is where we see the power of suggestion manifesting itself in the form of ascribing anything manifesting itself in the form of ascribing anything remotely out of the ordinary to the treatment of the remotely out of the ordinary to the treatment of the placebo.placebo.After having a treatment prescribed, the recipient After having a treatment prescribed, the recipient will of course be looking very intensely at anything will of course be looking very intensely at anything which could be a result of the treatment.
