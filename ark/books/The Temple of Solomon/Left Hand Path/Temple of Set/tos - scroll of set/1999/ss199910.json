Such scholars as Otto, Eliade, academic history. Such scholars as Otto, Eliade, James, Durkheim, Douglas, and Söderblom seem to James, Durkheim, Douglas, and Söderblom seem to have something substantially in common in the have something substantially in common in the focus of their work, but still their definitions of focus of their work, but still their definitions of “religion” vary considerably.“religion” vary considerably.Etymologically in Roman Catholicism the word Etymologically in Roman Catholicism the word “religion” is derived from the Latin word “religion” is derived from the Latin word religioreligio..In other Indo-European languages there was no In other Indo-European languages there was no word to signify “religion” before Christianity’s word to signify “religion” before Christianity’s influence. The same can be said about Finno-Ugrian influence. The same can be said about Finno-Ugrian languages. Thus the word/concept of “religion” languages. Thus the word/concept of “religion” has a very limited cultural sphere of etymological has a very limited cultural sphere of etymological and contextual origin, which creates certain and contextual origin, which creates certain difficulties in attempting to apply it to other cultures difficulties in attempting to apply it to other cultures and their “religious” aspects.and their “religious” aspects.There are two different etymological views There are two different etymological views concerning the word concerning the word religioreligio. Some scholars of . Some scholars of Indo-European languages have suggested, based on Indo-European languages have suggested, based on Cicero’s work Cicero’s work De Natura DeorumDe Natura Deorum, that the word , that the word derives from verb derives from verb legerelegere, which means “to collect”. , which means “to collect”. According to that view, According to that view, religioreligio means actions that means actions that are used to re-collect (re-are used to re-collect (re-legerelegere) everything that is ) everything that is needed in order to worship gods.needed in order to worship gods.On the other hand Christian author Lactantius On the other hand Christian author Lactantius proposed the verb proposed the verb ligareligare, which means “to bind”. , which means “to bind”. He thought that He thought that religioreligio means a “bond” which re- means a “bond” which re-binds (re-binds (re-ligareligare) people to divinity.) people to divinity.The ways in which the word The ways in which the word religioreligio has been has been used from classical antiquity through today are used from classical antiquity through today are complex and contradictory. Meanings of the word complex and contradictory. Meanings of the word religioreligio have varied in the course of history have varied in the course of history according to several contexts in which the word has according to several contexts in which the word has been used.been used.Historically it is noteworthy that the concept of Historically it is noteworthy that the concept of “religion”, in the sense we generally understand it “religion”, in the sense we generally understand it today, didn’t exist before the 18th century C.E. today, didn’t exist before the 18th century C.E. There were, of course, “religions” throughout the There were, of course, “religions” throughout the world before the 18th century C.E., but the way they world before the 18th century C.E., but the way they were approached was very different from the way were approached was very different from the way we in the Western world are accustomed to thinking we in the Western world are accustomed to thinking about “religions” in our 20th century C.E.about “religions” in our 20th century C.E.The concept of “religion” was formed in 18th The concept of “religion” was formed in 18th century C.E. as a part of great social and century C.E. as a part of great social and epistemological changes in European culture. epistemological changes in European culture. Previously humankind didn’t have in its cultures Previously humankind didn’t have in its cultures and languages a special category of “religion” - a and languages a special category of “religion” - a category that could be conceptually separated from category that could be conceptually separated from the rest of the culture and considered from a the rest of the culture and considered from a comparative, scientific, non-religious perspective.comparative, scientific, non-religious perspective.From this perspective the category of From this perspective the category of “religion” is a result of development of a language. “religion” is a result of development of a language. The “birth” of that category came from a social and The “birth” of that category came from a social and cultural need to create a general concept to describe cultural need to create a general concept to describe and to differentiate Christian and non-Christian and to differentiate Christian and non-Christian traditions, practices, and experiences of a traditions, practices, and experiences of a “religious” nature.“religious” nature.Thus “religion” is a concept that is bound to a Thus “religion” is a concept that is bound to a general Western cultural system of categories of general Western cultural system of categories of existence. This culturally-bound system is the existence. This culturally-bound system is the conceptual base still used to categorize things like conceptual base still used to categorize things like “new religious movements”.“new religious movements”.This cultural background is good to remember This cultural background is good to remember when we consider what generally is thought to be when we consider what generally is thought to be “religious” in the Western world, and to what “religious” in the Western world, and to what cultural fabric that word is historically bound.cultural fabric that word is historically bound.There are several definitions of “religion” There are several definitions of “religion” offered by scholars of comparative religious studies. offered by scholars of comparative religious studies.

The selfishness of this benefit the church as well. The selfishness of this action is apparent, as that many English will die in action is apparent, as that many English will die in battle by invading France.

Keep in mind that that religioreligio means “to bind.” Machiavelli states, means “to bind.” Machiavelli states, “There is nothing which destroys itself so much as “There is nothing which destroys itself so much as liberality, for by using it you lose the power of liberality, for by using it you lose the power of using it ...

However it has for Setian religious development. However it has long rested between two great reservoirs of Setian long rested between two great reservoirs of Setian magic: San Francisco and Los Angeles; thus it is magic: San Francisco and Los Angeles; thus it is part of the magical delta through which Setian magic part of the magical delta through which Setian magic flows into the world at large, just as the Nile Delta flows into the world at large, just as the Nile Delta carries the great Nile River into the world-covering carries the great Nile River into the world-covering oceans.oceans.Therefore it is apparent that the Central Valley Therefore it is apparent that the Central Valley of California is fertile soil for Setian philosophy. It of California is fertile soil for Setian philosophy. It promises growth and development if the seed is promises growth and development if the seed is planted and the crop cared for. Thus it is due time planted and the crop cared for. Thus it is due time for a Setian Pylon to open in the Central Valley area, for a Setian Pylon to open in the Central Valley area, as the seeds have been planted and there is now a as the seeds have been planted and there is now a small Setian community in the area.small Setian community in the area.Thus I, SeshXemSet, as Warlord of Thus I, SeshXemSet, as Warlord of XemXem, the , the Black Soil, have constructed such a Pylon which Black Soil, have constructed such a Pylon which will act as a gateway through which the currents of will act as a gateway through which the currents of the Æon of Set shall water the fertile Central Valley the Æon of Set shall water the fertile Central Valley and through which those few from there who are and through which those few from there who are Elect shall enter into the Temple of Set to Elect shall enter into the Temple of Set to XeperXeper and and Remanifest.Remanifest.San Francisco was the location of the entry of San Francisco was the location of the entry of the Æon of Set into the world.
