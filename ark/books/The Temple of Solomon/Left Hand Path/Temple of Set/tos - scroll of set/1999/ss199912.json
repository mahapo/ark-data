All humans is the “false goal”. All humans (and of course this includes all Setians) will (and of course this includes all Setians) will occasionally pick up a “false goal”.occasionally pick up a “false goal”.A “false goal” is a goal that is really A “false goal” is a goal that is really notnot your your own. It may be inherited from your parents or your own. It may be inherited from your parents or your peer group, or be a very badly thought-out version peer group, or be a very badly thought-out version of your own of your own realreal goal. goal.An example of a “false goal”: Someone An example of a “false goal”: Someone decides that when he is 10 he will go to New York decides that when he is 10 he will go to New York to be an actor, because he has seen a movie about to be an actor, because he has seen a movie about someone with that goal. He works his rear end off someone with that goal. He works his rear end off to go to the Big Apple, and then either fails and is to go to the Big Apple, and then either fails and is eaten away by the sense of worthlessness, or eaten away by the sense of worthlessness, or succeeds, and can’t understand why he has no succeeds, and can’t understand why he has no energy for his life, and must take massive doses of energy for his life, and must take massive doses of anti-depressants and drink a gallon of coffee each anti-depressants and drink a gallon of coffee each day.day.Concerning Horus and SetConcerning Horus and SetA good deal of ink is spilt in the Temple about A good deal of ink is spilt in the Temple about the figures of Horus and Set, since Set said of the figures of Horus and Set, since Set said of Horus that he was the only god created by Set, and Horus that he was the only god created by Set, and that all others were the creations of mankind.that all others were the creations of mankind.Horus seems very mysterious to most people, Horus seems very mysterious to most people, but in fact each one of them has, just like Set, but in fact each one of them has, just like Set, created a “Horus” whom we find “strange and created a “Horus” whom we find “strange and fitful”.fitful”.“Where is this Horus, and when did I make “Where is this Horus, and when did I make him?”him?”You probably made him when you were about 5 You probably made him when you were about 5 and had him finished by the time you were 10.and had him finished by the time you were 10.Each of us treats our “self” as a separate object Each of us treats our “self” as a separate object toward which we have feelings. We act and think as toward which we have feelings. We act and think as though our social/objective world interface is though our social/objective world interface is separate from us and we can have feelings toward it.separate from us and we can have feelings toward it.For example we can love ourselves, hate For example we can love ourselves, hate ourselves, “master” ourselves and so forth.ourselves, “master” ourselves and so forth.We become frustrated when our socially-created We become frustrated when our socially-created self screws up. For example, let’s say that you had a self screws up. For example, let’s say that you had a fight with your best friend. You call her up fight with your best friend. You call her up intending to apologize and wind up actually making intending to apologize and wind up actually making the fight worse. You’re mad at your friend, but a the fight worse. You’re mad at your friend, but a thousand times madder at your “self”.thousand times madder at your “self”.This social creation, this self that acts with other This social creation, this self that acts with other people, is the “Horus” part of your “Set-Horus people, is the “Horus” part of your “Set-Horus combination”.combination”.Like the ancient Egyptian magician who claimed Like the ancient Egyptian magician who claimed that knowing the secret of the Two Partners, was the that knowing the secret of the Two Partners, was the basis of power, you can achieve all things you desire basis of power, you can achieve all things you desire in the world if harmony exists between the outer in the world if harmony exists between the outer social creation and inner real (eternal) you.social creation and inner real (eternal) you.Creating such harmony is not easy. The Creating such harmony is not easy. The Egyptians did, after all, see both Horus and Set as Egyptians did, after all, see both Horus and Set as war gods. That one ruled night and the other day war gods. That one ruled night and the other day made it hard for them to get together. However there made it hard for them to get together. However there are times when night and day are times when night and day dodo get together - such get together - such as dawn, which was symbolized by the as dawn, which was symbolized by the XeperaXepera beetle. In fact the hour of dawn is symbolized in beetle. In fact the hour of dawn is symbolized in some Egyptian after-life books as a god with two some Egyptian after-life books as a god with two heads, that of Set and Horus.heads, that of Set and Horus.For the “Set” part of your For the “Set” part of your psychepsyche to accept the to accept the “Horus” part, it must come to realize that without “Horus” part, it must come to realize that without the “Horus” part to the “Horus” part to interactinteract with the objective with the objective universe, it would universe, it would mergemerge with the universe. with the universe.Our sense of friction with the universe - all the Our sense of friction with the universe - all the interplay of the truth and fiction, the unexpected and interplay of the truth and fiction, the unexpected and the need to experiment - comes from the inability of the need to experiment - comes from the inability of the “Horus” part to simply carry out our wishes.the “Horus” part to simply carry out our wishes.The “Set” part of our The “Set” part of our psychepsyche must revel in the must revel in the Universe’s unexpected twists and turns.

Most have had Being”, is well-known to Setians. Most have had that peculiar ecstasy we call the “sense of self” that peculiar ecstasy we call the “sense of self” when they see the pattern of their life reflecting when they see the pattern of their life reflecting some aspect of their secret, dark souls.some aspect of their secret, dark souls.XeperXeper is a pattern recognition process, whereby is a pattern recognition process, whereby one sees one’s own wake in the oceans of the one sees one’s own wake in the oceans of the objective and subjective universes.objective and subjective universes.XeperXeper is a knowledge of self reflected back to is a knowledge of self reflected back to you by the many aspects of your life.
