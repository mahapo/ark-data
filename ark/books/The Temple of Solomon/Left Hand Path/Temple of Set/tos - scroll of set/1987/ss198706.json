We know it isn’t of Set know that Set is real? We know it isn’t “faith”, since the Temple subscribes to the use of “faith”, since the Temple subscribes to the use of reason to at least weed out untrue ideas. Our reason to at least weed out untrue ideas. Our question, more precisely, is whether the reality of question, more precisely, is whether the reality of Set is a Set is a beliefbelief or or knowledgeknowledge supported by supported by experience.experience.We understand that intuition is involved here, We understand that intuition is involved here, but what leads the Priesthood to assume that this but what leads the Priesthood to assume that this intuition is correct? We can understand how we can intuition is correct? We can understand how we can propose the existence of an alien intervention propose the existence of an alien intervention creating intelligence in early man. That is a belief creating intelligence in early man. That is a belief which has no evidence to deny it and some evidence which has no evidence to deny it and some evidence to support it. If intuition supported this belief, it still to support it. If intuition supported this belief, it still would not be knowledge. [Almost the same steps would not be knowledge.

Hypnosis, like intuition, can be used to work. Hypnosis, like intuition, can be used to re/uncover useful experiences [like the memory of a re/uncover useful experiences [like the memory of a license plate]. Then reason can assess this license plate]. Then reason can assess this “experience” and determine the extent to which it is “experience” and determine the extent to which it is valid.
