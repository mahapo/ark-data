It acts in the form of a noun as a Word gathered. It acts in the form of a noun as a Word and a verb in that it is an action brought about and a verb in that it is an action brought about through willed behavior. Note that carefully: It is a through willed behavior. Note that carefully: It is a deliberate act on the part of the Initiate and as such deliberate act on the part of the Initiate and as such is an act of Black Magic.is an act of Black Magic.To better understand that it might be helpful to To better understand that it might be helpful to take a look at how those Words from take a look at how those Words from ThelemaThelema to to XeperXeper are also deliberate choices. are also deliberate choices.ThelemaThelema [in the Æon of HarWer] was defined [in the Æon of HarWer] was defined as “will”, the shining and separate quality held by as “will”, the shining and separate quality held by each rational and intelligent being. “Will” might be each rational and intelligent being. “Will” might be made clearer if it is thought of as that which makes made clearer if it is thought of as that which makes each of us the captain of his on ship, charting and each of us the captain of his on ship, charting and deciding his own course through that phenomenon deciding his own course through that phenomenon known as life. Those major changes which take known as life. Those major changes which take place in our lives are the result of two main place in our lives are the result of two main influences - accident or will.influences - accident or will.It is also rather interesting to note that in a It is also rather interesting to note that in a qualified sense qualified sense ThelemaThelema is predestination: Those is predestination: Those actions which are deliberately done form the actions which are deliberately done form the framework for the future. However the generally-framework for the future. However the generally-accepted meaning of predestination is so much accepted meaning of predestination is so much bunk. [If it isn’t, what’s the use of striving in the bunk.

A person will perform acts that will other Words. A person will perform acts that will form his future in any event. It is the magician who form his future in any event. It is the magician who analyzes and deliberately chooses to make Word-analyzes and deliberately chooses to make Word-use of use of ThelemaThelema in order to attain desired states of in order to attain desired states of being.being.“Indulgence” [in the Age of Satan] was another “Indulgence” [in the Age of Satan] was another act of operation in defiance of the natural order of act of operation in defiance of the natural order of things. The Age of Satan exorcised the old Christian things. The Age of Satan exorcised the old Christian and traditional specters by saying “My will, not and traditional specters by saying “My will, not thine, be done!” It was an age of refinement in thine, be done!” It was an age of refinement in which the Satanist gained through will the finer which the Satanist gained through will the finer things of life, both intellectual and material.

The heart of that was turning the self toward the higher heart of that was turning the self toward the higher and better, toward that which was greater than the and better, toward that which was greater than the lowest-common-denominator flow of events which lowest-common-denominator flow of events which would normally take place.would normally take place.“Indulgence” can also be a non-Word. The “Indulgence” can also be a non-Word. The standard definition of the word is the ratification of standard definition of the word is the ratification of desire; if it is satisfied in simple, base ways, desire; if it is satisfied in simple, base ways, indulgence becomes a simple and natural act, such indulgence becomes a simple and natural act, such as the desire to eat, sleep, seek companionship, and a as the desire to eat, sleep, seek companionship, and a hundred other natural desires. If, on the other hand, hundred other natural desires. If, on the other hand, it is reoriented in the direction of that highest and it is reoriented in the direction of that highest and best which is ever before us - or that which could best which is ever before us - or that which could perhaps be spoken of as the search for purity - it perhaps be spoken of as the search for purity - it then becomes a tool which helps the individual reach then becomes a tool which helps the individual reach higher, and falls under the category of Black Magic.higher, and falls under the category of Black Magic.XeperXeper, the primary Word of the Æon of Set, is , the primary Word of the Æon of Set, is another noun/verb word.

Coming into Being is not properly a one-evolving. Coming into Being is not properly a one-tine experience. Rather it is an ongoing process in tine experience. Rather it is an ongoing process in which the factors involved in taking the Initiate to a which the factors involved in taking the Initiate to a certain point in space and time bind together and certain point in space and time bind together and produce a being who has at his disposal all the produce a being who has at his disposal all the experience, power, and wisdom which have gone experience, power, and wisdom which have gone into forming a being operating at a far higher level into forming a being operating at a far higher level than originally.than originally.All of us come to be something sooner or later, All of us come to be something sooner or later, whether it be a being searching for the knowledge of whether it be a being searching for the knowledge of Set or one earnestly working toward permanent Set or one earnestly working toward permanent couch-potato status; the latter is hardly Black couch-potato status; the latter is hardly Black Magic.

One is æonic in nature and are two kinds of Words. One is æonic in nature and institutes a new æon. The other is that which institutes a new æon. The other is that which enhances the primary Word of the æon. It would be enhances the primary Word of the æon. It would be a mistake to think of the second kind of Word as a mistake to think of the second kind of Word as being lesser than its primary companion, since each being lesser than its primary companion, since each Word stands on its own merits and has certain Word stands on its own merits and has certain integral truths to reveal.integral truths to reveal.When Remanifestation first came to be, it was When Remanifestation first came to be, it was aimed primarily in the direction finding a way out of aimed primarily in the direction finding a way out of the confused maze generated by reincarnation the confused maze generated by reincarnation theories.
