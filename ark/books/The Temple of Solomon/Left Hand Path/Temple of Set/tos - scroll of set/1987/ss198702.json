We will mainly be concerned with the original We will mainly be concerned with the original meaning of the name, which was apparently first meaning of the name, which was apparently first used in connection with the Knights Templar in the used in connection with the Knights Templar in the Middle Ages, and not with the larger principle for Middle Ages, and not with the larger principle for which the name may stand.which the name may stand.Some matters connected with this question are Some matters connected with this question are discussed in a discussed in a Cloven HoofCloven Hoof article (#III-11, article (#III-11, November VI/1971) by then-Priest Michael A. November VI/1971) by then-Priest Michael A. Aquino. This article is printed with additional Aquino. This article is printed with additional commentary in his commentary in his Church of SatanChurch of Satan (App. #28). (App. #28).The principal source of my information for this The principal source of my information for this article is Karl Frick, article is Karl Frick, Die ErleuchtetenDie Erleuchteten (The (The Illuminated Ones), which is a detailed history of Illuminated Ones), which is a detailed history of “Gnostic-theosophical and alchemistic-Rosicrucian “Gnostic-theosophical and alchemistic-Rosicrucian secret societies to the end of the 18th century”.secret societies to the end of the 18th century”.As is fairly well known, the name “Baphomet” As is fairly well known, the name “Baphomet” comes into history as the name of an “idol” comes into history as the name of an “idol” supposedly used by the Knights Templar in secret supposedly used by the Knights Templar in secret cult practices. These practices, which were largely cult practices. These practices, which were largely reported by Templars while under torture, may be reported by Templars while under torture, may be reviewed in any of a number of books (e.g. #3E, reviewed in any of a number of books (e.g. #3E, #3F, and #30) on the Temple’s Reading List.#3F, and #30) on the Temple’s Reading List.Generally the Templars were said to have Generally the Templars were said to have conducted blasphemous sexual rites in which the conducted blasphemous sexual rites in which the symbols of the Church were mocked, inverted, and symbols of the Church were mocked, inverted, and desecrated - pretty usual clerical projections of the desecrated - pretty usual clerical projections of the time (i.e. early 14th century). At one point in the time (i.e. early 14th century).

On one side of the tablet taken from inside the altar. On one side of the tablet there was apparently some type of figure. Because there was apparently some type of figure. Because this particular feature does not fit with the usual this particular feature does not fit with the usual “idol fixation” of the Inquisitors, it has, in my “idol fixation” of the Inquisitors, it has, in my opinion, a higher probability of reflecting some opinion, a higher probability of reflecting some genuine aspect of Templar ritual.genuine aspect of Templar ritual.In any case, the object was also consistently In any case, the object was also consistently referred to as a “talking head”. This is interesting referred to as a “talking head”. This is interesting when viewed within the context of Templar when viewed within the context of Templar iconography. Their patron saint was John the iconography. Their patron saint was John the Baptist, whose severed head was perhaps supposed Baptist, whose severed head was perhaps supposed to inform them of secret knowledge [shades of the to inform them of secret knowledge [shades of the head of Mimir!].head of Mimir!].But what could this stone tablet have shown or But what could this stone tablet have shown or contained?

[By the way, this magic square also appears in Chapter 3 of appears in Chapter 3 of The Book of the Sacred The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra=Melin the MageMagic of Abra=Melin the Mage.].]Hardenberg noted the peculiar pattern formed Hardenberg noted the peculiar pattern formed by the “A”s in the square and removed all the other by the “A”s in the square and removed all the other letters, leaving also the apparently centrally located letters, leaving also the apparently centrally located “B”:“B”:Scroll of SetScroll of Set - - February 1987February 1987 - Page - Page 22"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":".

But additionally, and more formally, Hardenberg noticed additionally, and more formally, Hardenberg noticed that the “A”s gave a pattern familiar to all that the “A”s gave a pattern familiar to all Templars: the “Maltese cross”. This was the form Templars: the “Maltese cross”. This was the form of cross used by the Order. What is stranger is that of cross used by the Order. What is stranger is that this figure is called “the talking head” (das redende this figure is called “the talking head” (das redende Haupt) in the language of heraldry. This symbol has Haupt) in the language of heraldry. This symbol has also been interpreted as a pair of counter-directed also been interpreted as a pair of counter-directed swastikas - a symbol known in heraldry as the swastikas - a symbol known in heraldry as the fyrfosfyrfos or “fire-whisk”. or “fire-whisk”.Here are already several magical connections: Here are already several magical connections: the primal creative fire to the “the primal creative fire to the “fyrfosfyrfos”” [under the [under the name “talking head”], and these to the general name “talking head”], and these to the general exoteric sign of the Order: its cross.exoteric sign of the Order: its cross.In this context Hardenberg gives a solution to In this context Hardenberg gives a solution to the name “Baphomet” as a Latin phrase: the name “Baphomet” as a Latin phrase: B A B A fomitem habemusfomitem habemus: “from the letters B and A we : “from the letters B and A we have the igniter of fire” [from Latin have the igniter of fire” [from Latin fomesfomes: : “touchwood, tinder” used to ignite fires].“touchwood, tinder” used to ignite fires].This could have been quite naturally referred to This could have been quite naturally referred to with the short forms “BA fomes” or “BA fomit” with the short forms “BA fomes” or “BA fomit” (=Baphomet).
