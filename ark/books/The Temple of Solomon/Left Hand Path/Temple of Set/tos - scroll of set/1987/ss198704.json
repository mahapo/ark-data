I shall also realms of Satanic and Setian philosophy. I shall also demonstrate the existential authenticity of the demonstrate the existential authenticity of the Satanic perspective on the universe and man’s Satanic perspective on the universe and man’s relation to it. I will begin with a discussion of the relation to it. I will begin with a discussion of the Satanism of Anton LaVey and its subsequent Satanism of Anton LaVey and its subsequent development into the Setian philosophy of Dr. development into the Setian philosophy of Dr. Michael A. Aquino.Michael A. Aquino.It is important to dispense with a number of It is important to dispense with a number of misconceptions concerning Satanic philosophy. By misconceptions concerning Satanic philosophy. By the term “Satanism” I refer specifically to the the term “Satanism” I refer specifically to the philosophy of Anton LaVey as set forth in his philosophy of Anton LaVey as set forth in his books books The Satanic BibleThe Satanic Bible, , The Satanic RitualsThe Satanic Rituals, and , and The Compleat WitchThe Compleat Witch, and as espoused by the , and as espoused by the Church of Satan.Church of Satan.The first principleThe first principle11 of this philosophy is of this philosophy is IndulgenceIndulgence22 [LaVey, [LaVey, SBSB; Aquino, ; Aquino, The Church of The Church of SatanSatan]. This emphasizes the carnal aspect of man, ]. This emphasizes the carnal aspect of man, which the Satanist feels to have been not only which the Satanist feels to have been not only neglected by conventional religions but also actively neglected by conventional religions but also actively repressed, at the cost of inducing a great many repressed, at the cost of inducing a great many neuroses and much unnecessary suffering.neuroses and much unnecessary suffering.Generally I also apply the term “Satanism” to Generally I also apply the term “Satanism” to the Setian philosophy, the first principle of which is the Setian philosophy, the first principle of which is the Egyptian hieroglyph the Egyptian hieroglyph XeperXeper, which means , which means “become” or “Come into Being” and is “become” or “Come into Being” and is symbolized by the scarab beetle.symbolized by the scarab beetle.The Patron of “Setians” is the oldest The Patron of “Setians” is the oldest semblance of the Prince of Darkness known to us: semblance of the Prince of Darkness known to us: the Egyptian Set, brother of the Sun god Horus and the Egyptian Set, brother of the Sun god Horus and symbol of the night and the Lunar principle.symbol of the night and the Lunar principle.The Setian philosophy espoused by the Temple The Setian philosophy espoused by the Temple of Set is highly eclectic and existential. For this of Set is highly eclectic and existential. For this reason the sacred and mythical animals associated reason the sacred and mythical animals associated with the with the netersneters [often loosely translated as “gods” [often loosely translated as “gods” but perhaps more accurately likened to to the but perhaps more accurately likened to to the Platonic Forms] are interpreted in a highly Platonic Forms] are interpreted in a highly metaphorical and allegorical manner.metaphorical and allegorical manner.It is also important to note the distinction It is also important to note the distinction between between esotericesoteric and and exotericexoteric interpretations of interpretations of philosophical and magical imagery. The philosophical and magical imagery. The understanding of the sages and priests of ancient understanding of the sages and priests of ancient initiatory societies - those initiated into the inner initiatory societies - those initiated into the inner temples - and that of the masses of followers who temples - and that of the masses of followers who worshipped at the outer templesworshipped at the outer temples33 - were at great - were at great variance.variance.As the “riddler” or “dark philosopher” As the “riddler” or “dark philosopher” Heraclitus observed, many are incapable of Heraclitus observed, many are incapable of understanding religious symbolism on a non-literal understanding religious symbolism on a non-literal level, and thus worship statues.level, and thus worship statues.I would also apply the term “Satanism” to the I would also apply the term “Satanism” to the Thelemic [from the Greek Thelemic [from the Greek thelemathelema, “will”] , “will”] philosophy of the self-proclaimed Great Beast 666, philosophy of the self-proclaimed Great Beast 666, Aleister Crowley. Thus Satanic magical Aleister Crowley. Thus Satanic magical philosophies are those which exalt the individual philosophies are those which exalt the individual will rather than seeking its dissolution through will rather than seeking its dissolution through reunion with “God”, the rationale being that if reunion with “God”, the rationale being that if one’s individual essence is dispersed into that of one’s individual essence is dispersed into that of “God”, the former ceases to exist as a separate “God”, the former ceases to exist as a separate entity [Aquino, entity [Aquino, Black MagicBlack Magic, , Crystal Tablet of SetCrystal Tablet of Set].].By Satanism I do By Satanism I do notnot refer to the nefarious refer to the nefarious activities of juvenile delinquents and psychopaths. activities of juvenile delinquents and psychopaths. Such activities as human or animal sacrifice are Such activities as human or animal sacrifice are looked upon with extreme disparagement by looked upon with extreme disparagement by Satanists, Setians, and Thelemites. Moreover their Satanists, Setians, and Thelemites. Moreover their objections stem from not merely the fear of social objections stem from not merely the fear of social reproach, but also the very core principles of their reproach, but also the very core principles of their philosophies. Cf. LaVey’s “On the Choice of a philosophies. Cf. LaVey’s “On the Choice of a Human Sacrifice” in his Human Sacrifice” in his Satanic BibleSatanic Bible..Originally the Church of Satan arose as a Originally the Church of Satan arose as a reaction against what were perceived to be reaction against what were perceived to be unreasonably restrictive moralisms. It was also a unreasonably restrictive moralisms. It was also a movement aimed at de-alienating man’s carnal movement aimed at de-alienating man’s carnal aspect. Moreover it questioned the widespread belief aspect. Moreover it questioned the widespread belief in the nobility and altruism of humanity as a whole, in the nobility and altruism of humanity as a whole, viewing this belief as naive and not substantiated by viewing this belief as naive and not substantiated by the realities of actual human behavior. The the realities of actual human behavior. The Satanic Satanic BibleBible maintained that man, or at least the common maintained that man, or at least the common man, is the most vicious of all beasts.man, is the most vicious of all beasts.Conventional religious worship was seen as Conventional religious worship was seen as self-delusion, as it was thought that “the force self-delusion, as it was thought that “the force which permeates and balances the universe is far too which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care about the happiness or misery of impersonal to care about the happiness or misery of flesh-and-blood creatures”.

Such a goal is BecomingBecoming..55The Right-Hand vs. the Left-Hand PathThe Right-Hand vs. the Left-Hand PathThe term “Right-Hand Path” refers to those The term “Right-Hand Path” refers to those religions and philosophies which look upon the religions and philosophies which look upon the “ego”, the self, or the individual with “ego”, the self, or the individual with disparagement and seek conformity of thought & disparagement and seek conformity of thought & action, and eventual dissolution of the individual action, and eventual dissolution of the individual essence into that of “God” [Aquino, essence into that of “God” [Aquino, COSCOS, , CTCT].].Such philosophies would include Christianity - Such philosophies would include Christianity - with a view to a past golden age of blissful with a view to a past golden age of blissful innocence in the absence of the pain which self-innocence in the absence of the pain which self-consciousness produces, and a view to a future in consciousness produces, and a view to a future in Heaven, wherein such a state of innocence may be Heaven, wherein such a state of innocence may be regained - and Buddhism, with its promise of regained - and Buddhism, with its promise of nirvananirvana..Many are the religions and philosophies of the Many are the religions and philosophies of the Right-Hand Path, and many are the other means Right-Hand Path, and many are the other means which humans have devised in their attempts to which humans have devised in their attempts to extinguish this self-consciousness which so afflicts extinguish this self-consciousness which so afflicts them. Drug abuse, alcoholism, and fanaticism of them. Drug abuse, alcoholism, and fanaticism of every kind have been employed in this capacity.every kind have been employed in this capacity.Whereas religions and philosophies of the Whereas religions and philosophies of the Right-Hand Path seek to destroy this self-Right-Hand Path seek to destroy this self-consciousness and exalt peace [and what is more consciousness and exalt peace [and what is more peaceful than a freshly-embalmed corpse as it rests, peaceful than a freshly-embalmed corpse as it rests, ever so still, in its casket?], those of the Left-Hand ever so still, in its casket?], those of the Left-Hand Path exalt self-awareness as the highest value.Path exalt self-awareness as the highest value.Accordingly the “Devil”, the “source of Accordingly the “Devil”, the “source of discord” [read “multiplicity”], is understood by discord” [read “multiplicity”], is understood by the Setian to be a friend and not an enemy.the Setian to be a friend and not an enemy.66 Yet Yet those whose highest value is not “self” but rather those whose highest value is not “self” but rather “peace” will obviously not esteem His Infernal “peace” will obviously not esteem His Infernal Majesty so highly. And those in whose weakness Majesty so highly. And those in whose weakness the pain of consciousness is almost unbearable may the pain of consciousness is almost unbearable may be nothing short of virulent in their hatred of this be nothing short of virulent in their hatred of this image.image.It will be said that the Christian perspective on It will be said that the Christian perspective on the phenomenon of separate consciousness is being the phenomenon of separate consciousness is being misrepresented - that Christianity has a personal misrepresented - that Christianity has a personal concept of “God” and places supreme importance concept of “God” and places supreme importance upon the person. To this I would respond that, while upon the person. To this I would respond that, while Christian monotheism indeed places a great Christian monotheism indeed places a great emphasis upon the person [in contrast to pantheism, emphasis upon the person [in contrast to pantheism, for example] and imbues him with a free will, for example] and imbues him with a free will, exercise of this free will in contradiction to the exercise of this free will in contradiction to the “laws of ‘God’” is cause for extreme “laws of ‘God’” is cause for extreme punishment.punishment.77However, as LaVey points out in the However, as LaVey points out in the Satanic Satanic BibleBible, one need not be a vicious and heinous , one need not be a vicious and heinous individual to indulge in the “seven deadly sins”.individual to indulge in the “seven deadly sins”.In opposition to St. Augustine’s contention that In opposition to St. Augustine’s contention that pride is the root of all other sin stands LaVey’s pride is the root of all other sin stands LaVey’s concept of pride - under the heading of which he concept of pride - under the heading of which he includes such concepts as self-love, self-esteem and includes such concepts as self-love, self-esteem and self-consciousness - as the self-consciousness - as the conditio sine qua nonconditio sine qua non88 of the ability to love another. Thus it is not those of the ability to love another. Thus it is not those who take pride in themselves and possess a high who take pride in themselves and possess a high degree of self-esteem, but rather those whose degree of self-esteem, but rather those whose arrogance is the result of over-compensation for a arrogance is the result of over-compensation for a lacklack of self-esteem who are unable to treat others of self-esteem who are unable to treat others with consideration.with consideration.Furthermore Satanists and Setians are moral Furthermore Satanists and Setians are moral relativists. Their rationale for this over moral relativists. Their rationale for this over moral absolutism will emerge from the following absolutism will emerge from the following discussion of the Satanic & Setian interpretation of discussion of the Satanic & Setian interpretation of “God”.“God”.Scroll of SetScroll of Set - - April 1987April 1987 - Page - Page 22"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Question of “God’s” ExistenceThe Question of “God’s” ExistenceIn the Setian philosophy the religious concept of In the Setian philosophy the religious concept of “God” is conceived as roughly equivalent to the “God” is conceived as roughly equivalent to the scientific concept of “natural law” [Aquino, scientific concept of “natural law” [Aquino, BMBM]. ].
