Further, perhaps Kelley was trying to the calls? Further, perhaps Kelley was trying to mislead Dee.mislead Dee.Now, on to Crowley. Crowley obviously read Now, on to Crowley. Crowley obviously read the Casaubon work and probably even possessed a the Casaubon work and probably even possessed a copy. He either accepted Kelley’s statement at face copy. He either accepted Kelley’s statement at face value, or, and this is more likely, used it to build a value, or, and this is more likely, used it to build a facade. Why should the Master Therion, the facade. Why should the Master Therion, the reincarnation of Edward Kelley by his own reincarnation of Edward Kelley by his own admission, the master at couching ideas in utter admission, the master at couching ideas in utter confusion, give anyone the proper pronunciation of confusion, give anyone the proper pronunciation of the calls? He wouldn’t! Judging by the way the calls? He wouldn’t! Judging by the way Crowley inserted the vowels for his version of the Crowley inserted the vowels for his version of the calls published in the calls published in the EquinoxEquinox, it is doubtful that he , it is doubtful that he believed in the Hebrew method.believed in the Hebrew method.As Crowley’s As Crowley’s EquinoxEquinox was not, at least for most was not, at least for most of us, our first introduction to the calls, let us take a of us, our first introduction to the calls, let us take a quick peek at Dr. Anton LaVey and the quick peek at Dr. Anton LaVey and the Satanic Satanic BibleBible, the first place that the calls were published for , the first place that the calls were published for the masses. LaVey did some very interesting things the masses. LaVey did some very interesting things to them. In Enochian, for example, he changed to them. In Enochian, for example, he changed “laida” to “Saitan”, maintaining that Saitan was “laida” to “Saitan”, maintaining that Saitan was the Enochian name for Satan. This has absolutely the Enochian name for Satan. This has absolutely no basis. It would have been perhaps more correct no basis. It would have been perhaps more correct to use the name Choronzon to replace laida. [”... for to use the name Choronzon to replace laida.
