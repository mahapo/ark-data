Roland Holt III°[reprinted from [reprinted from Voice of the DragonVoice of the Dragon #I-8, #I-8,Asmodeus Pylon, 5/7/XI]Asmodeus Pylon, 5/7/XI]While speaking recently with a friend who is not While speaking recently with a friend who is not a Temple of Set member, but who is “into” magic a Temple of Set member, but who is “into” magic in a dilettantish sort of way, I was taken aback to in a dilettantish sort of way, I was taken aback to hear him claim as “some spooky, genuine magical hear him claim as “some spooky, genuine magical phenomena” certain processes which were not at all phenomena” certain processes which were not at all magical but plainly physiological.magical but plainly physiological.Since I do not care to see any Temple of Set Since I do not care to see any Temple of Set member repeat his errors, I have decided to explain member repeat his errors, I have decided to explain two of the most common physiological reactions two of the most common physiological reactions which occur while one is “in chamber”. I hope that which occur while one is “in chamber”. I hope that these explanations will help you better understand these explanations will help you better understand some of the weird effects [and affects!] which you some of the weird effects [and affects!] which you experience while performing a working. There are experience while performing a working. There are enough truly valid magical phenomena without enough truly valid magical phenomena without erroneously recruiting others which have sound, erroneously recruiting others which have sound, “normal” explanations. But, for the love of Set, “normal” explanations. But, for the love of Set, never tell this to a Wiccan unless you can stand the never tell this to a Wiccan unless you can stand the smell of smoldering feathers!smell of smoldering feathers!Both of the processes which we will consider Both of the processes which we will consider involve changes in respiration. The first process is involve changes in respiration. The first process is simple hyperventilationsimple hyperventilation: breathing more rapidly : breathing more rapidly and more deeply than normal. The second process and more deeply than normal. The second process is one common in straining to lift heavy objects, or is one common in straining to lift heavy objects, or to reach peak mental concentration at the climax of a to reach peak mental concentration at the climax of a ritual. This consists of contracting the expiratory ritual. This consists of contracting the expiratory muscles while keeping the airway closed by means muscles while keeping the airway closed by means of the glottis. Commonly this is called “bearing of the glottis. Commonly this is called “bearing down”; medically it is known as the down”; medically it is known as the Valsalva Valsalva maneuvermaneuver. Both hyperventilation and the Valsalva . Both hyperventilation and the Valsalva maneuver produce profound changes in the function maneuver produce profound changes in the function of the human physiological system.of the human physiological system.When one hyperventilates - and this is When one hyperventilates - and this is exceedingly common during workings - the exceedingly common during workings - the increased rate and depth of respiration causes an increased rate and depth of respiration causes an excessive amount of COexcessive amount of CO22 to be breathed off. This to be breathed off. This lack of COlack of CO22 is called medically “hypocapnia” and is called medically “hypocapnia” and results in an increase of blood pH which is called results in an increase of blood pH which is called “respiratory alkalosis”. The pH of the blood is a “respiratory alkalosis”. The pH of the blood is a measure of the acidity of the blood, or to be specific:measure of the acidity of the blood, or to be specific:pH = -log[H+].pH = -log[H+].Now the pH of the blood is largely determined Now the pH of the blood is largely determined by the carbonic acid buffer system, according to the by the carbonic acid buffer system, according to the following equation:following equation:[CO[CO22] + [H] + [H22O] /=/O] /=/[H[H22COCO33] /=/ (carbonic acid)] /=/ (carbonic acid)[H+] + [HCO[H+] + [HCO33]]If this looks like Greek (or Enochian!) to you, If this looks like Greek (or Enochian!) to you, don’t despair. If you just look at the equation, you don’t despair. If you just look at the equation, you will see that if you increase the COwill see that if you increase the CO22 concentration, concentration, you also [because this is an you also [because this is an equationequation] increase the ] increase the H+ concentration, thus H+ concentration, thus droppingdropping the pH. [A pH of the pH. [A pH of 1 is acid; a pH of 14 is basic.]1 is acid; a pH of 14 is basic.]Conversely, if you blow off COConversely, if you blow off CO22 by by hyperventilation, you lower the H+ concentration, hyperventilation, you lower the H+ concentration, make the blood make the blood alkaloticalkalotic, hence , hence raiseraise the pH. the pH.To recap: We have established that an increase To recap: We have established that an increase in rate and depth of breath causes excess COin rate and depth of breath causes excess CO22 loss, loss, which in turn causes a rise in the pH of the blood. which in turn causes a rise in the pH of the blood. Now what does this increase in pH mean Now what does this increase in pH mean physiologically?physiologically?Firstly, a fall in COFirstly, a fall in CO22 concentration results in concentration results in cerebral vasoconstriction [English translation: cerebral vasoconstriction [English translation: constriction of blood vessels in the brain, resulting constriction of blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased nutrient and gas exchange]. This in decreased nutrient and gas exchange]. This decrease in blood flow causes certain neurological decrease in blood flow causes certain neurological changes, among which is the familiar “tingling changes, among which is the familiar “tingling sensation” which so many of us experience in sensation” which so many of us experience in chamber. If the hyperventilation continues, this chamber. If the hyperventilation continues, this tingling will progress into full-blown numbness. If tingling will progress into full-blown numbness. If carried to extreme, the hands will involuntarily carried to extreme, the hands will involuntarily contract and consciousness will be lost.contract and consciousness will be lost.But such extremes will not be found in ritual But such extremes will not be found in ritual settings; they are expected only in pathological settings; they are expected only in pathological states or in childbirth. In addition to these states or in childbirth. In addition to these neurological changes, alkalosis causes a host of neurological changes, alkalosis causes a host of other alterations, which are too numerous to other alterations, which are too numerous to consider here. Any of the above-mentioned consider here. Any of the above-mentioned symptoms of alkalosis will subside shortly after one symptoms of alkalosis will subside shortly after one resumes normal breathing. In short, then, the resumes normal breathing. In short, then, the tingling and numbness often experienced in tingling and numbness often experienced in chamber are not magical but physiological, and can chamber are not magical but physiological, and can be reproduced any time you feel like be reproduced any time you feel like hyperventilating. Now, for the Valsalva maneuver.hyperventilating. Now, for the Valsalva maneuver.The Valsalva maneuver, as I have said, consists The Valsalva maneuver, as I have said, consists of performing expiration, but without allowing any of performing expiration, but without allowing any air to escape.

If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, just try to pick up a very heavy object talking about, just try to pick up a very heavy object and watch what happens to your respiration. The and watch what happens to your respiration. The result of the Valsalva maneuver is a result of the Valsalva maneuver is a decreasedecrease in in blood return to the heart, and consequently reduced blood return to the heart, and consequently reduced blood supply to the brain. This action produces blood supply to the brain. This action produces fainting, “rushes”, and sometimes piercing head fainting, “rushes”, and sometimes piercing head pains.

This is pressure (pressure inside the chest wall).
