Sinnott III°- by Howard M. Sinnott III°The human race has the potential to destroy The human race has the potential to destroy itself and all traces of its civilization within a matter itself and all traces of its civilization within a matter of minutes. Movies that have come out recently of minutes. Movies that have come out recently seem to show a preoccupation with destruction and seem to show a preoccupation with destruction and doom. For rational, sane people, this cataclysm is a doom. For rational, sane people, this cataclysm is a frightening aspect, to be avoided by any way frightening aspect, to be avoided by any way possible.possible.The Temple of Set is dedicated to the survival of The Temple of Set is dedicated to the survival of civilization and of its membership. We are an elitist civilization and of its membership. We are an elitist organization; we realize that not all people are truly organization; we realize that not all people are truly equal, but are indeed unique. Some people are equal, but are indeed unique. Some people are talented and gifted, visionary and intelligent, while talented and gifted, visionary and intelligent, while others, most, I’m afraid, are never meant to see others, most, I’m afraid, are never meant to see beyond their own noses. We, the elite, must beyond their own noses. We, the elite, must endeavor to lead the masses on a path that will save endeavor to lead the masses on a path that will save them, if possible. Our first duty, however, is to them, if possible. Our first duty, however, is to ensure our own survival and prosperity.ensure our own survival and prosperity.It would be realistic to point out that our It would be realistic to point out that our members are few; it is our quality that sets [sorry members are few; it is our quality that sets [sorry about that pun] us apart from the rest of the about that pun] us apart from the rest of the religions. Even with our higher quality of people, it religions. Even with our higher quality of people, it is ludicrous to think that we can save the world. is ludicrous to think that we can save the world. Right now we might be lucky to save ourselves.Right now we might be lucky to save ourselves.We cannot, however, allow ourselves to be We cannot, however, allow ourselves to be dominated by pessimism. We live in a political dominated by pessimism. We live in a political climate that allows us to exist, for which we can be climate that allows us to exist, for which we can be grateful. The Temple of Set supports this political grateful. The Temple of Set supports this political system that allows each person to profess his or her system that allows each person to profess his or her own religious beliefs; without compulsion to own religious beliefs; without compulsion to change. In fact, on this point, we must always change. In fact, on this point, we must always jealously guard this precious right, because it is a jealously guard this precious right, because it is a right that zealous self-appointed saviours and right that zealous self-appointed saviours and prophets do not recognize. Since every person has prophets do not recognize. Since every person has the right to blind himself by his own illusions, we the right to blind himself by his own illusions, we do not begrudge anyone’s religious beliefs. We do not begrudge anyone’s religious beliefs. We surely wouldn’t want everyone to become Setians surely wouldn’t want everyone to become Setians and thus bring unqualified persons into our Temple. and thus bring unqualified persons into our Temple.

This is a valuable thing to States and California. This is a valuable thing to have for all of us, and accurately reflects the nature have for all of us, and accurately reflects the nature of our organization.of our organization.The Temple of Set does not involve itself in The Temple of Set does not involve itself in partisan political activities; it will not lobby, endorse partisan political activities; it will not lobby, endorse candidates or issue political position papers. We do candidates or issue political position papers. We do so for two reasons: (1) Our tax-exempt status so for two reasons: (1) Our tax-exempt status forbids it; and (2) More importantly, it could forbids it; and (2) More importantly, it could possibly divide our membership over a relatively possibly divide our membership over a relatively trivial matter and thus change the nature of the trivial matter and thus change the nature of the Temple from that of a religious and philosophical Temple from that of a religious and philosophical society to that of a political club.society to that of a political club.Partisan politics is concerned with immediate, Partisan politics is concerned with immediate, hot issues.
