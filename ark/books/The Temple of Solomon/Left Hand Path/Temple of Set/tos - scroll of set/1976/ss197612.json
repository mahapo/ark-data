Dale Seago IV°When I first began this project, my sole When I first began this project, my sole intention was to illustrate the manner in which the intention was to illustrate the manner in which the dominant Judæo-Christian religion is being used by dominant Judæo-Christian religion is being used by at least one religious foundation to inculcate and at least one religious foundation to inculcate and perpetuate racist attitudes and activities, specifically perpetuate racist attitudes and activities, specifically by an organization called “Your Heritage”.by an organization called “Your Heritage”.After examining their literature and its religious, After examining their literature and its religious, political, and economic implications, however, I was political, and economic implications, however, I was increasingly struck by its similarity to the core increasingly struck by its similarity to the core principles of German National Socialism or Nazism, principles of German National Socialism or Nazism, and I feel that this ideological identity should be and I feel that this ideological identity should be noted in view of its possible implications for the noted in view of its possible implications for the future.future.“Your Heritage” advocates a specific type of “Your Heritage” advocates a specific type of racist attitude: White “Aryan” supremacy. This racist attitude: White “Aryan” supremacy. This “Master Race” ideology is founded upon two “Master Race” ideology is founded upon two things: the Judæo-Christian things: the Judæo-Christian BibleBible and a number of and a number of works purporting to present scientific evidence of works purporting to present scientific evidence of White superiority. It is not merely anti-Black and White superiority. It is not merely anti-Black and anti-Yellow, but anti-Semitic as well - which sounds anti-Yellow, but anti-Semitic as well - which sounds strange indeed until one sees how they justify it. strange indeed until one sees how they justify it. Then it seems even stranger.Then it seems even stranger.In the first place, they claim that all civilizations In the first place, they claim that all civilizations derive from the White race, and that of the Whites, derive from the White race, and that of the Whites, the Aryan (commonly known today as the the Aryan (commonly known today as the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Celtic peoples) are Germanic, Scandinavian, and Celtic peoples) are superior. This is based primarily on the writings of superior. This is based primarily on the writings of de Gobineau, Lapouge, and Houston Stewart de Gobineau, Lapouge, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, which state in effect that the White Chamberlain, which state in effect that the White race is superior because White civilizations have race is superior because White civilizations have reached a higher level than those of other races: a reached a higher level than those of other races: a sort of social Darwinism. This is stated clearly in a sort of social Darwinism. This is stated clearly in a pamphlet entitled pamphlet entitled God’s Great RaceGod’s Great Race::The Caucasian or White race is the superior The Caucasian or White race is the superior race. It is responsible for the civilization we have race. It is responsible for the civilization we have today. Throughout recorded history it has produced today. Throughout recorded history it has produced all the civilizations which have reached a high level. all the civilizations which have reached a high level. The Yellow race has not attained as high a The Yellow race has not attained as high a civilization or progressed as far as have the nations civilization or progressed as far as have the nations composed of the Caucasian race. Malaysians and composed of the Caucasian race. Malaysians and Polynesians are even less developed, and the Polynesians are even less developed, and the Negroes have made the least progress of all.

Where groups of Caucasians have merged or interbred with groups of Caucasians have merged or interbred with inferior stocks, the Whites have deteriorated ... The inferior stocks, the Whites have deteriorated ... The Caucasian race is indeed the greatest of all peoples, Caucasian race is indeed the greatest of all peoples, and if it dies, the glory of the world will perish with and if it dies, the glory of the world will perish with it.it.So not only are the Whites superior, they must So not only are the Whites superior, they must not mix their blood with inferior races. not mix their blood with inferior races. BiblicallyBiblically this is supposed to be justified by some of the this is supposed to be justified by some of the following passages:following passages:“Thou didst separate them from among all “Thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to by thine the people of the earth, to by thine inheritance.” (I Kings 8:53)inheritance.” (I Kings 8:53)“For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto “For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for a peculiar treasure.” himself, and Israel for a peculiar treasure.” (Psalms 135:4)(Psalms 135:4)“For thou art a holy people, the Lord thy “For thou art a holy people, the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth.” (Deuteronomy 7:6)the earth.” (Deuteronomy 7:6)Now this seems rather flimsy, since it obviously Now this seems rather flimsy, since it obviously refers to Israel; and it hardly seems to justify anti-refers to Israel; and it hardly seems to justify anti-Semitism. But once you understand that it is Semitism. But once you understand that it is actually the modern Aryan nations - and not the actually the modern Aryan nations - and not the Jews - who are actually Israel, it all becomes Jews - who are actually Israel, it all becomes perfectly clear ... doesn’t it?perfectly clear ... doesn’t it?Why are the Scandinavians, Germans, Franks, Why are the Scandinavians, Germans, Franks, British/Scotch/Irish, Canadians, Americans, South British/Scotch/Irish, Canadians, Americans, South Africans (the White inhabitants) racially Israelites? Africans (the White inhabitants) racially Israelites? Well, you see, the original Israelites were White Well, you see, the original Israelites were White Aryans; and around 700 BCE ten of the twelve Aryans; and around 700 BCE ten of the twelve tribes of Israel were transported into Assyria after a tribes of Israel were transported into Assyria after a major defeat. Nothing more is known of them as major defeat. Nothing more is known of them as Israelite tribes after that. But also in the 7th Century Israelite tribes after that. But also in the 7th Century BCE appeared in that area a people whom the BCE appeared in that area a people whom the Persians called the Sacæ, Scyths, or Scythians, who Persians called the Sacæ, Scyths, or Scythians, who were a White, light-haired people described as were a White, light-haired people described as similar in appearance to the Celts and Germans. similar in appearance to the Celts and Germans.

For example, the Aryans and the ancient Israelites. For example, the love of liberty is an Anglo-Saxon trait which was love of liberty is an Anglo-Saxon trait which was also common to the Israelites, which is perhaps also common to the Israelites, which is perhaps natural since the Israelites seem always to have been natural since the Israelites seem always to have been in process of being carried captive into one ancient in process of being carried captive into one ancient nation after another: Babylon, Egypt, Assyria ...nation after another: Babylon, Egypt, Assyria ...What about the Jews, then, who seem to be What about the Jews, then, who seem to be laboring under the delusion that laboring under the delusion that theythey are Israelites? are Israelites?
