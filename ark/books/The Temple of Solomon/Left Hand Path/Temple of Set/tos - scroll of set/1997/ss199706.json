This usually leads to thoughts regarding ways in which I as Grand thoughts regarding ways in which I as Grand Master, and the OSOM as an initiatory tool, can Master, and the OSOM as an initiatory tool, can become better at what we do.become better at what we do.This process of introspection recently guided This process of introspection recently guided me to thoughts about my original purpose for the me to thoughts about my original purpose for the OSOM, and to ask questions regarding how well we OSOM, and to ask questions regarding how well we have fulfilled our purpose. I also asked, as I request have fulfilled our purpose. I also asked, as I request all Dromenoi to do, whether the OSOM were still all Dromenoi to do, whether the OSOM were still serving my own initiation.serving my own initiation.The result of this internal investigation has led The result of this internal investigation has led me to introduce certain re-visions that I feel are me to introduce certain re-visions that I feel are important enough to share with the Temple of Set as important enough to share with the Temple of Set as a whole. Why?a whole. Why?As a Temple of Set Order it is our duty to As a Temple of Set Order it is our duty to facilitate the facilitate the XeperXeper of the entire Temple in ways of the entire Temple in ways unique to us.

So before gear with expectation and excitement. So before going any further, allow me to emphatically state going any further, allow me to emphatically state that (1) I am that (1) I am notnot leaving the Temple at this time, and leaving the Temple at this time, and (2) I am (2) I am notnot passing the leadership of the OSOM passing the leadership of the OSOM on to someone else.

That said, there are still some interesting observations and announcements I would interesting observations and announcements I would like to make.like to make.Most are taken from the April issue of the Most are taken from the April issue of the Sepulchral VoiceSepulchral Voice (the OSOM Newsletter) they are (the OSOM Newsletter) they are discussed in greater detail.discussed in greater detail.Mastery in the Order of the Sepulcher of theMastery in the Order of the Sepulcher of theObsidian MasqueObsidian MasqueDuring the last year the notion of Mastery During the last year the notion of Mastery within the OSOM has come up on several within the OSOM has come up on several occasions, and is in need of clarification and occasions, and is in need of clarification and definition. As has been suggested, this is something definition. As has been suggested, this is something I could just decide as Grand Master. But since it I could just decide as Grand Master. But since it ultimately affects all Dromenoi, I thought it would ultimately affects all Dromenoi, I thought it would be interesting to get their feedback and input.be interesting to get their feedback and input.As a Professor of Theatre, I learned that when I As a Professor of Theatre, I learned that when I allowed my students to establish grading criteria for allowed my students to establish grading criteria for class, they were as a rule a lot harder on themselves class, they were as a rule a lot harder on themselves and more demanding than I ever would be. As and more demanding than I ever would be. As regards to Mastery within the OSOM, this regards to Mastery within the OSOM, this experimental truth has proved to be just as accurate: experimental truth has proved to be just as accurate: The criteria the Dromenoi suggested is far more The criteria the Dromenoi suggested is far more specific and demanding than any I would ever have specific and demanding than any I would ever have devised.devised.The following criteria are a result of our The following criteria are a result of our combined efforts to define and clarify Mastery combined efforts to define and clarify Mastery within the OSOM:within the OSOM:Although the idea of Master of the Obsidian Although the idea of Master of the Obsidian Sepulcher is an obvious and necessary development Sepulcher is an obvious and necessary development with the OSOM, I think it first came into being with the OSOM, I think it first came into being when I inserted the when I inserted the Ehwaz-Kenaz-TiwazEhwaz-Kenaz-Tiwaz ( (Eh-Ken-Eh-Ken-TyrTyr) bind-rune [identifying it only as a Rune of ) bind-rune [identifying it only as a Rune of Mastery or the symbol of Embodied Essence] into Mastery or the symbol of Embodied Essence] into the diagram of the “Key” accompanying my article the diagram of the “Key” accompanying my article “Essent into Essence: The Key and its Facets”.“Essent into Essence: The Key and its Facets”.The The Dag-Ken-TyrDag-Ken-Tyr bind-rune, symbolic of the bind-rune, symbolic of the function within the OSOM of a Dromen(a) of the function within the OSOM of a Dromen(a) of the Sepulcher, has been bequeathed to all incoming Sepulcher, has been bequeathed to all incoming Dromenoi for exploration and discovery. In the Dromenoi for exploration and discovery. In the second issue of second issue of SVSV, I provided a history and , I provided a history and definition of this rune, and in later issues the definition of this rune, and in later issues the Dromenoi of the Sepulcher have shared ideas Dromenoi of the Sepulcher have shared ideas concerning this process extremely well.concerning this process extremely well.The The Eh-Ken-TyrEh-Ken-Tyr bind-rune, on the other hand, is bind-rune, on the other hand, is an undefined symbol of the process of an undefined symbol of the process of Essent into Essent into EssenceEssence and the eventual Embodiment of Essence.
