But if we look at the as “moral” in the RHP-sense. But if we look at the principle more closely, we can see that it means (a) principle more closely, we can see that it means (a) an individual’s profound approach to existence, an individual’s profound approach to existence, either LHP or RHP; and (b) that the moral which either LHP or RHP; and (b) that the moral which YamaYama means should be created by the individual, means should be created by the individual, according to one’s true will. Says Ipsissimus according to one’s true will. Says Ipsissimus Crowley in his Crowley in his Eight Lectures on YogaEight Lectures on Yoga::Yoga means “union”. In the mind of a pious Yoga means “union”. In the mind of a pious person, the inferiority complex which accounts person, the inferiority complex which accounts for his piety compels him to interpret this for his piety compels him to interpret this emancipation as union with that gaseous emancipation as union with that gaseous vertebrate whom he has invented and called vertebrate whom he has invented and called “God”.

What Then there is the darker side of the Yoga. What is it? In my view, LHP-oriented Yoga is a method is it? In my view, LHP-oriented Yoga is a method for the conscious development of the whole-being; it for the conscious development of the whole-being; it is about going to the essence. Yoga practices aim at is about going to the essence. Yoga practices aim at many different goals, such as broadening of self-many different goals, such as broadening of self-consciousness, getting inspiration from self, and consciousness, getting inspiration from self, and actualizing one’s full potential.actualizing one’s full potential.Ipsissimus Crowley noted that “there is nothing Ipsissimus Crowley noted that “there is nothing Oriental in Yoga”, by which he meant that the Oriental in Yoga”, by which he meant that the principles of the practice are not fixed to Indian principles of the practice are not fixed to Indian tradition. Yoga is about the subject, object, and their tradition. Yoga is about the subject, object, and their relationship. Yoga is often said to mean “union”, relationship. Yoga is often said to mean “union”, which is often misunderstood. In the highest sense which is often misunderstood. In the highest sense Yoga means “union of the whole being”, or Yoga means “union of the whole being”, or “synthesis of the whole being according to one’s “synthesis of the whole being according to one’s true will”.true will”.For me Yoga is about being in contact with the For me Yoga is about being in contact with the self, as well as with Set, the idea of the first among self, as well as with Set, the idea of the first among the separate intelligences. Yoga is about the willed the separate intelligences. Yoga is about the willed whole being and of getting to the root of magical whole being and of getting to the root of magical inspiration. That is why Yoga is sometimes called inspiration. That is why Yoga is sometimes called the “technique to ecstasy”.the “technique to ecstasy”.The word The word YogaYoga itself means “union”. The itself means “union”. The word comes from the same Sanskrit root as the word comes from the same Sanskrit root as the Greek word Greek word zeugmazeugma, the Latin word , the Latin word jugumjugum, and the , and the English word “yoke”. In the spirit of my definition English word “yoke”. In the spirit of my definition of the union above, we can say that the concept of of the union above, we can say that the concept of “union” can be compared to our concept of the “union” can be compared to our concept of the “magical link”.“magical link”.According to Patanjali, Yoga has eight limbs.
