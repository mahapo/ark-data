So I did some digging into Pergamon Working”. So I did some digging into St. John’s words to find out more concerning these St. John’s words to find out more concerning these “deep things of Satan” from the “Book of “deep things of Satan” from the “Book of Revelations”. What I found I thought might be of Revelations”. What I found I thought might be of interest to other Setians.interest to other Setians.In the same chapter of St. John’s In the same chapter of St. John’s “Revelations” in which we find the letter to “Revelations” in which we find the letter to Pergamon, there is another letter to the early Church Pergamon, there is another letter to the early Church at Thyatira, an inland Greek city in Asia Minor. The at Thyatira, an inland Greek city in Asia Minor. The NIV translation of the letter is addressed “to you NIV translation of the letter is addressed “to you who have not learned Satan’s so-called deep who have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets”. (Rev.2:24)secrets”. (Rev.2:24)It is held that around the beginning of the It is held that around the beginning of the second century, the city of Thyatira was a citadel of second century, the city of Thyatira was a citadel of Gnosticism and the mystery religions. Gnosticism Gnosticism and the mystery religions. Gnosticism differed from orthodox Christianity in several key differed from orthodox Christianity in several key doctrines, the first of which was the importance doctrines, the first of which was the importance placed on individual Nœtic apprehension of spiritual placed on individual Nœtic apprehension of spiritual truth (resulting in truth (resulting in gnosisgnosis “knowledge”), versus the “knowledge”), versus the intellectually and morally stifling dogma taught by intellectually and morally stifling dogma taught by the apostles. The Gnostics believed that only the apostles. The Gnostics believed that only through direct experience and interaction with the through direct experience and interaction with the world and the divine could they achieve any kind of world and the divine could they achieve any kind of enlightenment.enlightenment.Second, consequently, as Magister Whitaker Second, consequently, as Magister Whitaker mentions in “What is Antinomianism?”, the mentions in “What is Antinomianism?”, the Gnostics resisted the ecclesiastical mandate to Gnostics resisted the ecclesiastical mandate to dictate laws of morality. If spiritual understanding dictate laws of morality. If spiritual understanding were based on personal experience, then the were based on personal experience, then the development of a system of morality was not an development of a system of morality was not an obligation of the Church, but of the individual. This obligation of the Church, but of the individual. This movement “against the [Christian] law” of the day movement “against the [Christian] law” of the day caused the Church fathers to fear and censure the caused the Church fathers to fear and censure the Gnostics, whose “immoral” lifestyle was seen as a Gnostics, whose “immoral” lifestyle was seen as a threat to the early Church.threat to the early Church.A third major difference was the firm belief in A third major difference was the firm belief in the existence of an inner spark of divinity, the self-the existence of an inner spark of divinity, the self-within-self, that part of the human that allows for within-self, that part of the human that allows for self-realization. This was seen not as a natural or self-realization. This was seen not as a natural or human invention, but as the direct effect of an human invention, but as the direct effect of an outside power, generally thought of as a Gift of outside power, generally thought of as a Gift of sorts. It is this Gift that allowed for interaction with sorts. It is this Gift that allowed for interaction with the Divine, because by recognition of the self, the the Divine, because by recognition of the self, the Gnostic initiate had forged a link between himself Gnostic initiate had forged a link between himself and the Giver. We know this Gift best as as Black and the Giver. We know this Gift best as as Black Flame.Flame.What makes Thyatira unique is that in one What makes Thyatira unique is that in one recent commentary there is documentation of a late recent commentary there is documentation of a late Gnostic trend in Thyatira that taught that in order to Gnostic trend in Thyatira that taught that in order to overcome Satan (the “Demiurge” in Greek, overcome Satan (the “Demiurge” in Greek, identified closely with Set-Typhon, the god of this identified closely with Set-Typhon, the god of this World), one had to “enter his stronghold”. In other World), one had to “enter his stronghold”. In other words, in order to gain the Gnosis necessary for words, in order to gain the Gnosis necessary for true individual growth and Initiation, one had to true individual growth and Initiation, one had to experience fully the World, the Flesh, and the experience fully the World, the Flesh, and the Mysteries in order to overcome (read: “assimilate”) Mysteries in order to overcome (read: “assimilate”) them.them.Regarding the Mysteries, in the Hermetic Regarding the Mysteries, in the Hermetic system, as the god of the created world, the system, as the god of the created world, the Demiurge is a popular candidate for invocation in Demiurge is a popular candidate for invocation in ritual. A wealth of information is available to the ritual. A wealth of information is available to the modern magician on the rites and practices of those modern magician on the rites and practices of those early magicians of the Classical period, and quite a early magicians of the Classical period, and quite a number of these spells employ Gnostic elements.number of these spells employ Gnostic elements.As to the experience of Flesh, rather than the As to the experience of Flesh, rather than the ascetics of their day who believed that they could ascetics of their day who believed that they could only cope with the world through complete only cope with the world through complete abstinence, the LHP Gnostics believed that only abstinence, the LHP Gnostics believed that only through direct experience with all facets of life could through direct experience with all facets of life could they hope to achieve Understanding that applied to they hope to achieve Understanding that applied to the realm of higher forms, perhaps a foreshadowing the realm of higher forms, perhaps a foreshadowing of the word “Indulgence”.of the word “Indulgence”.Unlike some other Gnostics, who as dualists Unlike some other Gnostics, who as dualists believed the material world to be evil and therefore believed the material world to be evil and therefore practiced rigorous abstinences, the Gnostics in practiced rigorous abstinences, the Gnostics in Thyatira demonstrated an appreciation of the carnal Thyatira demonstrated an appreciation of the carnal nature as a healthy, vital aspect of human life.nature as a healthy, vital aspect of human life.There is a secondary meaning inherent to the There is a secondary meaning inherent to the idea of “entering the stronghold” of the Devil to idea of “entering the stronghold” of the Devil to overcome him.

Aquino in his groundbreaking essay for the Order Aquino in his groundbreaking essay for the Order of the Trapezoid entitled, “Proxemic Magic”.of the Trapezoid entitled, “Proxemic Magic”.I personally further developed and noted the I personally further developed and noted the particulars of various mechanisms that could create particulars of various mechanisms that could create change within these environments upon the Initiate change within these environments upon the Initiate in my work with harmonic proportion, tonal in my work with harmonic proportion, tonal angularity, and neuronic tracing. Proxemics, as angularity, and neuronic tracing. Proxemics, as understood within the LHP paradigm, is now understood within the LHP paradigm, is now something more than what Hall originally something more than what Hall originally developed, encompassing the psychological factors developed, encompassing the psychological factors of an initiatory perspective in its utilization.of an initiatory perspective in its utilization.In general, proxemic areas consist of the In general, proxemic areas consist of the “space” and the extension of that space each of us “space” and the extension of that space each of us occupies both physically and psychically. This occupies both physically and psychically. This space can be manipulated and altered directly by the space can be manipulated and altered directly by the participant of a proxemic area, or indirectly by participant of a proxemic area, or indirectly by external influences. A conscious awareness of the external influences. A conscious awareness of the mechanisms that can alter these environments offers mechanisms that can alter these environments offers an opportunity to manipulate those elements into an opportunity to manipulate those elements into desired specifications.desired specifications.Therefore the study of proxemics offers an Therefore the study of proxemics offers an understanding of those components that form the understanding of those components that form the basis of the highly individual way we each perceive basis of the highly individual way we each perceive reality. Additionally knowledge of the rules of reality. Additionally knowledge of the rules of proxemics offers a more precise manner within proxemics offers a more precise manner within which to react to any given scenario within that which to react to any given scenario within that environment. This is due to there being a environment. This is due to there being a consciousness of various actions that an individual consciousness of various actions that an individual can take within that environment according to the can take within that environment according to the particular situation that manifests. Given this, we can particular situation that manifests. Given this, we can see that a thorough knowledge of both the physical see that a thorough knowledge of both the physical and psychological aspects of proxemic and psychological aspects of proxemic environments is an invaluable aid in the development environments is an invaluable aid in the development of magical strategy.of magical strategy.The better understood the external and internal The better understood the external and internal environments we each must exist within, the easier it environments we each must exist within, the easier it is to manipulate and coordinate those environments is to manipulate and coordinate those environments into creations that reflect the aims and desires of the into creations that reflect the aims and desires of the individual.individual.The cause and effect of actions and reactions The cause and effect of actions and reactions within our personal social and psychological within our personal social and psychological structures require a conscious, willed effort to structures require a conscious, willed effort to master.

First, the entails both LBM and GBM principles. First, the LBM application from “Proxemic Magic” By Dr. LBM application from “Proxemic Magic” By Dr. Aquino:Aquino:The conclusion to be drawn from all this is The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the “boundary” of each human being does that the “boundary” of each human being does not end with the skin. Each individual not end with the skin. Each individual possesses an unseen “personal field” - or possesses an unseen “personal field” - or rather variety of situational fields - which rather variety of situational fields - which constitutes his or her true “boundary”. constitutes his or her true “boundary”. The The magician who succeeds in controlling magician who succeeds in controlling or altering another individual’s or altering another individual’s “personal fields” thus controls or “personal fields” thus controls or alters that person just as assuredly as alters that person just as assuredly as though he were able to control his though he were able to control his conscious personality.conscious personality.As to the GBM utility, it is to be understood that As to the GBM utility, it is to be understood that the above principles apply in the same manner. the above principles apply in the same manner. However what we are seeking is controlling and However what we are seeking is controlling and altering aspects of the personal self. We want to altering aspects of the personal self. We want to develop proxemic environments utilizing those develop proxemic environments utilizing those principles that create change in the psychological principles that create change in the psychological constructs of the individual - constructs which allow constructs of the individual - constructs which allow the individual to “see more” within his the individual to “see more” within his environment. This is the purpose of the antinomian environment. This is the purpose of the antinomian praxis: to see more and understand more.praxis: to see more and understand more.The understanding and use of proxemic The understanding and use of proxemic principles on a personal GBM scale is of vital principles on a personal GBM scale is of vital concern to any serious practice of magic along the concern to any serious practice of magic along the LHP. In a essay on æonic resonance I stated:LHP. In a essay on æonic resonance I stated:If comprehension is based upon If comprehension is based upon knowledge of two discrete systems - as in knowledge of two discrete systems - as in resonance - then higher-ordered (more resonance - then higher-ordered (more energetic) relationships with those systems will energetic) relationships with those systems will result in “seeing more” within the same result in “seeing more” within the same perceptual and cognitive frameworks we, as perceptual and cognitive frameworks we, as humans, all share. “Seeing more” is the humans, all share. “Seeing more” is the qualification for meaningful initiatory qualification for meaningful initiatory experience at all levels of being, and “doing experience at all levels of being, and “doing more” is to the synchronicity to resonate that more” is to the synchronicity to resonate that “seeing more” is to meaningful, i.e. “useful” “seeing more” is to meaningful, i.e. “useful” initiatory experience.

This first is that no two relating to proxemic magic. This first is that no two people see the same thing, and the distance between people see the same thing, and the distance between what two individuals will see in the same reference what two individuals will see in the same reference space will become larger the more distant the space will become larger the more distant the cultures of the two observers are from each other.cultures of the two observers are from each other.The second is that “seeing more” within these The second is that “seeing more” within these proxemic environments is the “key” to true and proxemic environments is the “key” to true and meaningful LHP initiation.meaningful LHP initiation.The third point, although somewhat obtuse, is The third point, although somewhat obtuse, is that the ability to see more within a proxemic space that the ability to see more within a proxemic space is not solely relative to physical distance. Rather it is is not solely relative to physical distance. Rather it is bound to the proficiency and mastery of the Adept bound to the proficiency and mastery of the Adept in being able to perceive and synchronize one’s in being able to perceive and synchronize one’s consciousness with the elusive (to the normal consciousness with the elusive (to the normal developed senses) density of energies that occur developed senses) density of energies that occur between the interplay of consciousness and its between the interplay of consciousness and its environments.environments.“Knowledge must precede method”.

There is an immediate altering it to desired states. There is an immediate presumption here that you want or need some form presumption here that you want or need some form of alteration in the psychic fabric of your life. So of alteration in the psychic fabric of your life. So there must be a purpose and desire for change, and there must be a purpose and desire for change, and it must be real. The LHP has nothing to offer those it must be real. The LHP has nothing to offer those who are already sated. The “bubble” that this who are already sated.

And I am the same: I who am the Highest of Life”. And if Set is the Highest of Life, then obviously life itself if Set is the Highest of Life, then obviously life itself has to be important to Setians.
