The goal of all such processes is the enhancement of life/being in increasingly more enhancement of life/being in increasingly more focused ways. Simply stated, focused ways. Simply stated, EssentEssent = being. That = being. That Essent into EssenceEssent into Essence can be reduced to such a can be reduced to such a simple formula is a measure of its effectiveness and simple formula is a measure of its effectiveness and validity in initiatory pursuits focused on the validity in initiatory pursuits focused on the realization of being as it manifests moment to realization of being as it manifests moment to moment.moment.Essent into EssenceEssent into Essence is the journey toward, as is the journey toward, as well as the manifestation of the self in the immediate well as the manifestation of the self in the immediate present.

When one can see the positive, control it. When one can see the positive, constructive, and creative role fear often plays in life, constructive, and creative role fear often plays in life, it becomes nothing more and nothing less than it is: it becomes nothing more and nothing less than it is: a means for identifying potentially dangerous a means for identifying potentially dangerous situations and a tool for dealing with them.situations and a tool for dealing with them.5. 5.

This has a twofold aspect. The first (big “S”). This has a twofold aspect. The first aspect is using your will so that your Self comes to aspect is using your will so that your Self comes to do its will and your self becomes a something that is do its will and your self becomes a something that is overcome. This may be likened to the Nietzschean overcome. This may be likened to the Nietzschean idea of self-overcoming that is the path of the idea of self-overcoming that is the path of the ÜbermenschÜbermensch as described in as described in Thus Spoke Thus Spoke ZarathustraZarathustra..The second aspect has to do with becoming The second aspect has to do with becoming more conscious of your Self and less preoccupied more conscious of your Self and less preoccupied by your self. This coming to know your Self is by your self. This coming to know your Self is coming to know yourself as a divinity. This is the coming to know yourself as a divinity. This is the goal of magical and mystical initiation: to transform goal of magical and mystical initiation: to transform yourself from a common, everyday mortal into an yourself from a common, everyday mortal into an Scroll of SetScroll of Set - October 1996 - Page - October 1996 - Page 1313"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"immortal god whose consciousness and being immortal god whose consciousness and being manifest themselves in this world and in others.manifest themselves in this world and in others.Another way of looking at these two aspects is Another way of looking at these two aspects is to think of the dualities of becoming and being, of to think of the dualities of becoming and being, of doing and being, of action and consciousness. doing and being, of action and consciousness. These two aspects are not fundamentally different, These two aspects are not fundamentally different, as anyone undergoing initiation is always doing as anyone undergoing initiation is always doing both at the same time.both at the same time.To increase the consciousness of your Self will To increase the consciousness of your Self will increase the amount of will directed by your Self increase the amount of will directed by your Self that you manifest.

Thus these two aspects are but two sides of the Thus these two aspects are but two sides of the same coin. While one might see a bit more of Set in same coin. While one might see a bit more of Set in the consciousness aspect and a bit more of Horus in the consciousness aspect and a bit more of Horus in the will aspect, neither aspect exhausts a definition the will aspect, neither aspect exhausts a definition of these of these netersneters..Basic to an understanding of the Horus Basic to an understanding of the Horus neterneter is is an understanding of transcendental dualism. This an understanding of transcendental dualism. This term must be understood in its magical sense, and term must be understood in its magical sense, and this article will attempt to explain that.this article will attempt to explain that.However a phrase like “transcendental However a phrase like “transcendental dualism” is such a fancy turn of phrase that you dualism” is such a fancy turn of phrase that you can use it in a lot of places. If someone asks if can use it in a lot of places. If someone asks if Setians are Gnostic dualists, you can respond Setians are Gnostic dualists, you can respond knowingly: “Well, sort of. Actually we are knowingly: “Well, sort of. Actually we are transcendental dualists and thus don’t make a sharp transcendental dualists and thus don’t make a sharp distinction between the material and the spiritual that distinction between the material and the spiritual that the early Gnostics did.” Then don’t explain the early Gnostics did.” Then don’t explain “transcendental dualism”; let them wonder!“transcendental dualism”; let them wonder!Actually, like all great magical ideas, Actually, like all great magical ideas, transcendental dualism is easy to apprehend. transcendental dualism is easy to apprehend. Essentially transcendental dualism divides what can Essentially transcendental dualism divides what can be known into two categories: (1) knowledge of the be known into two categories: (1) knowledge of the world of appearances, and (2) knowledge of the world of appearances, and (2) knowledge of the world of the noumena (or the realm of pure world of the noumena (or the realm of pure consciousness).consciousness).By definition, the world of appearances is the By definition, the world of appearances is the natural world, and the world of the noumena is the natural world, and the world of the noumena is the non-natural world, i.e. the world of Setian non-natural world, i.e. the world of Setian consciousness. Many magicians also place Plato’s consciousness. Many magicians also place Plato’s Forms or the archetypes into the realm of the Forms or the archetypes into the realm of the noumena. The noumena is where unnatural things noumena. The noumena is where unnatural things dwell. Unnatural things like human freedom and dwell. Unnatural things like human freedom and therefore will dwell in the realm of the noumena.therefore will dwell in the realm of the noumena.You won’t find any freedom in the causal world You won’t find any freedom in the causal world of nature, in fact you know it exists only because of nature, in fact you know it exists only because you possess it - you can’t observe it anywhere you possess it - you can’t observe it anywhere scientifically.scientifically.Another unnatural thing is consciousness, that Another unnatural thing is consciousness, that is, consciousness is in the realm of the noumena. is, consciousness is in the realm of the noumena. Again you won’t see consciousness in the realm of Again you won’t see consciousness in the realm of the natural. You may see the manifestations of either the natural. You may see the manifestations of either will or consciousness in the world of nature - but will or consciousness in the world of nature - but you won’t see the things in themselves.you won’t see the things in themselves.Hence when we try to understand how the will Hence when we try to understand how the will works or how consciousness works, we use works or how consciousness works, we use symbolic tools. A great example is the Seal of Runa, symbolic tools. A great example is the Seal of Runa, which demonstrates the Nine Angles as a mode of which demonstrates the Nine Angles as a mode of apprehending consciousness.apprehending consciousness.Consciousness doesn’t work like things in Consciousness doesn’t work like things in nature: It does not undergo consistent cause and nature: It does not undergo consistent cause and effect relationships; it is not stuck in time like effect relationships; it is not stuck in time like natural objects, but can movenatural objects, but can move around quite freely. around quite freely.We learn about consciousness and will through We learn about consciousness and will through various techniques such as lucid dreaming, various techniques such as lucid dreaming, alchemical transformation, yogic practices and alchemical transformation, yogic practices and ceremonial magic.ceremonial magic.There are as many ways of discovering the There are as many ways of discovering the realm of the noumena as there are people. This is realm of the noumena as there are people. This is very important to keep in mind, since as a Left-Hand very important to keep in mind, since as a Left-Hand Path organization we never try to force another Path organization we never try to force another person to apprehend the noumena pursuant to some person to apprehend the noumena pursuant to some fixed formula.fixed formula.Given this brief exposition, let me return to the Given this brief exposition, let me return to the Horus Horus neterneter and the Order of Horus. Horus the and the Order of Horus. Horus the Elder is not the world of nature or the world of Elder is not the world of nature or the world of appearances. Following after the example of Magus appearances. Following after the example of Magus Webb, I will say that again: Horus the Elder is not Webb, I will say that again: Horus the Elder is not the world of nature or the world of appearances.the world of nature or the world of appearances.Rather Horus the Elder is that which breaks Rather Horus the Elder is that which breaks through the duality and allows communication and through the duality and allows communication and initiation to occur. If we could not become more initiation to occur. If we could not become more noumenal - if we could not manifest the noumenal noumenal - if we could not manifest the noumenal more and more, then we really would be unable to more and more, then we really would be unable to speak of initiation. Certainly, unless one were able speak of initiation. Certainly, unless one were able to move from the realm of the natural to the realm of to move from the realm of the natural to the realm of the noumena, psychecentric immortality and the the noumena, psychecentric immortality and the other goals of initiation would be absolutely other goals of initiation would be absolutely impossible.impossible.There are two major ways of breaking through There are two major ways of breaking through the duality. Historically these are referred to as the duality. Historically these are referred to as “revelation” and “magical intuition or attainment”.“revelation” and “magical intuition or attainment”.Essentially revelation is the “downward” path: Essentially revelation is the “downward” path: from the noumenal to the day-to-day world of from the noumenal to the day-to-day world of appearances. Examples of this are Crowley’s appearances. Examples of this are Crowley’s Book Book of the Lawof the Law or Dr. Aquino’s or Dr. Aquino’s Book of Coming Forth Book of Coming Forth by Nightby Night.

When you open yourself to of the noumena. When you open yourself to commune with a commune with a neterneter, you engage your magical , you engage your magical intuition.
