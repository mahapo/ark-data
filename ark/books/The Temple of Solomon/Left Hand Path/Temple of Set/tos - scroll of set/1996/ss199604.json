Here I will briefly outline the date with our thinking. Here I will briefly outline the alchemical dialectic as the primary lens through alchemical dialectic as the primary lens through which these concepts are viewed. I will then address which these concepts are viewed. I will then address the concept of evolution as it applies to the the concept of evolution as it applies to the becoming of our collective entities within [and becoming of our collective entities within [and including] the Temple.

This split, however, in seventeenth-century Europe. This split, however, is based upon two closely-related fallacies of more is based upon two closely-related fallacies of more ancient origin: (1) Zoroastrian dualism - which ancient origin: (1) Zoroastrian dualism - which informed the Christian idea of good and evil, God informed the Christian idea of good and evil, God and Devil, etc.; and, (2) the Gallenic Chain of Being and Devil, etc.; and, (2) the Gallenic Chain of Being that informed notions of unidirectional causality and that informed notions of unidirectional causality and change intrinsic to the Christian myth of the fallen change intrinsic to the Christian myth of the fallen man, and the modern myth of unilinear progress.man, and the modern myth of unilinear progress.Moving beyond good and evil, a Moving beyond good and evil, a dialecticdialectic epistemology is a far more dynamic and epistemology is a far more dynamic and sophisticated means for the human becoming to sophisticated means for the human becoming to understand his or her relationship to the universe. understand his or her relationship to the universe.

Namely these processes do not in particular. Namely these processes do not necessarily lead to improvement. The nineteenth necessarily lead to improvement. The nineteenth century notion of evolution as improvement is a century notion of evolution as improvement is a fallacy sprung from the aforementioned myth of fallacy sprung from the aforementioned myth of unilinear progress. In fact evolution is very good at unilinear progress.

So while the dualism of “natural” and “unnatural” may be a dualism of “natural” and “unnatural” may be a useful tool for understanding the basics of Setian useful tool for understanding the basics of Setian philosophy, we then need to expand this model to philosophy, we then need to expand this model to one of dialectic interaction between the physical, one of dialectic interaction between the physical, biological, and cultural orderings in the process of biological, and cultural orderings in the process of initiatory change.initiatory change.Culture is the most complex of these orderings Culture is the most complex of these orderings thus far.

One is that the this cultural evolutionary perspective. One is that the Temple structure will be continually modified as our Temple structure will be continually modified as our numbers increase. The Temple of less than 100 numbers increase.

It is important what is the difference between them? It is important to understand that evolutionary processes - even to understand that evolutionary processes - even those of the deliberate cultural variety - act upon those of the deliberate cultural variety - act upon groups of people and collective endeavors more than groups of people and collective endeavors more than individuals themselves. Evolutionary change is individuals themselves. Evolutionary change is collective change. While it may be informed by collective change. While it may be informed by individual contributions, evolution inevitably individual contributions, evolution inevitably transcends them. Evolution is what you contribute to transcends them. Evolution is what you contribute to your species, your tribe, your culture. Development your species, your tribe, your culture.

Don’t let it be forgotten that, ”Enochian”. Don’t let it be forgotten that, throughout their many workings, Edward Kelly throughout their many workings, Edward Kelly always insisted that these “Angels” were of the always insisted that these “Angels” were of the “fallen” variety and representative of the Powers of “fallen” variety and representative of the Powers of Darkness.

Magister Webb has Enochian alphabet was 21. Magister Webb has compared this to the Latin alphabet, also of 21 compared this to the Latin alphabet, also of 21 letters [the few words containing “k” being equally letters [the few words containing “k” being equally correctly spelt with “c”].correctly spelt with “c”].This should not surprise us, as Latin was very This should not surprise us, as Latin was very much the language of scholars in Dee’s day. He much the language of scholars in Dee’s day. He used it extensively himself, both in the titles of his used it extensively himself, both in the titles of his documents and also in substantial portions of the documents and also in substantial portions of the text. It is only natural that he should have employed text. It is only natural that he should have employed it as the basis of the Enochian jargon. It is also clear it as the basis of the Enochian jargon. It is also clear that Latin would have been the language of choice in that Latin would have been the language of choice in which to express his Word, as discussed in (1) which to express his Word, as discussed in (1) above.above.The structure of Enochian is not that of some The structure of Enochian is not that of some long-forgotten tongue lost in the mists of time; it is long-forgotten tongue lost in the mists of time; it is very much that of the time in which Dee lived. The very much that of the time in which Dee lived. The basic grammatical structure of Enochian [such as basic grammatical structure of Enochian [such as there is] also mirrors Latin so far as it goes.there is] also mirrors Latin so far as it goes.Further evidence for Enochian being an Further evidence for Enochian being an “artificial” language can be found in the fact that it “artificial” language can be found in the fact that it isn’t quite so unique as some occultists like to claim isn’t quite so unique as some occultists like to claim in their enthusiasm. Quite a few of its words are in their enthusiasm.

This was evidently not the same explained above. This was evidently not the same Word of SetWord of Set as had existed in Egypt. For one thing as had existed in Egypt. For one thing it referred to God and Angels and so forth instead it referred to God and Angels and so forth instead of Set, and for another it was expressed in English of Set, and for another it was expressed in English [or Enochian] and not Egyptian.[or Enochian] and not Egyptian.But these mysterious Keys which Dee But these mysterious Keys which Dee apprehended and interpreted in the Christian apprehended and interpreted in the Christian perspective of his day were something older and perspective of his day were something older and deeper than they appeared to be.

Mehen was introduced to me by Magister Webb, and may be known to you to me by Magister Webb, and may be known to you as the two-headed god: one head being that of Set as the two-headed god: one head being that of Set and the other of Horus. Thus Mehen represents the and the other of Horus. Thus Mehen represents the two aspects of the Egyptian religious system, Set two aspects of the Egyptian religious system, Set and Horus. Mehen may also indicate a way of and Horus. Mehen may also indicate a way of thinking about the nine-grade system as the Horus thinking about the nine-grade system as the Horus manifestation of initiation, and the Temple’s six-manifestation of initiation, and the Temple’s six-degree system as the Set manifestation of initiatory degree system as the Set manifestation of initiatory progress.progress.Hopefully this article has shown that the two Hopefully this article has shown that the two degree/grade systems may be complementary, much degree/grade systems may be complementary, much like the two heads of Mehen, and need not be like the two heads of Mehen, and need not be viewed as competing. Also this article suggests that viewed as competing. Also this article suggests that the Temple might manifest a LHP A.'.A.'., which the Temple might manifest a LHP A.'.A.'., which would increase the initiatory opportunities available would increase the initiatory opportunities available to members of the Temple of Set.

Two possibilities present individual spiritual origin. Two possibilities present themselves: one, that the Black Flame within each of themselves: one, that the Black Flame within each of us existed independently prior to our physical us existed independently prior to our physical conception; and two, that the Black Flame of our conception; and two, that the Black Flame of our being manifested at the time of our conception.being manifested at the time of our conception.The possibility of transmigration of the Black The possibility of transmigration of the Black Flame does not coincide with what we have Flame does not coincide with what we have discovered about our individual discovered about our individual baba. We do not have . We do not have conscious memory beyond this existence, and if our conscious memory beyond this existence, and if our baba existed prior to birth, then surely one of us existed prior to birth, then surely one of us would have discovered it by now. I have never heard would have discovered it by now. I have never heard from a Setian who expressed such an experience. from a Setian who expressed such an experience.

To explore somehow with our physical conception. To explore this phenomenon we must examine the process of this phenomenon we must examine the process of procreation on both and objective and subjective procreation on both and objective and subjective levels.levels.On an objective level you have two individuals On an objective level you have two individuals coming together in a cooperative act of physical coming together in a cooperative act of physical love. This act is prompted by an instinctive desire to love. This act is prompted by an instinctive desire to reproduce and sustain the survival of the species.

They are prompted by a desire to make their of love. They are prompted by a desire to make their two separate beings become a cooperative one, if two separate beings become a cooperative one, if only for a few precious moments. At the point of only for a few precious moments. At the point of climax during the oneness that coincides with the climax during the oneness that coincides with the physical orgasm, a spark is created between the two physical orgasm, a spark is created between the two Black Flames. This spark grows into a now Black Black Flames. This spark grows into a now Black Flame that will develop into its own individual, self-Flame that will develop into its own individual, self-sustained existence.sustained existence.If we compare this process to the definition of If we compare this process to the definition of Black Magic, then the answer is obvious. The Black Magic, then the answer is obvious. The subjective and objective are brought together, subjective and objective are brought together, through the will of the parents, to produce a reaction through the will of the parents, to produce a reaction that manifests in a new human being - one with a that manifests in a new human being - one with a physical body well suited to this objective world, physical body well suited to this objective world, that is controlled by a soul that is purely non-that is controlled by a soul that is purely non-natural. Hence the act of procreation is by definition natural. Hence the act of procreation is by definition a Black Magical working. We are the result of a Black Magical working. We are the result of Black Magic.Black Magic.When we apply this theory to the Egyptian When we apply this theory to the Egyptian figure of the figure of the SamtauiSamtaui, we are offered a now , we are offered a now perspective.

The representation of HarWer and Set combined in one form is not only symbolic of the combined in one form is not only symbolic of the unification of northern and southern Egypt, or of the unification of northern and southern Egypt, or of the combined powers of the subjective and object combined powers of the subjective and object universe, but it is also a perfect symbol of the universe, but it is also a perfect symbol of the combination of the material and spiritual union that combination of the material and spiritual union that is the unique position of the human condition.is the unique position of the human condition.The The SamtauiSamtaui does honor to the glory of the does honor to the glory of the Black Flame within man, and displays how we are Black Flame within man, and displays how we are like unto Set.
