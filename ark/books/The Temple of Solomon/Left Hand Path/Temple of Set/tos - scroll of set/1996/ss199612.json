To call ourselves “Satanists” when we are the Temple call ourselves “Satanists” when we are the Temple of Set is similar to a Buddhist describing herself as of Set is similar to a Buddhist describing herself as a “Satanist” because fundamental Christians a “Satanist” because fundamental Christians believe that all non-Christian gods are “Satan”. believe that all non-Christian gods are “Satan”. Buddhists call themselves “Buddhists”, and we Buddhists call themselves “Buddhists”, and we should call ourselves “Setians”. Why denigrate should call ourselves “Setians”. Why denigrate ourselves by using Christian terminology?ourselves by using Christian terminology?Of course we know that the “Satan” of the Of course we know that the “Satan” of the Temple of Set is not the same Temple of Set is not the same neterneter as the Christian as the Christian and Judaic “fallen angel”.

It has been a major LBM working “Satanist” label. It has been a major LBM working for me to resolve my personal confusion and for me to resolve my personal confusion and conflicts regarding the use of this term by the conflicts regarding the use of this term by the Temple. I have been forced by the Black Flame of Temple. I have been forced by the Black Flame of Set to examine these issues [something I now Set to examine these issues [something I now realize that I have always put in the “too hard realize that I have always put in the “too hard tray”], and to finally resolve to my own satisfaction tray”], and to finally resolve to my own satisfaction the Yahweh/Satan conundrum.the Yahweh/Satan conundrum.I have tried to think up a positive “press I have tried to think up a positive “press release” refuting the Temple of Set’s connection release” refuting the Temple of Set’s connection with the Christian Satan and associated unacceptable with the Christian Satan and associated unacceptable behaviors, while still retaining the “Satanic” title, behaviors, while still retaining the “Satanic” title, but I have not been successful. It is not enough to but I have not been successful. It is not enough to simply say Satan is really Set, and the Christians simply say Satan is really Set, and the Christians and the Jews got it wrong. For example, we can say and the Jews got it wrong.

This fact is verified by European “Devil worship”. This fact is verified by thousands of documents from the trials of the thousands of documents from the trials of the Catholic Inquisition and the Protestant witch Catholic Inquisition and the Protestant witch persecutions, including accounts of witches’ persecutions, including accounts of witches’ relationships with Satan. There is also the infamous relationships with Satan. There is also the infamous affair and trial of “La Voisin”, the French witch affair and trial of “La Voisin”, the French witch who was executed for her satanic Black Masses and who was executed for her satanic Black Masses and child sacrifice.child sacrifice.The depressing conclusion I have come to from The depressing conclusion I have come to from considering the above is that no one can really considering the above is that no one can really escape the negative connotations of the term escape the negative connotations of the term “Satan”, and I must agree with Setian Carl Nicastro “Satan”, and I must agree with Setian Carl Nicastro when he says “the time has come to disassociate when he says “the time has come to disassociate ourselves from what is essentially an outdated, ourselves from what is essentially an outdated, overused, and misrepresentative term” (overused, and misrepresentative term” (ScrollScroll, , March 1995).

In my experience the substantial differences between experience the substantial differences between Chaos Magick and other forms of magic now Chaos Magick and other forms of magic now extant, fall into two distinct categories - paradigmal extant, fall into two distinct categories - paradigmal and practical.and practical.Practically speaking, CMT emphasizes the actual Practically speaking, CMT emphasizes the actual performance of magical acts upon oneself and one’s performance of magical acts upon oneself and one’s environment.

Sometimes the chaos magician may engage in a little Sometimes the chaos magician may engage in a little theory - like this article, for example - but the theory - like this article, for example - but the primary focus remains to obtain results.primary focus remains to obtain results.Paradigmally speaking, CMT never was nor ever Paradigmally speaking, CMT never was nor ever will be a “trad” (tradition), as I have seen it defined will be a “trad” (tradition), as I have seen it defined by several magicians on the Internet. I believe that by several magicians on the Internet. I believe that “trad” is just a synonym for “paradigm”. CMT “trad” is just a synonym for “paradigm”. CMT functions as a meta-paradigm, a shell (or shell functions as a meta-paradigm, a shell (or shell game) in which various outlooks can be game) in which various outlooks can be interchanged.interchanged.To define someone as a “chaos magician” To define someone as a “chaos magician” denotes a certain level of ignorance on the part of denotes a certain level of ignorance on the part of the speaker. A chaos magician never strictly exists the speaker. A chaos magician never strictly exists as a “chaos magician”. One does not live in a meta-as a “chaos magician”. One does not live in a meta-paradigm. A chaos magician may be a Satanist, paradigm. A chaos magician may be a Satanist, Pagan, or Thelemite. Why he differs from others Pagan, or Thelemite. Why he differs from others bearing the same title lies in the certainty that the bearing the same title lies in the certainty that the chaos magician will change paradigms after the one chaos magician will change paradigms after the one he currently practices has outlived its usefulness.he currently practices has outlived its usefulness.The “chaos magician” will also be using CMT The “chaos magician” will also be using CMT when it comes to working magic in that paradigm. when it comes to working magic in that paradigm. The latter difference - the use of CMT - does more The latter difference - the use of CMT - does more to set off the practitioner from others within the to set off the practitioner from others within the same paradigm than the tendency to move from one same paradigm than the tendency to move from one paradigm to another. Non-chaos magicians also paradigm to another. Non-chaos magicians also change paradigms on a regular basis, searching for change paradigms on a regular basis, searching for “enlightenment”, “truth”, “goddess”, or some “enlightenment”, “truth”, “goddess”, or some other term denoting the suicide of their curiosity.other term denoting the suicide of their curiosity.Chaos Magick and Why I do it After WorkChaos Magick and Why I do it After WorkChaos Magick consists of Chaos Magick consists of doingdoing.

The quality of that performance and the results you The quality of that performance and the results you obtain depend on one thing: Do you do it well?obtain depend on one thing: Do you do it well?CMT constitutes a meta-paradigm, a series of CMT constitutes a meta-paradigm, a series of techniques with no underlying beliefs. As such a techniques with no underlying beliefs. As such a chaos magician can never be quite defined as a chaos magician can never be quite defined as a “chaos magician”. I, for example, am a “nihilist “chaos magician”. I, for example, am a “nihilist Setian”. This distinction connotes that I believe in Setian”. This distinction connotes that I believe in the existence of an entity, known as “Set”, who was the existence of an entity, known as “Set”, who was responsible for human consciousness and magical responsible for human consciousness and magical ability. If I believe in Set and perform the techniques ability. If I believe in Set and perform the techniques of CMT well, I will get results with my magic. of CMT well, I will get results with my magic.
