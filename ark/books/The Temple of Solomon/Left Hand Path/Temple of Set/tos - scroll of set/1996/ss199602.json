To the definition of Setian the faculties to do so. To the definition of Setian pride, therefore, we not only cast away the words pride, therefore, we not only cast away the words “arrogance” and “contempt”, we can also add the “arrogance” and “contempt”, we can also add the words “dignity” and “nobility”, which will always words “dignity” and “nobility”, which will always be symptomatic of a pride derived from knowledge be symptomatic of a pride derived from knowledge of the higher self.
