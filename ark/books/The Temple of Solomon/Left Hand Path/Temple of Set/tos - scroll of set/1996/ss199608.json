Jung, whose writings opened an extremely deep G. Jung, whose writings opened an extremely deep well of inspiration for me. In many occasions Jung well of inspiration for me. In many occasions Jung spoke about the experiences that ultimately led him spoke about the experiences that ultimately led him to formulate his theory of the collective to formulate his theory of the collective unconscious.unconscious.One particular experience rang a very familiar One particular experience rang a very familiar tone within me. Jung claims that he became tone within me. Jung claims that he became conscious of two “levels” or “personalities” conscious of two “levels” or “personalities” within him already at a very early age. In his within him already at a very early age. In his autobiography entitled autobiography entitled Memories, Dreams, Memories, Dreams, ReflectionsReflections he uses terms “[personality] number he uses terms “[personality] number one” and “number two” to describe these levels of one” and “number two” to describe these levels of existence. “Number 1” was his ordinary self (or existence. “Number 1” was his ordinary self (or ego): the psychosomatic complex that we are ego): the psychosomatic complex that we are normally aware of, and which most people consider normally aware of, and which most people consider to be the only self. “Number 2” however, was to be the only self. “Number 2” however, was much more noble and mysterious. It had an almost much more noble and mysterious.

I have stated earlier that to step into possibilities. I have stated earlier that to step into phase with the Æonic resonance, certain conditions phase with the Æonic resonance, certain conditions apply. These conditions are recognition, activity, apply. These conditions are recognition, activity, creation, and will. In other writings I have postulated creation, and will. In other writings I have postulated that to step into phase as a direct resonator of the that to step into phase as a direct resonator of the Æonic force requires a 1:1 ratio. However this does Æonic force requires a 1:1 ratio. However this does not account for higher-ordered relationships with not account for higher-ordered relationships with the original resonant wave.the original resonant wave.Although the same conditions are presumably Although the same conditions are presumably necessary for any phasing to occur, within this necessary for any phasing to occur, within this paradigm there exist relationships of differing paradigm there exist relationships of differing density and magnitude. There is more than one density and magnitude. There is more than one direct phasing relationship. Let’s examine the direct phasing relationship. Let’s examine the concept of density and magnitude to being.concept of density and magnitude to being.One of the definitions of “density” is “the One of the definitions of “density” is “the quantity of energy in a specific area”. Within the quantity of energy in a specific area”. Within the phasing paradigm there will be differences in the phasing paradigm there will be differences in the resonator which will manifest as magnitudes of resonator which will manifest as magnitudes of activity. This density of energy means that there are activity. This density of energy means that there are more and less levels of energetic psychical, more and less levels of energetic psychical, biochemical activity within similar frameworks. The biochemical activity within similar frameworks. The higher the density within a specific area, the faster higher the density within a specific area, the faster the motion of that energy.the motion of that energy.With that foundation laid, let us take this With that foundation laid, let us take this concept to another level. If phasing is the equivalent concept to another level. If phasing is the equivalent of a 1:1 ratio with the resonant wave, what would the of a 1:1 ratio with the resonant wave, what would the condition be of a higher-ordered phasing condition be of a higher-ordered phasing relationship?relationship?Given that a higher-ordered phasing relationship Given that a higher-ordered phasing relationship displays a denser activity, and that such activity has displays a denser activity, and that such activity has as its core a faster motion of energy, then in relation as its core a faster motion of energy, then in relation to a resonance construct – in order to maintain our to a resonance construct – in order to maintain our direct connection with the resonance – we direct connection with the resonance – we mustmust deal deal with octaves of the 1:1 premise. This means that a with octaves of the 1:1 premise. This means that a condition of higher ordered phasing is a 1:8 ratio in condition of higher ordered phasing is a 1:8 ratio in terms of a proportional synchronicity with the terms of a proportional synchronicity with the resonance.resonance.The implications are important for the The implications are important for the manifestation of the Æon. They are also important manifestation of the Æon. They are also important in understanding the subtleties of unison and in understanding the subtleties of unison and harmonic resonators. Higher densities equate to harmonic resonators. Higher densities equate to faster energetic motions. Resonance is also faster energetic motions. Resonance is also dependent upon motions. The faster the motions, the dependent upon motions. The faster the motions, the faster the resonant frequency. We have faster the resonant frequency. We have moremore energy within the same proxemic area. So when we energy within the same proxemic area.

I have relationships of the synchronicity to resonate. I have mentioned two characteristics of a synchronous mentioned two characteristics of a synchronous resonant analogue, i.e. density and triadic resonant analogue, i.e. density and triadic comprehension. Now let us examine a somewhat comprehension. Now let us examine a somewhat bigger picture of this scheme, and hopefully this will bigger picture of this scheme, and hopefully this will provide some insight into the functionality of an provide some insight into the functionality of an analogous resonant relationship.analogous resonant relationship.An “analogue” is that which bears a An “analogue” is that which bears a resemblance or proportion to that to which it is resemblance or proportion to that to which it is compared. It is simply a characteristic which compared. It is simply a characteristic which corresponds to another characteristic of the thing corresponds to another characteristic of the thing perceived.perceived.The first implication presented here is that an The first implication presented here is that an analogue is not identical to another, only that it analogue is not identical to another, only that it shares aspects with it. In a geometric paradigm shares aspects with it. In a geometric paradigm “analogous” refers to proportion and an equality of “analogous” refers to proportion and an equality of ratios. In reference to resonant relationships a 1:1 ratios. In reference to resonant relationships a 1:1 ratio is a proportionate and synchronous “stepping ratio is a proportionate and synchronous “stepping into” the consciousness, perceived as “ideas” into” the consciousness, perceived as “ideas” relevant to the Form of that resonance.relevant to the Form of that resonance.Similarly a 1:2 relationship is equal. The Similarly a 1:2 relationship is equal. The difference is that its density - the amount of energy difference is that its density - the amount of energy accumulated in a given proxemic area - is much accumulated in a given proxemic area - is much greater.greater.A 1:8 relationship is a quadruple-ordered octave A 1:8 relationship is a quadruple-ordered octave of the 1:1 manifestation. It is still proportionate; it of the 1:1 manifestation. It is still proportionate; it just contains more energy than the previous just contains more energy than the previous configurations.configurations.But the energy at all levels has - in terms of the But the energy at all levels has - in terms of the Æonic resonant metaphor - partaken of all the Æonic resonant metaphor - partaken of all the elements of phasing and synchronization to the elements of phasing and synchronization to the Æonic wave.Æonic wave.The differences between these proportionate The differences between these proportionate responses and relationships brings us back to some responses and relationships brings us back to some of the basic concepts I have presented in some of of the basic concepts I have presented in some of the earlier essays in this “resonance” series. Ideas the earlier essays in this “resonance” series. Ideas and reality are both aspects of energy. Higher-and reality are both aspects of energy. Higher-ordered relationships, by absolute necessity, ordered relationships, by absolute necessity, manifest in a more dynamically-active relation to the manifest in a more dynamically-active relation to the Æonic resonance, to ideas and to reality.Æonic resonance, to ideas and to reality.If comprehension is based upon knowledge of If comprehension is based upon knowledge of two discrete systems - as in resonance - then higher-two discrete systems - as in resonance - then higher-ordered (denser) relationships with those systems ordered (denser) relationships with those systems will result in “seeing more” within the same will result in “seeing more” within the same perceptual and cognitive frameworks we, as humans, perceptual and cognitive frameworks we, as humans, all share. “Seeing more” is the qualification for all share. “Seeing more” is the qualification for meaningful initiatory experience at all levels of meaningful initiatory experience at all levels of being, and “doing more” is to the synchronicity to being, and “doing more” is to the synchronicity to resonate as “seeing more” is to meaningful, useful resonate as “seeing more” is to meaningful, useful initiatory experience. The former extends and initiatory experience. The former extends and prolongs the Æon; the latter extends and prolongs prolongs the Æon; the latter extends and prolongs the self.the self.So we have revealed here the true function So we have revealed here the true function (“seeing more”) of the Form (Æonic resonance). (“seeing more”) of the Form (Æonic resonance). We can also say that within common patterns of We can also say that within common patterns of perception there can exist differing levels of perception there can exist differing levels of comprehension based upon the “density” of comprehension based upon the “density” of energy within those “common patterns”. Invariably energy within those “common patterns”. Invariably it is willed activity which creates the composition of it is willed activity which creates the composition of being that ultimately manifests into the “proper time being that ultimately manifests into the “proper time period” of the synchronous energy of Æonic period” of the synchronous energy of Æonic resonance.resonance.As analogues, higher-ordered phasing presents As analogues, higher-ordered phasing presents some unique opportunities in understanding the some unique opportunities in understanding the dynamism of noumenal relationships. “Stepping dynamism of noumenal relationships. “Stepping into the proper time period” of the æonic resonance into the proper time period” of the æonic resonance impacts the objective universe by manifesting works impacts the objective universe by manifesting works which are relevant to the Æon at large and to the which are relevant to the Æon at large and to the Word(s) in particular.Word(s) in particular.Harmonic works - largely accomplished by Harmonic works - largely accomplished by individuals individuals notnot consciously involved with the consciously involved with the temporal locus of the Æon - present aspects of the temporal locus of the Æon - present aspects of the Æon and/or of the Word(s) via print/audio/visual Æon and/or of the Word(s) via print/audio/visual media manifest into the public domain.

To illustrate it might be helpful acoustic phenomena. To illustrate it might be helpful to briefly consider some of the basic attributes of to briefly consider some of the basic attributes of sound in general.sound in general.Most often a single musical note will have: (1) a Most often a single musical note will have: (1) a dominant frequency (sometimes expressed as dominant frequency (sometimes expressed as wavelength), which we perceive as pitch, (2) wavelength), which we perceive as pitch, (2) Scroll of SetScroll of Set - August 1996 - Page - August 1996 - Page 1010"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"amplitude or loudness, (3) an amplitude envelope, amplitude or loudness, (3) an amplitude envelope, which defines how the sound starts, sustains, and which defines how the sound starts, sustains, and stops, and (4) timbre, or the subjective tonal quality stops, and (4) timbre, or the subjective tonal quality which is dependent upon the objective harmonic which is dependent upon the objective harmonic content of the sound.content of the sound.To experience these qualities on a substantial To experience these qualities on a substantial level, I offer a simple mental exercise: Hum a level, I offer a simple mental exercise: Hum a musical note three times in succession, then keeping musical note three times in succession, then keeping the pitch of that note firmly in mind, imagine the pitch of that note firmly in mind, imagine hearing that same note struck three times on a piano, hearing that same note struck three times on a piano, then hearing it strummed on a guitar, then played on then hearing it strummed on a guitar, then played on any succession of musical instruments which your any succession of musical instruments which your imagination conjures. Each instrument, though imagination conjures. Each instrument, though playing the same note, evokes a different subjective playing the same note, evokes a different subjective reaction.reaction.In speaking of these basic qualities of musical In speaking of these basic qualities of musical sounds, I further point out that there are very precise sounds, I further point out that there are very precise mathematical relationships inherent in the mixture of mathematical relationships inherent in the mixture of frequencies and harmonics. Pythagoras even spoke frequencies and harmonics. Pythagoras even spoke of the music of the spheres when describing his of the music of the spheres when describing his harmonic theories of the universe. Likewise there harmonic theories of the universe. Likewise there are precise mathematical ratios between the are precise mathematical ratios between the individual notes within a musical scale, and between individual notes within a musical scale, and between the individual notes which comprise chords. When the individual notes which comprise chords. When notes and chords are combined into melodies and notes and chords are combined into melodies and harmonies, and elements of rhythm are added, the harmonies, and elements of rhythm are added, the complexity elevates to a level whereby a major act of complexity elevates to a level whereby a major act of creation comes into being: a song is born!creation comes into being: a song is born!I postulate that this act of creation is made I postulate that this act of creation is made possible by the underlying mathematical precision possible by the underlying mathematical precision present in the objective structure of music, in that it present in the objective structure of music, in that it parallels the geometric relationships expressed in parallels the geometric relationships expressed in visual symbols such as the Pentagram of Set. Thus visual symbols such as the Pentagram of Set. Thus just as the Pentagram of Set is a vital visual gateway just as the Pentagram of Set is a vital visual gateway out of the objective universe, so also should music out of the objective universe, so also should music be capable of being utilized as an aural gateway.be capable of being utilized as an aural gateway.I know that this is possible because magicians I know that this is possible because magicians routinely use selected music to help create and routinely use selected music to help create and sustain a desired subjective universe in a ritual sustain a desired subjective universe in a ritual context. The choice of ritual music is extremely context. The choice of ritual music is extremely personal for each Black Magician, because it not personal for each Black Magician, because it not only resonates with, but actually helps create certain only resonates with, but actually helps create certain harmonic qualities of the magician’s subjective harmonic qualities of the magician’s subjective universe.universe.I might add that one of my personal areas of I might add that one of my personal areas of interest is the use of electronically-synthesized interest is the use of electronically-synthesized music and sound to produce specific music and sound to produce specific psychoacoustic effects. Of the many strange and psychoacoustic effects. Of the many strange and wondrous attributes of electronic music, foremost is wondrous attributes of electronic music, foremost is the ability to conjure “other-worldly” sounds, i.e. the ability to conjure “other-worldly” sounds, i.e. sounds which lie outside of the conventional sounds which lie outside of the conventional resources of the objective universe, thus pulling the resources of the objective universe, thus pulling the magician outside of the objective universe in order magician outside of the objective universe in order to participate in the aural experience.to participate in the aural experience.Music manifests itself in yet another way in the Music manifests itself in yet another way in the world of some magicians (myself included).
