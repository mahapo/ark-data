[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Practice Divinity in Your Own LifeDon WebbUncle Setnakt would like you to consider how you are already practicing divinityin your own life. The Right Hand Path says your life is ruled by a mechanical law,called karma or the will of god. We feel that your life is ruled by a mechanical lawcalled the path of least resistance and that law can be overcome by consciousbeings. This work helps you detect how you have already overcome this law andhow much there still is to discover and integrate into your mind.1. Analyze an intentional change you've made. Take something you did withawareness and desire (as opposed to some adaptation that circumstancesforced you to make). Say for example a decision to move to a new home,because the new home offered you opportunities for privacy. See how you haveprospered by obtaining your goals in a rational manner. Now analyze the sameevent looking for supra-rational benefits you have gained -- good things (andopportunities for growth) that have come into your life directly from your willeddecision, but which in no way could be predicted as logically following.Analyze enough of your life and you will discover that when you have put thesethings into motion with your will you have exceeded mechanical chance.Concentrate these feelings of power in your life -- link the incidents one toanother in your mind.2. Analyze a moment of pure creativity. Take something you've made for noutilitarian reason. Doodles drawn while on the phone are excellent. Why did youenjoy making this pattern? Why is there happiness at creation?The joy of creation makes little if any biological sense, but makes a great deal ofsense if we discover our being through our creativity. This is directly opposed tothe, \"No graven images.\" commandment. Become aware of how important it is tobe a Creator.3. Make note of those things that become self-sustaining. Note when anysuggestion you've made becomes policy seemingly against the odds. I'm nottalking about something you brought about in a normal work-a-day fashion, butthose ideas of yours that came into being on their own.For example you casually suggest a change in the way your cleaners handletheir merchandise tracking. Although they tell you that they can't do wha t yousay; next time you return your policy is in place. Each of these incidents showsthat you have powers beyond the mechanical processes of the world.Note each and come to see yourself as a creator of movement in the world."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4. Pray to yourSelf. Look through your life to find some prayers that wereanswered by the Right Hand Path god of your choice.Maybe one day you prayed for your car to start, or for health to return, or to getluck on a date. As well as you possibly can remember the words and practices.Then when you are in the same situation repeat that prayer -- except entirely toyourSelf, making references to no god but you. Continue this practice until youhave results. Come to see yourself as the cause for all seeming miracles in yourlife. It is you, the self created god, not some divinely appointed destiny.5. Encourage the worship of yourself by others. Now don't be a prig about itlike IHVH -- don't insist on no gods but me -- etc. Certainly don't be a jealousgod, you can help others in their self deification. Be sure you have a nice birthdayparty, that others have chance to praise you when you do well etc. Then whenyou've created a little friend and fan club, begin to practice the simple LesserBlack Magic of telling the story that people who do good things for you have goodthings happen to them (and the converse -- eventually these people'sunconscious Greater Black Magic will make this a condition of the world).Continue this practice at least until you can discover that some good has comeyour way because some one you do not know (directly) has been told you're aworthy individual by some one else you do not know directly. This will show thatyour presence is equal in force to any mankind's created gods â€“ that faith in youis strong to create a missionary movement. Of course this should be donesecretly and subtly. If you outwardly proclaim your godhood crucifixion can result.Christianity may be understood as one self deified individual letting his practicesget out of hand. Jesus is an example of a Black Magician without ethics.6. Practice your godhood among your followers. When one of your fans is introuble, magically use the Power of your Name to help him. Not out of pity orcompassion but to Understand the nature of the name of a divine being. Onceagain keep this practice to yourself. Do this until you have results. This illustratesthe power of the Word of Moses IHVH in which a fan club or political/culturalorganization can create laws beyond the natural, an identity, and a bargainingposition with the unknown by use of a Name. This not only produces an objectivechange in the world as an example of your own divinity, it will begin to illustratethe power of the word to open new potentials of power within you. This practice ishighly recommended for someone who wishes to use words to explorehimSelf/herSelf through such means as the Enochian Aethyrs. Be sure you haveresults here first.7. Mythologize your birth in the manner of Christ, Buddha, Zoroaster etc.Learn to see your physical birth as the manifestation of the divine. You may wishto use a number of different masks in this. See yourself as a tribal hero returned,a god incarnated, or a visitor from another world. Play with these mythologies --remembering to discard them once they've awakened in you the true knowledge"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that you are beyond the circumstances of flesh and history.Seek out the facts of your birth to feed your mythology with facts, create a mentallist of all the historical things that had to happen in order for you to be born.; Forexample in Uncle Setnakt's case the Irish potato famine and the temporaryexistence of an ice bridge. These stories will allow you to work upon yourSelf andthe world from the same basis as the aforementioned magi, but it will keep youfrom losing yourself to any mythology not of your creation (or recreation).8. Create other beings. One of the signs of godhood is the ability to create otherbeings. Look through traditional magic systems concerning such creations --whether the Judaic Golems or the Tibetan tulpa -- create an entity to accomplisha certain task and then return itself to you and offer itself up as sacrifice to yourgodhead. Watch without otherwise interfering in this task is accomplished andwhen it is await the return of the created one. You'll discover that you can createself willed entities and eventually you may wish to create and not absorb them.This will prove that you have all the powers of a god, and will direct yourcreations toward the cause of human freedom rather than any short termpurposes. And even then you will birth a few monsters.9. After you've become aware of your godhood announce it to all theworlds within and without. Perform a ritual after your fashion in which the message is, \"I abrogate all rituals except those I create. There is no magic done in any galaxy save that it empowers me -- this is the law of the only true god! I am the measure of beauty, there is no beauty except through me. I am the Truth, I am the Way, I am the Life. There are no gods before me, there is no power equal to my desire. I have always existed and by the power of my Name I am come to full awareness. All the universe is destroyed and re-created bearing the mark of what is newly of me. Naught exists save to teach me, to please me, and to give me a cutting edge to my own Becoming. The dead gods of mankind arise to do me homage and I blow them away like dust when their play called history has offered all it can to me.Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
