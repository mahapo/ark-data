[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"On Setby Tapio KotkavuoriPriest of SetThis article was originally published in The Scroll of Set Jan-Feb, 1998 CE.For me, Set is the Principle of Isolate Intelligence, who gave mankind the Gift of selfconsciousnessin pre-historic times in order to strengthen his own Being, and in order togive mankind the possibility to self-conscious, invidividual existence.Self-consciousness is a feature that separates human beings from natural universe.Because of this feature we are able to take into consideration in our actions past, presentand future, to make notions about good and evil, give meaning and purpose to things, toeffect the universe according to our own will, and to experience existence as selfconsciousindividuals. Whereas natural universe is predictable, human beings havepossibility to act unpredictably, to be free Beings. Set is the metamodel for suchindividual existence.My relationship to Set is that of mutual respect in enhancing and exalting his Gift of selfconsciousness.I do not pray nor ́worship ́ Set. Set does not tell me what is ́good ́ and ́evil ́; it is my own responsibility to reason ethical (and other) questions and actaccording to that reasoning. I take full responsibility for my actions.When I communicate with Set, I do not lose my individuality, but become strenghtenedby him in my self-consciousness and Initiatory (Self developing) Work. As a Priest of SetI seek to enhance the possibility for individual, self-conscious, autonomous potential ofmankind to actualize within the Temple of Set, and without it as well as appropriate - thisdoes not include any kind of converting; by its very nature the need for individual selfbettermentmust come from within an individual himself. No one can do such a work forothers, only for oneself.Reality of Set is not based on mere knowledge or on mere intuition. It is based on both,but it is essentially via rationally based intuition, my own conscious efforts to understandmy own Self, via my own conscious efforts to Come Into Being as a more perfect, moreautonomous individual, that I have Experienced the Principle, that it has becomeNecessary for my own Initiation (Self development process) and Self- understanding.Set will not be known to those who try to approach him with blind faith or with strictscientific method. Possibility to come to know Set will raise only through exercise ofone's own Will, rationally based honest inquiry on one's Self and on Set as the metamodelfor self-conscious, autonomous, individual Being.One of our senior Initiates wrote a good summary about the nature of Set:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I. Set is the Principle of Isolate Intelligence.II. It is dynamic (evolving).III. Its purpose is self- maintenance, expansion, and perpetuation. This is its only good -otherwise it is beyond good and evil.IV. It is not omnipotent - it must work for the changes it causes.V. It is not omniscient - it must work to see objectively.VI. Its Gift of Self is perfect (complete).VII. It can inform or \"teach\" those possessed of its quality.VIII.To give more (if possible) would be to take.IX. The presense of the Gift in us (flesh) is necessary to the evolution of the Principle ofIsolate Intelligence.Great is the Might of Set, Greater still he through us.Xeper."}]
