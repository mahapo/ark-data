[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Become Evil and Rule the World:1Don WebbIt's the Silver Anniversary of Satanism. We see Indulgence -- albeit unconscious– in all levels of our society, and we are beginning to see Xeper manifest in theworld. So it's time we took seriously the task of becoming evil to rule the World.1. Develop a strong memory. This will aid in a variety of Lesser and GreaterBlack Magic endeavors. In Lesser Black Magic (LBM) we know that leadershipcomes from position (you're the foreman and everyone listens to you), charisma(you've got a forceful personality or looks), or knowledge (you're the oneeveryone consults). Developing memory, which is largely a matter of practice, willopen that third position. Become group historian. You'll be surprised at thecontrol you have by simply remembering what was said, done, or what you read.As historian others will seek you to be sure you know their side of things, whichprovides a tremendous opportunity for manipulation. Finally, when yourmemory/knowledge becomes accepted as an authority, you can manipulate thepast for your own best interests. The Greater Black Magic (GBM) uses ofmemory are beyond the scope of this essay. The accomplished magicians outthere know what I mean -- for the beginners, developing memory for GBM is likedeveloping leg muscles for ballet.2. Develop a thick skin. Don't get me wrong you can smite people on the othercheek all you want. Effective revenge requires intelligence and information aboutyour target. Learn to let things bounce off. This way when your revenge comes, itcomes from an unexpected source you strike at an undefended area. Likewise –if you're a snake in the grass -- people will be careless around you. They won'twatch what they say or reveal. Of course, putting off your revenge will give youtime to reconsider. Perhaps the offender did his work out of stupidity rather thanmalice. Do not take revenge against the stupid. It is beneath you. Insteaddiscover how to make the stupid one your tool. This not only saves energy(magical and otherwise) but increases your sphere of control in the world.3. Develop instant sanctuaries. The Black Magician is in a state of constantstress. She is moving apart from the stream of the world. She has recognizedand works with change as part of her being. To keep from wilting under thepressure, she needs retreats -- points of rest and preservation. The Satanistmust live strategically -- if it is a helpful metaphor, consider the world as abattlefield. Sanctuaries can be a safe place at work, a song invested with specialmeaning, or a picture of the wife and kids. It can be anything that enables you togather your forces and renew your focus. In the middle of a campaign you canshift your attention briefly to the sanctuary. Draw in a quiet cold breath (as thoughfrom the very womb of Hel) and return refreshed. Be content in your knowledgethat your opponent lacks such places of power. Magicians wishing to explore theconcepts of rest and preservation in a world of change are referred to Alvin"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Toffler's Future Shock and Eric Hoffer's The Ordeal of Change.4. Recognize and align yourself with Aeonic currents. The word of the Aeonis Xeper -- come into being. As the new Aeon itself comes into being, historicaland political forces will also come into being. Certain cultural artifacts appear witha predisposition to individualism (such as the skateboard and the personalcomputer). If you seek out these phenomena not only will your personal Xepergrow as you WORK (and work) with them -- the phenomena will in turn beempowered by your touch. And as the Aeon grows your connections with itsexternal manifestations will move you into a position where you can influence theworld more and more. Certain manifestations of Xeper which are visible. socialtherapy changing from total care to empowerment, the ending ofcollectivist/communistic systems, the development of drugs and therapies toincrease one's active/effective life by decades, the growing availability of expertknowledge through the computer net. Magicians interested in Aeonic history maywish to consult S. Edred Flower's latest book, Fire And Ice. Even if you can'twork with these things -- marvel at them, for Wonder stirs the GBM latent ineveryone's soul.5. Recognize and dismantle Aeonic hindrances. As a new Aeon comes in, theold has a dying rush of activity. Examples of this can be found in the extremismof Rumania's last dictator or the fundamentalist pornography of the Satanscareindustry. Whether or not you are a public Satanist, it behooves you to know thefacts and to dismantle (logically and gently) the propaganda of your friends,neighbors, and associates. As the remnants of the old Aeon -- this is to say,spiritual toxic waste -- are cleared away, your magic will have progressively lessresistance to overcome, and your personal safety will be enhanced. My nephew,the Daimon Egan, recommends the particularly useful Satanism in America: Howthe Devil Got Much More Than His Due for dismantling such hindrances.6. Recognize the possibility of immortality in seeming setbacks. Manypeople along the path confuse magic with magical thinking. These people arealways expecting a trouble-free life: no flat tires, winning the big one, anddecidedly fewer red lights. Whereas Xeper often reveals its presence throughbeneficial synchronicity, we are still constrained by the natural order. One of thegreat mysteries of Satanism is how the inward force evolves through the mediumof internal and external necessity. Necessity presents a challenge, for examplewe were overlooked for a job promotion. The magical thinker would go buy aspell kit. He waves his wand and sprinkles gold lodestone sand and holds hismouth just right. He attributes his failure to \"having done the ritual wrong.\" Wework to change the promotion process. When we have changed the process, wenot only have performed the magical act of getting the job we want, but also wehave changed an aspect of the world to reflect our internal order. We have putpart of ourselves in the minds of others -- a functional part of ourselves has beenplaced in the world because we used the level the natural order presented us.This type of immortality (living on in the thoughts of others) is actually open toeveryone. I sometimes weep that the RHP has stolen this truth from so many."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7. Detach yourself from the natural order by ending boredom. Students ofGurdjieff won't be surprised when I say that we spend most of our lives asleep.Being asleep means we are moved on by the world machine. The mostdeadening form of sleep is boredom. We can spend large amounts of time in themost banal activities -- reading yesterday's newspapers, slack-jawed watching ofLaverne and Shirley reruns. Use the word of Indulgence to end this zombiehood.Next time you find yourself sinking into a gray numbness, remember -- \"I am hereand I deserve better for I become as a god.\" Exquisite pleasures and legalperversions will bring life back to you. If you practice Indulgence to replace sleep,the red energy of life will pulse through you. Sleeping Beauty needs that kissbefore she can wake up and be Queen.8. Detach yourself from the natural order by ending guilt. The old Aeon'sstrongest tool was guilt. Guilt undercuts every individual thought/speech/action.Guilt is the promoter of group -think, because it tests everything against the groupstandards (perfect for the communistic/collectivist flavor of the last Aeon).Because we are under the programming of the old Aeon, we are prone to guilt, atbest a time waster and at worst a roadblock to our Work. When you feel yourselffalling into guilt, try using a magical motto to redirect your energy. I use, “If thisaction does not further my Xeper, my next action will overshadow this one. I payno homage to gods outside mySelf.\" As you progress on the Left Hand Path(LHP) you will unfortunately find those who have brought guilt with them.Whereas these people may develop their magical powers apart from the naturalorder, they will never fully enter into Selfhood. If you have a great deal of troublewith guilt, large doses of Nietzsche, Redbeard, or La Vey may be in order.9. Detach yourself from the natural order with time games. The calendar, theclock, and the computer have traditionally belonged to anti-individual entities.The Catholic Church, with its cycle of fasts and feasts and year of endlesssymbolism, stole time from the European people long ago. The Church of Satanbegan the reclaiming of time by declaring o f one's birthday as the supremeholiday. It's no coincidence that the flex time and work-at-home concepts havecome in with the New Aeon. Begin to arrange your own life as much as possibleby your schedules (and vary those lest you come up a different box of deadtime). As you do things by your own time – look upon the mindless world bustlingalong to the ticktock of the previous age. Feel yourself -- your individuality. And inthat sharp joyous moment of self awareness you will have begun to feel Set.Enough R&D for now, Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
