[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Runa- by Stephen E. Flowers V°October 1990Runa is that which is hidden, perpetually beyond the grasp of the intellect. By attaining to levels of Understanding of what was previously hidden, we push back the barriers and in the process create even greater mysteries beyond. This process is clear in science as well as art.As I Understand the current constellation of Æonic Words (Words within the Æon), Xeper is the process of evolution of Self in the quest for the elusive Graal/Walhalla (Xem), the mechanism is Remanifestation, the map is Thelema, Indulgence is all with which we even gain union, and Runa is that which lies outside or beyond our direct experience. It is the hunger for the Graal which drives the magician: the subtle sense of the unknown and the unknowable that motivates the magician ever onward.Runa is intimately attached to the circle or ring of nature - to the ring around the pentagram. It is a kind of magnetic ring, pulling a focus (the Self) through the Nine Angles. The points themselves - even before the current of energy reaches them - are Runa, the energy is Thelema, the Ninth Angle/Black Flame is Walhalla; the very process itself with all of these and yet unknown qualities is Xeper.The eternally Hidden draws us ever onward. The Hidden can sometimes be interpreted as the Feminine or the Darkness, but essentially it is the eternally-deep core reality which simultaneously pushes and draws us into the Unknown.The relationship between Runa and the ring is important to the Work of the Order of the Trapezoid with which the natural cosmos interacts according to the æsthetics and magical criteria of the Romantics. But that is the subject of another work.Runa, therefore, is obviously an Æon-enhancing Word rather than one intended to usher in a new æon. Its strong historical roots also suggest that it is a strangely non-linear, omnipresent Word which weaves in and out of time, Remanifesting according to a mysterious pattern.Runa is the Sense of the Unknown. This implies an element of subjectivity, which will have a different quality depending upon the level of Initiation of that Subject. For the non-Initiate, especially those on Paths other than the Left-Hand, there will be the element of horror and fear which will accompany the Unknown - once the seeker has delved to sufficient depths of Being.In the most basic level of our experience, Runa is that Sense of the Hidden - even of the Forbidden - which has perhaps motivated humanity more vitally than anything else. One of the greatest of all human drives is the drive to uncover the hidden, to discover that which was previously unknown. This is so obvious, yet it remains something largely unexplored as a Principle in and of itself. Ultimately this factor in the human psyche is that responsible for the actual reception of the Gift of Set: Set may have given, but some part of the receiver must already have been capable of receiving the Gift in a productive way. This factor remains with humanity, of course. Only now it is powered with the Gift and therefore can be conscious of this drive.As distinguished from some of the other Words which have been Uttered, Runa is one that is essentially comprehensible by all Setians regardless of degree, because some aspect of it has been experienced by all. It remains, however, something which can be Understood fully and completely for what it is only by the Magistry.We in the Temple have rightly been very mistrustful of “mystery” and “mysticism” - anything which smacks of the “unclear” or “fuzzy” - because such terms have been so abused by “mystics” of the past. What they may mean by “mystery” and what I mean by"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Runa are two different things. Runa does not lead to obscurity; rather it is the first step to clarity. Just as Socrates was declared the wisest man in all Hellas because he claimed to “know nothing” - as all knowledge begins with the assumption of ignorance - so too does clarity begin with a Sense of the Hidden. This is an eternal process: As we push back the veil of the Hidden in one field, that very act creates yet more fields of the Unknown beyond. In just such a way, if consciously applied, humanity exercises the god-like power of creation.The real function of Runa - of “mystery” - on the Left-Hand Path is the way in which it leads to the clarification or objectification of subjective/inner experience.Dangers: All æonic Words carry with them inherent dangers - to their Magi more than anyone else, but also to the world, as they will make alterations in the fabric of the Objective Universe. The danger of Runa is to become lost in the realm of subjectivity - in the sense of mystery. Its Magus, however, is aware of this and moreover finds himself in the company of fellow Masters of the Temple who, by their very Being, guard against this danger.Runa UltimaThe ultimate Rune is the objectification or objectifying of the ultimate subject. This would be the entry into the ring of Runa and the attainment of an “omnijective” perspective. The end and means of this are contained in Xeper, and the notion that the end/means constitute a return (qualitative) is Remanifestation. No amount of philosophizing on this topic or process can make one Understand what this means. It is something which must be the result of one’s own Initiatory level of Being coming directly to grips with the challenge. Although the concept of Runa can be comprehended by almost anyone and be understood by several, only those who have entered the City of the Pyramids can be said to truly Understand it.- 2 -"}]
