One of the Bokhor's primary tasks involves acquainting themselves with and eventually becoming intimate participants in the arena of inorganic awareness in its many forms. This along with the calculated development of the double, specialized Left Hand Path sex magic and a few other areas of emphasis will consume the Adept at this level of attainment until they are forcibly pushed to the next by the accumulation of their own power. What the sorcerer must come to understand in regard to the greater shifts of perception is that there is always a residual effect of each alteration in consciousness so that the deeper and longer one is immersed in the night side reahn of sorcery, the longer the subsequent time one will spend in the equivalent of that position as a polar opposite in the reahn of the ordinary day side world. Basically, the longer and deeper one descends into Nod, the more firmly they will cling to reason as a result of the snap back of the Black Adept's awareness to a place of stability and human assurance.

When we intentionally seek out a total and insulated intact magical system to immerse ourselves in, what we are basically doing is knowingly embodying new energetic configurations by keeping our perceptual fluidity in a constant state of subtle movement away from its customary alignment. This demands the \"having to believe\" of the sorcerer who knows that the belief is not as important as what the belief does. It alters the subjective consciousness. Non-ordinary be­havior causes \"shifts\" in the perception and makeup of the subjective realm so it follows that entering into a total black magically based belief system would present continual challenges to the sorcerer and thus force a series of methodical shifts to occur which would have the end result of expanding the sorcerer's perceptual capabilities. The more foreign the system the better as each challenge will hone the senses and give one greater strength and control.

Of course, we of the Left Hand Path have our plant allies, but we have found that this connection is one that must be groomed over a long period and does not have the jarring and often devastating effect of most power plant allies.

Black magic and tl1e Left Hand Path are misunderstood by so many, partic'Ularly those quick to identify themselves as belonging to this orientation and it is for this reason that we should start out with the fundamental core concepts on which the entire edifice of our infernal structure is based. There are those who catne before us and each of these contributed to \"\\vhat we know now. I shall gloss over many names and developments, choosing to only focus on these as they are immediately relative to the topic at hand, but I do advise the Black Adept to make a determined atld in depth study of the history of the diabolic way and its most important contributors. My early education in the realm of the occult began as is typical of most seekers beginning on their path. I sought out whatever I could pertaining to the mysteries of sorcery and first digested that which was most readily available. Very early on I obtained 111e Satat1ic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey as well as the works of Aleister Crowley, Dione Fortune and Israel Regardie. At this time in was difficult to procure occult material, which made the attraction and fascination all the more powerful. I began frequenting those strange dark shops which carried tl1e more obscure titles and within a few yeru·s time I had developed what I like to think of as a sound basic understanding of magic. Not wanting to fall into the category of \"annchair 13"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"magician,\" I soon set out manufacturing my own Enochain magical tools and studiously recording all my attempts at magic as well as the details of my dreams. In 1992 I was introduced to a Priest of Set nr from the Temple of Set while perusing through the most recent Chaos magic texts in the Magickal Childe located in NYC. My new acquaintance and I quickly became entrenched in conversation and soon found ourselves unable to pull away from the intellectual gnosis we were experiencing. It was truly and exchange of magic and energy and we decided to spend the rest of the evening continuing our engagement over food and coffee at a diner in Manhattan. This was truly my first exposure to the Left Hand Path and I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to it by a very talented and experienced Black Magician belonging to one of the most developed and active Left Hand Path magical orders in history. While I did eventually become immersed in the teachings and practices of the Temple of Set, I always considered myself a true Satanist and approached everything I did from this perspective. I formed a strong friendship with my new sorcery acquaintance and was eventually invited to participate in small group workings conducted by the local Temple of Set Pylon that my priest friend was dedicated to running with a few other advanced Adepts. I may have been a new comer to the Left Hand Path, but I was a disciplined magician all around and my years of beginner level n1agical practices gave me firm 14"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"grormd to stand upon as I embarked on this newer, much darker joumey. What I found most remarkable about the Left Hand Path as a total approach to life was that it openly acknowledged the placing of one's self above others and particularly above the concept of some distant spiritual entity. Religious piety and devotion has always repulsed me and I readily embraced the concept of relating to one's self as one's own god. Even though many of the Setians that I came to know regarded the Egyptian god Set as a very real, objective being, I was mostly able to bypass their theistic lerutings and take that which I found to resonate with my personal views of sorcery. The Temple of Set for me was a school of Black Magic during this period, and even though it seems to have lost much of its potency (and probably membership) over the last ten years or so, I will still present much of what I leamed and the material that I consider to have great importance for the developing Black l\\1agician. The founders of the Temple of Set took what they had deemed personally valuable from their origins in the Church of Satan and applied some of it as they began to structure the temple. Black magic, ritual and Left Hand Path philosophy were expanded on in entirely new ways hut the emphasis on the carnal nature of humanity was de-emphasized in favor of the active worship of the deity Set. Michael Aquino, the founder of the temple claimed a direct conscious connection to this god and explained that this relationship had grown out of his experiences with satanic rituals he had been 15"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"involved with in the Church of Satan. He experienced a kind of palpable presence during ritual ceremonies which he felt had to be attributed to an outside awareness of greater non-human consciousness. For Aquino this may have been Satan at that time, but it developed into the presence of Set and inspired several works, most notably the Book of Coming Forth by Night which was the result of a working of greater black magic he performed at the time of his breaking off \"\\Vith Anton I.-a Vey's Church of Satan. What I relished most about my Temple of Set years was working actively with other Black :Magicians towards common goals. Practicing sorcery in isolation can be the ideal situation for the Black Magician, however having experienced many group titual settings I find a value here that crumot be obtained if the sorcerer has never been immersed in group work. TI1e group ritual work that I was involved in was the closest thing that I could experience which mirrored my idealized personal proje.ctions of a true witches' Sabbath or black mass. These interactions gave me a much beti.er understanding of the dynamics of group ritual and the potency that a small or large group of Black Magicians could acWeve if they were aligned in their purpose and magical goals. However, like all good things in the reahn of human social interaction, this interactive time period in my development as a Black Magician would eventually end. It is very difficult to explain why the occult \"scene\" of the 1970's 16"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"through the mid to late 1990's was so extremely different than it is today, but I venture to say that the intemet and online communication is more than a bit responsible for turning what could once have been a shadowy labyrinth of magical discovery for the aspiring sorcerer and transforming it into a virtual wasteland of endless message board meaninglessness and incessant overexposure via instantaneous access to any seemingly creative occult stimulus imaginable. Black Magic is simply not a discipline that supports the prevalent habits of instant gratification and social sloppiness. As a sorcerer you will never acquire true power by becoming an online magical \"personality.\" In the Secret Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton, An­ton LaVey explains; 'There's great power in doing something that, at that moment in time, there is probably no one else in the world doing. If you listen to a piece of music that everyone was humming once, but which has been neglected over the years, your doing something unique, gaining energy from that 'lost' song.

Thus magic was seen as neither white nor black, but defined by how the sorcerer used it. Generally speaking, dark forces were petitioned for workings of a dark nature and the lighter forces were us ed for works seen as beneficial to all and good. However, this was not always the case as one's primary deities were often asked for a wide range of personal favors that could be considered evil from the standpoint of a modem white light view. No matter what the specific cultural differences were, eventually black magic came to be thought of in terms of e.vil and selfishness and white magic in terms of healing, community and good. The term Left Hand Path is thought to originate in the Tantric Buddhist schools. It is associated with the V ama Marga, or Left Path as it pertains to tantric sex magic of a dark, feminine nature with emphasis on the exploration of the perverse in attaining altered states and magical powers. In Michael Aquino's Black Magic he explains; \"The terms \"Left-Hand Path\" (LHP) and \"Right­Hand Path\" (RHP) are used in different and often incompatible ways by various occultists. Reportedly the terms originated in Tantrism, a school of Mahayna Buddhism in northern India which taught that Buddhahood can be realized through various theurgic practices. For mantra and mudra ceremonies the female was positioned to the 22"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"right of the male; for erotic rites she was positioned to the left. Theosophy's H.P. Blavatsky felt sex­magic to be immoral and perverse, so she subsequently employed the term \"LHP\" to characterize the magical systems she didn't like, and the term \"RHP\" to characterize the ones she did, i.e. Theosophy. Post-Blavatsky the terms have been expanded through popular usage to refer generally to what the Temple of Set defines as White Magic (RHP) and Black Magic (LHP). Most popular-occult organizations, to be sure, use the two terms simply to identify their moral biases. All they consider \"good \" is RHP, and what they consider \"evil\" is LHP. After Aleister Crowley left the Golden Dawn, he portrayed it as a \"Black Lodge\" and his own A. '.A. '. as the \"Great White Brotherhood\"; while on the other side of the fence W.B. Yeats and other G. '.D. '.leaders considered Crowley to be the Black Magician. To further complicate the matter, there have been some deliberately criminal \"Satanic\" organizations which have avowedly followed the LHP as defined by those who consider it synonymous with degenerate and destructive practices. Such episodes have of course served to reinforce the conventional religious image of Satanism and Black Magic as nef arious practices. So enduring was this stereotype that the Church of Satan found it very difficult to break free from it during the entire decade of its existence. All sorts of creeps, crackpots, criminals, and cranks 23"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"pounded on the door of the Church, assuming that it would excuse and encourage whatever social shortcomings they embraced. The Temple of Set has generally avoided this problem, mostly through careful admissions screening, but also because \"Satan\" is popularly associated with \"evil\" while \"Set\" is largely unknown outside of Egyptological circles.\" So as we can see the establishn1ent of the tem1 Left Hand Path very much mirrors the process that takes place when the gods of a conquered people become the demons of the conquerors. It was however with the advent of The Church of Satan and then later with the Temple of Set that the Left hand Path became a legitimately articulated way of approaching life, magic and personal initiation. Before Anton LaVey started using the term I can guarantee that virtually no sorcerer, witch or magician had ever heard of it before. Black magic was a fascinating suqject for the magically inclined love children of the 1960's primadly because it held yet another taboo that could be broken in the name of mind expansion, however black magic as a philosophically distinct practice did not solidify until Satanism became the world's first religion diametdcally opposed to the tenets of the dominate white light religions and mystical systems of attainment. Since the term Left Hand Path :in the modem black magical or satanic conte.A'i: seems to have developed within only the last forty years or so, we should examine that development and strive to isolate those features and qualities which have 24"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"led to our current understanding. For those of you who are rmfamiliar with the vast historical and philosophical differences between The Church of Satan and the Temple of Set, I advise making an in depth study of both, as without such knowledge one is simply lacking basic foundational information which can truly help piece together more advanced concepts. 'The uninformed reader might assume similarities between these organizations and they would be making a huge mistake. The Temple of Set manifested as a reaction against The Church of Satan in 1975 and established itself as a theistic philosophical school of black magic. The Church of Satan was never fueistic and maintains the core principles of Satanism as originally set forth by Anton LaVey in unchanged form to this very day. Of course there have been countless other splinter organizations that have come and gone over the decade.s, each with its own take on Satanism and the Left Hand Path and I'm quite stu·e that some of these orders, covens and temples may have achieved some degree of success in relation to fueir own goals, however The Church of Satan and the Temple of Set will be my only focus. It is also helpful that both organizations are still in existence and active to different degrees. It is also very apparent in Aquino's work that he purposely discredit's The Church of Satan in subtle and sometimes not so subtle ways. This must always be taken into consideration by fue discriminating student, keeping in mind the historical context of these references. 25"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In the late 1970's a new and highly vibrant form of and approach to sorcery made its appearance on the '\"occult &\".ene.\" Chaoo magic was introduced to the world primarily in the works of Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin who founded the llimninates of Thanateros (lOT), which became the primary organization dedicated to this new magical synthesis and the initiation system developed for chaos magic practitioners. I men­tion chaos magic here pti:marily due to it being a modem school of magic that emphasizes the use of sorcery for pragmatic ends and the intentional employtnent of belief systems as a means to an end, not an all encompassing end in themselves. Chaos magic is ultimately individualistic and encourages the sorcerer to ever seek out and create new magical methods in an effort to avoid falling into repetition and orthodoxy. Chaos magic regards the theistic approach as just one of many endless magical paradigms. It holds no thing or idea as sacred and instead encourage..;; the individual to attain Gnostic states of consciousness thereby becoming capable of non-ordinary perception and in tum acts of magic. For these reasons I will classify the chaos magic of Carroll and Sherwin as a Left Hand Path school of magic and its practitioners as Black Magicians. In chaos magic the self seems to be the ptimary focus of the sorcerer and this also mirrors directly the fundamental pltilosophical emphasis of the Left Hand Path in general. I must add here that I do not in any way expect lOT members or chaos magic practitioners to identify themselves as Black Magicians or 26"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"adherents of the Left Hand Path; I simply feel that there is more than ample logical justification for classifying this branch in this way. Again from Black Magic by Michael Aquino, we have the definition of the Left Hand Path (LHP) as understood by the Temple of Set; \"The Temple of Set's LHP orientation is, as noted above, a function of its definition of Black Magic. No moral or ethical stances are implied by the terms LHP and IlliP per se, since they refer to techniques and systems rather than to the ends to which they are applied. As defined within the Temple of Set: The Left-Hand Path (Ll�P) involves the conscious attempt to preserve and strengthen one's isolate, psychecentric existence against the OU while creating, apprehending, comprehending, and influenc­ing a varying number of SUs. The Right-Hand Path (RHP) involves the intentional effort to dissolve or merge the self into the au. To the Setian the LHP is neither \"good\" nor \"evil\"; it is merely an avenue towards knowledge and power. While he may consider the RHP fruitless and/ or deceptive, he likewise forbears to pronounce moral judgments concerning it. Indeed, some of the Temple's most valuable information comes from individuals and institu tions who are/were thoroughly convinced that they are/were treading the RHP. Followers of the RHP are those whose 27"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"stated goal is egocentric absorption into the OU [which they confuse with the Universe as a whole]. They wish to harmonize their actions with it, attune their intellects and emotions to what they consider the God of Universal Consciousness, and thus partake of the immortality and divinity presumably characterizing that consciousness. This is the theoretical nirvana of the Buddhist, the Jainist, and the Hindu; the \"salvation\" of the Christian. \" Here the OU stands for objective universe and pertains to what Setians consider the outside world of the perceiver. I am unaware of any tJ:aditionally \"satanic\" definition of the Left Hand Path other than the general ideas one would naturally associate with it, so I believe that using the \"Setian\" construct and building on that is a reasonable place to start. While I personally find Aquino's definition to be sound I also feel that his explanation entails the use of words which are presented as the elements behind sonnd conceptual constructs, but which however are somewhat vague. \\Vhat is one's \"isolate, Psychecentric existence?\" Well, being a refined black magician who deals in abstracts I can intuit very easily what is meant here. 'Vhat Aquino means is that the pursuit of the Left Hand Path is the sum efforts the Black JVIagician takes in order to strengthen their entire being and actively separate it from the debilitating influence of ordinary existence in the mundane world (OU). 28"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"This can entail developing physical, mental, emotional or artistic capabilities far beyond what would normally be considered their nahual limitations in the ordinary world. In essence, these e.A\"'ira-ordinru-y pursuits lead the sorcerer into a state of existence where non -ordinary pe1·ception and activity begin to dominate their activity within tlte objective universe (OU) and force them to eventually e.\"\"Cperience a merging of ilieir own su�jective state with tlmt outside of themselves. This is the mark of ilie Black Adept and signifies one who had succeeded in comprehending the Left Hand Path and following it absolutely. The conscious attempt to preserve and strengthen one's individual existence while \"creating, apprehending, comprehending and influencing\" a multitude of \"'subjective Universes\" suggests that ilie sorcerer is engaged in handling reality as if it were a multifaceted prism where iliey seek to dominate and fully discover each facet as boili creator and explorer. TI1is conceptual assertion led to the point where I first be.came inclined to link the dark sorcery of ilie ancient Toltec shamans and the idea of the \"assemblage point\" wiili the essential philosophy and ainls of the Left Hand Path. I have however gone into great detail concerning this relationship in my other works and will not do so here. My present concem is to primruily define the Left Hand Path in ilie most pragmatic tenns possible in order to give the initiate concrete guidance and workable concepts tltat easily apply to their eve1-y day activity.

So now that we have formulated a sound and complete definition of the Left Hand Path taking into consideration it's development and history we can move on to what I consider to be far more important than definitions and ideas; what do we do as the practitioners of Black l\\-1agie and Adepts of the Left Hand Path that sets us apart from all else? For the Black Adept of the Left Hand Path, stagnation and stasis are manifestations of ordinary organic life and consciousness which are to be avoided at all costs. Just as the white magician seeks \"unity\" of consciousness with a \"higher\" godhead, the Black Magician purposely becomes self-absorbed in the most calculated of ways in order to set themselves apart from what we view as the entropy of the self. On an every day, practical level this entails a continual and rigorous self-examination and purposeful efforts at self mastery that transcend normal human behavior. This begins pdmadly with the eradica­tion of unnecessary and detrimental habits of behavior and thoughts which drain us of the vital life force we need. The Left Hand Path initiate begins on the path of knowledge out of a simple rejection of the herd conformity of the human 30"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"masses, but one cannot attain power by simply rejecting the world of ordinary human affairs while still immersed in the modern comforts and social arena that they are supposedly against to begin with. Action is necessary at this point, and the sorcerer knows that the greatest potency is to be achieved through starting with the smallest of sustained and willful acts of change within one's own psyche. At first these will ed changes should have the sole purpose of disrupting the ingrained neurological/ energy pattems within the mind and self, extending outward into one's behavior and eventually to acts of calculated self domin­ion. Begin listing those thoughts within which set one apart from others. The beginning of Left Hand Path consciousness begins with the denial of human dependence on an etemal, unchanging and omnipotent deity or greater stabilizing force in the universe, in favor of a view that embraces the isolation and perfecting of the sorcerer's consciousness through increasing levels of mastery. Begin living these beliefs.

Did the practice of magic arise out of a deep psychological need for early man and woman to feel that they did in fact have. some degree of control over the conditions of their world, or was there always more to it than this? As I have stated and will state repeatedly, in the cmuse of evolution, organic beings do not long employ practices or behaviors that do not in some way aid them in their ultimate survival and continued reproduction. With this in mind we can look at the development of the practice of magic from more than a psychological perspective and better see where its existence fits into the whole of human history. There is no doubt that magic provides a profound psychological advantage to the practitioner in that it can cultivate a sense of control and stability in overwhelming situations where tl1e individual desperately needs to maintain their soundness of mind. The evolutionary advantage is clear here, as the witch and sorcerer can proceed in the course of their lives knowing that the magic that they have worked will relieve them of the burden they are experiencing.

Therefore, we can bypass the psychological need theory of the development of magic and proceed directly to what we know about it as the abstract force certain types of individuals or groups interact with or employ in order to cause tangible change in the material world. This gives us a simple theoretical paradigm in which to further explore magic as a force without the need to delve too deeply into what motivates its use to begin with or the personal psychological attributes of the human beings found to be drawn to its employment, study and development. We will simply say that we proceed with the under­standing that whatever magic is, it works under certain conditions and for certain people or groups and that it has, throughout time been found to work and be advantageous to the users. There was, in another time, no distinction between different types of magic. All magic was then simply the utilization of a power beyond the normal range of human sensory experience to cause some form of change that would most benefit the individual or group.

Human actions are never so morally clear and I personally find it to be amusing that the white light magician actually believe that the sorcery they wield is, in its totality devoid of selfish purpose and altruistic in its very nature. This is nothing more than an illusion created by the ego which struggles against itself in a form of willf ul self-denial. The white magician of the right hand path seeks to unite all that they are and have become through the process of \"initiation\" with some vaguely defined \"cosmic consciousness,\" or Godhead. Precise definitions aside, I must ask these adherents what exactly it is they think they are doing when performing the magic that is supposed to lead them to this nebulous nirvana. The very desire to lose one's self in something greater is the absolute act of selfishness in the form of the denial of one's life and the refusal to assume personal responsibility for one's place in the cosmos. This entire \"great work\" is akin to a monumental metaphysical form of sloth derived from nothing more than a skewed view of humanity as inferior in the grand scale of things.

The white magical orientation states that acts of magic dedicated to self serving ends are in essence out of alignment with the greater pur­pose of the Supreme Being and his/her host of angels/ spirits and therefore is tainted with the corruption of the baser, animal energies of humankind. Of course we all know that when they see fit and can rationalize it within their own particular Aeonic formula, the white adept will most certainly engage their energies in baser sorceries dedicated to the accumulation of wealth or the affairs of the flesh. This is simply an extension of the original delusional hypocrisy of the \"White School\" and has been recognized by true sorcerers for centuries. Enough of the befuddled ones, who would simply be better off shaving their heads, disposing of their belongings and heading for the nearest monastery. We now turn to the crux of the matter. Those who are drawn to the power of magic seek one thing; power. Having an edge over the mandates of a hostile and predatory universe, no matter how insignificant is still better than nothing at all. When the ancient shaman sing their songs to aid in the creation of abundance and help with the basic survival of the individuals in their tribe, they are drawing 42"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"unto themselves power bom out of the basic selfish evolutionary command to survive and reproduce.

Magic does not work if the sorcerer doesn't really need it to work one way or the other, and that is why sorcery done for others must be motivated by some form of rational self interest for the Black Magician in order to succeed. We need not look to some divinity or holy book to guide us in our understanding of the world around us. Nature itself is the Black Magician's instructor because we approach our arts based on what we know, not on the inspired teachings and self induced visions of other people! We are natural predators in a predatory universe in which has arisen evolutionary rules dictating that those beings who have any type of survival advantage over other beings will most likely be around to leave ancestors and thus pass on through natural selection those traits that gave them this advantage in the first place.

If magick is the science ru1d art of causing chrutge to occur in conformity with one's will, then for certain black magic is the fundamental, inevitable evolution of sorcery as it pertains to the Black Magician as a predator.

This price is paid for with the energy one has to expend in their continual effort to stay the flow of human mediocrity as it ceaselessly pounds on the sorcerer's manse, ever trying to erode away one's will and resolve in the face of dissolution and the possibility of an unwanted 'oneness.' It was once thought that powerful sorcerers chose to reside in secluded, desolate places far away from the eyes of the profane and common. This mythological trait is closer to the truth than one would at first think. Even though in modem times it is much more difficult to find time, space, seclusion and total anonymity; we must realize that these are the ideal and desired living conditions for anyone practicing the sorcery of the Left Hand Path. While it may be almost impossible to construct the grand, yawning manses of the ancient Black Magicians, we are still very capable of adapting out talents to shaping those factors in our immediate control in order to change our situations in any way we deem fit for our work. Human beings first learned of the power of magic through the process of survival in a fierce and predatorial world. They innately felt the power of the cosmos within their own developing bodies and sensed the movement of the planets and the burning of the stars. As early humans struggled to adapt and survive, they leamed to employ any 46"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"slight advantage in their constant strife. This quality, to seek out that which will give one. an advantage in survival, is innate in all creatures. There is very little room for play in this process, as only those activities that aid survival while not detracting from an organism's overall vitality will prove to be worth engaging in. If an activity is unnecessarily draining, no matter how compel­ling, it will he eliminated through the process of natural selection and a new adaptive behavior will surface. This es.<;entially leads us to wonder why the practice of magic has survived from the earliest times when hwnankind drew crude pictures of their desired prey on cave walls with charcoal and dyes, and threw spears at these representations, knowing that this ritual expenditure of energy would increase their chances of success in the hunt the next day. This early sympathetic magic is viewed today as a primitive relic belonging to dark ages of superstition and primitive animal behavior, but what we must understand is that first, early humankind was more in tune with the world around them than we can even imagine, and secondly that non-adaptive behavior during these ages past simply did not survive. Early hwnans did not have the time or resources to engage in complex ritualistic behaviors without their being a guaranteed, predictable outcome that would sway the chances of their own survival in their immediate favor. Leisure time is a relatively new byproduct of industrialized society and early hwnans simply did not have it. 47"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The first sorcerers were nothing more or less than the most sensitive individuals in the prim.i­tive clan. They were in tune wiili the raw ene.r­getic configurations of nature and could predict events with uncanny accuracy. These early beings were looked to in times of peril, and it was most assuredly one of these shaman sorcerers who performed the first black curse against an enemy of the clan or tribe. Black magic arose from iliese early origins out of desperation and need. The first sorcerers collected together the necessary ingredients; ones that they could feel resonated with their purpose and would capture and hold their magical intent. They combined them together with forbidden words of power that resonated with the elements of the world around them. They stole into the night and built a fire in the most desolate of regions; homes of demons of the earili and air, and they held the effigy of their enemy aloft, weaving a powerful curse and finally throwing the charged representation into the bonfire, knowing the work was complete. The night would pass and the sorcerer would tltank and praise the powers that they knew were at their command. They could now return to fueir people to assure them that their enemies would not be coming to slay, rape and pillage. Word from scouts would finally reach our little tribe and the news would in fact confirm the work of the sorcerer.

Eventually, the principles of sorcery and black magic began to intertwine with those of the clan warrior. Sorcery was beginning to be viewed as more than just a door into the vastness of the unknown. It was seen as a potential edge in battle and the warrior sorcerer or warlock came into being. The Ancient Romans had their Auspices and Oracles, and no Roman general would have ever thought of going into battle without the powers of sorcery and the Gods being firmly on their side. Oracles were consulted and blood sacrifices were always made in abundance and those who were familiar with the works of magic were continuously kept close at hand. This example is one of many that could be used, but the lesson is that magic was not simply a psychological attempt by primitive humans at controlling the uncontrollable. It was an art developed by certain individuals who identified discrete, intangible abstract forces that could give them and their people a concrete, practical advantage in the struggle of survival. If this behavior, with all the energy and time that went into it was not advantageous, it would have been eliminated in favor of other, more immediately rewarding ones.

This quality is more common with people in childhood, but through the often bitter process of social assimilation we leam to repress this talent and our original sensitivity becomes viewed as oversensitivity in a world that values bmtishness and easily digestible information above all else. A Black Magician must also cultivate the virtues of patience, precision and neatness in all that they do. Patience is a required quality in that many of our more advanced works will demand much study, time and the gathering of rare, sometimes virtually unobtainable materials. Years may go by while we wait for the opportu­nity to collect a rare earth, plant or book. We may even have to find e:\\.\"i:ra income and save for a time in order to be capable of affording an exotic ingredient or excursion abroad.

This may do well and fme for the right hand pather, with their simple ceremonies, ingredients and goals, but those who wish to face the fact that all · true magic is black must of necessity be organized in mind and matter. Ignoring the virtue of simple organization will eventually lead to the clumsy crossing of energies; the mixing of contrary currents without the understanding and learning to undo a complex and unneeded mess. So, move slowly at first. Find the be.st oooks and wait until they can be purchased without issue. Grow, find and collect the finest ingredients and learn to properly powder or preserve. Be certain to pay attention to every act as each is its own magic that will inevitably strengthen what you are to become as a whole. · Black magic itself definitely originated out of the need to survive, which inevitably meant the need to protect one's self and one's interests. This very concept allows us to see the earliest origins of the Left Handed Path in that the energetic and philosophical basis of the black schools of magic is the fundamental exaltation of the self and the quest for some form of individual immortality. The preservation of the immortal ego and intellect of the sorcerer is one of the prime 51"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"differences between the adherents of the Left Hand way and those of the white light and right hand path. Being that these humble beginnings originated with the basic instinct to survive, the future developments logically stemmed from their origin and centered around not only protection and survival, but also the enhance­ment of these dark powers, the strengthening of the self and the emphasis of the sorcerer as a predator among men. Fear lead naturally to ferocity, and in tum to power and the ability to manipulate the life force for the purposes of the self. This is the way of the dark path; that the sorcerers of the Left Hand honestly acknowledge that their individual pursuits, physical well being and interests are simply more important than the lives and concems of others. As sorcerers becrune more and more adept at survival enhanced through magic in a brutal and tmcertain world, so their skills and areas of expertise became refined and expanded into what we now conunonly refer to as forbidden realms. The sorcery of poisoning is one of these specialized areas, and this specialized area branches out and is influenced by others areas of expertise. The history of offensive sorcery abotmds with tales of black magicians employing a wide variety of poisons to accomplish their nefarious goals. The dark sorcerer is seen as the formidable expert in the concocting and dispersal of magical poisons, as well as being completely knowledge­able in the fine art of identifying and collecting 52"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"the necessary materials for their dark deeds. Is it any wonder that those among the htunan masses who displayed extraordinary talent and power quickly developed the very real need to not only protect themselves from the herd, but also to efficiently and effectively lash out when situations and times called for the annihilation of their enemies? The curse and hex may use specialized material components other than the typical black candle and bottle fill ed with nails; however they may not necessarily need these things. An act of poisoning through sorcery will always require a physical base of some sort, even if it is very simple and being used to house a complex poisonous energetic configuration. A carrier may be anything that sends the poison to, and into its intended target. Sound, food, breath and bodily fluids are all examples of common carriers, and each one is employed in distinctly different ways. In these strange days of political correctness and the over-valuing of a kind of illusory equality between hrunan beings, the Black Magician; ever the champion of the strong and the etemal ideal individualist must keep their black magical arsenal fully stocked and their altematives broad and open in order to effectively work their will among the herds of men untouched and unburdened. Poisoning through sorcery is intimately related to the magic of cursing, hexing and most other forms of offensive sorcery, however it relies distinctly on the foundation of the use of poison­ous substances with either inherent deadly chemical properties, or material substances that, 53"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"when combined and infused with the poisoner's intent will act as the most deadly of substances on the level of the etheric. A complex series of poisons may be used; employing subtly toxic refined substances as well as expertly formulated poisons intended to deeply effect the chosen target first at the foundational level of their etheric substance and then moving on to corrupt the subject's actual vitality and physical base. The distinctions that naturally arise for those inclined to approaching the secretive and most taboo specialization that poison sorcery is are a natural consequence of first, the need to be extremely careful handling deadly materials, and second the level of perceptivity the Black Magician must have in order to intuit the exact effects of their endeavors. Every culture throughout the world that has a strong ancestral history entwined with the use of sorcery \"rill often have an accompanying left handed tradition that subsequently grew along side of their more benign magical pursuits. The Bokhor of the Haitian Voodoo traditions, the country witch of Westem, Northem and Eastem Europe, the Mankukulam of the Philippine jungles and the V ama Marg Tantrics of India who master the art of manipulating pranic energy in order to accomplish a spectrum of nefarious objectives. All these adherents of the I.eft Hand Path have their own specialties when it comes to the forms of black magic that they choose to master and practice and tl1ey all have their own distinctive methods and means for engaging in the sorcery of poisoning. 54"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The terrifying barang sorcery and Kulrun witch­craft of the Philippines employ all manner of poisons and often use a variety of insects as live carriers as well as for specialized ingredients. Just as in Haiti, Philippine black magicians and witches are often called on to provide the services of the poisoner, whereby individuals pay for their services with the knowledge that they will effectively be capable of committing murder through the sorcerer, and thus be free of culpability or spiritual responsibility. This suites the sorcerer fine since their dark obligations eventually require that they consume lives throughout the years with an increasing frequency. Animal components are essential in Kulrun and Barang, as well as in almost all other forms of black magic originating in tropical regions. They are often ritually gathered, treated and then processed to be used in conjunction with an enemy's personal items containing the essential energetic connection between the target enemy, the poison and the sorcerer. Often, an animal component will be powdered after having been ritually charged, and then mixed with other specifications and then slowly introduced into the food of the target, or sometimes simply placed in their vicinity to work its etheric toxicity. These methods will of course be elaborated on in depth in a forthcoming text with all necessary variations and applications.

Paleros who practice Mayombe or hrujeria almost always rely on the aid of the restless dead in their attacks, as do many African witches. I have found that the earthbound spirits of the dead are most often the first to respond to the sorcerer's calling, and that they almost always seem to execute any diabolical task with greater speed and exactness than do demon or elemental helpers. Of course, I simply attribute tltis to the earthbound spirit's already formed cognitive familiarity \"\\\\rith the human realm; its emotions and desires as well as the complexities of human life. This makes perfect sense if you consider the obvious fact that a demonic entity has never experienced an incantation as a human life and will not have an affinity for human concems; preferring to simply get paid for its efforts and return to its own demonic pursuits. The same things holds true. for working \"\\\\rith elemental agencies. While not as unruly as demon helpers, elementals have a mind that is closer to the human realm, yet still alien enough to lack a genuine concem for human triumphs and tribulations. The elemental realm of Faerie is a separate world from the human, divided by energy that moves at an almost alien vibration and speed. The beings of this realm may have a particular affinity or liking for 56"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"individual sorcerers, but this is generally as they are intimately tied to the emotional, elemental sphere while human concems are rooted in the Realm of the mind. Lucky indeed is the Black Magician who has the devoted aid of the elemental kingdoms at their side, but this is unfortunately not the case for most and other options are usually better. The poisoner uses spirit allies in order to charge and imbue their concoctions with the essence of the intent they wish to utilize. They are employed to carry the poison through the etheric realms and administer it physically and often in the dream state of the chosen victim. Only after completing the act of poisoning will the entity in question be paid for its efforts. Most reputable sorcerers will never accept payment for this kind of work until after the attack has been success­ful, and this is often how one can tell whether they are dealing with a genuine sorcerer or sim­ply a dabbler in the arts. The exception to this is when the Black Magician needs some funding up front in order to buy any necessary items or to \"feed\" their spirit familiar in order to vivify and strengthen them for the task at hand. This will almost always be the case when the sorcerer uses the spirits of the earthbound dead in order to carry out a poisoning or other form of attack. This is because the earthbound entity relies on the thoughts, energy and material offerings of living human beings in order to energize its spectral corporeality. The dead exists perpetually in a dream like state, only gaining 57"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"lucidity, foc'll.s and volition when they feed off of the energy given to fuem by fue Black Magician. Food offerings are very typical and fresh blood is almost always used in Mrlcan based magical practices involving the earthbound dead.

Energy is, at its root, unifom1 and undifferentiated how­ever, this is only at the very fundamental states and energy tends to move in relation to the characteristics of the essence that is surrounding and containing it. Not all methods of offensive poisoning sorcery will need the influence of a spirit as an intermediary, but will simply rely on the agent of the poison itself, the carrier element and the intent of the Black Magician in projecting it at the target of attack. I often use the word attack to conveniently describe the act of poisoning, but this is out of convenience only as each poisoning truly will have its own unique qualities much like a theatrical performance held over the com-se of a week will vary each time it is executed as a unique event unto itself. Each act of sorcery through poisoning will be different and mostly be determined by the intended effect. Some poison­ings will be long and drawn out to increase suffering or add time to an operation, while some will resemble the flash of a black lightning bolt rendering the target paralyzed from the very core of their being. 58"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"I have addressed black magic as an offensive power and the evolutionary prerogative of the sorcerer and in truth most people, even those knowledgeable concerning magic and the occult regard this as the overarching feature of black magic itself, however we who tread the Left Hand Path know differently.

Greater magic generally takes place in a consecrated space, most often a ritual chamber of some type and typically involves the individual sorcerer or a group of practitioners ceremonially performing a scripted rite· of magic directe.d at achieving concrete results in the outside, objective and material world. I will not insult my chosen readers here as I am quite sure that every one of you are more than well versed in the basics of ceremonial magic, satanic or otherwise, and if you are unfamiliar with tl1is topic I strongly refer you to Anton LaVey's The Satanic Rituals. This companion text to 'The Satanic Bible is what I consider required reading for any aspirant. I do realize that as the tides of thne wash over this world, new generations of power seekers will start out on the dark path as hungry for knowledge as I once did and it is for these few that I make what are very basic references herein. Although it would do for many of us seasoned witches and warlocks to make a habit of re-reading many of those earliest tombs of in­spiration and in this way shed more experienced black light on old concepts while simultaneously rekindling the energy and passion of our past.

Greater Black Magic is the act of profonndly altering one's subjective perceptions in an effort to change the conditions of their objective reality and as energy generating, creative beings, we above all other creatures can do that. It is what makes us human and this is the \"secret\" to the \"silence\" of the Hermit. For the modem Black Adept I recommend the fabrication of a multi-use ritual chamber for the purposes of Greater Black Magic. Refer to Nox Infemus: the Book of Black Amber for elaboration on the creation and purpose of the sleep chamber. One should construct the space with visual and emotive cues generated directly out of one's dreams. Each of us knows that strange unique feeling we get when we genuinely connect with the abstract; the energy of the Land of Nod. No two sorcerer's share identical impressions of the nnknown and the energy of magic itself, and this is why symbols are used in group workings as they align and direct the attention of multiple participants, acting as visual magnifying glasses for the power of the dark light. One knows whether they have succeeded in developing an effective black magical ritual space by the overall feeling they and others get from the area as well as the behavior of ordinary human beings in the proximity of the space.

Lesser Black Magic is identical to Castaneda's concept of \"stalking,\" as \"dreaming\" finds its parallel in the ritual chamber of Greater Black Magic. Dressing, talking and generally presenting one's self in a particular way in order to influence a target audience for a specific end is to use the endless teclmiques of Lesser Black Magic. We use this power to gain something for ourselves and we cater its application to that which we seek. Politicians and social climbers are master Lesser Black Magicians in that they gauge everything about how they appear and how they act in order to elicit a favorable response from others. Politicians are looking for votes and social climbers are looking for power and acceptance. The sorcerer is usually looking for neither of these things unless they have naturally become critical features of their greater quest. For some this may be so. I have so far pursued several different vocations in my life and within each one of these I needed to learn the particular vocabulary of that area of endeavor as well as its rules for achieving success within it. In so doing this I had to learn which manipulative teclmiques worked best for each unique situation. The Adept of the Left Hand Path should embody the idea that there is no point in doing a thing unless one intends on doing it well. Black l\\'Iagicians are not mediocre beings and do not expend their valuable time and energy involved in thoughts and activities that bear tasteless fruit. Lesser Black l\\'Iagic is a mansion filled with powerful tools a disceming sorcerer may draw from to serve them as they will to whatever ends they pursue. 62"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"For a further magnification and study of Lesser Black Magic and its techniques and applications I recommend The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene and Joost Ellfers as well as the entire Temple of Set reading list from The Crystal Tablet of Set. Ultimately, how one chooses to apply Lesser Black Magic will change according to want, need and the actual objective limitations of one's self and any given scenario. This is where one of the most important black magical max:inls necessarily applies. \"Know thyself.\" Medial Black Magic is a topic and discipline that is rarely if ever explored as a distinct art of its own. Most will touch and toy with its energies and potentials without knowing what it really is, but very few will grasp its true power and their own ability to wield it as part of their sorcery arsenal. Medial Black Magic is the spontaneous projecting of one's will and intent in conjunction with some form of physical action that is often spontaneous as well. It is of the highest forms of true Witchcraft and its methods and intricacies are always extremely personal. The sorcerer who suddenly utters the inspired words of an incanta­tion into a passing wind to be taken away and made manifest or the witch who gazes into the flame of a single candle and perfectly projects their will into the rising flame; these are examples of Medial Black Magic in motion. The use of this particular form of sorcery can be found more often among those who we would consider \"natural hom\" wielders of power. While it is true that all human beings do have the capacity for magical achievement, it is equally 63"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ttue that certain individuals are hom with and quickly develop a stxonger affinity with it. Those who are birthed into this world with an inbom connection with the power of intent often know that they are vastly different from the other human beings around them, and if they reach adulthood successfully they will eventually thrive within their craft. An act of Medial Black Magic requires only the will of the sorcerer and some means of projecting that will forth. Props are not always necessary; however personal symbols that resonate deeply with the practitioner will act as a magnifier and condenser of power, making the transition from intent to will to fom1 much more direct and efficient. This excerpt from chapter six written by Michael A. Aquino within The Crystal Tablet of Set will further clarify this middle realm between Greater and Lesser Black Magic. \"Medial Black Magic involves the use of the Magi­cal Link in its simplest, most direct form in an op­erative context. Unlike Lesser Black Magic, in which the magician uses forces and features which are of the objective universe to accomplish his goals, Medial Black Magic has similar goals but uses metaphysical means-the Magical Link-to real­ize them. It is not as \"p ure\" as true Greater Black Magic (which has no purpose other than itself). The beauty of P.Iedial Blade Magic is its simplicity and directness. It requires only so much formality as you feel appropriate to what you wish to do. Gri­moires, spellbooks, even the fa mous curse/lust/ compassion rituals of The Satanic Bible are need-64"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"lessly overcomplicated and are just so much window-dressing for persons who need such \"training wheels\" to work up a proper mental/ magical state of concentration. \" \"However, and this is an important point, Medial Black Magic is not just \"making a wish\" or \"saying a prayer, \" because these things involve no will, or even sincerity. Medial Black Magic requires you will that the result you desire actually occurs. Unlike Lesser Black :Magic, there is no calculable cause­and-effect. If you are using proxemic magic (LBM), you can reliably count on keeping someone in a room, driving him out of it, altering his mood, etc. because of the physiological and psychological principles you are applying. As a stage magician (also LBM) you can trick or control people by things that may seem to be Medial Black Magic but aren't. When you resort to medial Black Magic, you enter that twilight zone between physics and metaphysics. The link may or may not work, or it may work in some uneApected way [not necessarily to your satisfaction]. You may try ll-Iedial Black Magic and get good, regular results. You may get nowhere and conclude that, for you anyway, it is a waste of time and an intellectual insult. Or you may find it a kind of mix of the two. \" 65"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"I personally enjoy a wide personal spectnun of black magical application with particular emphasis on Lesser and Medial Black Magic. While Greater Black Magic is truly the high art form of the very seasoned among us, it takes more preparation and in some cases much planning and forethought in order to accomplish effective and coherent workings. Not to say that this aspect should be less emphasized or ignored. Greater Black Magic should be studied in depth and the sorcerer should absolutely devote a good deal of their attention to it as this realm mirr ors the realm of dreams and once perfected can yield untold power. I personally liken Greater, Lesser and J\\fedial Black Magic to the Toltec Sorcery concepts of Dreaming, Stalking and the Mastery of Intent and I challenge my readers to pick up good old Castaneda's classics to find for themselves what I here only hint at. 66"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"67"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"T�Q }irsl-sorcQrQrs coUpc}Qd }o9Q}�Qr }�Q nllcllssarCJ in9Flldilll}}s: OI'JllS t�at }�ll� could flllll rQsortdl-Qd wit� }�llir purpos(l al)d would caphtrQ ill)d �old t�Qir ma9kal il}}Ql)}.

If we study every culture of the world throughout our relatively short history we would be hard pressed to find even one group, tribe or nation that did not have at least a fragmented or minimal set of cultural beliefs and references pertaining to some version of this invisible reahn and its inhabitants. Many ancient cultures had highly complex conceptions of their spirit worlds and intricate yet concrete ways of interacting with the spirits. I use the term spirit to refer to any non or semi -corporeal entity with individual consciousness and the ability to exist simultaneously in our ordinary material world and any number of other worlds. The pjinn, Fae, Y aksha, Loa, Orisha and all manner of God, Angel and Demon are just a very few of the names that have survived through oceans of time and that we still use for these beings. It simply strikes one as very strange that the powerful disembodied entity has been with our kind through the entire duration of our existence and that even in these modem times we can still find people and places that acknowledge their existence and even intimately interact with them as a matter of course. If there is one thing that I have noticed in my studies of human evolution and the development of our awareness it is that the human animal does not long embrace that which does not aid in its betterment and survival. 69"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The modem person looks at the religions of the past and thinks them simple folly, but when you consider the time, energy, devotion and material resources that have always been directed towards the fulfillment of ancient religious tenets we have to really question the basic survival value these activities had for the evolving human. What I am essentially getting at is that human endeavors that have not directly resulted in the survival/betterment of the human species would simply have not been \"selected\" by nature and would have quickly died out. As I said in previous chapters, there must have been real, concrete and pragmatic advantages which humans experienced through this constant and intimate interaction with the realm of the invisible. There are surprisingly consistent descriptions and themes pertaining to the spirits and their realm that have remained fairly unchanged throughout history. The modem human attributes these similarities to the human archetypes, yet as an initiated priest working within one of these still living traditions; I have the distinct advantage of being able to see the topic from a participant's view. Now, in order to become capable of good Left Hand Path critical thinking in this endeavor, we must also tmderstand the nature of how the perception of the participant is shaped by their immersion in a cognitive systetn that is of its very nature polarized against the normal cognitions of the modem daily world. I admit that the non­participant and the participant are going to view things differently, but I assert my understanding 70"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"that this is not simply based on the believer syndron1e where deep faith conditions the mind, but instead on a very real and identifiable perceptual advantage that the participant has over the non-participant. I will not yet again go into detail on how the cognitive schema of the sorcerer differs from that of the ordinary, but for the purpose of this work suffice it to say that the sorcery participant adopts a new and usually alien socio-cognitive schema which provides them with an overall widening of what can be perceived as opposed to the non-participant who has effectively, through habit and social pressure narrowed their perceptual options dowu to a very limited band within the total scope of what is perceivable. When the modem day sorcerer willingly steps into the broad confines of massively complex shamanic systems, they little by little become capable of interacting with the unkuowu as opposed to how the average ordinary individual shuts off this interaction through dismissal and au over emphasis on those features of their personal lives that magnifies their own importance in the universe. Sph\"its or non-corporeal entities are a natural feature of the natural multi-verse, but are part of the cognitive inventory of long gone ancient civilizations, sorcerers and other groups who participate in religious traditions that acknowl­edge, interact with and utilize these beings and their powers as a matter of course.

It has been my e-A--perience that the most unchanged of these have been derived from the religions and shamanistic practices originating in ancient Mrica. There was a time when the Gods of ancient Rome were consulted, worshipped and utilized on a daily basis by masses of human beings. l.bese ancient deities were not simply passive archetypical Jungian abstractions created by the Roman people as lofty representations of themselves. The rituals, observances and ceremonies of the ancient Romans were in every way as intricate and costly as those practiced by the true surviving Mro­shamanic traditions that still e xist. There were of course differences in method, cultural symbolism and such but these are to be expected. The real question that we have to look at with regard to pagan spirit religions that eventually died out was why the adherents of these mysteries abandoned those beings whom they had cared for and who had cared for them for hundreds or thousands of years. This is a seemingly difficult question and one that must be approached both in terms of history and in terms of the cognitive development of the ancient hwnan; their move away from the place of silent knowledge towards the place of reason. We do not have the room here to delve too deeply into the development and history of ancient pagan spirit religions in the depth that this area of 72"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"inquiry deserves, however I will touch upon some aspects of these practices and beliefs and simply recommend that the reader conduct a deep, thorough study of this topic as a most worthy supplemental pursuit. You will see far reaching themes expanding over astounding periods of time and will be better capable of tracing the influence of our shadowy cousins up to the present time. Hun1an kind's awareness was not always as it is now. Early human beings perceived the world around them more in terms of that which they could perceive, as opposed to that which they thought about and defined \"\\\\'i.th their minds (reason). Ancient humans were not simply more in touch with the earth around them, they were perceptually and energetically connected to it in a way that requires us to employ the terms of the abstract in order to help us comprehend. The cognitive schema and social inventory of ancient humans was directly shaped by nature, not by the constructs of an orderly and human made constmct of reason. Human beings, for most of their existence on this planet have defined their world and its constituent parts in terms of what they directly perceived and knew of the world armmd them. Indigenous societies which are still somewhat intact today can be studied in order to better understand how this almost alien way of relating to the world once worked for all people. For ancient woman and man, the wind was not the interplay between pocket.\"> of warm and cool air. The wind was a force and was often regarded 73"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"as having a will and consciousness of its own or of being composed of legions of invisible beings who inhabited the realm of air and could control it as a matter of dominion over that realm of nature. The seas and rivers were home to water deities and their minions as were all other places in nature that ancient humans came in contact with. For our ancestors, organic life as we define it today was not a prerequisite of awareness and intelligent consciousness. There was non-human inorganic life everywhere on the earth and the recognition of that played a significant role within the cognitive schema of ancient peoples. As humankind developed in mind and body and as our shift towards a technologically based manufacturing species evolved, so this cognitive make-up radically changed to keep up with and adapt to our growing capabilities. We began to lose our animal sensitivity and our intimate relationship with the earth shifted. Humans, more than ever before began to internalize a new kind of self -talk, or intemal dialogue which had more to do with the separation of the individual mind from the whole rather than the preservation of the clan. With this move towards the place of reason as the hub of all human endeavor and thought, we pushed the ethereal and unknown farther into a dimension separated and divided from us by an energetic barrier which we would eventually find immensely difficult to pass through again. The Gods would now no longer walk among us and could only manifest under special conditions 74"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"or in the realm of dreruns. As our own self reflection increased we lost our capability to reflect that which is without and relegated all non-organic forms of life and awareness to worlds of shadow and dru.-kness. One should wonder why tales of the unseen reahns have such distinct similarities across multiple cultures and times. Htmdreds of yeru.-s passed and with the spreading of Christianity throughout W esteni and Easten1 Europe, the pagan religions of old would slowly dwindle away. One of the main reasons the new religion of Christianity spread so effectively was because it had been semi-institutionalized in certain key locations towards the end of the Westeni Roman Empire, and when long standing Roman offices began to fail or be abandoned, the local Christian Bishops and clerics stepped up in order to fulfill the vacancies. This was the llllintentional beginnings of the Holy Roman Catholic Church which was to rapidly develop into a worldwide force that would become responsible for eliminating any trace of the old gods and their followers. As Anton LaVey explains in the Satanic Bible; \"Whenever a nation comes under a new form of goveniment, the heroes of the past become villains of the present. So it is with religion. The eru.-liest Christians believed that the Pagan deities were devils, and to employ them was to use \"black magic\". Miraculous heavenly events they termed \"white magic\"; this was the sole distinction between the two. The old gods did not die; they fell into Hell and became devils.\" 75"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Thus relegated to the shadows, the ancient deities took on the qualities of those hmnan projections which were reminiscent of all that is dark and forbidden. Goddesses of love became demons of lust, spirits of the forest became homed monsters and every aspect of hmnan­kind's camal nature became personified as evil entities, combining to form the legions of hell. And so the wit.ch hunts began with hundreds of years of suffering based on the total ignorance of nature and the hmnan mind. It should not be difficult for any intelligent hmnan with a sense of history to understand why the world's most dominant \"white light\" religions still have the influence that they do in our advanced age. This was the true fall and thus the Abyss manifested and grew in depth and dimension and Daath became the shadow of the sephiroth that it once was as it sank below that black expanse and out of the reach of mortals. 'The Black Magician, understanding these things has chosen to ally with the forces of darkness and embrace both their own camal nature and their shadow self, ultimately rooted in the darkness of the earth and the mysteries of time and space. This carefully nurtured resonance with the unseen realm and its inhabitants eventually leads the sorcerer into the most rewarding, emotionally satisfying, magically beneficial and abstract relationship with forms of consciousness that are both incomprehensively vast and yet capable of the most intimate personal relationship with the individual magi­cian. This relationship has always characterized 76"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"tl1e witch and sorcerer alike, who over cormtless ages has been viewed as tl1ose unusual individu­als who seem to have a special link or direct contact with non -corporeal beings displaying phenomenal powers and the most non-human of natures. Is it an inbom and natural quality of these human conduits which allows them the sensitivity to be competent representatives of the nether regions, or can this rmusual relationship be developed and strengthened in even the most rmperceptive and insensitive of us? The answer to fuis is a many faceted and obscure one which can only be found in the half remembered dream experiences of fue sorcerer, witch and devotee. The basic question that each practitioner finds fuemselves asking is whether the spirits exist independently of human consciousness and interaction, or whether their natures are almost akin to byproducts of our awareness and would essentially be considered to have no independent volition of their own without human interaction. What we who practice the black arts do know is that when called these entities and forces do respond. This consistency of experience among sorcerers throughout time and all over the world lead me into my own inquiry conceming the conunonalitles and nature of what I will from here on out term inorganic beings. Unless we postulate that a given deity has, somewhere in the cosmos, an actual physical existence in some type of material world of their own, then \"\\Ve will regard the vmiously understood spirits, gods, demons and deities as beings possessing awareness but having no corporeal physicality, or 77"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"possibly having transcended or displaying the capability of transcending some form of physical existence at will. When we are children we are told that the Devil lives in Hell and Hell is under the ground. So, unless we deliberately choose to proceed with knowingly engaging in an erroneous world view, then we either have to acknowledge the existence of inorganic awareness or accept that these various entities do in fact have some type of real, yet incredibly subtle physical existence at a level normally not perceivable by ordinary means. The farther away human beings moved from the natural realm over the centuries, the more distracted we became and subsequently the less capable of intimate interaction with these intelligences. As I said and reiterate, dreams became our common ground and for the modem sorcerer it is in dreams that we can actively make contact with our inorganic cousins and re-establish the long forgotten relationship we once cherished. Our ancient deities did not die, and contrary to the opinion that they are dependent on human awareness for life, they continue to exist as vitally as they ever did. What did change was our own ability to detect their presence and interact with them. We lost this capability as a natural consequence of the advanced development of our ego and the selective perceptual alignment that goes hand in hand with an increasing emphasis on the individual self. 78"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"We are speaking here of losing the ability to form a two way connection with beings residing in the shadow realm of our earth; a world that is ever present and before us at all times but always separated by a barrier of varying energetic speeds. So, starting with this in mind we should then logically move on to consider from an abstract sorcery orientation what we would essentially need to do in order to re-open this portal and invigorate this ancient relationship. In the distant past human beings knew about and purposely developed strange relationships with these inorganic forms of life and the Toltec sorcerers of ancient Mexico were a group of experts that developed this knowledge to a peak of perfection. This arcana is now; for the most part dead knowledge and the remaining shamanic traditions which still contain a workable system of interaction with \"spirit\" awareness are of Mrican and South American Indian origin. This is not to discredit W estem based Goetic methods of spirit congress or more kabalistic rooted traditions, however I will say that approaching the realm of inorganic interaction from a strictly Western esoteric occult orientation will have naturally imposed limitations that I shall elaborate on later. There is a universe of difference between what are commonly referred to as \"egregore\" in the traditional Western approach and what shamanic sorcery participants understand as the gods, or spirits. I personally started on the path of initiation as a typical student of Crowley, Regardie, Fortune and a hand full of others and was introduced to the practice of Bhakti, or devotional yoga early on in my development. 79"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"I became fascinated with the strings of similarity n:mrring through the various methods of working with the deities in different cultural contexts. Lil{:e any good budding sorcerer, I took notes and began to isolate the most consistent similarities in an effort to discover those techniques which showed the greatest degree of potency and success throughout the ages. Most of the more modem developed Westem and Eastem traditional esoteric approaches seemed to have evolved a metaphysics which thought of gods, deities and spirits in terms of the self and as unexpressed aspects of the human psyche . This view gained enormous popularity as Carl Jung's conception of the archetype spread and became more sitnplified and readily digestible for the literate masses. Crowley easily integrated and aligned Westem Kaballah, Ceremonial magick and freemasonry with Eastem philosophy, esotericism and pr actices, and as a result of his teachings I believe most modem students of the occult have adopted an understanding of the concept of deity which is heavily associated with ,Tung's idea of the archetype. Many of Crowley's favorite \"God-forms\" and entities from his Liber Al vel Legis are presented, or present themselves as exalted, mercurial and highly abstract beings of a super-conscious nature. While the father of magick itt theory and practice did give us endless tombs of highly usable and important material as well as significant insight into the process of invocation, he was through no fault of his own, almost completely ignorant of genuine shamanically based spirit work.

Enter shamanic sorcerer and one time anthro­pologist, Carlos Castaneda. In 1968 University of California Press released Castaneda's master's degree thesis; The Teachings of Don Juan: a Yaqui Way of Knowledge. This work centered on Castaneda's sorcery apprenticeship with a Yaqui Indian shamanic sorcerer and introduced the magically and mystically inclined to a whole new world encompassing a non-ordinary cognitive schema utterly alien from the one we normally understand. Through the course of Castaneda's 12 major book publications he introduced his readers to a system of sorcery very different from those which most practitioners had been acquainted with up until that time. Unfortunately due to a heavy emphasis on his intake of natural hall ucinogenic substances in his first book, Castaneda was overly embraced by the hippy and hippyish subculture throughout the world during that heyday of overt compulsive indulgence and incredibly destructive drug use. This association continues to dissuade modem practitioners from exploring the energetic sorcery premise of the ancient Totlecs through the teachings of Castaneda's mentor and through his books. In the 1980's the massive \"new age\" movement readily incorporated Castaneda as a guru of natural magic and freer of minds. Toltec sorcery then became directly associated with holistic new agey self betterment and white light 81"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"doctrine much to the dismay of serious sorcery practitioners who understood the Toltec system for what it truly is. Here, I digress no further as my views conceming this sorcery tradition and its applicability as a Left Hand Path means of attainment have been thoroughly detailed in my other works, but once again I implore the seekers of shadow to do their own research and fonn their own opinions through personal experience as I have done. Simply let it be said that I have not taken well known Left Hand Path doctrine and overlaid in on top of an ancient shamanic sorcery tradition, but have instead identified and specifically isolated what exactly is Left Hand Path about this ancient system. This is a very important difference in approach, and one that more modem occult scholars and writers would do well to make. My own fotmdational education in Westem magic readily allowed me to incorporate shamanically based sorcery concepts in a unique way and when I began to experience and understand tlte existence of inorganic beings and their world from an outsider's perspective, I was immedi­ately overcome by the staggering realization that comes from a total shif t in one's perception and basic knowledge of the world. As I have said, the Westem approach to working with otherworldly entities is highly poetic and relies heavily on ritualized method and models of magical theory. The shamanic sorcery approach takes the factual, experiential existence of independently conscious, non -organic entities as a reality right from the outset. I now briefly tum to the writings 82"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"of Mr. Castaneda and his sorcery dialogues with Don Juan from The Fire From Within (1984) for some Toltec clarification. \"Organic living beings have a cocoon that encloses the emanations. But there are other creatures whose receptacles don 't look like a cocoon to a seer. Yet they have the emanations of awareness in them and characteristics of life other than reproduction and metabolism. \" \"Such as what, don Juan?\" \"Such as emotional dependency, sadness, joy, wrath, and so forth and so on. And I forgot the best yet, love; a kind of love man can't even conceive.\" \"Are you serious, don Juan?\" I asked in earnest. \"Inanimately serious, \" he answered with a deadpan expression and then broke into laughter. \"If we take as our clue what seers see, \" he continued, \"life is indeed extraordinary. \" \"If those beings are alive, why don't they make themselves known to man?\" I asked. \"They do, all the time. And not only to seers but also to the average man. The problem is that all the energy available is consumed by the first attention. Man 's inventory not only takes it all, but it also toughens the cocoon to the point of making it infiexible. Under those circumstances there is no possible interaction. \" The \"emanations\" that Don Juan speaks of here are the dynamic energy centers that make up the energetic foundation of the human being. Of course, the seven chakras are the most well known and popular conceptions of these swirling energy vortices. When re-defining life in terms of awareness we must approach the topic of 83"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"inorganic life from an entirely new perspective. In energetic terms, organic and inorganic beings are composed of these conglomerates of energy centers, bw1dled together and held in place by a kind of energetic receptacle or structure. The only way to prove this it for the sorcerer to \"see\" this receptacle themselves and this is only possible through an alteration in one's ordinary perception. 'Ve don't see in the infrared or at the microscopic levels, but such realms exist and are complete worlds nnto themselves. The sorcerer must think like a scientist but retain the. perceptual fluidity that is required of an artist, continually eA.'J)loring the oceans of infinity. \"Don Juan went on exp laining that the ancient Totlecs had divided their secret knowledge into five sets of two categories each: the earth and the dark regions, fire and water, the above and the below, the loud and the silent, the moving and the station­ary. He speculated that there must have been thou­sands of different techniques, which became more and more intricate as time passed. \"The secret knowledge of the earth, \" he went on, \"had to do with everything that stands on the ground. There were particular sets of movements, words, un­guents, potions that were applied to people, ani­mals, insects, trees, small plants, rocks, soil. \"These were techniques that made the old seers into horrid beings. And their secret knowledge of the earth was employed either to groom or to destroy anything that stands on the ground. \"The counterpart of the earth was what they knew as the dark regions. These practices were by far the most dangerouS. They dealt with entities without organic life. Living 84"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"creatures that are present on the earth and populate it together with all organic beings. \"Doubtlessly, one of the most worthwhile findings of the ancient seers, especially for them, was the discovery that organic life is not the only form of life present on this earth. \" I did not quite comprehend what he had said. I waited for him to clarify his statements. \"Organic beings are not the only creatures that have life, \" he said and paused again as if to allow me time to think his state­ments over. I countered with a long argument about the definition of life and being alive.

I do not want the reader here to throw away their previous learning in this area in favor of a relentless pursuit of ancient Toltec knowledge, however what I do implore you to do is to make a serious study of inorganic forms of life from this orientation and then, as you intemalize some of the more remarkable features within, use these new energetic sorcery abstraction to scrutinize and further expand your current understanding and practices. 85"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Titis is what I was forced to do when I was first introduced to and subsequently initiated into a living modem Mro-shamanic spirit religion. My relationship with the Orisha and Loa truly began in my very early years. The signs and beckoning from the spirits were always present and eventu­ally through my development as a sorcerer, I was able to take advantage of the opportunity to gain firsthand experience and knowledge in this tradition. While becoming ever more immersed in the intricacies of the various aspect.\"> and physical practices, I was able to utilize my train­ing in the disciplines of westem magic and Toltec sorcery to draw comparisons between the sorcerer's approach to the deities of Mrican otigin and the knowledge and understanding of spirits from my earlier studies. What I found and continue to find is that inorganic beings, regard­less of how they are expetienced through the filters of cultural background or influence, share certain distinct commonalities. These shared characteristics remain constant and can be counted on to provide any practitioner with reli­able and repeatable results in the realm of spirit work. Inorganic entities form a diverse population of energy based consciousness ·within the overarching, collective energetic atmosphere of the planet on which we live. They are part of several other \"bands\" of consciousness, separated by our every day, ordinary mode of perception by the natural consequence of having evolved their own type of awareness which is also limited by their essential structure.

We find common meeting ground only in the elements of nature and during very specific situations, intentionally designed and enacted to facilitate direct interaction. Of course, spontaneous forms of communication and engagement do occur on a regular basis, such as in dream states and in cases where an individual is forcibly thrown into unfamiliar cognitive states. Alien abduction experiences and angelic intervention in cases of the gravely m are two well known exrunples of this phenomenon. Altered states of consciousness are a preliminary requirement for this type of interaction simply because these vastly different cognitive arrangements require that we abandon our more rigid perceptual conventions, which evolved as a nece-.o;;sary and utterly dependent aspect of our htunan survival capabilities in a predatorily hostile world where instant discrimination and classification was essential. In dreams and during magical ritual and sorcery operations, our ordinary way of reasoning or \"assembling\" the world is temporarily suspended and the gods can thus intercede in the affairs of htunan kind. Put us back into the world of mundane htunan social affairs, and the impenetrable veil drops as our intemal, incessant chatter and petty concems re-shapes our reality. It is in this way that our shadowy friends are pushed into the tunbra of perception and become locked away in their various places of origin; the night, earth, wind, fire water, etc. 87"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"As masters of the non -ordinary, the Black Magician understands the application of these predetermined conditions during spirit interaction. When we stop the intemal voice and engage in non-ordinary activity (magical workings in general are non-ordinary) we then stand out to the denizens of the shadows' world. They are attracted to this sort of beacon of disruptive energy in the natural field of the earth and they are drawn to us by our unbending intent to establish connectivity. Once the right conditions have been achieved and our ra'\\' emotions have been heightened there is no better enticement fo r les invisibles. Anyone who has ever witnessed or experienced a genuine \"spirit possession\" will come to under­stand the mechanics of this entire process. We know that in many systems of Shamanic based sorcery, ritual drumming is used to entice, call, praise and focus the consciousness of inorganic entities so that they may enter into the physical bodies of their \"chilru·en\" in order to speak and walk as humans do. It is still astounding to me even after experiencing this countless times that this kind of sacred interaction is even possible, and what is almost as amazing is that so many cultures still in existence today see this staggeringly unusual activity as simply routine and quite normal.

In the Mrican proverbs of the Odu of Ifa there is a saying; he who knows does not die like he who does not know. This ancient wisdom encapsulates perfectly the process and experience of what Westemers have come to understand as \"initiation.\" Some have called it \"being bitten by the serpent,\" and others have referred to it as \"crossing over,\" but for our purposes we may more precisely refer to this initial stage in the sorcerer' development as an initial shift of the assemblage point and the realigrunent of one's basic energy shape as a result of this shift.

Shamanic earth based religions generally seek to establish a balance of energy between the spirits and the commmrlty in which the shaman lives. This is done through the development of a relationship with invisible entities which is marked by a varying degree of servitude and loyalty between both parties. Each practice has its own core beliefs, superstitions and dogma concerning how it must handle the spirits. The Infernal Path is the embodiment of a living opposition to how traditional approaches deal with the spiritual or unseen realm. The sorcerer who embraces the infernal approach views the non-corporeal entity in a way more akin to the sorcerers of ancient times and seeks to exploit their knowledge of the invisible realms in a way that is beneficial to all parties involved, but that ultimately emphasizes their own accumulation of power and self­deification. The traditional shaman/priest seeks union with the deity and the \"spiritual\" elevation of themselves and their people through a subservient relationship with the spirit realm.

If executed correctly, the Black Magician will in essence be founding an infemal, Left Hand Path shamanic sorcery lineage all their own. This is of course no easy task, and my simplified description of this process is not meant to diminish the extremely dark and potent raw energies one will inevitably experience as a result. In traditional Mrican religions and shamanic practices, the individual initiate is seen to exist within a cosmology consisting of a typical cosmic hierarchy. In the practice of Santeria, or more properly La Regla Ocha (the rule of the Orisha), this spiritual chain of command is exquisitely defined, so I shall draw most of my examples from this and other living Mrican traditions, however it matters not what system we are dealing with as long as it can be approached from this Left Hand Path perspective. It will be necessary for the Black Magician to become as inrmersed in the chosen system as possible if they are to reap the dark rewards characteristic of the infernal approach. If one chooses the Mrican based traditions it will be necessary to first become involved with these paths and then to proceed through their hierarchy of initiations. 96"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"This should be a living challenge for you, but are we truly Black ·Magicians if we are not living these challenges? The Lucwni and Palo religions are founded on the central belief in one supreme higher divinity that was re.-;ponsible for the creation of the world, but has since become far removed from the affairs of humankind. In Lucumi, this supreme god is call ed Olodumare and in Palo it is called Nzambi. The Orisha of the Lucwni religion, the Nkisi of Palo and the Loa of Vodou are considered as powerful spirit entities, lower on the hierarchical rung than the creator, but far above human beings. These gods are thought of and referred to in many variations depending upon who you are talking to, but they still share some basic attributions. In tnany modern practicing connnunities these spirits are referred to as \"angels\" and there are even some who regard them as demons due to the fact that they are thought of as high spirits who reside within and around the earthly realm. The premise of embracing the Infemal Path as a method for Left Hand Path attainment is based on the core conceptions of the original witches' Sabbath, or black mass. These are almost archetypical in their essential qualities as many hmnan beings over countless centuries seem to hold primal ideas deep within them­selves concerning the diabolical nature of these dark gatherings. The black mass is, strictly speaking the Catholic mass inverted to honor the Devil rather than the god of the Jews and 97"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Christians. In this ceremonial setting, base animalistic tendencies in humans are exalted and anything considered \"pure\" or \"holy\" is appropriately blasphemed during the course of ritual. Examples of the traditional black mass can be fotmd in many sources, most notably The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish, 11Ie Satanic 1\\-fass, by H.T.F. Rhodes or the many references to the black masses allegedly performed from the 16th to 19th century by such notables as Catherine de' Medici, Madame de Montespan and the Marquis de Sade. The black mass was a complex psycho-energetic ritual device employed by cultures deeply immersed in Christianity to provide a kind of much needed liberation from the anti-human, stifling control that this religion exerted on people at these times. In order to fully appreciate the true purpose of the classic black mass, one should immerse themselves in a thorough study of the history of the Catholic Church and its social and political domination over human beings during the height of its power and even its diffused influence to this day on the human psyche. The term Satanist originated in a strictly Catholic environment and it referred to a person who worshipped the devil as god and had actively renounced the Catholic faith and its church. The concept of the Satanist remained fairly unchanged throughout the centuries, occasionally attracting some of the characteristics reminiscent of each specific period in history. This is of com·se until Anton Szandor LaVey codified Satanism in 1966 as an actual religion with a 98"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"distinct philosophy and set principles. The Satan­ist of old was thought to be the rogue Catholic priest, nun or wealthy aristocrat who had made a pact with Satan for worldly wealth and power. The typical black mass would, as an inversion of the Catholic mass involve nudity, sex, the reading of scripture backwards, the use of bodily fluids as sacred substances and the general profaning of all Catholic symbolism. This would most likely mean the employment of a large upside down cross somewhere in the unholy sanctum. Black was always the preferred color, but other traditional colors would have been reds and purples to symbolize the carnal realm and the royal status of the demonic within the confines of the rite. I'm quite certain that if the traditional classic black mass were performed today it would be regarded as a fairly ineffective and weak ritual working by most contemporary Black Magicians. However, if you were to involve highly religious Catholics as participants, the element of blasphemy could in all likelihood be harnessed to provide an abundance of energy. The point here is this; the Infemal Path demands that your chosen inversion must be done within a system that you have been fully immersed in as a participant in a traditional manner. If you grew up as a Catholic, as I did, then the black mass could be a liberating and fulfilling ritual working, providing you with the raw, dark energy required for continued abstract black magical endeavors.

For many, the term Left Hand Path sim.ply means the outward and philosophical rejection of ordinary accepted standards in realms of the occult mainstreant. This often extends to a fnndamental rejection of the ordinary world of htunan social afiairs and a general contempt for what is viewed as mnndane by t.hose of a Left Hand Path inclination. There is essentially nothing wrong with this interpretation as a true turning inward and a denunciation of the herd mentality is most typical of the initial stirring of a future Black Adept, however to remain comfortably at this level of development invites nothing more than perceptual and energetic stagnation no different from that of the complete acceptance of the tenets of the Right Hand Path. 100"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"More often than not, the Sorcerer of the Left Hand Path goes through two predictable stages in their growth and this can be seen to mirror the maturation of modem Left Hand Path schools of thought over time. The first stage is that of rebellion. This is the point when the magician has become aware of the inherent limitations of the Right Hand Path and begins to question and systematically reject those teachings and practices that they once embraced. The embodiment of this stage can be best illustrated by the Catholic priest secretly holding the Black Mass in an underground chamber as they swear allegiance to the Devil, their new unholy master. The reading of sacred texts in reverse, the burning of black candles instead of white and the encouragement of orgiastic rites of perversion all arose as manifestations of the rejection of the \"sacred.\" These acts of blasphemy are identical to the breaking of sacred taboos in many other esoteric traditions and they serve to liberate stagnated energy within the individual sorcerer. This stage should not be underestimated as it is of vital importance to the embodiment of the Infemal Path and can often be referred back to when developing more elaborate forms of stalking and behavioral modification in the pursuit of non-ordinary awareness. The second stage of development is characterized by a new found intellectual advancement within the psyche of the initiate. Here, they have realized that their rebellion against the herd mentality must achieve a higher purpose. Change must take place within and now the Left Hand 101"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Path Adept begins to embrace the concept of self­actualization as an essential component of their developing philosophy. Simply remaining at the level of rejection will lead to a basic calcification of being and ultimate uncreative stagnation. This second phase is where the dabbler truly realizes that by their own hands they can become their own God and subsequently that they need to DO something to achieve this goal. All that is really asked of the Sorcerer at this stage is that they refuse to stagnate and continue working with and developing those practices that they find challenging and force them to grow. For a proper black mass you will require the use of an actual Catholic church. This is essential because in Roman Catholicism all religious and spiritual activity centers on the physical structure of the church or cathedral. This place of worship has been conse<...-rated as \"holy ground\" by the living representatives of god on earth, the lord Jesus Christ and his apostles. Ideally, you should use a church, chapel or cathedral that is still in regular use as the stain of your black magic shall linger on to influence. clergy and congregants in untold ways. Perhaps your work there will magnify their weaknesses and lusts leading to even more hidden dishonesty, debauchery and denial than is currently manifest. Either way, conducting a black mass within the confines of an active, living breathing church will have its major advantages. Of course, I implore you here not to break any laws and to secure the cooperation of a confidant in this matter, be they priest, nun, grounds keeper, deacon, altar boy (of legal age) or 102"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"church administrator. Ideally you should seek to perfonn the ceremony at night, preferably between midnight and 3:00 AM, as this is traditionally the hours belonging to the wicked. Now, if you are limited to using a holy place that has been shut down or abandoned that is perfectly acceptable as such a locale has been literally saturated with the emotional energies of its congregants and inhabitants for many, many years, thus creating what are often self­sustaining pattems of energetic flow structured around the force of the intent of those people. Overall, the best scenario will be one where you can perfonn your black mass in a space which most resembles the church, chapel or cathedrals of your childhood and young adulthood; where your religio-sexual Erotic Crystallization Inertia developed and became fixed. Erotic (or emotional) Crystallization Inertia <ECD is a concept introduced by Anton LaVey which signifies the period of time in an individual's life when their sexual or emotional fetishes are fixed within their psyche and personality. I know that if I were to perfonn the ideal black mass it would be in t11e church where, as a child and young adult I experienced years of Catholic masses, all of the sacraments up to confirmation and the psycho-sexual frustrations that can often accompany such experiences as one goes through the fires of puberty.

It can really be done with any religious background at first and then the sorcerer can move onto more advanced practices where they, as an adult willingly immerse themselves in a new and totally foreign magical system to eventually invert it as I have alluded to. Another critical factor here is the composition of your chosen congregants. I do not really recommend planning and executing a full blown black mass as a solitary practitioner because other people simply play a role in our lives and ECI development. Yes, solitary black magical workings are a critical part of our magical repertoire, but for a working of such a deep and potentially change producing nature, I highly recommend finding others of like mind for its planning and perfonnance. If this proves very diffic'Ult you may always hire play actors for a low wage to play certain parts in the proceedings. Perhaps one could even pay vagrants to act as an unholy congregation, or a buxom prostitute to pose as your satanic alter.

The structure of the ceremony itself can, and should be tailored to aid in creating the magical environment that you want. The ultimate objective of a black mass is to liberate calcified and stagnate energies within the participants and to redirect these energies in new, fulfilling and creative ways. You may simply be performing the mass for the purpose of blaspheming those anti carnal Catholic ideals which were instilled in you from a very early age, or you may simply be acknowledging and honoring the powers of darkness on the earth. Either way, a successful black mass will most certainly empower the participants by energetically setting them apart from the mass of humanity. Black magic, performed with enough regularity and power will eventually change you at the molecular level. It will give birth to new and abominable energies that will reinvigorate and expand your own personal power. The mass should be modeled around the average Catholic mass itself and preformed inverted in a traditionally satanic mann er.

A traditional, fully inverted Latin mass would only be applicable or effective for those who heard the mass spoken in Latin as they grew up. Personally, I would not benefit from a black mass spoken in Latin; however I can see the advantage of keeping some spoken Latin sections as this was the language of the Catholic Church for hundreds of years, right up till modem times. This would naturally create a type of energetic resonation with the past and add to the overall effect of the ritual. Having some parts spoken in the traditional Latin could also provide the added benefit of helping to create a bridge between the conscious, modem mind of those involved and the mass collective unconsciousness that had been saturated with the traditional Latin Catholic mass throughout the centuries. In e..\">sence, what you would be doing is not only blaspheming the mass as it manifests upon the earth in the present day, but also projecting that diabolic intent into the past. \"\\\\lhatever one does decide on in the way of ritual structure, the culmination of the mass should always involve the glorification of the animal nature over that of the \"spiritual.\" Needless to say, the consumption of food could play a part as could any kind of debauchery or sexual 106"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"indulgence. The Witch's Sabbath of old was thought to climax in a other worldly orgiastic frenzy, and as long as the liberated energy is properly directed by the officiating sorcerer I see no reason why this could not be done (see For­mula 89).

Many will say that they have \"been there and done that\" in reference to Satanic Rituals, but I am quite skeptical when I hear other Black Magicians vocalize these kind of claims and I maintain that not enough has yet been written concerning this topic, certainly not enough has been truly practiced. Now, when considering the advanced applications of inversion one must first decide upon a religio� magical system within which one may inunerse themselves and eventually take measures to invert the chosen paradigm in order to manifest it as the infemal image of its prior distinction. As I have explained, the African based religions that exist fairly intact today are ideal for this as they are total belief systems unto themselves with an overarching cosmology and a working and applicable mythology that allows the Black 1.\\'Iagician to function as a believer and practitioner within it.

Kitnbanda is primarily the veneration of Exu and his female compatriot Pomba Gira. I say compatriot, because in practice and origin, Exu has no female aspect as many would be inclined to believe. This tidbit of rnisinfonnation is a perfect example of how many of these African traditional religions can degrade over time.

The idea here is that the process of re-configuring the initiate's consciousness in terms of non-ordinary learning required a dramatic break from the world they had formerly known. Even individuals in an indigenous society where magic and sorcery is an accepted element of reality would still have been indoctrinated to understand that although sorcery took place within the every day world, tile realm of power which that magic originated witilin was hidden by very real energetic boundaries.

In the conceptual framework of these systems it is literally impossible for a person to achieve true self understanding or ever discover the reality of what the self really is. Until we fully know the nature of hwnan consciousness, we will be subject to using models that best represent our current understanding of the self. For now, let us all ow the quantum physicists, biologists and many others devoted to this immense quest present what they have found in a scientific manner and allow us to add and modify our paradigms accordingly. The ultimate objective for the Black Magician is to use the best tools available, or to make the next best decisions that accord with their own \"rational self interest,\" and proceed with a working concept of the ego which will enrich and empower them on every level. I here present such a model developed from a synthesis of what I regard as the most important Left Hand Path philosophies to have developed thus far. My conception presented here is derived both from the realizations one gains through study and the applications of these insights to the mundane realm of material affairs.

These four components are known as the Khat (the body), the Ren (the mune), the Iiliabit (the shadow) and the ib (the heart). He also goes on to elaborate on the four subjective parts of the soul body complex; the Ba, Ka, Akh and Sekhem and I will. touch on these as well. The Ka is the actual physical body and for our purposes I will simply say that the physical body has its own special importance as it relates to the other parts of the ego. This being the case I will handle the concepts which are tied to this part of the ego complex as tl1ey come up within my U\\\\-\"'Il conception of the Black Magical ego. \"THE NMffi (Ren): The name has the power to feed energy into the soul-body complex. If it is spoken of well, ren carries the good intentions to the ka. It can be used to summon or compel a being; it likewise causes self-judgment in the Tuat. Beings with names die; certain beings may have their true names hidden by Amon, and therefore not be subject to death from the natural order. New names are given or claimed at turning points in the life of the mighty.\" \"THE SHADOW (Khabit): 1ne shadow is seen as being of e::!!..'i.reme importance. It is the source of one's power of mobility, and one's reproductive power. The shadow may be stolen while someone sleeps, cansing the object of the theft to die. Certain powerful sorcerers can detach their 117"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"shadows and send them on missions of hann or espionage. The shadow follows the dead into the Tuat, thus assuring his or her mobility there. The shadow held the sexuality of the being, and to the extent one's sexuality survived death it was through the shadow. The ba, ka etc. did not have sexuality as a constituent.\" \"THE HEART (Ib/ Ab): This is the seat of the intellect, passion, memory, and imagination. It is where thoughts are produced. A person and his or her thoughts are very different. The thoughts are the \"mother and father\" of the being-he or she may choose to act on them or not. In the Hall of the Examiners the examination comes clown to: \"Did you act on your good thoughts? Did you act on your bad thoughts?\" The action of the ib produces magic, which drips clown to the stomach where it is stored.\" I present these concepts and terms from the Crystal Tablet of Set simply to supplement the model that follows. I have found it practical and very helpful to consolidate the parts of the black magical ego-complex into three priinary parts, which are to be viewed in terms of the develop­ing sorcerer, and not as applicable to the ordinary human being who resides solely within the confines of the Dayside self and is unwittingly subjected to the forces of the human social realm and the entropy of ordinary existence. 118"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Outer Ego (Dayside SelO The outer ego or dayside self is a point in space­time. It is the self as presented to the hlllllan social \\vorld of every day affairs and as such should be completely subjected to the greater will of the Black Magician. It is what the rest of the world will refer to as your personality or who you are. The average human being typically dwells within this part of the ego for the entirety of their lives, believing it to be what they are and will always be. It is the socialized self lull ed into absolute complacency by the dictates of the average world. The outer ego is a social fabrication made up out of a combination of our carnal selves and the description of ourselves that we have been given by outside influences throughout our lives. The outer ego is a necessity as much as is the physical body. How much of you is actually you and how much is part of the description and dialogue that you have assimilated? The dayside self is a paper thin mirage that has its origin in one's personal family history and socialized conditions and it is what dictates the flow of our personal vital energy and subsequently the course of our entire lives.

With this powerful understanding we can literally create a dayside outer personage that best serves our more exalted aims. The ib is where thoughts are produced and we mistakenly believe these thoughts are ourselves. We must step outside of this process and take possession and eventual dominion over our ib. As part of this task a personalized and comprehensive study of applied cognitive behavioral psychology would serve one well. The process of self reconstruction is highly involved and demanding in the beginning and will take a few years to gain its own momentum, but once its effects begin to ripple throughout the world, it will build upon itself and be,come less of an actual effort on the part of the sorcerer. The best way to begin is always with a blank slate. You do not necessarily have to change your name and relocate to a new city or job, but the less people know about you at tltis stage, the better as it will enable the sorcerer to intentionally calculate each aspect of their self and present it 120"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"to the world in alignment with their sorcery goals. Of course having well defined sorcery goals is a very basic essential step as well, and one that may shift and change while one is also simultaneously engaged in constructing the day­side self. This outer ego will be what you present to the people you encounter on a regular basis out of necessity. Do not bother including family members or those who have known you all your life since childhood. What you should do with these people is to interact with them in an insulated manner, never letting these people engage you in the presence of the people you have to interact with in the outside world. Keep family interactions on exclusive terms and preferably done in a far removed locality fron1 where you cmTentiy live. Family and lifelong friends define. a person even more than they define themselves, so we need to rid ourselves of this overpowering influence before we move on. Aleister Crowley states in Family Public Enemy No. 1 in his book Magick Without Tears; \"In every Magical, or similar system, it is invaria­bly the first condition which the Aspirant must fulfill: he must once and for all and for ever put his family outside his magical circle. Even the Gospels insist clearly and weightily on this. Christ himself (i.e. whoever is meant by this name in this passage) callously disowns his mother and his brethren (Luke VIII, 19).

The Black Magician knows these things and seeks to better understand this dual nature in order to capitalize on its attributes. Due to the truly intangible nature of this outer social shell, we can see how easy it is to intentionally construct, feed and augment the \"outer\" ego in a way that will feed and energize an even more profound and deeper part of our black magical ego construct that I like to call the celebrity ego. This is simply my preferred name and I shall in tum explain why. Think of the dayside self or outer ego as the \"personality\" that those with whom you have immediate contact with experience every time they encounter you.

'fhe Celebrity Ego is the woman or man on the stage; the idea of who someone is held in the minds of hundreds or thousands of people and based on the larger than life qualities that the Black Magician has self actualized and projected upon the masses. It is the dream image of the self, given a life of its mvn and made immortal in the energetic realm and in the material world by the life force that has been fed into it. Anton LaVey ·writes; \"A magician has only two choices: accept the subjective world of others and manipulate within its framework, or create a subjective \\vorld of his mvn and go at it with such daring and self-confidence that through contagion it will then become the idealized world of others\" (from The Cloven Hoof. Volume 13, Number two). The Nightside self is the image others hold in their minds of us with all the particular associations and nuances to enhance that image. \\Vhen I think of or have a dream of Aleister Crowley, I am directly tapping into his nightside self, or Celebrity Ego.

This is true of many other notable sorcerers, a more recent example being the late Anton Szandor LaVey whose nightside self is still expanding and growing stronger because the magical work he set into motion was so potent and the principles upon which he founded Satanism so fundamentally sound that a momentum was created that would continue to deeply influence the minds of certain individuals far into the future. These great magicians began as people set within the midst of the human herd. Yes, they were certainly extraordinary by any standard, and this inbom nature is what gave them the ability to eventually consolidate the immortal presence that they are today, however each Black Magician is highly individual and different in their own way and achieving this kind of celebrity status in the world of human affairs is simply not the proper path for all of us. Some few of us will indeed reach these levels in our own unusually stratified subculture, but the rest will naturally find their own place and degree of relative fame and notoriety. There are many paths to the creation of the nightside self and just as many versions of it. What matters is that through the willed manipulation of the dayside ego we create a vibrant and powerful image in the minds of others that will give birth to the nightside self, or Celebrity Ego. We may never achieve the legendary status of rock star or occult legend in the minds of the entire human race, but we shall definitely become immortal within the sphere of 126"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"our own influence; legends with perhaps only a local reach, but always as creatures outside the realm of the ordinary. This is the perfected image of the Black Magician as it exists within the realm of social human affairs. The first step in the process of creating your rock star self is through the basic corporeal medium of appearance and yom· material environn1ent within which you reside. One must face the fact that in Westem culture, appearances are every­thing. Your behavior will then be used to enhance and breathe life into the.o;;e aspects of who you seek to become. First, remember not to overdo anything. This rule shall extend itself into almost everything that you will do. Begin by assessing in the most honest manner possible your physical appearance. You need not be an Adonis or Venus in physical form to work your dark magic. What is necessary however is realistically understanding how you appear to others so that you can modify this in the most advantageous ways possible. Certainly if you are a strikingly gorgeous specimen you will be quite able to use this in whatever way you see fit, but even with these qualities you will have to be cautious and calculated in your self-presentation so that you may avoid the debilitating energy drain so often experienced by the most beautiful among our kind.

Being very physically attractive as a sorcerer creates certain pre-127"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"conditions in regard to how ordinary human beings will interact with you and this can be a limiting factor in some instances, unless one's actions and activities are planned accordingly. This however is not generally the case with most of us, so we need to first look at other potential issues with our physical appearance. Our top concem should be our basic physique. If one is overweight one should consider how much weight they can carry without looking overweight and thus imbalanced. I see this as more of an issue for the warlock rather than the witch because many women can very effective.ly capital­ize on a curvy, full figtrred body type while males generally look out of shape when they have too much weight. Of cotrrse there are always exceptions to this idea, so if you happen to be a larger, more portly type of male there are ways to make this work for you. Overall I believe that too much body fat ages men and makes them auto­matically look older than they are. If you do find that you are simply not within the standards you have set for yourself, then your first sorcerous act will be to bend intent in the direction of re-shaping your body; beckoning the powers of darkness to aid you in the task of shedding the unwanted fat from your physical shell. Do not attempt to go any further with the construction of your nightside self until this has been positively achieved. There is no reason to begin outwardly displaying eccentricities of character or dress that will add to your aggrandized image when you are still in the process of dramatic physical change. 128"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Bearing this in mind, one should not present themselves to the outside world as the \"character\" that they are until one's optimum weight has been decided on and achieved. Once this has been done one need only work to enhance one's physique and this can be done through many means ranging from daily trips to the gym (preferably where no one knows you or at a 24 hour facility at night) to cosmetic surgery with which wondrous physical alterations can be achieved. The true Black Magician rejects no means or method in their pursuit of the non� human and the quest for individual inunortality. Once perfected, the body should become as a canvas on which you shall work your desire and present those i1mer abstractions outwardly to the conunon reahn of ordinary human affairs. The next matter for your attention shall be dress. For the diabolically inclined, manner of dress is of vital importance in the presentation of the self, but it is not a simple matter at all. Walking down the street looking like Vlad the Impaler or ·Morgana Le Fay may draw a lot of attention from passer byes and acquaintances, but this degree of fascination is best left for very specialized works of black magic. Being obviously eccentric in the loudest manner possible is counterproductive in the early stages of self�enhancement. 'There may come a time when you have reached the point where the alien appearance of an utterly realized Black 1\\Iagician is necessary and probably inevitable. Look at Diabolus Rex, former Magister of the Church of Satan for instance. He long ago achieved the black magical 129"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"transcendence of the mundane human and continued this transmogrification through com­plete immersion in total environments and body modification. This example is obviously consistent with the most advanced stages of sorcery and the adept who believes that they can instantly jump to this stage is here warned that the consequences will in all likelihood be laughable at best and tragic at worst. You may at first have an image within your mind of you as a totally self created entity, and it is completely acceptable if this image changes over time. However, one needs to commit to a kind of general direction in which to move. Dramatically changing your overall plans and goals with too much frequency will yield nothing in the end. First always know thyself. If you want to become the dark, mysterious (and wealthy) witch in that strange house at the end of the block to whmn everyone secretly pay visits for spells and potions, then you need to commit to the basic attributes tl-mt this character will need in order to become manifest. If you want to become the reclusive yet strangely well known poet, then you will have to achieve excellence within the sphere of writing. There are very few of us who will find they can do next to nothing and yet somehow generate a massive celebrity ego simply by being one's self. The masses want to be dazzled and in today's world of instant gratification through the application of social media, it is more difficult in some ways and easier in others for us to generate a vital and enduring character image that will strongly influence others and maintain its 130"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"momentum runong masses of over stimulated consttn1ers. Dressing the part does not mean that you go out and buy a new wardrobe. It means that you find a subtle way to alter your appearance in a way that will imply the image you are intending. This type of subtlety is especially important in the beginning. People become bored when they are overly familiar with anything, so I recommend a subdued version of what you would consider yoUl.\" projected celebrity appearance, or what you intend to eventually be in the eyes of others. There is still plenty of magic left in the world, but most have simply forgotten how to access it and this leave an abundance of this untapped energy for the skill ed Black Magicians use. By c-reating an image of yoUl.\"self that is bigger than life and itnpossible for ordinary people to get a firm grasp on, you are breathing living sorcery into the world of mortals. You must become something else and this requires living as some­thing else. The root of the matter in the creation of the celebrity self is the continual bridging between the physical and etheric energetic planes. This back and forth interaction initiated by the efforts of the Black Magician creates a kind of matrix of friction where one establishes a place to birth the nightside self. The intended self that will eventually live and breathe on all planes and within the minds of others. The actual sorcery methods to initiate this friction are many, but I recommend my own variation on an extremely powerful sorcery technique having its roots in the mysteries of the Toltecs and the works of Castaneda. 131"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The sorcery practice of \"the recapitulation\" as introduced in Castaneda's books is a technique which is essentially aimed at separating the socialized self and the calcified energy trapped within that form in order to redirect one's energy for new abstract pursuits. The recapitulation has a few different variations and I do not intend this to be an instructional guide for its practice as the adept can simply look it up and do further research when they are ready. The basic recapitulation requires that the sorcerer make a detailed list of all the people they have ever known and mentally re-live each experience with each of these people while engaging in a special form of breathing control. My addition to this technique which is specific to the goal of manifesting the nightside self is to perform a standard recapitulation session for 30 minutes to an hour at the end of which the sorcerer will reverse the breathing technique and begin to strongly visualize themselves as their most idealized celebrity/nightside self. I shall enumerate the steps. 1. Go to your ritual chamber and sit comfortably 2. Close your eyes and think about the individual you will recapitulate. 3. Start with your head forward and begin to slowly breathe in and out while turning your head from right to left. 4. As you turn your head towards the left concen­trate on the interactions you had with the individual while breathing back in the energy you left behind in the interaction with them. 132"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"5.

Do this until thoroughly exhausted of the practice. What you are essentially doing here is intending your own re-manifestation from the realm of the abstract into that of the physical, thus creating the friction necessary to achieve eventual form.

Sex magic itself is a term thrown about with abandon and with little care for its origins or proper usage. For the Black Magician, sex magic is a vital tool that can be easily employed to dramatically alter perception and reality itself within the sorcerer's sphere of influence. As with all things magical, when I focus and magnify a specific sorcery topic I like to ask myself why so little is known about the area in question. Many times, the topic has a long tradition of being well hidden from outsiders as is the case of some Mro-shamanic systems. In others it is simply because a would-be magician made up the system in its entirety in an effort to gain favor, fame or wealth through the sale of fancy \"grimoires.\" In many cases these systems prove to be legitimate totalities unto themselves and suffice as paths to the unknown and in some cases these sorceries legitimize themselves through use over many years; Wicca being a prime example of this phenomenon. The primary reason that I find in depth information often lacking is the simple fact that no one really knows anything about it, and when an alleged expert is approached you can be sure that they shall lead you down halls of smoking mirrors and on the wildest chases imaginable.

From my perusal of these works, I gathered that most of the authors of sex magic occult related material blended together what they could find out concerning tantric sex yoga, other yoga like practices and westem style cere.monial magick. This was generally the theme many of these books seemed to carry during that brief era in magical publications. There was much deep breathing during intercourse, much visualization of the chakras and much circulation of energy. This is all fine and well, even from the self centered, \"I\" driven perspective of the Black School because within these rudimentary practices one would most certainly develop a core of discipline which in tum will of course consolidate one's magical will even further. We shall not dismiss practical and sound sorcery practice regardless of its unsavory origin if in the end it helps to produce a Black Magician of high standards, achievement, skill and caliber. But where do we go from having mastered the fundamentals? The ancient sorcerers of Mexico and South America understood sexual energy to be a real, tangible substance that one either had in abundance or lacked. When we speak of energy as a substance it is done as a kind of prop. Dealing with an energetic reality forces us to make certain exceptions with how we choose to interact '\\\\-ith that world and we are caught in a position where we can either name a thing or not be capable of having a reference point with which 137"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"to refer. Talking about energy in terms of a physical substance that can be stored like nuts for the winter is one of these exceptions and it is done to aid us in manipulating this energy in the direction we desire. For the ancient ones, sexual energy was a fixed personal attribute and one either had an abundance of it or one needed to store it due to a deficiency. There are of course those rare individuals who we could say fall right in the middle, displaying perfectly balanced sexual energy. 1bis being their sexual energetic world schemata, the ancient ones advised those with a normal amount of sexual energy or a deficiency to store it for acts of sorcery rather than wasting it on sexual intercourse without the result of human conception. This is the simplified version of these sorcery tenets passed down to us through the works of Carlos Castaneda and other Toltec sorcery writers and practitioners and as with all things acquired, we of the Black School take that which we have found works and leave the rest to rest. From a Left Hand Path perspective we can clearly see the most optimal way in which to regard sexual energy. As a young magician I was for some years under the tutelage of a more experienced sorcerer who told me that he under­stood that the retention and redeployment of sex­ual energy by the adept was essentially the magical sexual formula of the Black School of magic in that its aim was to prevent the sexual energy of the sorcerer from being t.mintentionally absorbed back into the \"universal\" energy matrix at large. He said that the white magician seeks 138"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"total release and Dionysian gnosis through sexual union and complete identification with a sexual partner (and thus the \"god\" or \"goddess\") while the Black Adept strives to accumulate unimaginable levels of energy for purposes of dramatic perceptual alteration, acts of dreaming, re-manifestation, physical longevity and many other diabolical, \"self ish\" pursuits. As the years went on I continually tested this basic assertion, developing over much time a very clear understanding of the practice call ed karezza. The magical conception of the universe is symbolic of greater realities and energetic themes that expand and run through all of existence. My one time teacher tried to simplify these ideas for me saying that white sex magic relies on a build up and final release while Left Hand Path sex magic is based around the buildup, retention and redirection of the accumulated energy with no sexual release; the release being substituted by the pragmatic goals of the dark sorcerer. This is a simplification of an entire realm of sex magic discipline and my intention is to provide the Left Hand Path adept with a rare and unusual introduction into the sex magic practices of the Black School. The practice of Karezza is the foundation of Left Hand Path sex magic, or the sexual sorcery of the Black School.

The complete essay can be found in Pandora's Mansion Volume One, Dark Harvest Occult Publishers. Suffice it to say that the Black Magician's methods concem utilizing the natural se�--ual energy that flows through the power zones of the hmnan body in a way that strictly enables the sorcerer to accmnulate more power in the material as well as energetic sense, and to channel this power in specific ways which are always aimed at enhancing and preserving the sorcerer's basic interests. The practice of Karezza is intense and can be dangerous if the proper procedures are not followed. When the Black Magician begins this form of sorcery, they must mtderstand that if they are very yo� in years, they will experience intense pain even if the body's vital energy is properly circulated throughout the power centers. I began this practice around the age of 23 and due to my already high level of pranic sexual energy I would often experience pain in certain areas of my body. This is caused by either a failure to properly circulate the buildup of energy throughout the physical body, or because 142"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the individual practitioner already has too much accumulated energy and it is in an imbalanced state. If this is the case, karezza will throw one's entire energetic system into a feverish state of which pain and mild mental imbalance can result. Visualization is both a discipline and an art. It is necessary for the sorcerer to constantly and continually seek to develop this talent. To visualize well is to intend intent itself into acts of sublime creation of will. When we visualize properly we are effectively moving energy in a particular direction and this is why the practice of visualization is so heavily emphasized in almost every basic magical text of any theoretical orientation whatsoever. If you cannot visualize or find that you are having difficulty with it, I sugg est unremitting practice until you find that it has become easier. These difficulties on the Left Hand Path are of the kind that are most welcome, and the Black Masters smile to themselves when they see a new initiate experience apparently insurmountable obstacles. These obstacles themselves truly indicate where the adept will eventually find their greatest strengths and talents . ... These temporary hindrances are what shape us and give us the chance of attaining dominion. The late Kenneth Grant is one of the few occult scholars who offers his readers sound informa­tion concerning karezza as a sorcery technique. In The Magical Revival (1972) Grant touches on the practice and gives us a somewhat elusive, yet sound place for the Black Magician to start their explorations. 143"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"\"Objurations against masturbation, onanism, coitus interruptus, karezza and other apparently sterile methods of using sexual energy , follow logically upon awareness (however consciously unacknowledged this awareness may be) of the sacramental nature of the generative act.

As Crowley notes: \"The ancient Jewish Rabbim; knew thL.;;, and taught that before Eve was given to Adam the demon Lilith was conceived by the spilth of his dreams, so that the hybrid races satyrs, elves, and the like began to populate those secret places of the earth which are not sensible by the organs of the normal man. \" Generally speaking, the view that sexual practices which do not result in the production of physical human offspring are \"abuses\" of energy is close to correct.

The idea that all forms of Left Hand Path sexual sorcery lead to the creation of malignant phantasmal and etheric beings is an oversilnplifi­cation and reeks of old world superstition. The sexual energy built up by the Black Magician through the practice of karezza certainly is willfully directed and does in fact find a \"field of operation\" in the matrix which the dark sorcerer has intentionally created for it. The Left Hand Path view of this \"field of nature\" is that it is formed of the Black Magician's intent through long periods of development over tilne. The sorcerer does not regard the etheric as a passive field of activity as does our right hand path counterparts, but instead understands it to be akin to the sorcerer's second field or nightside which has been intentionally identi­fied, constructed and built up over time through the forces of will and intent. Black Magicians exist within this field or matrix of their own construction and all acts of magic that take place therein are purposeful and directed. Black Magicians above all others are hoarders of energy. We are misers with our precious resources and would silnply not tolerate the unintentional creation of entities who would wreak havoc in our lives. The idea that the spilt seed breeds these creatures if it does not find a home in the womb of a woman is silnply primitive and anilnistic in its metaphysics. 145"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Grant defines karezza as \"a method of sexual magic advocated in the West by Thomas Lake Harris (1823-1906) who adapted the formula from certain Tantric practices of building up magical energy by erotic stimulation and by suppressing its expression on the physical plane in order to create astral entities or magical manikins on the astral plane. \" While this type of operation is highly feasible, so are many others and it only makes sense that if the sorcerer is capable of building up magical energy through sexual stimulation and of suppressing its ordinary expression in favor of utilizing it for sorcery ends, then they should be able to direct this energy in a variety of ways. The use of karezza in sigil magic is a well known application and essentially represents, in basic form the method whereby any other magical operation using this method would be structured. In sigil sorcery, the magician sexually stimulates themselves while focusing on a self created sigil designed to embody some particular desire or objective. The sorcerer then attains orgasmic release while gazing at or visualizing the sigil and then promptly puts the sigil away, forgetting about the operation in order to let the unconscious mind do its work. Variations on this type of sorcery include anointing the sigil with the sexual fluids and or carrying the sigil on one's person until the specified objective has been made manifest. Some also choose to destroy the sigil in a ceremo­nial manner. While this can be a very effective sorcery practice, it is not properly karezza, as there is a release of the energy in orgasm. Properly performed, karezza is the sexual stimu­lation repeatedly brought to the pre-orgasmic 146"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"stage and then held off while the sorcerer's intent is f()(_'llsed on their primary objective. No orgasm is attained in this operation and the climax of the sorcery, instead of being a physical orgasm is the release of the magician's will into the void of their creative intent. A specific ceremonial climax may be designed to represent the attainment of the goal, or the sorcerer may simply choose to slowly return to an ordinary state of consciousness, letting the process resemble more of an intense and willful meditation. As we shall soon see, the sexual energies built up within the body through kaxezza may also be physically moved to chosen power zones within and without the body, corresponding to the Adept's Left Hand Path initiation and the power zones on the Tree of Night. In the Sorceries of Zos from Cults of the Shadow, Grant elaborates on his personal adapta­tion of karezza for a system of dream control. 'The mechanics of dream control are in many ways similar to those which effect conscious astral projection. My own system of dream control derives from two sources: the formula of Erato-Comatose Lucidity di.<;covered by Ida Nellidoff and adapted by Crowley to his sex-magical techniques, and Spare's system of Sentient Sigils explained below. Sleep should be preceded by some form of Karezza during which a specially chosen sigil symbolizing the desired object is vividly visualized. In this manner the libido is baulked of its natural fantasies and seeks satisfaction in the dream world. When the knack L<; acquired the dream will be extremely intense and dominated by a succubae, or shadow-woman, with whom se.1..-u al intercourse occurs spontaneously. If the dreamer has acquired 147"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"even a moderate degree of proficiency in this technique he will be aware of the continued presence of the sigil. This he should bind upon the form of the succubae in a place that is within range of his vision during copulation, e.g. , as a pendant suspended from her neck; as ear-drops; or as the diadem in a circlet about her brow. Its locus should be determined by the magician with respect to the position he adopts during coitus. The act will then assume all the characteristics of a Ninth Degree Working, because the presence of the Shadow­Woman will be experienced with a Divid intensity of sensation and clari ty of vision. \" Admittedly, this is a highly personal and devel­oped method of applying the technique of Karezza to tl1e development of the energy body and subsequently of attaining expertise in the arts of dreaming. As advanced as this technique is I can understand how Grant came to rely on it, yet I would always tend to recommend basic dreaming practices as a solid fmmdation for the sorcerer. TI1e basics are those techniques which develop the Black Magician's \"'ill to a peak of sharpness, allowing them to leap forward into new and more complicated sorcery abstractions. Utilizing the sorcery dreaming practices associated with the first two Gates of Dreaming will only bolster more advance.d dream control such as the one provided by grant. A powerful variant on this technique could be to ensure that the \"specially chosen sigil\" to which Grant refers is constructed witJ1 the. sole intent of accomplish­ing greater control in dreaming. In this way the se:A-ual sorcery of Karezza will be both directed at the act of dreaming while the specially con­structed sigil will become a living battery of dreaming energy and a vital portal into powerful 148"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"ch·eam lucidity. What I am essentially doing here is simply elaborating on Grant's technique by illustrating that the sigilized object of desire should be formulated around the primary desire to dream lucidly and not simply representing any random desire or sorcery goal. Most Black �:Iagicians who ru·e committed to becoming expert dreamers have enough chi.ve and desire to energize and work with a sigil in this way. This is not to say that the technique will not work with a sigil representing another objective, but I ·will venture to say that the resulting dream states may be more difficult to control and dominated by the naturally inherent properties of the sigil used. I would recommend trying multiple variations of the basic formula which Grant goes on to provide. \"Briefly, the formula hCL<; three stages: • Karezza, or unculminating sexual activity, with visu alization of the Sigil until sleep supervenes. • Sexual congress in the dream-state with the Shadow-woman evoked by Stage I. The Sigil should appear automatically at this second stage; if it does not, the practice must be re­peated at another time. If it does, then the de­sired result will reify in Stage. • After awakening (i.e. in the mundane world of everyday phenomena). A word of explanation is, perhaps, necessary concerning the term Karezza as used in the present context. Retention of semen is a concept of central importance in certain Tantric practices, the idea 149"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"being that the hindu (seed) then breeds astrally, not physically. In other words, an entity of some sort is brought to birth at astral levels of conscious­ness. This, and analogous techniques, have given rise to the impression -- quite erroneous -- that celibacy is a sine qua non of magical success; but such celibacy is of a purely local character and confined to the physical plane, or waking state, alone. Celibacy, as commonly understood, is there­fore a meaningless parody or travesty of the true formula.\" It seems that in this particular operation, Grant emphasizes the role of the Shadow-woman, or succubae. My natural conclusion regarding this is that the initial energetic charge built up by the practice of Karezza and then transferred to the sigil gives excitation and vitality to the sorcerer's dreaming emissary, who will then proceed to energetically seek to establish a much stronger dreaming connection with the sorcerer as was originally intended in the creation of the sigil. The sexual congress with this inorganic being is in all actuality an energetic bonding of the Black Magician's dream double with the dark energy that emanates from the shadow's world and eventually through practice and regular intercourse, one will only need visualize the dreaming sigil before falling into sleep in order to illicit immediate congress with the emissary. I will reiterate here that this operation as it relates to Karezza is really not a n ecessary consideration for the female sorcerer engaging in dreaming practices. Dreaming in itself is a completely separate discipline for the female and they 150"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"almost always tend to not need the \"props\" that we males need to rely on for any degree of progress. The perceptual sex of the succubae is irrelevant and will of course be determined by one's sexual leanings. Following Grant's short outline of this system for dream control he goes on to a vital explanation of the differences between the magical practice of Karezza, the retention of physical semen in the body of the male sorcerer and the act of celibacy. He states that celibacy as understood in the profane sense is meaningless in relation to the true magical formula. Here, what is meant is that the act of sexual celibacy as a permanent feature of the Black Magician's sorcery practice is unnecessary in order for magical progress and attainment to occur, however I must add that there are truly few drawbacks in the choice of celibacy for any practitioner whose interests and activities reside outside the realms of sex sorcery. For the Black Magician, celibacy is not seen as a blasphemy as it is by many a Thelemite. Instead it is viewed as a severe and demanding path chosen by the very few who can truly benefit from the rare gifts it can bestow to its adherents. For the Black 1\\Iagician, utilizing the sorcery practices of Karezza while also walk­ing the path of sexual celibacy inevitably results in the attainment of power at a level difficult to desc'libe and a state of existence that could be quite undesirable to some. Also, we must consider what the sorcerer Don Juan had to say to Carlos Castaneda regarding celibacy as the optimum way to acquire and store enough 151"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"personal energy to successfully engage in dream­ing. Personally, I believe that Castaneda was \"handled\" by his teacher in a very specific way catering to his own personal strengths and weaknesses, and that one's level of sexual energy as it relates to dreaming is not an all or nothing affair (see Dreaming the Labyrinth of Penumbra). I have personally maintained extremely long periods of celibacy, devoting all my energy towards dream sorcery only to finally achieve my desired results after giving in and indulging myself in sexual relations. This is a perfect example of etheric tensions being built up through my concentrated will and intent to eventually become energized by the culmination of a sexual act then forgetting of the original goal. The retention of semen as the physical inevitabil­ity of the practice of Karezza can be handled in primarily two ways. It may be retained indefi­nitely and naturally released by the body through non-sexual processes such as regular urination, or it may be ritually consumed during sexual sorcery practices or utilized to anoint sigilized talismans or energetically feed servitors. The expenditure of physical semen during a naturally occurring nocturnal emission should not be considered a loss of energy or power, but simply as the body's natural reaction to a practice that essentially interferes with the body's routine functioning. The most important thing to keep in mind is that semen should not be expended care­lessly during the ongoing course of magical operations. How long semen is retained and in what manner it is finally released will of course 152"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"be determined by the nature of the operation in question. I should also here briefly mention the magical properties and potential use of the pre-ejaculatory fluid that will accumulate during the utilization of Karezza and in states of high sexual arousal. From a Black Magical perspective this substance is a very desirable result of the energy built up during intense sexual agitation. It should be used in dream sorcery to anoint the Aj na energy center as well as any other chakra point on the physical body corresponding to the nature of the sorcery operation engaged in. This clear substance is the true elixir vitae of sexual shadow sorcery and due to its energetic potency it can be most effectively used in works of vampiric domination where the Black Magician anoints their chosen sexual partner on certain points over their body before engaging in vampiric sexual intercourse. This will essentially \"pin\" down the victim and make the resulting energy transfer easier to achieve. Of course, in this technique, the sorcerer will copulate with the victim until they have been exhausted of all the available pranic force. Mter the operation the sorcerer must then retreat to a quiet place in order to properly circulate and effectively store the energetic gains they have made. The consumption of this fluid by the sorcerer in conjunction with a proper diet and regular physical activity will have a tendency to harden and keep the body young while also sharpening the senses. Over time the practice of Karezza will have the over-arching effect of encapsulating the Black 153"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Magician within a bio-energetic field initiated by their own non-hmnan intent. This self-created shell develops a sustaining force that becomes impregnable by random and unwanted influences stemming from the entropic forces of ordinary consensual reality. The metaphysical formula of Left Hand Path sex magic directly coincides with the formula 89 of the Black School of Magic. It is a turning away from the distorted evolutionary path of the modem hmnan being in favor of the assertion of the individual sorcerer's own creative will in the cosmos. The Black Magician takes those major elements of their implied predestination as physical hmnan beings on this planet and masters each one on a path leading away from their absorption and destruction. This is the true and sublime meaning of the inverted pentagram as the primary and dominant seal of the way of the Black Adept. This way of inversion sometimes termed \"the Backwards Way,\" is the beginning of the trans­mogrification of the total consciousness and energy shape of the individual. Accmnulated sexual energy should be circulated throughout the physical body by means of breathing and visualization. Our essential energies reside in those places within us where we have placed some kind of emphasis, and energetic imbalances will almost always manifest as physical imperfec­tions and disease of mind and body. But, as the sorcerer knows through experience, there is the wider field that we must consider in the experiential existence of the sorcerer's energy body typically described as the lmninous egg like 154"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"stt.ucture which envelopes us and extends out­ward a few feet from the physical self. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but as all sorcerers know it can indeed be tt.·ansferred and transformed. The initial boost in one's overall energy through the build up of sexual energy during karezza will act as a catalyst and cause an immediate shift in the assemblage point. This shift will then typically be accompanied by an increase in magical ability, enhanced sensory perception and greater capability in the realms of dreaming and vampiric energy gathering techniques. The one consistent ability I have noticed increase is that of basic visualization. This seems to be true no matter where I have decided to direct an increase in energy, as if the buildup of sexual energy derived from Karezza overflows the power zones of the body and amplifies their natural functioning. In the chakra zone of .Ajna, enhanced visualization seems to be the result. I recommend keeping a sorcery joumal specifically devoted to the practice of this form of sexual magic, placing particular emphasis on these greater and more subtle changes as one's energy increases. Let the asp:u.-ant experiment and create, but also let there always be the unbending and primary intent needed to stabilize the force of this practice. Without the sobriety of a true Black Magician energetic imbalances will inevitably occur and the sorcerer will believe thetnselves to have \"achieved\" their goal purely as a result of 155"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"the residual powers. As a kind of magical base line, one should choose to emphasize their basic physical self and their physical health thereby devising the most optimum ways to channel this refined sexual energy throughout the body and effectively slowing down and eventually reversing the entropy of physical ageing. Once again, with­out health and longevity, the Black l\\'Iagician will not become capable of permanently fortifying themselves in opposition to the deleterious effects of ol�jective existence and the material plane. Celibacy in conjunction with the practice of Ka­rezza is a fundamental formula for success in all black magical endeavors and it is also an excellent way for the beginner in black sex magic to introduce themselves to the eventual complexities of Left Hand Path sexual sorcery. It offers a stable platform to leap into other practices and is subsequently just as stable on the return journey. The key to the regular application of Karezza is to turn away from sexual interest immediately afte,r its practice and begin to engage in other non-sexually related activities. If Karezza begins to engender sexual obsessions that lead to compulsive behavior of any kind, then it should be ende,d. This is not to say that the sorcerer should not be as creative as they wish when engaging in its practice. As long as the practice itself does not become its O\\Vn addiction one may explore as many avenues of black magical pe1:versity as they see fit, under­standing that true titillation and arousal is a veritable art and to achieve this yet deny one's 156"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"self the inunediate reward of physical ecstasy in favor of abstract goals is something only the very few will accomplish. As one realigns themselves energetically with the energetic curr ents of opposition they will necessruily need to bolster themselves with the naturally occurring cycles of the universe, giving themselves the advantage of a kind of routine whereby they will align their own sorcery intent with the phases of the moon and eventually with the traditional yearly Sahbats of the Witches. \\Vhen starting a cycle of Karezza, the Black Adept shall begin by engaging in the ritual practice as the moon is on the increase. These rites can be accompanied by oilier ceremonial work and infernal lunar adoration. No orgasmic clima..� should he permitted as the moon wa.. �es to full, but instead all one's acctunulated pranic force should be circulated and distributed evenly throughout the body's power zones and directed at the strengthening of the dream double and towards any other sorcery objective. Final orgasmic release should only occur on the night of the full moon and within a ceremonial context, directing all force towards the abstract directives. Mter the night of the full moon, as the moon now wanes, no sexual activity or practice should be engaged in at all. This includes sexually stimulating forms of entertain­ment. During the dark lunar phases formula 89 should be regarded in its strictest sense and the denial of sexual arousal and pleasure should be the rule. This dark cycle should once again be followed by the waxing phase of karezza practice !57"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"and the buildup of extreme sexual tensions. It should be noted here that one's practices can certainly be done with a partner of whatever sexual persuasion as long as physical orgasm is denied. Obviously vampiric sexual sorcery requires this and this form of engagement can be enacted at regular intervals throughout the various waxing cycles. Mter the Black Adept has achieved a level of competency with the lunar cycles and have aligned themselves competently, then they may begin to consider the yearly Sabbats as these times relate to our dark doctrine. Sexual release for the sole purpose of pleasure and bodily excitation should take place specifically on nine nights of the yearly cycle. These occasions should be well planned debaucheries devoted to the clark powers, self deification and unrestrained lust. They should resemble the traditional witches' Sabbath and may even center on the work of a traditional satanic coven and the su·engthening of that coven's chosen clark egregore. Four main Sabbats should be observed on Samhain or the night of October 31st and into the darkness of November 1st, on Cancllemass which is the night of February 1st into the darkness of March 1st, again on Walpurgis which is the night of April 30th and finally on Lammas which is on the night of July 31st. These ceremonial revelries may be structured in any way that excites and stimulates and they are best conducted in privacy and isolation away from the judging and prying eyes of the herd. The complete exhaustion of the 158"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"senses is the objective of these events, devoted ultimately to personal pleasure and the glorifica­tion of darknes...;; over that of light. Multiple participants are recommended as are all the trappings of a good Saturnalia celebration. 1ne four lesser revelries should take place on the night of December 22nd, March 22nd, June 22nd and September 22nd. These minor Sabbats correspond roughly with the estbats of the yearly cycle and should more properly be devoted to lesser celebrations and works of dark sorcery. These are ideal times for personal or group work­ings of a wholly materialistic nature perhaps followed by celebrations of the flesh and senses. The abstract sorcery objective here is both the experience of extreme forms of indulgence and the nurturing on non-ordinary appetites as well as the energetic clearing out of one's energetic tensions that have built up through the use of the dark formulas throughout the yearly lunar phases. The last night of ecstasy should be on the night of one's day of birth. I have adopted Anton LaVey's assertion that one's birthday is the most important high holiday of the year as is in keeping with the self-centric nature of the Left Hand Path in general. I personally set aside this day for enj oyments of a strictly personal nature followed by a night of carnal realization all devoted towards mine own self as an expression of willed self creation. This is a night to indulge and revel in one's achievements. All of these festivities can be specifically planned with regard to personal taste but once they pass, the Black Magician should immediately resume their regular cycle of Karezza without deviation. Only in this way will true success with this method be experienced. 159"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"09I"}]
