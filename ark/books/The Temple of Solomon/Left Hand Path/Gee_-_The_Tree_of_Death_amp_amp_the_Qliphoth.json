Grant, in turn, based his attributions on Crowley. Crowley and Waite based their attributions on Levi. Levi based his attributions mainly on the Zohar, though, by elaboration upon the points therein introduced, managed to stray far enough from the original source as to be considered entirely original.Now. the work of Levi was based largely on the contents of Kabbalah Denudata. later translated by Mathers, the Bahir, Sefer Yetzirah. and the ten luminous emanations of Isaac Luria. These works themselves were the result of a laborious sifting through the Tanakh to cull as many correspondent attributions as possible. The Sefer Yetzirah and the Kabbalah Denudata had taken the correspondences of the Bahir, and applied them directly to the system of the Ten Luminous Emanations of the Ari Zohar. The result of this was the Naples Arrangement of the Tree of Life diagram.Crowley and Waite began to cull the opposite attributes to create a concept of the Tree of Death. At this point we have Crowley's poetic writings, such as the second chapter (first resh) of liber vel Ararita. Crowley’s only fault in this regard, though by replication and modification of error, it has proven already by now to be an egregious one, was relying not on prior holy works alone as his guide for seeking these opposite attributes, but in juxtaposing those which he had gathered in 777. Waite, for his part, merely regurgitated Levi, offering no relevant commentary on the arrangement of the system other than an unmodified Tree of Life model.Grant further elaborated upon these negative attributes, and began to establish a greater premise for their interior correspondence, just as had Crowley before him paved the way, continuing to accumulate anterior correspondences of a priori attributions, adding eastern associations. To further complicate the matter. Grant appeal's to have focused more on the base 22 negative attributes which Crowley had culled as adverse correspondences in 777, and thus, effected an apparent discontinuation of Levi and Waite’s base 10 system for the Tree of Death.Savedow, thus, in attempting to create a diagram of the Tree of Death upon which to chart the correspondences established by Grant for the negative attributes gathered by Crowley and Waite from Levi and other sources, was confronted with not one, but two separate systemic sets: Crowley’s base 10 system of rulers, culled largely from Levi, elaborated upon by Crowley’s contemporary and rival, Waite, translating Levi; and Grant's base 22 system elaborating on Crowley's brief and enigmatic reference to the sigils of the qliphoth. Further complicating this matter was the vaguery of Crowley's contribution upon which Grant had based his line of research (vis. Liber Osiris Amoun and the whole of the QJiphoth).Now, before we can begin to analyse this system devised by Crowley, Grant and Savedow, we should note that it was, for each of them individually, a most difficult endevour, and add that the cumulative effort of their combined contributions suffered as a result of this personal difficulty each brought with them to the table.For merely one small example, Crowley himself fully abandoned the project in favour of heroin, and his magnum opus, the Rota of Tehuti. which I personally believe was originally set to be a combination of ha qabalistic and ha qliphotic systems, was rushed, late in his life, to exclude all its potential qliphotic attributes, being based, instead, purely on his own qabalistic correspondences from 777, with a somewhat vain attempt to colour this with the inclusion of the hexagrams from the 1 Ching, an"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"To begin analysing the Tree of Death diagram, as depicted by Savedow based on the 777 correspondences of Crowley’s obverse attributions, we must note the significance of numerology. Savedow has struggled to rectify the base 7 system of the Arab Hells with the base 22 system of Crowley’s qliphotic attributes, and has created a diagram thus which is, while pleasing in its geometric symmetries, removed from and devoid of the original base 10 systemisation agreed upon by Levi, Waite and Crowley.The base 7 system presents seven obverse emanations, which 1 shall refer to simply as shells, connected by a series of 12 paths. Now, just as with the original Qabalistic Tree of Life diagram used by Luria, these paths admit no particular order upon which for a working to proceed by connecting the shells in sequence. Later Christian revisions (the Aril to the originally perfect (Cra) Tree of Life have been made in attempt to allow such a working process to unfold in a continuum between the sefirot emanations, however, aside from Crowley’s negative attribution base 10 system of Rulers, no such system is so much as implied by the Tree of Death diagram.Nonetheless, an order of the paths has been assigned, apparently arbitrarily, to underscore the importance of their numeration in conjunction with the seven shells, which, when these are added altogether with the 3 infernal Veils, yields the same 22 as Crowley’s attributes of the qliphotic Arab genii and the demons of 777.Whereas the path working of ha qabalistic Tree of Life can be easily disregarded and a more correct geometry assumed, the Tree of Death is based on a mirror reversal of the Christian interpretation, and therefore seems dependent on the concept of a working nunierological order for its paths, which is not supported by the geometric symmetry of the Tree of Heath diagram itself.Therefore, in order to affix attributions of one base 22 system, such as the Tarot Trumps, to that of the paths and shells inclusive on the Tree of Death diagram, one must resort to working with gematria. Crowley himself makes this clear as his next intended step, before having discarded the project, in liber Osiris Amoun, wherein he attributes letters as the cypher mechanism between two tyling boards, one (Osiris Amoun) meant to convey the correspondences of ha qabala, and the other of the genii of the qliphoth.Unfortunately, here we are no better off, since the Ari and Ora versions of the order of the Hebrew aleph bet differ not only from one another, but the reformed order of the same by ben Ihuda as well. While it suited Crowley, in his own time, to simply utilise the reformed order aleph-bet to establish the correspondences for ha qabala gathered in 777 and from thence work paths on the Tree of Life diagram, he left no further instructions regarding how this matter ought to be approached in dealing with the attributions of the same to path working the Tree of Death.Since the basis of the Tarot Trumps is their correspondence to the attributions of the letters, and not to the letters themselves, one can easily arrange these attributions on the non worked paths of the originally perfect geometrical symmetry of the Tree of Life diagram, however one hesitates to attempt to do the same regarding Savedow's Tree of Death diagram, lest these correspondences be made qualitatively rather than numerologically.aspect of the work which Crowley ultimately left unfinished also."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Hence, let us return lo Savcdow's diagram in itself, without, yet, any numerological order of the paths and shells. It seems that not even the diagram in itself is wholly satisfactory, Since we see that it is more indicative of a paternal Petro rite in its geometric symmetry than should it be flipped asunder to yield a more evocative ascension from the chalice to the ashlar. The reasoning behind my suggestion of this method would not lie in any pointless wish lo overturn the gravity of the diagram, but to underscore something one may see as a fundamental paradox of Genesis itself.In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve are given freely to eat of the Tree of Life, which grants them immortality. It is the Tree of Knowledge over Good and Evil that is the counterpart to the Tree of Life, and they are restricted from it lest they should be denied the fruits of the Tree of Life. Now, given a wealth of Gnostic doctrine on the subject in which man is supposedly created by the demiurge in order to worship this lesser God. as well as recent breakthroughs in biochemistry involving the mapping of genomes and especially the discovery of the telomeres thereof, it can possibly be called into question whether the attributes hitherto assigned to the Tree of Death were originally meant to be assigned to the Tree of Knowledge over Good and Evil rather than that of the mystery of Life.However, if we take this as a premise, it must become necessary to question whether the Tree of Life diagram still stands as such. To this end there is no short supply of information from various ancient and elder sources, predating the geometrically symmetric diagram itself, all of which state implicitly that ha qabala is a secret doctrine, meant to be passed along at most orally from one generation to the next. The word Qabala itself means \"tradition,” and from this we can infer that, in keeping with the Torah being both its source and its reference point, this tradition refers lo (he Law. Now, there are many further arguments that can be made on this point, such as can be referenced from all the works before mentioned in regards to the construction of the Tree of Life diagram, and yet. on the other hand, none which can speak on behalf of why the diagram was chosen to be called the Tree of Life, as opposed to the Tree of Knowledge over Good and Evil.So. we may choose to see now, there is at least room for speculation on the matter of the very nominal attributions of these diagrams themselves, and from thus it is possible to step one foot forward further towards a right and proper understanding of their individual and relative meanings.For example, let us consider the individual meaning of vertically inverting the diagram of the afore called Tree of Death. Here we see that the square is above, and the triangle below. I will return again to this symbolism in comparing the two. but first let us see these merely geometrical rhomboids as symbolic of something relevant to Life itself. From Laurence Gardner we learn much of the shemmana, the \"bread of life,” into which was baked the single atomic grains of superheated gold. Thus, if we so choose, we may make reference to a whole host of Sumerian, Egyptian, early Hebrew. Christian and Muslim mythopoeia regarding the service of this bread to the priest kings, pharaohs, high priests, blood royal, and holy prophets. Likewise, by seeing in the merely geometric rhomboid of the triangle a pictogram for the serving dish, or grail, in this Holy Sacrament, then we may see that it is not the blood which is pouring down from the chalice onto the ashlar as in a primitive voudou ritual, but the shemmana bread of life which is rising from the royal cup saucer."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"However, it should be worthy of further note, to speculate that the vertical inversion of the afore called Tree of Death, wherein the square is above and the triangle below, implies a further relationship between the two geometrically symmetrical diagrams. The base shape of the Tree of Death diagram, according to Savedow, is tetrahedronal. The base shape of the perfect and unaltered ha qabalistic Tree of Life is cubic. Thus, by putting the square above and the opened compass below. \\ve imply the superiority of the advocacy of .Justice to the merely existent life.Now, we can speculate further on these matters, that, given the tetrahedronal construction of the so called Tree of Death it is more representative of the double helix coil of deoxyribonucleic acid <I)NA) inside the nucleus of all cellular life forms. This can be argued due to Buckminster Fuller’s proposed tetrahedronal coiling pattern for DNA, in which a series of tetrahedrons are stacked edge to edge to map the approximate degree of rotation per unit cell before a full turn of 360 degrees. In this model it was revealed that 22 faces of tetrahedrons are exposed along the outside of a single coil thereof before a 360 degree rotation had occurred, at which point the pattern would repeat itself and begin again.Likewise the double cubic nature of the diagram hitherto known as the Tree of Life can be thought of as representing a similarly recursive pattern of an additional dimensional component. In other words, something similar to the DNA of a higher life form, of an order so superiorly advanced to our own that we have yet to encounter it in the reality defined by our merely three spatial dimensions, crowned by the fourth temporal dimension. Thus, this latticework of four-space might be thought of as a method of charting the internal working components of a higher order force, such as entropy is for time, and thus, to truly be Khab Allah, the “body” of “God.”This would further explain why there are ten sefirot in addition to 22 paths on the ha qabalistic diagram, but only 22 Inclusive on the qliphotic. However, the question remains about how one could rightly order a numerological system, such as the 22 Trumps of Tarot upon this similar base 22 system qliphotic diagram.Perhaps the best way of looking at this matter is, again, based on numerological symmetry of geometry. I have stated here that the doubly cubic geometric structure of the Tree of Life diagram is indicative of the inherent cellular pattern of a higher order idealisation, such as time. Elsewhere I state more thoroughly my conviction that it is. moreover, actually a hypercublc lattice measuring the shape of a fourth- spatial dimensional form, what I call, a “metaform.” If we see this as being the case, and if we understand that the double tetrahedron, when conjoined, forms the stelloctahedron, which is the root volume of the eight-cornered cube, then we may apply this fact to the fourth-spatial dimensional form as well. The result of this is that the double tetrahedronal Tree of Death diagram is, seen from one corner, the same fourth spatial shape as the Tree of Life diagram, seen from the edge. Just as the stelloctahedron is the cube root of the eight cornered three-spatial cube, the hyper- stelloctahedron is the fourth root of the sixteen corned fourth-spatial hypercube.Thus, it should come as no surprise that the Tree of Death possesses the same number of shells and paths inclusive as the number of paths on the Tree of Life, nor that it was this pattern which Savedow chose to reveal as the fundamental basis for the Structure upon which to represent the seven Arab Hells and Crowley’s qliphotic genii as being the shells and paths thereof."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Thus il seems a relatively easy matter to assign the Tarot Trumps, as a base 22 system, to the Tree of Death diagram, by either dropping the three spiritual alchemical elements altogether, of by combining them (two with one, and one with another) to certain of the planetary attributes, and thus fitting in the base 10 system to the base 7 system of the shells. However we should not. by any means, think of it as this simple. The shells of the Tree of Death are meant to be the opposite equivalents of the sefirot on the Tree of Life, and these were only associated with the planetary spheres themselves as recently as the early Twentieth Century by the Golden Dawn. This was. at that time, based on an attempt at syncretism between Greek and Hebrew systems. The Greek system had been, in turn, based on the Persian Oracles of Zoroaster, however the Hebrew system had been based on the Egyptian, and this is the original distinction between the base 7 and base 10 systems. Later, at the time of the Septamanian renaissance of ha qabala in sephardic Spain, when the Sefer Yctzirah was first written down and commented upon, the Hebrew admitted adoption of the base 7 system, as well, only to its alephbetic base 22 structure. By the time of the Golden Dawn however, the significance of doing this as a means of casting oracles of divinalory nature had largely come into disuse, and was neglected to the extent that the base 10 system and base 7 systems were forced to correspond out of implied necessity, which was, in reality, merely the convenience due sloth.Thus, if we are to look at the seven shells of the Tree of Death as being one or the other of either the base 7 system of planets, or the opposite correspondences to the sefirot on the Tree of Life, than we cannot admit to doing whichever other we do not, and must not admit to both. Thus, if we want to unify the base 10 system of the sefirot with the base 7, we must needs combine the three spiritual alchemical elements with the seven planets, true, though we cannot hope to do this as correspondent upon the base 7 system of shells on the Tree of Death.Another system presents itself, to which we would be wise turn to in addressing this problem. That is. of course, the compass and square, again, representing the triangle and circle of the ancient art of the magician’s craft. Just as there are said to be additional elements attached in a circle of art around the base 10 Tree of Life (Ayin, Ayin Soph, and Ayin Soph Лиг in specific), so we may attribute the additional three veils over the seven Hells and 12 genii of the Tree of Heath to a triangle of craft encompassing the entire diagrammatical array. The obvious attributes of Satan and Molech to the superior two points of this downward rhomboid should be acceptable.Now. we have the numerological system worked out quite nicely, however we still have not touched on the order of placement upon their respective groupings of the base 22 alephbetical correspondences attributed to the paths on the Tree of Life when translating these to the qliphotic Tree of Death. One, and in my opinion quite good enough, reason to hesitate in this regard is the complete lack of agreement between all prior schools on the right attribution of these correspondences lo the paths on the Tree of Life diagram in the first place. There are several attributions of this, including those given by the Ari and Gra in the Sefer Yetzirah. those of the Golden Dawn adopted by Crowley in his compiling of both 777 and the Tehuti Rota, as well as those imputed by Isaac Luria the blind in the basic Zohar. However, to assist us in this regard we may return to Crowley's alephbetically cyphered Book of Osiris Amoun and the QJiphoth. Here he gives us the opposite correspondences labeled quite clearly enough for those willing to look of the alephbetical attributions he has used for the paths on the Tree of Life diagram from 777. The placement then is a matter of juxtaposition, however, it is preferable to use the original geometry rather than the Crowleyian Naples Arrangement."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"As has already been mentioned, the original split between the base seven and base ten systems derived between (he Egyptian attributions, followed by the Hebrews, and (he Persian attributions, followed by (he Greeks. The Order of the Golden Dawn, much later, sought (o rectify this split, however, rather than by combining these two systems complete and already made, they attempted to superimpose them. To do (his. they made two grievous errors of attribution.The first was in assigning the Olympic dignitaries to the sefirot. The sefirot are emanations, while the Olympic dignitaries are rulers, in addition to the fact that the sefirot are base 1(1 and (he Olympic dignitaries, based on (he ancient known planets, rather than, as intended originally by the Persians, to greater spheres of influence over the fates. To correct one error, if not (he other, they clumsily added the later discovered planets. This was a patently false attribution on (he grounds that the Olympic dignitaries were a separate entity from the planets originally until they were attributed to them, for the sake of pure convenience, much later by late Arabic astrologers and early European astronomers in the Age of Reason. Therefore, based on the astronomical attribution for convenience of the planets to certain, rather than others, of (he Greek Olympic dignitaries, followed upon by the Greek naming of (he later discovered planets, the Golden Dawn forced the prior system of spheres of fatal influence onto (he otherwise attributed emanations, and thus placed rulers over attributes. The result of this was revolutionary for astrology, which has since regained great strides in its newfound “Aquarian” age, though is disastrous for disentangling the original emanations from the spheres of influence over the fates.The second was in the addition of an eleventh sefirot. This blindly blasphemed every jot and title of (he Sefer Yetzirah, compiled several hundred years before in scphardic Septamania, which slates implicitly that there were ten divine emanations, no more and no less. The eleventh “non\" sefirot attribution added by the Golden Dawn was based on the late Coptic, pre Christian Hellenic Hebrew conception of divine revelation. This concept, which followed from the school of thought given the name of its study, was known, in the original Aramaic, as Gnosis, however the Golden Dawn, in seeking to. at once, obfuscate their crime and signify a return toward a Hebrew origin which, relative to this concept, was utterly without basis, renamed Gnosis Daath. Thus, the Golden Dawn had accomplished, in one sweep, the desecration of the authentically Hebrew base 10 system of emanations, and the Greek system of divine revelation.Now, (heir reasons for doing this should be obvious. In combining the base 10 emanations in themselves with the base 22 paths connecting them on the Christian version of the Tree of Life diagram, they were only one short of having forced a unification with the base 33 vertebrate system of contemporary Free and Associated Speculative Masonry. Therefore, with absolutely no rights to such a claim, despite the fabricated charters provided by a necrophiliac was-oul of German Masonry, the Golden Dawn proudly expostulated itself as an authentically Masonic offspring Order.Where the Golden Dawn failed to see the combination of (he base 22 pa(hs on the Tree of Life diagram (Christian of original Hebraic) with the base 11 paths on the Tree of Death for obvious reasons, we. in retrospect, can correct their error and come to the same base 33 conclusion. This should be noted as the addition of the superfluous seflra and the assignment to the emanations of dignitaries are both mistakes which no self-respecting member of Speculative Masonry would (hemselves consciously commit, and therefore, in their correction, may be considered a minor tribute."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"However, since much of twentieth century magick has evolved predicated upon it, we cannot, unfortunately, so easily disregard the superfluous eleventh sefirot given by the Golden Dawn. Situated on the Middle Path immediately inferior to the crown, it marked an, albeit Christian rather than Hebraic, attempt to further separate the three supernals from the other seven lower emanations on the Tree of Life diagram. Thus, it became figuratively known as the Veil of the Abyss between the supernals and the subtended seven, and, while this was only used practically as an appendage to the initiatory structure of grades of the Order, it admitted the study of the original Hebrew attributes to the highest grades only after a lengthy trial period of overtly Christian tests among the lower grades. Thus, to the initiates and their subsequent students, the non sefirot of the Abyss became a significant stepping stone between the exoteric and esoteric systems of mystic Christianity and mystic Judaism. Its importance, thus, carried over into much of late twentieth century endeavors.In light of this, it might be best to think of the Blind Dragon arrangement as. for all intents, occurring within, rather than excluding, this non-sefirot. It may, again, if only for the sake of convenience due sloth, be considered as an important element in progressing from the lesser grades of the mystical order to the higher study of the supernal traits, in much the same way as, due to an unfortunate application of modern theory, the creation of a personalised Tarot deck is considered the necessary contribution to the Order of one attaining to the grade of Magus.However, in so doing, we must also underscore our referencing of this system as a path through the depths of the adverse attributes represented by the split of the Tree of Life between the superior and inferior realms divided by the Abyss. While this is, as has been demonstrated, in reality a Tree of the mysteries of Life rather than (he Tree of Knowledge over Good and Evil, i( has already been heartily engraved on the collective unconscious the fact of Original Sin. According to Original Sin, we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and that, to then, return from its Good Fruits to that of the Tree of the mysteries of Life, we will find only that the Fruits of Longevity have grown bitter, and that to eat of them is \"to surely die.”And so we see, despite everything, the ha qabalistic diagram, as well as its blasphemous Christian and Golden Dawn counterpart, is, indeed, the only Tree of Life given to us now to be known. To know it is to know, in the truly Buddhist sense, only suffering, for to work upon it until we are pained and draw our final breath has become our lot in life, having been cast out of the Garden of Eden. We now know only knowledge itself, and the tree of Life is barred from us by an angel with a flaming sword. Such is represented by Daath, and underscores the attributions on the Tree of Death, such that, when we find the latter in the former, it is bedecked already with adverse attributes and unsympathetic superstitions, to the extent that, to study it is to disobey the Word of God, and to unseat the assumed natural order of human existence,The conclusion of all of this is not to say that to Disobey God is to Die. There is a nascent optimism permitted by these results. In ancient Hebrew ha qabala. derived from the Egyptian, as well as in the Noble Path of Buddhism, the Greek rituals of Eleusis. the Aztec ceremonies, Sufi Islam, etc. the highest aspiration of the adept is toward the nullification of the individual ego. and its transcendence to and ultimate unity with the enthroned Godhead. This system admits the same, though darkly. For in this system, it is not the death of the self which is a doorway lo the perception of the deity, but the reversal of such fortune. When we look deep into an abyss, the abyss looks deep into us. But this rule must work as upon both ways."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Let us, briefly, turn our attention toward the Khab-Allah once more, the Body of God. Now. for each religion this means something different. To the Hindu there are many Gods governing all the forces of Nature. To the Buddhist, there is no God as such, only various conditions or states of consciousness, as well as emissaries of enlightenment.To the Hebrew there is only one ineffable God, as well as a coming Messiah. To the Christian there is a triune God. inclusive of the ineffable Holy Spirit as well as the progenitor and person of the Messiah. To the Moslem there is yet the ineffable God. though no Messiah, and only a series of Prophets leading up lo Mohammed, the final. Throughout these progressive states of the religious experience, we see a persistent anthropomorphication of the deity. First it is naturalised, then made self aware and consciously sentient. Following this it is given a body, and then even this body condemned to death and resurrection. Finally, we see that it is not even the One deity itself that is manifest in these bodies, but merely its messengers, and even they are a line which has died out. The purpose of all this is, of course, not to glorify the self, because such would be mysticism rather than religion. The purpose, it would seem, is to bring the deity under ihe control of the human. To pull the Most High down, and lo make him a mortal.Thus, God is not dying by proxy in perpetuity. God itself is a Dead Concept. It has been brought down from the empyrean heights and slaughtered wholesale, its parts dispersed amongst the profane until ultimately dissipating altogether. At every step throughout the history of religion we see those people claiming to exalt the divine aspects becoming more and more ensconced in their adversity. They are merely mortal, the religions plead apology, and as such, are imperfect. So, too, we see the same modus operendi applied to ihe religious institutions themselves, that the gestures of expression of its parts are indicative of the decay of the whole, and that the House of (iod is infested with sins of all sorts, and that its proponents are no more nor less so now than they ever were, mere demons in disguise.To come before God and to lose the self now. is to be obliterated in a grave abyss. The empty tomb of a nonexistent emperor. To come before God and to lose the self is to die in the Buddhist transcendental sense, but the ascend is as Icarus, and will always culminate in a return to the senses. Thus, the Tree of Death is no different at all from the Tree of l ife. The supernals on the Tree of Life prepare one for the assumption of a state of consciousness which dissolves the ego into the Holy Light of God. Before this may be accomplished, it has been covenanted again and again, one must needs pass through the Veil of Death. The ego of God has become one with the body of man. for it was in His image we were formed. So. too. to return to His divine state of being without form, of ineffable pure consciousness, God must pass through this mortal shell of our bodily being and become dissolute through the demise of its flesh, free from ihe confines of ils vessel. This is the essence of all mysticism, the esoteric and concealed visage behind the exoteric veil of all religious institutions.Allow but one closing example. Explain to the Hebrew that it was the Christian concept of God that was responsible for the Words of the Torah. Then explain to the Christian that it was really the Moslem concept of a prophet that was crucified to atone for the sins of humanity. Then explain to the Moslem that it was really the New Age concept of the God-self that makes each of us a prophet in our own right. Then you will come to understand the necessity of the death of the body as a methodological mechanism for the escape from earlhly suffering. As author William Burroughs put it. “when we become death, death is the seed from which we grow.Death needs time for what it kills to grow in. Death needs time to grow in.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Now (hat we have dealt with death as a seeming necessary evil of coming to God, we should further consider the necessity of Evil in the first place. To this end. let us delve briefly into the character of God’s arch-nemesis. Satan. The devil is. in the original literature, a tragic, sympathetic figure. He first appears In the writings of the Torah as an adversary, or prosecutor, of mankind in general. It can be assumed, due to latter-day research on the subject, that absolutely none of the Hebrew Torah was written before the Babylonian captivity. Thus we see that the orally transmitted stories, when brought into the context of a condition of enslavement, began to take on their first inklings of both supernatural forces and an undercurrent thereof tending towards temptation to behave in discord to them. It was from this that we find all the currently common arguments of contradiction internal lo the Old Testament, such as the idea of there being a multitude of Gods before Abraham chose YHVII as his elohim. The fate of these other Gods was. throughout the several hundred years of the Hebrew captivity in Babylon, increasingly portrayed as in conflict with the will of the Creator God. until, eventually, the Host of Angels which \"bred with the wives of men,” became considered Fallen Angels. Chief among these was Shemiaza, whose name was, eventually, corrupted to be synonymous with the word for accuser. It was, thus, one of God's own henchman who so vexed Job. In ritual, however, these other Gods died out harder than in myth. We see several references to human and animal blood sacrifices being made in the post-Babylonian captivity histories, however, of course, the retrospective commentary on these histories by prophets always tended toward blaming any such obvious errors in dogma on the interference of adversity, and so the first mention of Satan as a proper name is made in a posteriori reference to David's calling for a census of his nation of Israel. As the need for a unifying religion for the once-enslaved nation had grown stronger throughout their travails and turmoils, so had the need to vilify the natural force of opposition. This was the birth of Satan.Satan is but one fine example of the politics of religion. Suffice to say that the Tree of Death is replete with all of the other elder Gods, so unfortunate as to have fallen victim to the scythe of the contemporarily dominant religious paradigm. As one may by now expect, each of these has its original non-Hebraic mythologies deifying it. and its concordant Judco-Christian mythologies demonising it. Moreover it might be mentioned that none of these deities, in their original forms, were at all negatively attributed, and that their millennia of disgrace at the hands of biased authors and researchers, in lieu of the only recently unearthed source material, should not be held as viable contrapositive evidence of their actual characteristics. For example. Lilith, originally the handmaiden of Inanna. the Sumerian pre-deluvlal Goddess and first wife of the deluvial Adapa (the biblical Adam), has become so inextricably defiled by the intervening commentary of the Midrash that she immediately conjures up in the minds of even the most scholarly researchers on the material at Nineveh only ideas of miscarriage and whoredom. So, we may see now, if we so choose, there is little reason to replicate the errors of chthonic attributions to these True Gods except to pay undue homage to their foul, politically motivated bastardisation.Now. all of this having been brought forth, it should also be explained that this does not mean to apologise for the concept of evil nor its personification in this world. There are clearly some people who have been by (heir enemies identified, whether for right or wrong reasons cannot really be said with any certainty in this season of history, as the incarnations of sin. evil, as well as any and all adverse attributes associated therewith."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"For example, Nostradamus warned future- generations of the coming of three potentates, whose deeds were to be so heinous that they could only be described by the prophet as veiled in the symbolism passed on to him by previous prophets used to describe the pinnacle apex of adversity. The first, who would come to rule in France, has since been ascertained to have been Napoleon by commentators on the quatrains. The second, Histor, is thought to have been Adolph Hitler of Germany’s NAZI Third Reich, although some believe it is too soon to ascertain this with any degree of certainty, despite the egregious war crimes committed by Der Fhurher’s regime. The third. Mabus, is said to be the reincarnation of Ghenghis Khan, the worst of the three, and to come wearing a blue turban. There are only two commonalities between these three figures of Nostradamus’ future histories. One is that he referred to them all as Anti4'.hrists, a term which was adopted for the convenience of his contemporaries’ understanding of the severity of these three men. The other was that they were all expected to, or have since been interpreted to have, occupy the realm of politics. The idea of a political tyrant has even earlier precedence in the conceptualisation of the personification of adversity.In the Revelation to St. John of Patmos. the concept of an anti-Christ was first raised to juxtapose the new idea of the crucified and risen Messiah. Jesus the Christos. In this there is a terrible dragon which rises from the depths of the sea, and a false- prophet known as the Beast who proclaims its divinity. In the now infamous passage, \"here is wisdom, let he who has understanding head, for the number of the beast is the number of a man, and his number is 666,” the devil first came to be personified. This number, using gematria (a method of ha qabala to which I shall return later), is equal in Greek to the phrase To Mega Therion, meaning The Great Beast, and, in Hebrew, to Nrun Qsr. or Nero Caesar. Again, the whole of the Johnine Apocalypse appears to be a vindictive edict aimed at the existing Roman occupational government of Judea. Before this time, it was not standard Hebrew practise to attack the personalities of their captors, but instead to vilify their Gods. However, much evidence from Qumran has been unearthed that pesher, a form of ha qabala based on interpreting ancient scriptures as prophecies of contemporary events, was, by that time, already a common practise.Before this time the battle between Good and Evil was considered a spiritual affair.The Godb of the conquering tribe were, at first, vilified and. eventually, begrudgingly adopted by the conquered tribe. Also, sometimes Gods were the token of a cultural exchange to strengthen alliances between trade-partner nation-states.While all of this seems mostly politically motivated, the practitioners of all different forms of religion were, at least then, considered equal in status and rights with one another. Thus, the politicians and priests alike were merely pawns to the Gods, although, from the perspective of the modern mindset, we may now also say that the Gods were merely pawns of the politicians and priests. Thus, the struggle between good and evil was seen by classical societies as something inherent to each individual and to all mankind, and not something for which one man should fault another.There is however one common adversary' known uniquely to our species. As far back as is reached by recorded history, and still further on into the remnants of the fossil record, there is ample evidence of the preoccupation of humanity with mortality. If there can be said to have been a first political anti Christ, or a first deified Devil, then surely we can add to this litany the primary evil of Death itself. The superstition of burial or cremation of corpses is a preoccupation known only to our ancestors."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"All the most ancient forms of religion arose initially to account for the necessity of death and to offer the bereaved an organisation for coping with their grief. Of course, as these religions became more and more institutionalised with the development of the urban polis, their explanations for the necessity of death became more and more obtuse and prolapsed, to the extent that, eventually, it became Ihe common practise for the one religion to build upon the mythology of its predecessors while attempting to add new hierarchical structures of authority. Through this mechanism, basic aboriginal shamanism progressed to early moral codifications, and from this to elaborate illustrations and descriptions of the afterlife, which led. ultimately, to the differentiating of the pleasant from the torturous forms thereof being coupled with the Covenant that only the obedient to the codified edicts would benefit thus, while those scofflaws would suffer eternally. Of course, to the modern mind, the entire proposition is absurd.However a more careful inspection of this glacial mechanism will reveal that the trend continues on to this very day. The manner of religion’s progress is not unlike that of a great storm front, where the cool air flowing downwards brings with it the precipitation, while behind this the warm air rising upwards fuels the condensation from evaporation. In this model we can see that the institution of religion circulates its doctrines in much the same way as the storm circulates temperate air. While pouring down its dominant dogma along its exterior visages, it quietly accumulates a moving storehouse of old fables, folklore and myths from its occult underside. It can thus be said that, when one form of religion has ceased being actively dominant and become more or less occluded within itself, (hat its particular reign is past.So. when Hinduism spawned the Thugees and the Thongs of India and Japan, the cultural center of the religious movement was migrated north through China, forcing the primitive petro Thugees to contend with and ultimately become absorbed into the rigorous orders of the Samurai warriors, while the Thong cults dissipated amidst the studies of martial arts into various monasteries of ninjas. Likewise, when Judaism began resorting to political activism against its contemporary oppressors the Romans, its doctrines were then peddled to (he regional goyim who quickly utilised them to subvert the hethen empire into modern Christianity. When Christianity had sufficiently fused with Judaism to contaminate both belief systems forming a synthetic hybrid, it became known as Islam, which, at least in part, began as an opposition to this very process of syncretic blending. Now. all these religions have become so awash of one another that the only remainder of non-institutionally organised religion is a sort of spiritualist New Age. in which all religions are blurred together indistinguishably, and (heir moral boundaries lost to a sea of gray. In this way all the ancient religions have been bled into the newer, like Hindu to Buddhism, and even now, as I write these words, the elder religions are becoming increasingly occult and adverse, such as Judaic ha qabala. It seems that, since (he retroactive Rosicrucian subculture spawned the countercultural cult of the Golden Dawn, even the Christian religion is declining into the early hours of its evening age.In all of this we may see. if we so choose, the cycle of the acculturation and institutionalisation of that original evil beginning to wear out its welcome. In recent times (he majority of occult vitriol has been spit in the direction of its own exoteric counterpart, the organised religions. Peshcr of past prophecies has been modified and now. rather than (he ancient Gods, or the elder politics, it is the present priests who are becoming seen as the anthropomorphic subjects of these shamanic trance visions of the adverse. While the cycle of politics is short, that of the passage of religions is long, and while empires rise and fall, the edified Church only erodes over the aeons. However, under the microscope of magick, its half-life is shortened."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The House of God. once the concept of God has been permanently disproved, is but an empty- coffin. This was perceived originally by the Buddhists, who are deistic atheists. The Jews have come to accept it. though conditionally, by awaiting a nonexistent spiritual king. Christians yet idealise it, and cluster about the Holy of Holies like larval insects gorging on a corpulcsccnt crapulence. Eventually the decay of the empty Ark will, just as the current infraction of the Covenant with Jacob, and the inevitable redaction of that even older with Noah, be complete, and the maggots, cursed for a cure, will turn like cannibal lepers upon one another.It is not the antithesis of religion that is represented by the Tree of Death and its associated attributes. It is the antithesis of religion’s occult spirituality. For only in the dens and warrens of the rabid Rhon, qabalist, Rosicrucian and Sufi mystics does the persistence of belief in some form of transcendent reality yet endure. The antechamber of the Temple is filled now only with the diseased and the already dead. And this, we set, is what is here depicted. For, with the passing of the torch of all religion inclusive to the New Age populist occult, we can at long, long last bear time and unwavering witness to the fall and death of the cult of Death. It is the rotten core at the very essence of religiosity itself which is represented by the Tree of I>eath and its associated attributes.Now that we see that the modern mindset of humanist atheism is at the root of the Tree of Heath, we may begin to apply it as a working key to unlocking the mysteries of some of the occult’s accumulated religious mythologies. Because Ihe diagram itself is, in turn, based upon an authentically Hebrew depiction of attributes culled from the Torah, then it would be bc-st. perhaps, at least easiest, to begin with the Hebraic ha qabalistic mythologies as a base for such operations. Many of these mythological relevances account for minor alterations made in the current model from its various prior basic incarnations according to. as afore said. Crowley, Grant and Savedow.11. the KellipolBefore digging in we should lay a bit of cosmological groundwork.In the tongue of the early Phoenicians, off from whom the Greek. Old Hebrew and early Aramaic (which would go onto become modern Hebrew) languages split, the word for vessel or container was the same as the word for sea shell. Through early Aramaic this word came to be known in modern Hebrew as the word Qliphoth (qoph- lamed-peh-tau), or, in elder Greek, Kellipot (kappa-epsilon-lambda-iota-pi-omega- tau). We cannot look at ha qliphoth except as it relates to ha qabala. The root Semitic word qabala (qoph bet lamed heh) has various meanings, according to various authors, such as “tradition,\" \"from mouth to ear” or “to receive.\" While we are told the qabala is “a blessing.” we are told the qliphoth are “a curse.” So. let us investigate this seeming paradox further.We can begin simply enough by turning to the primary source material for such investigations used by qabalists throughout all the intervening thousands of years since its writing, that is, the Torah. For the sake of some minor comparison we shall also be considering the Gospels. However, as you may already be aware, we will be looking at theses sources in their original languages, and utilising Gematria."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"According to the literary ha qabala there are three levels of interpreting the letter of the law. 1 > Gematria (from the Greek): where the alphabet is substituted with a scries of numbers, and where words and sentences are seen as the sum of these numbers. 2) Notariqon (from the Latin): where initial, medial or final letters in words are anagrammed for other words. 3) The mum h (from the Hebrew): where one letter is seen to be substituted for another. These second two require great skill in ha qabala, and thus shall not be utilised, in favour of the simpler and more easily transmitted form of Greek and Hebrew gematria.Let us begin this exercise by turning our attention to the parable of the sower from the Gospel of Matthew chapter 13, verses 3-9. In the parable of the sower we can see quite clearly from the Master's explanation (Matt. 13: 18-30) that he is speaking of the revealed tradition. However, if we compare the original Aramaic version (via the Greek) to the later King James translation from the Latin Vulgate, we can see that a word has been added to the text in the latter version to make the message of the text more clear to the reader. This word is “seed.” So. let us look at this word, and explore the ramifications of why it was excluded from the original text.The Greek for “seed” is SPERMA, and the sum of its constituent gematria is 426. Now, we may take this sum and draw allusions between it and other words whose letter- numbers add up lo the same sum in order to draw conclusions about the implied nature of the word in this current context. The first such correspondence we can make is between the 426 of Greek SPERMA and the 426 of the Hebrew “fundamental laws” (cf. Matt. 22:34-40) as well as the repeated accusations of the Master that he was the son of God. and the claims of the Master that he was the coming of the New Law. On the other hand, the Greek word for “offense” is also of the sum 426. This could refer to the Master’s repeated confrontations with the Temple priests of his time.Confer, also, Matthew chapter 7, verse 16, and we shall now introduce also the concept of the \"fruit\" of the \"seed.” Now, \"fruit” is a peculiar word possessing the same letter number sum in both Hebrew and Greek, and we see that it is used regularly throughout the Torah and the Gospels to express a panoply of ideas. In Greek, the word is KARPOV and in Hebrew OVShll PVY. and both these words sum 671. Some other Hebrew words of note whose gematria sum is the same are “law\" and \"gate,” again underscoring that the \"fruit” of a person’s deeds is the \"gate” to their true character, and that those of the Master’s deeds are. again, the new \"law.”In the closing remarks of the parable, the Master himself dallies in number sums, and these too can be used to quarry words with which to elaborate upon the central premises. The Master's chosen sums are: “an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.” These can be taken as gematria sums and. analysed appropriately, they yield words whose letters add to thirty, sixty, one hundred, or a combination thereof.As to thirty we find in the Hebrew, \"a party to an action at law” (such as defendant or plaintiff); “Judah;” and \"it will be.” In Greek we find the name of the number \"ten.\"As to sixty we find in the Hebrew, “tried by fire,” or, “a watch tower;” a legal “constitution;” “the southern district;” “glory, excellence, pride;” and “to behold,” or, “vision.” In the Greek we find “fear, terror;\" “magic;” and a “brand\" or “stigma.\" As to the one hundred, we find in the Hebrew, “an effort.” or. “exertion;” “mitigation of the one by the other;” “vases.” or. “vessels;” “the palm:” and “a day.” “the seas” or \"the times.” In the Greek we find “feast at the dedication of a temple;” a “stalk of corn;” and “lust.” If we collect all theses sums into one. to express the combination of all these attributes together, then we find the gematria for 190 yields, in Hebrew, \"to avenge;” “hidden,” or, “concealed;” and \"lo stone to death.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Hopefully this brief exercise has given the reader some insight into the mechanisms at work behind the outer permutations of correspondent attributes in the ha qabalistic system. The same points could be made using any other example. So, what then, if any, is the difference between the ha qabalistic and ha qliphotic systems/ It is so subtle that, even by using apparently obtuse methodologies such as are presented in literary qabala, we can only begin to scratch the surface. However, it is a very real distinction, though nonetheless nearly impossible lo define.Consider the matter further. Take the gematria of the Greek for “thorn.” another word from the same verse extrapolated upon above. It’s numerical sum is 1090. The closest approximation to this in Hebrew is “the Rose of Sharon” at 1091. The difference between them is one, equivalent to Greek Alpha or Hebrew Aleph. Now, compare the “thorn” to the “seed\" as indicated in the passage of scripture. Subtract the “seed” from the “thorn” as the seed cast into thorn withers and dies. The result is 664. Thus, since there is no fruit possible to arise from the deadened seed, subtract this difference from the “fruit:” 671 - 664 - 7. or the gematria of “fish.” the signature of the Master, as well as the number of his wounds. Add to the fish, “manna” and Eat.But we can still bend and twist the matter further. Break the thorn into five pieces, and halve the seed. Now their difference is the same as the number of pieces of the thorn. Now, the halved seed appears again “unbroken” though “unfruitful,” while the thorn has become an abbreviation for the name of the Master. Now, if we lake our shards of five shards of thorn and add them to our halved seed, we see that they are a “sibling.\" but when we subtract this sibling from the fruit we see that they are only relative “of the dead.” And only now can we see at last that the difference between the fruit and the Beast of the Apocalypse is the same as the difference between the seedless fruit and the dead. By Neoplatonic isopsephy (adding up the pure digits of the gematria sums), we see that, while the number of <1BI.II is ten, as it was in the beginning, so then is, to put an end on it, the number of the Qliphoth five.However, all of this could be more easily illustrated thus:“To Receive less by the Body of God is the 42 fold Name. The Justice is the difference between the otherwise twin Lords. When the Body is stolen from The Just Lord there is Terror. When The Just Lord does not Receive it is the same as when Terror is lessened. The Seed is the Great Work diminished by The QJiphoth. When the Just Lord is separated from the Seed, he becomes Proud, and a Father. He Will Go to Limit The Shells, and to Bind a Shell To Me, The Great Beast. The Exalted bather is the Thorn. When the Seed is reduced by The World, To Dare lest Violate the Hollowed Vein. When the Great Beast is not enthroned within The Shell, Sorrow Drops Blood into a Pool, forming a Pond on Sand, until To Perish from the loss of Blood The Innocent.”Of course, all of this could be said more easily as:(137-95 = 42)(69= 151 - 82)(151 -95-56)(151 - 137)-(56 42)(155 - 777 - 622)(155-151-4)(35+ 631)-(40+ 626)(10 + 4- 14)(155- 151 =4)(666 - 622 = 44) 182-44 = 38)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Now, we have begun to arrive at the QJiphoth, from the lighted realm of meaning to the utter desperation of the futility of groping in blindness. The Guattama remarked many thousands of years before the Master on the subtle degree of difference between Good and Evil. Let us pause and consider his wizened council.A Good Man Sees What is Unwholesome Before His Good Deeds Reach Fruition.However, When the Good Ripens He Will Have a Bountiful Harvest of Good Results.As a pot Slowly Fills Up with Water, Drop by Drop.So Does the Fool, Little by Little,Become Full of EvilHere is all the difference there will ever be between the Tree of Life and the Shells.In the consideration of the Guattama there is good and evil to be seen in both. and. in truth, both are considered to be counted amongst the work of the True Qabalist. However, for the qabalist, for every ten works for the benefit of the tradition, there is. perhaps, only one or two which benefit its shadowed side. There is, thus, no balance to be found between the two, and this is one of the characteristic traits of ha qliphoth which distinguishes it from ha qabala.Moses De Leon, a qabalist of the Sephardic Castilian school, referred to the adverse attributes as demons who were “powers” of the “left side” emanation. But this is not meant to be understood as the left column of the Tree of Life diagram, for such had not even yet been formulated. On the Tree of Life diagram the crown of Boaz is Binah, the female water of Understanding. Rather, this doctrine refers to the seven lower emanations which radiate from Binah, and of these the beginning is the sefirot of Din, Judgment. Din, in the first century Bahir, is referred to as “the left hand of the Holy One,\" and a \"quality whose name is Evil.\"So it is written in the Qabala Unveiled, “and here the idea or universal form of all the shells is understood, which encompasseth the seven inferior emanations of the queen after the manner of a serpent, as well from the right as from the left, and from every side.”This refers us lo the Zoharic school of Isaac l.uria, the blind, from which we learn of the contraction of the world of Chaos which \"broke the shells\" containing the seven lower sefirot. In this particular contraction, which occurred in the world of the Idea of the creation, associated with air, the cosmogenic Ray emanating from the Ayin Soph, or the point of connection with the creator, was separated from the Creator, causing a “circular” expansion of the emanations, as well as a “running and returning” of the ray ordering them. The result of this was the subsequent contraction of the world of Formation, wherein the shards of the shells collapsed down to form the lesser world of Creation. It is added that the sefirot of the Kingdom, occupying the World of Creation, was only cracked, but not shattered, and the light which radiates from inside of it causes the desire to return lo the Godhead. Thus, it is said (Ps. 49:15) “God will redeem my soul, for he shall receive me” because IPs. 31:12) “I am like a broken vessel.” Likewise it is said (Prov. 10:8) “wise in heart shall receive commandments.” However, it is also said (Jer. 19:11) “will I break this people as one breaketh a potter’s vessel?”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The contraction between Idea and Formation, which separated the created from the Creator, occurred between Din, the Judgment, and Binah, the Understanding. In the Book of Creation, Understanding, the supernal of the feminine water, symbolised by the Mother letter mem, is considered the Elixer Vitae, while the contraction beneath this separated the World of Formation, considered the “lesser water.\" So it is written (Ps. 124:13} “thou hast broken the heads of the dragons upon the waters.” and this idea refers to the contraction rather than to the primordial “deep” preceding Creation (Gen 1:1). Because this contraction separated the three supernal elements from the lesser worlds, it is said that, like the qliphoth. the adverse attributes to them are formed of Fire and Air, and dwell in the distance between the earth and the moon. Therefore, the “dragons upon the waters\" refer to the Qliphoth themselves, which, when they “broke” caused the geometrical symmetry of the Tree of Life diagram to slip down into its current Christian version.Now. this contraction between the “queen” and the Judgment occurs in what has since come to be known among the Christian qabalists as the Veil of the Abyss, and this, we see, is the realm of the non-seflrot Daath, or Knowledge. This sefirot. rightly attributed lo the Gnosis of the queen Sophia, that is, Ihe female aspect of wisdom, reveals lo us that Knowledge is the fruit on the tree of Knowledge over Good and Evil. However, in its adverse attribute, as Daath, which has no place on ihe symmetric geometry of the original Hebrew Tree of Life diagram, it is affiliated with the Tree of Death and the adverse qliphotic attributes, for to eat of the Tree of Life after having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge is to “surely die” (Gen. 2:17). The act of Creation is a contraction downward and inward by the Creator, while the diminished emanation of the Lowest Sefirah, which is said to abut the adverse world of the manifest shards of the shells, causes the desire in men to return to the Godhead, and thus ascend ihe sefirot. Thus, in the Hebrew conception, Daath is associated only with adverse attributes, while in the Christian concept. Gnosis is necessary lo return to the maternal Sophia. In one sense, the seven lower emanations may be thought of as synonymous with the Hindu concept of the seven chakras, while the “serpent that runs and returns” may be thought of as the Kundalini. In ha qabala. however, only the Messiah can return His Fallen Bride to the Creator.The dragons, though referring to the shells of the sefirot between the Judgment and the Kingdom, are only two in number, for there are only the shards of the shattered shells, which are subtended as ihe adverse attributes of ihe Tree of Death inferior to Malkuth. and the Qliphah of Malkulh. which is, itself, the fallen Shckinah. These dragons are the same as the types of emanation which preceded their fall, t hal is, of air and of fire. Here we see the meaning of fire is to emanate outward “circularly” and that that of air is to propagate “linearly.” The linear aspect of the qliphoth. which are the shards connecting the seven slipped sefirot. is the serpent that “runs and returns.” Of the circular aspect of the qliphoth. which is the remaining cracked container of the kingdom that calls upon man to ascend the sefirot to return to the Godhead, it is written in Qabala Unveiled thal “his tail is in his head (that is, he holdcth his tail in his mouth, in order lhat he may form a circle).” This coiled serpent is referred lo in the Book of Creation as the Teli, and associated with the constellation of Draco. Thus it is said (Isa. 27:1). “And on that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword will punish the Slant Serpent and the Torturous Serpent.” Here, the slant serpent refers to the shards of the shells, and the Torturous Serpent to the (2Jiphah (harlot) Shekinah. Thus, the Slant Serpent is associated with the Gnostic Samael, who governs over the ascent of the “running and returning,” and the Teli lo Lilith, the Sumerian Goddess of Midwives. Together, these attributes are known as “the Blind Dragon.”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"There is one final step in completing our research into the matter of geometrically symmetrical number base diagrams. That is, which should be obvious to a true adept by this point, to combine the diagrams of the Tree of Life (In truth, the Tree of Knowledge) and the Tree of Death (in turn, life). The result of this combined lattice has two sets of attributions: 1) Jacob’s Ladder — an eastern set comprised of the chakras and the double hexagrams, which I shall not belabour the researcher of this subject to go into here, and 2) the Blind Dragon arrangement — a correspondence of wholly adverse attributes, which 1 will discuss in detail.The system combines inclusively: 1) the Ten Arch Demons or Demon Kings, the rulers over the adverse to the sefirot; 2) the Ten Orders of Demons, the Unholy Trinity, and the Five Accursed Nations: 3) the Three Veils and Seven Hells: 4) Crowley’s 22 Qliphoth Sui Generis: and 5} the affirmative declarations of the Ten negative Commandments, representing the seven Venal and ten Mortal sins against the Almighty.The correspondences illustrated by the Blind Dragon arrangement present a most logical order overall, wherein we see that each Ruler is attributed their own right crime against the Almighty, and placed directly superior to their domain of influence. Likewise, we see their orders of infernal messengers communicating between these realms, and the qliphoth being attributed to the genii which raise and support them. We see also the five accursed Tribes of Israel as attributes upon a right proper lamen, and so. above, we see also the Unholy Trinity and their Veils arranged upon a seal of summoning. All of this becomes immediately apparent to the rightly trained aspirant due to the implicit nature of the order of this arrangement.All that need be addressed further are the few special modifications 1 have made to this arrangement myself. As mentioned before. My own “hybrid” or “Black” arrangement was used for the Tree of Life’s correspondent attributions according to the alephbet in favor of Crowley’s own. due to the Christian nature of Crowley’s Tree of Life diagram basis therefore. This Hybrid arrangement is based on the more symmetrical, original Hebrew arrangement for this diagram, which is, in turn, more illustrative of the hypcrspatial nature fundamental structure. The attributes were placed thereon not according to any prior system such as the 32 luminations, or consciousnesses, of the Sefer Yetzirah, the Ari or Gra thereof, nor the Golden Dawn paths (which are, of course, based on the later, Christian version of the diagram), and finally neither upon Crowley’s Atu of Tehuti. which altered little from the Golden Dawn’s attributions. Rather, the placement of the correspondences was arrived at by a system similar to that originally used by the creator of the Tree of Life’s correspondences, Isaac Luria, who favored a mathematical system based, in turn, on the Carthaginian gematria of Pythagoras. In this initial arrangement, all the vertical pillars were assigned to the doubles (or finals), the horizontal rows to the mothers, and the diagonal aspects to the remaining glottals (or gutturals). To this, then, the cypher of adversities given by Crowley in Osiris Amoun was applied.As to other changes, only a few of note were made in compiling the Blind Dragon. For example, the position of Lucifuge Roffacale and that of Belphegor as Demonic Kings on Crowley's base 10 arrangement thereof were reversed, in favour of Lucifuge being replaced by the nomen of Lucifer, occupying adverse Tifereth, and ruling over the Concealers, for reasons which should be obvious.

This may have been the location of the literary Eden of Hebrew lore, known from Assyrian tablets as E.Din or Ehdin.However, the first wave of civilisation came to the fertile crescent several millennia later, when the Kurgan tribes people migrated through from the Siberian steppes. These pale skinned people had been depicted as the blue race of Aryans after having left the Indus river valley, and brought with them on their migration route through the middle east the high technology of the wheel as well as codified set of laws. They established walled cities outside of which agriculture was prompted to cultivate the rich soil of the Tigris, Euphrates and Nile river basins, and inside of which monumental building projects were commenced, initiated the ziggurats of Sumeria and the first pyramids of the Old Kingdom in Egypt. They also had their own set of phonetic ideograms, which were a far more advanced form then the mere pictographs used by the resident herders.Then, as quickly as they had come, these Aryan Annunaki Kurgans vanished. The Sumerian tablets clearly indicate that there was a war between the people of the western territories in Egypt and those of the northern Akkadian empire of Iraq with the southern Iraqi Sumerians, however the Egyptian records of this event, if they ever existed, seem to have been lost. The legend is largely preserved through the later Babylonian empire of unified Sumero Akkad. There are other records, however, preserved throughout the lands of Egypt, amongst the Hebrews, the early Babylonians, and as far east as India. China and Japan, which explain the sudden loss of the power hierarchy due to another event: a catastrophic flood.Ample evidence of this cataclysm, whether it be attributed to a “war in the heavens” as in the old Sumerian records, or to a flood as is the general consensus of the surrounding areas, exists in the geological record, where we find naturally formed teklites of glass smelted from sand across the delta of the Nile as far west as the Sahara, as well as evidence of a sudden deposit of silt ten feet thick in Iraq reaching as far north as to the peat bogs of Great Britain. Whatever happened, it seems that something wiped the past slate clean, and left the urbanised primitives to begin again, without the guidance of their mysterious benefactors.Some of the nation-states maintained the sacred bloodlines of these Kurgans’ intermarriage with the native peoples, and these bloodlines ruled more or less despotically even amongst the nomadic tribes such as the Hebrews, teaching that one day their now disembodied past idols would rise up and return. However it would not be long until Greek republicanism spawned the first non-bloodline empire, which was responsible for the most severe repression of the royal bloodlines to have ever occurred before or since.Subsuming the priestcraft of the various nations, such as the Hasmonean heresy of the first Maccabcan uprising in Judea as but one minor example, the Roman empire has established itself as the elite ruling power of the ever more unified planet.1. the Ten Arch-Demons or Demon Kings, the rulers adverse to the sefirot"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"a.

One of the victims of this circumstance was the equivalent of the Sumerian Ninlil.

The result of this was a conflict (described earlier) culminating In the Ilyksos expulsion from Egypt. The female traits, which would eventually be integrated into ha qabala as the Veils above the Tree of Life, were misunderstood by the Hebrew priest craft, which had adopted northern Egyptian monotheistic cosmology under Akhenaten, who had replaced the creator Cod Atum with the sun-disk Atcn.

Moloch SatanThe “King Adversary” is a combination of two titles, little more than characterising its possessor, failing a nominal identification. The result of this is that, at some time or another, all the preceding demonic rulers were associated with, synonymous to. or held the title of. King Satan. However, as has been demonstrated, all of these figures were, originally, benign characters in the pantheons of conquered nations or. at worst, vilified people of early history. Thus, it would be overbearing of the student in this matter to conclude with it. having not addressed the real intent behind their defilement.The term Moloch derives from Melek, an ancient titulary term synonymous, for all intents and purposes, with the modern notion of a King. We have already covered the fact that the term Satan was, in itself, never malevolent. Meaning “adversary” it carried little more weight in itself than does the modern concept of a prosecuting attorney (an agent, it should not be overlooked, representing the State). In the oldest books of the Torah, a Satan appears as an adversary representing God. sent to test the purity of his followers’ faith. In later appended works dating from the Babylonian captivity, the Satan begins to take on a character of its own, in opposition not lo God’s followers, but to the doctrines of God, which, by the beginning of the ( hrislian era, places him as an adversary against God Himself.

There is another explanation for Azza's expulsion from heaven: It is that he objected to the high rank given Enoch when the latter was transformed from a mortal into the angel Metalron. In Solomonic lore the story is that Azza was the angel who revealed lo the Jewish king the heavenly arcana, thus making Solomon the wisest man on earth.

God is like (he firmament, and the light is like the waters, for there was the light before, and the light after, and these were the two kinds of light, the one greater, and the other lesser. So. what is the Greater Light like, and what is the lesser light like?The Greater Light is like the bowl of a bell, and the lesser light is like the striker of the bell. There is the bowl, and there is the striker, and when they are not brought together, there is no sound. When the bowl is brought together with the striker, then there is reverberation. So is the Greater Light like the circle, and the lesser light like the ray. The Greater Light is the spiritual light, the emanation from the Godhead. The lesser light is the light of the soul, the emanation from the emanation. The Greater is like the wind, which is the breath of the air (Neschamah), and the lesser is like the breath of man (Ruach). When there are the two together, there is the word.So it is written that the light broke the vessel, which was the container of the Light.It was the contraction between the Greater Light and the lesser light, the reverberation, that broke the vessel. The soul broke the spirit: but here, “to break” means \"to tame.” So the expression says, “music tamed the savage.” Rut this is different, because to tame is to reveal from within, while to break is to receive from without. It is also said, “and God breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of the man” (Gen 2:7), and this was like the Received Word. Man was not alive until God “breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,” and this is like the “breaking of the vessels.” because when the man received the breath of life then he became alive, and so. when there was the contraction then the vessels broke.So it written that. “The fear of God is the First Light” (Bahir I. 190), because Shekinah, the Presence, is the light that shines from within Malkuth.

Occult Philosophy), it is to Crowley alone lo whom we owe the most approachable publication of the Unholy Trinity. Similarly, it is Savedow (cf. Goelic Evocation) who lisls in full the attributes of the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Five Accursed Nations mentioned but briefly by Waite,a. the Unholy TrinityThe doctrine of the triune Veils, and thus of the anthropomorphic trinity, is not at all Hebrew in origin. Il is. strictly Speaking, a unique dogma of Christianity which has, by post-Christian (gra) qabalists, been introduced into practical qabala as, at least, a concession and, at most, a profession, to Christianity. In ha qabala there is no trait which could be considered characteristic of the psychology of the concepts theorised to have preceded the divine emanations of the sefirot. To each sefirot is assigned a specific attribute which speaks volumes as to the activity or passivity of the Godhead in the process of creation, however, by all qabalists alike, the traits above and beyond these are not considered trails of the persona of God, rather, of his archetypal body or the essence of his precedent being.Therefore, it is un-qabalistic to premise traits of these three preeminent veils, existing solely prior to the act of creation, such as “Father.” “Son” or “Holy Spirit.” and thus to divide the body or being of God within itself into separate entities. This is simply contrary to known doctrine based on the Torah.However, to go further than this and assign adverse attributes to ihese unprecedented anlhropomorphications simultaneously denies the qabalistic practise of their ineffabiliiy and defies the organisation thereof proposed by anthropomorphic Christianity.In short, while on the one hand the Unholy Trinity is simply “un-Hebrew,” on the other hand it is outright \"anti-Christian.” Thus, it could easily be compared with Matt. 4: 3-10.references:The need to posit this strange trinity is explained by the urge to make the ten sefirot conform with the 13 attributes predicated of God. It is hardly surprising that Christians later lound an allusion lo their own doctrine of the trinity in this theory.-Scholem,The Church uses... (D) the term “person” or “hypostasis\" to designate the Father, Son. and Holy Spirit in the real distinction between them.... We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the “consubstantial\" Trinity.Cathechism of the Catholic Church, entries 252,3i. Qgmetiel: Crowd of GodsThis clearly refers to the Assembly of the Annunaki, the pantheon of Sumeria. According to ihe Enuma Elish, where the Babylonian national deity Marduk came to supplant the names of Anu, Father of the Sky, and Enki. Lord of the Earth, as well as various other source fragments of Sumeria unearthed at Nineveh and other locations in modern Iraq, this assembly was known as the Watchers, and were primarily gods or seasonal meteorology as well as common elements of the environment. As such, they differed markedly from other pantheons of the time, such as the Hindu and Egyptian, in that they were not depicted as zoomorphic, but as anthropomorphic. It is this Heavenly Legislative body (cf. Gardner) to which all the earliest fragmentary and complete versions of the apocryphal Book of Enoch (cf. Eisenman) refer as the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"“fallen angels” (cf. Prophet) who “to earth from heaven came.” (cf. Von Daaniken. Sitchin) In “shems,” (cf. Knight. Lomas) “took to wives the daughters of men.” (cf. Genesis) and bred the Nephilim, a race of “great men, men of renown.” (ibid) It is hypothesised by an increasing number of modern agnostic scholars that it was from this Grand Assembly that Abraham of Ur selected his patron deity, subsequently referred to as “elohim” (“my god”), which deity would eventually go on to be known variously as El Shaddai, Adonai, and YHVH.ii. Belia’al: WorthlessnessAs described above, the concept of beli yaal, a Hebrew idiom meaning \"worthless,” came into demonology at least as early as the Essenes, and may have been, as Beliar, known to the Hebrew national consciousness for some period of time before this also, lk-liar has been attributed, due to a peculiar pun. the concept of the “father of lies,\" however, as described in section II. 4, below, there are different interpretations for and applications of this terminological concept. Thus, the idea of the belia’al is comparable to that of Samael. who is known alternately as Samael the Black or Samael the Red, and of Lilith, who is known alternately as Lilith the elder and the younger.In this particular context, that is. the Unholy Trinity, the presence of Belia’al most likely represents an attempt by post-Christian qabalists to integrate recently uncovered Esscne material, which is only directly referenced in the Gospels, into a Structure whereby to counterbalance the overwhelming force of Catholic dogma.iii. A’athiel: UncertaintyUncertainty is only mentioned, as far as can be easily ascertained, twice in the bible. As such, it is difficult to fathom how it has entered the lexicon of demonology. Unlike the majority of other demons and devils, most of whom are admittedly considered fallen angels, Uncertainty does not appear to have been, at any time, anything other than an adverse attribute. That is to say that, in addition to not being the title of a king, demigod or deity, it was not the name of any particular historical figure of note, nor that of any other form of exalted figurehead.Thus, it does not appear to have any particularly relevant historical or Hebraic context. It appears that, as with the other attributes of the Unholy Trinity, however this one in particular, that this trait was included not from precedence of historical context or Hebraic origin, but from social commentary by a previous author on a contemporary sociopolitical situation. To this extent, we may make brief reference to Schroedinger’s Uncertainty Principle, the foundation of 20th century quantum mechanics, the study of the motions and characteristics of subatomic particles and waves.b. The Ten Orders of DemonsAccording to Arthur Edward Waite, in The Holy Kabbalah, p. 257-У, each of the ten orders of hell is residence lo a different order of demons, just as, according to traditional qabala, the various strata of heaven are home to the angelic hosts. Of course, in Hebrew theology the number of these heavens differs from the Christian conception, where there are several more, and the Muslim, in which there are fewer. Waite, who owed much of his conception to Levi, the majority of whose works he had translated into english, considered only the Hebrew conception of the setirotic heavenly orders when compiling his structure for the obverse attributes. To this extent, many of his findings are in keeping with those of Crowley (as adumbrated in section first Ucsh of Liber Ararila), and these, we may safely assume, both owe"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"primarily to Levi. In terms of difference between these two. Waite is somewhat more extensive, and less poetic, in his attribution to each of (he ten levels both a dominant attribute <the order) as well as a “cortex,” that is, a shell, whom he seems to have envisioned as being the governing faculty [hereof. In the published works of Crowley no such correspondence can be readily found, and he seems to have used, for all practical purposes, the ten Rulers listed above as his governing faculties when working with these and related constructs.Many of Waite's “cortices\" may be found in Davidson's Dictionary of Angels, although some are notably absent, not only from there, but also, apparently, from any direct Biblical mention, and one must assume, therefore, that these attributes are culled, as, admittedly, are many of Waite’S adverse attributes, from the medieval grimoires, which have no sound qabalistic connection. For this reason, among others, one must question, at least, their relevance to a system based on the Hebrew (specifically Ari qabalistic and rabbinical Zoharic) conception of the qliphoth. as is implied by Waite’s nomination of these grimoire derived attributes as “cortices.'’Despite this, in order to provide the fullest body of research into these matters as possible, the “cortical\" attributes will be mentioned, and their origins, as best as possible given the limited materials of research, will be traced. Unfortunately, due to the lack of material on this particular subject and related paradigms of research, only certain attributes and correspondences can be recovered, while others, perhaps even easily implied to the current investigator, cannot be contemporarily pursued. Though frustrating, this ought offer no serious impediment to the ardent researcher, for whom other such material may be available.Further inquiry' into the adverse correspondences referenced by these attributes relative to existing material regarding the qabalistic Tree of Life construct may prove equally fruitful as far as further illustrating their traits, from which, perhaps, one would hope, a deeper understanding of the nature of their characters may be gleaned.i.

To the Aryans, the sun was known as Surya, and drawn upon the seat of a chariot by seven horses <or a seven-headed horse). However, later, once the Aryans had migrated out of India and into Ihe Middle liast, Surya became Asurya, ihe setting sun, and was associated with all the common adverse attributes.According to M.P. Hall, “ primitive conceptions concerning the warfare between the principles of Good and Evil were often based upon the alternations of day and night.” The Bright Adityas became the evil Asuryas. and the dark Daevas became the exalted Devas.By that time, the Aryans had migrated into Persia, and began propagating their myths there as well. The tales of Ahurah-Mazda, the light, and Ahriman, the dark, would give rise later to Zoroastrianism, which, along with the mythology of Thoth of Egypt, would contribute to the legends of Hermes Trismegestus of Greece.Just as Hermes would eventually come, by a combination of many other mythologies, to be known as Christos Messiah of the Hellenic Hebrews, burgeoning forth the solar cult of Christianity, where the crucified Christos was surrounded by his treacherous twelve (zodiacal) disciples, so, in the far east, would the remnants of the Vedas combine with the mythologies of the lesser Hindu caste to birth Buddhism, where the ever changing mask worn by the single concept of the self deity was seen as an illusion to be transcended by a contemplative lifestyle.Again, as the ultimate transcendence of Christos was achieved by his death on the grand cross, so, in Buddhism, is the highest state of trance to be achieved when the self becomes one with the non-self. Thus, just as in the past the demons were once the angels, who fell for refusing to worship the self, perhaps these modem monotheism will fall when we realise it is not the self which should be worshipped. The angels were a means to an end, and, when that end was achieved, they were discarded and became the fallen ones, the elder gods in the plural. So, too, is the central solar self the means also to an end, and once that end is achieved, it too will be discarded, and the Christos Messiah will become synonymous with the modern concept of the devil.references:Adityas — the shininR Rods of the V'edic pantheon, consisting of 7 celestial deities or angels, with Varuna as chief.

Seven Hells and 12 Infernal OmensHere, we find the completion of the attributes given, above, by Crowley in 777. By taking the twelve, so-called, \"zodiacal qliphoth\" from one source and combining it here, we are coming around full circle to the correspondence of attributes with the Hebrew alephbel. The three veils may be thought of as alike the three mother letters, the seven hells as alike the palatials (or doubles), and the twelve “astrological” omens as alike the gutturals.The three veils and seven hells are given as the basis for the Tree of Death diagram by Savedow, which, it should be noted and underscored by the solemn seeker, was both created exclusively to express these traits, and is to be found nowhere else in the known published material on ha qabala.a. the Shrouds of the DeepTo understand the three qliphotic veils we must first have some understanding of their qabalistic counterparts. These concepts, understood as preceding the divine emanations of the sefirot. are the ayin, the ein sof, and the ein sof aur.The ayin, or “nothingness,\" is that concept associated with the description of man’s ability lo conceive of the original form, prior to the creation, of the divine Godhead.It can be associated with the world of Atziluth, of Emanation or of Conception. Beneath this is the ein sof, or “infinite,” which describes the conception of attributes of the divine Godhead, still, prior to creation. It. likewise, can be associated with Brlah. the world of Creation. The ein-sof aur. or “infinite light” describes the beginning of the realm of Formation in that it is within this realm that the emanated sefirot were created and formed. Thus, it is associated with Yetzirah, the realm of Formation. Below this is Assiah, the world of Action, subtending to the sefirot Malkuth and drawing its activity therefrom. As explained in the Zohar and elsewhere, this activity is to “return to the Godhead,” and is the essence of the Shekinah, or Matronit of the Godhead.Such, however, is the esoteric side of ha qabala. The exoteric counterpart to this derives from the Torah, Book of Genesis. Chapter 1. verse 2.

However it is noi sufficiently clear whether the reference is lo three lights between the Emanaior and the lirsl emanation, or lo three lights irradiating one another within ihe substance of the Emanaior itself — boih possibilities can be supported. In the terminology of ihe Kabbalah these three lights are called zazahot (“splendours”), and they are thought of as the roots of the three upper Sefirot which emanate from them.-Scholem.

Chasek: DarknessWhy is it written, “with 32?” Because it was with the ten that God inscribed the twenty-two. Ten is the Light, and the twenty-two are the light. So it is said that the attributes of God are thirteen in number. Why is this? Because the first three are each two, for there is the Bahir above and the Zohar below. This is the Yetzirah. The Yetzirah is the inscription of the Bahir above onto the zohar below. So it is that there are many zoharim. but only One Bahir. How can this be? Because the two of each of the three are like the Light within the light, concealed, and these three are like One, because they are the attributes of the One God. Jah, who is the Lord of Hosts. He is one Lord, whose attributes are “a Host.” This is why there is One Bahir. There are many zoharim in the Yetzirah, because of the inscription. When God took the Vav, the nail, to inscribe the lesser light with the Greater l ight, he broke the vessels. This is what brought the flood. Because il is said lhal “Darkness was on the face of the deep\" but this can also be understood, “of the waters.” And the waters below were the lesser light. But when the lesser light was broken, it let forth the waters above, lhat is, the Greater Light. And just as the Yetzirah of the zohar was a covenant, so was the One Bahir a blessing.Why is it written, \"of Wisdom?” because of Wisdom, there are the 32 paths. There is Wisdom (Chokma) and the Kingdom (Malkulh) and there is a close on it. But above this is a crown (Kether). This is like a king who brought Wisdom lo His kingdom. In the beginning of wisdom was the crown, and the crown was the middle of the kingdom. The king (Malkah) who brought wisdom was Jah. But in Malkah there is no yod. because in the open hand there is no longer the nail. This is because the work is finished. Why is the work finished? Because it is written that “engraved Jah. the Lord of Hosts.” What does it mean, “engraved?” It means, the Light is in the light above, and that the light is in the Light below. So it is scaled, and so it is concealed.Rabbi Xehuniah ben HaKana said: One verse ijob 37:21) states, “And now they do"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"not see light, il is brilliant (Bahir) in the skies...

Another verse, however (Psalm 18:12), states, ‘He made darkness Mis hiding place.” Il is also written (Psalm 97:2), “Cloud and gloom surround Him.\" Tins is an apparent contradiction.

Night shines like day — light and darkness are ihe same.”-Bahir. 1:1When the king conceived ordaining lie engraved engravings in the luster on high....“ Hie enlightened will shine like ihe splendour (ZoharI of the sky, and those who make the masses righteous will shine like the stars forever and ever”(Daniel 12:31-Zohar 1:1With 32 mystical paths ol Wisdom engraved Yah the Lord ol Hosls Sefer Yetzirah 1:1Bui there are excavations of excavations.- Mathers, 50 (the Book of Concealed Mystery, 251Rabbi Bun also sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 45:7), “He forms lighi and creates darkness?\" Light has substance. Therefore ihe term \"formation is used with regard to it. Darkness has no substance, and therefore, with regard lo it, the term “creation\" is used. It is similarly written (Amos 4:12), \"He lorms mountains and creates the wind.\" Another explanation is this: Lighi was actually brought into existence, as it is written: (Genesis 1:3), “And God said, let there be light.” Something cannot be brought into existence unless it is made. The term “formation” is therefore used. In the case of darkness, however, there was no making, only separation and setting aside. It is for this reason that the term “created\" (bara) is used. It has the same sense as in the expression. “Thai person became well (hi-Brial.\"Bahir, I, 13b. the Seven HellsHere we are presented with an, essentially, atheistic, and thus, \"bare bones\" approach to the mystic tradition of the process of death. This process, here denuded, is elsewhere illustrated in very richly symbolic imagery', which is. often, highly initiatory in nature. In such works as the Egyptian “Manifestation in the Light.\" the Buddhist “Liberation through Hearing.” the Mayan “Our Place in the Shadows.” the Nahuatl “Jaguar Translator.” the Christian “Ars Morendi.” (cf. Grof) or the most recent edition, the Hebrew “Ba/akim.” (cf. Senyak), is this process of death treated. All of these have been cited by modern Free and Associated speculative Masons as being of the heritage of their order, the rituals of which ought, rightly, also be here included.The tradition of burial or disposal of the dead is, despite aphorisms to the contrary, the oldest human practise, and was even engaged in by our Neanderthal cousins, who. it is thought, cohabitated near enough our own ancient ancestors for some such certain rituals to have been culturally interchanged between them. We cannot, therefore, say that this conceptual ceremony was an invention even of our own genus, let alone of one particular ethnic race thereof, as some might have it.However, the preservation of the corpus of literature of this ritual, as well as, at least"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"among certain of its civilisations, the preservation of the corpse itself, was, indeed, the domain of the priest-class of all these early civilisations. Having derived their authorities directly from the role of the shamans of the late neolithic nomadic tribes, the priest craft preserved not only the sanctity of death, but their own importance to the newly flourishing nation-states by its strong affiliation and association with the concordant rituals, rites and ceremonies. From the time of mummification to the time of Extreme Unction, it has ever been the priest-caste shaman who has inserted themselves as indisposable to the right functioning of the passing on of the departed.Here, however, what we are confronted with is not a prolapsed rite of passage along the way of the dead for the deceased soul, but merely a brief instruction on how to dump a body. There is hardly enough material involved in this manual for it to be included among the other works entitled “books of the dead,” for here we find no treatment whatsoever of any form of afterlife, unlike the lugubrious passages in those same works which extirpate endlessly on the many worlds and beings encountered beyond. However, to understand the significance of these seven levels or locations of the atheistic Hell, we must needs treat in some greater detail the compendium morle of these same, more illustrious, instruction pamphlets.The Tibetan and Egyptian Books of the Dead are probably the oldest surviving copies of such works, with the Tibetan being the \"more recent” (cf. Grof) and “more organised” (ibid). The Egyptian scrolls, known collectively as the scrolls of Anl, named for the scribe whose name is substituted throughout for the cattouce of the relevant pharaoh or their family, deal thoroughly with the God-forms one encounters in the first several days after death. Some research (cf . Budge) has shown that these “God-forms\" arc the astral equivalents of the priest-class undertakers who arc, simultaneously to the reading of the properly contextualised passages, preparing the body for mummification and entombment. The Egyptian Rook of the Dead differs here markedly from the Tibetan in that, while the Egyptian is concerned most with the preservation of the afterlife essence for an eventual reincarnation in the same preserved body, the Tibetan is mostly concerned with the very prevention of the afterlife essence from return to the manifest, material existence. While the Tibetan Book sets the stage for the Oriental, the Egyptian paves the way for the Occidental mindset.Following from these arc the Hebrew and Christian Kooks of the Dead, which are far less codified and altogether scrambled up, being entirely spread throughout disparate works by various sources. Perhaps, given time, they too will be sufficiently codified in a unified body, perhaps under Masonry, to be properly included in this grand cultural tradition, and thus to. as their respective religions purport to offer, transcend the shackles of time.In a supposedly completely separate tradition we find the Mayan I’opul Vuh and the Chayyim Balam of the Yucatan. These bear such striking similarities to Sumerian mythology that they cannot even be gone into here in due detail, and are wholly worthy enough to deserve a completely ulterior project. Suffice it to say that, again, these similarities arc already known and kept safe in the hands of modern speculative Free and Associated Masons.a few, brief, references:The text of the Bardo Thodol Is recited by the lama In the presence of the corpse.The background of this unusual book is not live niggardly European elther-or,’ buta magnificently affirmative 'both-and.'

Like The Egyptian Book of the Dead, it is meant to be a guide for the dead man during the period of his Bardo existence, symbolically described as an intermediate state of forty nine days' duration between death and rebirth.-Jung, Psychological Commentary, xxxv, xxxvi, xxxviii, xliiTurning now to the text itself, we find that structurally it is founded upon the symbolical number Forty-nine, the square of the sacred number Seven; for... there are seven worlds or seven degrees of Maya within the Sangsara, constituting seven globes on a planetary chain. On each globe there are seven rounds of evolution, making the forty nine (seven times seven) stations ol active existence. Similarly, the forty nine days of the Rardo may also be symbolical of the Forty and Nine powers of the Mystery of the Seven Vowels. In Hindu mythology... these Vowels were the* mystery of the Seven Fires and their forty-nine subdivisional fires or aspects. They are also represented by the Svastlka signs upon the crowns of the seven heads of the Serpent of Eternity of the Northern Buddhist Mysteries, originating in ancient India.-Lama Ka/J Dawa-Samdup, 6. 7At a very remote period certain groups of sections or chapters had already become associated with some of the ceremonies which preceded actual burial, and these eventually became a distinct ritual with clearly defined limits. Side by side, however, with this ritual there seems to have existed another and larger work, which was divided into an indefinite number of sections or chapters comprising chiefly prayers, and which dealt on a larger scale with the welfare of the departed in the next world, and described the state of existence therein and the dangers which must be passed successfully before It could be reached, and was founded generally on the religious dogmas and mythology ol the Egyptians. The title of \"Book of the Dead\" is usually given by Egyptologists lo the editions of the larger work which were made in the XVIIIth and following dynasties, but in this Introduction the term is intended lo include ihe general body of lexis which have reference 10 the burial of the dead and to the new life In the world beyond the grave, and which are known to have existed In revised editions and to have been in use among the Egyptians from about B.C.. 4500 to the early centuries of the Christian era.-Budge, xiThe Hebrew Hook of Ihe Dead contains some 120 lines of Scripture distributed in 44 segments or b'/akim. The complete text, of very great aniiquily, is contained in the first six books of the Hebrew Bible. The Hexateuch contains a clear and straightforward story line that extends from the creation of Heaven and Earth, preceding the formation of a living human, to the burial of Joseph's bones in Schechem.

(k>d will visit and overcome the Leviathan, the Pole Serpent, and the Leviathon, the Coiled Serpent, and He will kill the dragon ol the sea\" (Isaiah 27:11. This Pole Serpent is often associated with the constellation Draco. Indeed, 4500 years ago, Thuban, a star in l>raco’s tail, was the pole star. In describing the positions of the stars, the ancients made use of the ecliptic pole rather than the celestial pole. In this system, we find that the constellation Draco actually surrounds the ecliptic pole. Hebrew astronomers also used the term Tell to denote the Inclination of the orbit of a planet from the ecliptic, particularly In the case of the mixin. In medieval astronomy, the ascending node was often called the 'dragon's head,\" while the descending node was often called “dragon's tail.\" Most early Hebrew writers reler to it by its» Arabic name AI Kaz'har. Juz'har is a Persian word, meaning \"knot\" or “node.\" Rabbi Abraham Abulafia also identifies the Teli with the celestial ‘knots\" (Kesharim). There is also a tradition that there are two Tells or dragons, one male and the other female. These are identified as the two Leviathans, and are mentioned in the account of creation, “God created the great dragons' (Genesis 1:21). According to the Talmud, the Pole Serpent mentioned by Isaiah is the male dragon, while the ('.oiled Serpent (Nachash Akalkalon) is the female. Some kabbalists state that the constellation of Draco Is the male Pole Serpent, while the inclination of the ecliptic is the female Coiled Serpent.-Kaplan, 243-6Now these four formulae [Air of Faith, Water of Faith, Earth of Earth and Fire of Farth] will imply four simultaneous movements in the revolution of the forces symbolised by the four aces around the Northern Pole.

The Hebrew name Adam derives f rom the elder form adamma, meaning \"red clay earth” (cf. Gardner), which is, in Hebrew, expressed simply as Edom, or “red.\" Thus, before the creation of Adam, the first man, that from which he would be formed by the hand of God was merely “worthless red clay earth.\" So it is said, “ashes to ashes and dust to dust,\" from the earth we arc- fashioned. and. in the end. to it shall we return.So it is also said, “in the image of God created lie him.” Here we see that the proportions of man are relative to those in the heavens. This is to say that, the anthropomorphication of the ten luminous emanations is the archetype of a man. Thus, this ideal man has come to be known to qabalisls as the Adam Kadmon. The study of the image of this ideal archetype is known as the parzufim. Here we see that the Kadmon was the image of God in which Adam was created.This is why the generations of Adam are listed “from the beginning.” Mot because, scientifically speaking. Adam was the first homo sapien. Because, rather. God favoured Adam above all others, and so it was of his lineage that God’s chosen and elect were sired, and, thus, from whose stock would come the Messiah.So, until the coming of His day, our atonement and the final judgment of all mankind, man will be drawn down by the sicknesses and ageing of his flesh, to return to ihe earth from whence he came, the gaping maw of the grave.

A complete stopping of menstruation is called amenorrhea. Unusual bleeding could be due lo some systemic disease, such as lead poisoning or a shortage of Vitamin B.

This can be caused by stroke, cerebral palsy, spinal cord Injury, and multiple sclerosis. In spastic paralysis the muscles overreact to stimuli. They resist being stretched to their full length and may produce spasms or clonus. Injury to the peripheral nervous system — that is, the anterior horn cells of ihe spinal cord or the individual nerves produces flaccid paralysis. Flaccid muscles remain limp and do not respond lo any stimulus; there are no spasms or clonus. Flaccid paralysis is also a temporary stage lhat immediately follow» a spinal cord injury or stroke.

Persons who get the disease have in their blood high levels of uric acid, a natural byproduct of body processes. The patient’s system either manufactures too much uric acid or is unable to get rid of it fast enough. The result is formation in ihe Joints of crystals of sail of uric acid, monosodium urate.

In uremia, the blood levels of urea, uric acid, creatinine, and other nitrogenous waste products may be from ten to twenty limes the normal, and produce sever symptoms. In addition, there is retention of sullate and phosphate, which help to produce the acidosis of uremia. The high plasma phosphate lowers the plasma calcium and helps produce bone changes.

Normal cells have a buill in control mechanism. They are coded so that they develop in an orderly fashion, and adjust themselves constantly to the part of the body in which they are located. In the cancer cell something happens to the built-in mechanism. The cell no longer responds in terms of the body environment, but reproduces Itself wildly. More and more cells develop, but they are useless at best, and often grow to choke off the functions of normal cells, tissues and organs. The unhealthy cell colonies arc- called neoplasms. Some neoplasms are not cancers but are called benign tumors. On the other hand, malignant neoplasms, or cancer, may consist of different cells from those nearby. They also exhibit metastasis, which means they can travel through the body to take root in other organs and tissues to start new pockets of cancer. There are two general types of cancer. One, carcinoma, develops from epithelial tissue, which lines the Inner passages of the body or composes the outer covering called skin. The other, sarcoma, originates in connective tissue.

Between them, as the seven lower emanations of the qliphoth above and conjoining with Malkuth (via the Taniniver, blind dragon), we sec Lilith, the Maiden of Night.In this arrangement, we should consider Lilith in her role as the Servant of Heaven, or High Priestess of the ziggurat temple.

Grant III) of tile “Star Fire” (cf. Gardner, Grant) ceremonies. This ritual, known to modem practitioners as the ‘‘Black Mass” due to its literal stance regarding the sacraments of the Last Supper, harkens back to the most occult, that is, subsequently occluded, practises of Yoga.These now arcane rituals, known as Tantra yoga, are still practised in some form by ihe most ennobled followers of the Eight Fold Path of modern Buddhism, however they derive from the elder Bhon religion of Tibet which was, by the Vedic Aryans migrating through China from India to Turkey, organised into the ancient martial aits of later Buddhism. The practise of Tantra yoga, which involves yogic positions and postures, such as those depicted in the Kama Sutra, culminating in sexual rites was known from ancient limes as the “left hand\" path of Hindu religion, il is thought, because in the Thangkas and tyling boards depicting these postures, it was beneath the left hand of ihe presiding deity that these rites were illustrated.According to the most ancient descriptions, the imbibation of the endocrinal secretions of the chakras. produced by the rising Kundalini force activated by the sexual ceremonies of Tantra yoga, was considered the mechanism by which the highest state of enlightenment was attained. The secretions themselves, known internally as the kalas, externally and collectively as soma, were mixed together with one another to produce a variety of concoctions, not only for use in ceremony, but which were also medicinal in nature.This ancient knowledge, actually performed by the most adept practitioners of Bhon Tantric Buddhism, the high-priests of the ancient fertile crescent, and depicted in the myth of the Ilallupu tree as being the task of the priestess of immortality, was brought to Egypt through Iraq from India, but. even long before this, was the medical heritage of the Aboriginal Shamans of Australia. The route of migration of ancient homo-sapiens shows quite clearly that, from their poinl of origin in North­eastern Africa, they migrated first lo the continent of Australia, which, during ihe late Ice Age, was still connected to southern Asia by a land bridge.

The yoga position associated with this connection, where the arch of one foot is placed first atop the dome of the head and the ball and heel of the other foot placed at the cochsis and pelvic aperture respectively, is known as ihe \"death posture\" and has been depicted in various forms by artist Austin Spare.Also, eight is the number of the Chinese trigrams, from which are composed the f>4 hexagrams of the I Chlng. These, representing the primary elements and their combinations as the seasons, may be thought of as the connection between the supernal and subtended chakras. Of these eight trigrams there are 32 Tao lines, 16 being of Yin (male) and 16 of Yang (female). From this is extrapolated further the 16 biological or terrestrial kalas (8 male and 8 female), and the 16 astral or heavenly kalas. Internally lo the trigrams, the arrangement of these tao lines is integral to their identification, however between the irigrams. the arrangement of the tao lines is arbitrary, and represented by any number of relative arrangements. It is from this that the kalas may be associated with the ten emanations and 22 letters of ha qabala. which total 32. the same as twice 16. representing the 8 male and 8 female terrestrial chakras and the corresponding astral or heavenly tao.

As stated before, the 32 paths on the tree of life are meant to represent the 33 vertebrae of the spinal column, where the concept of the three veils corresponds to the eleventh, “non-sefira” of Daath (cf. Grant 1).The lunar cycles being superior, rather than inferior, to the solar cycles is not an idea confined to the Hindu, but is to be found also in (he Old Kingdom of Egypt, where the invention of the lunar calendar (attributed to Thothl predated that of the solar calendar (attributed to Re), as it may have in most late neolithic civilisations (cf. Sitchln). The Greek word, “calends” is derived from the earlier Sanskrit “kala” (cf.

Rlind Dragon changes to initial arrangements of attributesa. the Ten Demon KingsAs mentioned in the introduction to the Blind Dragon system, the attributions of Belphegor and l ucifuge Koffacale were inverted, and the attribution of Lucifugc Roffacale was replaced by Lucifer.The reason for the reversal of the attributions of Relhegor (who possibly derived from Balberith, the demon of pacts), and Lucifuge Roffacale (the demon of darkness), lies in the sefirot to which these two were originally assigned, as well as to the orders of demons occupying the qliphoth obverse to these sefirot.Now, as it had been initially, Belphegor was assigned to the litigation or the Disputcr order of demons, which occupied the qliphotic domain obverse to the sefirot Tiferet, or beauty. Also, in the original arrangement. Lucifuge Koffacale was attributed to the Order of the Concealers, or the Hidden, occupying obverse Binah, or understanding.To represent the fall of the broken shells from surrounding the emanations, the Ari version of the tree of life came to replace that of the earlier Gra version. In the Ari version, the version with which most qabalists are probably more familiar, Tiferet is inferiorly positioned below Din or Chesed. It is from this version that Ihe Veil of the Abyss, separating the three supernal sefirot from the seven lower emanations, as well as Daath. the “non Sefirot” occupying the Veil of the Abyss, have been derived. This is due mainly to the misunderstanding that there was only a single contraction, that which broke the seven lower shells, rather than four, one between each of the qabalistic worlds of the creation. Thus, the subtending of the middle pillar sefirot. the Veil of the Abyss, and the “non-sefirot” Daath. are all based on the misapplication of a single contraction separating the three supernal sefirot from the seven lower shells.If, however, the Ari version is restored to the original Gra version of the tree of life diagram, which predated the difficult explanation of the “breaking of the vessels” and the formation of the qliphoth given by Isaac Luria and his school, then we see that the sefirot on the middle pillar each move up one position, and thus Tiferet comes to occupy the position of Daath. in the contraction of the Veil of the Abyss.The consequence of this is that Tiferet is now, itself, superior to Din or Chesed, which was, supposedly, the initial of the seven lower shells to have been broken upon separation from the supernal emanations of Ihe Godhead.So, in the Gra arrangement. Tiferet occupies the position which, in the Ari, Daath had come to occupy, immediately inferior on the middle pillar to the utmost supernal, and centrally between the supernals and the inferiors.Thusly. on the reverse side of the sefirot, we see that the position initially held by Belphegor is now placed, by order of emanations, immediately after that of l.ucifuge Koffacale. This places the importance of Ihe roles of the demonic orders governed over by these two kings in a new light.Now we can see what was “concealed” by the order of demons ruling reverse Binah, that Is, the original position of the sefirot before the fall of the broken shells. Also, now, the Litigation has progressed from an inferior to a superior position. Therefore. Lucifuge Roffacale. the Dark, no longer prevails over this \"concealment” and instead"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Relphegor, the lord of pacts, is returned to his wardenship over the “hidden\" covenant. Likewise, the repositioning of beauty to occupy the prior location of the Veil of the Abyss implies the coming of Lucifer, the Light, to replace the fallen stance of Lucifuge Roffacale, the Dark, over the Litigation in prior Daath.b. Ten Orders of DemonsThe reversal of the order of the Obscene Ass and the Ravens of Death is far less obtuse than lhat of Belphegor and Lucifer. The reason for this reversal was simply that, by placing the ten commandments in a descending order obverse of the sefirot, the sin of Adultery occupies reverse Netzach, or mercy, while that of Theft occupies reverse Hod. or splendour. Thus, we may choose to see, if we like, that the order of the Obscene is more fit to govern over reverse Netzach and the sin of Adultery, while the Murder of Crows is more fit to govern over reverse Hod and the sin of Theft.C. The Tree of Death in generalWhile the position of the seven locational Hells on Savedow’s original tree of death diagram have not been changed, in arranging the twelve infernal omens on the twelve paths he has assigned between these shells, it was chosen not to follow the numerical order given by him to correspond to the attributes given by Crowley. The numerical ordering, thus, has been turned upside down, as previously discussed, wilh only a few modifications following from this.These later, minor modifications all stem from a convenience of correspondence with their surrounding attributes. For example, all five of the previously Inferior paths, now attributed to the upper part of the tree of death diagram, have been rearranged. Malignant Women now connects the Grave, or Triple Hell with Clay because the two of seven venial sins represented by these attributes are. respectively. Lust and Wrath. Likewise, the omen Clayey has been moved to between the Pit and Clay, switching places with the omen Fishy, now connecting Perdition and (he Pit. Snakey, also, has been positioned perpendicular to the paths of Hrazen and Flaming.However, it should be remembered that the initial attributes given by Crowley in 777 for the twelve infernal omens was meant to correspond as part of a set of twenty two that. In total, compared to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alephbet. Thus, no direct correspondence can be derived from a comparison to the initial alephbctical set and the diagram for the tree of death by Savedow. In other words, the placement of these particular attributions on the tree of death diagram is, at best, arbitrary.d. the 22 parzufim, or Crowley's cjliphoth sui generisAs described in the section on the alterations of the ten demon kings, massive changes occur when substituting the Gra for the Arl version of the tree of life diagram. The position of paths is thrown askew, and the Gra lettering for the alephbctical correspondences among the zodiac, planets and three elements leaves much lo be desired by way of a more satisfactory model. Therefore, rather than ihe correspondent lettering attributes for the paths on the Gra tree of life diagram, the planets, signs of the zodiac, and three elementals have been positioned according to the correspondent types of paths on the Gra tree of life: 3 horizontals, seven verticals and twelve diagonals. The internal order among these was arrived at by an examination of the gematria of the letters, and their relevant correspondences to the planets and signs and elements followed thusly. The result of this hybrid arrangement is also known as the Black arrangement."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"In translating this to Crowley's qliphoth sui generis, only the letter-based cypher given in Osiris Amoun and the Qliphoth was used to replace each individual letter attribute on the rearranged Hybrid tree of life with the correspondent letter attribute given by Crowley for the 22 orders of the qliphoth. Where duplicate letters in the cypher were given, an approximation based on phonetics as well as upon relative correspondence upon the tree itself were used to ascertain the most likely accurate letter.III. the St. Simon TarotmqnKrtjon eaTeheti loUA. a brief history of Tarot as the Rook of ThothThe Tarot was probably imported into liurope by the Gypsies, descendants of the Egyptian librarians of Alexandria. While the Gypsies arc often thought of as Eastern European in origin, associated with the CiOths, we should not disregard the possibility of Italian and Spanish heritage as well. The possible migration of the Alexandrian Egyptians after the burning of their library in 391 CE (wikipedia.com) and before their recognition as a population in England under Henry Mil (Hall. 4(>9) may have traced through Roman Christian Italy or Moslem Spain just as easily as up the Caucasus mountain range through Carpathia.The Tarot purports to be a recreation of the Book of Thoth, which clearly implies Egyptian origin. However, the Book of Thoth is not made direct reference to in Egyptian mythology itself. So. Thoth is clearly an authentic Egyptian deity. The concept of his authorship, however, is attributable to later tribes and nation states. These tribes and nation-states attempted to include the Egyptian mythos within the mysteries of their own religions. This was probably in order to gain adherents through conversion.The primary sources for the concept of a Book of Thoth are the Egyptian mystery of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Ilermcs Trismegistus and the pre-deluvial Hebrew Patriarch. Enoch.The primary resource of writing attributed to the Thrice Great Greek Messenger God is a scattered collection of writings known as the Hermetica, primary among which is the story of the Dragon Poimandres. This story suggests the constellation of Draco.The remainder of tractates attributable to the Hermetic differ in number according to different researchers. According to one source (Freake and Gandy), there are 20 tractates, including prayers and prophecies of Hermes, and according to another (Yogi Publication Society) there are seven Hermetic Axioms.As to the Book of Enoch, it is not a question of compilation, but of replication. There arc two different Hooks of Enoch in circulation today. One is Slavonic in origin, the other Ethiopian. The Ethiopian is known simply as the Hook of Enoch (1 Enoch; and the Slavonic as the Secrets of Enoch (2Enoch). Neither the Slavic nor Ethiopian arc recognised as Canonical by Christians or Hebrews.The Ethiopian does far exceed in its complexity other works attributed to the Saqqara Hebrews of the region, such as the Book of Kings (Kcbra Negast). Whereas the Book of Kings is a largely historical treatise. Enoch treats of astronomy and geography. It is not impossible that the Ethiopic version of Enoch was authentically inspired from the Egyptian mysteries.The Slavic version might even be a later, European version of 1 Enoch. It is likely that this later. Slavic, version is upon which the Gypsies based Tarot.Now, should we consider that Ethiopian 1 Enoch was known to early medieval Slovenia, we must surely further add the influence of Spanish Septamanian ha qabala to the inspirational nexus productive of Tarot.We must bear in mind that the premise of the Tarot’s Egyptian origin, postulated by Court de Gebelin just prior to the French Revolution (Waite, 43), was probably predicated on an incomplete set. These include the Gringoneur deck for Charles VI of France in 1393. and a Florentine set from between 1413 and 1418 possessed by Countess Gonzaga at Milan, possible Bolognese decks as early as 1423. not to mention the popular Raldini-Mantegna deck of SO. (Waite, 3S-41) These incomplete decks were probably only an attempt at symbolising the 52 cards of Turkish Mamluk, or the 36 cards of Arabian Trappola. (Payne-Towler, 1)While some of the SO Mantegna Baldini symbols were directly adopted as, or directly reflected, Tarot trumps, their 5 classes (being 1: the conditions of life, 2: the muses, 3: the schools of learning. 4: the virtues, and 5: the heavens) were used as a means to combine the elder trumps to the four suits of Turkish Mamluk and Arabian Trappola.Thus, the symbolically ideal number of cards of the lesser arcana should be SO, in keeping with the complete Mantegna-Baldini set. Should these be divided into four suits, such as with Mamluk and Trappola, each of ten numbered cards, then ten \"court” card places yet remain. Hence, in place of the noble cards, per suit, should fall the four step Pythagorean tetractys (of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - 10). (Payne Towler, 4)In addition to the 7 planets of antiquity and the 12 zodiacal houses. 36 dekans governing 10 degrees each. 3 per sign, of the ecliptic zodiac, were known to the Egyptians, and given hieroglyphic form, however it is likely that their doubling by- day and night was a latter Hebraic modification to this system, most probably adopted around the time of the Mosaic exodus. Thus, combining the 50 lesser arcana with the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"22 major trumps yields 72. a number signifying the days and nights of the 36 dekans. This number is also significant of the precession thereof. So. we can say that the distinction between the 22 and the 50 was made at this time or later, but lhat it was already generally accepted by the early medieval period.The division between the 22 trumps and 50 exoteric djinnis can. further, be interpreted as a numerical modification to the allegorical war in heaven described in Enoch and Revelation. Now. we know that the numerical mysteries of 3. 7 and 12 (22 inclusive) were known in Hebrew and the 36 (modified by the Hebrew to 72) were known in Egypt.The cryptogram of the whole Arcana is thus completed by the doubling (by day and night) of the authentically Egyptian dekans of Ihe civic calendar. This modification to the calendar brought it in line with the 365 day rough solar year by consisting of ten day weeks, concluding in the five heiru renpet, or holy days. This modification to previous lunar calendars of 354 or 384 days is authentically Egyptian, and therefore, having been likely known by the Alexandrian librarians, accounts for the attribution of the incomplete Mantegna-Baldini deck to the Gypsies by Gebelin.The cryptogram of the Major Arcana may be deciphered by deriving that the four terrestrial, corporeal or manifest elements, arc all one element, earth, and that this one terrestrial, corporeal or manifest element was derived from a combination of the spiritual essence and the remaining three elements. This modification to elemental numerology is an authentically Hebrew idea which dates to at least the sixth century when the earliest quotes from the Hebrew Sefer Yetzirah appear. (Kaplan, ix)B. the Ordering of the Major Trumps InclusiveNow, we must know something of the primary myth of unified Egypt. There are five central characters of this myth: Osiris, Isis, Thoth, llorus and Set or Typhon. These arc the same as the 5 heiru renpet, except for Thoth. who is replaced by Nephthys. In the myth. Set betrays and slays Osiris; Isis and Thoth conspire to resurrect Osiris; the child born by the union of the resurrected Osiris and Isis is llorus. who slays Set.Now. it is clear this myth treats of the five elements and of the reduction to spirit, and, as such, is alchemical. llorus. spirit, reduces Set. earth, to the basic elements of salt: Isis, mercury: Thoth, and sulphur: Osiris. Salt is water, sulphur is fire, and mercury is the breath of air lhat decides between them.Now. taking these 3 Egyptian dignities and assigning them their alchemical elements thus, we add them to the 7 hieroglyphs of the planets and the 12 of the fixed zodiac, thus equaling 22 total. These are to be signified by the 22 trumps thus: 0-<)siris (Orion), 1-Thoth (the magician), and Il-lsis (the papis of Pope Joan card). The remainder signify the planetary' or zodiacal dignities, however their order has been lost, and the symbolism depicted by the trumps remains reflective of this.Now. the order of the remaining trumps is unclear and several interpretations exist. Oldest among these are gematria, originating wilh Pythagoras (582 496 bee), and the Ari and Gra orders of the Sefer Yetzirah (6th century ce), written down in Spanish Septamania (8th century ce): later the aleph-bet was reformed by Eliezar Ben Ihuda (1858-1922) to include the seven finals (or doubles) and the letters were crowned.Now, until as late as the 1920’s, there were only the letters in themselves, with their elemental, planetary and zodiacal attributions, but no ordered aleph-bet. When the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"aleph-bet was first ordered, it was done so by comparison to the Greek, and this implies that it may have been ordered by Pythagoras. However, despite this, the later Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luuria, around 1590) and Gra (Rabbi Eliahu, Gaon ofVUna, in the lSih century) versions are at variance to the current aleph-bet arrangement and disagree with it almost at every point. (Kaplan, xxv} Moreover, they do not agree even with one another except at seven points. (Kaplan, 29, 30)Now. interpretations anterior to the Ari and Gra are based on the reformed aleph-bet of ben Ihuda. and the method of early Phonecian-famlly languages gematria of Pythagoras (Barry, 10). Using a combination of gematria and the arrangement of Isaac Luria (1160 -1236 ce), it is possible to determine an arrangement of the 22 letters, and consequently of their elementary, planetary and zodiacal attributes, on a 4th dimensional hypercubic lattice. However, this does not solve the problem of their order of occurrence. That there can be 22 lines drawn between the ten points of the tetractys means little if one considers that the tesseract. or hypercube, was not known of then. So. suffice it to say. just as the points of the tetractys can be arranged in differing relative positions to one another, so. too. do the positions of the seven ancient planets change relative to the 12 signs of the ecliptic over time.Now, the order of occurrence of the 22 will differ over time in reflection below of the patterns formed between the fixed and moveable heavens above. At each time these are duly recorded (such as at the nativity of a person), a work befitting their arrangement may be noted (a horoscope), and of these there are many. So many, and so daunting would be the task of collecting them all and interpolating the relative orbital positions during the remainder of time, that we may choose to disregard all of this in favor of establishing only as upon archetypal levels the components involved.As I have illustrated, the components of the 22 Tarot trumps are the same as the attributes of the Hebrew aleph-bet, however their right order is relative to the unwound list of the positions of the planets and the zodiac, which change over time.If. even, there were a right understanding of the Tarot’s order to be had. they would immediately lose their entire use as divinatory. save, perhaps, for the exoteric vaguery of their pictorial symbolism. So, the only manner by which to properly order the trumps, it would seem, is by group or archetype, as in Baldini-Mantegna, rather than by alephbctical order, as in the Ari and Gra.Now, we have established that the first three are Coptic (Egypto Hebraic) in origin, and I have demonstrated the manner in which they ought to be ascribed to the spiritual alchemical elements. The only remainder from these are the planetary and zodiacal, which we have noted change over time and therefore must be. like the first three, ordered archetypically. So. we must decide, in essence, whether to place the remaining trumps in order least to greatest as ascending outwards from earth (or rather, from Sol) through the planets to the primum mobile, or descending inward from the Most High.Now, again, there are various theories on this matter. Of note on the one hand are writings of the Persian Zoroaster, which assure us that the Royal Road (“tar” meaning “road” and “ro” meaning “royal.” Hall. 410) proceeds outward from the center, through the seven spheres toward the primum mobile (cf. the Discourse on the Eight and Ninth). On the other hand is Hebrew ha qabala which equally eloquently assures us that we must follow the path that descends from the universal forces to reunite the Elohim with the Shekina. Of course. Buddhism adds lo (his the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"perspective of the Noble, eight fold. Middle Path which oscillates between these, explaining (he Hindu obsession with time. The great tradition of qabala assures us such combination is correct, and encourages as its detritus all evidence to this effect in the form of the aforementioned temporary artifacts (charts round and square).By doing so there has been formed a decisive split between archetypical mystic or esoteric ha qabala. which remains an oral tradition exclusive to the initiated, and temporal, terrestrial or exoteric qabala the type to which all published and dispersed doctrine belongs. In every way the prior type is honest, frank and open, the latter type is allegorical, obtuse and veiled.So, if we decide the ascending or descending archetypical order of the trumps, we must needs confront, be conversant in, and correlate them to, the modern mystical movement, of which the most outstanding example is the Masonic Lodge. As has been proved by many Masonic scholars, the blue lodge degrees, the first three of initiation, common to both northern and southern British Masonry, reflect the Osiriac mythos of Egypt, and therefore we shall treat them as they are thus, representative of the alchemical or spiritual elements. Now, between the northern (Scotch) and southern (Yorke) Masonry the number of following degrees differs.Of the Yorke rite, seven degrees follow, and of the Scotch rite, thirty. However within the modern Scotch rite, not all of these degrees are subsequently worked — many being passed over and conferred honorarily. Also, in the Yorke rite, two of these degrees are conferred honorarily and not commonly worked. It should be made clear to those not already familiar with these twin branches of Masonry that the blue lodge, or craft, degrees are meant to be included in the Scotch rite, but are essentially unnecessary to that of the Yorke. Thus the 33 degrees of the Scotch rite symbolise the 33 vertebrae of the human spine, while the seven degrees of the Yorke rite symbolise the chakra nerve gangliae.So. if we are to examine the right proper archetypical order of the remaining Tarot trumps, we must needs consider the working degrees of the Scotch rite, of which there are fourteen and the craft degrees, and compare these with the working degrees of the Yorke rite, of which there are five. The combination of these working degrees between the two branches totals 22, however we have already dealt with the significance to Tarot of the blue lodge or craft degrees.Now, to go further we must see that 5 * 7. nor does 14 - 12. Thus we would seem to be at an impasse whereby even the modern mystery schools treats of only a temporary possible archetypical order. Thus, to pass this, we must understand the mythology of Masonry-, which, for now. is too complex to go into here. We shall suffice it to examine the modern Masonic symbols of the square and compass.Now, the square and compass represent measures, and so the degrees of the riles may be placed upon them as though it were they which were to be compared. Here we see that on the square there are seven worked degrees inclusive, where Past and Mark Master are worked as one. or where Royal and Select Master are conferred honorarily and Super Excellent Master worked, as in Council. So. on the compass, twelve degrees are worked, excluding the 31st through 33rd degree as being conferred honorarily upon and inclusive with the Order of Templars.So, we have the twelve points of the compass above, and the seven points of the square below. Now. all that remains is lo ascertain in relation to these the right proper orientation of the spiritual or alchemical elements represented by the blue."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"craft or Egyptian degrees. As pait of the mythology of Masonry, as well as the initiatory' body, these blue degrees occur first, or at the boltom, of the structural hierarchy.At the top appears the All-Seeing Eye. representative of the transformation of the alchemical or spiritual elements — in the form of the initiate their self — from the rough to the perfect ashlar. Thus, the blue degrees occur at the joint of the square, while the All-Seeing Eye. awakened to by the three Templar degrees, occurs at the apex of the compass.So, we can now see that the three elements should occur before the seven planets, and that the seven planets should occur before the twelve fixed houses of the zodiac, and that only from this order will follow the right transformation from their base to their acid sense the spiritual, alchemical elements.C. The Internal Ordering of the Major Trumps IndividualEliphas Levi may have designed the prototype Kider-Wailc deck based on the Mantcgna-Baldini symbolism of Arabic Trappola and Mamluk, but by the turn of the twentieth century Levi may have understood these cards’ origins to be in India (or even China) rather than Egypt <IPCS, 2). From what we have seen of Masonry, which derives its modern rituals more or less directly from the Knights Templar, who likely brought Arabic Trappola back with them from the Crusades, perhaps they were correct.So, now that we have treated of the order of spiritual or alchemical elements, planets of the movable spheres and signs of the fixed houses inclusive, let us approach the matter of each of their internal orders individually. We may begin with the spiritual,alchemical elements.Now. in alchemy, it is salt which is the basis for the transformative work, while either sulphur or mercury' is the active agent, yielding its opposite. In one source, the Bembine Isis table, we see mercury enthroned upon salt, surmounted by a cloud of sulphur, indicating the Great Work complete: while in another, the Pythagorean theorem as applied lo alchemy, elements and species by the fraternity of the Rose Croix, we find another order, with salt below, mercury above, and sulphur in between them as a measure. Therefore we must needs return to the ha qabalistic elements and mythos of the Egyptian dignities to elaborate upon these roles. Here we see that salt is Isis and water, that sulphur is Osiris or fire, and that it is mercury.Thoth. that is the breath of air that decides between them — that is. which is the active element transforming the one into the other. Now. the only question is. what order they begin and end with, since we may place mercury. Thoth, in the middle. In the existing Kider-Waitc deck allusions between the first three trumps and these dignities is so obvious as to go without saying — despite mr. Waite’s repeated denials of the Tarot’s Egyptian antiquity. However, they remain enough for us to lay them down as a foundation for now, and more shall be explained of their mystery in good time.So. next we come to the order amongst the planetary spheres of the primum mobile. Now, as I mentioned earlier, these have further correspondences to be taken into account when considering their right order.The seven planetary spheres were associated by the Greeks, after the astronomy of Pythagoras, with their understanding of the seven lower emanations of ha qabala of the Hebrews, however these schools differed, as I have explained, as between"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"whether the Royal Road ascended from earth or descended to reunion with the Shekinah.The alchemists further attributed metals to these planetary spheres, which in and of itself is of little benefit in determining their proper order, however the Roslcrucians, by now conversant in Oriental doctrine, assigned these alchemical metals to the same gangliae or plexi of nerves to which the ancient Hindus had assigned the seven chakras. Of course, there are different schools of Buddhist tantra yoga which philosophise regarding the ascent of what Hindi call Kundalini or what the Chinese call the ( hi. In foreshadowing of late Renaissance heliocenirism’s revival, the Sephardic reformed order opts to place the sun in the center, and one would be tempted to follow suit and simply assign the planets in order their orbits actually do occur, however doing so upsets their order of correspondence to the chakras. Nor does Revelation offer any solution by its allegory of the churches, for they are in agreement with the Greeks, and neither does Theosophy, which suggests the further attribution of root races. Therefore I shall return to this dilemma momentarily.Now we may address the positions of the so-called fixed or immobile zodiac, which should present the least difficulty seeing as how all of its signs occur in a single, natural order not only at all times in the heavens above, but, moreover, in all literature on the subject in writings below.However, as almost any astronomically educated soul can tell you these days, the so- called fixed or immobile zodiac is. at least relative to earth, quite mobile over long periods of time. Just as the moon seems to move through the houses of the zodiac over the course of a year, due to its orbit combined with (hat of our own earth, so too does the sun rise and set in a new constellation every other millennium, and this is due to a peculiar and very slow “wobble\" in the rotation of our earth combined with its orbit around the sun. This \"wobble,\" known by its effect as precession, is due to the earth’s 23.S degree angle inclination from perfect perpendicularity to its orbital plane, causing the polar axis to gradually precess, or “wobble.” around in a circle the ideal polar axis of perfect perpendicularity. The result of this is that, over the tens of thousands of years, the earth will be tilted more towards or away from the sun per hemisphere in the same position in ils orbit as was previously the opposite condition.In other words, every 24,OCX) years it will be in summer in the north and winter in the south when the sun is rising in the same constellation as it did when, 24,000 years v %чг S ago, and will again, 24,000 years hence, be»'.•« JI.641 *)Therefore, the fixed zodiac, which should be the easiest to order amongst itself, is actually impossible to fix archetypically to the seasons of the mean year. Though this effect is easily overlooked by the modern mind, accustomed to daylight savings time and leap years, it actually results in two problems: 1) if we fix the start and finish of the zodiac at an arbitrary point in its mobile history, then 2) we belie the entire grandwinter in the north and summer in the south._r ««г.ьчг. ^I,»” Л г.г-мгЛ->\" Jvi.SM»<Smechanism of precession itself. Again, allow me to return to this."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"So, while we were able to find a relative cipher for the placement of the Major Arcana groups elements, planets and signs of the zodiac relative to one another, finding ways to properly arrange these internally individually from one another, and may require either several different relative ciphers or one grand cipher unifying them all.It is possible that the current ordering of the Trumps in themselves is less important than the order of the Trumps as individually and apart from the lesser arcana. If we accept the primary format of the Tarot in its current form, as a card deck, then perhaps we must also admit the lesson of this media is its potential for recombinations. Perhaps the purpose of Tarot IS to shuffle it? Therefore, we cannot hold aside the Major Trumps as exclusive from the rest of the deck, the minor arcana.And, since we are dealing with a system based not only on a set of Trumps, four numbered suits of ten, and a ten-card court, but an inclusive system of 36 day and night dekans, a complete deck totaling 72, then we should not restrict ourselves away from being open lo that larger network, rather than confined only in the smaller patterns. Should we- venture further and apply the 64 hexagrams and S doubles of the I Ching we will further unlock the mysteries of the Satvas, Tatvas, chakras and the Yugas of Hinduism.D. the Order of the 72 Card Deck InclusiveThe matter of constructing an inclusive symbolic Tarot becomes even more difficult upon examination of the Egyptian hieroglyphic characters which would be involved. There are 36 standard dekans, that divide roundly into the 12 houses, however there is also a 37th governing the five days between the synodic and solar calendars, which would possibly stand for the suit of trumps if the associated mystery rituals would allow. There are 7 moveable planetary spheres in all other ancient cosmologies, but only 5 in the Egyptian, the sun having its own mysteries of Aten at Heliopolis, and the moon being roughly synonymous with the dog star, the deceased sun god. and with Amen, the hidden God. in general. So. with the Egyptian system, come additional complications lo both ihe planetary and zodiacal systems, though it provides simplicity to the elemental.The gates of the Necronomicon are assigned lo the seven planets, but the fifty names of Marduk. while arranged in an order in the Necronomicon, are not clearly in any specifically systematised pattern, such as would answer to rank and file, or offer a clear beginning and end point. Hence their attribution to the fifty lesser arcana could only be hesitantly attributed rather than directly ascertained. Also, another base SO system, the Gates of Binah. offers a complementarity with the seven planetary gates and ihe SO names, however, while offering a beginning and end, as well as specifically fixed order, does not offer any further insight into the placement of the SO names.Further, the aforementioned hexagrams (including doubles) of the 1 Ching can be numerologically fit with the complete deck, and offer specific seasonal effective attributes, however, fixing these to the signs of the 72 day and night dekans is relatively impossible, at least arbitrary', given the factor on the dekans of precession and thus the change in relative seasonal effect for the fixed heavenly positions.So, the 72 day and night dekan system is correspondent with several other lesser base number systems from around the world. Some of these are intuitive, such as the 50 Babylonian names of Marduk. which was later adopted as the Necronomicon. and the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"22 letters of the Hebrew alephbet and iheir corresponding elemental, planetary' and zodiacal correspondences, and the history of these has been duly accounted. Others, however, are more counterintuitive, yet nonetheless inclusive, sucli as the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching. and no direct historical lineage can be drawn between these counterintuitive systems at this point.The problems thus far encountered have arisen from the internal ordering within the 22 Major Arcana, as well as the exact attributive placement of the goetic sigils of the base-72 shemhamforash and the 50 names of Marduk; in other words, the exact ordering of the three basic components of the deck. Therefore we do not lack an ordering of the complete deck inclusive, but only the interior ordering of its 22, 50 and sum 72 components.So. it would seem next to completely impossible to assign a genuinely archetypical order to the leaves, and it would seem at first, rather obvious why such an attempt has not yet known to have been undertaken, in favor of merely temporal attributes.This has not been for lack of trying, but merely due to, if anything, the rigid adherence by those following Gebelin to attribute a meaning adherent to the mystic traditions of the utmost ancient of middle eastern, that being the Egyptian. Following from this comes the QBLIlistical interpretation offered by the correspondence of the Hebrew alephbet to the “ideal\" number of trump cards, wherein the twenty two letters are summarily subdivided into glottals, gutturals, and palatials, which then “mystically\" refer to the 12 signs of the zodiac, the seven (anciently known) planets, and three elements (other than earth). So, one may realise how uniquely arbitrary this line of reasoning appeal's to be, on the face of it, should one wish to syncopate other number based systems to the cards.One may discount Gebelin as a Jacobin, wishing to introduce the specific tradition of occult, “authentic” Hebrew mysticism to the mere revelry' of playing cards. One is apollonian. the other dionysian. This being thus, however, no amount of justifications need be made for Gebelin’s identification of Tarot per se as Egyptian in origin. Decks of playing cards may date back at least as far as the invention of paper in China, or possibly even further back to the Phoenician codification of an alphabetical cypher based on sound, or originally to the fixation of our most primitive ancestors with fetishes for memory’s sake, ala burial. And finally, the ait of playing card games is irrevocably comparable to using a token exchange economy system, ergo the leafs in themselves, to codify with rules the act of trading these fetish items with one another. Perhaps Gebelin saw the Egyptian origin idea as being especially romantic, seeing that the Egyptians rebelled against this method the only- real way they knew how, by shifting the focus of their culture away from free trade and into religious empire, or perhaps it was originally the Hebrews who saw il that way.Several arguments can be made why these attributions in this order are relevant to the overall unfolding of the history of the tarot du jour. However, unlike the Egyptians, to whom the cards are thought to harken back, these arguments are only retroactive justifications fora modern cultural bias. Even this bias dare not be questioned, so engrained is it within our exoteric version of our own history. This bias basically states that, from the Egyptians came the Hebrews, and from Tarot follows the Yetziratic interpretation. However, it is, more occluded, a bias to justify the modern obsessive compulsive pathology of our socio culture with token fetishes. It is a bias which connotes the minting of money, and the counting of its worth."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Perhaps it is essentially true that this practise, which we have tome to call Civilisation, did indeed start simultaneously though autonomously in three geographic locations — the Tigris-Euphrates, Indus and Nile river valleys. However, the very fact that the use of number based systems arose among the different peoples of these regions at all is implication enough of an older, common point of origin.While we cannot speculate here on where, we can comment upon the commonalities inherent in these number-based systems themselves.E. Alternative Attributions and Numerical SystemsA proposal for an alternatively numerated deck should be approached tentatively, if at all, however such is necessary for the formation of a truly Archetypal deck.In all seriousness, the alteration of the 76 card deck inclusive in anyway should not be undertaken lightly. The implication upon the majour trumps alone of the alephbet of the Torah is enough to daunt the average aspirant from changing anything about the meaning of the cards one jot or tittle, leading lo their regurgitation ad nauseum.All the more so dangerous is the twisting of the ecliptic, and the alteration within the majour arcana of two card placements, and hence their requisite modern Hebrew letter correspondences, and hence their “occult” significance. However such was successfully attempted by the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley in the early twentieth century, meeting with exceptionally favourable responses from their memelically reproducing underlings. But (his motion barely scratches the surface of (he full amounl of his(orical revisionism it takes lo reduce (he number of playing cards in a standard deck.As we have seen, the differing comparable numerical sets involved in the formation of an archetypal tarot are usually attributed specific meanings. We have encountered difficulty in attributing specific numerical orders to these meanings. For example, the 36 of the 72 are the same as one-third portions of 12 of the 22. There is plenty of implicit order in such relationships but no standard numerical order. Therefore, it would seem plausible (hat, (o impose any standard numerical order (o a lesser portion of (he set would be (o make reference to the order of the whole set, such (ha( (he larger reflects ihe smaller and vice versa. To imply order within the three trumps, is to imply order in (he seven and (he twelve trumps, the thirty six of the fifty, (he fifty of the seventy two and the seventy two themselves. Thus, to alter the numerical ordering of the cards implies to alter their numerical relationships, and this implies to alter their meaning.This seems a drastic measure, but should be duly noted, is also wha( separa(es playing cards from o(her forms of ruled game. They may be shuffled, and ihe only irue meaning they have, if any. may then be imputed by their randomised arrangement. Each hand dealt is like a new move at chess. However, while chess progresses move by move, the hand one plays is often very different from that at the beginning of the round. Picture chess as like the pieces on the board, while cards are like the squares themselves. Each square has its dual nature, black or white, front, back. While the pieces are extensions of the players, the card deck is the tyling board on which they, via these pieces, play. lastly, the players can only move the pieces according (o the rules, while the rules dictate lha( the cards must be shuffled utterly al random.

And such is implied by our mandate to create an archetypal tarot.i. г к u 1If, by means of an example, we were to assemble the fifty attributes as a grid of ten by five, then there would be a total of thirty six squares formed between these points of intersection. If, then, alternating black and white spaces were reversed, as cards turning over from front ю back, then there would be another combination of thirty six. which would bring the total number of possible square positions tallied by the fifty points of intersection up to the familiar seventy two. In this way can be illustrated how the lesser arcana can be used to reproduce the entire deck set. The fact that this type of framework, comprised of points of intersection and alternating squares bears some resemblance to the Egyptian board game of Senet, of which copies have also been found in contemporary Babylon, and which is arguably the oldest existing form of recreational pastime, is only as worth mentioning as would be the similarity of the words Senet and Senate. This is an example of one of the numerical relationships mentioned before that yet does not admit any specific numerical ordering. Hence it is archetypal.In other words, to alter any of its components would not alter its overall given form.LI1г (\\ЪiЪ■A4445s5b*4i41'11t%%в<*яVOгV»\\o1It may be possible to see somewhat already that the early ways of communicating between nomadic tribal herd-hunters, before even the beginning of what is recognised as “civilisation.” were wampum or traded fetish objects. This, we can further speculate, led to more terminal ports for communication of varying complexity. Accounting became possible, and so numbers were discovered, and, eventually, gained dominance in almost all forms of socio cultural cross- germination. Numerical systems sprung up, possibly autonomously, nonetheless suddenly, and began to become codified. Here we have ihe base 36 of the Egyptian solar calendar, the base 50 Sumerian lunar, and the Hebrew doubling of the Egyptian solar to 72 (to. essentially, substitute until the lunar 64 Chinese I Ching). This is contemporary to great feats such as the erection of the pyramids, the migration of the Indo-European Aryans, the writings of Enoch and the Hermetica, etc. By the time of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Spanish Septamania, and the Gypsies being the predominant keepers of the esoteric, archetypal, secret understanding of the number systems, the tarot came lo be codified, probably by Rosicrucians, as a form of wampum for the lumpen workers of speculative masonry. First there were leaves, then numbers were uncovered beneath them; ihe number systems simulated sheafs of mediated value until, eventually, the number systems became chaotic, though the basic systemology behind them remains the same. The pieces trade places like the players' hands trade money, bills and cards hold the number placement, which brings us roughly level up to today. So, we can then see, also, tarot’s ancient origins as well as the necessity of its interpretation for ihe future.Just as the role of the numbered cards of the modern deck represent the value system of the craftspeople, so too do the court cards symbolise, on the face of it, those for whom they loyally toil. and. hidden in their duplicity, the four step tetractys cipher that unlocks the mysterious chains surrounding the Great Work. Likewise, the trumps majour clearly represent time, having all been derived in their base number systems from calendars, and so being numerically interpretable astrologically, and"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"having all been derived in their symbolism from ihe natural sciences, and so being symbolically interpretable alchemically. metaphysically, and. ultimately, archetypally. All of this is more or less common knowledge among goal-directed history and number theory researchers. The next question we must ask is. is the entire system gencralisable archetypally? More than being only 22 symbolic and numerical, perhaps the remaining court and numbered suit cards can also be represented as being both numerically orderable and meaningful archetypally. This would be historically significant both because it would harken back to the original numerical systems, and because ours would be the first generation of our species to see these lesser arcana archetypally.We have already seen the flaws in the method of arranging the greater trumps based on the seven planets and the twelve zodiac houses. We have also seen how different numerical systems, when their components remain random, are as equally verifiable as the components of the trumps majour, when (heir positions relative to one another are alterable, though finitely. We have seen how the cards have evolved, and Where they fit in today. We have seen that, by making a minor alteration to the number system behind the arbitrary order of the cards, we can addend a whole new set of meanings to their relationships which, themselves, may convey the modern condition, if nothing else, of the ancient archetypes originally associated with these number systems. Therefore, we may consider other mythological f rameworks in which to analyse the archetypes involved in (his symbolically broader bu( more numerically refined mc(hod.F.

This is really the true meaning behind (he tarot being ascribed initially to Thoth, the Egyptian deity of lunar mcasurcmcn( of time. For it is only (he mcasurcrnem of time and the archetype of time itself of which tarot treats. So, we begin with the numerical calendrical system, and next address the correspondent mythological archetypes.We have seen (hat the base 72 system of shemhamforash, or the doubling of the 36 Egyptian dekans day and night, equally admits the base 50 names of Marduk system to compliment the base 22 system of the Hebrew alephbet. We have seen the standard 22 alephbet is broken up into the 3 elements, 7 planets and 12 houses.So, let us briefly examine the correspondent mythologies involved in these numerical building blocks.The base 72 system is considered goetic. ergo, associated with witchcraft. However, it does not originally derive from (his. I(s goetic attributes were not rightly assigned until the 16th century or so. with the first known circulation of a parchment codex"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"called “the lesser key of Solomon.” Before this, and from whence this goetic corpus stems, there was the proper shemhamforash. such as studied by Athenias Kircher and Francis Barett. The proper shemhamforash is actually drawn from three phrases in Exodus of 72 letters each. The 216 letters are taken to form 72 lettered columns of three rows each consisting one each of the phrases. Through common tradition, epithets are then attached lo each three letter row, forming 72 “angelic\" names.These 72 “angels,\" derived from this order, were only later attributed chaotic demons.The base 72 system of the shemhamforash derived from the doubling of the 36 Egyptian dekans. Only the Egyptian priests read, wrote and spoke the true Hyksos language, while their slaves wrote coptic script and spoke hieratic. This is reflected by the 72 being hidden in Exodus as the phrases describing Moses’ parting of the Red Sea. So. too. were the mysteries of the original, lunar Egyptian calendar obscured by the initiation, with the Middle Kingdom, of the solar Egyptian civil calendar. The sum of days of the solar civic calendar was 365, the same as that in an orbit of earth around the sun. However, the derivation of this sum was based entirely upon astronomical cartography which could only be arrived at by night. The system of dekans was. itself, based on ten degree divisions of the twelve houses of the zodiac. Only later, during the New Kingdom, were the five holidays added to correct the increasing discrepancy between the Egyptian calendar and the actual seasons of earth’s annual orbit.However, the original base 1 2 zodiacal houses were, as we have already seen, as arbitrary a distinction as were the seven anciently known planets or the three elements. The base ten system of QBLH, with 22 paths between the tetractys, may have originally predated the 12 mansions of the ecliptic, the seven known heavenly spheres, and the elemental system derived from the Egyptian mythology of Osiris.The base 10 QBLH, itself, may have been a shorthand notation of the 50 names of Marduk. which were, in turn, a suppression of the originally lunar Sumerian calendar.All of this describes, as it unfolds, the demonising of the different systems, each in its place in history, by the subsequent cipher of their component’s description. So, when we talk in modern times about one of the 72 Goetic demons of the “lesser key,” what we are really harkening back to are the 36 dekans embodying the 12 mansions depicting the ten sefirot attributing the “leaders” of the 5’s and the 10’s. Of course, going back before this we uncover only a continuation of this such “perennial” tradition of demonisation of the preceding system by its followers deriving from the Indus Aryans, and from thence, branching off into the entire Eastern tradition of the base 7 chakras, base 64 i ching, etc. However, for the time being it merely suffices our purpose to deal with that which followed from the Sumerian.So. let us begin by setting out the proposal for a complete base 72 cipher for the deck. This accounts for the mythological junction point broken between the Hebrew and the Egyptian. From this we follow with the division between the 50 parts and the 22 parts, representing the mythology of the breaking apart from the Babylonians of the Akkadians, who would later become the Hyksos, and later become the Hebrews. So, we may set up our deck according not to the remaining sets in use after these breaking points, but the fractured elder systems themselves, being what they would become.Rather, thus, than deal with the 7. and 12 as being planetary and zodiacal, we may deal with them as being the equivalencies of these which follow from the downfall of these attributes (hence specified as the Tree of Death). So. we next consider the 22 set itself as having broken down from the set of ten. as the connections between the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"sefirot tetractys. rather than by part, but as a whole (hence specified as the QJiphoth sui generis). Likewise, we may then consider the ten sefirot tetractys themselves as being the traits of the ten numbered cards (demon kings), in five suits inclusive (based on the five accursed nations) representing the \"fall\" from front to back of the10 attributes below the three veils of the two trees, the three veils over the tree of life (tree of knowledge) covering over those of the tree of death (tree of life). And so, by parts, we come to the whole lot of the seventy two card inclusive deck. W'e shall call this arrangement, for short, the St. Simon arrangement.So, to draw up the St. Simon deck, we merely add all these attributes together: the 7 shells and 12 paths of the tree of death, crowned by its 3 veils, the 10 sefirot tetractys of the demon kings, and the 22 qliphoth sui generis connecting them, as well as the 3 veils shrouding them, the ten orders of demons of the numbered cards, and the five accursed nations of the suits - the 72 inclusive attributes of the deck.Now. the meanings themselves can all be cross-referenced as sum sets between the different components of archetypal attributes of the 72 total set. For example, the 50 can be derived from the placement upon the combined tree of life and tree of death diagrams as such: the 7 shells, the 10 emanations, and the 33 paths which combine between them. Or, equally valid, the 50 can be derived from the four suits of nine numbered cards each (36 total) being combined with the base 10 tetractys forming five suits, signified by 4 aces (the fifth being part of the four court tetractys), or 4 *9 - 36 + 10 + 4 - 50. So, then the 50 may also be represented as the 10 demon kings of the tetractys over their 10 orders of the tree of knowledge, the 7 shells and 12 paths of the tree of death, the 3 veils over each, and the 5 nation suits - 50. So. too. can the 22 majour arcana be represented either as the qliphoth sui generis paths between the tetractys. or as the 3 veils, 7 shells and 12 paths of the tree of death. Add to the 50 the 22 and the 72 sum deck is completed.All of these combinations are numerical sum sets, or number systems, based upon characteristic attributes of archetypes. So we see that it is indeed possible to construct a truly “archetypal” tarot. Now, the actual mythology of the St. Simon attributes has already been presented in a rough enough form to be comprehended.All that remains is a justification for why these attributes might be applicable to a system based, supposedly, in origin on the Book of Thoth.Well, then, let us return lo the 72 shemhamforash as Ihe basis of Ihe deck. The base 72 shemhamforash, as already established, derives from the 36 Egyptian dekans, which in turn derive from the 12 Sumerian houses of the ecliptic. Now, since all of these are methods by which to measure time, and Thoth is the archetypal personification thereof, then there should be little question that the 72 deck inclusive is appropriate. The division between the 22 letter alephbet and the 50 fallen names of Marduk is Hebrew, a description of the fall of the rebel angels, according to Enoch. Now, since Enoch is associative of Thoih, we see lhat the division between the 22 and 50 is aright. Hence, the attributions to the 22, the 50 and the 72 are arbitrary. However, for the sake of the St. Simon's purpose, it is possible to attribute the ancient Gods of the Sumerians, and then utili.se the number systems of Time to describe their history, from their enthronement, through to their total demonisation. It may then be extrapolated that these Gods are but one God. and that Thoth is this god over time. In other words, the attributes of the St. Simon actually describe the life of Time.G. Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The creation of a truly “archetypal” tarot is a significant factor of the “perennial\" tradition, that multigenerational life-qucst to understand that which is. The so-called Hook of Thoih is really a calendar, created by an elder God, conveyed down through the millennia, altered many times over, and at each alteration further vilified and kept occluded behind misinterpretations of the original meanings. But it is a calendar nonetheless.Consider that twice 72 is four times 12, or 144. Now, twelve itself is an arbitrary estimation, a vague means of representing the 360 degrees of the ecliptic. However, if we begin to count in intervals of 12. we come across 36. 72 and 144. 1S6 is actually twelve by thirteen. ЛИ of this may seem ridiculously arbitrary at first, however it should be remembered that a calendar is the body of Thoth. Therefore the tarot is like the spine of that calendar.The myth of Thoth is such that, to convey the antiquity of it, a god of time is featured in all western pantheistic cosmologies. This includes, though inexplicably, the American as well as the Mediterranean. In all of these mythologies, the god of time overthrows the primeval god of chaos. So. Thoth. or the representation of time, can be thought of, at the very latest, its an immediately antediluvian figure. It is nonetheless likely that the plotting of a number sequence to signify the passage of time was begun sometime contemporary lo the neolithic erection of megaliths.Should the use of megaliths as calendars, or means of measuring time, be associated with the deification of time itself, then we can sufficiently posit this character as not only global in extent, but ancient in the extreme.In fact, if we see Tarot as the spine of the Book that represents the body of time, then the implied Atlantean Calendar extrapolable from the Tarot is no less than the DNA of Thoth. drawn from the passing blood of that God. To sum up. with Tarot we are capable of describing precession due to earth’s movement, and with the Atlantean Calendar, we are capable of describing the universe beyond our relative apparent precession.IV. on rituals of evocationThroughout history since the dark ages the unknown has been vilified, from the gnomes of the Black Forrest and the trolls under bridges, through the boogeyman of Satan and Choronzon of the abyss, to UFOs developed by NAZIs and fellow-traveller aliens. Before the dark ages, of course, this was the case as well, however before the dark ages governed by religious superstition, science was much more accepted, and so the villains were ignorance and indifference, and, again, there was much less reliance upon material technology, so these were villains opposed only to the intellectual ideal.Even as long ago as ancient Sumeria. before the Biblical Babylon, the love of non- technological science was strong. So the Annunage were a combination of the unknown and of an intellectual ideal. Then, there was much known about the workings of the heavens, so the unknown was merely the cause of these workings.This remained the unknown throughout the rest of subsequent history, but since the time of Abraham this unknown went from being vilified to being deified, and the concept of God as first cause was used to frustrate any search for a more rational solution. This is. in fact, what led to the dark ages, when the pursuit of knowledge was directly equated with consorting with demons, and this direct result of divine intervention is so obvious that in modern times it goes too often without saying.The religion based on this god thrives on the ignorance and indifference of its masses, and so it forces into vilification as merely superstitious — an accusation of its"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"own worst crime — those who pursue the natural empowerment of the self that comes from a merely rational existence. With the conscripted help of a state institution promised idealisation through totalitarianism, the religion based on this god enforces this false faith in a vast myriad of ways. This only increases the strife between all mankind. We become puppets of an insane idea a genocidal benevolence, an omnipotence that toys with our destinies a destructive creator, monkey god.Only now. through technological ways and means, have we removed ourselves enough from under this oppression to heed the still-small voice, calling to us from before Babylon, admonishing us for forsaking what it did not know and which yet was true, and thusly coming to embody its divine villains.Have we really believed throughout all the intervening ages that by worshipping as divine the unknown it will make itself more easily understood? Such superstition dictates that when we take one step towards god he takes two towards us. Is this the same as blind prayer? When we look deep into the void it looks deeper into us. Is this knowing the self? Is it not sickness we have believed is ecstasy? Are the deals we make with the divine not broken as often by Him as by us? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. Must we trust to the unconscious what with we trust not even our consciousness?I will return to such philosophical questions soon enough, but first let me review the different appendages to the history of the Annunage that have attached themselves as theories regarding their origins, and thusly. I will go further to say. regarding our own origins.The ones 1 have been referring to as the Annunage were, as I have said, the “gods” of ancient Sumeria. Their name translates roughly as “the Watchers,\" and so we see already that there was a different view of the divine than has since become the mandatory belief in the efficacy of devout petition. In Sumeria the priest-kings were seen not as vessels through whom the people communicated with, or took orders from, their deities, but as direct descendants in their authority from these deities. We are told by archaeologists and anthropologists that such was also the case with the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, but that, while the Sumerian civilisation passed rapidly into the hands of Babylonian culture, the Egyptian civilisation existed continuously with little interruption until Roman times, and so we have a litmus in them for measuring the gradual transition through the history of the organ of government of the priest-kings as direct descendants of the Gods towards more of merely a tool for their continual communion with the populace they ruled by proxy.We can see this transition in the apocryphal works of the bible such as. specifically, the Book of the patriarch Enoch. In the scrolls of this work discovered in Qumran cave 4 near the Dead Sea. the Annunage of the Sumcrians still play a prominent role, however already by this time they have been seen to be degraded from the status of the national pantheon to a band of rebel angels who defied the One True deity, YHVH. This prosaic description was the precursor to the legends of Lucifer promulgated by the early organised Christian church since the time of Constantine. Lucifer was known of as Shalom and Shalem. after whom his town. Jerusalem, was named, at the time of Christ, and represented then the Morning and Evening star we know today to be the planet Venus. This originally benign attribute was associated with the fiery serpent of Christ’s revelation in the desert outside Galilee by the early church fathers, and thusly came to represent the lesser light of the false dawn and the precursor and harbinger of darkness. That which came to be known of as the Anti- Christ was all the legacy that remained by that time of the once holy assembly of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ancient Sumerlans.Since the beginning of Ihe dark ages of the church, ihis malevolent false prophet Ihe Anti-Christ, which hailed (he beginning of (he apocalypse foretold at Palmos in which (he beast, subsequently interpreted by Mani as the- physical incarnation of the Anti God, Satan, would reign supreme* in Hell on Earth until the time of the second coming of Christ, has reigned supreme as the representative of all heterodoxy and heretical beliefs beside the bigoted religion based on the Nlcean Creed. During the dark ages, this meant the persecution of all Orthodox Christians, Muslims. Jews, Pagan Celts, Gaelic Gauls, alchemists practising chemistry, astrologers practising astronomy, mathematicians practising magic, science of ANY kind, and in addition to (his the existing bloodline of Jesus themselves. The church came (o enforce the novel notion of its priests as the sole divine conduit to heaven and salvation after death, working only through devious and sinister mechanisations with the royal bloodline monarchies it could appoint or manipulate, who represented the lesser evil than anarchy of politics and the unfortunate necessity of non-religious government. All these ages the Son of Cod ruled through force, pogroms, crusades, inquisitions and conquests, while the unknown divine ideal was vilified as demonically deformed and incarnately disfigured ignorance and indifference, and the pursuit of its rectification was persecuted as heretical superstition. The Annunage of old, and all pagan pantheons along with them, were evil, born lo be oppressed and preying only on the weak in (he form of temptation away from the straight and narrow path of righteousness. Such were the dark ages, and we would all do well to remember so.It has only been as recently as with Pope John Paul II that the orthodox religion of the One God and His Son the True Christ has seen fit to pardon Galileo Gallilei for his so-called sin of accepting the Copernican model of a heliocentric solar system and for giving into (he demonic temptation of agreeing with Isaac Newton's elliptical model of planetary orbits, based, as they were on (he crime of observations made using black magical means such as (he technology of the telescope. Here we again harken back to the revelations of the prophet Enoch, excluded from the canonical Bible by both Christians and Jews alike, in spite of having been accepted and studied by Hebrew Essenes at the time of Jesus, wherein, through the Intervention of angels on whose behalf Enoch pleads before the throne of the Almighty God. Enoch is shown visions which confirmed aeons before the supposed invention of the telescope observations which were directly in line with those made therewith.Since the telescope scientific technology of all kinds has finally made it possible to study (he heavens so well known to the ancient pre Babylonians, and through the rigorous methodologies of archaeology and anthropology for the historical evidence thereof to be unearthed from the subsequent detritus of history and once again brought to the bare light of reason. However, superstition such as was enforced by the oppressive religious establishment for all those intervening aeons is a hard habit to break, especially when such self-destructive patterns were rewarded by the same with the promises of indulgence after a much to be sought after death in its service.And so (hat brings us, of course, to the modern quandary of the self alienating combination of superstitious suspicion of all modern archaeological artifacts, and the ardent desire for a return to the passionate and unmediated communion with the divine intellectual ideal through its direct descent into the practises of reason. To this end, many of the arcane and oppressed arts pursued not for the sake of reason but fOr that of rebellion, are offering to the modern mind as much fascination as those being excavated from the Golden Age prior to (his in which the craft of study was cherished as sacred. This is a as much a criminal shame of retrograde religiosity and a relapse"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"to such sickness of the mind as it is a part of the process of recovery from the terrible abuse of the righteously self-centered humanism lhat had been previously suffered at the hands of those representing religion.As long as the practise of magic and belief in sorcery exist in place of pure scientific reason, religion will as well. These two forces are literally the institutionalised embodiment of the diametrical struggle between good and evil, between the humanist way of the self and of mankind and the deified way of the divine and of God. As long as there is sufficient superstition to support one of them, the other will exist as well as a necessary dichotomy. They are like ihe poles of electricity, and until a higher force is found (o fuel our powerful progress as a people, they will continue to allracl us to a lesser stalicity.Hence, when the factual documentation supporting the primacy of the Annunage was unearthed throughout its long early history, from the pantheon of Sumeria to the fallen angels of the Essenes, it immediately spawned a materialistically motivated appeal to the occluded occult currents and to those who were wooed by a higher calling but sought liberation of their own wills from ihe rigor mortis-like grip of ihe institutionalised church. In plain words, it presented itself as a petition to magick.This fallacious slander against ihe good once done by the holding of even an ideal as of yet unknown as divine, by forecasting its course as a base temptation, has proved itself to be a difficult one to overcome even through the subsequent application of the more rationally reasonable scientific method. As such, those who have continued to study the scientific endeavors of the Sumerians and the original basis for their understanding of the cause of their deistic view of ihe heavens as being the pantheon of the Annunage have been forced to continue this plaintiff stance in a vague and roundabout manner, and have been forced lo direct their arguments for a more sound basis of study not to the community of now socially accepted science and ihe respectability thereof, but to the fringes of society where always will dwell the stubbornly suspicious and superstitious, easily fooled into believing the most outlandish of fairy tales as long as it supports their own rebellious morals.Thus, we come to the postmodern era the superstitions of which I have already mentioned regarding alien interference with our naturally selective evolution at either some prehistoric stage for which no reasonable evidence can be found but must therefore be concocted, or else is ongoing and supported by the most deranged and unreliable of witnesses: as well as the belief that ancient pantheons were based on the technology which we subconsciously know of as. yet unconsciously dread the transition to that will all too soon become, necessary for our own survival.To this end, the direct thread of the Sumerian pantheon as fallen angels before the mighl of a falsely concluded ideal hallucination has been applied lo this very same pseudo-science and its fear of and lusl after the ultimately humanist technology provided by pure science as an artificial salvation. It’s most surprising how well the ancient mythologies have been, through such a convoluted bottleneck, adapted lo this modern deml-myth.So we have now followed briefly the history of the Annunage through their deism as a naturally causal pantheon of the pre-Babylonians, through their de-deification by the Essenes of Qumran in Ihe tradition of Ihe patriarch Enoch, ihrough also iheir subsequent dcmonisation by the orthodoxy of ihe oppressive religious regime which followed therefrom, through, again very cursorily, their rediscovery by sound and even minded science and their re acceptance by the fringe practitioners thereof as a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"conveniently explanatory force for the successful application of methodologies lost beyond (heir own understanding, to conclude in modern limes with iheir petition for evidentiary proof from the sciences by those sufferers of the sorrow of superstition. We see in this cycle that the tables have turned on the Annunage, but that, along the same concourse, they have almost come around full circle from being unseated to becoming re-enthroned as the same, once divine, intellectual ideal of the unknown.It should be unnecessary for the brevity of this exposition to more deeply explore than merely mention some of the modern theories regarding the a priori origins of (he Annunage. The fascination with Enoch initiated at (he dawning of the new world was carried through by somewhat less scrupulous seekers of a likewise new age into the forgery of the Necronomicon of Abdul A1 Ilrazed. which Vilified the same forces the prior mage had sought to restate as a hierarchical authority, and thus was retrograde, however popular, and therefore ensuring of additional assistance, yet of a strangely cut jib. Since that time, the Annunage have been attempted to be removed as much as possible from this retrograde notion, without, however, losing that assistance in their searching after offered by its own prolapsed popularity. To this end, the theories of Velikovsky have been combined with (he Enochian cycle, and (he Annunage have thusly been merged into the current of the same stream as (he modern technologically oriented mythology of UFOs and interplanetary aliens.As this mythology evolves along the spirallng cities of true physical science, and so however intermittently, approaches a higher form of relative quantum mechanics and an understanding of such mechanisms thereof as probability particles and wavelengths of potential energy, as well as their interchangeability, it comes again closer to (he level of reasoning of and understanding thereby possessed by the ancient Sumerians of the Golden Age, until, finally, the alienation of superstition along the outskirts of mainstream physics becomes so unified with the most high minded of its theories, that the followers thereof itself become as like one with that which they pursue, and at this stage, which is the most up to date of the current ideations, the initiated of the occult are associated directly with the royal Sumerian bloodlines of the ancient priest-kings. and the Annunage to which they thusly offer retrograde communion are perceived not only as interplanetary, but also as being a form of interdimensional possession in the most gross sense of understanding.So, now we come to (he threshold of (he ultimate reinstatement of the Annunage to their righ(ful place as an unknown intellectual ideal. Already they are accused of being part of the blood cells of those who are the most wealthy and who have the most social authority in our existing civilisations, and they are beginning to be associated with that mystery of mysteries presented by quantum relativism: the concept of the measurement not only of space, but through that measurement of space, an equal measurement of time itself.So, all this being said, let us examine the roots and basis of this contemporary theory', which we may speculate tentatively to be roughly equivalent to that same posited by the originators of the mythology' upon which it feeds. We see that it is at once, as 1 have thoroughly descried, scientific and mystical, and that it is. moreover, the combination of these idealised concepts in the form of the very flesh of humanity itself. To this the now fatally decrepit religious establishment only prays to add what it learned from its now evening era of reign, that being economic and political social Harwinian-Malthusian survival of the fittest. And here we can conclude that (his (heory is, while founded initially on the shifting sands of time from which a crude ruin of foundation has been recently excavated, solidly supported on the one column by the most rationally reasoning scientific methodology and on the other column by"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"the totalitarian past social institutionalisation of religion. Its keystone, thus, is the Annunage.Yet what, according to this theory, are the Annunage? What is their truth, and what is the history of their origin? Let me offer my own speculations on this regard.When true science arose to replace rude religion, it attempted to look back to what it had been brought up and raised to believe was the origin of time itself, the beginning of the human species. Therefore, it founded as its contrary cosmology to the fairy talc of Adam and Eve and their temptation by the serpent in the Garden of Eden (he alternative explanation of our evolution from common ancestors with other existing animals. The discovery of the fossilised remains of now extinct species has done more to support this poorly constructed axiom than more easily questionable and much less well understood techniques such as carbon dating and the application of the second law of thermodynamics.Of course, we have since learned that, as Genesis taught us for the ages, time began at even an earlier point than the origin of species, and, when we look back to the dawn of humanity, we seem to be standing at the edge of a nearly infinite abyss of cosmic creation that yawns onward almost infinitely back through the gradual cooling of the earth and the solidification of the solar system’s fellow planets, through the nuclear cosmogenesis of the sun and the other stars, from the beginning of the first quantum fluctuations which gave rise to today’s black holes, all the way back to a point billions and billions of light years ago. now known of as the \"big bang.\"It is here that (he Annunage rightfully belong, however their unearned reputation associating (hem wi(h sociopathic resistance against (he purely hallucinogogic singular Creator deity denies them their rightful orientation in alignment with (his (ime frame, and so (he contemporary theory degrades this by one interval along the arbitrary gradient provided by the religion of the singular dei(y to place them as being one and the same force as is responsible for the beginning of our own home planet and the solidification of the other planets in our solar system. Of course, scientifically rationally we now know full well there are other intermediate steps between these two events, but so long as the Annunage are associated with an anthropomorphiscd pantheon of demi-dcities (hey are forced (o play by (he rules established by (he gross superstition of the religion which pursues the enforcement of the single creator deity.Thus let us examine that aspect of the Annunage legend which associates them with what the church of the dominant religion promotes as the original sin of the flesh and the reason for all subsequent struggles for survival which it views as so socially necessary. The fall of man is associated, in the parables, with the fall from grace of a portion of (he heavens, anthropomorphised as angels, and which had once been the deities of elder, conquered tribes and nations. So, accepting this as an allegory', what event can we reasonably hypothesize it describes?Quite recently to the time of this writing, small rocks buried deep beneath the ice sheets of the southernmost continent of Antarctica were found to contain living microbial organisms. At that time it was widely speculated that these unexpected living relics might have been the millennial offspring of an interplanetary germination between earth and its nearest cxlra-solar neighbor Mars, however (he mechanism of transport from the \"red planet” to the south pole of earth went without commentary. Since then, and literally so recently as the year of this writing, dinosaur bones were also discovered in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica, however."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"of course, no one theorised (hat (hcse were off world in their origin. A( (he very time of this writing, (he National Aeronautics and Space Association (NASA) with a European and Japanese collaborative commission, have sent small robotic rovers to explore the surface of Mars for any evidence of similar microbial organisms living in an equally barren wasteland to that of the frozen continent here on earth. As of yet. they have found some promising signs of erosion which they believe was most likely caused by hydrogen-2 oxygenated liquid water, as opposed, for example, to the known sulfuric contcm deposits now in existence (here, and (hey (hus reason, aHhough in (he opinion of some, somewhat superstitiously, (ha( should such microbial life forms be found to exist on Mars, they would likewise be the offspring of organisms to have existed in such environmentally supportive conditions. All of this, of course, is precedent upon the continuing genocentrism of we carbon-based life forms failing to recognise the very potential for sentience offered by the opportunity of artificial intelligence (AI) afforded us by those same silicon-based robotic rovers such as we have sent in our place to explore the surface of Mars. The notion (ha( (hese rovers themselves, through not having been thoroughly sterilised during past missions, might be (he actual source of any microbial life forms (o be subsequently discovered on Mars has not escaped the realm of possibility in at least a small number of hardline skeptical scientists.However, to return to the microbial organisms of earth’s Antarctic ice sheets. While it is more likely that these living creatures are the descendants of life forms that existed even previous to the dinosaurs, there is not as of yet any evidence to support that (heory of (heir interplanetary germination. Thus, if (heir origin is indeed (o be speculated as being off-world, (hen some mechanism of transport must be proposed for their arrival, and some timeframe therefore must also be established.Nitric ice core samples similarly extracted from the Antarctic glaciers, as well as deep core samples from the floor of the ocean, indicate the possibility that comets have struck the surface of the earth in the past. These deep space voyagers most likely originate from a hypothetical cloud of icy dust particles in the depths of the empty area halfway between the outermost planets of our solar system and the next nearest star. It is thought they are drawn in by (he gravitational attraction of our star (he sun and our fellow plane(s to become increasingly large attractors of interstellar icy dust particles, thus becoming comets. However the likelihood of a microbial life form existing in the high velocity low temperature conditions of the interior of a comet is highly improbable, however attractive this theoretical method of truly galactic germination of our earliest genetic ancestors may be. The evidence of scarring on the moon our satellite and of known massive craters on earth’s surface indicating the impacts of debris from the asteroid belt between Mars and Saturn is a much more satisfactory place to start our search should we wish (o explore (he possibilities of (rans-cosmic seeding of our earliest ancestral life forms.However, even these theories seem farfetched be.side the most rational explanation for the original genesis of carbon-based life that evolved genetically, through the intervening era of the dinosaurs, to become the myriad of species that exist today. The fact of the matter is that the first life on earth was almost statistically certainly terrestrial in its first incarnation, although the mechanism of its molecular attraction inio organic composHion is not yet completely understood.It seems to this author the most likely series of events occurred as follows:1) auto phagic, or self-feeding, microbial organisms evolved naturally surviving originally purely on thermal energy near the gas vents along deep sea trenches in"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Ihe primordial worldwide ocean of ihe early earth.2) hetero-phagic, and especially bacterio-phagic. microbial organisms evolved either In the upper ionic stratosphere where high deposits of carbon were infused with massive amounts of electromagnetic radiation by both the liquid hydrogen-2 oxygen compounds of primordial volcanic ash induced storm clouds and the direct solar wind emanating from the sun our star, or somewhere even more barren of thermally hospitable conditions further out in the depths of space, and were then seeded into the primordial oceans of earth.3) these two microbial life forms combined into a synthetic, new, third form of microbial life, which immediately gave rise to the sharp spike in the rate of diversity in form and function of microbial life forms in the primordial worldwide ocean, spawning larger multi-organic and exo-skeletal living organismal structures which have since come to be known of as, and found globally as fossilised, trilobites.Now, this can exist as a hypothesis for which science may or may not find sufficient evidence to support, or Otherwise to refute, entirely independently of the legend of the Annunage. However, because it is a fringe theory, as I have stated before, it must needs first be presented for the popular acceptance of those peripheral to and marginalised by the mainstream of current methodology. And. to this end. it must needs be adapted to fit in and suppoit the mythological structure concurrently accepted as the framework of this segment of the population. This, as I have demonstrated fits in accordance with the resurgence of the Annunage legend.Now, we shall first examine how this supports the contemporary theory of the Annunage legend, and, secondly, what physical and scientific evidence seems to exist in support of this otherwise autonomous theory.As I have stated, the present condition of the legend of the past-pantheon is itself a product of their subsequent rebellion against and fall from grace before the since omnipotent singular creator god. Therefore, they are seen as vilified, and thus forced to consort with those other concepts, whether idealogical or physical, which are likewise vilified by the modern popular mind. These include the wealthy and authoritative segments of the population, the Darwinian Malthusian philosophy projected upon their earning of income above their means and social use, and. consequently, the very genetic theoretical basis of this modus operendi. To this end. the aforementioned theory addresses the very' origin thereof in the form of the first living organisms to inhabit this planet.The legend also has transformed the formerly unknown ideal causation of all naturally occurring patterns of destiny in space as being derived from the directional dimension of time perpendicular to the three previously known dimensions of space. To this end. as we shall soon see, the aforementioned theory addresses the proliferation as like form to the patterns of organismal life of idealised forms of intelligent design, and it will further be postulated that these same noil- anthropomorphic entities exist in a dimension beyond that of which the material universe is comprised.Now, as to the ways in which this theory addresses the evolution of patterns of life from the lime of its origins lo the present, such has been self evidently implied already, however it is not without importance to consider il in some great detail. It should be noted that the two primary' forms of trilobite life form which have been preserved by fossilization are based on a spiraling shell or on a rudimentary external"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"spinal structure. Koih of these arc gifted with the most basic forms of internal digestion systems, with a prototypical mouth at one end and a basic anus on the other. It should be noted here as being fundamental to the theory- that the prior forms of microbial life forms to these types trilobites did NOT possess either spiral shells, rudimentary spinal columns, nor both a prototypical mouth and a basic anus.Instead, what we see is that the bacterio phage possessed a rudimentary external spinal structure and prototypical mouth, and that the auto-phage a thin membranous shell and a basic anus. However the key to life is in the combination of these trails into the fusion of am internal digestion system possessing both an intake mouth and an outlet anus. To this extent, when the mammalian life form is first divided from the gamete blastocyte. it unfolds in a spiral, and the first thing to form within it is its internal digestive system with mouth and anus, followed soon thereafter by its internal spinal structure.Now, as to the ways in which I his theory addresses the proliferation of these patterns on an archetypically ideal level alike in form to these patterns of organismal life.The primary mechanism of genetic replication in the organism after its initial cellular division as merely an extension of the sexual reproductive organisms is by a small rybosomal structure known as the mitochondria. This organism interacts with the helix of DN'A comprising the genetic make up of the nucleic cellular environment by unzipping the double strands into a unpaired single strand, after which it replicates identically the opposite paired chromosomes on the DNA strand and zips it back up into two new double helices. The result of this on a microscopic level is the reproduction of identical nucleic cellular structures over time, thus prolonging the duration which the tissues of the organism containing these cells can continue to exist. The result of this longer life-span on a macroscopic level is the vast proliferation of population of species, leading to a complex hierarchical struggle for dominance and control of resources. This is the basic pattern of the organismal life forms on this planet.The communication of information between these life forms in order to establish social hierarchies of interpersonal dominance as well as to coordinate relationships which determine the ability to reproduce and promote the continuation of the species is essential in all of this planet’s carbon-based life forms. As such, a mechanism for such communication of information which most essentially mirrors and mimics that utilised on both a cellular and population level requires development of the cerebral structures of the organisms, when present. The initial presence of such a dominant cellular structure as the cerebral organ and its subsequent development via use to this end in large part has determined the primary dominance"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"of species in the history of evolution of life forms on this planet.The cerebral organismal structure therefore possesses intelligent thought, and, as consequence, communicates this through the remainder of the tissues of the organism. The structure of these thoughts is of such а Ппе energetic nature (hat the depths of its minutia have not yet been discovered, however it is believed by some scientists at the time of this writing lhat ihe molecular micro tubules inside Ihe gray matter of Ihe developed cerebellum are actually utilising the quantum uncertainty principle of subatomic particle wave duality. Such may yet prove to be the origins of information, while meanwhile other sociological researchers are speculating that communication reflects the spread of populations in accordance with resources In the form of memes, or interest-generating repeating units of data, which spread \"memetically” through the resource pool of information essentially identically to the spread throughout organic tissue of the bacterio phage.Much more can be said in regards to the geometrical structure governing both ihe microbial evolution of the earliest trilobite life forms and the micro evolution of the developing mammalian foetus inside the womb, as well as the ultimate biological organism of the adult mammalian human being: in addition to this a great deal can be further speculated about the geometric shape of anti-particle-wave duality quantum structures which exist beyond the speed of photic radiation and their similarity in both individual form and pattern of proliferation; however such a brief exposition is not the place to go into a sufficiently detailed analysis of these similarities. Perhaps at a future time when our technological advancement is more in line with the internalisation of our own pursuit after the unknown ideal, these similarities in geometry will become not only more well known, but even essential to our ability to control our evolutionary survival, and at that point in time we may return to address the transtemporal aspects of the Annunage.A. (he triple angle and ten triplicitiesAll too well known from antiquity is the circle of (he craft. This is the circle inside of which stands the magician, along with their apprentice, assistant or scribe(s). From here the magical operations are conducted. From time immemorial it is legend that, this circle being rightly constructed, it is inviolable to all that lies in the space beyond. A perfect glyph of the cyclical nature of the world, it is properly placed about with the appropriate stimuli to the specific summoning. Of course, these vary in both attribution and correspondence from time (o time and author to aulhor. What one scribe records as a working paradigm relative (o one entity, ano(hcr working more or less au(onomously will pen down differently for (he same. I( could be said of magic circles, like (he true secret of the mysterious practise itself, that each purports to be the conclusive standard, and that, yet, no two are alike. Some circles are comprised of the signs of the zodiac: others are by obscurely rendered sigils and signs sealed: many make use of certain geometric stellations such as the pent and the hex. Some compound upon the divisions of names and biblical phrases, those used by the operators of so-called White Magic. Others make black humour of such by depicting the letters (hereof as strangely shaped figures or zoomorphs. As (o examples of each type, hundreds abound. Hut among (hem (here is no final solution.Lesser known is the triple angle of the art. This is the vehicle of the conjuring itself, into which the relevant entity is summoned to appear. It appears the triangle of the conjuring was a medieval addition made by the manufacturers of the popular grimoires. having arisen some time between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that is, between the time of the gri moire of Honorius and the publication of the Goetia of Rabbi Solomon. Since this vehicle was not included in earlier, and was in the somewhat more modern works, its origins may be the cause of speculation. It is possible that it reflects the times in which the collections of invocations in which it appears, or it may be (hat il was always a lool of the practitioners from times immemorial, and was only subsequently revealed to ihe public al large al ihe specified later lime. Regardless of its historical point of initiation, it proposes some pertinent questions about the nature of the Great Work being therewith undertaken.Гог only a brief example. If the circle alone were sufficient to guard the magician from the forces being called forth, whence the triangle? There is some evidence to support the concept that the triangle was used not to protect the magician from the spirits being summoned, but to reify the force itself, to make the spirit appear visible or to be made sufficiently manifest that the summoncr can have concourse with it.According to Levi, the orientation of the triangle relative to the conjurer was of utmost importance. “If the spirit were supposed to be from heaven, the operator placed himself at the top. and set altar and fumigations at the bottom: but if the spirit came from the abyss this method was reversed” (cf. Levi, 223). Ilall further cautions the magician who would combine these polarised forces. “The black magician cannot use the symbols of white magic without bringing down upon himself the forces of white magic, which would be fatal to his schemes\" (cf. Hall, 3261. Therefore, the triangle, as a vessel for the visualisation or manifestation of a spirit, must needs be Specifically aligned for work the dark aspects of the art. Therefore, chough it has only been revealed via works that deal specifically with these dark side currents, the triangle of the art appears a relatively neutral concept in the heraldry of the craft.It is implied in Levi that it can be used for works of righteousness or of indignation, and elsewhere that it is meant to be merely a vehicle for the conjurer's concentration. Therefore it can be thought of as having dark and light attributions, in spite of being introduced only as recently as the grimoires of the dark goetia.These dark and light aspects of the triple angle, henceforth called, collectively, the triplicitics, derive from the practical applications of various systems acceptable to the mainstream consciousness. It should be worth noting, at this point, that none of the triplicities which will here be considered originated in the practise of the dark art of the magical craft. Just as with the triple angle, they predated their application to this form of summation, however all of these triplicities, be it to the light or to the dark works, can, like the triple angle, be applied to the practical work itself.In plain language, the correspondence between some of these tripartite attributes and the triple angle of the art may seem unprecedented and even antithetical. The triple angle of the art is strange and foreign to the mainstream of public awareness, while, on the other hand, many of these triple attributes have become well known and accepted as being inherent aspects of modern globally practised religions.

Of course, they are merely two sides of one common denominator, the same idea expressed from two polar opposite perspectives. The triplicitics, drawn from common sources, and the triangle, drawn from the arcane, are. however, only opposed in point of original reference: in their correspondence, as shall be shown, they agree point for point.For each of these triplicities. their internal order is designed as arising from a base through a transformative element to a transubstantiation. transcendence, a rarification or a realisation.

According ю precept 1855, the difference between a moral sin and a venial sin is a matter of charity. Thus, a mortal sin, according to precept 1857, “is a sin whose object is a grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.\" On the other hand, a venial sin. according to precept 1862, is committed when one “does not observe the standard prescribed by moral law. or when he disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full knowledge or complete consent.” As a reference to the \"moral law” the Catechism lists the ten commandments, and states, in precept 1860. that “no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of every тап.\"The rejection of the sum total of the ten commandments, that is, the rejection of God’s forgiveness through repentance, is considered an “eternal sin” (pr. 1864). The catechism also reminds us that “sin committed through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest” (pr. 1860).So. let us consider first the mortal sins, that is, the positive affirmations of the negative declarations of the ten commandments. The ten commandments, as they arc given in lixodus 20:3-17, arc as follows:I. Thou shall have no other gods before me.II. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness ol anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shall not bow down thysell lo them, nor serve them: lor I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto Ihe third and fourth generation of Ihem that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.III. thou shall not take the name of the Lord they God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.IV. Remember the Sabbath day. to keep it holy. .Six days shall thou labour, and do all thy work: bul the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord ihy God: in it thou shall nol do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all thai in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed il.V.

Пюи shah nol steal.IX. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.X. Thou shall nol covet thy neighbor's house, thou shall nol covet thv neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is ihy neighbor's."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"These, therefore, are the sins that prevent charity. The sins that impede or hinder charily, but do not completely snuff it out from within the sinner’s heart, are varied, and different sources disagree’ with one another as to their number and nature. Some good sources of study on the subject of venial sins include Dante’s Inferno and Purgatory and Milton’s Paradise Lost. From these and other sources we can draw upon at least seven such sins, which may be considered sins of omission rather than commission, for they represent a negative attribute in the form of hindrance to repentance, and thus to forgiveness and divine charity.These may be thought to include, at least, and in no necessary order. Gluttony, Greed, Slolh, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. These types of sins can be thought of as “gateway” sins, in that they lead to more serious sins of intention, and lo the forgetting altogether or intentional disobedience of the aforementioned moral law of the ten commandments.If we are to understand the true nature of sin. perhaps it would be best to follow the advice given by Martin Luther in paragraph 13 of his letter 99, Aug. 1, 1521, to Phillip Melanchthon, from the Wartburg.If you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary bui ihe irue mercy.

Far too many people consider themselves experiential, if not schooled, qabalists. Whenever their lack of intellect prevents them from shrewdly doing away with iheir experience by definition, they consider il so miraculous an event that they classify it under the mysterious, the mystical, or even the metaphysical. Hence, the dumber the pseudo-philosopher, the more convinced they become that they are “doing” qabala. Of course, there are many practitioners of the base craft of ha qabala. and of those many who have come by their skills through apprenticeship, and so we have a long line of apprentices of apprentices, perpetuated by the misnomer that to take an apprentice is the same as to “be\" a Master. This line of exoteric apprentices must, we may assume from desperation for some Koyal Road, however concealed and impossibly lofty, reflect the base manifestation of an esoteric precession of Masters. However, any direct evidence of these “Secret Chiefs\" among the common practitioners of the craft, however skilled by training, has only been outright fraudulent at worst, questionable at best. So. it would seem that the art of ha qabala. like the keys of Masonry among the Blue Lodge brethren, has been lost beneath the sands of time. The experiential practitioners of the craft continue to apprentice one another, as though this jockeying for supremacy were anything greater than a mere bastardisation of Darwinian-Mallhusianism, while the Great Masters of ihe art"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"remain so few and far between that, whenever one reveals themselves by necessity or accident of circumstance, they are enshrined for the millennia as Buddhas, or worse, as Messiah.To these artisans, ralher than artists, it would come as a great surprise that such as Nietzsche had studied the perennial philosophy. To the average half witted Willfully ignorant fool in over their head in their studies, but with their head forever lodged In che clouds when it comes to their “practise,” the bare fact that not only themselves, but everyone who has ever lived, is a practitioner to one level of skill or another of their same chosen line of inquiry. Not only are they, the bumbling mortal adept, but from the eldest of sages, through the philosopher-mages, down to the youngest of the newborn babes, engrained from conception lo death with the same pattern sought, and, by few, discovered, underlying all material existence.For example, Nietzsche, arguably the greatest philosopher of all time, wrote, in the prelude to Also Sprach Zarathustra. one among his finest works, ten vignettes of the man coming into enlightenment by “going under.” When these ten chapters are compared to the ten sefirot, as. say. placed upon the winged and dual-serpentine staff of Hermes, then much wiser commentary on ha qabala may be seen therein than in the average practise of the common qabalsilic craftsman.Though, even much, much more obscure and forgotten than this, is the mention made by M.P. Hall in his Secret Teachings of All Ages regarding the ancient history of the zodiac as it pertains to the origin of the mythos of the ten luminous emanations upon which Nietzsche would later comment so eloquently. Hall states, “some authorities are of the opinion that the zodiac was originally divided into ten houses, or “solar mansions”.... The solar zodiac at that time consisted of ten houses of thirty- six degrees each’* (Mall, 150). This was probably the basis for the 360 degree circle, which, when divided up into 22/7 sections yields the all-important unit of measurement known as Pi, which was so integral to ancient systems of reckoning.According to Zecharia Sitchin, the implementation of the 36 dekans ruling ten degrees each of the 360 degree ecliptic circle was subsequent to an earlier. Lunar calendar. The difference between these two derived from a competition, Sitchin sees it, between the God Thoth and the God Ra of the ancient Egyptians, who were, quite probably, the first makers of symbolically evocative calendars. Accordingly, the lunar calendar of Thoth came to be replaced by the solar calendar of Ra, and to mark this transition in praeterhuman rulers we have the implementation of the vocational year, matched to the solar cycle, of thirty six weeks of ten days each, with, to compensate the actual length of the year, a five day span of intercalary holidays thrown in at some later point in history.It is, indeed, interesting to note how the mythos of the 36 dekans survived from earliest antiquity through the intervening epochs of history. For example, in the Greater Key of Solomon, a supposed “grimoire” dated from the eighteenth century but which, in all likelihood, dates back much earlier than this, there arc exactly 36 planetary sigils or talismans oriented around the central seven of the sun. Likewise, in the Lesser Key of Solomon, or the Goetia, a somewhat less scrupulous work which almost certainly is the product of a much later practitioner, the 36 take form as the 72 intelligences governing over the tens of degrees of the heavens by day and by night.If, as has been implied by the venerable master M. Hall and by the studious apprentice I. Sitchin, the original number of ecliptic constellations was ten rather than 12, then we would nol be looking at 36 dekans, three governing each of the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"twelve \"mansions\" of the zodiac, but rather at a base 50 system where five dekans each guarding over the signs. This seems to be in keeping with the Kurgan tradition of the stone wheels, or henges, of the late neolithic and early agrarian age. prior to the magnificent Old Kingdom Egyptian constructions based on pi as derived from the 360 degree circle. This would have been the time period during which was written the original Sumerian manuscript upon which would be based the later. Babylonian Enuma Elish. Here we see fifty attributes, or ME’s, bestowed upon Marduk. however, we know from earlier sources only subsequently unearthed, that in the original Sumerian version these were all attributed to Enki, the “father” of Marduk. These have since come to be known as the 50 “names\" of Marduk.These too have had a curious, and even more arcane, transferal towards the current era via the mythopoeia of ha qabala. The third sefirot, Understanding, is, according to an ancient superstition with little or no basis in known surviving manuscripts, divided into fifty so-called “gates.” known as the “gates of Binah.”So. at last, we may return from the cold depths of ha qliphoth to the sweet waters of Ihe Greater l ight from which they originally fell.V'. on rituals of invocationManifestation requires inversion because it occurs at the intersection of equal amounts of opposite forces. Coming from one direction is the energy of mentation. Coming from the opposite direction is the matter of materiality. Matter is a positive, and energy is a negative. As such, matter is usually a centrality, while energy is circular around and outside of it. For manifestation lo occur, mentation must make a hole of materiality.Ordinarily, materiality would meet materiality kalisthenically. They would be equal in strength and opposite in substance. However, for any form of manifestation lo succeed, inversion must occur between the polarised strength and substance. The energy of mentation and the matter of materiality must become equal in substance, but opposite in strength. Once the strengths of mentation and materiality have become polarised, then the substance of the two will become equal.The pressure of materiality is relative lo the angle of trajectory of mentation. Thus, to reverse these traits, then ihe viscosity of materiality and the friction of mentation must be reversed. For the strength of mentation to become opposite ihe strength of materiality, therefore, then one has to be slowed while the other is quickened.Because every material object is comprised of energy at one fixed velocity of vibration or another, determining their solidity of consistency, then the opposite of this is Ihe variable velocity of thoughts in ihe mind. For mind lo manifest mailer, it musi move al a fixed velocity, either faster or slower, than mailer. This will create a vacuum of alteration, resulting in the vacuum being filled by a varying vibrational velocity of mailer.Now. since it is clear that there is a polarisation in velocity between mind and matter, such that one repels the other, then it is necessary to correct this polarisation inside the mind. The mind must move simultaneously more rapidly and more slowly than some vibrational frequency of a material object in order to “wrap itself around\" the fixed vibrational frequency of the material object.Once the vibrational frequency of the mind becomes a variable polarity, it inverts"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the vibrational frequency of its fixed point of concentration. The point of concentration becomes a variable polarity; the object becomes subjective. Once this has occurred, then the same type of connection between the objective mind and the subjective substance is established as When a hand reaches out and grasps something. This is the same, though reversed, relationship as between the subjective mind and the substantial object of attention ordinarily.Now. as to how the ordinarily variable vibrational frequency of thoughts can be converted into a dual polarity relative to itself, there are several techniques for this. The application of a specific methodology will determine the mechanism of the results acquired. For example, an effect can be accomplished using technology as an intervening factor. Technology as a medium produces a clean, direct effect, however because technology is primarily material, its effect is only arithmetic. For effectivity to become exponential, then technology, matter, or a medium of any kind must be discarded. However, this is more difficult to sustain, and is best discussed elsewhere.In this exposition we will deal primarily with the usage of a mediumistic type of conversion between the fixed polarity of the mind achieved by simultaneous rapidity and relaxation of thought and the variable vibrational frequency determining the substantial consistency of materiality.What we are dealing with here is therefore not the effect or end result of manifestation, but the medium itself between the mind and matter which, when present, at least partially determines this effect and outcome, and which is either material or mental in itself. Now, to the extent that this medium is mental, it has largely been partitioned as unknown, inexplicable and mysterious. This is merely lo say that it is accessible for discussion only through descriptions which relate it to physical mediums. To this extent, we have suffered a great deal of observationally inaccurate astrology, bodily posturing in magical ritual, unfortunate choices of metaphors by physicists, and general superstition throughout the ages. Much of this plays directly into what has become the physical nature of material mediums, though little of the actual physical media pertain to these types of ceremonial allegories. It is to the more physical than mental media which we shall turn our attention here.Now, as far as a direct physical medium for manifestation to occur, there are several, as was mentioned. Some are physiological, such as the opposable thumb, while some are technological, such as the internet. While thumbs enable us to perform actions such as utilising tools to build things, which is a very slow, laboriously rational, and commonly accepted method of manifestation, the uses of technology as a medium rather than merely a cool in itself are only beginning to be uncovered. Modern philosophers discuss the concept of the meaning becoming the message, and the message becoming the meaning, etc. However this only appears to be a new bent in philosophy because the past magicians had already worked out their dominance relative lo the staff or the wand.A. on chaos and toxick magickthe chaos magician believes there arc no rules, the toxic magician knows there are no rules, the magicians are active and passive, the toxic magician manipulates, the chaos magician aspires (o manipulate, the magicians are a means and an end.The chaos magician perceives chaos."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The toxic magician manipulates chaos, the magicians are the art and the craft, the toxic magician came first, the chaos magician came later.The magicians are the rising and setting, the toxic magician learned how to manipulate sooner, the chaos magician has not yet learned to manipulate.The magicians are the polar extremes.The chaos magician causes and creates chaos.The toxic magician controls and shapes chaos.The magicians are the tree and the seed.1. Chaos HierarchyWe are all Toxic Magicians to some extent already. It is the still small voice of the Master which resides somewhere burled deeply within us.No one can deny that the only truest form of the Toxic Magician is the newborn infant. They bend the whole world to their will. Even the Master himself has honored this form of \"innocence,\" implying that chaos ultimately substitutes itself rightly for the True Will.Once, however, this Chaos is eventually supplanted by the True Will of the Master, then the individual \"falls\" and will be cursed to spend the rest of their lives resupplanting their own Will over that of the True Will of the Master.For example, the will of the toddler is the will of the aspirant, for they arc gradually learning how to be used by the Will of the Master (potty-training) even while they are attempting to learn how to impose their own will over the trap of their own physical nature (learning to walk, to talk. etc), fkxause of their constant questioning of reality, the Master knows this period of an aspirant's development as \"the terrible two's.\"Later, the will of the child is basically that of the chaos magician, seeking what their own True Will will be. trying to settle upon what Master to follow. Soon enough a Practitioner will come along and Force the will of the child to bend unto (heir own, and then the inner-monologue of the individual aspirant will begin to brainwash itself into its own parasitic imprint of the Will of the Other, thus elevating the Practitioner to the degree of Master.This new Master will ultimately delegate as the sensory filter for how the young- adult Aspirant will perceive and through which it will think that it, itself, is \"choosing\" to perceive the world, comprised of Other Potential Masters.There can be little (o no doubt iha( (he Parent is (he firs( form of Practitioner known to the child Aspirant. However, it is not a constant that all Parent Practitioners ascend to Mastery by becoming the ultimate filter for (he child Aspirant's perception. Some parents are content with remaining mere guides, while others insist upon merely imagining themselves as sole possessors.Likewise, there can be NO doubt that the teacher is the first form of Master definitely known to (he child-Aspirant.

Thus, this whole and complete hierarchy of Master-Slaves has three common steady states.1 > the idea of the hierarchy as the practise of Toxic Magic. This state is the first inner-monologue of the Student-Aspirant. Tins is the first Survival-State, since It is necessary to adopt tills sense in the western industrial world. It teaches us that,\"to get ahead is good.\" and that \"it Is possible to manipulate the system.\" The first of these command-codes is meant to Imprint the Servitor with the interiorised Lust to serve the system itself, while the second is merely a false promise meant lo serve as the re input code.2) ihe idea of the hierarchy itself as personified Toxic Magician. This slate commands the firsi religious \"Understanding\" of the reflected summation of self in ihe mirror of the Will. Still, however, it is the subject of ihis reflection, and not the object, which commands attention, and which, therefore, governs over the lesser will of the individual. This is the condition of piety and prayer in the form of Church, and lhai ol the entry level position in the world of Work. It becomes necessary in this realm of thought to alternately receive and transmit the previously learned command codes in a material medium, such as money, which, however, has no purpose other than lo physically condition the body to obey the same rituals as already ingrained upon ihe mind.3> ihe Idea of the head of ihe hierarchy as Toxk: Magician. This is also a survival- state, since it is required for us to admit at some point in our personal indoctrination that it is an inevitable condition, one either demanded by God, or imprinted upon the aeons ol our evolution. This is the essential grounding of the code work itself as malleable, such that, nol only can we achieve the authority lo command others, to accomplish the goals of our command code as Servitors, bul lo meta-program our own command-codes, and thus become liberated, and possibly, liberate others, from the entire hierarchy of the control-siructure, or, at least, ю change lhai hierarchy as we have been programmed to understand it. In this final state achievable given the limited life spans of the human organism, one becomes obsessed with the idea of achieving power, either through the compulsions of the Priest Graft, or through ihose of Capital and Slate.A large part of the control-mechanisms set up by the few people who have, thus far. achieved the 'throne\" of enforcing Toxic Magic over the Masses has been to limit the degrees of freedom of those they \"help,\" such that, ihe mere \"knowledge\" that the physical world itself is governed by natural laws has been considered an \"abyss\" wherein miracles are permitted to be attributed to these Masters and science is forbidden. Because of this, the above terms should be considered from a scientific point of view, at least, such as has been imagined thus far by the minds of those whose place in recorded history has been secured. This might, at least, make permissible the idea that such impositions of our \"Understanding\" of them should constitute the \"Wisdom\" over such natural laws may still be accepted only as being so much \"theory.\"It should also be remembered that the above referred to \"Hierarchy\" is itself nothing to do with Toxic Magic, and is itself ONLY perpetuated by the controlled. The only way to achieve Mastery of Toxic Magic is to allow oneself to progress through CHAOS. This means, essentially, to embrace that nothing CAM be KNOWN, or rather, that ALL IS"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THEORY.Гог example, there is a Fourth Step to the Hierarchy, however it is one that is lateral to the rest. It is the ethereal component of Time, or what is usually attributed by the Institutions of the Hierarchy as being achievable only through vague ecoptoplasms such as \"life-after-death,\" \"transcendence,\" or \"the-last-initiation.\" In this step, one BECOMES the meta-programmer of their own reality, bending EVEN the laws of Physics.Of course, the achievement of this State can only be reckoned temporarily, such as it is that the Hierarchy itself is counter theorised as being able to \"fight back.\" by imposing certain CONSTANTS of physical law (transcendental numbers, the speed of light, etc.) which decompose from the reinsertion of one theory into another, or. their being made self-referential.Therefore, lo escape the Rules of ihe Hierarchy, one can only BEND (he laws of nature, of the STATE, or of High Finance. However, lo break (he rule would merely be (o se( a NEW record, and (o impose a new limit, and. ihus, (o be bounced back into the system.

Each universe that exists is: A) confined to the duration of the present, differing by scale only in accordance lo (he duration by which one defines as the present; and B) different in Some respects, (hough not in others, from its neighboring, adjoint universes.The goal of the Chaos Magician is to identify the non-differences between one digital present-universe and the ones before and after it. These similarities constitute the programming-codes, or the governing dynamics, of a meta-system. The Chaos Magician BECOMES the Toxic Magician when they DESTROY these simulations. Once these simulacra are destroyed, then all will be radically different between one universe-present and the next, such lhat, ultimately, the entire mechanism of linear lime will break down, and all present universes will exist simultaneously within a single primary universe, overlapping and infinitely unique.This is the transition between the crafting of Chaos, and the art of Toxic Magic. While craft is structured, art is free form. While craft depends on formalism, art depends on talent. Once this transition is found to exist, then the entire ebb and flow of physical forces of which we are aware will be discovered to be determined by the exchange rate between these two primal forces: the Chaos-in-Order of (he Chaos Magician, (he Order in Chaos of the Toxic Magician, and the Ordo Ab Chao Ab Ordo etc. of their relationship.Hence, the fact that the present-universe appears to break down upon observation from a random into a collapsed wave-function. It is governed by the black and whites of space on the one hand and time on the other. Time is an abstract behind and beyond the \"present\" and space is merely a refinement of (ime in(o (he slower slructure of existence within that present. While these two depend on each other, freedom from this Present Universe of space time can only be accomplished through an abolition of both of them by application to them of their polar opposites.A spouse finds it necessary, though in almost ALL cases discomfortingly unpleasant."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"lo enter into a contractual agreement with another free individual.

They can procreate, and thus risk bringing another soccer mom into the world, or worse, a little Hitler.Now, the reason for the high divorce rate is simple. People are equal ONLY in their freedom. We are Al l. born FREE. A baby cannot perform hard manual labour, and so we must accept that, blank slate or no, we are born WITHOUT responsibility over ourselves, let alone over others. As I said earlier, the infant is the ultimate form of Toxic Magician. However, when this freedom, this naivety known as innocence, is brought to an abrupt consensual end. such as through the ceremonies of marriage or occult initiation, then an imbalance of power occurs. In initiation, this is dealt with by enforcing the Master-Slave relationship, however, among \"free\" individuals, once married, then this simple relationship breaks down into complete disorder and over- complcxificalion. Hence, little things seem big, while big things get put off indefinitely. An argument over a simple verbal misunderstanding can result in thousands of dollars in hospitals bills, while the mortgage interest rates and other overdue bills are simply not discussed in polite society.Ideally, a marriage consists of two toxic magicians. However, when a marriage is the combination of a toxic magician and a chaos magician, or one of these with a \"common\" fool, then all hell will eventually break loose.Most people are Chaos or Toxic Magicians but don't know it... yet. They believe themselves to be powerless and therefore seek to become empowered, however, only in non-threatening ways most of the time. This leads to spastic bouts of depression and mania, the cycle of abuse, all the way through the honeymoon phase. The key to understanding how innate this inertia of sustained hatred and occasional violence is to our peculiar species of monkey is that, when left completely alone, as with the bachelor or the widow, most people will even abuse themselves. This brings a short­term satisfaction, as though by enforcing a ghost-moralily on themselves, in the absence of another to enforce it on them, they somehow maintain the illusion that they are less alone.Morality, although little more than a vague echo of the physical potentials, is merely an idealised form of abuse, all the way through guilt and shame. The Chaos Magician seeks to topple this, to overturn it. and to set it on its ear. The Toxic Magician, on the other hand, accepts this as an unpleasant and unfortunate fact of flesh existence, and attempts lo help it along, to manipulate the periodicity of such cycles into ellipses such that what they find pleasurable will outlast what they do nol.The reason most people feel out of control is bccause they are.

The man became irate and distraught as the officer seemed to completely ignore the extenuating circumstances of ihe situation, vis a vis the dying woman in ihe passenger seat. Now, the trulh of this situation is that the man was frustrated at ihe officer's being controlled by a behavioural system which dictated he handle this as a routine traffic stop.

And, moreover, given the circumstances, most people would agree with him. Rut then again, given the proper circumstances, US soldiers could justify firing on US civilians.Thus, ihe armchair general is ihe polar opposite of the armchair scientist. The general controls solutions while ihe scientist experiments with questions. And these two orbit one another around a playing-field of subordinates. To the average person, the chaos-theorist seems to understand and to wield forces they cannot possibly hope to understand. However, it is the Master Magician who makes the first move. After this the system of rules collapses into a steady state, and the scientist, though now capable of studying things in stasis, is hopelessly dependent upon following the rules of control. They may not, for example, upset the board and walk away. At least not without being ostracised and resented by the very subordinate pieces they wish to set free.These rules seem subtle and complex to the rank amateur or to the new initiate. However they are not. There is really only ONE RULE, although it is so important that it has never been given a name, or at least, its name is never revealed. The human emotions all LOOK the same in their extremes. Whether laughing or choking, waving or drowning, in ecstasy of orgasm or extreme physical pain under duress, this furthest exaggerated state of the emotions is the One Rule. All opposites break down at the point of pain tolerance into a Grand Unified Theory.To the Chaos Magician, it appears the resources for manipulation of the Toxic Magician are limitless and abstruse. However, no matter how many rules of thumb the Toxic Magician might make use of in passing from one situation to the next, there is only one principle of guiding philosophy which they always remember. That is that: though it may appear that one person’s liberty is derived al the expense of lhat of another, \"everything will work out in the wash.\" This means, essentially, something similar to the concepts of karma or Christian morality, actually; \"VVhal goes around comes around.\" This seems ridiculous to the Chaos Aspirant it seems lo contradict the entire backwards and upside-down rebellion of their own ethics and aesthetic. However, it is necessary to accept such aphorisms, in the end. as \"to make an omelet, you gotta break a few eggs.\" One cannot get ahead without leaving others behind, but. however infinitely various the map might seem, wherever one is going they will meel the same types of people and experience the same types of relationships. \"Wherever you go, there you are.\"One popular favourite of the crushed masses and envious employed is. \"it's lonely at the top.\" However, is this really true? Perhaps there simply IS NO TOP. Perhaps it is a continuous circle, a hamster-cage wheel one is simply doomed to spin around for eternity, but can never climb. What if there were no enlightenment, no transcendence, and (GASP!) NO second coming? What if the \"top\" were \"to the side?”Most people understand this concept, if only tauiologically. They race on about their daily lives, hopelessly oblivious lo the guiding principle of Irony, and yet, when inevitably confronted with it, laugh as though il were a familiar old nemesis. They SEEK to impose some semblance of order on their bustle and business, and in so merely ATTEMPTING, rather than DOING, FAIL. This circular system of self­"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"perpetuation, the world of which they see themselves as the centre, is not the same thing as \"the wash.\" In this system, what goes around does NOT come around. This is because all other things are equal. In an absolutely leveled system, there can be no victor, no conquest, no spoils, no opportunity for upward mobility. For example, most people believe that \"what you take is only equal to what you make.\" However, they themselves scrimp by putting in as little effort as possible into providing their paltry services for others. In this way, one cashier is ringing up another.On the other hand, human individuality and free thought are highly overrated.When something is not used then it tends to atrophy. Likewise, when it is only ever ABused. it tends to stagnate, impact or prolapse, and become infected. So it is with this \"ideal\" of Freedom. When people continue seeing this as an out-of-reach fantasy rather than a situational tool, then it will remain so. Again, the \"pursuit\" of pleasure is considered an \"inalienable right\" while it's attainment is strictly illegal.In this way domesticity prevails, and if should be noted especially that the pain felt by a domestic over a lesser wound is actually (.HEATER than the pain felt by a wild creature by a more severe wound, because it is coupled with the inescapable banality of an already low-grade painful existence. This type of dull domesticity is identified by most as a regrettably insurmountable problem in and of itself. The coping mechanism that the majority of western business people use to survive this quagmire is simple: ignore it. \"Ignore it and il will go away.\" However such ignorance perpetuates the malaise of inculcated life. In fact, it increases it. Ignorance to the point of borderline retardation, both mental and physical, is not only considered the norm, but is even cherished and lauded. Consider what a hit Forrest Cump was how much a hero of the common man he was.Every time I see a \"GOD IS PRO-LIFE\" bumper sticker, invariably the person is either spoiling a handicapped license plate, or is such a terrible driver they might as well be. These mascots for abortion see no irony in their belief, and this is WHY they are not worth tolerating. Not only IS there NO \"God,\" but to imagine an all-powerful creator of a universe sparkling with infinite variety even cares about whether a rape victim chooses to abort the seed released within her is simply beyond the limits of acceptability. Yet these people are the people that are running things. Therefore, a certain degree of kowtowing and towing the line is necessary to appease the overseers. This is part of the strange beauty of chaos, this form of impersonal and token-exchange sodomy.The token-exchange economic system is an example of Toxic Magic in effect. “A fool and his money are soon parted.\" There are, as any economist knows, two scales for high finance. One is microeconomics, and the other macroeconomics. While most modern western business people do not seem to realise this, these two methods are really one. and already this one is nothing. Behaviours toward money on a micro­level determine how one will prosper through the macro-level. If one is frugal, one will invest only in blue chip stocks, buy bonds, life insurance, etc. which will pay off greater fees at a \"later\" date. The result of this is that investors get locked into an interest-bearing debt structure, and end up paying in much more over the longer time than they would have received in the end. \"Better late than never.\" Contrary to this, if one day trades, engages in high risk, high gain turnaround business ventures, or pyramid schemes, then they will likely lose more money than they gain, though have high gains from time to time, at least high enough to sustain them through the subsequent series of busts until their next big break. \"The early bird gets the worm.” Now, which of these two types of people is the bigger loser? Though they represent extremes, they are equal and opposite."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The biggest loser is the person who does neither of these things, but instead only saves their money, not trusting the free market, retirement benefits, nor social- security programs to be able to sustain them through their lives. These people are not losers in the conventional sense of a gambler who folds instead of bluffing. They arc losers in the sense that they happily participate in the master-slave monetary system without expecting to be rewarded for their servitude. They believe they are responsible for their own well being, and thus end up pulling their children through college so they can majour in business, found a company, become successful, and thus leave behind a sum greater than their parents' generation. This is how the system promulgates itself. It does not care about the extremes, because the extremes burn themselves out either slowly or rapidly, and end up broke and begging in public. The system compounds itself by increasing the population of the middle-class. These people learn how lo get ahead to please ihcir parents. Each generation works harder, longer hours, and is more impersonal wilh iheir co­employees.After a few generations, these capitalist swine become the ultimate Toxic Magicians. They progress from control over business interests to control over politics. This represents the graduation from the Bureaucratic level of Chaos to that of International Affairs. Congratulations. By then, the family in question has become ingrained with certain unquestioned values. They pul the welfare of themselves first, of their friends and family second, and everyone else third. Although this is a proven formula for the creation of politicians in all levels of government, and since these politicians work actively on a daily basis (even NOW!) lo create and to sustain a working system of law-and-order to subsume our survival instinct and domesticate us. this type of breeding program continues on through shear inertia alone, producing, first yuppies, then CEOs, then elected officials.Again, to put a head on it. macroeconomics is the SAME as microeconomics. As the family progresses up ihe preexistent social ladder, thus compiling it of ihcir own dead flesh and bones, Ihey become increasingly ambitious. The student is eager to graduate, though usually terrified upon doing so lo enter the \"real world.\" Once this bridge has been crossed, the student becomes the yuppie, who is ambitious lo accumulate money. The CEO. likewise, is even MORE ambitious to make money FOR their company, and usually prides themselves on their quarterly turnaround for their shareholders. The Politician, finally, is the MOST ambitious. They have cast off the shackles of capital, at least to a greater extent than those in the private sector, and thrive off reputation ALONE. Imagine the entire thing as like working at a burger sland. You start out as a trainee for fry-cook. Then you learn to work register. Then, after many, MANY years of this, you may advance to become management, or even the owner of the small franchise. Parlay this into a nationwide, let alone WORLDWIDE burger-business and you will become the media-mascot for the chain of stores.There IS one level ABOVE the politician. That is the DICTATOR. However, the dictator usually comes in laterally relative to this work-a-day structure of society. They start out as a soldier, serving their country, or as a police-officer, serving their community. Seeing some things they don't like, they might try lo subtly manipulate changes by working WITHIN the system, and the result of this is lhat they arc- punished for \"stepping out of line\" and told, in effect, \"don't rock the boat.\" This results in embitterment. Add to this some form of trauma, such as being shot in the line of duty, imprisoned as a POW, or exiled for their political activism, and you create an angry individual hell-bent not on making subtle changes, but on overthrowing"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"everything out of pure- rage. This is the stringent recipe for a sheriff, a president, or at least, a senator; definitely some form of tyrant who controls politics on a global scale.However, the dictator always aspired lo that middle-class, suburban lifestyle: a life of success and leisure. So, in a sense, they are even lower than the lowest of the low. Q; What is more Toxic than a soccer mom? A: Hitler.The recreation of the middle class is the most dangerous fuel of all. While it begins innocuously enough, with sports, soap-operas. and game shows, its ends are global- thermonuclear warfare. attending fashionable awards ceremonies, and Bohemian Grove. Such recreation, rather than being \"an end in itself,\" is merely another form of WORK, \"a means to an end.\" The permutations along this pathway are endless and fraught with peril: interplanetary and interstellar space exploration using solid-fuel rocket propulsion systems, mind-control, and blue-blood inbreeding. If this goes on unchequed, the outcomes are too shocking to even calculate.There is no short supply of evil, and it doesn't usually need to take any extreme forms such as the investment banker, the disenfranchised stalker, or the New World Order. Usually it looks benign enough, and it takes so much to allow a person to see through the shroud of indifference that it simply isn’t worth doing. There are two, ultimate forms of Toxic Magician. One is the dictator, because they cause chaos from the highest echelon. This type of evil is usually easy enough to see, although, the Law of Irony usually causes us to cheer for them instead of lop off their head. The other type is more interesting: The Spouse.A dictator finds it necessary, though discomfortingly unpleasant, to attach themselves to some preexistent social movement or idealised cause. A social movement may make a strange bedfellow to the tyrant, who only knows their OWN Will. It should be remembered ardently that the dictatorship by a prole is not the same thing as a dictatorship by the proletariat.An idealised utopia is populated only by Chaos Magicians ensuring the absence of shame and guilt and Toxic Magicians ensuring the extinction of those destined to succumb, and all are philosopher-kings. However, there are the various steps one must go through, \"hoops\" to \"jump\" through, before this state can be achieved, or at least, perceived as the naturally existing reality. For example, if the Toxic Magician and the Chaos Magician were living in a localised tribe in the middle of the wilderness, the Toxic Magician (Shaman) would simply tell the Chaos Magician (Warrior) to kill something for them to eat, and he would do it. But in the modern world things are oh so much more complex. Hence we encounter some retrograde forms of chaos and toxic magic in the form of aesthetic deconstructionalism and political anarchism, respectively.The difference between magic and the social engineering of ail and law is that magic is helpful, returns results, and is positive, while deconstructionalism and anarchism are harmful, theoretical only, and extremely pessimistic. This might not seem like much of a difference, until you try them. Oeconstructionalists are often touted as being the highest form of Chaos Magicians, however, even this is merely a manipulation of the mind of the student of Chaos, probably perpetrated by a Toxic Magician. Likewise. Toxic Magicians are always being misunderstood to be. misrepresented as. and accused of being anarchists, with all the nefarious connotations with which this noble science hits been muck-raked. These, of course, have their religious components as well, with Chaos being associated with"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Deconstructionalism can be viewed as being retrogressive to the illusion of progress which self-perpctuates through the postindustrial psyche. Beginning wilh OADAism in the twenties and thirties in European bistro art exhibits of bare walls and incomplete stair cases, carried through in the collages of Picasso, deconstructionalism quickly moved into the literary world as well via the grandchild of the inventor of the mechanical adding machine (the first cash register or the first laptop computer, depending on one’s point of view), beat generation author William S. Burroughs, who coined the cut-up method for creating textual pastiche. From here it became, in turn, memetics (the study of language as a virus), semiology (the study of linguistic systems), and cybernetics (the study of systems in general), all under the umbrella term \"information theory.\" Many modern writers feel thal the entire field of science has begun to usurp by mimicry the role of religion, and thal the entire telecommunications industry is a means to the end of crowd control, however these are fringe-lhinkers and reactionaries, and should not be treated as carrying a serious message. Others have attempted to study the new meanings formed by randomness, such as the psychologist Jung and modern Chaoticians. From here, the new sciences have blossomed, from the project to map the human genome. AI, and psychiatry. All of these systems are perpetuated by deconstruct ionalism.\"Anarchy,\" Greek for \"defiant opposition.\" was not embraced as a workable system until 1840, when the political philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon published his work \"What is Property?\" Anarcho4^apitalism. on the moderate liberal side, and AnarchoCommunisrn. on the extremist liberal side, soon sprang up. however we should dispense of both of these as being merely temporally reactionary. Anarcho- Capitalism was dissolved, and Anarcho-Communism led to, essentially, an intellectual civil war between Mikhail Bakunin on the anarchist side and Karl Marx on the socialist side. This split from traditional revolutionary Marxism-Leninism of ihe l uddite movement, essentially an anti-technology, primitivisl movement advocating the complete dissolution of civilisation itself. This, coupled with a the hangover from Communism of mass revolution, led to Insurrectionary Anarchism, which is essentially where political anarchism remains to this day. It remains to be seen if Techno-Anarchism can revitalise Utopian Anarchism.Modern-day IXmonology. so-called by Christians, which amounts merely to pantheism in the occult, is a direct outgrowth of deism, which states essentially that God may be absent from an otherwise mechanical universe. Deism was prevalent in the late 18th century, during the industrial revolution, however has since become occluded and merely seems to be a dormant philosophy behind the debate between ethics and morals. Modern ethicists, largely doctors of anthropology, sociology and political theory, adopt the \"liberal\" stance of postulating an absence of God as explanatory of and beneficial for the growth of capitalistic \"liberated\" culture, while modern scientists, largely doctors of astro or quantum physicists and psychology, adopt a similarly atheistic tautology by reverse-engineering a deus ex machina Grand Unified Theory' from (he “big bang.\" By medieval Inquisition standards, all of these such professions would have been preemptively burned at the stake for witchcraft, and most modem Moralists are only a few beers away from this same mentality.Satanism follows its exoteric roots from Nietzsche through Crowley to LeVey. In the mid eighteenth century, sometime around when Kafka, in Prague, was contemplating (he existential crisis as (he metamorphosis into a giant insect, Friedrich Willhelm Nietzsche was feverishly crafting the “Anti-Christ,\" an vindictive polemicdemonology and wizard!sh conjuring, and psychopathy with outright Satanism."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"condemning Christian morality as \"weak.\" A thread was drawn between great men when Aleister Crowley chose as his name for the highest exoteric grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn which he achieved, TO MEGA THERION, Greek for \"the Great Beast,\" the early Christian term for the later Christian \"LUCIFER” or \"ANTI-CHRIST.\" However, it fell upon the shoulders of the later twentieth century occultist Anton Zsandor LeVey to take this the final step further, and endorse the counter Christian set of ethics as something which could be worshipped as its own God form. Following from this there has been a series of end of the twentieth century redactions and apologies for LeVey's childish outburst, introducing such alternative forms for the goat-god as PAN, whom Burroughs identified as the \"god of Panic,\" or various Gnostic demi-deities, as well as a series of slanderous accusations by reactionary religious groups of everything from covert covens of animal and human sacrificing Satanisls, to a vast, worldwide Satanic conspiracy. In its esoteric roots it is quite right to associate it with the mystical movements preceding these exotic figureheads, such as Naturalist Humanism. Pantheism and Atheism, respectively. It remains to be seen if Marilyn Manson. the young acolyte of LeVey, will be able to carry Satanism through into the twenty-first century, however he already expresses certain key philosophies of this anti-religion in his lyrics, such as \"hiding in plain sight.\" which are visciously derided as Satanic by those who. themselves, probably are.All of these modes arc considered anathema to any actual magician, at best absurd, and at worst an albatross hung around the magician's neck by the ignorantly superstitious. The imaginary etty currents of deconstructionalist culture and anarchist society beside the mainstream rapids merely feed and magnify the strength of its flow. and. by pretending to erode the \"information superhighway's\" foundations, only serve to strengthen the resolve of those who live for, and who moreover enjoy, sustaining the status quo. These detached and inert philosophies serve no real function to the survival of the modern organism in the complex system of modern civilisation, and so, like a scorned toddler, they throw a tantrum and either refuse to play or knock over the block-castles made by their peers. A magician smiles at such naive frivolity. Because they are all painted as REBELLION, these forms only serve to perpetuate the mythos of permanent institutions' primacy.Rather than Chaos magic seeking to clairvoyantly conjure up some form of mass sublimation of sexual tension through hysterical revolt against preexistent interpersonal behaviour and \"group-think,\" Chaos Magic seeks the unraveling of the very fabric of the space-time continuum itself, and (he overthrow of all metaphysics as being mere arbitrary approximations. It can neither be bound lo simple aesthetic expressionism nor to any movement of the Zeitgeist in weltanschung which such art represents. It calls for something bigger than these an apocalypse, a revelation, a \"pandemonium.\" a complete turning inside-out of the senses en soi.Likewise, rather than Toxic Magic seeking to plunge the world into lawless armeggedon by proposing an alternative religion as. itself, an alternative TO religion, Toxic Magic is merely a self-help methodology. It encourages one lo smile, and to help the self by helping others, which is one of Ihe fundamental building- blocks of the teachings of the Master, Jesus. Granted, as originally suggested by Nietzsche, it encourages one to help the weak destroy themselves, and, as well, advocates the avoldancy of externally-motivated paradigms altogether and the doubting of and ultimately outright, passive-aggressive manipulation of those who propagate any form of charity-based, \"decent\" morality.Of course, ihe only real similarity between any of these methods of social- engineering and retrograde religion and the actual day-to-day practise of Chaos or"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Toxic Magic is Che use of certain strategies and tactics which, originally utilised by the magician, are nonetheless copied by the pseudo-magician, ie the philosopher. For example, the \"hiding in plain sight\" method of the modern Satanisl is merely an identification with a tactic used by their historical abusers, ergo the Church. By making mind control of the masses into the Sunday Mass ceremony, it gives the appearance that consent lo it is optional, however il is so complete among its subjects lhat they shame, suppress and ultimately slay those who do NOT attend their brainwashing sessions. Hence, we can say that the CULT of Christianity is actually the guilty party in ihe case of the crime(s) of which they accuse their opposition. In effect, they \"create\" their own opposition ideologies as a purgative for their own sins. And they do all this behind the backs, or, usually, even right under the noses of their informed consenluals.The Chaos Magician wants to create a guilt free world. A world where there is no shame and no punishment, no reprisal and no consequence for their actions. The Toxic Magician wants to create a world-without-fools. and. beyond this, a fool-proof world. If you stop to think about it. these two states are really the same. However, most would consider either (let alone both!) to be an impossibly out of reach idealised utopia. One considers the guiltless on the left, the exterminators on the right, but. as 1 have stated repeatedly, both are the same, and nothing. In other words, we already live in this \"impossibly out of reach\" ulopia. The only thing lhal ruins it is that we question it and in this way break it down into consumable parcels. We see ihe chaos of reality and attempt lo impose order, and in so merely attempting, FAIL. Instead we should simply admit that chaos has its strange beauty, and, rather than impose our perceptual filters on it. and smudge all colours into a dark grey purple-brown, accept and even celebrate this peculiar and slightly discomforting beauty.2. Toxic PsychologyThe rational Mind craves Order. This means thal il wants what il does not already have, more of what il already has, and the continuation of what it already has. But this lust is learned, this method of propagation of the self over time is pre programmed, it is hard-wired into the survival instinct and perpetuated through conditioning. Thus, the ONLY form of Order that exists is the creation of patterns between one present moment and the next, and this is accomplished by. itself, the quest to find and to impose Order over Reality. Likewise, just as the repetition and ritualisalion of evenis over time brings the sensory semblance or illusion of Control, so loo is this rewarded from one monkey-servitor thereof to the next as being \"rational.\"This brings up the entire tacit enforcement of Logic and Reason. The purpose behind this is that, by imposing the desire for Order, the mind of the self, and subsequently, of the Other beneath that, is limited. It is not per se limited exclusively to Order, which yet permeates the remainder virally, but also to the Desire to Escape Order.The Creative Mind craves Chaos. This means that il wants, but has not yet accomplished nor achieved the ability to attain it. Even, by definition, the apprehension of such a condition as Chaos by the overreaching arc of the WILL is its downfall — like perpetually grabbing at straws. Ultimately, we only crave CHAOS to the extent that it is a commodified RARITY. This is specifically different from craving CIIAOS-IN and FOR ITSELF. Yet, for the majority of Aspirants to Chaos Magic, this is their sole purpose for attainment.Ultimately Chaos itself is merely another, further limitation, another \"meta\" form of"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Order. It offers no release, and certainly no relief, from Order-in-and-for-itself.Apollo yet supersedes Dionysus. The sun rises whether or not the Bacchanals from the previous sunset continue.Therefore, the concept of Chaos is merely, itself, a fudged-constant, a false-frontier, plagiarized definition, or replicated error. This is why the Toxic Magician \"banishes with Laughter.\" Their laughter is AT their aspirants, the fools who follow them, their Servitors, their \"fellow\" Magicians.The concept of Order expands to embrace the inward-thrusts of Chaos, it distends to accommodate the struggle, the revolution, the coming of the utopia of Messiahs, as well as the second coming of the One True Master.The left hemisphere of the brain has. by conditioning, come to be the dominant one in an asymptotically large percentage of the global population of the human species. Hence, we would LIKE to think that, to rebel, is to rebel AGAINST Order. To force our own evolution is to overcome, to spill over from, and to supersaturate our sense of the extemal-locus of control. This is the \"struggle\" of the WILL to assert individual FREEDOM over the imposed control of the self by others.However, in truth, beyond this there is only what Existentialism rightly identified as the \"Chasm of Freedom\" or what the Buddhists wrongly identified as \"selflessness.\" As the Greeks put it. \"when Zeus is toppled, chaos rules, and whirlwind reigns.\" Once one frees the Right Hemisphere of the brain to create artistically, to meta-program with the WILL the patterns of its host-body's physical behaviors, etc. then there is no thought to be no further attainment for which the individual ought lo aspire. And this is a LIE.The freedom from control by logic, reason, socialised rationality, etc (as such definitions are projected by OTHERS upon the responsibility of the left hemisphere) leads only to the Freedom TO Control by spontaneity, aesthetic, and preferential irrationalism, etc. (as such definitions are projected by ones own left-hemisphere upon the RESPONSIBILITY of the right-hemisphere), however beyond this there is a tacitly insurmountable quantum-leap enforced by the laws of physics.One is at firsl governed by, ihen tested by, and ultimately free to govern over ihe socially imposed definition of self, however, beyond this there is the subtle and understated agreement that nothing more than this is possible. Ultimately, the flesh becomes the commodlty-consumer control-code. the ultimate extent of monetary monopoly, yet is no less merely a means of mediation, or the inserted delimitation of time into the collapsed wave-function of the present.And this limit has been codified on paper. Il is a guaranteed human right\" by ihose who last successfully rebelled againsl tyranny lo superimpose their own codifications thereon that we should be allowed by the state something abstrusely called the \"pursuit of pleasure.\" This denies, of course, which is at the heart of carrot on-a-stick capitalism, the \"attainment\" of said, let alone of any, kind of \"pleasure.\"Therefore, to rebel IS to CONFORM. In a \"FREE\" Society, there is NO FREEDOM, since Freedom is Rebellion, and rebellion is provided, albeit only as sublimation and catharsis, in the form of \"RIGHTS\" and \"PRIVILEGES.\" Next it will be in the form of \"RESPONSIBILITIES\": We have the \"responsibility\" to \"protect\" the \"right\" to be \"free,\" for example.

We can shop at the GAP or we can shop at KMART, however, eventually all of us. as it is with diseases and death, will be required by our consensus reality to SHOP. This is like being a point on a strange attractor. We have the Unpredictable Freedom to follow one path or the other, however it is beyond the capacity for calculation by our imaginations to also include the options of choosing neither path or BOTH.If this seems like a faraway fantasy, then consider the commercial television and radio satellites which beam down their transmissions upon us whether or not we happen to be next to a switched-on receiver. We walk through these pulse-encrypted propaganda projections perpetually. We drive in them. We eat in them. We sleep in them. Carl Gustav Jung was first to propose the acausal connecting principle of Synchronicity as a perpendicular force to the standard arrow of entropy as cause and effect. Is this any different from the superimposition on our regular, behaviour pattern imprinting, tunnel realities (our karmic auras over time) of the background noise pollution comprised of blurbs of random information encoded as pulsed radiation? These two contenders for dominance also operate at right angles to one another. Perhaps, amidst all this static of seeming nonsense there is the occasional, subtle suggestion of a certain string of information which imprints itself on the consciousness of the consumer. This model, as discussed down to the least detail, has already been built out of our entire planet. Is it not possible this manifestation as physical of mental information might not just bombard our own minds so much that they would, like a Schroedinger wave function, simply collapse into a steady state of servitude to the whims and dictates of those who control the means of mediation?Think about how your microwave oven works. It broadcasts extremely high- frequency electromagnetic quantum information units omnidirectionally into meat. This causes the molecules of the meat to mutate, expanding outward. Inside the meat molecules, the excitation rate of the electron particles approaches asymptotic freedom and heat entropy is created in the form of gaseous moisture particles. Is this really any different than what we are doing to ourselves with the advertising media? And if all of this is possible as a result of external toward internal control then why wouldn't it be possible lo invert this?While such institutions exist, it is convenient if not necessary for the Chaos and Toxic Magician to act relative to them. In other words, either to infiltrate such systems for their own benefit, in the case of the Chaotician to accomplish their \"withering away\" or in the case of the psychopath to feed off Ihcir sense of charity, or ю work oulside of them and yet continue lo make use of the strategics employed by the owners of the dominant paradigm. Now, like Freemasons, it becomes necessary for like minded people, whether Within such systems or without, to be able to identify one another as such, however it is not expedient for them to merely exchange a secret handshake or obtain a bill of lading. No. Chaos and Toxic magicians must, like Puritans, know one another only by their deeds — how they make use of strategies, and. more importantly, of other people.This does not mean that a good Toxic Magician should attempt lo mimic the FORM of the dominant systems. The church of Scientology, or even ihe Mormons, are examples of a Toxic Magician benefiting even in death, and, as such, are useless"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"hurdles or \"hoops to be jumped through\" by subsequent seekers of attainment. No. it is NOT beneficial to mimic retrograde FORMS, but it IS necessary to mimic most FUNCTIONS. The best strategies are those employed by systems of domination, and the second best are those employed by those OUTSIDE of and AGAINST those systems. For this reason, an individual might employ the strategy of a \"cover.\" a group might employ the strategy of \"hiding in plain sight.\" and a dominant system, or conspiracy, might employ the technique of \"accusing another of its own worst crimes.\" however all these strategies are really the same, original, \"misdirection\" used by every, even the most profane, magician.The higher-up the individual is initialed into a conspiracy, the harder it is to tell they are, as individuals, utilising any certain strategy, because the higher up they are the harder it is to identify them as even BEING an individual. Thus, the only strategies FOR individuals that can rightly be formulated and practised are those of individuals OUTSIDE of conspiracies, and therefore, are meant to operate relative TO conspiracies. For example, as mentioned, the strategy of adopting a \"cover\" is often necessary among both individual Toxic Magicians and the lowest level functionaries of intelligence-based conspiracies, such as \"field-agents,\" or spies.The type of \"cover\" adopted by such an individual should not necessarily be 180 degrees different from the \"true\" nature of their task. It is best to leave some \"kernel\" of \"truth\" within the lie. though best not to leave a series of such \"bread crumbs\" that can be traced back to the actual identity. For example, a covert- operation involves drug-smuggling. The field-agent infiltrates the group posing as a drug smuggler. S/he should not. therefore, be afraid of the inevitable eventuality of having to actually DO drugs WITH the smugglers. Therefore, the agent is neither strictly an agent, nor strictly a drug smuggler. They exist in a stasis BETWEEN the two worlds, in a sort of limbo. All people, whether they will admit it to themselves or not. exist in a moral gray area.There are several types of \"cover\" on record for practising disinformation agents, such as the \"junky,\" the \"queer,\" the \"cop.\" the \"plant.\" etc. etc. etc. however finding one that will fit the specific situation of the operative is half the fun of employing this type of strategy. The other half is NOT GETTING CAUGHT. Often times it is not enough for the \"cover\" to merely appear to support the paradigm which it is infiltrating, but to appear to actively uphold the value systems thereof. In this regard there is no significant difference between the individual \"junky\" and the individual \"cop.\" Both appear to be upholding the moral standards of their respective cultures, and both are. therefore, well respected in their respective communities. Consider the \"undercover cop\" posing as a \"junky\" and you will understand the necessity of this principle of \"camouflage.\" Consider the junky posing as a cop and you will understand it even better.It is safe enough to assume and play a role in society, and most play a different one in every social situation, so it is a relatively safe approach lo adopt a role intentionally, and this is the art of crafting a \"cover.\" Now, beneath these covers one can do whatever one wants to do. Adopting a false facade merely creates a psychological wall around a person, a wall made up of behaviours, however behind this wall one feels safe to think anything, granted that behaviours do not necessarily equate 100% with the interior contents of a person’s mind.Now, to sec that this is not some kind of \"passive-aggressive\" \"defense-mechanism,\" or whatever reverse euphemism the recovery community of pseudo humanitarian leftists uses to brand its enemies with these days, \"building a wall around one's self\""},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"is a necessary feature of creating a memory-castle where one is at home and comfortable with themselves, and \"choosing one’s role\" is actually a well rewarded aspect of capitalist culture. In fact, to see this as unnatural only obfuscates the \"cover\" method itself, since it is not really an issue of WHY one chooses to create their own role or \"cover\" but WHERE the roles which they do NOT choose to create for themselves are coming from. This is merely understatement.Most social roles come from OUTSIDE the self. As children, we arc afraid of the dark. We create imaginary monsters to populate the darkness, and then react to them accordingly, ie. with fear. As adults, we are afraid of a form of psychic darkness. We create assumed motives for the behavior of others, and react to these accordingly. We do not ever Really KNOW the motives of others, but. for the most part, it is SAFE to assume. IN addition, like with the teddy bear, security blanket or imaginary friend of the child, these assumptions MAKE us FEEL \"safe.\" In essence, we only fear what we do not understand. If we believe we IX) understand something, then there is little reason to feel distrust for it. In this way, we make friends from strangers, family from friends, and fill the material darkness with the brilliance of our most profound stupidities and shortcomings. Most people are prepared to accept only what they expect, according to an old Surrealist proverb, and. I might add. most people lack the imagination God gives five year olds.Now. reverse this situation and you will feel the \"weight of the world on your shoulders.\" All your friends and enemies, everyone you know OF or ABOUT such as media celebrities and political punditoids, as well as every last person anywhere, no matter how distant a stranger to you, all control and delimit your collection of potential through expectations of their own world which define who you are by delimiting your choices. The flock of fools behind the wheel of spaceship earth are a motley lot of spare parts in one's perceptual difference-engine. One ACTS like a five- year-old. but only has half of one’s brain. Combine them all and it is a wonder that anyone is even capable of maintaining the illusory appearance of sanity, let alone struggling against it to define the role one wishes to play relative to this mad cacophony. Therefore, most don’t. They simply \"go with the flow\" (which is QIAOS) and understand that \"it will all work out in the wash\" (which is TOXIC).The most OBVIOUS example of this is the immediate family. To simply prepare to attend Thanksgiving, one must don the equivalent of a psychic \"suit of armour,\" let alone merely \"build a wall around themselves.\" The barrage of subtetfugal insults and \"button-pressing\" that goes on across the turkey-strewn table reminds one of the distinctly American hypocrisy of the myth behind the Holiday and explains why such an unpersonable fowl would be chosen as its fare.However, a BETTER example would be the philosophical school on psychology known as behaviourism. Behaviorism, founded by Burrhus Friedrick Skinner, states explicitly that the only determining factors of behavior are internal (such as DNA or \"nature\") and external (such as conditioning, \"nurture\"), however all within the realm of the material world. They leave no room for what moralists define as the \"soul,\" that is. the \"creative spark.\" or even what metaphysicists loosely term the \"mind,\" for example, \"the Will to Power.\" Everything is physical, and is therefore controllable. Back to deism and the \"altering\" of the Universal Mind.Behaviorism has under its arm several key successes in the scientifically experimental realm. The first. Pavlov's experiment with bells and drooling Siberian wolfhounds, is so well known by this time that it would be useless to more than sum up its conclusions and say that it spawned the study of Classical and of Operant"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"conditioning. Next, Professor Milgram's human research, using a button to make a subject believe they were shocking someone in the next room with electricity, provided several power-roles effective in the conditioning of a human subject, as well as proved the strong socialisation of obedience, even to the extent of committing murder on command. Most recently has been the Stanford prison-experiment, in which Dr. Zimbardo found that different degree power-roles were situational, or externally motivated, rather than self-selective.But Behaviorism's fatal flaw is in not counting as ephemeral and unique the pain tolerance threshold. This is the level at which the perception of sensory stimuli is considered to be traumatic to a closed nervous system. This is usually the limit determined by social acceptability to which such experiments are ALLOWED to continue, beyond which further research would be considered inhumane. Nonetheless, some nervous-systems can withstand greater quantities of stimuli than others, and all can even dilate their degree of tolerance based on the pleasure-pain principles. The Chaos Magician aspires to allow in the maximum amount of sensory- stimuli, and therefore seeks control over their pain-tolerance. The Toxic Magician finds the obtuse overstimulation an unfortunate and regrettable aspect of everyday life, and has evolved into pushing and pulling the sensory tolerances of others. Of course, at this point the Behavlorist would be frightened, confronted with the sight of their OWN role in the mirror of their subjects' blank slate minds. That is the difference, again, between the Chaos scientist and the Toxic general.Contrary to this. Behaviorism states that ONLY the physical, material world exists, and that, therefore, the subjective motives of a person CAN be approximated, but ONLY through examination of their physical behaviours, such as gestures, objects of attention, facial expressions, posture, etc. This is all well and good so long as it is applied ONLY to others, and not to the self, and this brings us back to the feeling of safety and self-security provided by adopting relative roles. As long as we pretend (whether to ourselves or to others) to ONLY be REacting to the behaviors of others, then our internal composure will be likewise protected from invasion. WRONG. Imagine the child who hides their eyes and pretends to become invisible to others: \"ifI can't see you, you can't see me.\" That is what the application of Behaviorism to others is like. In fact, the MOKE we adopt the materialistic, Behaviorist stance toward others, the LESS we can safely assume about their hidden psyche, and, thus, the more others may be subtly using us as a meat puppet. Behaviorism itself is based on the senses, and the senses are woefully incomplete, and often criminally deceptive, let alone the devices of the imagination. Only a human being could be so \"tragic\" as to conceive of themselves as Objective Observers. IIow robotic.It has only been relatively recently in the morass of recorded history that \"intellectuals\" have begun to accept the necessity of \"field research,\" let alone \"proactive\" role playing. That's merely all magic has ever really been: \"proactive” role playing. Consider a group of pagan occultists, how they dress differently, how they comport themselves differently, how they even SHOP differently from the majority of the masses. They are merely consciously modifying their self-presumed \"roles\" for themselves, rather than being merely relative to the dominant socially acceptable roles provided by the external environment or other materially deterministic factors such as DNA-primacy. Therefore science, naive child of the Church, raised under all of its parent's abusive dogma, has only just now, al ihe turn of the third millennium by its Father God's screwed up calendar, begun to tentatively propose such holistic theories as the Gaia hypothesis. Even these are considered \"fruity\" by the indoctrinated sheep of the State-Church dichotomy, and so still shunned.

Timothy Leary crafted a seven-dimensional \"game model\" to describe only a limited few of these types of manipulation-plays: Roles, Rules, Strategies, Goals, language, locations and Movements. These, of course, are merely an exterior projection inward upon this elite class of power brokers of the hope for a commonality of ideolect. Perhaps a timer way of defining these same seven principles, seen from an interior angle outward from within the mindset of this social elite, are those attributed to three Initiates of Hermes, one of whom was probably Paul Foster Case. These seven Hermetic Principles are Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration. Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender.Renowned Chaoiist, Robert Wilson, staled relatively early on in chaos literature that Chaos was lo be embraced as part of the whole and a necessary universal force, lie searched for an appropriate mythology for the subject and found the Graecian Eris, Goddess of chaos, discord, confusion, bureaucracy and international relations. Here it should be noted that the two most extreme of the five states are the chaos-initiate and the International affairs-Master, thus. also, international relations rules over bureaucracy, etc. The creation of these types of postulates, axioms, and mythologies is no different from the obsession with the accumulation of money.One obsession is ihe same as another, even (perhaps especially) if they seem to be complete opposites, such as the Haves/Have Nots, the Tops and Bottoms in BD/SM, Order and Chaos. The greatest illusion of all of them is the illusion of WAR. Now. the form of Psychic Warfare known as system-altering is best gone into in a subsequent essay. It applies a method known as the MONARCH Project, a \"low intensity conflict\" paradigm based on peripheral- or nonmilitary covert-operations.As quoted to reporter Anton Chaitkin of the Nov Federalist, former CIA director William Colby in regards to Project Monarch said, \"we slopped doing lhat between ihe lale 1%0's and early 1970's.\" (Ron Pallon, Project Monarch) With ihe quantum computer, containing circuit breakers the size of quanta and governed by the potential Superposition state of the probability itself, nearly prepared for release to the first-world consumers through the private sector research and development laboratories rented out by IBM and other corporate interests, implying, of course, governmental development, and reverse engineering for, at least five years prior, the mind is staggered at the vast resources of theory and applications which must have been accumulated since the time of Project Monarch's supposed decommissioning.

What can we learn about ourselves as nerves first, and then reapply to the nervous system of society as a whole, and then, to climb that ladder, what can be said of our galaxy as a nerve, and the universe itself as a brain, thinking only of itself, the so called Mind of God. that Waking Sleeper.Society began quite simply with the Night-Watch. The birth of consciousness was not some idyllic experience on some sunny day in the African plains among primitive humans crouched in Acacia tree tops. The birth of consciousness was a savage and sudden realisation which then somehow spread that life ends, and that survival was a constant struggle against an inevitable death. Small tribes of proto-hominids crouched in shallow caverns ala Kubrick, watching out for anyone who might be watching them. The first Shaman was the Night Watchman. He kept en guard while the rest of the primates slept. Consequently, during the day this situation was reversed. The young hunters and the women gatherers circled outward to form a front-line and backup regiment of defense to protect the sleeping Shaman-ape. The personal guard of the Shaman became the king-chief of the day-tribe. Eventually, with the beginning of agriculture, the Shaman’s usefulness faded into obscurity behind the fenced and walled in city-states. Those who once would have played the role of Star-Guardians were ridiculed and exiled, while the day-chief became the Priest King, claiming divine descent from the first monkey elite, and direct communion with the deified obsolescence of God Shaman. The rest is history.Nowadays, of course, we realise that what we need and everything else are not the same, but that same stubborn survival principle keeps up our inertial vanities. We ought to understand that there is what we NEED, and then there is what we WANT, and that we do NOT NEED as much as we WANT. Therefore, we don’t HAVE to have il! Not only this, the postmodern dcconslructionalism of phantasmagoric capital, but also there is ihe space age quandary of scientific progress the fact lhat we do NOT NEED as much as we can USE. This seems counterintuitive, but consider how much we use that we could as easily survive without. Simply because something is \"useful\" does not mean it is also necessarily \"needful.\" In fact, to go to the ultimate extreme of this line of reasoning, we do not even NEED so much of what we IX) NEED. We could easily get by with less survival-goods and convenience-services.But alas ihe law of supply and demand seems hopelessly lofiy lo the common man, so entrenched in somnolence are they.

The coming revolution, the autumn of civilisation as we know it, is probably going to be from the extraterrestrial heavens, true. A final failure, an explosion in space, and the loss of human lives below, possibly as a result. If it pulls down spirit with it, then who knows? Maybe our failure to leave a dying earth will bring about ragnarok, and a war in heaven, the fall of an alien race. Maybe a UFO will land and make our nearest neighbors, the W'atchers. known. Or maybe only then will a comet destroy us. Where are you now. alien Jesus? But until then, we still need the anti-hero to lead us on a smooth transition from fearing one another as villains to collectively participating in the grand international failure. The tragic life of Indiana Jones: to secure all ancient treasures and preserve them in museums, where all may look, and none may touch. National trasure, the tragedy of capitalism. Mere we see an iguana in a terrareum. Last of the Dinosaurs.The anti hero, alien proletariat though it may seem lo be now, is as useless a figure as Ilamlet without the motivation of its dead father's ghost. Now. is its father the past, the villain? Or is its father the future, the saviour? Aren't these really one and the same? Like day and night on the surface of a planet at the same time? As the seasons change, we choose to celebrate on certain days and nights the transitions between them. Some of these holidays arc celestial, nocturnal, based on ihe observation of the longest and shortest nights. Others are seasonal, annual and daylight ceremonies. How are these alike? One is celebrated while another is not, bui all shall be celebrated in the due lime of their order. Like the villain, the antihero and the saviour. While one is the saviour, the other is the villain, but as the saviour becomes the villain, the villain begins to appear first as an antihero, and then as a saviour. The savior needs a villain, and so as the old villain becomes the new saviour via the antihero, so do they choose a new villain.Take for example Christianity. Il prommoted itself as the religion of followers after the One True Savior. Now. this one true saviour needed a villain, or else from whal or whom would he be saving his followers? And so the earliest writers of the religion of the one true saviour, recognising this, set down a myth about the beast, or anti­christ. and the devil, ostensibly an anti god. Later writers would go on to Improve upon this story by contriving that the devil was disobedience to the plan laid out by the one true god. to follow the will of the one true saviour.

Of course, aplogists explain that God is infallible, and so blame the fall on Him, snce disobedience is an integral part of that same plan. People say this on both sides, not only atheists, but also Christians. This is compared with the myth of the one true saviour, that he was a martyr, or sacred scape goat, for the sins of his flock. Now, this sanctification perpetrated at the hands of the state and the church of the time marks Christ as comparable to the rebellious Lucifer who fell at the hands of God. In between them, lest we forget, is the manifestation of God in man. Adam. Lucifer's nemesis and Christ’s ancestor. So here we have hero, villain and antihero: Christ and Satan as apex and nadir, Adam ascending and Lucifer descending between them. Every once in a while all these characters move one notch in the same direction. When Adam was hero, Lucifer was villain. When Jesus was hero, Satan was villain, Lucifer and Adam were antiheros. So what comes next? Well, let's see. If Lucifer follows Satan and Jesus follows Adam, then when Adam falls, Lucifer rises, and when Christ is antihero, then anti-Christ will usher in the devil.What does it mean for Christ to be Anti-Hero? Does this mean he will be pit against those we consider heros? Will the sun be betrayed again by the zoo arc? No. for this is what brought Christ up, born and bred in the briar patch. This was when Christ was raised on high, transcending his antihero status. No, for Christ to fall from his lofty purchase upon the cross, this rotted, maggot festooned corpse must be supplanted by an even more radiant and glorious adept than he, in life, had been. And so, to save His soul. Adam's body must be cast into fire and burned. For. when Adam was the anti- hero which Satan will soon become, then Christ was the devil, and Satan was the King of Heaven. No, for Christ to fall, he must perceive himself as already fallen. He must examine himself, or else his life is not worth living. He must become self-conscious for pure consciousness to usurp the place now occupied by himself. The enemy is within. He is us. Like the moon circles the earth irregularly to the earth's rotation on its axis, and thus the rising and setting of the sun per deim, so is the body, manifest, the beast, the moon god. the mask or backparts, not always one with either the day. ruled by the sun, or the night, which it is said to rule. When one sees oneself as this, then one will fall from being the arisen sun-god. and will become just another person, just a citizen, a statistic and ultimately, just a corpse. For Christ, therefore, to become anti-hero, he must become mortal. He must be brought down to size. He must be like one of us. Married with Children. And this is what the aeon of Aiwass allows in. Married, buried. The mere fallen hero demonised, and so forth.Likewise, for Lucifer to arise from merely anti hero status to that of saviour, he must go through what Jesus went through, or, even more accurately, mimic what Christ is going through now. The war is with the self, the battle the body, and the Eve as wife. Like Satan before him. Lucifer must offer the apple of Eden to Eve. that she may become Mother Mary, the wife of Jesus the Christ. This draws down the body from the cross as it once had the spirit into the body. So soul arises as Sol sets. Day and Night, the Summer Solstice. Lucifer, the saviour, the light-bringer of spirit, the new hero follows from the fall of the creation. And so, from Lucifer's arrival, the devil-sun of Satan, the dog days of summer. Lucifer spring becomes Summer. Jesus summer becomes autumn. Adam autumn becomes winter. Satan winter becomes spring. And so seasons on days around the globe, and so aeons on the globe around the sun. Sun god becomes galaxy god. always central, until we fall off the edge of madness into chaos. The deadly Re’s of Sumer.Had only Christ’s disciples not eaten his bloody apple body.

The interaction of \"pseudo” time and Shadow Time is such thal, in each present-"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"tense event, which is reckoned as one Planck time in length, there is a collapsing Schroedinger wave-function from probability zero (impossibility) to probability one (certainty). The operant observer principle is not mentioned.\"Pseudo\" time interjects itself as upon a numberline which can be reckoned as the expanding lightcone of entropy, or the standard, forward flowing arrow of time. Shadow Time and \"pseudo\" time must be divided by something akin to a strange attractor, in order for the collapsed waveform of probability (<— img) to alternate, or spiral, around the Shadow Temporal axis.By replacing the simple wave function collapse along the present tense slice, or Poincare section. With a strange attractor (img —>), then we can see that the system acquires an increasing degree of freedom (Chaos), and in this way creates the opportunity for probabilities to assemble in random harmonic patterns from one present to the next.The results of this kind of model, wherein inversion is included, mainly deal with the constituent components of matter-energy quantum pair-bonds from one Planck lime to the next. 1-or example, the dircct relationship between probability one certainty and probability zero uncertainty.However, as Wilson points out (Quantum Psychology. 159). \"since quantum 'laws' do not have the absolute nature of Newtonian (or Aristotelian) laws, all quantum theory must use probabilities.\" He continues, \"the Aristotelian 'yes' or 0% and ’no’ or 100% represent the certitude Occidentals have traditionally sought. Quantum experiments refuse to yield such certitude, and we find ourselves always with some probability"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"between ()% and 100%.\" Hence this model theoretically represents a centurial gradient of probabilistic outcomes rather than plain binary.Since the present tense (\"psuedo\" time) strange attractors can connect to the immediately past or immediately future strange attractors (Shadow Time) it also represents the combination of six strange attractors (plus and minus for each present, negative and positive for past and for future) that, when graphed in three dimensions over time, as coordinate triplidtes plus spin, can be decomposed to form a 4-Matrix measuring the four possible probability states: \"yes.\" \"no.\" \"yes AND no.\" and \"NEITHER yes NOR no.\"This is one of the primary laws the manipulator-magician learns to govern: the Law of h-ony. NO MEANS YES. WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, WORK BRINGS FREEDOM. THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE: THE PRECEDING STATEMENT WAS FALSE, these examples of one-step self-referential impossible feedback loops combine variables of logic in formulae with doublethink mind-control as a coordinate pair in a Cartesian Graph. The Law of Irony exists perpendicular to this. Ironically, it also exists perpendicular to acausal synchronicity. Universal Irony is caused by a kind of crossing over by a digital information unit, or quantum probability, amongst the alternate paths of a strange attractor, otherwise known as an \"INVERSION.\" Inversion is the key to toxic chaos. Inversions occur constantly between the smallest physically scaled objects, and more slowly as one moves up the size scale. This constant static fuzz of changing partide-pixels creates an overall \"big picture\" of itself in a more highly-ordered, elegant clockwork. There are infinite inversions and there is one, and already this one is nothing.For example, the \"banishing ritual\" is merely an attempt to establish, admittedly, an inversion between the interior and the exterior relative to the self-definition of the magician by establishing a full-stop between the work and the space before and after it. Once this is established, usually via the tracing out with a staff or other such implement of certain geometrical figures, then the magician \"invokes\" or \"evokes\" archetypal representations of an intelligence within or beyond the scale of their self-affiliation, or their own assumed \"God form.\" To be able to communicate directly and most ergonomically with these intelligences drawn up from the depths of the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"memories of the magician, or drawn down from the most empyrean regions of their imaginations, sometimes the magician will have a partner-scribe who channels and/or records the interlocutor for the duration of the magician's conversation.Again, according to Manicheanism. the subjects pulled up from within the self-scale designated for the working (synonymous with the grades of their order) are considered closer to the vibrational frequencies of matter, and are therefore \"demonic.\" Those on the other hand, culled down from beyond the self-scale designated for the working are considered more aethyreal. However this overused mythological dualism will not serve the needs for many morally ambiguous types of melaprogramming. Afterall, the entire border established by banishing between in and out is arbitrary.As Above So Below is a factorial function of gravity, much as the infamous equation е-Мсл2. However this does not mean that, because this elemental force is unique among the now-known four in its orientation of direction that it should be considered, as it is in practical (>BLH. \"more Holy.\" If it is our flesh and brains that we arc cooking to death with the sub-photic wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation broadcast by our satellites, then why would our minds not be free lo expand outwards, in our astral form, through the astral layers represented by the four elements.Afterall. if truly ALL of what we perceive is filtered through our sensory organs, then the universe beyond them is virtually unknowable to us as corporeal sentient beings. It can only be speculated about vaguely using abstracts such as mathematics. We then reach out in the darkness to light the lamp of machinery. And yet, it is already morning.One of the primary memes among Toxic Magicians is the have/have-not inversion. Il is a popular misdirection that the free market represents nothing more than the plains of the Serrenghetti, and that the movements of capital is merely the rise and fall of the zebra population as they are fed upon by lions. Money has no value besides being a magical token representing power. For example. American currency is now based exclusively on debts \"owed\" to the US by diseased and impoverished third world countries. Therefore it makes the perfect leverage to penetrate someone's psyche.One common trait of the Toxic Magicians, whether they are \"haves\" or \"have nots.\" is that they have an increased logical and/or imaginative faculty. While the Toxic Haves spend their time understanding the \"game,\" as they call it, of money management and power relationships, the Toxic Have Nots usually assume the role of wandering mystics, questing indefinitely after mythical answers. They usually end up studying QBLII. QBLH, as a system of Order, is Toxic. However, to be able to USE QBLH. one has to be able to metaprogram their own reality as well as that of others in some meaningful way. beit consensus or personal. All the essence of (JBLH is is a substitute for money. It is merely another form of a power token.There is NO KNOWN form of a neurological virus. There is immunodeficiency virus, and there are genetic predisposition toward pathological behavior patterns, even disorders, and occasionally the random aneurism. However, there is NO KNOWN specific predator organism that preys solely upon the nervous system. Let me say that a third time. There is NO KNOWN form of a neurological virus.The neurological virus IS the human organism. We all revolve around our \"eternal\" search for approval-acceptance or dominancc-avoidance of other human organisms, whether we admit it to ourselves and others or not. We FEED upon information lo the fulfillment of these ends. We fill up our own memory with experiences and events where we \"won\" or where we \"lost\" at getting our way in ultimately infinitesimal"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"interpersonal social situations. We spread the diversity of our mental pathologies by attaching our sense of self to some experience or set thereof and multiplying it until it simply overpopulates all else surrounding it. This is why the study of self replicating patterns, such as impossible feedback loops, are so important to the study, and eventually to the breakthroughs that will occur, in the field of artificial intelligence. If we want to mechanically mimic how our own consciousness is hard­wired. then we must first admit that it begins as a basic unit, auto correlates, then supersaturates. It is not only mcmetic type information systems that are the one- track mind-killers of the obsessed, nor only the growth pattern of the human population that is so similar to the rate of expansion of a plague; human individuality itself is like a viral cell, and we propagate our Will to Power by the extermination of that of the Other. We are the infection and the host all at once. Patient Zero. And if we arc these things together, then perhaps we are also the cure. Chaos and Toxic Magic embrace such paradigms wholeheartedly. While Chaos ministers to this form of affliction. Psychopathy heals it.One thing all these axiomatic agreements of convenience have in common is their dependence on the morality of the virus. This differs specifically from the morality of the bacteria, which has only defense and propagation mechanisms, but no aggressive mechanism. It is, basically, this bacterial morality which Nietzsche identified as being \"Christian\" and, in essence, self defeating. For one thing, either of these factors alone can only rightly describe one half of any large population, and therefore neither oppressively enforced Christianity NOR reactionary anti- Christianity are a complete paradigm in and of themselves. They depend, symbolically, on each other, not only for a complete, objective analysis of whole systems, but for their very' survival. Chaos obliterates bacterial morality.Psychopathy overthrows viral hierarchies.The nervous system itself bears resemblances to a multi cellular virus. For this reason, elsewhere. I have postulated that neurological life forms may be hybrid species of originally single celled protoplasms, and that viral, and therefore even neurological, forms of sentience may exist elsewhere than on planet earth. I have also otherwise stated the similarity of the filaments, walls and voids comprised of nebulae, galaxies and clusters of stars, planets and asteroids to a complex neural net. This suggests that, not only might the viral component of our symbiotic species be extraterrestrial in origin, but the entire form and function thereof might be a universal template of superstructures on all scales. This returns us again to the concept of the Universal Mind, and proposes similarities for further research between the extension of our neurelectrical sense of self to the utmost limits of cosmic forces as God Forms.Again, at the other end of this spectrum we come back from the nerve and nervous system as viral lo the similarities between the social individual lo a nerve cell and ihe social system as a whole to a nervous system. To further build up the idea of the social whole as a nervous system we can discuss such terms as the \"patron deity\" of a city slate (represented, usually, by its respective priest king in early Sumeria); the \"soul\" of a \"place\" or its cultural essence, mood or flavour (its weather patterns, architecture, ambiance); the \"Patriotic Spirit\" of a modern nation (often with flags representing the pride of its citizens): crowd-control and riot suppression: the rumour mongering media: mass psychology: sociopolitical, economical and anihropo-cultural ideological philosophies; and ultimately ihe \"mind of man\" as the averaged homogeneity of our species' evolution, all other things being equal. Each of these levels functions relative to and depends upon the others, and the complete sum of these is usually discussed only by identification of the roles played by its"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"constituent components, or, in other words, it is talked about by talking about everything OTHER than what it actually IS.To go one small step further than this, we can question the degree to which such an interconnected type of interpersonal/global network of interactivity might evolve as a unique kind of organism of its own, a kind of \"collective unconscious\" as lung called it. a kind of sodal-A.I. Is the mind of mankind really only unconscious, as our autonomic nervous system is unconscious? Does it merely regulate its own physiological functions? Or has it matured from the intelligence level of an ameba or an infant to that of a toddler, or perhaps a spider or an insect? And. if this is even POSSIBLE, then WILL society ITSELF eventually WILL itself into complete self awareness? If it did. would it seek out harmonic holism with the remainder of its self­similar. universal systems, or would it prefer to go to war with its cosmic pangenitor? How would it make that CHOICE?One observation which immediately springs to my mind is that neaurelectrical potential is nol constant. Il diminishes over distance/duration, and these pulses of energy form the irregular states of \"brain waves.\" This is simply because electrical energy is diminished by conduction. I hope it is safe enough to assume we have all had our field-trip to and school tour of a science museum, and we have all played part in the demonstration where we join hands to form a closed or open circuit and had a low-level pulse of electricity passed through us. While the person at the end closest to the diode feels a shock, the person at the negative end of the open circuit feels merely a slight tingle. This is a good enough model of the convection of electricity through a nervous system. However, if this were all there were to it, then we would have no Action Potential, and no. what Freud identified as, \"consciousness.\" Mo. we require a form of HYPE RC ATI! EXIS, or additional residual charge, if we want to pass energy through such a circuit. In the human nervous system this is accomplished by cognizant carrier cells of sensory information. However, in a nervous system comprised OF humans the same effect must be accomplished by physical stimulus response. In other words, when one nerve conveys a greater amount of information to the next than was conveyed to it by the previous nerve in a closed system, it does not mean that new energy has been \"created\" but implies that new energy has been acquired from somewhere, external to the system. Likewise, in a nervous system comprised of human beings as nerve cells, the sensory apparati must be overloaded beyond the pain tolerance threshold for additional information to be propagated through the rest of the system. One way to accomplish this is torture. Another is sex. EXTREMES of experience. CHAOS.Consider this simple thought experiment: you and two of your friends want to role- play a think-tank, to brainstorm new ideas. One of you pretends to be a doctor, one of you pretends lo be a soldier, and one of you pretends to be a politician. First, choose a subject you all already agree on. Then choose one which you each see differently. Which conversation proved more productive? Next imagine you are three National Socialists discussing the \"Jewish question.\" Then pretend you are three American capitalists, divided by class background into specialised sectors, and discuss \"population control.\" Which conversation proved more productive? It is nol. this lesson might illustrate to you more personally, competition which drives progress. It is cooperation. Hixation upon a single goal with as little disagreement as possible between the working parties.

This is equivalent to the extraction of surplus labour, however occurs when even so much as only very slight stress above the artificially diminished tolerance level occurs. When karma is inverted, that is. expanded such that manifestation can occur through it, it occurs as upon a digital monitor. Now, the extra karma which enters is manifestation the manipulation of quantum information units. Hence, to manifest, one must also exchange an equivalent rate of exteriorised karma in place of the manifestation. However, as before stated, this does not occur as a free trade, but rather, as a percentage or proportion, for such is the exchange rate on imports/exports. Therefore, the exchange of a proportion of interiorised karma for a manifestation within karma, altering the quanta thereof, results in the dispersal of said ratio of karma, stress or energy, into an exteriorised manifestation outside of one's karmic interactivity, ergo aura, altering the quanta thereof. The result of this exchange between the input of new digital data and the output of resultant entropy is approximately equivalent to a subliminal suggestion. A lateral party will move through the projected mental transmission's radiative zone and the patterned codex of information will simply blend into the static of background noise to them. It will, however, affect negatively their overall reception of (and therefore also transmission of) subsequent information via this system.Now, such \"displaced karma\" can, itself, be intentionally guided, and, ultimately, placed under control. This simply is not the case for one's own displacement of karma, for the simple reason lhat this amount of surplus karma would over stimulate their sensory-screening software by a degree even if only slightly greater than their most basic pain tolerance. Therefore, it is only possible to focus on the karma which is being displaced ONTO you from others, and. by following these messages back to their sources, to attempt to program the codes which control them. When done in a fastidiously rigorous manner, then there is a unique and specific methodology which will arise. This methodology is known as Monarch Mind Control.Now, Monarch effects the spaces between people's auras in much ihe same way as unknown variables effect Hilbert Space between quantum particles. While we can only speculate about the types of fourth dimensional movements that govern the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"topology of quantum information units, and then apply chaos equations upon them (o postulate about (heir super positions. Monarch is a project to which A) greater amounts of time. B) greater amounts of participants, and C) a more rigorous methodology, have been applied to create, rather than mere speculation, a meta­program that WORKS, that is based not on rough approximations, vague predictions and Uncertainty, but on \"results.\"Since the body is the fundamental root of the auric system, then it is ultimately through the seven chakra spiral at the center of the energy-torus that the mental defenses are usually, and most effectively, breached. The concept of the CORE or root trauma is then used as an ANCHOR for other subsequent depth psychological work.However, this presents an entire host of problems, from the far-philosophical such as the material primacy of consciousness, to the far-practical, such as that long- range workings upon a system then become dependent on material, or, as in psychic affairs, quasi-material communication modes. Of course, motive and motif are inextricably linked, and we cannot discount the value of direct, face-to-face interaction between an Operator and their System, and, in some cases, this should become such an unfortunate necessity that all the requisite memory pruning apparati. from hypnosis to drugs, to sex. to conditioned response, etc. etc. etc. may all have to be brought into play, and Monarch is hardly short on masterful techniques by which to accomplish this much respected form of the craft.Despite this, what shall be endeavored to be dealt with in the context of this exposition are other similar techniques which can be accomplished long-distance, and by an individual Operator functioning autonomously of the Monarch document's proposed Illuminati.The use of actual encrypted sequences of seemingly unimportant and irrelevant numerical information as a proposed language in which to deal with the Mind or Aura once one is inside of that of another is a brilliantly useful idea, and shall not go discounted here. This acts as an \"unlocking\" exercise to pass between the \"mental\" layers of conditioning or the \"auric\" layers of the physical body's personal electromagnetic field. Of course, once one has passed through the necessary coded unlocking/locking sequences, then one proceeds, in a similar basic programming language, to alter the surroundings; \"mentally” this amounts to the utilisation of the system of perceived \"alters.\" while \"aurically\" this amounts to the exchange rate of quantum Information vortices.Monarch covers a wide variety of different systemisations for the exploitation of the mental conditioning of \"alters,\" such as grouping them according to a flow chart. It should nol be overlooked that this is an identical proposal to that of Phil Hine, Ihe Chaos Magician, regarding the programming of Servitors, that such a flow chart could, further, be postulated as identical to that of a self replicating computer virus program. \"Developing this idea led to the creation of extremely detailed flowcharts.\" writes Hine on page 119 of Condensed Chaos, \"with 'controller' Servitors commanding subroutines and subprograms formed from Servitors given specific tasks within an overall program.\" \"Because of the competition and distrust between the different programmers, they often place in secret back doors into the person's mind that only they know about.\" (MONARCH, 556)However, as stated before, much of this involves physical behaviour and therefore requires physical conditioning, and. for greatest effectiveness, physical input of command codes. That is. that this level of programming delves into the neuralectrical"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"concents of che brain icself, within the karmic stalk of the body. However, if one sees the electromagnetic field as an outgrowth of the material physique, or as a hologram of che mind, then one can see how some of these same effects can be accomplished \"at-a-distance.\"Lee us perceive of (his electromagnetic field as like a newly quarried stone, or as like an embryonic cell which we can divide and multiply in complexity. И is merely a \"target\" for our \"remote viewing\" at this point. Mow, we can condition this reflexive plasma to assume the structural forms we superimpose on it. In this way we create a \"memory castle\" or \"mental storage map.\" This functions like an interactive environment such as a bureau with many drawers or a computer network with many access ports. \"Later in the book, che art of building structures internally in the mind of che victim will be covered.\" (MONARCH, 572) As we have seen, the interior of the aura is merely a holographic exteriorisalion of the interior workings of the mind.As was discussed earlier, che manifestation of surplus karma (quanta) entering che digital field of one's aura (personal electromagnetic field) is equal to Che hypercathexis of the background noise subliminal suggestions comprised of coded sequences of data (quanta) displaced by the same process from the aura of another. This is to say that, as in Freud's model of phi as the variable representing the system of cathexis, now known to be comprised alcernacingly of chemical neurocransmiccers and electromagnetic pulses of electricity, among nerves in a closed system, so too does stimuli build up upon the threshold of the horizon of awareness until hypercathexis occurs, a process similar to super saturation in crystalising chemical fluids. In hypercathexis, Che surplus sCimuli. or stress, of the additional digital information eventually builds up until a slightly larger than usual charge is carried over to the next nerve in the closed net. Freud postulated that this additional phi- variable. this additional karma, constituted the willpower or the \"personality\" of the cellular-system. So. it may be expostulated, perhaps just as the filtration of additional vibrations within a nervous system implies the potential for sentience, the projection of this behavior onto the personal electromagnetic field of ihe entire cellular-syslem itself such lhal il acts holographically like a single nerve in a greater system of cathetic communication may even imply thal, at least in a merely electromagnetic way, then population clusters may indeed be seen equally as a form of proto-sentience.This process of karma being built up gradually, and then suddenly transferred, and apparently at random, between one aura in this meta-system and another is already a form of communication utilised by ihe few as a means of relaying messages ihrough (he many. In ihe same manner as one can melaprogram the behavioral cues of the body by manipulating (he system of a \"target's\" mind, so, too, can one create a consensus \"tunnel reality\" by utilising this \"universal mind\" or \"collective unconsciousness\" comprised of the network of all linked auras of sentlcnts on earth to impose the will of even only one single aspirant upon the very quantum fabric of the space-time continuum itself by interaction with che non-sencienc electromagnetic fields on all larger global, solar, galactic and universal scales.This conglomerate field I have called elsewhere, \"ihe Enochian Communications System.\" and ihe field which is perpetually one greater than ihis ihe \"akashic records,\" for short hand notation. Now, the Enochian Communications System (ECS) represents the \"memory castle\" superimposed on the interior (or exterior) side of the aura as it replicates itself, according to the aforementioned type of viral programming, throughout the complete system of the \"collective unconscious\" of all known sentients. The Akasic Records, then, are the self-similar network of all non-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"sentient electromagnetic fields comprising as much as the rest of the entire known universe.

I propose elsewhere that, to look at one of these at a corner is to see a torus, or four-point, and to look at one above an edge is to see a tesseract, or relatively regular four-spatial shape. These arc not, of course, perfect; they are, however, a product of harmonic averaging. By studying the shapes of these, and then making the memory castle reflect their properties, we can create a better resonance for sustained communication between (he ECS and the Akasic Records.The purpose of the existence of the EC’S and the Akashic Records is simply for them to be used. And they do prove to be as useful on greater scales as do the basis for the formal system of the memoiy castle, the logical six fundamental questions of reasoning, in (his third dimensional material and fourth (emporal energy level in which we (end (o perceive (hat we exist.

Again, this is little different, if at all, than the practise by Medieval Eastern occult orders, such as the Chinese Tongs, the Hindu Thugees. or the Japanese Ninjas. By stifling their own emotions, they seek to achieve oneness with, or at the very least to allow their bodies to become better conduits for, some all-pervasive ethereal energy force, known diversely as the Chi. It should be noted briefly here that this ('.hi energy is the same medium as that of the Aura, and lhat this is essentially Ihe same concept as the Soul of ihe human individual.However, in recent and increasingly socially complex times, ihe mere suppression of emotion seems to be a fading aspiration. Now. it is necessary not only be able to switch emotional reactions off. but also on. to gain the mastery of the craft needed to navigate through the intricate labyrinth of modern society.Therefore we must return lo the material at hand in regards to emotional programming, and here we find, again, and somewhat disappointingly, lhal ihe primary field of research into this modus operendi has been to obfuscate or to Confuse the basic emotional reactions with the subtle physiological reactions of the peripheral, or the autonomous, nervous system. In short, to condition, for example. LOVE, one sets down a rigorous methodology to operate upon the pleasure principle, providing, usually, rewards of a decidedly sexual nature, however sublimatlonal. Likewise, to condition, for example, FEAR, one sets down a self-similar pattern for operation upon ihe system based on ihe pain/avoidance circuit, providing, usually, punishments of a decidedly survival-based nature, however cathartic.It is somewhat telling of the philosophies underlying the art and practise of Soul Control that it approaches the problem of emotional conditioning essentially similarly to how one would approach putting gasoline into an automobile. In order to drive (operate) the vehicle (system), one finds it regrettably necessary to occasionally have to refuel (emotionally condition) it in order to be able to force it to follow one’s instructions. This may be seen as a tacitly understood concession to the powers lhat we have not yet quite got complete control over. The consumer of gas has very little say in ihe determination of gas-prices, and, likewise, the syslem- programmer has very little say in the limited number of possible emotion reactions With which they have lo deal. It should not, of course, at this point be postulated as a concession made to some fictitious god-concept. but merely to a higher ascended Master in an assumed God-Form.Equivalently, the art and practise of Spirit Control ought to be thought of as being as precise as lhal of Mind Control has become, however, due lo the supcrimposilion of ihe Golden Division on the imaginary complexion of the interior workings of the individual human by ihe ancient Master. Plato, then ihe entire field remains relatively unexplored. It is as though the upper echelons of this perceived, or pseudo, hierarchy have been considered off-limits for so long that they resemble, by now. an old. abandoned wing of a mental institution, still haunted by the ghosts of past experiments gone wrong, understaffed, if at all, and gradually fading into utter obscurity.Il is further telling of the philosophies underlying this dying ari lhat they focus most often in modern times on death and eschalology. The resurgence among self help and \"healing\" circles has been the prevalent obsession with death and dying, confer Freud's Oedipus Complex, the arduous exercises of Kubler-Uoss. Jung's archetyping and Campbell's mythologising of the subject. Leary and Grofrs preoccupation with ancient, \"lost\" systems of passing over, etc. Death itself is in vogue."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"This usually takes the more benign form of inputting self-destruct sequences for completed programs by operators on a system, however the additional layer of conditioning required by some systems of so-called \"End Times\" programming (the Janus-Alex Callbacks listed on pages 548, 9 of the Monarch document) is extremely telling of the philosophies underlying the methodology. These terminate-system codes arc usually the most complex form of programming, and yet are also considered to be extremely common. \"Most slaves have end time programming. When a slave is called in with end time programming they have pages upon pages of coded messages.\" (MONARCH, 548)Now, according to Monarch, such death-codes are necessary for the pruning of the system's sum of alters. \"There are several groups of alters which get charted separate from the rest or don’t get charted at all.\" (MONARCH, 556) Hor example, \"alters made to deal with one-time emergency will just slip into cracks in the system.\" (MONARCH,557) While A list alters are those which serve the survival instinct of the system and the Will of the Operator best, there are a whole host of sub routine alters created by the system as coping mechanism, by the Operator as occasional or emergency behavior-command codes, or even by other, competing Operators within one system.However, since there is no known waste mechanism by which to dispense permanently of these unnecessary alters within a closed system, then, as before, we run the risk of a hypercathetic buildup of surplus data. Eventually, it can be speculated, enough of these repressed alters can rise up counterproduCtively to the dominant programming simply by creating a form of psychic friction against the input of access codes etc. Here we find that, to fall back on emotional conditioning, or Soul Work, often eases the viscosity of such inconvenient forms of resistance. Yet still, this problem of waste-material produced by the system has not been properly addressed. \"Lots of odds and ends alters end up in the nooks and crannies within a system just detached and floating.\" (MONARCH, 5S7)One aspect of Soul and Spirit Control that should not be discarded is their equivalency to the ECS and the Akasic Records. The \"Soul\" is governed by the emotions, and occupies the realm of the subconscious mind, such as is accessed by dreams or light trance. The \"Spirit\" is governed by archetypes in mythologies, which can be graphed as 4-space geometries, and occupies the realm of the unconscious mind, such that it interacts with non-senticnts, accessed by delta-wave brain states characteristic of deep-trance. Therefore, if one wants to control these seeming abstractions of the human condition, then one need merely apply the ECS and Akasha, just as, to control the Mind, one need only apply the Monarch system. Hence, Monarch, the ECS, and the Akasa can be thought of as merely three iterations within one larger system. This system, not to put too fine a point on it, would be, at least by the majority of the masses, considered, in its full scope, as equivalent ot the mind of God.\"An alter is a dissociated part of the mind, which is developed BY the programmers to be a complete personality.\" (MONARCH, 269) \"In terms of programming, each dissociated fragment of the mind may be molded into something. Some fragments lend themselves to be molded into full personalities, and some lend themselves into being molded into single purpose fragments, and some must be discarded.\"(MONARCH, 262) \"That alter is really an alter with many shadows of itself. This is a family of fragments of that alter which hold parts of itself.\" (MONARCH, 269)To look at this realistically, an \"alter\" is simply an offshoot of the original personality, or a \"fragment\" of that personality, which branches off during an"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"\"altered\" state of consciousness. This occurs when, through sensory overload to the point of passage beyond the pain tolerance threshold, a certain as pea of the prevalent ihoughl-pattcrn at the time becomes frozen in stasis within one's karma- memory. Once this crystallised shard is identified by the Programmer, it can then be expanded upon and complexified such that it achieves a more well rounded, fleshed out parameter for self definition. This \"karma memory\" exists outside of the system's conscious mind. It is, essentially, an imprint upon pure probabilities.\"Alters that were created at the same time and left in an area of the System together are families.\" (MONARCH, 267) \"In order to use the multiple in different life styles- they divide up a system of alters into worlds of alters which rarely see each other. These worlds are also called cities. The words \"city\" or \"world\" are interchangeable when il comes to a Monarch System.\" (MONARCH, 267,8) \"During the Monarch Programming an average System will have at least 1,000 alters.” (MONARCH, 262)\"Just like in a city, some people have friends and know others, and other people are strangers and enemies, so it is with an Illuminati system of multiples. Some alters may be aware of each other, and some may even hate each other.\" (MONARCH, 263)The concept of the \"city\" of alters is clearly the next exponent in the mental conditioning of the system, and ihus should be compared lo the realm of ihe Soul.Now, since I have here and elsewhere postulated the Soul, or ihe Aura, as an electromagnetic field, comprised of quantum units of karmic probabilities, then we can see lhal the fleshing out and complexificalion of the \"karma memory\" is to be taken quite literally. Just as the mind, making use of the thalamus of the brain, has certain projective capabilities upon material reality, so too do the fractured components of the conditioned mind of the system. They project from the deep subconscious, and thus are exteriorised as subtle reflections which are usually only noticed by the system on a subconscious level. Herein arc ihe primary' operator codes expressed by Ihe programming alters and resolved via the conduit of ihe sensory apparali. This feedback loop between ihe mind and the physical environment is noi limited lo mere suggestion, but further psychically selects one probable outcome for any event situation over another, and in this way guides the system through all manner of social situations. The \"city\" within is the same as the \"world\" without.\"Control is the operation mode of a control system which includes two subsystems: controlling (a controller) C, and controlled. S. They interact, but there is a difference between ihe adion of С on S, and the action of S on C. The controller С may change Ihe state of the controlled system S in any way, including the destruction of S. The action of S on С is formation of a perception of system S in the controller C.\"(Turchin. Heylighen, Joslyn.

The elevator is constructed as a piece of DNA and alters can ride up and down the elevator (go up or down in trance) to move when allowed.\" (MONARCH. 267) \"On the chart, the programmer will have a square on a grid where he will record the cult name, the front name, the alter’s alpha-numeric pull up code and its grid number.\" (MONARCH, 268) \"S-P-l-N = Segmented Polycenlric Integrated Networks: If one were to diagram a SPIN organizational charl il would noi be a conventional box type"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"configuration such as an army company organization chart. Rather, it would resemble a fishnet with interlocking nodes with groups linked to many other groups and cluster around nodes. There is no center lo the network. It is like the brain’s electrical connections, with an overlap of functions, so that good cells can take over from damaged sections.\" (MONARCH, 274.5}This model of the mind is basically twofold, and carries us neatly into certain spiritual factors. Now. the former, and presumably earlier and elder model is based on a Cartesian coordinate grid for a two or a three dimensional space. Since each of the component parts of this triple-axis number line are calculated as according to a variable string of numbers, or access code, then, not only do we have the spin vectors of the fractional vortices, but also a complete, multi-dimensional- hexadedmal (at least) matrix by which lo express ihe same movements over lime numerically. Hence, we see that the \"elevator\" could be measured as ihe orthogonal V3 diagonal of this cube. Since the whole apparatus moves over lime on several structural levels, it is easy to see how the next form of model came about.The later, SPIN, model is more organic and gnomonic. Since it is the fourth-spatial dimensional representation of the sum of the movements inherent in the previous model, and since these patterns each and all possess asymptotic freedom (the hypercathexis of karma described earlier), then iheir sum would nol be a compact and regular form, but more of a strange attractor. A model of all the movements potentially inherent in the Mengele 3 model outlined above would, thus, only be able to be mapped as a Poincare section as a fractal. This ennegram's rough approximation, when projected as a multidimensional lattice, of its environment is indicative of the harmonious resonance of forces. This occurs not only between the, perpetually approaching exactitude, simulation of the 4-space model with the brain, but also with the approximation of mind and matter, the essence of control, and hence, with the entire remaining summation of Ihe universe. The stacking upon slack of layers of strange attraclor-like patterns of spin-coding is presently thought lo be the ten dimensions of Calabi Yau shapes which, when themselves viewed by adding the dimension of lime, vibrate to form the sum over history of a super symmetric string, which gives String Theory physics its name. Hence the models for the brain (the SPIN model) and that of the mind (the Mengele 3) of the psychological system, are approximately (at least) equivalent to the Akasic Records and the ECS, respectively.\"Most people are still unfamiliar with multiplicity and their rigid thinking is challenged by the concept lhai one mind can have several personalities.\" (MONARCH, 2f>2) Much less, imagine the potential fracturing of the collective psyche inherent in admission of the possibility that the Universe itself is a single Mind. Another way of looking at the chaos geometries of the memory castle metaprogram is archetypally, even anthropomorphically. through from the Vedic waking sleeper, KaliShiva. the destroyer-creator, through DesCartes’ dreaming demon, whose delusions we are, to the Holoiropic Mind theory of Stan Croff and the Holographic Universe theory of Michael Talbol. These forms explore interactions wilh one another over time as well. The sum over histories of these chaos geometries of the auric ECS and ihe number matrix of the Akasic continuum are akin to the mythological world in which habitate the archetypes of the emotions. So. if the Universal Mind, the perception of the Creator, can be postulated as capable of being thus fractured between a level of mythological spirit and one of an emotional soul, let alone further fractalised into potentially limitless mental-systems, then it can be postulated as capable of being meta-programmed, and thus, controlled."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"As to the similarities and differences between the \"interior\" alters in a mental system and the \"exterior\" manifestations of Otherness in material reality, in some instances, such as during a meta-programming session, it becomes useful for the Operator to blur these lines between ihe mental city of alters, ihe soul, aura or ECS, and the spiritual AkasiC Records. When the system is pul into an \"altered\" state, then it is frequently convenient to cause the distinction between reality and hallucination lo break down. and. in extreme cases, to force this to continue until sensory overload is achieved, resulting in a dissociative state, at which point programming may commence. Sometimes alters are built up into full-fledged visual and auditory hallucinations which seem to interact with the alpha-personality in ordinary reality such that this condition carries on indefinitely. In essence, the conditioning of a system first destroys and then re-imposes ihe limitations lhat determine between ihe phantasm of memories and imaginings and the apparently more solid and grounded apparitions of the present moment, of the here and now. However, for the sake of Standard operations, it is convenient lo act as if such barriers, or inversions, do indeed exist, at least within, and even if only for. the system.\"While the peiturbations resisted in a control relation can originate either inside (e.g. functioning errors or quantum fluctuations) or outside of the system (e.g. attack by a predator or changes in the weather), functionally we can treat them as if they all come from the same, external source.\" (Heylighen, Joslyn, 13) This \"functional\" external locus is the Controller, or Meta Programmer relative to a psychological system. However where the internal and external modes of a regular system have collapsed under operant obseiver principle into a steady state, as is necessarily common, then the external modes become much more diverse than the perceived (though probably not actual) interior state. In this case, then the alpha-personality is buffeted by what it understands as \"perturbations\" to the environment of its internal/external self-definition. Essentially, these are ihe subliminally messaged command-codes mentioned earlier. However, they impact upon the aura of the mental-syslem as inversions between negative/positive probabilities.While the alpha personality (at the time) should not recognise it, these \"perturbations\" can also be interpreted, and rightly so. as \"signs.\" According to Charles Sanders Pierce, \"a sign is something that stands to somebody for something in some respect.\" The study of such semiconscious signs and symbols of interpersonal behavioural interactions became known as Semiotics. Jake Horsely, in his book Matrix Warrior, page SI, defines the opposite of this — “a humalon is basically a collective, made up of 'tics.' reflexes to the coniinuous barrage of stimuli provided by the matrix program itself.\" (Horsley, SI) Such semiconscious \"signs\" are directly relative, as cause to effect, to the eternally recurring \"fragments,\" or semi unconscious \"tics,\" of a \"humaton\" or \"psychological system.\"Out of Semiotics came the study of cybernetics, or the study of information-patterns or sign-systems. \"Probably the most important innovation of cybernetics is its explanation of goal-di reeled ness or purpose... Goal-directedness implies regulation of— or control over — perturbations.\" (Heylighen, Joslyn, 11) This premise basically states that some arbitrary, external \"goal\" is subsumed via control over perturbations lo become the new, internal \"state\" of the system. \"Perturbations wilh high variety affect the system's internal state, which should be kept as close as possible to the goal state, and therefore exhibit a low variety. Control or regulation is most fundamentally formulated as a reduction of variety.... So in a sense control prevents the transmission of variety from environment to system.\" (Heylighen. Jocyln, 15) In olher words, control occurs when it limits the amount of internal variety of a system, which is accomplished via implementation of a goal. \"A humaton has no self or"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"identity to speak of. but rather consists of an arrangement of thoughts, beliefs and habits < preprogram mod responses), units of information which consistently reshuffle themselves in order to remain stable and create a sense of unity and purpose.\" (Horsley. 81)\"An autonomous system, such as an organism, or a person, can be characterized by the fact that it pursues its own goals, resisting obstructions from the environment that would make it deviate from its preferred state of affairs.\" {Ileylighen, Jodyn. 12} However, if we shift our point of view around from being inside to being outside of such a system, then we can begin to question the degree to which it truly is autonomous, or self-controlling. For example, Horsley continues, \"Humatons do not think for themselves. Their so called 'minds' are actually intricate recordings on a loop of endless repetition.\" Consider the mysterious, command code carrier perturbations as being filtered into, and thus mirrored by and defining the image of. the internal composure of the psychological system.According to some modern cyberneticists, the only way to counter the exponentially proliferating external or environmental variables which can serve to destabilise the control of an interior system is to bring about a method of self-replication for the internal feedback loop at the root of conscious self awareness. In other words, to alter the system along the lines of fractal or chaotic complexity. “In active regulation only variety can destroy variety. This principle has important implications for practical situations: since the variety of perturbations a system can potentially be confronted with is unlimited, we should always try to maximize its internal variety (or diversity), so as to be optimally prepared for any foreseeable or unforeseeable contingency.\" (Ileylighen, Joslyn, 15) This type of anticipatory, rather than merely reactive, conditioning of obedience is essential to real-world situations, where most systems, even the Monarch method, counter perturbations only with the possibility of creating new alters. Rather, each alter must have a certain degree of self preservation in order to maintain not only their role in a system, but also their capacity to self-repllcate. Most perturbations encountered by a system in the everyday environment do not require the system to propagate new alters, as they do not surpass the pain threshold. The alters, therefore, carry on about their business internally to a system while in direct relation to the primary system's encounters with mundane perturbations. \"The variations, as such, seem infinite, to the point that most humatons never suspect that (heir thoughts are merely copies or reruns of previous thoughts, most of which are not even their own. Since they have no means of comparison, they never realise that their much treasured individuality is merely the construct of a collective matrix, and that all constructs consist of the same basic components.\" (Horsley. 81)Therefore, what we see in the everyday person, and what we seek to create for a controlled system, is a set of alters which variegates itself perpetually, no single one being primarily responsible for the primary autonomic goals of survival and procreation, but these goals being intuned to the system itself such that, no matter what alter might find itself the dominant personality in a given situation, these goals remain active for them without apparent loss of stability. In other words, this smoothes over the transition from one alter to the next such that the system itself, and, perhaps even more importantly, any other outside observer, would never even notice that one alter has been substituted for another. This allows the system to be altered even in public situations.However, what this means for the internal system is that it will continue to self divide and complexify even while dormant to the dominant personality. To return to"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the metaphor of the city, within that Matrix people go on about their daily business, and even have children, without knowing they are part of a single, guided, system.This form of self correction is equivalent to rehabilitation within the incarceration paradigm of modern prisons. These interior factors of daily life mirror, as said, the perturbations to the whole-system from the external environment, such that the one need never know about the very existence of the other. In fact, says the cybernetic theory, the more complex one side of the equation becomes, the more complex the other side of the equation will likewise become. The system never solves for zero.In effect, the more complex the environmental situation, the more alters will be created to maintain equilibrium. Likewise, the more complex the interior system, the more chaotic the environmental situations will be into which the system will thrust itself, despite any individual alter merely feeling itself being thrust. The more- complex the stimulus, especially above the pain threshold, the more rapidly a system creates alters, even without knowing it: the more complex the system of control behind any one moment's dominant personality, the more it will seek out extreme external conditions.This is an absolute good, since the most desired system lo be created is: A) extroverted, even to the point of being a \"good leader,\" and B) creative, not only in problem solving, but also in methods of influencing other people, even dominating the modus of environmental stimuli. So. the question becomes, knowing that complex stimuli and a complex system are directly proportionate, and that the seeming autonomy of a system derives from its complexity, then how does one control a system such that it will meet the conditions of extroversion and creativity? This is. actually, quite simple, and should already be intuitive based on the preceding material. One need only cause a system to overload once, impute a complex system of self-managing alters to the fractured alpha personality, and then suggest subtle forms of manipulation subsequently. If one establishes the primacy of a complicated system, then it will self correct through any subsequent suggestion.The best methods of this derive, initially, from cybernetics, where subsequent suggestions propagate memetically. The collection of all such systems falls under the umbrella title of Project MONARCH. This does not mean to suggest, of course, that the only forms of such systemitsation derive from cybernetics, and that Monarch is one to one wilh the sum of modern cybernetic research alone. Monarch is infinitely more than merely cybernetic research specifically because the models for its implanted systems derive from all schools of systemology. This means lhat the \"city\" of alters established by Monarch conditioning is. at its most effective, based on whatever is the most complex method of hierarchy even only theoretically being researched in any field soever.Now, while the systems of cybernetics are still considered cuuing-cdge among oulside researchers of Monarch, within the order of Monarch method practitioners, cybernetics is considered hopeless oversimplified lo be workable in most modern situations. Therefore, since Monarch's cornerstone is to start with the most complicated system for control available and then modify it through subsequent conditioning. Monarch looks forward toward not only artificial intelligence schools such ;is cybernetics and advanced communication theories such as memetics, but beyond these as well. One such example of the forward thinking of Monarch is the potential application to its methodology of artificial intelligence schools such as atomic-machincs (post nano-tech's molecular machines) and unheard of communication theories such as spherical encryption systems."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE OvEftTOOL - A U Nr/E PS At.

Consider, for example, the cybernetic mind of an altered system. As stated, the more the mental system resembles the neurological systems of the brain itself, the more effective, one-to-one they will be, in effect, not even mind-control anymore, but specifically brain- control. While nanotech offers a means of controlling the cellular automata of neurons and glia and their constituent electrochemicals themselves, atomic machines offer a means of building patterns from the very quantum fabric of atoms forming molecules which form the cells of the brain. While modern neurological psychology has only been, thus far. prepared to accept a correlation between the electrochemical cascades of neurotransmitters between nerve cells and the thoughts and emotions of the mind, atomic-machine systematic^ proposes the possible capacity for correlation between the trigger-mechanisms for these cascades, the \"ennegrams\" or morphogenic fields\" which precede and cause them, and quantum structures Within the brain itself, and thus, moreover, account for the hitherto mysterious actions of free Will and choice. While nanotech and bio psych offer means of making the brain into a programmable machine, atomic-machinery and Monarch propose methods for building free-thoughts within such a machine out of pure quantum uncertainty.

Basically, for the lay person, what this means is that mathematical relationships are graphed as shapes, and then these shapes are plotted onto surfaces, such as a sphere, from which the method derives its name. The goal of this is to determine how many such polygons can be plotted on a surface, such as a sphere, without overlap. The result, then, is to determine the meanings of the prerequisite input variables by taking the surface apart, mapping it. and studying the relationships of the polygons. For example, say we have a simple three-dimensional sphere. Map onto this sphere a fourth­dimensional fractal shadow of a fifth dimensional polygon. Express a sixth dimensional matrix as the variables plotted on this polygonal lattice. The result is an example of an 18 dimensional encryption system. The usage of such multidimensional systems in the Monarch method should be obvious. When spherical encryption of a control hierarchy is utilised on the mind, it stimulates the creation, by reflection, of an atomic-machine system of moving-relationships. or circuits, within the brain itself. Working upon the mental encryption system, the atomic- machinery of the brain works.The initial creation of such a complex and dynamic system within the mind of a subject, and therefore the implementation within the system of creativity and extroversion not only of the dominant personality but among its entire constellation of alters, might seem counterintuitive if the sole motive of the Monarch system is understood to be obedience. It might seem, at first glance, that the breakdown of a subject is more important than their building-up. and that one should place their system in a constant position of intimidation. This is. to put it bluntly, what is accomplished by the equilibrium of stimulation and syslemisalion. The more a system is called upon to think for themselves, the more they will believe themselves \"free\" and thus fail to decondition themselves from the Monarch method. Hence, the more stimuli a system is presented with, the more overloaded it will be with options for \"free\" will. These options, however, are purely illusory. since the stimuli are controlled and delimited: they represent merely misdirection to keep the system thinking about other things than itself. In other words, again, active freedom of the will is passive slavery of the mind. The more the system is thinking about survival and procreation, the less focused it will be on the basic fight-or-flight instinct. The more a system controls itself, and, by extension of this, brings others under its control, the more controlled it is by others.\"Control is controlled by its need to control.\" In other words, the best method for imposing external control on a system is to condition it to thinking that it is choosing its own methods of control for itself. One method for doing so is by distending the pain tolerance threshold. At first, a system will think only of its programmers. Eventually, it will identify with them. Ultimately, it will actually become one of them. This is done by alteration of pleasure and pain, punishment and reward, always being increased slightly and by increments. The longer this process is continued, the faster the programme can be run, until, finally, all becomes a blur, and pleasure pain, reward punishment all break down into a state of asymptotic freedom. When this is accomplished, the system will think only what the controller wishes, and"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"believe it is thinking these things for itself. Absolute control by a programmer and absolute freedom for their system are synonymous. The greater the degree of perceived autonomy of a system, the easier and more subtly they will be able to be altered.N. J. .4 Sloe atTo make all this more easily understood. Imagine an \"unconscious’ mental alter as a car driven by its emotional Fragments. Simple conditioning can control the movements of the alter, such as the trinary stoplights at circuitry-intersections.More complex destinations and origins lor these alters, such as buildings (suburban homes and in town offices), are merely collections ol such stop and ro conditioning circuits, and these are known as alomic-machines, populating the \"subconscious\" mind. A group ol alomic-machines comprises a complete \"city\" system, or \"ego.\" The mapping ol main ’’city' systems onto an encrypted sphere would represent the \"world\" system of a Monarch humaton, otherwise thought of as their whole \"self.\"One of the primary goals of system creation is making instinctual motives dependent on conditioning. As stated, the flght-or-flight mechanism of the survival instinct can be altered into a dominant produce-consume compulsion and a subordinate dog- eat-dog obsession. As we have seen, the more complicated a system, and. therefore, the more in equilibrium il is with environmental perturbations, the more il will preserve this status quo, and in this way continue. So, it is not really the instinct of the subject themselves to survive, but the veracity of their imposed system, thal seeks out means of supporting itself and prolonging its existence. The system is alive, while the humaton is merely living. This is why the Monarch system encourages \"creativity:\" so that it can not only anticipate the necessities of control, but so that"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"these reflexes can become \"second nature,\" so deeply ingrained that the system believes itself to be independent.Likewise, the instinct to procreate can be altered into the desire, and even lust, to propagate the dominant control system. For example, the existentialist understanding of life-after-death is that it is one's ideas themselves, the intellectual offspring, which survive after the death of a physical vessel. This segues nicely into the discussion of system proliferation, which we shall call \"cloning.\" The instinct, if one can even more than philosophically be proven to exist, to procreate and produce physical offspring is sublimated under Monarch method conditioning to the inculcation of others within the sphere of an individual's influence into the system of controlled and conditioned behavior. \"Cloning\" has successfully occurred when one subject brings another subject into the auspices of the Monarch method, such that a composite of the initial system may then be grafted. As always, this system subsumes the preexistent instincts.Until now, what we have considered are the primary motives and methods of the system as a whole, and we have not specified why alters are considered a necessity. Alters are used to carry out different specific functions relative to the day-to-day hustle and bustle of the primary system. For example, one alter might be useful in data processing, while another might be useful in general system analysis. Both of these are needful if the system is being applied towards such actions as reconnaissance and tactical observations. For each useful alter to the present programme of a system, it is also wise to create a small subsystem of seemingly non useful alters to serve as backup. The expression \"cover me\" is applicable here, since these backup alters will seem to serve no practical purpose to the mission, but will act. instead, as camouflage. Offensive alters, such as tactical operatives, are best suppressed for the majority of durations, while such defensive alters seem to be dominant most of the time. For example. Hitler thought he was a painter, however mediocre, though, through certain triggers, this perception of himself became altered into something wildly different. \"Trained reflexes die hard,\" is a motto of Monarch conditioning.Also, up to this point, we have dealt primarily with the Monarch method for creating an MPI). This should not be taken to mean that MPI) is necessarily the most effective form of inducing mlnd-control. There are literally a limitless amount of psychological disorders, many not even yet diagnosed as such by private sector clinicians, which can be applied not only to alters, but to whole systems. The best mind-control system is invisible both internally and externally. The best system of mind-conlrol is one that is fully functional within any social situation, autonomous, even desirable to potential clones. The best system of mind control considers itself to be \"normal,\" \"healthy\" and \"free.\"For example, elsewhere I go into in more detail social-conditioning disorders such as melancholy, manic-deprcssion, obsession-compulsion and paranoid schizophrenia as forerunners leading up to and into full-blown MPD. All of these \"disorders\" can result from everyday, mundane situations within modern society. When these types of situations are recursive, or when exposure to their underlying stimuli becomes prolonged, then the subject will not even be able lo tell the difference between life without them and life with them, let alone to distinguish between their psychological effects and the conditions of the psyche before being exposed to them. Since society is built on the induction of such effects, it becomes increasingly apparent to its citizens that its sole function is to produce mind-control slaves. As this realisation sinks into the mind of the average person, they become melancholy, morose, and"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"flat affective. From this condition, the mind control begins to take root, as the person oscillates with Increasing rapidity between manic \"free\" will and depressed resignation to their presumed \"slavery.\" These moods manifest its mental obsessions and behavioural compulsions. Once the subject has confirmed to themselves that they are pari of a global conspiracy to control their individual mind, it is quite right lo label them paranoid schizophrenic. Once ihcir sense of self as center of said conspiracy has been abandoned, then their personality splits, and they form a system. As I have explicitly stated, this can occur in modern society Without the intervention of an operator, programmer, handler or caseworker. It can occur spontaneously on its own. Such is one of the benefits of our modern society: it creates people prone to Monarch.These people, who are prone to Monarch, are easily clinically diagnosable. Commissioned by the APA (American Psychiatric Association) and NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), the DSM-IV (fourth diagnostic and statistical manual) applies a V' Axis diagnostic system. According to the Digby Tantum Centre, University of Sheffield, there are significant social concerns raised by such \"psychoptahy checklists,\" and according to many, all the diagnostic definitions utilised by the DSM- IV raise serious philosophical concerns.\"Wakefield (1992, 1999) argues that mental disorders are biological dysfunctions that are also harmful, implying (hat the concept of menial disorder necessarily involves both a scientific or biomedical criterion (dysfunction) and an explicit value judgment or sociopolitical criterion (what he calls harm and the WHO refers to as handicap). This view is attractive because il meets the main requirement of both the sociopolitical and the biomedical camps.... Wakefield originally proposed that dysfunction should imply the failure of a biological mechanism to perform a natural f unction for which it had been designed by evolution, but Lilienfeld and Marino (199S) and Kirmayer and Young (1999) subsequently pointed out that this evolutionary perspective raises many problems. Too little is known about the evolution of most of the higher cerebral functions whose malfunctioning probably underlies many mental disorders.\" (Kupfer, First, Regier, f>)In other words, the people who are prone to, or susceptible to. programming or conditioning by the Monarch method are the same people who would be attracted towards its utilisation over others. These people, in short psychopaths, sociopaths, antisocial personality disorder types, are merely prone to being programmed in the Monarch method because they would be more susceptible to \"cloning\" the specific system for the Controller. Afterall, he who thinks he is controlling is the easiest to control.As slated previously, the ultimate system of Control is one which is considered, which considers itself, and which, therefore, causes its host to be considered, \"healthy.\" \"sterile.\" even \"curative.\" Thus, this method of control is implanted in those who wish to reprogram themselves as a means and method by which to do so. and in those who wish to learn \"success\" through the programming of others. What is accomplished for these people is the achievement of some simulated form of equilibrium between the Will of Ihe Self and the perturbations of the environment. In short, ihe Program works FOR them. And. in this way, they are made to work FOR the Program.To sustain this perceived equilibrium, which is. for all practical usage, synonymous with the pain tolerance threshold, ordinary \"humatons\" will manifest a wide variety of reactive, socially retrogressive behaviours which are clinically classifiable as disorders. If \"backed into a corner,\" even if by the bad planning of their own"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"designs, the average socialised western business person will reveal traits which those who have known them their entire lives would not likely expect. These defensive postures are much more a person’s true state and natural condition than their otherwise recited speech, rehearsed gestures, and learned behaviour. It is at these moments of weakness that conditioning is best recommended.It is no more nor less easy to break a \"humalon\" from their routines and send them into a spinning frenzy of panic than it is to manipulate them subtly from such a state into that of a totally brainwashed servitor. In fact, it can even be reasoned, and quite easily as well, that the average person is only waiting for such to occur for them.Although, perhaps this tacit understanding of the \"humaton\" as the statistical average, and thus, of the malleable and manipulative as the offset minorities acting outside of and upon the mainstream, has served its purpose long enough, and is no longer a necessary deception. The truth is, and has always been, that this \"humaton\" condition of the socialised western business person is a facade, a shroud behind which hides the obvious: Monarch programming, merely dormant, nascent, waiting to take effect. However, what does this mean for these \"humatons,\" \"sheeple,\" or human cattle.\" the \"masses\" who consider themselves free though are merely blissfully unaware, and who consider themselves healthy, though are really merely puppets?Well, it is an old adage that if we do not fight against something then that something will overpower us. However, perhaps now it is time to begin asking if this is the case. For example, the longer the weak struggle against the strong, the stronger the weak will become, until eventually the one group will exchange places with the other, and the same bullying that has always occurred will continue unabated. This is no way to fight a system, or a pattern of behaviour.Perhaps, instead, what ought to be considered advisable is indifference. It is not per sc accurate to speculate that if the weak cease to resist the strong that the strong will rise up, outnumber them, overpower them and wipe them from the face of the earth. It is their resistance against which the Strong maintain their fitness. In this way, that is, by resisting an implied threat, that the weak are snookered into serving the strong. The strong are so ONLY because they are thus served by the weak. If the weak cease struggling, the strong will become as weak as well. Rather than the world's resources being gobbled up rapidly by the ravenous veracity of the power-mongers, the entire world could learn to live forever off a single grain of rice. Indifference is the key.It is only by backing away from and refusing to participate in it that can break a routine habit. It is the same way that a behaviour pattern can be changed. Also a system of thinking. Also a culture of control. And ultimately whole social structures can be toppled simply by people refusing to support them. From changing the mind from a state of either-or thinking to a state of both-and thinking, we can break free of linear reasoning, which warps into a cycle of abuse around the gravity well of self-doubt, and, moreover, by changing our minds, so too change our souls, and broaden the horizons of our very spirits themselves. It is possible to change the world, even if only one person at a time. And there is no shame in being the first one that you know of to start. Soon you will meet others who have been through what you have, and have come to the same conclusions. The complexity of the mind is astounding, and is in a one-to-one relationship with the diversity of life experience."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"I), on the Cremation of CareCompared by nay-sayers to a Klan rally, and by well- wishers to the ancient Druids, the Cremation ceremony should not rightly be confused with such pastimes of bored sportsmen nor to more arcane origins; a \"stand alone\" ritual en soi, the Cremation seems to be a direct outgrowth of the Thoreau inspired philosophies of the camp's own early founders, the self-styled Northern Californian Bohemian Art enclaves and experimental occultists. In its concentration upon the ideals of naturalist escapism and hence antisocial connotations, the Cremation should be seen as incomparable to the human hunt or to the worship of cosmic time exclusive.It is specifically entrenched in the mindset of the twentieth century, despite the fact that it attempts to remove that very mindset by barkening back to bygone times. For this reason, the Cremation cannot be modernised for the twenty-first century, such as being turned instead into a laser-light show, nor can it be improved upon or altered one jot or tittle. It is retrogressive, and draws its very potency from what rightly ought to be identified as radical conservativism.This should be seen, and is identified by doubters, as ISO degrees opposite fundamentalist evangelism. In fact, the high security surrounding the Cremation negates its evangelical potential, while ils neological terminology- for its archetypes separates it duly from the fundamentalism of Judeao Christianity and its tired litany of names and phrases. Its value system, however, should not therefore be seen as a corruption, nor even distinct from, thal of the major world religions.The Cremation represents, rather, more of a culmination of the goals of all the world's major religions. It is, to put none too fine a cap on it, a psychological transformation for its members no different from Buddhistic meditation, Hindu Durges or the (\"alls to Prayer of Islam, nor even the Catholic Mass. This is not meant to be taken as an apology for the Cremation, though it is frequently misunderstood by non-participants, both Bohemians and others.Hor example, many slanderously misleading articles about the Grove have been written depicting it as like a summer-camp or a vacation retreat for its members. If the purpose of the Grove were to serve as an event of debaucherous revelry alone, then there would be no need for the Cremation to be presented ritualistically. It is clearly present to sanctify, in the most highest sense, the nature of the proceedings.Now, as to the rightful survey of the archetypes of its invocation, it is important to note the pronounced detachment of the mock sacrifice. Performed behind curtains obscuring it from the actual proceedings, much as part of Crowley’s elusive Elusinian Mysteries, ihe mock-sacrifice, it should be dutifully remembered, is not performed to appease the Owl to whom the actual, subsequent cremation itself is offered. The mock sacrifice is performed, instead, lo destroy the archetype of Dull Care. Dull Care then remands this operation as useless, since Dull Care cannot be destroyed.So. let us pause momentarily to consider the purpose of the mock-sacrifice. In most rituals, there is some form of tension-breaking used to recollect the attention of the audience. The degree of this may at first appear extreme if one were lo compare the Cremation's mock-sacrifice to, again, the hymns sung by choirs at Mass, however to"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"grasp the difference one must examine more thoroughly the nature of the relevant archetypes. Hull Care is personified as the enemy to be fought the remainder of the year round. This establishment of an adversary is not at all alien to the Christian disposition either, however its presence is not often included in the more mundane celebrations of Christ. It does rear its head in such occasional and overt catharses as the Inquisition or the Crusades however, wherein years of repressed aggression against some imagined threat are released with bloodshed and immolations.The mock-sacriflce to ward of Dull Care is. then, just such a redirection of the participant's focus from their own Cares for their Dull life before and after the Cremation. It should not be seen as anything more malevolent than this.Now, as we have seen that the mock-sacrifice is purely an internal mechanism to the ritual ceremony itself, we may examine the role of the Bohemian Owl. The Bohemian Owl, spoken for by the sung lyrics of the choir, acts much like the Chorus of the ancient Greek theatre. It Intervenes on behalf of the participants of the Cremation, at the behest of the Priests, and guarantees them a respite from the evil Dull Care. Conclusively, the pyrotechnic launched at the skiff which initiates the Cremation proper from the towering figure of the Bohemian Owl serves as a IX-us Ex Machina, or God-Machine, lo actively signify the dominion, at least temporarily, of the Bohemian Owl over Dull Care, or rather, more appropriately, the Bohemian philosophy over the Dullness of everyday Cares.There are two themes that should also be noted in the actual delivery of the spoken portion of the ceremony.One is the technique of the reversal of fortune, that is. the following of a long series of softly intoned and positively reinforced adjectives describing the natural setting of the Grove itself with a less pleasant, even awkward, negative psychological reinforcement. Some examples of this are \"weaving spiders,\" \"blind eyes with carrion,\" and \"her breasts that had been bruised.\"Another technique is repetition, or repetition with modification. The repetition of \"fools\" by Dull Care, of \"no fire,\" \"one flame...\" and \"a pure eternal flame\" by the Owl Chorus are examples of the simple chanting technique for lulling consciousness into a semi-hypnotic state. Other examples of repetition with modification include the dream theme, wherein the motif of the ceremony itself as a dream or as dreamlike is gradually built up using vague rhetoric. This theme is introduced with the phrase \"it is a dream, and yet, not all a dream.\" It is then continued by Dull Care with the accusation to the participants, \"fools to dream ye conquer care,\" countered by the priest-representatives with the reiteration that \"it is not all a dream.\" The phrase offered initially by the orator, \"by the power of your fellowship. Dull Care is slain.\" is supplemented subsequently by the statement of the Bohemian Owl regarding \"the lamp of fellowship,\" and this then is drawn out by extension as \"fellowship’s eternal flame.\" The conclusive remark admits its own recursive nature, \"once again, midsummer sets us free.\"Now, it is interesting, though perhaps too much need not be read into it, that there are two denoted antecedents to the adjective \"eternal.\" The first to be introduced is beauty, by which the Bohemian is meant to understand the priest to mean nature, an implied understanding illustrated eloquently by the subsequent soliloquy. The initial statement to this effect is \"beauty is eternal and we bow to beauty everlasting.\" Following from this, it is explained, \"for lasting happiness we turn to one alone. She that surrounds you now, great nature.\" The other \"eternal\" attribute follows only at"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"the end. It is Introduced by the Bohemian Owl as \"a pure eternal flame,\" and then explained by the priest as being, as mentioned, \"fellowship's eternal flame.\" Much can be understood by examining Dull Care’s relationship (o these two polar ideas of eternity, for when he says lhat \"me ye cannot slay.\" it directly contradicts the priest’s preceding remark, lhat \"by the power of your fellowship. Dull Care is slain.\" Therefore, when banished by the Cremation for the duration of the proceedings, yet \"when again ye turn your faces to the marketplace, do ye not find me waiting as of old?\" does Dull Care perhaps represent a form of relncarnative pattern within and beneath the otherwise unalterable and unchanging permanence of \"eternity?\"Perhaps Dull Care is like a pathology in the mind of God?The opposite of Care is not, as may be expected, pure indifference, but \"eternal\" fellowship. Perhaps there is some more than merely minor irony implied between ihe \"well loved names of gallant friends,\" those \"dear, boon companions of long ago,\" brought back by memories and transformed into “forest folk,\" and Dull Care, who, though banished and exiled for a time, will only return again to battle the noble Bohemians once their revelries have ended. Their predecessors speak as the chorus of the Bohemian Owl, while Care has but one voice only.Ultimately, the respite from Dull Care is confined lo the duration of ihe festivities initiated by the Cremation ceremony, and is, therein, presented as only temporary'. Ileauiy. the Bohemian Fellowship, and even Dull Care itself may be more or less \"eternal\" according to the Cremation ceremony's oration, but freedom is fleeting with time. \"Say thou mocking spirit, it is not all a dream. We know thou waitest for us. When this our sylvan holiday has ended, we shall meet thee and figlu thee as of old. and some of us will prevail against thee, and some of us you will destroy. But this too we know: year after year, within this happy grove, our fellowship bans thee for a space.\" And so it is said to be, \"at last, within the lamp of fellowship, upon (he altar of Bohemia.\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"ihe image on this page is copyright. 1996, by Steve Savedow, and can be found on page 74 of bis work \"Goetic Evocation, The Magician's Workbook, Volume I,\" in the edition that was printed by Fschaton Books In Chicago, Illinois, USA."}]
