They all have onething in common-homage to the elements truly representativeof the other side.The Devil and his works have long assumed many forms.Until recently, to Catholics, Protestants were devils. To Protes-tants, Catholics were devils. To both, Jews were devils. To theOriental, the Westerner was a devil. To the American setder ofthe Old West, the Red Man was a devil. Man's ugly habit ofelevating himself by defaming others is an unfortunate phe-nomenon, yet apparently necessary to his emotional well-being.Though these precepts are diminishing in power, to virtuallyeveryone some group represents evil incarnate. Yet if a humanbeing ever thinks that someone else considers him wrong, or evil,or expendable in the affairs of the world, that thought is quicklybanished. Few wish to carry the stigma of villain.But wait We are experiencing one of those unique periodsin history when the villain consistently becomes heroic. The cultof the anti-hero has exalted the rebel and the malefactor.Because man does little in moderation, selective acceptanceof new and revolutionary themes is nonexistent. Consequentlyall is chaos, and anything goes, however irrational, that is againstestablished policy. Causes are a dime a dozen. Rebellion forrebellion's sake often takes precedent over genuine need forchange. The opposite has become desirable, hence this becomes theAge of Satan.Dire as this appears, yet when the dust of the battlessettles what truly needed changing will have been changed. Thesacrifices will have been offered, human and otherwise, so thatlong-range development might continue, and stability return.Such is the odyssey of the twentieth century. The accelerationof man's development has reached an epic point of change. Theevasive theologies of the immediate past were necessary tosustain the human race while the higher man developed hisdreams and materialized his plans, until the frozen sperm ofhis magical child could be born upon the earth. The child hasemerged in the form of Satan-the opposite."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The cold and hungry of the past produced offspring to tillthe fields and work the mills. Their cold will stop and theirhunger shall end, but they will produce fewer children, for theby-product of the magician's frozen seed which has been bornupon the earth will perform the tasks of the human offspringof the past. Now it is the higher man's role to produce thechildren of the future. Quality is now more important thanquantity. One cherished child who can create will be moreimportant than ten who can produce-or fifty who can believe!The existence of the man-god will be apparent to even thesimplest, who will see the miracles of his creativity. The oldbelief that a supreme being created man and man's thinkingbrain will be recognized as an illogical sham.It is altogether too easy to dismiss Satanism as a totalinvention of the Christian Church. It is said that the principlesof Satanism did not exist before sectarian propaganda inventedSatan. Historically, the word Satan did not have a villainousmeaning before Christianity.The \"safe\" schools of witchcraft, with their strict adherenceto their horned-god-fertility-symbol syndrome, consider thewords Devil and Satan anathema. They disclaim any associa-tion. They wish no comparisons to be drawn linking their Mur-rayite-Gardnerian-\"neo-pagan\"-\"traditional\" beliefs withDiabolism. They have expunged Devil arid Satan from theirvocabulary, and have waged a tireless campaign to give dignityto the word witch, though that has always been synonymouswith nefarious activity, whether as witch, or hexe, or venifica, orother. They wholeheartedly accept the Christian evaluation ofthe word Satan at face value, and ignore the fact that the termbecame synonymous with evil simply because it was (a) ofHebrew origin, and anything Jewish was of the Devil, and(b) because it meant adversary or opposite.With all the debate over the origin of the word witch,and the clear origins of the word Satan one would think thatlogic would rule, and Satan would be accepted as a moresensibly explained label.* Even if one recognizes the characterinversion employed in changing Pan (the good guy) into Satan(the bad guy), why reject an old friend just because he bearsa new name and unjustified stigma? Why do so many still feelit mandatory to disavow any connection with what might beclassed as Satanic, yet increasingly use each and every one ofthe arts that were for centuries considered Satan's? Why doesthe scientist, whose academic and laboratory forebears sufferedfrom accusations of heresy, mouth platitudes of Christianrighteousness in one breath, while dismissing the concept of*Controversy over the origin of the English word witch is valid whenone considers the etymology of the term in other languages: venifica(Latin), hexe (German), streghe (Italian), etc. Only in its English formhas the word assumed a benign origin: wicca, purportedly meaning \"wise.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Any debate must center on recent claims that advance a positive andsocially acceptable meaning for a term that has in all ages and mostlanguages, meant \"poisoner,\" \"frightener,\" \"enchanter,'' \"spell-caster,\" or\"evil woman.\"Anthropologists have shown that even in primitive societies notably theAzande, the definition of witch carries malevolent connotations. Therefore,are we to assume that the only \"good\" witchet in the world were Englishwitches? This, however, becomes difficult to accept when one considers theterm wizard, which stems from the Middle English wysard = wise, versusthe Old English wican = to bend, from whence witch is supposedly de-rived. All in all, it seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to legitimatize aword that probably originated by onomatopoeia-the formation of a wordthat sounds like what it is intended to mean!Satan in the next, when the man of science owes his heritage towhat had for hundreds of years been relegated to Devildom?The answers to these questions can be reduced to a singlebitter charge: they cannot afford to admit to an affinity withanything that bears the name of Satan, for to do so wouldnecessitate turning in their good-guy badges. What is evenworse, the followers of the \"Witchcraft-NOT-Satanism!\" schoolharbor the same need to elevate themselves by denigrating othersas do their Christian brethren, from whom they claim emancipa-tion.The rites in this book call the names of devils-devils of allshapes, sizes and inclinations. The names are used with deliber-ate and appreciative awareness, for if one can pull aside thecurtain of fear and enter the Kingdom of Shadows, the eyeswill soon become accustomed and many strange and wonderfultruths will be seen.If one is truly good inside he can call the names of theGods of the Abyss with freedom from guilt and immunity fromharm. The resultant feeling will be most gratifying. But there isno turning back. Here are the Rites of Lucifer ... for thosewho dare remove their mantles of self-righteousness.Anton Szandor LaVeyThe Church of Satan25 December VI Anno SatanasCONCERNING THE RITUALSCONCERNING THE RITUALSFantasy plays an important part in any religious curricu-lum, for the subjective mind is less discriminating about thequality of its food than it is about the taste. The religious ritesof Satanism differ from those of other faiths in that fantasy isnot employed to control the practitioners of the rites. Theingredients of Satanic ritual are not designed to hold thecelebrant in thrall, but rather to serve his goals. Thus, fantasyis utilized as a magic weapon by the individual rather than by"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the system. This is not meant to imply that there are not, northere will not exist, those who will claim dedication to Satanismas an identity while continuing to be manipulated unknowinglyfrom without.The essence of Satanic ritual, and Satanism itself, if takenup out of logic rather than desperation, is to objectively enterinto a subjective state. It must be realized, however, that humanbehavior is almost totally motivated by subjective impulse. It isdifficult therefore, to try to be objective once the emotions haveestablished their preferences. Since man is the only animal whocan lie to himself and believe it, he must consciously strive forsome degree of self-awareness. Inasmuch as ritual magic isdependent upon emotional intensity for success, all manner ofemotion producing devices must be employed in its practice.The basic ingredients in the casting of a spell can becategorized as desire, timing, imagery, direction, and balance.Each of these is explained in the author's prior work, TheSatanic Bible. The material contained in this volume representsthe type of Satanic rite which has been employed in the past forspecialized productive or destructive ends.It will be observed that a pervasive element of paradoxtuns throughout the rituals contained herein. Up is down,pleasure is pain, darkness is light, slavery is freedom, madnessis sanity, etc. In keeping with the very semantic and etymologi-cal meanings of Satan, situations, sensations and values areoften inverted and reversed. This is not intended solely toserve as blasphemy-on the contrary, it is used to make it ap-parent that things are not always as they seem and that nostandard can or should be deified, for under the proper condi-tions any standard can be changed.Because Satanic Ritual so often exerts such change, bothwithin the chamber and as an aftermath in the outside world,it is easy to assume that the upside-down cross and the Lord'sPrayer recited backwards* usually linked with the Black Massare also synonymous with Satanism. This generalization iscorrect in theory, since Satanism indeed represents the oppositeviewpoint, and as such acts as a catalyst for change. The fact is,throughout history a \"bad guy\" has been needed so that thosewho are \"right\" can flourish. It was to be expected that thefirst Messes Noirs would institute reversals of existing liturgy,thus reinforcing the original blasphemy of heretical thought.Modern Satanism realizes man's need for an \"other side,\"and has realistically accepted that polarity-at least within theconfines of a ritual chamber. Thus a Satanic chamber can serve-depending upon the degree of embellishment and the extentof the acts within-as a meditation chamber for the entertain-ment of unspoken thoughts, or a veritable palace of perversity.Ceremonies such as the German Wahsinn der Logischactually weld the concepts of Satanism and the manifestations"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of insanity into a total assumption of the role of needed socialadversary. This phenomenon has been eloquently defined by* Inaccurate assumption; the traditional Messe Noir employsa parody of Matthew 6:9 rather than a word-order inversion.psychiatrist Thomas S. Szasz in The Manufacture of Madness.Wherever this polarity of opposites exists, there is balance,life, and evolution. Where it is lacking, disintegration, extinctionand decay ensue. It is high time that people learned that withoutopposites, vitality wanes. Yet opposite has long been synony-mous with bad. Despite the prevalence of adages like \"Variety isthe spice of life.\"-\"It takes all kinds . . .\"-'The grass isalways greener . . .\" many people still automatically condemnwhatever is opposite as \"evil\"Action and reaction, cause and effect, are the bases ofeverything in the known universe. Yet when automobiles aregenerally large, it is said \"no one will ever drive a small car,\"or when hem lines go up, \"they'll never wear long dressesagain,\" etc. The mere fact that the smugness-and boredom-of the populace rests on the mantra, \"It'll never happen!\"indicates to the magician that he must avoid such thinking. Inmagic the unexpected occurs-with such regularity, in fact, thatit is safe to say that to dwell on anything too long is to con-sume it.Magic is a push/pull situation, like the universe itself.While one is pushing, he cannot pull. The purpose in ritual isto \"push\" the desired result within a unique span of time andspace, then move away and \"pull\" by divorcing oneself fromall thoughts and related acts previously ritualized.The productions contained here fall into two distinctcategories: rituals, which are directed towards a specific end thatthe performer desires; and ceremonies, which are pageants pay-ing homage to or commemorating an event, aspect of life,admired personage, or declaration of faith. Generally, a ritualis used to attain, while a ceremony serves to sustain.For example, the traditional Black Mass would incorrectlybe considered a ceremony-a pageant of blasphemy. Actuallyit is usually entered into for a personal need to purge oneself,via overcompensation, of inhibiting guilts imposed by Christiandogma. Thus it is a ritual. If a Black Mass is performed bycuriosity seekers or \"for fun,\" it becomes a party.What constitutes the difference between a Satanic ceremonyand a play presented by a theatre group? Often very little:mainly it hinges on the degree of acceptance on the part of theaudience. It is of little consequence whether an outside audiencedoes or does not accept the substance of a Satanic ceremony:the strange and grotesque always has a large and enthusiasticaudience. Murders sell more newspapers than garden-club"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"meetings. However, it is important to consider the needs of theparticipants: those who need Satanic ceremony most are theleast likely to let themselves go before an audience of thecurious.Unlike encounter groups, the purpose of most Satanicceremonies is to elevate the self rather than demean it. Encoun-ter \"therapy\" is founded on the premise that if one is reducedin stature by another, who in turn has been reduced, all willhave a firm foundation upon which to build. In theory this isadmirable, for those who prefer to have someone else insultand browbeat them. They attain thereby a rather dubious formof recognition. For the masochistically inclined, encountergroups do provide a source of punishment and recognition. Butwhat of those who have established an identity, those who arewinners in the world, and have pride and rational self-interest,yet who possess the desire to express unpopular thoughts?A ceremonial chamber essentially provides a stage for aperformer who wishes complete acceptance from his audience.The audience becomes, in fact, part of the show. It has becomefashionable in recent years to incorporate the audience intotheatrical performances. This started with audience participa-tion, with selected members of the audience called up to thestage to assist a performer in his role. Gradually this developedto such a degree that entire audiences mingled with the castStill, there can be no assurance that an audience will participateas a result of genuine enthusiasm, or merely because they areexpected-or coerced-to do so.A ceremony is dependent upon total single-mindedness ofpurpose on the part of all persons present. Even commemora-tive pageants of a public nature suffer from divergence ofthought and emotion during the festivities. A Fourth of July orMardi Gras festival has a definite reason for its existence, yethow many participants maintain an awareness of its raisond'etre while revelling? The festival becomes only an excuse, soto speak-a theme upon which to base social needs. Unfortu-nately, too many arcane and occult ceremonies and rituals windup as just such excuses for social (and sexual) intercourse.An important point to remember in the practice of anymagic ritual or ceremony is: if you depend upon the activitieswithin the chamber to provide or sustain a social climate, theensuing energy-conscious or otherwise-directed toward theseends will negate any results you wish to obtain through theritual! The line is fine between the desirability for close rapportbetween participants, and one's need per se for close rapport.The ritual will suffer if there is a single person in thechamber who drains the substance from it by his ulteriormotives. Hence it is better to have three participants who are\"with it\" than twenty who are and three who are not. The mosteffective rituals are often the most solitary. This is why it is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"preposterous to attempt a ritual or ceremony with outsiderspresent who happen to be \"sincerely interested\" or \"want tofind out more about it\" or \"want to see what it's like.\"A philosophical commitment is a prerequisite for ac-ceptance into ritualistic activities, and this serves as a rudimen-tary screening process for organized Satanism. Consequently, adegree of compatibility-necessary to a successful working-exists within the chamber. Of course, anyone can say, \"Ibelieve,\" simply to gain access. It will be up to the discerningmagician to determine actual sincerity. Because Lesser Magicis everyday magic, a finely attuned sense of discrimination isessential for all accomplishment. In addition, one of the mostimportant \"commandments\" of Satanism is: Satanism demandsstudy-not worship!This book was, for the most part, written because theauthor believes that ritual magic should be removed from thesealed vacuum in which it has been held by occultists. Scantyean ago, The Satanic Bible first publicly advanced magicaltechniques and working procedures utilizing sexual energy andother emotional responses. Since then many volumes haveappeared that give identical principles, in both technical andesoteric jargon. It is expected that the precedent established bythe present work will likewise \"free\" others to reveal \"hiddenmysteries.\"Why, it will be asked, is it deemed feasible to make theserituals public knowledge? Primarily because the demand is great-not only from curiosity-seekers, but from those who thirst formore than what is offered by the recent outpourings of pseudo-Cabbalistic, crypto-Christian writing. Another reason for thisbook is that there are many recent awesome discoveries whichgive the sorcerer new tools with which to experiment. That isalso why it is now \"safe'1 to advance much of the presentmaterial.A third reason, and perhaps the most important of all, isthat magic-like life itself-produces what one puts into itThis principle can be observed in countless facets of humanbehavior. Human beings invariably treat things (property,other persons, etc.) with the same degree of respect with whichthey regard themselves. If one has little self-respect, no matterhow much of a surface ego is present, one has little respect foranything else. This will lessen or negate ultimate success-magical or otherwise.The difference between prayer and magic can be comparedto the difference between applying for a loan and writing out ablank check for a desired amount. A man applying for a loan(prayer) may have nothing but a job as collateral and mustkeep working and pay interest, should the loan be granted.Otherwise he will wind up with bad credit (purgatory). Theman (magician) who writes the desired amount on the blank"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"check, assumes there will be delivery of the merchandise, andhe pays no interest He is indeed fortunate-but he had betterhave sufficient funds (magical qualities) to cover the amountwritten, or he may wind up in far worse straits, and have hiscreditors (demons) out looking for him.Magic, like any other tool, requires a skilled hand. Thisdoes not mean that one need be a magician's magician or anadvanced scholar of occult teachings. But it requires an applica-tion of principles-principles (earned through study and experi-ence. Life itself demands application of certain principles. Ifone's wattage (potential) is high, and the proper principles areapplied, there is very little that cannot be accomplished. Themore readily one can apply the principles needed to effect aproficiency in Lesser Magic, the greater one's chances of attain-ment through the use of ritual-or ceremonial-magic.Satanic Ritual is a blend of Gnostic, Cabbalistic, Hermetic,and Masonic elements, incorporating nomenclature and vibra-tory words of power from virtually every mythos. Though therituals in this book are representative of different nations, itwill be easy to perceive a basic undercurrent through the culturalvariants.Two each of the rites are French and German, their pre-ponderance accountable to the rich wealth of Satanic dramaand liturgy produced by those countries. The British, althoughenamored of ghosts, hauntings, pixies, witches, and murdermysteries, have drawn most of dieir Satanic repertoire fromEuropean sources. Perhaps this is because a European Catholicwho wanted to rebel became a Satanist: an Englishman whowanted to rebel became a Catholic-that was blasphemyenough! If most Americans' knowledge of Satanism is gleanedfrom the tabloid press and horror films, the average Briton canboast of \"enlightenment\" from the pens of three of theirwriters: Montague Summers, Dennis Wheatley and RolloAhmed. The notable British exceptions to what historian ElliotRose terms die \"anti-Sadducee\" school of literary probing intoSatanism, are that author's bold work, A Razor for a Goat;and Henry T. F. Rhodes' comprehensive study, The SatanicMass.Approximately half of the rites contained in this volumecan be performed by four or less persons, thereby eliminatingproblems or failures which can arise if quantity takes precedenceover quality in the selection of dramatis personae. Where groupsolidarity and singleness of purpose exists, ceremonies such asDas Tierdrama, Homage to Tchort and The Call to Cthulhu,can be celebrated effectively by a larger number of participants.For the most part, the rites should be begun and endedwith the procedures standard to Satanic liturgy. These arepresented in detail in The Satanic Bible, and are indicatedwherever the term standard sequence, or customary manner (or"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"die equivalent), appears in the present text. Accoutermentsnecessary to all rites, as well as the Enochian Calls, are likewisegiven in the Bible.As to the pronunciation of the names involved (despitesome occultists who insist, \"You can't expect help from theforces you call upon if you can't pronounce their names right,\"),assume that the forces, demons, or elementals have enoughinsight to judge a caller's worthiness on more profound criteriathan his glib tongue or expensive shoes. Pronounce the namesas they sound best to you, but don't assume that you have thecorrect pronunciation, exclusive of all others. The \"vibratory\"rate of the names is only as effective as your own ability to\"vibrate\" while saying them, neither of which terms is to beconfused with vibrato.The success of magical operations is dependent uponapplication of principles learned rather than the amount of datacollected. This rule must be stressed, for ignorance of this factis the one most consistent cause of magical incompetency-andthe least likely to be considered as the reason for failure. Themost successful individuals throughout history have been thepeople who learn a few good tricks and apply them well, ratherthan those with a whole bag full who don't know which trickto pull out at the right time-or how to use it once they get itout!Much magical curricula is padded beyond belief withpseudo-esoteric data, the purpose of which is: (a) to make ittougher to learn, since no one places any credence in whatcomes too easy (though they constantly seek shortcuts, give-aways and miracles); (b) to provide many things that can gowrong, so that if a ritual doesn't work it can be said that thestudent was delinquent in his studies; (c) to discourage all butthe most idle, bored, talentless, and barren (translation=intro-spective, mystical, spiritual) persons. Contrary to popular as-sumption, esoteric doctrines do not discourage nonachieversbut actually encourage them to dwell in loftier ivory towers.Those with the greatest degree of natural magical ability areoften far too busy with other activities to learn the \"finer\"points of the Sephiroth, Tarot, I Ching, etc.This is not intended to suggest that there is no value inarcane wisdom. But, just because one memorizes every name ina telephone directory it does not mean he is intimately ac-quainted with each person listed.It is often said that magic is an impersonal tool and there-fore neither \"white\" nor \"black,\" but creative or destructive,depending upon the magician. This implies that-like a gun-magic is as good or bad as its user's motivations. This, unfortu-nately, is a half-truth. It presumes that once a magician activateshis magical weapon it will serve him according to his ownpropensities."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"If a magician were dealing with only two elements-himselfand his magical force-this theory could be valid. But undermost circumstances, human actions and events are influencedand carried out by other human beings. If a magician wants toeffect a change according to his will (personal) and employsmagic as a tool (impersonal), he must often rely on a humanvehicle (personal) to carry out his will. No matter how im-personal a force magic is, the emotional and behavioral patternof the human vehicle must be considered.It is too often assumed that if a magician curses someonethe victim will meet with an accident or fall ill. This is an over-simplification. Often the most profound magical workings arethose which engage the assistance of other unknown humanbeings in order to effect the magician's will. A magician'sdestructive wish toward another may be justified by all laws ofnatural ethic and fair play, but the force that he summons maybe wielded by a mean, worthless person-one whom the magi-cian himself would despise-in order to complete the working.Oddly enough, this manner of operations can be employed forbenevolent or amorous-rather than destructive-ends withequal success.The Satanic Bible states that the magician should treat theentities he calls upon as friends and companions, for even an\"impersonal\" device will respond better to a conscientious andrespectful user. This principle is accurate for operating auto-mobiles and power tools, as well as demons and elementals.It will be apparent to some readers that Satanic rites ofthe type contained in this book can act as catalysts for the ac-tions of great numbers of people, and indeed they have-acting,in the words of Lovecraft, as the mind that is held by no head.Whenever reference in this book is made to a priest, therole may also be taken by a woman who can serve in the capacityof priestess. It must be clarified, however, that the essence ofSatanism-its dualistic principle-necessarily imposes an active/passive dichotomy upon the respective roles of celebrant andaltar. If a woman serves as a celebrant, then for all intents andpurposes she represents the masculine principle in the rite.The pervasive theme of active/passive (Yin/Yang) inhuman relations cannot be stifled, despite attempts to creatematriarchal, patriarchal, or unisexual societies. There will alwaysbe those who \"might as well be men\" or \"might as well bewomen,\" depending upon their endocrinological, emotionaland/or behavioral predilections. It is far sounder, from amagical standpoint, for an ego-driven or forceful woman toconduct a ritual, rather than a shy, introspective man. It mightprove awkward, however, to cast a passive man in the role ofEarth-Mother-as the altar-unless his appearance conveyedthe image of a woman.An exclusively homosexual group can often conduct more"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"fruitful rituals than a group with both heterosexual and homo-sexual participants. The reason is that each person in an afl-homophile group is usually more aware of the individualactive/passive propensities of his associates, and this ensuresaccurate role casting. It must be stressed that both male andfemale principles must be present, even if the same sex portraysboth.With few exceptions the rituals and ceremonies in thisbook have been written to meet existing conditions and require-ments. Because a workable format depends on fairly recentstandards of language, readily-understandable rubrics and emo-tion-producing litany cannot be set down without a certaindegree of \"Satanic license.\" There are virtually no Satanicrites over one hundred years old that elicit sufficient emotionalresponse from today's practitioner, if the rites are presented intheir original form. When the rites were initially conceived,they were amply provocative to the wizards who practiced them,of course. In short, one no longer reads a Victorian romancefor sexual titillation.No single element of a magical rite is quite as importantas the words which ate spoken, and unless the litany of a ritualis stimulating to the speaker, silence is far more desirable. Thecelebrant or priest conducting a rite must serve as a soundingboard for the emotions of those in attendance. Through thestrength of his words, his listeners' potential charge of magicalenergy can be inspired to peak intensity or wane to lethargy outof sheer boredom. However, many people are bored by anylitany, no matter how meaningful or eloquent, so it behoovesthe magician to select his co-workers with care. Those who areperennially bored are usually stupid, insensitive, unimaginativeindividuals. They are deadwood in any ritual chamber.Naturally, there is a reasonable level of possible emotionalresponse which must be understood when selecting a litany tohe used for ceremonial purposes. A wizard or cultist of 1800may have thrilled at his words when speaking of \"waiting at thedarkness visible, lifting our eyes to that bright Morning Star,whose rising brings peace and salvation to the faithful andobedient of the human race.\" Now he may say, \"standing atthe gates of Hell to summon Lucifer, that he might rise andshow himself as the harbinger of balance and truth to a worldgrown heavy with the spawn of holy lies,\" in order to engenderthe same emotional response.The guiding thoughts behind Satanic rituals past and pres-ent have emanated from diverse minds and places, yet alloperate on much the same \"frequency.\" Many people whonever conceptualized their personal philosophies discover thatthe principles of Satanism are an unequalled vehicle for theirthoughts; hence the title of \"Satanist\" is now being claimed byits rightful owners. Those who disagree with the non-Christian"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"definition of Satanist, as set forth in The Satanic Bible, shouldexamine the basis of that disagreement. It surely stems fromone of two sources: \"common knowledge\" or scripturallyfounded propaganda.\"Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, ashe has kept it in business all these years!\"-the Ninth SatanicStatement-is not limited just to the religious organization re-ferred to as \"the church.\" How convenient an enemy the Devilhas been for the weak and insecure! Crusaders against theDevil maintained that Satan, even if accepted on an anthro-pomorphic basis, was neither so evil nor so dangerous that hecould not be personally vanquished. And so Satan has existedas a convenient enemy to be employed when needed-one whocould be beaten by any lily-livered popinjay who could find thetime to arm himself with a barrage of scriptural rhetoric! ThusSatan has made cowards into heroes, weaklings into gladiators,and wretches into nobles. That was so simply because his adver-saries were able to tailor the rules of the game to suit their ownneeds. Now that there are avowed Satanists, who make theirown standards, the rules of the game change. If a substance isharmful, its poisonous effects will speak for it. If Satanists arepowerfully evil, then their foes have valid fears.The \"godly,\" have toughened Satan in his role of scapegoat,while keeping him nourished and handy for their needs. Nowit is they who have weakened and atrophied while Satan breakshis bonds. Now Satan's people can speak for Him, and theyhave a weapon calculated to annihilate the feeble and insipidmournings of the pulpit pounders of the past. That weaponis logic.The Satanist can easily invent fairy tales to match anythingcontained in holy writ, for his background is the very child-hood of fiction-the myths immemorial of all peoples andall nations. And he admits they are fairy tales. The Christiancannot-no, dares not-admit that his heritage is fairy tales,yet he depends on them for his pious sustenance. The Satan-ist maintains a storehouse of avowed fantasy gathered from allcultures and from all ages. With his unfettered access to logicas well, he now becomes a powerful adversary of Satan's pasttormentors.Those who have depended on fighting the Devil to dis-play their \"goodness\" must discover a new adversary-onewho is helpless, disorganized, and easily vanquished. But theworld is changing fast and such a recruitment will prove diffi-cult, ... so difficult, in fact, that witch-hunters and devilfinders may be forced to seek their quarry in the most impene-trable of jungles-themselves.Note"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In rituals where a foreign language is presented, theEnglish translation usually follows after a brief space.Wherever both languages are so presented, only one shouldbe employed.

Ithas long been considered the principal elective of Satanists, whowere assumed never to tire of trampling on crosses and ofstealing unbaptized infants. If a Satanist had nothing else todo, and was independently wealthy, newer and more blasphem-ous versions of the Messe Noir would be invented in order tonourish his jaded existence, the theory went. Though a titillatingconcept to many, it is without validity, and as devoid of logicas the assumption that Christians celebrate Good Friday everyWednesday afternoon.Although the Black Mass is a ritual that has been per-formed countless times, the participants often were not Satan-ists, but would act solely on the idea that anything contra-dictory to God must be of the Devil. During the Inquisition,anyone who doubted the sovereignty of God and Christ wassummarily considered a servant of Satan and suffered accord-ingly. The Inquisitors, needing an enemy, found one in theguise of witches who supposedly were subject to Satanic con-trol Witches were created in wholesale lots by the churchfrom the ranks of the senile, sexually promiscuous, feeble-minded, deformed, hysterical, and anyone who happened to beof non-Christian thought or background. There was only aminute percentage of actual healers and oracles. They were like-wise persecuted."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"There have been recent attempts to assess great numbers of\"witches\" of antiquity as rebels against the Christian Churchwho held Dianic \"esbats\" with furtive regularity. This presentsa charming picture. But it is folly, because it bestows a degreeof intellectual sophistication on people who were essentiallyignorant, and who were willing to go along with whatever formof worship the opinion makers gave them.At any rate, during the period when accounts of the BlackMass were employed as propaganda against \"heretical\" sectsand orders, few cared about the finer points differentiating thewitch from the Satanist. Both were as one in the eyes of theInquisitors, although it is safe to say that unlike the majoritywho bore the label of witch, those who conducted themselves\"Satanically\" often earned their stigma. This is not meant tocondone the actions of the Inquisitors against such freethinkersand rebels, but to concede that they were a very real threat tothe holy fathers. Such men as Galileo and da Vinci, accusedof traffic with the Devil, most certainly were Satanic in thesense that they expressed ideas and theories destined to breakdown the status quo.The supposed high point of the Black Mass, alleged tobe the offering to Satan of an unbaptized human child, wasnot quite the way the collectors of baptism fees gloatinglytold it.Catherine Deshayes, known as LaVoisin, was a seven-teenth century French businesswoman who peddled drugs andperformed abortions. LaVoisin arranged \"rituals, charms andspells\" for her clients, all of whom wished to retain the safetyof the Church, but whose ineffectual prayers drove them to seekdarker magic. This sort of desperate miracle seeking is as preva-lent today as it was then. In the performance of one of hermore popular productions, a clandestine, highly commercialinversion of the Catholic mass, LaVoisin provided \"authen-ticity\" by actually engaging willing Catholic priests as celebrantsand sometimes using an aborted fetus as a human sacrifice(Records indicate that she performed over two hundredabortions.)The priests who supposedly celebrated the Black Mass forher supplied the holy propagandists with more material. If or-dained priests were occasionally prone to take part in hereticalrites, it is understandable when one considers the social condi-tions at the time. For centuries in France many men becamepriests because they were from upper class families and thepriesthood was de rigeur for at least one son of cultured orwell-to-do parents. The first son became a military officer orpolitician, and the second was sent off to a religious order. Socontroversial was this arrangement that it produced a catchphrase: \"Le rouge et noir.\"If one of the young men happened to be of intellectual"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"bent, which was often the case, the priesthood provided virtu-ally the only access to libraries and avenues of higher learning.It was to be expected that the Hermetic principle of \"as above,so below\" and vice versa would apply to gifted and intelligentindividuals. An inquiring, well-developed mind could often bedangerously skeptical and subsequently irreverent! Thus therewas always a supply of \"depraved\" priests ready and willingto celebrate Satanic rites.History has, in fact, produced entire sects and monasticorders that fell into humanistic and iconoclastic fever. Thinkabout it; you personally may have known of a priest or minis-ter who wasn't quite what he should have been ... ! Today, ofcourse, in Christianity's death throes, anything goes in theclergy, and priests once tortured and executed for \"vile here-sies\" (Urban Grandier, for example) would seem like BoyScouts by current standards of pastoral conduct. The seven-teenth century priests who celebrated the Black Mass need nothave been intrinsically evil: heretical, most certainly; perverse,definitely; but harmfully evil, probably not.The exploits of LaVoisin, which have been recounted insuch a sensational manner, if simplified reveal her as a beau-tician, midwife, lady pharmacist, abortionist, who had a flair fortheatrics. Nevertheless, LaVoisin gave the Church what itneeded: a real honest-to-Satan Black Mass. She provided muchsubstance for their anti-heretic propaganda machine. LaVoisinput the Black Mass on the map, so to speak, and so succeededin working some very real magic-magic far more potent thanthe spells she concocted for her clients. She gave people an idea.Those who leaned to the ideas expressed by LaVoisin'srites needed little encouragement to attempt to duplicate therites. For those persons the Black Mass provided a setting forvarious degrees of perversity, ranging from harmless and/orproductive psychodrama to actual heinous acts that would sub-stantiate the chroniclers' wildest fantasies. Depending on in-dividual predilection, those who received inspiration from thelikes of LaVoisin could either effect a therapeutically validform of rebellion, or fill the ranks of the \"Christian Satanists\"-miscreants who adopt Christian standards of Satanism. Onefact is irrefutable: for every unborn baby offered up \"in thename of Satan\" during LaVoisin's clandestine playlets, count-less thousands of living babies and small children have beenslaughtered in wars fought in the name of Christ.The Black Mass which follows is the version performedby the Societe des Luciferiens in late nineteenth and early twen-tieth century France. Obviously taken from prior Messes Noir,it also derives from the texts of die Holy Bible, the MissaleRomanum, the work of Charles Baudelaire and Charles Marie-George Huysmans, and the records of Georges Legue. It is themost consistently Satanic version this author has encountered."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"While it maintains the degree of blasphemy necessary to makeit effective psychodrama, it does not dwell on inversion purelyfor the sake of blasphemy, but elevates the concepts of Satan-ism to a noble and rational degree. This ritual is a psychodramain the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negatestigma acquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehiclefor retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name ofChristianity.Perhaps the most potent sentence in the entire mass fol-lows the desecration of the Host: \"Vanish into the void of thyempty Heaven, for thou wert never, nor shall thou ever be.\"The possibility that Christ was a total invention has occurred toinvestigators with increasing frequency. Many once existingsocial ramifications might have made this feasible. Perhaps therecent last ditch \"Christ, the man\" stand is an attempt to sus-tain a dying myth through use of a single reinforcing ele-ment-one with which all can identify-that shows him afallible human being!Requirements for PerformanceParticipants consist of a priest (celebrant), his immediateassistant (deacon), a secondary assistant (subdeacon), a nun,an altar, an illuminator who holds a lighted candle whereneeded for reading, a thurifer, a gong-striker, an additionalattendant and the congregation.Hooded black robes are worn by all participants excepttwo: a woman dressed as a nun, wearing the customary habitand wimple, and the woman who serves as the altar, who fanude. The priest conducting the mass is known as the cele-brant. Over his robe he wears a chasuble bearing a symbol ofSatanism-the Sigil of Baphomet, inverted pentagram, in-verted cross, symbol of brimstone or black pine cones. Thoughsome versions of the Black Mass were performed in vestmentsconsecrated by the Roman Catholic Church, records indicate thatsuch garments were the exception rather than the rule. Theauthenticity of a consecrated host seems to have been far moreimportant.The woman who serves as the altar lies on the platformwith her body at right angles to its length, her knees at itsedge and widely parted. A pillow supports her head. Her armsare outstretched crosswise and each hand grasps a candleholdercontaining a black candle. When the celebrant is at the altar,he stands between the woman's knees.The wall over the altar should bear the Sigil of Baphometor an inverted cross. If both are employed, the Sigil of Bapho-met must take the uppermost or prominent position, the crossoccupying the space between the lower halves of the altar's legs.The chamber should either be draped in black or in some"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"way approximate the atmosphere of a medieval or gothic chapel.Emphasis should be placed on starkness and austerity, ratherthan finery and glitter.All implements standard to Satanic ritual are employed:bell, chalice, phallus, sword, gong, etc. (see Satanic Bible fordescriptions and use). In addition a chamber pot, thurible (cen-ser) and incense boat are used.The chalice containing wine or liquor is placed betweenthe altar's thighs, and on it is a paten holding a round waferof turnip or of coarse black bread. The chalice and patenshould be shrouded with a square black veil, preferably of thesame fabric as the celebrant's chasuble. Immediately in frontof the chalice is placed an aspergeant or phallus.The ritual book is placed on a small stand or pillow sothat to is on the celebrant's right when he faces the altar. Theilluminator stands at the side of the altar near the ritual book.Opposite him, on the other side of the altar, stands the thuri-fer with a thurible that holds ignited charcoal. Next to himstands the attendant holding the boat of incense.Music should be liturgical in mood, preferably played onthe organ. The works of Bach, de Grigny, Scarlatti, Palestrina,Couperin, Marchand, Clerambault, Buxtehude and Franck aremost appropriate.LE MESSE NOIRLE MESSE NOIR[When all are assembled the gong is sounded and thecelebrant, with the deacon and subdeacon preceding him,enters and approaches the altar.

Chambers\"Casilda's Song\" from The King in YellowThe Ceremony of the Stifling Air is the the which wasperformed when entering the sixth degree of the Order of theKnights Templar. It celebrates a reawakening of the flesh and arejection of past self-denials, and symbolic rebirth is attainedthrough a contrived entombment. The ceremony originated inthe thirteenth century. In its original form it was not the his-torical parody into which it later developed. Accounts of theperformance of L'Air Epais ultimately strengthened the chargesof King Philip IV of France in his campaign to abolish therich order, which was banished in 1331.The Templars had been exposed to the dualistic conceptsof the Yezidis in the Near East They had seen pride glorifiedand life praised as never before, when they entered the Court-yard of the Serpent and the Sanctuary of the Peacock, whereindulgence became tantamount to greater power. As a result,they developed what was destined to become one of the mostsignificant rites of Satanism. Martyrdom, once believed de-sirable, was considered with disgust and ridicule, and fierce pridewas to become the Templars' last image to the world.The philosophy of Sheik Adi and the Yezidis, applied tothe already acquired wealth and physical resources of theTemplars, might have eventually drawn the Western worldaway from Christianity if not stopped. Even with the banish-ment of the Templars, their combination of prideful, life-ador-ing principles joined with Western goal-oriented materialismdid not wholly succumb, as borne out by any history of post-Templar fraternal orders.As the Templars had gained power, they had become morematerialistic and less spiritual minded. Rites such as TheStifling Air, therefore, presented timely and compatible state-ments to men who had turned from their earlier heritage ofself-sacrifice, abstinence and poverty.The fraternal attainment conferred by L'Air Epais wouldcorrespond to the thirty-fourth degree of Freemasonry, if sucha grade existed. The present Scottish Rite ends at the Thirty-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"second degree (Master of the Royal Secret), with an addi-tional degree conferred under honorary circumstances. Corres-pondingly exalted status is attained in York Rite Masonry at itstenth grade, which carries the title of Knight Templar.The original Templars' rite of the Fifth degree symboli-cally guided the candidate through the Devil's Pass in themountains separating the East from the West (the Yezididomain). At the fork of the trail the candidate would makean important decision: either to retain his present identity, orstrike out on the Left-Hand Path to Schamballah, where hemight dwell in Satan's household, having rejected the foiblesand hypocrisies of the everyday world.A striking American parallel to this rite is enacted withinthe mosques of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of theMystic Shrine, an order reserved for thirty-second degree Ma-sons. The Nobles have gracefully removed themselves from anyimplication of heresy by referring to the place beyond theDevil's Pass as the domain where they might \"worship at theshrine of Islam.\"L'Air Epais is impossible to perform without an indiscreetdegree of blasphemy toward the Christian ethic, hence its ex-clusion from Masonic ritual, thereby halting any further pro-gression beyond the Thirty-third degree Scottish Rite andTenth grade York Rite level. The Order of the Rosy Crossof Aleister Crowley's magic curriculum provided an interestingcomparison in its Seventh degree (Adeptus Exemptus). Inthat rite, the alternative to taking the Left-Hand Path wasto become a Babe of the Abyss, which is not as contradictoryand confusing as it sounds, if one considers Crowley's ofttimesMachiavellian modus operandi. Crowley, nobody's fool, simplyset up a magical maze so that students whose conscienceswould only allow them to tread the Right-Hand Path wouldnevertheless wind up on the Left. Fortunately, precious few ofCrowley's disciples progressed as far as the grade of AdeptusExemptus, thus neatly preventing problems that might havearisen from such rude spiritual awakenings.The overtly anti-Christian sentiments of The Ceremony ofthe Stifling Air classified it as a \"Black Mass,\" according tothe accounts that were employed to indict the Templars.Upon assuming the Sixth degree, a candidate renouncedall life-denying spirituality and acknowledged an understandingof the material world as a prerequisite to higher planes ofexistence. This is a ritual of the death-defiant and allowsany unconscious death motivations to be exorcised. It is astatement of rebirth, of the delights of life as opposed to thenegation of death. The celebrant in the original version ofL'Air Epais is represented as a saint, martyr, or other paragonof selflessness. This is done to emphasize the transition fromself-denial to self-indulgence."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The ceremony of rebirth takes place in a large coffin. Thecoffin contains an unclad woman whose task is to awaken lust inthe \"dead\" man who joins her. L'Air Epais can serve a twofoldpurpose; as a rejection of death and a dedication to life, or ablasphemy against those who crave misery, distress, and nega-tion. A celebrant who is basically life loving can release all needsfor self-abasement by willingly \"dying,\" thereby exorcising theself-destructive motivations he might be harboring.L'Air Epais is a ceremony through which one might getthe idea of death over with and out of his system, while turn-ing death's accouterments into instruments of lust and life.The coffin, the principle device, contains the manifestation ofthe force that is stronger than death, the lust that produces newlife. This is similar to the coffin symbolism that, with a euphe-mistic veneer, is found in most lodge rituals.If the celebrant is patently masochistic, he can, throughtransference, become a surrogate for members of the congrega-tion who may harbor the same propensity. He suffers a fateworse than death when, within the coffin, instead of experiencingthe hoped-for spiritual reward, he is confronted with unexpectedpassions from which he has long abstained. (If a homophileportrays the celebrant, the coffin should contain another male.In all aspects of the ritual, the element of pleasure should bewhatever would most likely be denied in the celebrant's life.)The gravest punishment is always incurred by one whose absti-nence has become his indulgence. Thus be warned: to thechronic lover of distress, ruin arrives through the bestowal ofindulgence. This, then, can function as a literal interpretationof the phrase, \"to kill with kindness.\"When a \"man of God\" is portrayed by the celebrant, asin the later commemorative version of L'Air Epais, the ritualwill serve to weaken the collective structure of the organizationhe represents. This factor introduces an element of the MesseNoir into the rite, as mentioned by Lewis Spence and otherwriters.The title Stifling Air refers both to the tension producedby the contrivedly oppressive atmosphere during the early seg-ments of the ceremony, and the closeness within the coffin.When the performance of L'Air Epais was resumed in1799, it served as a celebration of the successful curse placedupon Philip and Pope Clement V by Jacques de Molay, thelast Grand Master of the Templars, who had been condemnedto death along with his Knights. The present text employs theactual curse leveled against the King and the Pope by deMolay. Though the dialogue of the Priest of Satan, theKing, and the Pope are presented in modern French prose,the statements of de Molay have been retained in their actualstilted delivery.James Thompson's diabolical litany of the nineteenth"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"century, The City of Dreadful Night, has long been employedas the Denunciation. It is doubtful that any words could bebetter suited to the occasion. Portions of the text appear inRaynouard's drama of 1806, Les Templiers.The numerous manifestations of Satanism in Masonicritual, for instance, the goat, the coffin, the death's-head, etc,can easily be euphemized, but the rejection of certain valuesdemanded by L'Air Epais cannot be cloaked in acceptedtheologies. Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he em-barks upon the Left-Hand Path and chooses Hell in place ofHeaven. Besides being both ritual and ceremony, The StiflingAir is a memento mori carried to its highest power.Requirements for PerformanceThe chamber must either be black, or mirrored. A mir-rored chamber provides greater confrontation for the celebrant,making him hyperconscious of his role. Mirrors also serve to\"rob the soul\" according to old tradition. An austere chair isprovided in which the celebrant sits during the first part of theritual. The coffin may be of any type, although a traditionalhexagonal style is recommended, as this is the type depictedin the actual sigil of the Sixth degree of the Templars and,combined with the skull and crossbones, is retained in Masonicsymbology. The coffin must be large enough to accommodatetwo persons, hence special construction or modification is likelyto be necessary.The usual devices of Satanic ritual are all employed. Addi-tional accouterments include a cat-o'-nine-tails with which toscourge the celebrant, a cruet for the Wine of Bitterness, and agobletThe celebrant (Pope) is attired in tattered and decayingvestments. The King is represented as counsel for the celebrant;he wears rags and a miserable crown made out of cardboard.De Molay is dressed in Satanic splendor, with the mantle ofthe Templars and the symbols of his office. He carries a sword.The woman in the coffin should be sensually appealingand seductive, the opposite of the wan, pale concept usuallyassociated with death.For music suitable to this ritual, refer to Le Messe Noir,or employ Berlioz1 \"Funeral and Triumphal Symphony.\"Procedure for PerformanceThe ceremony begins in the customary manner, as de-scribed in The Satanic Bible.

Stopping halfway through the Denunciation, thepriest signals that the Wine of Bitterness be proffered to thecelebrant who, accepting his last drink, listens while the litanyis completed, after which the priest signals to make ready forthe final abasement and joy for the celebrant. The lictors(guards) remove the celebrant from his seat and place him,face downward, on the coffin's lid. The priest then reads Biblicalpassage, Hebrews 1:6-12.After the scourging, the celebrant is lifted from the lidof the coffin. The priest then knocks three times on the coffinwith a staff or the pommel of the sword A scream is heardfrom within the coffin, and the lid lifts from inside. The occu-pant's arms beckon seductively. The celebrant is lowered intothe coffin by the lictors, who leave him to his doom or re-newal, as the case may be. As the infusion takes place in thecoffin, the priest reads the Thirteenth Enochian Key. Whenthe infusion is complete, the woman within shouts \"Assez!\"(Enough!), and the celebrant is removed from the coffin anddirected by the priest to speak.

As the inspirer of werewolves,he drove the Goths and Huns to their victories in Europe; asthe final protagonist in the Nibelungensaga, he destroyedValhalla and established his own reign on earth.

Shaw was to echo these sentiments in Man andSuperman, in which a very obliging Devil does all he can to seeto the comforts of his guests in Hell.Like Shaw's Satan, the German devil is often seen as thecatalyst of enlightened and polite behavior, optimistically de-serting the misanthropic role of Mephistopheles in Faust. Theimage that eventually was to serve as the basis of contemporaryGerman Satanic ritual can be seen in Carducci's Hymn toSatan, in which Satan is lauded as the spirit of progress, theinspirer of all great movements that contribute to the develop-ment of civilization and the advancement of mankind. He isthe spirit of revolt that leads to freedom, the embodiment of allheresies that liberate. He wins the undivided admiration of man,and finally supercedes Jehovah as the object of worship.Of the two German rites included here, the Tierdrama isthe older. The lessons taught by Aesopian allegory are the firstessays to instruct man on the pragmatic importance of appliedpsychology. Aesopian parable, which was recorded as early as1500 B.C in Egypt, was late to appear in a German interpreta-tion. As a result, when Gotthold Lessing produced the parablesin the eighteenth century, diey were readily assimilated into theheretical philosophy that considers the human animal as de-cidedly inferior in many respects to his all fours cousins.The substance of the Tierdrama is the admission of one'squadruped heritage. The purpose of the ceremony is for theparticipants to regress willingly to an animal level, assuminganimal attributes of honesty, purity and increased sensory per-ception. The priest who pronounces the Law maintains thecadence and order needed to remind each participant thatthough he is an animal, he is still a man. It is this that givesthe Tierdrama its profound effectThe rite was originally performed by the Order of theIlluminati, founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt as an exten-sion of existing Masonic ritual Ten years earlier, GottholdLessing had influenced many Germans' opinions on the limitsof die arts with his critical treatise, Laocoõn. The intellectualclimate in Germany had reached the point of controversy thatin England gave rise to the Hell Fire Club. Passing off theBavarian Illuminati as a society with a purely political base is ablunder often made by those who naively think that politics andmagic ritual do not mix. Masonic orders have contained themost influential men in many governments, and virtually every"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"occult order has many Masonic roots.The rites of the Illuminati became the basis of the curricu-lum of the later Ordo Templi Orientis, founded in 1902 byKarl Kellner and Adolf Wilbrandt A similar curriculum, withstrong Rosicrucian overtones, was in the English Order of theGolden Dawn in 1887.The teachings of the Illuminati hold that all is material,that all religions are of human invention, that God is man, andman is God, and the world is his kingdom. The Tierdramareinforces this message. It was first performed by Dieter Hertelin Munich, 31 July 1781; the present manuscript dates from1887.Many authors have written segments of the Litany intoliterature and drama. It is apparent that a great many writerswere members of the Order, or of groups which developed fromit Vivid examples are to be found in the works of ArthurMachen, W. B. Yeats, Robert W. Chambers and JamesThompson. Works notable for their reflections of the Tier-drama are H. G. Wells's most Satanic work, The Island oj Dr.Moreau, which employs portions of the Litany in a masterfulsequence; J. V. Widmann's Der Heilige und die Tiere, a bitterdiatribe on the animals' behalf against the Christian god; CarlHauptmann's Krieg, ein Tedeum, in which the animals portraythe heads of various European powers, and behave no differentlythan humans in the long run; and of course George Orwell'sAnimal Farm and Aldous Huxley's Ape and Essence. It islikely that Aelister Crowley was familiar with the ceremony, ashis Book of the Lav bears a subtle hint in its tide to the credoof the Tierdrama, the Litany of the Law.The message of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, that advises anidentification with the beast as a prerequisite to the role ofGod-man, is eloquently ritualized in the Tierdrama's Law ofthe Jungle. It is a lesson too often neglected by \"civilized\" man.Requirements for PerformanceParticipants consist of a priest who opens the ceremony,three assistants, an altar, an invocator, and participants. Thepriest acts as master of the ceremony and presides over the entirerite.

This rite can be performed out-of-doors,ideally in a clearing in the woods or some area where theparticipants can enter through the foliage at the required time.If it is performed outdoors, die woman who serves as the altarshould sit on an elevated boulder or log, so that her exaltedposition will be clearly stated. Torches may be employed out-doors, though it is not required. Where there is fire hazard tofoliage or wildlife the entire purpose of the rite is defeated, socaution is mandatory.Incidental music for the Tierdrama must be perfectlyscored to the Litany and action or it will detract from ratherthan add to the mood. Without a doubt, Richard Strauss'sAlso sprach Zarathustra is most appropriate, if properly cued,and Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps. In addition to thegong, a deep-toned drum can be added.As the ceremony opens, only the priest, his assistants, andthe altar are present. A mouse in a cage is placed near the altar,in view of the participants.DAS TIERDRAMA[The ceremony is begun according to the standard se-quence.

As practical applications ofelectrical energy increased at the turn of the nineteenth century,so did opportunities for neo-promethean innovation in the fieldof ritual magic.The German societies Vril, Thule, Freunden van Lucifer,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Germania, and Ahnenerbe, while maintaining the basic magicrepertoire of the earlier Illuminati, became what has been looselydefined as the Schvartze Orden-the Black Order-whichflourished during the period between the two World Wars.Paradoxically, though Freemasonry became anathema during theNazi regime, virtually every rite of the Black Order employedMasonic principles.In addition to some rites of the German Ordo TempliOrientis which utilized sexual energy as a means of magicaltransmission, the Black Order rites also used concepts ofgeometry, utilized reflective planes, paradoxical sound frequen-cies, and atmospheric ionization. Ritual chambers looked likesets from the Schauerfilmen of the period, and indeed theyshould have, for they were often designed by the same archi-tects. Angles of non-Euclidian incidence and Lovecraftian aspectwere prime visual ingredients.Ceremonies like Das Wahsinn der Logisch (The Madnessof Logic) were Marat/Sade type playlets in which the craziestpatients became the asylum heads, using their standards ofbehavior as criteria in selecting those they deemed mad enoughto be safely released into society. The lunatic became a magicinfluence on those outside the asylum, and controlled people'sactions from the safety of confinement. The principles wereemployed for real-life ends by real-life Caligaris and Mabuses. . . and still are.Flashing lights producing stroboscopic effects, electrostaticgenerators, electric organs with controllable harmonics, scanners,and a mental discipline and emotional response that can tempo-rarily leave its Alpha waves outside the chamber and strivetowards Gamma, the ultimate goal: these are the ingredientsrequired for the creation of the is-to-be, as defined in the ritualof the Electrical Prelude-Die elektrischen Vorspiele.Many of the rite's principles relate to the experimentsof Wilhelm Reich, a name to be reckoned with in the magic ofthe future. The procedure is to \"charge\" the chamber in amanner that allows the celebrant to \"draw\" energy from itwhile at the same time he adds his own strength of will. Thecelebrant's intensity of purpose is further stimulated by the re-lated litany. Upon \"peaking,\" the celebrant enters the reflectiveplanes that will multiply and send forth his will. He remainswithin the enclosure until he and the chamber itself is devoidof all energy, and a negative ionization and deozonization (orin Reichian terminology, DOR) ensues.Requirements for PerformanceThe ritual may be attended by several persons: however,the essential working is confined to a single celebrant, who acts"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"as the catalyst. Although additional persons can benefit fromparticipation, the celebrant can effectively perform alone. Itshould be stressed that groups performing Die elektrischenVorspiele did so with a single purpose, and the presence ofseveral persons therefore added to the effectiveness. The rite, aspresented here, was intended to alter an existing social climateand establish far-reaching change.The rite is best performed in a relatively small enclosure,as a large chamber necessitates excessively heavy amounts ofelectrical discharge in order to attain sufficient ionization.Essentially, the chamber acts as an electrical vacuum tube, withthe participants inside it serving as oscillators. A Van de Graaffgenerator, Tesla coil, or other electrostatic generator, withenough power to influence the atmosphere within the chamber,is needed. The device must be exposed, not contained withinits own enclosure, hence extreme care must be exercised thatbodily contact is not made with the device. It is best placed inan area of the chamber that is inaccessible to persons present toavoid the danger of serious injury or electrocution.The electrostatic generator should produce electrical dis-charge which is readily visible, a lightning display that is con-trolled by the celebrant during the first part of the ritual. Inthis way he is \"dressing\" the chamber according to his ownemotional responses. There is no arbitrary span of time for thissegment, as the duration of the preliminary charging period isdependent upon the size of the enclosure, the extent of electricaldischarge, and the human response factor. The lightning iscontrolled from a console or control panel so placed that therecan be a change of operators. The celebrant must be able toleave his station, with an assistant to continue at the console, ormake beforehand arrangements tot an automated progression.New developments in audio-actuated controls make this a rela-tively simple procedure.Lighting is supplied by argon and neon gas filled tubes withthe transformers shielded to prevent extraneous sound fre-quencies. Sound is supplied by some instrument on which notonly pitch and intensity may be controlled, but individual har-monics, as well, while producing an expanding (sine) wave forthe basic tonal pattern. The now-extinct Compton Electroneand Schilder Klavilux were admirably suited, as are largermodel Hammond organs and the Moog Synthesizer. Soundsmust fluctuate between 60 cps and 11,000 cps-preferably\"pure\" tones, although \"resultants\" are permissible. Beneathand above these frequencies should prevail a continuousemission of \"black\" and \"white\" sound, lasting through theentire rite.The chamber should be designed with what might best bedescribed as \"expressionistic\" decor, so that all visual imagesmay add to the out-thrusting quality of the ritual. An altar"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"platform at one end of the chamber should be utilized foe allnecessary artifacts. The unclad woman who customarily servesas a living altar is not required in Die elektrishen Vorspiele. Inher place, a human skull (totenkopf) rests opon a scarletcushion. In this ritual as in all other satanic rites, the skullserves as a reminder of the material, flesh-and-bone godheadthat is man, rather than as a symbol of mortality. It also repre-sents the vault of wisdom from whence all hitman ideas anddevelopments emerge, the temple of invention, both materialand \"spiritual.\" A candlestick bearing a black candle is placedat each side of the skull. The chalice rests directly in front ofthe skull, with the bell and phallus to either side. The swordrests parallel to the front edge of the platform. The wall abovethe altar displays the Sigil of Satan.A pentagonal enclosure, the inside of which is mirrored,serves to receive the celebrant. The pentagon must be largeenough in diameter and with walls high enough to receive thecelebrant's prone body, yet easy to enter and leave. To bepractical, the walls of the pentagon should be no higher thantwo feet above the surface of the floor, or if sunken, the floorof the pentagon should be no more than that depth beneath thenormal floor level. The top edge of the pentagon carries theneon tubing mentioned previously, to mark its boundaries andilluminate its occupant.Directly above the pentagon hangs an open, regular trape-zoid, suspended by strong but lightweight cord, so that theslightest force sets it in motion. The hanging trapezoid, con-structed of lightweight material, is wound like an inductioncoil and can be charged just before the ritual begins. The lengthof the base of the trapezoid is equal to the length of eachsegment of the pentagon.A stroboscopic light is used to illuminate the celebrantwithin the pentagon, and the frequency of flash should bewhatever is most conducive to the celebrant's needed response.In the past, an arc light with a revolving shutter was used,augmented by a continuous image of flames, projected throughthe principle of the Lobsterscope. However, now there are vastlyimproved electronic flash units insofar as controlled frequenciesare concerned.Participants wear black ceremonial robes and hoods. Thecelebrant is bareheaded.When Die elektrischen Vorspiele was performed in NaziGermany (circa 1932-35) by the intellectual element of thebudding Sicherheitsdienst RFS, the banners and symbols ofthe time were used as an integral part of the decor. Participantswere garbed in full dress, whether uniformed or not. Topicalmusic was added-usually Morgenrot at the beginning andUnsre Fahne Flattert uns Voran as a closing anthem. Thesewere played by the organist or on a gramophone. Music by"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Richard Wagner may be used instead at the opening and closingof the ritual.The litany spoken by the celebrant paraphrases the EighthEmerald Tablet of Thoth (Hermes Trismegistus), in whichthe Einsteinian time/space continuum is advanced througharcane Greek and Egyptian verbiage.The windows to the fourth dimension are mirrored planeswhich multiply the image of the single being. Small wonderthat the looking glass has had the reputation as a tool ofLucifer, for beyond its use as the most obvious plaything ofpride, it is a tool to find light where none is thought to exist.The principles of this rite have been recorded in many ways-all similar, yet with nuances unique to each particular order.Versions of the litany in print have catered to the standards oftheologically acceptable prose, avoiding what might be offensiveto the metaphysically minded. So far as this author has beenable to discover, German lodges have kept secret the rites whichaccompany the spoken hypothesis. It is known that certainindividuals have stumbled upon these procedures, employingand expanding upon them to great advantage, but, as might beexpected, little has been divulged. The instructions given herewill serve as a useful key to those who can extract the mostviable principles and apply them to their own ends.DIE ELEKTRISCHENVORSPIELEProcedure for PerformanceInasmuch as the litany is recited without interruption afterthe celebrant enters the pentagon, the working procedure isguided almost entirely by rubrics.1- The ritual begins in the standard manner, with the purifi-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"cation, opening invocation, calling of suitable Infernal Names,partaking of the chalice, invocation of the Four Elements,benediction with phallus, and calling of the Sixth Enochian Key.2- Celebrant takes his place at the console, turns on bothblack and white sound signals which continue until end of ritual.3- Begin alternating audible sound at one second intervals(60/11,000 cps).4- Celebrant activates electrostatic generator until sufficientozonization and ionization occurs and atmosphere is fullycharged.5- Celebrant activates neon tubing, leaves console.6- Assistant takes his place at the console, and maintainsaudible sound at one minute intervals during the celebrant'sinvocation.7- Celebrant steps into pentagon and delivers invocation,turning counter clockwise very slowly as he speaks. When hecompletes his invocation, an assistant relieves him of his textand presents the ceremonial sword or dagger. As the celebranttakes the sword in hand, the assistant at the console reactivatesthe electrostatic generator, combines both audible frequencies inchording, bringing the volume to full intensity, and activatesthe stroboscopic illumination.8- Celebrant holds sword on high, turning slowly counterclockwise, pausing at each reflective plane, until nine planeshave been confronted.9- Celebrant lowers himself into pentagon, sword in hand,and assumes the hakenkreuz position while lying on left side,sword in right hand. At that moment the electrostatic generatoris turned off, but sound is maintained at full intensity andlights are left flashing. Celebrant remains prostrate within thepentagon until his vision has been cast.10- Celebrant rises to his feet inside pentagon. Assistant atconsole turns off strobelight, stops 11,000 cps note completelywhile maintaining heavy intensity on a sound of combined30/45/60 cps frequencies, approximating thunder. Celebrantfaces east, lifts sword, and begins the Proclamation, to whichthe congregants respond, arms upraised in the Sign of theHorns.11- All lower arms and celebrant or assistant closes ritual"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"in the usual manner, with all console controls off, leaving onlycandlelight, and closing musical anthem played during pollu-tionary.Die elektrischen VorspieleCELEBRANT:Die Feuer der Hölle sind gegeben unddie Gedanken gewinnen die Oberhand.Offnet die Portale zur Dunkelheit.

But how much money is required for aship! He that can understand, let him understand.-Grigory Yefimovitch RasputinFew scholars have explored the existence of Devil worshipin Russia during the hundreds of years its pagan spirit was inthrall to the Orthodox Church. If questions were asked, theanswer was invariably that Russian black magic was either non-existent or a discipline cloaked in Christian euphemism. Thelatter assumption is, of course, the most accurate.There is no culture more steeped in dark forces and dei-ties than the Slavonic in general and the Russian in particular.The proportion of Satanic entities in Slavonic mythology farexceeds the usual quota. What is remarkable is that, unlikedie shunned forces of darkness so often encountered in myth-ology and religion, Russian devils were regarded with greatreverence and/or enjoyment. For this reason, the ChristianChurch had a very difficult time fighting the Devil in itsEastern rite. The persistence of Satan, especially among themuzhiks (peasants), in the early days of Russian religious or-thodoxy required a revamping of the old gods that made Ro-man Christian transitional techniques pale by comparison.Unable to banish the old gods of Russia by simply turn-ing them into devils (most were benevolent devils, to beginwith), the Christian policy makers supplied their own tailor-made Satan as a sort of catchall evil force. The old Russiangods of wrath and pleasure were relieved of any implementswith which they might cause trouble, given innocuous tasks,and assigned a day during which they might be allowed a per-functory greeting. Some were forcibly \"forgotten.\"Pyerun, the Formidable One, whose Martian image gavestrength and power to those in battle, wielded the thunderboltby which warriors pledged themselves. His comrade, Volos, theShaggy One, was the god of the beasts. His snorting stallionsand roaring tigers gave inspiration to their two legged brethren.The gentle Christians confiscated Pyerun's chariot and gave hima mill wheel to drag about. His last remaining altar was torndown and thrown into the Dnieper in 988, when PrinceVladimir of Kiev decided to convert to Byzantine Orthodoxy.Volos suffered the indignity of being turned into a barnyardwatchman and simple shepherd, and was assigned the new nameof St Vlas.Volkh, the Werewolf King, was the personification of sor-cery, and was called upon by pagan Russians to defend their"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"land in times of need. The Cult of Kupala worshipped the magi-cal powers of water. The fern, sacred to the followers of Kupala,like the peacock of the Yezidis, possessed power over riches,beautiful women and wisdom.The Cult of larilo refused to die out even as late as theeighteenth century, when the Bishop of Voronezh abolished itspractices, which included organized festivities and \"Satanicgames.\" Iarilo, the Russian equivalent of Pan, provided fecun-dity and was particularly honored in spring during the initialsowing.Zorya, patroness of warriors, rode out on her black honeaccompanying Pyerun, and offered protection and invisibilitybeneath her long veil as it trailed in the wind-the wind pro-vided by Stribog, who was also a wrathful deity.Though the dualistic principles common to most primi-tive mythology were present in pre-Christian Russian myths,the dark side (Tchomibog) distinctly predominated. TheWhite God, Byelobog (not an enemy of the Black God, in-cidentally; both were considered essential), found greatestfavor in White Russia, where his gentle attributes-he guidedlost travelers and helped weary peasants with their work in thefields-were welcome.As was to be expected, the Christians worked overtime tostamp out all such beliefs, thereby placing both the simplemuzhik, who cherished the good old devils, and the educated,in mortal fear of any remnant of dark forces. Thus a Satanicunderground that was carefully cloaked in Christian trappingswas bound to develop in Russia. Those who entered such sectswere either driven by emotion alone (the followers) or by emo-tion and reason (the leaders).By the nineteenth century, religious severity had reachedits zenith, with virtually all of Russia adhering to the OrthodoxChurch. But the Old Gods were preparing a vehicle of retalia-tion: the men of \"God\" were revealed, as in other countries, asthe real villains, but they were so steeped in their holy self-righteousness, they were unable to imagine their own disinte-gration. Out of the morass of \"goodness\" flickered an occa-sional secular spark of \"wickedness.\" These flickerings kept theOld Ones alive.Known erotic religious sects existed in Russia during theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite the prevailing Or-thodox climate. Evidence indicates they were led and directedby men whose visionary abilities, practices, and goals revealedthem as Satanists of the first order. The sect of the Khlystydemonstrates this more than any other. Their wise men knewthat the passions will always win out. On the surface, the \"holy\"justification of lust and life provided by the priests of theKhlysty seems hypocritical, but it was clearly pragmatic whenone understands the religious climate of Russia under the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Czars.The Russian religious response has always been known forovert sensualism, and reversals of emotion. Extravagance inritual has consistently played a substantial role for Russians.And the pattern of roaring, drunken debauch followed by con-trite and anguished repentence was often outside Westerncomprehension.What were the Khlysty and from where did they come?They first appeared in Russia about the same time as theirantagonistic \"separated\" brethren, the Skoptsi or \"castrators\"(circa 1500). Their ritual, though Russian, also containedsome foreign adaptation. They celebrated in name and deedsuch ancient gods and pre-Christian divinities as the Rusalki,and Iarilo, who were the personifications of passion and lust,and the Domovoy, or house genii. The Khlystys invoked Bibli-cal gods of pleasure, as well as dark, forboding demons likeBalaam, and Persian deities like Kors. In the ritual of these\"seekers after joy\" their whirlings and circumambulations, fol-lowed by frenzied sexual release, were virtually indistinguish-able from the ecstatic flailing about of the Dervishes.Undoubtedly the strongest testimony to the influence offoreign sects upon the Khlysty was their dogma of \"repentancethrough sin\"-the proposition that physical intercourse with a\"divine\" or chosen one (one in whom a god or the flame ofgod dwelt) would abolish and transform sin into virtue. Thisdoctrine has overt resemblance to and varies only slightly fromone preached by the Brethren of the Free Spirit in France,Germany and Czechoslovakia in the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies. The Brethren of the Free Spirit was a sect of dissi-dents that miscarried from the womb of its Mother RomanChurch. They taught that within each human being theredwelt a little divine spark (Fünklein). They believed that asimple recognition of this magical essence within each man wasenough to liberate one from any restrictions whatsoever, whethersocial, sexual or intellectual.The Russian has been, throughout history, predominantlyreceptive, though sometimes quixotic And despite the con-temporary myth of classlessness, he can easily find his placeand remain reconciled to it. Intrigue and change have alwayshailed from alien spheres. The doctrine of the little flame was,therefore, easily adapted to fit the Russian \"soul.\" Instead offifty lesser gods of a congregation realizing their divinity, onehuman leader became divine. To this master, or leader, allbowed with devotion. He was the one who would deliverthem from sin! Along with this went the use of a transmogri-fied Orthodox liturgical format, persistently forming a cross-current in the rituals.Associated with this phenomenon is the Russian Masterand convenient villain, Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin, the \"Mad"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Monk\" who, through the strength of his personality, and in-cantations of a rather dubious nature, succeeded in assuagingthe hemophilic attacks of the Czarevich, thereupon ingratiatinghimself into the inner workings of the Czar's court TheKhlysty have received much of their notoriety through the sup-posed association with Rasputin. Though scores of books havebeen written about him, only one, the perceptive biographyby Colin Wilson, seems to paint an accurate picture. If one hassufficient insight, the published memoirs of Rasputin's daugh-ter, Maria, also prove enlightening. The qualities Rasputinpossessed will one day become the very stuff from which con-trolled human greatness will be sought-the sort of greatnessthat moves man forward in his evolutionary development. InRasputin some saw that greatness and felt its effect in ways theycould not understand, ways that summoned the pain of theirown inadequacy. Because he used this inner mechanism, thisbuilt-in \"inadequacy detector,\" Rasputin made many enemies,along with many sycophants.It is significant to note that the persons who broughtRasputin to St. Petersburg and introduced him to court wereno mean or feeble occultists, but prominent members of Churcharistocracy and urban intelligentsia. Dilettantes and saints(notably, John of Cronstadt) alike hailed him as a holy manwith powers from God (Yet after his death they condemnedhim as a devil.) Accounts of his outré propensities and hispowers flourished. It was claimed that a bluish emanation wasseen to issue from his lips. He was credited with an uncannyability to perceive the thoughts and hidden emotions ofothers. This is borne out by his own words, which also refutethe claims of his discreditors who often include thievery amonghis \"vices.\" His daughter, Maria, recalls him saying, \"I neverdared to steal or pilfer the smallest thing. I used to believethat everybody would at once see that I had stolen something,since I myself was aware of it as soon as one of my comradeshad stolen.\"His accomplishments in healing were recognized and widelyknown, yet not his methods, for Rasputin's was not the usualshamanism of the faith healer. His supposedly extravagant de-bauchery and libidinous life have been the subject of countlessprurient ravings, as has his non-existent role in the Khlystyas leader-redemptor of throngs of living bodies. That Rasputinbecame involved in a political cabal is not to be doubted. Hewas compelling and outgoing, yet unaffected, in spite of histheatrics, and probably had a high level of natural intelligence.Little is known, however, of the secret meetings held on \"specialnights\" of the year, to which only a few select members, bothnoble and peasant, were summoned-those evenings that arealluded to but never quite discussed, when Rasputin was \"theflame in red\" and the \"great working\" was done."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"When Alexandra, the Empress of Russia, was executedin the cellar of the Ipatiev house in 1918, two years after thecruel murder of her batiuska Grigori, the guards made a uniquediscovery.

At intervals along this stripwere seven towers-the Towers of Satan (Ziarahs)-six ofthem trapezoidal in form, and one, the \"center\" on MountLalesh, shaped like a sharp, fluted point. Each tower was toppedby a brilliant heliographic reflector, and was intended to serveas a \"power house\" from whence a Satanic magician could beamhis will to the \"descendants of Adam,\" and influence humanevents in the outside world.Like the Watchers-the fallen angels of the Book ofEnoch-the Yezidis claimed to be the descendants of Azazel.The Yezidis believed in a counterpart of the story of Lucifer,i.e. the manifestation of pride banished. Like the legendarylost tribes of Israel, the Yezidis broke away from their roots asa result of unresolved conflicts, and felt a strong justificationand purpose because of their unique heritage, which theo-logically isolated them from all other peoples.The Yezidis' legend of their origin is no longerfantastic, by scientific standards. It alludes to the creation ofthe first male and female of the tribe through the principleslater set down by Paracelsus for the creation of a homunculus;viz. encapsulation of sperm in a container where it gestates andassumes a human embryonic form.The Yezidi provided a link between Egypt, Eastern Eu-rope, and Tibet. The language of the Yezidis was Kurdish-similar in sound to Enochian, the language supposedly spokenby the Watchers.Shortly before Sheik Adi (full name: Saraf ad-Din Abu-l-Fadail, Adi ben Musafir ben Ismael ben Mousa ben Marwanben Ali-Hassan ben Marwan) died in 1163, he dictated whatwas to become one of the most legendary manuscripts of alltime-the Al-Jilwah (revelations). The Al-Jilwah, combinedwith the Mashaf Rei, which was compiled in the followingcentury, became known as the Black Book-the words spokenby Satan to his people. The Black Book not only contains thecredo of the Yezidi, but their rites as welLThe Yezidis entered their temples through portals bearingthe images of a lion, snake, double sided axe, man, comb,scissors, and mirror. The lion represented strength and do-minion; the snake, procreation; the axe, potential for good orharm; the man, the god; and the comb, scissors and mirror rep-resented pride. But greater as a symbol of pride, however, wasthe form taken by Satan in the Yezidi liturgy-the peacock.Because they could not utter the name of Satan (Shaitan) forfear of persecution, the name Melek Taus (Peacock King)"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"was used. So great was the risk of outside persecution, thateven words that sounded vaguely like the name Satan wereforbidden.The vestiges of Yezidi culture that remain today have,as might be expected, met with not only maudlin \"understand-ing\" but, worse yet, attempts to whitewash the religion anddeny that it was Devil worship. After eight centuries of harm-ing no one, minding their own business, and maintaining thecourage of their convictions-despite wholesale massacres oftheir men, women, and children at the hands of the self-right-ous-the Yezidis have finally been granted a sickeningly charit-able form of acknowledgment from theologians. It is nowpatronizingly asserted that the Yezidis were \"actually nobleand highly moral people,\" and therefore could not actuallyhave worshipped the Devil! It is difficult to assess this asanything other than the most blatant form of selective in-attention!Each time an important Yezidi ritual was to take place,a brazen figure of a peacock (called a sanjak) was removedfrom a secret hiding place by a priest and carried to thetemple. It was placed on a pedestal around which a runningspring of water played into a small pooL This served as theshrine and icon towards which homage was directed. Thewater supposedly came from an underground stream whichflows through subterranean caverns in a network opening undereach Tower of Satan. The point of origin of these streamswas thought to be the miraculous well of Islam known asZamzam. The caverns supposedly terminated at the place ofthe Masters-Schamballah (Carcosa).In order to establish proper perspective, in addition tothe Yezidis' own beliefs concerning the caverns and the effectsof the Towers of Satan, the conjectures of outsiders must bementioned here. It has long been assumed that the Towerswere not limited to the Yezidi geography, but loomed in un-recognized forms in various parts of the world as diverse struc-tures-with each serving as a surface marker for an entrance,allegorical or otherwise, to the nether world. Thus considered,the Yezidi Towers and the Satanic influence they containedbecome a microcosm of a far more portentous network ofcontrol.The \"clans\" of the Yezidis consisted of: Sheikan, atMount Lalesh; Sinjar (Eagle's Lair), in Kurdistan; Halitiyeh,in Turkey; Malliyeh, on the Mediterranean; Sarahdar, inGeorgia and Southern Russia; Lepcho, in India and Tibet;and the Kotchar, who, like the Bedouins, moved about with nopermanent sector.The Yezidi interpretation of God was in the purest Satanictradition. The idea, so prominent in Greek philosophy, thatGod is an existence absolute and complete in himself, un-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"changeable, outside of time and space, did not exist in Yeziditheology. Also rejected was the theocratic Judaic concept ofJehovah, and also the Mohammedan God: the absolute ruler.The notion, unique to Christians, that God is Christ-like incharacter was totally absent. If there was any semblance of apersonal manifestation of God, it was through Satan, whoinstructed and guided the Yezidi toward an understanding ofthe multifaceted principles of Creation, much like the Platonicidea that the Absolute was itself static and transcendental. Thisconcept of \"God\" is essentially the position taken by themore highly evolved Satanists. Prayer was forbidden, in thestrictest Satanic tradition. Even daily expressions of faith werereferred to as \"recitals.\"Few outsiders had ever penetrated the sanctuaries of theYezidis. The exceptions have been almost exclusively withinthe past century when, unfortunately, the sect was waning asan organized movement. Fewer had glimpsed the sacred san-jaks or seen the manuscript of the Black Book, for they werecarefully guarded from the descendants of Adam, whoseprogeny had filled the world with mindless clay. Only fourtexts of the Black Book exist, other than the original. One isin Arabic (called the Carshuni text), two are in Syriac (withrespective French and Italian translations), and the Church ofSatan's present text, translated from the Arabic manuscript ofDaud as-Saig by Isya Joseph.During the early 1920's writer William Seabrook ven-tured into the desert and climbed Mount Lalesh, recording hisjourney (Adventures in Arabia) with an objectivity thatproved him to be a brave yet compassionate man. At a timewhen it was literary fashion to trounce the Devil for goodmeasure, regardless of his attributes, Seabrook's affinityfor Satan was visible in all his writing as surely as ifhe had been a Bierce, Shaw, Twain, or Wells. He was oneof the few outsiders who, for the first time in the Yezidi his-tory, showed sympathy for their Devil.By now the Yezidis have largely been absorbed into theworld of \"those without,\" but their influence has takeneffect.

The kawwals (musicians)stand against the rear wall of the temple, playing a prelude onflutes, drums, and tambourines. (Note: As emotional responseis essential during certain segments of the rite, Europeans andAmericans may require music of a modified form.

Fromthe pen of this ingenious New Englander came a collectionof the most convincing and thoroughly terrifying works ofmacabre fiction in modern times. His tales were uniquely em-bellished with painstaking pseudo-documentation and meticu-lous description of character and setting. It is frequently said"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"that, once one has read Lovecraft, one disdains the efforts ofthe competition. This statement has been consistently difficultto refute.As might be expected, Lovecraft was lionized and ex-tensively imitated by a number of writers whose imaginationswere sparked by his celebrated \"Cthulhu mythos\"-a term com-monly given to a series of stories based upon a supernaturalpantheon of Lovecraft's own invention. He had a firm con-viction that reference to the classical mythologies would under-mine the atmosphere of cyclic and spatial disorientation hesought to create. Lovecraft created his own beings, whose pre-historic activities on Earth set in motion the forces of man'scivilization and genius, as well as the horrors of his educatedimagination. While Freud and Einstein wrestled with theirrespective disciplines in the isolation of academic specialization,Lovecraft was describing the astonishing influence of physicaland geometric law on the psyche. While he might have hesi-tated to style himself a master of scientific speculation, he ano less deserving of that title than are Asimov and Clarke.What has puzzled many of Lovecraft's admirers is theauthor's almost casual attitude towards his work. He repeatedlyreferred to it as a mere means of financial subsistence. To peo-ple who suspected that he entertained a private belief in themythos, he would reply that an objective detachment from one'smaterial was necessary for effective writing. He was wont tomention the most nightmarish of his narratives with a levitybordering upon scorn, as though he did not consider them ofgenuine literary substance. As an author, Lovecraft enjoys anestablished reputation, but what of Lovecraft the philosopher?Perhaps the most significant clues to the philosophy in theCthulhu mythos derive from the author's fascination with hu-man history, particularly that of the classical eras. That muchof his work used material taken from Egyptian and Arabianlegends is well known. There is evidence that he was acutelyaware of civilization's effects upon mankind-both educationaland repressive. His tales constantly remind the reader thathumanity is but a short step from the most depraved andvicious forms of bestiality. He sensed man's drive towardknowledge, even at the risk of sanity. Intellectual excellence,he seemed to say, is achieved in concert with cataclysmic terror-not in avoidance of it.This theme of a constant interrelationship between the con-structive and destructive facets of the human personality is thekeystone of the doctrines of Satanism. Theism argues that theintegrity of the individual can be increased by a rejection ofthe carnal and an obedience to morality. Lovecraft recordedbis aversion to conventional religious dogma in The SilverKey, and he regarded with a similar scorn those who, rejectingreligion, succumbed to a controversial substitute, i.e. the popular"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"notion of witchcraft. The concept of worship per se is strik-ingly absent from the Cthulhu mythos. Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu are all honored throughbizarre festivals, but their relationship to their followers is in-variably that of teacher to students. Compare the descriptionof a Lovecraftian ceremony to that of a Christian mass or aVoodoo rite, and it is clear that the element of servility isdefinitely lacking in the first.Lovecraft, like the Miltonian Satan, chose to reign inHell rather than to serve in Heaven. His creatures are neverconclusive stereotypes of good or evil; they vacillate constantlybetween beneficence and cruelty. They respect knowledge, forwhich the protagonist of each story abandons every prudentrestraint Critics who consider the Old Ones as Aristotelianelementals-or as a collective influence of malignancy whichman must destroy if he is to prevail-suggest a philistine dis-position. Lovecraft, if he tolerated such analyses, can hardlyhave been impressed by them.Assuming that Lovecraft was an advocate of Satanicamorality, what might have been the content of the ritual ob-servances in Innsmouth, R'lyeh, or Leng? In his work he onlygoes as far as an occasional lurid line from some \"namelessrite\" or \"unspeakable orgy\" celebrated by grotesque apparitionsamidst sulphurous caverns of fluorescent, decaying fungi, oragainst titanic monoliths of disturbing aspect. Perhaps hethought understatement to be more effective in freeing theimaginations of his readers, but clearly, he had been influencedby very real sources. Whether his sources of inspiration wereconsciously recognized and admitted or were a remarkable\"psychic\" absorption, one can only speculate. There is nodoubt that Lovecraft was aware of rites not quite \"nameless,\"as the allusions in his stories are often identical to actual cere-monial procedures and nomenclature, especially to those prac-ticed and advanced around the turn of the last century.The Innsmouths and Arkhams of Lovecraft have theircounterparts in seaside hamlets and forlorn coastal areas allover the world, and one has but to use his senses to spotthem: the Land's End sector of San Francisco; Mendocinoon the Northern California coast; from the Hamptons toMontauk in New York; between Folkestone and Dover on theEnglish Channel; the Cornish coast west of Exmouth, andnumerous points along the coast of Brittany in France. The listis endless. Where men have stood at earth's end contemplat-ing the transition from sea to land with mingled fear and long-ing in their hearts, the lure of Cthulhu exists. Any offshore oildrilling platform or \"Texas tower\" is a potential altar to theSpawn of the Watery Abyss.Lovecraft seems to have correlated the monsters of thecanvasses of a hundred Pickmans-the great Symbolist painters"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"of the 1890's-into a twentieth century scenario. His fantasiesmay well have been a conscious projection of the idea ex-pressed so eloquently by Charles Lamb in his Witches andOther Night Fears: \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition-but they were there before. They are transcripts, types-the archetypes are in us, and eternal.\"One cannot help speculating upon a reality suggested bythe fantasy-the possibility that the Old Ones are the spectresof a future human mentality. It is as the result of such specu-lation that The Ceremony of the Nine Angles and The Callto Cthuihu are presented.

Hail,Satan!)THE SATANIC BAPTISMSTHE SATANIC BAPTISMSSince the formation of the Church of Satan, many personswishing to solemnize their newly acknowledged dedication toSatanic principles have requested a \"baptismal\" rite, wherebythey might utilize an established form of religious observancefor more compatible beliefs. As a result, two distinct ceremonieshave been created, one for infants and the other for adults whohave reached the legal age of consent.Of course any ceremony performed for an infant is notreally performed for the child, but for the parents. With thisthought in mind, a baptism in the traditional sense could serveno productive purpose by Satanic standards. A child's \"bap-tism\" according to Satanic tenets must, therefore, be in thenature of a celebration, rather than a purification. In this sense,a Satanic \"baptism\" for children becomes a Christian baptismin reverse. Instead of cleansing the infant of \"original sin\" andpreparing him for a life of blind devotion to an existing faith,the Satanic \"baptism\" pays homage to the miracle of the child'screation, his capacity for unbefouled development and his free-dom from hypocrisy.The children's ceremony included here is intended for"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"children under the age of four; beyond that age ideas alien toSatanic development have been absorbed into the child's mind,via the formal teachings of older and often unwiser humans.Once that process has begun, only the individual can thereafterrightfully choose a credo for himself and formalize it. Hence,the need for a Satanic \"baptismal\" rite for adults.\"Legal age of consent\" is essential to the adult's ceremony,because of the double-edged sword that term provides. Environ-mental legislation contends-rightly or otherwise-that when aperson reaches a certain chronological age he is capable ofmanaging his own affairs and making his own decisions. It isassumed that any such decisions are a by-product of his mentaland emotional development, the result of both heredity andenvironment. This behavioral composite is also influenced bywhat is referred to as \"proper guidance\" or \"improper guid-ance,\" depending upon who is speaking. Attainment of legalage enables one to \"misguide\" himself as he sees fit, and toassume the blame or take the credit for his own actions.Inasmuch as all Satanists would be considered \"misguided\"by the pious, we have no wish to offend further the sensibilitiesof the self-righteous by luring apple-cheeked boys and girls into\"unholy rites and unspeakable orgies.\" Virtually every unsuc-cessful (usually deservedly so) contemporary sect or cultwhich has deviated from established Christian dogma has fallenbecause the pious majority has been outraged by said cult'straffic with underaged persons. Admittedly, many of these cultshave been little more than confidence games, or sexual outlets,cloaked in white-light spirituality. While we concur that age isno proof of sound judgment, we recognize the importance ofworking within the legal framework of society.There is nothing inherently wrong with morality: in factit is necessary for the great enjoyment which comes with con-trolled, rational, and harmless immorality. What is objection-able, though, is a morality based on obsolete and exhaustedprinciples. The children's \"baptism\" set forth here rejoices inthe infant's intrinsic freedom from such expendable principles.The adult's baptism celebrates the individual's rejection ofthose precepts and his subsequent adherence to Satanic ethic.What, it will be asked, will young readers, whose ages fallbetween the two baptisms, do to commit themselves to Satan-ism? The answer is that whether you are right or wrong, yourbeliefs will not be held valid by those outside unless money canbe made on them. If enough of you believe in the principles ofSatanism, they will find ways of making money on your faith.Then, without realizing it, they will have contributed toLucifer's rise by making popular what once was shunned as evil.Your faith in Satanism need not be formalized by baptism inorder to work its magic Your faith need only be outspokenlystated. That is what you can do."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE SATANIC \"BAPTISM\"Adult RiteParticipants include: the priest or acting priest, theinitiate(s), any assistants who may be required by thepriest, and other selected witnesses present by invitation ofthe initiate, but whose presence is not a prerequisite for theperformance of this ceremony.Accouterments are all those standard to Satanic Ritualas described in The Satanic Bible, plus a receptacle withearth and one with sea water, and a brazier and charcoal,and incense.
