You can gain all your heart desires, but once you begin to obtain results those desires are an Oceanic cave that never fills. The black hole sinks deep within your soul. With every step you take you can feel the pressure build­ing. For years I have fe lt this critical mass pushing and building be­hind me. Like a waiting predator, the darkness on my heart lingered and manipulated my being into a corner. There I fo und my Salva­tion. My beginning with Azazel started as any working should have: I saw his sigil within a cryptic Grimoire. I had read about him before, but the following words that ripped a hole inside of me, giving me an itch that could only be scratched by this fiend: There is a ritual of the Brothers, the likes of which opens the Abyss fully in your life. Many call this The Lake of Fire, however such a name is not worthy enough to describe the horrifying limitless of IT. If you are Called, you may be re­born within the eternal Lake. What was this ritual? I had to know. I began searching with a ferocity that I have never before known. Madness set in quickly. The pressure I spoke of before pushed through a new barrier. Life as I understood it would end miserably if my search for the Eternal Abyss was not found.Perhaps I would have been better not to seek it in the first place. vii"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I laid out a fairly simple evocation, in order to ask Azazel what this ritual was. Before I could even call the conjuration, He formed from the smoke of the incense. The swiftness of His mani­festation made me stumble and fall to my knees. Rise. I will show you the path you seek. My sacrifice. You have chosen me and I you. I will show you the Current which the Masters and Gurus know, but do not speak. I am forbidden to show a path of such abundance. There is a river that runs beneath everything. It is above all realms of exis­tence where the council of the Ascended sit. When reached, you will be not only renewed but different in your very Spir­itual Vitality. Alas, fear not, for you were born into this. Em­brace your birthright. You are still weak, and require much strength. You must master not only the Spirit but the body and mind as well. Hearing the demon's words, I became enraged. Furious at the devil, I stood engulfed in a fiery chasm between me and this vile creature. In my own foolish arrogance, I looked up at him and demanded he obey me. Watching from up high he spoke again: You have much to learn. I will show you. Agree with me now a pact of possession. I will leave you within nine days. After which your body mind and spirit will be refocused, and your true path will layout. With passion still in my chest and pride burning, I reached out and shook his hand, feeling it hard like stone in mine. Repeat this incantation. 'Tal Shata Alsh-Tu. Tolu Shatu Lam-Aske: I did as instructed. I fell into a trance, beginning with the mere chant of this incantation, which soon ended with a hint of a viii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"whisper. What felt like an eternity was only a few moments. When the whispering stopped, IT began. The flames engulfed the candles and the shadows began to circulate around my body, building a wild tempest. I became faint, and right before I passed out from the surge of Power created I felt all of His Spirits and Power blast through me a thousand times over, causing me physical pain and massive spiritual overdose. Vomiting on myself but with no stamina to wipe it away, I stood in a cross fashion on my tiptoes. I was suspended almost in mid air. Then my entire body fell off the cross onto the Palestinian floor. I will not forget what Azazel told me in the split moment it took for me to pass out: Nine Days of Hell you must face. Face your fears and limi­tations. Be engulfed by the Darkness, Embrace it, then rise above it. My body gave up its ghost, and was thrust onto an ancient ground. The sky burned velvet purple, blending into the eternity around it. The ground was desolate, destroyed and ruined. I saw a throne ahead of me, and willed myself toward it. The Chair of Majesty stood above all else with Azazel sitting and pondering on his next task. He knew this world was his and next would be also. Dante, I will bring to you the knowledge you have sought fo r so long. All will be yours. Embrace your birthright. Why did He keep saying this to me? Embrace my birthright? It's important to note that in this part of my life I had already achieved a tremendous amount of Power. It became buzzing, thrilling and incredibly difficult to live without a way of\"taking the edge off;' so like most magicians rising to serious Power, I turned to drugs. I gradually built up to an ungodly level of opiate resistance. In fact, one of my normal dosages was enough to kill a horse and ten men. Just as Solomon said, there was nothing in this life that ix"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"was unfamiliar to me. I had sought Power and became lost in weakness, but Azazel was determined to show me this birthright of mine. He was in no way trying to show me \"the light;' but instead pure damnation. Within true damnation there lies no Salvation. No one is coming to save you. There is no rising above it. You just become it, and spread the disease. I soon found out I was really alone. As I snorted and popped my way to Nirvana, Azazel spoke to me the second night fr om my Ajna Chakra. Tomorrow you will no longer be addicted to the attach­ment that is holding you down. You will be free. I shook my head, not wanting to understand this fiend. The next day everything changed. I was always able to function even with such a tough addiction. On that day, however, my wife ap­proached me, demanding to know what had changed within me. Before I could stop my lips, I had told her about my three year ad­diction of which she was ignorant, and I was forced to be alone. She wanted nothing to do with me. Once the smoke had settled, I heard a rumbling laughter. Is this your Power? Diminished in such a manner? No, I will show you. I will lift you above the Throne of Glory. You will sit amongst the stars making them your footstool, but you must free yourself of the attachments that hold you, beginning with the drugs. May it begin. As soon as the Demon's words entered my mind, I fell to my knees, vomiting on my blue carpet, shaking and convulsing. I understood. I must quit the very thing that was holding me here, so I began a nine day detoxification. I could have easily scored any amount of drugs I needed, however every time I tried my body would become controlled by the demon that was possessing me. I had no desire to have them, however my body still demanded the substance it had grown to love. X"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Approaching the 48 hour mark with body shaking and the feeling of knowing I was alone, I call ed out to an angelic entity. One that I knew would be able to aid me in releasing the toxins from my body, or at least bring me some form of c omfort. I staggered to reach my evocation elements, barely laid out a magick circle and triangle of manifestation, and began to bid Raphael's help. I knew if any would be able to rid me of this Demon's grasp it would be him. The incense slowly formed a pillar, uniting the macrocosm and the microcosm. Celestial trumpets and angels singing were heard in the distant, and suddenly a blinding light overcame all my senses. I couldn't shield myself from it. I could see the light though my eyes were tightly closed; I could smell it, taste it even. Forcing myself to gaze up at the Holy Being, I mustered my request of being relinquished fr om the Demon and the physical dependability of the drugs. I was not aware of the \"history\" between Azazel and Raphael. How convenient it was that I chose this Angel, during the possession of Azazel. Raphael spoke, \"My son. There is nothing I, nor the hosts of Glory can do for you. These are challenges you must face as you are with His guidance. I can not save you for you are damned in his might:' Raphael then relayed to me the stories of old; how he smote Azazel in the past. \"His grasp on you is too tight. I'm sorry, but you must embrace your birthright:' Before I could dismiss him he left. The light was no longer, and I was alone with Him once more. A whispered echoed in the distance, telling me to evoke Him, the demon, Azazel. Miserable and broken. I stood with pride, dignity and most importantly Omnipotence. I summoned him within the Holy con­struct. Instead of appearing within the Triangle, His body poured out of my Third Eye and manifested in the north. \"Speak Demon. I am ready to rise to Power. I leave this Pow­erlessness behind me. I demand control of everything. Show me the hidden River the Gurus know but never speak:' xi"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Azazel told me that I would receive written instruction on how to receive his power, and His brawny image faded into that of a crow with a man's head, and flew back into my third eye. After nine days of personal hell, it was time to expel this demon from my body. I proceeded down to my evocation site. I laid out all of the necessary implements and workings of an exorcism. After placing myself into a self-induced gnosis, I chanted an old latin exorcism. Pushing Azazel out of the Ajna, until there was a significant \"snap\" from the energy currents ripping. He stood within the tri­angle with his body becoming barely visible to see. Dante, you have made it out of your hell. Now rise. My concentration was broken with the phone ringing. Stumbling and almost near passing out, I answered \"Hello:' \"Hey Dante. How are you?\" I recognized the voice as my friend and mentor Eric, otherwise known as E.A. Koetting, the au­thor of this current work. \"Eric?\" \"Yeah, bro. How have you been? I have a favor to ask of you, but I n eed your utmost confidence:' .. Yeah sure:' My original thoughts were that he wanted me to take bad karma off of his hands, relating to our company. \"I have been working with Azazellately;' Eric confided. \"I can't get my mind off of Him. He's teaching me some insane shit. He's telling me to write a book of all of his teachings. I can tell you know that it's going to be the last book I'll ever write. It's just that intense:' \"Okay. So what do you want me to do?\" I asked. \"Well this is where you come in. I need someone with some real knowledge and experience regarding Dark Works. I have a rough manuscript. Would it be possible for you to study it, and record you workings from it:' I was completely taken aback. How could he have known my recent workings with Azazel? This was all too much of a coin-xii"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"cidence. \"Listen there are some things I have to tell you:' I nearly whispered through the phone. And then I told Eric everything, my drug addiction, overcoming it, the possession, and Azazel\"telling me he was giving me a manuscript. \"Yup. Yo u're the man for the job fo r sure! Open all of the sigils, contact all of the demons, work you way through, but first there is one ritual that needs to be done. It's kind of a crooked bap­tism:' I intervened. \"Let me guess it involves Azazel, Belial, Ab­badon and Amaimon?\" \"Oh yeah! Yo u're the right guy. I have to go, but I'll send you the manuscript:' After Eric had given his unique \"bu-bye;' I began to realize just how real everything had become. I stood back and evaluated the situation, and never once was I asked to do anything, not by the Demon nor my mentor. My life in just nine to thirteen days had completely changed from manifesting negativity to producing pure Power. Once I received the manuscript, I began working. I was ob­sessed from the first word, searching this grimoire fo r all of its se­crets, paths and hidden doors. I read, read, and re-read every word, especially what was between the lines. I opened all the gateways, made the signed pack and searched with the utmost intensity for the hidden current Azazel mentioned. I lost many hours of sleep; deprived myself of basic nourishment and pleasures; I fell slowly into the black, psychosis of my soul. About 72 hours of sleep deprivation I decided to give it a rest until I got a good night sleep. I walked up my stairs and turned into my bedroom. What should have been my bed was a nine fo ot magick circle surrounded by nine black candles. I was confused. Did I set this up? Wait, why are there no windows? This isn't my bedroom. I turned to the hallway and saw my body collapsed on the floor. I found myself in the circle chanting, whispering HIS name. Time moved infinitely slow, fast and finally not at all. Azazel's fo rm xiii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"was that of a crow and a man's head. Azazel welcomed me, and told me that it was time fo r me to open the Gates to the \"Eternal Lake:' He then laid out fo r me the entire ritual, of which I surnamed \"The Gatekeeper Ritual:' Vi­sions hit me like lightening from hell. I saw everyone that was to participate, implements needed, removed the blocks from the gri­moire and laid out the open path to damnation. Sacrifice all, Dante. Damning yourself will bring eternal lib­eration. May nothing be left sacred to you. When I came out of this vision, I wasn't in bed, a chair or on the floor, but I found myself gathering the necessary implements and people needed for the ritual. It was as if Azazel suspended time itself and placed me into a time warp, landing me exactly in the time space I needed to be. My wife broke my astonishment, \"Babe? Are you really going to do this ritual? Are you really ready to let go of us?\" \"Yes. This all must be done. I know it's mad, but it must be done. If I die, I die. If I am damned, then I am damned. Forgive me, but I am not sorry for this or any necessary decisions that must be made:' \"Don't be sorry. You were born for this. I'm joining you:' My brother, cousin and son overheard the conversation, in­sisting they be a part of the ritual as well. My thoughts spun inside of my head. I was completely mad fo r placing not only my family in this but my wife and child. Sacrificing my life and others' lives excited me enough to pierce my lip with my teeth, and so time passed. Together we studied and researched the entities, bought and made the tools and chastised our mind and bodies. When the dev­ilish night came, we were ready to take whatever came our way, death, damnation or liberation, or so we thought. When seeking the devil you need only look inside, for you opened the gate to Him a long time ago. We hiked about four miles into a black forest; each of us felt the forest whispers. Somehow nature knew it would be defiled. God xiv"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"was not to be found in any of hearts; the Kingdom of Heaven was completely forsaken, for we treaded on unholy grounds. We sought comfort in the Serpent who lives in the Pit. He was our father, brother and teacher. When we reached the natural lay line circle that Azazel had shown me just a week before, I spoke my last words as a human, \"If we die tonight, I want you all to know that it's been a hell of a ride. Let's begin:' My assistants, my \"knights;' shook their heads, and they knew we were all going to die. It wasn't a question. We knew what was going to happen. My brother laid out a thirteen foot hexagram. Following him, we laid out four triangles of manifestation in the cardinal di­rect ions with the respective sigils. We placed red candles on each hexagram vertex and black candles on the vertexes of the triangles, and proceeded with the rest of ritual as Koetting has given it in this work. Causing each of my knights to become possessed by an en­tity proved to be a Herculean task. I began with Belial. The pos­session was quick and quite startling. The being took not only control over my knight but his entire physical appearance changed. The gate was thrown open, and I fell to my knees. Forcing my body to overcome such spiritual pressure, I directed myself to the next corresponding Demon. With each demonic possession I felt less attached to the people or myself; fear of dying or any other consequence faded into the blackness of the armies of fiends and demons just outside of the unified ritual area. The forest was littered ghoulish creatures, waiting for their Masters call; the air was impossible to breathe; my vision blurred, and at last I reached Abaddon. The possession of this demon was astonishing. His entire existence was forced into such a small body, manipulating the body's muscles to expand about six times their own size. He gave me a crooked smile, and in perfect harmony all four bodies of the damned chanted, \"The gates are connected and opened!\" The ground physically began to shake. The reality of it all XV"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"hit me. Rock began to split, and I felt a tremendous amount of heat like none I have ever experienced. The ground gave in, and I fell for an eternity. I landed into what I can only describe as liquid pain that burns away any humanity. It was excruciating, and I screamed as aloud as my lungs would allow me. My flesh and bones melted into the abyss. In my fe eble attempt to swim away, a massive serpent coiled around me and swallowed what was left of my body. All was black, no thoughts, feelings or concerns; then there was a rush like passing through multiple levels of existence. Soon my body reformed from the abyss, piecing matter together using glue from the Infernal Kingdoms. The four Gatekeepers and the rest of the Hellish Entities became me and I them. My destiny was laid in front of me. The empire was to be built from that which gave me a new birth. I stood, knowing my knights were watching me diligently. Reborn from the emptiness beset on us at all sides. I opened my eyes. They spoke again in unison, \"Welcome, Dante. We have sum­moned you here to do your Will:' My reply was un-restrainable: \"I have waited so long to be released from that prison. His body trapped me, and now I am freer I am no longer who I was before my eyes looked on these pages. I am something stronger, something older, something less ... human. And there is no way to get back to that place again. All of the torches leading to my past were extinguished. I am damned, and because of that damnation, I have found Liberation. Heed well these words, written in the text that fo llows: xvi"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"This is indeed a door that once opened can never be shut:' Never a truer statement has been spoken or written. xvii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE THE MEETING My entire approach to the world of spirituality has been centered around two fundamental practices, without which I am certain that the whole process of spiritual development stagnates. Those two cornerstone spiritual practices are the evocation of ex­ternal and nonphysical consciousnesses to visible materialization; and the full translocation of one's own consciousness into nonphys­ical reality. Through a system of basic principles - the core of which has remained virtually unchanged despite geographic and historical spans- entities, or embodied intelligences from other planes of di­mensions of reality, can be brought into direct contact with the Evo­cator. Through similarly universal methods, the mystical adventurer can become acutely aware of his own more subtle bod­ies, and can consciously separate them from his physical body and travel into worlds beyond the flesh. Evocation pierces the veil between the worlds from the out­side; Soul Travel pierces the veil from the inside. Few arts outside of these two are capable of such a dramatic rending of the supposed separation between the physical and the spiritual. In both of these practices, a firm rule is in place that the Operator must remain in control of the Operation from start to fin­ish, that he must never relinquish control over the process or the outcome to any of the multitude of nonphysical entities surround­ing him. I have violated this rule, and as a result, I was taken into a 19"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"world where all of my assumptions on the nature of the world of spirits and its interactions with our world were destroyed. For a time, I turned the entire operation, not only of the evocations and the translocations, but of my very spiritual Ascent, over to a demon. To Azazel. I can only trust that when this work is completed, he will set me free. In the hundreds of spirits that I have summoned to appear­ance before me, four or five have left an unshakeable impression. They materialize as all the others, their appearance matching the grimoires' descriptions, and they carry out their tasks with the same efficacy as all the rest. But something about them hints at the fact that what is seen in the initial ritual is a shell, a presentation fo r the public, a mirage thrown up to discourage further inquiry. The silent statue behind the fa�ade smiles, and I could sense the grin. Azazel is chief among these. A few years ago, I fo und myself on a long drive back to my home in Southern Utah from Coloradds Rocky Mountains. Shawn, my wife at that time, spent most of that twelve hour trip, as well as the one that brought us into the mountains, sleeping in the passen­ger seat, jerking from her car door pillow to see where we were on the journey, and talking with me for a minute or two before falling back to sleep. On the drive towards Colorado, I had entertained myself with an eclectic mix of music, from Wagner to death metal, hip­hop to Johnny Cash. Music was unable to quiet my mind on the return trip, however. In those mountains, in a gathering of at least fifty black ma­gicians, I had witnessed my friend and spiritual student become possessed. It was not the first possession I had ever seen, nor was it the most dramatic. It was, however, the most intense, because unlike the many teenage dabblers who open doorways that they cannot close, and accidentally find themselves host to an intelli­gence and fo rce growing inside of them, my friend was wholly ac 20"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"cepting of the demonic intrusion. She not only invited it, but when the demon came to her, she embraced it. She had owned the pos­session. She was escorted by the ritual's Operators from the pulpit where the possession had occurred, all banishings having been per­fo rmed, and I smiled at her. She was my student, and I wanted her to see my pride. She looked back, unsmiling, and did not recognize me. And, as I looked into her eyes, I was shocked by the realization that I, as well, did not recognize her. After leaving the ritual chamber and passing an hour or more in her tent, collecting herself, she retur ned to me, and could barely speak, her small body shivering, her teeth clattering as if she were buried in ice. The demon had strengthened her when it took her, it had invigorated her, enraged her, made her more powerful than any human ought to be. And when it left, she fell into the realization of her mortal weakness. Having witnessed such a spectacle, my mind began spin­ning a tapestry of possibilities, which I discussed with Shawn be­tween her naps on the return home. If someone, like my student, would be so willing to become possessed, then perhaps such a pos­session could be incited, allowing that person to become the mouthpiece of the demon, in a very controlled setting such as ritual evocation. Perhaps, even, that same willing conduit could sit within the Triangle of Manifestation, wherein the summoned demon would appear, allowing that fiend to speak through her, to use her body and her mouth to communicate with those of this world. ''I'll do it:' Shawn said, no quiver or hesitance in her voice. Crowley had performed such an Operation, thrusting him­self into the Triangle of Manifestation, becoming the living sacrifice which had materialized the demon of the Abyss, Chorozon. Was simple vanity pressing me forward to conduct such a ritual, to put myself on par with \"The Great Beast:' Aleister Crowley? Rose Kelly, Crowley's wife, had similarly involved herself in many of his work 21"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ings, and she quickly turned to severe alcoholism, and was at one point institutionalized for dementia. The risks seemed great, but the rewards appeared even greater. Aside from the knowledge that could be gained from such an evocation, and aside from being able to tell this great story, I re­alized that in performing this evocation, one of a demon into the body of a woman, a portion of the wall separating me from the world of spirit would be torn down. As we both sat in the car, silent, thinking, Shawn appearing as if she would fall back into a dead sleep at any moment, she said, \"It would have to be Belial, though:' \"What?\" I asked. I wasn't sure if we were even on the same subject. \"Well;' she answered, \"''ll do the ritual with you, I'll be pos­sessed by a demon, sure. But it has to be Belial:' Shawn had worked with Belial in some depth months ear­lier, and had developed a sort ofbond with that particular devil. I have since noticed that Belial is adept in his ability to beguile women, to sway them, to obsess them. I saw no issue with her demand, and indeed, something about it felt right. As my own path to power had taken me away from western ceremonialism and into the Shaivistic yoga current, I hadn't per­formed a ritual of evocation for at least two years. As soon as we had settled back into our home from the trip, I evoked Belial, in preparation. What follows here is my recorded account of a piece of that conversation with the demonic King Belial. September 6, 2007: I evoked to total physical materialization Belial, in preparation fo r an evocation of him into Shawn, fo l­lowed by an exorcism. Belial manifested, his presence came, and I called him into fu ll materialization until I could see him standing befo re me. E.A.: Belial, what will be required to bring you fo rth, into 22"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Shawn's body? Belial: For you, and fo r the whole congregation to issue my song: \"Itz Ra-Cha-Belial.\" Not one person can not partici­pate. E.A.: How can your presence be magnified? Belial: Blood. Feed me with blood. E.A.: Blood in the Triangle, or blood around the Te mple? Belial: Blood upon the Vessel. E.A.: Belial, mighty king, I thank you fo r responding and fo r the information you have provided ... (at this point, Belial in­terrupted my dismissal). Belial: Azazel, Abaddon, and Amaymon will rise together with me. As one, we will open up the gateway to the Lake of Fire. Belial then vanished from my vision, leaving me alone in the Temple, wondering what had just occurred. This was my idea, my project, but he somehow managed to hijack it as his own. Or perhaps it had been his idea, his project all along, and I was gladly running towards his snare. He seemed ready to answer my questions exactly, as if they were not my questions at all. It further seemed like I had not asked the one question that he had hoped I'd ask: What is the greater pur­pose of this evocation? My failure to ask the question did not keep him from an­swering it, nonetheless. I had opened a door for a guest, and was shoved aside while he and three of his friends walked into my house. I had feared from the onset that the evocation of a demon 23"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"into the body of my wife would be too much for me to control, but even in the first preliminary ritual, my control over the whole mat­ter had been derailed. It was obvious that Belial was using us as pawns, as vehicles for something beyond our comprehension ... or beyond our willingness to cooperate in. The whole matter could have been abandoned right then and there. I could have walked away. But that dark curiosity inside of me nagged and gnawed at me. I could not turn away from this, this potential nexion of demonic power. I couldn't turn my back on a path leading to a greater knowledge of the inner workings of a demonic order millennia old. My own wife had volunteered herself as a living sacrifice to the demons. It was my turn to do the same, to turn my body, mind, and soul over to them, to sacrifice myself at their unholy altar, to become the willing vessel for their plans. ''Azazel, Abaddon, and Amaymon will rise together with me. As one, we will open up the gateway to the Lake of Fire.\" Belial had laid out not only the purpose of his plot, the end result of this ritual that he was conducting through our bodies, but also revealed the formula for it. Outside of the Christian concept of a Lake of Fire, I had no idea what the fi end was referring to. There seemed only one way to find out. September 11, 2007: Evoked Amaymon to physical materi­alization. I had some issues with the incense initially, so his materialized body shifted between visibility and non-visibility throughout. His voice was still heard the entire time. Amaymon: The Lords of the House of the Seventies are num­bered. Saturnalia is the essence of my coming - death and decay, sexual and literal. I will come in the east on the sign of the martyr. Call me with blood and semen and skin. The Others will come and the gateway will be opened, but you fo ur must be willing to enter first. Project into it and die in 24"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the Lake of Fire. Once you are reborn, you will have power over It and can call the souls of the Marked to damnation. My legions are many, much more than fo rty. All demons must bow before me, and many angels too. Even you now bow, but once you have entered the Lake of Fire you will never again bow to another. The Wa tchtowers need to be fu lly summoned. Yo u only par­tially called them fo rth here. They need to be fu lly sum­moned. Speak to John about his role in the ritual, and to Dawn. Some conversation continued here about the specifics of the ritual, but due to the speed of the dialogue, none of that was recorded. I dismissed Amaymon, and as his form vanished, he called out, Bare skin will evoke power. I had planned on this ritual involving myself, Shawn, and possibly one assistant. Amaymon, however, demanded the pres­ence of my friend and colleague, John, who is superbly knowledge­able in the specifics of black magick and demonic pacts, and of my student, Dawn, who had become possessed while in Colorado. Dawn had already volunteered herself fo r the ritual, in whatever capacity she could serve. I had yet to even mention it to John, as I was certain that he would warn against such reckless be­havior when dealing with demons. \"Let me know what I can do to help;' John told me over the phone as I told him about the planned ritual, before I could even mention what Amaymon had told me. I asked him to meditate on the ritual, and perhaps to perform evocation of his own, because from what I had been told, it seemed that he would be integral to the Operation. I searched my grimoires to find a demon that led seventy 25"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"legions of familiars, but found none. The reference to the \"House of the Seventies, remains a mystery. Amaymon's instructions also sent me to a dictionary. I had never before heard the word, \"Saturnalia:' In Greece, a day of cel­ebration of Saturn was held, in which the roles accepted in society were reversed. It was a time for drunkenness and indulgence, and for those who were slaves to no longer serve their masters. We were indeed entering to a contract of spiritual Saturna­lia, no longer directing the demonic deeds, but instead being direct by them. September 15, 2007: Evoked Azazel to fu ll physical ma­terialization. Azazel: ltz Rel Itz Rel Azazel. This is the song by which I can be called. E. A.: Are you to be involved in our upcoming Operation? Azazel: I will be involved, although I will remain silent. It is by our union that we will open this gateway. By your union with John, Dawn, and Cody, you open your gateways as well. They are your Knights, your army. Each of them commands legions, much as I do, but they are simply not aware of it. They will become aware of it in the moment of their resurrection. I had met Cody through John only briefly. I knew that he was a member of a few quite influential secret societies, and he had attended one of my presentations in northern Utah. Outside of those details, I had no reason to think that he would be interested in an undertaking such as this. I assumed that the Demon must have meant another Cody, although he was the only person by that name that I personally knew. When John contacted him about it, however, Cody was ec­static, and insisted on talking with me personally about the ritual. 26"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Over the phone, I came to realize that Cody's own knowledge of the intricacies of occult, as well as eastern religion, likely surpassed mine. We talked fo r hours about the ritual, and our places in it. Only exhaustion in the late hours ended the conversation. September 18, 2007: Evoked to total physical materialization Abaddon, King of the Bottomless Pit, he who holds the key to Outer Darkness. I was instructed while trying to evoke him in my home to in­stead evoke him out doors. When he rose, his materialized body stood at least two stories tall. He appeared as an armored warlord. His voice rum­bled. Abaddon: I am he who will be called in the final hour, to col­lect those who are impure, to cast them into the Lake of Fire. That day and that hour have come, and now you stand before me, ready fo r the fu rnace! Before the infernal Empire may arise, the kingdom of God must be destroyed. The fo ur seals of the fo ur archangels must be broken in the fo ur corners of the universe, each in its place. Only then will the Gatekeepers rise and unlock the door to the Lake of Fire. Call me with flame, and with a token, placed upon the fo re­heads of all who will join. All must be marked who enter therei n, into the Kingdom of Hell. In ritual, the whole of the universe is symbolized through the Circle. The seals of the archangels are their sigils, the symbols through which they can be called. Those seals, then, needed to be drawn:, imbued with the power of the archangels, and then de­stroyed at each corner of the Circle, The archangels would then be 27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"utterly dismissed from the Temple. The demons would not allow the angels to interfere with what we were about to do. My original plan had been to conduct the ritual alone, with Shawn, and to reap the benefits of it alone. That number rose from two to five, with Dawn, John, and Cody. That number seemed ap­propriate: five elements; four cardinal directions, plus the demon being invoked into Shawn; five wounds of Christ; and five points in the pentagram. But that number still was rising, to include a congregation, made up of faces that I had yet to see and names I had yet to hear. Consulting with the other participants in the ritual, we arranged the entire ceremony. A book store in Salt Lake City that had hosted several of my presentations and workshops, and carried my books, offered their basement for use in the ritual. Punk, metal, and ambient music concerts were held there quite often, some of which I had attended, so the space and concealment of the venue could not have been bet­ter. The two owners of the shop insisted, however, that they be al­lowed to witness the ritual. I explained that they would not be allowed only to witness, but that the demons demanded that every­one in attendance take part, even if only in some subtle, invisible way. They agreed. Cody, being a Master Mason, among various other titles in diverse organizations, suggested that, due to the extreme nature of the ritual, the Temple space be \"tiled:' or protected fr om outside in­terruptions or interferences. This is done by posting a \"tiler:' oth­erwise known as a \"Black Guard\" at the entrance. While in modern freemasonry, the presence of a tiler is largely a ritual formality, in other, more sinister workings, the Black Guard is sometimes a very physical necessity, and requires more than a daytime accountant with a ritual sword. It is no secret that many occult orders have ties with nee­Nazi group s, or that those who lean towards National Socialism also find relevance in the occult. This is something often denied or minimized by those in both parties, but any person with an eye 28"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and a brain can see the link. Cody put in a call to one such group, and fo und a \"S oldier;' a young, strong man with tattoos covering every inch of skin be­neath his jaw, recently released from prison for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, who was delighted to tile our ritual space. Word spread of the evocation from the few who knew of it. A group of musicians with heavy occult leanings was playing in the area, heard of the ritual, and contacted me to ask if they could take part. After meeting with them, I saw no reason to exclude them. Cody and John also invited people with whom they had perf ormed ritual. By the time the ritual began, the basement was filled with a congregation, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, at least thirty others besides the original five participants. The Black Guard's eyes fo cused. \"My duty is to not only keep those on the outside from get­ting into the Temple;' he announced before the ritual began, \"But it is also to keep those inside the Temple from getting out once we've started:' I reinforced his statement, asking any who might have sec­ond thoughts to leave immediately. I had no way of knowing what would take place once the conjurations had begun. John and I worked together to create an Elixir of Manifes­tation, which was made of red wine, moss, various oils, sacrificial winged-mammalian blood, and a large amount of human blood. This would fulfill the demons' requests for blood and bodily fluid as an offering, and at the same time has proven in the past as a re­markable base for providing the subtle vapors requisite to the ma­terialization of spirits. The Circle was drawn in the center of the basement, a waist­high altar placed in the center. A Triangle of Manifestation jutted out from the circumference of the Circle at each of the cardinal points, the converging lines between the Circle and the Triangles marked with oil lamps, which provided the only light throughout the ritual. The overhead lights were shut off. The lanterns were lit. John, Dawn, and Cody dawned black ritual robes, and lifted the 29"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"hoods over the faces. I buttoned up a full-length ceremonial cas­sock. Shawn removed her shirt, and I drew on her chest the sigil of Belial. She sat inside of the southern Tr iangle, legs folded into one another, arms dangling at her sides. The spirits started to move before the first conjuration was even spoken. The air thickened and whispered. Taking a box of sterile, unopened medical lancets, I passed them out amongst the congregation. The three Operators, Shawn, and I uncapped the lancets, jammed the sharp metal tips into our thumbs, and trickled the released blood into the chalice of elixir. Eyes froze as I moved to the periphery of the Temple, hold­ing out the chalice fo r the congregation to do likewise. Without giving a command of any sort, each person pricked their thumbs and offered their blood into the chalice. Setting the chalice on the altar, cupping my hands over its mouth, I pronounced: \"Pater Noster, qui es in abyssus, potens nomen tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in abyssus et in terra. \"Exorcizo te, creatura sanguis, in nomine Satan omnipo­tentis, et in nomine Antichristus, et in virtute Falsus Vates: ut fias sanguis exorcizata ad effugandam omnem potes­tatem inimici, et ipsum inimicum eradicare et explantare valeas cum angelis, et invito omnem maleficus spirite; per virtutem veneficium maleficus. Ilicet!\" A strange power poured down through me, into my head, down my shoulders, discharging from my hands into that bloody elixir. It was not a new power; in fa ct, it was a fo rce that I had be­come very comfortable with. Each time it runs through me, though, that power is always so strange. Dipping my fingers into the solution, like a priest absolving sins, I anointed Shawn's forehead with the blood, and then Dawn's, John's, Cody's, and every person in the congregation, asking, \"Do 30"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"you accept the Mark?\" The Mark was accepted by all, some more hesitantly than others. With those same fingers, I scattered the remainder of the elixir around the Temple, concentrating it in the Circle and the Tri­angles, careless of the splashes flung on the ritual's participants. The three other Operators stepped inside of the bounds of the Circle. Using the last of the blood elixir, I traced the Circle with my fingers, from the south to the east, to the north and the west, until I again fa ced south, towards Shawn, who was already begin­ning to swoon at the onrush of power. I looked at her, and for the last time saw my wife in her eyes. For the remainder of the evening, something else would gaze at me through them. John held the four seals of the four archangels, disks of clay with sigils embedded. I had envisioned that he would snap the clay pieces in twain and discard the halves. He stood at the eastern quarter, gazing into the seal, opening it as he would open a doorway into the celestial realms. The demonic surge flowed through him, the words of Abaddon acting as an invocation: Before the infernal Empire may arise, the kingdom of God must be destroyed. He raised the seal of Raphael above his head, his body tens­ing, his jaw clenching, the hand holding the single day seal turning to a fist. With an unintelligible wail, he threw the disk to the ground, the day shattering, turning to dozens of fragments and dust. Then with Michael's seal to the south; Gabriel's to the west; and Uriel's seal to the north. All heavenly hosts and any amount of divine light that might be shining in that dank basement fled. Dawn knelt to the left of the altar and opened some secret grimoire, which I had never seen before or since. She offered an invocation of the hosts of the infernal region, opening pathways above and below to allow the fiends to filter into the Temple. Cody began a mantra that he would repeat throughout the ritual, despite the onslaught of abyssal streams: \"Lamvam­ramyamhamramaummm;' each syllable activating the energy cen 31"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ters in each person in the room, opening not only the Temple as a gateway into the world of spirits, but using our own bodies to fa­cilitate Their coming. Behind him, one of the musicians began a drone on a Tibetan singing bowl. I turned to the east. Amaymon's sigillaid on the ground, within the Triangle of Manifestation. I gazed into it. Within sec­onds, the inked lines flashed and faded, and reappeared in three di­mensions. Amaymon's presence trickled into the Temple. \"Amaymon, I call you and conjure you forth to stand in this Temple and to take your place within the Triangle. I summon you to manifest before me in beholdable form and to speak with me in a discernable voice. Amaymon, I give you license to appear, I give you power to manifest, I give you this call to come. Amaymon, come!\" The congregation repeated, \"Amaymon, come! Amaymon, come! Amaymon, come!'' A peculiar yet familiar fugue came over me, as if my brain was receiving too much oxygen, as if I would black out at any moment. I stayed with the fugue, recognizing it as a sure signal of the success of the evocation, knowing that I could ride its waves into the world between the worlds, where the mate­rialization actually begins. Swooning and swaying, losing all con­nection with the physical world, with the basement around me, with the congregation unsure if they should prepare to catch me if I started going down, the fugue shattered, and my eyes looked to the Triangle with new clarity. I could feel Amaymon there, in astral space, preparing to breach the veil and enter our realm. Within seconds, the air above the Triangle shifted, the in­cense smoke gathered into a column, and that column gave way to a form, a solid shadow, and then a figure with a face. Our lungs and hearts seemed to momentarily stop. The air thickened. Amaymon had come. The chanting stopped. I turned to the north. \"Azazel, I call you and conjure you forth to stand in this Temple and to take your place within the Triangle. I summon you to manifest before me in beholdable form and to speak with me in a discernable voice. Azazel, I give you license to appear, I give you 32"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"power to manifest, I give you this call to come. Azazel, come!\" ':Azazel, come!'' the congregation chanted again and again, this time with more fury, more excitement, zealously pushed for­ward by the arrival of the first demon. The same fugue fell on me, and I rode it the same as before. A figure, seeming to shift between worlds, to shift between visibility and not, hovered over the north Triangle. A figure of an enormous and dreadful satyr. The chanting stopped. I turned to the west. ':Abaddon, I call you and conjure you forth to stand in this Temple and to take your place within the Triangle. I summon you to manifest before me in beholdable form and to speak with me in a discernable voice. Abaddon, I give you license to appear, I give you power to manifest, I give you this call to come. Abaddon, come!'' The congregation chanted with me, ':Abaddon, come! Abaddon, come!'' The fugue from the previous evocation had not fully left me, allowing me to nearly immediately walk between the worlds. A large form assembled in the middle of the column of smoke in Abaddods Triangle, his height reaching the ceiling. I finally turned towards the southern Triangle, towards Shawn, her half naked body serving as the sacrifice, the heat rising from her warm flesh acting as the incense, the blood still running in her veins the Elixir of Materialization. The demon's sigil was drawn on her chest. I gazed into it. Within seconds, the inked lines flashed and fa ded, and reappeared in three dimensions. Belial's presence streamed into Shawn's body. Her muscles jolted, her neck twitching, and then her arms. Her head fell back, her eyes towards the ceiling, as if she had no muscle to lift it. \"Belial, I call you and conjure you forth to stand in this Temple and to take your place within the Triangle. I summon you to manifest before me in beholdable fo rm and to speak with me in a discernable voice. Belial, I give you license to appear, I give you power to manifest, I give you this call to come. Belial, come!\" 33"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"Belial, come;' the congregation chanted. \"Belial, come! Belial, come!\" The group mantra mixed in my ears with Cody's in­cessant song and the drone of the singing bowl, both of which had been buried to me under the din of the astral winds. Shawn's convulsions intensified, her abdominals contract­ing and her spine distorting. Her arms bolted into the air to fo rm a cross at her sides. My hand stretched out, all fingers pointed towards Shawn, towards the Triangle, towards the misty shape of the demon flick­ering between the worlds. \"Belial, enter this body. It has been willingly sacrificed for you!\" I fo und myself shouting over the cacophony of sound, audi­tory and ethereal. \"Belial, accept your sacrifice!\" With a final, short gasp, Shawn's neck muscles finally reen­gaged. Her head tilted downwards, again facing towards me, and towards the congregation, her eyes still staring at the ceiling, at some invisible portal which I could not see nor sense, through which the demon had descended into her form. Her eyes lowered. When they met mine, they were no longer her eyes. Her fa ce was no longer my wife's. Her lips no longer perched in a smile or a frown, but stood without any hint of human emotion. And her eyes were simply dead holes through which the demon could peer into this plane. Afraid to turn away from the devil in human fo rm, a Her­culean effort was required to continue with the ritual, to move my feet from their cemented place, and to move my eyes from that hideous fa ce. I broke myself from the gorgon gaze, turning my whole body to the east again, and to the north, and the west, spinning in a slow circle. My senses drifted between the worlds, seeing the va­porous bodies of the demons within their Triangles, their evil ef­fluvia swirling around them. And then to the southern triangle, where Belial sat in the body of a woman, her breasts, small body, and soft features eradicated by the hard, sharp form of the demon which possessed her. \"Welcome to our Temple:' 34"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"All four devils spoke at once to me, all in some alien tongue, translated somewhere in my brain as it passed through the tunnels of perception, except for Belial, whose words were delivered in Eng­lish through Shawn's mouth. \"You have called us here to open a door into hell. We will open that door now:' The words jolted from her mouth, each one fo rced, ejected in a sudden, without the cadence expected in a sen­tence. Her arms raised again to her sides, as if yanked by invisible strings overhead. I turned my head to see Amaymon to my left and Abaddon to my right stretching out their arms likewise. Some strange light connected them, running a circuit through their bod­ies. All of my strength left me. I fell to the ground, my legs re­fusing to bear my weight. The concrete beneath me, upon which the Circle and the symbols were inscribed, dissolved, and the earth beneath it fell away. In place of solid ground, the nine fo ot diameter \"protective\" Circle became a lake of liquid fire. My body or my soul, the part of me that I then recognized as me plunged beneath the surface of the steaming orange and yel­low sea. I shrieked as my skin caught flame and disintegrated from my bones, and more as my bones dissolved. Even as I no longer had a body with which to scream, still the sound of terror bellowed out from me. A thousand faces whirled around me, trapped in that unholy place, shrieking as well, none of us comforted by the real­ization that we were not alone in our suffering. Whatever form was left of me began to burn away, whatever soul or identity that remained being destroyed, or utterly lost in the anguish. And just as it departed, just as my entire existence was ex­tinguished, a voice called out. I could not tell if it echoed through the depths of the Lake of Fire alone, or if it was spoken by one of the demons in that distant Temple where my lifeless body remained. The voice commanded, \"Rise, and be reborn:' My mouth opened and my throat begged fo r air, coughing and spitting as I crawled to my knees. The congregation had fallen silent save for the incessant drone of the singing bowl, all eyes star-35"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ing in horror. I stood, feeling as though my body had been atro­phying, unused for decades. My mind was quiet, focused, sure. I looked again at the floor, and saw that my fe et were resting on the same molten lake that I had fallen into. I walked across the red water to John, offering my hand to him, leading him into the Circle. Leading him into hell. The moment his feet crossed the boundary of the Circle, his knees buckled, as did the rest of his body. Curled like an infant, screaming like murder, John writhed on the floor, the surface of which began to flash, to transition to my eyes between concrete and fire. Within minutes, his flailing stopped. He stopped. It seemed that even the rising and falling of his chest with his breathing had stopped. With a gasp, he too rose. As he regained his legs, and I helped him stand, our eyes met. In direct contrast to the experience of non-recognition when looking upon the possessed, as I looked at John, and as he looked at me, I recognized him anew, as a lost brother finally returned home. We both led Cody into the Circle, and his reaction was identical. The three of us helped Dawn into the Lake of Fire, and when she rose we helped her up. And then we stood together, hand-in-hand, as the risen damned. I invited any from the congregation to enter the Circle, to embrace spiritual annihilation. Few accepted, but all bore the mark, and so damnation would come for them in time. With a mind not of a dying man but of a god reborn, I left the Circle, to the Triangle where Belial sat, embodied. I offered my hand, and that demon took it. I led him to the congregation, and one-by-one the fiend touched the onlookers, and named a name, the name of a demon, a familiar, a fo ul spirit that would fo rever fo l­low them, would guard them, would guide them into power, or into slavery. When the last congregant was touched and the last name was pronounced, Shawn's body fell. I caught her before she hit the ground, and I carried her back to the Triangle, to which the mate­rialization of the demon was bound and could only leave fo r a very short time. 36"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Returning to the altar, I recollected my fo cus, and looked at the opening beneath me and the spirits gathered around me. I inhaled once, a long breath, and with a sigh, realizing that the gateway must be closed and the demons must return to their places, I pronounced, \"It is done:' \"It is done;' the participants echoed. The floor shifted and flashed, and then was concrete again. The bodies of the demons and the spirits who had attended dissolved and dematerialized. Shawn fell in the Triangle, unconscious. I took a bottle of consecrated water and emptied it into a golden chalice. With my index and middle fingers, I sprinkled the water on the floor, dispelling the demonic residue thereon. I cleansed the Circle, and then the Triangles, and then knelt over Shawn's body, wetting my hand with the blessed water and placing it on her forehead. \"Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde, in nomine Dei Pa­tris, et Filii, Spiritus Sancti, ut descedas ab hoc plasmate Dei Shawn, quod Dominus noster ad templum sanctum suum vocare dignatus est, ut fiat templum Dei vivi, et Spiritus Sanctus habitet in eo. Amen. Amen. Amen:' Shawn's eyes opened, and she struggled herself up to a seated position. She retained very little memory of what had oc­curred around her and through her. The congregants disbanded, startled and confused expres­sions guiding them to the exits. I seized fistfuls of implements, cramming them into bags and stuffing the bags into the trunk of my car, as if to dispose of some shameful evidence. After we five participants in the ritual had swigged from a bottle of home-brewed absinthe, we stumbled down the street to a diner. None of us were hungry, but we couldn't shake the need to do something else, to do something normal, to pull our minds away from that basement. Nibbling on pizza, we sat silent, no one able to conceive of words not related to what we had just experienced. 37"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Dawn finally blurted, \"What the fuck what that? What did we just do down there?\" The group erupted with laughter, the ice being broken and the maddening reality of the thing staring at us. The laughter died quickly, and an even deeper somber fell on us. John looked up, brushing his hair away from his eyes. \"What we did down there:' he said, \"is something that I think we'll be an­alyzing fo r the rest of our lives:' Back in our hotel room, Shawn's image began to shift again. Her eyes stared dead into nothing. When I waved my hand in front of her face, her head turned, as if moved by a machine, and looked at me, expressionless. I repeated the exorcism, forcing the residual demonic impression out of her body through fo cused will and through an invocation and channeling of power. For three days fol­lowing I continued to exorcise the demon from her, as the posses­sion would take hold randomly, and her eyes would change, and her face would change, and her voice would no longer be her own. Belial followed her, and I could feel him enter the room, I could feel him enter her. If I paid attention, I could see his fo rm slide between the shadows. His presence would come and go, but most of the time it was there. As I laid down to sleep, however, something else came into our room as well. Something other than Belial. And this other spirit, this other demon, didn't bother hiding in the shadows, but seemed to drift at the left side of my bed, watching, waiting, perhaps whispering words that I could not hear. As Belial stayed with Shawn, this other entity stayed with me. To this day, years after the fact, it is clear that Belial never fully left Shawn; that she never renounced him, but dung to his posses­sion enough to keep a back door open for his return. Something remained with me, as well. A demon fo llowed me, and waited for the moment to announce itself, to invite itself into my awareness, and to continue the work that had begun in that basement. Over a year later, my marriage having dissolved, my atten 38"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"tion turned wholly to the worlds beyond, I found myself again haunted by that same figure who had stood over me while I slept that night after the ritual evocations. The demon had never left, I suppose, but had simply been waiting, following, watching me until I would listen to its whispers. I could feel it around me, closer every day, more intrusive, as if the specter would dart out of invisibility and would present itself in a physical body at any moment. And as time wore on, he became less and less alone, until a seeming army swarmed around me, clattering at me to pay attention. I laid out a simple ritual area in my home, lit candles, burned incense, and performed what I call a \"blind evocation;' which is an evocation into physical materialization of an entity whose name, sigil, and attributes are unknown, but who can be sensed nearby. Such evocations are indeed dangerous, as the Evo­cator has no idea what he will find fo rming in Temple around him, and he cannot pretend that he will be able to constrain whatever may arise. It seemed to me, at that point however, to be more dan­gerous to continue without knowing the identity of the spirit that haunted me. February 2nd, 2010: Performed a blind evocation of the sp irit that has been fo llowing me since the evocation of Belial into Shawn. I have fe lt him around me nearly constantly now, and I need to know who he is and what he wants. I have received vague impressions about him, in that he is male, is demonic, and has a keen interest in my spiritual Ascent. I used a large amount of copal resin fo r incense. Th e room filled with smoke almost instantly. By the time I started the orations, I was already between worlds, and could see lights flashing in the room, and then vanishing. A large body fo rmed in the incense smoke. As it gathered mass, it blackened, until the figure of a mostly naked man's chest with an animal's legs was visible. The entirety of the fo rm was ebon black. The fa ce was the last to materialize, a 39"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"large head bearing twisting horns, much like a mythical satyr, which revealed that this demon that was haunting me was none other than Azazel.

Do you think you can call on the devil, and that he will dis­appear when you've grown uncomfortable with his presence? It is you who called me, with my brothers. And it is you who calls me now. None of the others lingered. Why have you? Belial has lingered with his sacrifice. I have lingered with mine. I never committed myself as your sacrifice. Without such an implicit pact, I could not have been called. Yo u cannot see nor taste nor touch a thing without commit­ting yourself to a union with that thing. And you have indeed seen and tasted and touched me. And I have seen and tasted and touched you. What is it that you want from me now, then? It is what you want, not what I want.

Tell me then, Grand Demon: what is it that I secretly want? 40"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"All that is mine. All that is yours? All that is mine. Call me again in three days time, and I will deliver my Kingdom to you. The demon then vanished, not in the way that the incense smoke drifted away, or the candle light dimmed, but the vision of him disappeared in an instant. I was certain that the fiend was playing a demonic trickery, that he was toying with me in an attempt to get my attention and to ensnare me in some time consuming game, as entities so often do. My mind struggled with that theory, however, as this was no wandering spirit, this was no random imp that can be called with an ouija board; this was Azazel. Once the theta haze had evaporated from me, I determined to not be reeled in by the bait of unlimited power, delivered from an entity constrained to incense smoke and a Triangle. Lying to sleep that night, however, I felt his presence again, to the right of my bed, as silent as he had been throughout the ritual of the opening of the Gate, as evasive as he had been in every evo­cation. The three days following, I tried to hold my resolution to not call the demon, and was haunted not only by his presence, but of the allure of his offer, and the dangers inherent in beckoning to them. I battled myself on this matter until the final minute, when I laid again the Circle on my floor, lit the candles, and even as the incense began to spiral towards the ceiling, I was still convinced that perhaps I would not complete the ritual. Azazel rose before me, no longer in the form of a dreaded obsidian satyr, but instead as a spectral raven, with endless shadows as wings, and the face of a devil. His words. no longer rumbled through the air, but were injected straight into my mind. 41"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Th e Infernal Empire awaits you.

His form vanished without a word of benediction, and with­out waiting fo r my dismissal. Azazel made no promises of power, flung no lures before my eyes, nor did he ask whether I would care to take his hand and embrace the secrets that he had to offer; instead, he assumed that I would. Azazel must have known me quite well, because I could not refuse. I was still in control of the Operation, I assured myself. I would call him once or twice, glean some information from him, assimilate his teachings into my occult repertoire, and would bore of the task quite quickly. But Azazel knew me far too well.

Yo ur very physical fo rm is held toge ther, as mine is in this smoke, by the pressure inside of your skin meeting the pressure outside of your skin, and both fo rces holding you in one piece. This is a type and a shadow of the whole of existence. Only through the application of various forces of pressure does any­thing exist. Yo u have learned to master some of these pressure systems, and can apply them to summoning something fo rth fro m nothingness to speak to you. Yo u ask if I am real?

Having traveled to and through the astral plane, through various methods of the projection of my consciousness away from the locality of my brain and body, I have seen endless sectors, areas, or kingdoms within the seemingly endless energetic realm, the whole place crowded with spirits, phantoms, demons, angels, and even gods, all vying fo r power and dominion. Azazellifted me from my body, my vision drained from my two eyes and reawakened in my spiritual sight, and showed me the spiritual realms from a new vantage. Indeed, there are grand divisions between the multitudes of areas in the worlds of spirit. The illusion cast is that these divisions are naturally occurring; that they are born out of an intrinsic dif­fe rence in ideology or alignment. Just as wars across this world have been instigated and per­petuated by fo rces and minds that would benefit from the blood­shed and the resultant rifts raised, Azazel showed me the one solid group of benefactors in the wars raging across the spiritual worlds: the Demonic Kings. Traveling in Soul beyond the astral plane, even above the mental plane, to those realms wherein all form and all separation ceases, there is no war. Duality crumbles as wholly as time and space, and the Traveler is left with no concern fo r good and evil, no shame nor pride, no us and them. Why, then, are the angels concerned? Why do the elemen­tals, the planetary spirits, the lesser demons, and the wandering phantoms battle against one another, or at the very least clash with one another when called? It would seem that a Creative Divinity exising above the realms of duality would care little fo r spiritual battles, let alone to set Michael and his minions upon those who 46"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"oppose His plan. Such an action from an Eternal being is as ridicu­lous as the notion that any embodiment could threaten the asser­tions of the Omnipotent. No, these worlds below, these worlds held in the ever-swing­ing pendulum of duality, are held in that sway by a sinister and a nefarious fo rce. The general supposition that the Demonic Kings are at the helm of the divisive plot is perhaps too large a blanket to cast. Per­haps terms need to be more aptly defined. According to the Book of Enoch and the legends spawned from that text, Satan opposed God's plan of sending man to earth to struggle through life and to achieve a degree of glory after death through his own efforts. Taking one third of heaven's angels, he waged a war against God, and as a result was thrust down to the earth until the Final Resurrection, when all would be judged. When Enoch and his whole city were lifted into heaven, and when Enoch himself was translated into angelic glory as the angel Metatron, however, a second revolt began. Metatron refused to look away from Azazel's sin of teaching mankind forbidden knowl­edge, petitioning Jehovah to cause Michael to bind Azazel and his cohorts Ouza and Shemyaza, and to cast them to the earth until the final judgment. While this myth can only be taken seriously as an allegory, the realistic root from which it derives does incite some specula­tion. Azazel seeks to teach men the secrets of the gods, to assist them in their Ascent. The path of the Left Hand is that of this very same fo rbidden knowledge. The greatest and most accurate criti­cism of Black Magick is that it delivers to the Worker of Darkness a degree of power fo r which he is ill prepared, speeding his Ascent faster and more furious than he can withstand, resulting in im­mense instability, and granting him abilities that can run rampant with his ego. Azazel is not, however, the typical demon, the impish ser­vant of Satan or some other Dark Lord, but was a grand Angel, an ancient Watcher, and held that status even after he copulated with 47"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"human fe males, and taught men the secrets of warfare, and of witchcraft. All of this is in accordance with the myth. Enoch represents man in Ascent. Once you have reached the state of Absolute liberation, you will feel that you have no need fo r the secret knowledge, and so you seek to bind that fo rbidden aspect, to put away the black magick and the burning candles and to go inwards, and upwards, and fo rwards. But enlightenment has its limitations. Azazel states that: the tales do not recount how I was let loose up on the earth (\"I\" being the momentary embodiment of the fo rbidden), by Enoch (being Ascended souls; men having reached the state of absolute liberation). \"Let loose upon the earth,\" simply means that the spiritual Masters saw great use fo r me, and so the secret, dark, bloody, and sexual rites were taught not by the deviant, but by those who presumed earlier to have known better. There is an art and a science to Ascent. There is only art in the Left Hand, however. It is beauty in its coarsest fo rm. Yo u can find power anywhere. Yo u can only truly enjoy that power through the forbidden. All else stales in short time. Let's play with this subjective universe, then, to enjoy the fo rbidden, and immerse ourselves in it, as there are vast landscapes of possibility that can only be explored by assuming that, contrary to the teachings of Austin Osman Spare, All things are real, yet everything is still permitted. 1 With the various pressures of duality holding all things in their place, the denizens of the fo rbidden, such as Azazel, revel in the continuation of an existence which is darkly lit and which strug­gles amongst itself, lest all consideration fo r the opposites, and therefore fo r its own existence, collapse the whole back into the prime motivator. They siphon the overflow of the universes' power lust, and whisper into the ears of angels and demons incitements which will cause them to continue to war. Their realm is an Infernal Empire, a glorification of that he-48"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"donistic urge which eradicates the otherwise inexorable and instan­taneous movement towards perfection, the likes of which would cause these lower worlds and all therein to cease, in the blinking of an eye. In this manner, all that exists in the worlds of spirit is under the tight yet indiscernible control of the demonic, the dark. Every spiritual kingdom, therefore, be it celestial, terrestrial, Sephirotic, or chthonic is merely a province of the Infernal Empire. Like Babylonia, however, there is a central city, a demonic stronghold, a spiritual Babylon, which can be considered the Infer­nal Empire, proper. All that you can imagine the shattered and nighttime palaces of the Demonic Kings to be, their Babylon is this, and more, as those imaginations are injected into our minds as we connect to this place, and as our minds inject our imaginings into that realm as well, all things fe eding in a circle and a cycle. When I look through the windows between the worlds or when I exit this form and travel through the gateways provided to that demonic Babylon, I see a fo rsaken kingdom, fields blighted and stone buildings crumbling. The sky is liquid amethyst, streaked with waves of ink throughout. The place is alive with noise, with language spoken by the particles of astral air, some alien and indis­cernible tongue, like rolling incantations punctuated with bellows of deep and mocking laughter. Azazel playing the part ofVirgil spoke to me, fr om behind my left shoulder, telling me that this is all illusion. With that speak­ing, the image of the place vanished like a reflection in a pond, and I instead looked out upon a green and flowered valley. That image would not hold, however, and with tremors and the sound of galax­ies crashing, the valley shattered and the Infernal Empire prevailed. All things are illusion, but the illusion is so damned persist­ent. The mind sees what it can most relate to, in the demon and in the demonic landscape. There is a tmique sort of subjective expe­rience, as none of these things are empirically real, from our sensory interaction with the world around us to our magickal interactions with the realms of spirit. The illusion is consistent throughout the human experience, 49"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"however. What I see as a blue sky and gravitational fo rce is not my perception alone, but is shared by my racial siblings. Somewhere in our ancient genetic formation a biological pact was made to in­teract with our environment in a predicable and consistent way. Matter is not solid, gaps between molecules and their elec­trons and the next set of molecules making things that we consider to be concrete quite spacious and fluctuating. It would not be use­ful fo r us to experience the fluctuations or the gaps, however, and so those details are passed over and the illusion of solidity is be­lieved. Such is our interaction with the world of spirit as well, if not more so. Just as the effects of gravity, or the barriers of walls, or the separateness of embodiments can be momentarily displaced to allow fo r the miraculous, to allow fo r conscious shifts in the fabric of what we consider to be solid reality, the apparent nature of the astral kingdoms can be adjusted to our will. And just like the dis­ruption of physical law, as soon as fo cus is withdrawn, the more deeply rooted illusion snaps back into place. These lower worlds are a very persistent illusion. And the illusion is useful to us. The Infernal Empire appears to the human sight to be a dark, dreadful, and often terrifying landscape. This is how our senses can make sense of the thing at all, to assimilate the awareness that what we are encountering when we enter that Em­pire is beyond what our mortal minds should behold, and that in­deed we are probing into secrets forbidden to our fragile race. At sixteen years old, after my dabbling was dabbled and my curiosity was complete, and I laid my hand upon these secret sci­ences with sincerity, worlds upon worlds opened before me. With obsession driving me, I learned to call into this realm any entity that I could name, and some that I couldn't, and I trained myself in the ability to leave my body and to travel through similar gateways to the realms from where the spirits came. I Ascended through these planes and supernormal states of awareness with alarming ease, shedding illusions of self and envi­ronment like serpent's skin, arriving finally at the awareness of Sat Nam, of True Identity- of my Eternal Self, unfettered by Maya. 50"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"I had set out to do this work with Azazel as a matter of cu­riosity, as a novel way to experience new aspects of the same old black magick.

As you see this encompassing spiritual fo rce in the universe, the All, the Magickal thread, there is likewise a secret current beneath even that. The Infernal Empire, the whole of the as­tral realm, the mental, and the physical planes, even the soul plane, are all just masks fo r this other current running through all worlds and all dimensions.

Azazel did not disappoint. THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY Due to the stranglehold that Christianity and Judaism has had around the throat of spirituality in general and the occult in particular, and the obvious incestuous relationship of the church and monarchy, the hierarchy of the hosts of hell has been presented for centuries as a reflection of our own political and military struc­tures. The grand erroneous assumption, born like most of our mis­takes from our egotistic belief that our race and society is reflective of the Divine, has been that the same type of societal and hierarchal structure which exists in our fe eble civilizations would also exist in the worlds of spirit. That perhaps our own hierarchal systems were not created by the conspiring minds of evil and corrupted men, but were delivered to us fr om on High. The classical demonic hierarchy, then, sets Satan as the Em­peror of Hell, ruling over Kings, who rule over Princes, who rule over Marquises, who rule over Dukes, who rule over Earls, who rule over Presidents, who rule over Knights. I have proposed for quite some time now, and still maintain, that Satan is no more than another demon amongst millions, and not an especially notable one outside of one particularly persistent mythology. I laid out the Circle of Demonic Pacts on the floor, the likes of which I had been using fo r each evocation of Azazel. I placed a 52"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"chair in the middle of the Circle, black candles burning at either side, copal resin melting in front of me, filling the room with thick, piney smoke. With notepad and pen in my lap, I called upon Azazel. The air buzzed, filled with invisible, noisy locusts. I could fe el the shift in the pressure around me, my ears plugging, my heart struggling to push liquid to my limbs. I fell through rings of reality, and the incense smoke coalesced into a column, forming the shape of that ebon, horned giant with the legs of an animal, the chest and arms of a man, and a face unmistakably demonic. Azazel had come. I posed a single and simple command: \"Explain the Infernal Hierarchy to me:· I perched the pen between my fingers, the tip scratching at the paper, ready to take the demon's dictation. The shadow figure was silent. I imagined that he was think­ing, or that his mind was reaching into millennia past and through the endless kingdoms of the astral plane to find the answer. He finally gave it: The Infernal Hierarchy is as fo llows: The Operator; and everything else in existence. The form vanished, the incense smoke scattering through the room, taking the shape again as nothing more than smoke. I rose again through those rings of reality, seated in an empty room with a nearly blank notebook page. THE OVERLAP I had assumed, as many do, that I could conjure forth the Demonic Gatekeepers, that I could call them into spectral materi­alization before me, that I could ask them to open a gateway into the demonic realm, that I could direct one of them to possess my wife, and that when I was finished, I could send them away like paid prostitutes. 53"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"What every grimoire has neglected to mention, what every mentor has failed to warn of, is that the moment that you meet with a demon, that demon will in that instant have been with you from the beginning and will endure with you until the end. If we are to accept that any sort of cosmic time can be con­sidered objective and \"real;' dependant only on the expansion of the cosmos and the theoretical increase in entropy, moving towards some critical mass at which point all things will again collapse into a singularity, then in those realms not subject to the various laws of thermodynamics, time cannot objectively exist, but is a m irage of the perceived passage of events. Although entities can assume visible, beholdable fo rms on this plane, the physical eyes do not see the demon, nor do the physical ears hear the fiend, but the percep­tive faculties of the more subtle body correlating with the origin of that spirit translate the raw impressions to the meaty mind, which then distills the information to the mundane senses. For the comfort of our sensibilities, we would like to say that, since time does not exist on the spiritual planes, and since the interaction between the demon and the man occurs wholly on that plane regardless of the beliefs of the physical self, that the meeting has already occurred just as it is presently occurring and will con­tinue to occur in the infinite future. Ergo, the moment that you meet with a demon- as I myself have met with Azazel and his in­fe riors - that spirit will in that instant have been with you from the beginning and will endure with you until the end.

She was not the sort of witch who reads books about candle spells and prays to the goddess. She was a witch long before Gerald Gard­ner and Anton Lavey stepped onto the scene. She was not a witch because she wanted to rebel against her parents or stand out in so­ciety. She was a witch because that is the only word that she knew to apply to her ability to conjure and command invisible forces to her will. She did not learn her witchcraft from books now accessible at every bookstore and library across the country. She learned her spells from the spirits themselves. My mother did not keep me long. She was young, confused, and overwhelmed. My father swore that he was not my father, al­though there could be no earthly other. Into other families I went. None of them held a witch as their matriarch. I was taught to pray, in the name of Jesus, and was disci­plined in the morals of the Church. I played the part well, often recognized as an example of Christian Youth, and was a leader in the various church quorums which I attended. But something else was boiling in my blood. Something that was passed to me from previous generations would not tolerate the fac;:ade. At twelve years old I played with ouija boards. Shortly after, I learned that such a crude medium of spirit communication could be done without, as I could sense and could sometimes see the spir-55"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"its around me, and could converse with them more easily than with others of my own species. The mask nevertheless remained in place. I was a Warrior for Christ, a beacon, and would remain such until I had gathered enough information to walk another path. Between classes and over lunch breaks, I would steal into my school's library, checking over my shoulder for members of my religious congregation, some of which attended my school, and oth­ers who were teachers. I would always find myself buried in one book more than others, a particular book on historical demonology and witchcraft. Amongst the accounts of witch's sabbats and diabolical for­nication stood a copy of a written pact made between some certain nobleman and a demon. According to the contract, the demon would supply the nobleman with wealth, political influence, and as much sex as he could enjoy. In return, the nobleman would, upon his death, relinquish his soul to the demon, and thus into the fires of hell, for eternity. The Catholic Church made a solid point that unless such a pact were made, the witch or warlock could have no hope of wield­ing the powers of witchcraft. This was echoed in Arthur Edward Waite's book, The Book of Ceremonial Magick, in which he asserts: \"Such persons, it is af­firmed, will never succeed in evoking spirits unless they perform, point by point, all that is detailed hereinafter concerning the man­ner of making pacts with any spirit whatsoever:' I Those disciplined in modern occultism will naturally scoff at the idea that, in order to utilize the invisible yet tangible forces which surround and move through each of us, it is requisite to turn your immortal soul over to some imp, and to condemn yourself to a hell which, in any sense of true spirituality, does not even exist at all. The very idea of making pacts with demons is today con­sidered a thing for those long-haired high school Satanists who murder kittens and call it \"sacrifice\"; or, something that might be used by a fundamentalist Christian wishing to rebel against his 56"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"hereditary faith and embrace a world of black magick and blas­phemy which he knows nothing about. Either way, it seems obvious that the demonic pact has no place in the real study and application of the occult, and therefore ought to be dismissed outright. Much of what is done in ritual, in occult application, is are­turn to fantasy. This is not a methodical science, as many hermeti­cists would have you believe; otherwise, every ritual temple and ceremonial altar would by now be replaced with a laboratory, scry­ing mirrors, and a microscope. Something occurs in ritual that can­not be measured by our gadgets and gizmos, and will not be fo r perhaps hundreds of years to come. The ritualist must embrace a series of actions which his intellect cannot possibly believe hold any potency, yet by abandoning himself to the fa ntasy, by momentarily indulging in what would seem at the surface to be nothing more than childish play-acting, a whirlwind of power is unleashed from his temple, and the world around him begins to shift in accordance with the specific symbols inserted into his fantasy play, and with the intention with which the whole thing was originally ap­proached. There is power, and then there are keys to that power. The two ought never be confused with one another. The power of the demonic legions that are raised through the rites given in this book, and indeed in many other grimoires, is objectively and independently real. The keys to that power, how­ever, the sequence necessary to unlock it fo r oneself, can be quite subjective. We stern occultism, in its present incarnation, suffers from a malady of the Master of the Universe syndrome. Man believes that, through the fo cusing of his will and his mental, physical, and even emotional drives, that he can hold absolute power over all events in his personal microcosm. Add into the cauldron the aspect of the esoteric, of a connectedness with the forces which breathed life into the universe, and his ability to mold those fo rces to make the unthinkable occur with absolute nonphysical action, the human being begins to believe that the whole of reality, even its very fabric, can be controlled and manipulated to his liking. 57"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The ego is a valuable tool for any spiritual or m undane un­dertaking. The desires and impulses that power it surge into the environment at the moment of release and send into the cosmos a shockwave of energy that will ripple across the realms and realign reality with the individual's intention. The key to all of this, how­ever, is that the desire, and the ego attachment to that desire, is ac­tually released. Ego, unhampered by any sense of humility, any sense of awe, spins and wears on its own axis, accomplishing little and frustrating the originator. At some point, all desire, all ambition, all pride-and power, must be released. In a working such as the one that I have undertaken - the ninety day evocation of Azazel and His legions - required from the beginning such a release. The desire was for unfettered knowledge and unrestrained power. Such a desire was not borne in moments before first meeting with the demon, but had been building in me my entire life, planted in my infant being as power was taken from me, robbed and beaten out of me. Overcompensation was my modus operandi, and although my lust for power has in moments been sated, the thirst was never fully quenched. The explosion of such fo rbidden desire and its full release occurred in the moment that I signed my name at the bottom of a written pact with Azazel. Looking again at The Book of Ceremonial Magic, I put to use a mandala that had been calling to me for years -Illustration 58"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Plate number nine, co-incidentally- labeled in the book as \"The Goetic Circle of Pacts:' also called, \"The Circle of Demonic Pacts:' According to Waite's instructions, taken fr om The Grand Grimoire, the Circle of Demonic Pacts \"is formed from the skin of the victim (which is a kid; a young goat), fastened to the ground by four nails taken from the coffin of an executed criminal. The skull is that of a parricide; the horns those of a goat; the male bat opposite the skull must have been drowned in blood; and the black cat, whose head forms the fourth object on the circumference of the circle, must have been fed on human flesh:' After such a macabre and seemingly purpose-less arrange­ment of fetish items, Waite continues: \"There is no authority for any of these stipulations:' If there is no authority for such stipulations, it is entirely possible that they were included in The Grand Grimoire as blinds, or purposeful misdirections, intended to render the whole Opera­tion useless to those who take the book at face-value. Another ex­planation for such energetically impotent items is that a good deal of Black Magick is surrounded by an air of the heretical and the bloo dy, and that the sacrifice of a cat, grave robbery, and animal torture lend to the mystery of such works. Either way, outside of primal systems of spirituality such as those which derived fr om the Congo, such inclusions seem to pos­sess a psychological power more than a raw, occult power. What enthralled me was the arrangement of the whole Cir­cle. The circumference is bound with double concentric circles, which is common with most Circles used in the evocation of spirits. However, the Triangle, where the spirit is to manifest, is tradition­ally placed outside of the Circle, ostensibly forming a division or barrier between the Summoner and the Summoned. In this case the Triangle is drawn inside of the Circle, illustrating the direct union between the two, or between the fleshly man and the infernal spirit, serving as an indicator of the intimate nature of the pact itself, which will forever link the two. Three circles are drawn within the Triangle, which, accord­ing to The Grand Grimoire, designate the positions of the Operator, 59"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"who would stand at the uppermost circle, and his two assistants, who would stand in the circles behind him. Such an arrangement is not coinddenta\\, nor sim\\)ly \\)tactical, but is entirely symb olic of the Trinity - either that of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; or of Satan, the False Prophet, and the Antichrist. The list and eval­uation of sacred or unholy trinities in religion could itself ftll an en­tire book, but it seems sufficient to note that the circles, which in themselves represent eternity, are not to be excluded quite as easily as the aforementioned macabre fetish items. To further vindicate my view that, if such a Circle of Pacts is drawn on the ground, in which the Operator will stand or sit while communing with the demonic, that the three smaller circles must be drawn therein and not regarded as simple markers for the positions of the inhabitants of the Circle, all three are connected by lines, and the uppermost circle bears small horns, forming perfectly the astrological symbol of Mercury, which has been held for nearly ten thousand years as the sphere of magick, of initiation, of science and knowledge. Below the triangle is the Labarum, inverted, at either side the symbols of alpha and omega. The views on the meaning of this symbol, specifically as it appears in this case, differ immensely. The lab arum, being a commonly used symbolic representation of the name of Jesus Christ, is most often thought to be present in this Circle of Demonic Pacts as a final safety, a device which will protect the Operator from the entities which he intends to call down before him. The fact that it is inverted could either be a blasphemy, the inversion of the name of Christ; or, as a simple means of allowing the Messiah to \"stand behind you;' as you enter the Gates of Hell. Unfortunately for such a single-minded explanation, the labarum, under the designation of\"Chi Rho;' has also been used to symbolize Chronos, or \"Time:' The general idea behind the symbol is that, like Jesus' self-assertion that he is ''Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end;' that the figure to whom the labarum is attributed is a master of time, or is outside of time altogether. As for the names inscribed outside of the whole Circle, these are the names of four major fallen angels, or Watchers, interestingly 60"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"tied to Azazel and his ilk, each of them responsible, like Azazel, fo r teaching men fo rbidden knowledge. Amsarac taught the use of herbs and plants in the fashion­ing of spells and enchantments. Berkaial taught the art of divina­tion and prophecy through the movements of the planets and the stars. Akibeellikewise taught the mysteries of the stars, and of the earth. Asaradel taught the secrets of the moon. As I traced the final Circle of Pacts with all of the above con­siderations on a large black mat, I recognized that it serves a pur­pose that is similar to the evocation of the Gatekeepers. A portal into the infernal realm. The names of the fallen angels, were then replaced by the names of Belial, Amaymon, Abaddon, and Azazel. When the draft was completed on the thick, black mat, the whole image was redrawn in red paint. I could sense the energy rising from the image even before laying a single candle within it, or causing the smoke of my incense to waft above it, as if the lines and the symbols and the names were automatically imbued with some strange power, independent of any spiritual effort from me. The incessant prompting to make a pact with Azazel, to turn the fullness of my spiritual and material welfare over to that demon, to submit myself to him wholly tugged at me fo r weeks. My every evocation of him seemed empty, unfulfilling. He would rise, and he would speak, but there was a sense that he was waiting for something, as if his immortal tongue was knotted and could only be loosened once the pact was made. The reality is that, until I released my overwhelming desire and even need to subjugate him, and instead placed myself as his disciple, my ears were not suffi­ciently poised to receive the deeper mysteries of his demonic power. Stooped on one knee before the towering black figure, I pro­claimed, \"Azazel, I covenant to take all that you will teach me, to utilize it in my own Ascent and material gain, and to make a written record of my experiences with these teachings:' Without a word, the demon vanished, leaving me with the realization that a half-assed proclamation of the obvious was not considered, in his eyes, to be equivalent to a Demonic Pact. 61"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Mulling over the idea of making a sincere pact with Azazel, I cycled through the various emotions and thoughts associated with that. The whole thing was initially dismissed as a cheap and prac­tically useless relic of medieval Catholic demonology, fo llowed di­reedy with the self-admonition to not follow this black rabbit too deeply into its hole, lest I find myself an unwitting victim of de­monic obsession. Making a tacit pact, in full conscious mind, however, would instead be a devotional Operation, a willing dive into the unknown. The idea of a pact, which had at first seemed silly and spiritually infantile, began to morph into a very sinister alliance. I had no rea­son to trust Azazel, and I knew that in not simply writing a pact with flashy, middle-English words, but in doing the internal work of turning myself over to the demon, I was thrusting myself into the inferno in hopes to discover where fire came from. It was indeed this internal work that occurred over the fol­lowing three days, as I considered not only the pact itself, but more the implications of the pact. Azazel, Grand Demon and Gatekeeper of the Infernal Empire; I make and sign this covenant with you.

Azazel, in your name, and in the names of Belial, Abaddon, and Amaymon, I call the Gates of the Infernal Empire to open to me, and fo r this Pact with you to be accepted. I signed the Pact, and passed it to the front of the Circle of Pacts. Azazel's black hand touched the paper, and a glowing symbol appeared thereon, a pentagram circled, and crossed with a V. Be­neath this symbol appeared five characters, materializing on the paper from right to left. I had no idea what the symbol was; but the characters where most definitely the demon's signature. Seal the Pact with your blood. I took a dagger and sliced my palm, blood oozing from the gash and falling upon the paper, beneath my signature. I pressed my thumb into the spatter. A laugh echoed from the black demon as his fo rm dissi­pated from before me. The pact was accepted. I traced over Azazel's otherworldly autograph, mainly fo r a piece of personal memorabilia, and tucked the written pact away. The demonic pact represents a turning of your whole wel­fare over to the demon with which the pact is made, in return fo r a 63"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"thing that could otherwise not be delivered. The pact is a symbol for the western mind of complete submission to the demon. You no longer try to subjugate. Three days after entering this pact with Azazel, and that demon having accepted my covenants, a business contract which had for over a ye ar provided my main financial support, fell through. The· specific contract locked me into less of a salary than I could find elsewhere, but with what seemed to be guaranteed longevity. Though monetary gain has always flowed to me, or is pulled to me, through nonphysical means, I have nevertheless al­ways maintained full-time work, both to keep my hands and mind busy as well as to ensure that I can provide for myself and my child, without negative fluctuation. I had met with the company president only weeks previous, as we often met to discuss the current direction of the company and my role in its continued success. In that meeting, all was well and indeed the company profits seemed to be accelerating. The day following the signing of the pact, the secretary ap­pointed to manage the clerical aspects of exclusively my tasks was laid off. Two days after the pact, I was asked to double my efforts in the following week to collect outstanding debts from existing clients, and to \"wrap up\" their existing services. On the third day, I met with Andrew, the acting president of the company. \"I don't like the writing on the walls;' I told him, without much salutation. \"Should I be worried?\" Andrew's lip quivered. \"Yes. Yes, you probably should be:' \"Well, what's going on?\" I prodded. ''I'm pulling all of my support out of this company, and forming my own service:' While he was the president of the company, Andrew was not the owner. The owner, Andrew's good friend, had built the business to a point of ne arly guaranteed and automated continua­tion, had turned the day-to-day operations over to Andrew, and moved out of the country, content with a percentage of net profits. Andrew was required to do very little else than pay subcontractors to service existing contracts and continue utilizing the established 64"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"marketing avenues to gain new contracts. For his minimal efforts, he was able to afford two elaborate homes in affluent neighbor­hoods, and several \"company vehicles\" for his personal use, on top of a generous salary. I don't blame anyone for pursuing their entrepreneurial whims, for wanting to start something that is entirely theirs, but in this particular case, it just didn't seem to make sense. The ethical issues behind the whole scheme seemed to run contrary to An­drew's personal morals as well. As I probed with more questions, it seemed that although the company was turning a healthy profit, and although there was no reason to think that this would decline at any point in the future, Andrew was intent on leaving the company, which would, due to the lack of any financial or organizational support, disintegrate within weeks. In discussing the matter with another contractor, I discov­ered that Andrew and the owner had had a \"falling out\" only days before, coinciding with the moment of the signing of the pact. Rather than accepting the even more generous offer from the owner for full partnership in the company, Andrew was consumed with spite. He immediately had his attorney draw up the paperwork to form not only his own corporation, but one in direct competition with the one that paid both his and my salaries. In the two weeks remaining before he transferred his attention fully into his own cor­poration, Andrew's revenge was taken into full unethical action by recruiting nearly all of his friend's employees for his new company, and signing service contracts with existing clients for his own busi­ness, thereby guaranteeing the fatal starvation of the golden goose. Through all of this, the only position that would not be transferred to his new company was the one that I filled. The needed equipment and service was more of an investment than he was willing to put in. Confounded, I asked him for a letter of rec­ommendation, which he delightfully wrote right away, and I left his office, disheartened. I knew that I had no reason to trust Azazel from the begin­ning. I knew that placing my spiritual and mundane affairs in the 65"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"hands of a demon was far from wise, but I honestly did not antici­pate having my very lifeline pulled out from under me. I spent the following week contacting every potential em­ployer and contractor, to no avail. No one was hiring, and those who were were swamped with candidates. The Demonic Lords under Azazel were with me constantly, buzzing around me like a swarm of flies, busily working on some­thing that I could not divine. I re-read my notes on my evocations of Azazel and his consorts, as well as the pact, looking fo r some clue as to what was happening. \" ... in exchange fo r this Pact, you and your Demons will en­sure the flow of prosperity and monetary wealth into my life, which I may use fo r any purpose.\" The presence of one particular Dark Lord remained more pronounced than the others. I could feel him with me, as if he walked by my side, and could sense that the others of the swarm obeyed his commands. At times, I could see his cloaked body out of the corner of my eye. Whatever was happening in my life, he was to blame. I threw the Circle of Demonic Pacts onto the ground, which had become the only mandala that I used to call upon the demons, followed by two black candles at either side of me. I lit the coal within the censor, and before it could turn red, I began heaping in­cense resin onto it. ''Alash tad al-ash tal ashtu!\" I spat into the empty air, repeat­ing the chant again and again, pulling that demon towards me, into this world from his Saturnian nether-realm. ''Ant'harratu, stand before me to answer my displeasure. Alash tad al-ash tal ashtu!\" The smoke flooding the room gathered before me, not in the north, as Azazel always did, but before me and to my left, in the northwestern corner. His black hood covered his eyes, but I could see the constant grin on his marble cold face, and could feel the calm reeking from him. \"By the Pact made between Azazel and myself, you are to 66"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ensure the flow of prosperity into my life. Instead, you have taken wealth away from me, and have left me with no way to provide for myself' The demon stood silent, still smiling, still calm. \"How do you answer this?\" The demon paused, not to collect his thoughts, not to for­mulate a response, but to allow me a moment of silence, so that his words would not need to be repeated. \"You have not demanded prosperity. Yo u have demanded the flow of prosperity, and of monetary wealth. How can that river flow when you have placed a blockage therein? We have removed the one obstacle.\" My eyes darted left and right while I processed not only his words, but the obvious potentialities behind them. Ifl had after all set myself up as a pawn to be destroyed by Azazel and his armies, this ploy to keep me sedated would make sense. What made more sense, however, was the possibility that Ant'harratu was not trying to deceive or placate me, but was instead being truthful. My busi­ness contract was, in fact, quite an obstacle to any continued gain in prosperity, but it was a welcomed one in its supposed certainty of continuity. \"You will then provide another route of guaranteed fmancial success?\" I asked. \"This has already been done. Remember now this same Pact, in which you covenant to turn your temporal welfare into Our hands, and to fo rsake all other gods, demons, spirits, angels, or powers. Do not break your oath.\" The figure vanished, and as the smoke cleared from the room, I realized the utter foolishness of such wording in the pact. In order to continue this journey and to have delivered to me the knowledge that I was sure only Azazel held, I would be forced to trust Him and his demons entirely, as my oath bound me from 67"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"using any of the other occult methods of summoning success that had proven efficacious in the past. I had played my hand, and Azazel had played his. All of our chips and all of our cards were on the table. I resolved to remain true to my oath, and prepared myself for homelessness. I continued to do the physical work needed to tlnd employment, and hoped with fingers crossed that I was not a fool, nor a pawn, but that my original hope that through Azazel I would attain and obtain a good portion of what I sought after was not in vain. Thirteen days following the signing of the pact with Azazel, one day before my failing employment was to expire, I received a call from a potential employer, to whom I had submitted a resume and portfolio at the onset of my crisis. The office manager asked me to meet with her and with the company owner to discuss pos­sible employment. Rather than meeting in their office, however, they invited me for Saturday morning coffee in their home. A young, striking, blonde woman answered the door, Au­tumn, co-owner and oftlce manager, only three or four years older than I was. As I sat at their heavy, wooden dining room table, the walls covered in picture frames and accessories that only a woman could enliven a home with, and the scent of potpourri candles danc­ing in the air, her husband - the company owner and operator -joined us. They both announced that they had already sifted through hundreds of candidates, and had already chosen an applicant for their position, but that an unknowable something had urged them to speak with me before finalizing my competitor's career. We discussed my background, history, personal life, and my interest not only in their job offer, but in the industry itself, all with an organic flow to the conversation, versus the usual interview­grilling that I had expected. The couple was young, energetic, hu­morous, and quite successful. The position that they were offering was for a field assistant for Jason, as he was the only field technician in his small business. He was a perfectionist, and therefore wasn't going to trust the continued success of his business to multiple 68"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"crews and mass production. I told him that I'd agree to come on as his assistant, but that I am, by nature, an ambitious person, and I wanted to know what plans he had fo r me in the company's future. Jason and Autumn looked at each other, his answer being one that they had apparently spoken of in great length, and were only now verbalizing this to an outside party. \"I want to train you to take over my job. To run the company. If you're capable, I want to hand over the day-to-day operations of the business, so that we can pursue other business interests. If this works out, we could even talk about a partnership in the companY:' They had already chosen a candidate fo r the position. They had already established the day and time for this other person to begin work. But something else had intervened. The indiscernible urge to meet with me condensed as we spoke into not only a job offe r, but a potential partnership. The pair revealed to me the financial position of the com­pany, which was quite lucrative, and hinted at the fa ct that, ifi could prove my ability to run the company, I could easily double my in­come in two years, and triple it within five. I left the meeting thirty minutes later employed, all obsta­des removed. In the months following, after beginning my work with this new company, Jason told me that, although he still needed to teach me how he pitches sales and closes deals, and how he services con­tracts, that of the thirty or more candidates he had trained, I was the first that he would trust his company with. The tower crumbled, and then was rebuilt. I was looking fo r a way to pay the bills. Azazel had greater plans for me, though. He would not allow me to make a simple living, but insisted that I elevate myself in every manner, especially financially. I assumed that this was the fullness of Azazel's work in that respect to the Pact. The money that I was making, and that would continue to multiply, seemed grand indeed. I was content. I am contented by such simple things. Azazel's vision of an Empire differed greatly from mine. 69"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Befor e Azazel would release me from his service, he would ensure that I would not carry his name without being a fit repre­sentative of what real power looked like. At the time of this present writing, I am engaged in five ex­traordinarily lucrative projects. In none of them am I an employee. One of these projects will make me a great amount of money over the next two years, guaranteed. Two of these projects will make a conservative amount of money over a longer period, but they are also guaranteed. The remaining two projects will take one to three years to bring to mature fruition, after which point I will essentially retire from the necessity to work for a living, at all. All of this materialized, literally brought to my doorstep, within weeks of signing the Pact. I did not seek these opportunities out; they sought me ou t. Azazel had a great task before Him, when He agreed to the terms of the Pact. He was required to bring wealth to a person who didn't care for it, and then He was to teach that person how to man­ifest in the physical world sensory objects and physical delights for which I was entirely indifferent. He had to alter my perception of myself as a being in this world, in order to show me my own capacity for greatness in this world. I had failed to define what my Empire would look like with­out resorting to a vocabulary composed of grunts and whines, and so He interjected His own vision, so that I could see what wealth, fulfillment, accomplishment, and real and tangible power looked like. Although it may seem obvious that the demonic pact has no place in the real study and application of the occult, and there­fore ought to be dismissed outright, in adhering to Azazel's charge to offer such a clear and distinct devotion to him and to his men­torship, it was not only the pact that momentarily crumbled my fi­nanciallife, but it was the power of the pact that caught the falling bricks just in time to erect a tower that could potentially reach to the heavens, at least monetarily. 70"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"As I continued in my progress through Azazel's teachings, it became increasingly clear that he was not simply teaching me the same mystical escapism to which I had become accustomed, but instead was guiding me into the step-by-step exaltation of every as­pect of my life.

Perhaps \"mis­taken'' is too harsh a self judgment. My assumptions have been in­complete. It has been assumed, for thousands of years now, that man is an independent thinking being who, by some mystery, has caught a glimpse of an existence and a reality beyond his physicality, and that he has since and still is struggling to transcend his body and its limitations. For quite some time, death seemed to be the great - and in fact the only - method of transference of consciousness beyond this plane. The idea of an afterlife, which is either more glorious or more comfortable or more enduring or somehow better than the physical world, provides at least a fantasy and a hope for the tran­scendence of the human consciousness into a realm or a place greater than the physical. When the sorcerers and shamans learned that the finite consciousness could be ejected from the body, and even from the brain, and possibly even expanded infinitely into all things, merging with some amorphous unified spiritual field, the hope and the fan­tasy was transformed and, it could be said, replaced with an active process of spiritual Ascent - of conscious spiritual transmigration. Even if such a transmigration of the soul occurred after the death of the physical body, the end result was no longer seen as assured. Instead, the deeds done in the flesh would dictate the state of glory 73"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"received in the hereafter. The more advanced shamans and prophets, however, rec­ognized that the afterlife experience did not necessarily need to occur after life, but could be beheld and participated in during life through methods as diverse as prayer and revelation, the use of en­theogenic plants and compounds, sexual orgy, sensory deprivation, and prolonged meditation. By whatever means, in learning how to actively activate the projection of the finite mind into infinite states of awareness, a whole mythology formed as to the nature of the spiritual realm, di­viding what had until that point been considered \"the spirit world\" into various degrees or depths of penetration, now often segregated into planes, such as the astral plane, the mental plane, the ethereal plane, and so on. My entire approach to the world of spirituality has been centered around two fundamental practices, without which I be­lieved that the whole process of spiritual development stagnates. Those two cornerstone spiritual practices are the evocation of ex­ternal consciousnesses and the translocation of one's own con­sciousness. This can be clarified even further by stating that the process of spiritual development is two-fold: the projection of the self into the worlds of spirit; and the reverse flow of bringing the powers and intelligences within those worlds into this one. I have termed the former \"Ascent;' and the latter, \"Convergence:' My faulty assumption has been the same erroneous suppo­sition made for millennia: that the human state is imperfect and needs to be transcended, and even escaped from, into those more perfect worlds beyond. Through my own active transmigration through the worlds of spirit, my individual form gradually dissolving into an Eternal Mind and omnipresent locus, when I had reached the point of com­plete unification with the Eternal, momentarily possessing in a con­scious way the attributes of omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience, I declared that this is the natural state of man. 74"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"From my most recent work, Ipsissimus: \"In fact, it is not the consciousness which is expanded, being the awareness of the self as a microcosm in relation to the greater macrocosm, but instead it is the identity of the spiritual self that needs to be expanded. In that expan­sion, however, in the states of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience, the individual comes to the stark realiza­tion that there is no individual soul, there is no \"spiritual self\" to be expanded, but that such is a very solid metaphor used as a tool to enter into the awareness of the boundless­ness of all things. If you can expand yourself into every­thing, in all places at once, what is being expanded, and did it ever exist in a minute form? This is all Maya, a trick we play on ourselves, to believe that we are separate from that which surrounds us, and therefore necessitates our entrance into those objects, spaces, and psyches. With repetition, it is realized without exception that you are not entering into objects apart from yourself, nor are you expanding into an endless space outside, but that you are transferring your awareness into another part of your own Eternal body:'1 Evolution, whether genetic, social, spiritual, or in any other fo rm and incarnation, seems to be a law with as much solidity as gravity. The incompleteness of my assumptions began with the sup­posed realization that the process of Ascent, of the active transmi­gration of the soul while still incarnated in a finite form, is in itself an evolutionary process. If we are inherently and fundamentally Eternal beings, naturally possessing the latent faculty of entering states of omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence, then sim­ply activating that dormant aspect of ourselves is not evolution at all, any more than a cripple regaining use of his legs is evolution. 75"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I consciously and actively began this process of Ascent when I was twelve years old. At the writing of this book, I am thirty. For eighteen years I have not been working towards spiritual evo­lution, as I had arrogantly presumed. Instead, I have only been learning to use those parts of my own being which have, through millennia of atrophy, become crippled. And only now, at this juncture, when I find the whole of my life devoted to the most foul demon, does actual evolution begin. Azaze\\ carried my vision aw ay from my living room, from the Circle of Pacts laid out on the floor, from the candlelight and the gyrating shadows. He carried my vision outside of this planet, but not far, the short journey ending in front of the ringed planet Saturn. \"The Infernal Empire can be accessed through the moon in the dark ring of Saturn.\" The voice, which did not originate from a form, silenced, and my opened eyes stared no longer at that planet, but at my living room walls once again. I had long understood that Saturn, under the name Binah, is recognized as one of the four gateways beyond the realm of causality into a realm of chaos. The enormous rings of Saturn possess within them a dark ring, known as Cassini's Division, which is thou ght to have been formed by the gravitational displacement of the ring pattern by the moon Mimas. It was this moon, a moon capable of disrupting the harmony of Saturn's flowing rings, that Azazel pointed to as a gate­way into the Infernal Empire. On questioning Ant'harratu on this gateway, that demon seeming to have become my constant invisible companion, he de­livered five more \"gateways\" to be inscribed. 76"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Ant'harratu showed me the first gateway, calling it, \"The Gateway of Pacts:' It is to be drawn on the ground around the Op­erator, to make additional pacts with the Demonic King, or to be used in place of a Triangle of Manifestation, placed outside of the Circle, into which the summoned demon will materialize. A red candle is to be placed between each \"verse\" within the circles. The inscriptions on the first gateway form the Grand Invo­cation of the Pact: ''Alash tad al-ash tal ashtu.\" The utterance of the Invocation, or the inscribing of its characters conjures the fullest obedience to the Pact, by the demons and by the maker of the Pact. The characters had been shown to me nearly a decade be­fo re, as I transcribed the grimoire, Kingdoms of Flame as that book was delivered to me by the mouths of the spirits within its pages. Until this moment, in taking this information from similar alien and demonic sources, I have had no phonetic pronunciation for the characters, but understood them simply to be a written yet unspeakable language. Now, in only whispering the words, new levels of their power have been unveiled. I have also seen this exact seal, drawn above, as I have trav­eled away from my body and into the Infernal Empire, to that shad­owed den where Azazel sits on his obsidian throne, the seal glowing in iridescent azure to his left side. 77"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"This second gate is to be placed upon any object in order to connect it to Azazel's legions, as a type of consecration of that ob­ject.

From the moment that the world of the occult became real fo r me, when I began to study the actual application of the mysteries of religion, I came across inscriptions of gates that could lead the individual beyond this plane of flesh and substance and into higher degrees of glory. Learning to leave my body and float through the ethereal worlds was fine, but having a gateway through which I could project myself to one exact spot tempted to deliver all of the 79"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"secrets of power to me. The Black Magician within me licked his lips and prepared to soar. An abandoned racquetball court sitting on the same lot as one of the county's oldest and most unused cemeteries, the same dilapidated structure in which I had performed numerous night­time evocations seemed perfect for this experiment. With a fistful of chalk grabbed from a bag of my basic ritual implements, I inscribed the first gateway on the ground, large enough fo r me to stand within it. I passed over the second gateway, as it seemed more functional than the others, and instead drew the last three gateways on the walls around me. I stood, to view the circle beneath me, and slowly turning as if on an axis, I let my eyes unfocus, and I looked through the chalk lines, through the written characters, my mind falling and falling deeper into them. I whispered the words, ''Alash tad al-ash tal ashtu:' My consciousness descended into the thetan t rance, and turned quickly towards the spiritual rapture that ruptures all boundaries. The floor dropped out from beneath me, and my body fell to the concrete ground. Before my skin could smack the cold surface, I found myself again before Azazel. He sat on a throne composed of living obsidian, moving like molten shadow, slither­ing. His body was neither the black satyr nor the monstrous raven, but a coalesced darkness with eyes like burning sapphire, staring into nothingness as if contemplating how to influence the next thousand years, staring into a distant vision of his unfolding plan. Above his head swarmed his Legions, not in bodies as they appear when summoned, but as a spiraling, living smoke circling their Master. Within seconds, I was ejected from His presence, back into my body. Catching my breath as if I had not inhaled once while I was gone, I rubbed my arms, noticing new scrapes I had gotten when my body had slumped to the concrete ground. 80"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"I focused my vision on the third gateway. As the lines flashed and the images fa ded and reappeared in three glowing di­mensions, the wall upon which the seal was drawn decomposed, the molecules spreading farther apart, the spaces between the elec­trons and the nucleus of every atom widening. A doorway ap­peared, and I stepped through it. A desert awaited me on the other side of the gateway, the cracked and barren black earth holding a sea of demons, vicious and fanged and desperate to attack, to pour through the gateway to my side of it, to this earth and this realm, to file through that open doorway. A blue glow caught my attention to my left, and when I looked down I saw on the ground beside me the seal of the first gateway, which was also inscribed next to Azazel's throne. I could sense that the seal of the Pact would not only protect me fr om the hideous army, but could also allow me to command those terrifying legions. The shining doorway closed as I returned again to my body. I looked upon the fo urth gateway drawn on the concrete wall, gazing into it, beyond the lines, beyond the concrete, and that doorway opened. Stepping through the door led me to an ancient temple, the high, stone walls dripping with some sort of phospho­rescent moisture, the condensation oozing through the astral mor­tar. The sound of drawn-out chanting surrounded me, single syllables not separated by the need for the cantor to catch his breath between them. As I moved through the empty, stone hallway, the volume of the sound did not fa de nor did it increase, as if the walls themselves were singing the endless mantra. My steps led me to an open chamber where cloaked figures moved slowly about, carrying small, metal boxes and shimmering orbs, none of them speaking to one another but seeming to be working cooperatively on some task. I recognized one of the figures as Ant'harratu, and in the moment of this recognition, his stare turned to me. I opened my eyes, back in my body, without ever hav­ing willed myself to return. 81"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The final gateway opened as I gazed into it. Rather than being greeted by specters or forms or any sort of structure, I found myself in an anomalous haze of colored smoked moving around me, not drifting freely but pushing itself to and fro, a thousand whispers carried between the passing of the plumes of smoke. When I returned for the last time to my body, I was not alone. A demon was there waiting for me. I could sense him, but could not see him, as I had performed no evoca tion, I had lit no in­cense smoke to bring him into form. Nevertheless, something had followed me back through one of the gateways. I knelt within the seal of the Pact, retrieved my censor from my bag and lit one of the round coals, watching the salt peter within it spark and the black surface of the coal turn to a glowing red. Set­ting a shard of copal resin on the hot coal, the area instantly filled with sweet smoke. Before the haunting demon could materialize in it at my command and the push of my will, however, I saw that it was Ant'harratu. Pressure built around my ears, a unique sort of pressure that I have only experienced when a voice from the other side penetrates into this world. I focused my mind to make out the words. \"You have become obsessed with escaping this world, escaping your body, fly ing away from it instead of embracing the flesh,\" the demon taunted. \"When this world is miserable, when you see the misery around you, rather than acting as a God would act, rather than commanding the tempest to cease, you instead flee. Th is is th e fi nal incarnation, the world into which you have fo rced yourself, yet rather than fu lfilling your purpose here - which is to become a god in this, the only realm where that is possible - you instead struggle to leave this world and disappear into that infinite nothingness, the omnipresent quandary from which you descended. This world, this life of yours, is the next phase of your existence. Eternity is not a cycle, but is an ever-constant expansion of the self. Now that you have achiev ed both the realization of your infinitude, and the singularity-state of the physical body, 82"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"you can begin to expand from that singularity. \" From there, the demon's words blurred as a growing trans­figuration gripped me. Rather than having a conversation on this plane between two beings, a merger between minds occurred. In the same moment as Ant'harratu had traveled here, I found myself also with him in that forsaken temple beyond this world, in the In­fernal Empire. I found myself at the Crossroads between the worlds, and words became impotent to convey meaning. Instead, I received information, the extent of which has taken me quite some time to sort through and to make any logical sense of. I saw that the essence which is so often called the human \"soul\" has not migrated to these physical bodies by some quantum energetic displacement, but through a great deal of active force. The omnipotent and limitless power and intelligence that dwells within us has pushed its way into these bodies - has infused itself within our cells and our genes. While I have thought all along that we are human beings struggling to become Gods, in actuality we are Gods who have struggled to become human beings. The work that lies before us, now, is to take dominion over this realm, to make perfect and lim­itless even this most course and barren physical state. \"Why have you given me these gateways, then, if I am not to travel through them?\" I asked my otherworldly guide. \"Have you not considered that perhaps there is a work at hand which transcends you and your desire to see into the My steries? Have you considered that perhaps it is the work of the My steries to understand you? Because you desire so strongly to travel into Our world, it is diff icult fo r you to un­derstand how fierce our desire is to travel into Yo urs.

No other spirit, angel, elemental, or intelli­gence can tear down the walls of singular consciousness and allow the Evocator to peer into his own limitless potential as aptly as the demonic. Simply possessing the sigils, names, and attributes of the demons are not quite enough to be able to call on them; neither is any limerick infused with references to Satan, Darkness, or other night-time mental memorabilia .. The power of evocation is an invisible power, which is able to produce visible and quite tangible results. The candles and con­jurations are all methods of stimulating the internal powersource into unlimited generation, and of stimulating the immediate envi­ronment, setting aflame the inert spiritual molecules in the room in order to house the fiend that will certainly rise. The elementary principles of evocation1 stand, and are to be applied here, to the Infernal Realm, to the demons that will be summoned. PREPARATORY IMMERSION The subjective synthesis, which is the integration or full in­sertion of the individual into the system and paradigm in which he will operate, is essential to his ability to summon forth an unreal entity from the depths of universal imagination into objective and observable reality. In modern times, with worldwide information as accessible as mouse clicks and button presses, such a preparatory immersion into the realm of the spirit is most often and most easily conducted through intellectual identification with the system, through a sort of mental immersion, prolonged as to blur the barrier between the real and the imagined. If the intellect can be bypassed altogether by carving a direct route into the imagination, an undisturbed path beyond ordinary observation will allow the Operator to descend, without limitation, 86"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"into a world where mystery and miracle are made manifest. An exponentially self-multiplying process begins, as my own process began with Azazel: an initial evocation of the demon momentarily solidifies its reality in your observation; subsequent evocations of that same demon further substantiate its place in this altered reality, causing the observed reality to be superimposed upon the previously accepted reality; and finally, through a sort of immersion that can only be described as fanatical, the self-created, superimposed reality becomes the dominant observation - the demon summoned forth from universal imagination becomes a more solid observation than the physical world in which the oper­ator exists daily. The Pact cannot be made with any degree of seriousness until this final stage of disidentification with impossibilities is reached. Once such a fanatical stage is reached, however, the Pact is the only possible option. No greater immersion into the world of impossibility ex-ists. THE USE OR DEVELOPMENT OF A WORKING SYSTEM Somewhere along mankind's spiritual evolution, we discov­ered specific, syntactical methods by which invisible or even imag­inary forces can play upon this three dimensional realm, to often alarming degrees. A two-way bridge was then drawn between the \"spiritual\" and the \"physical;' or otherwise between the imaginative and the real, allowing that which is physical to pass into the spiri� tual, and that which is spiritual to effect the physical. As we near the fast approaching next evolutionary jump, the boundaries between the two are dissolving. Indeed, within short time, we will see that there is no difference between the imag­ined and the real, or the spiritual and the physical. The closer in time that we draw towards this singularity, the less mysterious any 87"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"of it seems. The spiritual systems which have guided our evolution thus far do indeed work, they do indeed produce results if followed properly and with proper intent. This is no longer a mystery. The mystery that remains, however, is why it works at all. Could we not simply imagine that whatever nonsense we concoct would possess the same power as the kabala or tantra or prayer, and because we are operating in a realm of the imaginative anyways, such nonsense would be as efficacious as any of these other, established systems of nonphysical operation? We are all born into not only bodies of flesh and a world of substance, but also into a medium of shared memory and observa­tion. We are all quite telepathic, although our telepathy operates very covertly, as to not disturb our consciously operating minds too much. The environment possesses far too much information to sort through consciously while still functioning as an objective organ­ism, and so as soon as our brains begin to rece ive and transmit data, they synchronize their discriminatory processes to the collective mind, learning what observations are commonly discarded and which are commonly accepted and acted upon. As the brain and body develop, these discriminations are in effect hardwired into the hardware. A sort of psychic entanglement has taken place, where the system no longer needs to search for ac­ceptable rejection or acceptance points for information, but the order of operations runs automatically. The crack in the veneer of common observation, the entry point for the Spiritual Traveler, is in the very social paradigm which seems to obfuscate real spiritual development. In the western cul­ture, it is not acceptable to consider that by merely bringing into full observation an altered course of events, past or future, that ob­servable reality will realign with that observation. It is acceptable, however, for a person to recognize that intense and faithful prayer can cause illness to dissipate, or can bring opportunities that may otherwise be out of reach. In certain western subcultures, it is ac­cepted that through ritual, often of the hermetic sort, life's circum­stances can be altered in sometimes amazing ways. In places like Haiti and the Congo, a black priest can point 88"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"his finger at a victim, pronounce a single syllable, and the victim will fall to his death instantly. Or by touching a certain stone that has been enchanted, a grapefruit-sized tumor can develop within hours. This is accepted as very real in these places, and indeed such practices and their results are quite well known, while in the United States such claims are barely graced with a scoff. What is of real interest, however, is not only that the efficacy of such nonphysical interactions is accepted or not, but that the whole potency of the action is greatly diminished outside of the re­gions in which they are accepted. Despite the claims of most re­searchers into this phenomenon, this has very little to do with psychological self-sabotage by natives of those regions, but is in­stead reliant on the natural and intrinsic immersion of the individ­ual into a very specific imaginative or consciousness subset. In the middle part of the last century, it was popular fo r those seeking spiritual enlightenment to travel to India and seek out a guru there who could teach them. Even though the Vedic knowledge is accessible in the west, and even though many Hindu gurus have relocated to the United States, it was understood that real enlightenment in that system could not occur unless the seeker immersed himself fully in Hindu life . Similarly, it is understood that in order to be initiated into Haitian Vodoun, one needs to travel to Haiti, spend a certain amount of time on the island, and be ini­tiated into the religion there. Such pilgrimages are common in a variety of religious and mystical paths, and signify more than simple devotion and sacrifice to the religion, but involve a process of im­mersion into the system, and surrounding oneself with the devotees of the religion. This allows fo r a resynchronization with a n ew col­lective observation. What this all comes to is that, because of the limitations im­posed by yourself on yourself, in order to penetrate into the Mys­tery, a reliance on that which is established in your own culture as effective is required. Alternatively, the adoption of another culture and system is also effective. Eventually, you can indeed simply alter your observation of anything whatsoever, and thereby cause a dramatic shift in reality, 89"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"without any prolonged ritual or observation or formality of any sort. At such a point, you may then imprint the imaginative medium with any idea that you desire, and such an imprint will glisten with all of the power of the ancient spiritual secrets. There is a ladder that must be climbed out of the collective observation and into true liberation, however. ATTAINMENT OF OMNIPOTENCE Humans are multidimensional entities, existing in twenty­four dimensional hyperspace, yet normally only experiencing four of these dimensions on a conscious level, those of height, depth, width, and time. The fifth dimension of Consciousness is experi­enced at a less conscious level, until deeper mystical states are achieved in which the consciousness of all things is realized, con­sciously. During sleep, meditation, ritual, and prayer, as many as eight dimensions may be experienced at one time. In the most ec­static states of Soul Travel, when ego identity is dissolved and form and formless unite, twelve dimensions can be briefly experienced. In such a state, however, relative time is elongated, causing mere milliseconds to be experienced as minutes, hours, or even days. In order to evoke an entity into four-dimensional material­ization, simple four-dimensional models of action and interaction are not sufficient. The Evocator is not summoning an entity from another realm as much as he or she is summoning existence as a whole to alter entirely enough to allow such an impossibility to be­come present. It is his task, then, to create a new world, a world wherein gods and spirits commune with mortals, and then to re­place the former world with the one of his creation. The issue of \"attaining omnipotence\" is less of actively working towards such a state, but instead is a relinquishing of the four-dimensional consciousness to the rapture of the ritual. As the theta-gamma sync is triggered and the worlds begin to collide, a 90"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"peculiar sort of mental fugue and exhaustion sets in. From my work on the subject of evocation, Evoking Eternity: \"It is also at this point in the ritual of evocation that light­headedness, physical exhaustion, and general weariness will begin to manifest. At first, the Evocator will fear that he does not possess the natural stamina to complete the ritual, or will be hounded by the anxiety that in such a state he will not be able to wrestle with the spirit for control. .. The state of weakness can be more appropriately called a state of rap­ture. The body is being transfigured, prepared by a power that is beyond the flesh to see and hear that which is also beyond the flesh. The mild exhaustion which you feel at this point early on in the ritual will increase as the ritual progresses and as the spirit moves closer to materialization within the Triangle. Do not fight it, as in doing so you will be fighting the very thing which will lift you from your dying state into one of Godly power, but instead give into the exhaustion. Allow it to overwhelm you. As the ritual moves forward and the rapture grows more fervent, you may begin to feel as if you are near complete conscious col­lapse and will faint at any moment. You must walk the line between the blackness of unconsciousness and the willed command over your own body, giving up your will to do anything at all but to remain alert. If your knees are locked, unlock them and loosen your stance. Control your breath, focus your mind, and continue the ritual:'2 SUBSTANTIAL CONTACT A large part of the modern evocation ritual attempts to ful­fill this single elementary principle of gaining and maintaining sub­stantial contact with the spirit to be materialized. Some occultists will meditate upon the sigil of the spirit to be called and will recite 91"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"incantations to bring it forth. Some Operators spend hours con­cocting various oils and incenses specific to the astrological attri­butions of the spirit. The practice of dressing wholly in the planetary colors of the spirit for days preceding the ritual is com­mon, as are daily devotions to the spirit, sphere, or godform asso­ciated with the spirit. Despite the most fervent assertions that these practices in their own right bring the spirit into materializa­tion, in actuality they only serve to create a substantial psychic con­tact between the Evocator and the evoked. The assertion made by Azazel and even more by Ant'har­ratu is that, in the very act of reading this text, of becoming aware of the evil spirits whose names are given in this text, and in the un­veiling to your mind the secrets of the Infernal Empire, its invisible hosts move nearer to you, the reader, the Seeker, and indeed these demons begin to make substantial contact with you. Their materi­alization in your ritual chamber and in your life is almost guaran­teed, as you will sense their presence and will soon be able to scan the following pages and call their names and they will rise in forms and bodies which you can behold. Sigils for the demons will be given in following chapters, which can be used to establish the vital link to the demon, along with its name. The Summoning Rite given later in this text, when perf ormed, will provide the necessary substantial contact to facili­tate the full materialization of the demon. INCANTATION Certain sounds that can only be made with the human vocal apparatus seem to put into motion immediate and substantial shifts in the environment, in the being of the Operator, and in existence as a whole. Unfortunately for adherents to the system of the tradi­tional grimoires in which the conjurations used to summon a spirit exhaust up to a half an hour, such transformative and transfigura­tive orations most often consist of only one or a few syllables, the 92"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"intonation and repetition of which alter the whole of existence in accordance with the inherent intent of the mantra. The License to Appear, the constraints, the bindings and the commands that are given to the spirit once it stands before you are primarily for the benefit of getting straight in your own mind that which you wish to achieve through such an Operation. The spirit that you have materialized into this reality does not speak English, or any other language, but ideas seem to muddle and mesh in the mind until they are spoken aloud or committed to writing. Even such a simple command as \"Rise before me, foul fiend of the inferno:' clarifies the otherwise ephemeral desire for the spirit to materialize. Rather than going on for thirty minutes in a memorized conjuration - or worse yet, reading one aloud from a book, pocket­sized flashlight in hand -I recommend utilizing the demonic tongue given in this text, which consists of only a few interesting and alienic words. Along with this, the Operator would do well to write a single sentence declaring that the spirit rise, the whole of which is to be repeated again and again, as the mind falls through rings of reality, the chant circling back on itself like the Ouroboros serpent, the frenzy and fanatic recitation driving the consciousness deeper than the flesh and the soil, into the crossroads between the worlds where Evocator and evoked may meet. COMMUNICATION If my concern here was for an impressive page-count, this single principle could fulfill that need, with thousands of exercises and hundreds of pages to guide the reader towards the full awak­ening of his or her spiritual faculties. Perhaps unfortunately, my goal instead is to deliver information in its purest form. The whole Operation of evocation, and all of the necessary fo rce and power exercised to facilitate the materialization of the spirit ought naturally to set the Evocator upon those Crossroads, 93"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"in the gap between the physical and the spiritual, between the world that was and the world that is being created, wherein the Operator · will witness the demon rising from the smoke of the incense or the steam of fresh blood, or from the vital effluvia of the earth and its microscopic inhabitants. If you have sufficiently given yourself over to the Operation, if you have abandoned all reason and have dived madly into the depths oflimitless possibility, the need to try to behold the demon will become abrogate. The form that the demon takes on when it rises is exactly that: a form that it takes on. We would be naive to imagine that in reality an entity existing beyond the physical world and before the fo rmation of the universes would possess legs and arms and a face much like ours, would stand upright, and would naturally commu­nicate vocally, and in English nonetheless! The body that the demon materializes is the body that we have materialized for it, that we have imposed upon it, based not on our expectations or any sort of conscious desire, but on a more atavistic, pantheonic remembrance. Whether Tung's archetypes and the underlying collective unconsciousness is to credit for these exact forms, or if there is some even more subtle transfer of information that is being engaged in, is really just semantics. The demon is given form by the ritual of evocation, and such a form is dictated by processes running as an undercurrent in the human consciousness. Although the word \"communication'' almost instantly makes us think of the more conscious and active type of commu­nication that we mortals use to convey ideas to one another involv­ing sounds that we make with our mouths, all of the senses are in fact involved in the process of communication. Wearing certain colors and clothing patterns, splashing cologne on our pulses, preparing certain foods and drinks, using appropriate and possibly suggestive physical touch, and adjusting the tone, tempo, and con­text of our words while on a date with the opposite sex is a very conscious attempt to communicate some very specific pieces of in-94"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"formation about ourselves, all without saying, \"I am a suitable sex-al \" u partner. Azazel materializing before me as an ebon satyr with taught muscles communicated a great deal to me abo ut him, and about his purpose on my path. Just as the woman across the table from me will smell the savory cologne, appreciate my stylish apparel and my personal grooming, will gasp at the dish that I've prepared fo r her, and will feel at ease with the tone of my voice, not often does the thought enter her mind with any conscious clarity, \"He would be a suitable sexual partner!\" The communication is taking place at a much more subtle level, into which language is inept to penetrate. Alas, we mere mortals do often need the obvious spelled out for us, and so eventually the demon will speak, answering our demands or imparting their guidance through words. These words will initially enter the mind as in a sort of telepathic, near-instan­taneous response. Although the \"voice in our heads\" will sound quite different from our usual internal monologue, and the words and their syntax will differ sometimes dramatically from our own, the primary impulse is to disregard the spirit's speech as an imagi­native phenomenon, and press the demon again to answer us. All of this is imaginative. We are using the imagination to bring into this four-dimensional reality an entity which, by all measurement, existed previously only within the imagination. Like the whole matter of evocation, though, the demon, its form, its voice, and its power is impotent and useless when trapped inside of the imagination, and so it must be released. A body must be cre­ated from virtual nothingness before us, and a voice must be made to echo independent of our expectations and internal imagination. That which was fantasy must be born into reality. The demon does not rise in a beholdable body by the fo rce of our wondering when it will rise, but instead a rift in assumed re­ality is made when, through the various stages of the Operation it­self, the materialization becomes an inevitability. Likewise, the demon's voice will not boom in our ears by dismissing the telepathic communications. Instead, by accepting the automatic oral projec­tions into our conscious minds, the ears will soon ache and seek to 95"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"shut out the thunderous voices of the dissonant choirs of the de­monic denizens. Only by giving yourself over to the Operation and to the Rapture completely will you attain Mastery over it. ISSUING A TASK Evocation of any spirit into physical materialization is in­deed the template of pure creation of something out of nothing. You must already be God to be able to perform such a task. Do not, therefore, attempt to approach the matter as a sniveling adolescent wondering, \"Will it work?\" Failure with a thousand faces will assail you. I am not concerned that you use your power wisely, or that you use your power for the good of this ideology or that presump­tion. I do insist, however, that you do use your power. Rend the veil between the worlds and build empires upon the earth, for money, sex, love, family, country, pride, altruism, or any other rea­son ... but do have a reason. Evocation is the template of creation, and if you evoke with the intention of nothing, then indeed nothing is what you will cre­ate. DISMISSAL All the while, throughout the preparation for the ritual of evocation and during it, you have not only been in the process of defining and creating the form and manifestation of the demon, but you have also been defining and creating a new reality, a new world more suitable to your specific needs. With a mighty exhalation, like Brahma let that new world flow out from you. \"Go now, and bring to pass that which I have commanded;' 96"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"is your declaration of the creation of your new world. With that single statement, let the demon go out into the void to lift up the firmament of your world, and likewise let your desires, your thoughts, and your attachments to your creation go.

PSYCHOLOGICAL RETRACTION Many occult systems would call this principle \"g rounding:' Immediately after giving the final command to depart, blow out the candles, smother the incense, and make yourself a sandwich. Do something that will remove your thoughts from the ritual, fr om the crossroads between the worlds, and will place you again in mundane \"reality;' allowing the collective observation of reality to merge with the new reality that you have just created, without the interfe rence of your continued thoughts, emotions and attachments to it! 97"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX THE GRIMOIRE OF LEGIONS Azazel commands two hundred legions of spirits. To pro­vide a comparison, the Goetia lists the demonic King Beleth as commanding eighty-five legions, Asmoday commanding seventy­two legions, and the mighty King Belial commanding eighty le­gions. Paimon is the only Demonic King who commands legions in the hundreds; he also is in command of two-hundred legions of infernal spirits. 1 Ancient philosophers assumed that all matter was com­posed of the five elements of fire, water, earth, air, and spirit, only to be later broken down into an elementary table of one hundred and seventeen elements, a number that rises with new discoveries of even more minute or rare, or even synthetic elements. Likewise, the grimoires detail demons such as Beleth, Belial, and Azazel as legionnaires in the Infernal Empire, detailing their attributes and powers, yet do not inspect more closely those who serve such Kings, as their powers produce the miraculous and their attributes are as unique as their superiors. Considering the \"inferior hierarchy\" beneath a demon, the imagery of imps and sylphs bounding around the throne of the De­monic Master far from prompts the Operator to put his trust in these lesser creatures. Why not go to the Dark Lords themselves?

The Summoned simply relays the in­formation to the descending hierarchy, and returns to the abyss until called once more. What is interesting about the legions under Azazel, how­ever, and what sets them apart from the aforementioned imps under the command of most grimoired demons, is that those who Azazel commands are not demonic at all, at least not in the tradi­tional sense of the word. Azazel is a unique sort of entity, a free agent roaming the Infernal Empire, a devil of the wilderness. The legions beneath him obey only him, and possess the same silent in­subordination to the plans of gods or hopeful tyrants. His legions are fill ed with demons far more impressive than Fates, Familiars, Nightmares, Black Angels, Watchers, Succubae, and Incubi. Azazel commands two-hundred legions. Each of my legions is commanded by a Nether. Yo u can call this a Dark Lord or a Demon Lord. They are more powerfu l than most any other demon you will ever encounter. Beneath the Nethers are nine Dukes, each with an army of 2,000. Knowing that these figures do not equate with the tradi­tional definition of a \"legion:' I prompted the Demon further. The term \"legion\" was used because the prophets who saw our numbers co uld in no other way describe them. If we assumed physical fo rm, and if we all stood up at once, we would blacken your sun with our numbers on this earth Yo u will command as many. Azazel revealed more concerning his legions, lifting me out of the Circle of Demonic Pacts and into the Infernal Empire, where I could see his armies gathered, lying in wait and standing at the gates, ready to pour into this world. 100"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Once I had done the math and had checked it thrice, arriv­ing at the conclusion that Azazel alone commands 3,600,000 demons, I sat in my office with books littering the floor, trying to make sense of the remainder of Azazel's dictation. Azazel's legions are divided into three groups, categorized by their general functions. Most occult disciplines would call these three groups, \"families:' I have preferred to refer to them as Houses. Azazel's First House is called Anatel. These are demonic warlords, those who go out into the world and cause change. These are the footsoldiers, the movers and shakers of the Infernal Empire. Azazel's Second House is called Retztael. These are the priests within the legions, the demonic sorcerers, those who rain the miraculous down from the heavens and up from the cracks of the abyss. Azazel's Third House is called Malkash. These are the in­formers, the gatherers and deliverers of information. They are Azazel's spies, the eyes in the shadows and the ears in the walls. Each Legion is composed of demons from each House, al­though there is no exact ratio. In my interactions, my evocations, my work with Azazel's legions, there are fewer Retztael demons than the other two Houses, but that those few are powerful beyond measure.

He seems to stand at least seven fe et tall. Upon his head sits a Corinthian helmet, hiding his entire face under the tarnished metal. In my evocations of Azazel and his legions, instead of setting out a Triangle of Manifestation, I would simply lay out the Circle of De­monic Pacts, facing towards the north, where my brazier fumed with incense that soon filled the room. The spirits would materi­alize wherever they chose, and For'tash always chose to appear on my right, in the east. For'tash has the power to overthrow your enemies, formed or unformed. He removes obstacles from your life, and even more remarkably, from yourself. All that is needed, while he stands be­side you, is to name your obstacles in writing, vivifying the words with the recognition of their impediment on your path, and with your intention to have them explanted. Once the words are written, meditate upon them, and envision your life without them. For'tash will feed your mind with a clear vision of this, and will aide in mag­nifying this imagination until it is brought to life and within your own self, the obstacle no longer exists. Finally, burn the paper with the obstacles written thereon, and, naming your obstacles aloud, ask that For'tash remove them from your path. 114"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE HOUSE OF RETZTAEL Eriesh'taetohl appears in the north as a figure covered in an azure cloak.

Sum­moning him, you may learn the truth about reincarnation, the pre­human existence of the Soul, and the spiritual destiny of human consciousness beyond the physical plane. This demonic Nether can instruct you in methods of ma­nipulation of your spiritual bodies which will allow not only for a consciously controlled reentrance into a physical body, but also fo r the dissolution and rematerialization of form over distances. 115"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Ant'harratu materializes fi rst as a vapor or a thin smoke filling the northwestern part of the Temple. After spiraling about for several moments as if surveying the Temple for danger or trick­ery, his form materializes as a figure cloaked and hooded in black. Often, the Gateway of Pacts is emblazoned on the chest of his robe, or on the part of his hood covering his forehead, not embroidered into the astral material, but burning like a psychic brand. Ant'harratu is possibly the most powerful of all the Nethers. He is a maker of miracles. He claims to have taught sorcery to the priests of Babylon, Egypt, and Olmec. It was by Ant'harratu's invisible hand that many of the miraculous alterations in my own life and circumstances were brought about. Once called on to fulfill a task, Ant'harratu is relentless, even at the dismay of the Evocator. He begins working on the goal immediately, and foresees the best route to achieve the most com­plete satisfaction of the desire. As I experienced, he will often find it necessary to remove obstacles fr om your path, which can cause momentary anxiety in the Operator, as it seems a reversal of the original command. However, bearing with the changes unto the conclusion will result in a much more fruitful end than any human mind could organize. 116"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Eshtalishtu manifests as a beautiful, slender, nude man, his body and head absent of any hair at all. A peculiar radiance beams from within him, making his skin appear to glow with a faint blue energetic light. Eshtalishtu holds the knowledge and the power of transmu­tation. When evoked, he is quick to explain that the assertion of modern \"alchemists\" that \"True Alchemy is the transmutation of impure human elements into that which is divine\" is entirely false, and indeed is quite the opposite of reality. According to Eshtalishtu, the greatest alchemy is the transmutation of the Divine Particle into matter. This understanding furthers the idea presented to me throughout this entire ninety-day Operation that this physical realm is not the impure and outcast plane of existence, but that it is the final condensation of an intentional spiritual will. Eshtalishtu can teach you, when evoked, some very elemen­tary rituals which can be used for the most miraculous ends, even fo r the materialization of objects of matter seemingly from noth­ing. 117"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Mehmion materializes in the southeast, behind the Evoca­tor's right shoulder as he faces north.

A much better route is to bring a list of questions into the evocation, where she can instruct you on the alterations that you need to make to bring your life to the position that you desire, thus putting all of the control into your hands, and teaching you most of all that you alone hold the power to your destiny. 120"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Khro'syas is a Demonic Priest Lord of the dead.

The demon's form will fade and in his place the form of the requested will rise, appearing and speak­ing as the person in life would, and retaining all of the knowledge possessed in life. The risen dead cannot speak of the afterlife, however, as they do no remember dying at all, but are projections of that indi­vidual in life.

In a great deal of Alak'than's teachings, the recurrence of the theme of spiritual antitransmigration is prevalent, as I first ap­proached the demon interrogating him on how I could translate the flesh, and instead learned that the flesh is the gloried position, that this physical world is the untested landscape, and that we are the gardeners of our own destiny.

I imagine that the subcon­scious desires of the Evocator are accessed in order to create an al­luring image to manifest in, though, and would therefore change with each Evocator. Fro'ghla'tasch is capable of fulfilling every sexual, intimate, or emotional need, calling into the life of the Evocator a lover, spouse, a friend, or any person that is able to help fulfill the specific needs of the Evocator, whether such a person already exists in his or her life and is unresponsive, or if that person is called out of a crowd of strangers from great distances to the Summoner's doorstep. 123"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Krehl'a'teral is the master of miracles.

Despite his appearance, this Nether's voice is quite soft and comforting. Mak'ta'lahn is a master of mechanics. At face-value, this implies that he is able to fix that which is broken, weather made of metal or of flesh. The greater understanding of his ability, however, is in his knowledge of universal and even dimensional mechanics. Although Mak'ta'lahn is not an expert communicator, often rattling off explanations of processes that no human mind has even considered, nor have we developed the vocabulary to understand, when pressed fo r information on any particular issue, he is able to direct you in very simple and often mundane actions which will cause a considerable shift in your reality through mechanical causality. 128"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ta h'ka'yat is a demonic lord whose ethereal mind seems to be planted in a point outside of time altogether, as he is capable of looking into the past and the future with the same ease as the pres­ent.

Throughout a single evocation, I have wit­nessed this shifting occurrence up to twenty-one times. Ya sh'alten holds precise knowledge of every galaxy, star, and planet in the universe, and can provide detailed information con­cerning those planets which do indeed bear life similar to our own. In speaking with him on these, however, it is clear that he refuses to use our modern classifications and names fo r the various celestial bodies, either relying on terms from ancient astronomy, or calling them by names never before heard on earth.

Alas, their names and their signs have been given, and the formula by which they may be summoned and the tokens by which they will obey have been revealed. The rite of summoning, however, is not the end destination fo r the Godly Incarnate, but its successful com­pletion marks the true beginning of the path of Becoming. The neophyte's initial experiments in the occult are usually aimed at simple goals: sex, money, popularity, scholastic or voca­tional success. Like a child who can plainly see that the emperor has no clothes, the neophyte recognizes that the power of the occult lies in its potency to affect the physical world through wholly non­physical means. As we chase our phantoms down the rabbit hole, however, the mystery itself and the kaleidoscopic visions that it produces be­fo re us cause our entire fo cus to shift. The magician becomes a mystic, and the alteration of this reality becomes secondary; the chase through the cosmos and beyond the manifold planes of exis­tence becomes primary. The method supersedes the task to which the method should be applied.

With our first taste of real power, of our ability to rearrange the most minute and the most grand circumstances in our lives, the phantom chase begins, as we try to work out the hows and the whys of the thing. Astral projection, mirror scrying, Soul Travel, vision quests, all lead us along a path of self-discovery. Through simple and mainly imaginative methods, our con­sciousness is quite easily transferred fr om the physical body and brain into the more subtle bodies, the mind itself needing no host but capable of existing incorporeal. The physical realm is tran­scended, into the astral worlds of spirits, angels, devils, and gods. Further we fly beyond the simple spirit, beyond the fo rmed energy, into realms where consciousness itself fo rms the architecture and landscape. Even beyond this we travel, through ten thousand abysses and an outer sea of darkness, to where even consciousness must fa il and abandon the quest, and that Eternal part of ourselves, that omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent part of ourselves - that part of us which is indeed God - is loosed fr om its fe tters and both expands and collapses infinitely, becoming All and Nothing at once. Upon our return to our naked, shivering, sweating bodies, we begin to understand who or what we are.

Witnessing this again and again, I was shocked, as it seemed clear to me that those who possess the keys to spiritual power would be able to heal and strengthen th eir bodies, and the same zest put towards their spiritual maintenance through medi­tation and ritual would concomitantly and quite unconsciously be applied to their physical well being. As I summoned Azazel and as he materialized before me, the general directions and advice that he offered morphed into very specific instructions, dictating even the most tedious details of my life. Among these instructions, he nearly shouted, \"Make your­self strong.\" Before my mind was allowed to interpret his statement, I knew within myself that he was not referring to mental strength or emotional solidity, but instead to physical strength.

Due to extreme neglect and abuse in the first fe w years of my life -the years in which my body and phys­ical coordination would develop -I was incapable of performing many physical tasks which other children seemed to take fo r granted, but which I had to practice and push myself to achieve. As a fo ur-year-old adopted into a concerned family, it was apparent that I wasn't able to interact with objects on the left side of my body using my right limbs, and vice versa. I couldn't spin myself around off of a small ladder in order to sit up on the top bunk bed. I couldn't walk a straight line, one fo ot in fr ont of the other, and when stretching with all of my might, I could barely touch my fingertips to the middle of my shins. Through rehabilitative training, I learned to cross midline, although I remained quite uncoordinated. I could walk a straight line, but doing so required every bit of my fo cus, to the point that I would constantly run into things in my path, as my eyes and my mind were solely on my straight line of travel. I increased my flex­ibility, but I never could touch my fi ngers to my toes. Yoga presented fa r too many challenges, more to my ego than to my physique. Tied in with the recognition of my physiological shortcom-144"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"ings were my even more crippling psychological and emotional is­sues. My adoptive family had been quick to help correct the obvi­ous and possibly embarrassing issues that I had managing my body, but their answer to my being able to manage the intense emotions and mental states stemming fr om those fi rst fe w horrific years of life was to fo rget about it, to appreciate the change in my situation, and to turn my fo cus towards the Church. Such was a threefold recipe fo r repression, fo r a good many years of bubbling and boiling fr ustration, and fo r an explosion that would inevitably come. As a teenager, the repressive walls within my mind started to crumble, running concomitant with my dive into the world of the occult. All of the shapes and colors and vivid horrors pressed into the fo reground of my mind, the smell of my own fe ces sicken­ing me as I laid in my empty playpen, starving, the sound of shout­ing and the explosion of gunpowder, and children begging. I had been instructed upon my adoption, and then threat­ened and punished, time and again, to not discuss with anyone my life previous to my adoption, and so \"talking out\" the psychic mael­strom as it assaulted me in my teens was not an option. I ran a sharp blade across my upper arm, slowly, decisively, pressing harder and harder, fe eling each layer of skin parting, giving way to the metal until streams of blood ran down my arm. Self abuse soon was not enough to sedate the shame, fe ar, and the rage, and so I projected outwards, vilifying the whole of the human race fo r the sins that only a fe w had committed against me and other children. Hatred and sadism compelled me. Even after my marriage and the birth of my daughter - an event that set my life on a much more productive course - I still could not shake my deep rage. Anger was a mask, though, as it almost always is, and un­derneath that mask was a fa ce of loneliness. My adoptive parents were warned that it would be difficult fo r me to fo rm close rela­tionships and true intimacy with other people. I would hold the whole world at arms length or further, as a way to keep myself safe from the atrocities that humans seem to be most apt to inflict on those who are close to them. 145"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"And so, I fo und myself married, yet incapable of really melt­ing into my spouse. I could make love, I could hug and kiss, but a part of me shut down inside, went away ... held back fr om fe eling too much, too deeply. I somehow connected confronting the physiological flaws caused by my early life with the more disastrous psychological and emotional flaws that seemed to comprise who I was as a person. If I fixed my body, the rest might fo llow. I was not far off from the truth. Yoga would become quite the challenge for me. After only a fe w sessions of my sister's Power Yoga class, I realized that she was teaching the postures well, but that a good deal of the actual discipline was missing. With less than a little re­search, I fo und that Power Yoga is a modern, \"washed down\" de­rivative of Ashtanga Yoga, and so my attention turned towards the more original source. I picked up a fe w books on Ashtanga Yoga, watched a fe w videos of the various postures and, more importantly, the vinyasa, or the movement between each asana and the corre­lating breathing and fo cus. Passing by the freeweights and pully machines decorating the main floor of the gym, I ascended the concrete staircase to the second floor, which housed the various \"classrooms\" and treadmills, and I snuck into the Yoga Room in between sessions. Many of the asanas required flexibility that I simply did not possess, and the only way that I could find to fo ld myself in half in either direction was to fo rce my body as dose into the posture as possible, by wrapping a belt across the soles of my fe et, and pulling. My tendons burned and my muscles tore, but day-by-day I needed the assistance of the leather belt less and less. As my muscle mass naturally deceased as well, I could fit more easily into the various postures. Something within me changed - \"snapped\" is the only word that fits - in the moment that I was no longer struggling to attain the correct position, but the whole movement from as ana to vinyasa to asana became a type of dance. My inner state in that moment came to absolute calm. I remember dropping to my knees and out of nowhere sobbing. I remember laughing in the next moment, 146"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"and then sighing as if all in the world had suddenly been made right. Something had changed within my psyche and my emo­tions, a strange sort of serenity, an acceptance of my past and my present and a contentment with the motion of things into the fu ­ture. I had sat in twelve-step meetings fo r various addictions, and on psychologists' couches, and in spiritual mentors' temples, and in ritual mandalas in hopes to achieve that single seemingly unat­tainable moment, a moment that fe ll on me and crushed me, not because of something I was doing with my mind or my fo cus or my emotional state, but by something I was doing with my body and with my breath alone. My daily life became from that moment not a struggle fo r more, but a graceful receiving of all the gifts that were constantly poured upon me. And I began to expect all aspects of my life and my environment to match up to the peace and the love that I fe lt within. All that was unable or unwilling to meet this expectation was quite organically removed fr om my path ... even my most inti­mate relationship. My wife and I had become locked in the dance of disconnectedness, and neither of us really knew how to dance in the first place. The origin of our meeting was in chaos and various degrees of despair, so as my despair diminished and her need dis­solved, so did our marriage. Something also changed within my invisible self and my in­visible environment. Rather than scribbling sigils of spirits to call and chanting incantations in some alienic tongue, I fo und that bringing my mind to peace- the same peace that was then fo llow­ing me wherever I went - and releasing from my lips a grateful and an accepting and an ecstatic \"A hhhh;' that which I desired was pulled to me almost instantly. My whole life shifted, the stars falling from their fixed positions, replaced by new stars in a new align­ment. My Destiny had been rewritten, it seemed. Ye t the demon stood before me, not long after discovering my secret serenity. He stood before me no less than twelve fe et tall. His skin was black as if fo rmed from congealed oil, and it seemed ready to tear fr om the strain of the muscles bulging underneath. 147"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Make yourself strong. Yo u are a being of power, of strength. That which exists in the fo rmed invisibility is to be made flesh. Solidify and strengthen your own Te mple, and your empire will rise around you. I had spent three years of my discipline in Ashtanga Yoga, the first year of which I spent wishing that I could give up on the practice and hit the weights with the men rather than dancing around on a mat in a mirrored room. For three years, I hadn't touched a weight. Ashtanga Yoga had provided more of a physical challenge than weights ever had. Azazel's command terrified me in a similar way that the prospect of taking up yoga had terrified me. I was not afraid of confronting myself this time, however, but instead was terrified of reverting. I had made so much progress, physically, psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually, and I simply could not afford to regress. But I had contracted with the Demon. I had made a covenant to submit myself to Him; to turn my spiritual and tem­poral welfare into His hands, and to obey His commands and fo llow His directions, in that He would lead me into Power and Glory. And I meant it. If Azazel meant to drag me to hell, then I was ready to leap into the inferno, fo r the simple hope of incinerating my remaining stumbling blocks and rising unfettered beyond the Throne of God. If I was going to lift weights again, I was going to do it right. The only direction that I received fo r my t1rst fe w years of weight training was from my friend, Jack, who told me that I should never spend more than thirty minutes in the gym per day, and that if I was able to lift the weight more than six times in one set, then I need to add more weight to the stack. Like most men, I wanted manly, muscled biceps and a chis­eled chest. On odd days I would curl weights to build my biceps, and on even days I would bench press and push-up and dumbbell­fly my way to a strong chest. When my shoulder was x-rayed due to a sharp pinch that 148"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"wouldn't go away on its own after my little Japanese car wast-boned at an intersection, along with an impact-related impingement, the surgeon noted that my shoulders were already in a deteriorated state. Looking at my body, and at my injuries, he asked if I lifted weights. I affirmed that I did, and he warned that the constant, repetitive exercises, not balanced by a full-body routine, were caus­ing me more harm than good. In rehabilitative physical therapy, my therapist designed a program of muscle rehabilitation which strictly required that I not use my pectoralis muscle groups or my biceps. He took note of my posture and my muscle development, and said that while I had im­pressive strength in my arms and my chest, that I needed to balance that with strength in my legs, my back, and my shoulders. All of this should have been obvious, but the success that I had seen in taking my biceps from ten or eleven inches around to sixteen or seventeen inches was quite a distraction from the obvi­ous. After three years of Ashtanga Yo ga and quite a bit of per­sonal development and healing on all levels of my being, I was in­tent to not repeat the same mistakes, which indeed were compensatory. I read all that I could about weight training, and I designed a fo ur to five day, full-body routine. Knowing that I had designed my own harmful routine years earlier, I wanted to run my simple program by someone who could advise me further. Robert Angelo Dalla Valle has been a good fr iend of mine fo r at least a fe w years. Along with possessing a remarkable ability to naturally manipulate the physical world through purely internal, spiritual methods, he has also created for himself the body of a Greek God. He had studied and applied the science of body build­ing to perfection, from resistance training to weight loss, peak nu­trition, and most importantly, the fo cus of spiritual power into the physical being. When I showed him my workout routine, I ex­pected him to say something like, \"Yeah, just hit the weights hard:' or, \"You might want to throw some cardio into the mix:' Instead, Robert threw science at me, mathematical fo rmulas 149"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"to increase the effectiveness of my routine fo r my age, body type, and weight. And then, once my routine was polished, he also gave me secret -something that I had entirely missed before: \"You have to put your fo cus, your intention, your energy and your Will into your muscles. All hormones are literal living entities just as daemonic or angelic entities, and they must not be ignored because of sheer ego alone. They're even clinically defined as chemical messengers, so I ask you, what fo ol would ignore the messenger, when the messages relate to their very own health and life?\" It seemed that something far beyond the simple building of my muscles and strengthening of my body was taking place. For the first fe w weeks of my return to weight training, my muscles, and even more, my ligaments ached. My body fa ced quite a task of readapting to the stress. My ego also had some adjustment to do, as I realized that I couldn't curl eighty-five pound weights in each hand anymore, and that I couldn't dumbbell press two-hun­dred and twenty pound weights. As Robert had predicted, though, muscle memory quickly activated. My biceps grew back to their previous size, my chest bulged and rounded, along with the new development of increased leg muscle development, and stronger back muscles, balancing my body, thrusting my shoulders back, increasing not only my vanity muscles, but my whole body's strength and power. I had set the intention of the routine, as well, not to gain muscle, but to be strong, fit, and healthy. Rather than gaining weight as I usually did when I put on muscle, I started noticing that I was losing weight while gaining muscle. Robert's mathematical fo rmulas seemed to be working, seemingly miraculously. I had pre­pared myself to see a massive gain in body weight, bringing me fr om my steady two-hundred and fifteen pounds to two-twenty­five and higher. Instead, fo ur months after my muscles had adapted to the routine, I started to lose fat while gaining muscle, bringing my weight down to one-hundred and ninety-five pounds. I was leaner, healthier, and without a doubt stronger. Another level of strength began to peak as well. In the 150"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"height of my yogic discipline, kundalini flowed effortlessly through my body, all blockages having dissolved, all restraints being loosed. If I stretched out my hand to cause a change, power would flow through it and into the world. I was in energetic harmony with ex­istence. As my muscles grew and my body strengthened, it seemed that something unique was occurring within the kundalini flow it­self, as if my muscles themselves were pumping kundalini through my system rather than just letting it flow. I could fe el myself be­coming literally a more powerful spiritual machine. Make yourself strong. You don't have to be a body builder. I'm not aiming to compete on stage, my muscle- stretched skin rubbed with oil. But as my body becomes stronger, so does my mind, my emotions, and my spiritual abilities. All of these are bound together, and the intelligent spirits living within our bodies, being pushed into our bloodstream through the endocrine system are multiplied by the continual strengthening of the body. And the doubt arises: sure, this is fine and good fo r a healthy, athletic male of only three decades in age. What of those with hormonal imbalances, genetic dispositions, deteriorated bones, or other very real and very physical impediments to the strengthening of the body? If you are able to reach into the world with invisible hands and to strangle the life of your enemies, or to raise from deathbeds the dying into perfect health, as you surely are, and as I surely have, then you possess all of the tools to destroy the internal enemies to your health, and to resuscitate and revitalize every aspect of your physical being. One does not need to rise fr om his wheelchair and run a marathon, or to drag a seventy year old body into the weight room and lift the same weights as I do. But, make yourself strong, in whatever capacity you are able, to whatever degree is necessary to achieve a peak psychological, emotional, spiritual, and physical state. In yoga, I learned that the pineal gland can often become physically encrusted due to a lifetime of inactivity, and that through raising kundalini and causing nearly imperceptible vibrations in 151"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the pineal gland, the encrustations break loose. Once the pineal gland is freed, the rush of chemicals and more subtle fo rces through it creates an ecstasy beyond that which any artificial drug can du­plicate. And the pineal gland is merely one of many glands within the endocrine system. Consciously and intentionally activating these restores not only our bodies to their original fu nctioning ca­pacities, but triggers even deeper fa culties with us. Most people in modern, western society concede to the re­ality of a \"mind-body connection:' in that thoughts, attitudes, in­tentions, and perceptions greatly influence the well-being of the physical body. The polarity runs in both directions, however - a fa ct that is often overlooked. The health, strength, solidity, flexi­bility, and stamina of the physical body greatly influences the inner aspects of the human being. Physical well-being translates into mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Physical balance and flexibility translates into mental, emotional, and spiritual balance and flexibility. And physical power translates into mental, emo­tional, and definitely spiritual power. We are no longer simple mammals living in harmony and symbiosis with this biological sphere on which we were born, but we have taken dominion of the earth , and now beyond. We have been neglectful of the needs of the body, as well as the needs of the earth which fe eds and houses us, but with the applied fo rce of our godlike power, we could restore our bodies, and we could transcend the need to pillage to extinction the earth's resources fo r our simple survival. If we were content to live as other mammals live, a simple balance with nature would suffice. But since we are intent to master the atom and play with the electron, to dominate matter and anti­matter, to dissect quarks and quasars, to become not only an inter­stellar but interdimensional species, more is required of us than allowing our power to flow as it naturally does.

Nearly six years prior to authoring this present text, I stood in a bookstore in Salt Lake City, Utah, waiting fo r the crowd to ar­rive. I had rented metal fo ld-out chairs fr om a party supply store, and had at least fifty of them set up in neat, curving rows. To my left, as I fa ced the empty chairs, I had set a plastic card table up with copies of my fi rst two books, Kingdoms of Flame and Works of Darkness. A tripod stood at my right, holding a giant flipchart. On the first page I had written, \"Occult Principles Applied;' in fa t, black letters dominating the page. This was the very first public appear­ance I would make as E.A. Koetting, occult author. Shawn took a seat several minutes before I was scheduled to begin. Friends who had come to support me, and a fe w others who were genuinely interested in what I would be presenting scat­tered in purposeful randomness among the seats. A man with nar­row shoulders and a squinting distrust of even the shadows in the ro om took a seat -the seat closest to the exit. After minutes of shuffling in his chair and adjusting his long coat under him, he squinted even harder, his unsure glare magnified by his thick glasses, and read the flipchart. Without taking his eyes off of it, as if the words would disappear like phantom instructions in a black­backed mirror, his hands reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small notebook, upon which was clipped a half-sized pencil, the sort of pencil available in public libraries fo r jotting down Li­brary of Congress reference numbers on cut up pieces of scrap paper. He jotted the words in his notebook, the completion of the 153"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"task allowing him to look again at those mischievous shadows and the bustling shoppers and all of the other dangers possible in a place such as a bookstore. This man's notes appeared the following morning in a local newspaper. The seminar was a footnote of local goings-on. The only letters that I noticed him scribble in his notebook the entire evening were those three words, \"Occult Principles Applied:' Those, along with my name, were the only details given in the newspaper the following day. I introduced myself, as a presenter is supposed to do unless you're Deepak Chopra or Tony Robbins. I explained that I would be discussing not only the occult, but how the occult, how magick and ritual and spirituality can be put into practical use, not only in my life, but in the lives of each and every person in the audience. A few people sat fo rward in their seats, and some even took out pens and notebooks. I felt good about where my first seminar was heading. Turning the pages of the flipchart, where I had large illus­trations of sigils, ritual circles, and even a candle-color-meanings chart, I explained the various types of ritual that can be employed in effecting change in the physical world through nonphysical means. The crowd was still with me. A few were taking careful notes, and one girl even asked me to hold off on turning the page, so she could copy the information on it. I'm sure that I glowed as I gave her a few extra seconds. Then, I made the whole thing personal. Too personal. One of the last pages on my flipchart showed the over-utilized Pyramid of Needs, otherwise known as \"Maslow's Hierarchy:' Motioning to the lowest, base of the large, sectioned triangle drawn on the page, I explained that the most basic, primitive needs need to be met first, which are those needs of self-preservation and biological function. Food, water, shelter, breathing, defecating, sleeping, and sexual release are some of these most basic needs. Once the base needs have been satisfied, the individual will begin to work on the second step of the pyramid, which is ensuring 154"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the security and continuation of the resources needed to fu lfill those needs beyond the immediate present. In human society, this often translates into steady employment, farming or agriculture, se­curing a long-term residence, and joining with the gender of pref­erence fo r continued sexual activity. Pointing to the third section on the triangle, I explained that, once the base needs have been met and have been secured, the individual can begin to move beyond the basic needs of a bipedal mammal, fo rming meaningful relationships with fr iends and fa m­ily, and graduating beyond simple sexual fu lfillment with the gen­der of choice into emotional fulfillment and long-term commitment. The fo urth level being that of self-esteem and achievement, simply maintaining employment may no longer be enough to sat­isfy the individual; instead, he or she strives to excel in their capac­ities, to rise into management positions, or to branch into other avenues of employment or self-employment which will more align with their personal interests and motivations. He or she will strive to strengthen bonds with family, friends, and spouse. Belonging to a community and being active in the welfare of that community be­comes important at this stage as well. Basically, all of the previously fu lfilled needs become amplified, more personalized, and more meaningful. Finally, the individual enters the realm of self-actualization. Artistic endeavors become fr uitful; the value of making money is replaced or supplemented by a need to give back to society and the world at large; and as a whole, the fullness of human potentiality is explored. Embracing the self-actualization process with enough depth often leads to some sort of spiritual purpose, which, taken to the extreme, leads men to strive to become like unto God: limitless. \"You're trying to attain self-actualization, even Christ Con­sciousness and God-realization, but you need to take an honest look at where you're at in your own life;' I bellowed from the soapbox that seemed to be crumpling under the weight of my own fe rvor. '�re you really free and able to explore the deepest meaning of your 155"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"life and to discover your true purpose on earth when you're living in your mother's basement ... and even she wants to kick you out?\" One of my friends cast his eyes to the ground. He was living in his mother's basement, and she indeed did want to throw him out into the streets. \"If you have to worry about food and shelter, or if you've had nothing but horrible, abusive and manipulative relationships, or if you're not sure how you're going to pay the electricity bill, or if you don't feel like your life is moving in any direction at all, how can you experience any real, substantial liberation other than hope­ful escapism?\" The note-takers stopped taking notes. The previously nod­ding heads were replaced by eyes shifting around, possibly looking for the coveted exit dominated by the journalist. And then I spat salt onto the wounded, by flipping back­wards through the pages of my display, back through the various methods of ritual, back through the candle colors and the spirit sig­Hs. \"You naturally, innately possess all of the power that you'll ever need to change every single aspect of your life, exactly as you<:l like it to be. And you have the knowledge of how to use that power available to you, here;' I pointed at my table of books, \"and here:' pointing at my flipchart. \"So, let's use that power:' I had drawn beforehand several \"Magic Squares;' designed to attract money to the bearer. I passed them out to the members of the audience. Most put the pieces of paper in their laps politely. The journalist squinted at it, and then shoved it in his pocket. I could count on one hand those who held the paper in front of them, waiting for instructions on how to acti­vate the magic. \"Hold the square on your lap; you want to have it far enough away from your eyes that you can see the whole image in one glance. Relax your eyes as you look at it. Rather than focusing your mind on the image, instead think about your breath. You don't have to count your inhalation and exhalations or anything. Just pay at­tention to your breath flowing in and out of your body. Let your 156"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"mind get completely carried away by the rhythm of your breathing, while keeping your gaze on the square. You may fe el yourself get­ting a bit dizzy, a bit lightheaded. This is what I call the rapture as you descend into the Theta-Gamma sync. It will almost feel as if you're getting too much oxygen ... but you aren't. Your mind and your body are adapting to your ability to sense and connect with more subtle dimensions, and to project information into those di­mensions. \"Now, gently, without pulling yourself out of the rapture, bring to mind an image of you possessing the money that you need or want. See it in your wallet, in your hand, or see a bank statement showing the amount that you'd like to receive. Hold that image as a still picture in your mind, and notice a certain pressure building in your Ajna chakra, in your forehead, as you do this. Through your gaze, this pressure is slowly released, as if your line of sight to the square is transferring the power and the will into the square it­self. ''At this point, many people will visibly see the lines of the square or the sigil disappearing from sight, and then reappearing, hovering off the surface of the paper. The square will also seem to possess a unique invisible glow. \"When you've reached this point, take a deep breath in, and then exhale quickly, bringing you out of the theta brainwave state. You can fold up the paper and put it away. \"That brings this presentation to a close. Go about the rest of your evening doing whatever it is you would naturally do, and try to distract your mind from the ritual that you just performed, and from your need or desire for money. You will find that as soon as you've forgotten all about it, the money will be delivered to you:' I had offended almost everyone in the room. Not only had I told them in clear words that, unless they applied themselves to the betterment of their immediate environment and the enrichment of their lives, that their quest for self-actualization was futile; and not only did I make it known that I expect those who hold the power to make these changes to take responsibility for every part of their lives; but I also expected them to do it, now! 157"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"I didn't sell a single book that day. I was contacted by every single person who joined me in magickally opening their square, within days, reporting that they had received the money that they needed, quite unexpectedly, but that they weren't sure if they'd do another \"ritual\" like that again. Heaven fo rbid that we take away all reason to complain about our circumstances rather than doing something about them. Using Maslow's Hierarchy as the baseline fo r the fulfillment of needs and the rise into Self Actualization was more out of ease of definition than out of its efficacy to define each individual's needs, desires, and personal fulfillment. The needs of an individual having spent all of their lives in a shack in a southern bayou will be much different than someone having lived in the wealthier parts of Manhattan or Paris. Those living in what we would consider squalor in India will have a much different level of need and fulfill­ment than someone on a beach house in California. The whole process of defining needs, desires, and fulfillment, then, requires a more personal approach. I personally resonate with Maslow's Hierarchy, as it has seemed to parallel my own experience with fulfillment and success. Therefore, below I will go through the levels of the pyramid below as they pertain to me, and I encourage all who seek power and lib­eration to do the same. It is impossible to achieve anything unless you have clearly defined what you need and want. My basic needs are met when I am able to eat at least twice a day, when I have dean water to drink, when I have a home to stay in and a place to sleep. When my concern and fo cus is funneled towards gaining or maintaining these most basic needs, sexual release isn't a prime concern of mine. At those periods in my life when I've fo und myself homeless, which has indeed occurred a couple of times, mainly due to slip­ping more into the other side of the veil than this one, such was never an extended enough of a period to see if sexual needs would resurface as a priority while in a state of desti­tution, although I'm certain that if I had allowed myself to 158"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"settle into my situation, my sexuality would adjust itself to that situation. I gain a sense of security by having a steady job that pays enough to maintain an apartment, to pay for electricity, to buy groceries, and to maintain a vehicle for transportation to my employment, thereby ensuring the continuation of such employment and therefore ensuring the continuation of my security. My early childhood taught me that I could not rely on others to provide for my needs, so living with family or friends and relying on their support thr ough dif­ficult times does not provide this sense of security for me, although I recognize that it does for others. Ifl am not per­sonally maintaining the stability in my life, then I am acutely aware that it may disappear at any moment. It is at this level of fulfillment, having gained a sense of security, that sexuality becomes important to me, and I will seek out sexual partners. The third and fourth tiers of Maslow's Hierarchy seem quite intertwined for me. I'm not an extremely social person, in that I don't need to have constant contact with friends and relatives, nor do I feel the need to get out and be in a group of people in order to feel happy. However, immediatel y after securing all of my basic needs, I begin to seek the advance­ment of all aspects of my life. Money isn't a great motivator in my life, neither is social status, so I'm content in a small apartment so long as it is clean and comfortable for my daughter and myself. I don't care about having the newest car, so long as the one I drive is reliable and efficient. I care more about the internal rewards of my work, so long as the financial rewards are enough to support myself. In nearly every job I've had in my adult life, I've risen very quickly into management positions, and have excelled into com­pany leadership or at least direct consultation with the com­pany leadership. Simply working a job, getting a paycheck, 159"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"and going to work the next day is not satisfying enough for me. I need to feel as if I'm pushing myself, learning and growing. I'll be more prone to making friends, and more receptive to social gatherings once I feel that my base needs have been secured. I'll also feel much more comfortable having the same sexual partner, and even being exclusive with that partner, at this phase of fulfillment. Self Actualization comes quickly for me, as I tend to move through the stages of fulfillment quickly. As I mentioned above, I have before experienced homelessness in my life, due to getting \"too far out there;' too disconnected with this world and its requirements on me. Those periods didn't last long, and within months at most I fo und that I had met my base needs, had secured them, and had already moved into fulfilling my need for excellence in employment and other avenues of my life. I then quickly begin to create. I cannot, absolutely cannot write a book, a short story, or an article while I am struggling through the first three phases of my personal fulfillment. I can write poetry, and that sort of \"woe is me\" poetry is absolutely righteous. All of my other facets of creation are dry until I have fulfilled the needs and desires given above. Once those needs and desires have been fulfilled, though, I experience an artistic explosion. I can't keep the words and sentences and paragraphs from flowing through me, often scribbling notes on napkins or paper receipts through the day.

Then, Shawn and I divorced. There was something magical about that period in my life. Not only had my marriage fallen apart, but my employer had filed bankruptcy and had closed their doors in that same month, owing me thousands of dollars in pay that I would never receive, and I was transitioning between publishers, so I no longer had royalties being paid to me to ease the fall. I moved in to a friend's spare bedroom and went through my savings at a beastly speed as I tried to support myself with no income, as well as pay Shawn's bills while she stabilized her life, as well as pay the legal costs of the divorce. Within a month, however, I had gained employment with another firm for less of a salary than I was used to, but it was income nonetheless; I had established my own publishing house which, at least fo r the time being, was bringing me in more residual income than befo re; and I was in my own apartment, furnished the way that I wanted, with new pots and pans, new dishes, and a refrigerator filled with good fo od. Within two months I was again able to sit down and finish my work on writing, completing the manuscript fo r my sixth book, Questing After Visions. None of this came because I have better connections than others, because I'm drinking buddies with a rabbi in the publishing business, or that I know the right handshakes.

THE VESSLE OF THE AEON \"Most power, once attained, becomes a curiously empty experience:'2 Through the course of nearly twenty years studying the oc­cult in earnest, of fi fteen years engaging in the esoteric rites and methods, and of ten years teaching hundreds personally and count­less more through my writing, I've made a peculiar observation, which seems to have crept through unnoticed by the majority of spiritual scholars: diminishing returns when applying the same or similar methods to the same or similar tasks over any amount of time - or, more accurately, with enough repetition, as I've also no­ticed that many who consider themselves \"occultists;' or worse yet, \"pagans:' rarely apply the occult sciences and practical spirituality to any real goal which might produce any observable and verifiable result. Around fifteen years old, having pored through books and letters and essays dealing with the occult, with magick, with witch­craft since I was twelve, I finally sat down with a tapered, white can­dle, and as I lit the wick I could just fe el that I was entering some mysterious, fo rbidden, erotic realm. As I called out to the elements of fire, water, earth and air, and spun clockwise to call the watch­towers of the cardinal points, the rapture had already taken me. Through such simple methods I worked the miraculous. The only thing that was more exciting than the ritual itself was the end result: real, tangible, usable power. By lighting a simple colored 162"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"candle and \"chanting\" a silly limerick, I was able to make others be­have quite opposite of their natural patterns; I was able to make even the most \"out of my league\" girls give me the time of day; I summoned money; favors; decent grades entirely undeserved. There seemed no bounds to the power that I had in my hands, by lighting the wick of a simple candle and pronouncing a silly limer­ick. Before long, however, my soul's stomach started growling, and the starvation for power that had originally driven me into the arms of the Mysteries was again surfacing. I had learned which candle colors worked best fo r which results, and had dissected the various elemental attributes fo r diffe rent goals. I had put into action at least a hundred alterations in reality through this first fo rm of ritual, and the excitement of its performance was fading fa st. As the veil was pulled back and the last twinkling particles of mystery fell from it, Eros was seen flaccid and wanting fo r more. I moved into sympathetic magick, intense psychodramatic ceremony, sigil work, mudras and mantras, invocation and evocation, finding my­self propelled upwards, further upwards, until the throne of God was a spot of light beneath me. Once the paranormal becomes the normal, our interactions with the realm of limitless possibility diminishes, not because the method suddenly and spontaneously becomes any less effective, but because the trigger, which is the self, is no longer primed, no longer excited by the ritual, no longer turned on by the whole thing. I've always been advised by my best mentors to not get stuck in the method. But, like ignorance, it seems that some fo rms of slavery are more temporarily advantageous. If I had spread those first hundred candle-lighting rituals out over thirty years instead of thirty days, I'd still be blissful, although quite unaware of my in­finite potential. Armed with the most powerful methods, evocation chief among them, I cannot turn away from the fa ct that a similar impo­tency strikes.

Once it is realized that any amount of money can be delivered, and once the kinks and quirks have been worked out of the ritual process to allow the money to come, the whole thing becomes commonplace. When you need money, or even just want it fo r any specific thing, there it is, the pile of cash, waiting fo r you to call it out of the ether. Until then, how­ever, the quest fo r it is quite uninteresting. At least to me, it has be­come uninteresting, although I know a fe w others who possess this same spiritual knowledge and ability who seem to never tire of wealth.

When I began, when I first summoned that demon into ma­terialization, I was quite sure of the nature of things, and the mech­anism by which these spiritual sciences operate. That fiend's first task was not to teach the secrets of power, as such would indeed be as pearls cast before the coarsest of swine. Instead, his first task was to instill doubt, to shatter the supports upon which my every as­sumption was based. From the foundation of conscious ignorance, I could then be taught. Azazel was essentially telling me, through all of my work­ings with him in the first thirty days of discipline, that the reality of any thing cannot be relied upon save for in the moment of its materialization. Azazel, my great teacher, did not exist in some corner of the astral plane, descending into physical materialization during the evocation. Instead, at the moment of evocation, his form, his in­tellect, his power and his image were made real, created anew fr om some quantum soup, from some omnipresent protoplasmic field. This is not unique to Azazel, nor to spirits or astral entities, but to everything observable. All of existence is a cat shut in a box, and only when we peek inside does the nature or form of the cat make itself manifest. Such a realization seemed at face-value contrary to the as-167"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"sumptions I had been making all along - assumptions which made complete sense and are very helpful in a practical way. Why, then, would I even continue to evoke at all? If the spirits were fa cets of imagination brought to life only in the moment of their evocation, is the act of ritual mere psychic and sensory masturbation? Again, the realization was not that the spirits are not real, but that nothing is real, nothing exists independent of the observa­tion of the thing. Retiring fr om my interactions with those most unreal things, with the entities that would rise from incense smoke into fu ll materialization before me, in complete contradiction to the general observation, would be as silly as retiring from life itself, realizing that all is Maya. In fa ct, once I had put aside the infantile assumptions to which I had clung fo r so many years, the whole act of evocation, of ritual, of practical spirituality sprung to life anew, presenting itself not as a simple means to an empowered end, but instead being shown to me as a fr amework, a template fo r absolute creation. With all of my supports crushed beneath me, I pressed fo r­ward, calling upon that demon again and again, creating the Infer­nal Empire while I discovered it, the shores of the undiscovered country materializing as I neared. I had made a pact with the most dangerous of demons, under whose tutelage the destruction of all of creation was only the beginning of my path. Azazel instructed me in greater methods of evocation; con­straining spirits; influencing reality through spiritual works; he gave me the names of the Nethers which have been recorded in this text; he gave me their symbols and their attributes; he stood by as I sum­moned them and gained their power and siphoned their knowl­edge. Through Azazel's instruction, and through his invisible influence over even the molecules of this world, he prepared my body fo r my continued empowerment; he prepared the circum­stances of my life fo r the raising of my empire; and he prepared my mind to behold a vision of the Limitlessness that I was about to em­brace. /,. The Pact had sustained me, whereas previous to it my as-168"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"sumptions had done so. For ninety days, the Pact was the law by which my life was governed. For ninety days, the Pact was all that I could count on as being real. Destroy the pact! Burn the words, and destroy them. And stand as a King, as the King of kings, unbound. Azazel wasn't prone to speak in riddles. When he told me to make myself strong, he meant that I was to make myself strong. When he told me to quit my employment, my firm went under. Every prophecy, every instruction that he gave was literal, and was fu lfilled to the letter. Ye t, I still searched fo r his hidden meaning in telling me to destroy the Pact. For three days, I meditated on what he could have meant. For three days, I did not evoke him, or any other spirit. The ninety days had expired, but I was not yet ready to be released fr om the Pact Azazel had taught me much, had taught me a great deal more than any other entity, demonic, angelic, or human, ever had. But I knew that I was lingering on the edge of some great realization. Azazel could not abandon me so suddenly. In those three days of silence, however, something was growing inside of me. My confusion became fe ar. Fear turned to panic, and panic became anger. Anger became rage. Enraged on the third day, as the sun was casting sweeping flames over the desert sky as it retreated behind the western hills, I cursed that demon fo r having brought me so far, only to leave me trembling and trying to pull him against me again, while he turned and left me. I grabbed the Pact in my shaking fist, my lips quivering, car­ing the least that my clutch had wrinkled the paper that I had kept untouched fo r the space of three months. My thumb couldn't strike the wheel of the ligher quickly enough, the flame flickering off of the metal outlet at the shaking of my hands. Damn him.

With a beastly growl, fo rgetting that I was human, that I was civilized, that I possessed language, I threw my wooden altar across the ro om. It shattered, the base separating fr om the top in splinters. My glass-j arred candles fo llowed, cracking into dangerous shards. Skulls and bones that served as fe tish itmes, gifts fr om the spirits themselves, houses of the dead, were hurled into the pile. Item after item, tool after tool was smashed, bent, broken, discarded into the heap of fo rsaken hope. Words left me. My lips spat incoherent sounds. I was not sure what I was doing, or why. Nor did I care. With the same blind rage, I wrapped the whole debris in my Circle of Demonic Pacts, drawn on a thick, black mat, and dragged the lump down the stairs like a murdered corpse, and I stuffe d it in the trunk of my car. I unloaded the throbbing bulk of relics onto the desert sand miles away, and soaked it all in lighter fluid. When I dropped the match on the wet pile and it exploded in flames, my rage vanished. My legs lost all strength. I fe ll to the dirt, my screams and profanities melting into tears. And the ether stirred. The smoke of the burning pile coalesced. A black satyr rose before me. \"Now we may begin;' the Demon said. And then He van-ished. I had made myself an excellent disciple to Azazel, but he de­manded more.

There exists a definite path to Godhood, to the attainment of all power, all knowledge, and to the quintessence of absolute ex­istence. The threefold path to Godhood is: Evocation; Damnation; and Renunciation. 170"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"EVOCATION A good deal of this work has dealt with the matter of evo­cation. Evocation is the essential key to spiritual autonomy as it is the method by which that which is imaginary can be made real, first to the mundane senses through the materialization of the spirit, and then to the external world through the verifiable result achieved. Holding invisible armies in your command is an amazing power, but this is merely a type and a shadow, a tangible metaphor of the greater power of materializing the whole of the world as a condensed specter of imagination. In mastering evocation, you concomitantly master your inner self, your physiology, your emotions, thoughts, even the nor­mally unconscious electrical output of your brain; you master your immediate environment, exerting your will over the minor details of your daily life; and, often only through residual, runoff effects, your incessant magickal meddling effects the whole of the world, changing sometimes the course of history as a whole, influencing people and situations of which you are not, nor never will be aware. Evocation is the first stage of godhood, and it is the infant stage. This method, which most magicians aspire to and struggle for through lifetimes, is only the beginning of the development fr om a bipedal mammal to a limitless, deathless, infinite being. DAMNATION: THE GATEWAY TO LIBERATION A man cannot rise into exaltation, cannot experience his own limitlessness so long as he clings to hope, at all. Hope is the enemy of effort and applied will. When all hope is lost, the indi­vidual comes to the empowering realization that no one nor no thing will rescue him from his circumstances, and that his path forks in opposite directions: either he lays down and dies, or he 171"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"grabs the world by the tail and hurls it in the direction that he de­sires. Most world religions, into one of which most of us are born, teach the crippling principle of hope as if it is some sort of virtue, to rely not on powers manifest nor on the rewards of effort, but on the belief that chance will be swayed in our favor. No human or beast is ever as fierce as when it has nothing left to lose, when even death is an acceptable second to failure. Hope had been ripped fr om many of us early on. I've no­ticed as I've met with thousands of Left Hand Path practitioners that the majority of those who dare to ally with demons have suf­fe red some sort of traumatic abuse in their early childhood. Main­taining hope in the charity of some supposed benevolent deity simply does not resonate with someone who has experienced cru­elty at the hands of fa mily, parents, and caretakers. Hope in good­ness and faith in fe llow man is an insult and a joke to a broken child. When spirituality fi rst becomes important, fo r the self, rather than fo r social or fa milial acceptance, which usually occurs in the early teenage years, the world view of the traumatized child lends more to the understanding that all beings are selfish and driven by a will to power, and that those beings of spirit are the same. The demons do not hide their intentions, but are clear that given the opportunity, they will destroy you. The spiritual entre­preneur is then able to discover routes of making himself as useful to the demons and to the demonic cause as the demons can be use­ful to the Evocator and his cause. In this process of spiritual self-discovery, on the left hand side, there are moments of near panic as the adventurer considers that such diabolical alliances counter the God or the savior with which they were raised. A severing of the past self often must be undertaken in order to move fo rward. The demons do not allow hope to linger long in their com­pany. This is the beauty of betrayal, as it agitates the psyche and keeps the individual from settling too comfortably into any situa­tion long enough to stagnate. Signing the Pact and committing myself to it was a willful 172"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"self-damnation. When I committed myself to Azazel, I realized that I could end up dead, enslaved, imprisoned, or worse. It could easily be argued that I maintained hope that Azazel would treat me kindly, or would release me from torture after a while, but instead it was more of a human sacrifice to that Demon, a sacrifice of my own self, my own life, for the chance to learn and to grow. And yes, there was hope, and I do think that Azazel saw that I had hope, and he fed it just enough to keep me interested, and then to dash it to the ground. Damnation is indeed the loss of all hope. When even the demons, the evil spirits who had been my constant allies, when even the forsaken themselves had forsaken me, I was free to accept my own Liberation. The individual must be beyond redemption or ex­altation, so that he can act and think and be, without prejudice, without censorship. Only in the absence of all hope do we discover who we really are. RENUNCIATION The main difference between Renunciation and Damnation lies in the flow of the thing. In Damnation, all is taken from us, even our hope, because of circumstances outside of ourselves. Through Renunciation, we throw away all that is ours, even our hope. Damnation only takes away the objects and the states that we desire. Through Renunciation, we discard even the desire for them. To hell with Ascent! To hell with knowledge and power! To hell with it all ! And through the Gotterdammerung surge, all power and all knowledge descends upon us. We have become Shiva em­bodied, desiring nothing and thereby gaining everything. The threefold path to Godhood is Evocation, Damnation, and Renunciation. Materialize that which is imaginary.

If we can summon forth Azazel, who by his own insistence is not empirically real, and he can rearrange every minute circum­stance in our lives; if we can summon his legions, which are also not in any substantial way real, to full materialization; if we can command them to obey us and to bring us wealth, love, sex, com­fort, and knowledge of the unknowable; if we can then erase from our minds the very connecting memory of our ties with all demons; and then if, through nothing other than our imagination, we can build a demonic army and can become like unto Azazel we have learned the first step in the possession of the philosopher's stone. Through evocation, we are able to force a rift in known re­ality, bringing at least the specter of something entirely unreal into reality. Once that unreal thing becomes observable, it then becomes real. It is often fairly argued that the observation belongs to only one observer, and is therefore not \"real\" in any general sense, but is an anomalous observation, and therefore can be discarded as unreal and delusional.

THE RITUAL OF TRANSMUTATION OR OF MATERIALIZATION The demon exists as an imaginary form, most often arche­typal, and through the ritual of evocation materializes to the mun­dane senses of the Operator. The Evocator desires a specific end result, and so he searches grimoires fo r a demon archetypally linked with the desired end result. Through the ritual of evocation, that imaginary fo rm is brought into observable reality, and the Evocator commands the demon then to fulfill his desire. The desire for the thing, and the thing itself which is not yet possessed, is as much an inhabitant of the imagination as the demon, yet rather than materializing the desired thing directly, we go about the whole matter by circumvention of the original desire. I pondered this for a while after my final Renunciation, and then I experimented. My experiments unveiled a method of more directly materializing that which I desired, resulting in the fastest, most pure results, using what I have since called \"Blank Evocation;' otherwise called \"The Ritual of Transmutation, or of Materializa­tion:' In order to work this Operation, you must be adept in the art of evocation in general. You must have already experienced the necessary rapture and the fo rced materialization of spirits enough times and with enough intensity to not only be able to immediately identify the various stages of energetic, psychological, and physio­logical shifts that occur during the process of evocation, but you must be able to trigger these internal shifts at will. The only path is that of first-hand experience. With this, all secrets will be revealed to you. Without it, the mystery will re­main mysterious.

Set a large censor before you, in which are laid two or three charcoal disks. Alternatively, you may set four smaller censors around the Circle of Pacts, at each cardinal point, a single charcoal disk in each. Shut out all light from the Temple. Ignite the candles, from right to left fo r more beneficial goals, and from left to right fo r more nefarious ends. Ignite the charcoal disks, deosil or clockwise for benevolent goals and widdershins or counterclockwise fo r malev­olent goals. Drop a few pebbles of either co pal or frankincense resin in­cense on each lit coal. A certain mystery of evocation is that the greater the amount of incense smoke produced, the more easily a full materialization of the spirit may be facilitated. Other manifes­tation bases may be used, such as warm blood or some specific Elixir of Manifestation.• If incense is used, however, ensure that a great amount of smoke is produced. I've found that co pal specifi­cally produces quite a bit of smoke, and that it burns extremely clean. As the red coals liquefy the incense resin, bring your atten­tion to your goal. Yo ur focus should not be the attainment of the final result in the future, but instead should be the materialization of the thing before you, immediately, born not of coincidental align­ment but brought into being ex-nihilio, pushed from your imagi­nation into this world as a real and visible fo rm. The familiar rapture specific to evocation is more difficult to attain in blank evocation, but once the barrier between the imag­ined and the real is penetrated, the whole veil will be torn in two. The struggle to maintain consciousness will rush at you, and in that very moment in the air around you your desired object will mate­rialize as a variety of phantoms, not spirits with faces and bodies, but specters of the object itself. If you desire money, instead of winged fiends, you may find the air filled with spectral coins and cash, with healthy bank statements, and with the objects that you intend to buy with that wealth.

Allow the phantoms to materialize however they will, simply pushing your desire for them to come, now, into the air around you. As there is no information in the collective hallucination for your specific desire manifest (as there is such an invisible library of shared information on grimoiric spirits), the stabilization of the phantoms that you've materialized will need to be fed by you. Sink even deeper into your rapture, and as your body weak­ens to the point of near-collapse, that force within you which is om­nipotent will further activate. All of your strength needs be pushed violently yet silently into the phantoms of your desire, into the air around you. Unlike a good many methods of spiritual manifesta­tion, the desire and the power to make it real is not to be pushed out of your Ajna Chakra, or your Manipura Chakra, or from your mouth or your eyes, but instead is to be pushed from every pore, out of your body, out of your mind, out of your imagination and emotion, and just outside of the Circle of Pacts. In the twinkling of an eye, the phantoms will crystallize in the air, still moving, still dancing, but no longer requiring to be fed, no longer needing you and your attention to be nurtured. That which began as a fantasy within your mind has ges­tated, has been given birth by your own power and will, and has come into life as an energy and a consciousness independent of you.
