[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THAGIRIONThomas KarlssonThe sixth level of the Qliphoth (or the fifth counting from levels of initiation) is calledThagirion which means dispute or juridical process. This can be interpreted in manyways, the religious juridical process where Satan acts prosecutor or the place for thejudgment of God, or where the sentence of God is questioned. Except the manymythological interpretations the name presents the antinomianistisc nature where thelaws of the Sephiroth are counteracted. All Qliphoths have pejorativistic names sincethey are acting antithesis to the present order. The Sephiroth is idealizing unity while itsshadow side is disunited. This is also explaining the meaning of ”dispute” in the nameThagirion.Thagirion is the central qlipha on Ilan Hizon-the outer tree, or the tree of knowledge.This qlipha is the shadow side of Tiphereth on the tree of life. Both are spheres of thechild or the offspring and Tiphereth is associated with Christ and Messiah characterswhile Thagirion is associated with the Anti-Christ and the beast 666. The firstmentioned characters are preaching salvation through them ( Jesus proclaims in thebible that he is the only way to salvation), something that is questioned by the othercharacters who are pointing out the possibility for each man to save himself. Bothspheres are associated with human characters who are thought to manifest this level ona collective human level. Bodhisattvas, secret masters or prophets. Since this is thecentral level some characters are thought to be able to mediate between the worldsabove to the worlds below. Persons are often connected to the two different levelsaccording to the present public opinion: For a Muslim Mohammed will be a Tipherethcharacter (of course ordinary Muslims are not using this terminology), while he for theChristians often have been seen as an Anti-Christ character and then placed inThagirion. Hitler was in the beginning of his career looked upon as something of aMessiah that would save Germany and was here taking on the role as a Tipherethcharacter. Later he turned into a character similar to the beast and is one of the mostpopular candidates for the Anti-Christ title. Nero, Djingis Khan, Bill Clinton and othershave been called Antichrists and have been the shadow person for people. Nietzsche,Crowley and Gurdjieff have more been more accurate Thagirion characters, since theypreached the possibility for man to save himself together with Thagirion related symbollanguage. A person can channel Thagirion and be a guide in the teachings of the darkside.For everyone this level is illumination. This is the sun sphere, the mental plane and herethe magician meets his/her higher self or Daemon who on the Sephiroth takes the formof the Holy Guardian Angel.On the Qliphoth it takes the form of the totem animal. The illumination on theSephiroth is of an intellectual nature and on the Qliphoth it is an illumination of theinstincts. The Initiation of light brings an intellectual distance to the here and now andthe material while the dark initiation brings total awareness in the here and now-in theflesh and the material. The Tiphereth illumination is usually reached through ascetismwhile the Thagirion illumination is reached through sex or ecstatic dance.Through the typhonian alchemy a draconian magician reaches an illumination that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"includes both sides of the sun sphere. This through the state of consciousness called thechepera-consciousness.In alchemy this represents the level of the yellow diamond. The sun sphere alsocorresponds with the topaz and gold in the alchemy of the renaissance (Kether-Thaumiel are also represented by gold in a higher red form). A strong feeling of lust isusually experienced when one is reaching the sun sphere.Here one will be united with goals and ideals and be one with the whole of the self. Thisis the heaven of the religious (or hell for those who rather would go there), the boddhilevel or satori in eastern mysticism. For a dark magician the rising to this level brings afeeling of total power, but not in the naive and more illusory form that can beexperienced on the spheres below. For a white magician a feeling of total goodness isexperienced. Both states are self-sufficient in themselves, but has often been traps formany magicians. This level is only half the way. The sun sphere can in a basicterminology be called a level ” everything of it self”. Beyond is the higher divine levels,the star sphere or the transcendental plane that could be called a level ”more thanitself”. This is the goal for a draconian magician.Tiphereth corresponds with the sun in the form of light, while Thagirion represents theblack sun. The black sun represents the sun in its inner form – where it shines insideman and reveals the hidden Qliphotic worlds. The ordinary sun is the outer sun thatshines on the ordinary world. The black sun is the god Set in the typhonian alchemy,while the ordinary sun is Sets twin Horus. In old norse mythology Balder correspondswith the ordinary sun and his blind brother Höder or Loke with the black sun. Höder issimilar with Odin and also Odin corresponds with the black sun. Thagirion is the sun ofthe shadow side, which can be interpretated as the sun in the underworld – Balder inHel, Ra in Amenti etc. The sun is the symbol of the unity of the whole self that can beaware of itself only when it is in the underworld.This is illustrated by Chepera, theprincipal of existence and the principal of becoming, that carries the sun down in theunderworld and is reborn and creates himself there. In another interpretation the blacksun / the Thagirion principal is more independent of the self and is more like theprincipal the shines upon and brings enlightenment to the self on the journey ofconsciousness into the inner dimensions. In all forms the black sun is the inner orcentral sun that generates enlightenment and divine power to man. There is descriptionsof an outer black sun. One theory describes a world inside the earth; a world that has itsown sun – that is called the black sun. These speculations has been associated with thevril – mythos by Sir Bullwer-Lytton where a divine race inside the earth are in control ofthe divine power called Vril. Another theory describes that in the middle of the universeor in the middle of the our galaxy there is a black sun that shines with a light that we arenot capable of seeing and for us it looks like empty darkness. This sun is also a blackhole that absorbs all normal light.This black sun can be connected with the highestQliphotic principal Thaumiel, rather than with Thagirion.The black sun is generating the power called vril, od or the world kundalini or thedragon power. It can be described as the principal that is manifestating the powers ofchaos. In the bible and in other mythological descriptions this principal acts as thebeast. In old norse mythology it is the Fenriz wolf, in the goetic Qabalah it is the phallicBelfegor. In the Book of Revelation 13:2 is is written : ”the Dragon gave the beast itsthrone and authority ”. We can later read that the number of the beast is a humannumber. This can be understood as the Dragon (chaos) is manifested through Thagirionby a man, or by mankind. The fact that the number of the beast is a human numbershows our relation to the wild animals that civilization and religion have tried to repress."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"On a more esoteric plane it means that man is not just an animal but also a god since666 is the number of the sun and therefore the number that makes man divine.© Dragon Rougewww.dragonrouge.net"}]
