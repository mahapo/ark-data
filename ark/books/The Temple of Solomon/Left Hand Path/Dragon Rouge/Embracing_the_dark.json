The mode of spirituality called the Left Hand Path has, however, not yet attracted the attention of academia. The present study of the dark magic order DRAGON ROUGE constitutes an attempt to contribute thoroughly and creatively to this line of research. Objects of study are the organization, philosophy and practices of the order, as well as the complex discursive conventions involved in the adherents’ construction of coherent world views.

I was of the oppinion thatreligion was something for extremely gullible people, and notanything for a rational and informed individual as myself. I guessmy teenage naivety got the upper hand. It was my interest in ancientmythologies that drove me to study Comparative Religion. The factthat most of my friends were already living in the city of Åbo,coupled with a nagging feeling that at the age of 22 I should probablybe studying something, cemented my decision to apply to ÅboAkademi University.

Not a lot to those unfamiliar with thefield of esotericism, except that negative associations are likely toarise. Alternative spirituality then? Or the Left Hand Path? Again,these terms may not signify anything much to the reader notspecifically fluent in the language of alternative religion. I use theterm alternative spirituality for modes of religious thought andactivity that differ pronouncedly from the forms of traditionalreligion. In fact, the differences may be so significant that using theword religion to describe the phenomenon might be ill suited. TheLeft Hand Path is one strand of alternative spirituality and darkmagic is a form of Left Hand Path spirituality.The present study focuses on Dragon Rouge and explores theforms and functions of the order. Dragon Rouge was a topic ofdiscussion in the Swedish tabloid press in the mid 1990s, despiteits relatively small number of members in comparison to theSwedish national church, and even to more formalized new religiousmovements. This fact alone motivates a study of the order. This isnot, however, the only motivating factor for my research. Recentsocietal transformations have greatly affected the modes of religiouslife, and organizations such as Dragon Rouge are an expression ofthis development. Late modernity has led to a shift of focus awayfrom authoritative institutions and directed it towards theindividual. The postmodern spiritual seeker finds authority in him-/herself, and finds his/her own spiritual path to follow. The pathof one individual is less and less likely to follow in the steps ofanother. Furthermore, the path is far more winding than the pathsof the modern individual. Dragon Rouge provides material for acase study of alternative spirituality at the dawn of the 21st century."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"18CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION1.1 Aim and Purpose of the StudyThe main aim of the present study is to gain an insight intocontemporary Western neopagan-magic spiritualities in general,and into Dragon Rouge in particular. The fundamental questionshave been ‘What is Dragon Rouge?’ ‘How does Dragon Rougeoperate and function?’ and ‘What is specific to Dragon Rouge, andin what way does this order fit into the Western alternative spiritualmilieu?’. Dragon Rouge is a rather new alternative spiritualorganization and very little study has been carried out on the group(see section 1.3.1). This is why a thorough introduction to the orderis called for. In addition to this, very little research has been doneon magical movements similar to Dragon Rouge. In the area ofWestern esotericism many forms of magico-occult spiritualities havebeen researched, but even so, very few studies on movementsadhering to the Western Left Hand Path are to be found. ThereforeI consider it a meaningful task to give Dragon Rouge acomprehensive presentation. A strictly descriptive account is notenough, however, since Dragon Rouge as a movement operates withconcepts which might be unfamiliar to non-magicians, includingacademics not well acquainted with the field of Western esotericism.My investigation aims at providing a deeper analysis as well.I wanted to study and try to explain how and in what way thesocietally rather unorthodox concepts and philosophy of DragonRouge could give birth to a spiritual organization that is quite wellintegrated into the rest of society, without any real friction worthyof the name to be found. When writing my B.A. paper in folkloristicsI had come across mass media-material which criticised the orderquite severely (see Nilsson 1995a; 1995b; Stugart 1995; 1996; SVT1996; Göteborgsposten 1997; Tidningarnas telegrambyrå 1997). Dueto this, I initially took a quite different approach from the one Ifinished with. I wanted to explore how the negative media attentionhad affected the order, and what possible problems there might bebecause of this critique. My hypothesis was that such severeattention surely must have had some effect on the organization andits members. I even wrote a paper on the subject which I presentedat a conference (Granholm 2001b). Later on, when interviewing"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"19CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONDragon Rouge members, I discovered, however, that the negativemedia attention did not really affect them all that much. Certainly,they were annoyed by it and had no real confidence in the tabloidpress, but in the wider perspective it did not seem to be such ‘a bigdeal’. The negative mass media response was received mainly inthe mid 1990s and has not been much of an issue since then.Nevertheless, this discovery led me to my present approach.I wanted to investigate what it was in Dragon Rouge, and inparticular in the worldview fostered by the order, that in the viewof the members of the order made such disregard to criticismpossible. I came to the conclusion that I had to explore the worldviewand philosophy of Dragon Rouge in order to get to the bottom ofthe issue. In combination with the first of my questions, which hadremained a constant, this resulted in the new question: ‘What isspecific to Dragon Rouge?’ and ‘In what way does Dragon Rougefit into, and relate to, the cultic milieu?’ In my view, these twoquestions provide a more fruitful approach to the subject of thestudy.It should be emphasized that the thesis is divided into twodistinct sections. The first major section, comprising of chapters 2through 5, constitute a historic-descriptive exposition on DragonRouge and the context the order is imbedded in. The second majorsection, consisting of chapters 6 and 7, is an in-depth analysis of theways people associated with the order make sense of life andexistence. In this analysis of meaning-making the focus of the studyis systematically narrowed down to dissect and shed light onformative factors in Dragon Rouge.My dissertation is, furthermore, divided into four parts eachof which deals with a specific content. Part one consists of anintroductory discussion about the subject of study as well as athorough presentation and reflection concerning source materialand methods of gathering the material. Also included is a self-positioning in which I give an account of my standpoint in relationto the subject of study, as well as a self-reflective report on factorsin my personal background which, according to my understanding,have influenced the study and the gathering of source materials. Ialso present a brief inventory of important terminology pertaining"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"20CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONto the present study. The terminology mainly consists of termsrelative to the source materials, but I have also included some keyacademic concepts which are employed in the study.Part two consists of chapters 2 through 5, which also constitutesthe first principal section of the work, as mentioned above. Thechapters all deal with the question ‘What is Dragon Rouge?’.Chapter 2 provides a brief contextual background focusing onalternative spirituality in general, and the regions of Sweden andStockholm in particular. Major societal changes in recent time arediscussed, since such shifts in society may have a great impact onreligiosity and spirituality in the contemporary world. This chaptersituates Dragon Rouge within the overarching alternative spiritualmilieu and in the historical context of Western esoteric thought andpractice. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 treat Dragon Rouge as an order and anorganization. Chapter 3 deals more closely with the philosophicalcharacteristics of the order, providing a thorough presentation ofkey philosophical and doctrinal concepts. Chapter 4 takes upDragon Rouge as an organization, providing information on theactual structure, design and functioning of the order. Here, a briefaccount of the historical origin of the order is presented. In chapter5 I give ethnographic accounts of some of my fieldwork and discussthe practice of the order, on an individual as well as on a collectivelevel.Part three of the work, which constitutes the second principalsection, includes chapters 6 and 7. In these chapters I discuss theways in which reality is perceived, communicated and givenmeaning in the context of Dragon Rouge. The theoretical foundationof the analysis of meaning-making within the order is presented inchapter 6. This process of study is performed with the help of asocial constructionist approach and a discourse analytical method.The focus in discourse analysis lies on communicative processes,rather than on mental representations. The main tenet that themethod operates with is that social reality is produced and re-produced in social-communicational settings. Chapter 7 is theanalytical portion of the study of meaning-making. I present sixmajor discourses which play a significant role in the Dragon Rougeworldview. This is my way of dealing with the question ‘What is"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"21CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONparticular to Dragon Rouge’ and of situating the order within themilieu of alternative spirituality.In addition to the final conclusions and a summarizingdiscussion, chapter 8 will also include an in-depth contextualization.I will consider the spiritual milieu in which the order is situatedand analyze how late modern societal transformations affect DragonRouge. Then, on the grounds of these considerations, I will drawmy final conclusions.1.2 TerminologyIn this section I present some of the keywords and concepts whichare relevant to the study, and which are important in understandingthe text. I have divided the section into key academic concepts andterms which are used in a Dragon Rouge insider setting.1.2.1 Key Academic ConceptsWestern EsotericismWestern esotericism denotes “a Western form of spirituality whichstresses the importance of the individual effort to gain spiritualknowledge, or gnosis, whereby man is confronted with the divineaspect of existence”, and further emphasizes the holistic qualitywhich is so common to this specific form of spirituality (Bogdan2003b: 8). Western esotericism per se is generally considered to havecome into existence, in the academic meaning of the term, duringthe renaissance when various esoteric notions and currents cametogether and where fitted into a common frame of reference (seeBogdan 2003b: 8; Hanegraaff 1996: 386-388). Western esotericismand its relevance for the present study is treated in section 2.1.OccultismOccultism has been defined as a series of practices grounded in thetheory of esotericism. This definition is based on the works ofEdward E. Tiryakian, in whose view occultism implies techniques"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"22CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONbased on hidden and scientifically un-measurable forces in natureor the cosmos and that result in empirical effects (see Ahlbäck 1998:166; based on Tiryakian 1972: 498-499).Wouter J. Hanegraaff has a different view on occultism. Hedefines occultism as an etic term in the study of religion “whichcomprises all attempts by esotericists to come to terms with a disenchantedworld or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericismfrom the perspective of a disenchanted secular world” (Hanegraaff 1996:422). In practice this means that occultism is to be seen as a form ofesotericism that emerged in the late 19th century, and where theidea of correspondences has given way to the idea of causality – inaccordance with a mechanistic scientific worldview. Hanegraaffmakes away with the distinction between theoretical esotericismand practical occultism suggested by Tiryakian. (Hanegraaff 1996:422-423).AlchemyAlchemy is an important current in Western esotericism (see Faivre1994). In popular thought, alchemy is often viewed as pre-scientificchemistry, with the purely materialistic goal of transforming leadinto gold. This is true, but it is not the only aspect of medievalalchemy (Dobbs 1975; Shumaker 1972: 161), and certainly not incontemporary utilization of the craft. A keyword in the discourseof alchemy is transmutation, which signifies the refining rather thanthe simple transformation of materials. The concept of transmutinglead into gold, whilst also referring to the actual practice oftransforming a cheap metal into an more valuable one, is an allegoryof a spiritual alchemy signifying the alchemist transmuting his/her soul to perfection (Dobbs 1975: 35-39; Thomas 1971: 269-271;Shumaker 1972: 186-193).QliphothQliphoth is the dark aspect, or shadow-side, of the Sephiroth of Jewishqabalah. In qabalah the path to the Godhead leads through tenincreasingly pure worlds on the tree of life – the sephiroth. Theworlds on the sephiroth are, from the most material to the mostdivine Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tipareth, Geburah, Chesed, Binah,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"23CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONChokmah and Kether. Malkuth represents the material world. Theqabalist ascends through the ten worlds until finally finding unionwith God in the sephira of Kether. According to Jewish mysticism,in the beginning God, Ain Sof1, was everything. In order to createthe world Ain Sof had to contract itself in order for an emptynothingness to exist. Ain Sof then emanated through ten increasinglymaterial worlds, the sephiroth, in order to create our world. Thestory of the qliphoth is that one or more of the containers or vesselsin which the divine sparks of God were contained broke and someof the divine sparks, 288 in Lurian qabalah, were trapped in them(Trautner-Kromann 1992: 11).With the withdrawal of the divine light, which returned to thecreator, the vessels became the qliphoth, the tree of death or tree ofknowledge (see Giller 2001: 49; 148-149; Scholem 2001: 76-77). Thesparks, and Sitra Ahra – the Other Side, are impure as they havebecome independent from God (Scholem 1991: 73); they are inimbalance and form no part of the constructive forces of existence(Halevi 1976: 39). Bernhard Pick writes of a Sephiroth of Darknessor Evil which mirrors the Sephiroth of Good (Pick 1974: 77-78). Theqliphoth consist of the ten worlds, from the world closest to ourown to the world farthest away, Lilith, Gamaliel, Samael, A’arab Zaraq,Thagirion, Golachab, Gha’agsheblah, Satariel, Ghagiel and Thaumiel.MagicMagic is obviously a key concept for the study at hand. Manyresearchers in the field of religion have attempted to define magicand make a clear distinction between it and religion. Although old,James Frazer’s definition of magic as an attempt to control thesupernatural forces, in contrast to submitting to them in religion(Frazer 1987: 66-68), has shown itself to be very enduring. RodneyStark and William Bainbridge see both religion and magic as offeringcompensation for experienced feelings of deprivation, and magicas offering more specific compensation to the more generalcompensation offered by religion (Stark & Bainbridge 1996: 36-42).1 In the Pritzker edition Zohar Ain Sof (or Ein Sof) is translated as: “’Thereis no end’; that which is boundless; the Infinite. The ultimate reality of Godbeyond all specific qualities of sefirot; the God beyond God.” (Matt 2004a: 459)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"24CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONPicture 1. The sephiroth. The qabalisticTree of Life. From Karlson 2004: 26."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"25CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONIn Emile Durkheim’s view, magic and religion both work withthe same general premises, such as belief systems, rites, myths anddogmas, but magic does not unite its practitioners in churches inthe same way as religion (Durkheim 1995: 41-42).I consider the distinctions somewhat problematic as both magicand religion in general work on the same premises and realfoundational differences can be hard to find (see Hammond 1970;McDonalds 1995; Granholm 2000: 33-44, 56; Brodin 2001: 38-39). Iuse the term magic since this is the term used by Dragon Rouge todenote what the order does.Cultic Milieu, Alternative Spiritual MilieuThe term Cultic Milieu was coined by sociologist Colin Campbellin the article The Cult, the Cultic Milieu and Secularization, publishedin A Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain in 1972. Campbellidentified the ‘Cultic Milieu’ as the breeding ground from whichcults were born and as such a much more stable element in societythan the cults which spring out of it. (Campell 1972; see Hanegraaff1996: 14-16).I use the term Alternative Spiritual Milieu to denote the overallatmosphere and context in which alternative spiritualities exist. Thefield of alternative spiritualities can be seen as a sphere in whichspecific movements, groups and practices co-exist and often crossover into each other. For example, a person who is a member of aWiccan coven may participate in some ‘New Age’ practices, frequentthe bookstores and specialist shops that druids, Aura-Somatherapists and Satanists also frequent, and be a member of a nation-wide neopagan interest organization in which Wiccans, heathensand neoshamans alike belong.The term Alternative Spirituality is in turn defined as spiritualmovements, groups and practices that do not belong to the religiousmainstream, and that are not organized in traditional ways. InSwedish society for example neopaganism, Satanism, and ‘New Age’could be seen as being alternative spiritualities."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"26CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION1.2.2 Insider Terminology Relevant for the StudyBlack, Dark, White and Light Magic, MagickThe art of magic is usually divided into black and white magic.Black magic is said to be used for egoistic and often evil purposes,whereas white magic is used for altruistic and benevolent purposes(Cavendish 1977: 12; Paranormal.se 2004a). The distinctionsometimes appears as Dark (Mörk) and Light (Ljus) magic. In DragonRouge usage Black or Dark magic is magic where the magicianexplores the hidden and unknown, thus dark, aspects of existenceand works with the transforming forces of chaos, whereas White orLight magic is of a more religious nature and works with the existingstructures and the preserving forces of cosmos. No moral judgementis attributed to the terms, and black magic is not seen as anythingeither egoistic or evil. (Eriksson 2001: 2-9).Magic is variously spelled as ‘magic’ or ‘magick’. Magic spelledwith a ‘ck’ instead of with ‘c’-only originates from the early 20thcentury occultist Aleister Crowley. ‘Magick’ is commonly used byoccultists to distinguish their art from the tricks of stage magicians(Lewis 1999: 183). ‘Magick’ is also used to distinguish Crowlean-based magic from other forms. Dragon Rouge members tend to useboth spellings, but since the form ’magic’ appears on the Englishversion of the official Dragon Rouge homepage, I have chosen touse this form.Regarding occultism, Dragon Rouge defines it as the theorywhereas magic is occultism put into practice.High magic, low magicMagic is traditionally divided into high and low magic. High magicis magic used in order to perfect oneself and attain one’s fullpotential. Low magic is magic used in order to reap material benefits,to evoke demons etc., that is to say magic without the goal of self-deification (Cavendish 1977: 12). The Dragon Rouge view is thatthe distinction between high and low magic is not all that functional.In the order’s view so called low magic can be used with the goal ofperfecting oneself (If mgt 2001/50)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"27CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONWill, True Will, Higher Self, DaemonWill is an important concept in contemporary magic. Will shouldnot be understood as the mundane, everyday wants and whims ofa person, but rather as the sum of the magician’s true personality.Through magic the magician identifies and comes into contact withhis/her True Will and refines his person. The term is written with acapital ‘W’ and is interchangeable with True Will. (Eriksson 2001:120-123).The magician’s guardian spirit is identified in Dragon Rougeas the manifestation of the magician’s True Will. The guardian spiritis also called the Daemon and the Higher Self. (Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 1). Aleister Crowley is often identified as the magician who madethe concept of Will so important in contemporary magic, and, whilethis is true, the concept was used in much the same far earlier bythe 16-17th century esotericist, Jacob Böhme (Faivre 1994: 63).Magical progress is often talked about in Dragon Rouge as analchemical process in which the magician compresses his essenceinto an increasingly pure form. The result is the Black Diamond whichis the magician’s compressed Higher Self, the magician havingbecome a god. (IF mgt 2001/11; 47; Eriksson 2001: 124-130).The Left Hand Path (LHP), The Right Hand PathThe terms Left Hand Path2 and Right Hand Path refer to two differentways of relating to and approaching the numinous. According to2 A somewhat trivial but still interesting issue is that of connotations of theword left. The left side has in many cultures been regarded as the side of wrongand evil. ‘Vãma’ can be translated as woman or left (Cologne Sanskrit 2004). InIndia the right hand was used when eating and the left hand when cleaningoneself after visiting the toilet. Thus, the left hand symbolized impurity, inphysical as well as in spiritual matters and its connection to the female alsodenotes that the woman is impure. In the Western world the left and left-handedpeople have symbolized a broad range of undesirable qualities, such asweakness, clumsiness and dishonesty. In the Bible the tribe of Benjaminoriginated from the right hand side, whereas Ehud of the tribe was left-handed,and a murderer. The word left in the English language originates from the Anglo-Saxon ‘lyft’, which meant weak or worthless. The Italian word for left handed,‘mancino’, also means treacherous. The Latin word ‘sinister’ translates intoEnglish as left or wrong, perverse (Latin Dictionary 2004). Not to forget the factthat we shake hands with our right hand, not our left. Earlier, Westernpsychology did consider the left-handed person to be a bearer of all sorts of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"28CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONDragon Rouge, the left side stands for “chaos, darkness and freedom”and the right side stands for “order, light and restriction” (DragonRouge 1996/3: 3). The biggest difference between the paths is to befound in the view they represent of purity and morality. Left HandPath Tantra views everything as manifestations of the divine, andthus even that which is traditionally viewed as impure and demonicis holy (see Feuerstein 1998: 224-229). Therefore things such as sexcan be used in order to attain enlightenment. On the morality issueramblers on the Left Hand Path usually discard a once-and-for-alloutlined and valid-on-all-occasions ethical code for an individualsituational morality. The terms originate from India and are mainlyused in a Tantric context (see Harvey 1997: 97). Satanism is said tobe the Left Hand Path of the west (Paranormal.se 2004b). In thewest the Left Hand Path is usually used for the occultists whosegoal is self-deification with a maintained individuality, whereasthe Right Hand Path is used for the occultists striving for a unionwith the divine with a resulting resolution of the magician’sindividuality. The terms are generally abbreviated LHP and RHP.(IF mgt 2001/50; Dragon Rouge 2004c).Kundalini, ChakrasKundalini is a concept originating from Indian Tantrism and stands forthe innate life-force of a person, also identified as Shakti. The Kundalini-energy is represented as a snake rolled three and a half turns around aShiva-lingam, the phallic symbol of Shiva, and situated at the base of aperson’s torso, in the Muladhara Chakra. The Kundalini-serpent isthought to usually be in a dormant state, but through meditation it canbe awakened and thus it rises from the Shiva-lingam up towardsthe head. In travelling through the body it passes through differentpower-nexuses, Chakras, usually depicted as seven in number, andthis results in activation of occult powers. A particularly importantChakra is the Ajna Chakra, situated in the forehead, and its activationunwanted social behaviours and qualities, such as homosexuality, incestuousdesires, impotence, and mental disorders. See also Scholem 2001 and Idel 1988for the view of the left in Jewish mysticism (Scholem 2001: 74-76; Idel 1988:208). Margaret Stutley gives a short example of Left as the sinister and unwantedside (Stutley 1980: 98).

Whenthe Kundalini rises through the seventh power nexus, the SahasraraChakra, enlightenment is attained. (Woodroffe 1956: 11-17; 1959: 652-674; Eliade 1958: 245-249; Feuerstein 1998) In Dragon Rouge thepractitioners also work with hidden, thus dark, chakras which arenot activated in regular Kundalini meditation (Dragon Rouge2001g). (Dragon Rouge 2003b).Runology, Runosophy, Rune MagicRunology is the study of runes. This denotes the academic study ofrunes as well as more esoteric speculation. In fact, these two aspectsare often mixed in runological works. (see Andersson 1997: 15-16).Runosophy is the more esoteric study and application of runes, oras Thomas Karlsson puts it, “the wisdom of the runes” (Karlsson2002a: 8). Rune magic, then, is runology and runosophy put intopractice. Runosophy and Rune magic are much used in DragonRouge, since they are among Thomas Karlsson’s main magicalinterests. In Dragon Rouge rune magic is put into a system muchsimilar to the sephiroth or qliphoth in qabalah (Karlsson 2002a: 114-120). Works by the Swedish runologists, Johannes Bureus (1568-1652)and Sigurd Agrell (1881-1937), including Bureus’ concept of Adulrunaand Agrell’s uthark-theory are much used in the order (IF mgt 2001/50; Karlsson 2002f. See Andersson 1997: 99-103, 241-246 for moreinformation on Bureus and Agrell. The uthark is discussed more insection 2.1.1). The discarding of the futhark, the common rune-row,in favour of the more esoteric uthark is also a common feature ofthe Swedish neoshamanic movement (See Hedlund & Gejel 1988;Gejel 1988: 101; Grimsson 1990: 80-81).Qliphoth in Dragon Rouge UseThe qliphoth is an important theme in Dragon Rouge, as it stands asthe model for the order’s initiatory system. In the Dragon Rougecontext the qliphoth consist of eleven worlds, in contrast to the tenworlds of sephiroth. This is due to the world of Thaumiel being adouble world, representing separation and liberation from God andhis creation instead of total union with God in Kether on the sephiroth.Whereas Malkuth is our world, Lilith is its nigth-side, actualised in"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"30CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONPicture 1.

The worlds ofthe sephiroth are ruled by archangels and the worlds of the qliphothare ruled by demons. (IF mgt 2001/47; 49; Eriksson 2001: 10-22;Karlsson 2002e; Karlsson 2004: 24-39, 53-58, 66-67).The qliphotic qabalist, or the dark magician, descends throughthe different qliphoth and becomes a god through the qlipha ofThaumiel. There are several different ways of writing qliphoth, suchas Kliffoth, Kelippot etc. I have chosen to use qliphoth in the plural andqlipha in the singular as these are the written forms used on the Englishversion of the official Dragon Rouge homepage (Dragon Rouge 2004b).1.3 Earlier ResearchIn this section I present the literature relevant for my topic and used inthe present study. I have divided the presentation into three parts;literature on Dragon Rouge, literature on magic and Western esotericismand literature on spirituality and meaning-making. In section 1.3.1 I treatthe academic research on Dragon Rouge, as well as non-academic works,that in some way refer to or deal with Dragon Rouge. Section 1.3.2 gathersthe relevant research in the field of Western esotericism and the historyof magic. In the same section I also introduce works on alchemy, occultism,eastern esotericism and neopaganism, when the research in question isof relevance for this study. In section 1.3.3 I present literature dealingwith meaning-making in relation to spirituality. I have also included moregeneral works on meaning-making where these works have relevancefor the present study.1.3.1 Research on Dragon RougeResearch on Dragon Rouge is basically non-existent, at least whenit comes to higher academic research. The most comprehensive andserious study of the organization is my master’s thesis from ÅboAkademi University written in the fall of 2000 (Granholm 2000).This work is, however, outdated and deals mostly with the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"32CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONclassification of Dragon Rouge, while still offering a basic insightinto the teachings and practice of the organization. Henrik Bogdan’sarticle Västerländsk esoterism i svensk ungdomskultur [WesternEsotericism in Swedish Youth Culture] in the anthology TalandeTro [Meaningful Faith] deals mainly with Dragon Rouge, althoughit also gives a short presentation on the academic study of Westernesotericism and a brief description of Western esotericism in general(Bogdan 2003a). Bogdan’s article is a good introductory description ofthe order and its key characteristics, although, because of its length,it is by necessity on a very basic level. Liselotte Frisk’s workNyreligiositet i Sverige [New Religiosity in Sweden] contains a shortchapter on Dragon Rouge (Frisk 1998: 142-147). Although this textis very short, it is still among the best published academic accountsof Dragon Rouge. The article by Bogdan draws to a large extent onFrisk’s book but the author has also done an interview with thefounder of the order. Both of these works, although good pieces ofacademic writing, are, because of the limited number of pagesavailable, general and cursory in character.Other writers who have mentioned the organization are Karl-Erik Nylund and Håkan Arlebrand (Nylund 1998: 239-242;Arlebrand et al. 1995: 137; Arlebrand 1998: 112-113; Wallin &Arlebrand 2001: 211). Both Nylund’s and Arlebrand’s accounts arebiased, however, and the authors’ purposes, especially Nylund’s,seem to be to warn their readers about the order. Therefore, bothNylund’s and Arlebrand’s contributions are more useful as a generalaccount of the more polemic attitudes towards Dragon Rouge, thanas actual accounts of the nature of the order. The writers make theirstatements from a Christian, and anti-occultist, point of view.Nylund’s book includes quite a blatant attempt to discredit ThomasKarlsson, the founder of the organization (see Nylund 1998: 239).Arlebrand’s works do however have merit with regard todescriptions of phenomena and movements “further away fromhome”. His accounts of, for example, the Theosophical Society andAnthroposophy are quite valid. Dragon Rouge is also mentioned ina work by the Finnish anti-Satanist, Riku Rinne (Rinne 1998: 13-16).Dragon Rouge is also briefly referred to in an article by MartinHolmberg in the book Att se det dolda [To Perceive the Hidden](Holmberg 1998: 256), in Jan Svanberg’s Master’s Thesis (Svanberg"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"33CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION1994: 33), in Olav Hammer’s work on ‘New Age’, written prior tohis doctoral thesis (Hammer 1997: 128) and in Henrik Bogdan’sdoctoral thesis (Bogdan 2003b:238). In all these works Dragon Rougeis only mentioned in passing in the context of other subjects(neopagan magic in the case of Holmberg and Hammer,Scandinavian neoshamanism in the case of Svanberg and Westerninitiatory esotericism in the case of Bogdan). Due to the very shortand limited accounts of the order in these studies, it is very difficultto base any assumptions on them. The vast amount of differentspiritual phenomena with which Dragon Rouge is associated inthese texts is, however, an interesting fact. It underlines the difficultyof defining and classifying the order.I have also acquired some unpublished academicundergraduate papers dealing with Dragon Rouge. Andrei Marin’spaper The Dragon and the Northern Star: An Anthropological Insight ofa Magical Order in Northern Europe (Marin 2000) is an attempt toformulate Dragon Rouge philosophy, practice and organizationalstructure for an academic audience. The paper argues quite stronglyfor the magico-pagan approach to the world and contains manyquotations from the Dragon Rouge homepage. One of the best piecesof work dealing with the order and related subjects is MargaretaNobell’s paper, Den vänstra handens väg: Om mörkmagiker, satanister,djävulsdyrkare och konstruktion av identitet och karisma på nätet (TheLeft Hand Path: On Dark Magicians, Satanists, Devil Worshippersand Construction of Identity on the Web) (Nobell 2002). Her workdeals with the Left Hand Path as manifested in Western, in particularSwedish, magic orders, and discusses Dragon Rouge to some extent.Nobell’s work is insightful and treats subjects often neglected inmore established academic works. I have not used theundergraduate studies dealing with the order to any larger extent.1.3.2 Magic and Western EsotericismThe subject of magic orders in general, as well as in particular, isalso a largely neglected field of study in comparative religion andreligious studies. One may find some works dealing with the likesof Eliphas Lévi (Alphonse Louise Constant), Aleister Crowley and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"34CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONthe latter’s involvement in magical orders (The Golden Dawn, OrdoTempli Orientis and the Church of Thelema), but most of theseaccounts are more or less written from an insider’s perspective oras polemics (see Howe 1972). With regard to Aleister Crowley, theworks more often than not focus on unwarranted details of the man’spersonal life, most of which seem to have little relevance to an academicstudy of his teachings and practice.The works of Frances Yates from the 1960s onward areconsidered to have instigated the birth of Western esotericism as afield of academic study (Bogdan 2003b: 9). As Bogdan notes, theresearch dealing with Western esotericism prior to this had mainlyfocused on certain elements, not on Western esotericism as a specificform of thought. Yates’s book, Giordano Bruno and the HermeticTradition (Yates 1964), is a groundbreaking study, due to the factthat it takes a new approach and attitude to the study of Westernesotericism (see Bogdan 2003b: 11-13), even though there areproblems with the study (see Hanegraaff 2001).Another researcher who has contributed vastly to, and who insome ways can even be seen as the founding father of, the academicstudy of Western esotericism is Antoine Faivre. His book Access toWestern Esotericism (Faivre 1994) may be considered compulsoryreading for the researcher dealing with Western esotericism. In thiswork he presents a framework for identifying and analysing esotericmovements. Other works to which Faivre has contributed and thatare used in this study are Modern Esoteric Spirituality (Needleman& Faivre 1993), Gnosis and Hermeticism from Antiquity to Modern Times(Hanegraaff & van den Broek 1998) and Western Esotericism and theScience of Religion (Hanegraaff & Faivre 1998).Other important scholars in the field of Western Esotericismare Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Olav Hammer and Jacob Needleman(Hammer 1997; 1999; 2001; Hanegraaff 1996; 1998; 2001; 2004;Hanegraaff & van den Broek 1998; Needleman & Faivre 1993).Although Hanegraaff and Hammer follow in the footsteps of Faivre,they deal mainly with the ‘New Age Movement’. The Swedishacademic Henrik Bogdan’s research has focused on Western esotericinitiatory movements and his studies have also been of use in thiswork (Bogdan 2003a; 2003b; 2004).The majority of the useful studies on magic focus on the history"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"35CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONof magical thought in the west. Authors such as Francis King,Richard Cavendish and E.M. Butler have written extensively onmagic from medieval times to the early 20th century (Butler 1949;Cavendish 1968; 1975; 1977; King 1970; 1971; 1975). Although theseworks are old, they are not outdated. With reference to my studyEllic Howe’s, The Magicians of the Golden Dawn (Howe 1972), hasalso been insightful. The Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn hasinfluenced many of today’s magical societies and was also theincubator of many likewise influential magicians such as AleisterCrowley, Dione Fortune, E.A. Waite and W.B. Keats. In the researchinto magic and occultism many studies focusing on alchemy,qabalah and mysticism have been carried out. Concerning alchemy,Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs’ The Foundation of Newton’s Alchemy (Dobbs1975) is a good study, giving a history, description and context ofthe art as well as showing the connections between alchemy andthe emergence of the new materialist-scientific worldview.Influential works on the Jewish qabalah have been written byGershom Scholem and Moshe Idel (Idel 1997; Scholem 1987; 1991).‘New Age’ spirituality is a very interesting phenomenon, whichrelates to my studies, and here Paul Heelas and Michael York, aswell as the abovementioned Wouter J. Hanegraaff and OlavHammer, have provided important insights (Heelas 1996; York1995). Neopaganism and ‘New Age’ are often linked, and as DragonRouge can be considered a part of the neopagan milieu, studiesdealing with ‘New Age’ and neopaganism are important. In additionto the authors mentioned above, works by such scholars as GrahamHarvey, James R. Lewis, Ingvild Saelid Gilhus and LisbethMikaelsson have also been of use (Harvey 1997; Lewis 1996a; 1996b;Mikaelsson 1996; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998; 2003).As stated earlier, most of the research on esotericism focuseson Western traditions, while Eastern esoteric currents are not reallydealt with to the same extent. Eastern esotericism, mainly Tantrismand Tantric Yoga, have, however, become increasingly popular inWestern esoteric movements. Dragon Rouge is no exception to this.Therefore, I have also read existent studies on these subjects. LeftHand Path Tantrism is not really dealt with at length in purelyacademic research and hence I have, at times, had to draw on worksthat are more popular-scientific in character. I have studied the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"36CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONworks of the likes of Mircea Eliade, Georg Feuerstein, JohnWoodroffe, Julius Evola and Benjamin Walker (Eliade 1958;Woodroffe 1958; 1959; 1960; Walker 1982; Evola 1992;Feuerstein1998). A good source of academic study on Tantrism isRun Gröndahl’s PhD Thesis Den gudomliga kroppen [The DivineBody], which deals specifically with Tantrism and Shaktism(Gröndahl 2000).1.3.3 Spirituality and Meaning MakingStudies on meaning-making, both in the religious sphere, andoutside it, are numerous. The theoretical frameworks range fromsociological through social-psychological to purely psychological,and in all of these one can find a multitude of different approaches.In the more humanistically oriented psychology of religion, depth-psychology based on Freudian psychology and, in the Nordiccontext, integrated role-theory and symbolic reality construction,based on Hjalmar Sundén’s work as presented by Nils G. Holm,have had an important standing (Holm 1997; see also S. Illman 1992;R. Illman 2004). The Jungian psychoanalytic approach has not had such astrong position in the Psychology of Religion, but much more in theinterpretive frames of ‘New Agers’ and other neo-spiritually inclinedbelievers (see for example Hanegraaff 1998: 496, 496-513; Bogdan2003b: 19). A more positivist approach is taken in the cognitivescience study of religious thought3.3 The exponents of this view often base their work and theories on socio-biological models and argue that the origin of religion can be sought in theevolution of the human animal. Notable scholars in the Cognitive science schoolare Dan Sperber and Pascal Boyer (Sperber 1996; 2000; Boyer 1993; 1994; 2001).Another scholar worth mentioning is Stewart Guthrie who attempts to explainthe birth of religion with human anthropomorphic projections on natural objectsand subjects (Guthrie 1993). Thomas E. Lawson and Robert N. McCauley havetaken a slightly different approach and have studied the ritualistic elements ofreligion (McCauley & Lawson 1990; 2002). The cognitive approach in thepsychology of religion has quite a strong standing in Finland, and here authorssuch as Ilkka Pyysiäinen and Tom Sjöblom have taken this approach (Pyysiäinen1996; 2001; Sjöblom 2000). Claudia Strauss’s and Naomi Quinn’s A CognitiveTheory of Cultural Meaning is, although not explicitly dealing with religion, an"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"37CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONI have chosen to take a social constructionist approach tomeaning-making. My theoretical base draws mainly on the worksof Kenneth J. Gergen, as presented in his books An Invitation to SocialConstruction and Social Construction in Context (Gergen 1999; 2001).In addition to Gergen’s books I have also used Vivien Burr’s AnIntroduction to Social Constructionism (Burr 1995). These scholars havea very similar view on social constructionism, but Gergen inparticular identifies many different forms of constructivism andemphasizes the focus on language as a tool for reality constructionin Social Constructionism. I have also chosen to focus on languageand other symbol-systems as meaning-making systems, andespecially on discourse as reality-forming.Few academic works dealing with Western esotericism andmeaning-making have been published. One major work is OlavHammer’s Claiming Knowledge, in which he discusses the mainepistemological strategies employed by esotericists to legitimizetheir worldviews (Hammer 2001). Hammer deals with esotericmovements from Theosophy in the late 1800s to ‘New Age’ in ourday. While Hammer’s work is important and very thorough, I amrather unhappy with the underlying tone of the work. Hammer’sintent seems to be to discredit the movements he has studied andto show that their foundations are based on historically incorrectfacts. As true as this often is, I fail to see the productive merits infalsifying the claims and beliefs held by ‘New Age’ supporters. Iwill give two examples from the conclusions of Hammer’s thesis.First, when discussing the origin of the esoteric tradition inEnlightenment thought, and concluding that the tradition has leftout much of that which was essential to the era, Hammer comments:“In a sense, the positions of the Esoteric Tradition studied here arethe results of the Enlightenment gone astray” (Hammer 2001: 507).Furthermore Hammer points to the similarities between thetradition and the ways of thought of the preceding Romantic era,and goes on to state: “However, whereas the Romantic conceptionwas capable of producing works of the greatest beauty, the literary,interesting work in the cognitive approach to meaning-making (Quinn & Strauss1997). Michael Tomasello criticises what he views as a too biologicallydetermined cognitive science and points to the role of human culture in theformation of cognitive agency (Tomasello 1999)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"38CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONmusical and artistic products of the New Age are sometimesindistinguishable from religious kitsch” (Hammer 2001: 508). Ofcourse, these examples are just isolated excerpts uprooted from theircontexts, but this is the tone expressed throughout the work.The works on religious reality construction by Peter Berger andThomas Luckmann (Luckmann & Berger 1966; Berger 1969) havebeen very influential in the academic study of religion. Althoughboth works were originally written in the 1960s they are still relevantstudies in religious meaning-making. I have, however, chosen notto use the works of Berger and Luckmann as much as the works ofmore recent discourse analysts.In the in-depth analytical section in chapter 7, my maintheoretical framework is based on discourse analytical theory andmethod. Different theorists have different views on discourse andtherefore the method has been used in various ways. MarianneWinther Jørgensen and Louise Phillips discuss three main schoolsof discourse analysis: discourse theory, critical discourse analysisand discursive psychology (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:25-28).Discourse theory was developed by Ernesto Laclau and ChantalMouffe and is not as practically based as the other two schools(Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:31). The primary goal in critical discourseanalysis is to explore the relation between discursive practice andsocio-cultural change (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:66). Importantcritical discourse analysts are, among others, Norman Fairclough,Lilie Chouliaraki and Teun van Dijk (Fairclough 1992; 1995a; 1995b;Fairclough & Chouliaraki 1999; van Dijk 1987; 1997; 2001).According to Phillips and Jørgensen, discursive psychology wasinitially developed in social psychology as a critique of, and aresponse to, cognitive science (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:97).Important discursive psychologists are Jonathan Potter, MargaretWetherell, Derek Edwards and John Shotter (Potter 1996; Potter &Edwards 1992; Shotter 1993; Wetherell & Potter 1989; 1992;Wetherell et al. 2001). Discursive psychology is very muchinfluenced by the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein (Phillips &Jørgensen 2000:97).A major difference between the three schools concerns viewson the role of discourse in the constitution of reality. The views"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"39CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONrange from the rather moderate social constructionism in criticaldiscourse analysis, where discourse is seen as both constituted bynon-discursive elements and as constituting the non-discursive; tothe radical social constructionism in discourse theory, wherediscourse constitutes everything, that is to say everything isdiscursive. Discursive psychology falls in between discourse theoryand critical discourse analysis (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:97). I havetaken a discursive psychological approach but have tried, followingthe example set by Phillips and Jørgensen (Phillips & Jørgensen2000:131-154), to integrate the different views on discourse as muchas possible and have used works from both discursive psychologyand critical discourse analysis. The discourse theory of Laclau andMouffe is not a part of my theoretical framework.Good general works on discourse analysis and examples of themethod in practice are provided by Louise Phillips and MarianneWinther Jørgensen, Arja Jokinen, Kirsi Juhola, Eero Suoninen andBarbara Johnstone (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000; Suoninen, Juhola &Jokinen 1993; 1999; Suoninen 1997; Jokinen & Juhola 1996; Johnstone2002).In addition to works dealing with meaning-making in general,I have also used works by social scientists and social philosophers,dealing with recent social change and characteristics. ZygmuntBauman and Anthony Giddens have written extensively on the late-modern, or postmodern, period of Western societies (Bauman 1992;1994; 1997a; 1997b; 2000a; 2000b; Giddens 1990; 1996). I have alsoused works dealing with identity construction written by StuartHall, Anthony Giddens and Richard Jenkins (Hall 1996; 2002;Giddens 1996; Jenkins 1996). Globalization theories represent a thirdmajor trend in contemporary sociology and sociology of religion,and I have mainly employed works by Roland Robertson, MalcolmWaters and Ulf Hannerz (Robertson 1992; 1995; Waters 1995;Hannerz 1996). In linking all of this to religion and spirituality, aswell as in dealing with the re-enchantment of the world, I haveused works by Paul Heelas (Heelas 1996; 2002)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION1.4 Presentation of SourcesThe material at the base of an academic study quite naturally consistsof a diverse range of different sources. Such is the case with thepresent study as well. My main material is formed by the interviewsI conducted, and recorded, with several Dragon Rouge members in2001 and 2002. In addition to the interviews, I have also gatheredresponses to a questionnaire I handed out or sent to various DragonRouge members, information collected during my fieldwork andparticipant observation with the order in 2001-2004, official DragonRouge documents, members’ papers and texts as well as books andother texts produced by Dragon Rouge members, and Internetmaterial in some way pertaining to the order, both the officialwebsite with the members’ discussion board and other DragonRouge-related material found on the Internet.All of the material collected has guided me in my analysis andthus formed the present work. However, different segments of thematerial have surfaced as key elements in different sections of thestudy. The main sources in chapters 3 and 4 are the official materialof the order in combination with the questionnaires and the Internetsources. The ethnographies in chapter 5 quite naturally rely on myparticipant observation on the order. In the discourse analyticalsection, where I study meaning-making mechanisms in DragonRouge, the interview material is mainly used, with segments fromthe rest of the material in a supportive role.1.4.1 The InterviewsMy main first-hand material consists of in-depth interviews withvarious Dragon Rouge members. The members interviewed havebeen active, and thus leading, Dragon Rouge members. The gender-balance of the material is good, as I have interviewed a roughlyequal number of female and male members. Most of the interviewswere conducted with members of the mother-organization in Stockholm,Sweden, but three additional interviews were conducted with membersactive in lodges other than the Stockholm mother-organization. Two of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"41CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONthese interviews were done with members from the Gothenburg-based lodge Helheim, and one of the interview subjects had beenactive in Stockholm earlier. The third additional interview was donewith the leader of, the now defunct, lodge Thagirion, at that timebased in Hagen, Germany. Some of those interviewed also answeredthe questionnaire. In this case the person first answered thequestionnaire and I then interviewed this person, basing myquestions on the answers received from the questionnaire. In thelist of references the informants are consistently identified as Male/Female [letter], thus making it easier for the reader to check whichinformants were both interviewed and answered the questionnaire.The interviews were conducted in 2001-2002.I conducted 11 interviews with Dragon Rouge members, intotal. Eleven people were interviewed. Some of the interviews werecompleted with two or more interview subjects at a time, but mostof them were private occasions where only myself and the personbeing interviewed were present. Locations for the interviews werecafés, homes of the informant, the Dragon Rouge temple inStockholm and on one occasion, when the weather permitted, in apark outside the Dragon Rouge temple. I interviewed seven malemembers and four female members4.The interviews were conducted with members who attendedthe meetings and courses on a regular basis. All of them had beeninitiated into at least the first degree, and several were initiatedinto higher degrees. The majority of those interviewed were engagedin some official capacity, like holding courses, producing internalmaterial for the order, working with administrative tasks etc. Theexceptions to this are two female members (Female B and C in thelist of references), who were part of the women’s circle andparticipated actively in Dragon Rouge courses and meetings, and amale member (Male D), who only joined an interview at the veryend of it. Two of those interviewed are members who are responsiblefor the ideological formation of the order on the whole.The interviews were recorded onto MiniDisc or cassette and4 In addition I also interviewed an outsider to the order, mainly to studythe view of Dragon Rouge conveyed by media coverage. This interview ishowever not used in the present study."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONall of them where long and in-depth, about two hours per interviewoccasion. I also conducted follow-up interviews at later dates withthree of the persons interviewed earlier.Like all researchers who use technological aids when doinginterviews, I experienced a couple of instances when the technologyfailed during the interview. When this happened, I had to rely onmy memory of the interview, as well as double-checking my noteswith the informant/s in question.A possible objection to my interview material and to my choiceof informants could be that the material is not representative of theorder as a whole, as I have not interviewed less active members.However, I do not regard this as a problem. The choice of informantswas quite natural as these where the persons most deeply involvedin the order’s activities and organization and who thus knew mostabout the principles as well as the practical aspects of its work. Onthe philosophical issue, I chose to treat my informants as individualmembers stating their personal views and not as officials acting asspokespersons for the order. During the interviews, several of mykey informants, especially those long-time members who had amore prominent position in the order, pointed out that they werespeaking for themselves first and foremost, and not on behalf ofthe order as a whole. However, as these persons organize themajority of the order’s activities and write most of the official DragonRouge material, their views have a strong influence on othermembers. Where there is uniformity between the accounts of myinformants and the official material, the interview material can beseen as more than simply isolated expressions of individualstandpoints and views.As my research methodology is based on ethnographicfieldwork, interviews constituted an integral part of my research(see Agar 1980: 107-110; Fägerborg 1999: 55; Rautiainen 2003: 29;Granholm & Svanberg 2004: 82). The common type of interview infieldwork is a loosely structured interview where the interviewerand the interviewee discuss certain themes that the researcher deemsimportant in order to understand the field. The interview-situationis quite informal and both researcher and respondent or respondentsare as much on an equal level as possible. Of course the researcheralways has the upper hand as it is he/she who ultimately controls"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"43CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONthe situation. Interviews such as these can be called “informalethnographic interviews” (Agar 1980: 90) or “flexibly structuredinterviews” (Whyte 2001: 163). My method of interviewing wasmore structured than the stereotype fieldwork interview, althoughI still chose to keep a relatively loose structure. The concept ofTheme-interview (Teemahaastattelu), as presented by Helena Hurmeand Sirkka Hirsijärvi, gives a good characterization of my approachto interviewing. In theme-interviews, the researcher focuses oncertain themes he/she has identified as relevant for the researchbut the actual questions themselves are not conclusively createdbeforehand (Hurme & Hirsijärvi 2000: 47-48; see Rautiainen 2003:30). I have not transcribed my interviews, but have instead chosento simply write short summaries on content and context of eachinterview.In contemporary social sciences and the humanities, the peoplestudied are no longer viewed as passive parties in the researchprocess. The respondent is seen as a subject who actively takes partin the research process and the creation of new knowledge. This isespecially the case in interviews, in which the researcher is said tocreate his/her research material – in cooperation with theinterviewee (see Marander-Eklund 2000: 72; 2004: 93-95; Henriksson2004: 23-25). In the case of my interviews, the interviewees can tothe highest degree be called active collaborators and co-workers.As my interviews where loosely structured and my field of interestwas vast, the respondents where relatively free to steer theconversation in the direction they felt was important inunderstanding Dragon Rouge.When using excerpts from the interviews, I use a form oftranscription by which I try to keep the language as close to theoriginal taped interviews as possible, whilst still making the excerptsreadable. I have kept intact passages of inconsistent speech wherethe informant changes argumentative technique in mid sentence –something which always happens in interview situations as spokenlanguage is not the same thing as a written text. Shorter pauses inthe speech are marked by a comma (,) whereas longer pauses –signalling a new sentence are marked by a full stop (.). In situationswhere I have chosen to leave out passages irrelevant for the analysisthis is marked out by three full stops inside square brackets ([...])."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"44CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONPassages, shorter than one sentence, left out are marked by threefull stops (...). Emphases made by the informant are marked byunderlining the emphasized word or part of a word (Emphasize).When I have included my original question to the informant I havemarked this with square brackets, italics and with a question mark([Question?]). On the few occasions where two informants arepresent, I display the speech of one of the informants in bold font inorder to distinguish the two persons speaking (I Speak You spoke).When no commas or full stops are included between passages bythe two speakers, they have interrupted each other or continuedthe sentence started by the other informant present. The interviewswere mainly conducted in Swedish. I have translated them intoEnglish, and present the Swedish original text in a footnotefollowing the English translation. The interviews are archived inthe Folkloristic Archive at Åbo Akademi University.1.4.2 The QuestionnairesI started the gathering of my primary sources through sending andhanding out questionnaires to various Dragon Rouge members. Thequestionnaires where handed out to persons who were membersof the order and whom I met at Dragon Rouge meetings. Theinitiatory level, activity and official standing in the order variedamong the informants. I received answers from membersresponsible for the order’s ideological formation, as well as fromnew members not yet initiated. It is likely that the answers receivedwere from more active members, as these were more prone to takethe time to answer the questionnaire.In total, I received 13 answers to the questionnaires. This mayseem to be a fairly small number of answers but as I have aqualitative approach and have chosen to treat my informants asindividuals, representing themselves first and foremost and DragonRouge only secondly, I do not consider this to be a problem.Furthermore, the answers I have received are very extensive,ranging from three to over thirty A4 pages. Most of the answers are5-10 pages long. The majority of the answers received are from"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"45CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONSwedish members, but a couple are from members outside Sweden.One answer is from a German member and another is from a Finnishmember. There is a strong imbalance in gender of the respondentsas only three answers are from female members. This is somethingI cannot help. I handed out questionnaires to all Dragon Rougemembers I met, mostly during my fieldwork, and also sentquestionnaires to the different lodges and asked the lodge leadersto distribute them to the lodge members. I also posted a presentationof my study along with a request for Dragon Rouge members toparticipate in my research on the order’s internal web forum. As Ihaven’t had access to the Dragon Rouge members register I haven’tbeen able to contact members directly. Those members I receivedanswers from can be considered to be among the more activemembers of the order. I would probably have received more answersif my questionnaire had been a little less extensive. As the answersI have received are very informative, I am satisfied with the results.Besides getting responses from present members of the order Ialso received answers from two former members. One of them wasan Internet chat-room contact of a colleague of mine and, whenasked, she was quite willing to answer my questions. The otherformer member was actually still a member when I came into contactwith him. The whole situation was interesting as the person’smembership ended quite dramatically, followed by a heated disputeon a message board on the Internet.The questionnaire is not really standardised, as I changed thequestions over time, according to new information I received. I alsoformed the questions differently for certain members I knew moreabout, and from whom I thus did not need as much of the generalaccounts as from some other members. Basically, however, thequestions centred on the following themes:1) The informant’s personal background, including familybackground, upbringing, religious tradition in thefamily and events identified as formative by theinformant.2) The informant’s view on society and differentideologies in general, including views on religion,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"46CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONspirituality, politics, democracy, socialism,communism, liberalism, feminism, equality, homo/bisexuality, racism, Nazism, ecology andvegetarianism. I also asked the informant to define his/her religious orientation.3) Questions about Dragon Rouge as an organization,including the informants assessment of the number ofmembers, number of active members in the lodge/lodges he/she has experience of, gender balance, theposition of female members versus male members andthe informant’s view on the leadership of Dragon Rouge.4) The informant’s view on how the order has beenportrayed in the mass media. This question was initiallyimportant as I first intended to study how the negativemass media attention had affected the order (see section1.1 and Granholm 2001a).5) The informant’s view on different religions, worldviewsand life philosophies in relation to Dragon Rouge.6)The informant’s account of how he/she came into contactwith the order and of became a member.7) The informant’s account of his experiences in DragonRouge and in magic, including questions on whatparticular magical exercises the informant practices andthe informant’s view of his/her own competence as amagician.8) An explicit question on possible experienced resistanceto the informant’s membership in the order, as well asquestions on how the informant’s family and friends havereacted to his/her membership.9)The informant’s definition and exposition of what DragonRouge is and what magic is.The questionnaires were handed or sent out, and the answersreceived, in 2001-2002. The questions and answers are stored in theFolkloristic Archive at Åbo Akademi University."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"47CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION1.4.3 Fieldwork and Participant ObservationAs stated earlier, no detailed study on Dragon Rouge had beenpublished when I began my research. Therefore I had to get first-hand information on the order. In order to accomplish this I had todo fieldwork on Dragon Rouge. My main fieldwork was conductedin 2001 – 2002, with the more intensive and regular period in 2001.In 2001 I made eight visits to Sweden. On each occasion the triplasted from about a week to ten days. My field trips in 2002 whereequal in length but fewer in number. I also made some occasionalfield visits in 2003 and 2004.During my fieldwork I participated in several different andmore extended courses in magic practice, as well as attending oneor more regular weekly meetings on each field trip. I participatedin courses on astral projection, the Vril and Od-forces, ceremonialmagic, Left Hand Path Tantrism and deep Draconian magicworkings, to only mention a few. I was also present at the openingof Lodge Sinistra in Malmö, Sweden, in February, 2001, in whichleading magicians of the mother-organization in Stockholmparticipated. Dragon Rouge has arranged a number of open lecturesin which outside experts, mostly academics studying the subjectmatters, have been invited to speak about certain things pertainingto magic, mysticism or occultism in some form or another. The orderhas also held presentations of its practice and philosophy for non-members. I participated in activities of both types on a few occasions.Dragon Rouge in Stockholm organizes annual meetings eachsummer, in which members from the different lodges from aroundthe world take part, as far as is possible. I attended the annualmeetings of 2001, 2002 and 2004. The 2001 and 2002 meetings wereheld at the Dragon Rouge temple in Stockholm. The meetings of2003 and 2004 were held in a newly opened temple on Gotland, anisland situated southeast of Stockholm on which a great deal ofancient Norse cultic remains can be found. Future annual meetingswill most likely be held at the Gotland temple.Although most of my fieldwork was conducted in Stockholm,I also made a few trips to the lodges in Malmö, as mentioned earlier,and Gothenburg. On my trip to Gothenburg I was unfortunately"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONnot able to participate in any of the lodge activities or visit the templeof Lodge Helheim. However I interviewed and spent a considerablelength of time with some members of the lodge.During my fieldwork I conducted the interviews referred to insection 1.4.1, handed out and discussed the questionnaires discussedin section 1.4.2, and carried out in-depth participant observation. Ialso spent time with Dragon Rouge members in more informalsettings. According to Alan Bryman’s collected definitions, theprocess of ethnography includes participant observation and theresearcher ‘immersing him-/herself’ in a society in order to collectdescriptive facts about its culture. This is accomplished throughanalysis of the cultural symbols and meanings the members of theculture possess. In the end the researcher is able to produce a fieldreport in which he/she communicates the findings to other scholars,as well as to other interested readers in general. (Bryman 2001: ix-x; Granholm & Svanberg 2004: 74-75).In my case, the community under study was Dragon Rouge,and the participators in the culture studied, the members of theorder. According to Michael Agar (Agar 1980: 9) anthropologistshave often set out with an interest in the field itself, not with afoundation in theory, which is the way sociologists and the likeoperate as a rule. The field is also commonly approached in a veryopen and general way, without the anthropologist focusingexplicitly on specific aspects of it in the beginning. Thomas HyllandEriksen underscores the importance of narrowing down the fieldof interest before one goes out to the field, otherwise one ends up“knowing all to little about everything, instead of enough aboutsomething” (Eriksen 2000: 29-30).In my case, the narrowing down was of a different sort andeasily done, as I was not studying a whole society, but a group, andhad a specific focus on the worldview of the members of the group.In many ways, however, I functioned as the stereotypicalanthropologist described in the reference from Michael Agar above.Even though this approach has been a great asset to me and myknowledge of the field, there are also several drawbacks to this wayof proceeding. The time spent in the field tends to be a lot longerthan if one started out with a more specific interest, the mass ofmaterial tends to grow to gargantuan proportions and the research"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"49CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONprocess easily becomes time-consuming, expensive and exhausting.Not to mention the fact that sorting out the material after thefieldwork is finished and analysing it becomes a tremendous task.Pertaining to the narrowing down of the field, one has to rememberthat any study of social phenomena, anthropological research beingno exception, involves choices of points of focus. The researcherdecides what is interesting and relevant for the study, and, thus,what is to be dealt with in depth. Thus, the ethnographic account isnot an objective account of the factual situation concerning the groupor society, independent of the researcher who has done the study(see Suojanen 1996: 6-7; Eriksen 2000: 34-35). This is a reason whyself-positioning is of particular importance in fieldwork-basedresearch, and needs to be accounted for.In spite of all the problems concerning method, I am glad tohave carried out fieldwork in the way I did. I had the good fortuneto obtain research grants to cover the costs of my fieldwork and thetime spent in the field provided deeper insights, making it possiblefor me to analyse things in a thorough, reflected, well-groundedand competent way. On a personal note, I also enjoyed doingfieldwork and the field as such.Magnus Öhlander discusses three different levels ofobservation and participation in the context of participantobservation. These are: the researcher as a passive observer, theresearcher as simultaneously observing and participating, to variousdegrees of course, and the researcher as fully participating(Öhlander 1999; 74-77). Usually, most researchers doing participantobservation are simultaneously participating and observing. In myresearch I started out with more participating and less observing;this in order to gain knowledge of the experiences Dragon Rougemembers possibly had during the magic exercises, and thus gainingsomething of a common ground with them. In anthropologicalresearch this is commonly called to grasp “the Native’s point ofview”, and concerns experiencing the world as the informants do(see Geertz 1993: 55-70). It is often stated that this is impossible todo fully, as the anthropologist is always an outsider due to the natureof his profession (Eriksen 2000: 38-39). Would the researcher succeedin “going native”, totally becoming as his/her informants, theresearch would be seriously compromised (Stebbins & Shaffir 1991:"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"50CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION14). The researcher is able to do fieldwork because he/she is anoutsider involved in a process of investigation.As time progressed I leaned more and more towardsobservation, although still participating actively. On a course Iattended late in 2002 I decided to only passively observe, takingnotes and not participating at all in the exercises. As I see it, thisapproach had several benefits. If I had conducted my participantobservation in the opposite way I could easily have been considereda disturbing outsider, and the meetings could have been less relaxedand natural. The way I conducted my research made the otherparticipants accept my presence easier, and made me something ofa peer. On the occasion when I did not partake in the practice, mypresence was nothing peculiar and the other participants had noproblem with me observing them. I was no longer a stranger. Thepossible ethical problem with this approach is that the informantsmay basically ‘forget’ that the researcher is in fact doing research,and they may therefore divulge information that they would notnormally be comfortable in revealing to an outsider. I consider itthe responsibility of the researcher to be aware of this fact, and tothe highest possible degree avoid exploiting his/her informants.Michael Agar identifies the process of starting fieldwork asfivefold (Agar 1980: 21, 30-39). First you have to choose the field,and in the field you choose your informants. Having done this, youreview the existing literature that in some way pertains to theresearch at hand. Fourth, you identify your network into the fieldor, simply stated, your way of getting into the field and being ableto do research in it effectively. Finally you have to obtain some sortof project financing in order to be able to realize your fieldwork.For me all of this was fairly simple. I knew what my field of studywas: Dragon Rouge and its arenas of activity and ways of perceivingand communicating reality. The mother-organization, important assuch and relatively close geographically, was a given focusing point.Who my main informants were was a matter stipulated by my field.I had already reviewed the scarce amount of literature on theorder when writing my master’s thesis (see Granholm 2000). Andnow it was my intention to gain access to the field. This is usuallynot the easiest task. Many new ethnographers seem to take thisprocedure too lightly, and older more experienced ethnographers"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"51CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONdeal with it as if it was a simple and straightforward process (seeAgar 1980: 27-30; Burgess 1991: 43; Kaijser 1999: 29, 30-31).According to Agar, the researcher has to find his/her “network”into the field (Agar 1980: 27), meaning that one has to secure anaccess point to the field and not simply ‘appear on the scene readyto do some participant observation’. According to Robert G. Burgess“access [to the field] is negotiated and renegotiated throughout theresearch process” (Burgess 1991: 43).I started by sending my master’s thesis (Granholm 2000) to themother-organization in Stockholm, along with an accompanyingletter in which I expressed my wish to do a more thorough study ofDragon Rouge. The period I waited for some form of answer wasexcruciating, as I had contacted the order earlier when doing myM.A. research, and had not received any answer that time.Fortunately the thesis was accepted by the leading members of theorder and I was welcomed to do more in-depth research on DragonRouge. My master’s thesis became my key to the field and mynetwork in was formed by the leading magicians of Dragon Rougein Stockholm, who had read my thesis and decided to allow me toparticipate as a researcher. Burgess is right in assuming thatrelationships in the field highly influence the process of researchand the knowledge produced, and in stating that the question ofhow the researcher has gained access to the field is in no way aminor factor in this equation (Burgess 1991: 45, 45-52). My master’sthesis, and the picture of me as a serious researcher this piece ofresearch conveyed to the leading Dragon Rouge members, helpedpave the way. I was assigned the dual role of magic initiate andresearcher, as discussed in section 1.5, and this had an impact onthe way my fieldwork came to be conducted.Traditionally, field notes have been viewed as pivotal toanthropological research, even to the extent that the publishedresearch has often been characterized as the field notes re-writtenin a form acceptable for publishing (see Agar 1980: 111). Personally,however, I do not find the actual field notes to be quite thatimportant. If I had concentrated all my effort in taking notes I wouldhave missed a lot of what was going on (compare Öhlander 1999:83). I decided to do MiniDisc-recordings of the meetings and coursesattended, with the approval of those present naturally, and then"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"52CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONwrite short summaries of what had transpired, mainly focusing onmy reflections on the events I had experienced. I chose to view fieldnotes as a tool for analysis and interpretation, and not as the primaryobjective of fieldwork. The most important tool the researcher doingfieldwork has at his/her disposal is him-/herself (Fetterman 1991:92-93; Eriksen 2000: 27). The anthropologist does indeed constantlyfine-tune this main instrument, but there is always the problem ofrelying too heavily on its flawless operation. The instrument mustat all times work in synchronization with the agency of self-reflexivity, in order for the result to be the best possible.In all research, but especially in fieldwork where the researcheris in close contact to his/her informants, the question of researchethics comes to the fore. I could perhaps have gone into the field‘undercover’, not identifying myself as a researcher studyingDragon Rouge. Besides the obvious ethical dilemmas, however, thiswould have made my research less fruitful (Richardson 1991: 64-70; see Stebbins & Shaffir 1991: 2-3, 16-17). Doing open researchallowed me to approach the field in a completely different way,and gave me access to material that new members generally do notget to see. (see Granholm & Svanberg 2004: 80-82). As discussedearlier, ethical dilemmas might also occur in situations in whichthe field researcher has been on the field for such an extended periodthat the informants start to view the researcher as a complete peer,effectively forgetting about the researcher’s academic aims (Stebbins& Shaffir 1991: 16-17). Here I consider it the researcher’s obligationto conduct his/her research with moral integrity, so that he/shedoes not exploit his/her informants’ vulnerabilities, whilstsimultaneously remaining true to the research in progress (see Pripp1999: 45, 47-51; Kommittén om forskningsetik 1998: 35).1.4.4 The Official Dragon Rouge MaterialThe official Dragon Rouge material I have had access to comprises amajor part of my source material. The material is vast, and I have nothad the possibility to give all of it full attention. I have mainly focusedon the questionnaires, the interviews and the participant observation.The official Dragon Rouge material has provided points of reference,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"53CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONand served as context and as a perspective on the group as a whole,giving elucidation and support to the rest of the material.Nevertheless, certain portions of the official material have been moreimportant than others and have been referred to more extensively.These are the official website of the order (Dragon Rouge 2004a; 2004b;2004c; 2004d; 2004g), the two correspondence courses in magic that Ihad access to (Dragon Rouge 1996; 2001j) and the rules for starting amagic group or lodge in Dragon Rouge (Dragon Rouge 2001e).The rest of the material consists of the websites of the differentlodges (Dragon Rouge 2001c; 2001d; 2004h-s), the Dragon Rougemembers’ papers from 2000 to 20045 (Dragon Rouge 2000a-c; 2001f-i; 2002a-d; 2003a-d; 2004e-f), a welcoming letter to new members ofthe order (Dragon Rouge 2000d), the discussion board on the DragonRouge website available for members only (Dragon Rouge 2001b.In addition to this, I also accessed the members’ discussion boardafter 2001), as well as the public discussion board on the homepage,which has been unavailable for some time. I also got hold of severalmembers-only publications that Dragon Rouge keeps available for,or sells to, its members. These include texts on the Left Hand Path,esoteric runology and qliphotic qabalah (Karlsson 2002b; 2002c6),and several other subjects. The Dragon Rouge magic group in Italy,which became an official lodge in 2003, has published a ‘MagickalBulletin’ called ‘Fiat Nox’ since 2002. I have the first issue of thisbulletin (2002g). Besides the above mentioned material I have inmy possession several documents that in some way pertain to theofficial activities or philosophies represented by the order.I also chose to include books published by Dragon Rougemembers, and books where the subject matter relates closely to theorder, not necessarily being sanctioned, but certainly at leastapproved by Dragon Rouge as an organization. These are the worksUthark. Nightside of the Runes7 and Kabbala, kliffot och den goetiska5 I started receiving the member’s paper from issue 2/2000 onwards andhave hitherto received issues up 3-4/2004. All of the issues are in Swedish,except for issue 4/2001 which is in English.6 I have chosen to only include works by members who have publishedsomething also available to non-Dragon Rouge members.7 The book is also available in German from the publishing house ArunVerlag with the title Uthark: Im Schattenreich der Runen. Apparently, the book isa bestseller on the German Amazon online book dealer."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"54CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONmagin by the order’s founding member, Thomas Karlsson, Mörk Magiby Tommie Eriksson and Mörkrets stig by Christofer Johnsson(Karlsson 2002; 2004; Eriksson 2001; Johnsson 1996). ThomasKarlsson has also written the introduction to Tommie Eriksson’sbook (Karlsson 2001).I have referred explicitly to the official material mostly byrelating to the website of the mother-organization, thecorrespondence courses in magic and the rules governing thestarting of a magic group or lodge in Dragon Rouge. Nonetheless,the rest of the official material plays an important role. I wentthrough all of the material in my possession and my conclusionsdraw from all of it. The body of material is vast and cannot be treatedwith the same precision throughout.1.4.5 Other MaterialDuring my studies I have tried to collect as much material as possibleon aspects pertaining in some way to Dragon Rouge, either directlyor indirectly, or simply dealing with similar phenomena from aninsider’s point of view. Of course, my material is not exhaustive,but I was still able to collect a remarkable mass of text and variouskinds of documents. I shall briefly present some of the moreimportant pieces of material.I collected material which is related to Dragon Rouge, writtenby people positive to, but not necessarily members of, the orderand which is not officially sanctioned by Dragon Rouge. In thiscategory I have access to, amongst others, a few academicundergraduate papers on the order and various website-entrieswhich deal with the order, or with some aspects of the order’sactivities. Additionally, some members of the order are artists, andhave in this capacity published material representing magico-occultworldviews, and who have spoken of the subject in interviews andon similar occasions. In accordance with explicit requests by thepersons in question I have, however, chosen not to expose theseindividuals’ names or artistic projects. Furthermore, the abovematerial is not used very extensively, since I do not regard it to beas relevant as my primary sources."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"55CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONSecondly, there are a number of published non-academic workswhich deal with, or mention Dragon Rouge, in a quite polemicallycritical way. These include books by Håkan Arlebrand, Karl-ErikNylund as well as press or television material. These were discussedmore in detail in section 1.3.1 and, as stated there, when they concernDragon Rouge specifically, I chose to use this material as examplesof more subjective and critically polemic views on the order andmagic in general.The third category consists of material which does not treatDragon Rouge, but deals with similar subjects. Worth mentioningare the websites The Mutation Parlour: Chaos Magick (http://www.crossroads.wild.net.au/index.html) which provides extensivematerial on chaos magic and is maintained by people practicingthis form of the art, Paranormal.se (http://paranormal.se) which isa Swedish online encyclopaedia and resource for things occult, andTempli-Serpens (http://www.templi-serpens.com), which is aSatanist site but has lots of material on the Left Hand Path andqliphoth. There are many more websites worth mentioning but theseare the ones I found most helpful and relevant from a comparativeperspective.1.5 Self-positioningI am aware of critique of over-exerting one’s own person inethnographic writing, and I sympathize with this standpoint to someextent (see Sköldberg & Alvesson 1994: 322; Davies 1999: 15-16). It is ofno interest whatsoever to the reader that I was a huge fan of the animatedTransformers TV-series when I was a child, that I had a poster of the rockband W.A.S.P.’s Blackie Lawless and Chris Holmes accompaniedby a boa restrictor on my wall when I was seven years old, or that Ihave a close relationship with my younger brother. I do not,however, view self-positioning as irrelevant and simply as a meansof self-promotion, or an expression of narcissism, as some exponentsof the more radical critique tend to suggest. Self-reflectivity isneeded in all kinds of human efforts in understanding. It should beused to treat the things relevant for academic study, and is of great"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"56CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONimportance, especially in fieldwork-based research (see Davies 1999:3-4). I share Mikko Saastamoinen’s view that the aim of reflexivityis to bring the researcher and his/her informants to a more equallevel, to make explicit the human limitations and priorunderstandings of the researcher (Saastamoinen 2003: 21-22).I can identify several factors in my life-history, personality andrange of interests which made an order such as Dragon Rouge aninteresting object of study for me. Since I was a child I have alwayshad a deep interest in, and appreciation of, horror movies, especiallythose that deal with supernatural phenomena and dark forces, aswell as different popular works on the occult and on unidentifiedphenomena. Anything which includes vampires in any wayinstantly catches my attention. This interest is also evident in mypreferences for music, literature and aesthetics. I enjoy rock andheavy metal music where the artists employ dark horror moviesymbolism and include mythological elements in their lyrics. Thisinterest in the dark and unknown is probably what drove me tostudy comparative religion in the first place. My fascination for theoccult never resulted in efforts to explore it in any practical way.My attraction has always been on the fictional side and, only intheory. This exposition may seem trivial but it explains my initialinterest in Dragon Rouge as an object of study. When I came intocontact with the order through Liselotte Frisk’s book Nyreligiositet iSverige (Frisk 1998: 142-147), I was looking for a subject to treat inmy master’s thesis. In that situation Dragon Rouge immediatelyemerged as a suitable and interesting topic. In the pre-constructedpicture I had formed in my mind, the symbol-language, subjectmatter and activities of the order appealed to my preference forhorror movie aesthetics. Doing actual research gradually changedand deepened my view on Dragon Rouge and its members.In my late teens and early twenties I was an active participantin leftist animal rights, ecological and anti-racist subculturalmovements. My activism stretched from purely legal actions, suchas the organization of and participation in demonstrations and thedistribution of leaflets, to a few instances of civil disobedience. As Ilived in Ostrobothnia at the time, the capital of fur farming inScandinavia, my activities were not considered very agreeable. Iwas personally harassed a few times, and some of my friends, who"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"57CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONwere active in the same subculture, were openly threatened. Thewhole movement as such was harshly reprimanded in the pressand in public debate. My experiences from this period of my lifegreatly affected my view of the mass media. In the mid 1990s DragonRouge was the recipient of much negative mass media attention inSweden (see Nilsson 1995a; 1995b; Stuttgart 1995; 1996; SVT 1 1996).My negative experiences of mass media, as well as my earlierparticipation in a criticized subculture, led me to sympathize withDragon Rouge and to find a frame of identification.My subcultural connections and my advocation of ecologicalliving and animal rights provided a further element of mutualinterest with many Dragon Rouge members. Ecology is an importantaspect of the Dragon Rouge view of life, as I show in section 7.1.5.Most of the active members of the mother-organization in Stockholmare vegetarian for ecological, animal rights and magical reasons,all of which are usually linked in discourse on magic. I also sharemany of the views on ethics and morality of several Dragon Rougemembers I have talked to. This view on morality is in itself notsomething specific to Dragon Rouge, but rather a symptomaticaspect of late modern society (see Bauman 1997a; 1998).I consider myself a feminist, and this has most certainly hadsome impact on my research. For me feminism implies an ideologyand a utopia in which people are not seen solely as, or judged onthe basis of, sex or gender. Unfortunately, societal circumstancesbeing what they are, certain extra light must be shed on the situationof women in order to provide an unbiased position on gender, ironicas it may seem. As most feminist awakening stories tend to go, myfeminism was initially both unreflected and unconscious. This wasthe case when I started my doctoral studies. Having grown moreconscious in my feminist awareness, I have recognised how someof the questions I have asked my informants have sprung from thisproto-feministic state of mind. However, I do not consider this tobe too much of a problem as all researchers have the load of earlierexperiences, prejudices and prior understandings in their baggage.An effort should be made to identify this load and to reflect over itsinfluence on analysis and interpretation, in the endeavour toproduce as unbiased and as neutral an account as possible of thephenomenon studied."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"58CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONBecause of doing participant observation among Dragon Rougemembers and at Dragon Rouge meetings I have frequently beenasked how I can remain objective in my research. I respond byquoting Michael Agar’s words: “it is hard to ‘do science’ with peopleyou like; it is also hard to ’do science’ with people you do not like;if you do not care one way or the other, it is hard to ’do science’because you do not understand enough about the people you doscience with” (Agar 1980:18). In quoting this I aim to express thesentiment that personal relationships and emotional attachmentsof some sort are bound to develop in an environment of suchextended and close contact as participant observation represents.They are in fact more than bound to develop; they are a necessity inthis form of research (see Stebbins & Shaffir 1991: 4). If personalcontacts do not develop the researcher has most likely not involvedhim/herself enough in his/her area of research to get any resultsworth mentioning, or the researcher is socially incompetent andnot suitable for fieldwork amongst living people.I do regard many of my informants as friends and I sharemutual interests in music, arts and hobbies with several of them.During my fieldwork I also managed to get into one hostile situationinvolving myself and an informant, although this was an isolatedincident soon resolved. Such experiences of both kinship andalienation do not render me incapable of doing good research, quitethe opposite. Through experiencing my informants as real persons,and the whole field of research as a real arena of social interaction,instead of abstract phenomena and objects dislocated from my life,I have come to understand Dragon Rouge and its members better.This, I would say, is quite essential in any good research.Of course the relationships the researcher shares with his/herinformants affect the research being conducted, and raises issuesconcerning the validity of the study (see Stebbins & Shaffir 1991: 4,12-16). According to Stebbins and Shaffir three major problems maylimit the validity of the study. In my sentiment, interpersonalrelationships arising during research influence all of these. Firstly,and perhaps most noticeably stemming from interpersonal relations,are the reactive effects, that is to say the atypical reactions andresponses the informants have due to the presence of the researcher(Stebbins & Shaffir 1991: 13-14). Problems may also arise because"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"59CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONof the researcher’s responses in certain situations, or due to his/herfailure to respond. The researcher doing participant observationmust thus have good social skills and know how to be objectivewithout affecting the research in a negative way.The second and third types of problems discussed by Stebbinsand Shaffir stem from the researcher observing matters all tooselectively, as well as not being able to observe everything ofsignificance (Stebbins & Shaffir 1991: 13-16). The latter of the issuesis relevant when discussing social relationships during fieldwork.In short one could say that the roles assigned to the researcher bythe informants, and by the researcher him-/herself, greatly steerthe researcher’s access to different social situations. Gender,normally a factor which greatly influences the progress of fieldwork,did not pose a problem for me because of the nature of DragonRouge.I was assigned the dual role of magic initiate and researcher.This suited the questions I was looking to answer well, and offeredme as much mobility in the field as possible. Due to my role asresearcher I was given more attention than the average newcomer,although I still had to abide by the same rules as all members. Anexample of this is the fact that I was not allowed to access the secondcorrespondence course in magic before I had finished the first one,all in the nature of magic initiation.I am a member of the organization, mainly in order to access‘members only’ material. My informants are aware of this and Ihave also posted a message identifying myself as a researcherstudying Dragon Rouge on the Internet message board of the order.I am initiated into the second degree of the order (see section 5.1.4),again mainly to gain access to material which is only available forinitiated members, with the over-all aim of obtaining a deeperinsight into the order. I cannot however deny my personal interestin the forms, functions and workings of the order. I would not callmyself a magician, but the worldview and the people I have comeacross during my research represent something compelling to me.During my fieldwork, and in working with the initiation courses, Ihave performed the same magical exercises practiced by othermembers. I am intrigued by the practice and philosophy of the order,as would be expected of any good researcher doing this kind of"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"60CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONresearch in any spiritual movement. I have no intention of taking astand for or against the possible truth or falsity of the statementsmade by Dragon Rouge members and represented in the officialDragon Rouge material. I consider questions of this nature irrelevantfor the present study. In my fieldwork I have taken an open attitudeand regarded the stated experiences of the various members as truefrom a phenomenological view."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"61CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDPART II – Description2 Formative Background and Context of DragonRougeThe following chapter gives a brief summary of the history ofWestern esotericism, as an illustration of the background andcontext of Dragon Rouge. I start by giving a brief, and by necessitysimplified, account of esoteric currents from antiquity to the early20th century. Special focus is laid on the late 19th and early 20th centuryphenomena of the Theosophical Society, the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn and the mage Aleister Crowley. I will provide moredetailed accounts of the ‘New Age’ movement and neopaganism,including a discussion of their relation to each other. Lastly, I willendeavour to go into the specifics of the cultic milieu of Sweden ingeneral, and the Stockholm region in particular, in the late twentiethcentury. The aim of the chapter is to place Dragon Rouge in thecontext of the historical roots of esoteric thought and practice, andalso to point out possible sources of inspiration and influence.2.1 The Academic Study of Western EsotericismBefore discussing Western esotericism in any length, it is importantto remember that it is a scholarly construct, much in the same way‘religion’ is (Hanegraaff 1998c: 11; 2004: 489-490). As a scholarlyconstruct there are, of course, several different constructions ofesotericism (see Hanegraaff 1998c for examples). I will focus onWouter J. Hanegraaff’s and Antoine Faivre’s discussions on thesubject, as I feel that these are the most fruitful. It should also beremembered that there does not exist one coherent esoteric tradition,but rather that Western esotericism is a conglomerate of variousdifferent, and often quite distinct, traditions (Hanegraaff 2001: 13-16). For the sake of analysis, however, the approach ofWittgensteinian family-resemblances can be assumed.Antoine Faivre calls the Western esotericism of contemporary"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"62CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDresearch into the field “an ensemble of spiritual currents in modernand contemporary Western history which share a certain air defamille, as well as the form of thought which is its commondenominator” (Faivre 1998b: 2). Western esotericism sensu Faivrecan be seen as emerging during the renaissance, when the currents‘crossed paths’ and were fitted into this ‘common form of thought’(see Bogdan 2003b: 8; Hanegraaff 1996: 386-388; 2004: 493).Faivre further distinguishes between currents, correspondingto movements, schools or traditions (for example Hermetism,Christian Kabbalah and Rosicrucianism), and notions,corresponding to spiritual attitudes or practice (for example,Hermeticism and Gnosis). Some phenomena are both currents andnotions (as for example alchemy, astrology and magic). (Faivre1998b: 3-10).According to Faivre these spiritual currents and the mode ofthought can be recognized by four intrinsic and two secondarycharacteristics. These are:1) Correspondences. Meaning that there are invisiblelinkages between everything in existence.2) Living Nature. Existence is permeated by a living force,and nature may be seen as a manifestation of the livingGod.3) Imagination and meditations. Imagination andmeditation are used to access the divine spheres, whichare not directly accessible through the common sensesand reasoning. Hanegraaff names imagination an“organ of the soul” (Hanegraaff 1996: 398).4) Transmutation. The three former characteristics formthe foundation for the esotericist’s practice, in whichhe strives to transmute his/her soul into a moreperfected form.5) Concordance. A secondary characteristic. There is acommon basis, a true esoteric core, behind exotericreligious traditions.6) Transmission. Also a secondary characteristic. Esotericteachings must be transmitted from legitimated teacherto pupil. (Faivre 1994; 10-15; see also Hanegraaff 1996:397-400; Bogdan 2003b: 14-16)."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"63CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDWouter J. Hanegraaff criticises Faivre’s characteristics as being toostatic, they do not leave room for change and transformation ofesotericism. As he writes, Faivre’s schemata should not be taken asstipulative (see Hanegraaff 2004: 508). Hanegraaff also notes thatFaivre’s characteristics mainly refer to Christian traditions of acertain period, namely the renaissance (Hanegraaff 1998b: 46-47).He does, however, also point to the fact that Western esotericismwas deeply linked to Christianity a long way into the 18th century,and the emergence of non-Christian variants is due to the processof secularization, making way for alternative interpretations.(Hanegraaff 2004: 490).Hanegraaff demonstrates the inherent problems in Faivre’scharacteristic by the example of occultism, or secular esotericism(Hanegraaff 1996: 406-410, 421-442; 2003; 2004: 497-499; 508). Withthe emergence of a scientific materialistic imperative during theenlightenment, the esoteric idea of correspondences, as well as thatof a living nature to some degree, was difficult to uphold. The ideaof the microcosm corresponding to the macrocosm was more orless abandoned for a more mechanistic view, in which impersonalforces permeating everything could be manipulated for he desiredresults. Nature was generally not seen as a manifestation of a living,personal God anymore, but rather as an arena for theaforementioned invisible and causal forces. Thus, esotericism cameto terms with the modern worldview, and adapted to itsrequirements. Other formative elements of 19th century, and later,secular esotericism were the expansion of the scope of source-material to include oriental traditions, the emergence and esotericadoption of psychology, and, later, the “impact of capitalist marketeconomy on the domain of spirituality” (Hanegraaff 2004: 497-498).The concept of the transformation of traditional esotericism intooccultism should, however, not be taken to imply that all esotericismfrom the enlightenment onward has traded its idea ofcorrespondences for an instrumental causality-approach. Hanegraffgives the Eranos meetings, organized for the first time in Ascona,Switzerland, in 1933, as an example. The attendants, including theinfluential scholars Mircea Eliade, Gershom Scholem and CarlGustav Jung, had a more esoteric approach to spirituality than anoccult. The approach by Jung and Eliade, along with Julius Evola,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"64CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDcan be termed perennialist – in the sense that they sought similaritiesin religious phenomena in an ahistorical. The aforementionedpeople have become very influential in the alternative spiritualmilieu. (Hanegraaff 2001: 7-13; 2004: 501).Another critique of Faivre’s works is that his ‘definition’ cantoo easily be implemented in a futile effort to objectively anddefinitively mark something as esoteric or non-esoteric (Hanegraaff1998c: 45-46; 2004: 508). A further problem Hanegraaff sees inFaivre’s work is that it operates with something of an evolutionaryassumption; For Faivre esotericism per se emerged in the late 15thcentury, while there nevertheless existed some form of esotericismor pre-esotericism before that. A natural implication of this approachis that there must be a beginning or origin of esotericism and that itwould be productive to pursuit this line of research. (Hanegraaff1998c: 46-47).Both Faivre’s and Hanegraaff’s research is of importance forthe present study. While Faivre provides a useful base-theory ofesotericism, Hanegraaff expands on this to provide analysis on thetransformation of esotericism through time. The secularization ofesotericism, as presented by Hanegraaff, is clear in the tenets of theTheosophical Society, and even more so in the case of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. Combined withthis is the emergence of the orient as the principal source of newreligious ideas.2.1.1 The History of Western EsotericismThe present section is based on Antoine Faivre’s account of thehistory of Western esotericism, and thus it contains some of theproblems identified by Hanegraaff (see previous section). I do, forexample, aknowledge the problem defining esotericism as ahistorical phenomenon centred around the renaissance and still withcalling phenomena occurent before this period esoteric. I havechosen to do this nonetheless, as it is the most convenient solutionin the present context. ‘Pre-esoteric’ phenomena called esotericshould be understood as esoteric in their relation to esotericism."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"65CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDEarly sources of Western esotericism can be found in theMediterranean region in the first centuries C.E., especially focusingon the region around Alexandria. The Hermetica, a miscellaneousbody of texts dealing with natural philosophy, alchemy, astrologyand the likes, has had a huge impact on later esoteric thought (seeFaivre 1994: 51-110). The Corpus Hermeticum is a conglomerate ofhermetic texts by various authors, compiled during the 2nd and 3rdcenturies C.E. and later thought to have been the work of HermesTrismegistus – an imaginary contemporary of the Biblical Moses(Faivre 1994: 51). It became an important source of esotericknowledge during the Renaissance (Hanegraaff 2004: 493).Alchemy, which had been more of a mundane tool of goldsmiths,started increasingly to take the form of a revealed science from the2nd century B.C.E. onwards. (Faivre 1993: 3-7; 1994: 51-52; 1998: 112-114; van den Broek 1998: 5; Leijenhorst 1998: 128).Other early and important sources of Western esotericism wereNeopythagoreanism, which was at its peak during the two firstcenturies C.E., Stoicism, Neoplatonism, at its apex from about the3rd to the 5th centuries C.E., the Jewish qabalah, as well as Arabicesoteric influences, much of which were originally inspired byearlier Mediterranean sources. More Christian sources can be foundin Gnosticism and Manicheanism from the beginning of the firstmillennium. Characteristic to these was the highly dualistic notionof the constant conflict between the forces of good and evil. (Faivre1993: 1-3, 7-8, 22-25; 1994: 52-53; 1998: 110-113; van Oort 1998).The influence of Arab thought, which in its initial stages gavean impulse to reflection on esoteric subjects, can clearly be seen inthe west from the 12th century onward, and inspired a revival ofesoteric thought and practice. With the Muslim conquest of Spain,alchemy was introduced into Europe. Another key source ofWestern esotericism, the Jewish qabalah, also found its way intoWestern thought through the Muslim influence in Spain. Importantworks in the qabalah, Sepher ha Zohar – the Book of Splendour, andBahir – a compilation of qabalistic texts, had been conceived by theJews in Spain and found their way into European thought with the1492 exile of the Jews from Spain. Influential European thinkersworth mentioning are the mystic Hildegard af Bingen (1099-1180)and the visionaries of the Oxford school, such as Robert Grosseteste"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"66CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDand Robert Bacon, who dealt with astrology and alchemy (Faivre1993: 22-26; 1994: 53-56, 59; 1998: 112).The Renaissance is generally seen as the period when Westernesotericism, as understood by contemporary scholars, emerged, inthe syncretistic combination of different esoteric practices and ideas(see Bogdan 2003b: 8). The Corpus Hermeticum was rediscoveredand translated into Latin in 1471 by Marsilio Ficino and was thesubject of much interest especially in the following two centuries.The Jewish qabalah was issued in Christian versions in the worksof Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) and HenricusCornelius Agrippa (1486-1535). Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia,published in 1533 but written sometime after 1510, combined theideas of qabalah, magic, hermetism and alchemy. A later work,Cabala Denudata, written by Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-1689) in1677/1684, contained translated segments of the Zohar. (Masters1993: 140-145; Faivre 1994: 58-67; 1998: 112-115).A key concept of the esotericism of the Renaissance wasPhilosophia Perennis. Much effort was put into the search for, andconstruction of, a unifying and ancient origin and idea in thedifferent esoteric teachings and philosophies (Faivre 1998: 114-115).The source most often traced as the ultimate origin of the ‘eternalphilosophy’ was Hermes Trismegistus, who was thought of as thecreator of the Corpus Hermeticum, as mentioned earlier. Long-livednotions in the history of Western esotericism were stipulated byParacelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541)and Jacob Böhme (1575-1624). (Versluis 1998: 218; Schipperges 1993:154-155, 167-168; Deghaye 1993). Paracelsus broke with earlier,neoplatonic and qabalistic, notions of nature as distant from thedivine and viewed nature as directly emanated from the Godhead.Böhme identified Will, a determining concept of contemporarymagic, as the reason for being. He also spoke of a primordialexistence in freedom, an ungrund, before being, as well as a sort ofimmanent divinity. (Faivre 1994: 58-70; 1998: 115).The dawning of esoteric initiatory movements occurred withthree short pieces of fictional writing, the three proto-Rosicruciantexts as defined by Antoine Faivre. The texts, Fama Fraternitatis,Confessio Fraternitatis and Chymische Hochzeit Christiani RosencreutzAnno 1459, dealing with a secret initiatory society founded by an"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"67CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDimaginary and legendary Christian Rosencreutz, were publishedbetween 1614 and 1616. Tobias Hess and Johann Valentin Andreaeare generally considered to be the originators of at least two of thetexts. The imaginary Rosicrucian order spawned countless actualRosicrucian orders, most of which argued for a lineage to the orderof Christian Rosencreutz. The order of Freemasons, amongst others,is the outcome of the Rosicrucian eruption. (Faivre 1994: 64-66; 1998:115-116; Edighoffer 1993: 186-202; 1998: 197).All of the abovementioned Renaissance currents are generallyidentified as Philosophia Occulta, where the common denominatoris the idea of correspondences and analogical relations betweeneverything. Magia naturalis influenced a great deal of the thoughtof the time, especially in its more inclusive form. In this form, whichsaw analogies in nature without incorporating the divinity in it,Magia naturalis has been seen as a sort of predecessor to modernnatural scientific thinking. In the other, more esoteric, form, Magianaturalis was about uniting nature and religion. (Faivre 1994: 66-68; 1998: 113-115).The year 1717 saw the birth of modern Freemasonry in London,England. Although Freemasonry as we know it has thrived inBritain, the more esoteric forms of the craft were mainly conceivedin mainland Europe from the 1730s onward. Freemasonrydeveloped from a system with two initial degrees to include a thirddegree around 1730. In mainland Europe, higher degrees soonentered the stage, and different Masonic orders competed for thestatus of having the Masonic secrets. In addition to this, the boomin Egyptology started to influence esotericism, also bringing itsinfluence to Masonic societies. Societies which sought their roots inancient Egypt, instead of in the legend of Christian Rosencreutz,were formed. Esoteric Egyptianism also influenced the arts, as inthe case of Mozart’s opera, Die Zauberflöte [The Magic Flute](Godwin 1998: 189). (Mazet 1993: 257-260, 266; Faivre 1993: 51; 1994:71-74, 78-19; Bogdan 2003b: 131, 139).A hugely influential esotericist of the Enlightenment period isthe Swede Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). Swedenborg’s esotericcarrier started in 1745 when, as the result of a dream, he began towrite his Arcana Coelestia (published 1747/1758). He attempted tocreate a sort of map, or systematic description, of the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"68CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDworlds. Another influential work was The Magus by Frances Bacon,published in 1801. It was about at the same time that the Tarot deckcame to be used for divinatory and other esoteric purposes, althoughnot all scholars agree on this subject (see Gudmundsson 2001: 30-31). (Faivre 1994: 72, 75).Chemistry had advanced to the stage of being a ‘real science’,and thus the meaning and use of alchemy came to take on differentconnotations. Faivre differentiates between operative alchemy, inwhich the main goal was – or was thought to be – the manufacturingof gold, and spiritual alchemy, in which the goal was the spiritualtransmutation of the alchemist. Operative alchemy quite naturallybecame less and less popular, while spiritual alchemy continued toflourish. (Voss 1998). The new invention of the time was animalmagnetism. Franz Anton Mesmer, who had earned his doctorate inmedicine in 1766, developed a theory of an invisible fluidpermeating everything. This fluid was the organ through whicheverything was interconnected, and through its mediating effectone could thus influence everything else. Settling in Paris in 1778,he developed a practice in which he, through the use of a specialmachine and healthy people, could heal sick patients. Mesmer’sanimal magnetism was later, in 1783, put into an initiatory systemin the Society of Harmony, which bore many similarities toFreemasonry. The teachings of Mesmer, as well as those ofSwedenborg, were the forerunners of spiritualism and spiritism,which have more clearly expressed belief systems (Arlebrand 1995:74-75; Hammer 1999: 60-63). (Faivre 1994: 75-76).The example of Mesmer clearly shows the consequences theenlightenment ideals had on esoteric thought, the emergence of whathe calls occultism or secular esotericism. Mesmer’s ‘AnimalMagentism’ is presented as a purely scientific factor, and noreference is made to any divine realm or an immanent God.(Hanegraaff 1996: 424-435). What Mesmer perceived as the ultimatecause of the phenomenon was not the divine plan or purpose ofGod, but the fully impersonal aspects of natural law. Consequently‘Animal Magnetism’ was approach in a different matter than wouldhave been the case in a renaissance, traditional esoteric, setting.The novel concept of Romanticism (1790-1815) was that of aNaturphilosophie, which was basically a new approach to"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"69CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDinvestigating nature. Christianity began to lose its total dominancefor the esotericists, and the focus on nature came as a response tothis, and vice versa. (Hanegraaff 1998: 256-258). Antoine Faivredescribes the essential characteristics of the romanticistnaturphilosophie as follows (Faivre 1994: 82-83):1) Nature is filled with symbolic significances which whendeciphered point to causes and factors outside nature.2) The effort is made to grasp nature in its plural totality,not in disconnected parts.3) Spirit and Nature are not separated, but rather stemfrom the sameultimate origin. Consequentlyknowledge of nature is knowledge of oneself.The idea of a Philosophia Perennis, of such importance during theRenaissance, acquired new meaning in Romanticism. The worldhad grown smaller. No longer did it suffice to only include traditionsof Mediterranean origin in the eternal philosophy. Especially Indiaand its traditions stimulated the Western imagination, but here thepath to a global universalism was set. The seed of neopaganismwas also sown, as ancient druidism was treated as the originalreligion of humanity. (Hanegraaff 1993: 377; Faivre 1994: 86-87).Modern magic appeared on the scene in and through the worksof Papus (Dr Gèrard Encause, 1865-1915) and Eliphas Lévi(Alphonse-Louise Constant, 1810-1875). Especially the works ofLévi, Dogme et ritual de Haute magie from 1854-1856, Historie de lamagie from 1860 and La Clef des Grands Mystères from 1861 havebeen influential for later magicians. (Faivre 1994: 87-90).Esoteric runology has played an important part in the Nordiccontext since the early seventeenth century. The academic study ofrunes was from the very beginning linked to the esoteric study andpractice of rune magic. In 1599 the first serious work on the runes,Johannes Bureus’ (1568-1652) Runokenslanes lärospan, was publishedin Sweden. Bureus was successful in deciphering the runes and wasof the opinion, as were many important Swedish officials of thetime, that the runic characters should be taught in school. Inaccordance with the time, Bureus practiced the occult sciencesranging from alchemy to Neoplatonism, with a special and long-lasting interest in qabalah. It was however in esoteric runology,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"70CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDand the concept of Adulruna, that he found his true calling. Adulruna,the concept of which found its ultimate treatment in the workAdulruna, published in 1640, was the esoteric use of the runes.Bureus coupled the runic characters to the qabalah and created asort of Scandinavian version of the latter. (Andersson 1997: 96, 99-102).Another influential Swedish runologist is Sigurd Agrell (1881-1937). Agrell was an active academic at the University of Lund,Sweden, having first been appointed senior lecturer of Slaviclanguages in 1909, and later professor of the same discipline in 1921.Having been appointed professor he switched interests from Slaviclanguages to the world of runes, and especially rune magic. In hisnumerological speculations concerning the rune alphabet, theFuthark – named after the sounds of the first six runes, Agrell hadan esoteric enlightenment. He concluded that the Futhark shouldactually be an Uthark, as the first letter in the traditional runealphabet was actually a decoy planted by rune-magicians. With theUthark Agrell was able to fit in the runes much more smoothly withnumerological correspondences. The Uthark is popular amongstcontemporary rune magicians and shamanic neopagans (seeGrimsson 1990: 80-82; Hedlund & Gejel 1988; Karlsson 2002: 27-44). (Andersson 1997: 209-210, 240-246).2.1.2 The Theosophical SocietyThe Theosophical Society was founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky(1831-1891), Henry Steel Olcott (1832-1907) and William Quan Judge (1851-1896), in New York in September, 1875. The society is considered tobe the first new religious movement of the first wave, and hasundoubtedly inspired much of the later alternative spiritual scene(Ahlbäck 1995: 12; see Hammer 2001: 81-82). From the very outsetthe society was to be a non-initiatory and non-dogmatic nodal pointfor people interested in spirituality, although research shows thatthere were aspirations to form a Masonic order out of the society(Johnson 1994: 5). The goal of the Theosophical Society was statedas threefold:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"71CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND1) to form the core of an universal brotherhood of man,independent of faith, race, gender or social position2) to encourage the study of all religions, philosophy andscience3) to study the laws of Nature and the psychic andspiritual powers of man (Faivre 1994: 92; Arlebrand1995: 145).Spiritism, as well as the more religious Spiritualism born out of it(see Faivre 1994: 87; Arlebrand 1995: 74-79), were very much thespiritual trends of the time and when the society was formed a stance inopposition to them was taken. Madame Blavatsky had herself earlier beena spiritist medium and this was probably another reason for thestand-point taken. At the first meeting of the society Olcott, whowas elected president, expressed the blatant deceptions of manyspiritist mediums as the reason for the newly founded organizationdistancing itself from it (see Ahlbäck 1995: 13). The TheosophicalSociety itself, however, would come to employ trickery in appealingto would-be members very soon afterwards. The movement seemedto be a failure as member after member left the society and newones were hard to recruit. Blavatsky started to ‘entertain’ theparticipants through typically spiritist means, such as bymaterializing objects mysteriously and causing bells to ring as ifrung by invisible forces. The order was a success, and these kindsof tricks came to be utilized throughout Blavatsky’s activeparticipation in the society. (Ahlbäck 1995: 13-15).Blavatsky’s first work, Isis Unveiled (1877), was to a high degreeinfluenced by Gnostic and qabalistic sources, and described thehuman being as partly a divine spark and partly as body and reason.Not that much difference to earlier esoteric traditions thus far. Thereal innovation came with the movement of the centre of the societyto India in 1878. Blavatsky and Olcott became deeply influencedby, and involved in, Indian religiosity and incorporated much of itin the teachings of the society, to the extent that Faivre calls themovement “largely an offshoot of Oriental spiritualities, especiallyHindu” (Faivre 1994: 92). This served the renewed interest insearching for the Philosophia Perennis well, and probably explainsthe massive interest the Theosophical Society awoke and the huge"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"72CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDimpact it came to have on the esoteric milieu. The adaptation ofIndian spiritual themes is clearly seen in the differences betweenIsis Unveiled and Blavatsky’s later work, The Secret Doctrine (1888).In this latter piece of writing the principles of reincarnation andkarma are incorporated into the teachings. (Ahlbäck 1995: 13-19).Blavatsky’s interesting personality and charismatic leadershipwas behind much of the success of the society. With Blavatskyleaving India in 1885 after being exposed as a spiritual charlatan byRichard Hodgson of the Society for Psychical Research, and with herdeath in 1891, the society came to experience times of trouble anddecline. Judge, who had stayed behind when Olcott and Blavatskyhad travelled to the Orient, tried to take over the society afterBlavatsky’s death. This in turn led to a splintering of the societyinto two distinct groups, the Judge-led group in the United Statesand the group led by Olcott in Adyar, India. The American societyfinally settled on a headquarters in Pasadena, California. (Campbell1980: 103-111). The third major theosophical group, the UnitedLodge of Theosophists, was formed by Robert Crosbie in 1909 as areaction to the conflicts between the American and the Adyartheosophists (Campbell 1980: 143).After Olcott’s death the charismatic Annie Besant (1847-1933),and her controversial co-leader Charles Webster Leadbeater (1847/1854-1934), were successful in keeping the public interested in theSociety and also revitalized it in many ways. Especially Leadbeateris attributed as an important figure introducing concepts, such asthe Chakras and the Kundalini, from the Indian spiritual scene toWestern audiences (Arlebrand 1995: 58-59; Hammer 2001: 62).In 1909/1910 Besant and Leadbeater identified a young Indianboy, Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986), as the new ‘world-teacher’,or Messiah, and this kept members interested. With Krishnamurtirelinquishing the title in 1929, however, the days of the TheosophicalSociety’s greatness were over. (Ahlbäck 1995: 12-20; Faivre 1994:92-93). The society does, however, still exist today, although withless members than in the movement’s heyday. The most importantcontemporary fractions are, arranged according to number ofmembers, the Theosophical Society (Adyar), the TheosophicalSociety - International Headquarters at Point Loma, and the UnitedLodge of Theosophy (ULT)."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"73CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDThe Theosophical Society spawned many interesting andinfluential individuals in the esoteric scene of the late 1800s andearly 1900s. Jiddu Krishnamurti, mentioned above, gathered a hugefollowing when he moved to California after denouncing hisMessiah-role (Hammer 1997: 69-70), and became an even moreinfluential spiritual teacher. Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), who hadbeen appointed General Secretary of the German section of thesociety in 1902, and constantly researched different esoterictraditions – supposedly even founding a branch of the ritual magicalorder Ordo Templi Orientis called Mystica Aeterna, left theTheosophical Society in opposition to installing Krishnamurti asthe new Messiah. Steiner founded the Anthroposophical Society in1912/1913, and took with him about 2500 of the GermanTheosophists. Steiner’s, and by extension the Theosophical Society’s,influence extends farther than merely to esoteric movements. Thiscan be seen in the popularity of, for example, Waldorf-pedagogyand Bio-Dynamic cultivation.The last influential individual springing out of the TheosophicalSociety that I will mention is Alice Bailey (Alice LaTrobe Bateman,1880-1949). Bailey joined the society around 1910, but was expelledin 1920 when she began to receive messages from the Masters, andthus came into conflict with Annie Besant. Bailey started the ArcaneSchool in 1923, and wrote extensively on esoteric subjects. She iswidely referred to in ‘New Age’ spirituality. (Faivre 1994: 89-90;Arlebrand 1995: 147-148, 153-157, 167; Hammer 1997: 39-40; 2001:62-66).Simply stated, the doctrine of the Theosophical Society revolvesaround the idea of a secret core of universal truth as the basis of allreligions. This Secret Doctrine is passed on by the Mahatmas, theMasters of the Great White Brotherhood, who, according toLeadbeater, lived in the mythical city of Shamballa in the Himalayas.Important Theosophical leaders, such as Blavatsky and Besant, werein direct contact with these masters and could, in turn, pass on thissecret knowledge to the rest of the society. The origin of all is aneternal and infinite prime foundation, impossible for us to fathomor describe with our limited human resources, and everything hasemanated from this. Since all things, matter as well as spirit, are ofthis prime foundation, the divine spark is imbedded in all things."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"74CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDEverything in existence is “impregnated with Consciousness” (TS-Adyar 2004), meaning that everything has a purpose and a direction.Theosophy operates with a cyclical view of time, in which theworld goes through creation, evolution and destruction, just likeman himself. Man evolves spiritually, through reincarnation andthe law of karma. The universal cycle goes through sevenincarnations, and man is divided into seven root-races, with sevenunder-races in each. The first root-race was purely spiritual, withouta material body, but each succeeding root-race becomes more andmore material. With the Arian root-race, which is the current one,man begins anew to be more spiritual. After the final under-race inthe seventh root-race, the life-principle is withdrawn from the worldand another universal cycle starts.Man has seven bodies, from the material body through theastral body, the life principle and the animal soul, to the morespiritual souls of Manas, Buddhi and Atman. This is a concept basedon Paracelsus’ writings (see Ahlbäck 1995: 30). At death, the materialbody decomposes and the lower souls start to disintegrate moreslowly, while the higher souls are purified and spend a time of restand reflection in heaven before reincarnating in a new material body.(Ahlbäck 1995: 30-31; Arlebrand 1995: 149-152; Hammer 1997: 40-44; TS-Adyar 2004).2.1.3 The Hermetic Order of the Golden DawnThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a highly influential magicorder functioning as a model for many later magical orders, wasfounded on February 12th, 1888. The order was formed by WilliamWynn Westcott (1848-1925), who invited Samuel Liddell Mathers (1854-1918) and William Robert Woodman (1828-1891) to join him in itsleadership (Kaczynski 2002: 47). The inspiration for forming theorder came when Westcott received an esoteric manuscript writtenin cipher from Reverend A.F.A. Woodford, on August 8th, 1887(Owen 2004: 53).According to Richard Kaczynski, Westcott found themanuscript in the archives of Societas Rosicruciana in Anglica, of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"75CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDwhich he had been a member since 1880 (Kaczynski 2002: 47). Thetext was probably written by Kenneth Mackenzie, a leading Masonicfigure who had died the year before (Bogdan 2003b: 175-176).Westcott, who was familiar with the type of cipher the text waswritten in, deciphered it and was aided by Mathers in putting itdown on paper in comprehensible form. (Howe 1972: 1-27; Bogdan2003b: 174-175; Golden Dawn 2004a; 2004b; 2004c).Part of the Golden Dawn founding legend is that the cipheredmanuscript contained information on a Fräulein Anna Sprengel,who was supposedly a member of a German Golden Dawn (Owen2004: 54-55). Westcott contacted her, and was given the right to opena Temple of the Golden Dawn in London, with Mathers andWoodman as his co-leaders. The correspondence with FräuleinSprengel, chiefly a rhetorical means to give an aura of authenticityto the order, in a time when tradition and legitimate succession inesoteric societies was of great importance, was later disputed byMathers and eventually led to the closing of the order. Mathers,Westcott and Woodman were all Freemasons, as well as membersof the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, founded in 1866, and foundedthe Golden Dawn due to the impossibility of studying certainaspects of esoteric traditions in S.R.I.A. There was muchinterconnection between esoteric movements of the time, as is thecase today, and at least Westcott and Mathers were members of theTheosophical Society. (Howe 1972: 1-27; Bogdan 2003b: 174-175;Kaczynski 2002: 47-48; Golden Dawn 2004a; 2004b; 2004c).On March 1st,, 1888, the Isis-Urania Temple No. 3 was officiallyopened and within a year the order had attracted about sixtymembers. Temples elsewhere in Britain and beyond were soon tofollow, such as the Osiris Temple in Weston-super-Mare, the HorusTemple in Bradford, the Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh and theAhathoor Temple in Paris. At the peak of its success, in 1896, theorder had initiated 315 members.In the 1890s Mathers had become the sole chief of the order,with the death of Woodman and with Mathers outmanoeuvringWestcott. It was, in fact, Mathers’ aspiration to become the sole chiefof the order, downplaying the importance Westcott had had infounding the Golden Dawn, which led to its decline. Since Mathershad lived in Paris, France, since 1892, running the London based"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"76CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDorder was a bit difficult. When rebellious sentiments arose inLondon, Mathers demanded an oath of loyalty of all members. Thosewho refused were expelled, and this, of course, only fuelled therebellious sentiments. (Howe 1972: 34-60, 92, 219-232; Bogdan 2003b:176-179; Kaczynski 2002: 47-49; Owen 2004: 62).With the resignation of his representative as the head of theIsis-Urania Temple, Florence Farr, Mathers feared a coup by Westcott.He sent a letter to her, in which he stated that Westcott had neverbeen in any contact with the alleged Secret Leaders of the order. Hethus indirectly, and most certainly inadvertently, confessed to thefraudulent basis of the order. Westcott could, of course, not defendhimself properly. Mathers tried to exert his power and end theinvestigation into the case; he was unsuccessful. (Kaczynski 2002:47-68; Owen 2004: 78-79).Aleister Crowley, recently initiated into the inner order byMathers himself, was in London refused recognition of his initiation.He thus informed Mathers that he was willing to help him. Crowleyand Mathers devised a plan in which Crowley would confront themembers of the second order, masked in order to conceal hisidentity, and request them to plead loyalty to the order. The planwas ultimately a failure, and Mathers lost what little authority hehad left. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn declined severelyafter the events in 1900. In 1903 Arthur Edward Waite laid claim tothe Isis-Urania Temple, and its teachings and practices were altered.The original order changed its name to Stella Matutina, and operatedfrom the new Amoun Temple. The head of the Amen-Ra Temple, J.W.Brodie-Innes, assumed control over the British Branches of MathersAlpha and Omega order. Today there exist several orders which layclaim to being true representatives of the original Golden Dawn.(Howe 1972: 34-60, 92, 219-232; Bogdan 2003b: 176-179; Kaczynski2002: 47-68; Owen 2004: 80-83).Novel to the Golden Dawn, according to Henrik Bogdan, wasthe highly deliberate syncretistic approach to the study ofesotericism, and the orderly fashion in which it was executed. Theinitiatory structure of the Golden Dawn was based on the qabalistictree of life, and each initiation was on a hierarchical plane onsubsequent sephiroth on the tree. The initiatory structure of GoldenDawn was as follows:"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"77CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND•Neophyte, 0°=0° which was a introductory initiationadmitting a person into the order•Zelator 1°=10°, the first real initiation andcorresponding to the sephira of Malkuth•Theoreticus 2°=9°, the second degree andcorresponding to the sephira of Yesod•Practicus 3°=8°, the third degree and correspondingto the sephira of Hod•Philosophus 4°=7°, the fourth degree andcorresponding to the sephira of Netzach•Adeptus Minor 5°=6, the fifth degree, correspondingto the sephira of Tipareth and the first degree of theSecond Order•Adeptus Major 6°=5°, the sixth degree andcorresponding to the sephira of Geburah•Adeptus Exemptus 7°=4°, the seventh degree andcorresponding to the sephira of Chesed•Magister Templi 8°=3°, the eight degree,corresponding to the sephira of Binah and the firstdegree of the Third Order•Magus 9°=2°, the ninth degree and corresponding tothe sephira of Chokmah•Ipsissimus 10°=1°, the tenth and final degree,corresponding to the sephira of Kether. (Bogdan 2003b:169-171).Also innovative was the order’s acceptance of female members,which cannot be said to be the case for other initiatory orders of thetime. In fact, over one-third of the order’s members where femaleat the eighth year of its existence, and during its first years morefemale members were initiated than male. Female members alsoheld high ranks in the order, both in an organizational and initiatorycapacity. (Owen 2004: 62-65).Prior to 1892, the order had focused on theoretical study ofesotericism, but with the creation of an inner order this came tochange. In the inner order, the existence of which was held secret tomembers of the outer order, the focus was on practice, althoughnot neglecting the theoretical study. The inner order was much more"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"78CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDRosicrucian-inspired. (Howe 1972: 75-77). Female members alsoheld high ranks in the order, both in an organizational and initiatorycapacity. (Owen 2004: 62-65).With the initiation into the grade of Adeptus Minor the adeptwas initiated into the Second Order. The degrees of the Third Orderwere viewed as fundamentally unattainable for normal humans(Owen 2004: 58). Crowley’s Argentium Astrum (see section 2.1.4)was subsequently devised as the Third Order of the Golden Dawn(Kaczynski 2002: 138-139).(Howe 1972: 75-77; Bogdan 2003b: 177).Besides novel ideas and approaches to the practical study ofmagic and an influential model for future magic orders, theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn also spawned severalculturally and spiritually very influential individuals. Among themembers of the order were, only to mention a few, the poet WilliamButler Yeats (1865-1939), Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), AllanBennett (1872-1923), Florence Farr (1860-1917), Annie Horniman(1860-1937) and Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942). Dion Fortune(Violet Mary Firth, 1891-1946) was member of a Golden Dawntemple active after the tumult around 1900. (Lewis 1999: 138-142).2.1.4 Aleister CrowleyAleister Crowley (1875-1947) was without doubt one of the most, ifnot the most, influential occultists of the 20th century. His influencecan be seen in his direct affiliation with magic orders such as theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis,and in magico-religions started by him, such as Argentum Astrum(A:. A:.) and Thelema. He has also had a huge impact on the originof neopaganism and has been called the forefather of contemporarySatanism (see Arlebrand 1995: 129; Rodenborg 1998, on thissentiment), although Crowley distanced himself from Satanism andblack magic (see Kaczynski 2002: 460).Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley onOctober 8th, 1875, at Leamington spa, England. His father Edward(1834-1887) had made himself a fortune in the family brewerybusiness, and had, after retiring at age 26, devoted his life to religion.Well before the birth of his son, he had converted to the Plymouth"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"79CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDBrethren, a Christian movement, founded around 1830, whichconsidered itself as the only true Christian congregation andadhered to a literal interpretation of the Bible. During his youthEdward Alexander was a devout Christian, idolizing his father andreading the Bible conscientiously. This changed when his fatherdied in 1887, as the grief coupled with his mothers (Emily, maidenname Bishop) increasing religious zeal made him distance himselffrom religion. His up until now happy childhood was renderedunhappy, as his increasing bad behaviour got him into trouble inthe Christian schools he studied at. At about age 15, EdwardAlexander discovered the sins of tobacco, alcohol and sex. At age20, he was enrolled at the Trinity College, and received hisinheritance of £ 50.000 since he had come of age. At the same timehe changed his name to Aleister, a Gaelic rendering of his middlename Alexander. By the early 1910s Crowley had spent most of hiswealth on the publication of his poetry and other books, as well ason his mountaineering enterprises (see Kaczynski 2002: 222-223).(Kaczynski 2002: 13-30).Having given up on Christianity Crowley bought A.E. Waite’sThe Book of Black Magic and Pacts in 1898, thinking that the alternativecould be found in the opposite to his childhood religion. Althoughnot being what he expected, he was taken with the book and founda new form of spirituality in its pages. At about this same timeCrowley’s poetry, which he had begun to produce in 1886, beganto take on a more sexualized language. In August, 1898, Crowleymet and befriended Julian L. Baker through their mutual interest inmountain-climbing, and was later that year introduced to GeorgeCecil Jones by Baker. Baker and Jones were both alchemists (andchemists), and introduced Crowley to The Book of the Sacred Magicof Abra-Melin the Mage, translated by Samuel Liddell Mathers. Bakerand Jones were also members of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, and they invited Crowley to join. He did so in October 1898.Alan Bennett, an eccentric but accomplished magician, becameCrowley’s tutor in exchange for room and board. With Bennett’stuition Crowley advanced rapidly through the different grades,taking the outer Zelator to Philosophus degrees between December,1898, and May, 1899. Late in 1899 he applied for admission into theinner order of the Golden Dawn, and was refused entry. Crowley"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"80CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDtravelled to Paris and sought out Mathers, whom he had befriendedthrough Bennett. Mathers initiated Crowley into the inner order inJanuary, 1900. Mathers had an ulterior motive for initiating Crowley.Mathers had begun to lose his grip on the order, and the initiationwas also an over-ruling of the decision made by the order in London.His use of Crowley in an attempt to secure his authority within theorder did not bode well, as noted in section 2.1.3 (see Lewis 1999:141; Booth 2000: 3-4, 15-16, 93-95, 117-124; Symonds & Grant 1979:14, 35, 53, 176-178). (Kaczynski 2002: 40-67).Crowley left England to travel the world, experiencing boththe New World and the Orient. In USA, Crowley experimented withindividual magic practice and developed a system of self-practiceand self-initiation, doubtlessly important parts of contemporarymagic orders and neopagan groups. In Ceylon he met with AlanBennett, and through him Crowley came into contact with Yoga, aswell as with more general aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism.(Booth 2000: 126-132, 138-157; Kaczynski 2002: 69-82).Back in England, Crowley met and almost instantly marriedRose Kelly, the sister to Gerald Kelly, whom Crowley hadbefriended through his poetry in 1898 and who was a fellow memberof Golden Dawn (see Kaczynski 2002: 40-41, 57, 94-96). Rose cameto be Crowley’s first Scarlet Woman. For Crowley the ScarletWoman, the designation being appropriated from the biblical mythof the Whore of Babylon accompanying the Great Beast8 – thatCrowley identified himself with (see Kaczynski 2002: 17),represented contact with a powerful feminine spiritual force (seeCrowley 1996: 35, verse 1:15-16).The newlyweds travelled east for their honeymoon andeventually ended up in Cairo, Egypt, in early 1904. It was in Egyptthat Crowley’s really influential magical work began, as hechannelled Liber AL vel Legis, the Book of the Law, which was tobecome the cornerstone of Crowley’s magic. Rose Kelly had, whilepregnant, begun to manifest occult abilities and advised, in analtered state of consciousness, her husband to perform a certain8 Important to note is that Crowley did not regard the beast of the Book ofRevelations as the Christian Satan. Instead he saw the beast as the prophet ofthe New Aeon, the Aeon of Horus (Kaczynski 2002: 465)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"81CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDritual. Crowley did so, and came into contact with an entity calledAiwass (or Aiwaz), which he interpreted as his Holy Guardian Angel– his True Self. Included in the book are such key phrases as ‘Dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the law’ and ‘Love is the law,love under Will’ (Crowley 1996). Although Crowley was not initiallyenthusiastic about the message of the dictate, it later came to be thefoundation of his view of life and magic. The governing idea of thebook is that of Thelema – Will, as in the ultimate authority of theTrue Will of the magician as opposed to the adherence to anyexternal spiritual force. (Kaczynski 2002: 98-105; see Equinox 1998b,no. 7: 359-386 for an account on how Liber AL vel Legis was conceived,and Equinox 1998b, no. 7: 387-400 for an early commentary of thebook by Crowley. The pages in between the aforementionedwritings provide facsimiles of the original handwritten Liber AL).The Book of the Law introduced the idea of three ages that theworld has passed through. First, the Aeon of Isis, with thetrademarks of matriarchy and the worship of the Great Goddess.Secondly, the Aeon of Osiris, which began approximately around500 B.C., and is recognized through strong patriarchal and rule-governed religiosity. With the 1904 channelling, the third Age, theAeon of Horus – the Son, began9. The Aeon of Horus is identifiedby the religion of the True Self. (see Crowley 1996: 47, 89-92; Booth2000: 171-173, 182-186; Symonds & Grant 1979: 19-22).Rose and Crowley separated in 1908, and divorced in 1909,due to the severe alcoholism of Rose (Kaczynski 2002: 143), probablya result of the death of Rose’s and Aleister’s daughter Lilith in thesummer of 1906 (Kaczynski 2002: 126-127). In 1910 he met LeilaWaddell (1880-1932), and she came to be Crowley’s new ScarletWoman (Kaczynski 2002: 171).Crowley founded the order of the Silver Star (A:.A:., ArgentiumAstrum), as the third and highest order of the Golden Dawn, in 1907,with himself, George Cecil Jones and J.F.C. Fuller as the rulingtriumvirate (Kaczynski 2002: 138-139). The occult journal called9 This Aeon thinking was expanded on later with Michael Aquino of theTemple of Seth, who recognized 1966 as the starting point of the Aeon of Satan(Anton Szandor LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan which Aquino was earliera member of, had earlier declared 1966 as the starting point of the New SatanicAeon or the New Aeon of Fire) (Arlebrand 1995: 134-135)."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"82CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDEquinox was published in ten volumes from 1909 to 1913, andalthough it sold well Crowley lost money on it due to under-pricingthe publication (Kaczynski 2002: 148-149). The second issue of thejournal printed the first order rituals of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, which had previously been kept secret (Kaczynski2002: 153; Equinox 1998a, no. 2: 239-294). The Adeptus Minor ritualof the Inner order was printed in the third issue of Equinox (Equinox1998a, no. 3: 207-238). Liber 777, an extensive table ofcorrespondences, was published anonymously in 1909 (Kaczynski2002: 132, 147).With Mary Dempsey Crowley started to work on Book Four, ina process much similar to the work on The Book of the Law (Kaczynski2002: 193-199). Book Four consisted of four volumes publishedbetween 1912 and 1936. It was in this work, later published in onevolume called Magick, that the use of Magic with a ‘ck’ instead of asimple ‘c’ first came into use. By ‘Magick’ Crowley wished todifferentiate himself from stage magicians (see Crowley 1977: 45,footnote) as well as convey an esoteric meaning, since the ‘k’ stoodfor the female sexual organ. (Booth 2000: 194-195, 247, 263-265, 285,301, 321). Nowadays, the writing form stipulated by Crowley is theone favoured by most neopagan magicians.With the publication of Book of Lies in 1912 Crowley was visitedby Theodor Reuss (1855-1923), Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis.Reuss interpreted the book as a revelation of the innermost secretsof the order, and the ensuing discussion resulted in Reuss grantingCrowley degree IX, the highest degree, not counting theadministrational degree X, of O.T.O. Reuss also authorized Crowleyto open up a British branch of O.T.O. Crowley did this in formingMysteria Mystica Maxima. (Kaczynski 2002: 202-203).The history of Ordo Templi Orientis is complicated. Some sourcesstate that the order was founded in Germany around 1900 by Reuss,Franz Hartman (1838-1912) and Karl Kellner (1851-1905) (Kaczynski2002: 203; Booth 2000: 304-313, 423; Lewis 1999: 215-222). Peter R.Koenig gives a more convoluted picture of the origin of the order.According to Koenig, Theodor Reuss was something of anentrepreneur focusing on the formation of Masonic orders andissuing Masonic degrees. Karl Kellner was a spiritual seekerinterested in Tantra and Hatha Yoga. Sometime around 1904 Kellner"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"83CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDand Reuss decided to involve one of Reuss’ orders with Kellner’sYoga-circle, in order to recruit suitable practitioners to the circle.When Kellner became ill in 1904, Reuss decided to expand hisring of recruitment to his other orders, and thus O.T.O. came intoexistence, as some form of collective consisting of members from anumber of other orders. The later history of O.T.O. is not anysimpler. While some sources state that Crowley had probably beenappointed leader of O.T.O. by Reuss in 1922 (see Booth 2000: 304-313, 423; Lewis 1999: 215-222), Koenig writes that Crowley had mostlikely been expelled by Reuss in 1921, and that Crowley had declaredhimself Outer Head of the Order without any such sanction byReuss. Koenig also writes that it is doubtful if any of the currentO.T.O. groups stem from Reuss’ original order, and that it is morelikely that they are in the lineage of the Crowley instigated break-away O.T.O. (Koenig 1999: 13-26). Crowley did rewrite the O.T.O.rituals around 1914-1917 (see Kaczynski 2002: 203-204; Koenig 1999:13-26).The order was initiatory and focused much on sex as a way ofexpressing and working magic. Since this was one of Crowley’smain magical inclinations, the O.T.O. suited the English mage well.In 1914, Crowley added an 11th, anal sexual, initiation as an additionto the 9th, purely heterosexual, initiation. The 11th initiation is oftenseen as a homosexual initiation, but in reality it only madehomosexuality in the ceremonial setting possible (see footnote 110).In 1918, whilst living in New York, Crowley met the womanwho became his new Scarlet Woman, Leah Hirshig (Kaczynski 2002:263-265). Together they planned the opening of a temple andcommunity where Crowleyan magic and religion could be practised.Quite naturally, as Crowley’s teachings were unorthodox, and dueto Crowley’s bad reputation, the temple would have to be in aremote and secluded location. In Cefalú, Sicily, the appropriate placewas found and on April 2nd, 1920, the Abbey of Thelema was opened(Kaczynski 2002: 277-281). The community was very much anantecedent of ‘New Age’ and other countercultural communes ofthe 1960s and focused on sexual freedom, mainly as an aspect ofthe sex magic so important for the Crowleyan way of magicalpractice. The Abbey experienced difficult times as the British pressreported the death of Raoul Loveday, together with accounts of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"84CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDdrug use and sexual permissiveness at the location. The last memberremaining at the Abbey, actress Jane Wolfe, left on October 1st, 1927(Kaczynski 2002: 307-340). After 1927 Crowley spent his time incorrespondence with his pupil and published a number of books.Worth to mention are Moonchild (1928), Magick in Theory and Practice(1929), the Book of Thoth (1944) and the posthumously publishedMagick Without Tears (1973).Aleister Crowley died of myocardial degeneration and chronicbronchitis in Hastings, England, December 1st, 1947 (Kaczynski 2002:452). (Booth 2000: 346-364, 483).Crowley considered himself to be a reincarnation of prominentmagicians throughout the history of Western magic. The most recentof these was Eliphas Lévi, who had died in 1875, six months beforeCrowley’s birth. Earlier incarnations were Cagliostro, Edward Kellyand Pope Alexander VI. (Kaczynski 2002: 261; Symonds & Grant1979: 16-17). Crowley was a poet of moderate success, and publishedseveral works of fiction, mostly as self-financed publications (seeKazcynski 2002). In alternative spiritual and neopagan circles,Aleister Crowley is probably known by virtually everybody,although views on him differ. The concept of the Will, as it isunderstood by contemporary magicians and neopagans, can largelybe attributed to Crowley, as can the importance of sex magic andTantric practices (see Crowley 1998), which were introduced to thewest in large parts through Crowley. Crowley ́s definition of magickas “the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformitywith Will” (Crowley 1977: 131), as well as his mechanistic view onhow and why magic works, is commonly used by contemporarymagicians when defining the art. In the 1940s Crowley issued aTarot Card pack painted by Frieda Harris and wrote anaccompanying book on the Tarot (Kaczynski 2002: 411). Crowley’sThot Tarot is one of the more popular Tarot decks andinterpretations today (Gudmundsson 2001: 46-47).Two students of Crowley in particular are important to mentionin the scope of the present study. Israel Regardie (1907-1985) wasCrowley ́s secretary from 1928 to the early 1930s (Kaczynski 2002:343). He published several works treating the qabalah (see Regardie1945; 1973) and also published the collected rituals of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn in four volumes (Regardie 1937; 1938;"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"85CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND1939; 1940).Kennet Grant (b. 1924) became a pupil and secretary of Crowleyfor a short while in 1945 (Kaczynski 2002: 440-441). In addition toproducing works on magic in which he expands on Crowley’s work(see Grant 1994a; 1994b), the most important of which is Grant’sthree Typhonian Trilogies (see Bogdan 2003c), Grant has alsoparticipated in several works dealing with Crowley (see Symmonds& Grant 1979; Crowley 1977; Grant 1991).Continuing his studies in Crowleyana, Grant had applied towork with O.T.O. initiations in England. With his opening of theNew Isis Lodge in the 1950s (Grant 1991: 145, n5), combined withhim beginning to reorganize the O.T.O. instructions, he was expelledby Karl Germer. Grant took on the title of Outer Head of the Order(OHO), without any official sanction. (Kaczynski 2002: 459-461).He formed the Typhonian O.T.O. in 1970 (Koenig 1999: 25-26).There has surfaced documents which seem to support Grant ́sclaims of being the O.H.O. In these documents Crowley expressesthe wish for Grant to succeed him (Crowley 1947a; 1947b), althoughone must remember that Crowley himself had been expelled byReuss. It does however seem that Crowley had intended for Germerto be OHO of O.T.O. (Kaczynski 2002: 459).Grant incorporates the qliphoth, the dark shadow-side of thelight sephiroth in the qabalah, in his magic system, while Crowleygenerally considered the qliphoth purely evil. Regarding the Treeof Life Grant writes:“Occultism in the West, however, has been dominated byinterpretations that take into account only the positive aspectof this great symbol. The other side, the negative or averse ofthe Tree has been kept out of sight and sedulously ignored.But there is no day without night, and Being itself cannot bewithout reference to Non-Being of which it is the inevitablemanifestation” (Grant 1994b: 1).Grant views balancing the negative and positive aspects of existenceas very important, and as a prerequisite for high level magicprogress (see Grant 1994b: 1-10, 31)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"86CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND2.1.5 The ‘New Age’ MovementThe ‘New Age movement’ is the academic umbrella-term given toseveral loosely organized spiritual movements and ideas (Frisk 1998:163). Many academics define ‘New Age’ as self-spirituality, focusingon the primacy of self-evolvement in the here-and-now instead ofthe God- and after-world- centeredness of most traditional religionsand many other esoteric movements (See Heelas 1996; 2002; York1995). The term derives from the alternative spiritual milieu of the1960s and 1970s, when the central optimistic idea revolved aroundthe coming of the ‘New Age’, often called the ‘Age of Aquarius’,which was expected to bring an era of peace, harmony and spiritualwellbeing. Christianity was generally thought to belong to the prior‘Age of Pisces’, and was a thing of the past. Whereas Christianity ischaracterised by dogmas and structured authority, ‘New Age’ isgenerally characterised by the lack of the same. (Chryssides 1999:316). According to Paul Heelas, the ‘New Age’ involved a shift fromReligion, in which authority is placed on outer-personal doctrines,to Spirituality, in which authority was placed on the individual andhis/her experiences. ‘New Age’ spiritualities involve thesacralization of life rather than the preparation for afterlife. (Heelas2002). The advent of ‘the New Age’ as well as the popularity of thistype of spirituality can be traced to late modern societal changes,as dealt with in section 2.3.York traces ‘New Age’ to the American metaphysical tradition,originally stemming from the New England transcendentalists suchas Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) and Margaret Fuller (1810-1850), and finding its modes ofpractice in the likes of Spiritualism, the Theosophical Society andChristian Science (York 1995: 33). The transcendentalists saw innerspirituality as the core of true religion and institutional religion wasdisavowed. Nature, with divine forces permeating it, was seen as amodel for spiritual harmony (Hammer 1997: 32). The basicfoundation which the form of spirituality coined as the Americanmetaphysical tradition was the innate potential of the human beingto access the divine sphere, without the mediating hand of theinstitutional Church. Man was seen to have tremendous potential"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"87CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDwithin himself and only the inner, true spirituality could unlockthis potential (see Hammer 1997: 35; Aadnanes 1997: 201).Many scholars link the birth of the ‘New Age movement’ withthe countercultural setting of the 1960s and 1970s (see Ahlin 2001:16-19; Melton & Lewis 1992: xi). The counterculture was bornthrough the post-second world war generation of middle-classAmericans who had been brought up in material prosperity and arelatively secure society. The education of the new middle-classyouth was higher than that of the previous generation and theywere living in a society where the individual had been put at thecentre. Two main groups of the counterculture are often underdiscussion, the hippie-movement and the leftist-movement, bothof them converging on the strong anti-war sentiments during thewar in Vietnam. The goal of both movements was to free theindividual in some way, either from the oppressing influence ofthe parent generation, as for the Hippies, or from the oppression ofcapitalist society as for the New Left. In the search for freedom, theresult was often the appropriation of unorthodox beliefs andpractices condemned by society at large.Hammer discusses the alternative spiritual milieu of the 1950sonwards, which in combination with the counterculture gave riseto the ‘New Age movement’ (Hammer 1997: 69-79). JidduKrishnamurti (discussed in section 2.1.2) moved to California inthe 1930s after having denounced his status as World Teacher andrapidly began to attract a following. Indian Vedanta-philosophyfound a breeding ground in California in the late 1930s, and alongwith Krishnamurti, the Guru Prabhavananda was popular amongthe rich and famous of the South-western USA. With the start ofthe Second World War the majority of the important Europeanauthors influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism, including AldousHuxley, moved to California. The interests of the immigrated Indianspiritual teachers and the alternative intellectuals converged and anew spiritual underground influenced by eastern religiosity wasborn. During the late 1940s the interest in psychedelic drugs wasgrowing and in 1953 Aldous Huxley, who despite great efforts hadnot managed to attain deep spiritual experiences, volunteered totake part in an experiment involving mescaline. The results were"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"88CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDimmediate and Huxley praised the drug as a fast means of attainingthe spiritual plane. A spiritual drug-subculture was born.As a reaction to the dominant schools of psychology,Behaviourism and Freudian Psychoanalysis, HumanisticPsychology was developed by among others Abraham Maslow. Itwas felt that Freudian Psychoanalysis was too pessimistic andBehaviourism was criticized for its mechanical view of humanbehaviour. Humanistic Psychology stressed the potential of eachindividual instead of the focus on pathology in psychoanalysis. Theschool came to be appropriated much more by the alternativespiritual milieu than by academic psychology. (Hammer 1997: 72-76).The alternative spiritual milieu mixed with the counterculturein the late 1950s through the meeting of the beat culture and neo-Hinduism. Influential authors such as Jack Kerouac were veryinterested in Buddhism and Hinduism (see Heelas 1996: 49-50;Aadnanes 1997: 202) and others such as Allen Ginsberg wereinvolved in the psychedelic drug scene. Through authors such asthese, the alternative spiritual milieu spread to a large number ofalienated American youths. With the illegalization of psychedelicdrugs in the 1970s, people were forced to find new ways to expresstheir spiritual aspirations and an alternative spirituality emergedfrom the Western appropriation of Eastern religiosity, late modernindividuality and the goal to attain the enormous potential of theindividual, as inspired by Humanistic Psychology. (Hammer 1997:71, 76-79).Different timeframes have been given for the birth of the ‘NewAge movement’. Based on the emergence of the first Americannetworks that used the term New Age as a self-designation J.Gordon Melton situates the emergence of the movement in 1971(see Hammer 1997: 80). The popular emergence of ‘New Age’ ismost often located to the 1980s. Marilyn Ferguson’s influential TheAquarian Conspiracy was published in 1980 and the actor ShirleyMacLaine’s Out on a Limb in 1983. 1987 is usually seen as the year inwhich ‘New Age’ reached mass-audiences and thus became anelement in mainstream religiosity. This was the year when Out on aLimb was televised, a massive festival for ‘New Age’ types ofspirituality was organized in the United States for the first time,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"89CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDand the hugely influential Time magazine published an article onNew Age. (see Hammer 1997: 82-84; Melton & Lewis 1992: ix).In the early 21st century few of the movements and practicesgenerally defined as belonging to the ‘New Age’ focus on, or evendiscuss, the coming of the Age of Aquarius or view the societallytransformative aspects as particularly important (see for exampleHammer 1997: 285-286; Lewis 1992: 1-2). Some academics, such asJ. Gordon Melton, view the ‘New Age’ as being passé as a movementand find that these different currents and groups instead belong tothe more inclusive category of what is most often called WesternEsotericism (see Melton 2004). The general ideas that were presenthave not, however, disappeared anywhere, although the way inwhich the coming universal enlightenment is discussed haschanged.Hanegraaff discusses New Age sensu stricto and New Age sensulato (Hanegraaff 1996: 94-110, 356-361). New Age sensu stricto isspirituality with millenarian characteristics, occupied with the ideaof the ‘Coming of the Age of Aquarius’. New Age sensu lato on theother hand is a more inclusive category and the subject ofHanegraaff’s scrutiny. In part correctly, Sutcliffe criticizesHanegraaff’s view of New Age sensu lato as the Campbellian culticmilieu, having consciously formed a movement in itself at some pointin time (Hanegraaff 1996: 97), as providing more questions thananswers (Sutcliffe 2003: 24). However, if treating the ‘New Age’ assome sort of unified form of spirituality this view is functional.Hanegraaff further defines ‘New Age’ as a “manifestation ofpopular culture-criticism, defining itself primarily by its oppositionto the values of the ‘old’ culture” (Hanegraaff 1996: 331) and in thishe captures an important ingredient of ‘New Age’. In addition tothe concern with the Self, ‘New Age’ is largely critical of mainstreammedicine, education, science etc. This is probably a remnant of thecountercultural roots of the phenomenon. ‘New Age’ has, however,adopted a positive evaluation of a large number of contemporarymainstream culture values, two key examples of which would beindividualism and capitalist economy. A number of other valuesheld in common with much of the rest of contemporary society,such as ecology and the positivity of multiculturalism, may in partstem from ‘New Age’ itself. The cultural critique of ‘New Age’ is"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"90CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDnot, however, particularly aggressive or subversive, as the form ofspirituality is very world-affirming (Chryssides 1999), extendingto the affirmation of mainstream culture on a large scale. The critiqueof mainstream science is also equivocal. Whereas mainstreammedical science is often criticized for its mechanical approach novelscientific theories are frequently adopted and reinterpreted (seeHammer 2001: 502-503).Steven J. Sutcliffe highly criticizes the academic construct of a‘New Age movement’ (Sutcliffe 2003: 21-25). He points to examplesfrom the works of York (1995), Heelas (1996), Hanegraaff (1996)and others and correctly points out that there are no real,fundamental essentials of a ‘New Age movement’ that theresearchers are able to find. George Chryssides acknowledges thisdifficulty in defining ‘New Age’ and attributes this to the diversityof the form of spirituality (Chryssides 1999: 315).The ‘New Age’ is a vast phenomenon and a seemingly limitlessnumber of practices and ideas fit into it10. As Chryssides notes: “Itsvariety and eclecticism are as much part of its inherent nature asthey are a part of its appeal” (Chryssides 1999: 315). The commondenominators are usually, as mentioned above, the objectives ofself-evolvement, self-fulfilment and self-realisation in various ways(see Frisk 1998: 163-164; Heelas 1996; York 1995; Chryssides 1999:317-318). Recognizing the difficulties in defining the subject manyscholars treat ‘New Age’ spirituality in terms of Wittgensteinianfamily resemblance. In the words of Eileen Barker (quoted in Lewis1992: 6): “the ‘movement’ is not so much a movement as a numberof groups and individuals that have a number of beliefs andorientations that have what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgensteinhas called a ‘family resemblance’ – two members of the family may10 One could mention alternative medicine, such as Reiki and Zone-therapy;borrowed and reinterpreted religious practices of tribal people, such as shamanicpractices; foretelling techniques, such as astrology, Tarot-reading and I Ching;Channelling; beliefs and practices pertaining to UFO’s and Parapsychology;Business training, such as Erhard Seminars Training based TransformationalTechnologies; alternative science and a general spiritual approach to variousfields in life, such as diets (for example macro-biotic food), education, art (suchas various New Age music and the novels of James Redfield) and home-furnishing (for example Feng Shui), just to name a few (see Chryssides 1999:315; Heelas 1996)."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"91CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDbear almost no resemblance to each other, although they bothresemble a third member”. Olav Hammer recognises, again in aWittgensteinian fashion, the following features not as necessarycharacteristics of ‘New Age’ spirituality but as often recurringthemes.•A view of the entire cosmos as an interconnected whole•A direction in existence – indicating that humans createtheir circumstances not vice versa•Everything is permeated by a divine force or energy•Humans have mismanaged their existence but thepresent condition is possible to repair•The earth is a living thing which has been abused byhumanity•Every human has his/her own unique part in existence•A belief in reincarnation combined with a belief inspiritual evolution through the different reincarnations•There are better ways to attain knowledge than the wayscience provides•Eastern and traditional nature religion containuniversal and ancient wisdom•Humanity is on the verge of a spiritual and societalrevolution. (Hammer 1997: 18-19).Hammer also stresses that ‘New Age’ religiosity is essentiallyeclectic. Expressed with the help of the Smorgasbord metaphor, theindividual picks those specific beliefs and practices which he/shelikes and combines them in a way that suits him/her. No twopersons’ comprehension of ‘New Age’ spirituality is identical. Eventhough there are no central authorities dictating the rights andwrongs of ‘New Age’, and considering the seemingly limitlessnumber of dishes on the smorgasbord, certain characteristics seemto be more or less universal. One such item is the belief inreincarnation, with an optimistic evolutionary framework (Hammer1997: 18-21).James R. Lewis discusses the following of Robert Ellwood’sgeneral characteristics of new religious groups as relevant for ‘NewAge’ (Lewis 1992: 7):"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND•An emphasis on healing•The use of scientific language as a means to be in syncwith contemporary society•Eclecticism and syncretism•Monistic and impersonal worldview and view on thedivine•Optimism manifest in success orientation and anevolutionary approach to spirituality•Emphasis on psychic powersLewis further points at the importance of the idea of transformation,both individual and societal, in ‘New Age’ (Lewis 1992: 8).Both Hammer’s and Ellwood’s characterizations display theproblem with the ‘New Age’ designate. In the Wittgensteinian‘family likeness’ metaphor almost anything could be identified as‘New Age’. In Hammer’s list five of the characteristics are true forDragon Rouge, as well as many other esoteric movements,intrinsically and at least three others hold true for many membersof the order. In Lewis’ pick of Ellwood’s characteristics at least twocharacteristics are intrinsic. I would not, however, categorize DragonRouge as belonging to the ‘New Age’ movement and I believe thatthis opinion is held by most other academics and laypeople in someway familiar with the order. I have not to date encountered oneDragon Rouge member who would identify the order as ‘New Age’.It suffices to say that both ‘New Age’ and Dragon Rouge are part ofthe alternative spiritual milieu, and as such there are bothconnections and likenesses between them. ‘New Age’ spiritualityand Dragon Rouge do however emphasize different aspects of theesoteric tradition.The number of people attracted to ‘New Age’ spirituality isimpossible to determine, as people active in the field are often notorganized in groups, and may in fact disagree quite strongly withthe identification of themselves as religious (although most wouldprobably agree on being spiritual on some level). A statistical surveyfrom 1994 shows that a large percentage of the Swedish adultpopulation believe more or less strongly in the paranormal in wayswhich do not fit in with traditional Christianity (see Sjödin 1998:66-67)."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"93CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND2.1.6 NeopaganismThe word ‘pagan’, used as a self-identification by most adherentsof contemporary Western nature religion, derives from the LatinPaganus, pejoratively denoting people in Roman times living outsidethe cities and thus not a part of the city-culture of the time.Neopagans of today use the term as a positive self-designation incontrasting themselves to Christianity which is experienced to behostile towards nature, women and life in the here-and-now.(Chryssides 1999: 336; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 99-100). Theprehistory of the positive evaluation of the word can be traced backto the middle of the 19th century, when many British intellectualshad become increasingly dissatisfied with the Christian view ofnature. The term neopaganism was coined in 1891 by Christianapologist W.F. Barry as a pejorative term for the romanticising ofancient non-Christian religiosity and as a critique towards thoseadvocating it. (Hutton 1999b: 19-20).In the early days of neopaganism it was common to discussthis form of religion as the ‘Old Religion’ in the sense of an originaland true pre-Christian religion having been revived by the moderninheritors of the religion. Margaret Murray (1863-1963) argued inher works The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921) and The God ofthe Witches (1931) that the people tried in the medieval witch trialswhere actually members of a secret pagan religion11 (Mikaelsson &Gilhus 1998: 102; Bogdan 2003b: 203). Murray’s work was laterdiscredited, but was in its time able to spawn renewed interest innon-Christian religion. (Hutton 1999b: 31-34; Chryssides 1999: 225-336).Although the term ‘the Old Religion’ is still in use, it is muchless common among the neopagans of today to claim an ancientorigin (Harvey 1997: 52). It is commonly accepted amongparticipants that contemporary Western nature religions are largely11 Murray based her arguments on the works of scholars Karl-Ernst Jarckeand Franz-Josef Mone, as well as well as on the writings of the Americanadventurer, Charles Godfrey Leland, most notably Aradia (1899) which Lelandclaimed was the gospel of an Italian based branch of the pagan religion andwhich had been passed on to him by one of the last remaining members of thistradition. It was Leland who had characterized the alleged pre-Christian religionas ‘the Old Religion’. (Hutton 1999b: 31-34)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"94CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDreconstructions, not survivals (Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 102-103).This is much due to the harsh critique of the works of the importantfounding authors of Wicca delivered by American esoteric scholarsfrom the 1970s onwards (Hutton 1999b: 65; Kelly 1992: 148).There are many forms of neopaganism today, but Wicca is thelargest variant (Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 102), and I will thereforetreat it in more detail than the other variants. Other large fractionsare Goddess spirituality, which is closely connected to Wicca,Druidry, Asatrú and neoshamanism. It was with Gerald Gardner’sWitchcraft Today, published in 1954, that neopaganism per se, in theform of Wicca, was born12. In the book, to which the aforementionedMargaret Murray provided the preface, it was argued that ‘the OldReligion’ had survived into modern times. The Witchcraft Act of1736, which had made witchcraft illegal, was repealed in 1951 andit was thus possible for neopagans to publicly profess to witchcraft(Hammer 1997: 129). In his biography, published in 1960, Gardnerwrote that he had been initiated into one of the last remainingwitchcraft covens.Gardner had been involved in Masonic and Rosicruciansocieties and had had some dealings with Aleister Crowley13 (see12 Some reports state that Wicca was founded by Gardner in 1939(Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 102; Kelly 1992: 136) while other reports state thatWicca started with the abolishment of the Witchcraft Act (Hammer 1997: 129).What is sure is however that Gardner instigated an interest in practicedwitchcraft with a series of fictional works depicting witchcraft from 1939onwards (Hammer 1997: 129; Hutton 1999a) and later claimed to having beeninitiated into a coven in the same year (Bogdan 2003b: 203).13 According to Gardner he had actually been initiated into Crowley’s OrdoTempli Orientis in 1946 but had decided not to play an active part in the order(Hutton 1999a: 205-207; 1999b: 34, 43-55). Elsewhere it has been stated that theearly Gardnerian initiations and rituals owe much to Aleister Crowley, even tothe extent of being written by him for Gardner (see Bogdan 2003b: 207-208).Research by Aidan Kelly has shown that Gardner’s early texts are based on directquotations from works by Aleister Crowley and Charles Leland, from SamuelMathers’ translation of the grimoire The Greater Key of Solomon the King, and ofMargaret Murray’s descriptions of the witches’ cult. The Golden Dawn andFreemasonic ceremonial texts provided the base for the rituals (Hutton 1999b:49). Aleister Crowley was, as demonstrated in sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, one of themost influential occultists to appear from the Golden Dawn. The word Wicca,derived from the old English word for Witch, was used by Gardner to denote apractitioner of ‘the Old Religion’, albeit in the spelling ‘Wica’ later changed tothe more correct ‘Wicca’ by adherents of the movement (Hutton 1999b: 44)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"95CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDsection 2.1.4) (Hutton 1999a: 205-207; 1999b: 34, 43-55). RonaldHutton attributes great importance to the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn (se section 2.1.3) as a forerunner, or an inspiration,for the modern neopagan religions. It was in the Golden Dawn thatWestern initiatory esotericism, which until then had more or lesssolely been dominated by Christian influences, was mixed with non-Christian elements. (Hutton 1999b: 12-13).Important offshoots of Gardnerian Wicca are AlexandrianWicca (started by Alex Sanders in the 1960s and gaining popularityin the 1970s) and American Feminist Wicca. Alexandrian Wicca,with the name deriving both from the first name of its founder butalso from allusions to the great Egyptian city Alexandria, includedhigh magic in the form of qabalah and elaborated Golden Dawnrituals on its program. Alexandrian Wicca is also more open tohomosexuality than the more heteronormative Gardnerian variant,although there are Gardnerian Wicca-groups for all-malehomosexuals (see Kelly 1992: 149). (Hutton 1999b: 58-60).The birth of American Feminist Wicca can be traced to thefounding of WITCH (Women’s International Conspiracy from Hell)in 1968. A defining characteristic was the critique of the witchcrafttrials as an open war waged by the Christians against the paganwitch-women, a war not only on the religion but on the whole ofwomankind. Dianic Wicca, born out of America, is a particular formof Wicca which admits only women and focuses largely on feministreligious issues (Hammer 1997: 133-134). (Hutton 1999b: 60-65).Wiccans are normally organized in small covens ideally withthirteen members. As sex-polarity is an important theme in thepractice of the religion the coven should traditionally have an equalamount of men and women, although there are covens that acceptonly female members and those that do not attach any importanceto the ratio of men to women. (Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 103).According to Graham Harvey, the growing trend today is that ofindividual practitioners who do not meet in groups (Harvey 1997:50). Wicca, at least in the more traditional forms, offers initiationinto three degrees (see Bogdan 2003b: 218-233). Normally one shouldbe initiated by a High Priest/Priestess of the opposite sex, althoughthis is naturally not the case with covens with strictly same-sexmembers."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"96CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDThe practice centres on seasonal celebrations at the followingoccasions:•Samhain, on October 31st, when the start of the winter,and the death of nature, is celebrated•Yule, Midwinter or the winter solstice, when the returnof the sun is celebrated•Imbolc or Brigid, on February 1st or 2nd, when the comingof spring is celebrated•Eostre/Ostara or the Spring Equinox, which alsocelebrates spring•Beltaine, on April 30th or May 1st, when the coming ofthe summer is celebrated•Summer solstice, at midsummer, celebrating the vitalityof nature•Lammas or Lughnasadh, on July 31st, which celebratesthe fertility of nature, as this is the traditional time ofharvest•Autumn Equinox, which, similarly to the springequinox, is a celebration of the balance of nature.The seasonal cycle is called the Wheel of Life, as it follows the seasonalrhythm of nature (Harvey 1997: 3-13; Hammer 1997: 131-132). Mostneopagans celebrate these seasonal festivals, and the timing isusually connected to the seasons of the northern hemisphere, evenwhen the neopagans in question are living in the southernhemisphere (Harvey 1997: 3). While the other festivals derive fromold northern European traditions the celebration of the equinoxesis of modern heritage (Harvey 1997: 9). A key Wiccan ritual isDrawing Down the Moon, which is included as a part in most otherrituals. Drawing Down of the Moon involves invoking the power ofthe Goddess, represented by the moon, into the practitioner (seeHarvey 1997: 39-40; Bogdan 2003b: 218-219).Goddess Worship, or Goddess Spirituality, stems directly fromWicca. Whereas in traditional Wicca two divinities, the masculineHorned God and the feminine Great Goddess, are worshipped,Goddess Spirituality keeps only the feminine divinity, as thedesignate implies. Feminism, which is a recurrent theme in mostneopaganisms, is most pronounced in Goddess Spirituality, and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"97CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDthe goddess is seen as manifest in every woman. A prevalent mythemployed is that of an original matriarchy in which humans werecloser to nature and which was suppressed by patriarchal Indo-European invaders. Common to both Wicca and GoddessSpirituality is the view that women are closer to the realm of magicand nature than men. (Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 100-104; Harvey1997: 69-86).The roots of Druidry go back as far as the 18th century. Theearly modern druids were not pagan but rather Christian, simplyhighlighting the ancestral roots of their Celtic origin. Orders ofdruids, these largely Christian as well, where also formed basicallyas versions of Freemasonic orders. It was during the 1960s and the1970s that Druidry as a form of neopagan self-identification wasborn, and when neopagan druid orders were founded. The historicalremains of ancient Celtic druids are as good as non-existent, andtherefore the neopagan Druidry is more of a recreation than, forexample, Asatrú. Reverence for nature, especially for oak trees, isvery important to Druidry, as are the seasonal celebrations. Druidshave an initiation system consisting of the three classes of Bards –involved in music and poetry, Ovates – focusing on communicationwith nature and the Otherworld and Druids – who are the publicface of Druidry and manage the organizational tasks. It is howeveroften stressed that none of the classes is more important than theothers, and that a Bard should not be considered a novice Druid.Whereas Wicca and Goddess Spirituality mainly draw femalepractitioners, Druidry is more popular amongst males. (Mikaelsson& Gilhus 1998: 107-110; Harvey 1997: 17-34; Hammer 1997: 134-135).Asatrú, also called Heathenism or Odinism, is the recreationof the worship of the ancient Germanic and Scandinavian divinities.In contrast to the other branches of neopaganism, Asatrú operateswith more traditional gender roles, in which man and woman areseen to have their own tasks and roles in worship and society.Traditional male ideals, such as strength and honour, are revered.Although race, and more pronouncedly ancestry, has at times beenan issue in Druidry this is not generally the case today (Hammer1997: 135). In Asatrú race generally plays a significant part, althoughthere are exceptions. It is often stated that each race or cultural grouphas its own distinguishing features and religions which suite them"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"98CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDbest, and Asatrú is the religion of the Germanic and Scandinavianpeople. Asatrú is also popular among right-wing political groups,although the conclusion that Asatrú equals racism should not bedrawn. In fact many Heathens strongly relinquish any racistsympathies and state that these have no part in Asatrú. Heathenismis the most distinctly polytheistic of the types of neopaganism,incorporating the vast pantheon of Norse divinities whereas, forexample, Wicca only operates with the god and the goddess. Theseasonal celebrations of the Heathens also take a slightly differentform. On Iceland Asatrú has, since 1973, been an officiallyrecognized religion with granted rights of providing legalized liferituals, such as marriage, burial and baptism. The religion had 172registered members in the mid 1990s. (Harvey 1997: 53-68; Hammer1997: 135-136; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 104-107).Neoshamanism, defined by Lisbeth Mikaelsson and IngvildGilhus as the Western application of traditional shamanic techniques(Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 100), is the last neopagan branch I willtreat in the present context. Neoshamanism became an alternativespiritual fad in the 1960s with the publication of Carlos Castaneda’sThe Teachings of Don Juan, and the subsequent publication of a seriesof books by him focusing on the same themes. A contributing factor,due to the popular countercultural fixation on hallucinogenic drugs,was Castaneda’s descriptions of drug-induced spiritual experiences.Castaneda was a PhD-student in anthropology at the University ofCalifornia. He claimed that he had done field work with a Yaqui-Indian medicine man called Don Juan. Although his claims werelater discredited, he was awarded a PhD in 1973 for a manuscriptbased on his third book, Journey to Ixtlan, published in 1972 (seeSvanberg 2003: 84-88). In addition, the academic discrediting ofCastaneda’s works has had little if any effect on modern dayneoshamans, ‘New Agers’ and magicians, who still read Castaneda’sbooks. Today the fad has become a fixture in the alternative spiritualmainstream.In 1980, Michael Harner published a handbook on shamanicpractices called The Way of the Shaman. In this book Harner, whowas an anthropologist gone native, introduced the concept of CoreShamanism. Core Shamanism was presented as a general shamanismbased on what was fundamental to the shamanism of different"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"99CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDnative people around the world. Academics do not, however, acceptHarner’s Core Shamanism and prefer to speak of shamanisms, sincethe differences between shamanic-like practices in different tribalsocieties are greater than the similarities. (Hammer 1997: 110-113,116-118; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 110-111).There are a few major differences between neoshamanism andthe shamanisms of traditional people. Among traditional peoplebecoming a shaman is not something one chooses, or even regardsas a choice occupation. The shaman generally becomes a religiousprofessional through an experience of grave illness which he (asthe shaman is almost without exception a male) recovers fromthrough contact with the spirit world. The shaman’s mainoccupation is to function as a healer and a protector of the people,retrieving the souls of the sick from the spirit world and guardingthe village against otherworldly harm. The neoshaman chooses hisoccupation, although narratives of ‘a dark night of the soul’ arecommon, and anyone willing has the possibility of becoming one.In contrast to traditional shamans, the Western neoshaman is onewho works in a group of fellow neoshamans. Generally neoshamansdraw inspiration from the tribal peoples of South, Central and NorthAmerica, but Nordic influences, such as the Sámi and the Old Norsetraditions, are also prominent. Although neoshamanism can beconsidered a distinct branch of neopaganism, it is also a practicewhich overlaps with all of the other branches. Most neopaganvariants practice some form of shamanic technique. (Harvey 1997:107-122; Hammer 1997: 118-119, 122-123; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998:110-112). Old Norse and Sámi inspired neoshamanism is quiteprominent in Sweden and will be dealt with in-depth in section 2.2.A distinct form of neoshamanism is so-calledtechnoshamanism, in which dancing to techno-music at rave partiesis used as a technique to come into contact with the spiritual plane.Technoshamanism is generally considered to belong more closelyto the ‘New Age’ milieu and not as much to neopaganism. (Hammer1997: 119; Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 112; Harvey 1997: 122-124).The following characteristics are common to all movementsand groups identified as neopagan:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"100CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND•The reverence of nature and life is a distinguishing trait.Neopagans celebrate life in the here-and-now insteadof focusing their spiritual aspirations on a futureafterlife. Nature represents the immanent divine forcepermeating everything and ecological activism is thenatural outcome of this view. Consequently soul andbody are not seen as separated but rather as one.•There are no authoritative dogmas and no centralauthority governing the neopagan groups. Neopaganscan freely choose their preferred ways of belief andpractice, and one’s own experiences are considered tobe the most important authority. The only rule is thatone should not harm others: “Eight words the WiccanRede fulfil; An’ it harm none, do what ye will”(Hammer 1997: 133). A common belief is that whateveryou do, both good and bad, comes back to youthreefold.•Neopagan practices are very similar amongst thedifferent branches. Seasonal celebrations are more orless a rule and shamanic practices are very common.The practice of magic, in a combination of high ritualmagic and popular folk magic, is also a commondenominator. Initiations occur in many forms ofpaganism, Druidry and Wicca representing the clearestexamples of this.•The view of Christianity is generally negative.Christianity is often seen as the antithesis ofneopaganism, in regard to spiritual aspirations and theattitude towards nature. Not seldom, Christianity isseen as the main offender when it comes to the sourcesof unsound ecology and the persecution of people withdissident beliefs. It is however important to point outthat many pagans strive towards a sound dialogue withChristians, and that the dislike of Christianity, as a rule,never takes on aggressive qualities.•Sex-polarity is an important factor in neopagan magic.The male and the female complement each other,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"101CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDrepresenting what is seen as the male and female forcesin existence. In magical rituals it is usually importantthat individuals of both sexes are present and initiationsare usually provided by a person of the opposite sex.In some traditions of Wicca this goes as far as statingthat the practice of magic is impossible for homosexuals.There are however groups that do not place as muchimportance on actual sex-polarity in the ritual contextand groups that work exclusively with women andfeminine forces.•Feminism is a recurrent theme. Most neopagan groupsactively work to improve the situation of women anddo not accept different gender roles for the sexes. Anexception is Asatrú, where traditional gender roles areassigned, although this does not hold true for allHeathen groups. (Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 100-101;Harvey 1997; Hammer 1997: 124-126).The adherents of neopagan subgroups generally assemble in jointnetworks so that Wiccans have common Wiccan federations, Druidscommon Druidic organizations etc. The practitioners of the differenthead branches of neopaganism are also commonly united undernational and international associations and interest groups, amongwhich the Pagan Federation is the largest one. (Mikaelsson & Gilhus1998: 100-101).Beside the purely religious variants of neopaganism thepopularity of things pagan is also visible in the increased tourismto ancient cult sites, the huge interest in mythology and fantasyliterature and the widespread use of pagan symbols (Mikaelsson &Gilhus 1998: 117-122).2.1.7 Neopaganism and ‘New Age’Works dealing with ‘New Age’ spirituality usually also treatneopaganism (see Hammer 1997; Hanegraaff 1996; York 1995;Heelas 1996). Views differ on whether neopaganism should be"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"102CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDtreated as a part of ‘New Age’ or as something distinct. Accordingto George Chryssides, neopaganism should be “sharplydistinguished” from ‘New Age’. Whereas ‘New Age’ is highlyeclectic and lacks strict boundaries, neopaganism, and especiallyWicca, is a clearly defined religion. It is a spiritual path for “‘finders’rather than ‘seekers’”. (Chryssides 1999: 332). Other scholars seeneopaganism as a part, although perhaps more or less clearlydemarcable, of ‘New Age’ (see Hammer 1997: 124-125).There are many similarities between what is seen as ‘New Age’spirituality and what is considered to belong to neopaganism, butthere are also many differences. According to Michael York, thesimilarities between ‘New Age’ and neopaganism amount to “eco-humanism in some variant, the belief in the intrinsic divinity of theindividual, epistemological individualism, and exploratory use oftheonymic metaphors not traditionally associated with the Judeo-Christian mainstream” (York 1995: 145). Both neopaganism and‘New Age’ have the same anti-authoritarian structure, discardingofficial authority in favour of the authority of experiences and theself.Ecology and sacralization of life (see Heelas 2002) and theindividual are common characteristics of both ‘New Age’ andneopaganism. Nature is seen as something to be revered and theindividual is divine. However, the ecology of ‘New Age’ spiritualityis usually more focused on the individual than on nature itself. The‘healing of Mother Earth’ is fundamentally a healing of the self andcontact with nature is sought in order to ‘find oneself’. This is alsoa part of neopagan ecology, but the focus is more on nature itself.Regarding the divinity of the individual, neopagans do notexperience a distinction between body and soul, whereas ‘NewAgers’ tend to view spirit as truer than matter, sometimes going tothe lengths of denying any reality of the material. (see York 1995:146-147). Connected to this is the sharp distinction between ‘thelight’ and ‘the dark’ in ‘New Age’ spirituality in contrast to the more‘in-balance’ view of neopaganism. ‘New Agers’ reject the dark assomething purely evil and are focused on reaching and embracingthe light, which is good and spiritual, whereas neopagans usuallysee the light and the dark as mutually dependent. The dark, asrepresented by, for example, death, is a necessary component of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"103CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDlife (York 1995: 159-160). There are however neopagans, mainlyWiccans, who condemn the dark and have a more dualistic take onreality.Religious practice is another area of difference. Neopagansusually construct elaborate ritualistic elements for their practices,based on ceremonial magic patterns. ‘New Age’ meetings are mostlybased on the lecture model, and where practice is involved it usuallyassumes a more mundane form than in neopaganism. In addition,‘New Agers’ do not engage in initiations to the same extent asneopagans, at least not in the same complex forms. (see York 1995:147). Where organization is concerned ‘New Age’ is much moreloosely based than neopaganism. ‘New Agers’ move from onepractice to another as individuals and are seldom organized asgroups for long periods of time. The majority of neopagans aremembers of some group or organization and often view the groupas important. Even individual practitioners of neopagan crafts maybe members of some of the head organizations such as PaganFederation. ‘New Age’ has no head organization. One could saythat it is possible to delimit neopaganism whereas the ‘New Age’tends to elude all attempts to define it (see section 2.1.4).Another difference can be seen in the chronological focus ofthe two types of spirituality. Rhetorically, neopagans are focusedon ‘before’, as in a more nature-oriented and harmonious time beforeChristianity. ‘New Agers’, on the other hand, are focused on thefuture, as in spiritual evolution of the self and perhaps of society.(see Kelly 1992: 138). Important to note, however, is that these aremainly discursive strategies. ‘New Agers’ regularly discuss‘universal truth to be found in ancient religion’ and neopagans striveto live in the here and now, expressing ecological concerns for thefuture.Linkages between ‘New Age’ and neopaganism are closest andmost apparent in the practice of neoshamanic techniques, withwitchcraft as a good runner-up. Neoshamanic practices cross thewhole milieu of alternative spirituality, but whereas neopagansoften gather in neoshaman groups with clear ideological andpractice-related delimitations, ‘New Agers’ do not."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"104CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND2.2 The Alternative Spiritual Milieu of SwedenIn the present section I will deal with the alternative spiritual milieuof Sweden in general and Stockholm in particular, focusing on the1970s onwards. I will not treat the more organized New ReligiousMovements in any greater detail, but will instead concentrate onalternative spiritualities such as ‘New Age’, neopaganism and occultcurrents.The older and more established alternative spirituality is inSweden, as in most other countries, represented by variousSpiritualist associations. Spiritualism took root in Swedish societyin 1878 with the forming of the first spiritualist association. SverigesSpiritualisters Riksförbund (SSR), a Swedish national association forspiritualists, was formed in 1949, and still remains active, althougha split occurred in the mid 1980s and the rival SpiritualistiskaRiksförbundet för Andlig Utveckling (SRAU) was formed (Frisk 1998:33). Sällskapet Sanningssökarna [the Seekers of Truth], also mentionedby Thomas Karlsson (see section 4.1.1), was formed in 1904 and isthe oldest Swedish spiritualist association still active today. In thebeginning, the association was called Frenologiska Sällskapet and wasprimarily involved in phrenology14. In 1920, the name was changedto Spiritualistiska Sällskapet, as spiritualism had become moreprominent in the association than Phrenology and in 1956 thecurrent name was adopted, to indicate openness to different spiritualpaths. (Sanningsökarna 2004). Another spiritualist association also mentioned by Karlsson,Stockholms Spiritualistiska Förening (SSF), is active in the Stockholmregion and has some kind of activity at least once a week (SSF 2004).SRAU and SSR are reported to have had up to 1000 members in1998 (Frisk 1998: 34), and the reported number of professionalmediums was likewise around 1000 in the early 1990s (Arlebrand1995: 80).The interest in Old Norse cultic sites and symbolism is great in14 Phrenology was a school of science popular in the 19th and early 20thcenturies which proposed that it was possible to draw conclusions about thecharacteristics of a human being on the basis of the shape of that person’s skull.Phrenology worked on blatantly racist premises."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"105CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDSweden, although practised neopaganism is probably concentratedmore to the southern regions of the country. Liselotte Frisk notesthat there are several Asatrú organizations in Sweden, most of themonly numbering a handful of members (Frisk 1998: 149). Asdiscussed in section 2.1.6, there are both racist and anti-racistHeathen organizations. Frisk describes Sveriges Asatrosamfund [theSwedish Asatrú Society], which requires its members to adopt anon-racist and democratic stance. The society was founded in 1994,based on an interest in Old Norse customs, beliefs and religion andis mainly an umbrella-organization for a number of smallerindependent groups. The society had an estimated 250 members,of whom 40 percent were women, in 1998. (Frisk 1998: 149-150).Fredrik Skott describes a number of other Heathen groupsactive in Sverige (Skott 2000: 50-57). Breidablikk-Gildet, founded in1975, is the oldest existing Heathen organization in Sweden. Theregulations of the guild state that the end-goal is the revival ofAsatrú as a religion, in a form suitable for the modern world. Theguild has had a diminishing membership since its heyday in thelate 1980s, when it had about 130 members, and now only involvesa handful of active members.An interesting chapter in the ‘life-and-times’ of SwedishHeathenism is Svitjods Asa-Gilde, founded in 1990, and laterfashioned into Fröjslunds Världshus. In contrast to other neopaganorganizations, this one is ruled by one central authority-figure.Fröjslunds Världshus is also not strictly Asatrú, as it is not the Aesirrace of gods that are at the centre of worship, but rather the fertilitygods, the Vanir, among whom Frey is especially revered.Samfälligheten för Nordisk Sed was founded in 1997 as a nationalorganization for those practising Old Norse customs or religion,and was accepted as a registered religious body in March, 2000.Doing his research, Skott found few Asatrú organizations whichare openly racist. He gives one as an example, Svensk Hednisk Front[Swedish Heathen Front]. The homepage of the organizationconveys a somewhat aggressive impression, although it is statedthat the organization is not militant and that what is important isthe Nordic heritage in spirit and soul as well as nature (see HeathenFront 2004). Skott estimates that there are 600-700 Swedes who aremembers of Heathen organizations and a still greater number of"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"106CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDpeople who identify themselves as Heathen but who are notmembers of any organization (Skott 2000: 49).Wicca, as noted earlier, is the most popular form ofneopaganism. Recourse to the popular search-engine, Google, gave963.000 hits, whereas in comparison searches such as Christianitygave 5.670.000 hits, Islam 9.270.000 hits, Catholicism 801.000 hits,Satanism 232.000 hits, Asatru 63.000 hits, Magick 909.000 hits anda pop music icon like Kylie Minogue 982.000 hits15. Of course, figuressuch as these give no real indication of the number of people actuallyinvolved in a phenomenon, but do indeed give some pointers as tohow much public interest the phenomenon in question invokes. Asthe Internet is global, since there is no real functional way to restrictone’s web-searches on a national plane, similar figures are nighimpossible to provide for Sweden. A guiding example could be theSwedish link-collection Fjalar, which in the category of Religion andPhilosophy lists 66 major websites, out of which 20 deal with Wiccaor Witchcraft in some way or another (“Fjalar” 2004).In an inquiry instigated by the Swedish Ministry of Health andSocial Affairs the following Wicca or Witchcraft groups arementioned: Court of Joy Coven with 52 members; Häxagon with about40 members, Svenska Vitkaförbundet with about 80 members and 21Swedish members of the Pagan Federation (SOU 1998: 61). This wouldamount to less than 200 Swedish Wiccans and witches. There arehowever other witchcraft organizations, and many witches are notmembers of any organization whatsoever.Neoshamanism is very popular in the Swedish alternativespiritual milieu. As mentioned earlier, neoshamanism crosses theboundaries between ‘New Age’ and neopaganism, and functionsas a religious activity employed by adherents within both fields.Galina Lindquist identifies Jörgen I. Eriksson and Mikael Gejel astwo founding figures of neoshamanism in Sweden (Lindquist 1997:28-29). The Yggdrasil guild, an association with the goal of developinga Nordic type of shamanism, was founded by Gejel amongst othersin the mid 1970s. At around the same time, in 1976, the first issue ofthe magazine Gimle, also dealing with shamanic issues, waspublished (see Gejel 1996). Mikael Gejel, along with Jörgen I.15 The search was done on the 6th of November 2004."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"107CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDEriksson, was among those behind the publication. The first fourissues of Gimle had the subtitle “the magazine for the wisdom ofEdda”, and it was not until issue five that the subtitle “a magazinefor shamanism” appeared. Another group called Yggdrasil wasfounded by Eriksson in 1982 and this time the group was moreformalized. The activities and goals of the group were positivelyvalued by the Swedish mass media. The main theme of the magazineGimle was “the Nordic Heritage” but subjects such as Hinduismand Tantrism were also dealt with. (Lindquist 1997: 28-52). Yggdrasilwas incorporated into the Merlin Order in 1994 (Gejel 1996).In an article in the 20th anniversary-issue of Gimle, Jörgen IEriksson presents four phases in the history of the magazine(Eriksson 1996: 7-9). Phase one consisted of issues one through fourand focused on Ancient Norse myths, runes and, to a small extent,shamanism. Phase two, consisting of issues five through eleven, ischaracterized as the “Shaman issues” and indicated a shift topractised neoshamanism. This was also the period when JörgenEriksson and Mikael Hedlund became part of the editorial board.Eriksson calls stage three, issues 12-16, the “Miscellaneous phase”indicating a more directionless time. The scientific phase of themagazine, issues 17-22, marked a new creative direction and anattempt to publish a more professional magazine. Issue number 1/2004 of the magazine includes articles on Sufism, Nordic spirituality,the connection between music and ecstasy, a presentation of thenew religious body Moder Jord [Mother Earth] – in which the Vanirfamily of fertility gods are worshipped, and reviews of two books –one dealing with Druidry and the other with Carlos Castaneda(Gimle 2004).There are few studies on the history of ‘New Age’ spiritualityin Sweden. I will therefore have to confine my presentation to avery short account by Owe Wikström (Wikström 1998: 34-35). In1966, Klubb Kamelen, a club organizing diverse alternative religioushappenings, was opened in the Old City of Stockholm.The 1960s also saw the start of the ‘New Age’ magazine, Sökaren,and the early 1970s the opening of the alternative spiritual bookshop, Vattumannen. In 1974, the major Swedish newspaper SvenskaDagbladet issued a section called Idagsidan, which has been calledthe “New Age-page” (Ahlin 2001: 146-147). A magazine called"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"108CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDNexus, which had some connection with the Human PotentialMovement, was started in 1976 (Wikström 1998: 34).Several centres for alternative spiritual topics were opened inStockholm in the early 1980s. Tomas Frankell has been an importantfigure in the alternative spiritual milieu of Stockholm and he is theinstigator behind two of the more important of the above mentionedcentres, Café Vega – opened in 1980, and Café Pan – opened in 1983(Frankell 2004). In 1990, Frankell started Deva Center, a centre andmeeting-point for alternative spiritual matters – with courses andlectures on the programme schedule (Frankell 2004). Anotherimportant meeting-point is Wäxthuset Väddö, opened in 1976, acentre for personal development according to the official homepage(Wäxthuset 2004).‘New Age’ spirituality is spread to a high degree through theprinted medium. Jenny-Ann Brodin identifies four ‘New Age’magazines which she deems to be of importance, although she doesaknowledge the existence of several others. Sökaren is the oldest ofthe Swedish ‘New Age’ magazines, published since 196416. The focusof the magazine is wide, and it had a circulation of about 1700 copiesper issue in 1998. Alpha Omega has been published since 1995. Themagazine struggled with economic difficulties in the late 1990s andwas amalgamated with the magazine, Quintessens, in 2001, in orderto secure the future of the aforementioned. Energivågen is a freemagazine, financed by advertisement revenues, published since1982 and with a circulation of 20.000-22.000 copies per issue,according to the editorial board. Nexus Nya Tider, a Swedish variantof the Australian Nexus New Times, was published from 1998 to2000. (Brodin 2001: 73-74).Articles in issues of Alpha Omega published from 1999 to 2002deal with various subjects. Among them are interviews with popartists who profess to a ‘New Age’ lifestyle, articles on healing andalternative medicine – as well as a critique of institutional medicalscience, alternative economic science, relationships and sexuality,16 According to Owe Wikström the first issue of Sökaren was published in1969 (see Wikström 1998: 34). Although Brodin places the start of Sökaren at1964, she also names the year 1969 as the starting point in another section of herPhD thesis (see Brodin 2001: 27, 73).

Withthe merging of the magazines Alpha Omega and Quintessens in issue4/5 2000 of Alpha Omega, articles focusing on magic, witchcraft andnature religion were included (Alpha Omega 2000c; 2001a; 2001b;2002a; 2002b). The magazine Quintessens was more focused on magicand mythology (Quintessens 2000a; 2000b). The great range of ‘NewAge’ becomes clear when one reads the advertisements in AlphaOmega. Issue 5/1999 has about 27 pages of advertisements, in amagazine with 84 pages in total17 (see Alpha Omega 1999).The alternative spiritual bookstore, Vattumannen (Aquarius),is a focal point for Swedish esoteric spirituality. Vattumannen wasoriginally opened in 1972 in the city of Uppsala, 75 kilometres northof Stockholm, but moved to the country’s capital in 1973 (Hammer1997: 81). Accounts by Wikström and Brodin give the opening yearof the bookshop as 1969 (Wikström 1998: 34; Brodin 2001: 27), butthe homepage of the bookstore states that 1972 is indeed the correctyear (Vattumannen 2004). Many of the key Swedish neoshamanshave been active in the bookshop in one way or another (seeLindquist 1997: 10, 29), including the publication of severalneoshaman works under the label of Vattumannen publishing (seeHedlund, Gejel, Eriksson & Eriksson 1988; Eriksson 1988; Sørsenssen1990; Grimsson 1990). There are several other alternative spiritualbookshops in the Stockholm region but Vattumannen is the mostprominent. With its mail-order service the bookshop effectivelyreaches out to the whole of the Swedish alternative spiritual milieu,instead of being limited to the Stockholm region. Of course thebookshop caters to the interests of ‘New Agers’ as well, in additionto being highly involved in the neoshaman movement.There are several orders in Sweden, most of which are modelled17 Among the advertisements are invitations to seminars, courses, retreatsand fairs; information about various spiritual groups and organizations;information on books and music for meditation; the advertisements of differenthealing- and self-development professionals and information on Tarot specialistsand Astrologists (Alpha Omega 1999).

I will only discuss a few of the magically orientedbriefly. AMORC (Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosae [Rubeae etAureae] Crucis) is a Rosicrucian18 order founded in the United Statesof America in 1915 by Harvey Spencer Lewis (Arlebrand 1995: 188).The order was established in Sweden in 1933 (Arnell 2004), and isreported to have had about 100 Swedish members in the mid 1990s(SOU 1998: 62; Arlebrand 1995: 189). Members of AMORC areengaged in the study of esoteric natural laws and work throughcorrespondence courses as well as in lodges, which exist in Onsala,Stockholm, Jönköping and Lund (Arlebrand 1995: 189-190; Arnell2004).Ordo Templi Orientis, briefly discussed in section 2.1.4, hasSwedish sections as well19. The order has official lodges inStockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö and Roslagen. No officialinformation on the number of members is given on the Swedishwebsite of the order (see OTO 2004). The Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn (see section 2.1.3) consists of several different fractionswhich all claim to be the true inheritors of the original order. GoldenDawn is represented in Stockholm and Gothenburg (Arnell 2004)as the outer order of the Rosicrucian Order of Alpha+Omega, whichclaims to be the original Golden Dawn restored in 1999 (see A+O2004a). The order has an Internet-based initiation system, whichmakes it possible for members who do not have a temple in theirregion to advance through the degrees (see A+O 2004b).Svenska Satanistkyrkan (Swedish Satanist Church) is one of themore Satanicallly oriented magic orders. The order was founded asthe Satanic Order by a Tommie Eriksson in 1996 (Arnell 2004), andwas renamed, and possibly reformed, in 1998 (SvenskaSatanistkyrkan 2004). Important to note is that the founder of thischurch is not the same Tommie Eriksson who is mentionedelsewhere in the present work. The goal of the church, as given onthe official website, is to be an interest-organization for Satanistsand to explore the hidden aspects of existence in order to effect18 See chapter 2.1.1 for more information on Rosicrucianism.19 Ordo Templi Orientis was established in Sweden in 1990 according to thetimeline given on the website for Fraternal Orders in Sweden (Arnell 2004)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"111CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDself-evolvement (Svenska Satanistkyrkan 2004). The order isreported to have 370 members (Arnell 2004), but I am very scepticalabout accounts of such a high number of members.The Left Hand Path-order Temple of Set20 is represented inSweden by a few members (according to Arlebrand 1995: 117; SOU1998: 65). The homepage of the Swedish section of this organizationstates that the first Swedish member joined in 1993 and that thefirst Swedish Pylon was founded in 1997 (Temple of Set 2004). Thehomepage does not, however, seem to have been updated for severalyears and I can therefore not make any comments on recentdevelopments of Temple of Set in Sweden.20 Temple of Set was founded in 1975 by Michael Aquino, who had earlierbeen an influential member of the Church of Satan. Aquino identified Set as theentity that dictated the Book of the Law for Aleister Crowley (see chapter 2.1.3)and the year 1966 as the start of the Aeon of Satan.

In thefollowing section I will briefly discuss a few key terms in the studyof societal transformation, focusing on late modernity, globalization,glocalization and transnational connections, secularization and thetransformation of religiosity, as well as on identity andindividuality.What the theorists do not agree on are the exact characteristicsof this present condition and how the situation should be designated.Some theorists, following the view of Jean-Francois Lyotard andFrancis Fukuyama, are of the opinion that we have moved beyondthe age of modernity into something which can be calledpostmodernity (see Giddens 1990: 2-3; 1997: 528-529). Others,following the trend set by Anthony Giddens, see this condition asmodernity taken to its extremes and call it Late, High or Accentuatedmodernity (Giddens 1990: 45-53; 1996; 1997: 528-529). Yet othershave arrived at a middle ground, such as Zygmunt Bauman, whocalls the present condition postmodernity but still views it as a phaseof modernity21 (Bauman 1997b: 3; see also 1992: viii, xvii-xviii). Oncould perhaps say that postmodernity is modernity viewing itselfcritically (see for example Bråkenhielm 2004: 1). What is agreed uponto a large extent are the particularities of modernity.Anthony Giddens defines modernity as the “modes of sociallife or organisation which emerged in Europe from about theseventeenth century onwards and which subsequently became moreor less worldwide in their influence” (Giddens 1990: 1). What gaverise to modernity were the enlightenment ideals and the industrialrevolution, leading to an utterly different form of social order withlarge-scale global implications (Giddens 1997: 55; 1990: 4).Industrialization and the new means for livelihood provided by21 Bauman earlier had a more radical view on postmodernity, as shown byWaters et al. (Waters, Pakulski & Crook 1992: 2)."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"113CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDthis development resulted in urbanization. The cities grew vastlylarger and the countryside was to a large degree depopulated.Modern society gave rise to a different political system as well. Themonarchs and emperors of old were replaced by parliamentary andgovernmental institutions (Waters, Pakulski & Crook 1992: 18-19).The idea of the Nation State was born in the amassment of thepopulation in centralized regions under the rule of a more rationallyorganized political system. (Giddens 1997: 55-56; see Giddens 1990:14). The modern project was above all one of creating order, ratherthan abiding by traditional society’s acceptance of the disorderly(Bauman 2000b: 63).The term postmodernity was formulated by Jean-FrancoisLyotard in his The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge(Lyotard 1984), in which he argues for the rejection of the ‘GrandNarrative’, often discussed as the ‘End of History’ by other scholars,such as Francis Fukuyama (Giddens 1990: 2; 1997: 528-529). ‘GrandNarrative’ as a concept refers to the modern project of assigning ateleological aspect to history, evolution and other large-scaletheoretical ways to view and interpret both the human and thenatural world. In simple terms, the modern ‘Grand Narrative’-perspective ascribed a beginning (and an end) to things worldly,moving through processes of cultural, moral and natural (etc.)evolution towards a perfect state. Progress in itself is a most modernway of interpreting things and events.Other than viewing the present period as part of modernity oras something succeeding it, moderate accounts of postmodernityand of late modernity are to a high degree similar. The maindifferences between theorizing postmodernity and late modernityhave to do with the epistemological basis of each view, regardingthe possibilities of gaining systematic knowledge about socialorganization (see Giddens 1990: 2). High modernity is, accordingto Anthony Giddens, characterized by an ambivalent attitudetowards the institutions and self-evidents of modernity (Giddens1996: 27-28). The earlier hegemonic ideologies of reason,technological progress and institutional order are seen to have failedto fulfil their promises (see Giddens 1990: 10). The rule of reasonand rationality has largely disenchanted the modern world and,according to some opinions, made life more dull, uninspiring and,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"114CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDwith the removal of the possibility of an afterlife, more desperate(see Bauman 1992: x-xi; Bauman 2000b: 58).Technological progress has made life easier and has increasedthe relative wealth of the average person. At the same time it ishowever felt that there are a great number of people who have notbeen reached by the prospects of technological advancement. Thenegative aspects of technological progress have become apparentin ecological catastrophes and modern warfare. Whilst beingsuccessful in making the juridical system fairer and life moreordered, institutions have also been afflicted by excessivebureaucracy. In addition, all humans are still not equal under thelaw. The capitalist economic system has brought with it a generalcommodification of all of life, resulting in a situation where all andeverything is for sale for the right price, ranging from emotionsthrough material goods to people. In fact, shopping has becomethe pattern which the totality of our life is modelled on. (Bauman2000a: 73-80). The disillusionment with the modern grand narrativeof progress has led to a general rejection of the absolute authoritativestatus of the modern institutions of science, medicine and moraljurisdiction. These formerly hegemonic institutions have had tosettle on being alternatives amongst many others. (see Bauman 1992:viii-x, xvii-xxii).Following Ulrich Beck, Giddens identifies modernity, especiallyin its late phase, as a risk culture (Giddens 1996: 3-5, 28-30; 1990:34-36). Life in a late modern society is not more dangerous than inpre-modern society but the multiple choices and their unpredictableconsequences propose that virtually every human effort is to beseen as a risk taken. From this it follows that the characteristics oflife in a late modern society are greatly different from life in atraditional society, where people just did not have as much leewaywith regard to their life-choices.Waters et al. identify the processes of differentiation,rationalization and commodification as those which gave rise tomodernity (Waters, Pakulski & Crook 1992: 16-18). Differentiationand rationalization on a political, economic and cultural levelproduced specialized expertise, a situation in which the commoncitizen no longer had insight into the fields of life which affectedhim/her. The above two processes in turn fuelled the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"115CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDcommodification of culture. Waters et al. are careful in pointingout that these processes, and societal change, did not stop withmodernity (Waters, Pakulski & Crook 1992: 16). In postmodernitythese processes have intensified to the level of cultural, economicand political fragmentation. The postmodern hyper-differentiationhas given rise to a sort of de-differentiation where different culturalforms co-exist and flow into each other (Waters, Pakulski & Crook1992: 36-37).Globalization is a major trend of late modernity. Common tothe different theories in the field is the view that the phenomenonof globalization has started to accelerate recently. (Waters 1995: 4;Martikainen 2004: 41). Globalization is defined by Roland Robertsonas a ‘compression of the world’ combined with the increasing viewof the world as one interconnected place (see Robertson 1992: 8;Waters 1995: 3). As clarified by Jonathan Friedman, this refers bothto increased global interdependency and an awareness of thisinterdependency (Friedman 1995: 70). The compression of the worldstems from the immediacy of connections between people, ideasand objects made possible through technological progress (seeFriedman 1995: 70). Important technologies in this regard are, forexample, communication technology, such as Internet-relayedcommunication, and advanced transportation technology, such asmore affordable and faster travel and transportation (see Waters1995: 33-36). These technological advancements have made themobility of people, objects and ideas both fast and easy as thelimitations brought on by distance in space and time have beengreatly diminished.The awareness of the world as one place is directly linked tothe immediacy of human communication and contact. With theincreasingly transnational character of interpersonal relations comesthe realization that our actions have far-reaching consequences,much more than just affecting our immediate physical vicinity (seeFriedman 1995: 70). For example, ecological catastrophes are nolonger viewed simply as regional or national issues but rather asglobal concerns22. Experiencing the world as one big interconnected22 The Tsunami-catastrophe which occurred in South-East Asia on 26thDecember, 2004, is a very illuminating example of the globalizing dimensions"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"116CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDplace has also come to erode the hegemonic idea of the nation state,at least to some degree (see Waters 1995: 27).In analyses of globalization the phenomenon is usually dividedinto three major categories: the globalization of economy, cultureand politics (see Waters 1995: 7-8). These three areas are of coursedeeply interwoven. Global economy refers to the expansion ofcapitalist business ventures beyond the nation state as well as tothe state of transnational corporations and economic networks notbeing bound to any specific nation state at all. Globalization ofpolitics refers to the way in which international politics start to treatthe world as the major arena of political life, instead of focusing onthe national. For example, whereas earlier wars have largely beenthe issue of those nations directly involved in them, the recent warsin Iraq and Afghanistan, waged mostly by the United States,politically involved the whole of the Western World. Theglobalization of culture refers to the expansion of national culturalinfluence to a global scale. Ways of life, literature, music and artetc. originated in one cultural sphere come to affect other far-offcultural spheres and vice versa. Malcolm Waters approaches thesethree dimensions through various concepts of exchange. Materialexchanges, referring to the dimension of economics, have alocalizing tendency in that the manufacture of material goodsmainly unites people on a local production-based arena. Politicalexchanges have an internationalizing tendency inasmuch as theystem from the demarcation of extended regions into nation statesand result in dealings between different nation states. Symbolicexchanges, referring to the cultural dimension, have a globalizingtendency in that they are not bound by space and time and dealwith products that may easily claim and invoke universalsignificance (Waters 1995: 9).National focus was important in modernity, replacing theof contemporary natural catastrophes. Reports of the incident, which by 17thJanuary, 2005, was estimated to have claimed at least 175.000 lives (MTV 3 2005),reached Western Europe within moments of the actual incident. Massive massmedia coverage erupted, and people very geographically distant to the eventfelt deeply affected by it. This was partly due to people’s own experiences ofthe locations affected, and partly due to the immediacy and closeness the mediacoverage conveyed."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"117CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDregional focus of traditional society. With the focus on the global atthe expense of the national, regionality has become important again.In Friedman’s words, one can identify the ‘universalization ofparticularism’ and the ‘particularization of universalism’ as twoconnected processes in globalization (Friedman 1995: 72). In theworld of alternative spirituality shamanism is a good example ofindigenous regionally limited religious practices having beenelevated to a global and universal plane. The creation of strictlynationalized variants of world religion is an example of the universalbeing made unique. Roland Robertson has introduced the termglocalization, a concept originating largely in Japanese businessculture (Robertson 1995: 28-32). Glocalization could be defined asthe globalization of localities, and is something which Robertsonsees as a key notion in the process of globalization. Instead of ahomogenous global world-culture, we have a mass of heterogeneousinterconnected localities, not necessarily but possibly disembeddedfrom their original localities of conception.Transnational connections is another key term in globalizationtheories. Ulf Hannerz criticizes the common use of the termglobalization for “just about any process or relationship thatsomehow crosses state boundaries” (Hannerz 1996: 6; see also Smith2001: 3-5). Transnational refers to connections which are notnecessarily global in extent, and which are not international in themeaning of involving nations as agents. Certain musical andreligious subcultures as well as grassroots political activism offergood examples of transnational connections. Musical subgenres mayoften unite its members so that a heavy metal fan in Sweden mayhave like-minded acquaintances in South America, Italy and Russiawho he/she communicates with via Internet relayed chat andperhaps meets in person if an interesting concert makes the pathsof all four converge.Secularization was discussed at length in the context ofsociology and the sociology of religion from the late 1970s onwardsand became a major issue in the 1980s23. Although still beingdiscussed, the issue of secularization has largely given way to23 The death of religion was prophesized by one of the founding fathers ofsociology, Max Weber."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"118CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTIONtreatments of religion and spirituality after secularization. Thetheories of secularization deal with the diminishing influence ofreligion on a societal and individual plane. This development stemsfrom the characteristics imbued in the late modern condition, withthe decline of institutional religious authority along with otherinstitutional authorities. Secularization does not, however, entailthe decline of religiosity per se, as early theorists in the subject areathought.Anthony Giddens identifies three dimensions of secularization,to be regarded as three different ways of indexing and treating thephenomenon. First, there is the level of official commitment andattendance to institutional religion. Approaching the issue at handthrough these spectacles one arrives at the conclusion that religiosityhas declined. On the second level, the social influence of institutionalreligion, the conclusions are similar. In most Western countrieschurch officials no longer have political power or increased socialprestige on the basis of their church affiliation. The third and finaldimension, which Giddens calls “the dimension of religiosity”, isthe most relevant one for the present study. What is underinvestigation is not so much institutional, or in other wordstraditional, religion as people’s views on spiritual matters and theirreligious investment, both privately and in religious organizations.(Giddens 1997: 465-466).According to Giddens, religiosity has diminished in all threedimensions of religiosity. I do not agree totally. While institutionalreligion has experienced a general decline in adherence, attendanceand social influence, spiritual matters are still of importance to mostWestern people. Wouter Hanegraaff treats secularization not as adecline or marginalization of religion, but rather as a transformationof religion (Hanegraaff 2003: 358-359), much akin to Heelas’ conceptof ‘religion-cum-spirituality’ (see Heelas 2002).In discussing the shift from religion to spirituality, Paul Heelasnotes that religion is “life informed by ‘supra-self’ tradition”,meaning traditions conveyed and authorised by dogmatic sourcesindependent of the religious individual. Spirituality is thesacralization of life itself, and is not dependent on any specificauthoritative dogmas beyond the individual. (Heelas 2002: 358-359,375). Alternative spirituality, with its characteristics most apparent"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"119CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDin what is called the ‘New Age movement’ (see section 2.1.5), isthriving (see Heelas 2002: 361-364), whereas the traditional nationalchurches are not (see Sundback 2000: 47-48). In addition toalternative spirituality, ‘Theistic Spiritualities of Life’, as definedby Heelas, are also flourishing. Theistic spiritualities of life are setin traditional religious contexts, mostly in protestant churches, andare outwardly no different from other traditional religiosity. Whatdiffers is where the religious individual as a rule places authority.Biblical authority is still important, but, as in ‘New Age’spiritualities, personal experiences of the divine are important aswell. As Heelas puts it, ‘purity of heart’ is felt to be more importantthan ‘purity of doctrine’. (Heelas 2002: 366-369).The final key issue of recent sociological theory that I discussin the present context is the question of identity. Late modern societycreates new possibilities, as well as difficulties, in regard to identitywhen compared to early modern and traditional societies. Latemodern society is a ‘risk-society’, as discussed earlier, wheremultiple choices are to be made in every field of life. Identity is nodifferent. Late modern individuals are involved in a task of identityconstruction which lacks real precedence in traditional society (seeBauman 2000b: 145-147). Anthony Giddens calls this reflexive self-identity, which means processes where individuals more or lessconsciously make choices regarding their own identity (Giddens1996). Giddens’ account of a reflexive identity construction has beencriticized on the grounds that it places too much emphasis on theconscious decision-making of the individual (see Lövheim 2003).Other identity theorists, such as Stuart Hall, do not lay as muchemphasis on conscious choices regarding identity construction (seeHall 1996; 2002; see also Jenkins 1996). The common view on identityin late modern society is that of identity as a process. Identity is notacquired as the resultant combination of biological factors and earlysocialization, thereafter remaining unchanged under theindividual’s adult life. Instead, identity changes in the course of aperson’s progress and experiences throughout life (see Bauman2000b: 144). It would perhaps be more correct to talk of identitiesrather than of identity, as the individual is not defined by oneidentity only. In the view of identity as a process, the individualhas many identities, corresponding to the different fields of his/"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"120CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDher life. (Bauman 2000b: 147).A topic which has not yet received its own theoreticalelaboration, but which has been under discussion in all the abovetreated theory-building, is the question of individuality.Individuality is a thoroughly modern issue, and one which has onlybeen accentuated in late modern times (see Bauman 1997b: 2-3).Whereas the social group was the main category in traditionalsociety, the individual is the main category in modern and latemodern societies. To illustrate this difference one could say that intraditional society the social group consisted of persons who wereassigned identity first and foremost on the grounds of the socialgroup, whereas in modern society social groups consist ofindividuals who first and foremost are individuals and collectivelydefine the social group. Following in the footsteps of Max Weberand Louis Dumont, Andreas Buss regards protestant Christianityas a key element in bringing the individual to the front (Buss 2000).All of the tendencies discussed above give rise to large-scalechanges for religious life. Modernity entailed a desacralization ofthe world, replacing enchantment with reason and rationality.Protestant Christianity, having according to Max Weber given riseto capitalism (Weber 1965), adapted to the ideals and trends of thetime. Approaching the late modern period, faith in moderninstitutions began to fade and this was the case with traditionalreligious institutions as well. While official church membership maynot have dropped drastically in the Scandinavian countries, churchattendance, and with it the social and moral influence of the church,certainly has24. With the shifting of focus from the community tothe individual, and from the afterlife to the here-and-now, religionfocusing on impersonal authoritative dogmas became less popular.Self-spirituality with a focus on life itself and with a directexperiencing of the divine came to thrive. Spirituality, instead ofreligion, became a means for the individual to progress throughthe difficult process of identity construction. With the risks inherentin the plurality of choices in late modern life the re-enchantment of24 In a study carried out in the Nordic countries in 1997-1998, 87 percent ofthe Swedish informants were members of the Lutheran national church,although only 14,5 percent of them attend church at least once a month and 27percent never attend church (Sundback 2000: 47-48)."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"121CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUNDthe world provided a welcomed escape from the clutches of a finitematerial existence.Globalizing and glocalizing tendencies have made the sourcematerial for the construction of one’s own spiritual path compelling,easily accessible and indeed both bewildering and rewarding formany Western individuals. With the advancement ofcommunication technologies the spiritual individual is no longerbound to his/her geographical locality in the search of like-mindedpeople. The Internet is flooded with information and spiritualalternatives for those willing to seek. Internet chat-rooms provideample feedback and response to those who wish to communicatetheir experiences. For those attracted to the security of traditionthis alternative has gained new ground in the late modern period.The Christian individual may belong to a church of his choice andstill be allowed, and able, to access personal experiences of thedivine. The authoritative scriptures are still authoritative, but notat the expense of a personal connection to the divine sphere.As Dragon Rouge came into existence in late modern times theabovementioned societal factors have naturally affected theformation, organization and development of the order.

I also take a look atpossible implications of dark magical philosophy on morality andethics. Characteristic traits of the basic overview provided withinDragon Rouge will be dealt with specifically later on in the discourseanalytical section in chapter 7. The philosophical considerationsstem from Dragon Rouge material and express the Dragon Rougeview on things.3.1 Dark Magic – Will, Power and ActionMagic is the name given to the methods by which a human canapproach and control the unknown. The unknown is dark from ourperspective. To call magic dark indicates that it is about researchingand awakening things that lie outside the structure we are situatedin. (Eriksson 2001: 2).The most common term applied by the members to the kind of magicpracticed in Dragon Rouge is Dark Magic. Other frequent terms areDraconian25 Magic or just plainly and simply Magic. The situationaluse of the terms varies slightly. When the term Dark Magic is used,the focus is usually on the “exploration of the unknown”, in one’sown psyche as well as in the manifest cosmos and in the unmanifestchaos (see Eriksson 2001: 2). The Light – Dark dichotomy plays animportant role in Dragon Rouge. According to Dragon Rougemembers the embracing of “the dark” by no means involves anyform of moral judgment. The terms light and dark are simply usedto indicate the focus on the known parts of our universe and on the25 “The Draconian Current” is presented by Kenneth Grant (see section2.1.4) as the ancient, true form of spirituality (Grant 1994a; 1994b)."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"124CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSunknown parts. Magicians of Dragon Rouge also stress that workingwith the dark does not entail leaving out the light. In fact, many ofmy informants consider this to be something almost impossible, orif possible, then very dangerous and not very productive (see IFmgt 2001/13; 47). The common view is that the dark magicianstrenghtens his/her existing structures, the light aspects of his/herexistence, in order to cope with approaching the hidden,unconscious and dark aspects.When asked to give a definition of magic, most of myinformants have resorted to some variation of Aleister Crowley’sfamous definition “Magick is the Science and Art of causing Changeto occur in conformity with Will” (Crowley 1977: 131). Differentvariations on this definition given by members of Dragon Rougeare: “Magic is the ability to influence things in accordance withone’s will” (IF 2001/1:9)26, “[Magic is] the technique to change realityin accordance to my will, by other-worldly means” (IF 2001/1:7)27and “[Magic is] to get things to happen in accordance with one’swishes, by using the Will” (IF 2001/1:2)28.In the members’ paper the following quotation from RichardWagner’s Revolution is regarded as the “guiding principle of thenew age”: “Personal will should be man’s master, personal lust hisonly law, personal power his sole possession, for only the freehuman is holy and nothing is above him” (Dragon Rouge 2000a29).This quotation does indeed sum up Dragon Rouge and its brand ofdark magic very well. As emerges from the extract the will (in thiscase the individual’s True or Higher Will), lust (the libido or life-lust of man, mostly referred to as the Kundalini) and power (magical26 “Magi är förmågan att påverka saker i enlighet med sin vilja.” (also IF2001/1:4).27 “[Magi är] Tekniken att förändra verkligheten i enlighet med min vilja,med icke-världsliga medel.”.28 “[Magi är] Att med viljan få händelser att ske enligt ens önskningar”.These definitions of magic demonstrate Hanegraaff’s notion of secularesotericism, or occultism (see section 2.1). Although the view on magic is notmechanistic in any extensive way in Dragon Rouge, mechanistic definitions arenonetheless used here.29 The original quotation in Swedish reads as follows: “Den egna viljan börvara människans herre, den egna lusten hennes enda lag, egen kraft hela hennesegendom, ty endast den fria människan är helig och ingenting är högre än hon”."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"125CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSpower as a quality making the magician able to lead his or her lifein accordance with his/her Will, as well as giving him opportunityto seek the knowledge he or she needs and desires) are centralthemes. Not explicitly stated, but clearly included in the implicitmessage of the quotation, is the importance of controlling one’s ownlife. The article includes the following statement: “... magic can giveus the power to become creators of the future, instead of beingcreations of the past” (Dragon Rouge 2000a30).Dragon Rouge also frequently utilizes a passage from the EgyptianBook of the Dead in which Khepera is identified as the “self-created” or“the great god who created himself” (see Budge 1960: 72, 93, 150;referred to in Karlsson 2001: xi). These quotations reflect the purposeof Draconian, or dark, magic to ‘transmute the practitioner in analchemical process’. The Dragon Rouge magic-system is, in fact,viewed as an alchemical path of progress leading the practitioner toidentify his higher self or true Will, polish/grind his person and thuseventually ending up with the pure essence of himself (often describedas the “Black Diamond”), thus becoming one with his or her true Will(Karlsson 2001: xi).The Will is, as one can see, a central theme. Thomas Karlssonand others define magic as the art or philosophy of Will (IF mgt2001: 11; 13; see Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 2). Like Crowley, however,Dragon Rouge makes a distinction between the ordinary, moremundane will, and a magic, inner, and True Will. The true Will isseen to be the essence of the magician, sometimes also likened tothe Daemon or the magician’s Higher Self. The Daemon is also likenedto the person’s power animal, in accordance with North Americantribal religions.In order to attain a clearer view regarding what Dragon Rougemeans by the term Dark Magic it is useful to first take intoconsideration what the organization means by light, or white, magic.Light magic is seen as working with the known structures of thecosmos, as well as with the magician’s consciousness. The whitemagician’s aim is interpreted to be, in Dragon Rouge use of Judeo-Christian symbolism, to repair and re-establish the original divine30 “... kan magin ge oss kraft att bli skapare av framtiden, istället för attvara skapelser av det förgångna”."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"126CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSorder lost in the fall of man, or to quote Thomas Karlsson “tostrengthen or re-establish an imagined ideal original order”(Karlsson 2001: x31). One way of putting it, using the samemonotheistic references as above, would be that the white magiciantries to find his or her way back to God. The dark magician of DragonRouge has a different goal. He or she wants to, again in symbolicJudeo-Christian terminology, continue on the road pointed out bythe serpent in the Garden of Eden. In Dragon Rouge the myth ofthe fall of man is intrepreted differently than in traditional Judaismand Christianity. The Serpent in the Garden of Eden is understoodto be a culture-bringer, similar to, for example, Prometheus. LikePrometheus, the Serpent’s symbolic significance is in showing manhis potential of becoming like God, by letting him eat of the fruit ofknowledge (see Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 4). Thus, symbolically, mantook the first steps towards becoming a god when he stepped outof the Garden.In the Dragon Rouge view, the white magician works with thecreated world, God’s world, not wanting to touch, or deal with, theunmanifest chaos, or his/her own unconsciousness for that matter.He/she strengthens the existing structures and values in the worldas well as in his/her mind. The Dragon Rouge dark magician alsoworks with existing structures – in fact it is quite difficult if notimpossible to do without them, my informants say, since they buildup our world as we perceive it – but he/she also works with chaos,the unmanifest, from which – according to this view – our manifestuniverse was crafted (IF mgt 2001/47). He/ she wants to “breakborders and find new unique paths in which the magician does notserve the plans of some god, but becomes a god and creator himself”(Karlsson 2001: x32). The truly unknown is regarded to exist in ourminds as well, as the subconscious parts of our psyche. By utilizingchaos, seen as the destructive or fragmentary forces in the universe,the magician edeavours to take things apart, including him-/herself,in order to be able to build something new of the parts, this time byusing the creative forces of existence.31 “att stärka eller återetablera en tänkt idealisk ursprungsordning”.32 “bryta gränser och finna nya unika vägar där magikern inte tjänar enguds planer, utan själv blir en gud och skapare”."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"127CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSChaos is viewed as containing all the possibilities of existence,as elements not yet manifested. The dark magician is supposed tobe able to utilize this potential and manifest what he/she wants tomanifest, by tapping into the forces of chaos. The order views Chaosas the origin of everything, in the pre-form of potential not yetmanifested. To illustrate this, Dragon Rouge uses the mythologiesof a vast number of religions. An example, taken from theBabylonian creation-saga, identifies Tiamat and Apsu with theprimordial chaos and Marduk with the bringer of order. In theBabylonian epic the manifest universe is created out of Tiamat’sbody, that is to say, out of chaos. Dragon Rouge also identifiesTiamat as the red dragon, along with many other primordial beastsof various mythologies, such as Leviathan, the serpent, and in someaspects, Satan in the Bible. All these primordial beasts have thefunction of existing before order was brought into the universe, infact, before the universe as we know it was created at all. They allrepresent chaos and, in the view of Dragon Rouge, immense powerand potential one can tap into. The fact that the primordial dragonshave been so feared is thought to be the doing of “life-denyingreligions” focused on an afterlife in another world, as well as of thesheer power and potential attributed to the draconian force.The term dark magic is not meant to convey any moraljudgment, as stated earlier. Magic in itself, it is said, can be used forboth good and evil ends, and the practitioner is almost certainlyunable to comprehend the full consequences of his/her actions. Forexample, a ritual meant to be beneficial can have disastrousconsequences in a distant, and why not near, future (see DragonRouge 1996/2: 2). My informants do not seem to be particularlyinterested in using their magic for effecting changes in the mundaneworld. Dark magic is seen as a path of progress, best utilized toevolve the initiate into higher states of being, for gaining knowledgein order to be able to do this, and for gaining magical andpsychological power to become capable of proceeding with theprocess. As stated in the first correspondence course in magic:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"128CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSNot seldom do people with a recent interest in magic want toobtain help with something trivial in everyday life, for examplea money-ritual, curses or – perhaps most often – a love spell. Itis certainly possible to realize all these wishes with the help ofrituals and magic. [...] If one seeks magic in order to escapeinto a false world of rituals and all sorts of hocus pocus becauseone is too weak to deal with the ordinary world, one shoulddefinitely avoid the worlds of magic. [...] If one does not havethe will necessary to contact the person one desires, one willnot be able to win the person with the help of magic, otherthan possibly for a very short period and very disharmoniously.(Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 233).This passage displays the Dragon Rouge attitude towards usingmagic in mundane settings. The attitude is that magic can be usedto obtain money, promotion at work or a relationship with the objectof one’s desires, but the more regular methods of attaining thesegoals are, if not easier, at least as easy as attaining them throughmagic. A common rhetoric utilized in the order is that magic ishighly demanding on the adept, displayed, for example, in thefollowing passage from the first correspondence course:The magnitude and gigantic potential of existence and theuniverse is demanding. It is exhausting to become aware.It takes power to gain power and to have power (likeregular [sports-] training sessions!). To Will is demandingand requires responsibility. (Dragon Rouge 1996/1:234).33 “Inte sällan vill nya magiintresserade få hjälp med något trivialt ivardagen, t.ex. en penningritual, förbannelser eller – kanske oftast – enkärleksbesvärjelse. Visst går det att förverkliga alla dessa önskemål med hjälpav ritualer och magi. [...] Söker man magi för att fly in i en skenvärld av ritualeroch allehanda hokus pokus för att man är för svag att ta itu med den vanligavärlden, bör man definitivt undvika magins världar. [...] Har man inte denvilja som krävs för att ta kontakt med den man åtrår kommer man ej hellerkunna vinna denna med magins hjälp, annat än möjligtvis högst kortvarigt ochdisharmoniskt”.34 “Tillvarons och universums storhet och gigantiska potential är krävande.Det är ansträngande att bli medveten. Det tar kraft att få kraft och att ha kraft(likt vanliga träningspass!). Att vilja är krävande och kräver ansvar.”."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"129CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSThis view of magic as a demanding endeavour is combined withthe view of dark magic as something possibly dangerous if the adeptdoes not approach his or her practice with the insight and patiencerequired (see Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 1). With this attitude towardsmagic practice, it would be quite peculiar to use magic in order toattain mundane benefits, benefits possible to attain with moreworldly methods which do not place such stringent demands onthe practitioner, and which above all are not as dangerous as magicpractice.The view in Dragon Rouge is that the mgaician, by gainingmore and more knowledge about the universe the magician existsin, as well as about the various astral planes and qliphotic levels,and about the hidden parts of him-/herself, his/her shadow, evolvesuntil he/she finally becomes a god.When using the term Draconian Magic the focus is on theutilization of the draconian force. The Draconian force is seen astwofold, consisting of the “inner dragon and the “outer dragon”.The Inner Dragon is identified as the innate life-force in man, theKundalini, to borrow the terminology of Hindu Tantrism – as isfrequently done in Dragon Rouge. The Outer Dragon is the overalluniversal life-force or energy immanent in every aspect of nature,linking everything together. An alternative term to outer dragonemployed in Dragon Rouge is Vril, a term used by occultists suchas H. P. Blavatsky and Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Blavatsky 1895:651; Bulwer-Lytton 1886). The inner and outer dragons are linked,so that each is an aspect of the other, neither of them existing inisolation from the other. As noted earlier, the term Draconian magicis more frequently used when the focus is placed on the utilizationof this Draconian force. If dark magic is used in the exploration ofthe unknown, Draconian magic is used in raising energy for thistask. This is, however, an oversimplification, and the terms are notalways used clearly in the contexts presented here. The termsbasically represent the same magic-system and ideas, whilehighlighting somewhat different aspects.Magicians, especially those dealing with darker forms of magicand with individual goals, are often accused of promoting an elitistagenda. When one reads Dragon Rouge material selectively, thisjudgment indeed lies near at hand. To give a few examples: “Most"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"130CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSpeople sleep. They live their lives in a lethargy and lack any coherentwill” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 235), “Magic is for the strong, or forthose who sincerely aim at becoming strong” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 336), “To take the step and join an occult organization is a uniquechoice. It is made by avant-garde people who have understood thatthe world is run by mechanisms and forces which can not be seenor explained by the great masses, but nevertheless affect your life”(Dragon Rouge 2000d37).Occult organizations are generally elitist, as are religiousgroups, teachings and traditions on a grand scale. For example,salvation-offering religions tend to rhetorically represent thebelievers as ‘the chosen people’, having earned a place in an afterlife-paradise, while non-believers are called heretics and will suffer inan afterlife-inferno. The word elitism does, however, ring with apejorative tone. The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary givesdefinitions of elite as “the socially superior part of society”, “a groupof persons who by virtue of position or education exercise muchpower or influence” and “the best of class”, and elitism as“leadership or rule by an elite”, “the selectivity of the elite; especially:SNOBBERY” and “a consciousness of being or belonging to an elite”.Occultist movements are more often than traditionally religious onesregarded with a certain suspicion, linking the elitism of the formerto socially questionable agendas. This is particularly apparent inregard to movements and groups termed as ‘Satanist’ by outsiders(see Nylund 1998: 239-242; SVT 1 1996; Göteborgsposten 1997;Nilsson 1995a; 1995b for sentiments of this kind concerning DragonRouge, and Granholm 2001b concerning the issue).To refer back to the above quotations, it is not the individualmagician per se who is regarded as better than other people; it is thechoice of entering an esoteric order which is regarded as an elitechoice. Likewise, the practice of magic is not something which in35 “De flesta människor sover. De lever sina liv i en dvala och saknar någonenhetlig vilja”.36 “Magin är för de starka, eller de som uppriktigt eftersträvar att bli starka”.37 “Att ta steget och gå med i en ockult organization är ett unikt val. Detgörs av avant-garde människor som förstått att världen styrs av mekanismeroch krafter som inte kan ses eller förklaras av den stora massan, men som likvälpåverkar ditt liv”."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"131CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSitself deems persons to be superior; it is the choice to practice it whichis viewed as noble. One of my informants approached the issue inan interesting way. He likened the art of magic to playing the piano,concluded that both are something that everyone can practice butat the same time something that not all become good at. He askedme the rhetoric question “is that elitism?” (IF mgt 2001/47-48).Perhaps the term elitism would best be supplemented withanother, more neutral term. I suggest the term ‘Uniqueism’, from‘unique’ – signifying something unusual. Uniqueism does not containthe implicit assumption that ‘the unique’ are in an essential waybetter than others, but does include the key assumptions relevantfor the matter. This allows for a more fruitful approach to thephenomenon.Aware of the pejorative character of elitism, as well as thesocially sinister schemes often attributed to occult movements,Dragon Rouge strives to downplay elitist statements:This should not be understood in some collective politicalmeaning or in connection with thoughts about the right of thestrong, which is often advanced in some occult circles in avulgar-elitist way. Magic power is the power of one’s ownspirit, the power over one self. (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 338).Thomas Karlsson and others are also very keen to point out thatmagic power has nothing whatsoever to do with having power in acollective, societal way (IF mgt 2001/50; 47). It could also be pointedout that Dragon Rouge does not, like fundamentalist salvation-basedreligions, entertain a decisive distinction between believer and non-believer.A further distinct theme in Dragon Rouge, which I discuss inmore detail in chapter 7, is the rhetoric of magic as an empiricalscience. The view is that the magician is not involved in a blindfaith-based endeavour in which his/her rational agency is left aside,but instead he/she actively seeks to verify his/her findings andexperiences through empirical means. As one member says:38 “Detta bör inte förstås i någon kollektiv politisk mening eller kring tankarom den starkes rätt, vilket ofta förs fram i vissa ockulta kretsar på ettvulgärelitistiskt sätt. Den magiska styrkan är den egna andens kraft, maktenöver sig själv”."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"132CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSFor my part magic is about understanding what we don’t oftensee or think about in everyday life. No human being canunderstand or grasp the real world, what we experience asthe real world is a ’model’. ... At the ‘periphery’ of the modelwe meet things that we don’t know and do not think exist,sometimes they can even manifest themselves in our model as‘unexplained occurrences ’. By studying these ‘peripheralphenomena’, the concealed, the occult, we broaden our model,we see how the occult affects the mundane, we can develop inthe direction we want and acquire greater knowledge. ... Thecharacteristic of good knowledge is knowledge which can beverified in practice. ... When an occultist uses practical magiche verifies (by analogy with scientific experiments) that hismodel is of use and that he has learnt something of value. (IF2001/1:639).That is to say: the magician is not involved in a blind pursuit ofrewards, clinging onto the words and reassurances of others. Inthis view, the magician actively seeks out the truths of existence,and is not content with relying on somebody else to provide answersfor him/her. Another member expresses this in a technologicalanalogy: “[Magic is] the technique of changing the world inaccordance with my will, by non-worldly means.” (IF 2001/1:740).A member with a natural science oriented education expresses theview that there is no real conflict between the worldviews of naturalscience and magic, although many scientists experience a conflict.It is simply about two sides of reality. (IF 2001/1:7). A long-timemember connects knowledge attained through magic with a specific39 “Magi för min del handlar om att förstå det vi i vardagen inte ofta sereller tänker på. Ingen människa kan förstå eller greppa den verkliga världen,det vi upplever som verklighet är en ’modell’. ...

Det som kännetecknar god kunskap är kunskapsom praktiskt kan verifieras. ... När en ockultist använder praktisk magiverifierar han (i analogi med vetenskapliga experiment) att hans modell äranvändbar och att han har lärt sig något av värde.”40 “[Magi är] Tekniken att förändra verkligheten i enlighet med min vilja,med icke-världsliga medel.”"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"133CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETShuman intention, arguing for a meaning of life. This meaning is,according to him, possible to discern through magic.If we live solely for breeding, why would there be any pointin us having intellect and a capacity for abstract thought? [...]There has to be a point to our being distinct from the rest ofnature (even if some apes have been shown to have the capacityfor certain forms of abstract thought) and questionssurrounding this have plagued many thinkers through manymillennia. ... Magic is a science around this, which, indistinction to religions (which mainly build on theoreticalphilosophies and a few prophets’ practical experiences/revelations), builds on empirical experiences both from a largenumber of predecessors and contemporary colleagues as onone’s own. (IF 2001/1:841).I refer here to what I wrote earlier: the magician is active in seekingout his/her answers for him/herself. The same member goes on toexplain how a magician operating with many different forms ofmagic can cope with the often very different answers the varioussystems provide. “Since magic is a sort of science one does not viewthese [answers] as static or as dogmas, but simply as explanatorymodels which describe the same phenomenon” (IF 2001/1:842).The analogies between the Dragon Rouge strategy and scienceare not only used in interviews, they also appear frequently on theofficial Dragon Rouge homepage. In describing various courses andseminars offered, the words investigate, examine and study arecommonly used (see Dragon Rouge 2004a). Words such as conceptsand theories also appear. In the presentation of the order, themembers of Dragon Rouge are said to “study magic and occultism41 “Om vi lever bara för att föröka oss, så varför skulle det finnas meningmed att vi har intelligens och förmågan till abstrakt tänkande? [...] Det måstefinnas en mening med att vi skiljer oss från övriga naturen (även om vissa aporockså bevisats äga förmågan till vissa former av abstrakt tänkande) ochfrågetecken kring detta har plågat många tänkare genom flera årtusenden. ...Magin är en vetenskap kring detta som till skillnad från religioner (som främstbygger på teoretiska filosofier och ett fåtal profeters praktiska upplevelser/uppenbarelser) bygger på empiriska erfarenheter både från ett stort antalföregångare och samtida kollegor som ens egna.”42 “Eftersom magin är en sorts vetenskap så ser man inte dessa som statiskaeller dogmer, utan helt enkelt olika förklaringsmodeller som beskriver sammafenomen”."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"134CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSin both theory and practice” and to be involved in “exploring thenightside tradition” (Dragon Rouge 2004b; see also Karlsson 2001:ix).The presentation further sets the aim of the order as being the“education and development of the occult” and a “meeting pointfor knowledge and experiences”. The focus is on “empiricaloccultism and a knowledge of the unknown based on experience”.Words such as faith or conviction are conspicuous by their absence.According to Olav Hammer, the language of science, along withdis- and reembedded terms, theories and concepts, are oftenemployed in esoteric spiritualities (Hammer 2001: 203-205).Hammer sees this as a form of scientism, which he defines as follows:“the active positioning of one’s own claims in relation to themanifestations of any academic scientific discipline...” (Hammer2001: 206). In my view, this description does not express what isactually going on when members of Dragon Rouge formulate andinterpret experiences. As the example with the member trained inthe natural sciences shows, the view is that natural sciences andmagic do not rule each other out. However, they both use their ownlanguage, and do not strive towards the same goals, and thereforethey do not reach the same conclusion either.The first steps in magic progress are taken with a firstcorrespondence course in magic, and here the individual adept’scontact person is not identified as a guru, master or mage, but ratheras his/her tutor. At least on a structural level this rhetoric establishesDragon Rouge as a research-based order, in contrast to a faith-basedmovement. Among the members of the order there are said to bemany academics. These are grouped together with musicians,painters and writers, who more commonly become linked withmagic. In tracing the origin of the word ‘magic’, links to the Greekword ‘megas’, meaning great, are sought. This is further defined tomean the ‘great science’. Again, magic is defined as “the art andscience of working with the transcendental”. (Dragon Rouge 2004b)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"135CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETS3.1.1 The Principles of Dark MagicDraconian magic has three basic principles (Dragon Rouge 2004c;Eriksson 2001: 141-144). These are vision, power and action, and theycan be placed in a continuum of events. First comes vision, themagician obtains insight by seeing the “other side” – the chaosoutside our manifest universe. According to Dragon Rouge this“other side” is the whole of existence, whereas the existence weexperience and perceive as everything is in fact only a very smallpart, a part whose image is distorted by our three main categoriesused to make the world comprehensible: time, space and causality.The view is that our culturally determined knowledge makes usblind to existence outside our limited world. The first principle canalso be understood as visualization, meaning that the magicianfocuses his/her mind and will on something to achieve. (DragonRouge 2004c).The second principle, power, builds on the first principle. Theprosepct is that the magician gains knowledge of the world, realknowledge of the whole of existence while ‘wearing a pair of non-distorting spectacles’. As stated in Tommie Eriksson’s book,“knowledge is power” (Eriksson 2001: 142). The magician isconsidered to gain power by attaining this knowledge. DragonRouge states that our human and bound existence can be seen as asmall part of the world enclosed in a glass cover. In Dragon Rougewords: We cannot see the outside world because our breath mistsover the glass. The magician must, however, use a part of his/herown power or energy in order to gain access to the unlimited energyoutside the glass cover, and the unlimited energy and power insidehimself as well. He uses his power and the limited power/energyin the glass cover in order to see the “other side”. By seeing this“other side”, the magician is thought to gain access to the energyoutside, and can use this energy to gain better and deeper insight,as well as more power to do so. (Dragon Rouge 2004c).The third principle, action, is the finalizing aspect of the threeprinciples. The magician has a vision, insight into how he or shewants something to be, as well as insight into the true state of reality.Through knowledge of the real the magician has gained power and"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"136CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETShas further multiplied this power in accessing the world outsideour limited perception. The final stage of magic is to act out thechanges one wishes to occur. The magician canalizes the powergained and focuses it on the vision. As one can read on the DragonRouge homepage: “Action is the expression of magic. Through theforce of actions the magician can make his visions real” (DragonRouge 2004c).The three principles of Draconian magic are deeply interwoven.With one or more of the principles missing magic is not really magicat all. Without the principle of vision the magician has no insightinto the state of existence, and thus cannot effect any real changesin world. Without the knowledge gained from the insight, from themagician’s vision, he/she has no real magical power to effect anychanges. The principles of vision and action lack potency withoutthe principle of power. Without power the magician lacks thecapacity to exercise change in accordance to his/her vision. Thepremise of the vision-principle also implies that if the magician lackspower, then his organ of vision is faulty as well. The magician shouldgain power in and through his/her vision. In some way the power-principle is always inherent in magical activity, considering thatthe magician gains power through his vision. The presentation ofthe three principles on the Dragon Rouge homepage states that themagician who does not canalize his magical power in concrete action“will become burned out” (Dragon Rouge 2004c). As stated earlier,the principle of action is also the “expression of magic”.3.1.2 Feminine Symbolism in the Left Hand Path andDragon RougeFeminine symbolism is fundamental in all forms of spiritualitydefined as Left Hand Path. The Vama Marga, the ‘perverse path’ or‘unfriendly way’ (Gupta 1981: 195), school of Tantrism is in somelegends said to have been instigated by a low-caste woman,something quite unusual in the Indian male-dominated spiritualmilieu. Whether or not this in fact is true is of lesser importancethan the fact that this statement is noted in important founding"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"137CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSlegends. The idea of Vama Marga, or Vama Cara, Tantrism havingbeen founded by a low caste woman is an important factor indicatinghow important feminine symbolism is for the Left Hand Path.In order to understand the importance of feminine symbolismfor LHP it is necessary to understand the importance ofantinomianism to the same. Antinomian is defined as “one whorejects a socially established morality” in the Merrian-Websteronline Dictionary (Merriam-Webster 2004a). The antinomian stancein LHP is about embracing the acts and things thought of as impurein traditional spirituality43. In Tantrism this is about trulyunderstanding the unity of everything. Even the things consideredimpure are as much part of the divine as those things consideredpure. To cite Georg Feuerstein’s Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy: “TheTantric masters even sanctioned practices that are considered sinfulfrom within a conventional moral and spiritual framework. Thisfeature of Tantra has been termed antinomianism...” (Feuerstein1998: 9). In accordance to this, Tantra includes the Pañca Tattva ritual,sometimes called the ‘five-M’ ritual due to the five elements of theritual starting with the letter ‘M’. In the ritual the participants eatmeat (mãmsa) and fish (matsya), drink alcohol (madya or madirã),take aphrodisiacs (mudrã) and have sex (maithunã), preferably withsomeone other than one’s wife – a woman of low caste is consideredextra beneficial.The extent to which the ritual is realized varies among differentTantric traditions. The more right-hand oriented traditions tend torealize the ritual on a more allegorical and symbolic plane, whereasthose more on the left tend to realize the ritual in a more concreteway. (Feuerstein 1998: 134, 239-241; see Woodroffe 1956: 112-122).One should note that the above examples come from anextremely male-dominated culture, and that they thereforeconstitute a strictly male perspective. The woman is seen more as atool than a living subject. Still the appraisal of the positive use ofthe ‘woman-tool’, instead of the traditional dismissal of everythingfeminine, is an interesting, and possibly empowering factor. In43 A particular Left Hand Path stands in relation to a particular Right HandPath.

Det handlarom att bryta psykologiska tabun för att frigöra psykisk energi”.47 “Om man ska bryta traditioner och lagar krävs att man upprätthåller enmycket hög personlig moral och disciplin”.Dragon Rouge such a strictly male perspective is not taken. Seesection 7.1.6 for more on the discourse of Women’s Rights, whichconnects closely to the rhetoric of feminine symbolism.Dragon Rouge defines magical antinomianism as a “violationof the laws of cultural and religious tradition”44, which gives themagician” a freedom to create his/her own traditions, conventionsand rules that correspond with the magical development”45 (DragonRouge 2001j/1: 4). In this way psychic energy is considered to befreed; energy that the magician can use in his magic. It is furthersaid that the “antinomianism normally takes place on a mentalplane. It is about breaking psychological taboos in order to freepsychic energy.”46, and it is also stated that “if one is to breaktraditions and laws it is required that one maintains a very highpersonal moral and discipline”47 (Dragon Rouge 2001j/1: 4).The feminine and women have traditionally been consideredimpure, worldly, and thus separated from the divine, and even evilin both Western and Eastern spiritual culture. Seen from theperspective of dichotomies, she has often been looked upon as closerto nature – thus more material, whereas man has been seen as closerto culture and the spiritual plane (see Greenwood 2000: 138).In Jewish mysticism the character of Lilith is identified as thefirst woman – the ‘first Eve’, created equal with Adam, the firstman (Patai 1967: 218; Giller 2001: 65; see Jansson 1992: 36; Dan 1995:156). Lilith was not willing to submit to the will of Adam, and wastherefore cast out of, or fled from, the Garden of Eden (Ginzberg1909: 65-66; 1925: 87-88; Patai 1967: 210; Dan 1995: 157). She thencopulated with Satan/Samael and bore him a mass of differentdemonic children (see Jansson 1992: 30). Lilith has also beenidentified as a Succubus who seduced Adam and bore a number ofdemonic offspring to him (Ginzberg 1909: 118; Patai 1967: 220-221;Jansson 1992: 30). Liliths in the plural, and other female demons"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"139CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSsuch as Naamah, are said to seduce men at night time (Ginzberg1925: 143, 147-148; see Ginzberg 1928: 284; Patai 1967: 220-224, 230).In other accounts Lilith is said to be the wife of Samael/Satan,the in same way that Eve is the wife of Adam (Scholem 1987: 296;Dan 1995: 155), and furthermore that there is an older and a youngerLilith (Scholem 1987: 295; Dan 1995: 159) who wage war on eachother (Patai 1967: 233-239). Sometimes Lilith and Samael are saidto have been born in the same hour intertwined in each other (Dan1995: 159). The younger Lilith, consort of the demon Asmodeus, issaid to evoke jealousy in Samael, the mate of the old Lilith, andthus instigates war in the demonic regions (Dan 1995: 170).Qabalah describes the Shekhinah, the feminine force of theGodhead, variously as an active or a passive force. At times, theShekhinah is said to be passively impregnated by the masculineforces, and at others to be a force of active stimulation of themasculine forces. Gershom Scholem points out, however, that “thedialectics of femininity is primarily concerned – and this is worthemphasizing – not with its activity within creation, but rather withinthe context of the divine life itself” (Scholem 1991: 188). The feminineforces are thus still not as important as the masculine. The Shekhinahis also linked to Sitra Ahra, the demonic, evil and destructive otherside – the qliphoth. Penetrated by the evil of the qliphoth, theShekhinah becomes a destructive force. (Scholem 1991: 187-190).In the west, woman has come to symbolize lust, and as lust issin she has also come to represent sin – specifically in the meaningof enticing man to sin, and impurity. This is clearly noted in Mosaicviews on menstruation, as well as in the importance of maledominance over female sexuality, extending to the normative“missionary position” during sexual intercourse, in which thewoman is to surrender to the superior man (see Romney Wegner1999: 82-83; Klawans 2000: 29, 39-40, 104-108). Woman representingsexual lust, and the awakening of sexual lust in men and angels, isillustrated in the angels being “lured by the beauty of women”,and accordingly falling victims to them and having demonicoffspring by them (Ginzberg 1925: 154).In qabalistic symbolism ‘male’ usually represents the spiritualand pure, whereas ‘female’ represents the material and the demonic(Weissler 1995: 525-526). In Isaac Luria’s commentaries to the bible"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"140CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSthe male, the masculine forces, are identified with beauty, the dayand the impregnating force which seeds the feminine, dry land. Incosmic dichotomy, the feminine represents the dark, negative andpassive aspects of the universe while at the same time representingthe enticing and alluring aspects of the divine, in the form of theforces of chaos and evil actively leading mankind, as in mostlymales, to sin (Spring & Hoch-Smith 1978: 12; Radford Ruether 1983:76-79). The actual human woman is furthermore not as holy as man,as it is said that God has spoken directly to only one woman, Sarah(Ginzberg 1909: 78).In Indian religious tradition the feminine has not come torepresent quite so negative aspects as those suggested within theJewish tradition, but even here the female is considered spirituallyimpure, especially during menstruation. Margaret Stutley gives anaccount of how the male foetus was thought to reside in the rightside of the womb and the female foetus in the left side, the evil andunlucky side, in Indian, as well as Greek, Roman, Slavic, AncientGerman and Jewish, culture (Stutley 1980: 55). Penny van Esterikshows quite clearly how the traditional religious sphere of life ismore or less closed to the Theravada Buddhist woman (van Esterik1996). If she is to remain a functioning and accepted part of societya religious vocation is out of the question for her. Indian femaledeities include the frightening, violent and dangerous Kali, Durga,Tara, Chinnamasta and such. The divine female principle is Shakti,the active creating and destroying force, as well as Prakriti, the primemater and the material foundation of the world – the representativeof Maya, something which is viewed negatively in mainstreamHinduism (Hellman 1998: 54-56).In many ways the feminine in the Left Hand Path representsthe same as the feminine in many forms of traditional spirituality;the difference lies in how these aspects are valued. In Tantra, forexample, woman still stands for lust but as there is no such thing assin for the Tantric, she represents the worldly pleasures which canbe used for transcendent purposes. As nature and this-worldly thingsare viewed as part of the divine, the woman acquires a differentstatus. According to Benjamin Walker some sources of Tantrism statethat that which is natural cannot be wrong, and that the natural is"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"141CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSthus sacred (Walker 1982: 31). In extension, moral judgments of goodand bad cannot be applied to the natural, such as sex.The woman represents Shakti, the active power in existence,and is as such regarded as holy. Shakti can in fact be translated aspower (Online Sanskrit 2004). Shakti is the active principle whereasShiva, the male principle, is passive (Woodroffe 1957: 46-47; Evola1992: 5; Feuerstein 1998: 82; Gröndahl 2000: 5).Influenced in many aspects by LHP Tantra, Dragon Rouge hastaken the same approach. Lilith, a much invoked demoness, islikened to Shakti and is seen as both a creator and destroyer. She isalso, as the demon ruler of the qliphotic plane Gamaliel, seen as aseducer and as the feminine aspect of the divine driven into exile.(see Dragon Rouge 2001j/6: 2-4). Dragon Rouge also states that thefeminine has been restrained for far too long in our society andculture, and that we now need to focus on the feminine and bring itup to the front. In his book, Mörk Magi, Tommie Eriksson writesthat “the feminine primal force has been banished to darkness andthe dark goddess has become nothing more than a symbol of deathand decay” (Eriksson 2001: 648).Another important factor affecting the appraisal of femininityis the belief in a closer link between woman and nature (see above).Consequently, as woman is seen to be closer to nature, femininityis often valued high in contemporary Western nature religion (seeGreenwood 2000: 138). The same gender polarization, in which manand woman are essentially different – and in extension necessarilycomplementary, may however lead to restricting gender roles.Assigning essentialized qualities to man and woman, and ascribingto these ‘forces’ a mutual dependence, leads to an extremelyheteronormative imperative. As Susan Greenwood shows, this mayeven lead to homosexuals being discriminated against due to theirinability to fit into this heterosexist gender polarity requisite(Greenwood 2000: 147-148).The gender polarity issue exists in the Dragon Rouge contextas well, although the view is that the feminine and the masculineforces exist within each individual magician. When asking a member48 “Den kvinnliga urkraften har förpassats till mörkret och den mörkagudinnan har blivit endast en symbol för död och förfall”."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"142CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSif sexual orientation plays a role in thepractice of sex magic the answer wasstraightforward. Sexual orientation is notimportant. The dark magician focusesmore on autosexuality – meaning that he/she focuses on what happens within him-/herself (IF mgt 2001/11). Thus, thepractice of sex magic can be performedalone, with a same-sex partner, with adifferent-sex partner, as abstinence fromsex, and perhaps a limitless number ofother alternatives. It is further pointed outthat sexuality as a force is principally thesame as the life-force, or the Libido inFreudian terms, and thus it can be focusedin very many different ways. For exampleKundalini-meditation is a way of focusingthese forces. (IF mgt 2001/11).The symbolic language of DragonRouge has much feminine reference. Forexample, the road into the qliphoth goesthrough the qlipha of Lilith. The magicianis to symbolically step into Lilith’s womb(see Dragon Rouge 2001j/6: 2-3). Themagician’s development reaches a climaxin the qlipha of Thaumiel, in which thewomb is represented as the staring eye ofchaos (Eriksson 2001: 12). In steppingthrough Lilith’s cave, the womb of Lilith,the magician gives birth to himself. In thealchemical symbol of Dragon Rouge (seePicture 3), Lilith’s womb (see Picture 4 forthe Lilith symbol) plays an importantPicture 3. The alchemi-cal symbol of DragonRouge (from Eriksson2001: 18).

The key element of the symbolis the second portrayal of the womb ofLilith, this time with horns on it. Inside"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"143CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSthis symbol is the Eye of Lucifer, whichis in fact a stylized representation of theTantric Shiva-Linga symbol: Shiva in theform of an erect penis standing insidethe vulva of Shakti.Tommie Eriksson writes that thelight side of existence, the sephiroth, isdominated by male principles whereasfemale principles can be found on thedark side, the qliphoth (Eriksson 2001:11). The second corres-pondence coursein magic, dealing for the most part withwitchcraft, also maintains that the darkeraspects of spirituality are feminine:49 “Hon representerar porten till magins dimensioner. Hon är Moder Jordoch genom hennes sköte föds och dör livet. Hon är underjordens port ochgudinna som häxan och trollkarlen stiger ned i för att invigas. Hon är dödsriketoch modern till allt liv.”Picture 4. The Lilith sym-bol of Dragon Rouge(from Eriksson 2001: 104).By T. Ketola.She represents the gate to thedimensions of magic. She isMother Earth and throughher womb life is born anddies. She is the gate to theunderworld and the goddessthat the witch and thewarlock step down into inorder to be initiated. She is therealm of death and themother to all life. (DragonRouge 2001j/3: 349).The female aspects of the divine are as important as they are tomost of the LHP partly because this female part of spirituality isleft out by the dominant religions in both the Western and the Indiancultural spheres, Christianity and Hinduism. In a way the inclusionof the feminine divine, and alternative spirituality in general, couldbe seen as a rebellion against dominant religious traditions. In somesense this is true. Alternative spiritualities are born from the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"144CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSobservation that the majority religion does not provide all that theseeker wishes to have. When a group of people with similar spiritualideas meet, an alternative form of spirituality, providing that whichwas seen as missing in the existing alternatives, can be crafted. Beingborn out of dissatisfaction with the majority religion does not meanthat rebellion is the only thing of importance on the agenda of thealternative. There might be, and surely most often are, motivatingforces and far-reaching needs to find meaningful answers andcreative ways of looking at life.3.2 PhilosophyThe declared philosophical core of Dragon Rouge is constituted bythe goal of the evolution of the individual magician into a god, togo from being a creation to being a creator (see Dragon Rouge 1996;2004b; 2004c; Eriksson 2001:130). As written in the firstcorrespondence course in magic: “Ordinary human existence is onlythe surface of an enormous sea of powers. Most people float aroundin the ocean of existence without knowing why, or what they aredoing and what affects them.” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1:150). In thismetaphor, the magician dives into the ocean, learning more aboutthe totality of existence and forging him-/herself a meaning with itall. The magician learns how to control his/her destiny and gainspower through this.Control is an important theme in Dragon Rouge. The magicianshould be aware of what affects him/her and be in total control ofhis life and existence. This is one of the key requirements, and indeedpart of the definition of dark magic. Part of the discourse is statingthat the process of gaining control through magic is a difficult,demanding and often dangerous enterprise (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 1). Consequently, the individual who chooses to partake in thiseffort is viewed as a courageous and unique person. As one canread in the course: “To will is demanding and requires50 “Den vanliga mänskliga tillvaron är bara ytan på ett enormt hav avkrafter. De flesta människor flyter omkring i tillvarons ocean utan att veta varför,eller vad de gör och vad som påverkar dem”."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"145CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSresponsibility. Everyone can become a magician, but few canmanage becoming one” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 251).Another key theme in Dragon Rouge is the concept of a livingnature. According to the order, the ideological structures ofmonotheism, materialism and modernism have killed nature andtaken away its soul. Nature has been removed from the divinesphere and made into something inanimate. The magicianreanimates nature and sees the interconnections between all things.The city, civilization, stands for the static and the restrictingstructures, whereas nature stands for the active and dynamic partsof existence, chaos. (Dragon Rouge 2004c).Key discursive themes are discussed in length in chapter 7.3.2.1 The Dragon as SymbolThe Dragon is, as the name of the order implies, the single mostimportant symbol for Dragon Rouge. In the words of theorganization, the dragon represents an “original and limitless force”(Dragon Rouge 1996/1:2. A latent inner force according to theofficial Dragon Rouge website, see Dragon Rouge 2004b). Accordingto Dragon Rouge, the dragon is “both the inner and the outer powerpersonified” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1:3), meaning that the dragonforce is the prime foundation of everything (see also the ‘FiveElementary Draconian Principles’, Dragon Rouge 2004c).The ‘Draconian Aphorisms’ on the Dragon Rouge homepageshed some light on the symbol of the Dragon.The Dragon is the winged serpent. The Dragon unitesthe serpent with the eagle, what is below with what is above.The Dragon is the four elements. The wings are Air. Thereptile body is Earth. The scales is [sic!] Water and the burningbreath is Fire. Thus the Dragon is the fifth element – Spirit.The Dragon is, in the form of Ouroboros, the serpentthat bites its own tail. The dragon is the beginning of the endand the end of the beginning.51 “Att vilja är krävande och kräver ansvar. Alla kan bli magiker, men fåkan klara av att bli det”."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"146CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSThe Dragon is beyond good and evil, night and day,female and male, plus and minus. The Dragon arises throughthe meeting of opposites. The Dragon is the polarity betweenplus and minus.The Dragon is the symbol of Tao – the Journey – and theJourney is the goal. The Dragon is dynamic eternity. (DragonRouge 2004c).In short, the dragon is everything, and at the same time beyondeverything. The dragon symbolizes the all-encompassing energyof existence and beyond existence. By connecting with this force,the magician awakens power and energy latent in him-/herself, aswell as gains access to the power and energy existent in the potentialof chaos.The Dragon is also rhetorically identified as the serpent whogave the fruit of knowledge to Eve in the Garden of Eden, and theserpent in turn as Satan (see Ginzberg 1925: 121). It is the Dragonwho sets the magician out on his path to self-deification (see DragonRouge 2004b). The Dragon, Satan and the Serpent all represent theKundalini-force, ‘the inner dragon’, and its role in the magical process.The Dragon also represents ‘the outer dragon’, the primordial chaosfrom which everything was created, in the form of the likes ofLeviathan and Tiamat (compared in Ginzberg 1925: 41), who aresubdued, and out of whom the cosmos is created, by the forces ofstructure and order, represented by God, Marduk etc. (see Ginzberg1925: 3, 16, 42). The ‘outer dragon’ is thus the potential resident inchaos, the potential of the dark magician to create on his-/her own(see Dragon Rouge 2004b). The combination of the outer and innerdragons, which are really one and the same, points to the ultimateunion of all and everything."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"147CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSPicture 5.

He regards them as “all too often the celebration of the‘demise of the ethical’, of the substitution of aesthetics for ethics,and of the ‘ultimate emancipation’ that follows” (Bauman 1994: 2).He sees the postmodern approach to ethics not as abandoning moralquestions altogether, but rather as approaching them in a new anddifferent fashion. Postmodern approaches to ethics basically dealwith the same questions as modern approaches, but have abandonedthe modern way of treating them, trying to regulate moral questionsin law-like ethical codes (Bauman 1994: 3-4; see also Bauman 1997a:9-18).Bauman proposes the following characteristics as distinctiveof postmodern approaches to morality and moral questions.1.Humans are morally ambivalent, and therefore no logicallycoherent ethical codes can be imposed on morality. Theambivalence of moral concerns requires solutions based oneach specific situation.2.Morality is non-rational and thus not possible to regulatein rigid rule-based ethical codes.3.The ambivalence of moral concerns is further displayed inthe fact that few, if any, choices are plainly and simply goodin a clear-cut way. Most moral choices have at least somenegative consequences in the long run. An example couldbe the ethical choice not to eat meat, ultimately leading to adecreased demand for meat-products making meat-producers lose income.4.It is not possible to universalise morality. By this, it is notmeant that all morality is relative, but that morality is notto be regulated in a system with clear rules about moralconduct without taking each individual situation intoconsideration.5. From the regulative and administrative perspectivemorality is irrational, and thus requires administrativeforces to constantly “trim” moral rules in order to “keepthem in desired shape” (Bauman 1994: 13). This means,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"149CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSsimply put, that governmental administration, based onrational thinking, needs to regulate and constantly controlthe morality of its subjects, in order to transform irrational,and uncontrollable, morality into rational, and more easilycontrollable, ethical rules of conduct.6.Moral responsibility is something existing prior to society,and is in fact the prerequisite for the existence of society. Ina modern view society is prior to morality and it is societythat gave birth to morality. Bauman states as follows: “...moral responsibility – being for the Other before one can bewith the Other – is the first reality of the self, a starting pointrather than a product of society” (Bauman 1994: 13. See alsoBauman 1994: 32).7.Ethical codes are relative, not morality in it self. This refersback to point 4, stating that a universal morality may infact be possible, or exist as a common factor in all humanity.Ethical rules, almost always enforced by actors in possessionof more power than their subjects, are not universal as theyare always an attempt to rationalize ultimately non-rationalizable issues. (Bauman 1994:10-15).Bauman recognizes the fact that postmodern approaches to moralitydo not in any way make moral life any easier, and that the freedomof choice inherent in the postmodern condition in fact introduces astrong feeling of insecurity (Bauman 1994: 15, 20-21). He does,however, think that the abandoning of clear-cut ethical codes maymake moral life more moral. The postmodern approach to moralityis basically a re-personalization of morality, and is in Bauman’sview a “returning [of] moral responsibility ... to the starting pointof the ethical process” (Bauman 1994: 34).Characteristic number six in Bauman’s model seems to fit badlywith a social constructionist stance. If one takes a closer look atwhat he claims, however, this does not necessarily have to be thecase. According to Bauman, we face a ‘situation of moral choice’from ‘day one’, before we have had the opportunity to learn andappropriate the socially constructed rules of ethical conduct.Morality, in a way, is deep down the way we relate to the Other. InBauman’s view, this is the prerequisite for human social life and"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"150CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSnot the outcome of it. Ethical codes and moral rules are the sociallyconstructed regulations born out of the necessity to find functionalways of relating to the other. (Bauman 1997a: 9-10). This definitionof morality does not contradict the socially constructed nature ofour views on right and wrong conduct. Whereas the base-moralityof Bauman’s concept is largely unreflected and of a highlyambivalent nature, reflected morality and ethical code systems arecreated in a social context. With Bauman’s concepts it is possible toilluminate the characteristic views on ethics and morality held inDragon Rouge.Despite its unwillingness to dictate moral rules, Dragon Rougeactually advocates a certain kind of ethics, namely individual,situation-based morality. Each member should acquire a deepknowledge of his or her preferences and values, including the onesrooted deeply in one’s subconscious, and make his or her own moraljudgements when the situation so demands. This strategy begs forthe abandoning of static, rule-like ethical codes found in for examplemany traditional forms of Christianity. Bauman identifies suchclosed formulations as the modern approach to morality (Bauman1994:3-4). In Dragon Rouge a strong critique of the ethics ofChristianity, in a Dragon Rouge interpretation, is combined withthe following argumentation included in the first correspondencecourse in magic:It is not possible to generalize every act as either good or evil.How is, for example, a so-called evil act to be viewed if theresults are good? [...] For a black magician there exists only asubjective moral code. (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 1052).The exposition is followed by argumentation for a subjectivemorality, pointing at the downsides of rigid moral-laws.The Christians thought that they would be able to force manto love by morality. A forced love is unnatural and withoutvalue. [...] A black magician has rooted out all the ’Thou shalt!’52 “Det är inte möjligt att generalisera alla handlingar som antingen godaeller onda. Hur skall t.ex. en s.k. ond handling betraktas om resultatet blir gott?[...] För en svart magiker finns bara en subjektiv morallära”."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"151CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSand released ‘I want to!’. If man is successful in breaking freeof imposed morality he can start loving honestly – a love forthe living and not for the meek and dying. (Dragon Rouge1996/1: 1053).The Dragon Rouge view is, much in concordance with Bauman’soutline of the postmodern approach to ethics, that a moralityregulated by a rigid ethical code is fundamentally false, and as such,basically destructive to humanity. The above quotation states thata rule-governed approach to what one should do is in conflict withthe innate nature of human beings and their morality, and is thusdishonest, leading to destructive tendencies in the long run (asargued in the quotations above).The assertion “I want to!” as preferable to “Thou shalt!” is easilyinterpreted as complete indulgence in total freedom and lack ofresponsibility on the part of the individual. This concern is voicedin an interview made by Swedish television with Thomas Karlsson.The interviewer asked Karlsson what rules the magician, in thiscontext said to be his or her own god, lives by. Karlsson answeredthat there are no objective rules, only individual rules which onefinds for oneself (SVT 1 1996).The magician in the instance of Dragon Rouge is indeed guidedby morality, but this does not conform to the view on morality andethics of all outside observers. Dragon Rouge is also careful to pointout that the individual and situation-based morality is not aboutindulgence in all that one for the moment wishes to indulge in. Theview is that the practice of magic, and the possession of magicpower, demands great responsibility of the magician, as the firstcorrespondence course in magic states (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 1-2).Thomas Karlsson sums up the moral development of the darkmagician as a process where “Collective and unconscious moralityis substituted by an individual and conscious [morality]” (Karlsson53 “De kristna trodde att de skulle kunna tvinga människan till kärlek genommoralen. En påtvingad kärlek är onaturlig och utan värde. [...] En svartmagikerhar rensat bort allt ’Du skall!’ och släppt fram ’Jag vill!’. Om människan lyckasbryta sig loss från den påtvingade moralen så kan hon börja älska ärligt – enkärlek till det levande och inte till det veka och döende”."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"152CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETS2001: xi54). It is apparent from Karlsson’s view of the dark magician’smorality that he sees it as the better alternative.The following quotation from the same source shows that theDragon Rouge approach to morality fits Bauman’s account (or myunderstanding of it) well: “The dark magician knows that there isnot anything true or false, right or wrong” (Karlsson 2001: xi55). Asthere does not exist anyhing true or false, right or wrong, themagician has to find his/her own rules of conduct and, as the rulesare made by him/her, he/she is free to change them if they do notfit the situation. The magician should be responsible in making his/her choices (Karlsson 2001: x) and his situation-based moralityshould be in alignment with his true, or higher, Will.Even with the lack of a common law-like ethical code, combinedwith anti-authoritarianism and the concept of each individualfinding his or her own morality, certain moral traits seem to becommon to most Dragon Rouge members. The strongest of theseethical standpoints seems to be the quest for ecology. When askedabout their views on certain topics such as politics, equality, ecologyand religion/spirituality, all of my informants have answered thatecology is very important. In the official material, nature andnaturalism play very important parts. Since one of the ‘FiveElementary Draconian Principles’, the five doctrinal key conceptsfor the organization, is “all is one”, meaning the total unity ofeverything, encompassing the total unity of man and nature as well,this is not that surprising (Dragon Rouge 2004c).In the mother-organization in Stockholm many members,especially the inner circle and other very active members, arevegetarians or vegans. This is variously motivated by concerns foranimal rights, by ecological reasons, by health reasons and bymagical reasons. In fact, the different motivates are somewhatdifficult to distinguish clearly from each other as they are allintertwined. The sentiment is that the choice of a vegetarian diet isgood ecologically (and for the animals) and thus good for magicpractice, and thus good for spiritual wellbeing. Furthermore, thechoice of a vegetarian diet is in itself good for the practice of magic(it is, for example, lighter than a meat-based diet). Thomas Karlsson54 “Kollektiv och omedveten moral ersätts med en individuell och medveten”.55 “Mörkmagikern vet att det inte finns något sant eller falskt, rätt eller fel”."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"153CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSidentifies the choice of vegetarian diet as one of the ethical choicessurfacing in Dragon Rouge as an organization (in a presentation ofDragon Rouge for docent Liselotte Frisk and her students). He pointsout, however, that the choice is not something dictated to anyoneon the behalf of Dragon Rouge, it has simply seemed to surface ascommon to many Stockholm-based members. Indeed vegetarianismdoes not seem to be as important to members outside the mother-organization in Stockholm.Ecological thinking and vegetarianism are recurrent themes incontemporary alternative spirituality, specifically in ‘New Age’spirituality and neopaganism. Both of these generally foster animmanent view of the divine. Neopaganism is very nature-oriented,often seeing Mother Nature as the most important deity of all (notcounting the divinity of individuals themselves). ‘New Age’spirituality has a similar approach, although often focusing moreopenly on the individual practitioner and less on nature as such(see for example Mikaelsson & Gilhus 1998: 161-166; Frisk 1998:172; Heelas 1996: 33, 89, 203).Equality, extending beyond the human race, and the freedomof the individual to have his own views on politics, sexuality, society,religion etc., without the organization or other members infringingon this basic right, is important in the organization. Thomas Karlssonwrites: “Everything is equal, all humans, all animals etc” (IF 2001/1:356), and other members agree with him: “Now I respect all kindsof religious people, but not necessarily the religions” (IF 2001/1:457).Concerning the magical activities of each individual member, he/she is free to experiment with what he/she wants and choose thosespecific methods that suit him/her best. As stated in the firstcorrespondence course in magic:One can furthermore have different aptitudes for magic anddifferent forms of magic. As a student of magic it is thereforegood to experiment. Therefore we have many different typesof magic in our magic course. It is then up to the individual tofind what works for him/her. (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 258).56 “Allt är jämlikt, alla människor, alla djur etc.”.57 “Respekterar nu alla slags religiösa människor, men nödvändigtvis intereligionerna”."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"154CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETS58 “Man kan dessutom ha olika fallenhet för magi och olika typer av magi.Som magistudent är det därför bra att testa sig fram. I vår magikurs har vidärför många typer av magi. Det är sedan upp till individen att hitta det somfungerar för denne”.59 “För en svartmagiker finns bara en subjektiv morallära”.Taking personal responsibility for one’s acts is important. Themagician gains total freedom through his/her magic and it istherefore of key importance to take equal responsibility for one’sacts, decisions and choices. Dragon Rouge does not advocate anobjective and once-and-for-all fixed moral or ethical code. “For theblack magician there exists only a subjective moral code” (DragonRouge 1996/1: 1059). This does not mean, however, that the magicianis free to do exactly as he/she wishes, to follow each spontaneouswhim. The magician should explore his True Will, his higher self,and, through the harmony born in the embracing of the True Will,the magician attains a true morality, free from artificial conventions.(Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 10-11). This is similar to Aleister Crowley’sview on abiding to the Will in the Book of the Law. In Crowley’sview The magician who follows his/her Will cannot do wrong tohis/her morals (see Crowley 1996: 41-46, verses 1: 40-44).Spirituality and the reanimation of nature are of greatimportance in the order. On the Dragon Rouge homepage, theideology of materialism is strongly criticized.The nature and the animals are made for man to use. Man cando what he likes with animals and nature. [...] Dark magic istheriocentric and views man as an animal and a part of nature.Man can become god by entering outside the human limitsand by recognizing the importance of the beast. This is not tobe interpreted as if one is giving in to all lower instincts. It israther a way to value nature and the animals. The draconianphilosophy is a pantheism where the divine is present innature. [...] Nature has become dead and man and the animalshave become soulless organisms being compared to cars orcomputers. This leads to people seeking fast satisfaction of thebasic instincts instead of striving to reach divinity. [...] Byinvoking the old spirits the world is re-enchanted and manand nature win back their soul. A fellowship in a magical ordershould mean that the individuals become more thanthemselves. (Dragon Rouge 2004c)."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"155CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSThe dark magician should feel a connection to, and respect for, allthings living, and act in a compassionate and responsible manner.As the magician is part of nature, injuring or harming nature in anyway would be harming oneself. In experiencing the totality ofexistence and the interconnections between oneself and other livingbeings, the magician is supposed to gain an empathic understandingof sentient beings as well as the living, non-sentient, parts ofexistence.During the time I have been researching Dragon Rouge, 2001-2004, the order has become more outspoken in some of its societalcritique. In 2001, the frequently asked questions section of the officialhomepage answered the question of the political alignment of theorder by simply stating that different members have differentpolitical views and that these have no bearing whatsoever on theorder or the practice of magic (Dragon Rouge 2001a). In 2004 it wasstill stated that Dragon Rouge is a non-political organization, butthe experienced one-sidedness of official political parties is criticizedand voting for some alternative political party is recommended(Dragon Rouge 2004b).This relates to morality is via the obvious societal interests ofthe leading core of the order. Although Dragon Rouge in no wayhas a political activist or socially revolutionary agenda, it still is aspiritual organization which is world-affirming and not world-rejecting as, for example, many millennial movements. Membersof Dragon Rouge regard themselves, and the order, as a part of thesociety they exist in – and are thus affected by what goes on in therest of society. As stated in the first correspondence course in magic,“The magician has to think of his social role in the community. Hehas to stand with both feet on the ground, and not float in the clouds.He has to keep up-to-date with what is happening around him”(Dragon Rouge 1996/2: 460).The issue of good and evil is often under some form ofdiscussion when LHP and dark, or black, magic is treated (see SVT1 1996). In the Dragon Rouge context, it is stressed that dark magic60 “Magikern måste tänka på sin sociala roll i samhället. Han måste ståmed båda fötterna på jorden, och inte sväva ut bland molnen. Han måste hållasig ajour med vad som händer omkring honom”."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"156CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSdoes not revolve around acts of evil, such as sacrificing children oranimals in a ritual setting, or in any form of socially sinister scheme(Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 10; Karlsson 2004: 17). In an article aboutthe ‘New Age’ answer to evil, Olav Hammer criticizes the movementfor its unsuccessful dealing with evil of, for example, naturalcatastrophes (Hammer 2000). Thomas Karlsson describes the evilof dark magic as a metaphysical evil, not the ‘grey evil’ of humanconduct. From a qabalistic starting point, Karlsson discussesmetaphysical evil as the evil of the dark forces, the forces of chaoswhich are an antithesis to the cosmic forces of God and creation. InKarlsson’s view, human evil is something completely distinct fromthis metaphysical evil. Human ‘grey evil’ is the result of humanscommitting atrocities on each other, and often stems from goodintentions or from arguably good goals and aims61. Metaphysicalevil in the dark magical context is evil as its aim is separation andliberation from God and his creation. (Karlsson 2004: 14-18). Human‘grey evil’ thus plays no real part in metaphysical evil.3.4 Dragon Rouge and ChristianityWe have also seen tendencies which show the struggle of the oldmonotheistic religions to hold people in their grip. [...] The keypreachings and sales-tricks of the monotheists, that is to say the Jews,the Muslims and the Christians, seem to be working through feelingsof guilt. (Dragon Rouge 2000a: 262)Where Christian authorities have traditionally taken a very negativeapproach to magic and magic orders, the attitude of theorganizations themselves towards Christianity as a whole, ortowards specific churches as representatives for mainstreamChristianity, has varied. Magicians and esotericists living in timesdominated by Christian religion often professed themselvesChristians. The question of whether the proclamation of Christianitywas a strategy for survival, as Christianity had such a strong andundisputed position in Western societies earlier, or whether the61 One example could be radical opponents of abortion, who in the nameof the greater good kill doctors who perform abortions."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"157CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSmagicians truly saw themselves as Christians, is very difficult toanswer, and falls beyond the scope of the present study.The overall attitude towards mainstream Christianity startedto change with the increasing secularization of the 19th and 20thcenturies. Organizations such as the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, with such prominent characters as Aleister Crowley, WilliamButler Yeats, Dione Fortune and Arthur Edward Waite as members,chose to adopt quite a positive approach to Christianity as a whole,even if some of the members of the order eventually adopted a muchmore negative approach to the Christian religion. Certain members,such as A.E. Waite, saw themselves as devoted Christians, in somecases even on a mission from God. Aleister Crowley adopted adifferent approach. He saw Christianity, in the words of FriedrichNietzsche, as a slave-religion (variously interpreted to mean either“the religion of the slaves”, that is to say, in elitist terms the religionfor the part of humanity viewed as less evolved or simply lessworthy, or as a religion fashioned to keep humanity enslaved) andoffered his Thelema as a more sane and active replacement. HelenaPetrovna Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society, although not a directlymagical organization still a part of the esoteric scene of the late 19thand early 20th century, had for the most part a negative approachtowards Christianity. While all religions where viewed as having acommon core of esoteric truth, Christianity was generally not verypopular amongst the theosophists (Ahlbäck 1995: 13).Contemporary neopaganism is another form of spirituality,with strong ties to a magical worldview as well as with similaritiesto the worldview and approach of Dragon Rouge, which stressesthe negative aspects of Christianity. In this form of spirituality it iscommon to see the dualism of monotheistic religions as the sourceof the Western negative attitude towards nature63, and, thus,62 “Vi har också kunnat se tendenser som visar de gamla monoteistiskareligionernas kamp att hålla kvar människan i sitt grepp. [...] Monoteisternas,d.v.s. judarnas, muslimernas och de kristnas främsta förkunnelse ochförsäljningsknep är att verka genom skuldkänslor”.63 This is also a common view amongst radical animal rights advocates, inthis context expressed mainly as the subjugation of animals (see for exampleEriksson 2003: 209)."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSChristianity as the source and motivation behind the “raping ofMother Earth”. (see Harvey 1997: 222-224; York 1995: 128-129).Religious traditions of the Left Hand Path have traditionallyadopted a highly negative stance towards mainstream Christianity.Christianity is seen as the very antithesis to what is worth strivingfor. The attitude towards Christianity found in Dragon Rouge issomewhat ambivalent. On the one hand, the order places strongemphasis on Dragon Rouge being open to people with all kinds ofreligious etc. worldviews in its official standing, Christianity beingno exception. On the other hand, there are seen to be certainfundamental differences between the dark magical worldview ofDragon Rouge and monotheistic religion in its traditional forms.When asked to name the most detestable form of religiosity knownto them, fundamentalist Christianity and Islam count high in mostmembers’ answers, due to the oppressive character of thesereligions, according to my informants. Thomas Karlsson himselfsays that:...most interpretations of the monotheistic religions go very badlytogether with our ideology [...] Submission, the need for salvation,the linear conception of time, the static understanding of paradise,the collectivism, objective morals and duty-ethics, the separation ofbody and spirit, the negative view of humans and the human bodyetc. fit badly with opinions in Dragon Rouge. (IF 2001/1:364).He goes on to point out that people with Christian, Jewish orMuslim worldviews are naturally very welcome to join the order:Dragon Rouge does not discriminate anybody on the basis of theirreligion. (IF 2001/1:3).The introductory quotation of the present section is part of anarticle in the members’ paper called “Tendencies 2000” (DragonRouge 2000a). The article appears to deal with world tendencies inthe year 2000 which in some way affect the dark magician, and is64 “... de flesta tolkningar av de monoteistiska religionerna passar extremtilla ihop med vår ideologi. [...] Underkastelsen, frälsningsbehovet, den linjäratidsuppfattningen, det statiska paradistillståndet, kollektivismen, objektivmoraluppfattning och pliktetik, separation mellan ande och materia, negativsyn på människan och hennes kropp etc rimmar illa med uppfattningar inomDragon Rouge”."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"159CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSquite explicitly a critique of Christianity and what is seen as seculartendencies highly influenced by Christianity. Monotheistic religionis criticized as being hypocritical – in the overt act of tearfullyapologizing for past atrocities whilst at the same time conductingnew acts of horror, for depriving man of his/her divinity and thusenslaving him/her to the ‘one god’. It is also rhetorically asked whythe Catholic Church has never felt the need to apologize for burningwitches in medieval times. Secular authorities today are shown tobe highly infused with these same tendencies.One member identifies himself as a “spiritual anarchist”, andfeels that it is very important to “listen to oneself”, that is to say, tobe one’s own authority (IF 2001/1:6). This same informant is one ofthe few members I have met who have not taken an overall negativeapproach to Christianity. He says:Many DR members seem to feel a deep hatred towards Christianity,but I do not think that is sound. If one lets oneself be inspired by otherreligions without following them literally one should not rejectChristianity either. It, too, has many interesting features. (IF 2001/1:665).There does indeed seem to be a deep dislike for at least certainaspects of monotheistic religion within the order, on both theindividual and the collective levels. This does not, however, entaila hatred of Christian, Muslim or Jewish people. I point to an earlierquotation: “Now I respect all kinds of religious people, but notnecessarily the religions” (IF 2001/1:466). Monotheistic ideology andits consequences are criticized. Monotheism is said to stand for thesubjugation of humans in general, and women and nature inparticular, including many acts of violence towards theaforementioned. Monotheism is seen as the original idea behindmaterialism and modernism, both imposing severe restrictions onthought, choices and an individual morality. Furthermore,monotheism, materialism and modernism are experienced as very65 “Många DR medlemmar verkar hysa ett djupt hat mot Kristendomen,men jag tror inte det är sunt. Om man låter sig inspireras av andra religionerutan att [följa] dem bokstavligen skall man inte förkasta kristendomen också.Den innehåller en hel del intressant den också.”.66 “Respekterar nu alla slags religiösa människor, men nödvändigtvis intereligionerna”."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160CHAPTER 3 - PHILOSOPHICAL TENETSmuch alive, even in a secular society like Sweden. (Dragon Rouge1996/1: 10; 2004c).A further reason for the difficulty of incorporating the magicof Dragon Rouge in a Christian worldview is the fact that DragonRouge “explores the forbidden parts of the creation of God” (DragonRouge 1996/1: 4). The Christian magic adept would therefore bebetter served by choosing a path which leads to becoming one withGod, instead of becoming like God – the goal of the Dragon Rougemagician."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"161CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATION4 Organization4.1 HistoryThe following account of the history of Dragon Rouge is based on,and compiled from, information provided to me by various DragonRouge members, as well as what can be read on the order’shomepage, URL http://www.dragonrouge.net. I am well aware of theproblems involved in having my recount based on the retellings ofDragon Rouge adherents ten years on, but as there are no othersources I see no alternative to using this method. The retrospectiveaccount of Dragon Rouge history consists of both facts and filteredaccounts, and functions partly as a founding legend providing anair of mystique and authenticity to the order.4.1.1 Thomas KarlssonThe history of Dragon Rouge begins with the order’s founderThomas Karlsson. Karlsson, born 1972 in Stockholm, Sweden,reports having had extra-corporeal experiences from the age of threeonwards. As a result of this, Karlsson did not experience a clearborder between waking perception and sleep, something ofimportance for his later magic development. Because theseexperiences manifested themselves at such an early age, they neverseemed all that strange. It was not until the age of 1267 that Karlssonrealized his experiences could be regarded as occult. (IF mgt 2001/49). He recounts having been fascinated with myths, religion andsymbols, by the operas of Richard Wagner and by surrealist artistssuch as Salvador Dalí, as well as having been encouraged in thetwo last-mentioned indulgences by his parents. (IF 2001/1:3).At the age of 12, Karlsson started experimenting with the occulttogether with a friend of about the same age. The experimentingincluded trying to evoke demons by using grimoires68, using a quija67 On an intriguing, though trivial, note Jesus Christ is stated to havebeen the same age when he drove the merchants out of the temple.68 Medieval handbooks on magic, usually containing spells, incantationsand descriptions of demonic entities."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"162CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONboard (IF mgt 2001/49), as well as visiting cemeteries and pre-Christian sites of worship. By this time Karlsson and his friend hadbeen joined by other people, forming a loose group. According toKarlsson, he himself was the most active of them all, even havingcontact with much older magicians. The first occult organizationsKarlsson contacted were two spiritualist associations in theStockholm region, Sanningssökarna [The Seekers of Truth] andStockholms Spiritualistiska Förening (SSF) [Stockholm SpiritualistAssociation]. He discovered early on that the border between seriousspirituality and utter nonsense could be quite hazy in occult circles(IF mgt 2001/49). Karlsson did not try to channel spirits in theSpiritualist fashion and was drawn early on to darker forms ofspirituality (IF mgt 2001/49). (IF 2001/1:3)Among the earliest written accounts of the occult whichKarlsson absorbed were books by Eliphas Lévi (Alphonse ConstantLouis), Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton,as well as folklore-black magic books and some general works onthe occult (IF mgt 2001/49). Literature by Aleister Crowley andAnton Szandor LaVey entered the picture somewhat later. Crowleyproved inspiring as his texts were so multifaceted, whereas LaVey’sworldview seemed all too materialistic. (IF mgt 2001/49). Karlssonstudied the occult with such intensity that his schoolwork sufferedat times. The occult studies did not, however, have a solely negativeimpact on his more mundane studies, as Karlsson, at the age of 14,held a school presentation on Aleister Crowley and magic for asomewhat confused audience consisting of his fellow pupils and,in Karlsson’s words, a “somewhat impressed teacher”. (IF 2001/1:3).By the time Karlsson reached the age of 17, his small gatheringof occultist had already expanded into a regular group practisingmagic and studying occultism. Karlsson himself had regular contactwith a 25-year-old male, who in turn had contacts with prominentfigures in occult circles. According to Karlsson, the focus of his groupwas dark, although not satanic. Besides the workings with his owngroup, Karlsson also had contact with other magicians andoccultists, attended shamanic meetings and witches meetings,participated in Yoga-courses, met and discussed with Heavy MetalSatanists and ‘New Age’ consultants. He also worked in the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"163CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONVattumannen esoteric bookshop in Stockholm, as well as doing tarotreadings at the shop Jolanda den tredje. It is safe to say that Karlssonhad immersed himself deeply in the esoteric and alternative-spiritual Stockholm of the late 1980s.A very important influence for the forming of Dragon Rougewas the contact with a group based in Gothenburg, Sweden,practising yezidic and typhonian69 magic. According to Karlsson,the Gothenburg-based group was quite loosely and unofficiallyorganised and studied the darker aspects of spirituality. (IF mgt2001/49). Karlsson reports having learnt many of the terms andconcepts later used in Dragon Rouge from this particular group, aswell as having received some important texts and artefacts from it.The texts received mostly dealt with the Draconian force and wereinspired by the qabalah, as well as some texts consisting of yezidicmaterial (IF mgt 2001/49). This group gave Karlsson the impetusto go ahead and start an actual magic order. The group alsosuggested using the red dragon as the main symbol.At about this time, in the late 1980s, Karlsson visited Moroccoin the company of, in Karlsson’s words, an insane Englishman withsuicidal tendencies. An event of crucial importance for the formingof Dragon Rouge occurred during this visit to Morocco: Karlssonvisited the famous Jamaâ El-Fna Square in Marrakech, encountereda Dervish (a Sufi/Muslim mystic), and received the followingprophetical announcement from him: “The old shall be destroyedand a temple shall be build for the Red Dragon” (IF 2001/1:370).After the encounter, Karlsson returned to Sweden and formedDragon Rouge with the help of his nearest friends and companions.(IF 2001/1:3).69 The branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis founded by Kennth Grant (seesection 2.1.4) is called the Typhonian O.T.O. It is possible that the groupmentioned by Karlsson worked with Grant-inspired magic. There are similaritiesbetween Grantian magick and Dragon Rouge. For example, Grant speaks ofthe Draconian Current as the original spirituality, incorporates the qliphoth inhis material and considers it imoprtant to balance the positive and negativeaspects of existence (see Grant 1994a; 1994b).70 “det gamla ska gå under och att ett tempel ska byggas åt den rödadraken”."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONAt present, Karlsson is a PhD student in the department of theHistory of Religions at the University of Stockholm. He is writing athesis on Johannes Bureus and Gothic qabala, with an approachcombining the history of religions and the history of ideas(information from personal correspondence with Thomas Karlsson).Karlsson points out that his aim is to keep his esoteric practiceseparate from his academic work, and that his sources are differentwhen operating in each sphere.4.1.2 The Founding and Development of DragonRougeOn Dragon Rouge website one can read that “Dragon Rouge wasinofficially [sic] founded 1989 by seven young magicians with ThomasK. as the main character” (Dragon Rouge 2004b. See also DragonRouge 2001c). One can further read that the organization wasfounded “following the advice from a circle of old Yezidi-Tyfonianmagicians who left their great work of awakening the dragon forceto their younger inheritors”. One can assume that the older Yezidi-Tyfonian magicians consist of the Gothenburg-based groupmentioned in section 4.1.1. On New Year’s Eve, 1989/1990, DragonRouge was formally, and under ceremonial proceedings, openedfor the public (Dragon Rouge 2001a, Dragon Rouge 1996/1:7, Frisk1998:142). In 1989 Dragon Rouge had existed as a closed order (IF2001/1:8).Thomas Karlsson says that Dragon Rouge “started as anunprejudiced search for a darker spiritual ideology or path, with afascination for the symbols encircling the Left Hand Path” (IF mgt2001/49). He goes on to say that organizations such as theTyphonian Ordo Templi Orientis (see footnote 69) and Temple ofSeth were inspirational in the beginning, but also that Dragon Rougehas come to evolve differently from these organizations. At first,meetings were held in the homes of members and magic workingsin nature were important, practice being of key importance fromthe very beginning, as the accentuated theory-centeredness of manymagic organizations was the very impetus for forming Dragon"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"165CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONRouge. Thomas Karlsson had early on been irritated by the seeminglack of practice and all too much focus on theory found in themagical organizations he had come into contact with. (IF mgt 2001/49).When asked about the importance of Anton LaVey’s writingsfor Dragon Rouge, Karlsson responded that they might have playeda more important part in the early Dragon Rouge, even thoughSatanism has never played any major part at all (IF mgt 2001/49).A common idea among the active members of the organization isthat LaVey’s writings may have sparked the interest in the darkeraspects of spirituality among many Dragon Rouge members, butthat the members all eventually will mature, or already havematured, beyond LaVey’s kind of satanic philosophy. LaVey’sSatanism is seen as something possibly belonging to the individualmember’s past but as being, at least in some ways, ill suited to thephilosophy of Dragon Rouge (see IF mgt 2001/51).The number of members involved in Dragon Rouge grewconsiderably in the mid 1990s (IF mgt 2001/49). This was probablydue to the extensive media attention given to the order. In 1995,Dragon Rouge held a ceremony where the child of two of themembers was baptized (Frisk 1998:142; Nilsson 1995a; 1995b).Representatives for the Swedish tabloid newspaper Aftonbladetattended the ceremony and wrote a highly critical article labellingDragon Rouge a satanic organization. The child in question wassaid to have been baptized in the name of Satan, when theceremonies involved in the event never implied anything of thesort (Nilsson 1995a; 1995b; SVT 1 1996. Frisk 1998: 142, is also of theopinion that the baptism was not a satanic one).What actually took place, according to the order, was a ritualwhere the Draconian force, also seen as the life-force of the universeas well as the life-force immanent in every living being, waschannelled for the benefit of the child being baptized (SVT 1 1996).The parents of the child were, however, outspoken Satanists andtheir beliefs and values were taken to represent the totality of DragonRouge (IF 2001/1:8). Dragon Rouge made the headlines due to thisincident, and the headlines consequently attracted more mediacoverage (see for example Götebrogsposten 1997; Stugart 1995; 1996;SVT 1 1996; Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå 1997). A member told me"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONabout an incident where Veckorevyn, a Swedish magazine aimed atadolescent girls, had featured an article called Satanists Molest YoungWomen and included a photograph of this particular member. Thephotograph had been taken from the earlier article in Aftonbladetand the article in Veckorevyn had nothing in particular to do withDragon Rouge (IF mgt 2001/51). Needless to say, my informantdid not have anything to do with any form of molestation of young(or for that matter old) women. The whole incident was even givensome attention in Finland, as the anti-Satanist Riku Rinne mentionedthe baptism in his book Pimeys väistyy (The Darkness Yields) (Rinne1996:13-16).Most likely due to the media coverage, more possible adherentsbecame to be aware of the existence of Dragon Rouge. The numberof members doubled from about 250 to 500 in a very short time (IFmgt 2001/53). Veteran members of the organization view the eventsof the mid 1990s somewhat ambiguously. On the one hand, themedia coverage gave the Dragon Rouge publicity, which helpedthe organization to gain a considerable increase in the number ofserious members. On the other hand, some of the members attractedwere not interested in spiritual aspirations, but mainly in thesensationalist Dragon Rouge portrayed by the media, a portrayalthat Thomas Karlsson and the inner circle of the order did not feelrepresented Dragon Rouge very well (IF mgt 2001/49, 53).During the early days of Dragon Rouge, the membership paper,which in 1990 was called Quintessens (IF 2001/1:8; Bjarke 1991),came out irregularly, largely due to the fact that it had to be copiedmanually, but also because of the lack of time and material. ThomasKarlsson was almost solely responsible for the functioning of theorganization. The meetings, the first of which were officially heldin 1991, and the organizational structure were irregular. Themeetings, mostly practice-oriented, usually took place in the homeof an early member, or alternatively as practical magic workings inan outdoor setting. A long-time Dragon Rouge member attachesgreat importance to the media attention on the organization duringits early days. He notes: “The number of members started to riseand then one day the media became aware of us” (IF 2001/1:871).71 “Medlemsantalet började att växa och så en dag fick media nys om oss”."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"167CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONThe first media-appearance, apparently in 1991 (see Arlebrand 1995:11), was on a Swedish television programme called Fri zon (FreeZone).My informant blames the youth and naivety of the organizationfor the somewhat misrepresentative image given of the DragonRouge. The media-appearances were viewed as good PR and, asDragon Rouge wanted to expand and attract more interesting andsuitable members in Sweden, as something necessary. The media-appearances Dragon Rouge took part in during the following yearsaccomplished this. Earlier, the few non-serious, and at times evenbordering on slanderous, media statements that had not matteredduring the earlier days of the order now began to matter as DragonRouge and its number of members grew. Contact with the mediastarted to assume large proportions, and the final blow came withthe very negative article in the Swedish evening paper, Aftonbladet,mentioned earlier. Something radical had to be done.The media-attention attracted an increasing number ofmembers, a great many of these unserious and attracted by themisrepresentations of Dragon Rouge as something sensationalistand satanic. This combined with a state of organizational structure,which was not really modelled for such a large number of members,created big problems for the order. My informant feels that theorganizational structure of Dragon Rouge in the mid 1990s couldhave accommodated about 50 members, the system basicallyrequiring that the central administration personally knew allmembers, whereas the actual number of members had grown toabout 500. (IF 2001/1:8).Two long-time members had by this time started to helpKarlsson with the compiling and copying of membership papersbut the management of the task, based on manual labour, as wellas managing the members-register, which was a combination ofhandwritten and typewritten lists, still became too big a job. For atime, key figures in the Dragon Rouge management consideredclosing the organization and going back to being a closed order.However, the decision to go on with the help of some radicalorganizational changes was taken. The following core elementswhere agreed upon:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"168CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATION•Withdrawal from the media, or only appearing in mediacontexts which seem to have special relevance andwhich are beneficial to the order and its practice in someway.•A rationalization of the administration, that is to say, amore effective management.•A division of the workload, one member taking overthe layout of the members’ paper as well as themanagement of the membership register.•Leaving the task of copying of the members’ paper andother members’ circulars to a professional copying firm.•A restructuring of the register of membership, makingit easier to discover which members had renewed theirmembership fee, as well as sending out remittance slipsto members when it was time for them to renew theirmembership.•Editing and introducing a correspondence course inmagic. (IF 2001/1:8).In connection with these changes Dragon Rouge acquired its firstpremises, and in these the first Dragon Rouge temple was built.Three female Dragon Rouge members opened a magic shop calledMandragora as well. An annual meeting was held for the first time.During this first meeting the following was agreed upon:•Set the publication of the membership paper (calledDracontias since number 1/2002, earlier Draksådd forthe Swedish version and Cauda Draconis for the versionsin other languages) to four times a year.•A slight increase of the membership fee•The goal of attracting members outside Sweden•A reworking of the correspondence course•Creating a homepage on the Internet. (IF 2001/1:8).According to my informant, most of the goals were achieved withina year of the decisions having been made. A first homepage hadbeen created (Thomas Karlsson and the other key membersrecognize Internet as one of the main sources for attracting foreign"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"169CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONmembers) and a few members outside Sweden had joined the order.The division of the workload continued, as another long-timemember took on the responsibility of translating the membershippaper into English, calling the English version Cauda Draconis. Later,Dragon Rouge lost its first premise and acquired a new, morepermanent one. As for the membership categories, non-seriousmembers eventually ceased to be members, as they did not renewtheir membership, and the percentage of active members greatlyincreased because of this. (IF 2001/1:8)4.2.1 Organizational StructureDragon Rouge is organized in three layers. The outer layer consistsof all members who have paid the yearly membership fee. (IF 2001/1:3). These members receive a publication for members, Dracontias,four times a year. Most courses and meetings arranged by theStockholm section of Dragon Rouge are open to the public, that isto say, to people who have not paid the membership fee. Membersreceive a discount on the cost of the courses though, as well as havingthe possibility to attend meetings not open to the public, such asthe annual meetings, usually arranged in the summertime (seeDragon Rouge 2000a-c; 2001a; 2001f-i). Some lodges have differentpolicies regarding the admittance of non-members to meetings. Forexample, lodge Helheim, situated in Gothenburg, has a stricterpolicy, not allowing non-members to attend so easily (Dragon Rouge2001d).Dragon Rouge members have the opportunity of takingcorrespondence courses in magic, which in turn makes it possiblefor them to be initiated and gain deeper insights into the magicsystem of Dragon Rouge (Dragon Rouge 2000a-c; 2001a; 2001f-i).Completing the first initiation gives the member access to the secondorganizational level (IF 2001/1:3). Besides deeper insight into themagic system, initiation into the degrees also gives admittance tosome of the courses in which only members initiated up to a certaindegree are allowed. Usually these courses are more elaborate andrequire more serious and/or insightful participants. The degree"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"170CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONrequirements for these courses are usually degree 1.0 or havingstarted the first correspondence course (the first degree to beinitiated into: for more information on the initiatory system seesection 4.2.4), sometimes degree 2.0 or having started the secondcorrespondence course (see Dragon Rouge 2000a-c; 2001a; 2001f-i).After having been initiated into the third degree, the initiateenters the third organizational structure, the Dragon Order. Theinitiate swears the Dragon Oath, basically ceremonially declaringhim- or herself to be willing to be more deeply involved in the workof magic, as well as in the organization’s inner workings. Initiationinto the third degree and the swearing of the Dragon Oath givesthe initiate admittance to the inner core of Dragon Rouge, knownas the Inner Circle. (IF 2001/1:3). The taking of magic oaths wasseen by Aleister Crowley as beneficial for the magician’sdevelopment. He saw magical oaths as expressions of Will, andfurthermore as something that one should not, or could not, break(see Crowley 1977: 62). The division of the system in two is similarto the structure of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, wheremembers where initiated into the Second Order after receiving thefifth degree (see section 2.1.3). The difference is that the First Orderactivities of Golden Dawn where strictly theoretical, while theDragon Rouge initiate focuses on practice from the very start.The administrative tasks of Dragon Rouge are divided betweenfive main members. Thomas Karlsson is mostly active in theorganization’s ideological formation, as well as holding most of thecourses and meetings and writing a great deal of the magic material.Another member takes care of the register of members and most ofthe mundane tasks concerning magic material, such as the graphiclayout. A third long-time member is responsible for thecorrespondence between the order and members abroad, as well asholding some courses. Two more recent members have taken overthe work on the homepage and the main correspondence withSwedish-speaking members, respectively, from the threeaforementioned persons. (IF 2001/1:8; IF mgt 2001/48; personalobservations)."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"171CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATION4.2.2 MembershipAn article in the Swedish evening paper, Aftonbladet, in 1995 claimsa membership of about 200 members for Dragon Rouge, whereasthe organization itself is reported to claim about 300 members(Nilsson 1995a; 1995b). In an article in Dagens Nyheter in 1996 along-time member of Dragon Rouge states the number of membersof the organization to be 300 (Stugart 1996). An official inquiry madein 1998 by the social department of the Swedish government statesthat the number of paying members of Dragon Rouge is 350 (SOU1998: 65). The numbers are said to be taken from the Catalogue ofChurches, Denominations and Movements in Sweden 1998 (Katalog överkyrkor, samfund och rörelser i Sverige 1998) and to be accurate asof 20th August, 1998. Liselotte Frisk writes that the organization wassaid to have had about 400 members in 1997 (Frisk 1998: 143).A long-time member of the organization stated in 1997 that thenumber of members of the order was 400, and further that thenumber of members was about 15 when he first joined (Johnsson1997). In a questionnaire, one member informs me that he joined in1991 and that the number of members at that time was about 20 (IF2001/1:8). In Arlebrand (et al.) it can be read that the organizationreported a membership of 500 people in 1997 (Arlebrand et al. 1998:89, 112). In 2001 the number involved in Dragon Rouge was said tobe about 200 members in Sweden, about 70 members in Germany(information obtained at the 2001 Annual meeting) and 50-75members outside Sweden and Germany (IF 2001/1:8). This wouldgive Dragon Rouge about 300-350 paying members. Incorrespondence with a member responsible for the administrationaltasks regarding membership in 2004, I was informed that the orderhad about 130 members in Sweden, 34 members in Germany and16 members in Italy. The total number of members is estimated tobe about 250 persons.The numbers of members given must not, however, be takenat a face value. With movements of the network kind, which DragonRouge could be described as, membership can be very loose. If onecounts a membership of 250 persons one must remember that thisis the number of people who have currently paid the annual"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"172CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONmembership fee of the order. Having paid the membership fee doesnot mean that the member is an active member, that is to say takespart in courses and meetings etc. Apart from this, non-membersmay take part in meetings and courses, at least the courses open tonon-members. Thirdly, organizations always affect the surroundingsociety and often instigate some kind of social response. In my view,the people involved in an organization in this way may very wellbe counted in the organization’s field of influence. In the case ofDragon Rouge, the organization has triggered a great deal of mediaattention and thus probably, at least at certain times, instigated amoderate response for or against the organization. One maytherefore say that Dragon Rouge, without doubt, has affected thelives of a great many more than the 250 people enrolled as membersat the time of writing.Regarding the age-spread of members, the official website ofthe order states that it has members of all ages (Dragon Rouge2004b). The average age of members is said to be about 18-30 (IF2001/1:8). According to my own experience the statement regardingthe average age of Dragon Rouge members is quite correct, althoughthe most active members seem to be around the ages of 25-35. Theaverage non-Swedish member seems to be somewhat older, rangingfrom about 25 to 40 years of age. According to a former member,the order used to have members as young as 13 in 1996 (IF 2001/1:13).Utilizing James A. Beckford’s model for classification of socialmovements and, more particularly, the participation in socialmovements, one may distinguish between different degrees ofparticipation. I consider a short presentation of Beckford’s modelin order here (Based on Beckford 1985: 76-93). Beckford’s model isa twofold one, focusing on External Relationships, that is to say, therelations between the movement members and the surroundingsociety, and Internal Relationships, that is to say, the relation themovement’s members have to the movement itself and each other.I will disregard the external relationships as they are irrelevant inthe present context. Regarding internal relationships, Beckforddistinguishes between five different types: Apostates, Patrons, Clients,Adepts and Devotees. The types range roughly from lesserparticipation to greater participation in the movement."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"173CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONThe apostate and patron types differ somewhat from the otherthree types. Apostates are former movement members who for somereason no longer participate actively in the movement’s activitiesand, according to Beckford, therefore no longer have many socialrelationships with active movement members. Patrons are non-members who give their support to the movement, be it economicor ideological. Beckford recognises that there are many possiblemodes of apostasy, for example making it possible for an apostateto function as a patron. In cases where the former member has anegative attitude to his former movement, the types apostate andpatron do, of course, not correspond. (Beckford 1985: 83-84).Clients approach the movement in order to attain certainbenefits without letting their involvement in the movement affecttheir life much outside the movement. Adepts are more deeplyinvolved in the movement, regarding it as an important part of theirlife and letting their involvement affect larger parts of their everydaylife. Devotees are members who are highly involved in themovement and invest greatly in it, both economically, emotionallyand time-wise. For devotees, the involvement in the movement isreflected in all or most parts of their life outside it. Movementauthorities affect the life of the three latter types in various degrees,ranging from the subtle or implicit and encompassing only somespecific areas of the member’s life in the case of clients, to the explicitand encompassing most, or all, areas of the member’s life in thecase of devotees. (Beckford 1985: 82-83).Regarding Dragon Rouge, I have met or talked with memberswho can be situated in most of the five categories. I have come acrossapostates (both former members who have adopted a negativeapproach to the order, as well as members who function as patronsin giving a positive account of the order to me), patrons, adeptsand devotees. Clients could probably also be found, but may beharder to reach as well as harder to motivate to aid me in myresearch.In my master’s thesis I proposed that most members of DragonRouge could probably be seen as belonging to an amalgam of theclient and adept types (Granholm 2000: 76). I would now like torevise my statement and propose a somewhat different solution. Istill believe that most members can be seen as an amalgam of the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"174CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONclient and adept types, meaning that they receive the organization’smaterial, at the very minimum reading the membership paper sentto them four times a year, and maybe participating in some of themeetings and courses. The client-adepts do not let their DragonRouge involvement affect all areas of their life but do, however,view their magic practice as being very important and influentialin their life. However, most of the members I have met, discussedwith or received answers to questionnaires from, conform to theadept or devotee types in Beckford’s model. This is only naturaland to be expected when doing research on social movements, asthe members who have taken the time and effort to aid me in myresearch most likely have a deeper involvement in the organizationthan members who do not feel as motivated to participate in theresearch.The question of the movement or its authorities influencingthe everyday life of members is somewhat problematic. Mostmembers I have heard from argue that their involvement in DragonRouge, and more specifically their magic practice, has changed theirlife profoundly and that all aspects of their more mundane life areinfused by their magic practice. This can, however, be seen as adiscursive strategy (see sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2) playing on theimportance of magic, and does not necessarily mean that everydaydecisions made by my informants have changed in any major way.Nevertheless, I feel that my informants’ opinions should be treatedwith respect, including their opinions suggesting a changed outlookon everyday decisions. The decisions made have not necessarilychanged, but the way the informant views his/her choices anddecisions most certainly has. The member’s magic practice andorganizational involvement has opened him/her up to a new wayof perceiving the world around him/her, filtering his/herobservations through glasses tinted by magic knowledge.Regarding the order itself affecting the everyday life of itsmembers, the influence may range from non-existent to very smallfor most members. As Dragon Rouge has a highly anti-authoritariancharacter, similar to most (other) neopagan movements (see Lewis1996b: 3; Harvey 1997: 212-214), and does not maintain any clearrules about how one should lead one’s life, it is unlikely thatmembers would approach the organization’s materials searching"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"175CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONfor authoritative statements on how to lead their lives. For the mostactive members, the ones most suitably described as devotees, thesituation is different. For these members, life in Dragon Rouge isprofoundly interwoven with their everyday life, in the form ofconcerns about the organization’s finances, ideological andorganizational development etc.Beckford’s model has, however, like all models, certainlimitations, particularly with regard to Dragon Rouge. Manymembers express sentiments towards the order through which theycould be placed in the client category. Dragon Rouge functions as ameeting place where the member may meet other practicingmagicians and maybe learn from their experience. Whenparticipating in the activities no longer feels compelling they stopgoing to meetings and no longer renew their annual membershipfee. However, regarding the practice of magic the answer is different.Magic can not be abandoned so easily: “once a magician always amagician” is something I have heard Dragon Rouge members sayon more than one occasion. Where does one place members of thiskind in Beckford’s model, members who act as clients towards theorganization and as devotees towards the practice of (specificallyDragon Rouge type) magic. I have even experienced this withmembers who are apostates in relation to the organization.4.2.2.1 GenderAccording to Dragon Rouge, the percentage correlation betweenmale and female members in the order has varied throughout theorder’s history. At the beginning the percentage of male memberswas at least 75 %. During the mid 1990s, when the number ofmembers grew rapidly, the percentage of female members grew toabout 60 %. In recent years the percentage of male and femalemembers has been about 50-50, with a slight preponderance of malemembers. (IF 2001/1:8). From my experience during my field workin 2001-2004, female attendance at the meetings and courses atDragon Rouge Stockholm is slightly lower than male attendance.Of about 8 to 15 members attending, about 1 to 5 have been female."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"176CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONThis is, however, something that my informants recognize (IF 2001/1:8). If one were to draw conclusions regarding the percentage offemale members in the organization from empirical observationsat meetings, one would arrive at an estimated 20-30 %. This wouldnot, however, include members who do not participate in collectiveactivities, but who have paid the membership fee and who couldbe working with the correspondence course. As I cannot, and wouldnot out of respect for individual members’ integrity, access theregister of Dragon Rouge members, I have no way of checking theaccuracy of my informant’s estimate. As my informant hasdeveloped and worked on the current members register since themid 1990s, and has insight on the matter, I believe he can be regardeda reliable source.Dragon Rouge seems to be very keen on having a balance offemale and male members. This may in part be due to the slightpreponderance of male members combined with the ideologicalaspiration to focus on female magical, religious and mythiccharacters and themes. According to Thomas Karlsson, about onethird of the members of the Inner Circle are female, with slightlyless in the initiatory Inner Circle and slightly more in theorganizational (IF 2001/1:3). According to another informant, a longtime-member to be considered a regular member of the Inner Circle,most of the members in the administration and other key positionsin the order are male. He is, however, very specific in pointing outthat this is something the organization has tried to counteract. Hebelieves that the reason why men hold the key positions is due tofemale members being less active in the collective aspect of the orderand working more individually, thus not becoming involved withadministrative and other tasks. According to one of my informants,the male domination in the administration is proof of the order nothaving any kind of gender hierarchy, as some of the most tiresomeand mundane aspects of the order’s work, such as posting mail etc,is done here. (IF 2001/1:8).Almost all of the Dragon Rouge material is written by malemembers and likewise almost all of the courses, meetings etc. areheld by male members. The order does, however, express the desireto have more female members participating more actively and hasinstigated specific female groups within the order. The belief is that"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"177CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONgroups of this kind can function to activate female members tobecome involved in the order’s inner concerns, as well as takingcare of their own individual evolution in magic. (IF 2001/1:8; IFmgt 2001/57-58).As one can see, the Inner Circles of the order are very male-dominated, although the order has a stated goal of involving morefemale members in its inner affairs, and has a strong discourse onwomen’s rights. The Inner Circles consist of long-time and highinitiated members, who have invested the most in the order, bothtime-wise and emotionally (see section 4.2.3). Those who have beenmembers for the longest time are all male. There are no activewomen in the mother-order in Stockholm who have been membersfor as long as the male members of the Inner Circle. There are,however, a few women who have been with the order for aconsiderable length of time, and begin to take on more official tasks.Examples are the Stockholm-based female members of the women’sgroup. Lodge Magdan in Poland is run by female members, andthe Italian lodge Sothis has at least one leading female member. Ihave no current information on the other lodges.4.2.3 The Inner CircleThe Inner Circle of Dragon Rouge is the inner core of the orderresponsible for the administrative, ideological, economic and otherpractical issues of the order. The Inner Circle comprises of variousindividuals who have taken a more active role in the organization,meaning that one is not elected into the Inner Circle through somesort of democratic elections. I have been informed that the InnerCircle has a dynamic structure, the constitution of which dependson the questions discussed (IF mgt 2001/49; IF 2001/1:8).According to Thomas Karlsson, the Inner Circle is not one body,constant in its structure. The Circle consists of persons from thefollowing categories: members who have been in Dragon Rouge thelongest time; the most active members; the most competent members;the members who have attained the highest degrees in the initiatorysystem and the lodge masters and leaders of the various spheres of"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"178CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATION72 “...någon som engagerar sig i DR regelbundet (antingen sommötesdeltagare, som magikursutövare, som medarbetare e.dyl)”.interest. (IF 2001/1:3). When asked what counts as being an activemember, Karlsson responded: “...someone who is involved inDragon Rouge on a regular basis (either as a participant in meetings,as a practitioner of magic, as a co-worker etc.)” (IF 2001/1:372).One long-time member feels that members who take part inthe correspondence course and/or attend meetings, seminars andcourses, can be said to be active. He goes on to say that probably 75% of the members outside Sweden are active, whereas about 50 %of the members in Sweden are. The smaller percentage of activemembers in Sweden, when compared to the percentage outside thecountry, is due to the order being better known in Sweden, andthus attracting more peripheral members. (IF 2001/1:8). The factthat the average age of Swedish members is a bit lower than theaverage age of foreign members may play a role in the lesser degreeof activeness of the Swedish members. Dragon Rouge is probablythe first occult organization most of the Swedish members havejoined, whereas the older non-Swedish members may haveparticipated in other orders, or at least become better acquaintedwith the field, thus making their decision to join the order on amore reflexive and aware base.According to my observations, the ideological Inner Circle ofDragon Rouge consists quite constantly of three main members.Thomas Karlsson, and two other members who have been involvedin the order since 1991. These are the most long-time members, andhave actively participated in Dragon Rouge for well over ten years.These three persons have produced the vast majority of the order’smaterial, and have, since they have much experience in magicpractice, largely formed the Dragon Rouge system. Other membersdo produce material, published for example in the member’s paper,but are not involved in decision-making processes in any higherdegree. The lodges have their own inner circles, consisting of thelodge leader and those active members who work in close co-operation with him/her. Officially the lodges have five coremembers: the lodge leader, vice lodge leader, treasurer, scribe andan additional member with variable function (see section 4.2.4)."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"179CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONThe Inner Circle of the mother-order is at times, for examplewhen issues of major impact for the order as a whole are treated,complemented by the lodge leaders of the various lodges. Also,when questions concerning various specific theme-groups, such asthe women’s group, are treated, the representatives of these maybe contacted.As Dragon Rouge is a quite small order, the administrativeInner Circle of the mother-order, as well as those of the lodges,consists mainly of the same persons involved in the ideological InnerCircle. This is natural, as it is these persons who have invested mostin the order and are the most involved and active of the members.In Stockholm the administrative Inner Circle consists of theideological Inner Circle aided by, mainly, two other members (seeIF 2001/1:3; 9).Members of the Inner Circle have expressed hopes that thesituation where no individual member is crucial for the existenceof the order would arise. The sentiment that Dragon Rouge shouldbe able to exist even if anyone in the active core of the order ceasedto be active for some reason or another has been expressed. (IF 2001/1:8).When members are asked about the Inner Circle the followingpicture emerges:•The Inner Circle consists of long-time Dragon Rougemembers, with more experience than newer members•What distinguishes Inner Circle members from ordinarymembers is that the former have more insight into thefunction of Dragon Rouge as an organization, concerningmembership as well as the degree of advancement ofmembers, the function and activities of the lodges andtaking care of various organizational tasks, such as sendingout the members’ paper and other circulars etc.•Members of the Inner Circle do not treat ordinary membersany differently and are not treated differently themselvesbecause they belong to the Inner Circle. Visitors to theDragon Rouge temple would probably not be able todistinguish Inner Circle members from non-Inner Circlemembers (IF 2001/1:1; 4-5; 8)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"180CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONImportant to note is that the above is a view of the inner circle asderived from members of the order. From my own observations, Ican agree with much of this. What could be added is that, as theinner circle is not an elected forum, a member’s entry into the circlewould have to be affected by that member’s social standing amongthe leading members, at least to some degree. That is to say, a personwho would be qualified on purely magical and activity-based meritswould probably not become a member of the inner circle if he/shewere extremely unpopular among other active members of theorder. This is logical, since functioning as a person in a leadingposition in any kind of organization will require that person to becapable, willing, and indeed allowed, to deal with a vast number ofother individuals.4.2.4 Lodges and Ritual GroupsDragon Rouge was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, but has spreadto several other places in both Sweden and elsewhere. The DragonRouge group in Stockholm is called the mother-order, and it is therethat the central administration of the order is located and where allmajor decisions are made. The local sections of Dragon Rouge,situated in various cities in Sweden and throughout the world, arecalled lodges. These are groups sanctioned by the mother-organization and officially working with the Dragon Rouge materialand magic-system.There are at the time of writing (January 2005) one lodge,besides the mother-organization, in Sweden, one in Germany, onein Italy and one in Poland. The Swedish lodge is called lodgeSinistra, is located in Malmö, and was founded in 2001. The Germanlodge, which attained lodge-status in 2004, is called lodge Heldrasiland is located in Thüringen, Germany. Earlier a lodge called lodgeThagirion, founded in 1999, was located in Hagen, Germany(Dragon Rouge 2001j). The German lodge underwent some changesin late 2001, both regarding its practice and leadership, and was fora time called lodge Tunrida (information from personalcorrespondence with a German Dragon Rouge member). The Italian"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"181CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONlodge attained lodge-status in late 2003, is called lodge Sothis, andis located in Naples, Italy. Lodge Magan, situated in Silesia, Poland,attained lodge-status during the fall of 2004.In the fall of 2004, information regarding the earlier lodgeHelheim, located in Gothenburg and founded in the late 1990s, wastaken off the official homepage of the mother-organization. Thiswas reportedly due to the inactivity of the Gothenburg-based lodge(information received during the 2004 annual meeting). DragonRouge has had several earlier lodges, most of them situated inSweden, but with one earlier lodge situated in Finland. The lodgeshave a lodge-degree between 1 and 5 reflecting, the time the lodgehas been an official lodge of Dragon Rouge as well as the level ofactivity of the lodge (Dragon Rouge 2001e). Lodges Sothis, Heldrasiland Magan have lodge-degree 1.0, and Sinistra has lodge-degree2.0, as did lodge Helheim. (Dragon Rouge 2004d).Dragon Rouge currently has two ritual groups, one of themsituated outside Sweden and one situated in Sweden. The ritualgroups have no official names and are identified by their locationas ritual group Växjö (Växjö, Sweden) and ritual group Prague(Prague, the Czech Republic). Ritual groups during the period 2000-2003, not counting the ritual groups which have since then becomeofficial lodges, have existed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and at anunspecified location in Germany (IF mgt 2001/49-50; IF 2001/1:8).A long-time member of Dragon Rouge divides the lodges intothree generations (IF 2001/1:8). The first-generation lodges wereall situated in Sweden in cities like Gävle, Östersund andGothenburg. The member in question equates these with the DragonRouge ritual groups of today, as they where not as organized as thecurrent lodges. All of the first generation lodges have ceased to exist.The lodge in Gävle was called Black Earth Lodge (Håkansson 1991),and was active in the early 1990s. The second generation of lodgesconsisted of lodge Helheim in Gothenburg (a new lodge, differentfrom the earlier one in Gothenburg), lodge Odin in Karlshamn and,another lodge in Sundsvall. With the second generation of lodgesthe activities where more organised, with some exceptions. LodgeHelheim and lodge Odin started contributing with material andworking in closer co-operation with the mother-order in Stockholmand the lodge in Sundsvall ceased to exist. Lodge Odin, active in"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"182CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONKarlshamn from mid 1997 to 2001 (IF 2001/1:2), ceased to be anactive lodge in early 2001 due to problems in managing the lodgeas well as to the opening of lodge Sinistra in Malmö, quite nearKarlshamn.In 1998, the members’ paper began to be published in Englishas Cauda Draconis, in conjunction with Draksådd, the originalSwedish equivalent, successfully opening the organization for non-Swedish speaking members. Lodge Thagirion, opened in Hagen in1999, took on the job of organizing lodge-activities in Germany aswell as translating Cauda Draconis into German. (IF 2001/1:8).The first lodge of the third generation was opened in Malmö,Sweden, in February 2001 (IF 2001/1:8). The third generation oflodges is exposed to far stricter rules than the earlier two generations(IF mgt 2001:49; IF 2001/1:8). Details of these rules are given furtheron in this section. The lodges of the second generation have,according to Dragon Rouge, functioned very well and continue toexist as fully fledged lodges beside the lodges of the third generation(IF 2001/1:8).The characteristics of the lodges and ritual groups differ fromeach other a great deal (IF 2001/1:8). Whereas the mother-orderhas quite an inclusive agenda regarding its practice and overallimage, the lodges for the most part have specialized in someparticular tradition or theme. Lodge Helheim focused on the darkeraspects of Nordic mythology as well as on the Gothic in art andliterature. Lodge Sinistra has something of an academic approach.Lodge Sinistra has also focused on the 19th century artistic milieuand its preference for decadence. Lodge Thagirion focused verymuch on European paganism, the Nordic tradition andDemonology. As lodge Tunrida, the German lodge reportedlyfocused on much the same themes and also worked actively withrunic Yoga (personal correspondence with a German Dragon Rougemember). Focus on the Nordic tradition, on qliphotic qabalah andTantrism in the form of Kundalini-Yoga is common to all of thelodges, largely due to the mother-order’s endorsement of thesethemes and techniques.The rules for opening a lodge or starting a ritual group havebecome stricter over time. Earlier it was quite easy to open a lodge,basically you just needed to get the approval from the Dragon Rouge"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"183CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONInner Circle, and as there where no specific rules concerning theopening of lodges, it was quite easy to obtain permission. In 2001,Dragon Rouge established a set of rules for opening lodges andritual groups. (IF mgt 2001/47; 49). The following rules apply whenopening a Dragon Rouge ritual group (Dragon Rouge 2001e):The person wishing to start a ritual group should have met,and been recommended for the task, by some member of the mother-order. If this has not been possible for some reason or other, theperson in question should send a photograph and a description ofhim-/herself, as well as some proof of identity, such as a copy ofhis/her passport, to the mother-order. The person wishing to startthe ritual group should also have begun the first Dragon Rougecorrespondence course in magic (although he/she is not requiredto have finished it when forming the ritual group). The activity of aritual group is also somewhat restricted, as the group is not allowedto call itself Dragon Rouge or to have an official name other thanthe city it is located in. Furthermore, the ritual group does not havethe right to represent Dragon Rouge officially. Quoting the rulesfor starting a ritual group or a lodge “The magical ritual group ...has merely been given approval to work with Dragon Rouge’smaterial under organized forms” (Dragon Rouge 2001e73).The rules for opening a lodge are naturally somewhat stricter.In order to start a lodge one must be initiated to at least degree 1.0of Dragon Rouge and be at least 20 years of age. The person wishingto start the lodge should have started and run a ritual group withregular activity at least once a month successfully for at least a year.The applicant should report on the activities of the ritual group tothe mother-order once a month for at least one year preceding theopening of the lodge, including the signatures of those attendingthe activities.The lodge should consist of a minimum of five active members,organized as lodge master, vice lodge master, treasurer, scribe andone person with an optional function. The requirements for the threefirst are the same as those mentioned for the person opening thelodge, that is to say, initiation into degree 1.0 in Dragon Rouge as73 “Magigruppen ... har enbart fått godkännande att under organiseradeformer arbeta med Dragon Rouges material”."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"184CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONwell as a personal presentation sent together with some proof ofidentity to the mother-organization. The person who wishes tobecome lodge master should be recommended by five active DragonRouge members from the region where the lodge is supposed to beopened, including written motivations as to why this particularperson would be a good lodge master. As a final requirement, thelodge master is obliged to sign a contract regarding the opening ofthe lodge with the mother-organization. I will deal with the specificsof the contract further on. When all of the requirements are met,the lodge is opened in a ceremony headed by representatives of themother-order in Stockholm.In February, 2001, I had the opportunity to attend theceremonial opening of Lodge Sinistra in Malmö Sweden (see section5.1.3).The contract for opening a Dragon Rouge consists of thefollowing 9 points:1.The lodge is approved as a fully fledged part of DragonRouge with the signing of this contract and the approval ofthe directives in it. The lodge can consequently call itselfby a specific lodge name.2.The lodge contract is for a period of two years at a time andis after that extended for another period if the mother-organization and the lodge so wish. If a lodge master wishesto resign his commission to organize the lodge before theend of the period, he undertakes to do this with the approvalof the mother-organization in order to ensure the continuityof the lodge.3.The lodge receives the lodge degree 1.0 when it is approvedas a fully fledged Dragon Rouge lodge.

Often people have a rather negativeattitude towards religious or spiritual organizations which requiretheir members to pay for various services (see Rothstein 1997: 305-306). This is seen as incompatible with the goal of spiritual progressor salvation and, as a result of our Western, Protestant, Christianheritage, is viewed as belonging to the material, non-spiritual realm.The issue of the Scandinavian national churches collecting churchtaxes is not considered in this view.Dragon Rouge has, like every other organization, variousexpenses that need to be dealt with. These include, for example, therent for the premises where the Dragon Rouge temple is situated,costs for printing the correspondence courses, members’ papers andvarious other Dragon Rouge productions, costs for material neededin the practice such as incense, music to meditate to as well as theequipment to play this music on, candles etc., as well as variousother expenses accruing from the activities of the organization.Dragon Rouge has various methods for financing its activities.The membership fee is currently 250 SEK (150 SEK in 2001 and 200SEK in 2002) a year for members living in Sweden, 30 euro formembers living in Europe and 35 euro for members outside Europe($ 20 in 2001) (Dragon Rouge 2001a; 2004a; 2004g). Other sources ofincome for the mother-organization are participant fees for the regularTuesday meetings and the more extensive weekend courses, and theincome from selling the correspondence courses and other printedmaterial. A fund was established in 2002, mainly for the purpose ofestablishing a temple on the island of Gotland (Dragon Rouge 2002a).The fund is financed by arranging special events, such as artexhibitions and festivals, as well as by voluntary donations frommembers. Dragon Rouge is registered as an ideological organization,which means that it does not have to pay income tax."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"187CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATION4.2.6 Initiatory StructureDragon Rouge has an initiatory system consisting of 11 degrees.The system is built upon the 11 qliphotic levels (see section 1.2 formore information on the qliphoth), and the different degrees areconsequently named after the qliphotic levels (Degree 1.0: Lilithetc.). To proceed with the initiation, the member needs to buy thecorrespondence course in magic and do the exercises described init. The course extends over a period of 6 months for courses 1.0 and2.0, and one year for course 3.0. The material for the courses isdivided up over the period so that the customer receives one partof the course every month until he or she has received all of thecourse material. The initiate is also given a personal contact-person,someone who has studied the Dragon Rouge magic system for alonger period, who answers possible questions the initiate mighthave and assists him/her in the studies. During participation inthe higher courses the contact between the initiate and his/her tutoris said to become more and more personal (Dragon Rouge 1996).Upon finishing the first course the initiate is expected to write ashort report of at least one page, summarizing his or her experiencesand feelings during the course. The initiate should also write at leastone page giving his or her view on the draconian magic system. Therequirements are higher for the higher courses. On completing thesecond correspondence course the initiate should write a lengthieressay on his/her experiences, and also express in which directionhe or she would like to steer his/her magical development. Afterfinishing the first course and having sent in the writings dealingwith the initiate’s experiences and view on the Draconian magicsystem, the initiate can be initiated into the first degree of DragonRouge.The initiation can be performed in the company of the initiate’stutor or by the initiate him-/herself, in consultation with his/hertutor. The initiations into the higher levels can no longer be doneby the initiate for him-/herself, the presence and assistance of atleast two persons initiated into Dragon Rouge is required. Lodgemasters can initiate members into the first degree and into halfdegrees between the regular degrees (such as 2.5, a half-degree for"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"188CHAPTER 4 - ORGANIZATIONa member who has already been initiated into degree 2.0 and ispreferably already working with the third course). Only approvedmembers of the mother-organization can, however, initiate membersinto full degrees above degree 1.0.Dragon Rouge members can buy the first and secondcorrespondence course without having been initiated, but the thirdone is strictly for members initiated into the second degree. Afterinitiation into degree three, and further into the Dragon Order, themagical development of the initiate is more closely connected withthe activities of the other members who have attained the higherdegrees and, reportedly, with the development of the organizationas well (information gained during my participation in the 2001annual meeting). There are, as of yet, no correspondence coursesfor degrees above the third one, although there has been somediscussion regarding the possibility of having courses for the higherdegrees as well. At the time of writing (January 2005), there wereno developments on this front.The members initiated into the higher degrees of Dragon Rougehave been reluctant to tell me what degree they hold. The reasonsgiven have been that it is a personal or inner issue not to be divulgedto others, and that the higher degrees are held secret in order forthe grading not to become some sort of competition. What I havebeen told, however, is that not one member has reached the 11thdegree. Even if this would happen, the progress would not stopthere, as a dark magician is never finished with his studies. Theroad is as important as the possible goal.Before the correspondence courses became available74, theinitiations where less ordered. During this period the number ofmembers in Dragon Rouge was smaller, as well as most everymember being Swedish, and the initiations were mostly carried outon the basis of acquaintance. As it was possible for the inner core ofDragon Rouge to personally know almost every member, and havesome insight into their magic workings and development, it wasalso possible for the inner core to teach and initiate members in a74 Correspondence courses have been available since the mid 1990s.

The Golden Dawnincorporated the qabalistic Tree of Life as a model for its initiatorystructure and Dragon Rouge has incorporated the qliphoth, theshadow-side of the qabalistic Tree of Life, into its structure. Insteadof the ten worlds of the sephiroth, Dragon Rouge operats with elevenqliphotic worlds, a number that both Aleister Crowley and KennethGrant identify as the number of magic (see Grant 1994a: 9-10). Grantalso incorporates the qliphoth in his system, as a necessary elementfor attaining high magical initiation (Grant 1994a: 7-8). However,in Grant’s system the qliphoth are entered through the Abyss, Daäth,which can be seen as a shadow sephira beneath the three highestsephiroth, Binah, Chokmah and Kether (see Grant 1994a: 7-8).O.T.O. initially operated with nine functional degrees, and oneadministrational, but received an XIth degree through theinnovations of Aleister Crowley.As said earlier, the degrees are not discussed among highinitiates of the order, and this has been said to be in order to prevent"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"190any competition in regards to degrees.

Dragon Rouge has been preparing a templeon the site and this was the second time the meeting was held atthis location. This was the first time I had attended an annualmeeting on Gotland, out of three attendances all in all. An intensiveweek-long course in magic, with up to seven hours of magicworkings, rituals and meditations each day, was arranged inconnection with the meeting and the majority of the membersattending the annual meeting also took part in the course."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"192CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEThe weather was generally cloudy when I awoke at four a.m.on the morning of Saturday, 24th July, ready to start my journey toGotland. I had already packed the necessities for the comingweekend, of which the most important would be my sleeping bag,my ground sheet and, of course, my trusty notebook and pencils. Istarted out for Nynäshamn Färjeterminal, from where the ferry toVisby, the capital of Gotland, would leave. I met up with a bunchof dark-clad people in their mid-20s to early 30s upon arrival. Longhair as well as shaven heads were predominant among the maletravellers. A total of thirteen Dragon Rouge members boarded theferry to Gotland after shaking hands with each other andintroducing themselves to members they had not already met. Theatmosphere was quite international, as three of the travellers hadcome all the way from Italy, two from Greece and one was ofGerman origin. Together with me from Finland, the number offoreign participants outnumbered the Swedish members. The scenewas dominated by men, as only three female members were present,and only one of them from the Stockholm mother-organization.As we stepped off the ferry after the three hour long journey,we were met by two additional members who were to attend themeeting. The weather was still gloomy when we boarded the busheading towards the interior of the island. A member fromStockholm checked that nobody supposed to be with us was lost.Yet another member boarded the buss at the bus station at Visby.The bus trip took one hour, and now the only stage left on ourjourney before arriving at our destination was a short five-kilometretrip by car. Arriving at our predetermined location, we were greetedby those who had arrived earlier, mostly long-time members of themother-order in Stockholm. Of these six members three were maleand three were female, one of whom was a woman of Scottish origin.Twenty-two persons in total, six of whom women and eight ofwhom foreigners, were present for the annual meeting.Those of us new to the location were shown around the siteand the two temples built there.

Three bunches ofdried flowers hung from the ceiling next to the staircase. As withmost old barn-buildings, the walls were not insulated and therewere gaps between the planks in the walls, allowing for the air topermeate the temple room and the visitor to see outside if he/sheplaced his/her eyes close enough to the wall.

This person rang the bell moving it in a vertical directionand then gave it to the person on his right. This same scenario wasrepeated until the bell reached me. I rang it, moving it up and down,and then gave it back to Thomas. After this initial ritualistic element,the actual meeting started with Thomas giving a brief talk on themythical history of Gotland. The lecture ended with a short openingritual honouring the island and its mythical magic powers. Thomasfaced the altar and read the ritual text whilst holding the gobletcontaining a small quantity of beer in his hand. At certain passageshe would hold up the goblet while the rest of us repeated theceremonial utterings. The ritual ended with Thomas pouring thebeer from the goblet over the circle of stones at the base of the altar.After this he stood in silence for a while, still facing the altar.Upon turning towards us again, Thomas started talking aboutthe founding of the temple in Gotland and gave us detailedinformation on the progress of work on it. The next item on theprogramme was the Dragon Ceremony, which is the most commonceremony in the Dragon Rouge context. I will here give a detaileddescription of the ceremony (see Eriksson 2001: 138-139).Thomas: Melez!Everyone: Melez!Thomas: I call the Dragon, the lord of Ancient Atlantis, you who dwell inthe abyss in the depth of my soul.

Thomas sat down on the bench to participatein the meditation. We sat on the benches with our eyes closed, ourbacks straight and our feet firmly on the ground, partly in order toachieve a close connection with the magical forces of the earth. Webreathed deeply through our noses. ‘Barnabas’ spoke in a calm andslow voice and asked us to feel the wholeness of our bodies andthen to feel another energy, below us in the earth. The rhythm ofour breathing corresponded with, and aligned itself to, the rhythmof the energies below us. As we felt the energies moving up insideus, from the ground through our spines upwards travelling throughthe different chakra centres, we stood up, still with our eyes closed,and stretched our hands towards the sky, in imitation of a tree. Wecrossed our hands in front of our chests, thus closing the flow ofenergy and containing it within our selves. After a while we satdown, taking three deep breaths, and opened our eyes.After this, Thomas presented the next item on the programmeand a third long-time member stood up to give a presentation onthe developments of Dragon Rouge during the past year, as well asinforming us on plans for the future. A few magic groups in Europewere about to attain lodge status and several new magical groupswere to be founded. When finished, at 4.40 pm, he sat down and letThomas present the next item on the programme, the individualpresentations of the lodges. The lodge leader of lodge Sinistra inMalmö started as he represented the oldest existing lodge of theorder with members present at the meeting. He gave quite anacademic address on the past year of lodge Sinistra and the futureplans of the lodge. Witchcraft was identified as one of the importantrecurrent themes.At this point of the meeting, a farmer steered his tractor to thenearby field and started collecting hay. Because of the noise we hada short pause while waiting for the farmer to leave. The atmosphereinstantly became more relaxed and playful, with jokes about thefarmer actually being a Swedish Secret Service agent on a missionto spy on this “dangerous cult”.The next lodge to present its work was the Italian lodge, lodgeSothis. The lodge leader spoke of the activities of the lodge as“practical work on a research and theoretical basis”, thus restatingthe aspirations of the order to be focused primarily on practice, but"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"200CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEbasing this on a deep foundation of actual theoretical research (seesection 4.1.1). As he stepped down, a member from the newly startedritual group in Uppsala, Sweden, took over and gave a shortpresentation of the group’s practice and aspirations. As there wereno more official representatives of additional ritual groups or lodgespresent, ‘Cyrus’ read the greetings from the absent members. Mostof the people presenting the work in their groups also mentionedthe female circle of the order (see section 7.1.6 for more analysis ofthe matter). Throughout this programme, each member present satpatiently and attentively, listening with apparent interest to whatthe current speaker had to say.The next presentation, given by ‘Barnabas’, went under the title“Initiation – to follow a Path to its end”. ‘Barnabas’ stressed theimportance of the individual magician and his/her devotion to themagic path taken, relating this to the importance of the group as asupporting foundation for those who walk this path. The group isnot a rigid organization, stale and dead in its tracks, but rather aliving and dynamic organism, its body consisting of the likewisedynamic individuals of the order.At five-fifteen pm, the often mentioned female circle presentedits work. In distinction to the earlier speakers, all of whom were male,the representatives of the female circle took the stand as a group.‘Drusilla’, ‘Eunice’ and ‘Hepzibah’ stressed the fact that, contrary towhat one might believe because of its name, the female circle is notonly for women. The point of the circle is to work with feminineaspects of the dark and of magic. At the time of the annual meetingthe members of the female circle were all women. They are spreadthroughout the world and thus the actual practical work of the groupis rather difficult. The circle creates magic seals77 based on combinedastral visions78 and holds joint rituals at predetermined times during77 Magic seals are the symbols of superhuman entities which can be usedto conjur and command these beings. Magic seals can be found in, for example,grimoires.78Astral visions refer to perceptions attained on the ‘astral plane’. Astralplane refer to a certain level of existence or perception which is thought to existbeyond the material plane. The magician travels to this planes in his/her ‘astralbody’, which he/she can separate from his material body when in trance.Another idea is that the magician, using mediation, can see into the astral planewithout leaving his/her body."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"201CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEthe full moon, as well as during the dark moon. In this way, ritualsin which all the members of the circle participate are possible eventhough members are scattered around the world. After the ritualsthe members discuss with each other, treating the effects and resultsof the ritual. The members had experienced many shared visions,and were working on creating pathworkings79 based on these. Thepremise of the circle is that women channel the feminine forcesdifferently from men.The last item on the programme before the dinner break, was‘Aaron’s’ presentation of the Dragon in Arabic literature andmythology. He concluded his presentation by leading the DragonCeremony in Arabic. Again the rest of us repeated the power wordsas ‘Aaron’ raised the magic wand as a signal for us. At about 17.35,we took a break. The initial discussions mainly concerned the lastpresentation, and specifically the Arabic version of the ‘house-ceremony’ of the order. Quite soon the discussions extended toinclude more mundane matters, such as music and film. At halfpast six, we moved to the garden for dinner, which was preparedby the female members present80.At eight pm, the ritualistic elements of the annual meetingbegan anew. As we moved to the outside temple, Thomas lit fourincense cones at the fireplace and the scent of musk filled the templearea. The women who were to perform the female circle ritual later,were initially absent in preparation for their ritual, and we waitedfor them for a while. ‘Immanuel’, ‘Barnabas’, ‘Jachin’ and ‘Kenan’stood in front of the altar facing us. ‘Immanuel’ and ‘Jachin’ eachheld a canvas with magic symbols. A jar of incense, a dagger somefolded canvas and two file folders were placed on the bench closestto the altar. The preparatory mantra of the women could be heardin the background. A cat, belonging to a couple of the attendantsand which had been at the temple region for most of the time, lay inthe grass beside us.79 Pathworking is practice in which the magician in meditation visualizesspecific symbols and concepts and lets these give rise to further visions.Traditionally pathworking is understood as a qabalistic exercise in which theqabalist visualizes his ascent on a path on the sephirotic tree.80 This clearly contradicts the stated absence of gender roles described bytwo of my female informants (see chapter 7.1.6)."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"202CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEAgain, as the official programme had not started yet, theatmosphere was quite relaxed and people were joking over theapparent dark clothing of most of those present.

As we sat and waited, some of us started to become a bitimpatient and Thomas went to check up on the female members.Upon Thomas’ return, at twenty past eight, we decided to startwithout the women with a lecture Thomas had held earlier inGermany. As the women not present at that moment had heard thelecture before, they would not miss anything important. Thismarked a departure from the predetermined programme schedule.The theme of the lecture was dark magic, qliphoth and qabalah,which are the themes of the book recently written by Thomas(Karlsson 2004). After a little while, the women arrived one afterone, and it was decided that their ritual would be the last part ofthe programme, as it would have to be performed in the indoortemple anyway.Next Thomas performed the Opening of the Seven Portalsritual, which is described in his book Kabbala, kliffot och den goetiskamagin (Karlsson 2004: 115-116). With the aid of a compass, Thomasdrew out the four cardinal points around the fireplace with themagic wand. Before starting, he waved the wand twice counter-clockwise around the fireplace. Next follows a description of thisritual, based on the description in the abovementioned book(Karlsson 2004: 115-116).Thomas turned to the east and pointed the magic wand in the samedirection.- I open the portal of dawn in the east and conjure the element of air inthe name of Amaymon!He turned to the south and pointed the magic wand in the same direction.- I open the portal of noon in the south and conjure the element of fire inthe name of Göap!He turned to the west and pointed the magic wand in the same direction.- I open the portal of evening in the west and conjure the element of waterin the name of Corson!He turned to the north and pointed the magic wand in the same direction.- I open the portal of night in the north and conjure the element of earthin the name of Zimimay!"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"203CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEThomas now lowered his head and pointed the wand to the ground.- I open the portal to the underworld in the sign of the letter Mem andconjure the element of primordial water and its salt and black colour inthe name of Lilith!He turned his head to the sky and pointed the wand upwards.- I open the portal to the skies in the sign of the letter Shin and conjure theelement of primordial fire and its sulphur and red colour in the name ofLucifer and Samael!Thomas held the wand at the level of his upper midsection.- I open the portal to the astral world in the sign of the letter Aleph andconjure the element of primordial air and its quicksilver and white colourin the name of Chiva and Sariel!Thomas, and all of us along with him, closed our eyes and tried to feelthe arrival of the powers conjured. After opening his eyes Thomas pickedup the goblet which was filled with beer and held it up to each of thedirections whilst greeting the forces.- I greet you Amaymon and offer you a drink!- I greet you Göap and offer you a drink!- I greet you Corson and offer you a drink!- I greet you Zimimay and offer you a drink!- I greet you Lilith and offer you a drink!- I greet you Lucifer and Samael and offer you a drink!- I greet you Chiva and Sariel and offer you a drink!We all joined him in saluting the forces.Directly after performing the ritual, when the portals were opened,‘Kenan’ took over and performed a ritual designed by lodge Sothis.’Kenan’ stood in front of the altar and on each side of him stoodanother Dragon Rouge member, once again holding the canvaseswith magic symbols. Again, the rest of us responded when thepower words were spoken, and again, the ritual was ended withthe ritualistic uttering “Ho Drakon Ho Megas!”81.At about nine o’clock pm ‘Barnabas’ held a lecture onVayrayana Buddhism and spoke in particular of the Tantric aspectsof the religion. When he had finished, at a quarter past nine, Thomasrequested for some more incense to be lit and as I happened to havea lighter I performed the task. We took a short break as it was startingto get quite cold and some people wanted to put on more clothes.The next item on the programme started with Thomas lecturingbriefly on Thule, as the mythical Gotland, and then he proceeded81 In the first correspondence course in magic the uttering is said to beAncient Greek for the Great Dragon and is used when conjuring the Draconianforce (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 5)."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"204CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEto guide us through a meditation. He consulted the compass andwe all turned to face the north, which is the cardinal point of darkmagic and demons. We performed an invocation of Odin and Hel,after which we stood in silent meditation. The ritual, and the outsidepart of the annual meeting, was concluded with a sacrifice to theGothic Gods and Goddesses. Thomas poured the rest of the beeronto the altar stones and we turned to face the alder tree in front ofthe altar. We stood in silence for a while, but at about ten o’clockwe prepared for the last part of the official programme of the annualmeeting, the female circle’s Lilith-ritual.The Female Circle’s ritual work was a most suitable ending forthe annual meeting. After a short pause, we all gathered in the insidetemple, on the second floor of the old barn house building. Theartificial lighting was turned off and the room was lit only by two redcandles standing on the altar table. The four women who were aboutto lead us through the ritual, three of whom were wearing ceremonialrobes, had gathered in front of the altar, two on each side in front of itand facing each other. The rest of us gathered in a semi-circularformation around them, so that no one stood behind the altar. Asceremonial tools the women had a goblet filled with red wine, thebell used earlier outside and one dagger each. Again the scent ofincense filled the air, this time from an incense stick sitting on one ofthe candlesticks on the altar table. The ritual started with ‘Eunice’ringing the bell. The women took turns in reading parts of the ritual,and they each read in a different language – Italian, English, Swedishand German. Certain passages were read out in unison, but even thenin four different languages. The rest of us again responded by readingthe power words at the appropriate moments. The wine was used tosymbolize the life-giving element of blood, and perhaps in this casethe magical qualities of menstrual blood. Before taking a sip of thewine the women stated “I drink of thee to take your power into me82”.The ritual, and indeed the official programme of the annual meetingof 2004, ended with a seated meditation. After we had finished, wewere quiet and still for a moment. Although the meeting was officiallyover we were by no means about to go to sleep. We gathered aroundthe benches at the outside temple, lit a fire in the fireplace and enjoyedeach other’s good company until the early hours of the morning.82 The words are based on my own approximate recollection."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"205CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICE5.1.2 Course on Ceremonial MagicOn the weekend of August 5th and 6th, 2001, I attended a course onceremonial magic. The course was held at the Dragon Rouge templein Stockholm, Sweden, and the practice was performed in a nearbyforest. At about five pm on Saturday, I made my way to the metrostation where Dragon Rouge members meet up before courses. Thisis standard practice, as there might be new members, or even non-members, among the attendants, who do not know the location ofthe temple, which is not publicly announced. I was met by a maleand a female member and we walked together to the temple. As westood outside the building housing the temple, an ordinaryresidential high-rise building, we were met up by two othermembers, again one female and one male. We went inside andmoved down to the basement where the temple was located. Thepremises consisted of one larger rectangular room about 25 m2 insize, a smaller room a few square metres in size and the altar-regionconnected to the main room. There was also a small bathroom withjust a toilet and a sink on the premises, to the direct right of theouter door of the temple. The main room was furnished with twolarge wooden tables with four wooden chairs around each of themin the centre of the room, a sofa on one far side with a small tablesupporting a globe83 to the left of it and a stereo music system to theright of it, a sideboard on the other far side – to the left from theouter door, as well as a small Feng Shui fountain in between thesmall wall space between the storage room and the Altar room.The tables had five-candle candlesticks and incense holders on them.The walls had borders of Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting differentaspects of Egyptian mythology. A particularly interesting passagewas one taken from the Egyptian Book of the Dead (see Budge 1960:72, 93, 150), introducing Khepera. The passage was translated tome as “I am the one who created myself”. The room was regularlylit up by four wall-mounted lamps.83 A miniature flagpole with the Clavicula Nox symbol (see picture 8) on ared flag is attached to the top of the globe, to humorously portray Dragon Rougeworld domination.

The bathroom had a few posters,including a comic strip humorously depicting a Christian priest(the strip was taken from a Swedish newspaper) and a poster of apainting by Salvador Dalí. On the bathroom mirror, there was anold sign in Swedish. The sign translated roughly as “Do not takeGod’s name in vain. Do not swear! To swear is proof of a lack ofculture and education.84\".The altar area was obviously the centre of attention in thetemple. The room holding the temple was adjoined to the main roomwithout any connecting door, and was beside the smaller room onthe premises. The altar consisted of a table covered with dark canvas.On the altar were to be found the statue of a dragon, four84 “Missbruka icke Guds namn. Svär icke!

There was also a pillar on each side ofthe altar. On the floor, to the walls of the altar space, there wereblack pillows used in different rituals and meditations as the floorwas quite hard and cold (see picture 10 for an overview of the altararea, and pictures 11 and 12 for close-ups of the altar).As we waited inside, the rest of the members who were to attendthe course came in, along with Thomas who had been waiting forthem at the metro station.

All exceptThomas and two other male members had note-books in which theymade notes during the lecture. Thomas stood in front of the tablenearest the altar area, with his back turned to the altar so that hefaced us.The lecture started by treating a few basic concepts andprinciples of dark magic, as discussed in section 3.1.1, and went onto deal with dark ritual and ceremonial magic in specific. Thebuilding of the temple, something which we were to do in theceremony ahead, was likened to the building of one’s soul. Thomasillustrated the difference between white and dark ceremonial magicwith an example of the temple of Jerusalem. Whereas the symbolicPicture 12.

This is not to beunderstood in a literal, destructive fashion. White ritual magicworks to protect and establish the perfect divine sphere or circle,whereas dark ritual magic works to destroy it and escape from it,in order to access the divine forces beyond the ordered universe.Symbolically, the dark magical tearing down of the temple is thuscarried out in order to build something new instead. All throughthe lecture, references were made to many different mythologiesand mythological figures, and correspondences between them wererigorously sought. Some way into the course Thomas picked up alecture-pad and placed it on a stand in front of us. He used the padto draw different symbols discussed and to further illustrate thepoints of his lecture. We went on to discuss the typical practicalitiesof ceremonial magic. As white magic strives for a union with thedivine, and in ceremonial form to re-establish the divine circle ofcreation, the altar usually stands at the centre of the ritual sphere,surrounded by the participants. In dark magic, on the other hand,where the goal is to break free from the boundaries of creation, thealtar is usually placed in front of the attendants, as a portal out.Thomas was frequently interrupted by comments and questionsfrom the other participants, and these interruptions often steeredthe lecture into different directions, giving rise to new commentsand discussions. Towards the end of the lecture a knock was heardat the door, and another female member entered. This was a long-time member who had been unable to attend the course from thevery start. She sat down on the sofa. At this point, Thomas hadmoved on to discuss the practicalities and symbolic significancesof the ceremony we were to perform the next day. He declared thateach of the four cardinal points was represented by an element,and these in turn were represented by four magic tools. Northrepresented the element of earth and had the pentacle as its symbol.East represented the element of air and had the sword as its symbol.South represented the element of fire and had the staff as its symbol.West represented the element of water and had the goblet as itssymbol. There was some discussion about the different"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"210CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEcorrespondences between cardinal points, magic tools and theelements, as different magic-systems link them differently. Wedecided to use the above correspondences. The lecture ended Atabout eight-thirty pm. Before going home, we discussed some rathergeneral topics not really connected to magic per se.For my part, the second day of the course started with aprescheduled interview with a female Dragon Rouge member. Imet her and a male friend of hers, also a member, at the temple andstarted the interview at about three-twenty pm. About an hour anda quarter later, other members, arriving for the second part of thecourse, began dropping in and we ended the interview. We startedpreparing for the course, the second part of which would focus onperforming a practical dark magic ceremony. At about a quarterpast five pm, we left the temple and headed for the nearby forest, afew metro stations away from the temple. Here we were to performthe ceremony. All of those present the day before, five male andfour female members, were present for the second day as well. Someof us had travelled to the forest by car, whereas I and a few othershad arrived by metro.Although August tends to be a rather warm late-summer monthin the Scandinavian countries, this particular Sunday was quite cold,and all of us were wearing extra warm clothes. Luckily the sky wasclear and we were not expecting any rain. The forest we went towas coniferous, although most Scandinavian forests are mixed. Thetrees were mostly pines, with a small number of spruce and juniper.We walked into the forest by a woodland path, careful not to destroyany of the forest plants. As we walked, I was told that we wereheading for a spot where a Dragon Rouge ceremony had beenperformed the previous spring.Before seeking out the final spot for our ceremony, we stoppedby a moss-covered stony mound. Here Thomas asked us to performa short meditation in preparation for the ceremony. We chose placesto sit by the mound and sat down to meditate in the presence of theforest and nature, also focusing on being in the forest. In contrast tomost of the other meditations I had performed in the Dragon Rougecontext thus far, this one was conducted privately, with no one tolead us through it. Exactly like the other members, I sat facing thesteep with my eyes closed. After finishing and taking a few deep"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"211CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEbreaths we stood up and walked along for a while, until Thomasasked us to stop again. He gave a short theoretical talk, mostlyfocusing on the presence of the Dragon, or chaos, in nature. Amongthe magicians and academics mentioned in the short lecture wasMircea Eliade, whose writings have earned much respect amongthe members of the order, as is the case within many neopagan and‘New Age’ groups.When he had finished, Thomas asked us to search the forestand pick up some object which for some reason appealed85 to us.He asked us not to choose the dead bird found earlier, as it was tobe used as a collective item. Most of us picked up dead sticks, whiletwo of the female members chose pine cones and one female memberchose a fallen, but living, pine tree branch. Thomas came back witha living pine tree branch with a cone still attached to it. We made85 The Swedish word ’Tilltala’, which could be used both in the meaning“to please” (as in: this object pleases me) and in the meaning “speak to” (as in:“this object speaks to me”). In the above sentence ‘appeals to’ should beunderstood in both of these senses.Picture 13.

There were novisible markers to distinguish this part of the forest from the rest ofit. It was up to the magician and his feeling for, and vision of, thewoods to make up and draw out the natural magical area. In a line-formation we proceeded to enter the area, moving in through apassage formed by two pine trees standing next to each other. Thesetwo trees formed the portal into our natural temple (see picture14). Before entering, each of us ritually opened the portal to let usin, by using the objects we had picked up in the forest. Thomasshowed us the rock used as an altar during the previous ceremony.It stood in line with the ‘portal’ through which we had entered thearea, about 12 metres away from it. Before beginning, we preparedthe altar. We had brought with us four small tealights, two largercandles of the grave candle type, the ceremonial dagger and bellfrom the temple, and a jar of incense.

Threespecial twigs were placed in an erect position at the centre of thealtar, two of them forming a triangular shape with the third onefacing the sky between them. The carcass of the small bird foundearlier was placed on top of the altar stone. Behind the altar, slightlyto the right of it, stood a tree functioning – according to Thomas –as an Axis Mundi.We sat down on the ground and discussed the symbolism ofthe ceremony we were about to perform, as well as the role each ofus would have to play in it. The female members were to representtime, taking the roles of the three Norns, Urd, Verdandi and Skuld –or the past, the present and the future, and Hel – as that which ishidden.

Weidentified with beings from Norse mythology corresponding to theelement in question. I was to portray Surt – the Fire Demon, as therepresentative of South and Fire. Thomas, who represented ‘Thatwhich is below’, portrayed Hraesvelgr – the eagle. There was somediscussion about the mythical beings connected to the elementsbefore we chose which particular being we should portray. Aftermaking our joint decisions, we prepared our ceremonial utterings,the ritual lines we were supposed to read when it was time for ourcontribution to the ceremony. Lastly, we took some time to get intothe character of the mythical being we were supposed to portray,then meditating briefly on this.With the help of a compass, we sought out the cardinal pointsin order to know at which positions we should stand. The womanrepresenting the past stood by the trees functioning as the portal tothe temple, the woman representing the present stood on the right-hand side of the altar and the woman representing the future stoodbehind the altar, next to a tree marking the outer boundary of thetemple region. The woman portraying Hel stood on the left-handside of the altar. Those of us who represented the four elementsstood at our respective cardinal points, with our backs towards treesmarking the boundaries of the temple. The male membersrepresenting the above and the below stood at the centre of thearea, next to a circular formation of small stones. Before we started,Thomas and the rest of us discussed and planned the specifics ofthe ceremony. The following proceeding was decided upon: Hel –the Hidden, would start and end the ceremony; the Norns – thePast, the Present and the Future would be next in line, the fourcardinal points, starting with north and finishing with west, wouldperform their part, lastly followed by the directions of below andabove.

The sacred items picked up from the forest were left at thealtar. We left the forest and returned to the city. The ceremony took"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"217CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEabout thirteen minutes in its entirety, not counting the meditationsand preparations we carried out before it. In total, we spent aboutone and a half hour in the forest.The ritualistic part of the course on ceremonial magic started withan initial meditation. The participants sat by a mound and werespecifically asked to meditate on the presence of the forest and thenature around them. The purpose was for them to separatethemselves from their everyday reality, and focus their minds andbodies on the magic work at hand. The collecting of natural objectswas supposed to strengthen the identification with nature, the‘totems’ collected in a fashion imbuing the magicians with theirforce.The short break taken before entering the ‘temple’ wasimportant. The supposed function of the break was to separate thesacred space, and to mark a difference between the magical and thenon-magical. The ‘opening of the portal’ while passing through thepassage formed by the two trees also helped in marking thisdifference. By using the items collected from nature the sense ofconnectedness to nature was also strengthened.Next on the schedule was preparing the altar that was going tobe used during the ceremony. The objects brought along werecandles, incense and incense-holder, a ceremonial bell and a magicdagger brought from the Dragon Rouge temple in Stockholm. Itemscollected in the forest and placed on the altar were a collection oftwigs and the dead bird found on our way to the temple-area. InMagick Aleister Crowley describes magic tools important inceremonies (see Crowley 1977: 46). Among the most important arethe magic wand – representing the magician’s Will, the cup (orgoblet) – representing understanding, the sword – representingreason and the pentacle – representing the lower parts of themagician’s being. The magic attire, consisting of crown and robe,as well as a book of conjurations and a bell, are also described asimportant. In the context of this particular ceremony, and in theDragon Rouge context in general, the magic tools are interpreted abit differently. The wand and the pentacle represent Will and theearth, the body, in a similar fashion to Crowley’s description, butthe goblet is usually taken to represent water and feminine aspects,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"218CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEand the sword the element of air. Of the four key magic tools onlythe sword, in the form of a dagger, had been brought along. In thiscontext, however, the items collected in the forest represented thewand and Will, and the altar, and the whole temple, could be seenas representing the earth. Magic attire is generally not used inDragon Rouge. The book of conjurations is similarly not asimportant as in traditional magic, as the order’s ritual work has ahighly improvised character.The preparation of the ceremony mirrored this improvisationalcharacteristic. The participants discussed and in union agreed onwhat in particular they should represent and portray, but thespecifics of the ritual text delivered by each participant was notdictated. The beings portrayed in the ceremony were all from ancientNorse mythology, and this element was thus interiorly consistent.The secondary representations were similarly consistent. Themythological beings were understood as representations of somesorts of ‘extended cardinal points’, an existential continuum,namely: Time (past, present and future), space (north, west, south,east, above and below). The most important official in the ceremonyrepresented the hidden aspect, the realm of death, rebirth and chaos,and thus as the element which all the other elements can be foundin. An interesting factor was that the participants were divided onthe basis of gender. The females represented time and the malesrepresented space, and the hidden aspect, Hel, was represented bya female. That ‘Hel‘ was placed on the left side of the altar is also ofimportance, as the left is interpreted as the hidden side, representingchaos. When deciding which mythical characters should beportrayed the likes of Balder were ruled out, as they were taken torepresent ‘lighter’ principles, that is to say principles of order ratherthan chaos.After agreeing on the key elements of the ceremony theparticipants meditated again, and again the purpose was to focusbody and mind on the ceremony and to mark a separation of normaland magic reality. Specifically focusing on the elements andmythical beings each participant was supposed to portray, allowedfor them to embody the characteristics of each particular being.The temple, as part of unbounded nature, was marked off fromthe rest of the forest by the positioning of the ceremonial officials,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"219CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEthe ‘portal’ the temple had been entered through and the treerepresenting an axis mundi. The lighting of the incense at the altarmarked the start of the ceremony.The first half of the actual ceremony functioned as a definingof the limits of the ceremonial universe, or as expressed in thetheoretical portion preceding the practice: “the creation of a darkmagical universe”. Each of the officials represented one aspect of acontinuum, and the ritual presentation of these aspects constructedthis continuum. Hel, representing ‘the hidden’, started and endedthe presentations, thus signalling the source of everything in therealm of chaos. The ringing of the bell is interesting whenconsidering Aleister Crowley’s understanding of the use of themagic bell. Crowley writes: “At the sound of this Bell the Universeceases for an indivisible moment of time, and attends to the Will ofthe Magician” (Crowley 1977: 111). The ringing of the bell can thusbe understood as the act through which the magician’s ritualuttering is rendered real, in the case of this particular ceremony theact through which the aspects of space and time came into existence.That it was the official representing Hel, chaos – the source ofeverything in the Dragon Rouge view, is also important in thiscontext.The second part of the ceremony, in which each participant indue order approached the altar and offered their magic item to it,can be seen as a symbolic act endowing the newly created magicuniverse, and the inhabitants of it – the ceremonial officials, withpower. The ritual act consisted of, in a way, sacrificing the magicitem, representing the will, to the forces of chaos, which in this casewas also the magician offering the item. Thus the magician sacrificedhis/her person, his/her Will, to him-/herself, in order to attainpower. This sort of sacrifice is much discussed in the order, andacts of mythological beings such as Khepera and Odin stand as amodel for the magician.The meditation, performed while standing after all of theceremonial officials had finished their parts, functioned as a focusingand processing of the ritual elements, and as a return to normalreality and a normal state of mind. The declaration of the ceremonyas ended strengthened this sentiment. The final aspect was thecleaning of the temple, in practice meaning the gathering of the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"220CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEitems brought along. The ‘closing of the portal’, performed whenleaving the temple-area, functioned psychologically as a finalmarker differentiating between magical and non-magical reality.The differences to traditional magic ceremonies are quitenoticeable. In Aleister Crowley’s account of magic ceremony theparticular shape of the temple, as well as the shape and size of thealtar, is of key importance. Similarly, Crowley describes the use ofa magic circle as very important. The magician should stand insidethe circle and never leave, or otherwise the ‘hostile [magic] forces’outside the circle could harm the magician. (Crowley 1977: 46-50).In Dragon Rouge magic circles are never used. The argumentationbehind this is that the dark magician works with these ‘hostile forces’(not understood as hostile, but rather as misinterpreted) with adifferent approach, and a protecting circle is therefore unnecessary– in fact it might even be a hindrance.5.1.3 Ceremonial Opening of Lodge SinistraDuring my early field studies, I was invited to experience somethingquite rare and unique, the ceremonial opening of an official DragonRouge lodge. The date was Saturday 17th, February, 2001, and theplace was Malmö, Sweden. I had arrived in Stockholm two daysearlier in order to participate in some other Dragon Rouge activities,and took the train from Stockholm to Malmö on Friday morning. Ihad corresponded with representatives for the soon-to-be lodgeSinistra earlier, and was met by three Malmö-based members atthe railway station. Dragon Rouge members from Stockholm soonjoined us, as well as a few more members from the Malmö region.The evening was spent in a Chinese restaurant discussing varioussubjects, some of which concerned Dragon Rouge and magic, someof which did not.Before heading for the location where the ritual was to be held,we met up with a few other Dragon Rouge members not fromMalmö, this time a man and a woman from Gothenburg and a manfrom a small city in the south of Sweden. At about four pm, wetravelled to the location of the opening ceremony. It was to be held"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"221CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEin the home of one of the Malmö-based members. He had arrangeda room in his apartment for the occasion. At twenty to six, the lastperson attending had arrived. In total, there were 17 persons present,of whom six were women. Before starting the opening ceremony, afew of the Malmö-based members were initiated into the first degreeof the order. The leaders of the lodges, the core-persons of the order– the long-time Stockholm-based members – and those about to beinitiated moved to the main ritual room, while Thomas asked therest of us to move to another room. Chanting, ringing of theceremonial bell, and what I made out to be the ‘invocation of Lilith’ritual, were heard from the ritual room. As usual the initiationsconcluded with the ritual uttering “Ho Drakon Ho Megas!”. I willpresent a Lilith invocation as described in Kabbala, kliffot och dengoetiska magin (Karlsson 2004: 118) as an example.Thomas: Lepaca Lilith!Everyone: Lepaca Lilith!Thomas: Ruach!Everyone: Ruach!Thomas: Badad!Everyone: Badad!Thomas: Arioth!Everyone: Arioth!Thomas: Samolo!Everyone: Samolo!Thomas: Sched!Everyone: Sched!Thomas: Lilith, open your womb, open the shell of darkness and appearfrom the cave of dark dreams!

Before starting the opening ceremony,Thomas showed the soon-to-be lodge officials and me the lodge-contract, a document stating the rights and duties of a Dragon Rougelodge (see section 4.2.4)."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"223CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEWhen we were ready to start, all of us moved into the ritualroom. The room was a standard living-room in a residentialapartment, about 3x5 meters in size, but the appearance of the roomwas quite different from what one is used to. The walls were paintedin a dark red colour, emphasizing the dark wood panels of the room.The only lighter colours in the room were the ceiling and the radiatorby the window which were white. The window, on one short sideof the room, was covered with black canvas. An altar, consisting ofa table covered with black cloth was placed in front of the window,at the very centre, and on each side of it an ordinary kitchen chairhad been placed. There was no electric lighting in the room, but ametal chandelier housing four candles hung from the ceiling andan iron candelabra about 1.2 meters high stood on the left side ofthe altar. While the six red candles in the candelabra were lit, thecandles in the chandelier were not. Placed on the altar were awooden Western-type dragon statue – positioned in the centre, sixlit red candles – three on each far side of the altar-table – and threeadditional unlit ones in various colours, a ceremonial metal bell, ametal cup for incense and a ceremonial dagger with its sheath. Thealtar was decorated with red roses and rose-petals, and housed awooden stick functioning as the magic wand (see picture 16). Onthe left wall of the room (taking the side with the altar as the frontside of the room) hung two leather whips and a bouquet of driedroses.Picture 16. Altar at the ceremonial opening of lodge Sinistra."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"224CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEAs we entered the room the atmosphere was expectant. Theesoteric atmosphere of the room was further intensified by the scentof Dragon’s Blood incense and the scant candlelight casting its shineon the altar. Thomas stood in front of the altar, wielding the magicwand, and on each side of him, on the chairs beside the altar, sat afemale Dragon Rouge member from the Stockholm mother-organization. The rest of us stood in a semi-circle around Thomasand the altar, with the three lodge leaders present, and me, closestto them. We started off by Thomas leading us through a Dragonceremony (see section 5.1.1), directly followed by a standingKundalini-activating meditation – directly connected to the earlierceremony. After three deep breaths, Thomas continued byceremonially proclaiming the reason for those present havinggathered on that day, the ceremonial opening of lodge Sinistra.He spoke of the mythical being Lucifer, and this being’s role indark magical settings. Lucifer is seen as the light-bringer, the onewho can show the magician the path out of creation, and lead him/her to become a creator in his/her own right. He held a copy of LeGrand Grimoire86 in his hands, which he soon passed around theroom. He had opened the book on a page displaying a Lucifer-seal,and we were to focus on the seal and say the name Lucifer. As thebook made its way back to Thomas, the two women sitting on thechairs beside the altar drew the shape of the seal in the air, usingthe magic wand. We read an invocation of Lucifer from the grimoire,in the customary fashion. Thomas read it out loud first, and the restof us repeated it, the language being French. Thomas drew aninverted pentagram in the air with the wand. The time for the officialpart of the ceremony had arrived. The lodge leader of lodge Sinistrastepped up to the altar and signed two copies of the lodge-contract.In conclusion, Thomas drew yet another symbol from the grimoirein the air, using the magic wand.The whole ceremony was very intensive. The darkness of theroom combined with the scent of incense, and the fact that a wholeroom was occupied by a group of people all focusing on oneceremonial ritual, made the experience very powerful. After the86 Le Grand Grimoire, also called Le Dragon Rouge, is a handbook in magicoriginating from France in the 1850s."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"225CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEceremony, we blew out the candles and left the room. The topic ofdiscussion was the atmosphere and intensity of the ceremony andmany of those present were almost in a state of ecstasy. The commonopinion was that it all amounted to a feeling of strong presence inthe room, almost as if some sort of being or force had been presentduring the rituals.After relaxing a little and gathering our strength, we headedout to the city centre in order to start the more mundane celebrationsin a restaurant where we had booked a table.The Lilith invocation is one of the more basic Dragon Rouge rituals.As the first qliphotic level, the opening to the qliphotic spheres,Lilith represents the dark side of the normal world. Lilith’s sephiroticcounterpart is Malkuth, which in qabalah represents the materialworld. The first uttering of the invocation, Lepaca Lilith - meaning“open up Lilith”, is a summoning of the qliphotic force. Theterminology used in the invocation is quite powerful, such asreferences to ‘the cruelty of Lilith’ and a request to ‘let Lilith’s bloodstir like lava’. This is to be understood as a reflection on DragonRouge interpretation of the character and nature of the qliphoth.Lilith is attributed power, in the phrase “you hold the sceptre andyou hold the dominance”, and the magician doing the invocationseeks to attain this power. The power-words uttered are the namesof various demons, demonesses and ‘chaos-dragons’ (mythologicaldragon-like beings, which in Dragon Rouge are seen as representingchaos). The uttering Ho Drakon Ho Megas, the common ending ofDragon Rouge rituals and invocations, summons the power ofchaos.Concerning the room in which the ceremonial opening of lodgeSinistra was performed, it must be said that it was not solely devotedto magic – except for on this particular occasion. Consequently, thedark red colour of the walls represented the aesthetic preferencesof the inhabitant of the apartment first and foremost.As said, the room had been specifically prepared for theopening ceremony. The room had been cleared of everything notessential for the ceremony. The sole window of the room had beencovered by black fabric, and the altar had been arranged in front ofit. The covering of the window can be seen as an isolation of the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"226CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEtemple from the outside world, effectively rendering it a sacredspace – effecting the magician’s attainment of an altered state ofconsciousness. The items on the walls of the room, the dried rosesand the whips, as well as the chandelier and the candelabra,probably illustrated the aesthetics of the apartment’s inhabitant,although they suited the atmosphere sought. For example, the driedroses could be seen as a symbolic representation of negative anddestructive forces.The items on the altar, on the other hand, were of particularimportance, and represent the typical content of a Dragon Rougealtar. The dragon statue (see picture 17) is a central piece on anyDragon Rouge altar. It represents the chaos-forces, the life-force inthe form of the kundalini-serpent, and in extension the innate occultpowers the magician can learn to control through the use of magic.The magic wand, an essential part of almost all magic as arepresentation of Will (see Crowley 1977: 46), is of particular designin the Dragon Rouge context. The wand is always a tree branchwhich has not been crafted in any way. It represents the magician’sWill as a natural thing, as chaos in contrast to crafted items, whichrepresent order. Candles are generally used in inside ritual-contexts,as electric lights are always turned of. On this occasion the numberor colour of the candles were of no particular importance. The rosesand rose-petals covering the altar had no particular importance,other than as celebratory for the opening of the new lodge. Themetal bell is often used in Dragon Rouge rituals (see sections 5.1.1and 5.1.2. See section 5.1.2 for the symbolic purpose of using thebell). The Dragon’s Blood incense is used on rarer occasions, as it israther expensive. The incense is made of the dried fruit of a palmtree, Daemonorops Draco, and gives of heavy smoke and has a strongand distinct scent. The name, of course, indicates a significance in amagic order called Dragon Rouge.The female members seated on both sides of the altar, activemembers of the mother-order, represented the feminine qliphoticforces. That the members seated on the chairs were female was ofparticular importance, and this is interesting when considering thegenerally non-essential view on gender in the order.The opening started with a Dragon Ceremony, which involvesthe magician conjuring the power of his own life-force, as the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"227CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEkundalini, as well as the magical powers in existence. The kundaliniis represented as a serpent coiled in the base-chakra, and the firstpassage of the ritual quite obviously specifies the rising of the force.The kundalini is also called ‘the fire serpent’, as the rising of theforce is said to produce a warm or burning sensation along the spine.In the second passage the words “flaming jaws” are uttered, againin combination with requesting the dragon to ‘rise from the depths’.The Dragon Ceremony was combined with a kundalini-meditation,in which the previously performed ritual was performed in orderto strengthen the effects of the meditation. The meditation alsofunctioned to focus the body and mind on the magic process athand.Before treating the next ritual element, the Lucifer-invocation,the character of Lucifer must be discussed shortly. Lucifer isconjured as the light-bringer, a force which guides and helps themagician see his/her way in darkness. Thus, invoking Lucifer isnot seen as sinister or destructive in any way (see Kaczynski 2002:505 n37). The invocation was said to be performed in order to“provide the Luciferian light” for the work of the new lodge. ThisPicture 17. The dragon-statue on the altar at lodge Sinistra."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"228CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEcan be compared to the Neophyte initiation of the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn, in which the initiate was to declare “My soulis wandering in darkness, seeking for the Light of OccultKnowledge, and I believe that in this Order the knowledge of thatLight may be obtained” (see Bogdan 2003b: 185). The painting ofthe Lucifer-seal in the air was an act of visualization, further focusingthe mind on the process of magic. The participants were not usinga wand, but using the finger represented the directing of Will. Thegrimoire the seal was taken from, Le Dragon Rouge, is of particularsignificance, as this is one of the stated origins of the name of theorder. The grimoire is used on rare occasions.The signing of the lodge contract, when done in a ritual context,can be seen as a magic oath. Magic oaths are not to be seen as generaloaths, as they are supposed to reflect the Will of the magician. InCrowley’s words, magic oaths cannot be broken (see Crowley 1977:62). The signing of the contract also signalled the end of theceremony, which was cemented by Thomas – as ceremonial leader– drawing yet another seal from the grimoire.5.1.4 Initiation into Degree 2.0 - GamalielI did my initiation for the second degree, 2.0 Gamaliel, on Tuesday,30th November, 2004. About a week and a half prior to the initiationI had sent a text of about two A4 pages dealing with my experiencesand reflections of the second course to my contact person in theorder. The text also dealt with my view on the Draconian magicsystem. It is a standard and generally required procedure in DragonRouge to send texts of this kind to the order, along with the requestfor initiation, before the actual initiation is to be performed. Theorder then considers the reflections and decides if the person inquestion is suitable for initiation or not. I have been told thatinitiation is not often denied a person. It is only if the personrequesting initiation appears to be seriously unbalanced or mentallyunfit that it is suggested to the individual that initiation wouldperhaps not be suitable."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"229CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEThe initiation ceremony was preceded by a regular Tuesdaymeeting, the last one for the month of November, and thus the lastone before going on to another theme. I arrived at the metro stationwhere members meet before courses and gatherings at five minutesto seven pm. A few members where present and more arrived asthe time approached seven. At about seven minutes past seven, westarted to move towards the Dragon Rouge temple, as it was notlikely that any more members would arrive. I will here skip theproceedings of the Tuesday meeting, which focused on shadow-meditation, and go straight to the initiation.At about twenty past eight, most of those attending the meetingwere about to leave. Thomas had told us before the meeting thatwe were going to do a second degree initiation, and that thosemembers who already have taken the second degree could stay forthe initiation. Thomas, ‘Drusilla’, ‘Malachi’ and ‘Lael’ stayed forthe initiation, whereas the other members were either in a hurrysomewhere or not initiated into the second degree. I asked Thomasif he might have a piece of paper so that I could write my ceremonialtext into a finished form, and ‘Lael’ gave me a sheet from hisnotebook. I sat down at the table to write my text and the rest ofthose present stood by the sofa and discussed unrelated things. Atabout a quarter to nine I was finished and handed the notebookand pen back to ‘Lael’ and the text to Thomas. Thomas asked me ifthis was the version for the archive and I answered yes, but that Iwould first be using it during the ceremony. As we prepared forthe ceremony, I asked Thomas if I was to be reading the DragonCeremony, which I do not know by heart. He told me not to worryas there was a book with the text by the altar. Thomas turned to theothers and asked their opinion about what kind of music we shouldbe using. ‘Lael’ made a suggestion and accepted this. The musichad some (shamanic) drumming in it, which at first affected myconcentration a little, as I was quite nervous. Later on, as I becamemore involved in the ceremony, the music did not bother me at all.Thomas went to the sideboard and took out the grimoire LeDragon Rouge, also called Le Grand Grimoire (see footnote 85). TheLucifer invocation from the grimoire was to be used in the ceremony.Next, Thomas asked us to move to the altar region and the ceremonywas about to begin. The lights in the temple were switched off and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"230CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEthe only illumination came from the candles in the altar region.One red candle in a dragon-shaped candleholder, placed on a largemirror on the floor, and four red ones on the altar. Thomas took outthe two swords standing by the altar and placed them in the cornersby the altar.Thomas informed us that we were going to start with a shortmeditation and we all sat down around the mirror, clock-wise me,‘Lael’, Thomas, ‘Malachi’ and ‘Drusilla’ – Thomas with his backtowards the altar and me facing him. We focused on the candle infront of us and conducted a short meditation. After the meditation,Thomas briefly discussed the second initiation. It is particularlyimportant as it is the last initiation before the Dragon Oath (seesection 4.2.1) and thus before entering the Inner Order – OrdoDraconis et Atri Adamantis. It is also an initiation which one cannotperform by oneself, as is possible with the first one. Afterwards,Thomas asked us to stand up and ‘Lael’ and ‘Malachi’, who weregoing to act the guardians during the ceremony, to take their places.They both moved to a corner of the altar region, ‘Lael’ to the left ofthe altar and ‘Malachi’ to the right of it, each of them facing me andaway from the altar region. Thomas stood in front of the altar and Istood behind him, with ‘Drusilla’ on my right side, slightly behindme.Thomas picked up the magic wand in his right hand and thebook with the Dragon ceremony in his left. The grimoire was placedon the right side of the altar. Thomas started by reading the Dragonceremony (see section 5.1.1) from the book, whilst pointing the wandtowards the altar. As usual, we responded by repeating the powerwords and the reading was ended by the ceremonial uttering, HoDrakon Ho Megas. Next, Thomas picked up the grimoire Le DragonRouge and opened it up at the page with the Lucifer invocation.The same invocation was used in the ceremonial opening of lodgeSinistra in Malmö, Sweden (see section 5.1.3). Thomas brieflyexplained that we were going to read the Lucifer invocation in orderto bring the Luciferian light into the ceremony. Thomas read theinvocation out loud, first with doing it individually and then withus repeating each word. When he had finished he put down thegrimoire and turned to me. He invited me to step up to the altar inorder to be initiated. I responded by doing so, and he gave me the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"231CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEbook with the ceremony to read from. I read the ceremony out aloud,using my magical name, and the others present repeated the powerwords. After that, I read the ceremonial text which I had preparedmyself before the initiation.I put the book down on the right side of the altar and lifted upthe paper with my ceremonial text, which I had held in my handsfor the duration of the ceremony. I read the text aloud and the othersresponded to certain phrases.The ceremonial text:I, Daemon Gaeh’Nae’Ha, invoke Lilith, Hel, Hekate and Kali.

He welcomed me into the second degree of the order. Ishook hands with those present, and Thomas declared the initiationended and said that we could leave the altar region. I left first,turning towards the altar when at the exit and bowing to it. Therest left after me. We turned on the electrical lights in the templeand Thomas blew out the candles. We had a brief discussion, afterwhich I handed my ceremonial text over to Thomas for archiving88.We put on our outdoor clothes and left the temple.In comparison to the initiation into the first degree, the secondinitiation was more complex and elaborate. The texts required forthe first initiation, both the reflective account and the ceremonialtext, were shorter and much less personal than those required forthe second initiation. Otherwise the ceremonial settings were quitesimilar.The initiations of a magic order are, naturally, of central rituals inan initiatory order’s practice. In Dragon Rouge the road to initiationgoes through performing exercises described in correspondencecourses, and then providing the order with a report of one’sprogress. The documents an initiate needs to provide in order to besupposed to provide an individual ceremonial text, which the initiationceremony revolves around. Each successive initiation will require a more andmore extensive, elaborated and personal text. The text for the second initiationwas supposed to include ceremonial oaths in which I declare my future magicalintents, as well as my role with regard to Dragon Rouge. The oaths are, as said,ceremonial, and are not to be viewed as mundane promises. Their purpose is tofocus the initiate’s attention and consciousness on the magical progress at hand.The text is, as said, something which the initiate is supposed to construct byhim-/herself and will therefore mirror the special interests and dispositions ofthe initiate. In my text, I chose to deploy mythological creatures from variousdifferent mythologies. I also consciously included a lot of sexual references,since I felt that this would be suitable in my initiation. Likewise, I chose toinvoke feminine deities and demonesses. The sexual references were combinedwith self-annihilating passages indicating submission to the forces called upon.The text has a religious tone comparable to Tantric texts, especially thosecommonly defined as Left Hand Path.88 The reflective accounts of the initiation courses and the ceremonial textsare archived by Dragon Rouge. They become a sort of documentation of theinitiate’s magical progress."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"233CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEapproved for initiation can be likened to the system of universityexams. The student of magic does the exercises required of him,and then writes a paper on his/her reflections on the material, his/her experiences during the course as well as on the general topic ofhis/her interpretation of draconian magic. The order then decideswhether or not to approve the candidate for initiation. Thedocuments the candidate provides can be seen as a form of ’proof’that the individual has undergone the necessary training and thathe/she is proficiently advanced in his/her practice of magic.Interesting as this is, I will focus on the actual ritual of initiation.The Dragon Rouge rituals of initiation are from the very outsetdifferent in character in comparison to traditional rituals ofinitiation, as they are found in, for example, Freemasonry and theHermetic Order of Golden Dawn (see Bogdan 2003b for examplesof these). Traditional initiatory orders usually have fixed rituals, tobe performed in the same fashion each and every time. This is theopposite to Dragon Rouge initiations. First and foremost, the initiateis supposed to write the text for his ritual of initiation for him/herself – and thus the ritual text will be different on every occasion.The purpose is to foster the initiate and his/her imagination, andtrain him/her in the construction of rituals. This could also be seenas a difference stemming from the primary forces conjured. Thefocus of Dragon Rouge rituals, especially in an initiatory sense, arechaos-forces, whereas Right Hand Path rituals focus on order andstructure. The rituals of Dragon Rouge seem to mirror this focus.The ritual text should include a magic oath, which is of greatimportance, as discussed in chapter 5.1.3. Displaying the ad hoccharacter of the ritual setup, the number and function of ritualofficials was not determined beforehand. The only rule was thatthose attending had to be of at least the degree the candidate was tobe initiated in.Before the ritual started the candles at the altar-area werelighted and the electric lights were turned off and meditative musicwas played. This was all in order to set the mood for the ritual, andhelp the initiate, and the ritual officers, focus on the ritual reality,and marking the border between magic and non-magic. In choosingroles for the officials the male members present acted the guardians– again a traditional gendered role. Thomas, as highest initiate, and"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"234CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEmy tutor in the order, acted ritual leader. Persons were situated sothat the person initiated was at the centre, and thus at the centre ofattention.The ritual was started with meditation, again focusing the mindand body on the act of magic. The magic wand was used in theincantations and invocations, directing the Will of the personreading the invocation. See section 5.1.3 for the purpose of theDragon Ceremony. The Lucifer-invocation was also used in a similarfashion as in the opening of lodge Sinistra (see section 5.1.3). Beforeperforming the reading of the ceremonial text written by myself, Ialso read the Dragon Ceremony. In this way I was supposed tobecome more deeply involved in the ritual, and attain a closerconnection to the forces conjured. My reading of the text preparedby myself ended the ritualistic part of the ceremony. The shakingof the ceremonial officials hands represented a formal welcomingof me into the second degree of the order, and also signalled a returnto normal reality. This was again cemented with Thomas declaringthe initiation ended. Leaving the altar-area I was again the centreof focus, as I left the altar-area first."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"235CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICE5.2 Discussion and AnalysisThe above examples from my fieldwork show the standard structureof Dragon Rouge courses and meetings. First, the person who willbe functioning as course-leader, usually one of the active long-timemembers, starts by giving a theoretical talk on the subject of thecourse. Various sources for the information given are used but,almost without exception, some kind of scientific works fromcomparative religion, anthropology or some related field of sciencewhich pertain to the phenomenon in question, are referred to. Worksby Mircea Eliade and Carl Gustav Jung, for example, are frequentlyused. Other common sources are works on magic, or thephenomenon in question, written by insiders. This literature is tooextensive to be treated in detail, but books by Julius Evola andKenneth Grant can be mentioned. Of course, the works referred toand used vary according to the theme of the course. As almost allof the leaders I have witnessed giving courses have somebackground in academia, some having taken a few courses whileothers have a university degree, it is no surprise that the academiclecture functions as the pattern for the theoretical portion of aDragon Rouge course.The course leader stands in front of the sitting audience whiledelivering his/her lecture and often utilises some form of visualaid, such as a lecture-pad to make illustrations on. The courseparticipants often take notes and ask the course leader questionswhen something is not clear to them. Comments are also common.Literary references are similar to those a university lecturer wouldmake, say for example in a course on ancient Egyptian religion.The point I am trying to make is not that the course leaders ofDragon Rouge use deceitful means in order to make their activitymore credible, or that the Dragon Rouge course is a false simulacrumof the genuine thing, a regular university lecture. What I am sayingis that for both the course leader and for most of those participatingin the course, the university lecture is an accessible and familiarpattern to model the learning situation on.

It is felt that bothparts are necessary. On the one hand: theory without practice wouldbe rather pointless, in fact a person not putting into practice whathe/she has learnt would not be considered a magician, but ratheran occult theorist. I have been told on many occasions that there isno such thing as a theoretical magician (see Dragon Rouge 1996/1:4). On the other hand: practice would become almost impossible ifone did not ground it on a theoretical basis. At the Stockholm temple,which is the location of most of the courses I have attended, thepractice is performed in the altar-room. After the short breakfollowing the theoretical portion of the course, the participants moveto this area. The course leader usually puts on a record with somekind of meditation music and lights the candles and some suitabletype of incense at the altar, while the electric lights are turned off.As the room is lit only by the dim glow of the candles, theparticipants sit down on the pillows in the altar-area, in a circularformation, with the course leader closest to the altar. During coursesthat involve the participants standing during the working of magic,the pillows are naturally not used. The practice is usually begunwith some kind of Kundalini-meditation, which the course leaderguides the other participants through. After the meditation, theactual practice commences and at the end of it another, shorter,meditation is held. Typically, members sit down in the chairs aroundthe tables in the main room, after getting their breath back andrelaxing briefly, to discuss the experience of the practice. It is duringthese analyses that the members can draw on each other’s experienceand construct a logical and coherent totality out of the practice.In his doctoral thesis, Henrik Bogdan provides a description ofthe Neophyte ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,the introductory initiation into the order (Bogdan 2003b: 180-192).The ritual is ordered in a strictly regulated fashion, with prescribed"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"237CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEceremonial officers located at fixed positions and the ritual text andproceedings to be performed in an ordained way. The Dragon Rougeritual is much less rigidly bound, to the extent of being constructedindividually for each and every new occasion, even involvingimprovised elements. Dragon Rouge ceremonies too, which in otherways are set in the tradition of early 20th century magical orders,follow the occasion-bound and improvised model (see section 5.1.2for an example). In comparison to Wiccan neopagan rituals andinitiations, the Dragon Rouge variants likewise appear much lessrigid (see Bogdan 2003b: 220-233; York 1995: 225-230 for examplesof Wiccan rituals and initiations). Many neopagan rituals are,however, much more flexible than the Gardnerian Wiccan rituals,as demonstrated by Graham Harvey (Harvey 2000).Galina Lindquist uses the notion of play when discussingneoshaman ritual activity (see Lindquist 1997: 124-125, 294-296),and this notion is suitable for the Dragon Rouge attitude towardsritual, as well. Lindquist uses play in the sense of “a basic existentialmodality generative of spirituality and creativity, where anagreement on the altered conventions of behaviour allows theplayers to generate alternative social spaces which can besubjectively experienced as a different reality” (Lindquist 1997: 124).In this approach, the ritual reality is collectively crafted in the contextof the ritual and, in the rules of the play and during the play,becomes the relevant reality. A stage play is a suitable comparison.In performing Shakespeare’s Hamlet the actors take on the qualitiesof the characters in the play. The stage becomes the court of theKing of Denmark, and, if the actors are good, the audience can forthe duration of the play experience the course of events as reality.At the very least, the emotional attachments and reactions shouldbe genuine.Related to the notion of play, and also relevant in the contextof Dragon Rouge ritual, is playfulness. As noted in the aboveethnographies, the mood of the participants in between specificritual elements is very light-hearted. While the actual ritual elementsare performed in a serious state of mind, the shift to a much morerelaxed atmosphere can be almost instantaneous when the ritualelements are interrupted or the ritual is ended. The participants aredetermined and take their activities seriously, but this does not"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"238CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEhinder them from joking about it when the time is appropriate. Thisis an immanent factor in late modern alternative spirituality, andthe ritual-as-play approach can shed light on how it functions. Theactors in the ritual adhere to the rules of the play, when the play isbeing acted. In a largely improvised ritual, which is common in theDragon Rouge setting, there are nonetheless conventions and rulesof conduct. Each actor knows the modes and approximations of theritual setting and can play them out. When the ritual is over, orpauses for some reason, the participants no longer follow the rulesof conduct. In fact, maintaining the serious atmosphere mightdetract from the ritual, as the period in between might then beexperienced as a part of the actual ritual setting. In a way, the jokesbefore and after a ritual delimit the actual ritual, and mark theborders between ritual and non-ritual.As the order is not limited to any one system of magic or to astrict focus on one specific religious tradition, the courses functionmainly as an introduction to the issues dealt with. It is then up tothe individual members to dive deeper into the form of practicethey have just been introduced to, if it is felt to be something worthexploring in greater depth. As I have not studied members of DragonRouge involved in individual magic practice, something whichwould be extremely difficult to do, I cannot say much more on thesubject of individual practice. The order’s correspondence coursesin magic do however shed some light on the issue. The first part ofthe first correspondence course teaches the basics of meditation –focusing on Kundalini-meditation – and guides the student throughfundamental practices in which the will and concentration aretrained.The second part focuses on rituals, teaching the student howto construct his/her own rituals rather than giving ready-maderecipes for them, although a basic purification ritual is described.The practice of dream control, and consequently astral travel andprojection, is also described and recommended. The astral plane isalso the theme of the next two parts of the course. Part five of thecourse treats Tantra, and hence goes in more depth into the practiceof Kundalini-meditation by focusing on the energy travellingthrough the different chakras, as well as offering the basics of sexmagic. The concluding part of the first course describes a quite"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"239CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICEelaborate ceremony as a form of conclusion to the first part of themagician’s journey. (Dragon Rouge 1996). Most of the exercisesprescribed are described in only the most basic fashion. The theoryand ideas behind the exercises are, however, treated at length. Inthis way, the adept will be able to mould the rituals and practicesin a way that suits him/her best and gives him/her the most efficientmeans with which to approach magic. Even the rituals described atlength function mainly as examples of how to possibly go aboutpractising magic.The second correspondence course gives even less detaileddescriptions, and here as well the emphasis lies on explaining theidea behind the exercises. The description of a witchcraft ritual anda few demonic invocations are the exceptions. A few exercisesprescribed in the second course are: Kundalini-meditations, astral-/dream-travels, various meditative exercises in nature, invocationsand visualisation exercises. (Dragon Rouge 2001j). The practiceslearnt earlier, however, are not something to forget and leave bythe wayside as one progresses. For example, much of the materialin the second course consists of more advanced continuations ofsubjects introduced in the first course.Common to both courses is that the exercises are designed foran individual practitioner, not for a group of magicians. This is alsothe case with the majority of the courses I have attended. What islearnt can be practiced without the aid of other magicians.Exceptions occur, of course, such as the course on ceremonial magicdescribed in section 5.1.2 above, and ceremonies performed in thisfashion, which requires the co-operation of a number of magicians.The point of focusing on the individual is not to foster an attitudeof isolation among adepts. On the contrary; an overtlyindividualistic approach to magic, in which the adept disregardsall and everything outside him/herself, is strongly discouraged inthe material (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 2; 2001j/1: 6). Since thecorrespondence courses are meant to work for anyone interested inthe practice of the Dragon Rouge type of dark magic, and as manywould-be practitioners are likely to be the only ones in theirrespective regions, forms of exercise which do not require theattendance of more than one practitioner are taught.

The elementarydescriptions of possible exercises, combined with the advice for theadept to construct his/her own forms of practice, also foster thenovice magician a pragmatic attitude towards the practice of magic.As stated earlier, the courses of the order mainly function asintroductions to specific forms of practice or to new ideas, with afew exceptions where a course dives deeper into themes exploredin prior courses. Courses arranged by the Dragon Rouge mother-organization in Stockholm from early summer, 2000, to fall, 2004,have, for example, treated the following subjects:- Ancient Norse magic and rune magic- Magic in the confines of nature- Tantric Kundalini/Chakra-exercises- Goetic magic 89- The exploration of magical forces, such as Vril and Od90- Ancient-Egyptian based magic- Qliphotic exercisesAmong the more in-depth courses, which often require that theparticipant has already been initiated into at least the first degreeof the order, from the same period, the following themes can befound:- Advanced rune magic- Preparatory courses for initiates into the first and seconddegrees, treating the subject themes of the correspondencecourses- The course on ceremonial magic described above in section5.1.2- Advanced Tantric practices- Faustian magic (focusing on the legend of Dr. Faust)- Advanced qliphotic practices"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"241CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICE- A week long intense magical course- A weekend-long course, focusing on the magical use oftotal silence (meaning that the participants will not speakat all during the course) (Dragon Rouge 2000a-c; 2001f-i;2002a-d; 2003a-d; 2004a; 2004e-f).In the advanced courses the same themes surface more frequentlythan is the case with the more basic courses. Tantric and qliphoticpractices, along with runic, Ancient Norse and nature-based themes,form the more common areas of course-activity.The practices described are those that are arranged by themother-order, and which even low initiated members can partakein. As the order mainly consists of these low initiated members,there are no officially arranged courses that deal in specific withhigher degree practice. It would simply be more or less pointless,as there might not be enough people to attend. Correspondencecourses are available for the first three degrees, and after this thepractice for initiations is done in closer and more personal co-operation with one’s tutor in the order. Higher initiated membersmay do practices together, but this is not in an official Dragon Rougecapacity but rather on a personal level. In the spring of 2005 it wasannounced that there will be some co-ordinated workings initiatesof degrees 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 arranged later in the year (Dragon Rouge2005a).Due to my choices concerning research methods anddelineations, as I have chosen to focus on the official practice, anddue to my low initiatory level, I have not had access to higher degreemagic practice. Courses beyond the first do, however, shed somelight on higher degree work. Courses two and three mainly providedeeper focuses on themes already present in the first course. Statedgoals and focuses of degrees beyond the first are:•Degree 2.0 – Gamaliel – Astral magic, withcraft, themysteries of the dark moon and the dark goddess•Degree 3.0 – Samael – The philosophy of the left hand path,the wisdom of insanity, Yezidic magic and the dark side ofthe charkas"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"242CHAPTER 5 - PRACTICE•Degree 4.0 – A’arab Zaraq – Luciferian magic, the dark sideof Venus, Eroto-mysticism and the path of the warrior•Degree 5.0 – Thagirion – The illumination of the night-side,the dark sun and the union of the god and the beast•Degree 6.0 – Golachab – Ragnarök, the activation of Surt/Sorath and the magnetism of lust and suffering•Degree 7.0 – Gha’agsheblah – The higher levels of Eroto-mysticism and preparations for the abyss•Degree 8.0 – Satariel – The opening of the eye of Lucifer/Shiva/Odin and the Drakon principle•Degree 9.0 – Ghagiel – The lighting of the Luciferian star•Degree 10.0 – Thaumiel – The accomplishment of thepromise given by the serpent, divinity•Degree 11.0 – Thaumiel – The black hole, the step into thenew creation, Universe B (implying the magician’s creationof an existence of his/her own) (Dragon rouge 2005b)."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"243CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESPart III – Meaning Making6 Theoretical PerspectivesIn this section, I will investigate different approaches to meaningmaking, i.e. the way meaning is attributed to reality in the DragonRouge context. Studies in the psychology of religion have of latebeen mainly informed by two distinct theoretical schools, namelythe social constructionist school, with a more humanist approach,and cognitive psychology, which is based on positivist naturalsciences. Constructionist approaches have been around for a longtime, a classic work in the field being Peter Berger and ThomasLuckmann’s The Social Construction of Reality from 1966 (Luckmann& Berger 1966). The school is used in social psychology, as well asin gender and queer studies by authors such as Judith Butler (Butler1990; 1993; 1997a; 1997b). Cognitivist approaches have gained morerecent popularity in the study of religion as they begun to be usedmore in the late 1980s and in the 1990s, with authors such as DanSperber and Pascal Boyer (Sperber 1996; 2000; Boyer 1993; 1994;2001).I have chosen to take a social constructionist approach, withfocus on language as a meaning-making device, instead of basingmy analysis on cognitivist theory building. I consider this approachmore helpful in analysing the particularities of the field of study,the informants and my own role in the process of research. I regardcognitive science’s relative lack of interest in the communicativeprocesses involved in meaning-making as a serious drawback. As Ihave no way of accessing the inner thought processes of myinformants, and, even more importantly, as my informants haveno way of accessing the inner thought processes of their fellowDragon Rouge members, other than through language, I regard thestudy of language as – not only the mediator of meaning but ratherthe mechanism through which meaning is constructed – as a highlyimportant focus. However, as different tools for analysis highlightdifferent areas of the field of research, and give different and oftenequally valid results, I welcome research that focuses on differentaspects of the field."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"244CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES6.1 Social ConstructionismSocial constructionism is the main foundation on which discourseanalysis builds (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:11; Jokinen 1993:39).Kenneth J. Gergen identifies five different kinds of constructiviststances in his book, An Invitation to Social Construction (Gergen1999:59-60). These are:1) Radical constructivism, in which emphasis is laid onthe ways in which individuals construct what they taketo be reality in their minds.2)Constructivism, which like radical constructivism seesthe mind constructing reality, but here in a systematicrelationship to the external world outside theindividual.3)Social constructivism, in which the inner mentalprocess of reality construction is highly dependent onthe individual’s social relationships.4)Social constructionism, in which emphasis is placedon discourse as the means through which reality iscommunicated and constructed.5)Sociological constructivism, which focuses on the waysin which social power structures influence the humanconstruction of reality, meaning and self.As the focus in this study is on discourse, I will focus on socialconstructionism and only in passing treat the other fourconstructionist stances. Kennet Gergen discusses four workingassumptions which social constructionists usually support (Gergen1999:47-50). Gergen does, however, point out that these assumptionsare not, and should not be viewed as, finite conclusions (Gergen1999:47). The four assumptions are:1) “The terms by which we understand our world andour self are neither required nor demanded by ‘whatthere is’” (Gergen 1999:47). This means that ourlanguage and other means of communication cannot"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"245CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESprovide an objectively true map of the world “as it is”.Any number of alternative explanations could havesimilar value (as long as people respond to them in anapproving manner, as explained in assumption 2).Gergen is careful to point out that this is true for allforms of human communication, not just spoken andwritten language. By extension, this assumption couldbe understood as a declaration of the total equality ofall and every account of a specific event etc. It would,for example, be just as right to state that an apple willfloat in the air if you let go of it as it would be to statethat the apple will fall to the ground. In criticising socialconstructionism on this basis, one does not take intoaccount the other assumptions that the theoreticalschool works with.2)“Our modes of description, explanation and /orrepresentation are derived from relationship” (Gergen1999:48). This assumption holds that our ways ofunderstanding the world and events etc. are constructedin a meaning-making endeavour with othercommunicative beings. The tool is mainly language butalso other communicative systems, and the endeavouris impossible without co-workers. We do not constructmeanings in our individual minds as such, but ratherconstruct them in communicative events with ourfellow humans. As the accounts of the nature of reality,a specific event etc. are dependent on the co-operationof our fellow humans, an account that no-one elseadheres to is without value. A convincing reality isconstructed when people produce it in social relations.Gergen also points out that we, and thus ourcommunication for that matter, are not able to existwithout the natural surroundings which sustain us.These natural surroundings cannot, however, beunderstood outside communication. Peter L. Bergerexpresses the same view in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"246CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESSociety is a dialectic phenomenon in that it is ahuman product, and nothing but a humanproduct, that yet continuously acts back uponits producer. [...] There can be no social realityapart from man. Yet it may also be stated thatman is a product of society (Berger 1969: 3).3) “As we describe, explain or otherwise represent, so dowe fashion our future” (Gergen 1999: 48). Thecommunicative endeavour of constructing meaning isan essential form of social action. When we, in our socialrelationships, construct meanings we create other formsof social practice. In Gergen’s account social institutionssuch as law, education and intimate relationships aredependent on the words we use to describe and definethem. In the communicative process of meaning-making, we are constantly involved in aretransformation and reproduction of socialrelationships and institutions. Social relationships andsocial institutions cannot exist without and outside thecommunicative acts producing them. Relationships andinstitutions are never finitely made, and defined andexist in a state of constant reproduction andreconstruction through communicative renegotiation.Our futures are constructed in the ways we reproduceand transform existing institutions.4)“Reflection on our forms of understanding is vital toour future well-being” (Gergen 1999: 49). For ourfutures to develop into desirable and beneficialdirections we have to assess our present standpoints.A traditional resorting to ‘common sense’ and ‘sharedvalues’ is not all that helpful, as ‘common sense’ and‘shared values’ are situated in specific discursiverealities and thus give no objective guidance as to howone should progress. The constructionist has to thinkand judge reflectively and grasp multiple standpointsto one and the same question. He/she has to submitpersonal standpoints and ‘obvious truths’ tointerrogation. By attaining a view from a multitude of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"247CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESstandpoints and criticising ‘self-evident truths’, theconstructionist can see and judge his own standpointbetter.The four main features inherent in most social constructionist worksas presented by Vivien Burr are very similar to Gergen’sassumptions (Burr 1995: 2-5).1) A critical stance to seemingly self-evident knowledge,meaning that the categories we use to divide up andmake sense of the world are not the only ones possible.2)Our way of understanding the world is historically andculturally specific.3)Knowledge is created and maintained in socialprocesses in our daily interaction with our fellowhumans.4)Knowledge and social action are linked, meaning thatour way of understanding the world results in concreteacts.The specific examples Burr gives to explain the main features arevery helpful and enlightening (Burr 1995: 2-5; see also Granholm2004: 194-196). As one can see, the main concern in socialconstructionist theory is to question historically and culturallycreated, apparently self-evident truths, not the least of which arethe constructionist researcher’s own truths, and to examine whatconsequences these truths have on life as we live it.I will highlight the assumptions/main features in the followingexamples (based on Burr’s example in Burr 1995: 3).Take, for example, our everyday categorisation of humans intotwo distinct groups, men and women. One might argue that thereare strong grounds for maintaining this distinction as there areimportant physical (and many would say psychological) differencesbetween men and women. There are, however, many otherdifferences between humans; for example, length, colour of skin,eyes and hair, build etc. Any one of these differences could standas the key factor for dividing humans into specific groups. We could,for example, divide humans into blue-eyed, short and fat ones, and"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"248CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESbrown-eyed, brown-haired and thin ones; we have, however, chosento use the categories of man and woman.In addition to this, the distinguishing traits defining what itmeans to be a man and what it means to be a woman have variedthroughout history and have been different in different cultures.The specific characteristic traits associated with men where differentin medieval times than from what they are in Western society today.Likewise the traits associated with masculinity in Japanese societyare different from the traits associated with masculinity in theWestern cultural sphere. The traits and characteristics linked tofemininity and masculinity are constantly produced andrenegotiated in social interaction and are never finitely defined andlaid down.The splitting up of mankind into the two categories of menand women, and the defining of the characteristic traits associatedwith the categories, has resulted in actual repercussions for bothmen and women. For example; as women have been thought tohave inferior analytical intellectual capabilities to men and, in turn,have superior empathic and nurturing capabilities, women havebeen relegated to the domestic sphere to take care of the householdand the offspring, whereas men have dominated the public, politicalarena. This has, in turn, created an imbalance of power in whichmen have had the opportunity to dominate women in largely anyway they have felt like. This has further resulted in an ideologywhich condones, supports, and indeed encourages, maledomination over women, on the grounds that this is beneficial bothfor women and for society as a whole.In accordance with the fourth assumption in Gergen’s model,it would be beneficial and perhaps even necessary for the individual,society and humanity as a whole to reflect over the male-femaledichotomy, looking for differing examples from different culturalspheres and historical periods and to question the ‘self-evident’truths regarding men and women. This is, however, not relevantwithin the scope of the present study."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"249CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES6.2 Discourse AnalysisAs stated earlier, discourse analysis builds on a social constructionistfoundation (Jokinen 1999:39; Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:11). Indiscussing discourse analysis, the first task should be to definediscourse, something ignored by many scholars, which hasconsequently resulted in confusion surrounding the concept and its usein academic works. Another reason for the confusion concerningthe term is its the widespread use in various disciplines, often withwidely varying meanings (Wetherell & Potter 1987: 6-7).In the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, discourse is definedas “verbal interchange of ideas” or “formal and orderly and usuallyextended expression of thought on a subject” (Merriam-Webster2004b). As used in discourse analytic research, the concept is definedsomewhat differently, but still focusing on the ‘speech in use’ notiongiven in the dictionaries. Jonathan Potter uses discourse for “textsand speech in use”, ‘in use’ meaning in actual situations wherelanguage or other symbol-systems are used (Potter 1996: 15; seeWetherell & Potter 1987: 7; see also Suoninen 1999: 19-20). Importantto note is that discourse is not only bound to written or spokenlanguage (as discussed in section 6.1), but to all communicative acts.For example, a certain composition of pictures in an advertisementor the creative use of musical notes played by specific musicalinstruments can communicate meaning in the same way as a verbalstatement. Vivien Burr describes how it is possible, and often done,to ‘read’ other people’s clothing, behaviour etc. for meaning in thesame way we read texts for meaning (Burr 1995: 50-51; Fairclough1992: 3-5; 1995a: 54). Norman Fairclough defines text as the writtenor spoken product of the text-producing process (Fairclough 1992:3).I would like to state, however, that text should not be understoodsimply as human language communication produced in writtenform, but rather in a more inclusive way as everything we can ‘read’meaning into. Not all of our human communication, and thusdiscourse, takes place on a conscious level. A major part of ourcommunicative acts are on a subconscious level, expressed in theway we act, move, look, talk and remain silent."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"250CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESEero Suoninen (et al.) likens discourse to meaning-systems(Suoninen et al. 1993:26) which construct reality in a certain way(Suoninen 1999:21). Michel Foucault uses discourse in the sense ofspeech and texts in use, as well as the practice responsible for acertain type of speech and text (see Rosengren 1993:57). A clarifyingexample could be medical discourse, in and through which forexample alcoholism is treated in a different way than in an economicdiscourse. Louise Phillips and Marianne Winther Jørgensen definediscourse as “a fixed way of talking about and understanding theworld (or a section of it)” (Phillips & Jørgensen 2000:7). Vivien Burrdescribes discourse as “a set of meanings, metaphors,representations, images, stories, statements and so on that in someway together produce a particular version of events” (Burr 1995:48).According to Helena Hurme and Sirkka Hirsijärvi, discourseconstitutes an organized whole which is a time-bound processcontaining an attempt to influence the listener or the reader(Hirsijärvi & Hurme 2000:51). A distinction should be made betweenthemes and discourses (see Suonien 1997:67-68). To use an exampleI employed in an earlier essay (Granholm 2001a). A thematic fieldcould, for example, be Satanism, as in all the discussion surroundingthe subject of Satanism in a TV-programme focusing on thisparticular subject (see SVT 1 1996). Discourses, on the other hand,are the different viewpoints and ways of seeing and experiencingthe subject-matter which are expressed in the program. For example:the discourses of ‘Satanism as a legitimate philosophical way ofthought’, ‘Satanism as a danger for society’ and ‘Satanism asharmless and naive’ could all be expressed in the same theme ofdiscussion, namely ‘Satanism’. The same discourses could also beexpressed on completely different themes, such as ‘Adolescentviolence’ or ‘Religion and spirituality’.Suoninen (et al.) list five basic presumptions that discourseanalysis builds on (Suoninen et al. 1993: 17-18; Suoninen 1999: 18;see also Phillips & Jørgensen 2000: 11-12).1)Language use constructs social reality2)There are several competing systems of meaning3)Acts of meaning-making are bound to the context theyappear in"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"251CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES4)Actors are attached to meaning systems5)Language use has consequences (see also Hirsijärvi &Hurme 2000: 51).As we can see, the basic tenets of discourse analysis are very similar tothose of social constructionism. One could perhaps even say, at the riskof oversimplifying, that social constructionism is the theory anddiscourse analysis is the practice. As Gergen states, however, thereare many different forms of constructivism and not all forms focusas much on language and other symbol systems as the vehicles ofsocial reality construction (Gergen 1999: 59-60).To further highlight what the basic assumptions signify, someclarifications might be in order (based on Suoninen et al. 1993:18-45). In discourse analysis language is not seen as a direct reflectionof an underlying true reality (see Hirsijärvi & Hurme 2000:17;Marander-Eklund 2000:19, 48-50). For example, the word ‘table’does not in itself spring from the physical object ‘table’. A clearercase would be Suoninen’s (et al.) example of something as abstractas colours (Suoninen et al. 1993:19-20). When we see living grassand say that its colour is ‘green’, it is so because of culturalconvention. We could just as well call it black, if the case were that‘blackness’ was the common and socially accepted denominator ofthe object. Concepts are defined in relation to each other. Again, inthe case of colours, the colour ‘red’ is defined in relation to othercolours and vice versa.Likewise, other concepts and words are defined in relation toeach other. For example, ‘table’ is defined in relation to ‘chair’ ‘wall’,‘ceiling’ etc. Language use not only describes the world butconstructs it to a high degree, or as Margaret Wetherell and JonathanPotter express it, discourse is “not partially constitutive, butthoroughly constitutive” (Wetherell & Potter 1992: 62).The word ‘table’ not only refers to the object ‘table’, but alsobrings with it a whole mass of ideas concerning the nature, use andpurpose of the ‘table’. An object defined as a ‘work bench’ issomething completely different from a ‘dinner table’ even if theobjects were physically completely identical. The understandingswe connect to different words and concepts are the result of socialconvention. When we see a wooden board elevated on top of four"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"252CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESwooden legs, we interpret it to be a table because our cultural andsocial knowledge, communicated to us through language, tells usit is a table. If we lived in an English-speaking community withouttables we would not understand the object as such. Even thoughthe connection between objects, meanings etc. and words is quitearbitrary, the individual is not able to attach meanings to wordsequally arbitrarily, as the understandings we attach to words springfrom social conventions. In order for communication to be fruitfuland even possible the individuals communicating must have similarunderstandings of the subject matters communicated. Suoninen (etal.) are careful to point out that the importance placed on theconstructive nature of language and other meaning-systems doesnot entail the separation of ‘real reality’ and language, but ratherlanguage is very much part of and in ‘real reality’ (Suoninen et al.1993:21). Quoting Wetherell and Potter:New Zealand is no less real for being constituted discursively –you still die if your plane crashes into a hill whether you thinkthat the hill is the product of a volcanic eruption or the solidifiedform of a mythical whale (Wetherell & Potter 1992: 65).Wetherell and Potter go on to say that this materiality of realitydoes not mean that it is less discursive. The way that death due tothe plane crashing into the hill is understood is thoroughlydiscursive (Wetherell & Potter 1992: 65).The second basic tenet of discourse analysis deals with the factthat there are many different ways to understand and interpret anyone single situation, event, thing, object etc. In discourse analysis,the different ways of interpreting it are called discourses orinterpretive repertoires, and consist of relatively coherent systems(see Suoninen et al. 1993:26-29). Quite often, the separate discoursespertaining to an object of communication are in conflict with eachother, even though this does not always have to be the case. Forexample, when discussing propagation in a country such as Finland,several distinct discourses frequently arise. Someone might arguefor the benefits of adoption and labour immigration as a means toincrease population, on the grounds that overpopulation is a globalproblem and that no one country should be viewed as an isolated"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"253CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESunit, whereas someone else might argue for the importance ofsupporting increased procreation among the populace, on thegrounds that the population of the country is not growing at asufficient rate. Each of these discourses contains a plethora ofassumptions and ready-made convictions. The second discourse isthe dominant one in Finnish discussion and can, if and when itcomes to totally overshadow any possible conflicting discourse, becalled a hegemonic discourse, that is to say, a discourse which istaken for granted and considered as objective truth (see Jokinen &Juhila 1996:20, 53-61).As discourses are language and other symbol-systems in use,they cannot be studied independently from their contexts. Thecontext is always a social-relational situation in which the actorsare engaged in communication. This would be the case, for example,with an advertisement in a newspaper, where the message iscommunicated through a medium where the two parties of theprocess probably never meet in person and the actors need not bein actual contact with each other. In the above example, the actorcommunicates in a mediated way and the respondent interpretsthe message through the culturally, socially and ideologicallyavailable tools he/she has at his/her disposal, and then perhapscommunicates it further. Discourse exists in the act ofcommunication, with the creator of the advertisementcommunicating his/her idea and the respondent interpreting thisidea in the same way as two persons physically at the same locationwould communicate. Many discourse analysts see the interactionbetween actors in communication as an area of special interest (seefor example Fairclough 1995a:125-128; Jokinen et al. 1993:31-32;Jokinen & Juhila 1996:45; Suoninen 1997:77-78)The context of the communicative process must be taken intoconsideration in order to perform an adequate analysis. Contextmight not necessarily mean the physical circumstances of thecommunicative process, but rather the context of the text segmentbeing analyzed in relation to the textual and intertextual setting itis embedded in. For example, the researcher cannot simply extracta segment of text in which the informant states that ‘Lesbiansshouldn’t get medical help to become pregnant’ and simply leaveit at that. If the informant goes on to say ‘We have a problem with"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"254CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESoverpopulation and adoption should always be the first alternative’,it gives the earlier segment a completely different meaning than ifthe informant claims ‘Homosexuality is an abomination’.The researcher always uses his previous cultural knowledgeand initial assumptions in the course of doing an analysis (Jokinen& Juhila 1996: 45-46). It is important for the validity of the studythat the researcher identifies his/her initial assumptions (andprejudices for that matter), and reflects on how these influence theanalysis, and in the case of the researcher creating his/her materialin fieldwork and interviews, influence the material in itself. Withreflection on one’s assumptions and the use of earlier culturalknowledge the study can be made better.The basic notion of the actor being attached to meaning systemsdelineates a path for the researcher where he/she concentrates onthe social conventions of communication and the systems ofmeaning produced, rather than on the individual actors themselves.Whereas cognitive science usually focuses on the inner mental lifeof the individual, discourse analysis focuses on relationalcommunication and meaning-making through symbol-systems inuse. Cognitive science views human communication as themanifestation of inner thoughts already formulated in the mind ofthe person communicating. Consequently, discourse as such is onlyinteresting for the cognitivist as a means to access the inner processesof the human. In discourse analysis, on the other hand, discourse isseen, not as a simple and direct mirroring of the individual’sthought-processes, but rather as a tool to formulate and maintainthought-processes. Discourse, and accordingly human meaning-making, is something which is not situated outside the context ofdiscourse. To put it simply: an event may occur in a real worldoutside human discourse but we have no way of attaching meaningto that event outside discourse. The event of, for example, becomingpregnant only gains meaning in and through discourse. Thepregnancy is represented as a blessing, or a nightmare, when wecommunicate it to someone else.With the above example of pregnancy, the event becomes apositive or negative thing in our communicating it to others. Toquote Wetherell and Potter again: “discourse and ideologicalpractice are inseparable from other social practices” (Wetherell &"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"255CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESPotter 1992: 61). Every aspect of societal life is steeped in ideologyand discourse and, furthermore, there is “no ‘versionless’ reality”(Wetherell & Potter 1992: 61-62). In societal convention theinterpretation of the situation depends much on the circumstancesof our life. If my partner and I were a happy couple with a stableeconomy, most people in our circles would probably consider thepregnancy a joyous event. If, on the other hand, I was a 15-year-oldgirl and the pregnancy was a result of rape, the situation would becompletely different. In the latter case, societal norms maintain thatpregnancy through rape is never a good thing, and that teenagepregnancy is likewise a negative thing for child, mother and society,and as such I would have considerable difficulties in convincingpeople that I was happy to be pregnant and that my pregnancy wasa good thing. Through the discourses of ‘teenage pregnancy isnegative’ and ‘pregnancy through rape is negative’, my possibleprior self-identification (although the discourses mentioned may,and likely will, already have influenced my initial interpretation ofthe situation) as a happy future mother is rendered null. The mostlikely consequences are that I will be approached with ampleinformation about the possibilities of aborting the foetus or adoptingthe child after birth and strongly advised, or even compelled, to dothis. At the very least, I will be bombarded with gestures ofsympathy for my ‘unfortunate condition’. The pregnancy is thusthrough the discursive acts of others, due to the societal conventionsidentifying it as undesirable, represented as a bad thing and theconsequence might very well be abortion or subsequent adoption.Discourse is social action (see Suoninen 1997: 56-57), and discourseanalysts such as Norman Fairclough see the main task of the analystas the illumination of the connections between discursive practiceand social practice (Fairclough 1995a: 16-17).Discourse is also an integral part of identity, or more specificallythe process of constructing and negotiating identity (See Gee1999:13-17; see also Fairclough 1995a:12 regarding mass-mediatedidentity-construction). Identity is not something an individualacquires when growing up, and which then stays basicallyunchanged until the individual dies. According to Mia Lövheim,identity is a continuing process in which the individual reflexivelyconstructs a meaningful and coherent narrative based on his/her"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"256CHAPTER 6 - THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVESexperiences and which is then revised in relation to others as wellas in relation to new experiences and information (Lövheim 2003:120-121; based on Giddens 1996). When identity is analysed throughdiscourse, it tends to be seen as something even more flexible andvariable. Individuals have many different identities, all constructedand expressed in relational contexts. “You project a different identityat a formal dinner party than you do at the family dinner table”, asexpressed by James Paul Gee (Gee 1999: 13). Although people have,most likely, always expressed and constructed various distinctiveidentities, the extent of the variation and the reflexivity and opennessof the process may be in response to the particularities of latemodern society (see Giddens 1996). Although an intriguing issue,the question of identity will not, however, be treated in greater depthin the present study."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"257CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKING7 Dragon Rouge and Meaning Making7.1 Discursive StrategiesI have focused on six major discourses that I have found in mymaterial. I call these the Magic-is-all-encompassing-, the Self-evolvement-, the Individuality-, the Magic-is-Demanding-, the Nature-and the Women’s Rights discourses. These discourses are keyelements in the Dragon Rouge magic system and the order’s practiceof magic. There are other repertoires to be found in my material,but I have identified these six as the most important. In sections7.1.1 to 7.1.6, I present the discourses, give examples of the contextsin which they are used and discuss their importance for DragonRouge’s overall conceptual world. In section 7.2, I treat theinterlinking of the discourses. The discourses exist in a complexand thus work in unison, supporting each other. On the other hand,some of the discourses contradict each other. This is a common traitof human meaning-making, and I will show how this workslogically.In his PhD thesis, Claiming Knowledge, Olav Hammer discussescertain discursive strategies employed by adherents of variousWestern Esoteric and ‘New Age’ movements (Hammer 2001). Thefirst of these strategies is the appeal to tradition, in which a historicallineage is constructed for the spiritual ideas of the movement. Notuncommonly, the idea of a philosophia perennis or a universal coreof truth to be found in all religious traditions in the world, anddelivered in pure form by the movement in question, is present inthe appeal to tradition. This particular strategy is a key element inmuch Western esotericism and falls under the characteristic elementidentified by Antoine Faivre as transmission (see Faivre 1994: 14-15). A ‘New Age’ group could, for example, include the practice ofshamanism on its schedule and seek justification by recognizingshamanistic elements in as wide an array of traditions as NativeAmerican religious practice, Tibetan Buddhism, Old Norse religion,Ancient Greek religion and the ancient religions of the Middle East.Shamanism is thus asserted as a genuine and pure form ofspirituality."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"258CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGThe second strategy discussed by Hammer is the scientificationof the esoteric worldview. This means that adherents to themovement claim a scientific, rational base for their belief andpractice. An example would be Chaos magic, which builds on Chaostheory and Quantum Physics. A further, more common, occurrenceis the psychologization of many esoteric theories. Here, movementsdraw on popularized psychological theories, especially Jungian, toseek justification for their worldview. Henrik Bogdan discusses thisbriefly in his PhD thesis dealing with Western Esoteric initiatorymovements (Bogdan 2003b: 19).The third and last strategy is that of experience. Here, themembers of a movement place authority on their personalexperiences in the realm of esotericism, as well as on the experienceof others. It is not uncommon for movements to be formed on thebasis of the religious visions or experiences of a certain foundingmember. New members attain their own experiences modelled afterthe founding ones, and these are, in turn, incorporated into thereligion to give it further authority. Although Hammer’s analysisis sound, the underlying tone of his work is critical. In addition toanalysing, he also questions the claims made by esotericists on thegrounds of theim being false (see section 1.3.3 in the present workfor an example). In my view, one should take into account that thediscursive strategies constructing a legendary past history of theesoteric movement in question are part of the founding myth ofsuch movements. As Henrik Bogdan puts it when discussing thefounding myth of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: “thisshould not be viewed as a simple fraud or an attempt at deceivingwould-be members, but rather as an expression of a certain form ofthought in which legitimacy can be founded on spiritual rather thanon historical grounds” (Bogdan 2003b: 173-174).All of these strategies can be found to a greater or lesser extentin Dragon Rouge as well. Like most esoteric movements in the West,Dragon Rouge incorporates elements from diverse religious andesoteric traditions around the world, such as Tantrism, coreshamanism (with distinct Old Norse traits), post-enlightenmentmagic currents and qabalah. All of these traditions, and many more,are said to contain elements of truth – and almost every religioustradition to be found in the world can have some usable traits or"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"259CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGsomething of interest (see IF mgt 2001/14; 2001/52; 2001/54; 2001/56; 2001/58). Even more apparent, is the use of various myths inthe Dragon Rouge context. Many “world-creation” myths are shownto incorporate some sort of dragon as the powerful chaos-elementwhich must be defeated and controlled in order for the world as weknow it to be brought into existence.The discourse of a philosophia perennis does not, however,necessarily mean that the members accept at face value the claimsof an underlying “true” esoteric religious core behind all of theexoteric religions of the world. As my informants have said to me,and as I have discovered for myself: magicians and the practice ofmagic are pragmatic. The magician uses what he or she needs inorder to complete the ritual etc. For example, one of my informantstold me that he can be a devoted worshipper of Christ in one ritualand a devoted worshipper of Satan in another, all according to thenature and requirements of the ritual in question (IF mgt 2001/13-14). On the Dragon Rouge homepage, one can read a critique ofoverly analytical thinking. For the magician, it is better to practiceanalogical thinking, in which connections between things are seeninstead of differences as in analytical thinking (Dragon Rouge2004c).Scientification, mostly in the appeal to psychological theory, isalso a much employed strategy in Dragon Rouge. There is evidently,however, a conscious attempt to place higher authority on purelymystic or esoteric models of explanation, as one would expect froma postmodern re-enchantment of the world. Among the discursivestrategies identified by Hammer, the appeal to experience is thestrongest one in Dragon Rouge. The most common way to claimthe truthfulness of one’s beliefs is to appeal to personal experiencesof the magic realm. Personal experiences are, as a rule, discussed atthe end of a magic meeting (see section 5.2). Here, the members canput their experience of the magic just performed into words andput it all into context. The early magico-mystical experiences offounder Thomas Karlsson are also of importance. These experiencesare not directly referred to as a source of authority, but they functionas a legend legitimating Thomas Karlsson as a genuine magician,and thus legitimating Dragon Rouge as a genuine magical order."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"260CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGImportant as the discourses of tradition, science and experienceare, they do not reflect the core discursive practice in Dragon Rouge.The abovementioned discourses are general components ofoccultism, or secular esotericism. They do not provide insight intothe particularities of the order, and do not form the basis of theDragon Rouge worldview and value-systems. The discoursestreated by Hammer are more of rhetorical tools, providing abelievable foundation for esoteric worldviews otherwise ill fit inthe frame of mind of a rational-secular world. I have chosen not tofocus on the aspects legitimating an esoteric interpretation of theworld, but rather on the more interior aspects of an occult worldview– aspects fusing the components of occult practice into a coherentand, for certain individuals, compelling worldview. The majorityof the discourses treated can probably be found in some form inmost late modern neopagan and magic movements, and are thusnot unique to Dragon Rouge. Rather, they point to importantconnecting points in the cultic milieu.Discourse analysis is an intricate matter. There are no clear rulesor conventions as how to conduct an analysis, and the main tool isthe subjective mind of the analyst – combined with his/her natureas a communicative and interpretative being. The key point is,however, quite simple. The researcher is to analyze his/her materialthoroughly and find and identify recurrent meaning-conveyingelements. One is also to reflect on how these elements occur in thematerial. Are they of a primary character, or is their main functionto support other argumentative segments? Discourses are, asdefined in section 6.2, more or less coherent meaning-complexes.Discourses can in this way be separated from themes, which arethe subject matters in, and through, which the construction ofmeaning-systems is performed. To provide a visual; one could saythat themes are horizontal – concerning general topics of discussion,whereas discourses are vertical – cutting through several themes,providing meaning-systems in which the subjects of discussion areevaluated and placed in relation to other subjects. (see Granholm2004).The discourses treated in this chapter surfaced in both myethnographic research and the official material of the order. Whenconducting the interviews and when pre-analyzing the"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"261CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGquestionnaire answers certain interpretative repertoires seemed totake dominating positions. My informants regularly stressed thedemands this specific form of magic places on the practitioner, andoften talked of the higher goals of one’s magic practice. Theimportant role magic played in the informant’s lives combined withthe unique and total character of dark magic seemed to frame thediscussions as well. The difficulties Inner Circle members had infinitely defining the Dragon Rouge magic system for each and everyindividual suggested that individuality was highly praised, andmany members went to lengths in order to stress that femalemembers had a very important standing in the order. All of thiswas done although the questions I asked did not seem to demandanswers of this sort. When analyzing my material in more depththese initial interpretations only grew in strength.The discourses treated in the following chapter provide theframe in which the subjects discussed among Dragon Rougemembers, and treated in courses and meetings, are placed. Forexample, discussions on magical progress were variously infusedwith notions of the importance of nature, of finding one’s ownindividual path and on finding ways out of restricting gender roles,in a self-evolutionary process, of dealing with the demands imposedby the work undertaken and of the holistic nature of the process.By and in themselves the subject themes of initiations, rituals,meditations and astral journeys mean little. It is in placing them inmeaning-systems that they gain importance and form a worldviewand provide a sense of purpose."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"262CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKING7.1.1 Magic is All-encompassingThe Magic-is-All-encompassing discourse is twofold. First, it treatsthe Dragon Rouge system of magic as a more complex and inclusivesystem than many others, in particular systems of white magic andreligion. Second, it deals with the idea of magic as pertaining to allfields of the practitioner’s life. The reason for my treating it as asingle discourse instead of two separate discourses, is theinterlinking and basic oneness of the two themes. The Dragon Rougesystem of magic permeates all fields of the practitioner’s life becauseit is so complex. The following excerpt illustrates my point.Light magic, is more related to religion as I see it because thereis a desire to, leave things in the hands of I mean that one views,cosmos and existence, like, things, how should one put it, thatthere are, laws and there are obviously laws but the darkmagician and the light magician view these laws differently alight magician sees these laws as, I mean the laws, start outfrom some kind of reason I mean that that which to humanreason seem good, are the laws this classical that the Greekphilosophers, some kind of, a bit Platonic I don’t know, but thedark magician, perhaps dives deeper, and sees so to say triesto see what it is that actually controls I mean what do the actualnatural laws look like. (IF mgt 2001/4791).In the same context, the informant stresses that dark magic entailsa more active stance to life, in which one assumes control of one’slife instead of letting some higher force steer one’s fate (IF mgt 2001/47). The Dragon Rouge magician lives his/her magic. In the practiceof magic, the magician learns the deepest secrets of the universe91“Den ljusa magin, är väl mera besläktad med religionen som jag uppleverdet för det finns en önskan att, lämna saker i händerna alltså man man man serväl på, kosmos och på på på skapelsen, som att, saker och ting, hur skall mansäga, att det finns, lagar, och det finns självklart lagar men den mörka magikernoch den ljusa magikern ser på de här lagarna annorlunda en ljus magiker ser påatt de här lagarna är, alltså lagarna, utgår oftast från någon slags förnuft alltsådet det som för det mänskliga förnuftet verkar bra, det är lagarna det härklassiska som de grekiska filosoferna, något så här, någon sorts, lite platonsktjag vet inte, men men alltså en mörkmagiker, kanske går djupare, och ser liksomförsöker se vad egentligen är det som som styr alltså hur ser de här egentliganaturlagarna ut”."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"263CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGand existence and this obviously affects his/her life. The complexityof the Dragon Rouge magic system creates a situation where thepractice of magic comes to affect all aspects of the magician’s life.The same respondent goes on to criticize religion and white magicfor weighing the forces, and especially the darker, hidden aspectsof existence, on a moral scale....so that I see it as a natural development, I see it as qliphoththat the dark side exists is natural, it’s not like, it’s somethingthat’s wrong but, but, it’s something that’s completely naturalin other words not to take in the dark side, that’s unnaturallike, it’s something which is a part of us in the same way as wehave a shadow, and it’s a bit interesting because, I think that,there is some theory that, that, that Jesus, that he cut off hisshadow and thus created the Anti-Christ and it’s a bit interestingif we are to see it like that, because it has to be in some way theworst thing one could do to, cut off one’s shadow because theshadow is a natural part of you as long as you are in harmonyeverything will be, good, but if you cut it off then it means that,it becomes the total duality where one part is totally good andthe other is fully evil, or fully if one now should say whichmeans that it has to be very dangerous to let loose, this, otherside it is really not taking one’s responsibility in some way. (IFmgt 2001/4792).What the respondent says, is that not having such a complex systemas Dragon Rouge is inharmonious, and possibly dangerous. Themagician has to use all aspects of him-/herself and not be limitedto only one side. The Dragon Rouge system is a way to do this. In92 “...så att jag ser det som en naturlig utveckling, jag ser det som att kliffotatt den mörka sidan finns det är naturligt liksom, det är inte som att, det ärnågonting som är fel utan, utan, det är nånting som är fullkomligt naturligtalltså att inte ta med den mörka sidan, det är onaturligt alltså så att, det är junånting som är en del av oss precis som vi har en skugga, och det är lite intressantför att, jag tror att, det finns någon teori om att, att Jesus, att han klippte av sinskugga och där igenom skapade anti-krist och det är ju lite intressant om vi skase det så, för att, det måste ju på något sätt vara det värsta man kan göra att,liksom klippa av sin skugga för att skuggan är ju en naturlig del av dig och sålänge som ni är i harmoni så kommer allt och vara, bra, men om du klipper avden så innebär det ju att, det blir den totala dualiteten liksom att den ena sidanär totalt god den andra sidan helt ond då, eller helt om man då ska säga vilketinnebär att det måste ju bli väldigt farligt att släppa lös, den här, andra sidandet blir verkligen att inte ta sitt ansvar på något sätt”"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"264CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGincorporating all aspects of his/her person, a magical and highlysignificant task for the practitioner, the use of magic quite naturallyaffects the magician’s whole life. Later on in the interview, therespondent dives deeper into the idea of cosmic harmony, and inthe process demonstrates the interconnectedness of everything.it is something we usually call the breath of the dragon, whichis in some way a pulse in the cosmos which some also call chaos,this breath like, you have a dissolving phase and a joining phaseand they go in waves and as a magician one learns to ride thisone finds this pulse in oneself for example we have the breathwe have the heart we have like, the seasons we have night andday we have it everywhere so it’s very easy to use it. (IF mgt2001/4793).Two female members of the order speak in a similar fashion.I mean if one did not, believe that everything was linked thenone wouldn’t even be a magician, because it’s then when youcan really influence something when you believe that there areconnections, and then it’s self-evident that if I do a lot of negativethings, then it has a negative affect and then it rebounds on mein the end. (IF mgt 2001/5594).These two examples show how the practice of magic can affect dailylife. Everything is interconnected and thus everything you dothrough magic affects everything else you do, and vice versa. Infact a magician cannot really do anything which is not magic, aseverything he/she does affects everything else he/she does.93 “det är någonting som vi brukar kalla drakens andetag, som är på någotsätt en puls i kosmos som även vissa kallar för kaos, den här andningen liksomatt, du har en upplösande fas du har en sammanfogande fas och det går liksomom vart annat och som magiker lär man sig att rida på det här man hittar denhär pulsen i sig själv till exempel att vi har ju den här vi har ju andningen vi harhjärtat vi har vi har liksom, årstiderna vi har natt och dag vi har det här överalltså det är väldigt enkelt att använda sig av det”.94 “alltså om man inte, trodde att allting hängde ihop då skulle man ju inteens vara magiker, för det är ju då man faktiskt kan påverka nånting när mantror att de har samband, och då är det självklart att om jag gör massor mednegativa saker, så påverkar det ju negativt och då slår det tillbaka på mig islutändan”."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"265CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGThe discourse appears frequently in the official Dragon Rougematerial, such as the correspondence courses in magic and on theDragon Rouge homepage. On the Dragon Rouge homepage, the‘Five Elementary Draconian Principles’ are part of the Magic-is-all-encompassing discourse.All is oneOuroboros or the dragon that bites its tail shows the eternalreturn and that the beginning is the end and the end is thebeginning, in the small is the great and in the great is the small,the one is the all and in the all is the one. That which is aboveis like that which is below (Dragon Rouge 2004c).In the first correspondence course in magic, it is stated that “Theuniverse is a gigantic unit of different forces that move in differentways.” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 195), and in treating the control ofpower-points in the magician’s life that “... man is connected tocountless points in existence ...” (Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 1096). Magicis a way of seeing, experiencing and controlling the myriad of forcesthat constitute existence. Effecting changes in existence through themeans of magic is made possible by the fact that everything consistsof power, forces and energy in one form or another (see DragonRouge 2004c), and that the individual magician is, as a part of theseforces, connected to everything else. On an individual level, withreference to the second quotation above, the magician can, andindeed needs to, explore how he/she is connected to differentinfluencing points in his/her existence. The magician needs toexplore these points of influence in depth and learn of their origin,mechanisms of influence, and go beyond their seemingly trivialpoints of reference. In this way the magician, according to the order,becomes the one who controls these points of influence instead ofsimply being controlled by them.Magic and magic power in itself, is defined as being theprehistoric, original and all-encompassing force of existence. “Magicis force, the force of Will, and this force exists in the magician and95 “Universum är en gigantisk enhet av olika krafter som rör sig på olikasätt”.96 “...är en människa knuten till oräkneliga punkter i tillvaron ...”."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"266CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGaround him/her.” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 297), and in discussingthe Dragon as a symbol of chaos “which is the original and limitlessforce” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 298).The Magic-is-all-encompassing discourse has similarities toitem number one in Faivre’s characteristics of esotericism, the ideaof correspondences (see Faivre 1994: 10-11).7.1.2 Self-evolvementThe discourse of self-evolvement deals, as the label implies, withthe personal growth on many levels of the practitioner of magic.Commonly, members of Dragon Rouge see the practice of magicprimarily as a road to personal evolution, although not necessarilyin the secular, or in the often more restricted ‘New Age’, aspect ofthe term. The personal evolution of the Dragon Rouge member isnot limited to this plane of existence, but reaches into the astralplanes and the afterlife. The magician’s personal evolution is abouttranscending human limitations and becoming something morethan what he/she is. As stated in the first correspondence course inmagic, the goal of the dark magician is to “develop an elevatedconsciousness” (Dragon Rouge 1996/6: 199). The magician should“work with the dark forces in order to dissolve all his/her limitationsand thereby come into contact with the magical forces andcapacities” (Dragon Rouge 1996/6: 3100). Reference is also made toC.G. Jung and his psychological notion of the “process ofindividuation” (Dragon Rouge 1996/6: 2).Similarly, the self is not understood exactly as the self of self-help manuals. The self of the magician is something which is carvedout from underneath the layers of false selfhood veiling the TrueSelf (called the Will, as is the case in most forms of contemporary97 “Magin är kraft, viljekraft, och denna kraften finns i magikern och runtdenne”.98 “... vilket är den ursprungliga och gränslösa kraften”.99 “att utveckla ett upphöjt medvetande...”.100 “...arbeta med de mörka makterna för att lösa upp alla sinabegränsningar och därigenom komma i kontakt med de magiska krafterna ochförmågorna”."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"267CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGmagic). The task of the magician is to find this core-self and tostrengthen it gradually, by the use of magic, so that it can grow andevolve. By exploring him/herself and existence in meditation andother activities, the magician acquires a deeper understanding ofthe interconnectedness of everything.An advanced member of the order defines the Dragon Rougesystem of magic in the following way: “It is the frame you couldsay, the dark alchemical path of evolution” (IF mgt 2001/47101).Alchemy, as understood in contemporary occult interpretations ofthe documents and texts of medieval alchemy, is an esoteric practicewith the goal of purifying the soul until a divine state is attained, inthe metaphor of transmuting lead into gold.

Before this process, man’s destiny is pre-determined.Dragon Rouge is about total personal development. In theprocess the magician will live a fuller life, thus becoming a moreharmonious person and in the end be able to overcome death (seethe quotation below). The magician is said to be able to fulfil allhis/her dreams and the magic power of the magician is the powerof his/her own spirit (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 2-3). The magicianwho has reached the highest stage of magic evolution has perfectedhim-/herself and become a god (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 6). The wayto perfecting the self is through awakening the internal Dragon-force, and in doing this it is important to direct the force to thespecific goal and purpose of perfecting oneself, and, furthermore,actively reflecting on exactly how one wants to evolve (DragonRouge 1996/1: 8; 1996/3: 1). The magician’s personal evolution isthus no passive process. The magician must constantly be aware ofthe process and actively work for his/her progress.A good idea of the extent of the self-development is revealedin the way the order defines the higher will.it’s about a sort of more instinctive inner will, which is similarto what Crowley means by the True Will although perhaps not,it was his definition and we have another perhaps, and, to, insome way, fulfil, one’s existence, we feel is, to like, create foroneself a so, how should I put it such a complete a so, perfectand whole, soul, that it can withstand, just about everything ifwe say it can withstand, death it can withstand, it is like itsown universe like its own, how should one say and only thenmenar att om du som en mörkmagiker du når, olika upplysningar olika energiergenom de här olika systemen och teknikerna så kommer det ju att bli så att iditt magiska arbete jobbar du ju, du skall ju uppnå det här för dig själv så klartmen, när du gör det så, kommer du oundvikligen att sprida det vidare till andra.Det blir ju så.”."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"269CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGcan one complete one’s existence as one isn’t any longercontrolled by, the limitations we have here, and to reach a, toreach a god-stage.

A male member of the order criticizes the practice of whitemagicians and ‘New Age’ practitioners of using their magic to helpothers in mundane matters. The respondent cast light on the issueby pointing out that it is almost impossible to see all theconsequences of one’s actions. A superficially benevolent thing, likehealing a sick person, can backfire, for example, if the person healedthen neglects the reasons why he or she became sick in the firstplace, whereas a superficially malevolent thing such as injuring aperson can be the right course of action, for example, if the personinjured otherwise would have caused greater suffering to others.This thing with constantly running around helping otherson a pretty, low level like Oh you’ve hurt your knee now Imust help you and this, it is a bit that, people want to justifythemselves by, by becoming good, on paper, it’s a bit thisJesus-thing now we shall sacrifice each other a bit that that Ihave to I mean the classic thing is that people who cannotmanage to face their own problems, they fill their lives withothers’ problems, ... and I have seen this in many lightmagicians who I have, met ...

The adept has to listhis character traits; the ones he/she thinks are good on one list andthe bad ones on another. He/she should then meditate over thelists and go deeper into his/her real self, in order to explore whetherthe traits considered good really are good and vice versa. The listsshould then be revised and the list of bad character traits burned.(Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 1). The magician thus goes beyond a secularpsychological reflection over his/her personality; he/she activelyseeks to refine his/her person through a ritual. Later on in thecourse, it is stated that the common man uses less than onethousandth of his/her potential, and that, through magic training,one can access and achieve the totality of oneself and one’s potential.The magician expands beyond his/her limits. (Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 2-3).There are however many ways to use magic and not all of themare only beneficial for the magician’s personal evolution. Insteadof focusing on mundane things one can achieve with magic, suchas gaining riches or other physical benefits, the magician should“concentrate on [magic] which is self-developing” (Dragon Rouge1996/3: 6-7105). In order to break away from limiting everydayinhibitions, the magician can perform a ‘death-ritual’, in which he/she symbolically dies and is reborn purified and re-energized(Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 11).The discourse of self-evolvement has similarities tocharacteristic number four of the intrinsic elements of esotericismin Antoine Faivre’s classificatory schemata: transmutation (seeFaivre 1994:13-14).grann att att jag måste jag menar det klassiska är att personer som inte klararav att möta sina egna problem, de fyller sina liv med andras problem, ... ochdet har jag sett hos många ljusmagiker som jag har, träffat ...

The discourse stresses the individualfreedom of the Dragon Rouge member. Each Dragon Rouge memberis free to, and indeed expected to, make his/her own choicesregarding the practice of magic, progress in his/her magical journey,level of commitment to the organization and magic in itself. Theleading members I have interviewed go to great lengths to expresshow important it is that the member is his/her own person and hasthe right to choose the ways of practicing magic that best suit him/her. At the same time, the total indulgence in individualism ofcertain satanic organizations is discouraged. It is stated that DragonRouge consists of its members, is formed by its members and thatthe organization therefore is in a state of constant change. As oneleading member says:Dragon Rouge we. It’s such a wide spectrum of people involvedand our magical system grows all the time and evolves withthe members which means that, one can very one can really,take in anything, with some, limitations but if somebody is forexample really interested in shamanism then then, it’s a part ofthe system.

Later on during the interview theinterviewee says that the basis of Dragon Rouge is a “darkalchemical road of progress”, and that this is the only idea requiredthat members adhere to (IF mgt 2001/47). However, he quicklyretracts this with the words:Or required..., [...] a member for example who, does notpartake in a correspondence course and isn’t initiated, who justis a member, can basically [believe what he/she wants to] wehave no control over that similarly to political parties forexample. They do not know what alignment all the membershave. I mean you can become a member of the Conservatives ifyou want to even if you’re a communist for example the sameway as a Satanist could become a member of Dragon Rougeand that does not mean that we are Satanists. A nonconformistreligious person could become a member and it’s not we whoare nonconformists because of that but, you could say, the outermembers. (IF mgt 2001/47107).Even though he does speak in the discourse of individuality, thespecific individual’s freedom to define Dragon Rouge is linked tohis/her level of activity in the organization.As the order is dependent of its members, to the degree of beingnon-existent without them, total individualism would not bebeneficial to it, and thus not for its members either. Dragon Rougecan be seen as a group of individuals, where the one strong thingkeeping them together is the discourse of individuality. The firstcorrespondence course states that the magicians of course“constantly help each other” but that it still is of crucial importancethat the magician “stands for himself and only after that collaborateswith the other magicians” (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 3). The magician107 “Eller måste och måste man, [...] en medlem till exempel som, inte gårnågon brevkurs och inte invigs utan bara är medlem, kan ju i stort sett [tro vadhan/hon vill] det har vi ju inte någon koll på det på samma sätt som ett politisktparti t.ex. de vet ju inte vad alla medlemmar har för inriktning jag menar dukan ju gå med i moderaterna om du vill fast du är kommunist t.ex. på sammasätt så skulle ju en satanist kunna gå med i Dragon Rouge och de betyder ju inteatt vi är satanister det skulle ju kunna komma med en frikyrklig person och dåär vi ju inte frikyrkliga utan om man säger dom yttre medlemmarna”."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"273CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGshould not be a burden on the other magicians or the order. On theDragon Rouge homepage, the individuality of dark magic is saidto be something completely different from the individuality ofmodernity, which is so prevalent in contemporary society.According to Dragon Rouge, “Materialism ... leads to a superficialand desperate form of individualism” which is characterised by“Ego trips and superficial satisfaction”, and which “becomesdestructive both for the individuals and their surrounding world”(Dragon Rouge 2004c). The individualism of modernity, and mostpeople, is thus no real individualism at all. According to DragonRouge, individualism for the dark magician is:an on-going transformation and development process that canlead the magician to a divine state and make the self break theboundaries of this life. The magician will realize that desperateegoism does not benefit his individualism, but thatindividualism is developed through an un-egoistic anddedicated fellowship with equals. (Dragon Rouge 2004c).What the real individuality of the dark magician consists of isdemonstrated in the ritual of the seven power-points, discussedbriefly in section 7.1.1 (the ritual is described in Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 10). The magician liberates him-/herself from the dependenceon factors that have controlled him/her earlier in his/her life, forexample, an important relationship. This liberation not only freespower for the magician, but he/she is additionally free to choosethe things important for him/her freely. In contrast to the precedingstate, when the magician was in the relationship because of his/her dependence on it, the magician is now in the relationshipbecause he/she chooses to be in it.The individuality discourse goes even deeper. It is stated inthe first correspondence course that “Reality is individual”108,meaning “That which one understands as reality is reality” 109(Dragon Rouge 1996/2: 4). In this way, the dark magician constructshis individual reality in the same way he constructs him-/herself,through the practice of magic.108 “Verkligheten är individuell”.109 “Det man uppfattar som verklighet är också verklighet”."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"274CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGThe individuality of Dragon Rouge is, like the discourse of self-evolvement (see section 7.1.2), something different from theindividuality of society in general. The dark magician goes throughtwo distinct processes of becoming an individual. The first is thestage which all humans go through, the process of becoming anindividual in relation to the mother. The second stage is the stagedark magicians can go through; they can, in and through their magicevolution, pass through another birth and “become individuals inrelation to existence” (Dragon Rouge 2004c). In short, the magicianbecomes a god, deifies him-/herself. Not only is the dark magicianan individual, for him/her all answers, morality and reality isindividual (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 3; 1996/2: 4).When discussing such a personal issue as sexuality, and itsinfluence on the practice of magic110, two female members of theorganization replied as follows:[Homo- bi- and heterosexuality in, magic, in Dragon Rouge? ... Doesit have any magical significance?]: Yes, it can probably have, mm,yes in the way that one that, or yes, for my own part at leastthat one is so, so open as one can be that I don’t have anyrestriction there either, if one like if one sees when one worksmagically with, some form of sex magic, I don’t have anyrestrictions so, whether it should be masculine or feminine,so in that way, one is probably more open [...

The Great Beast 666, Aleister Crowley (see section 2.1.3),was a strong advocator of sex magic. Ordo Templi Orientis, a magical order thatCrowley was linked to, had sex-magical initiations in its higher degrees. The 8thdegree involved an auto-sexmagical, masturbatory, initiation, and the 9th aheterosexual initiation. Crowley introduced an 11th degree which involved ananal-sexual initiation, which has often been described as a homosexual initiation.According to Henrik Bogdan, the initiation was not strictly homosexual, butopened up the possibility for male-male sexual initiation (Bogdan 2004: 30).Sex-polarity is an important factor in Wicca and many other neopagan andesoteric movements as well. See Bogdan 2003b: 218-233 for the importance ofsex-polarity in Wiccan initiation."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"275CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGno, not ceremonially at least, it is probably then if one does itprivately but nothing which is a part of, Dragon Rouge’s ofthe system system, no it’s not.

They statedthat each individual member chooses the forms of practice that suithim/her and his/her sexuality is of no importance for magicalprogress.When discussing early magic experiences and the possibilityof his siblings having had similar experiences, an advanced membersaid:that is very difficult to conclude as these kinds of experiences,are, I mean often very strictly personal, since they can beinterpreted in so many different ways, so that even if she hadthem her context, so to say, would not so to say, so to saylegitimize it, for her to talk about it.

This concerns active DragonRouge members as well. The order does not have a rulebook whichstates how experiences should be interpreted, although the commonthing after a meeting including practice is to sit down and discussthe experience with all other members present. In this setting thepersonal experience is brought to a social level and the meaning ofthe experience is negotiated with the others who had a similarexperience.7.1.4 Magic is DemandingThe Magic-is-demanding discourse centres on the idea of thepractice of magic as an activity which demands much of thepractitioner, physically as well as mentally. The discourse presents themagician as a balanced, capable and courageous individual, distinctfrom ordinary people, non-magicians. The dark magician gainscontrol over his life and situation, as well as knowledge, through“seeing under the surface”, but this art is a “difficult, demandingand dangerous” one (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 1). As stated in thefirst correspondence course in magic: “Magic is not for the weak”114,“It is tiring to become aware”115 and “It takes power to acquire powerand to have power”116 (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 2. See also DragonRouge 1996/3: 4). For most people, magic is far too demanding,and even the would-be magician should be dedicated to his/hercraft.113 In the Swedish language the English word ‘experience’ is conveyed bytwo different nouns, ‘erfarenhet’ and ‘upplevelse’, depending on the use andcontext of the word. ‘Erfarenhet’ (Erfahrung in German) is used in the contextof something which has given a person some kind of knowledge – as in thesentence “I have much experience of childcare”. ‘Upplevelse’ (Erlebnis inGerman) refers more to the emotional interpretation of an event, such as in thesentence “That car-crash last night was a terrible experience”. In the context ofmagic experience the simultaneous usage of both meanings could be argued.114 “Magi är inte för de svaga”.115 “Det är ansträngande att bli medveten”.116 “Det tar kraft att få kraft och att ha kraft”."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"277CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGThe magic of Dragon Rouge is frequently distinguished fromthe magic of white magicians and from religion.Religion, it’s like, describes a relation to, we’ll say, the hiddenforces that is more passive, that is to say we say a religiousperson, can be in contact with forces which are similar to theforces a magician is in contact with but, he has a more passiverelationship and he sees his life situation as controlled, bythese forces rather than that he himself can control the forces,one could say and as I would describe magic it’s that, one,confronts different forces and, different concepts and onegoes into this, in order to, discover one’s own, connection tothem, and in order to, be able to yes [control them].

He has worked hard to attain it and isworking hard to keep it. According to the Dragon Rouge position,dark magic is much more demanding than religion or white magic.Even white magic is demanding, and the white magician should bementally and physically fit, but the dark magician working withthe forces of chaos has to be even more stable (Dragon Rouge 1996/1: 3).That we step into the, unknown to illuminate it one couldsay and there we have the Lucifer, principle the one who,who, illuminates the unknown and who has, the power andit requires a lot of power and an energy and a lot of Will anda lot of, dedication to be able be able to walk this road, and itis probably this that many take for some form of elitism [...]What we have it’s, it’s, an initiatory system which must beable to offer a, like, a form of connecting thread on thisjourney because it can be dangerous perhaps to be thrown117 “Religion, det är liksom, beskriver en relation till, vi säger, de doldakrafterna som är lite mera passiv, alltså vi talar en religiös person, kan vara i kontaktmed krafter som är liknande de som en magiker är i kontakt men, han har ett merpassivt förhållande och han ser sin livssituation som snarare styrd, av de härkrafterna än att han själv kan styra krafterna, kan man säga och som jag skullebeskriva magi så är det att, man, konfronterar olika krafter och, olika begrepp ochman går in i det här, för att, upptäcka sin egen, koppling till dem, och för att, kunnaja [kontrollera dem]...”"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"278CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGinto this kind of development if one doesn’t know what oneis doing (IF mgt 2001/47118).What the magician does, is not something for the faint-hearted.

A group of Dragon Rouge magicians hadgathered in order to perform a joint astral journey. As the magiciansgathered on the astral plane, they discovered that one of them wasmissing. He had got lost on the astral plane and had ended up in aform of astral labyrinth from which he could not find his way out.It took the joint efforts and assumed risk of all the other magiciansin the group to help him find his way back. After waking up, he feltill and was disoriented. Several Dragon Rouge members have alsotold me how they have experienced nausea and almost physicalinjuries in Kundalini-meditations where the Kundalini-force hasbeen awakened all too rapidly and strongly (personalcorrespondence with Dragon Rouge members).The talking of the dangers of certain spiritual activities iscommon to many religious and spiritual traditions practisingextreme forms of mediations, rituals etc. In Tantric Yoga, the dangersof the tradition and the practices linked to the tradition are oftentreated at length. In Tantra, it is often stated that acts that wouldcondemn a normal man to eternal suffering in Hell mean salvationfor the Tantric adept. Tantra is said to be the path for Viras, heroes.(Woodroffe 1956: 112-117). Common to many expositions ofdifferent LHP traditions is that the tradition is a quick but extremelydangerous road to salvation (see Svoboda 1986: 12). The discourse120 “(Är magi något som ni, alltså inte skulle rekommendera för, allamänniskor?): Nej, jag skulle Nej inte göra det nej, inte den här formen av maginej”.

The discourse can also help to protect thepractitioner from the possible lack of understanding, and in manytimes probably even ridicule, from outsiders to the tradition.Through the magic-is-demanding discourse the individual can standon his/her own and gather strength from the fact that he/she hashad, and still has, the courage, conviction and insight to make moreout of his/her life than the common man, even if he does not haveany magic-performing colleague in his/her immediate physicalvicinity to draw support from.The discourse of magic-as-demanding also portrays the darkmagician as an elite a some sort. I refer to the discussion on thesubject in section 3.1.7.1.5 NatureThe concept of correspondences, the idea that everything in thecosmos is interlinked in someway and that everything you do affectssomething else as well, is, as a rule, an important aspect of esotericworldviews. Nature is something which is often viewed as sacredin a magic reality, and as a key to the mysteries of the universe.This is apparent particularly in contemporary esoteric spiritualityand neopaganism. The critique of monotheistic religion and itsdevaluation of nature, is a key factor in the Dragon Rouge naturediscourse.... there was a harmony somewhere that one did not destroynature unnecessarily for example, but then, when this started,in and with Christianity, all forms of nature, worship likethis, it is sort of like this, it’s a miscreant it’s idol-worship ...sure I mean in for example Sweden this form of earth-religioncontinued for a very long time there was this with instead ofcalling for Odin one called for Jesus but it was exactly thesame force that came.

Instead of a dualistic monotheistic worldview, Dragon Rougeadheres to a monistic worldview where “there are connectionsbetween everything” and “where the divine light is [still] presentin man” (Dragon Rouge 2004c). Nature is thus living and divine.Dragon Rouge is opposed to the materialistic notion which,according to Dragon Rouge, stipulates that “nature and the animalsare made for man to use” and that “Man can do what he likes withanimals and nature” (Dragon Rouge 2004c). Another resultexperienced with materialistic ideology is that man himself becomesa “soulless organism being compared to cars or computers” (DragonRouge 2004c). This view of man, animals and nature naturally limitsman’s possibility to reach beyond his limitations and fulfil hispotential.As everything is connected, harming nature would be harmingoneself. Man should respect the divine nature and all parts of it.Many Dragon Rouge members are vegetarian or even vegan, oftenbecause of a respect for animals, which in itself is a magic act. It isstated on the Dragon Rouge homepage that “Man can become godby entering outside the humans limits and recognizing theimportance of the beast” (Dragon Rouge 2004c). The magician thusfrees him-/herself from the ideology of materialism and experienceshim-/herself as a part of the divine nature. In realizing his/herconnection to everything else the magician has a great tool for magicdevelopment.Nature is not just something outside oneself, outside the urbanenvironment; nature is inside the magician.What one as a dark magician does, is to, one starts to, animatenature again through experiences we say that one one, wework with the Kundalini which is the life-force which is,incorporated in the body and it’s awakened then, throughkristendomen så ’äh’ men vad då, all form av natur, dyrkan såhär, det är liksomså här, det är en avart det är avgudadyrkan ... visst jag menar till exempel iSverige fortsatte ju den här typen av jordreligion väldigt länge det fanns ju dethär istället för att kanske ropa på Oden så ropade man på Jesus men det varprecis samma kraft som kom”."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"283CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGdifferent channels and [illegible word] and when this force isawakened then one can more easily have magical experiencesand and, and all of this, and this means that, one gets a slightlydifferent, different view of things suddenly the trees aren’tpieces of wood but can they again become cosmic. (IF mgt2001/47122).Nature, and the care of everything living, is important as it all is apart of the magician. What the magician does, reflects upon him/her, and therefore it would not be proper for him/her to dodestructive things to nature, magically or otherwise. As nature is apowerful and important force for the magician, it would be plainstupid for him/her to disturb or destroy it unwarrantedly.Yes for me it’s self-evident that everything, everything islinked, everything belongs together everything I do affectssomebody else, both humans and animals and the wholeplanet, so to me it’s really important that I do not, destroy,unnecessarily, I do as much as I can in order to like, takecare of everything living, this I feel is strongly connected tomagic, exactly because one is aware of I mean otherwise onewouldn’t, I mean if one did not, believe that everything waslinked then one wouldn’t even be a magician. (IF mgt2001/55123).Much Dragon Rouge magic practice employs nature in one form oranother. In the Dragon Rouge correspondence course in magic, theadept is encouraged to write down a list of what he/she wishes to122 “Vad man som mörkmagiker gör, är väl att, man börjar, besjäla naturenigen genom upplevelser vi säger att man man, vi jobbar ju med kundalinin somär livskraften som finns, förborgad i kroppen och den väcks upp då, genomolika, kanaler och [otydligt ord] och när den här kraften är uppväckt då så kanman ju lättare, få magiska upplevelser och och, och det hela, och det innebär juatt, man får ju en lite annan, annan syn på saker helt plötsligt så är inte trädenträdbitar utan det här är de kan igen bli kosmiska”.123 “Jo för mig är de självklart att allt, allt hänger ihop, allt hör ihop alltsom jag gör påverkar någon annan, både människor och djur och hela planeten,så att för mig är det jätteviktigt, och självklart att jag inte, förstör, i onödan, jaggör så mycket jag kan för att liksom, ta vara på allt levande, det tycker jaghänger ihop jättemycket med magi, just eftersom man är medveten om alltsåannars skulle man ju inte, alltså om man inte, trodde att allting hängde ihop dåskulle man ju inte ens vara magiker”."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"284CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGaccomplish in his life and to bury that piece of paper in the soil orin a natural body of water, such as in a natural pond (Dragon Rouge1996/1: 15). Although not stated explicitly, the idea seems to bethat nature, through the soil or the natural water, imbues themagician with power in order to effect the realization of the wisheson his/her list. A similar strategy is described in the ritual of creatinga ‘soul-mirror’ (described in section 7.1.2), in which the magician istold to “plant” (note the choice of word, my translation from theSwedish “plantera”) a list of his/her character traits considered goodin a place in nature which feels personal for the magician (DragonRouge 1996/3: 1). Powerful magic items can be found when“strolling in the forest” (1996/3: 7).When using living parts of nature, such as cutting a branch ofa living tree as opposed to using a fallen branch, in magic rituals,the magician should “ask the living natural object for permission”before doing so (Dragon Rouge 1996/5: 9). Hurting nature is thusnot something which is totally out of the question as long as themagician recognises nature as alive and pays it due respect. Indiscussing witchcraft, as a distinct form of dark magic, nature isoften said to be the best teacher the witch and warlock can have. Itis said that the best places to come into contact with the truly magicalforces are in nature untouched by human hands (Dragon Rouge2001j/1: 5-6). The structured existence and surroundings of the city,human civilization, are said to complicate and hinder the magicianin his/her magic development (Dragon Rouge 1996/2: 5). The cityis the pivotal creation of human civilization and represents, as such,the forces of order and structure, the light forces of existence. Nature,on the other hand, represents primordial chaos and the dark forcesof dissolution and creation. The forces of order are passive andstable, and cause this reaction in humans as well, whereas the forcesof chaos are active and instable, and thus support and strengthenthe creative and active agency in man.The nature discourse partly corresponds with elements one andtwo in Faivre’s intrinsic characteristics of esotericism, the notion ofcorrespondences and the idea of a living nature (Faivre 1994: 10-12). The nature discourse of Dragon Rouge does, however,incorporate a form of ecological thinking and action, possiblethrough, but not required in either, the notion of correspondences"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"285CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGor the notion of a living nature. This form of ecological thinking isvery common in neopaganism and in much of the ‘New Age’ milieu(see Harvey 1997: 126-142; York 1995: 166).7.1.6 Women’s RightsThe women’s rights discourse is most prominent among the femalemembers of the order, but is also more indirectly produced in theteachings of the order. Female deities and demonesses, such as Kali,Hel and Lilith, are of special importance in rituals and texts. Maledeities play a much less visible role. On an organizational plane,the order has a women’s ritual group. The group is not strictlylimited to female magicians, although it focuses on feminine aspectsof magic and at the time of writing consisted of only femalemagicians (see section 5.1.1 for an example of the Women’s Circle’smagic work). A female member active in the formation of thewomen’s group has the following to say about the group:For the order itself, it [the women’s group] is very importantbecause, if it would only be, men, who hold the threads allthe time things will obviously take a special direction. So Ithink that it is very important and I know that, Thomas, andthe others also feel that it is important. (IF mgt 2001/57124).The leading members of the order are also careful to point out thatthe percentage of female members in the order is high (see alsoDragon Rouge 1996/1: 7; 2004b).[The position of woman and man in Dragon Rouge?]: There’sNo, I mean there’s no difference we’re humans we’re magicalcreatures I’m of the opinion that it really feels like we’vemoved beyond those, there aren’t any gender roles in DR,it is, I’ve never felt that it’s of any significance that I’ve124 För orden i sig så, är den [kvinnogruppen] jätteviktig för att alltså, omdet bara skulle vara, män, som håller i saker hela tiden det får ju en speciellriktning självklart så blir det ju så. Så att, jag tycker att det är jätteviktigt och jagvet att, Thomas, och de andra tycker också att det är viktigt."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"286CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGbeen treated, in any other way because I am, a woman butthen again we are quite untypical also, I mean purely like,if one is to be superficial then we’re very untypical, whenit comes to purely normal I mean it is the girls who havedriver’s licences and fix the cars and it’s the boys who sitand, sit at home and, never having done military service(laughter) no exactly no one has done military service andit is that is to say we are very untypical so also so that we,we’ve probably moved beyond at least these traditional,gender roles. (IF mgt 2001/55125).The above excerpt is the response from two female members ofDragon Rouge concerning the position and role of women in theorganization. As one can see, the members are careful to give theimage of women in the organization having an important role andemphasize this through inverting the traditional gender roles ofmen and women. It is the women who are technologically capableand active, and it is the men who have taken on a more femalepassive role. The point is not to exhibit the male magicians as lazyand incompetent, but rather to stress the fact that the femalemagicians have a strong standing in the organization. The excerptalso employs the discourse of individuality, in stating that themembers of Dragon Rouge are untypical. The magicians of DragonRouge create their own roles and are not bound to traditional genderroles.In practical matters the order operates with non-essential gen-der, the case seems, however, to be different in certain practices.125 “[Mannens o kvinnans ställning i Dragon Rouge?]: det finns Nej, alltså detär ingen skillnad vi är människor vi är magiska varelser liksom jag tycker attdet känns faktiskt väldigt mycket som att man har gått bortom de där, detfinns inte nåra könsroller i dr, det är, jag har aldrig känt det att det är någonbetydelse att jag har blivit behandlad, på något annat vis för att jag är, kvinnamen sen så är vi ganska otypiska också, alltså rent sådär, om man nu ska varaytlig så är vi väldigt otypiska, vad det gäller, rent vanliga alltså typ det ärtjejerna som har körkort och lagar bilarna och det är killarna som sitter och,sitter hemma och, aldrig har gjort lumpen (skratt) nej precis ingen har gjortlumpen och det är alltså vi är väldigt otypiska så också så att vi, vi har noggått bortom i alla fall de här traditionella, könsrollerna”. This was an interviewwith two respondents. The question in parenthesis and italics was asked by meand the two respondents are separated with the answers by respondent numbertwo being in bold font."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"287CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGFor example, in presentation of the women’s group’s work at theannual meeting of 2004 (see section 5.1.1) it was said that womenchannel the feminine forces differently from men, in the ceremo-nial opening of lodge Sinistra (see section 5.1.3) two female mem-bers had a specific ritual function, in the course on ceremonial magic(see section 5.1.2) the participants were divided into groups accord-ing to gender, and in the initiation into the second degree of theorder (see section 5.1.4) the male officials played traditionally maleroles. A division is also made into the feminine and the masculine,although these forces are thought to exist in both men and women.Obviously the male-female dichotomy does play some part inthe Dragon Rouge context. Whether the dichotomy is based on apsychological notion, that women are more easily associated withthe feminine and men with the masculine – both for the person tak-ing on the role and for the other persons participating, or on a meta-physical level, where women and men are viewed as actually em-bodying actual feminine and masculine forces, is difficult to an-swer. In the light of Dragon Rouge discursive practices and phi-losophies I deem the first interpretation to be more likely, althoughthis probably varies among individual practitioners. The order does,however, operate on a more gender-de-essentialized level than, forexample, Gardnerian Wicca. In the above examples from theethnographies, the division into males and females was not abso-lutely necessary. In the pragmatic nature of the order the ritualsand ceremonies could have been performed equally well even ifthere had been only men or only women attending.The relative lack of women in the Inner Circles of Dragon Rougedoes, however, show that the women’s rights discourse need nothave practical consequences to its fullest suggested degree.In the official Dragon Rouge material, the women’s rightsdiscourse rears its head most clearly in the critique of dominantcontemporary religion and values. In stating what terrible atrocitiesthe all-powerful Christian monotheistic God is involved inaccording to the Bible, the repression of women is specificallymentioned, together with genocide (Dragon Rouge 2004c). The otheracts are lumped together as “most thinkable atrocities” (DragonRouge 2004c).The reason for the down-valuation of women andthe feminine is said to be the fact that “The monotheistic god is"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"288CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGgenerally always a man” and that this, in turn, has resulted in thedefining of women as the evil and dangerous Other (Dragon Rouge2004c). When asked about her view on Christianity, a femalemember responded: “I don’t like Christianity, because, it is a, denialof femininity on the whole” (IF mgt 2001/58126). Moslem religionand culture is criticised for being oppressive and violent towardswomen, and the same is said about medieval Christian religion andculture (Dragon Rouge 2001j/3: 3; 2004c).The women’s rights discourse has to be understood in the contextof contemporary Swedish society in which the order was born anddeveloped. The idea of equality between the sexes is a very importantand normative guideline in Swedish society. As in all of contemporaryWestern society, the aspiration in Sweden has since the middle of thetwentieth century been to forge a society where individuals of bothsexes have equal opportunities and possibilities. The political powershave attempted to effect this process through law and education. TheScandinavian societies have been forerunners in the ideology ofequality, and Sweden has taken an especially active role in the process.This is not to say that the ideology has had all the desired effects, orthat it in itself does not fall short in some way. Even in Swedish society,women are generally in a less advantageous position than men, andlack the power status that men have in their capacity as men. As DragonRouge is a part of Swedish society and adheres to many of thedominating ideas of Western society, even though it still criticises someof the key dogmas of the secular west – as I have shown earlier in thistext, the order, quite naturally, also agrees with the ideology of equalitybetween the sexes. In this ideology no human should have his or herpossibilities or rights decreased (or increased for that matter) becauseof their sex.In addition to this, the discourse of women’s rights is to beunderstood in the context of the appraisal of the feminine aspectsof the divine, which is of such great importance in Dragon Rouge.As shown in section 4.1.2, the usage of female symbolism in dealingwith the divine is a key concept in Left Hand Path traditions. Thefeminine represents the dark and hidden aspects of reality, whereas126 “Jag tycker inte om kristendomen, eftersom, det är ett, förnekande avkvinnlighet överhuvudtaget”."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"289CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGthe masculine represents the light and obtrusive forces. In the secondcorrespondence course in magic, the woman is said to “representthe gate to the dimensions of magic” (Dragon Rouge 2001j/3: 3127).“She is Mother Earth and through her womb life is born and dies.[...] She is the underworld and the mother of all life.” (Dragon Rouge2001j/3: 3128). The physical human female represents the actualfeminine forces of existence and, as such, repressing her would bea symbolic act of repressing the feminine forces, and would thushinder the magician in his magic development. In Tantrism onecan find several good examples of how women are praised, andeven worshipped, as representatives of Shakti. One example is Yoni-Puja, in which a human woman and especially her genitals areworshipped (see Gröndahl 2000: 63; Walker 1982: 59).Reverence for the feminine divine, with special attention beinggiven to the needs of female members, is typical of neopaganmovements. In the early fall of 2004, Dragon Rouge was defined asa feminist magic order on an online-encyclopaedia website. Therewas some discussion on the Dragon Rouge members’ board aboutthis identification, most of which took the slightly amused stance“now we have been identified with every single existing politicalideology”. As the order wishes to stay independent from any specificpolitical ideology or movement, and feminism is generallyconsidered as such, the identification was not popular and the texton the encyclopaedia website was changed.127 “...representerar porten till magins dimensioner.”.128 “Hon är Moder Jord och genom henne föds och dör livet. [...] Hon ärdödsriket och modern till allt liv.”."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"290CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKING7.2 The Web of DiscoursesAll of the above-mentioned discourses are deeply interwoven andexist in a dialogical relation to each other. For example, the magic-is-all-encompassing and the nature discourses are deeply coexistentand build on and support each other. This same relation can beseen between the nature and the women’s rights discourses, betweenthe self-evolvement and the magic-is-all-encompassing discourses,the women’s rights and the individuality discourses, and so on.The prerequisites of a discourse can be seen in one or many of theother discourses and in this way the discursive complex is builtinto a coherent whole. I call this condition and process of coexistenceand interdependency the web of discourses. Another suitablemetaphor is that of a tunnel-system. A system of tunnels consists ofseveral tunnels which intersect at various points along theirindividual paths. Although each tunnel is a separate whole, thereis no tunnel-system without the intersecting of the tunnels. In theweb-metaphor, each of the threads of the web are necessary inconstructing the web, as well as in keeping it functional.In the Dragon Rouge context, the nature and women’s rightsdiscourses are closely connected. As the feminine aspects of thedivine, of existence and of cosmos/chaos are the ones focused upon,and viewed as inherent in nature, interlinking quite naturally occurs.Feminine magic powers and female divinities are considered to bemore representative of the dark and unknown forces which theDragon Rouge magicians strive to reach, and nature in itself is wherethese forces are to be found. To quote passages from the firstcorrespondence course in magic: “[The woman] represent[s] the gateto the dimensions of magic” and is “Mother Earth” through whose“womb life is born and dies” and who is furthermore “theunderworld and the mother of all life” (Dragon Rouge 1996/3: 3).Woman and nature are quite obviously closely connected, even tothe extent of existing within each other. With this in mind, both thewomen’s rights discourse and the nature discourse can be moreeasily understood, and become more coherent and viable. Withinthe nature discourse, nature is seen as the source of magic, the livingthing from which the magician draws his/her power and through"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"291CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGwhich the magician can access as well as strengthen the powersand forces inherent within him-/herself. Nature gains a twofoldvalue. As the source of magic forces, nature is quite obviouslyimportant for the magician and should thus be preserved andprotected. As a living entity, nature should gain the same rights asany other living entity, and included in this view is the movingaway from the human being as a rightly privileged organism. Thewoman, as a part of all of this, is seen in a different light thantraditionally and gains a status as an equal to her fellow man. Therecognition of the relative disadvantages for the female sex cravesconscious and active action in order to counteract thesedisadvantages.Similarly to the nature and the women’s rights discourses, thediscourses of magic-as all-encompassing and nature are closelylinked, perhaps even more closely than the aforementioneddiscourses. In a large part, the esteem for nature stems from theidea of the interlinkage of everything, which is the key concept ofthe magic-is-all-encompassing discourse. I will return to aninterview excerpt introduced in section 7.1.5 in order to demonstratethis more clearly.Yes for me it is self-evident that everything, everything islinked, everything belongs together everything I do affectssomebody else, both humans and animals and the wholeplanet, so to me it is really important that I do not, destroy,unnecessarily, I do as much as I can in order to like, takecare of everything living, this I feel is strongly connected tomagic, exactly because one is aware of I mean otherwise onewouldn’t, I mean if one did not, believe that everything waslinked then one wouldn’t even be a magician. (IF mgt2001/55129).129 “Jo för mig är det självklart att allt, allt hänger ihop, allt hör ihop alltsom jag gör påverkar någon annan, både människor och djur och hela planeten,så att för mig är det jätteviktigt, och självklart att jag inte, förstör, i onödan, jaggör så mycket jag kan för att liksom, ta vara på allt levande, det tycker jaghänger ihop jättemycket med magi, just eftersom man är medveten om alltsåannars skulle man ju inte, alltså om man inte, trodde att allting hängde ihop dåskulle man ju inte ens vara magiker”."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"292CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGAs we can see, the high valuation of nature stems directly from theidea of the interconnectedness of all and everything. In this view,the human being steps down from the god-given position of absoluteruler of things material, and takes up residence as a part ofeverything else. The divine essence of nature is recognized andreasserted, as shown in earlier quotations in section 7.1.5. Includedin the magic-is-all-encompassing discourse is the truer and moretotal position of dark magic, in comparison to religion and “white”spirituality – even nature-based such like Wicca, as advocators ofthe total unity of everything. It is felt that “white spirituality”disregards the dark as a part of the totality, and falsely attributelighter aspects to nature. As a result, dark magic becomes the morefunctional advocator of the protection of nature as well, althoughthis is not directly stated in any of my source material.As said earlier, the magic-is-demanding discourse representsthe magician as a person actively in control of his/her own life anddestiny. The way to achieve this control is through the identificationof the interconnectedness of everything, which is the tenet of themagic-is-all-encompassing discourse.That we step into the, unknown to illuminate it one couldsay and there we have the Lucifer, principle the one who,who, illuminates the unknown and who has, the power andit requires a lot of power and an energy and a lot of Will anda lot of, dedication to be able be able to walk this road. (IFmgt 2001/47130).This quotation, first presented in section 7.1.4, shows the connectionbetween the two aforementioned discourses. Everything isconnected, it is the magician’s task to show the interconnections –mainly for him-/herself in order to progress in magic, and thispursuit is potentially dangerous for, and demanding of, the would-be magician. Seeing the interconnectedness of everything, fully –also including the dark aspects regularly neglected by white130 “Att vi går in i det, okända för att belysa det kan man säga och där harvi ju Lucifer, principen den som, som, belyser det okända och den som har,liksom den kraften och det krävs ju en väldig kraft och en energi och en väldigvilja och ett väldigt, liksom dedikation för att kunna kunna gå den här vägen”."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"293CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGmagicians, means experiencing them. Experiencing the dark isdangerous, demanding and exerting, partly due to inherentpsychological defence mechanisms, and partly due to the culturaland religious expulsion of these aspects into a dark void.The self-evolvement and the individuality discourses areinterconnected at the most basic level. The ultimate goal with thedark magic of Dragon Rouge is, as stated earlier, the attainment ofgod-like status for the magician. God-like status is signified by themagician identifying, communicating with and strengthening his/her core person, talked of as the Inner or True Self/Will etc., in theend becoming a creator of his/her own reality. In the process ofpersonal evolution, the magician is indeed obliged to nurture his/her individuality. As noted in section 7.1.3, the Dragon Rougediscourse of individuality does not specifically separate theindividual and the collective, but rather the two of them – and thewell-being of the two - are dependent on each other. In the followinginterview excerpt, presented earlier in section 7.1.3, the intermixingof the two discourses becomes clear.[Homo- bi- and heterosexuality in, magic, in Dragon Rouge? ... Doesit have any magical significance?]: Yes, it can probably have, mm,yes in the way that one that, or yes, for my own part at leastthat one is so, so open as one can be that I don’t have anyrestriction there either, if one like if one sees when one worksmagically with, some form of sex magic, I don’t have anyrestrictions like that, whether it should be masculine orfeminine, so in that way, one is probably more open. (IF mgt2001/55131).The intimate question of sexual orientation becomes the pivotalpoint of the nurturing of the person’s individuality, in an obvious131 “[Homo- bi- och heterosexualitet i, magi, i Dragon Rouge? ...

Although a key notion in theindividuality discourse is the freedom of the individual to makehis/her own choices, the interlinkage of the discourse with that ofpersonal evolution highlights a perhaps more basic, and arguablymore magically oriented, point in the discourse. The individualfreedom is not only, and perhaps not primarily, for the mundanefreedom of choice but serves higher purposes in the process ofbecoming a god.In addition to the self-evolvement discourse, the individualitydiscourse is also closely linked to the discourse of women’s rights.The individuality discourse entails the freedom and, as statedearlier, the outright responsibility of the individual magician to beand become what he/she is. The women’s rights discourse, on theother hand, maintains the tenet of the female members to have thefreedom to stay clear of constricting gender roles. The two discoursesoperate together quite easily. As the quotation below shows, thetwo discourses tend to coexist, lending authority and credibility toeach other.I’m of the opinion that it really feels like we’ve moved beyondthose, there aren’t any gender roles in DR, it is, I’ve neverfelt that it’s of any significance that I’ve been treated, in anyother way because I am, a woman but then again we are quiteuntypical too [...] we’ve probably moved beyond at leastthese traditional, gender roles. (IF mgt 2001/55132).The absence of traditional gender roles in Dragon Rouge is notsimply a worldly and political undertaking, but goes much deeperin the task of stressing the individual freedom of the magician togo beyond traditional gender roles. The Dragon Rouge magiciansare depicted as untypical, and thus exceptional and enlightened132 “jag tycker att det känns faktiskt väldigt mycket som att man har gåttbortom det där, det finns inte nåra könsroller i dr, det är, jag har aldrig käntdet att det är någon betydelse att jag har blivit behandlad, på något annat visför att jag är, kvinna men sen så är vi ganska otypiska också [...] vi har noggått bortom i alla fall de här traditionella, könsrollerna”.

The excerpt playson the discourse of self-evolvement as well, in stressing the ‘moving-away’ from traditional gender roles. Gender roles are not mentionedas something that has always been viewed as false in the order, butrather as something which has been forsaken in the process of magic,and its inevitable personal, development. The women’s rights andthe individuality discourses could, however, come to some sort ofclash concerning the extreme importance of female symbolism andfemale deities and demonesses in the Dragon Rouge context.Hypothetically, the focus on femininity could result in anessentialization of the feminine, with an accompanyingessentialization of the femininity of the female members. I havenot, however, noticed any development in this direction and donot consider it very likely to occur, especially in view of the critiqueof the experienced ‘white’ spirituality-gender dichotomy, asexpressed by various Dragon Rouge members.The self-evolvement and the magic-is-demanding discoursesare very strongly associated. Dark magic is seen as the ultimatepath to godhood and, although not clearly stated in the material Ihave access to, basically the only really effective way of gainingit133. The magic-is-demanding discourse functions partly as a formof explanatory device. If dark magic is the best way to attain thegoals sought, something I imagine most spiritual persons wouldargue of the path they have taken – if not universally then at leastfor themselves, then why is it not more popular than it is? Theanswer comes from the great demands and possible dangers whichthis effective means of spiritual progress places on its practitioner.The interview segment below highlights this quite clearly.To develop oneself if we say it like that, to become a more, amore enlightened, and to be able to have access to more energyto, really go into the deep part of oneself, it is certainly133 Dragon Rouge does not view other spiritual paths as truly inferior, butsimply notes the different goals of other paths. For example, the goal oftraditional qabalah is not personal godhood, but rather union with the godhead.The critique is mostly directed at what are viewed as undue fear of and untenablemoral judgments on dark magic practice and dark magic forces."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"296CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGsomething really demanding and it is not something whichgives immediate rewards. (IF mgt 2001/47134).The process of personal evolution through magic is difficult at times,requiring sacrifices and total devotion of the practitioner. Althoughthe rewards are not immediately experienced, the magician willprogress and become a more harmonious person, which in turn, asbecomes clear later in the interview, reflects back on the magician’ssurroundings.The magic-is-all-encompassing discourse, in the specific senseof dark magic as all-encompassing, and the self-evolvementdiscourse support each other as well. In the excerpt below, a DragonRouge member discusses the difference in the view on natural lawsbetween white and dark magicians....there are obviously laws but the dark magician and the lightmagician view these laws differently a light magician sees theselaws as, I mean the laws, start out from some kind of reason Imean that that which for the human reason seem good, are thelaws this classic that the Greek philosophers, some kind of, abit Platonic I don’t know, but the dark magician, perhaps divesdeeper, and sees so to say tries to see what it is that actuallycontrols I mean what do the actual natural laws look like. (IFmgt 2001/47135).Dark magic is more truly all-encompassing as it dives deeper intothe structure of existence. The process of dark magical explorationis a process of personal evolution, since the gaining of insight takesplace on a cosmic level as well as a personal level. Magic forces and134 “Att utveckla sig själv om vi säger, till att bli en, en mera upplyst, ochkunna liksom ha tillgång till mera energi att, liksom gå verkligen på djupet isig själv, det är ju något som är väldigt krävande och det är inget som geromedelbar vinning”.135 “...det finns självklart lagar men den mörka magikern och den ljusamagikern ser på de här lagarna annorlunda en ljus magiker ser på att de härlagarna är, alltså lagarna, utgår oftast från någon slags förnuft alltså det detsom för det mänskliga förnuftet verkar bra, det är lagarna det här klassiskasom de grekiska filosoferna, något såhär, någon sorts, lite platonskt jag vet inte,men men alltså en mörkmagiker, kanske går djupare, och ser liksom försökerse vad egentligen är det som som styr alltså hur ser de här egentliga naturlagarnaut”."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"297CHAPTER 7 - DRAGON ROUGE AND MEANING MAKINGthe practice of the art infuse every aspect of the magician’s personand existence. The practice of magic without the accompanyingpersonal evolution is pointless and, one could argue from thestandpoint of the above discourses, not real magic at all.I have not treated every possible interlinkage between thediscourses in the above discussion. Important to note, however, isthat even those discourses which are not directly connected arelinked through the mediating agency of another discourse. The pointof this section has not been to refute the claims made by themagicians of Dragon Rouge, and I fail to see any academic relevancein such an approach. What I have set out to do is to show how thedifferent discourses encircling and permeating the phenomenon ofmagic practice in the Dragon Rouge context are employed insupporting each other, thus making the field of magic practiceinherently solid in communicating it to oneself, other magiciansand outsiders. Discursive practices which rhetorically reinforcedifferent areas of human understandings of the world and events,occur constantly in every field of human communication, rangingfrom children in the playground arguing who is the strongest comicbook superhero, through scientific research to political practice ona global level (see Potter 1996)."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"299CHAPTER 8 - FINALEPart IV – Finale8.1 SummaryChapter one of the present study was an introductory sectionfocusing on background factors pertaining to the study. I presentedthe outlining purpose of the work as an effort to understand themagic order Dragon Rouge, and to put it into the context of thealternative spiritual milieu. The guiding questions for me were‘What is Dragon Rouge?’, ‘How does Dragon Rouge operate andfunction?’ and ‘What is specific to Dragon Rouge and in what waydoes this order fit into the contemporary Western alternativespiritual milieu?’. As the subject area is fairly unknown in theacademy136, not to mention virtually quite unstudied, I alsopresented key terms and concepts used in the Left Hand Pathtradition to which Dragon Rouge belongs.My research is based on primary source material collected bymyself. During 2001-2004, I carried out field study in the order,including participant observation. I also completed qualitativeinterviews with active members of the order. These two materialsconstitute my main source material, but I also handed outquestionnaires to members, collected official member’s material thatthe order distributes, and acquired literature connected to the order.Apart from the introduction and the conclusion, the bulk of mythesis is divided into two distinct main sections. The first of these,part two, consisting of chapters 2 to 5, is mainly a historical-descriptive account of Dragon Rouge and the background contextof Western esotericism.Esotericism has a long and profound history in the Westernworld, with notions and currents that surfaced in the milieu fromthe early first millennium onwards having a continued influencein later esotericism. Greatly influential notions and currents are,136 One work dealing with spirituality which could be defined as belongingto the Left Hand Path is Justin Woodman’s unpublished PhD thesis, Modernity,Selfhood and the Demonic: Anthropological Perspectives on “Chaos Magick” in theUnited Kingdom (Woodman 2004)."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"300CHAPTER 8 - FINALEfor example, alchemy, which articulated the rhetorical language ofWestern esotericism and introduced the concept of transmutation,and qabalah, Jewish mystic speculation on the nature of theGodhead. Esotericism, in the current academic understanding ofthe term, came into existence in the renaissance, when earlier esotericelements where fitted into a ‘common frame of mind’.Of importance to 20th century neopaganism in particular, is thechanging view of nature, which began to take hold with the writingsof 16th century esotericists such as Paracelsus. It was stipulated thatnature was part of the divine, and not something separate from it.This was to be even more strongly articulated in the Naturphilosophieof Romanticism. Rosicrucianism became an esoteric trend in the17th century, and countless initiatory orders were founded,Freemasonry being the most influential of these.The enlightenment, and the ideologies of reason and rationalityit introduced, introduced trouble for both traditional religion andesoteric worldviews. With increasing secularization the esotericworldviews adapted to the rational-scientific frame of mind, andthe idea of correspondences was generally more or less transformedinto a causality-based approach.With European expansion into Africa and Asia, inspiration foresoteric spirituality began to be sought outside the home ground ofEurope. Egypt was the focus of 18th century esotericism, whereasIndia was the focus of the 19th century. The Theosophical Society,founded in 1875, introduced concepts such as the chakras andreincarnation to the Westerners, and Aleister Crowley brought Yogaand Tantrism to the west in the early 20th century. Crowley alsoestablished the True Will as the prime foundation of a magician’spower, and the Theosophical Society introduced new forms ofspiritual practice and the eclecticism which came to rule the esotericmilieu in the 20th century. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,founded in 1888, modelled its initiatory system on the qabalistictree of life, and this came to have a huge influence on later magicorders. The Golden Dawn was also the generator of many figuresimportant for the magical community. One of these was theaforementioned Aleister Crowley.The fascination with pre-Christian religion and culture, whichhad been expressed with increasing intensity from the beginning"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"301CHAPTER 8 - FINALEof the 20th century, was put into practice in modern-day forms ofspirituality from the 1950s onward. Gerald Gardner founded Wicca,as the first true neopagan religion, based on a fictive account of apre-Christian witch cult. Orders of Druids, Nordic Asatrúorganizations and feminist Goddess Worshippers, were soon tofollow. Reverence of nature and the conceptual fusion of body andsoul were prime foundations, and academic research on tribalreligion became the inspiration for neoshaman practices (see, forexample, Svanberg 2003).The 1960s counterculture ushered a ‘New Age’ in spirituality.Time-proven esoteric elements were mixed with non-Europeancomponents in the eclectic example set by the Theosophical Society.The focus was on the self and personal evolution, instead of on adistant divinity, as in 18th century – and earlier esotericism. The1980s saw a mass-popularization of this ‘New Age’ spirituality, andterms such as charkas, crystals and healing became almosthousehold words.The alternative spiritual milieu of Sweden and Stockholm isbroad and varied. The country exhibits esoteric movements rangingfrom Spiritualist organizations, through neopagan and ‘New Age’–groups, to initiatory magic orders such as Ordo Templi Orientis andthe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.In section 2, I also briefly discussed postmodernity,globalization, secularization and identity, and assessed the effectof these social factors’ on religion and spirituality.Chapters 3 to 5 dealt with Dragon Rouge from the point ofview of the order’s philosophical tenets, organization and praxis.The principal term used in Dragon Rouge to describe the system ofthought and practice is dark magic. The term signals the explorationof the dark and unknown, both in the self and in existence. Theultimate goal of the Dragon Rouge magician is to become a creator,in contrast to a Right Hand Path-approach in which the goal is tobecome one with God. In the process of magic progress, theindividual dark magician transmutes his/her core being into a moreand more aware and godlike state.The three basic principles of draconian magic (which is anotherterm used in defining the philosophy of the order), vision, powerand action, provide the guiding line for the magicians of Dragon"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"302CHAPTER 8 - FINALERouge. The magician perceives the totality of existence andvisualizes what he/she wants to occur. Through this perception oftotality, and through different magic practices, the magician thengains power to express his/her Will. Action is the above put intopractice, and is the manifestation of magic.As it is a Left Hand Path order, feminine symbolism is of graveimportance to Dragon Rouge. It is felt that mainstream religion haspushed the feminine forces of existence into the dark and focusedunhealthily only on the light male forces. As in mainstream religionand culture, nature is linked to femininity, although the differencehere is that nature is seen to have a value in itself – not only as ameans to an end.According to Dragon Rouge, morality is a key point for thedark magician, although not as collective ethical norms. In theorder’s view, the dark magician is required to explore his/her self,and consciously develop a morality which suits the individualmagician. Accordingly morality is seen as something that cannotbe codified in a rule-governed system, in which each situation thatarises has a clear-cut and definite answer. The magician must,however, take absolute responsibility for his/her actions andchoices, as this entails the taking charge of one’s own destiny.The overall attitude towards Christianity is generally negativein Dragon Rouge, as is the case in much of contemporary alternativespirituality. Christianity is seen as being responsible for a host ofatrocities, such as the subjugation of women and the abuse of nature.Individual Christians are not, however, scorned in any way, and itis stated that Christians are welcome to join the order, although thecommon view is that the life-philosophies and goals of the twospiritualities would probably be an ill match.Dragon Rouge was founded in 1990, and is thus a relativelyyoung organization. The key founding figure is Thomas Karlsson,who felt that existing esoteric groups and movements could notprovide what he sought. In the mid 1990s Dragon Rouge received agreat deal of, mostly negative, mass media attention. The publicityreceived led to the order attracting many new members. This, inturn, led to administrational changes in the order. Dragon Rougehas, at the time of writing, about 250 members, of whom about half"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"303CHAPTER 8 - FINALEare located outside Sweden. According to the order, about half ofthe members are female.Beside the mother-organization in Stockholm, Dragon Rougeis organized in a number of lodges and ritual groups. Lodges, atthe time of writing located in Sweden, Germany, Italy and Poland,are sanctioned by the mother-organization to work officially withthe Dragon Rouge material and magic-system. Ritual groups aregroups of members working with Dragon Rouge material, with theaim of attaining lodge-status. A members’ paper, called Dracontias,is published and sent to members four times per year.The Dragon Rouge initiatory system consists of 11 degrees,based on the qliphoth – the shadow side of the qabalistic Tree ofLife. For the three first initiations the adept progresses by workingwith correspondence courses in magic, and requesting to be initiatedinto the corresponding degree when finishing the course. Initiationsbeyond the third degree are dealt with in a more personal andindividual fashion. At the third initiation, the adept also swears theDragon Oath, and is initiated into the Dragon Order, which is theinner magic core of the order. The organizational and ideologicalInner Circles consist of those long-time and higher initiatedmembers who work actively with the organizational and ideologicalaspects of Dragon Rouge.Dragon Rouge is a highly eclectic movement. Elements frommost mythologies are incorporated in one way or another, althoughcertain themes surface more often than others. Tantric practices,including Kundalini meditation; Old Norse mythologies, includingshamanic techniques and rune-magic practices; Goetic magic andqliphotic exercises; and magic workings within the confines ofnature, appear most often on the schedule. The different techniquesare often mixed in ways that appear most functional for members,and each individual member is supposed to find ways of practicingmagic which work best for him/her. The typical Dragon Rougemeeting and course usually consists of a lecture, practice – oftenincluding meditative elements, and a discussion following thepractice. The Dragon Ceremony and the Lilith Invocation arerecurring and central pieces of the ritual practice.In sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.4, I dealt with four different kinds ofDragon Rouge activities in detail. These were: an annual meeting,"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"304CHAPTER 8 - FINALEa course on ceremonial magic, the opening of a Dragon Rouge lodge,and an initiation ceremony into the second degree of the order.In the second separate analytical section, part three, I studied DragonRouge from a discourse analytical point of view in order to highlightthemes which are distinctive to the order, and which make Dragon Rougewhat it is.Discourse analysis is grounded in social constructionistepistemology, which entails that human beings are involved inprocesses of social reality construction. This does not mean thatthere is no objective reality, only that we are not able to access thisobjective reality other than through the interpretative mechanismsof social communication. Social constructionism, which is a formof constructivism emphasizing the importance of language andother sign systems in social reality construction and meaning-making, works with the following four assumptions:•Our means of communication are not able to provide anobjectively true account of the nature of reality.•The way in which our social reality is formed is directlylinked to our social relationships with other communicativebeings.•Communication is a form of social action, and thusconstructs and reproduces what it is communicating.•Seemingly self-evident knowledge must be viewedcritically, as this does not consist of objective truths andoften maintains hegemonic power-relations.In discourse analysis, discourse is defined as “communicativesystems in use”, suggesting a focus on actual communicative events,instead of viewing communication as a means to access the innerthought patterns of persons. Meaning is produced and reproducedwithin communication. Discourses are meaning systems, that is tosay specific ways of interpreting the world, aspects of the worldand specific events, and contain as such ideological dimensions.In my research, I found six major and recurrent discourses,which were essential to my informants in Dragon Rouge. The magic-is-all-encompassing discourse expresses the Dragon Rouge system"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"305CHAPTER 8 - FINALEof magic as more complex and comprehensive than many otherspiritual systems. The discourse also formulates magic as somethingthat is deeply woven into all fields of the practitioner’s life.Furthermore, everything in existence is deeply interwoven, and thisthrough forces that the magician can access and control. The self-evolvement discourse concerns the primary goal of the magician togrow both personally and spiritually, ultimately to the extent ofthe magician becoming a god. The personal evolution of themagician requires him/her to dig deep into the core of his/her self,in order to access the totality of his/her person and to transmute itinto a more compact and perfected state. In the individualitydiscourse the magician has total freedom and responsibility for his/her own actions and choices. No one else can make these decisionsfor the magician, and this is also expressed in the prerequisite ofthe practitioner to find his/her own way of doing magic, the ordersimply providing some of the tools.The magic-is-demanding discourse represents the magician asa courageous and exceptional individual, as one who has taken astep into the unknown, although well aware of the enormous taskahead. Magic, especially dark magic, is also risky, if not outrightdangerous. The magician should therefore be focused anddetermined in the process of magic evolution. The reverence, andmagic importance, of nature are the focus of the nature discourse.Nature is divine and has an intrinsic value. In addition, forces ofchaos can be most easily accessed in nature, as untamed nature isthe opposite of the structured city and civilization. Founded anddeveloped in egalitarian Swedish society, a women’s rightsdiscourse is more or less bound to be found in the order, but theDragon Rouge variant extends further than this. Monotheisticreligion is seen as the principal cause for the feminine aspects ofexistence having been pushed aside into the dark, and to access atotal spirituality the feminine forces have to be approached. In theeffort to access these feminine forces, the positions and situationsof women often come into focus, especially in the critical view onChristianity.These six discourses are intertwined in what I call the web ofdiscourses. The discourses are co-existent, support each-other andappear in each other’s company. Together they form what could be"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"306CHAPTER 8 - FINALEcalled a discourse complex, which more or less produces a coherentand complex system of meaning-making.8.2 Dragon Rouge in ContextIn section 2, I briefly discussed the history of Western esotericismand, in greater depth, the Theosophical Society, the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, ‘New Age’ spirituality,neopaganism and the Swedish alternative spiritual milieu of thelate 20th and early 21st centuries. I also treated societal changes thathave had a profound effect on spirituality and spiritual life. Howdoes this connect to Dragon Rouge, which is obviously my point offocus? Dragon Rouge is firmly grounded in Western esoterictraditions, as are the Theosophical Society, the Golden Dawn, ‘NewAge’ spirituality and neopaganism. Earlier esoteric currents andnotions provides the backdrop to movements such as Dragon Rouge,as does the late 19th and early 20th century esoteric and occultmovements discussed in chapter 2. ‘New Age’ spiritualities andneopaganism spring up slightly before Dragon Rouge, but are asphenomena contemporary with the order. The Swedish alternativespiritual milieu is the locality and cultural-ideological frameworkin which Dragon Rouge is immersed.The rhetoric of spiritual alchemy, a longstanding esotericcurrent and notion, is one of the main communicative strategies inDragon Rouge. In alchemical language use, the process of magicalprogress is referred to as a compression and transmutation of themagician’s True Self (see Eriksson 2001: 124-130). In line with theEgyptology which became prominent in the 18th century, Egypt isidentified as a, or perhaps the, origin of esoteric wisdom. Instead offinding the elixir vitae one manufactures the Black Diamond, thelife-providing black-earth shores of the Nile being the obvious frameof reference. Qabalah, another influential notion and current, is ofvital importance to Dragon Rouge. Following the Golden Dawn’sincorporation of the qabalistic Tree of Life, the sephiroth, as a modelfor the initiatory system, Dragon Rouge has adopted the elevenspheres of the qliphoth, the shadow side of the sephiroth – or the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"307CHAPTER 8 - FINALETree of Knowledge, as a model for its initiatory system (see Bogdan2003b: 238). Dark astral planes, magic experiences and variousmythological elements correspond to the qliphotic spheres.The three Proto-Rosicrucian texts attributed to the imaginaryChristian Rosencreutz, and his mythical secret initiatory society,were the inspiration of real initiatory societies. Freemasonry wasthe most successful of these and has in turn become a model onwhich other initiatory societies are modelled. As an initiatory order,Dragon Rouge builds on the roots planted by Freemasonry.Furthermore, as an esoteric order founded in Scandinavia, therunologic and rune magic works of the Swedes, Johannes Bureusand Sigurd Agrell, are also important for the order.Elements from Indian religiosity, especially Tantrism, are verycentral in Dragon Rouge. The concepts of chakras and that ofKundalini, which in Dragon Rouge is identified as the inner Dragonor life-force of man – and which is thus pivotal to the magic works,were largely introduced to the west by Charles Leadbeater of theTheosophical Society. The Theosophical Society was also the mostimportant movement in terms of the focus of esoteric interest inIndia. Aleister Crowley explored Tantric Yoga and crafted Westernsex magic out of it. Sex magic has become one of the key elementsof contemporary magic, and as the life force is identified as the libidoin Dragon Rouge, sex magic is central to this order as well. Crowleywas also the mage behind defining and establishing Will as theagency of magic. Will, or True Will, is the organ of magic, and indeedthe core of the magic personality, in most of contemporary magicand neopaganism, and Dragon Rouge is no exception.In combining the rhetoric of alchemy with Crowleyan concepts,the Black Diamond is identified as the core of the magician, or his/her Will manifest. Crowley also broke with earlier esoteric traditionin turning from God-centeredness to the pursuit of becoming a godhimself, which is the precise goal of the Dragon Rouge magician.Although Aleister Crowley dismissed black magic, and had a bitmore ‘right-handed’ approach to magic and the goals with it, hecanbe seen as the inspiration for and forefather of Western Left HandPath magicians. Dragon Rouge shows many similarities to KennethGrant’s, who has been highly influenced by Crowley, ideas onmagic. For example, Kenneth Grant frequently names the"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"308CHAPTER 8 - FINALE“draconian current’ as the original form of spirituality, andintroduced the qliphotic as a noteworthy concept in contremporarymagic, and not just as something to be avoided.On a more contemporary note, recent societal transformationshave played an important role in the way which spirituality hascome to be formed in contemporary Western society. Late modernitybrought with it distrust in older authoritative institutions, includinginstitutional religion, and is in itself a factor in the birth of newspiritualities such as ‘New Age’ and neopaganism. Thefragmentation of late modernity generated a situation where thereno longer existed a single true alternative in the religious spherefor many individuals, which in turn favoured an eclectic andsyncretistic approach, where components from various religionsand mythologies are disembedded from their original contexts andfreely re-embedded in new spiritual constructs. ‘New Age’spiritualities, where almost everything can be incorporated in onefashion or another, are the most apparent contemporary exampleof this phenomenon, but Dragon Rouge is no stranger to eclecticism.There is probably no mythology known to Western comparativereligion or anthropology which has not been, or will not be, exploredby some Dragon Rouge magician.The transnational connections of a globalized world have madedistance a minor factor in the spread of spiritualities. Dragon Rougewas founded in Stockholm, Sweden, but was soon discovered bywould-be-magicians from all around the Western world. The firstforeign members were Germany, where the number of membersmight exceed the number of Swedish members in the near future,but nowadays the order has members in Europe, North, Centraland South America. With the conception of correspondence courses,and the advances in communication technologies, physicalproximity is no longer a prerequisite for working with the DragonRouge magic-system.The similarities between ‘New Age’ spiritualities andneopaganism are numerous, as are the similarities between theaforementioned and Dragon Rouge. They are all mainlyspiritualities of life (see Heelas 2002), where the self is placed atcentre, and discourses of personal evolution, individuality, natureand women’s rights, identified as key elements in Dragon Rouge,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"309CHAPTER 8 - FINALEpermeate them all. The resacralization of the world, in a world aftersecularization, is central to these kinds of spirituality. Thesimilarities between neopaganism and Dragon Rouge areparticularly striking. From the list of characteristic traits ofneopaganism in section 2.1.5, all but one could be used to describeDragon Rouge. The importance of gender polarity is played downin Dragon Rouge, as it is in most Left Hand Path organizations,where both the feminine and masculine forces and traits are thoughtto exist to a higher degree in each individual, regardless of sex.When discussing the similarities between ‘New Age’spirituality and Dragon Rouge, the difficulties in defining ‘NewAge’ become apparent. In Olav Hammer’s list of possible elementsof ‘New Age’ spirituality, presented in section 2.1.4, most featurescould be said to exist in almost all contemporary esotericism. In theinstinctual feel for “what ‘New Age’ is”, which most people whoare familiar with this form of spirituality have, Dragon Rouge wouldmost likely not be grouped in this category. Nevertheless, as bothare parts of – and share the prehistory of – the overarching traditionof Western Esotericism, there are similarities and connections.The Swedish context, and especially that of Stockholm, is ofparticular interest when discussing Dragon Rouge. This is, afterall, the locality and milieu in which the order was founded and inwhich the headquarters of the order are still located. ThomasKarlsson, the primary founding member of Dragon Rouge, wasinvolved in much of the spiritual underground of Stockholm beforefounding the order. As discussed in section 4.1.1, he tried out severalspiritualist movements in his youth. He also used to work in at the‘New Age’ bookshop Vattumannen, the focal point of alternativespirituality in Stockholm. The Swedish neoshaman circle wascentred on the bookshop in question, as described in section 2.2,and Dragon Rouge has no doubt been influenced by this group, atleast in the early stages of the order. Many of the same themes havebeen touched upon by both orders, such as ancient Norsemythology, and runology – and particularly the Uthark theory ofSigurd Agrell – and neoshaman techniques. In the early days ofDragon Rouge the order was criticized by the neoshamans ofYggdrasil (see Bjarke 1991), although this has not been the case lateron, at least not to the same extent."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"310CHAPTER 8 - FINALEGenerally, views of, and relations to, neopagan organizationsare positive in Dragon Rouge, although Wicca is an exception. ManyDragon Rouge members criticize Wiccans for being too light-oriented and condemning the exploration of the dark (see IF mgt2001/50; 2001/52). At times, the dislike has been mutual (see Wiberg1999a; 1999b). I have, however, met one member of the order whoidentifies herself as Wiccan (see IF 2001/1:5).The links between Dragon Rouge and the Swedish ‘New Age’milieu are not as apparent, although they exist. Thomas Karlssonwas involved in the publication of the esoteric magazine,Quintessens, which was later on amalgamated with the ‘New Age’magazine, Alpha/Omega. Generally the focus on the dark aspects ofexistence are not favoured in ‘New Age’ spirituality (see York 1995:159-161).8.3 Conclusions and DiscussionIn closing, I underline the results of my study by briefly discussingthe key points. They are – as one can see from the subsequentpassages – the following:Age-old esoteric traditions are maintained in Dragon Rouge.The order has a distinct and formative founding figure. The orderis characterized by eclecticism, but with a special focus on Indianand Old Norse mythology and religion. In the programme lectureson various topics are important, but actual practice is seen to bemore central. With the help of discourse analysis, I have shownthat there are certain guiding principles common to most membersof Dragon Rouge, and that it is through communicative praxis thata comprehensive worldview is produced in the order.Dragon Rouge is a contemporary alternative spiritualorganization. Dragon Rouge is also a magic order in a lineage,existing in a continuum of earlier esoteric and occult phenomena.Esoteric ideas and practices have co-existed with mainstreamChristianity for the extent of the latter’s existence, and has at timeshad a major impact on the development of mainstream religion,philosophy, science and art. Central notions and currents in Western"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"311CHAPTER 8 - FINALEesotericism, such as alchemy, qabalah, Rosicrucianism, and magic,all play a part in the background and present reality of DragonRouge, as discussed in section 8.2. Obscure as the order might seemwhen viewed in the context of present day Swedish society andreligious tradition, it nonetheless stands on the shoulders of long-lasting traditions. The concepts and terminology Dragon Rougeoperates with are neither novel nor anomalous, when consideringWestern esotericism as a whole.Although existing in a long line of esoteric predecessors,Dragon Rouge is, nonetheless, a distinctly late modern phenomenon.The disembedding of elements from foreign spiritual traditions andreembedding them in new contexts has been the practice of Westernesoteric movements since the move of the Theosophical Society toIndia (see section 2.1.1). The eclectic imaginative reincorporationof foreign spiritualities has however accelerated since the 1960s,most notably with the ‘New Age’ movement. This acceleration hasin turn resulted in a more accentuated decoupling of chosenelements from their origins, in order to more smoothly be able to fitthe often disparate components into a coherent system and aWestern late modern way of thinking.Dragon Rouge is strongly eclectic, in many ways more so thanindividual ‘New Age’ groups are. Spiritual practices, philosophiesand mythologies are ransacked for useful elements, and when foundthese are tried out and possibly incorporated into the Dragon Rougesystem. Several Dragon Rouge members express the sentiment thatthe very foundation of ‘the Dragon Rouge system’ is inclusiveness(see IF mgt 2001/47). Any element an individual practitioner isinterested in exploring may be a part of that individual’s personalmagic system, and if this person is active in the order, the elementsincorporated will most likely be tried out by other members. Thekey-word here is eclecticism, coupled with pragmatism. This is alsoclearly exhibited in the improvised fashion in which rituals andceremonies are composed – marking a difference to many otherearlier and contemporary orders and movements, in which the formof the ritual is strictly dictated by tradition. Also in contrast totraditional esotericism, as well as to the ‘New Age’ movement,Dragon Rouge is strongly grounded in practice. The intellectualcapacity to interpret esoteric source material is also valued, but it is"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"312CHAPTER 8 - FINALEin practice that magic is manifested. In the latter aspect, DragonRouge bears more resemblance to neopagan movements than toearlier esotericism.Even though Dragon Rouge incorporates elements from mostreligious traditions, two cultural spheres function most often assources for inspiration, namely, the Scandinavian and the Indian.Old Norse mythology, including the esoteric speculation andinterpretation of runes, is a fundamental for the order. In thefootsteps of Johannes Bureus, the nine worlds of Old Norsemythology are incorporated into a qabalah-like system, this timearound into one which centres around the qliphoth. From Indianspirituality especially Tantrism is an element of great importance.The concept of Kundalini, the life-force and sexual energy of thehuman – with the feminine Shakti as its active focus, is central toDragon Rouge. In a most eclectic fashion a Kundalini-awakening-exercise can be performed in a Scandinavian shamanistic setting –performed as a drum-journey. Qabalistic demonesses such as Lilithare addressed together with Indian deities such as Kali and OldNorse deities such as Hel, all in a syncretistic mix. Distinct, but insome way similar, deities and demons are thought to ultimatelyrepresent the same hidden forces, and thus addressing them in thesame ritual setting is only natural. Another central source, perhapseven more central although most often situated in the context ofthe abovementioned ones, is the qabalistic tradition.As already demonstrated the eclecticism of the order isgoverned by the discourse of individuality. The order is extremelyreluctant to dictate choices, and the members have a responsibilityto explore and choose their spiritual path for themselves. Theresulting magic system becomes a highly individual one,constructed from a vast array of different components. Insimplification one could say that for the Dragon Rouge magicianthere is no higher authority than the self, not when it comes tochoices regarding magic progress.The process of magic progress is also a process of identityconstruction for the dark magician. In a predominantly reflexiveway, the magician goes into him-/herself and dissects his/her self,in order to ‘access his/her true self’. In a society and an era markedby secularism, the magicians of Dragon Rouge are involved in a re-"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"313CHAPTER 8 - FINALEsacralization and re-enchantment of daily life. Through magic, mostevery event and choice can be rendered universally meaningful tothe individual, and mundane incidents become something far more.The dark magician seeks an answer to the question ‘what is themeaning of life and existence’, and finds it in him-/herself.Social movements of the late modern period are characterizedby transnational connections. Dragon Rouge has in a short timespread throughout the Western world. The Swedish originatedorder has not spread in such a high degree to its neighbouringcountries – Finland, Norway or Denmark, but instead to countriessuch as Poland, Germany and Italy, and even to North and SouthAmerica. The interplay between members in different countries iswidespread, and there even exist ritual groups the members ofwhich live far away from each other. Rituals and ceremonies areperformed in unison, although individually, and the results are thencommunicated through the mediation of e-mail.Although Dragon Rouge is a non-hierarchical organization,there nonetheless exists one central person behind the foundationand ideological development of the order, namely Thomas Karlsson– who was only 17 years of age when founding the order. Besidesbeing the key founder of the order, Karlsson has also been thedriving force behind Dragon Rouge, his early and later occultexperiences leaving their mark on the order as a whole. Karlsson’snon-magical experiences, as well, have had an impact on the pathsDragon Rouge has come to take. He is at present enrolled as adoctoral student at the institution for the History of Religions atthe University of Stockholm, and has a M.A. degree in the Historyof Ideas at the same university. Considering the similarity betweenthe theoretical portion of a Dragon Rouge meeting and a universitylecture, whilst remembering that the Theosophical Society was alsoinvolved in lecture-like activities, the university background ofKarlsson is not unimportant in assessing Dragon Rouge andengagement in the practice of magic.When considering the eclectic, pragmatic and improvisedcharacter of Dragon Rouge, the conclusion might easily be drawnthat there can not exist any general ideological basis of the order.This is however not the case. The discourses which I treated inchapter 7 give expression to the formative principles. They provide"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"314CHAPTER 8 - FINALEthe mold in which the different components of dark magicphilosophy and practice are set and combined, and the glue whichholds them together. In the discursive praxis of Dragon Rouge, theoften discrepant elements incorporated are forged into a coherentsystem. Through the web of discourses, a comprehensive view ofreality is produced and maintained.As a result, it can be argued that Dragon Rouge as an order,although not explicitly advocating any one way of interpreting theworld, does indeed operate with a general worldview. Whereas theoccult and metaphysical interpretations may vary to a large degree,the views on the mundane world, society and morality are moregenerally held in common. Similarly to most neopagan movements,nature and femininely interpreted forces and characteristics arehighly valued in Dragon Rouge. Civilization is considered torepresent the structures of cosmos, whereas nature represents thepotentials inherent in chaos. Masculine forces are linked to exotericmainstream religion – the Right Hand Path, whereas feminine forcesare connected to chaos and nature – the Left Hand Path. Mainstreamreligion, represented by Christianity, is criticized for wrong-doingsagainst nature and women – and even more centrally, formaintaining ideological structures which legitimize these wrong-doings. The dark magician needs to appraise nature and the hiddenfeminine forces of existence, naturally extending to a discourse ofwomen’s rights.In opposing civilization and nature, and in appraisingindividual responsibility and choice, the ethical code systems oftraditional Christian culture are discarded. The choice is to go foran individual situation based morality, also a feature common withmost neopagan movements. The main exercise the dark magicianis involved in is self-evolvement on an elevated level. Combinedwith the critique of materialism this striving displays a search for‘something more out there’, and involves a re-sacralization of thesecular world. The Dragon Rouge magician is not content with whatsecular society has to offer concerning the meaning of life. Indeed,he/she is on a trek to find better alternatives. This common ‘DragonRouge-frame of mind’ does not necessarily involve each and everymember in the same fashion or to the same extent, although it islikely to be more and more adopted with increasing participation"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"315CHAPTER 8 - FINALEwithin the order. In the spirit of eclecticism, human communication,individual responsibility and choice, the discourses of DragonRouge are negotiated in joint operations. The discourses do not existoutside communication, and each member communicates andhighlights differently.* * *Research on alternative spiritualities is on the rise in different areasof religious studies. Research paradigms concerning contemporaryesoteric trends are in the process of formulation, and questionsconcerning what the overarching subject field should be called arebeing negotiated. Perhaps the subject field is in itself so differentfrom traditional religion that traditional methods and approacheswill no longer suffice. Will the study of contemporary WesternEsotericism constitute a new strand of the academic study ofspirituality, in such a way as to require its own theories, methodsand approaches? Questions such as these surfaced at theinternational ASANAS (Alternative Spiritualities and New AgeStudies) conference in Wolverhampton, England, in 2004137, and theanswer was generally a hesitant yes.Studies in alternative spiritualities such as the ‘New Age’movement, contemporary magic orders and neopagan organisationssuggest that the methods of traditional comparative religion mayindeed be unable to provide sufficient answers. Whereas worldreligions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism have scripturalcanons and are constructed on authoritative doctrines, the case isgenerally different with alternative spiritualities. There are noauthoritative doctrines, no official scriptural documents orauthoritative organisations. Individuality is highly valued, andgroups are loosely organized and dissolve and reform in a fluidfashion on a regular basis. Participant observation is almost arequirement if the researcher is to truly catch the nature of themovement, and while ethnographic research has a long tradition137 See, for example, the paper delivered by Graham Harvey at the 2004ASANAS conference (Harvey 2004), in which he argues that the research toolsneed to be further refined, as studies in the field of neopaganism havehighlighted the shortcomings of current positions and methods."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"316CHAPTER 8 - FINALEin anthropology, the cultural anatomy of the informants is largelydifferent from that of the informants the traditional anthropologistis familiar with. Neopagans and contemporary magicians are oftenhighly educated and self-reflexive individuals, and are more oftenthan not familiar with the academic fields the researchers hail from.The dialogical nature of the research progress will necessarily be akey element. It is probably not an accidental occurrence that a largenumber of academics studying neopagan movements, for example,consider themselves to be neopagans. This is an issue often viewedas awkward in religious studies, but is something which will haveto be discussed openly sooner or later.Whilst ‘New Age’ spirituality and neopagan communities havereceived a huge increase in academic interest, apparent in theincreasing number of academic dissertations and publications onthe subject area, so called Left Hand Path spirituality is still basicallyvirgin territory in terms of research. Although the Left Hand Pathis a much rarer spiritual tradition than the Right Hand Path, itnonetheless plays a culturally far more important role than thenumber of people actually involved in Left Hand Path organizationssuggests. Popular culture is one field where Left Hand Path themesrear their heads with increasing frequency. One example is the filmThe Ninth Gate, directed by Roman Polanski in 1999, which containsapparent LHP themes. The present work is a case study of a LeftHand Path organization. As organizations such as these are veryvaried in form and function, my findings are not directly valid forother Left Hand Path organizations. Research on Dragon Rougecan, however, shed some light on the nature of the form ofspirituality in general.Recent societal change favours alternative spiritualities. Thepossibilities and insecurities of a late modern world, combined withits globalized and glocalized nature, place individual experienceand life in the here-and-now at the centre. Many spiritually inclinedindividuals can no longer motivate any authority outside theexperiences of the self. Spirituality has become a major factor in theprocess of identity formation, and in the fluidic framework of thelate modern world, identity is never something finitely defined.The late modern spiritual individual is one who is always a seeker.He/she expresses him-/herself through spirituality and finds like-"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"317CHAPTER 8 - FINALEminded persons at great geographical distances, brought closethrough advanced communication technologies.

The mode of spirituality called the Left Hand Path has, however, not yet attracted the attention of academia. The present study of the dark magic order DRAGON ROUGE constitutes an attempt to contribute thoroughly and creatively to this line of research. Objects of study are the organization, philosophy and practices of the order, as well as the complex discursive conventions involved in the adherents’ construction of coherent world views. In an attempt to shed light on the particularities of this contemporary, late modern esoteric phenomenon, a historical perspective on Western Esotericism has here been combined with a discussion on the impact of recent societal change."}]
