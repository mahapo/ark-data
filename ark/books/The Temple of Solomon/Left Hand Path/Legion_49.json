Upon a careful examination of the old grimoires, with their various descriptions. catalogues and taxonomies. it is clearly demonstrated that most demons, and especially Beelzebub Himself, are both single entities and a composite unity of identities. Yet. far from this being a mere quagmire of duality. what emerges instead are singular multiplicities best summarised by the concept of Legion.And it is Legion that Barry Hale is concerned with and whom is conjured in this book. Primarily via image. As is obvious. amongst his myriad artistic and magical influences are the Mexican paper-cuts. But the servitor demons displayed herein are not mere homage or copy. For. just as Solomon sealed and bound his demons in vessels once finished with them. so the medium of the papercut provides a similar function: for. by the folding of the paper and the cutting ofthe image is the demon so bound by the act of its very creation.This is just one of the miraculous acts of magic Legion 49 contains. Of course, since we are dealing with one form of an old devil and his myriads of demons, we are also speaking of the power of prophecy. and here Barry Hale is most prescient in his choice of topic. For when Solomon asks Beelzebub his 'employment' the Demon Prince answers: 'I destroy kings, I ally myself with foreign tyrants, and my own demons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and be lost.

This masterful text fully expounds and crystallizes an exorcistic formula which existed from at least the second century BCE and continued to be a major influence in other related texts beyond the fifth century CEo The formula begins with the identification of the demon: the demon is asked its name, to which the demon replies its name.2 This is followed by a question that places the demon into an astrological schema. This may include descriptive elements and is followed by a description of the physical appearance and abode. The demon is also quizzed about its deeds, powers and activities. The rite is concluded by the demon disclosing the name of the binding angel who thwarts it.

The Lord God of Israel, who has given me this authority, with wisdom and power from God, by means of this signet.' Solomon then questions the summoned demon 'Who art thou?' to which the demon replies 'I am Beelzebub.' The ruler of the demons then promises that he will bring all the spirits in bonds before Solomon. Once 2>eer3e6our is contracted he becomes the agency to bring forth all the other demons or spirits, including the demons 0nos~eris and Asmo8eus.

Thus, the ring is used initially to constrain the first demon, but after the Prince of Demons is subdued and promises to bring another demon to be bound before Solomon, the ring is used sparingly. This is followed by the identification question 'Who are you?' and 'What is your name?' to which the demon replies with a self-identification 'I am ... ' or 'I am called ... · or 'My name is .. .' or 'I am known by the name .. .' This is followed by a self-characterization by the demon which may include astrological correspondence, then a description, the physical appearance, activities, dwelling place, etc., then the name of the thwarting angel, then the sealing or contract, and the employment or commissioning of them to do some task or work. In the case of their employment in the Testament, one of the many different tasks relates to the construction of the Temple. 2 'Were not all things made by my word and by the will of my father? The spirits were made subject to Solomon.'4 The Questions of Bartholomew shares many characteristics with the Testament of Solomon; they are both written in Greek, most probably both composed in Egypt and both share compositional time proximities, although the Testament is prior and is thus an obvious"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"source in the formulation of the Questions. Both are exorcistic texts and have direct parallels in technique and formula. Both deal primarily with the cognate demonic figures })ccf3c6ouf and })cfuir. These two demons both claim themselves in the Testament as the first angel in the first heaven and the first angel formed who fell and became the ruler of all the demons in Tartarus, as well as being the first formed angel who fell for his refusal to worship the image of God, the angel that Keepeth Hell in the Questions. Both texts also contain poignant astrological information. The Questions of Bartholomew shows a development in the rites of exorcism and is essentially a Christian recontextualisation of the exorcistic formula found in the Testament of Solomon, with some innovations. Although the figure of Solomon is mentioned to give the Questions a mark of authenticity, through building on biblical precedence,Jesus becomes the central figure expounding to Bartholomew the method and techniques by which to constrain the mighty devil. The Archangel Michael plays a significant role in both works. In the Testament of Solomon he introduces the demons indirectly, as the agency of God that delivers the ring which seals the demons, and is the tool by which Solomon gains control over them. In the Questions of Bartholomew he directly summons the mighty adversary, the Antichrist, at Jesus' beckoning. Although not mentioned in the Questions, this could be seen as fulfilling the prophecy given by one of the demons in the Testament that foretold of the coming of the Messiah and the power he will exert over them: 'The spirit Enepsigos prophesied to me, saying: 'This is what thou, King Solomon, doest to us. But after a time thy kingdom shall be broken, and again in season this Temple shall be driven asunder; and all Jerusalem"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"shall be undone by the King of the Persians and Medes and Chaldeans.

And then we shall go forth in great power hither and thither, and be disseminated all over the world. And we shall lead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of God is stretched upon the cross. For never before doth arise a king like unto him, one frustrating us aff, whose mother shall not have contact with man. Who else can receive such authority over spirits?\" .' In the Questions Bartholomew asks Jesus to show him the adversary of men, 'that we may behold him, of what fashion he is, and what is his work, and whence he cometh forth, and what power he hath that he spared not even thee, but caused thee to be hanged upon the tree.' Jesus said that Bartholomew was 'bold of heart' but what he asked to see he was not able to behold. He then led them to the Mount of Olives so that they could look wrathfully upon the keepers of Tartarus. Thereupon Jesus beckoned to the Archangel Michael to sound his trumpet. The earth shook and J3eCair arose from the depths, bound in chains, being held by six hundred and sixty angels, 'His face was like a lightning of (Ire and his eyes full of darkness. And out of his nostrils came a stinking smoke; and his mouth was as the gUlf of a ? reci? ice , and the one of his wings was four-score cubits.' U~on seeing the mighty demon the apostles fell to the earth and became as dead. Then Jesus tells Bartholomew to arise and to go and place his heel upon the head of the great devil and with his heel upon his neck to ask him what his power is. Bartholomew complies with the request and the Antichrist trembles and is filled with fury."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Bartholomew becomes afraid and asks Jesus for a hem of his garment to which Jesus replies 'It is enough that Bartholomew is commanded by the word of Jesus and goes in his name to ask the Devil \"what thou wilt\".

And Bartholomew went and trod upon his neck, and pressed down his face into the earth as far as his ears. Then Bartholomew saith unto him 'Tell me who thou art and what is thy name?' And the demon replied saying 'Lighten me a little, and I will tell thee who I am and how I came hither, and what my work is and what my power is.' And he lightened him and saith to him 'Say all that thou hast done and all that thou doest' 2:>erair says to Bartholomew that he will reveal 'who I am, how I came hither, what my work is, what my powers are.' Then 2:>erair tells Bartholomew that his name was originally §atanaef, the messenger of God, but it became '§atanas the Keeper of Hell' after he rejected the image of God.

The kernel is the identification formula: the name of the demon and attributes are the key to establishing power over them. First the initial constraining of the demon by the Ring or Heel, then the identification of the demon, followed by the astrological description, self characterizing of the demon's physical form,s its dwelling place, its evil actions, how it came hither, works and powers, thwarting angels, sealing the demon, contracting it to a task and binding it to come at the behest of the magician. 3 Another method from the Solomonic corpus which combines the knowledge of names with the knowledge of technique involving physical methods is clearly articulated in The Veritable Clavicles of Solomon.6The methods of constraint are illustrated in the instructions of how to deal with obstinate spirits. If the spirits are reluctant to appear after the conjurations, the magician should uncover the pentacles made to constrain and command the spirits7and with the blade pronounce a stronger and more potent conjuration.A conjuration so powerful that even if the spirit be incarcerated in a mighty prison, bound in chains of iron and fire, contained by oath, at the utterance of that most potent conjuration 0/1 bonds will be burst asunder and no pact or contract will be strong enough to contain or hold the spirit.8 If the rebellious spirits are still defiant which is almost inconceivable, then their names should be written on virgin paper and trampled, soiled with mud, dust or clay, and a fire shall be made with noxious odors and other"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"things most unpleasing to the spirits and the parchment be placed over the fire.With a curse the paper is cast into the flames that the spirit or spirits may be tormented and tortured day and night finding no repose from perpetual pain.

Kindling a fresh fire with sweet smelling perfumes, take up the exorcised pen and write their names afresh and perfume the signa magica, showing the spirit the holy pentacles and ask them what you will and it will be done. The object of the operation being obtained by the compliance and obedience of the spirits, they are given license to depart in peace by the virtue of the pentacles, returning to their abodes and instructed at the behest of the practitioner to return without haste, obedient and without delay. or excuse when called without solemn rites and observances.9 Also the spirits should be made to swear on the book of virgin paper in which is written the constraints. conjurations and seals.

The demons that before the victory of Jesus had exclusive control over death were reduced substantially to the position they occupied before the Fall. With their power so diminished they turned their efforts to securing the eternal damnation of the human Soul. Although the demonic arts requires correct execution of the physical methods and techniques, timing and attributes, the main source of the magicians power over the demons was not the physical methods, but rather the knowledge and application of the names.These names can be divided into two main categories: demonic and angelic.The names ofthe devils and demonic superiors in the infernal hierarchy and the heavenly order comprise the 9. Equally, the spirits may also bind people and make them obedient by 'seals' and 'bonds' as Beelzebub states: 'They doe me wrong, and are injurious in this inparliwlar unto mee, because in all right shee is mine, and f will make proofe thereof by many speciall allegations; and f if shee be the wife of Christ, whereare her vertues.

Every Lesser is amenable to its Greater. yet there are a few examples. as in the Testament of Solomon. where the demon 0mius is empowered by Solomon to constrain his Prince and brings J3eer3e6ouJ before the great King.

Another example that does not reference the Testament but contains the exorcistic formula in which J3eer3e6u6 figures centrally, is a fragmentary magical text found within the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumram.

In this particular spell the demon Beelzebub is adjured directly in the second person: '[You/to you] Beelzebub': making use of the vocative pronoun, which is almost mandatory in adjurations of demons. In Hebrew. the subject being addressed by the vocative pronoun is indicated by the use of a suffix appended to the noun.This puts beyond the measure of the doubt exactly who is the subject of the appeal/spell/adjuration, however this is further reiterated by the use of vocative clauses and phrases which build up an identification with and further locate the subject -particularly in terms of the subject's attributes. achievements. powers and other aspects. For instance. a proliferation of statements beginning with 'Thou who art...' which follow each other; returning time after time to the subject. The vocative also often follows a resumptive pronoun, cementing this sense of repeated and emphatic appeal/command, ego 'You, I adjure you:' In the New Testament we find an account of a demonic exorcism performed by Jesus in Mark 5: 9-13: 'For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.And he asked him, What is thy name?

Here again is an application of the formula employed by Solomon. First Jesus adjures the spirit then asks the name, the demons reply, Jesus then sends the demons into the swine and they are disposed of. Further examples of exorcisms in the New Testament can be found in Mark, Luke,Acts and Matthew. These include those with a direct address to the demon - with and without the name - and without any direct address, exorcising the demon at a distance. In Matthew 12: 24 Jesus is accused of driving out demons 'by Beelzebub the prince of the devils' which was interpreted by some to mean that he was possessed by the devil and the demon was acting through him. However, the accusation 'being with Beelzebub' should not to be considered to mean Jesus became the unfortunate plaything of this demon. Rather, Jesus is accused of being a magician, who by incantations and magical practices has obtained control over ~eer3e6u6 and makes him do his bidding, even unto his own disadvantage, for 'Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation.'14 Thus, there are in essence only two types of congress that can be had between men and demons. One is either possessed by the demons and at their mercy, under their control, or the demons are the servants of man as a magician and master. 14. Matthew 12:25 (King James Version) 15.

In contrast, the sorcererous perspective regards demons as independent of God's will they fell through their own free will and therefore were outside of Gods kingdom, but had the ability to act within it. Thus liberated, the sorcerer is able to transfer blame to a supernatural force which he could control and constrain. From this empowered paradigm the sorcerer could deal with any ailments or directly address the cause magically and effect change, not being at the mercy or tyranny of the demons, or God, or his agencies.

Other round oracular vehicles include: magic mirrors, polished metals, volcanic glass, mirrors that contain magnetic fluids, black glass, concave or convex mirrors and alchemical mirrors, all from whence the reflection of the seers' face might become the menstruum by which the demon takes shape.

The child's natural purity was a form of protection and ensured that the information received from the demons was not some fanciful or elaborate fabrication, for demons were believed unable to lie to such a child. In the Testament of Solomon a boy, one of Solomon's favoured artisans, featured significantly. The boy was afflicted with the vampiric demon 0rnias who at the coming of sunset would take half of his wages and food. Also did the demon 'continue to suck on the thumb of his right hand every day' robbing the boy of his vitality.

In The Magical Treatise of Solomon the child was used in an exorcistic rather than a conjurational application. The invocation of the evil spirits was whispered into the right ear of the demoniac, while the boy stared into a specially prepared pot until he saw the demonic figure in the middle of the vessel. Thereupon it was sealed up and once bound, the demon could be questioned by the magician.

This essential weapon reveals in itself the connection between dealing with demons and communicating with the spirits of the dead. There was no basic distinction made between the demonic servants of magicians and the necromancer's spirits of the dead. Ancestry-based religions, where spirits of the dead become demons, cults of angry ghosts, or gods, are testament to this. The demons and the spirits of the dead were both of a supernatural order, unlimited by time or space and utilized in very similar fashions. The only real difference was in their initial origins and the magical knowledge necessary for controlling them.

It should be fixed with a handle made from the black horn of a he-goat.

Mapping this multiplicity are biblical accounts. spells, incantations. descriptions. myths. stories, folktales, linguistics and etymologies. puns and parables, injunctions and taboos. possessions. dreams and visions. More formally we find communications, contracts. and pacts: transformation exchanges. transgressing boundaries through infernal congresses against nature.

God has an adversary who has no need of God. ])eef3e6u6 is conceived as a mode and function that is in no way reliant on binary relationships, oppositions or great dualities. He is the very force repressed and exiled to the deepest caves at the bottom of the sea, or the furthest reaches within. In 13eel3e6u6 is the power to destroy God's kingdom.This Devil luxuriates in the empowerments given by God and his people, they made him the ruler over Tartarus, the Prince of the Demons. gave him atrocious august titles, armed and armored him with characteristics and the attributes and powers for war, made him second only to God and God's foremost opponent, and gave him a name too dreadful to be spoken.])ee!3e6u6 and his Legions built the First Temple and God built them a mighty war chariot."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3 , 'tis to be granted; the devils are so many, that some thousands can sometimes at once apply themselves to vex one child of man.' 45 There are an inconceivable number of demons that can be spared from their incalculable garrisons, legions and hordes to makp. vexa-tious their habitations in man's boundless interiority. In the Psalms it says that each of us has one thousand demons on his left and ten thousand at his right. Jesus drives out from a man possessed by the power of 23eef3e6u6 some two thousand demons into a herd of swine. Legions consist of twelve thousand five hundred soldiers, so many devils can be spared for a garrison. Myriads of demons are applied to the chastisements of the saints and holy men. In their tortures, temptations and testing they excite passion in a relentless war to obtain souls for eternal damnation. 'God who is everywhere and not conftned in the smallest places like demons.'46 this significant reference is to Solomon's imprisonment of the demons in vessels, by which means he disposed of them after the building of his Temple. It is significant because unlike God who is inftnite and monotheistic, demons are many and indeterminably ftnite, yet both are everywhere to be found. Like germs, unseen bacteria, invisible microbes, microscopic alien amceba, born on bad airs and baneful winds: 'Lucifer and hells inhabitants are but flies, hand-wormes, pismires, gnats.'47 Thus God and demon are both omni-present, but the demon exists in speciftcity."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"4 There seems to be little distinction between 1'>eef3e6u6 and the poly-Semitic god 1'>a' af. a name given to local or cultic gods of the different peoples of Canaan. These cults were based upon a myriad of elemental genius loci and in powers fixed either geographically, or into objects, votive statues, icons, idols, amulets, alters, vessels, pebbles and gems. They are not the myriad expressions of the one God that was emerging with the consolidation of the tribes. Though these gods shared many traits, they became demonized by the new order, as is attested by the derivations of the many names of demons. Nevertheless, even with the seeming triumph of monotheism over the plethora of gods and pantheistic forms of worship,Abrahamic religious traditions are not without obvious traces of pantheism. The ten spheres and twenty-two paths, the three, seven and twelve, the serpent, sword and tree; the ninety-nine names, the Trinity and the Saints -all thin fac;ades of the pagan gods, days and places. These, with the appropriation of the seasons and times, are called ubiquitous assimilations. 23eer3c6ouf'Lord of High Places' was denigrated into 1'>eef3e6u6 'Lord of the Dunghill', in an effort to create an inverted reflection of the unity of God into a figure of absolute evil, but 1'>eef3e6u6 is a coagulated, abominable figure of a heterodox multiplicity and not part of a polarized duality. 45.
