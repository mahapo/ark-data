[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Commentary on the Seal of the Nine Anglesby Michael A. Aquino VI° GME.Tr.Generally speaking, some of these angles were taken from Pythagoras, who talked interms of the significance of 'numbers\" rather than \"angles. From my readings on thesubject, I am convinced that Plato's discourses upon geometry and the significance of thevarious \"Platonic solids\" are essentially taken from Pythagoras' work, just as Pythagorascame up with these notions following his lengthy stay in Egypt as a priesthood initiate.Fascinating how these \"trails\" just keep going backward until they vanish into the mistsof pre-recorded history.Bear in mind that the Ceremony of the Nine Angles was composed within theconceptual and iconographic limits of the Age of Satan. Nor was it intended to be anextensive, exhaustive \"last word\" on the angles or other included concepts; it wasconceived as a noetic vision and GBM expression. The following comments pertain tomy ideas at that time and deliberately avoid embellishing the CNA with the moresophisticated concepts to which I have since been sensitized through my own work andthe many brilliant examinations by other Setians.FIRST ANGLE: Unity. The concept of the Universe as the totality of existence.Note that this does not admit to monotheism (except in the sense of Deism), becausethere is no room for conceptual distance between a God and a worshipper. The \"laughingone\" is Azathoth, who is \"blind\" and an \"idiot\" because in a condition of perfect unitythere is naught else to see, not any knowledge of anything else possible. [Understand, ofcourse, that I was taking H.P. Lovecraft's gods rather beyond his story-telling version ofthem. I don't in the least represent these as Lovecraft's own ideas, although I rather thinkthat he would not have found fault with such elaborations.] In geometry a singularityidentifies a locus only; there is no extension in any direction. Even the locus is \"boththere and not\", since it has no dimensions at all. Hence there are an infinite number ofloci, for example on a one-inch- long line: an interesting mathemagical paradox.SECOND ANGLE: Duality. The profound and necessarily total change of unity intosymmetry and polarity (and its symbolic representations: Horus and Set, Yang and Yin,etc.) The \"orderer of the planes and angles' is Yog- Sothoth, who is, as the shaper ofenergy and matter, described as the author of Earth in its matter/energy/evolutionaryconfiguration. Note that in pure duality there is no room for judgment between the two;there is only one or the other. In duality geometry creates a single extension (a line).THIRD ANGLE: This is a very critical stage, because the existence of a thirdelement introduces the notion of choice between the two opposites, either absolutely orrelatively (Aristotelian system) or of choice to aspire or not to aspire to universalperfections (= Platonic/Pythagorean system). This is Nyarlathotep, otherwise Set,otherwise Lucifer/Satan, otherwise Prometheus, otherwise Thoth, who has created thepower of perspective and the independent psyche of judgment. Here \"knowledge\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"becomes possible. In geometry we now have the triangle, which is the most rigid offigures and also creates a two-dimensional plane. Note that, per the Book of ComingForth by Night, the Horus/Set relationship actually fits into a threefold matrix rather thana twofold one. Set is an independent Intelligence with perspective upon the nonconsciousobjective universe on one hand and the chaos of the anti-objective universe(HarWer) on the other. The simple Horus/Set duality results from primitive Aristotelianthinking (so kick me, Tharrud Terclis!).FOURTH ANGLE: The Ram of the Sun (Shub-Niggurath/Amon) is a manifestationof the \"awakened\" human psyche as energized by the Messenger. It is thus that \"Satan\" isknown to humanity: a personalized reflection, as it were, of the results of the Messenger'sWorking. Satan's other name (Lucifer) is that of light and enlightenment, hence the\"brilliance\" of the Nine Angles. With the number four we have geometrically a threedimensionaldisplacement in space. Hence existence of matter and energy becomespossible. Hence time becomes possible, as the measurement of change in matter andenergy.FIFTH ANGLE: Humanity as the physical vehicle for the expression of the Satanicpsyche as discussed in the Fourth Angle. Concept of the body as a necessary medium forthe self-realization of the psyche, at least in its early stage. Translation of this intophysical representation of supra- energy/matter Forms such as Set via the creation ofimages, building to temples, etc. A temple with five trihedrons is a four-faced pyramid(as Giza), the 4/5/9 seal is the seal of the Order of the Trapezoid: a marvel of integrated,interrelated 4/5/9 values. As noted elsewhere, even the addition of 4+5+9 = 18, whichtakes you into the \"returning' qualities of 9 as expounded upon in Anton LaVey's\"Unknown Known' in The Satanic Rituals. In geometry 5 creates the pentagram, hencethe Golden Section, hence the concept of perfection. This is why to Pythagoras (and hispriestly mentors) 5 was the most sublime of numbers, and why the pentagram was usedas the seal of the Pythagorean Brotherhood.SIXTH ANGLE: If Crowley considered his Tenth AEther to be accursed, then thiswould be the accursed (or should I say \"hexed\"!) of the Nine Angles. It is the hexagonand hexagram (also the seal of the Jews, authors and proponents of the world's mostnihilistic and self- hating monotheism.) The hexagon corrupts the Golden Rectangle; itadds an angle and a line to the pentagram and pentagon, thus destroying them. Six issymmetry obese and unnecessary (two and four are quite adequate for the principle). Theseeds of the destruction of the hexagonal forms are carried within them, however, forthey necessarily embrace two trapezoids (the four) and the pentagrams defined by thosetrapezoids (the five); hence 4+5 (the nine).SEVENTH ANGLE: the destruction of the status of monotheism by the addition ofa line/angle to the hex. The legacy of the First Beast of Revelation and his sevenfold Sealand Star of Babalon (A.'.A.'.). The forces of the AEon of Horus overcoming those of theAEon of Osiris. Yet the only thing that can be said of seven is that it is an effectivedestroyer of six. It has no creative properties of its own; it has neither the strength of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"symmetry nor the magical powers of its asymmetrical predecessors (1,3,5). Proponents ofsix-isms instinctively fear seven: They warn about such things as the seventh son of aseventh son, of the Seven Towers of Satan in Yezidi legend, of the Seventh Seal, of theJewel of the Seven Stars. Seven is thus a harbinger of doom to six: a shadowing- forth ofthe Apocalypse to come. Geometrically and numerically, like the AEon of Horus, sevenhas an \"identity crisis\". Additions or multiplications or powers of seven yield all sorts ofrandom values and relationships.EIGHTH ANGLE: The temple containing the trihedral angles is a truncatedpyramid: the power of the trapezoid perfectly manifest in a golden Section-based threedimensionalstructure. Thus its architects are the Masters of the Realm (the all-embracingterm for the IV°+ in the original Church of Satan): the Sorcerers who beam from theirtowers the Powers of Darkness to rebuild the world corrupted by six and shattered by theseven, and their seal is the Seal of the Order of the Trapezoid (seal of the Priesthood ofthe original Church of Satan).NINTH ANGLE: the culmination of this dynamic process: the Black Flame in itsperfection: the 'will to power\" of Nietzsche in a glory of desire: the extension of theEnlightened Will and Initiated Psyche throughout all dimensions of space, time, andthought: what in the AEon of Set would be Uttered as Xeper.All material contained herein copyright © 1998 Temple of Set.
