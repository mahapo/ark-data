Adeptship results from a transformation - a transmutation of the lndlvidual.] ThlS beglns at Inltiatlon, whether that be ceremonial or hermetic [i.e. as part of a group or alone]. It is an internal alchemical process of change .and occurs on all levels -the pSyChlC, the magickal, the intellectual, the psychologlcal and the physical. It is the blrth of a new individual who has Skllls, knowledge, understanding and judgement not possessed by the majorlty. The changes themselves arise from a synthesis -there lS an evolution of the] lndivldual and their consciousness because of a successful response to a challenge. Or rather, because of a serles of such successful responses over a perlod of some years. In essence, the Initlate undertakes a challenge, strlves to achleve a certain goal, and if successful, grows in character, maturlty,]\t knowledge, esoterlC skill and so on. They then moye on to new challenges, until the process is complete and Adeptship attalned. The challenges themselves occur on all the levels mentioned above -l.e. the pSyChlC, the]\t maglckal (or Occult), the intellectual, the psychological and the physlcal. ~ulntessentially, the path to Adeptship is a quest which lnvolves ordeals, the achlevement of goals and so on. Furthermore, the quest is individual and] lnvolves experiences in the real world: not just 'in the head' or of a 'magickal' nature. By its nature it is solitary -it lnvolves the indlvidual overcomlng the challenges, undertaklng the ordeals, alone. If certain ordeals and challenges and experiences are not undertaken -and lf all of them are not] done alone -then there is no real achievement and thus no genulne Adeptship. The nature of the experiences, challenges and ordeals WhlCh are necessary, and the fact that they all must be done alone and unaided, makes Adeptshlpo difficult to attaln, and is the reason why real Adepts are rare, although there are many who claim the achievement. Returning to the example mentloned above -that is, real Adeptshlp is more dlfflcult to attain than belng selected for and successfully tralning wlth a Speclal Forces unit. The selectlon proceedures for such a Unit are tough, and the training likewise. But the lndivldual undergoing them has a definlte, concrete goal -and that indlvidual lS wlth others: there is a comraderle,]\t a desire not to 'lose face' ln front of others. Also, the indlvidual is ln a definite environment -usually a tralning camp wlth Instructors and other members of the Unit. There lS a 'tradltlon' wlth its special slgns: a unlform,]\t a beret, an lnslgnia. And everyday concerns -food, shelter etc. -are taken care of.* In contrast, the goal of Adeptshlp lS mostly intangible: lt seems 'maglckal' and Occult; part of another world. Further, the Inltiate is on thelr own and J stlll lives, for the most part, In the 'real world' -they have responslbllity to clothe and feed themselves (at the very least) and find or have some shelter. *Except, of course, durlng tralning excerClses of the survival kind -but these are llmlted, ln tlme and space, and part of 'the course' whlch is real and known."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I ~ [ But there ~s more.

Some do it Vla creatlvlty -for instance, music, Art, wrltlng. Some do lt via direct action WhlCh appears to non­Initiates as divorced from OCcultlsm -for instance, politics or bUSlness. [Some combine elements of all of these. There are many other ways. What lS lmportant is that the Adept is using their skills and abilities, derlved from achleving Adeptshlp, in a practical way -their life has a vltalLty, [a purpose, a dynamlsm which lS beyond that of most others. While this is occuring, the Adept is learnlng and evolvlng further. For some Adepts, the majority in fact, thlS lnteraction, this strlvLng for a Destlny, is totally satisfying. In effect, their wyrd lS thlS Destlny. [[Note: wyrd and Destiny are not ldentical. Wyrd is beyond, but lncludes personal Destiny. The 'Tree of Wyrd' comprlses all the seven spheres or stages of the Occult quest.] In esoteric terms, they possess no [desire to progress further; and usually their desire to follow the Occult path to its ending fades, slowly, and then is lost ln everyday and personal concerns. Their quest has been a phase of their lives - a rewarding one, but nevertheless a phase, which they mostly consider they I have 'outgrown'. However, some Adepts see and understand this Destlny in a dlfferent way. Or, rather, they feel it differently after a number of years of strlving. I They gradually become aware of what is beyond, in esoteric terms: they understand this Destiny as a part of their wyrd, and that wyrd as the 'dialectic of change'. In essence, they understand in a real, complete way [i.e. not just 'in theory'] what Aeonic magick lS -of how thelr llfe and deeds are part of an Aeonic imperative. Of course, all Adepts -if they are genulne -understand the rudlments of Aeonic theory. But this is a purely lntellectual, abstract, understandlng. [ It lS cerebral, devold of numinoslty.

They will also come to reallzel\t what 1S mlsslng from thelr own life -in terms of experience. Accordingly, they will redress the balance by livlng to attain what they lacked, to fully complete themselves. This, of course, is difficult. requlring as lt does not­I\t only a genulne self-honesty and awareness, but also a real understandlng of what the balance ltself actually lS. Here, 'theory', book-learnlng and such llke 1S no use. J Then, when some balance is achleved, there will be a discovery of the essence of not only AeonlC Maglck but also what the essence of magickal forces really are. A dis-covery of that which is beyond opposites - a return to and J a going away from, primal Chaos. Following\t all this, there is usually an ordeal which lS magickally ruthless ­WhlCh ascertains if the person undertaking it has actually achieved both an lnternal and a maglckal mastery.

After reaching the target dlstance, a maglckal rltual 1S I performed WhlCh is psychlcally dangerous.

The salient points are that it lnvolves many years of\t striving for something in the real world, of causing changes via a Destiny; that there are and must be more experiences to take the individual far beyond 'the self'; and that there is a real understanding of what lies beyond l external and internal~aglck -of the patterns and processes of dialectlc change, of evolutlon 1tself: ln brlef, of Aeonics.

By their nature they take the Adept to and beyond thel llmits of llv1ng -mostly ln a way more extreme than those which form the 1 character of an Adept and which therefore a novice may undertake to experlence and learn from and so grow. Because of all thlS, the Adept who progresses to the stage beyond possesses real w1sdom. They have achleved many thlngs. They are different from ordlnary mortals -1ns1de, where it matters.

[ The stage beyond that of Master -often slgnifled by the title Grand Master -requires for its achievement slgnificant Aeonic works. That is. it requires the person to have produced profound changes ln the causal and magickal forms which mark a particular Aeon: or to have actually presenced esoteric/magickal energies in such a way that a new Aeon is created. This does not mean that someone believes they have done these things -'on the magickal level'. It means that the structure of evolution has been significantly altered in accord with the wyrd of that Grand Master/Mistress: and in such a way that the changes are perceptible, in real life. ln those forms and structures which Aeonic energy is presenced in the causal, such L as societies. This does not mean a playing at magick by heading some self-created Occult organization or Temple -or writing/talking at great length about Occult matters. Nelther does it mean that one assumes the title by taking over some L already existing organization or group. It most certainly does not mean someone else awards it or confers it. Further.lt means one has not only reached the llmits of present knowledge I regardlng Aeonics and other esoterlC matters [and knowledge in the sense of practical experience] but has also extended those limits by one's own creativlty -taken conscious evolution further. That is. added ln a profound I way to a conscious understanding and to the means for others to attaln such understanding. This in itself does not mean anything 'dogmatic' or of a religious nature -or 'given to one' by some entity/supra-personal intelligence or whatever. It is never 'revelatory' in the sense of a religion. That LS, .. lt does not mean one is \"appointed\" by some entity/extra-terrestrial lntelilgence or whatever and so \"heads\" some sort of messianic crusade of a religious nature.

They might be real heretics -fighting against the State either politically or via armed warfare if that State (as most Western ones do ) upholds the Nazarene sickness of spirit (eVident in modern politicalJ ideas like 'liberalism' and 'humanism' and 'equality': the triumph of the worthless at the expense of the noble). Or perhaps they will be aiding the collapse of such a State, and fostering a reaction, by morally undermining it, for example by dealing in drugs or pornography. Or maybeJ\t they will be teachers in influential positions, subverting others in secret towards Satanism or those transient forms Satanism often assumes to gain control and influence. Or they might be actively culling the worthless, the] scum -by being a vigilante, or a zealous, honourable Police Officer ... Whatever, they will have a direction, a purpose, an intent which goes beyond the edification of their own ego. They will be working to achieve ]\t something great by Virtue of which they can excel in their own lives and thus really live to the full. They will be developing and using their potential, their skills -and thus exulting in life, in overcoming challenges. They will be contributing toward their own evolution and that of eXistence , ] itself because they are harnessing in a practical way the darker forces. This direction, purpose and intent is Satanic strategy, or Aeonics. A rational and thus conscious understanding of~hose forces which shape and change ] evolution and the forms assumed by sentient life from individuals to societies to ciVilizations and Aeons. It is this sinister or Satanic strategy which makes genuine Satanism what it is, and it is knowledge and understanding of this strategy which marks J the genuine Satanic Initiate from the imitation. A Satanist not only acts in a certain way -achieving things in real: life -but they know what they are doing; they possess perspective. An Initiated\t knowledge. This 'knowledge' is not primarily of the psuedo-mystical kind, to do With rituals or other Occult workings/techniques. Rather, it is primarily\t concerned With how and why certain things are as they are, and how those things can be altered or changed. In essence, it is about how cosmic forces interact With and change/evolve life -about the mechanisms by which Aeons, CiVilizations, societies and ultimately individuals grow, are or can be 1 influenced and changed. In the past few decades, many professedly Satanic organizations have arisen, and some have propounded various aspects of the genuine Satanic1\t world-view. But almost without exception they have shown themselves to be lacking in real esoteric knowledge -i.e. Aeonics. Quite often, someone from one of these organizations will 'sound-off' and reveal their ignorance, particuarly concerning the actions of real Satanists in the real world. For instance, it has become fashionable in these psuedo-Satanic circles to castigate individualSatanists, or a Satanic group, if that indiVidual or group becomes"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":", t involved in Politics -particuarly if those Politics are on what is often [ termed the 'extreme Right'. What the ignorant writers and/or speakers in question have not understood, is that such political action is chosen Satanically -to achieve things, both for the individual(s) concerned and [ for Satanism in general. That is, those who are so involved are so because they are consciously and with ruthless determination aiding the sinister dialectic: i.e. Satanic strategy. They are living on the edge -causing and [aiding change/disruption in real life. The ignorance of the psuedo-Satanists is revealed in another area -ethics. There is not and cannot be any such thing as Satanic ethics. What there are, [are means to achieve Satanic goals and the means are a matter for the indiVidual Satanist striving to achieve those goals. That is, it is for each and every Satanist to deCide, for themselves, what is or is not acceptable. This is so because Satanism, in essence, is indiVidual -it [ is not nor can ever be, religious in any way. Those who believe Satanism is or should be religious, do not understand Satanism at all. As I have written and said many times, Satanism is an indiVidualized [defiance and affirmation: one of the fundamental aims of Satanism is to produce or develope proud, strong, unique, individuals of character who possess 'spirit' or 'elan', and who possess inSight and genuine esoteric [knowledge. The aim is not to develope subserviant, obediant, sychophants who cannot think for themselves. Satanism aims to develope the instinct and judgement of each person -and Satanists are critical, aware and capable of assessing things and situations for themselves. Or rather, they will be, [ after appropriate training/guidance. I make no apology for repeating yet again the statement that the religious attitude is anathema to Satanism: Satanism is a rebellion against the religious, dogmatic, instinct. [Satanism shuns obediance to a self-appointed authority; its despises the very idea of a religious 'mandate' and it does not idolize anything -not even the indiVidual Satanists of distinction. Satanism is at the very edge, [the frontier, of conscious understanding and knowledge and Satanists are the ones who try and often succeed in extending that frontier -in bringing more of the cosmos into conscious awareness and thus control. They dare, defy, are heretical, possess the courage to dream and make their dreams of Destiny [ real. Because they know themselves, others and the esoteric workings of eXistence, they are in control, masters. Theyeffect change. And they acquire all these [things because they possess perspective, a perspective whose foundation is Aeonics. What, then, is Aeonics? It is an esoteric understanding, and an I understanding which in these times of overt and covert Nazarene domination is heretical. It is a knowledge of the processes by which Aeons arise, change and are replaced by another Aeon, and how the creative energies of a particular I Aeon are made manifest via a civilization and thus the societies within that civilization and the indiViduals within thosesoci~ies. Itisalso a knowledge of how all these various forms (or causal structures) can be changed -by esoteric or magickal means, and by more practical means. On the purely individual level, Aeonics shows and describes how the psyche/ consciousness of the indiVidual is influenced, both directly and unconSCiously, and how that indiVidual can be changed or controlled. One form of such change is esoteric development -i.e. the techniques and so on, magickal and otherwise, by which the indiVidual can achieve Adeptship and beyond. One form of such control is via archetypal images. In simple terms, an Aeon is an expreSSion of evolutionary change. In esoteric terms, it expresses how the acausal intrudes upon, and thus changes, the causal. For convenience, the causal may be described, here, as the 'everyday' world ­(tt: world of linear time (past, present, future) and three spatial dimensions (height,breadth, width); the world wherein we live out our lives. The acausal may be described, again simply and for convenience here, as the creative energy that drives evolution -i.e. Satan. A ciVilization -or more accurately, an Aeonic civilization -is how Aeonic •"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"J l ] 1 ] ] I J energy, or the acausal, is ordered in the causal -i.e. an Aeonic civilization is how change is produced in the causal. Within each such civilization there ~re societies, and within each society, individ\\l~ls. All civilizations, Aeons and individuals are examples of organisms -they are born, change and they die (in the causal, at least). These varying organisms are born, change and end in certain ways, and these processes can be studied and thus understood. This understanding gives the means of control. Aeonic civilizations are regarded as being tied to, or part of, a particular Aeon, and each Aeon represents a change in our evolutionary development. Thus, each Aeonic civilization represents a significant step in that development: the invention, discovery of significant things, and the development of a greater understanding -of ourselves and the cosmos. The first Aeon is called the Primal and is dated from around 9,000 to 7,000 BP [where 'BP' represents Before the Present: i.e. c. 1990 eh]. Each Aeon, for classificat1on, has a name and is associated with a specific geographical area, a symbol and a 'maglckal working' -or how the acausal energy was perceived/understood then. All Aeons, except the Primal one, are linked to a named civilization. Further, each Aeonic civilization possesses an ethos or sense of Destiny. Aeons and their associated civilizations are listed below. Of course, there are other civilizations -but Aeonic ones are the most significant ones because they produce significant evolutionary change by virtue of being a nexion, or nexus, for acausal energy -i.e. one may consider them, in magickal terms, as giving form directly via their structures and peoples, to acausal energy. Other civilizations are linked to or derive from, these Aeonic civilizations and while they may have in some way contributed to some evoluionary change (e.g. in terms of invention/discovery) that contribution is much less than for Aeonic civilizations.

The exoteric expression of the Western civilization is Science &Technology: the desire to rationally discover and to excercise control over the environment Via technology. All Aeonic civilizations end in Empire, and this Empire or Imperium lasts for around 390 years. The ethos of an Aeonic civilization is mostly manifest to (non-Initiate)consciousness Via archetypes and a Destiny. These archetypes and this Destiny are different for each Aeonic civilization. The Destiny is often enshrined in a literary/poetic/saga-like form, and this form, for nearly all such ciVilizations is of the 'hero-motif' type: the successful response of a hero or heroes to a challenge or series of challenges. For instance, the Hellenic form was Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid. The present Western civilization is at the stage where is should be entering its Imperium (c. 1995-2385 eh). However, the natural archetypes of the Western ciVilization have been mostly transplanted by alien Nazarene ones -and its sense of Destiny almost lost due to Nazarene ethics and social forms. As each Aeonic civilization enters its Imperium, the energies of the next Aeon are or can become manifes t, via a nexion or 'Gate' (or \"sacred site\") which channels acausal energy into causal forms. The next Aeonic civilization follows after three to four centuries -i.e. it takes that length of time for the Aeonic energies to effect large-scale changes in the acausal. Or rather, it has, until now."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"This brief and simplified description of Aeonics allows sinister strategy to be understood. Aeonics describes what has and is occuring in those forces that do mould and have moulded individuals still in thrall -i.e. non-Initiates. The knowledge gains brings a genuine understanding, a perspective. It enables effective sinister magick -it enables the Satanist to act, in the real world, and produce effective changes. To really live -to play at being god: i.e. to be like Satan. It is a fact that most magickal acts are useless -they achieve nothing, except perhaps self-delusion. (Some may achieve a few, external, results edifying to the ego. lAnd they are useless because few really understand what they are dOing. They evoke long dead 'magickal' forms from pas t Aeonic . civilizations -or rather try to; they prat about with archetypal energies .they do not unders tand.. They confuse the forms and try to use some from one Aeon and some from another. Or they try and create their own. Or they are fundamentally so esoterically ignorant ·that they are infused with psuedo-mystical garbage and fanciful 'aeons' and extra-terrestrial beings and/or diabolic entities from obscure and worthless mythologies. The Satanist, having access to the real esoteric tradition, can work effective magick, both personally and Aeonically. Personally, it means working with the energies/magickal forms of the present Aeon as those energies/forms are. It means eschewing the distortion which has so affected the Aeon and its civilization. One aspect of this distortion is the 'Qabala'. Thus, any \"Satanist\" who uses any of the forms or symbo~s'or whatever of or deriving from this Qabala is aiding the distortion and thus in effect undermining Satanic energies/values. That most ~Satanists\" cannot se& this, just shows their lack of real esoteric understanding ­i.e. their lack of a genuine Satanic Initiation. One magickal form of the genuine Western tradition, is the septenary. Another is the understanding as 'Baphomet' as one name of the dark goddess -the Bride, Lover of Satan. Yet another is the knowledge of the real origins of both the word and the form of 'Satan' -from the Hellenic, to which the Western Aeonic civilization was loosely affiliated in its origins and growth, and from which certain esoteric traditions surVived. [The derivation of the word 'Satan' is from the Greek aL.La meaning 'accusation'. It became the Hebrew Satan, whence also (Shlaitian.] On the Aeonic level, the esoteric knowledge of Aeonics means the Satanist can judge what to do, and act both in the magickal and the practical sense. Aeonics shows that there has been and is a distortion in the Western energies, and that, given no distortion, the Destiny of the Western civilization was Empire -i.e. the triumph of 'Satanic' values on a world-wide basis for the benefit of an elite within the Western civilization. Aeonics also shows that it is possible at this moment in time to create a nexion and thus draw forth the energies of the next Aeon -to effectively create the next Aeonic civilization. Thus, effective courses of action are: (al aiding the creation of an Imperium; (bl countering the distortion in order to introduce new forms/ energies; (cl opening a nexion and thus aiding/creating a new Aeon, consciously [Heretofore, most Aeons have not been created via magickal intent because the knowledge to do so was lacking.].

(al involves disrupting present societies magickally and practically and aiding Imperium-like forces; (bl involves countering the Nazarene forms and those allied to it, and creating new forms and presencing them via indiViduals/groups/society etc. All involve aiding Satanic forces ­e.g. spreading Satanic ideas esoterically and exoterically; aiming to become/ gUiding others to become Adepts of Satanic traditions.

[There is a lovely quote ln 'Mein Kampf' about thlS, which you mlght be familiar wlth.] ­Basically, such people are soft -inside, where it matters. As one of the L enclosed MSS explains; \"Attaining real Adeptship is more difficult than belng selected for, and tralnlng with, a 'Special Forces' unlt (such ~s the Brltish SAS).\" In tradltional Satanism, the nOVlce has to undergo r cal rordeals WhlCh test their strength of character -overcome difflcult -physlcal challenges. They are expected to llve satanlcally ln the real-world (by, for example, fighting for an \"extreme Rlght-Wlng\" organlzatlon or belng [a vlgilante), as they must, if they wish to become Adepts, spend at least three months surviving in the wild, completely alone and without any of the comforts of urbanlzed llving.

Another reason, lS that It lS clear the dlstortlon whlch so affects the Faustlan Civllizatlon, has affected the Left Hand Path In general and Satanlsm In particular. In practical and maglckal terms, the Church of Satan was an lnfiltratlon of Satanlsm by the dlstortlon -l.e. by the splrlt of the Nazarene and those forms derived from the Nazarene (in terms of ethlcs, polltics and so on). The Temple of Set has slmply contlnued thls distortlon -affecting a few mlnor changes-i In structure and attltude, and that is all. Of course, not very many wlll understand what I have just wrltten regarding the distortion, and -.! I---even fewer wlll comprehend the Church of Satan as belonglng to the same world as the Nazarene.

It took, for lnstance, the carnal phllosophy and the morality of the strong, as well as some of the maglckal symbols/forms of the Left Hand Path. But a real Satanic lntent was never wlthln those forms; there was no real SatanlC-knowledge, no esoterlC knowledge or perspective. All the forms did was encourage a self-stupefactlon, a glorlficatlon of a puny ego, and a -llvlng-ln a psuedo-maglckal fantasy world wlth 'Satanic' rituals and conclaves and 'grottoes'. In short, all the Church of Satan and ltS verSlon of 'Satanlsm' did was encourage personal weakness, fetlshes, and a purblind hedonlstlc indlvldualism -as well as a religious mentallty: an obedlance to the 'Church' and a fawnlng upon its 'leader': In brlef,-it did not llberate, it dld not make strong -it did not encourage the creatlon of a new race who acted Satanically in the real world and so profoundly changed Lt. The Church of Satan was part of the distortlon, not-a cure for Lt. The Temple of Set contlnued what the Church had started. They took or trled to take thelr verSlon of Satanism into lntellectual realms -and, llke the Church, they had no understanding whatsoever of genulne esoterlC -Slnlster traditlon.

He or she is playing a part (adm~ttedly a small one -but such ~nd~v~duals have to start the~r Satanic careers somewhere! They have to do 'on-the-job training'!) -they are aware, because they are genu~ne satan~sts, of what they are do~ng: ~.e. they have a knowledge of s~nister strategy. They are aiding the collapse of a worthless society, and may also be aid~ng the weak ones (the add~cts) to cull themselves. They are also engender~ng a 'moral' response ~n others -e.g. in the Establishment. Some of those ~n th~s Establ~shment (e.g. Police Officers) galn real understanding by exposure to the dregs, the worthless: i.e. they develope a good instinct, from pract~cal exper~ence, and so see the druggles as dregs. Thus, they are r~pe for converSlon to a radical resurgence of noble values, politically expressed -for the sake of ~llustrat~on, let us say here a radical organ~zat~on of the extreme R~ght. They have seen the liberal/Nazarene society, and ~t does not work -~t produces dross; encourages vermin. And so on. Naturally, th~s is a s~mplified analysis, but at least the Satanic ~ntent of the original act -the drug-dealing -can be seen. Of course, the Satan~sts are few, and secret. But that does not mean they are 'powerless'! They seek to be the real mot~vators of change -both of themselves, and others, in terms of soc~ety, the c~vilizat~on, and the Aeon ~tself. Hence, they really are d~abolical, and s~nlster. And of course dangerous. The above is only one example -not all Satanists undertake such actlons as dealing in drugs. Some may ~nvolve themselves ~n aiding/creat~ng the politlcal form. Some may ~ndeed by the Pol~ce Officer. Or the Judge. Whatever. they all know what they are do~ng, ~n Aeon~c terms; they are all str~vlng to change ex~stence, and thus themselves, by act~ons ln the real world.

Yet all of christian history and of the TYrE of people who are attracted to christianity should tell us that such reli~ions are outside of nature -anti-nature because of a dis-ease certain TYrES feel with ther.lselv e15, shut off from .the 'Tree of Life' to put it in alle~rical terms. 'Setianism' is of course of recent origin -the result of a feud between Aquino and LaVey. Satanism goes back a bit before ~.t&anism a nd even before the Church of Satan, a nd even before ancient Egypt -its a reflection of man's understanding of the wcrkings of the cosmos. Nature is NOT a (onefold' static system. The flux, the dynamic evolution are a reflection of it -as Darwin saw, for example. ENolution, genetics, selection, etc. are operative w~THIN nature -basic school science. Nature consists of [polarities clashing and interacting -dialectics -responsible for change. This change in the cosmos is pBshed by what physicists call entropy -what 5atanists call Satan -in the Urient '~at.'(The All) and 'Tan' (the energizing r pri~iple or Dar~ Force behind it). X think I tried to explain this io a prior L lettert?). The ancients recognized this, the Tantrics saying 'Shaka without Shakti is \"a corpse' i.e. ~hiva the cosmos -~hakti the energizing element ­'Satan', 'entropy' the 'Dark force in nature' or whatever one wants to call it.

Thus, a recent Satanic Initiate -whether working alone or as a member of an established Order/Temple -would study the following works, and then strive to apply the principles contained in them in the way described. The works are: 1lThe Black Book of Satan;~Naos;~Hostia -Vols. I,ll, III~ Hysteron Proteron. 'Naos' would be used as a gUide to practical hermetic workings, both external and internal. The 'Black Book' would be used as a gUide to forming and running a Satanic Temple to perform ceremonial magick. 'Hostia' and 'Hysteron Proteron' would provide an insight into Satanic traditions and beliefs. In addition, the images of the Sinister Tarot would be employed (e.g. in some of the workings given in 'Naos') and the 'Deofel Quartet' might be read to provide additionalJ understanding, together with The Black Book II and III. Satanic practice in the real world would arise from (a) forming and running a Satanic Temple; and (b)undertaking Insight Roles and other Satanic tasks. Aside from a specific Insight Role, which the novice would choose, they would undertake the various physical challenges required [qv. the MS 'Adeptship -Its ..\t Real Meaning and Significance', for example] and strive to increase their experience by living Satanically in a way which aided the sinister dialectic. What these experiences were, they would decide after having studied the works mentioned and after having undertaken the tasks, ordeals and so on, up to..\t External Adept [qv. 'Naos', and the various MSS Guides to the Seven-Fold Way] ­e.g. having run a Temple for some months, and achieved the physical goals. One of the tasks might be to plan and undertake a culling. Anothe~ might.. be to aid Heretical forms by, for example, becoming involved with an extremistJ group which seeks the destruction of 'the System' and whose principles and aims are in accord with the Satanic ethos and whose actions aid the sinister dialectic. [ObViously, both of these could be combined.] Another might be to undermine present structures by fostering their decline -e.g. dealing in drugs. AnotherJ might be removing in a practical manner on a regular basis, the scum and the worthless -e.g. by vigilante action [this is culling performed on a regular basis rather than a 'one-off' event]. , ] What matters about these tasks is that the novice chooses them to gain practical experience of Satanism in action and thus increase their understanding and so aid their esoteric development. Naturally, to qualify as Satanic actions, they must aid the sinister dialectic -be steps toward realizing the strategic goal of Satanism. Here, an understanding of Aeonics is crucial, as is a genuine insight into traditional Satanism: as explicated, for example, in Hostia 1,11,111 and as explained to prospective novices in the booklet 'Satanism - A Basic Introduction for Prospective Adherents'. The choice of practical action is the novice's: they must use their.. understanding to select Satanic tasks. Occassionally, they might be givenJ advice, from a more experienced Satanist, but the final choices are and must be theirs. What matters is to choose and act. The acts are learning experiences, ordeals, and thus it does not matter if because of, say, a certain lack ofl understanding, a novice chooses, or seems to choose, wrongly. They will either learn from this, or not. If not, they have basically failed -shown themselves not to be s~itable. Whatever, their actions will have presenced the sinister in some way or ways. ] l Following these tasks -which should last for a few years -the novice then moves on to the next stage of their esoteric development, that of the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept. This is a rite of synthesis, and thus the emergence of the Adept. ] l"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"f [The Practical Esoteric Aims of Satanism: 90-130yf r The practical aims arise from Satanic strategy which has its foundation in Aeonics [qv. the various Aeonics and Cliology MSS -some of the most important are listed at the end of this MSS]. These aims are essentially r tactics to achieve the long~term strategic goal. This goal is the creation of a new species -and this means (a) a new Aeon; (b) a new aeonic civilization. ror this to be achieved, prsent structures, forms, ideas and so on, have to [changed. Aeonics shows that the present Aeonic civilization, the Western, has been distorted in its ethos and its structures. One of the most potent forms of the distortion has been the Nazarene religion. The distortion has been [ carried on, and effectively controlled, by 'Magian' forces -there has arisen various other forms to implement the distortion and effectively undermine .. the Destiny of the West -that is, the emergence of Imperium. These forms I \"­include communism/Marxism/socialism and the idea of 'liberal-democracy': they are all opposed to a racially aware Europe and the idea of Aryan/White superiority. This Aryan superiority would have formed the basis of Imperium ­[without it, Imperium is not possible. In essence, the ethos of the West has been changed from a Faustian/Promethean pagan one, which exulted in conquest and exploration, to a neurotic materialism •and a 'multi-racial' pacifist degeneracy. There has been a 'silent revolution' L in all Western societies and they all now conform to unhealthy Nazarene induced forms -the power structures of these societies now actively seek .. to eradicate all heretical pro-Promethean ideas/groups/individuals, and use the ) full force of the 'Law', as well as covert tact1cs, against those who hold '­out against the relentless onslaught to enslave the peoples of the West to what are essentially 'Magian' created ideas. Thus the campaigns, in Schools ­and throughout society, against \"racism\". To implement this Magian revolution, L a myth was created -'the Holocaust'. In most societies of the West, this myth is a sacred dogma -disbelief being punishable by imprisonment. -Because of all this, an Imperium is increasingly unlikely. The real -ie. L esoteric -aim of the Magian is a 'Messianic Kingdom' ruled over by this 'Magian' elite. This would be de-evolutionary, in the Aeonic sense, and -effectively wipe out the gains of all hitherto existing Aeonic civilizations. I..Essentially, the rule of 'Dogma' would hold sway, with terror to support this. This terror is already evident concerning the Holocaust and Aryan racism. The reasoned enlightenment, so evident in the Hellenic and Western ethos, would be displaced by a real despotism - a mentality akin to that imposed upon I the West by the medieval 'Witch-finders' and their dogmatic Nazarene zeal. The Magian is a synonym for the Zionists. I This brief overview of the current state of aeonic affairs enable the practical aims, to be achieved/striven toward, to be understood in context. Esoterically, traditional Satanism/the septenary, and thus its magick, is an expression of the Faustian ethos and thus the Western Aeon. The other forms of 'Western' magic(k) existing at this time -including the 'Satanism' of groups like the Temple of Set -are expressions of the Magian ethos (as is ­eVident, for example, in their use of Hebrew forms and the 'Qabalah'). Thus the actual 'magick' of these other groups/individuals is aiding the distortion. In practical terms, any magickal act, which does not use traditional Satanist/ • genuine Western forms (such as the septenary) is an action against the LreaSoned enlightenment that the Western Aeon represents. On the practical level, it is considered necessarY,in order to achieve strategir goals, to support the creation of a Western Imr~rium -that is, to [support those forces trying to undermine in a practical way the current Nazarene/Magian status quo. This means upholding heretical views such as racial inequality, and denying 'the Holocaust' -as well as aiding/supporting National-Socialist/\"racist\" causes. The tactical aim here is the creation of [ a pro-Aryan, National-Socialist type State which has a noble, conquering spirit"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"J or ethos, and thus which re-presents Satanic values in action in the real world. An alternative aim is the emergence of a 'religious' form for this , same noble, conquering ethos. In addition, whatever means are necessary ~o undermine and thus destroy the present status quo must be used. This means disrupting societies ­supporting armed insurrection, spreading heretical ideas, aiding those groups/ forms which weaken societies from within (in the moral sense -e.g. drug­1\t dealing) and thus engendering a healthy, noble resurgence. A primary aim is to cause chaos, on the streets, economically, and socially -to thus provide opportunities for a revolutionary pro-Aryan group to take or seize power.J\t A magickal and practical aim is to destroy the power structure of America ­for that country effectively is acting to maintain a global control in accord with Magian dictates and thus impose the Magian world-view. The real power J ~ of the Magian heart-land resides in America and in the control excercised in the minds of Europeans by the idea of 'multi-racialism' and the myth of the holocaust. If the pres~nt power structure of America was destroyed, the practical power-base, both financial and military, of the Magian heart-land (ie. Israel)j would collapse -what has prevented the destruction of this heart-land by the Arabs is the military superiority given to it by America. No country has ever been able or is able to supply superior weapons to any Arab state not1 under American control -not the former Soviet Union, not China. America has -j secretly threatened any country which seems about to do so -and threatened both economically and militarily. Any country which poses a real threat to.Magian lands has been dealt with -e.g. Iraq. With the fall of this heart-land, the Messianic dream of the Magian would be unrealizable. j The next Aeon will be determined by the success or failure of these tactics. That is, for the next Aeon to emerge, and thus for the next Aeonic civilization to arise in around five centuries time, it is necessary toJ destroy the distortion affecting the present Aeon. Failure to do this will mean J the emergence of that civilization will be much delayed -by up to at least a thousand years. Further, the success of the tactics, and the emergence of an Imperium, means the spread of the present civilization beyond the confines of the Earth -out into Space. This is possible now, and only now, due to the inventiveness of the creative minority within the civilization and the technology to implement thatj\t in a practical way. A defeat would mean a hiatus, and thus a starting from the beginnings -effectively, the achievements of this Aeon would be wiped out. [ I 000 Traditional Satanism is fundamentally pan-Aeonic: ie. concerned with the patterns and processes which are perceived, in the causal, as Aeons and Aeonic j\t civilizations. However, to effect changes in the causal, actions of individuals and groups (and this includes magickal acts) must work with things as those things are -as they are presenced in causal time at particular causal times. The reality of aeonic energies is that they assume causal form in aeonic civilizations,j\t and that at anyone millenia, only one civilization is aeonically significant. Therefore, aeonic magick is a working with the aeonic energies presenced in the particular civilization at the time of that magickal act(s) -or a workingl against those energies. Anything else is not Aeonic magick -ie. is not effective on the aeonic level: it is purely personal, external, magick. The present Aeon is the Western -and this Aeon dates from c.500 eh to c.2000eh-in terms of the energies being predominant. The aeonic civilization follows some centuries later: for the West, arising c. 900 eh and ending c. 2400eh. The energies of the next Aeon follow or arise some centuries after the last Aeonic -I ones: in ~ractic~his means at the end of the civilization of the last Aeonc; when ~ the Imperium is collapsing. Thus, the new Aeonic manifestations will arise c.2400eh. -I"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":", L r In the past, Aeons arose as part of the unconscious process of dialectical -change. However, we are now at the stage of evolutionary understanding when we can alter the process itself because of that conscious understanding which Aeor.ics, cliology and so on, gives us. That is, we can significantly alter the process of aeonic evolution and thus the civilization which gives form and reality to aeonic energies. The time for such change is when the energies of one aeon are waning, and the energies of the next aeon have not arisen in any significant way. Left to themselves the aeonic energies would have produced a Western Imperium which would have lasted from c. 1990eh-c.2450eh. A new aeonic civilization would then have arisen c.3000eh, and lasted for c. a thousand ­and more years. The reality of aeonic magick means that one must work either with the -energies of the Western energies -and thus aid/create an Imperium -or that one works against those energies. At this moment in causal time, no other energies of aeonic type are prevelent on Earth, and no other cultures/ • civilizations are significant in evolutionary terms. [This statement of reality will not please many.] Thus, the only practical options for significant magickal work are the ones given above: aiding Imperium (and thus countering the distortion) or working ­against the creation of Imperium (and thus aiding the distortion). The former ,option is continuing the evolutionary trend -ie. presencing the sinister; ­1 creating a dynamic imperative and thus aiding exploration/conquest/discovery. ­The latter option is de-evolutionary-ie. is aids those forces which by their nature are restrictive in both the short and the long term. The former is r ,a moving-on; the latter, a dogmatic standstill and then a recession. Of course, the majority of non-Initiates see things differently -they view the ­distortion as 'progressive' and those arranged against it (e.g. NS type forces) as regressive/reactionary/primative and so on. Such people have not only failed rto perceive the essence of things veiled by their outer transient forms, but -also have abandoned rational thought and judgement for abstract idealism arising from sentiment. The majority of such people who view the situation in this r sentimental idealistic way, are simply victims of the distortion itself ­• products of the unhealthy societies which esteem verbiage and clever psuedo­intellectuals concepts above judgement based on experience and real insight. Initiation implies a development of real insight and judgement -and [ a learning of genuine esoteric knowledge. The esoteric knowledge of Satanism, hitherto secret by nature because it was and is heresy, is essentially a knowledge of Aeonics -of those factors governing evolution/change from aeons to individuals. One insight of a Satanic Initiate is into the forms and structures I assumed by aeonic energies in the causal. This insight means that a genuine Initiate understands a transient form such as 'National-Socialism' as a practical expression of some of the principles of I Satanism and as, in the long-term, contributing to evoluionary change via its inherent dynamism and acceptance of the forces of Nature. Such an Initiate understands that, at this moment in aeonic history, such a form is necessary: ie. this form (or something very similar) and only this form presences the sinister in the way that sinister must be presenced to achieve the strategic goal of Satanism over centuries. ..The current practical concerns of traditional Satanism lie thus with the Western civilization -with aiding those forms which can or do presence the sinister, or which will change societies to the benefit of the sinister. The tactics are geared to this. Thus, an encouragement of Islam in certain Arab states may be a tactic used -because Islam acts to discourage the 'American' materialism which would otherwise flourish, and thus offsets 'American' (read covert Zionist) influence. This in itself poses problems for America and thus the Magian. [However, the aeonic or essential reality, is that Islam is a transient form which like all religions enshrines the dogmatic, anti-evolutionary ethos, and while in the very long-term the goal is enlightenment or Adept-like liberation and thus L understanding for everyone, the practical reality means that a working with this"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"~ I 1 1 ~ I ~ I .. I .. .. j j J J I I l l l ] ] 1 particular transient form is tactically right, in order to achieve the goals connected with the present Western civilization and thus the establishment of a new Aeon. The reality is that there are no easy, idealistic options. A genuine insight and understanding of aeonic matters means certain judgements have to be made: certain tactics have to be employed in order to achieve anything. Satanism is concerned with real, meaningful changes in the real world: it is not concerned with mystical or psuedo-mystical world-views and impractical idealisms. In a fundamental sense, Satanism is pragmatic -aeonically. The present reality is as stated above -no amount of 'wishful thinking' or idealism or sentiment will change this. One either aids aeonic change and thus contributes toward evolutionary change, or one does not. On the magickal level, as well as aiding the forces of Imperium and countering the distortion, acausal energies can be presenced to begin the process that is the next Aeon. That is, a nexion can be created, consciously, and the acausal energies consciously directed into temporal forms, some of which will be 'magickal'. This is in addition to aiding the present aeonic forms. In effect, these new acausal energies will create the next Aeon and thus its associated aeonic civilization. This creation is the 'esoteric' Satanic goal of Satanic Adepts -the 'exoteric' goal can be considered to be aiding Imperium and thus fulfilling the wyrd of the West (and hence countering the distortion). In reality -ie. viewed from beyond the opposites inherent in causal forms -the esoteric and exoteric goals are essentially the same: or rather, different expressions of the same things, that is, sinister or acausal energy presenclng in.the causal and thus creating evolutionary change. However, this 'differentiation' into esoteric and exoteric goals is useful since its enables the tactics to be understood. Viewed another way, the exoteric goal is the short-term esoteric strategy, and the esoteric goal is the long-term esoteric strategy.

J ] The Left Handed Path -An Analysis ONA The Left\t Handed Path and Satanism are related insofar as Satanism is a]\t particular LHP. The LHP is the name given to describe a system of esoteric knowlecge and practical techniques -and this system is also known as 'The Black Arts'.] The Difference Between the Left and Right Hand Paths: The aim of all genuine Occult paths or systems, whether designated Right]\t Hand or Left-Hand, is to achieve or find a certain goal -as well as to impart esoteric knowledge and abilities. The goal is variously described (e.g. 'Gnosis', the Philosopher's Stone, Enlightenment).] However, it has been a common misconception that the RH Paths were altruistic and the LH Paths egocentric -i.e. the difference between them was seen in individual moral terms. Another misconception is in seeing the difference in absolute moral terms -i.e. the RH Paths as representing \"good\" and the LH Paths] as \"evil\". Recently, attempts have been made to formulate 'grey' paths which combine elements of both, and such 'grey' paths are often said (by their exponents) to be the \"true\" Occult way or path.] The reality is qUite different. The LH Paths and the RH Paths [hereafter, the singular 'Path' will be used, although the plural is to be understood] are qUite distinct and differ in both their methods and their aims. The most fundamental]\t difference is that the RHP is restrictive -certain things are forbidden or frowned upon -and collective. That is, the RHP takes some responsibility away from the individual by having a formal dogma, a code of ethics and behaviour and by having the individual participate in an organized grouping, however loose]\t that grouping may be. In brief, the identity of the individual is to some extent taken away -by the beliefs -systems which that individual has to accept, and by them accepting some higher 'authority', be such authority an individual, a group] or an 'ideology' (or even, sometimes, a supra-personal Being - a 'god' or 'gods'). In contradistinction, the LHP in its methods is non-structured. In the genuine ,] LHP there is nothing that is not permitted -nothing that is forbidden or restricted. That is, the LHP means the indiVidual takes sale responsibility for their actions and their quest. This makes the LHP both difficult and dangerous -its methods can be used as an excuse for anti-social behaviour as they can be used to aid the fetishes and weaknesses of some individuals as well as lead some into forbidden and illegal acts. However, the genuine Initiate of the LHP is undertaking a quest, and as such is seeking something: ...\t that is, there is a dynamic, an imperative about their actions as well as the conscious understanding and appreciation that all such actions are only a part of that quest; they are not the quest itself. This arises because the LHP Initiate is seeking mastery and self-knowledge -these being implicit in such ... an Initiation. Accordingly, the LHP Initiate sees methods as merely methods; experience as merely experience. Both are used, learned from and then discarded. Because of this, the LHP is by its nature ruthless -the strong of character win through, the weak go under. There are no 'safety nets' of any kind on the LHP -there is no dogma or ideology to rely on, no one to provide comfort and soften the blOWS, no organization, individual or 'Being' to run to when things1\t get difficult and which will provide support and sympathy and understanding. Or which, just as importantly, takes away the responsibility of the Initiate for their deeds. The LHP breeds self-achievement and self-excellence -or its destroys, either literally, or Via delusion and madness. further, the goal or aim of the LHP is individual specific -it is ~he raising of that individual to 'god-head'; the fulfilment of individual potential and thus a discovery and fulfilment of their unique Destiny. That is, it breeds a unique... I -oJ"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"-• character, a unique individual. The RHP, on the contrary, is concerned with 'idealistic' and thus supra-personal aims -aiding 'society', 'humanity' and so on: the individual is 're-made' by abstract and impersonal forms. •The LHP by its nature means that its Initiates work mostly on their own. Followers of the LHP are masters of their as yet unmanifest Destiny. And while they may accept gUidance and advice, they eschew any form of subserviance: they learn for themselves, by their own experience and from their own ­self-effort. This is crucial to an understanding of the true nature of the LHP. The LHP means this self-reliance, this self-experience, this self-effort, this personal struggle for achievement. The RHP means someone else -some • individual, or some authority or some hierarchy -awards or confers upon the RHP Initiate a sign or symbol of their \"progress\". That is, the RHP Initiate assumes the role of student, or 'chela' -and often that of sycophant. They rely • on someone else or something beyond themselves, whereas the LHP Initiate relies only on themselves: their cunning, skill, character, desire, intelligence and so on. The successful LHP Initiate is the individual who learns from their own experiences and mistakes. The RHP Initiate tries to learn from theory -from what • others have done. Essentially, the LHP Initiate is a free spirit, already possessed of a certain wilful character, while the RHP Initiate is in thrall to other people's ideas • and ways of doing things. The notion of self-responsibllity is as mentioned above, crucial to the LHP and accordingly any organization which claims to be of the LHP and which does •not uphold this in both theory and practice is a fraudulent organization. In practice this means that an organization does not restrict the experiences of its members -it does not, for instance, impose upon them any binding authority which the members have to accept or face 'expulsion' just as it does not • lay down for them any codes of behaviour or ethics. That is, it does not promulgate a dogma which the members have to accept as it does not require those members to be obediant to what the hierarchy says. There is no \"proscription\" • of certain views, or individuals or other organizations as there is no attempt to make members conform in terms of behaviour, attitudes, views, opinions, expressions or anything else. If there are any of these things, the organization so doing these things is most certainly not an organization of the Left Hand • Path even though it may use some of the motifs, symbols and methods of the LHP. Such an organization is instead allied to the RHP in nature -in the effect it has upon its .embers. • In summary, the RHP is soft. The LHP is hard. The RHP is like a comfortable game -and one which can be played, left for a while, then taken up again. I The LHP is a struggle which takes years. The RHP prescribes behaviour and limits personal responsibility. The LHP means self-responsibility and self-effort. The RHP requires the individual to conform in certain way. The LHP is non-restrictiVE( RHP organizations and 'teachers' require the Initiate to conform and accept the authority of that organization/'teacher'. LHP organizations and Masters/ Mistresses only offer advice and gUidance, based on their own experience. • . Satanism: As mentioned above, Satanism is a particular LHP. Conventionally, and incorrectly, Satanism is described as 'worship of Satan/the DeVil'. The word 'Satan' originally derived from the Greek word for 'an accusation'. That is, Satan is an archetype of disruption -the Adversary who challenges the accepted, who defies -who desires to know. In essence, Satan is a symbol of dynamic motion: the generative or moving force behind evolution, change. In reality, Satan is both symbolic or archetypal, and real. That is, He eXists within the psyche of indiViduals, dnd beyond indiViduals. l Satanism is, in part, the acceptance of the necessity of change -of the reality of things like struggle, combat, war, creativity, indiVidual geniUS, defiance\" Of the evolutionary and puritive nature of these things. But Satanism is much more l •"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"] than the acceptance of the reality of these things -of their necessity. It is also the individual seeking to be like Satan -to be Satanic. A true Satanist does not worship some Being called Satan. Rather, a Satanist accepts the reality of Satan [on all levels] and quests to become, in their own life and beyond, a type of Being of the same kind as Satan -that is, to change their own evolution and that of others: to evolve to a new type of existence. The eXistence can be described by what is known as 'Satan'. This quest is a dynamic and real one, and it means that those who aspire to follow the way of Satanism go further than others who merely follow the LHP. That is,J Satanism leads to new areas of being: it goes beyond 'the Black Arts' while having its foundation or ground in those Arts. Part of this is a greater esoteric knowledge(e.g. Aeonic Magick) and part in techniques or methods or create· a new individual. The Satanist effectively' learns to play at beingJ god. Since Satanism, ?s described above, involves the individual questing to become like Satan, it is relevant to consider who and what Satan is.J Satan is the Prince of Darkness -Master of all that is hidden or secret, both within ourselves and external to ourselves. He is the ruler of this world ­the force behind its evolutionary change; the 'fire' of life. He is Lord of• Life -of all the sensual delights and pleasures. He is also 'evil' or 'dark' or 'sinister' -merciless, ruthless, Master of Death. He can and does promote suffering, misery, death. But all these things are impersonal -they are natural consequences of life, of change and evolution. Satan, by His nature,cannot be 'bribed' or 'propitiated' -and neither can His services be bought, by a \"pact\" or anything else. He is not interested in such futile things. Thus, there can be no such thing as a 'religious'• Satanism -the offering of prayers or offerings or promises or whatever in return for Satanic favours. Such things imply fear, subserviance and those other traits of character Satan despises. Rather, the satanic approach is•to glory in Satanic deeds and chants and such like because they are Satanic ­I ~\t because by so doing them there is an exultation, an affirmation and a being like Satan: not because something is 'expected' or done out of fear of the consequences. It is by living life, by deeds, that a Satanist becomes like -Satan and so evolves to partake of a new and higher eXistence. Such deeds are those to bring insight, self-discovery, to achieve, esoteric knowledge, experience of the 'forbidden', of the pleasures of living -and they are-also those which change others and the world and which thus can and do bring suffering, misery, death: which are, in short, evil. Furthermore, Satan is a real Being -He is not simply a symbol, archetypal or otherwise, of certain natural forces or energies. He has life, eXists -causesL-things to occur -external to our own, individual psyche. That is, our individual wills, or even our individual magick, cannot control Him [as the softee imitation Satanists like to believe]. However, this 'life' is not 'human' -it is not bound by a body or even by our causal time and space. Expressed esoterically, it is acausal. Satan, however, is not alone -that is, He is not the only Dark, sinister Being-who affects our world and thus eXistence. He has a female counter-part ­a Mistress, Lover, Bride. Esoterically, Her name is Baphomet. She is the Dark Goddess... Thus, a Satanic Initiate is often described as the lover of one or both of J these sinister entities -and a genuine Satanic Initiation may be likened to a ritual copulation with either Satan or Baphomet [where the Priest/Priestess .. assumes the form of the entity]. In genuine Satanism there is no 'worship' of I Satan (or BaphometJ -but rather an acceptance of Them as friends, lovers (or, in the early stages, sometimes a 'father' and 'mother' or a brother and siste' A Satanist thus evolves toward a higher form -and expresses conscious... evolution in\t action. Hence, Satanism is the qUintessence of the Left Hand Path."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"• • L ,,, • Evil: It is a mistake, recently promulgated by some, to see the LHP in general and Satanism in particular as merely a body of esoteric knowledge and/or a collection of rituals or magickal workings, either of which, or both, may be 'dipped into' for personal edification and to provide oneself with an 'image'. All LH Paths are ordeals -they involve self-effort over a period of years. They are 3lso dark, and involve the individuals who follow them going to and beyond the limits all societies impose. That is, they are sinister or 'evil'. They involve real sinister acts in the real world -not a playing at sorcerers or sorceresses. • Certain individuals and certain organizations who claim to belong to the LHP have tried to dispel the 'evil' that surrounds the LHP and Satanism -by denying the very real ~vil nature of these paths. However, what do these imitation Satanists, these posturing pseuds, think Satanism is if not 'eVil'? If Satanism is not eVil, what is? [Or, more precisely, if Satan is not eVil, who is?] The true nature of evil -and thus Satanism and the LHP -has been misunderstood. EVil is natural and necessary -it tests, culls, provokes reaction and thus aids evolution. And to repeat -Satanism is replete with eVil: it is eVil. Satanists are sinister, eVil. They cannot but be otherwise. • EVil, correctly defined, is part of the cosmic dialectic -it is force, which is a-moral: i.e. it is beyond the bounds of 'morals'. Morals derive from a a limited (human -or, rather, psuedo-human) perspective, and a morality is a projection by individual consciousness onto reality. Nothing that is 'moral' or immoral eXists. All morals are therefore artifice -they are abstractions. Actions, by indiViduals, which are normally considered as 'eVil' are things that are done by indiViduals against others -that is, evil acts are conSidered • as belonging to us, as a species. It is not considered 'eVil' for a tiger to kill and eat a person: that is natural, in the nature of the tiger. What has been and generally is considered to be eVil, in humans, is in general nothing ­more than instinct -or rather, a feeling, a pre-conscious desire or desires. Such instinct is natural -the actions which result from it can be either beneficial or not. That is, the actions are not 'evil' in themselves. They should not be judged by some artifical abstractions, but rather by their consequences -by their effects, which are either positive or negative. However, they can be POSitive or negative depending on circumstances: that is, the evaluation of them can vary depending on the perspective chosen.This persepctive is usually that of 'time'. The only correct judgement about a particular act or action is one which takes into account the effects of that action not only in the present but also in the future, and this latter on a vast time-scale. Thus, the jUdgement concerning such acts is essentially a-personal -it bears little or no resemblance to the emotional affects of that act in the moments of that act or in the immediate moments follOWing that act. [In the symbolic sense ­and impreCisely -such judgement could be said to be that of 'the gods'.] Real acts of evil are those which are done consciously -and these can be of two kinds. The first are ignorant acts: done from a lack of self-knowledge and usually With no appreCiation of their effects beyond the moment. The second are impersonal acts done with a knowledge of the effects beyond that of the moment. The former involve no evaluation beyond the personal feelings; the latter • I•(I •involve an evaluation beyond the personal (although they may still be personal acts -i.e. of benefit to the individual). A Satanic act of evil is of this ­second kind -they are affective and effective: a participation in the cosmic dialectic. At first, they may not be fully understood -i.e. arise from instinct in the main. But the Satanic intent behind them makes the indiVidual more conscioUS, ­more aware of their effects, both personal and supra-personal, thus enabling judgement to be cultivated. [ Instinctive acts are not 'evil' -they usually derive from immaturity. Evil 3Ct~ derive from maturity _ but immaturity is reqUired to reach this stage. That is, the~~ is a growth. 'Morality' tries to stifle instinct and thus restricts growth. SataniCacts of evil in effect redress the balance - and allow real maturity to develope. 000"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"l ] Introduction to the 'Deofel Quartet' The works collected under the title 'The Deofel Quartet' were written as Instructional Texts for members of a Black Magick group. As such, they deal with certain esoteric matters relevant to Novices and those who have begun to follow the path of Black Magick and Satanism. l while the form chosen is fictional, it is not that of a 'conventional' novel. Instead, a new vehicle was created with the aim of combining a fast (and thus entertaining) pace with a narrative style that not only required the imaginative participation of the reader, but which also saught to1 involve their unconscious. Thus, detailed descriptions -of, for instance, characters and locations -are for the most part omitted. It is left to the reader to supply such 'missing details': partly from their imagination] and partly unconsciously, from their own expectations and 'projections'. This form also had the added advantage of making the works interesting l to listen to when read aloud in a group considered as an extended 'prose poem'. While each work is self-contained they all deal with the varying insightsl darker path to esoteric enlightenment, [i.e. real-life] experiences which form setting. This new form may be in terms of 'plot' and 'characters', attained by those following the as well as with those practical the basis of genuine magickal l training and which explicate real sinister magick in action. Each work deals with (although not always exclusively) with a certain type of magickal/archetypal energy -and thus each is connected with one of the spheres of the septenary Tree of wyrd.

It also deals with the Dark Gods -describing them and the magick which•\t returns them to Earth. Of all the MSS of the Quartet, it is the most easily understood, although it does contain some hidden/esoteric meanings. These, however, are qUite explicable since the perspective of the MS is overtly Satanic.• Temple of Satan: . This' also has an overtly magickal setting, but deals with the• stage beyond that of a novice: i.e. someone who has been involved for some time and who has developed certain magickal skills -e.g. manipulation. Melanie is the archetypal Satanic Priestess: sexually alluring, using her •\t sexuality to manipulate and captivate, enjoying some delicate pleasures (e.g. sadism). But, as a true Satanist, after some time she becomes bored by the routine. So unconsciously at first, she seeks after something else: and is drawn toward Thurstan, against her better Satanic judgement. She• is \"drawn\" because she still has to gain a deep self-understanding -because there are still aspects which remain unconscious and powerful in her psyche (relating to the 'numinous' power of love etc.). Gradually, she falls•\t in love -but is she herself being manipulated toward this by Saer? And if so, why? [Consider the crystal he left with Thurstan for her to find and read.] Saer is 'beyond the Abyss' -an image/symbol of aeonic magick as •\t against Melanie's external and internal magick. This love causes the loss of her magick. But she gradually understands its purpose -to propel her toward the next stages of the sinister journey, and to provide a child who because of• her own sinister abilities and the apparently non-sinister abilities of Thurstan will have special qualities. That is, the child will be beyond opposites (as, e.g., symbolized by Melanie and Thurstan). Toward the end,•\t Melanie is presented with a choice -love, or her duty/destiny. She chooses the latter, and her magick is restored. Claudia is a complication for Melanie - a further test/distraction. Does her love cause her lover's death? Pead and Jukes, representing old aeon magick, , [ try to keep Melanie and Thurstan apart -because without him she cannot fulfil her Satanic wyrd: i.e. move on to the next stages and thus undertake aeonic magick, to the detriment of the old order and 'the light'. The Giving: This MS has several esoteric strands, and several overt meanings.•\t Lianna is a Mistress of Earth (note: stages beyond Melanie in 'Temple') and it is her duty to undertake The Giving -rite of sacrifice. As a Satanic Mistress, Lianna uses magick in a subtle way, as befits her status. This magick is esoteric (e.g. empathic) but she also directly manipulates others,• although in a subtle way. Consider how she draws/attracts Thorold to her: sending Sidnal to him with books, visiting his shop as a customer Lianna requires two important things: an opfer, and someone to father her heir.•\t The MS describes her attaining these goals. Mallan is a recent initiate -enjoying as all good Initiates should, overt magick and evil. He involves Rhiston in his games. Lianna however presents Mallam with a choice -finely and subtlely presented. She advises him that his -activities are not conducive to further advancement, for she understands --"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"i l •he has become ensnared by some of his desires, rather than enjoying them and then discarding them to rise beyond them and so attain self-insight and mastery. However, he sees her hints 'morally' -he mis-interprets them because he cannot see what she is trying to do; i.e. he shows no Satanic insight.The reader is shown this from Mallam's perspective -like Mallam, a certain discernment is required to see beyond the outer appearence to the essence. [This sudden change of perspective occurs in the MS several times, as it does many times in other parts of the Quartet. The reader should often ask: what is really going on here? A critical judgement is required because often the characters and what they may do/say are not what they seem: i.e. •the real intent/magick is hidden.] As it is, Mallam's lack of insight means he believes Lianna is making a 'moral' point, and he openly breaks with her. Following this decision by Mallam, Lianna provides him with a test, a new • opportunity to prove his worth or otherwise. She sends her Guardian, Imlach, to him -unknown to Mallam, of course -with a secret MS. Again, Mallam fails to realize what is happening -he cannot 'see through' Imlach. Instead, • he is overwhelmed by unconscious desires: material greed, lust for power. Rather than controlling, and using his desires for some purpose, he lets his desires control him. S he goes to Lianna's village -and again fails, •because he does not recognize the young woman as a Priestess of Lianna's tradition: he sees her as dull, easily manipulated. Thus, he shows he has i ~ no genuine magickal insight or abilities. !hence he becomes a candidate for sacrifice. Basically, he chooses himself ­• he is not chosen because of his \"evil\" activities. They merely provide a fail-safe to deflect attention from his disappearence (when the rite is Icompleted): no one in 'conventional' society would miss him/mourn him or • worry about his disappearence. Lianna also tests/manipulates Thorold. Does she also manipulate Monica? Or is she genuinely annoyed when Thorold becomes involved with Monica? Is •this a further test of Thorold? Certainly, for Lianna, Monica' death or removal is necessary -or seems to be. Lianna has drawn Thorold into her world -and changes him, for he is captivated by her: in a sense, in her power. He has qualities which she judged would make him a suitable person • to father her child. The MS ends with an unasked question: what is to be Thorold's fate when his purpose has been achieved? That is, when he has fathered her child. Will [ he be an opfer, or will he become part of her tradition? Clues to the answer are given at various points in the MS. Also, is Lianna a Satanist? Certainly, she does not seem to be -there are no 'Satanic' rites, no invokations I to Satan. At one point she says she belongs to an older tradition. Does she say this for a reason? -To deceive? She certainly represents a primal darkness: and is a genuine Mistress of Earth ... This raises the question as to what genuine Satanism really is: a question answered, in fact, by Lianna's actions I as described in the MS from its beginnings to its end. The Greyling Owl: This is the most esoteric and therefore the most difficult MS • to understand -at a first reading -and when viewed by conventional/accepted ideas of Satanism/Black Magick. It shows real magick in action on several levels: manipulation, empathic, .. forms (e.g. music), images, and via opening psychic nexions within individuals. Essentially, the MS deals with the changes wrought in the lives of Mickleman and Alison, and how these are made to aid the sinister dialectic -i.e. sinister • aeonic strategy, to aid the presencing of sinister energies in the causal and so bring/provoke change to the benefit of the sinister, aiding evolution. [ The magick here is that appropriate to an Internal Adept and beyond, while the energies described (the outer form) are symbolic of a particular sphere on the Tr~­of Wyrd (Mercury), although other energies are sometimes involved/intrude. l"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"1 ] This magick is far removed from external magick and thus rituals/robes. This magirk means a working with individuals as those in~ividuals are - a subtle1 re-orientation of their consciousness/lives. 1 Mickleman is gradually changed, and brought into an influencial position ­the Professorship -without him realizing this is occuring, in the magickal sense at least. He believes he is still in control of his own Destiny -and 1 it is important not to undermine this belief, except insofar as a certain self­insight is obtained. He must have this assurence of his abilities, this confidence, to fulfil what is his 'hidden' wyrd. He becomes aware, on terms he can cope with/is familar with [this is important], of certain archetypal aspects which will be important for his future professional development/ standing. These aspects, by which he will influence others in a non-magickall way by 'seeding their minds', will aid the sinister dialectic. Part of this would be through academic work (aided by the insights attained during his 'manipulation') and part by his own life-style: his 'decadent' past and J his future deriving from that past -both would influence others, providing l inspiration, and thus changing others in certain ways. Alison also is changed -realizing the power of music to transform. Again, her aims, dreams, hopes etc. are described from her own perspective, from her own 'moral' view of the world. However, her fundamental insights are 'provoked' via the subtle magick/influence of Edmund etc. Further, the future forms she creates/uses, while having the appearence of conventional forms (and perhaps I a moral content), will achieve and aid the sinister [ or at least most/some-of them will]. She herself will see her aims in terms of her own perspective: often 'morally', without fully realizing what she and her work are achieving ­opening nexions, and presencing dark energies to influence/infect others. This arises because she has been influenced/directed by magick in a specific way: to access a certain nexion within her own psyche. [All this is a very important notion to understand -and marks the insight appropriate to those1 who aspire to go beyond the stage of novice. It reflects genuine magick in action.) Her thoughts/action etc. (as others) are often 'morally' described. The dark interior life of both Edmund and Fiona (and thus their real aims) are hidden -i.e. not overt, as generally befits a Master and a Mistress. Such Adepts generally work esoterically -they do not fit conventional 'Satanic' role-models. In their different ways, Edmund and Fiona live in the ordinary world in an 'ordinary' way -they are real shape-changers who blend] into their surroundings. This enables them to work sinister magick effectively. Further, Edmund possesses no trappings normally assumed to be part of his station -he has no wealth, no power, no obvious influence. His Satanic powerI is internal, hidden -it is insight, wisdom, magickal skill of a rare kind. This skill enables him to work magick on others (and thus the world) as those others are -in the confines of their own roles/image for the most I part. Fiona's magickal work is often more overt -e.g. using her sexuality to advantage, but her real magick is still hidden. Thus the MS describes real Adepts at work. 0000000 A Note Concerning 'Breaking the Silence Down': This MS is often regarded as making the Quartet into a Quintet. It is similar in its magick to the Greyling Owl -although the background is Sapphism. Basically, Diane -who already possesses an intuitive awareness of primal darkness and thus Satan ism -is led toward self-discovery and a magickal partnershl"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"She has an insight into the female persona/strength (after the attempted rape) and discovers the power of music to capture the essence hidden by appearence. She is seduced by Rachael, who uses music (her piano playing) as a magickal act. Apthone is the archetypal immature product of this age and its societies: swayed by desires, and using petty manipulation to achieve lowly goals. When he becomes a threat to Diane, he is dealt with by those who desire her, magickally and sexually (Rachael and Watts). Is his accident purely chance? Or is someone, or two, watching over Diane? In the end, Rachael wins Diane. She is an hereditary sorceress -carrying on her grandmother's tradition (thus missing a generation: Rachael's mother). This tradition thrives in a certain part of the countryside near where Diane lives. As in 'Greyling',. the perspective is often that of the character involved: i.e. events/thoughts etc. are seen through their eyes, with their (often moral and conventional) understanding/attitudes. This gives an'reciation and understanding of these people as they are -and how magic :fects them, •usually without them being aware of it. It requires the r ~r to suspend and transcend conventional Satanic/sinister notions (which _e often only the outer form of what is Satanic/sinister rather than its ~ssence).

Dieter and his comrades did not move as the carrier bore them and the body toward the Ploetzensee cemetry. Zhukov's Red Horde was near and Dieter imagined he could hear small-arms fire in the brief pauses between shell, rocket and bomb. Despite the explosions, no one ran along the streets, and a tired Volksturm guard waved the troop carrier through the intersection. Nearby, young boys in Hitler Jugend uniform worked cheerfully, digging a trench parallel to a lane of twisted, torn trees. Their leader spoke, but Dieter heard nothing except another shell burst nearby. For a few seconds the boys stood silent, their caps removed, as the carrier passed. Sturmscharfuhrer Hermann acknowledged their respect with a salute. Sorensen's coffin was made from empty ammunition crates and Dieter helped lower them and their body into the grave. The symbolism seemed fitting for a man who had fought for three years on the Russian front, always with his machine-pistol dangling on a lanyard around his neck. Dieter's eulogy was brief: \"Bright and glorious that warrior's Destiny who in battle-array stands for his children and home, stands for the woman of his heart, bravely opposed to the foe.

The young machine-gunner in the dug-out beside Dieter was dead and he rolled the bloody body away before quickly changing the clogged barrel of the gun. Hermann fed the ammunition belt until. without a sound, he slithered down the trench, shot in the head. The tank riders were crawling closer but Dieter held their advance with Hermann's sub-machine gun while through the smoke filled street another tank lurched toward him. Soon, Dieter had no more ammunition, the men in the dug-outs behind him were dead and he began to throw bricks, stones and anything else he could find before scrambling back to find a weapon with which to kill. From the still warm hand of one his dead comrades he took a Mauser pistol but had no time to aim. The shell from the tank exploded near him knocking him over before burying him under earth, rubble and wood. Dieter awoke to consciousness to hear the crackling of a nearby fire and the distant explosions of battle; to smell burning wood and flesh, and to see above him framed by the crack of light, a large brown rat. No voices reached him and when he clawed his way cautiously into the light he could see no human movement along the street.

To prove this, we will consider each of these things in turn -first, the question of an 'Infernal Mandate', and then the question of Satanism as a Religion. Aquino maintains he has a 'sacred duty' because of the mandate, and that • this mandate gives him authority to consecrate his Priesthood. Further, he claims that only this Priesthood is truely consecrated to the Prince of Darkness. What this means in practice, is that the Temple of Set has set itself up to •be the unique representative of Satanism. In reality, Aquino claims to have received a Mandate during some magickal L working and thereby claims authority. A genuine Satanist, on the contrary, has authority by virtue of his or her Wisdom -and has achieved Wisdom by virtue of •practical experience. There is no need to claim a 'spiritual' authority given L by some 'entity' real or imagined be that entity Satan or Set or whatever. Indeed, to so claim such authority via an entity external to oneself exposes •the person who so makes the claim as needing this spiritual crutch because they Llack real Wisdom -that is, they rely on something external to themselves, something external to their own achievements. Such an individual has to rely on •something external because what really matters is missing -what is missing is that which is created by the following of the Black Arts to the ultimate ending. That is, direct practical experience and the mastery and wisdom which are thereby won. · A genuine Satanic Master (or Mistress) does not need to pose -they do not L need to claim they have a mandate. The authority of a real Master or Mistress arises from their experience -it is rooted in them by virtue of their character and is eVident in their eyes, their attitude and their knowledge. They have a unique, individual character -they do not playa 'role' or claim to be in touch I or have been in touch With some supra-personal entity. What they say and teach is based on their own experiences, on their own learning -they have struggled along the Path for many years, and learnt the hard way, via direct experience. ( They know because they have done. Accordingly, anyone who claims and need to rely on a mandate given to them -eith~ by some entity or someone who instructed them -reveals themselves to be a charlatan. To make this even clearer, I shall be personal for a few sentances. I represent _ a certain Satanic Order -and in a sense I therfore have some 'authority'. But I have this authority because, in this Order, I have gone further than anyone ­I have experienced more, and so learned some things. Perhaps I have gained some Wisdom - I certainly have esoteric knowledge and skills beyond that of most others. • What I say and do arises from my experience -it results from years of effort along the Left Hand Path. My authority is because of my character - a character forged Via experience. Even though I had been Initiated by a Satanic Mistress who instructed me for a while, my authority does not derive from her -or from [Satan. It derives from my own character. Others can learn from me if they wish ­they are free to judge what I say or write or create, and learn from it and use it ["},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"J ] should they wish. They must assess its worth for themselves. I do not make out what I say or write or do to be anything other than mine -except where it concerns some traditions I learned from my Mistress. But even these are to be] jUdged on their own mer~ts -there is nothing special about them, nothing 'Infernal' in the sense of a mandate attached to them. They have not been 'sanctified' by the Prince of Darkness Himself -they are not 'sacred' truths. In brief, there is nothing of a religious nature attached to me, the authority] I have or those teachings I have inherited and substantially added to. I stand on my own merits, and my creations likewise. The same is true for any genuine Satanist. Why? Because it is in the nature] of Satanism. This leads us to the second question: Satanism as a religion. The whole of Satanism is a defiance against the religious attitude. Satanism] is a rebellion against all those forms which hold or try to hold our eXistence, our being, in thrall -and the most potent form of thralldom has been and still is, religion. Religion emasculates us -whether it be overtly, via a religion, or covertly by a religious attitude such as is evident in political or social.J zealousness, in conformity to a dogma and an authority. Satanism, in essence, is an individual defiance -an individual pride, an individual striving, an individual quest for excellence. It is about fulfilling] the potential inherent in our eXistence -and this means finding and fulfilling our unique Destinies. Satanism means self-effort, self-learning, self-experience: it means each individual striving to become like a god; striving to be likeJ the Prince of Darkness Himself. The Prince of Darkness does not seek weak, docile followers: He desires Comrades, individuals of strength, of character, full of pride and defiance, overflowing with existence itself (which is expressed in deeds, J in creation, in changing, in altering evolution). Of course, He (and all genuine Satanists) use others for Satanic ends -they manipulate. He, as Satanists of J character do, has followers -have those who obey. But these are not Satanists ­they are tools, used to achieve something, perhaps broken, but mostly discarded when what they have been used for has been achieved. They are the dominated, the slave-majority, while the Satanists are the elite, the masters. Satanists are never constrained -they learn for themselves, via experience,J and so progress toward greater understanding, toward a new eXistence. It is J the aim of Satanism to produce unique individuals possessed of character. Accordingly, a genuine Satanic Master or Mistress or group merely guides others ­merely offers advice, based on experience. There are no restrictions, no religious zeal. There is not and cannot be any dogma -any authority which the individual must be 5ubserviant to. There cannot be any form of conformity. If there is ­it is not Satanic. l The Temple of Set constrains its members by dogma, by ethics, by making them subserviant to the authority of the priesthood, and to the High Priest himself. It fosters a religious attitude -'believe! because Ilwe are empowered by Setl the Prince of Darkness and so possess his authority'. It restrains -'do not associate with that personlorganization,for they are proscribed'. It breeds a sycophancy, stifling genuine experience and creativity. ... Naturally, there any many fine-sounding words and phrases, a great deal of intellectualism, which obscures these brutal truths. The Temple of Set..I encourages verbiage at the expense of real, dark, sinister experiences. Its members wallow in the illusory world created by words and ideas when they should... be alone undergoing formative ordeals. They play at magic(k) and enjoy the glamourJ\t of ~retending to be 'Satanists' -but they do not go to and beyond the limits of the~r lives, they do not live life as a succession of ecstaSies, they do not go to 't~e edge' again and again. Instead, they correspond with one another, meet and J ] talz, meet and talk, do little rituals together or alone, read, and talk and read and ~rite '\" And they know they are safe -the Prince of Darkness has been tamed: he is not really 'evil' (as we are not, they say to themselves and mean it).

Meanwhile, the few genuine Satanists get on with their hard tasks -With folloWing the path of Black Magick by their own efforts, by learning for themselves the hard way.

For them, there are no restraints, no dogma, no authority. There is only success -or failure. They achieve their own Grades, in their own time, and have the self-honesty and the insight to know if they have really aChieved. One illustration to end With. Consider the path of Satanism as a marathon race. There is a start, and a finish, which we will consider to be Adeptship in this instance. Satanists and would-be Satanists line up at the start. The race begins. The Satanist runs the race, and finishes, by his or her own effort -there is no help, only the will to finish, the hardship of the race itself. It is an individual achievement. But the Temple of Set members are those who run some of the distance, and then find someone running alonside (or perhaps driving along would be more apt) saying \"The rules have been changed! By a decree [read by an 'Infernal Mandate'].The marathon is now only 10 miles -so stop and I will award you your certificates [read 'confer Grades'].\" TheTemple of Set members of course believe this person, they do not doubt the Decree -or if they do, they accept it. They stop, and receive their 'rewards' -and believe they have succeeded: they have run a marathon. But in reality, they have deluded only themselves. -To conclude: The Temple of Set is the epitome of what Satanism is not. 000 ONA I I [ ["},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":",. ~ !-l-] ---Copula cum Daemone ] --i -i or A Summer's Tale ] :] ;1 • •,1 , !] 1 ~J ~ t :] @ copyright :--.. , \"./\"!'-:.! 1978 ONA ev mJ c w"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"scrambled around. Behind the curving trunk of the tree loose rocks lay clumped, overgovn and mossy and she gave them a cursory look before realizing. \"Come on, helpl\" she shouted to her sister, and together they began to clear the rubble. It was not long before they discovered the entrance to a cave. \"I don't like this,\" Ceridwen said. \"It's probably just an old mine shaft. Might even be Roman.\" She squezzed herself into and crawled along the passage. It widened after a while, enabling her to turn around. \"Goes a long way in. We need a lantern.\" Richenda left her sister at the cave entrance, and she had almost reached the track which led back to their cottage when she heard a horse approaching. She hid in the bracken, but it was only Owen, her nearest neighbour, and she watched him raise the gun he carried to sh~t at a Skylark. The bird fell, and Owen sent his dog after it. Owen was partial to Lark pie. She could see his ruddy face smile as he urged his horse She did not wish to speak to him and waited until she was alone again. Ceridwen was asleep when she returned to the entrance of the cave, carrying two lanterns and a flint tinderbox. She lit them both, woke her sister and led her into the crumbling, dank passage. It slanted gently downward to sharply turn and end in a small chamber. Toward the left Richenda could see another passage, but it was almost completely blocked by rubble and large rocks. She tried to move some, but soon gave up and she turned, crouching, to see Ceridwen digging at the ground with her hands. There was a smile on Ceridwen's face as she extracted something from the rubble. Outside, in the bright light, she used the dirty hem of her dress to clean it. The crystal was large, cold to the touch, and shaped like a tetrahedron. Now, Richenda thought, I have a question, which hopefully the old man can answer. II \"So -you failed us.\" The speaker was dressed in a cassock of a Priest. His face was wrinkled with age, his hair white, some of his teeth rotten, while his body seemed too small to support the large head. He looked dismissively at Paul who was kneeling before him the cold damp Chapel. \"Forgive me, Father,\" Paul said in a pleading voice. The Priest turned to this three companions, who nodded gravely. \"Rise,\" the Priest said to Paul, affecting a smile. \"And sit with us.\" \"These followers of the Devil,\" he continued,\"cannot be allowed to continue with thet/blaphemy.\" He turned to whisper to his three comoanions. \"Inveni Pauli servum meum, oleo sancto meo unxieum:'manus enim mea auxiliabitur ei, et brachium meum cOJlfortabit eum.\" To Paul, he said, \"I have a special task for you, my son.Have you faith enought to accept?\" • • • • -• I I ---[ 'tYes, Father.\" .­L"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":".J 5. ] \"You must be strons, my son.

We fear this, and depend on you.\" He save Paul a small phial. \"Holy relics, to guard you. Go now.\"1 Paul left. It was a long walk along the lan~s and tracks to the sinewy small valley that gave one access to Richenda's cottage. A man leading several tethered pack-mules passed]\t him as he skirted the srounds of Linley Hall. He wished the man with the wizened face and torn, dirty clothes, a good-day but received no reply. The man barely looked up]\t and briefly met Paul's gaze before looking nevrously around, his hand clutching at the pistol stuck into his belt. Then he was sone from Paul's sight' as the track he had chosen led him and his mules eastward toward the Port Way over the 1 J Hynd. Paul chose a high vantage point, in the bracken, to observe Cold Hill cottage. The day was warm, and he was glad to be freed from the toil of work. He hated work, and had been slad when Father Albert had come to his father all those years ago. He hated their squatter's cottage perched near the bottom of Nind hill -always filled with smoke, withl his brothers and sisters. Its walls were thick, compsed of stone, undressed and found nearby, its windows tiny. There•were only two rooms, and on most nights the children huddled1\t together round the fire while their parents slept alone on a mattress made from moss. He had always been hungry. But the old Priest had saved him, and sent him to school inl\t Salop town. He was sixteen, his mind full of stories of Empire and adventure, when the Priest found him work with a Farrier not very distant from Cold Hill cottage. So he had worked and came to know Richenda, as the PriestJ had planned. After four years, she had confided in him, as the Priest had done. Thus he had played the Priest's game, priding himself on his success. What stories he would tell] in the Taverns when his adventures were complete! The warm sun began to make him feel sleepy. He had seen no one around the cottage during the hours of his waiting,[\t no sign of anyone within, and he began to wonder what it was like inside. He had only ever met Richenda at or near his place of work -and only twice near the circle of stones -and the more he thought about the interior of theI cottage the more excited he became. It was there that she slept, that she kept her clothes. Perhaps even now she-was sleeping. He could creep up, and see her through the window. Soon, his excitement could no longer be contained, and he crept slowly down with beating heart and quivering limbs toward-the cottage. He crouched outside, listening. No sounds reached him, except the breeze, the sound of a curlew, the cry of a raven, and he stole a look through one of-the small windows at the back of the cottage. There was a woman, sleeping on a bed, and she was naked. Paul stared at her, unable to avert his gaze. It was not Richenda, nor Ceridwen. She seemed of middle age, her dark hair in disarray around her head and shoulders. He had seen one of his sisters naked, once. But this was different. He was a Virgin, and as he stared lustful thoughts began to grow in his mi~d. Then the woman opened her eyes. She looked directly at him, as if she had known he had been there, but she did not move, even to cover herself, or turn her eyes awayo Instead, she began to very slowly"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"caress her breasts, smi1ing as she did so.

But she was still there as he walked into the bedroom. She sat up, still smiling, to stand and touch his ~ace. Her touch startled him, because he had hal~-expected her to be unrea1. Her ~ingers were warm, her touch so~t, her breath ~ragrent and she kissed him passionately be~ore starting to remove his clothes. \"I am Melusine\" she whispered in his ear as she dragged his naked body down with her onto the bed, her hand guiding his erection.

His eyes began to close, and she began to laugh. She was mocking him with her laugh. But it sUddenly stopped, and he opened his eye. to see her gone. He rushed outside, but she had vanished. III Richenda waited a long time in the woods near her circle of stones, but Ceridwen did not come to meet her as they had planned. It was nearing dusk when, weary and beginning to worry, she began her walk back to the cottage. She reached it in darkness, guided by her senses, her know1edge o~ the area and the vestigal light rarely absent on a summer's night in Britain. Spectral shadows entwinned her cottage, and she understood. But the ~orm that she had summoned to work her desire upon Paul did not return and she sat in a rickety chair be~ore the empty grate o~ the ~ireplace reaching out to Ceridwen. But she could sense nothing. It was as i~ some barrier existed between them, a barrier that not even her magick could breach. For some time she listened to the sounds o~ her night: a white Owl screeching, the jarring cry o~ a Night jar. Tired, she closed her eyes to sleep. \"I hope I do not disturb you,\" a so~t voice beside her said.

And this you have,1 given by me, its guardian.\" Richenda was very tired, and closed her eyes in sleep. When she awoke, she did not expect to see the old man, and did1 not. 'Veniebant Daemones, et cum mulieribus miscebantur' she heard in her head like an echo. Did she really understand? She believed so, and this pleased her, although she was still troubled by Ceridwen's absence.1 'The crystal -' a voice seemed to say to her, and she went to where it was hidden among the objects of the untidy and unclean cottage. She found it, and sat down at the1\t table, clearing away the remains of the discarded and mouldering food to place it in front of her. She stared at it, and it was not long before her mind cleared and began]\t to fill with images. She saw Ceridwen, almost naked, tied to a chair in a damp chapel replete with Nazarene symbols and images. Father Albert and two other men stood over her, leering as one of them began to beat her with a whip. They o ] were shouting at her sister, although she could hear no words, and her sister sat as if oblivious to the blows, mocking -zthem with a silent smile. Anger overcame Richenda, and the vision flickered, then vanished. Then, remembering, she formed her anger into an astral shape and sent it forth to bring her Paul. j\t IV j The presbytery was not large, and not even purpose built as a dwelling for a Priest, but Father Albert likedJ\t it, and the chapel attached to it. It was a gift, less than a decade ago, from the wealthy Sumner family. Recusants, the Sumners owned the village in the shadow of the Long Mynd]\t and most of the surrounding land. So he said his Masses for the family and the €ew villagers who ventured to attend. It was a comfortable living.

L.. the area. So he had studied, and listened and learnt, ­seeking help from his learned brethren. Thus it was that he came to know of a coven perhaps centuries old, dedicated to the old ways and commerce with demons. And so his suspicions grew until he seriously believed this commerce was of great import - a new and important battle in the centuries long war. So he had begun to scheme to defeat his enemy. His small study was filled from floor to ceiling with books, and from a crowded shelf he took down a manuscript bound in vellum. He opened it and began to read, and as he ­did so he felt someone laughing at him. He shut his eyes and began to pray: 'Exorcizamus te, omnis immunde spiritus, omnis.Satanica potestas, omnis incursio ­infernalis adversarii .0' The prayer soothed him, and the laughter disappeared. The manuscript was hand-written in a monastic script ­and told of the signs by which commerce with demons could be told. He had read it many times, and read it again while he waited for his fellow believers to return with their prize. Ceridwen, sister of the women who knew to be ­hereditary leader of the coven. Paul, his oblate and pupil, had failed to return, and Father Albert s'uspected foul and demonic deeds. Perhaps they had him, and would complete their sacrifice. But with Ceridwen, he might forstall their plans ••• His reverie about his holy war was interrupted by the -I arrival of his companions. He had sworn them, with holy oaths, to secrecy, and they being god-fearing and educated like him in theology in the confines of a monastery, had obeyed. Ceridwen had offered no resistance, and she let herself ­be led into the chapel where they bound her to a chair, these ageing relicts of an almost dying age. \"Speak, witch1\" Father Albert demanded. -But she smiled and spat into his face. They prayed over her then, but she still smiled. They sprinkled her with their holy water, held a crucifix near her face, but she said nothing, and did not attempt to move. After an hour they left her. She was still smiling when they returned, AD hour later. I\"Tell us,\" Father Albert said to her as he clutched his Breviary, \"this area is important, is it not? I have heard tales of that hideous stone circle -of what you do and have done there. Do you not promise the Devil sacrifices and I offerings~\" He turned to his companions. \"Singulis quindecim diebus, vel singulo mense saltem, necem alicujus infantis aut mortale veneficium.\" .. They crossed themselves in horror. \"Why do you not answer us?\" Father Albert said to her. \"We seek only your good, your own salvation. We can save you from eternal damnation. If you repent, you can be saved. We only seek to help you, ­be your friends. It is our duty to save your soul.\" He opened his breviary and began to pray. For nearly an hour he prayed. But she still smiled at them. -\"There is a mark,\" Father Albert said, remembering his manuscript, \"A mark made by the demon. It is imprinted on some hidden part of tr-3 body. Sometimes in the shape of a [ toad's leg, sometimes a hare or a spider.\" He motioned to his companions and they began to remove her clothes. She was almost naked when Father Albert began to touch her breasts. \"Et hoc modo,\" she whispered to him, \"homo L"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I I -1-. , , jungens se Incut~ non vilificat, immo dignificat suam naturam.\" This startled and shocked him, both for its content and because of her obvious knowledge of Latin, and he sprang back, horrified. Quickly, his mind made many assumptions. \"She is a demonl\" he shouted. His riding whip was nearby, discarded, and he grasped it in trembling hands. Then one of his companions, perhaps excited by the exposure or female flesh or from whatever other motive, snatched the whip and began to beat her with it, shouting 'Avante Satanas1' as he did so. Cerdiwen smiled at them all. Suddenly, Father Albert shouted. \"Leave her1 Leave herl We must pray.\" They left her then, bloodied but defiant, while they went to the study to pray. v Richenda did not have long to wait. Paul came to her, as she had bid him do. He had been nearby, still under the spell of Melusine's body and lust yet morbidly ashamed of his betrayal of his faith and Father Albert. So he had sat and waited, for some sign. A voice called him, and he came back to Richenda's cottase to stand on the step to her door, shivering with both fear and anticipation. \"Do you wish her again?\" Richenda asked him. \"Yes,\" he said, staring down at the floor. \"Then she shall be yours. But first -do you Paul Jones renounce Yeshua, the Nazarene, and all his works?\" \"I- \" \"Say . itl And this time there shall be no escape1\" She held the fingers of her left hand against his forehead. \"I Paul Jones renounce Yeshua, the Nazarene, and all his works.\" \"Do you affirm Satan'?\" \"I do affirm Satan.\" \"Do you bind yourself with word and deed to me, your Mistress of Earth?\" \"I do.\" \"To the glory of our dark gods?\" \"To the glory of our dark gods.\" \"Then receive from me as a sign of your faith this kiss.\" She kissed him, as ~lelusine had kissed him, tongue against tongue, while she pressed her body into his. Then she pushed him away. \"Go now, and release her and bring her back to me. Then, before dawn, your desires will once again be fulfilled.\" He ran the first mile, then stopped to briefly walk before running again, and it took him less than an hour to reach the house where Father Albert lived. For a while he waited in the darkness outside and as he waited he felt a strength growing within him. It was a dark strength, born from lust, youth, rebellion and fear, and he was smiling"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"10. as he knocked on the door. Father Albert cried in surprise and joy when he opened the door to see him. \"My sonl\" he said. Paul pushed him aside and rushed toward the chapel. ..\"Are you possessed?\" Father Albert said as he scuttled after him. Paul did not answer. He untied Ceridwen and spat at the large crucifix which adorned the chapel. \"Quickly:\" Father Albert shouted to his companions. \"Quickly comel He is possessedl\" He tried to bar Paul's way, but was knocked aside. He fell, blocking the path for his two companions who could only watch as Ceridwen and Paul escaped into the shielding cover of the darkness. Richenda was waiting for them by the door to the cottage. \"She is waiting for you, inside,\" she said to Paul before she embraced her sister in welcome. ..He ~ave a brief smile, then nervously entered. Outside, Richenda showed Ceridwen the crystal. \"Do you wish to rest -or shall we begin?\" \"Let us begin.\" .. \"First then, our foes.\" They stood beside each other with the crystal between them and Richenda began her visualization. She saw the clerics XXE in the study of the presbytery kneeling and praying, -their breviaries open before them. Then one of them looked up, as if to smell something. She saw Father Albert stand and turn toward the door just as it burst into flames. He ... shielded his face as books above and around them caught fire, raining down in sudden profusion. Soon, the whole room was ablaze and then the whole building. Nothing that was living escaped from i~. ­Satisfied, Richenda turned her attentions elsewhere. There was a scream in the cottage as she began her second visualization. The crystal, Paul, ~lelusine -they were -all keys, as her vision had fortold. Had the old man returned to her while she waited for Paul to return with her sis~er -or had it been a dream? The dark gods were waiting, as they had waited for centuries, Iand she would free them -earthing their power through a body ye~ to be born. She knew enough, through her mother's teaching and education as well as through her own intuitive understanding, to understand wha~ she was about to do -what I the old man had bid her do and what her mother had spoken of in mysterious words many times -and although she did not understand everything, she was happy to proceed and bring the dark forces back to earth. She began to chant, as Cerdiwen began to chant, the ancient ­words handed down by her mother. 'Nythra Kthunae Atazoth. Binan ath ga wath am:' She would not know where the child of her endev~urs would be born, or to whom, only that, nine months hence, the chosen child would emerge into the world. ­Inside the cottage and lying naked on the bed, Paul was dead, an expression of stark horror on his face. Near him on the floor, a recent crumpled newspaper lay. 'The Ironbridge Chronicle' was d~ted August 1888. [ [ -"}]
