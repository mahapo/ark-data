MISTRESS OF EARTH - DAVCINA Empathic manipulation (such as ‘enchantment’) to create Change via causal structure - amoral acts that may conventionally be seen as ‘evil’.

LORD OF EARTH - KTHUNAE The nature of the changes in the causal, beyond the actions of those who initiated them; how the acausal relates dynamically to the causal and vice-versa (‘Sinister Dialectic’). The flowing of energies according to the greater Wyrd and Destinies of those directly and indirectly involved - thus, the presence of unforeseen factors and the pitfalls implicit in this which may create errors of judgement. The maintaining of an ethos or ‘tradition’ via ‘timeless’ acts."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"V The depths of the sea A tunnel of knives There is a union here While he directs the Chosen Rage in the Eye Of the Goat – The golden triangle Stands against a sky of fire MASTER - ATAZOTH Manipulation - actions based on a knowledge of the Sinister Dialectic as revealed by practical experience: a rational, to some ‘cold’, observation beyond the stage of Adeptship/Individuation. Control of all the many and varied factors within a situation - in other words, the achievement of a stage in individual evolution that goes beyond the personal, and thus implies the ability to initiate Change on a large-scale, perhaps of a civilization.

CHANGE - NEKALAH The earthing and spreading of energies. The hard truth of Nature - the dying time of one form to give way and birth to another. A causal form created to act as a focal point/channel for the fulfillment of Wyrd - the beginnings of a practical realization of strategies and aims. The Sinister Dialectic in action: by its dynamic nature a prelude to - and when realized a creator of - insight.

WYRD - AZANIGIN That which is beyond personal Destiny. That which causes expression of itself via the implementation or provocation of acts which in their design achieve long term aims beyond the causal death of an individual; changing aspects of a society by significant creations and thus changing a whole race of people - fulfilling the destiny or Wyrd of the ethos of a civilization. Acts that inaugurate a new Aeon.

The individual becoming that which s/he created - a transferral of consciousness to the acausal to be in essence part of the greater Wyrd. A reverberation across Aeons of the causal acts of an individual, gradually leaving the essence behind the appearance to haunt the psyches of others. The altering of the astral shell; that which ultimately cannot and need not be described. The deliberate removal of that which is detrimental to Wyrd.

The chalice spills its White blood And the Herdsman’s light shines In the Chamber of the Sphinx.

DEOFEL - NOCTULIUS Sinister awakening - Nature as it is, raw and unaffected. That primal awareness of the vibrance of life that possesses and creates the ‘accuser’, that provokes acts that challenge the existence of the ‘sacred’. The real meaning of liberation unchained by temporary abstract ideas; the laughter of the savage, wild god. Terror to the uninitiated. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XVI In a dungeon, a bed of fire From an exploded sphere Red butterflies With a look The war is begun A sexless mask In the caves of the sea. WAR - ABATU Conflict; the clashing of vision and destinies. The attempt by others to wrest away the Destiny of one individual and thus disrupt the greater Wyrd. A clouding of vision that creates doubts, lack of direction, susceptibility to outside forces and possibly, if insight is lost, the renouncing of a quest. The hardship imposed by the consequences of actions, but by the suffering such striving imposes, Wisdom - and Destiny - may be attained. Awareness of those factors - such as other people - that may fulfill Destiny, and the hard practical realities of striving to create this fulfillment. Sadness and wisdom and creativity through loss "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"XVII The blue statue His red eyes survey the maze Bringer of wisdom The perfect child And the tetrahedron Bathing hair in the Dark Pool Successor ... STAR - NEMICU The maturity and bringing to fulfillment of that promise re-presented by atus VI and VIII. Knowledge of identity, of Wyrd and what needs to be done.

MOON - SHUGARA That which has not yet been confronted within the psyche of the individual; that which is strange, which lies outside the scope of any world view; that which lies within the Dark Pool beneath the Moon and threatens to devour, create madness. A stage which cannot be ignored if further development is saught, requiring a descent to draw out that which is obscure, fearfully hidden: the gateway to the Abyss. A point from which there is no turning back: that which leads to rebirth via death.

SUN - VELPECULA The finding of the Aeon: the height of Imperium – causal structure altered in accordance with long term aims, bearing its own fruits of Change. But these fruits are the final product of a grand age, the final works of the ethos of a race fulfilled. The brink of new possibilities; storm clouds gather with promise of the blood of birth, of the heralding of a Higher associated civilization. The fulfilling of personal Desires and potential, creating intimations/hauntings of further progression. Disatisfaction causing aspirations to something ‘higher’/beyond – ‘reaching for the stars’ "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"XX The woman beneath the water The Temple within Of War torn landscapes, black hills Grab the lightening and hold it Shell shocked The Giving within Her arms ... AEON - NAOS A nexion fully opened: greater Wyrd causally fulfilled now dynamically giving expression to new forms of itself via Physis; new challenges, new expressions of a continuing ethos - the Chaos of birth: the Dark Gods returned, shape-shifting, creating new possibilities. An ethos that is alive and evolving, defying all that challenge its vision; to constantly redefine limits, Prometheus-like and insatiable. The cycle of creative evolution. The Aeon of Fire."}]
