[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Order of Nine Angles1Order of Nine AnglesSymbol of ONAThe Order of Nine Angles (ONA) is a purported secretive Satanist organization,initially formed in the United Kingdom, and which rose to public note during the 1980sand 1990s after having been mentioned in books detailing fascist Satanism.[1] [2] [3] [4]Presently, the ONA is organized around clandestine cells (which it calls \"traditionalnexions\")[5] [6] and around what it calls \"sinister tribes\".[7] [8]HistoryThe Order of Nine Angles was originally formed in England in the 1960s, with themerger of three neopagan temples called Camlad, The Noctulians, and Temple of the Sun. Following the originalleader's emigration to Australia, it has been alleged that David Myatt took over the order and began writing the nowpublicly-available teachings of the ONA.[9] The ONA now has associates, and groups, in the United States[10] ,Europe, Australia,[9] New Zealand,[1] Canada, Russia, and Iceland.Author Nick Ryan has asserted that Anton Long, the author of the ONA's public tracts, is a pseudonym of DavidMyatt, a person who was involved with the neo-Nazi movement in England.[11] This assertion is repeated byNicholas Goodrick-Clarke, who claims that David Myatt was the founder of the ONA and writer of most of the ONAdocuments,[12] and had previously acted as bodyguard for \"British Nazi Colin Jordan\".[13]Ryan states in his book that Myatt lived in the 1990s on a smallholding in Shropshire with Christos Beest, who hasgiven several interviews on behalf of the ONA[14] and performed a live recording of The Self-Immolation Rite thatwas included with Vol. 2 No. 3 of Fenrir.David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with Satanism,[1] the ONA, and using thepseudonym Anton Long, and repeatedly challenged anyone to provide any evidence of such allegations [15] . Inaddition, Myatt challenged two journalists - Nick Lowles (from Searchlight) and Nick Ryan - to a duel for repeatingsuch allegations, a challenge which they both declined. [16] [17]Gerry Gable, from anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, said: \"Myatt is an ethereal character who has used numerousaliases to post messages on extremist websites. He is a dangerous man who has twice been jailed for his violentright-wing activities and who openly asked for blood to be spilled in the quest for white Aryan domination. Webelieve... he remains a deeply intellectual subversive and is still one of the most hardline Nazi intellectuals in Britaintoday. Myatt believes in the disruption of existing societies as a prelude to the creation of a new more warrior-likeAryan society which he calls the Galactic Empire.\"[18]David Myatt converted to Islam in 1998[19] [20] [21] and changed his name to Abdul-Aziz ibn Myatt.[22]BeliefsThe Order postulates Satanism as being a highly individualized quest that aims to create self-excellence and wisdom,by undertaking challenges that allow a person to transcend his physical and mental limits.[23] It is meant to involvethe arduous achievement of self-mastery and Nietzschean self-overcoming, with an emphasis on individual growththrough practical acts of risk, prowess and endurance.[9] Rites of passage, often connected to promotion in gradelevel, include spending three months living rough in a forest bereft of human contact,[14] [1] and the assumption ofdifficult occupations to develop personality and leadership ability.[9] This is meant to aid in the evolution of theindividual: \"this new individual will be fierce, free, exult in exploration and discovery and possess an essentiallypagan attitude to life.\"[24] This, in turn, will lead to the transformation of society into a higher, refined civilization.According to the ONA:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Order of Nine Angles2\"Satanism is understood by its genuine adherents as a particular Occult way or method. That is, it is a specificpath or way toward a specific goal, the following of which involves a particular way of living. The specificpath, or 'Left Hand Path', is a dark, sinister one, and the specific goal is the creation of a new type ofindividual. On a more general level, Satanism is concerned with changing our evolution and the societies welive in - creating, in fact, a new human species and a civilization appropriate to the new type of human being.\"(Anton Long: Satanism: A Basic Introduction for Prospective Adherents, Thormynd Press, England, 1992)In addition, the ONA claims that its sinister tribes are an important part of its Aeonic, sinister, strategy to build anew, tribal-based, more sinister way of life, and to disrupt and eventually overthrow the societies of what it calls themundanes [25] [26] [27] .The ONA's writings condone and encourage human sacrifice[11] [28] [29] [30] as a means of eliminating the weak:Anton Long describes it as \"a contribution to improving the human stock, removing the worthless, the weak, thediseased (in terms of character)\".[23] This \"culling\" serves not just a Darwinian purpose, but is also connected to thepromotion of a new Aeon: \"The change that is necessary means that there must be a culling, or many cullings, whichremove the worthless and those detrimental to further evolution.\"[31] Thus, true Satanism, they assert, requiresventuring into the realm of the forbidden and illegal, in order to make contact with the \"sphere of acausal, sinisterforces on the cosmos.\"[9] The presencing of acausal energies, such as through culling, is meant to create a new Aeon,whose energies will then create a newer, higher civilization from the energy unleashed.[32]Probably because of the ONA's highly radical stance, there is open animosity between the ONA and \"mainstream\"Satanists such as the Church of Satan.[11] The ONA publicly disavows any connection to Church of Satan, claimingthe Satanic Bible to be a \"watered-down philosophy\".[33] The ONA eschews the religious type of approach evident ingroups such as the Temple of Set and regards other Satanic groups, such as the Church of Satan, with contempt.[34]The Temple of Set proscribed the ONA in the early 1980s for its avowal of human sacrifice.[35]The ONA has its own, unique, ontology and theology of Satanism, based on the axioms of (1) a bifurcation ofReality into an acausal continuum and a causal continuum, and (2) the existence of acausal beings in this acausalcontinuum, one of whom is the being conventionally known as Satan [36] .Footnotes[1]Ryan, Nick.
