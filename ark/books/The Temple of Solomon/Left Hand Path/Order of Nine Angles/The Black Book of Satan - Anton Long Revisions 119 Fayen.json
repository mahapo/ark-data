In traditional Satanism (i.e. those using the Septenary System: this system also being known as the Hebdomadry) this practice continued until quite recently when the Grand Master representing traditional groups decided to allow Initiates of good standing to copy the work. This decision was recently extended to enable specialist publication in a limited edition. The whole text of the traditional Black Book is included in the present work, together with several additional chapters (e.g. Self-Initiation; Organizing and Running a Temple).These additions make this present work a concise practical handbook for those seriously interested in the Black Arts.

The essence of this way is the belief that we can all, as individuals, achieve far more with our lives than we realize. Most people waste the opportunities that life can, by magick, be made to bring. Satanic magick is simply the use of magickal forces or energies to enhance the life of an individual or individuals according to their desires. This usage can be of two types - the first is 'external' and the second is 'internal'. External magick is essentially sorcery: the changing of external events, circumstances or individuals in accordance with the wishes of the sorcerer. Internal magick is the changing of the consciousness of the individual magician using certain magickal techniques -this is essentially the quest of the Initiate for the higher grades of magickal attainment, a following of the way of Adeptship. To external magick belongs ceremonial and hermetic rituals. To internal magick belongs the seven-fold sinister way. Ceremonial rituals are rituals involving more than two individuals, the ritual taking place in either a Temple or an outdoor area consecrated as a Temple. Ceremonial rituals involve a set text which is followed by the participants, and the wearing of ceremonial robes together with the use of certain items having magickal or Occult significance. Hermetic rituals are usually undertaken by an individual working alone or with one assistant/ companion. This present work deals with Satanic ceremonial magick: Satanic hermetic and internal magick is dealt with in the book 'NAOS - A Practical Guide to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Sinister Hermetic Magick'. Satanism, in its beginnings, is all about making conscious (or liberating) our dark or shadow nature, and to this end, Satanic magick is undertaken. Satanists believe that we are already gods: but most people fail to understand this and continue to grovel: to others or to a 'god'. The Satanist is proud, strong and defiant and detests the religion of the crucified god founded by the Nazarene, Yeshua. A Nazarene (a follower of Yeshua) is afraid of dying and weighed down by guilt and envy. The religion of Yeshua has inverted all natural values, setting back the course of our conscious evolution. Satanism, on the contrary, is a natural expression of the evolutionary or 'Promethean' urge within us: and its magick is a means to make us gods upon Earth, to realize the potential that lies within us all. Satanic ceremonies are a means to enjoy the pleasures of life: they offer carnality, the pleasure of fulfilling one's desires, the bringing of material and personal rewards and the joys of darkness. But they are only a beginning, a stage toward something greater. It is one of the purposes of a Satanic Temple to guide those Initiates who may be interested along the difficult and dangerous path which is the seven fold way. Those who do not wish to follow this path to Adeptship and beyond should simply enjoy the many pleasures which the Prince of Darkness offers to those who by a Satanic Initiation wish to follow His philosophy of living. In traditional Satanism there is an appreciation of the role of women, for Satanism at its highest level is concerned with the development of the individual: roles as such are a necessary part of self-development. To be played, discarded and then transcended. The structure of traditional Temples and the rituals performed by those members of those Temples reflect this appreciation and understanding. For example, it is possible and indeed desirable for a Mistress of Earth to establish and organize her own Temple unless she herself wishes otherwise, just as it is possible and desirable to celebrate the Black Mass using a priest, naked, upon the altar while the Priestess conducts the service, such reversal being an accepted principle of Black Magick. II The Temple Satanic rites are conducted either in an indoor Temple or in an isolated outdoor locality during the hours of darkness. Indoor Temples usually have a static altar, made of either stone or wood, and this altar should be set in the East. It should be covered by an"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 altar cloth made of good quality material and coloured black. Upon this is woven either an inverted pentagram, the septenary sigil or the personal sigil of the Master/Mistress or Temple if there is one. Candle-holders, made of either silver or gold, are placed on the altar, one at either end. Black candles are usually the most often employed although some rituals require the use of other colours. Other candleholders should be placed around the Temple, since the only light used in the Temple both during rituals and at other times should come from candles. The Black Book should be placed on an oak stand on the altar, the altar itself being of sufficient size for an individual to lie upon it. Indoor Temples should be painted either black or crimson (or a combination of the two), the floor bare or covered with rugs or carpets of plain design, either black or crimson. When not in use, the Temple should be kept dark and warm, hazel incense being burned frequently. A quartz sphere or large crystal should be kept in the Temple, either in or near the altar: if near, supported by an oak stand. Above the altar or behind it should be an image or sculpture of Baphomet according to Satanic Tradition. Baphomet is regarded by Satanists as a 'violent goddess' and is depicted as a beautiful woman, seated, who is naked from the waist up. In her left hand she holds the severed head of a man. In her other hand she holds a burning torch. The severed head, which drips blood onto her lower white garment, is held so that it partially obscures her smiling face. Baphomet is regarded as the archetype of the Mistress of Earth, and the Bride of Lucifer. No other furnishings are present in the Temple. The Temple implements are few in number and should be either made or commissioned by the Master or Mistress. If this is not possible, they should be chosen by them with care. The implements required are several large silver chalices, a Censor (or incense holders), a quartz tetrahedron, a large silver bowl, and the Sacrificial Knife which should have a wooden handle. These implements may be kept on the altar if it is large enough, or wrapped in black cloth and kept in an oak chest. No one is allowed into the Temple unless they are dressed in ceremonial robes and barefoot. The robes are generally black with a hood, although some rituals require the use of other colours. If possible, an ante-chamber should be used by members to change into the ceremonial robes. If an outdoor location is used, the area should be marked out by a circle of seven stones, by the Master or Mistress. An outdoor altar is usually the body of one of the participants - naked or robed depending on the ritual and the prevailing conditions. The one"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 chosen for this honour lies on an altar cloth, black in colour and woven with an inverted pentagram, the size of this cloth being not less than seven feet by three. Candles should be placed in lanterns which open on one side only, this side being of glass which is often coloured red. The participants should know the area well, since they should not use any artificial light of any kind including candles, to guide them to the chosen site. Neither must any fires be lit during any ritual. For this reason the night of the full moon is often chosen Both indoor Temples and outdoor areas chosen for rituals should be consecrated according to the rite of Temple consecration. When any ritual of Satanic magick is undertaken, no attempt should be made in any way to banish the magickal forces - what forces or energies remain following a ritual are to remain, since they dedicate the area or Temple still further to the powers of Darkness. Preparation for Rituals: The Master or Mistress should choose one member to act as 'Altar Brother or Sister'. It is the duty of this member to ensure that the Temple is prepared - for example, lighting the candles, filling the chalices with wine, incensing prior to the ritual. It is the duty of the Master and Mistress to prepare the members for the ritual. This usually involves them assembling in robes in the Temple or in an ante-chamber designated as a preparation area at least half of one hour before the beginning of the ritual. During this period they are to keep their silence while standing, concentrating on the image of Baphomet or some sigil (such as an inverted pentagram) as decreed by the Master or Mistress. One or several members should be chosen to act as Cantor and instructed in the proper chanting of the chants. Other members may be chosen as musicians - the preferred instruments being tabor (or hand-drum) or flute. III Ceremonial Rituals Ceremonial rituals, as given here, are conducted for basically two reasons: to generate magickal energy (and thus direct that energy to achieve a magickal goal or desire) and for the benefit of the participating congregation. The benefits the congregation derive from a successfully conducted ritual of Black Magick are many and varied: there are the carnal ones, the material ones and the spiritual ones. To be successful, a ceremonial ritual must be both dramatic and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 emotional. That is, the right atmosphere has to be created and maintained. The object is to involve the emotions of the congregation, and all the many ritualized elements (e.g. the robes and the candles) are a means to aid this. However, the single most important element is the power of the voice, whether spoken, chanted, vibrated or sung. (See the chapter on 'Magickal Vibration' for one aspect of this.) When you are conducting a ceremonial ritual you must use the set texts and chants (such as the Satanic Our Father, the Diabolus) as a means of gradually working yourself into an emotional but still controlled frenzy. It is no use just saying the correct words - they must be spoken or chanted with a Satanic desire - and the emotion once brought must be sustained until the ritual is over. This does not mean simply acting: it means actually becoming the role you assume, that of a powerful sorcerer or sorceress. And this feeling must be communicated to the audience: by voice, gestures eyes and so on. Ceremonial Magick is and always has been an Art, and to master this Art takes practice. However, you (and the person working as Mistress/Master or Priestess/Priest) must always remain in control of your emotions stopping just short of possession. This also means that each and every ritual must be undertaken without fear or doubt (not even unconscious fear or doubt) - that is, in the true spirit of Satanic pride and mastery: with an exultation in the forces conjured forth. In most ceremonial rituals it is one of the tasks of the congregation to abandon themselves to their lusts and frenzy, but you as ceremonial Master/Mistress cannot do this since you must control and direct all the energies which are brought forth via the ritual and the frenzy produced. It is up to you to initiate the emotion in the Temple, to cultivate its development in the congregation, to get them to reach a ritual frenzy and climax. And then the energy must be controlled - towards a specific magickal aim or dispersed by you into the Temple/surrounding area and left to dissipate/spread according to its nature and to the glory of the Prince of Darkness. To direct the energy, you must before the ritual choose a specific desire or aim (either your own or as a favour to one of the members). This aim (for example, it might be to harm a specific individual) must be enshrined in both a simple phrase and a simple visualization according to the principles of hermetic magick. The visualization should be of the successful outcome desired - however, if this proves difficult, concentrate solely on the phrase. This phrase, which should be succinct, should then and by you prior to the ritual, be written on a piece of parchment - you could use a 'secret script' of your own devising or one of the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 magickal ones in general use. You then burn this parchment at the climax of the ritual: at a point you feel is right. To do this, fill the silver bowl with spirit, place the parchment in this at the beginning of the ritual, and light it using one of the candles during the ritual. While it burns shout/chant/vibrate your chosen phrase, visualizing your desire according to the visualization chosen (if you wish to and can include the visualization part). Then exult in the triumph of your desire. Follow this with continuing the ritual to its ceremonial end. To disperse the energy, just imagine it (as, for example, filaments) surrounding the Temple and gradually creeping outwards. You may also (for example in an Initiation ritual) direct the energy into an individual who is present (in that ritual, by using a sigil and a chant.). IV The Black Mass Introduction: The Black Mass is a ceremonial ritual with a threefold purpose. First, it is a positive inversion of the mass of the Nazarene church, and in this sense is a rite Black Magick (see the 'Guide to Black Magick'). Second it is a means of personal liberation from the chains of Nazarene dogma and thus a blasphemy: a ritual to liberate unconscious feelings. Third, it is a magickal rite in itself, that is, correct performance generates magickal energy which the celebrant can direct. The Black Mass has been greatly misunderstood. It is not simply an inversion of Nazarene symbolism and words - when a Nazarene mass is celebrated (as occurs every day, many times, throughout the world) certain energies or vibrations compatible with the Nazarene ethos may or may not be generated, depending on the circumstances and the individuals attending. That is, under certain circumstances, the Nazarene mass can be a ritual of 'white magic': the energies that are sometimes produced being produced because a number of individuals of like mind are gathered together in ritualized setting; there is nothing in the production of energies which is attributable to external agencies (e.g. 'god'). What a genuine Black Mass does is 'tune into' those energies and then alter them in a sinister way. This occurs during the 'consecration' part of the Black Mass. The Black Mass also generates its own forms of (sinister) energy. To see the Black Mass as simply a mockery is to misunderstand its magick. Also, the Black Mass does not require those who conduct it or participate in it to believe or accept Nazarene"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 theology: it is simply means that the participants accept that others, who attend Nazarene masses, do believe in at least to some degree in Nazarene theology - the Black Mass uses the energy produced by those beliefs against those who believe in them, by distorting that energy, and sometimes redirecting it. This is genuine Black Magick. ^^^^^ Participants: Altar Priest - lies naked upon altar Priestess - in white robes Mistress of Earth - in scarlet robes Master - in purple robes Congregation - in black robes Setting: Usually an indoor Temple. If outdoors, clearings in forests or woods are suitable. Caves are ideal. The reason for such Outdoor settings being to provide an impression of 'enclosure'. Versions: The Black Mass exists in several versions. The one given below is the version most often used today. The other main version uses almost the same text, but is undertaken by a Priest using a naked Priestess on the altar. Preparation of the Temple: Hazel incense is to be burnt (if obtainable, the hazel is mingled with civit). Several chalices full of strong wine. Black candles. Several patens (of silver if possible) containing the consecrated cakes - these are baked the night before by the Priestess and blessed (i.e. dedicated to the Prince of Darkness - see chapter of Chants) by the Mistress of Earth. The cakes consist of honey, spring water, sea salt, wheat flour, eggs and animal fat. One paten is set aside for the ritual hosts. These should be obtained from a Nazarene place of worship - but if this is not possible, they are made by the Priestess in imitation of them (unlevened white hosts). The Mass The Priestess signifies the beginning of the Mass by clapping her hands together twice. The Mistress of Earth turns to the congregation, makes the sign of the inverted pentagram with her left hand, saying: I will go down to the altars in Hell. The Priestess responds by saying:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 To Satan, the giver of life. All: Our Father which wert in heaven hallowed be thy name In heaven as it is on Earth. Give us this day our ecstasy And deliver us to evil as well as temptation For we are your kingdom for aeons and aeons.

I believe in one Prince, Satan, who reigns over this Earth, And in one Law, Chaos, which triumphs over all. And I believe in one Temple Our Temple to Satan, and in one Word which dwells in us all: The Word of ecstasy. And I believe in the Law of the Aeon, Which is sacrifice, and in the letting of blood For which I shed no tears since I give praise to my Prince The fire-giver and look forward to his reign And the pleasures that are to come! The Mistress kisses the Master, then turns to the congregation, saying: May Satan be with you. Master: Veni, omnipotens aeternae diabolus! Mistress: By the word of the Prince of Darkness, I give praise to you (She kisses the lips of the altar-Priest) My Prince, bringer of light, darkness and fire, I greet you Who causes us to struggle and seek the forbidden thoughts. (The Master repeats the 'Veni' chant) Mistress: Blessed are the strong for they shall inherit the Earth. (She kisses the chest of the altar-Priest) Blessed are the proud for they shall breed gods! (She kisses the penis of the altar-Priest)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Let the humble and the meek die in their misery! (She kisses the Master who passes the kiss on to the Priestess who kisses each member of the congregation. After this, she hands the paten containing the 'hosts' to the Mistress. The Mistress holds the paten over the altar-Priest, saying:) Praised are you, my Prince and lover, by the strong: Through our evil we have this dirt; by our boldness and Strength, it will become for us a joy in this life. All: Hail Satan, Prince of life! (The Mistress places the paten on the body of the altar-Priest, saying quietly:) Suscipe, Satanas, munus quad tibi offerimus memoriam Recolentes vindex. (The Priestess, quietly saying 'Sanctissimi Corporis Satanas', begins to masturbate the altar-Priest. As she does, the congregation begin to clap their hands and shout in encouragement while the Master and the Mistress chant the 'Veni' chant. The Priestess allows the semen to fall upon the 'hosts', then hands the paten to the Mistress who holds it up before the congregation saying to them:) May the gifts of Satan be forever with you. All: As they are with you! (The Mistress returns the paten to the body of the altar-Priest, takes up one of the chalices, saying:) Praised are you, my Prince, by the defiant: through our Arrogance and pride We have this drink: let it become for us an elixir of life. (She sprinkles some of the wine over the altar-Priest and towards the congregation, then returns the chalice to the altar, saying to the congregation:) With pride in my heart I give praise to those who drove The nails And he who thrust the spear into the body of Yeshua, The imposter. May his followers rot in their rejection and filth! (The Master addresses the congregation saying:) Do you renounce Yeshua, the great deceiver, and all his works"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 All: We do renounce the Nazarene Yeshua, the great deceiver And all his works. Master: Do you affirm Satan? All: We do affirm Satan!

(She gives the paten to the Priestess, then removes the robe of the Priestess, saying:) Remember, all you gathered here, nothing is beautiful except Man: But most beautiful of all is Woman. (The Priestess gives the paten back to the Mistress, then takes the chalices and consecrated cakes to the congregation who eat and drink. When all have finished, the Mistress holds up the paten, saying:) Behold, the dirt of the earth which the humble will eat! (The congregation laughs while the Mistress flings the 'hosts' at them which they trample underfoot while the Master continues with the 'Agios o Satanas' vibration. The Mistress claps her hands three times to signal to the congregation. She then says: Dance, I command you! (The congregation then begin a dance, counter sunwise, chanting 'Satan! Satan!' while they dance. The Priestess catches them one by one, kisses the person caught and then removes their robe after which they return to the dance. The Mistress stands in the centre of the dancers, and uplifting her arms, says:) Let the church of the imposter Yeshua crumble into dust Let all the scum who worship the rotting fish suffer and die in their misery and rejection! We trample on them and spit of their sin! Let there be ecstasy and darkness; let there be chaos and laughter, Let there be sacrifice and strife: but above all let us enjoy The gifts of life!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 (She signals to the Priestess who stops the dancer of her choice. The congregation then pair off, and the orgy of lust begins. The Mistress helps the altar-Priest down from the altar, and he joins in the festivities if he wishes.) Should the Master and Mistress wish, the energies of the ritual are then directed by them towards a specific intention. NOTES: During the 'consecration' of the 'hosts', the Master may opt to say the following quietly (leaving the Veni chant to the Mistress): Muem suproc mine tse cob He then takes up the chalice, saying: Murotaccep menoissimer ni rutednuffe sitlum orp iuq iedif muiretsym itnematset inretea ivon iem siniugnas xilac mine tse cih. It is this chalice which the Mistress then takes to sprinkle the altar-Priest. The above words are usually printed on a small card which is placed on the altar before the Mass begins: the Master using the card when the above is spoken. As with all ceremonial rituals, it is helpful if all participants know from memory the content and spoken text. It is important that this is done and that the ritual, when undertaken, follows the text on every occasion. The ritual then is more effective as a ritual, enabling the participants to be both more relaxed and more able to enter into the spirit of the rite. V The Ceremony of Birth Setting: Indoor Temple, or outdoor area previously used for rituals. Participants: Master - black robes tied with crimson girdle Mistress - black robes tied with crimson sash Priestess - white robes tied with black sash Priest - white robes tied with black girdle Congregation (if present): black robes Preparation: Black candles on altar together with quartz crystal or tetrahedron. Phial of musk oil (if male child) or civit oil (if female child). Incense of Yew to be burnt (male child) or Black Poplar (female child). Before the ceremony the parents of the child appoint two Temple Members as guardians of the newborn. They also provide a small"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 pendant made of silver inscribed with an inverted septagon (or sigil of the Temple) which, for the ceremony, they hang around the neck of the newborn on a leather thong. When the child is old enough, this can be worn by them all the time. A feast, to follow the ceremony, is prepared. The newborn is brought to the ceremony loosely wrapped in black cloth. The Ceremony: The Master signifies the beginning of the rite by ringing the Temple bell seven times. The parents then hand the newborn to the Priestess if the child is male, and to the Priest if female. The Master then says: We gather here to welcome the newborn destined to share our gifts. Mistress: Agios o Satanas! Congregation: Agios o Satanas! (The Mistress turns toward the altar, holds her hands outstretched and says quietly but in an audible voice:) Veni, omnipotens aeterne Diabolus! (She then turns back to the participants, saying:) Agios o Baphomet! Congregation: Agios o Baphomet! (Note: if no congregation are present the responses are said by the Priestess et al.) (The Master touches the head of the newborn saying:) May the gifts of Satan be forever with you, as they are with us. Pone, diabolus, custodiam. With this mark I seal wyrd. (The Mistress hands him the phial and he anoints the forehead of the newborn with it in the shape of an inverted pentagram or the sigil of the Temple saying as he does this:) Ad Satanas qui leatificat juventutem meam. (He then turns to the parents, saying:) How is he/she to be known? (The parents answer, giving the Temple name they have chosen for the newborn:) We have named him/her .......

The Master says to them:) Do you, so chosen, pledge to guard and watch over this newborn and to teach when the teaching-time is right, our ways so that ....... (He states the Temple name of the newborn) may learn our ways? (The guardians answer:' We do. 'The Master then turns to the congregation, saying:) See them! Hear them! Know them! (The Mistress hands him the phial and he anoints each of their foreheads with the sign of the inverted pentagram or the sigil of the Temple. He then turns toward the congregation saying:) So it is done according to our ways. Let the feasting begin! (The participants leave the Temple to partake of the feast -this is provided by members of the Temple, to honour the parents of the newborn, who may also provide gifts for the newborn and the parents.)* VI The Death Rite Participants: Priest - in black robes Priestess - naked, upon altar Mistress - crimson robes, sexually alluring Congregation - black robes tied with crimson cord Temple Preparation: Black candles on altar. Small silver Temple bell. Incense of Mars to be used (musk). A small wooden coffin (suitable in size for the wax effigy which will be made), draped in black, is placed near the altar and a handful of graveyard earth is placed on it. Before the ritual proper begins, the Mistress makes a wax figurine in a corner of the Temple with only the Priestess present. (The easiest way to make the effigy is to place several white candles in a receptacle containing water which has just been boiled. After a while, the wax will form a thin film on the surface."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 This wax can then be used to fashion, by hand, the figurine which should be made as life-like as possible.) The Priestess lies naked upon the altar. The Mistress places this figurine on the womb of the Priestess, then moves it symbolically downwards to rest between her thighs. She anoints it with a musk-based oil, saying: 'I who made you and delivered you in birth now name you N.N.' (She states the full name of the victim.) The Mistress and the Priestess then visualize the figurine as the intended victim - and they may if they wish then dress it as the victim dresses. The image is then placed on the womb of the Priestess, the Mistress ringing the bell thirteen times to signify the beginning of the ritual at which the Priest leads the congregation into the Temple. The Ritual Priest: I will go down to the altars in Hell. All: To Satan, the giver of life. (The Priest then kisses the Priestess on the lips, turns toward the congregation and makes the sign of the inverted pentagram, saying:) Our Father which wert in heaven ... (The congregation join him in the Satanic Our Father - see Black Mass for text. The Priest then leads the congregation in saying the Satanic Creed: 'I believe ...' - see text in Black Mass. After the Creed the Priest says:) Provide us pleasure, Prince of Darkness, and help us fulfil our desires. (He turns and fondles the Priestess, saying:) With ecstasy we give praise to our Prince. (The congregation chant the Sanctus Satanas - see Chants -as the Priest says quietly over the waxen image:) Sie anod namretae meiuqer.

(The Mistress picks up the image, holds it for the congregation to see and then places it on the graveyard earth, folding the black cloth over it. She places the cloth with the earth and image within it, inside the coffin. She turns to the congregation, saying:) N.N. is dead. (The congregation begin to dance, counter sunwise, chanting the Diabolus (see chants). After the chant, they gather round the coffin and the Mistress. The Priest says to them:) Fratres, ut meum ac vestrum sacrificium acceptabile fiat apud Satanas. (The Priest has sexual intercourse on the altar with the Priestess while the congregation clap their hands in approval, chanting 'Ave Satanas!' repeatedly as they do so. After the climax, the Priest withdraws, the Mistress kisses the Priestess on the lips and then 'locis muliebribus'. She then kisses each member of the congregation. The Priest, after this, makes the sign of the inverted pentagram over the coffin, saying loudly:) N.N. is dead and we all have shared in this death. N.N. is dead and we rejoice !

The Mistress takes the coffin to a small grave, outside, prepared beforehand. She places the coffin in Earth, covers it with earth saying: 'N.N. you are dead, now, killed by our curse.' She completes the burial and leaves the area.) VII The Pledging (Note: this is the traditional Satanic wedding ceremony.) Setting: Temple - or outdoor area within circle of nine stones. Participants: Master - purple robes Mistress - viridian robes Priestess and Priest - black robes Congregation - black robes (Those who are making their pledge wear crimson robes) Preparation: Altar covered with black cloth on which is woven the sigil of the Tree of Wyrd with the connecting paths. Purple candles to be used. Chalices of mead. Silver bowl on altar containing inflammable liquid. Small square of parchment. Sharp knife. Two silver rings, provided by those making their pledge. Ash incense to be burnt. The Ceremony The congregation, et al, assemble in the Temple: the Master and Mistress standing before the altar with the Priest and Priestess beside them. When all is ready, the Master rings the Temple bell nine times as a signal to the Guardian who leads those desirous of pledging into the Temple where they stand before the altar. The Master and Mistress greet both with a kiss, saying: We, Master and Mistress of the Temple greet you."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 (The Priestess and the Priest together chant 'Agios o Satanas Agios o Satanas!'

Let it be known among you and others of our kind, that should anyone here assembled or dwelling elsewhere seek to render asunder this jarl and his lady against the desire of that jarl and that lady, then shall that person or persons be cursed, cast out and made by our magick to die a miserable death!

She swiftly cuts their thumbs, presses drops of each blood onto the parchment and then presses the two thumbs together. She then presses the thumb of the jarl to the forehead of the lady and then the thumb of the lady against the forehead of the jarl, marking both in blood. The parchment is cast into the silver bowl and the Priestess lights the liquid in this. The following statement is then read out first by the lady and then the jarl. This statement is usually written/printed on a card which is kept on the altar and handed to the lady by the Priest after the Priestess ignites the liquid in the bowl:) Esse filo captum palchritudinis suae, et nil amplius desiderare, quam ejus amplexu frui: et omen concubitum - ex commixtione hominis cum Diabolo et Baphomet aliquoties nascuntur hominis, et tali modo nasciturum esse Anti-Nazarenus.

"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 VIII The Rite of Initiation Introduction: The candidate is usually sponsored by an existing Initiate, and this member accompanies the candidate during the test of fidelity which the Master or Mistress of the Temple specifies. The candidate also undergoes a test of knowledge (relating to what he or she has learned of Temple teachings during the six-month probationary period) and a test of courage. The text given below is for a male candidate: for a female candidate, the text should be altered in the appropriate places. Participants: Master of the Temple - in scarlet robes Mistress of Earth - sexually alluring scarlet robes Priestess - naked, upon altar (if male candidate) Priest - naked, upon altar (if female candidate) Guardian of the Temple - dressed in black and wearing a face mask Congregation - Black robes Preparation: The candidate provides a new black robe, designed according to the precepts of the Temple. This is given to the Master before the ritual and placed on the altar. The candidate attends the ritual in a coarse brown garment which can be easily removed. The ritual takes place at sunset. A small phial containing a civit-based oil is placed on the altar. Black candles are to be used, incense of the Moon burnt (petriochor, if available, otherwise hazel). Some symbolism appropriate to the Moon should also be present - e.g. quartz crystals. Chalices full of strong wine. The congregation assemble in the Temple with the Master and Mistress. The Guardian stands near the Temple entrance. The candidate is blindfolded and is led into the Temple by the sponsor.

And with the beating of your feet Raise the legions of our Lord and the Dark Gods who watch Over our games! (The congregation now dance, anti-sunwise, chanting the Diabolus as they dance. While they dance the Master takes a chalice and raises it, saying:) You the nameless have come to break the chains that bind! (The Mistress removes the garment of the candidate leaving naked. The Master approaches him, puts the chalice to his lips, saying: 'Drink!' The candidate drinks the wine. The congregation continue their dance and chant until the Mistress raises her arms as a signal for them to stop. She says to them:) Gather round, my children, and feel the flesh of our gift! (The congregation gather round the candidate and run their hands over all his body. While they do this, laughing, the Master chants the 'Veni' chant several times. The Mistress claps her hands twice and the congregation move away. She kisses the candidate [whether male or female] and says:) We the noble rejoice that you have come to seed us with your blood and gifts. We, kin of Chaos, welcome you, now nameless.

The Mistress then stands behind the candidate and traces with her left forefinger, the sigil of the Temple on the back of the candidate, chanting 'Agios o Satanas' as she does so. If there be no Temple sigil, she traces the inverted pentagram. She stands before the candidate. If the candidate is male, she kisses him on the forehead, then the lips, the chest and penis. If the candidate is female, she kisses her on the forehead, each breast, then pubis. After this, she claps her hands once as a signal for the Guardian to come forward. As he does, she says to the candidate:) Now you must be taught the wisdom of our way! (The Guardian seizes the candidate and holds his/her arms, forcing them to kneel before the Mistress who laughs and says:) See, all you gathered in my Temple: here is he who thought He knew our secret - he who secretly admired himself for His cunning! See how our strength overcomes him! (The congregation laugh while the Master blindfolds the candidate again. The Guardian then binds the hands of the candidate with cord. The Mistress then whispers to the candidate, saying: 'Lay down, keep your silence and be still!' The congregation and the Guardian leave the Temple. The Master then has sexual intercourse with the Priestess on the altar [or if the candidate is female, the Mistress has intercourse with the Priest]. In both versions, this task may be delegated to a member of the congregation, chosen before the ritual by either the Master or Mistress. The male or female member so chosen stays in the Temple when the congregation depart. After-the act, the Priestess [or Priest] is assisted down from the altar, and the Master and Mistress [and the one chosen to perform in their stead, if present] leave the Temple. The Priestess [or Priest then approaches the candidate, saying:) Receive from me and through me the gift of your Initiation So it has been, so it is, and so shall it be again. (They then unbind and remove the blindfold from the candidate and sexual intercourse takes place. After, the Priestess [or Priest] fetches the robe from the altar and dresses the candidate in it. She"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 [or he] then briefly leaves the Temple to announce to the congregation et al “So-it is done according to our desires!” The congregation et al then return to the Temple, each greeting the new Initiate with a kiss. The chalices are handed round, and the members take their pleasure as they wish.) NOTES: For the ritual of Initiation, the Priestess is chosen for the pleasure she obtains from coitus, the Guardian for his physical strength; if the candidate is female, the altar-priest chosen for his control during coitus - he should bring the Mistress to ecstasy, without himself losing control, thus saving elixir for the candidate. It is the duty of the Mistress to find among the Temple members someone to fulfil this role, although she may delegate this task to a female member of the Temple, the person being chosen by the obvious experimentation. Those thus chosen are then invested with their office of altar-Priest or Priestess and hold this office for a year and a day. If possible, candidates should know no details of the Rite of Initiation - i.e. they should not be told what to expect. For this reason, members of the Temple should take a vow of silence regarding the Rite, promising not to reveal its details to non-members and candidates, Thus, the 'Black Book' should for this and other reasons never be shown to non-Initiates. IX Consecration of the Temple Preparations: Incense of Mars to be burnt for several hours before the ritual is due to begin. The Temple itself is furnished as for a Black Mass. One chalice contains The Elixir. (To make The Elixir: the night before the ritual, the Master has sexual intercourse in the Temple [the Temple having been already furnished, with altar etc.] at the moment of his ecstasy depositing his seed in an empty chalice. To this, the Priestess ad adds seven drops of her own blood [taken from her left forefinger following intercourse], three pinches of soil [finely ground and dried] taken from a grave in a graveyard on the night of the full moon, ground and dried shavings from an oak tree collected on a night when Saturn is rising, and strong wine to fill the chalice. The chalice is left on the altar until the ritual begins.) The Master enters the Temple before the congregation, and seals the dimensions according to the Rite of Sealing: For this, a crystal tetrahedron is required. It should be as large as possible and made of quartz. The person conducting the rite,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 places both their hands on the crystal (which may be on an altar) and visualizes a rent appearing in a star studded sky. This rent gradually spreads its darkness down toward the crystal, enclosing it and the surroundings. The person then vibrates: Binan Ath Ga Wath Am. This vibration is repeated seven times. The person then says: From dark dimensions I call them forth! The person then visualizes a darkness entering the crystal. After, the person bows to the crystal. The Rite is then complete, the person removing their hands and moving away from the crystal. Participants: Master of the Temple - in black robes Priestess - in black robes Congregation - in black robes (Note: if the group in question is run by a Mistress, then she assumes the role allocated to the Master, and a Priest is present instead of a Priestess. For producing the Elixir, the procedure above is followed although the blood is that of the Mistress and the seed that of the Priest.) The Dedication The Master goes to the entrance of the Temple, and ushers the congregation in. They enter chanting the Sanctus Satanas (see Chants) walking counter sunwise three times around the altar. They continue chanting until the Master claps his hands twice. He stands behind the altar, facing the congregation, the Priestess beside him. He says to the congregation: We gather here to dedicate this Temple to our sinister work. We Summon forth Satan, Prince of Darkness and Guardian of our Gate, To witness this rite of Dedication. For we shall find and drink the Elixir which is black to the blind. Mindful then of our past which has made this Work possible, let us re-affirm our Creed. (All present recite the 21 Satanic Points.

From dark dimensions they will come while others sleep. (He places the chalice back upon the altar, spreads his hands over the crystal tetrahedron and vibrates 'Nythra' three times. After this, he takes up the chalice, sprinkles some of its contents toward the congregation and Priestess and then over the altar. He then sprinkles more around the entrance to the Temple before walking counter sunwise around the Temple sprinkling the walls and floor. He then pours the remainder of the contents around the base of the altar. He replaces the empty chalice on the altar, turns to the congregation, saying:) As it has been, so it is and so shall it be again! Let the Rite of The Black Mass begin! (He assists the one chosen beforehand as altar-Priest to remove his robe and take his place upon the altar. The Mass then begins. The Mass follows the text in the Black Book except that the Priestess assumes both the role of the Mistress and her own role as Priestess, and the Master concludes the Mass with the following words [after the 'Mistress' has said '... let us enjoy the gifts of life.']) By my Power - the Power of Satan, Prince of Darkness - I Declare this Temple charged! (The usual orgy/feast that follows the Black Mass begins.) X The Dying time Setting: Outdoors, in an isolated location. A funeral pyre is prepared by the Guardian. An ellipse of nine stones should be made enclosing the pyre. Wooden goblets, sufficient in number for each participant, should be filled with mead and kept ready on a wooden table (oak if possible) away from the pyre. Participants: Master Mistress Priest Priestess Congregation"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Guardian (all are in black robes) Additional Guardians may be appointed to guard access to the site, ensuring privacy. The Rite (The body of the deceased member is brought in a light wooden casket, carried by members of the Temple toward the stones and the pyre. It is covered with a crimson drape. After the casket has been placed on the pyre, all present gather round, outside the ellipse of stones. The Master begins the Rite by saying:) Agios o Satanas! We gather here to pay homage to our brother/sister who by his/her life and magick did deeds of glory to the honour of our name! Agios o Satanas! Congregation: Agios o Satanas!

As it burns, the Master drinks from his goblet, throwing the empty vessel into the flames. The congregation et al then raise their own goblets, say the 'Ad Satanas' chant, drink and likewise cast the empty goblets into the flames. The Mistress is the last to drink. After she has thrown her own goblet, she says:) May our memories linger to haunt the spaces and the dark!

It is the duty of the Guardian [and his helpers, if any) to attend to and watch over the pyre, ensuring the casket and contents are reduced by flames. What remains is left, to be scattered as it will.) XI The Ceremony of Recalling Introduction: The Ceremony exists in three versions. The one given here is the one most often used today - where the 'Sacrificial Conclusion' is symbolic. In former times, the Priest, having been chosen according to tradition a year before, was ritually sacrificed by the Mistress and Master. This version is published in OPFER (Fenrir Vol II No 2).This sacrificial Ceremony traditionally occurs once every cycle of seventeen years. Preparations: The night before the ritual, the Priestess bakes the consecrated cakes made from wheat, water (spring), egg, honey and animal fat. The congregation gather outside the Temple, the Master and Mistress wait within. The Guardian leads the Priest toward the congregation and the Priestess blindfolds the Priest. She then leads him to each member of the Temple who kiss him. The Temple itself is furnished with red candles; Incense of Jupiter to be burning. Quartz tetrahedron on plinth or altar. Phial containing musk oil. Participants: Master - in black robes Mistress of Earth - white robes Priestess - in a red robe tied with a white sash Guardian of the Temple - black robe, with face mask Priest ('The Chosen One'/Opfer) - white robe Congregation - red robes The Ceremony (The Priestess and Guardian lead the Priest into the Temple and are followed by the congregation. The Mistress greets the Priest with a kiss while the Master vibrates [with his hands on the tetrahedron] 'Agios o Atazoth'. After this, the congregation chant the 'Diabolus' [see Chants] while slowly walking, counter sunwise, around the Priest in a circle. This chant is repeated seven times. The Master and Mistress [or two Temple members chosen and trained as Cantors] then chant in parallel and a fourth apart according to the Principles of Esoteric"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 Chant, the 'Agios o Baphomet' chant. This chant may be an octave and a fourth apart. However, should for whatever reason, those conducting the ritual be unable to chant in this manner, the Agios o Baphomet may be vibrated seven times according to the principles of esoteric vibration. [The magick is more powerful if the chant is sung in parallel as indicated.] During this, the Guardian lifts the Priest onto the altar and the Priestess removes his robe. After the chant, the Mistress then anoints the body of the Priest with the oil while the congregation walk, as before, chanting the Diabolus. After the anointing, the Priestess and Mistress remove their robes, the Priestess then arouses the 'secret fire' of the Priest with her lips - without bringing him to ecstasy however. When she is satisfied, she signals to the Guardian who lifts the Priest from the altar and forces him to kneel before the Priestess. The Master then kneels before the Mistress at which point the congregation cease their chanting and gather round forming a circle. The Priestess copies the Mistress in both words and actions, using the Priest. The Mistress places her hands on the head of the Master and the Master says:) It is the protection and juices of your body that I seek (The Mistress opens her thighs, and the Master drinks. The Guardian forces the Priest to do likewise to the Priestess. Then, the Mistress pushes him away, saying:) As you have drunk so shall you die! Master: I pour my kisses at your feet and kneel before you Who crushes your enemies and who washes in a basin full of Their blood. I lift my eyes to gaze upon the beauty of body - You who are the daughter of and a Gate to our Dark Gods: They who are never named. I lift my voice to stand (He here stands) Before you my sister and offer you my body so that my Mage's seed shall feed your virgin flesh. Mistress: Kiss me and I shall make you as an eagle to its prey. Touch me and I shall make you as a strong sword that Severs and stains my Earth with blood. Taste me and I shall make you as a seed of corn which Grows toward the sun and never dies. Plough me and plant me With your seed And I shall make you as a Gate which opens to our gods! (The Mistress goes to the Priest and whispers to him:)"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 Take me, for she is me and I am yours! (She then removes the blindfold and pushes him into the arms of the Priestess. She then has congress with the Master while the congregation continue with their slow walk and chanting. After the priest has achieved his ecstasy, the Mistress says:) So you have sown and from your sowing gifts may come if You obedient heed these words I speak. (The Guardian gives her the sash from the robe of the Priestess. She claps her hands twice and the congregation, the - Priest and Priestess gather round her, the Master and the Guardian She says:) I know you my dark children: you are sinister yet none Of you is as sinister or as deadly as I. I know you and the thoughts within all your hearts: Yet not one of you is as hateful or as loving as I. With a glance I can strike you dead! (She goes to each member, kissing them in turn on the lips and removing their robes. She then points to the Priest and the Guardian comes forward to hold him while she binds his hands with the sash. She then blindfolds him and the Guardian lays him on the floor, covering his prostrate body with the robe of the Mistress. He lies still and motionless while the Mistress says to the congregation:) No guilt shall bind you here; no thought restrict. Feast then and enjoy but ever remember that I am the Wind that snatches your soul! (The Guardian then leaves the Temple, returning with trays of wine and food prepared before-hand. The congregation feast and drink and take their pleasures according to their desire always leaving a circle around the Priest clear [the circle may be drawn on the floor before the Ceremony and the Priest placed within it by the Guardian at the appropriate point]. The feasting and pleasures continue until the altar candles are burnt to a line inscribed previously by the Master - this being of sufficient duration for plentiful pleasures to be enjoyed. At this point the Mistress claps her hands seven times and the congregation et al [apart from Mistress, Priestess and Master] leave the Temple. The Priestess removes the blindfold of the Priest, unbinds and uncovers him and helps him to his feet. She then leads him out from the Temple. The Master and Mistress then take their own pleasure, directing the energies of their own congress and those present within the Temple toward a specific aim or intention.)"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 NOTES: 1) During the feasting, the Master and Mistress abstain and instead begin to direct the energy released via the Ceremony into the crystal (using visualization etc). This energy may then be left stored there, or they may elect to release it during the conclusion toward the aim or intention. However, should they wish, they may direct the energy into the Priest. If this is done the Priest should be informed beforehand and told to observe the effects over several days. This latter procedure is intended mainly for new initiates and is an aid to their magickal development. 2) The Ceremony may be performed on a regular basis, the Master choosing the Priest who is notified only just before the start of the ritual. The ceremony may also be performed with a Priestess as 'Opfer', the ritual following the text above except that the roles of the Priest and Priestess are reversed. 3) At the discretion of the Master or Mistress, the Ceremony may be extended - the Priest (or Priestess) being left in the Temple over night, the Ceremony in this instance being begun at sunset and finally concluding at sunrise. For this extension, the energy present is always sent into the Priest (or Priestess). The person chosen for this can be any member of the Temple. In this, the Master, Mistress and Priestess leave the congregation, the member chosen being told to remain lying and unmoving until the Master returns at dawn. XII Satanic Orders For a long time, traditional Satanism was taught on an individual basis from Master (or Mistress) to pupil/Initiate, this Initiate following the path to Adeptship under guidance. When ceremonial rituals were undertaken, it was in secret with only members of long standing attending. The few Initiates that were accepted had to undergo a probationary period of several years before being allowed to participate. It was one of the duties of the Master and Mistress to guide their pupils along the difficult path toward magickal mastery, and to this end 'internal magick' was employed, this system of internal magick being gradually extended and refined over the centuries. In its initial stages, genuine Satanism is all about the Initiate experiencing the dark or shadow aspect of themselves and in the past the Initiate was instructed to experience in reality many things. Sometimes, the Master or Mistress would lead them into specific situations (some of which would be dangerous) for the Initiate to learn from them. Some of these experiences were"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 unconventional and frowned on by 'conventional society' -and some would have been 'illegal' as well. Of course, such methods were difficult, but for the Initiates who survived or remained at liberty they provided genuine experience and self insight. However, gradually, (at least in traditional Satanism) a means was found to 'short-circuit' these evolutionary experiences: whereas in the past most of them would have been practical in the sense of taking the individual to his or her limits, the new techniques became 'internalized'. That is, they tended to be magickally based rather than practical. The essence of the new methods was and still is the 'Grade Rituals'. The Grade Rituals (the first of which is Initiation) are a series of tasks and undertakings, and the individual who follows the procedure of a Grade Ritual (the main Grade Rituals are given in detail in NAOS - A Practical Guide to Sinister Hermetic Magick') will achieve magickal understanding and self insight of a kind appropriate to the Grade Ritual being undertaken. There are seven Grade Rituals, and these take the individual from Initiate to External Adept to Internal Adept and thence to Master/Mistress and beyond. Associated with the Grade Rituals are other tasks, and these form the basis of the training of the Satanic Initiate. By their very nature, they produce a specific type of individual: one, that is, imbued with the Satanist spirit. The Grade Ritual of Internal Adept involves the individual in living in isolation for at least three months, and if this is undertaken according to the principles of the rite itself, the individual will emerge as a genuine Adept. Naturally, this ritual is not easy. The next stage involves the individual in entering the Abyss: Of becoming part of the acausal, that is, of allowing acausal/ chaotic energies to enter consciousness without any means of Conscious control, This magickal part of the Grade Ritual is Preceded by a physical part (for men: walking alone and unaided a distance of 80 miles beginning at sunrise on the first day and ending at sunset on the second day; for women: the distance is 56 miles). This physical part is essential (and the time limit and conditions must be rigidly observed) since it drains the candidate both physically and mentally, the candidate then having few 'barriers'. This ritual is also not easy to undertake. Thus it can be seen that the training of Initiates in genuine Satanic Orders is both comprehensive and difficult, for Satanic Orders are not religious institutions committed to indoctrinating their members, just as they are not groups for the discussion and study of magickal and Occult topics. They are places where real sinister magick is undertaken - this real magick is difficult and may"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 at times be dangerous. Genuine Satanists do not talk - they do; they do not seek to study obscure legends and myths pertaining to the dark side - they become, through sinister magick, the dark side itself; they do not flit from one 'group' to another, from one system to another - they follow the techniques of the seven-fold way, under guidance, to the very end refusing to give in when things become difficult and dangerous. In short, they exemplify the spirit of the Satanist: that life-affirming ecstasy which both conquers and defies. XIII Sinister Chant Sinister chant is divided into three distinct methods, all of which have the same general aim - to produce magickal energy. The type and effect of this energy varies according to the method employed. The first method is the vibration of words and phrases; the second is chanting, and the third is 'Esoteric Chant' - that is, the following of a specific text which is chanted in one of the esoteric modes. Esoteric Chant is explained in detail in NAOS. Vibration is the simplest method, and involves the individual 'projecting' the sound. A deep breath is taken, and the first part of the word to be vibrated is 'expelled' with the exhalation of breath. This exhalation must be controlled - that is, the intensity of sound should be prolonged (not less than ten seconds for each part of the word) and as constant as possible. The person undertaking the vibration then inhales, and the process is repeated for the second part of the word and so on. Thus 'Satanas' would be vibrated as Sa - tan - as. The vibration is not a shout or a scream but a concentration of sound energy. Vibration should involve the whole body and should be a physical effort. Regular practice is essential in mastering the technique, and the individual should learn to project at varying distances (from ten to thirty feet or more) as well as enhance the power of the vibration itself. The essence of the method is controlled sound of the same intensity throughout each part of the word and the whole word and/or text. Chanting is essentially the singing of words or text in a regular 'monotone' - that is, in the same key, although the last part of the chant is usually 'embellished' to a certain extent by first chanting on a higher note and then a lower one.

Introduction A Satanist Temple or group can be formed for three reasons: 1) to practice authentic Satanism; 2) to experience the reality of Sinister Magick; and 3) as a task of the External Adept. This part of the 'Black Book' applies to all three: those who have not as yet been Initiated by an established traditional Satanist Temple but who wish to begin practical Satanism for whatever personal reason, should undertake the ritual of Self-Initiation given in"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 chapter XI, then put into practice the advice given in chapter XII about organizing and running a practical group. If you undertake the self-Initiation, you should as soon as possible find an individual of the opposite sex who is interested in Black Magick. You can then Initiate this person, using the ritual of Initiation in Part One as your guide. You should find somewhere suitable to use as a Temple and dedicate this according to the Dedication in Part One. You should then give your Temple a suitable Sinister name (such as The Temple of Satan) and begin to recruit members, your companion acting as Priestess/Priest and/or Mistress/Master. The gifts and joys of Satan will then be yours to enjoy. However, should you wish to go further and begin the sevenfold sinister way, you should obtain a copy of 'Naos' and begin to undertake hermetic and internal magick, continuing with your running your Temple until and if you decide to undertake the Grade Ritual of Internal Adept. The choice is yours. XIV Self-Initiation Two rituals will be given - one for an indoor location, and one for an outdoor one. Choose the one you feel is most suitable for you. I - Indoor Set aside an area for the performance of the ritual and in this erect an altar and cover it with a black cloth. (The altar may be a table,). Obtain some black candles, some candle holders, some hazel incense, a quartz crystal or crystals. You will also need two small squares of parchment (or expensive woven paper), a quill type pen, a sharp knife, some sea salt, a handful of graveyard earth (obtained on a night of the new moon) and a chalice which you should fill with wine. All of these items should be placed on the altar. Should you wish, you may also obtain a black robe of suitable design. If not, you should dress all in black for the ritual. An hour before sunset, enter your Temple area, face east and chant the Sanctus Satanas twice. Then say, loudly, To you, Satan, Prince of Darkness and Lord of the Earth, I dedicate this Temple: let it become, like my body, A vessel for your power and an expression of your glory! Then vibrate 'Agios o Satanas' nine times. After this, take up the salt and sprinkle it over the altar and around the room, saying: With this salt I seal the power of Satan in!"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Take the earth and cast it likewise, saying: With this earth I dedicate my Temple. Satanas - venire! Satanas venire! Agios 0 Baphomet! I am god imbued with your glory! Then light the candles on the altar, burn plentiful incense and leave the Temple. Take a bath, and then return to the Temple. Once in the Temple, do the 'Sinister Blessing' (see Appendix), then facing the altar, lightly prick your left forefinger with the knife. With the blood and using the pen inscribe on one parchment the Occult name you have chosen (see Appendix III for some suggestions regarding names). On the other inscribe an inverted pentagram. Hold both parchments up to the East saying: With my blood I dedicate the Temple of my life! Then turn counter sunwise three times, saying: I ...... (state the Occult name you have chosen) am here to begin my sinister quest! Prince of Darkness, hear my oath! Baphomet, Mistress of Earth, hear me! Hear me, you Dark Gods waiting beyond the Abyss! Burn the parchments in the candles. (Note: it is often more practical to fill a vessel with spirit and place the parchments in this and then set the spirit alight. However if you have chosen woven paper, this method will not be necessary.) As they burn, say: Satan, may your power mingle with mine as my blood now mingles with fire! Take up the chalice, raise it to the East, saying: With this drink I seal my oath. I am yours and shall do works to the glory of your name! Drain the chalice, extinguish the candles and then depart from the Temple. The Initiation is then complete. * * * II - Outdoor Find a suitable outdoor area. It should be near a stream, lake or river. The ritual should be conducted on the night of the full moon at a time half way between sunset and sunrise. You will need: ambergris oil, black candles (in lanterns if possible), two squares of parchment or woven paper, sharp knife or silver pen, quill-type pen, black robe or clothes. Chalice full of wine.

Drain the chalice, extinguish the candles, collect all the items you have used and depart from the area. The Initiation is then complete. XV Organising and running Satanic Temples One of the purposes of the Temple is to perform ceremonial Satanic rituals on a regular basis, and the following schedule is suggested: a) Once a month (at a new moon if possible) celebrate the Black Mass. This celebration should be followed by a feast where food and wine prepared and/or brought to the Temple by the members is consumed, this feast itself following on after the orgy that concludes the Black Mass. Should you, as organiser of the Temple (and thus an honoury 'Master' or 'Mistress'- the organiser of a new Temple is generally known by the title of 'Choregos') wish, the feast only may conclude the Mass - it being left to your discretion as to when the orgy is to be included. That is, it is not always necessary to conclude the Mass with an orgy, although for obvious Satanic reasons, it forms a pleasing end to the Mass. b) Every fortnight, the members should assemble for a meeting (a sunedrion) where any member may request magickal aid for themselves or others. The aid may be of any kind - constructive, material, or destructive. Those wishing aid should write their requests on paper and seal this in an envelope which they place in a special urn/receptacle kept for this purpose near the entrance to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 the Temple. The members should assemble (in robes and barefoot) in the Temple, and the sunedrion is formally begun by you, the Choregos, saying 'Let the sunedrion begin'. If a member has been appointed Guardian (see the list of Offices at the end of the chapter) he should stand by the entrance to the Temple and refuse admittance to any members arriving late. Those present in the Temple then recite the Satanic Creed (see text of Black Mass). Following this, the Priestess then removes at random two of the requests, which she reads. The members who have been chosen thus, acknowledge their requests by bowing to the Priestess. The request first chosen by the Priestess is performed that evening, the other at the next full moon. This means that you as Choregos should have everything in readiness for all possible hermetic and ceremonial rituals. The requests may be for anything a member wishes, and it is up to you to decide how the request may be magickally fulfilled by choosing an appropriate ceremonial or hermetic ritual. The monthly Black Mass may be used as a vehicle, for example - you choosing suitable chants/visualizations for the members desire. The member requesting help must offer something in return this is usually a financial donation to the Temple, a ritual object for use in the Temple, robes for use of members, or their own body for the gratification of the Choregos or someone chosen by the Choregos. It is however, the member requesting magickal aid who decides on the nature of the gift. Those requests not chosen by the Priestess are considered by the Choregos after the sunedrion, and those considered suitable are undertaken as soon as possible, the members being informed. If you as Choregos choose a hermetic ritual for a request, then you either work alone or with the member whose request it is - unless the ritual you choose is a hermetic one, when you work with the Priestess/Priest or the member if that member has offered their body as payment for the aid. After choosing the requests, the members depart from the Temple while you and the altar brother/sister prepare the Temple for the ritual you have chosen to fit the first request. During this preparation, the members should prepare themselves for the ritual if a ceremonial form has been chosen. Should a hermetic form be chosen, this is done in the Temple while the members feast and drink outside of the Temple. c) At full moon, an outdoor ritual should be conducted in a suitable location. This should be either a group invocation to the Dark Gods (see Chapter XVI) or another ceremonial ritual (for example, the Death Rite might be chosen because of a member's request). You can elect to hold the sunedrion some days before this, or"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 combine the sunedrion with this ritual, depending on the number of members, and their commitment. What is important is to establish a pattern of meetings and rituals. Teaching: Another purpose of the Temple should be teaching. You should try and arrange regular sessions with interested members -the best time being after the sunedrion and its associated ritual (if any), the best length for the sessions being around three quarters of one hour. During these sessions you can explain about the septenary system, the Star Game, the Satanic Tarot and so on. (All these and other topics of esoteric Satanism are covered in NAOS.) Thus, you might organize the following programme to be held on successive sessions: i) Introduction to the septenary system - Tree of Wyrd, spheres, correspondences. ii) Further correspondences, including Tarot images associated with spheres. iii) Pathways and their 'demon-forms'. Invokation etc. iv) Hermetic rituals v) Introduction to the Star Game vi) The Satanist Tarot - divination etc. vii) Esoteric Chant - practice etc. viii) Practice of playing the Star Game. Should you wish to follow the seven-fold sinister way yourself, you may set yourself a suitable physical task, achieve this, then undertake the Grade Ritual of External Adept. After this, you might begin to teach internal magick to others - getting them to work with the pathways and spheres etc. and setting them goals. Gaining Members: There are many ways of gaining members. For instance, you might infiltrate already existing groups (of either Left or Right Hand Paths) and seek out those interested in working sinister magick. You might also try and interest friends or the friends of your companion - using the bait of an 'orgy'. Whatever method you use, try and make your first ritual dramatic and impressive - you may decide to use an established ritual like Black Mass, or you might try the ritual suggested below (First Ritual for a Choregos). The 'First Ritual' is intended mainly to impress those who may be new to magick. You should try and create before hand the right magickal atmosphere, making your Temple as impressive as possible. Try and be creative - for example, a 'plasma ball' in a candle lit Temple is more impressive than a boring collection of old bones and a skull. Also, do not use symbols and/or Occult designs which you"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 yourself do not know the meaning of. Keep to the symbolism of traditional Satanism - that is, the septenary, avoiding using the tired, old (and inauthentic) symbolism of the 'qabala'. Do no not use any symbolism from old and dead Aeons - for example Egyptian, Sumerian - as the more pure your magick is, the more effective it will be. By pure here is meant following a genuine esoteric tradition like the septenary. In the beginnings it is often helpful if you feel part of a living, exclusive tradition such as the one represented in this 'Black Book' and 'Naos'. This adds power and charisma to both you and your magickal workings. First Ritual: It is important, before the ritual, for you to prepare those who will be attending. They should be told that during the ritual they are to remain silent and not move. They should be told no details of the ritual: only that it is a Satanic invokation, and they should not have seen the Temple before. To increase their expectation, you can arrange to meet them some distance from the Temple itself. They are then blindfolded and taken to the Temple, the ritual being begun immediately. (This also applies to new members of an established Temple.) Both you and your companion (Priestess/Priest) and any others involved should have practiced your roles beforehand - being familiar with the words, gestures and so on. Aim: The aim of the ritual is to draw down magickal energy by basically hermetic means with a view to impressing the 'novices' who are present. Setting: Usually an indoor Temple. Black candles providing the only light. Incense well (hazel) for hours before the ritual. Music from a suitably hidden system should be played during the ritual: choose something 'demonic' which starts slowly and gradually builds to a climax. Participants: Choregos and companion (Priestess and Priest) The Rite: The congregation are led into the Temple. The Priestess (or Choregos if female) should wear sexually revealing Clothing. The music is started by the Choregos who walks past the congregation staring at them and saying 'Agios o Satanas'. The Choregos and/or Priest then vibrates the 'Agios o Satanas' three times after which the Priestess kisses each member of the congregation, rubbing her hands over the genitals of the men as she does so. Following this, the Choregos/priest declares the 'Invokation to Baphomet' while the Priestess visualizes sinister magickal energy being drawn down and entering the congregation. She then begins a slow, sensual dance to the music while the Choregos/Priest chants the Dies Irae followed by the Invokation to"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 Baphomet. He continues to chant the 'Agios o Satanas’ while the music builds to a climax. While chanting this he passes behind the congregation, making passes in the air as he does so. The Priestess during the dance should continue with the visualization. While still behind the congregation the Choregos/Priest says aloud: 'You are all His, now! We have words to bind your soul to us!' The Priestess ceases her dance, chants 'Agios o Satanas' and then extinguishes the candles. She then visualizes a sinister/ demonic form entering the Temple near the altar (this form may be one of the 'demons' on the septenary paths - e.g. Shugara). During this, the Choregos/Priest should chant the name of the chosen entity (e.g. 'Agios o Shugara' Agios o Shugara!'). Do not expect at this stage a visual manifestation to occur - although this might happen if the energies are pronounced and/or one of the congregation is psychically gifted. The aim is to affect the sub-conscious of the congregation. After this, there should be silence for some minutes (the music having ended). The Priestess then says 'It is over' and the Choregos/Priest leads the congregation from the Temple. Note: One of the best means is for the Choregos/Priest to use a tabor or small hand-drum to accompany the ritual and the dance, instead of recorded music. Temple Grades: Temple members can be appointed to the following positions: Guardian of the Temple, Altar Brother (or Sister), Thurifer, Keeper of the Books. The Thurifer is responsible for keeping the Temple incensed during and before a ritual: this may be by either using a thurifer, or a static incense burner. The altar brother/sister is responsible for ensuring the Temple is ready for a ritual: the candles lit, incense ready and so on. The Keeper of the Books is responsible for ensuring the safety of the Black Book and other Temple books and manuscripts, as well as ensuring the Book and/or altar cards are in place in readiness for a ritual. In addition the Choregos can appoint any member to be a Priest or Priestess for either a specific ritual or for a year and a day. A Priest, when officiating in Temple rituals wears a medallion inscribed with either an inverted pentagram or inverted septagon; a Priestess wears an amber necklace and may also opt to wear a silver ankle chain. The sign of a Choregos is, for men, a plain black ring worn on the left hand. Temple members may wear, for men, a ring set with quartz and worn on the left hand, and, for women, a quartz Necklace."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 XVI Invokation to the Dark Gods To open a Star Gate and return the Dark Gods to our causal universe a crystal tetrahedron made of quartz is required. This should be as large as possible - and made from a natural shape by a skilled operator. The rite of returning exists in two versions: the first is suitable for two or more individuals and involves basic magick; the second requires detailed preparation and Cantors trained to a high standard in esoteric chant. The second version is more powerful, but regular invocation using the first method has the same effect. I. The participants for the first version are Priestess and Priest, together with any number of other Initiates provided male and female are present in equal numbers. The invokation can, however, take place without these Initiates - that is, with only the Priestess and Priest present. The rite begins on the night of the new moon with Saturn rising if only the Priest and Priestess are present, otherwise it is undertaken on the night of the full moon. The rite should if possible be conducted on an isolated hill-top and the Priest and Priestess should both be naked. The congregation should wear black robes. Candles in lanterns should be placed to mark out a large circle on the ground. The invokation begins with the Priest vibrating seven times the phrase 'Nythra kthunae Atazoth' while the Priestess holds the tetrahedron in her hands, palms upward. When the vibration is complete the Priest places his hands on the tetrahedron and both vibrate 'Binan ath ga wath am' until the ritual is complete. After the vibration, the Priestess - still holding the crystal - should lie on the ground, her head North, the Priest arousing her with his tongue, The sexual union then begins, with both visualizing the Star Gate opening and the primal form of Atazoth coming forth. Atazoth may be visualized as a dark nebulous chaos - a rent in the fabric of star-studded space which changes into a Dagon like/dragon entity. After her sexual climax, the Priestess buries the crystal within the earth of the hill. When this is done, she vibrates over the spot 'Aperiatur terra, et germinet CHAOS!' She then signals to the congregation who cease their chanting. All the participants then depart from the hill."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 Note: The tetrahedron should be well-buried in a spot prepared by the Priest and Priestess before the rite. If the invokation is done again, the rite begins with the Priestess unearthing the tetrahedron. It should be cleaned before the ritual begins - and must be buried without any covering whatever. II. The second version involves at least eight people including Cantor (s) and Priest and Priestess. Male and female should be present in equal numbers. The rite takes place on or around the autumnal equinox or winter solstice. The best place is an isolated hilltop. According to tradition, the best time to invoke is when (autumn equinox) Venus sets after the sun and the moon itself is very near the star Dabih; or when (winter solstice) Jupiter and Saturn are near the moon which is becoming new, the time before dawn. The first is associated with the 'Star Gate' Dabih, the second with Algol. The most effective place magickally is a hill top of pre-Cambrian rock which lies between a line of volcanic intrusion and one of another rock. The top of the hill should have a line of pre-Cambrian grit passing through it - this description allowing the hallowed places, in this country, to be found. The crystal should be placed on a sheet of mica upon a pediment of oak. The rite begins with the Cantors vibrating in E minor 'Nythra kthunae Atazoth' while at least six of the congregation dance moonrise around the crystal, Cantors, Priestess and Priest. This dance is slow and gradually increases in speed, the participants chanting 'Binan ath ga wath am' as they dance. The Cantors vibrate their phrase seven times at the end of which the Priestess places her hands on the tetrahedron. The Cantors (if there is only one, the Priest acts as a cantor) then sing according to Esoteric Chant - that is, in fourths - the Diabolus. The Priestess visualizes the Star Gate opening. After the Diabolus, the Priestess and Priest vibrate 'Binan ath ga wath am' a fifth apart (or a fifth and an octave) while the Cantors vibrate the same phrase also a fifth apart. (If only one Cantor is present he vibrates Atazoth in E minor.) After this vibration and on a signal from the Priestess, the congregation begin an orgiastic rite, during which the Priestess continues with the visualization and the Cantors with the 'Binan ...' chant a fifth apart. The Priest may visualize the orgiastic energy of the congregation into a magickal force which forces open the Star Gate, allowing the Dark Gods to return to Earth. The Priest and Priestess may then visualize the Chaotic energies as being dispersed over the Earth. However, if the ritual is undertaken correctly, the Dark Gods may"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 become manifest. Should this occur, all the participants should exult. Note: This second version may be combined with the Ceremony of Recalling - and the Sacrificial Conclusion undertaken according to tradition. The invocation to the Dark Gods begins after the sacrifice with the Cantor vibrating 'Nythra ...' as above while the Mistress anoints the participants with the Red Elixir. For this combined ritual, the Mistress in the 'Ceremony' assumes the role of 'Priestess' in the invocation: the Master that of the Priest. This combined ritual is rightly forbidden, for it is the most sinister ritual that exists, its performance actually calling back to Earth in physical form the Dark Gods themselves.

Satan in particular and the Dark Gods in general are a means to self-fulfillment and self-understanding. 2. Only by journeying through the darkness within us and without can we attain self-divinity and thus fulfil the potentiality of our existence. 3. Our rites, ceremonies and practices are all life-affirming, and show us the ecstasy of existence and the self-overcoming of the true Adept. 4. We are feared because we defy and seek to know and thus understand. We rejoice in living: in all its pleasures but most particularly in its possibilities. We thus extend the frontiers of evolution while others sleep or cry. 5. We detest all that enervates and would rather die than submit to anyone or anything - this pride is the pride of Satan, and Satan is a symbol of our defiance and a sign of our life-enhancing energy. Others see our way of living and our way of dying and are afraid."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 6. When we hate we hate openly and with arrogance, and when we love, we love with a passion to match this arrogance: always mindful never to love anyone so much that we cannot see them die, for death is a natural changing of energies. 7. We prepare - through our magick and our ways of living - for the Age of Fire (the Aeon of the Dark Gods) which is to come, when we elitist few shall reach out toward the stars and the galaxies and the new challenges they will bring. 8. Our way is difficult and dangerous and is for the few who can truly defy the matrix of illusions - of 'good' and 'evil' - that stifle the potentiality of our being. 9. What does not kill us, makes us stronger. III Initiate Names a) Some suggestions, based on names traditionally used in sinister Temples: Male: Oger, Hacon, Serell, Noctulius, Athor, Engar, Aulwynd, Algar, Suevis, Angar, Wulsin, Gord, Ranulf Female: Sirida, Eulalia, Lianna, Aesoth, Richenda, Edonia, Annia, Liben, Estrild, Selann b) Contract and/or transpose your own name to form another; for example, 'Conrad Robury' gives Cabur, Nocra and so on. c) Find a demon form with whom you feel an affinity, and use that name, either as it is or contracted/transposed. d) Construct your name from a Satanic phrase or chant - for example, 'Quinvex' can be derived from the 'Quando Vindex' of the Diabolus. What is important about all the above is that you feel 'attracted' to a particular name or phrase. Whatever method is used, the name or phrase should derive from traditional Satanism (as explicated in this book) and for this reason names/demons deriving from other traditions should not be used."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 ~~~~~~~ "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 1 Introduction: The following pages comprise scanned images of a photocopy of a typewritten manuscript previously owned by a member of the Temple of the Sun.

I: THE SINISTER CALLING Introduction: The aim of the following ceremonial ritual can be either (a) returning to Earth those 'negative, chaotic, sinister' forms/energies dark legend knows as 'The Dark Gods';(b) drawing forth from acausal dimensions chaotic energies, directed towards a specific goal/aim/intent or channeled into a particular individual(s)/group/temporal form. The main difference between the two is that in (a) the forms/energies are left to disperse/create conditions according to their nature. If insufficient preparation/desire is present within those performing this Calling, (b) can become (a) - sometimes to the detriment of those Calling. The rite of the Sinister Calling is a traditional ritual -perhaps the most sinister ritual that exists. The rite assumes willing Sacrifice. Setting: An isolated hill top, sunset, with Saturn rising - or a sinister Temple/cave. Participants: Master of the Temple - purple robes Mistress of Earth - purple robes Priestess - naked, upon altar Priest - black robe, tied with white cord/girdle Congregation - black robes Guardian of the Temple - black robes with face mask Preparations: 1) Seven days before the rite, the congregation assemble in the dwelling of the Master or Mistress. Here they stay until the rite is complete. During the seven days they are forbidden to speak, wear only ceremonial robes, will abstain from intoxicating drinks and sexual pleasures and eat no meat (this is a 'Black Fast'). During the hours of darkness no lights except black candles are to be lit and at sunset on each day they gather in the Temple to chant the Diabolus nine times. During the seven days no contact with outsiders is allowed, and no music or intrusive sound, save for the Diabolus and the Atazoth chant is to be heard. Both the dwelling and the Temple are to be incensed with Saturnian incense. According to tradition, the robes worn will contain a hood/cowl which is to be worn during the hours of daylight, these hours being taken up with walking within the dwelling grounds (or a suitable, isolated location nearby) for at least three hours together with such diversions as the Master or Mistress will arrange. (Note: These diversions - which in recent times include playing the Star Game - are so chosen so as not to destroy the black tranquility of the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 3 fast.) In the past they have included study of alchemical MSS, silent Tarot readings (using sign language/drawn symbols for the reader to express meanings) and practice in performing esoteric chant (Diabolus/Atazoth chant - fourth/fifths and so on), this latter in the Temple if the Calling is to be performed there. 2) The Temple is prepared seven days before the rite (this applies to the site chosen - which should thereafter be guarded by appropriate energy). This consists of the Master and Mistress incensing the area with Saturnian incense while chanting seven times the 'Sanctus Satanas'. They then unite in sexual union, the Mistress visualizing the nexion to the Dark Gods as being gradually opened, though remaining partly closed. One planetary hour before the Calling begins on the seventh day, the Temple/outdoor area is made ready by an Initiate chosen for this task. A black cloth is laid on the altar and seven black candles placed upon it and lit. A large quartz crystal is placed in the centre of the Temple, on an oak (or wooden) stand. (Note: It enhances the energies if this crystal is shaped as a tetrahedron. Whatever the shape the crystal should be as large as possible.) The Master brings the Sacrificial knife. An image of Baphomet according to sinister tradition (for example, Atu III of the Sinister Tarot) may be present in the Temple but no other artifacts, furnishings, signs or symbols. The congregation et al gather outside the Temple, robed as described, and are led into the Temple by the (naked) Priestess at the beginning of the Rite. 3) As the Congregation assemble on the seventh day before the Rite (they will have been informed some time before by the Master or Mistress of the date of the Calling, its purpose and intent being explained) lots are drawn to decide which man among them will be chosen. The one chosen by the drawing of lots is free to then accept or decline the honour. If this honour is declined, another lot is held, and the one so chosen may also decline. After this a further lot is held, the result of which is binding. The Opfer so chosen by lot is then led by the Guardian(s) to a secure, secluded place and resides there until the Calling begins. Each night and in this place, the Opfer receives the Priestess for the length of one planetary hour, the Priestess being chosen from among the Temple to be at this period capable of conception. If the Master or Mistress so desire, another lady in addition to the Priestess may be chosen and received by the Opfer during the days before the Rite, and lead him to the Temple for the Calling. The Rite: The congregation precess into the Temple, led by the Priestess who is assisted onto the altar by the Mistress.

The Master lays the S.Knife on the womb of the Priestess while the Mistress places her hands on the crystal and joins the Master in chanting the Diabolus in fourths while visualizing the nexion opening. This chant is repeated seven times while the congregation continue their dance and chant. After the seventh chant, the Master claps his hands nine times as a signal for the congregation to gather round. The Guardian brings the Opfer forward. The Master gives the Opfer a chalice of wine, which he drinks. After this, the Master says to him: 'We greet our honoured guest with a kiss'. He kisses the Opfer, followed by the Mistress and the congregation who kiss the Opfer in turn. The Mistress then removes the robe of the Opfer and begins to raise his secret fire with her lips, while the Master gestures to the congregation as a sign for them to remove their robes. They then begin to dance again - chanting 'Atazoth', Satanas and/or shouting/laughing/screaming as they whirl faster in ecstasy and frenzy. As they dance, the Guardian lifts the Priest upon the altar while the Master takes up the S.Knife. The Priestess holds the Opfer in sexual union and visualizes the nexion opening as she draws by movement the secret fire from the Opfer. She then releases him and on this sign the Mistress signals to the congregation who begin an orgiastic rite according to their desires. The Mistress then touches the crystal with her hands visualizing/intoning the aim/intent of the Calling, ad libitum according to the frenzy/energy generated in the Temple. As she touches the crystal, the Guardian(s) assist the Opfer from the altar and with the Master (who takes the S.Knife and the empty chalice used by the Opfer) leave the Temple and go to a secluded place (which may be the place used by the Opfer during the preparation period). In this secluded place, the Master vibrates 'Nythra kthunae Atazoth' while the Guardian(s) hold the Opfer. After the vibration, the Master uses the S.Knife, collecting some of the elixir in the chalice. He then returns to the Temple and the Mistress symbolically washes her hands in the red elixir before herself chanting 'Nythra kthunae Atazoth!' Following this, she and the Master chant in fourths the Diabolus, directing the chant towards the crystal. The Rite is concluded by the Master assisting the Priestess down from the altar. She departs from the Temple, returning with trays of food and wine which she offers to the congregation - then revelry continues until desires are fulfilled. The Priestess herself withdraws after offering the food and drink, as the Master and Mistress do.

Participants: Amatrix - in white robes Priestess - in violet robes flecked with purple Defensatrix - in black, with face mask Congregation - black robes Temple preparations: The altar is covered with a black cloth on which is woven an inverted seven-pointed star and on this is a large quartz crystal (which may be shaped as a tetrahedron). A large statue or image (Atus III, IV or XX) of Baphomet according to Sinister tradition is to the left of the altar. Chalices of wine, temple bell, violet candles and incense of Jupiter (both aspects: i.e. Beech and civil). The Priestess and Amatrix stand before the altar, the Defensatrix by the entrance. The Priestess rings the Temple bell seven times to signify the beginning of the rite at which the congregation precess in to the altar and are greeted by the Amatrix with a kiss. They then form a semi-circle before the altar. The Ceremony: The Priestess raises her hands, saying: Wash your throats with wine For Sirius returns And we women are warm and wanton! (The Amatrix hands her a chalice, which she drinks from, then passes to the congregation. After all have drunk, the Priestess holds the empty chalice upside down, and says:) Before I WAS, you were sightless: You looked, but could not see; Before I WAS, you had no hearing: You heard sounds, but could not listen. Before I WAS, you swarmed with men, But did not enjoy. I CAME, opened my body and Brought you lust! (She opens her robe to reveal her breasts.

We curse him! Priestess: So we gather again to give praise to her Who rules our world. Agios o Baphomet! Agios o Baphomet! (The congregation repeat the chant seven times while the Amatrix takes up the crystal which she holds in her outstretched hands. The Priestess places her own hands over the crystal. They and the congregation then chant \"Veni, omnipotens aeterne Baphomet!\" 21 times, the Defensatrix ringing the Temple bell after each chant until the number is reached. The Amatrix then takes the crystal round the congregation who lay their hands upon it in turn, each silently saying 'Veni, omnipotens aeterne Baphomet' while the Priestess vibrates/chants aloud \"Agios o Baphomet\". The crystal is then returned to the altar by the Amatrix while the Priestess lays on the floor, her Head touching the feet of the Baphomet image. The Amatrix stimulates her to orgasm using her tongue while the congregation dance around them chanting 'Agios o Baphomet'. The Priestess channels the energy into the crystal and thence out from the Temple to achieve the desired goal. If no external goal is desired, it is stored in the crystal. Following the climax by the Priestess, the congregation cease their dance and one by one kneel down to kiss the Priestess and then the Amatrix. As each one does this, the Defensatrix whispers to them: \"So it is done again according to our ways, bringing strength and joy.\" After the kissing, each rises, bows to the Priestess, and departs from the Temple. After all the congregation have departed, the Amatrix leaves, followed by the Defensatrix. A feast follows, outside the Temple. The Priestess remains in the Temple until she adjudges the times aright to leave. However, if she so wishes, any member of the Temple who so desires and who has informed her beforehand, may join her in the Temple, whatever energy being produced being directed toward the goal, or stored in the crystal. In both instances, the Priestess is the last to leave - bowing to the image, extinguishing the candles and chanting 'Ponne, diabolus, custodian!' as she leaves.)

'Sacrifice'). (Daughters of Baphomet) * * * * * * * * * IV: THE RITE OF THE NINE ANGLES The rite may be undertaken on either the autumnal equinox (for the Dabih gate) or the winter solstice (for Algol). The Naos rite is suitable for southern climes and will not be given here although in form it is the same as the version given. Ideally, the rite should be undertaken either: a) on a hill-top of pre-Cambrian rock which lies between a line of volcanic intrusion and another rock - in Britain, this other rock is 'Buxton' b) in an underground cavern where water flows [this applies only to the 'chthonic' form] c) in a glade consecrated beforehand within a circle of nine stones (the first stone being set on a night of the new moon with Saturn rising, the second at the full moon and so on: the first stone marking the point on the horizon where Saturn rises). [Note: this applies only to the 'natural' form of the rite.] Further, the time is right when, for Dabih, Venus sets after the sun, and the moon itself occults Dabih or is near to it; and, for Algol, when Jupiter and Saturn are both near the moon which is becoming new, the time before dawn. These conditions mean that the energies are available to enhance the working. The rite exists in three versions - the natural form, the chthonic, and the solo. The chthonic form may be combined with the Ceremony of Recalling and the Sacrificial Conclusion undertaken according to Tradition. It must be noted however that this combination is exceedingly dangerous - if done correctly with a) above and with the conditions for Algol as above, it brings back to Earth the Dark Gods themselves by opening the Star Gate between the causal and acausal. However, the chthonic form may be successful in bringing to presence the Dark Gods without the Sacrificial aspect if the chants are done correctly, the crystal is sufficient in size, and the cosmic tides are aligned aright [note: this usually occurs when an Aeon is (magickally) ending, the energies being more pronounced in the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 10 last three decades. At other times the rite can be used to bring about such changes] The natural form involves a Priest and Priestess [ideally these should have undertaken the ritual of Internal Adept - or at the very least External Adept] and is basically a drawing to the Earth of acausal energies - these are left to disperse naturally: i.e. without any magickal intent. The chthonic form involves a Priest and a Priestess as well as at least one cantor trained in sinister Esoteric Chant together with a congregation of male and female. This form is either an invokation to the Dark Gods - the energies being dispersed naturally - or a channelling of those energies into a specific event or events or individual. This channelling however requires the skill of at least a Master of Temple/Mistress of Earth. The solo form involves one individual and the aim is usually the alteration of the consciousness of that individual: this however is very dangerous. Note: all the above forms require a crystal tetrahedron made of quartz. I: Natural Form If possible, the conditions above should be met - if not, conduct the rite on an isolated hill-top at sunset. Both Priest and Priestess should be naked. The rite begins with the Priest vibrating seven times \"Nythra kthunae Atazoth\" while the Priestess holds the crystal in her hands, palms upward. The vibration should consist of three projected vibrations followed by four resonant ones - all aimed at the crystal which should be at a distance of not less than two feet and not more than three. After the vibrations, the Priest places his hands on the crystal and both vibrate \"Binan ath ga wath am\" as a projected vibration. The Priestess, still holding the crystal, then lies with her head North while the Priest arouses her with his tongue, locis muliebribus. The sexual union begins after, and both visualize the Star Gate opening and energy flowing through it down to them. If desired (ie. sinister intent) this energy may be symbolized by Atazoth - a dark nebulous chaos issuing forth from a star strewn Space which changes into a 'Dagon' like entity before becoming chaos again. This visualization continues until the sexual climax of the Priestess after which the Priest reaches his own climax. The Priestess then rises and buries the crystal in the earth of the hill [as deep as possible - this may be prepared beforehand - and leaving few traces]. When complete, she vibrates over the place"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 11 \"Aperiatur terra, et germinet Chaos\". They then depart from the hill. Note: further rituals may take place over the burial, but they must have the same intent and follow the form as above except the vibrations are aimed toward the buried crystal - no further crystal being required. II: Chthonic Form If the special conditions cannot be met [(a) and Algol are most effective; (b) and Dabih are generally for channelling into specific events/individuals] then a hill-top containing volcanic quartz is suitable. The crystal should be placed on an oak stand with a sheet of mica between it and the wood [this enhances still further the effect of the crystal and is a recent modification). The Priest, Priestess and Cantors stand near the crystal, while the congregation (of at least six - three male and three female) form a circle around them. The congregation dance moonwise and according to their desire chant \"Atazoth\" as they do while the Cantor(s) vibrate in E minor \"Nythra kthunae Atazoth\". After this vibration the cantor and Priest (or two Cantors if there are two) vibrate in fourths the \"Diabolus\" chant [see set texts] while the Priestess places her hands on the crystal, visualizing the Star Gate opening (as in I). After the Diabolus, the Priest signals to the congregation who begin an orgiastic rite according to their desires. The Priest and Priestess then vibrate \"Binan ath ga wath am\" a fifth apart (or an octave and a fifth) while the Cantor(s) vibrate \"Atazoth\". If two Cantors are present, this Atazoth vibration begins in parallel: the next \"Atazoth\" is a fifth apart as is the third. After this, they then chant, in fifths, the 'Atazoth chant' according to tradition [see set texts). While the Cantors are chanting the Priest and Priestess continue their visualization. If only one Cantor is present, the \"Atazoth\" vibration is continued nine times and then the 'Atazoth chant' undertaken by the Cantor and the Priest, in fifths. The Dark Gods will then be manifest. [If for some reason (eg. inexperience of the participants) the manifestations do not occur, the Priestess should chant in C major \"Nythra kthunae Atazoth\" after which the Priest also places his hands on the crystal and he and the Priestess vibrate \"Binan ath ga wath am\", the Cantor(s) chanting the Diabolus as before after which the Priest visualizes the energies arising from the orgiastic"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 12 rite as cohering and then entering the crystal to be then drawn forth into both himself and the Priestess before being sent forth to render asunder the Star Gate] Notes of this form: * the rite may be enhanced by the use of tabors/drums during the dance and the orgiastic rite, individuals being appointed for this task. * The maximum number of participants should not exceed twenty-one in total. * Provided rigorous training is undertaken beforehand, the dance and the orgiastic rite can be replaced with the congregation chanting from the start of the rite the \"Diabolus\" in fifths they continue with this until the Priest signals them to stop (after the Cantors Diabolus chant) after which they chant the 'Atazoth chant' in fifths repeatedly until the end of the rite. If this form is done, it is important for the congregation to visualize the Star Gate opening while they chant - and this visualization should be agreed beforehand and be the same as that of the Priestess and Priest. This form of the chthonic rite is however only effective if the congregation has been trained to chant in the correct manner. A suitable cavern/resonant building/Temple may be used in this instance. [Further note: providing the chanting is accurate, the crystal large enough, this form is among the most effective.] III: Solo Form This form should be undertaken on either a hill-top or in a Temple/resonant building. It begins at sunset on a night of the new moon with Saturn rising. The individual should face Saturn and vibrate \"Nythra Kthunae Atazoth\" seven times while holding the crystal. Then \"Binan ath ga wath am\" is vibrated followed by the Diabolus chant after which the visualization is begun (as above) [Note: this form involves the 'Saturnian' gate and thus the Gate may be visualized near the planet Saturn]. The energy is then visualized as flowing down into the individual, this visualization lasting for at least one quarter of an hour. After, the individual chants the 'Atazoth chant', places the crystal on the ground and sits near it, to visualize its interior becoming black and this blackness spreading out to engulf the individual. Note: This ritual should not be undertaken lightly. There must be a preparedness to exult in the energies. After the rite (the individual will know when it is complete) the crystal should be wrapped in black cloth and stored until required again. Before attempting this form, individuals are advised to seek the guidance of a Master of Temple/Mistress of Earth. * * * * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 13 V: THE CEREMONY OF RECALLING With Sacrificial Conclusion.

Sacrificial conclusion: The candidate (who is always male and who ideally should be in his twenty first year on the Summer Solstice chosen for the ritual) is chosen by the Mistress from among the Temple members on the Summer Solstice one year before the ritual will occur. If the chosen one accepts this honour then he becomes an honorary Priest for the year and is allowed to choose from the members of the Temple a woman to be his Priestess. In a simple ceremony the Mistress seals them in union, dedicating them to the Dark Gods. If by the Winter Solstice the Priestess is not with child, then the Priest may choose another woman to be his Priestess. The child, when born is adopted by the Temple and raised accordingly, being given great honour and, if found suitable, trained to fulfil the role of Mistress or Master. At the Spring Equinox, the chosen is permitted to give his favour to any one female member of the Temple and should issue result from this, the child is adopted by either the Priestess of the chosen or by the Temple according to the wishes of the Mistress. After the Spring Equinox, the chosen lives with his Priestess, retiring from all mortal affairs save his duties as Priest to the Temple. He shall also arrange his temporal affairs in readiness for the day of the ritual. Should the chosen at any time fail to observe his vow by fleeing and hiding from members of the Temple, he shall by all the Temples of the Order and all kindred temples and Orders be placed under a death curse, and the Guardian of his Temple sent to seek him out and terminate without warning his existence. The Guardian shall not rest until this task is complete, and the Mistress may appoint other Guardians as well to assist in this should she so desire. After the congress between Priest and Priestess, the Guardian places a hood over the head of the Priest, fastens his ankles, binds his wrists while the Master, on a signal from the Mistress completes the sacrifice using the sacred knife, collecting some of the Red Elixir in a chalice. This Elixir is used by the Mistress in the baking of the sacrificial cakes which all the members present will eat during assembly on the night of the next new moon. The cakes consist of wheat, fish, fowl, spring water, egg and salt together with the Red Elixir, animal fat and honey."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 17 After the sacrifice, the guardian removes the body and the Mistress takes up the sacred knife, pointing it at the Master saying: So you have sown and from your seeding Gifts may come if you obedient heed The words I speak. She then takes the Chalice with the Red Elixir, dips the tip of the sacred knife into it and anoints each member present who have formed a circle around her. The ritual continues as before with the Mistress saying: I know you my children ... The Guardian takes the body and buries it in a secluded spot prepared beforehand. It is on this place of burial that the Temple gathers on the night of the new moon to eat the sacrificial cakes. In former times it was sometimes the practice to sever the head of the chosen one and place it in the Temple or the Temple area if outdoors for a day and a night. During this night, initiations would be conducted and the head shown to new Initiates. Notes: Rituals outdoors should be conducted within an (isolated) stone circle during twilight. If the 'Sacrificial Conclusion' is undertaken the ritual occurs on the Summer Solstice once every cycle of seventeen years (or nineteen in some traditions). The one chosen, according to ancient tradition, reaped many benefits in the realm of the acausal (or the lands of the Dark Immortals as it was sometimes called) where that eternal aspect of the individual which initiation into the darker mysteries created was transported after the mortal death to begin on another plane of existence. This belief made willing sacrifice possible. * * * * * * * * * APPENDIX ------- I: THE NINE ANGLES - Esoteric Meanings The name nine angles is, in one fundamental sense, self-descriptive ́: the Tree of Wyrd possesses nine causal angles and nine acausal angles in the causal geometric sense, and these can be represented as formed by the corners or angles of a causal and acausal tetrahedron, one a reflexion of the other, the base lying in the plane of the middle sphere (the sun). This double tetrahedron encloses in three dimensional space the path from the causal to the acausal - the 'initiate journey' from the sphere of the Moon to Saturn via the other spheres, this path being helical (cf. 'The Wheel of Life' in NAOS). The direction of this path is 'counter-clockwise'. In essence, the acausal is a reflexion (and vice versa) of the causal, so the single term 'Nine Angles' describes what is our normal (ie. un-initiated) view of the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 18 Septenary, this Septenary being a 'map' of consciousness and the cosmos. The realization of the dual nature of the spheres (for example Mercury is the 'shadow' of Mars) arises from Initiation and is the first stage of an esoteric understanding of the term 'nine angles'. The term also describes the nine fundamental 'alchemical' forms (represented by the symbols , or , , and so on: i.e. the pieces of the Star Game). These forms are the basic apprehensions of magickal energy and thus re-present the acausal manifest in the causal (in the many forms of that manifestation - eg. individual consciousness: the images/archetypes pertaining thereto). Hence each of these symbols is an 'angle' re: the above description of the septenary Tree. These nine fundamental forms (the abstract symbolism is a stage of understanding beyond the purely causal geometric one) exist in many combinations within the nexion which the Tree of Wyrd represents - and these combinations are abstractly symbolized by the placement of the many pieces of the Star Game over the seven boards ('spheres') of that game. (Note: the advanced form of the Star Game is the most complete representation, but for convenience the septenary form will be used here. It should be noted, however, that the septenary form - difficult though it is for initiates - serves only as an introduction to the advanced game.) This abstraction, in terms of the Star Game, makes the forms understandable on a level higher than that of using words and ideas - this understanding is a new form of thinking, a form appropriate to the next century and beyond. Such an understanding arises from playing the Star Game and relating the abstract symbols to conventional representations (eg. archetypal forms; the energies of the pathways; the symbolism of the Tarot and the many and various occult symbolisms) - this develops the capacity for what may be termed 'acausal thinking': when the conventional representations are abandoned and collocations are viewed abstractly. This 'abstraction' is however a new 'insight' (a lower form of which is often described as 'intuition') and not a dry, academic process: it extends consciousness into new and important realms and pre-figures the development of a symbolic language which eliminates the confusion, both moral and linguistic which exists in words and the translation of complex ideas into such words. It is 'mathesis' in the ancient Greek sense and while not being what we understand as 'mathematics' it complements mathematical abstraction and indeed interacts with it in some places. For example, the causal within the acausal can be represented by the tensor where is the causal component and the acausal one. For an system (Euclidean space) has nine non-zero components. These are the symmetric components of : the skew-symmetrical being acausal. In this sense, the nine form 'sub-spaces' of the causal and the tensor 'describes' the nexion causal/acausal. It is possible to write an equation involving the tensor which describes the multi-dimensional space, the boundary conditions of which give, for example, the metrics of each form of 'spacetime' (causal and acausal)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 19 Essentially, the symbolism is a new tool to assist and develop our understanding, and it is via this symbolism that the meanings of the nine angles may most easily be understood without confusion. On a less refined esoteric level (ie. in more 'conventional' esoteric terms) the nine angles symbolize the sigil formed by connecting the spheres of the Tree of Wyrd with the two most important 'Gates' (see illustration). This sigil describes the energy flow and may be used, magickally in several ways - for example as a visualization 'sigil' (in hermetic rituals etc.) as a symbol of the path walked during certain rites (some connected with esoteric chant - qv. NAOS) and when an 'Earth Gate' is being sought with a view to drawing acausal energy through it to change the causal (eg. inaugurate a new aeon). The nine also represents the tetrahedron (for example, the crystal one used in the Rite of the Nine Angles) which is itself symbolic of the nexion described by the Tree of Wyrd. Thus, for instance, in the Nine Angles Rite, the crystal represents one aspect of the nexion, the Priest and Priestess the other: together (i.e. the bringing together in the ritual) they enable the nexion to be opened. In this sense, the Priest and Priestess (when conjoined) form a tetrahedron which, joined with the crystal one, enables acausal energy to become manifest in the causal (the 'world') - this is the secret hinted at in many historical alchemical MSS (for example the 'Rosarium Philosophorum': \"Make a round circle of the man and woman ...\") and occasionally depicted in drawings. This 'double tetrahedron' is a magickal form of the double described above in the first paragraph (the causal geometric one). In some 'esoteric' circles the nine is seen in terms of the five, the five itself deriving from the five angles of the inverted pentagram. This is, however, a misunderstanding, deriving as it does from viewing the 'angles' two-dimensionally when in fact they should be considered in a three dimensional way, at first, and then four-dimensionally (the helical path within the tetrahedrons). This four-dimensional view is in itself only a beginning - beyond is the multi-dimensional when both the causal and the acausal spaces are considered. One means to apprehend this duality is the Star Game (qv. NAOS).

The 'symbol of the nine' shown below the inverted pentagram is only one form of the many possible by joining the seven spheres of the septenary and the 'gates' - as shown, the invocation begins with the Moon sphere and ends with the Saturn sphere (and thus the Agios Vindex chant). Each symbol of nine represents a particular type of energy - for example, to open an 'Earth' gate, the sequence would end with the Earth Gate (ie. the Jupiter sphere); while to open a Star Gate it would end with that gate - on the diagram. A simpler form of invocation is possible, and involves not the complete chants, but simply the \"word or name\" associated with the particular sphere (according to the septenary tradition). Thus, the Moon sphere would involve the vibration of \"Nox\", the Mercury sphere \"Satan\" and so on (qv. the correspondences in NAOS).

Magick enables us to capture again and again those moments which not only shape our lives but which can extend the possibilities of our existence: those moments when we know with an exhilaration and an insight that transcends words, when we become more than a single isolated individual burdened with a causal existence. For some time there has been a denial of, and attempts to undermine, the ceremonial in magick: there has arisen a plethora of self-written rituals and \"chaos\" type workings. This, however, arises from a misunderstanding of the nature of ceremonial magick. Basically, there are two types of ceremonial workings in magick: dure ceremonial, and sedue ceremonial. The first is essentially ritual used for internal magick – to produce or provoke or inspire changes within the consciousness of those participating/attending. The second is (or rather should be) a performance which transports the individual participants to another realm and which engages their whole being. It is not however a possession – but rather a developed awareness, a new way of being distinct from \"everyday\" existence, one in which all the elements (mind, body, emotions etc.) are a unity. A sedue ceremonial is an artistic event of the highest type because it is a conscious attempt to make the acausal real (to presence it) in causal time. However, like any artistic performance, a ritual can be good, indifferent, bad or great depending on the talent and abilities of those performing/conducting it. If it is any of the first three, it will not achieve its purpose. A great performance is one which captures the essence of the ritual – which brings the acausal, which \"opens a nexion\", and which thus has the magickal power to transform. This of course is a rare event – at least these days – and like, for example, a great performance of a drama or a symphony, requires both talent and preparation. Unfortunately, in the past as in the present, ceremonial rituals when attempted are done mostly by inept"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 2 performers with little or no preparation and little if any empathy with the magick which the ritual re-presents. Thus the ritual is magickally ineffective: non-inspirational for the participants and congregation. Further, elements of self-delusion (regarding the \"magick\") are mostly present. Such \"performances\" tend to confirm the mistaken belief that ceremonial forms are either boring or outmoded or both. A ceremonial ritual should be vivifying – and awaken \"numinous\" feelings. It should stimulate all the senses - for a sedue ritual in a subtle way; for dure ritual in an obvious/overt way. Incenses and fragrances should stimulate the sense of smell; the eyes should be stimulated by colour and imagery; hearing by the sounds of chanting, by music, words; the intellect by the symbols/content/intent; the passions by the spirit or elan of the performance and perhaps the sight/gestures of an individual or individuals performing a specific \"role\", their manner of dress (or undress) and their physical movement. A ceremonial ritual is a seduction – of the participants and congregation by he/she/they conducting it or the power of the rite itself because the rite captures or transforms an aspect or aspects of the acausal. This seduction is subtle if the ritual is a sedue one, and obvious/overt/harsh if it is a dure one. But by its nature it always has a temporal structure, as it always is a nexion to the acausal – if it is a genuine magickal rite, that is, one that possesses when performed acausal (or magickal) energy/power. Both of these aspects – the temporal structure and the nexion – are important, although hitherto esoteric. Each shall be considered in turn. First, temporal structure. This means that the ritual has a beginning, a middle (or 'action'/development) and a definite end: it is confined in temporal time, and while a specific performance may be 'fast' or 'slow' depending on the mood and the intensity, it is generally of a certain duration. Second – a nexion. This means that in form and content (e.g. the techniques used to draw upon magickal energy) it is effective – it accesses the forms/symbols and so on required for its purpose. This means more than that it 'produces emotion'. Emotion arises or should arise from the performance by the effort and talent of the performers. Rather, such accessing means it re-presents certain elements of the acausal in an accessible form, such as archetypes or numinous symbols. This requires what can only be called a type of 'artistic creation' – and this in itself can be of varying quality, as in music or any creative endeavor. Most creations, however, as rituals, are not effective: they do not presence the acausal, although they may produce emotion and"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 3 perhaps the occasional insight. Emotion, however, is not magick – just as \"intellectual stimulation\" and/or undisciplined behaviour are not, although such things result and are expected to result from what passes for \"magickal rituals\" today. Only rarely does a creation become or be magickal – that is, a nexion, despite the intent of the person or persons who undertake such creation. Thus, no amount of desire, no amount of intellectual knowledge can make or create a ritual which is magickally effective. Only rarely does a creation become or is magickal. It may become so due to the \"aura\" or \"tradition\" surrounding it (partly due to past performances) – but even in this instance it must still possess some aspects which access the acausal directly. It is magickal when it is that rare entity: a genuine magickal creation. The temporal structure and accessing of a ritual mean that a genuine rite, once created or transmitted via tradition, must be respected for what it is: effective performance requires fidelity to the temporal limits and its internal structure – in terms of all its formalized elements such as words, chants, symbols, images, colours etc. Outside of this, there can be (and indeed should be) artistic interpretation, a vivifying of the original by the talent and skill of the performer(s). A genuine magickal ritual is a work of art – and requires 'interpretation', that is, performance, to presence the acausal. It is, in short, a conscious causal expression of aspects of the acausal – and in performance lives in both the causal and the acausal. Hence its power to transform. [It should be remembered that only ceremonial magick is being considered here – the above does not imply that only ceremonial forms are effective as magick. There are many other forms or means of accessing the acausal.] Given this understanding, it should be obvious that there are very few rituals, written down or transmitted, which presence the acausal and which, in an inspiring performance or interpretation, are capable of transforming either the consciousness of others or of producing changes in the causal metric itself. That is, there are few rituals which possess in their written form the potential to be a nexion to the acausal: and even these require inspirational performance: rehearsal, planning, the correct intent or desire ... In short, the creation of \"atmosphere\" and skill/ability in performance. The rituals that proliferate today – and most of those regarded as 'traditional' – may in their performance pass some moments of causal time and may even fill some individuals with emotion (and boredom is an emotion), but they are not and never will be magickal."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 4 Of the rituals that do exist, those in 'The Black Book of Satan' together with a few others (such as The Ceremony of Recalling in its various forms) rank as supreme works of magick.

It serves as a pointer towards the future - of Magick, and of Western evolution. The author is well aware that written works such as this are merely shadows of what cannot, at present, be adequately expressed. And yet, via these writings the real motives of Satanists in the world may begin to be discerned. Perhaps then another nameless insight will be presenced, and one more nexion shall start its slow opening. ONA Venn Community, Shropshire 1998eh Eira: A Satanic Guide to Future Magick Introduction: In the Realm of Gods The very essence of Satanism is that we can become gods: that we can be those future beings who will be revered not only by our own species, but by other life-forms elsewhere in the cosmos. By using only our Will, we can be the indomitable ones destined to carve out the path to the next aeon. By great deeds, we can be the makers of history. All that has led to this point in time can be surpassed - all that has made great warrior-ship, heroism, discovery and creativity, can be surpassed, re-defined and re-expressed. All the gods, all the great figures of our history who spawned gods, can be bettered."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 2 We can possess the one real secret guarded by all our past gods: that those gods are but pale imitations of the beings that we ourselves can become. This secret is the grail that sleeps within the soul of our Western Race, and which so many occult forms have failed to wake. All past gods of the various Western Traditions are rendered obsolete by the forces which Satanism alone is unleashing. These are the forces of cosmic evolution, taking the form of the Aeonic Magickian. The cosmos is now seeking to discard the tired old gods of our past, and is hungry for new expressions, to spawn new forms that will begin the next cycle of history. Fading are the old Earth-bound symbols, giving way to those of acausal dimensions; those numinous forms which presence now the Galactic future that awaits. Rising are the chants of the stars, the wordless ceremonies, the living nexions that are worlds apart from the occult, from the old realm of temples, circles and runic readings. The Satanist does not need to study or re-enact the past, and indulge in what has long been established: he is that past, the present, and the future. And each new willed act is another re-expression of the essence, another re-definition of cosmic meaning - another dis-covering of the potency of life presenced in each one of us. Another reminder that individuals do possess the choice to act or not to act for the greater cause of evolution: that each act can matter, can make a difference ... We do not have to simply consume and pay homage to past glorious deeds; to behave as if we believe history itself has now ceased, or has been rendered the future realm of an officially appointed few. Those appointed few are like the old gods of the past: they exist so that we individuals can, through defiance, discover our own potential - the potential that is really one potential: that of the cosmos itself. Thus, Satanists do not follow gods. So what then of Satan, that greatly mis-understood living symbol? Satan is not tied to cultural phases, and does not in image represent a once great society."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 3 Instead, Satan is the timeless flow of the cosmos, seeking existence. Satan is the grail itself, that secret guarded by the inadequate gods of our past. Satan is the very essence of the striving to become a god - Satan is the arrogance within that enables us to leave behind the archaic gods, and to find the courage to be the new gods. Satan is how we live, how we die, and how we shall be after causal life. Satan is the word that when invoked presences the very essence of our striving and defiance. As a living Being, Satan desires new life, new expression, and the constant surpassing of each shadowy archetype created to represent Him. As living Beings, when we are living right, we are Satan - both as individuals and collectively, as the new species of Human that is yet to be. Let us stop grovelling to old archetypes, stop forming fan-clubs for the Old Ones, and discard the superstition and academia that is so precious and so useless. We possess the creative genius to set in motion new Earth-shattering forms, and the arrogance to behave as the embodiment of the future that we, in essence, are. The future implies an upward surge away from the near medieval times we still live in, and in this becoming of evolution, we do not need to seek answers from anywhere but within ourselves. The future gods bear our names ... I: The Forbidden Alchemy One of the long-term aims of the Dark Tradition is to bring to consciousness for the majority the reality of the Force that is Satan. This 'dis-covering' will result in the upward evolutionary surge known as the 'New Aeon'. A magickal Order, such as the ONA, is only one of several forms by which Satan is presenced - and presenced in the most undiluted of ways, without the obstruction of mortal fears. In one sense, all genuine sinister orders are an invokation to Satan: they constitute in themselves a magickal ritual, with each member understanding the conditions required if the long-term goal of the rite is to be attained. This magickal ritual, being founded upon the uncompromising principles of Nature, contains within it spontaneous or unknown factors which defy the imposition of abstract dogma. By this magickal ritual the unique creativity, the uniqueness of Being possesed by each Adept, is allowed to develop of itself."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 4 But Traditional Satanists also understand that uniqueness of Being to be the Will of the Cosmos itself, and thus certain types of individual creativity are Life made manifest during its course of Evolution - this is to say, in esoteric terms, that certain types of creativity presence the acausal. Practically, the creativity/magick that marks Adeptship is nurtured and expressed by individual defiance - the uniqueness of Being which is Satan. Because genuine acts of magick presence the acausal, the relationship of magick with 'the world' can be said to be \"wholistic\": a relationship where the difference and diversity of Nature and 'forms' exist to enable the spirit (or Being) of the Cosmos to thrive and evolve - ultimately there is nothing which exists external to this continous flow of Change; nothing which can be influenced or changed in isolation. A genuine Adept understands this, and begins to embody in their individual life, this most natural of esoteric techniques: the way of empathy. As all genuine sinister magickians are quick to point out, this apprehension currently exists at odds with conventional esotericism. A well-quoted example is the qabalistic approach which involves the magickian - or more accurately 'sorcerer' - in viewing the forces of Nature as separate, often barbarous material to be dominated and manipulated for personal ends. A highly evolved esoteric Order would not be characterised by this 'grimoire' approach, since such an approach lacks a binding purpose, a great and clear vision which would enable members to transcend the personal and become the organic whole of a true magickal Order - an Order which is the life of the Cosmos manifested in a conscious way, and pertinent to a particular moment in causal time. A profusion of this latter type of magickal Order would be one such result of the New Aeon made manifest. In other words, what could be described as conventional occultism is that which is swayed by abstract theories over observation and intuition, whilst the genuine Western Way - for which read 'the Septenary System', Traditional Satanism, and so on - is concerned with what actually exists beyond limited personal forms. In real magick, there is an initial attempt to mimic the flow of natural forces, until an integration is achieved and with it, large-scale Willed Change - that is, conscious aeonic evolution. Via this process of magick - still the provence of the select few (Satanists of course!) - the Cosmos can progress to its next stage of existence: to live consciously via its manifestations; to evolve from childhood to adult existence. This is the secret of The Great Work."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 5 This path of genuine magick does not involve however the slavish following of some 'cosmic doctrine'/mandate, or any other such dogma. It involves the individual in freeing themselves from all influences in order to live, or become, the reality of the forces of Life itself. Thus the purpose of the Seven-Fold Way: to guide its Initiates towards the attainment of self-insight, where the 'personal' exists as a method to express the Cosmos, and not as a hinderence - through projections - of the apprehension of Life as a unified whole. The reality can only ever be experienced anew by each Initiate, since this apprehension of Life is a way of Being, and can only, as yet, be partially described by abstract methods. Thus each new Satanist - and genuine Satanic order - is a new manifestation of the living essence: thus there is Evolution. II: Archetypes and the Satanic Essence A magickal order such as the ONA is not motivated by trends in contemporary thinking, although it may on occassion manipulate 'fashion' to provoke an appropriate outcome. All forms - from magickal systems, to 'Art,' to revolutionary political organisations (etc.) - have a finite life-span, but the criteria by which present-day Occultists often judge forms as 'useful' or 'outmoded' is most usually influenced by temporal trends, by the status quo. One type of essential form so judged is the archetype. As discussed in Order MSS relating to Aeonics, the life-span of an archetype is not tied to 'linear time', or effected in any way by fleeting trends in society. At the very least, archetypes die when the civilisation to which they are bound dies - when a new aeon becomes manifest. Thus, they are subject to an aeonic/'alchemical' mode of time rather than the abstracted form by which we tend to live our personal lives, since 'time' is simply a measure of the change of Cosmic matter and energy. This aeonic mode of time may also be described as Racial. But even on the cusp of a new aeon, an archetype may spawn offspring - or rather, it may continue to change according to its nature and particular mode of time. This occurs when the ethos of one aeon is continued and evolved into the next, as hopefully will occur during the transition from this present Western Aeon to the next 'Galactic' one. "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 6 In order to really understand such things as archetypes, one must attain through self-effort, the aforementioned liberation from all contemporary influences - and from those influences which lie outside temporal forms. Most who do not follow the Seven-Fold Way will not achieve those stages beyond 'individuation' because the present concept of 'liberated thinking' or occult understanding is still in itself dictated by the influences that engineer this present society/culture. With regard to implementing the practical, 'magickal' purpose of archetypes, personal 'like' or 'dislike' of one form or another does not necessarily validate or invalidate the reality of that form, and should not provide the basis for making a reasoned judgement of what is, or is not, of aeonic significance (this is particularly true of 'politics' ...). In general, archetypes exert influence upon the unconscious, with mostly indirect results. However, Satan (or perhaps more accurately Satanas) is a numinous symbol, a living, Earth-based manifestation of the acausal. As such Satan is that force made conscious, and the gateway through which we as sentient Beings become the Will of the Cosmos. Satan therefore, is the esoteric word, \"image\", vibration, chant and deed of Cosmic evolution itself. The 'magick' of Satan and the Dark Gods in general are for us the keys to that Evolution. How present (or past) cultures view Satan is not entirely relevant, and should not be seriously considered by those attempting to form a judgement. Again, the reality has to be experienced. A Sinister organisation [and Satanas is the epitome of the Sinister] is imbued with that reality and seeks to increase the Cosmic Tides via its works in the 'real world'. Thus, the \"chaos\" trend of viewing all causal forms as merely means towards the 'Occult' attainment of some 'thing' is mistaken, because in this, a purely causal frame of reference - particularly in terms of 'time' - is used to judge that which actually possesses both causal and acausal components. It must be understood that techniques and forms are not there solely for individual experiencing/gratification, but rather that such things either express or counter an evolutionary pattern. In this, the understanding of the 'acausal component' is vital. Thus, not all forms by their causal nature express limited understanding of acausal forces. While some methods are practical tools by which the individual may attain various magickal levels (as in some Insight Roles), others are those forces made manifest in"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 7 the causal world: that is, the form so created is not a nexion to channel or presence the essence - it is the very essence itself; the essence evolving as it must evolve in causal time and space. This is so because such manifestations possess the greatest capacity to presence the continuous flow of Change that is Life [and significantly, do not always conform to coventional 'Occult' expectations: they are viewed as 'exoteric']. That some forms may express things that are culturally understood as 'plebian', primitive, or \"Old Aeon\" is absolutely irrelevant to their capacity to cause aeonic Change. This discernment requires the Satanic qualities of insight, knowledge, intuition and reason. For those unique individuals whose Destiny is tied to such a form, there is no living of that form while hiding the \"esoteric reality\", the esoteric wisdom - the occult aspect. There is no clever deceit, no skilled manipulation, because the form created is the reality, is that esoteric wisdom made real and practical. This is the domain of Vindex, that much misunderstood embodiment of creative Change. Vindex does not really need 'the Occult' in conventional terms, to presence, or access the numinous ideals that s/he represents. Such things, in this case, only obscure the essence of Change, of evolution - as they can often distance a person from the creative numen which can and does provoke such an evolution. Because of the nature of human consciousness, we possess the capability to extend and create symbols and forms (such as language, or more simply sound) which could describe the essence itself. Not all abstract symbols [whether mathematical, magickal or other] need inherently and ultimately obscure the essence; and neither is it in their nature - or in the nature of any form for that matter - to presence the acausal by purely intellectual procedures. In this we need to understand and integrate with existing numinous symbols in order to spawn completely new forms - this initial confrontation and then synthesis of 'opposites' (in terms of the psyche) allows the necessary organic (and latent) relationship to develope between human life and symbols and other forms. III: Synthesis The majority are still swayed by archetypal forces conventionally described as \"light\" and \"dark\". That there exists a reality beyond such opposites does not mean that those opposites, for the majority, do not exist. They exist and exert influence until they are confronted and transcended. A magickal Order understands this,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 8 and thus seeks to guide its adherents towards the realms 'beyond opposites' via appropriate ordeals/Grade rituals - that is, via the fires of experience. That some (and they are very few) may attain this transcendence does not mean that such archetypes cease to exist for others, or that the realms beyond opposites are any more 'real'. Each realm, from those symbolised by Initiate to Magus, expresses a reality in the process of Evolution, and cannot be accurately comprehended in linear terms. In one practical sense, what is \"good\" and what is \"evil\" may be said to exist, since these are the concepts, at this point in time, by which a society views the world - by which life, for the majority, is still influenced. That the definition of moral absolutes may alter over the ages does not itself alter the essence by which they effect the process of human living. This bifurcation still exists because that is the nature of our species at present, as it has been for centuries, despite the many external changes that have occurred, and despite the intellectual musings of philosophers and occultists alike. This is unlikely to begin to change beyond its current primary level until the emergence of the next aeon - some four hundred years from now. Thus a rite such as the genuine Black Mass still possesses real magickal purpose for individuals at a certain level of their development, as well as contributing to the necessary, broader aeonic changes. Such a rite accesses Nazarene/Magian energies and then re-directs them in a sinister way - and, as has been stated elsewhere in ONA MSS, the Satanist does not believe in the reality of \"God\", or the 'divinity' of the Nazarene, only that others so believe. Thus, there is still great relevance in promoting and practising a system of genuine \"Black\" magick which aims to counter the works of those who promote and practise magick of the \"White\" variety: in terms of the psyche of the West, a cosmic battle must still be played out if a synthesis is to be achieved by civilisation as a whole. In esoteric terms, this is to say that our civilisation has not as yet evolved to the stage of Adeptship. The goal of the Sinister Initiate is to aid this aeonic synthesis, and the methods by which they achieve this for the majority will differ in many instances from those which enabled this achievement for them as individuals. In reality, both an esoteric Black and White Order do exist, but the form that is now conventionally understood as \"evil\" is instead the way that will allow the necessary transition to take place, and thus prevent the stagnation and decay that would result from the triumph of Magian forces [as presenced by the \"White\" Order]. In the most profound sense therefore, it is the Sinister Path that"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 9 enshrines what is genuinely divine and life-enhancing... In this very real Cosmic battle, Satan does not feature as some Judaeo-Nazarene device to oppress 'the Folk', but as a numinous symbol for our civilisation, of all that defies the counter-evolutionary force of the Magian. What is rarely expressed, however, is that such counter-evolutionary forces are part of the process of Cosmic Change, part of the Wyrd of Western civilisation. For without such opposition there is no real evolution, no Triumph of the Will - and no Life. Thus to oppose such counter-evolutionary forces is to positively aid aeonic evolution and bring the intergration with Nature so often sought by those who follow an Occult way. It has been often said that 'opposition' and the identifying of enemy forces (sometimes mistakenly described as \"scapegoats\") is now counter-evolutionary, and somehow \"old aeon\". This is a tragic forgetting of what we, as a Western - or Aryan - Race are, and will always be: hunters and warriors. And it is through the opposition which we do draw to ourselves by virtue of what we are, that we are able to struggle, fight, and thus evolve. If our instincts are still healthy and intact, we will know the forces that are working against us and consequently how to combat them in defence of the Honour of our Wyrd. As practitioners of magick, we must have the understanding to allow those numinous symbols which presence - or 'order' - the wyrd of the aeon to which we are bound, to evolve unhindered according to their own mode of time; to flow with, and consciously become those forces, rather than aid counter-evolutionary powers by allowing limited personal ideas and projections to dominate. Real practitioners of Aeonic magick do not project their own understanding onto the society of their time, as they do not seek in their practises to elevate the understanding of their contempories by willful self-expression. Changes in the collective psyche will take much longer than one lifetime, and will instead swell in waves, over Aeons. Thus, a genuine practitioner of Aeonic magick works with the raw materials and possibilities that characterise the society of their time: they do not work beyond practical boundaries. And in this, importantly, an Aeonic magickian is not swayed solely by the desire to witness the fruits of their understanding in their own personal lifetime; they plan for"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 10 centuries ahead, and embody in their Being the slowness of evolution, the Wisdom of Ages ... IV: Eira For the occultist, the great curse of his endeavours lies in a pronounced capacity to think too much: to over-intellectualise, to analyse - to seek too readily to express practical truths via academic articles, and such like. Ideally, at this stage in esoteric development, a gradual move away from the intellectual approach should begin to emerge, along with an acceptance of the necessity for carving out the future by practical acts. The time for seeking to achieve influence via the written academic word should be waning, replaced instead by the understanding that such a seeking will only have a significant role following the practical realisation of the next esoteric stages - that is, when there is wisdom to distill from new deeds. At this point, there should be a hunger to experience, to pioneer - to re-express the essence. The profusion of occult writings and journals, and pronouncements of organisations, should be viewed by the modern, intrepid occultist with tedium and disdain. There should be presenced within the modern occultist that insatiable desire to speak and create from direct experience; to redefine by extraordinary experiencing those things which have become accepted truths and dusty, arcane lore: to live a hero's life, rather than enter the boring debates over strategy, tactics and history. The above, quintessentially Satanic attitude, is still a rarity. In keeping with contemporary trends, the modern occultist behaves more like the Quantum scientist - allowing the intellect to dominate in the first instance, seeking answers through analysis before a thing has been uniquely tasted and experienced. The worrying trend is revealed in the occassional prefacing of articles with: \"We have observed/seen in others ... \", and then going from there to draw judgements without the need to experience what those others have experienced. This is particularly - and disturbingly - true of the various approaches to Aeonics. The worrying aspect is that this, the most profound of magickal techniques, is becoming a forum for academic debate, analysis and the pronouncement of personal opinions under the guise of Insight. Aeonic Magick - the flow of civilisations - is an utterly organic process. It cannot be subjected to academic and personal projections, for that is to make it into something else entirely. As"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 11 has been constantly stressed, the process requires individuals to lose what is personal of themselves by becoming completely immersed in practical aeonic forms. There is most certainly a subtle guiding, sometimes a subtle altering of those forms; but there is also, very significantly, a giving up of oneself to those aspects which cannot be controlled, which flow as they flow regardless of individual influence. The nearest analogy to this process lies in the flight of a seagull, as it rides the wind, adapting to a sudden storm; flying in calm weather, but going with the direction of the gales that may dictate a new course. It takes great skill, and the development of a perfect balance between what is individually willed, and what is unfolded by the greater flow of Life itself. Consequently, Aeonics requires the individual to brave the unknown, and forge uniquely from what cannot be pinned down, a new experiencing of the constant, awesome becoming of the Cosmos. We have the practical tools to do this via the various forms, discussed many times, that presently exist in the world. And each new person who really lives those forms, who becomes fully immersed so they effectively are those forms, brings to flower something which utterly defies the academic debates and analysis: something new, something living - a storm to change the flow of our lives. Occultists should possess the insight to recognise that point beyond which debate and critical analysis cease to become productive for all individuals, of all allegiances. This is particularly true with regard to aeonic forms which are still growing, still in their early stages. There comes a time when the organic process of Change as a whole must be left alone to develope of itself, and personal objections of a thing are silenced. Occultists must be aware of the need to create conditions by which the necessary process of thesis - antithesis - synthesis, inherent within all aeonic forms, can flourish. This is a slow process - painfully so when apprehended within the time span of one individual causal life - and requires for its growth a way of Living on the part of individuals. Individuals cannot be led to this way of Living by the adoption of forceful opinions, as esoteric organisations cannot be built upon such opinions. Again, this insight involves laying aside personal motivations - knowing when to act and when to move with that greater flow of Life. A useful example of a form for which strategical, semantic"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 12 debate is now becoming counter-productive is that of 'politics' - particularly where Race/Racism is concerned. Such things are still not understood on a rudimentary level let alone on an aeonic one, and are still too practically nascent to be subject to the lofty criticisms of the esoteric commentator. Therefore it is imperative that a few individuals at least strive to keep alive the promise of magick by being prepared to change their lives (including the 'occult' aspect) in order to seek to become that tool for Change; prepared to suffer the mistakes, the 'loss of face', the real dangers that will assuredly follow. Of those few individuals who have lived thus, all will testify to the profound, almost indescribable difference encountered by living and immersing oneself in an aeonic form, as opposed to the overview supposedly gained from literature and observing the experiences of other people. The former is to be an organic part of the dialectic of Life, re-defining, re-experiencing the essence; the latter, a victim and perpetuator of brain-washing. The outer forms of aeonics can always be criticised - but the critical observations are not the point, are not the magick. The point lies solely in the aforementioned dialectic of Life: if the only way of achieving this intergration means that an individual must become for a time a real revolutionary fighter, and risk spending some of that time in prison, then that is the only way - that is the harsh choice faced by those who have undertaken the Great Work. However, for the majority faced with making this stark choice, personal feelings still continue to dictate, obscuring and ultimately killing the Will of the Cosmos that is presenced within each individual. This Will is not dictated by personal choice, but is like the wind itself, a sudden reality upon which we must ride if the end goal is to be reached. This is one reason why Traditional Satanists eschew all those established beliefs and methods which bring comfort, all those old gods who bring familiarity and enervating 'identity'. Individuals may sincerely believe that such things, and their histories and ways, are important - but they really are not. So what is the reality? ... Sadly, the only present reality is that life is still too soft, too easy for the majority to be impelled by the terrifying process of Creation. V: The Future Aeon For the Present, we exist in a society characterised by a 'supermarket' approach of choice and consumption, where individuals no longer create history, but look backwards and study, and romanticise - and distort. The realm of the Esoteric is no"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 13 exception to this, and thus it is vital that we as Occultists, as creative individuals, cease to waste our time delving into the folk-tales and legends of past, dead cultures - this includes those of the Norse, Celtic, Saxon, and whatever else passes for conventional esoteric interest. Because to derive esoteric inspiration from the dim and distant deeds of an archetype is a waste of the magickal opportunity that exists now, with the people who exist now and the potential that they can embody in the future. To create and perform rituals based on a dim and distant fireside tale - or employ the symbolism of a past communal life-style - is a counter-productive [in aeonic terms] indulgence. A 'culture' is, magickally, unimportant. What matters is civilisation - or more precisely, the living, evolving force that moves a civilisation forwards, and which is in itself embodied by that civilisation. In this, the creativity of an associated culture is only of relevance if it presences this living, moving force. When we enter a place of enigmatic 'historical interest', such as an old settlement or stone circle, we do not need to psychically unravel - or seek to re-enact - the secrets of a past community: we who live now are those secrets, we are that enigma. We must only tap into the genius of our creatvity and flow forwards, leaving the monuments, the ruins - the dead shells - where they belong. If there is a message locked within the unknown dolmen, it is this. However, to use the form of an ancient or old archetype for the purpose of doing something with that archetype in the world is another matter. But this implies re-presenting such an archetype as the hero of a new mythos - a mythos entirely representational of the current aeonic phase, and by that token one which allows the next phase to be reached. Thus, a new mythos would feature an established archetype committing great acts of nobility (and great acts of terror), the nature and form of which would inspire and liberate the 'modern masses'. The magick of the archetype would be in its living now in the real world, rather than having existed in some ethereal realm of the past; a past when the manifestation of Human life was, in many respects, very different to today. These differences lie in what is and what is not practically needed in order for the people of modern 'Western' society to feel inspired towards overcoming the problems, self-imposed and otherwise, of their day-to-day existence. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 14 The deeds of this archetype could be a re-presentation of those acts committed by a real-life, modern day hero (such as a Satanist) - or the creation of a new legend, the practical basis of which has yet to occur, therefore inspiring individuals to bring it to life in the causal world ... The ways and methods of this powerful magickal technique are legion. What is rarely considered by 'pagans' and occultists alike, is how archetypes organically change as a civilisation organically changes according to its various cultural, political and historical phases. For the West, one of our primary archetypes is that of the Warrior. As long as we as a Race continue to live, this archetype will never cease to be relevant: it will never die. However, the form by which this archetype exerts its influence on a Folk always changes according to the development of those things which aid racial survival. It is this latter form of development which defines the work of an Aeonic magickian, and not, as previously stated, temporary intellectual trends/fashion. Thor, for example, was once a real, living individual tied to a Folk Community, who achieved immortality and 'god status' by doing great heroic deeds. These deeds provided inspiration for that Folk to practically emulate those deeds - and perhaps even surpass them. But, as stated above, we as a Folk have since moved into an entirely different set of circumstances to those which pertained to a particular phase in Norse history. In order to effectively deal with the evolutionary problems of today, we need an archetype that we can realistically and practically follow in deed. But this does not imply a blatant and disrespectful casting aside of the glorious deeds of our ancestors. Rather, we are now presented with the challenge of leaving the comforts of adhering to a far-distant past and gathering instead the courage to practically realise that this new warrior archetype has, within the scope of history, recently evolved and lives now within the soul of the Western Race. This new archetype speaks of the future, and allows the old gods of the past to fade with dignity, as is their desire. To accept this new archetype and to seek to aid it marks the adults from those who are still children, who still seek refuge in fairy tales - who still need the crutch of their parental ancestors. After all, what is more frightening: dreaming of a semi-mythical wizard who dwelt in the Dark Ages, or joining allegiance with a great Warrior of"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 15 our time, who demands that we literally fight - and possibly die - alongside? And what new form does the Warrior now take? To accept and use this knowledge is to wield real, practical magick - to taste the living fruits of the cosmos. But it is for each potential adept to make their own discovery ... VI: The Art of Future Magick The essence of Future Magick is quite simple. It does not involve complicated 'occult' rituals where circles are drawn, implements brandished, and earth-shattering 'words of power' laboriously recited by a 'High Priest'. It does not involve fumigating an indoor Temple with the correct incense, or observing the archiac correspondences contained in dreaded books of dead things. It does not involve a group of robed individuals standing in a circle and observing some ancient tradition, or beating drums in worship of some lovely celestial goddess and some virile horned god. All such obvious occult trappings are now ephemera, and fundamentally, are of the past. It is not surprising that the practise of such things is growing, since we live in a time when all communal traditions, all senses of spiritual meaning are fading or are being destroyed. But there are no secrets contained in the past - no message from the mists of time to guide us forward. As previously stated, we who live now are the message of our future evolution: all that has happened throughout the aeons has led to this point, and, despite appearences, we as a species know more now than we ever have known. In order to move forwards, we must make this reality a living one, within each and every one of our lives. We must trust in our latent, evolved creative genius and have the courage to discard the romantic trappings we as a species are becoming dependent upon. The Galactic future can be presenced through our magick if we allow it to be. This requires a leap of faith into the Abyss - into the realm of Satan. All that the new ceremonies require, is for individuals who possess this new aeonic faith to gather at specific times and perhaps light a bonfire which will function as a focus/symbol for the gathering. All else will create itself from there. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 16 The specific gathering times - or fests - are as follows: Mid - end of April; Early November; Spring Equinox; Mid - end of May; Summer Solstice; Early - mid August; Autumn Equinox; Winter Solstice; Late January - late Feb. These are the times when the seasonal energies/cosmic tides are at their most pronounced. These energies, in themselves unbound by any phase in history, are, in the manner of magick, re-expressed each year according to the circumstances of the celebrating and the broader esoteric changes occurring at that time. Of neccessity a traditional form such as a Nine Angles rite provides the basis for each fest - but such a rite is in itself unbound by imagery from the dead and distant past (qv. Black Book III). In essence, the 'Galactic' or acausal magick that will presence the Future, is expressed through chant and thought, and thus brings the living synthesis of Being that each act of magick seeks. This is the magick that has always characterised the meaning of genuine Satanism: the Way of Empathy. The practising of the fests expresses a conscious integration with the living cosmic forces, and reaches the height of expression when woven into the life of a rural community. VII: Fundi A great deal has been written over the years concerning the concept of the nexion, and while the basic meaning is widely understood - that of a nexion being a point where the acausal intrudes into the causal universe (and vice versa) - the outer form that a nexion may take requires some further explanation. Firstly, a nexion can take many forms, and may even be a combination of forms. According to very rare conditions, an aeonic nexion may be an individual. Or it could be a revolutionary Religious form. Or, as stated, it could constitute several such forms co-existing in the world in order to bring forth the aeonic transition. However, the standard image is usually that of an isolated, wind-swept hill, which may perhaps include upon it some ancient ruined structures. It is such an isolated place that is usually sought by occultists when attempting to open a gate/nexion. This attempt will most likely involve regular performance at the chosen site of rituals designed to presence the acausal (such as Nine Angles ceremonies, etc. - qv. Order MSS Thernn). Thus, a tradition is started whereby a reservoir of energies is created for future Adepts to draw from"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 17 and direct according to desire. Several such places have been established over the years in the British Isles, with one site in particular having been opened in an area of the Welsh Marches over 1,000 years ago in order to inaugurate the Western Aeon, as has been documented by the Dark Tradition. Thus, the nexion associated with the present Western Aeon was indeed an isolated, genuinely esoteric place. However, it was only thus because of the nature of the times in which it was created: times characterised by the Nazarene oppression, which demanded an esoteric approach to preserving what we sometimes term as the 'Western ethos'. This was in contrast to the nexion which presenced the Hyperborian Aeon of Albion. This nexion existed in the area of Stonehenge. The nexion then was not solely the henge itself, or the land upon which it was built, or the folk who lived and worshipped there: it was a combination of all thosefactors. The nexion of Albion was the organic whole of the community which grew there; a living, working centre where all the threads of nature and human-kind were woven as one. What can be found at that site now is the dead shell of what was once a living organism - a nexion by which life evolved significantly. Because of the enervating nature of this present time, the nexion associated with the next aeon and which is being established now, is also an organic whole - a community. But this community must in this present age develope covertly, since to openly establish it as an 'occult' venture would be to hinder its slow, natural growth, and turn it into something short-sighted and short-lived: a 'project' attempting to bend the Will of Nature in accordance with a set of accepted 'ideas'. That is, such a venture would seek to project upon the essence a limited understanding of what constitutes the 'esoteric', and would thus represent a step backwards, into that which is already dying. The community instead allows the essence to dictate the ways of living, and remains always separate from 'occult' forums and trends in order that it may presence the future by founding a new organic approach to Life itself. From this slow, aeonic development will come the new forms, the new expressions, the new magick - of themselves, unhindered by any pre-conceptions or expectations, and free from all past and fading archetypes. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 18 Thus the community itself will become the new esoteric path; the new religion - the new country. In order to make this next phase meaningful and significant - that is, practical - a leap of faith is required: a breaking away from the established, on all levels. Thus, the spirit of real pioneering is to be invoked, and there is no reason why ultimately this leap of faith cannot be repeated across the diverse regions of the Earth. In establishing this nexion, the cycle that began in Albion will have returned to its new beginning. This beginning is in essence quite simple: it is the cultivating of the conscious apprehension of the acausality of 'time', from which all else shall follow. Only from these seemingly humble, rural beginnings can emerge the race that will practically extend towards the stars, since both the Will and the form of technology required to fulfil the Galactic Destiny can only develope organically from revolutionary organic beginnings and methods. The hidden, outwardly 'non-esoteric' community will be this new beginning, and must subsequently be nurtured in such a way that it flourishes for at least 1,000 years. This new form signifies the closing of all that outwardly consitutes this present age, and is the essence itself, not merely a vehicle for the expression of the essence. It is a combination of both causal and acausal: it is a living nexion - the next stage, made practical, in our evolution. What is described above represents the essence of magick. VII: Addendum And so in this, and in other ONA writings, the practical meaning of Magick is explicated - all that is now required of sinister esoteric Orders and individuals is the Will to make the meaning a reality. Thus, in conclusion, the magickal aims of a genuine sinister organisation should be as follows: 1) To continue to maintain the existing Tradition by diseminating the various teachings and methods [as published in MSS such as Codex Saerus, Naos and others]. 2) To practically aid those 'exoteric' forms which will bring the New Aeon. 3) To extend the Tradition by creating new forms of the sinister. These would include Artistic [musick/images/writing]; 'Magickal' [new ceremonial/hermetic forms]; and practical, numinous ways of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 19 living [as in the creation of an esoteric rural community, or communities - qv. Order MSS Thernn]. In Satanism, lies the stuff of modern folk-tales - of future legends; for unlike others, the Satanist lives the life and dies the death of a Hero. This is not a claim made lightly. As a consequence of the actions of a few, the next fifty years will witness a Recalling of the devastating Creative force that each individual life can will into Becoming. Though many will dismiss it because they do not have the courage to try, the Way of Satan remains, amidst the myriad of 'paths' the essence of the Great Work. Experto credite. And when the works are complete, a Satanist disappears from sight - toward the next stage, leaving astonishment, disbelief and many questions in their wake. And then the failures begin their campaign, of distortion and lies. Just occasionally, they may hear our laughter. C. Riabhaich/ONA. Revised: ONA 1998 eh. Published by The Venn Community, Shropshire, 1998eh; Vindex Press, USA, 1998eh. - Order of Nine Angles - "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 1 A lot has been said and written in recent years about the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, particularly his Cthulhu mythos, but to gain an insight into the truth it is necessary to compare Lovecraft's mythos with one of the most sinister traditions of Occultism. Lovecraft, aware of parts of the ancient tradition of the Dark Gods' dramatized and mis-represented the tradition as a whole. Part of this mis-representation was literary, some of it arose because Lovecraft could not see beyond the Abyss where opposites are meaningless, but most of the mis-representation arose because Lovecraft had access to only part of the tradition, through his own Occult researches and sometimes inept experiments with dream control. To these, he added inventions of his own - such as the so-called 'Necronomicon' (the book of this title published by Colin Wilson et al is a hoax) - which he wove into the cthulhu mythos. This mythos bears about as much resemblance to the genuine tradition of the Dark Gods, from which it is derived, as a fir tree does to an oak. One of Lovecraft's mis-representations is in naming the Dark Gods. The Dark Gods (or 'forces') may be symbolized by vibrations, since it is partly through such vibration that certain levels of consciousness may be reached. These levels re-present primal Chaos - that is, they are devoid of Word since such levels pre-date the covering up, by Word, ritual, idea and even myth, of the essence from which Being and non-Being were derived. Viewed conventionally, these entities are negative and by their return restore Chaos - that is, they destroy the historicality of Being. When seen through the stricture of opposites such a return is terrifying. According to tradition, the Dark Gods are waiting, in what may be described as a parallel universe, to return to Earth and thus our spatial, causal universe. Essentially, the universe of the Dark Gods is acausal and the two universes may be re-presented as being joined by various Star Gates (or more accurately 'nexions'). These 'Gates' are regions of space-time where passage from one universe to another is possible at certain times - that is, when the Gates are"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 2 aligned according to their cosmic cycle. Traditionally, it is believed that these Gates open about once every 2,000 years. Because of the nature of the two connecting universes (that is, their difference in time and spatial geometry) not only is physical travel possible between them, but also to a limited extent, a special form of astral travel. This astral form is possible because our own consciousness, by its nature and evolution, is partly acausal and therefore already to an extent on a primal level part of this other universe. Thus, it is possible for an individual to journey into the other realms where the Dark Gods are waiting just as it is feasible - if the psychic Gates are opened - for those dreaded and negative entities who are seldom named to manifest on our level. Such travels are manifestly only feasible when a nexion is about to be opened, is open or is closing - that is, at the beginning and ending of an Aeon. At other times, travel is very difficult and very severe measures must be taken in order to create the energy required. Such methods have seldom been used in the past: they involve great danger to the individual(s), hideous rituals of suffering and sacrifice, or immense detail in preparation and the acquisition of a crystal tetrahedron of the right quality. The intrusion of these entities into our universe takes many forms, both physical and psychic, and here again Lovecraft has mis-represented them. According to Tradition, the last overt physical manifestation took place thousands of years ago, around 8,000 BP and gave rise to, among other legends, the myth of Dragons. Prior to this, the sinister tradition speaks of the first coming of the Dark Gods at the dawn of our consciousness - probably around 2O,OOO yes BP. Psychic intrusion is often minimal but nevertheless terrifying for some. According to one recent account: \"They lurk at the threshold of existence preening their wings and eyes and sounds which they send forth to all who have ears to hear and minds to know. And they wait and reside in the space between worlds, the space that is the corner of the meeting of dimensions. They are the destroyers ... the bornless forever who wait for our call. Soon they will come to collect that blood which is required by Them. To understand Them is to pass that Abyss beyond which the man ceases to be.\" Such manifestations often take the form of nightmares when unsought, and occasional madness is not unknown among those who have deliberately tried to bring the Dark Gods: for example, in a case known to the author a group tried, in the early seventies, to invoke these forces. The working was only partially successful and one of those involved went mad."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 3 One of the most noticeable effects of deliberate contact by Adepts is the change that results in the consciousness of certain groups of people and individuals - such as a resurgence of primitive atavisms. Such changes are often misunderstood, bound as most people still are by old Aeon concepts of duality, and over recent decades these changes have been a prelude to the calling forth that will re-open the physical nexion and return the Dark Gods to our universe and thus the Earth itself. The details that Lovecraft gives regarding 'calls' and rites are mostly fanciful and only in a few places does he inadvertently reveal the truth - for example, in his mention of the trapezohedron and 'Azathoth'. The key to travel along the passages between the star nexions is the Nine Angles and the key to the Nine Angles is the crystal tetrahedron which is activated by voice vibration. 'Azathoth' as described by Lovecraft, is a symbolic and distorted re-presentation of the intersection, in acausal space-time, of these astral star passages: a kind of galactic vortex or node. Those who journey there never return the same. Along the star passages the shells of long dead civilizations lie strewn. The Nine Angles (the key to contact both physical and astral) are re-presented in the septenary Star Game and it is through this symbolic re-presentation that the magick of the Dark Gods is made manifest. The rest, to the uninitiated, is sheer terror. - Order of Nine Angles - "}]
