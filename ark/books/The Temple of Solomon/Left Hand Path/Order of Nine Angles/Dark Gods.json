According to our spatial, causal perception,these beings may be regarded as `timeless and chaotic'.Since our consciousness is by its nature partly acausal theseentities can become manifest for us if we possess the keys to reachthe appropriate levels of consciousness. What is termed the `Abyss'separates our everyday consciousness from the consciousness (and thusapprehension) of the Dark Gods. The ordeal of the Abyss involvesconfronting these entities – and accepting them for what they are,that is, unbound by our illusion of opposites and the conflictof `good' and `evil'.While it is convenient to regard the Dark Gods as merely symbols thatre-present the energies of the acausal – as a projection of our ownconsciousness upon Chaos itself – it is equally possible to regardthem as physically existing in themselves. Which of these (or neitherof them) is correct, the Adept discovers during the ordeal of theAbyss. Legend, however, recalls the Dark Gods as visiting our planetseveral times in the past – by passing through one of the many `StarGates'. Star Gates are regions in space-time where our causaluniverse and the universe of the acausal are joined – they arephysical gates, and passage from one universe to another is possiblethrough them. According to legend, Star Gates exist near to starsDabih, Naos and Algol: that is, if you journeyed from Earth in thedirection of one of these stars you would pass through a Star Gate.There are also stories of a Star Gate within our own solar system –the Gate through which the Dark Gods came to Earth. This Star Gate isbelieved to be near the planet Saturn.Sometimes, the Abyss invades our dreams, but mostly the Abyss isreached by following the seven-fold way. It lies between the spheresof the Sun and Mars, and divides the Adept from the Master/Mistress.It is the Gate to the gods within us and the gods without."}]
