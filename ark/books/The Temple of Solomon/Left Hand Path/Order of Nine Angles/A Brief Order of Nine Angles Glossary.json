[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Brief Order of Nine Angles GlossaryIntroductory Note:The Order of Nine Angles employs a variety of specialist esoteric terms, such a nexion, presencing,acausal, Tree of Wyrd, and so on.It also needs to be understood that the ONA uses some now generally used exoteric terms - such aspsyche, and archetype - in a particular and precise esoteric way, and thus such terms should not beconsidered as being identical to those used by others and defined, for example, by JungAbyss:Exoterically, the Abyss represents the region where the causal gives way to, or merges into, theacausal, and thus where the causal is “transcended”, gone beyond, or passed, and where one enters therealm of pure acausality. Hence The Abyss can be considered as an interchange, a nexus, of temporal,atemporal, and spatial and aspatial, dimensions. This region is, for example, symbolized on The Treeof Wyrd, as being between the spheres of Sun and Mars, and ‘Entering the Abyss’ is that stage ofmagickal development which distinguishes the Master/ Mistress from the Adept.Esoterically, The Tree of Wyrd is itself a re-presentation of The Abyss, as are other esotericre-presentations, such as The Star Game.Acausal:The term acausal refers to “acausal Time and acausal Space”: that is, to the acausal Universe. Thisacausal Universe is part of the Cosmos, which Cosmos consists of both the acausal and the causal,where “causal” refers to the Universe that is described, or re-presented, by causal Space and causalTime. This causal Universe is that of our physical, phenomenal, Universe, currently described bysciences such as Physics and Astronomy.The acausal is non-Euclidean, and “beyond causal Time”: that is, it cannot be represented by our finitecausal geometry (of three spatial dimensions at right angles to each other) and by the flow, the change,of causal Time (past-present-future), or measured by a duration of causal Time.In addition - and just as causal energy exists in the causal (understood as such energy is by sciencessuch as Physics) - acausal energy exists in the acausal, of a nature and type which cannot be describedby causal sciences such as Physics (based as these are on a causal geometry and a causal Time).According to the aural tradition of the ONA, there are a variety of acausal life-forms; a variety ofacausal life, of different species, some of which have been manifest in (or intruded into) our causal Universe."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"For more details regarding the acausal, and acausal life, see the following ONA MSS: (1) The Mythosof the Dark Gods: Beings of Acausal Darkness; (2) Advanced Introduction to The Dark Gods:Five-Dimensional Acausal Sorcery.Aeon:An Aeon - according to the Sinister Way of the ONA - is a particular presencing of certain acausalenergies on this planet, Earth, which energies affect a multitude of individuals over a certain period ofcausal time. One such affect is via the psyche of individuals. This particular presencing which is anAeon is via a particular nexion, which is an Aeonic civilization, which Aeonic civilization isbrought-into-being in a certain geographical area and usually associated with a particular mythos.Archetype:An archetype is a particular causal presencing of a certain acausal energy and is thus akin to a type ofacausal living being in the causal (and thus “in the psyche”): it is born (or can be created, by magickalmeans), its lives, and then it “dies” (ceases to be present, presenced) in the causal (i.e. its energy in thecausal ceases).Baphomet:Baphomet is regarded as a Dark Goddess - a sinister female entity, The Mistress (or Mother) of Blood.According to tradition, she is represented as a beautiful mature woman, naked from the wait up, whoholds in her hand the severed head of a man.She is regarded as one manifestation of one of The Dark Gods.Black Book of Satan:The book of that name containing the traditional ceremonial rituals of sinister/Satanic ceremonialmagick, used by ONA Initiates.Dark Gods:According to the Sinister Tradition of the ONA, The Dark Gods are specific entities - living-beings ofa particular acausal species - who exist in the realms of the acausal, with some of these entitieshaving been presenced, via various nexions, on Earth in our distant past. [See, for example, the ONAMS The Mythos of the Dark Gods: Beings of Acausal Darkness. ]Falcifer:1) The title of the first volume of The Deofel Quartet.2) The exoteric name given to the esoteric (or “hidden”) nexion which is opened by Adepts to preparethe way for Vindex. This nexion - like Vindex - may be presenced in a specific individual, or in agroup of individuals. There is a symbiotic relationship between Falcifer and Vindex, who - ifpresenced in individuals - can be either male or female.Magick:Magick - according to the Sinister tradition of the ONA - is defined as “the presencing of acausalenergy in the causal by means of a nexion. By the nature of our consciousness, we, as humanindividuals, are one type of nexion - that is, we have the ability to access, and presence, certain typesof acausal energy.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Furthermore, magick - as understand and practised by the ONA - is a means not only of personaldevelopment and personal understanding (a freeing from psychic, archetypal, influences and affects)but also of evolving to the next level of our human existence where we can understand, and to a certainextent control and influence, supra-personal manifestations of acausal energies, such as an Aeon, andthus cause, or bring-into-being, large-scale evolutionary change. Such understanding, such control,such a bring-into-being, is Aeonic Magick.Aeonic Magick is the magick of the Adept and those beyond: the magick of the evolved human beingwho has achieved a certain level of self-understanding and self-mastery and who thus is no longer atthe mercy of unconscious psychic, archetypal, influences, both personal/individual, and of otherliving-beings, such as an Aeon.Internal Magick is the magick of personal change and evolution: of using magick to gain insight and todevelope one’s personality and esoteric skills. There are seven stages involved in Internal Magick.External Magick is basic, “low-level”, sorcery - where certain acausal energies are used for bring or tofulfil the desire of an individual.Ceremonial Magick is the use (by more than two individuals gathered in a group) of a set or particulartexts or sinister rituals to access and presence sinister energies.Five-dimensional magick is the New Aeon magick sans symbols, ceremonies, symbology (such as theTree of Wyrd) and beyond all causal abstractions, and it is prefigured in the advanced form of TheStar Game.Naos:1) The name of one of the “boards” (spheres) of The Star Game, taken from the star of the same name:Zeta Puppis in the constellation Argo.2) The title of the ONA text “Naos - A Practical Guide to Becoming An Adept”.3) According to aural legend, there is also a Star Gate - an actual physical nexion - in the regionaround or near to this particular star.Nexion:A nexion is a specific connexion between, or the intersection of, the causal and the acausal, andnexions can, exoterically, be considered to be akin to “gates” or openings or “tunnels” where there is,or can be, either a flow of acausal energy (and thus also of acausal entities) from the acausal into ourcausal Space and causal Time; a journeying into the acausal itself; or a willed, conscious flow orpresencing (by dark sorcery) of acausal energies.Basically, there are three main types of nexion. The first is an actual physical nexion. The second typeof nexion is a living causal being, such as ourselves. The third type of nexion is a magickal creation:that is, some form in-which acausal energy is presenced or “channelled into” by a sinister Adept. [Formore details of these three types see the ONA MS The Mythos of the Dark Gods.]Nine Angles:The Nine Angles have several meanings - or interpretations, exoteric and esoteric - depending on context.In the esoteric sense, they re-present the nine combinations (and transformations) of the three basic“alchemical” substances, which nine and their transformations (causal and acausal) are themselves"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"re-presented by The Star Game.In the exoteric, pre-Adept, sense, they may be said to re-present the 7 nexions of the Tree of Wyrd plusthe 2 nexions which re-present the ToW as itself a nexion, with The Abyss (a connexion between theindividual and the acausal) being one of these 2 “other nexions”. It should be remembered, of course,that each sphere of the ToW is not two-dimensional (or even three-dimensional) and in a simple wayeach sphere can be taken as a reflexion (a “shadow”) of another - for example, Mercury is the’shadow’ of Mars.In another exoteric sense, the nine are the alchemical process of the 7 plus the 2, which 2 are theconjoining of opposites: and, in one sense, this conjoining can be taken to be (magickally, for instance,in a practical ritual) as the conjoining of male and female (hence what is called one of the Rites of theNine Angles) - although there are other practical combinations, just as each magickal act involvingsuch Angles should be undertaken for a whole and particular alchemical season: that is, such aworking should occupy a space of causal-time, making it thus a type of four-dimensional magickwhich can access the fifth magickal dimension, the acausal itself. A somewhat more advancedunderstanding of the Nine - in relation to a ritual to create a Nexion - is hinted at in the recentfiction-based MS Atazoth.Beyond this, the Nine Angles are symbols of The Star Game which itself is magick - that is, onenexion which can presence the acausal. But even this is only a beginning - a re-presentation, insymbols, of what is, in essence, without symbols: a useful means for Initiates, and Adepts, to movetoward the new five-dimensional magick embodied in, and beyond, the ONA.Psyche:The psyche of the individual is a term used, in the Sinister Way, to describe those aspects of anindividual - those aspects of consciousness - which are hidden, or inaccessible to, or unknown to, theindividual. Basically, such aspects can be considered to be those forces/energies which do or whichcan influence the individual in an emotional way or in a way which the individual has no direct controlover or understanding of. One part of this psyche is what has been called “the unconscious”, and someof the forces/energies of this “unconscious” have been, and can be, described by the term “archetypes”Satan:Satan is regarded, by the ONA, as the exoteric “name” of a particular acausal being: that is, as a livingentity dwelling in the acausal. This entity has the ability to presence, to be manifest in, our causal,phenomenal world, and the ability - being a shapeshifter - to assume various causal forms. [Regardingthe \"names\" of such beings, see, for example, Footnote (2) of the MS The Mythos of the Dark Gods. ]Satanism:According to the ONA, Satanism is a specific Left Hand Path, one aim of which is to transform, toevolve, the individual by the use of esoteric Arts, including Dark Sorcery. Another aim is, throughusing the Sinister Dialectic, to transform the world, and the causal itself, by - for example - returning,presencing, in the causal, not only the entity known as Satan but also others of The Dark Gods.Septenary:A name for the basic symbology (causal magickal symbolism) of the Seven Fold Sinister Wayrepresented exoterically by The Tree of Wyrd, and consisting of seven stages or “spheres” joined byvarious pathways."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Sinister Dialectic:The sinister dialectic (often called the sinister dialectic of history) is the name given to Satanic strategy- which is to further our evolution in a sinister way by, for example, (a) the use of BlackMagick/sinister presencings to change individuals/events on a significant scale over long periods ofcausal Time; (b) to gain control and influence; (c) the use of Satanic forms and magickal presencingsto produce/provoke large scale changes over periods of causal Time; (d) to bring-into-being a NewAeon; (e) to cause and sow disruption and Chaos as a prelude to any or all or none of the foregoing.Sinister Way:A name given to the system of training (magickal and practical) of Initiates used by the ONA.Sometimes also called The Seven-Fold Sinister Way.It consists of seven stages, each represented by a particular magickal Grade. [See, for example, theONA MS NAOS.] One aim of the Way is to create Satanic individuals.Sorcery:Often used as a synonym of magick. Sorcery - according to the Dark, Sinister, tradition followed bythe ONA - is the use, by an individual, individuals, or a group, of acausal energy, either directly(raw/acausal/chaos) or by means of symbolism, forms, ritual, words, chant (or similar manifestationsor presencing(s) of causal constructs) with this usage often involving a specific, temporal (causal), aimor aims. [See the ONA MSS An Introduction to Dark Sorcery and NAOS.]Star Game:The Star Game is a re-presentation of the nine aspects of the basic three whose changing in causal timerepresents a particular presencing of acausal energy. That is, the nine re-presents not only the nexionthat is the presencing of the acausal evident in our psyche and consciousness, but also many othernexions as well.This particular re-presentation is an “abstract” one, as distinct from the more “causal” symbology ofThe Tree of Wyrd (and of the septenary system itself).The Star Game exists in two basic forms: the “simple form” and the “advanced” form, and one of itsaims is to develope acausal-thinking (beyond causal abstractions) and thus skill in five-dimensional magick.It can also be played as a “game”, akin to a chess, and can be used magickally, to presence acausalenergies. The basics of The Star Game are described in the ONA MS NAOS.Traditional Satanism:A term, first used by the ONA several decades ago, to describe its own Sinister and Septenary Way,and to distinguish it from the other types of “Satanism” (such as those of Lavey and Aquino) whichwere once given public prominence.The term was used to describe the ONA due to the aural, and other, teachings of the ONA: many ofwhich teachings (such as the Septenary system and Esoteric Chant; legends and myths regardingBaphomet and The Dark Gods; and Satanism as an individual Way of personal and Aeonic evolution)were handed down aurally by reclusive sinister Adepts over many centuries."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The term “Traditional Satanism” has since been appropriated by others, some of whom have attemptedto redefine it.Tree of Wyrd:The Tree of Wyrd, as conventionally described (”drawn”) and with its correspondences andassociations and symbols (see the ONA MS NAOS), re-presents certain acausal energies, and theindividual who becomes familiar with such correspondences and associations and symbols can access(to a greater or lesser degree depending on their ability and skill) the energies associated with the Treeof Wyrd. The Tree of Wyrd itself is one symbol, one re-presentation, of that meeting (or“intersection”) of the causal and acausal which is a human being, and can be used to represent thejourney, the quest, of the individual toward the acausal - that is, toward the goal of magick, which isthe creation of a new, more evolved, individual.Vindex: The name of the exoteric (or “outer”) nexion through which powerful acausal energies are presencedon Earth in order to destroy the current status quo (the Old Aeon, now manifest in the so-called NewWorld Order) and prepare the way for - and inaugurate the practical beginnings of - the New Aeon.Like Falcifer (q.v.), Vindex can be presenced (”manifest”) in an individual (who may be male orfemale). If an individual, Vindex is the embodiment of The Law of the New Aeon, which is personalhonour [See the ONA MSS The Law of the New Aeon and Tyrannies End: Anarchy, Magick and theLaw of Personal Honour].Used as the exoteric name of an individual, Vindex means “the Avenger”, and while it is traditionally(and semantically) regarded as a male name, with the Anglicized feminine form being Vengerisse,Vindex is now often used to refer to either the man or the woman who is or who becomes the nexion.ONA119yf"}]
