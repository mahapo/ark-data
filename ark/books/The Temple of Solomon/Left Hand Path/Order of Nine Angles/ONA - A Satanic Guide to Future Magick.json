By using only our Will, we can be the indomitable ones destined to carve out the path to the next aeon. By great deeds, we can be the makers of history. All that has led to this point in time can be surpassed - all that has made great warriorship, hero­ism, discovery and creativity, can be surpassed, re-defined and re-expressed. All the gods, all the great figures of our history who spawned gods, can be bettered. We can possess the one real secret guarded by all our past gods: that those gods are but pale imitations of the .beings that we ourselves can become. This secret is the grail that sleeps within the soul of our Western Race, and which so many occult forms have failed to wake. All past gods of the various Western Traditions are rendered obsolete by the forces which Sa­tanism alone is unleashing. These are the forces of cosmic evolution, taking the form of the Ae­onic Magickian. The cosmos is now seeking to discard the tired old gods of our past, and is hun­gry for new expressions, to spawn new forms that will begin the next cycle of history. Fading are the old Earth-bound symbols, giving way to those of acausal dimensions; those nu­minous forms which presence now the Galactic future that awaits. Rising are the chants of the stars, the wordless ceremonies, the living nexions that are worlds apart from the occult, from the old realm of temples, circles and runic readings. The Satanist does not need to study or re-enact the past, and indulge in what has long been es­tablished: he is that past, the present, and the future. And each new willed act is another re­expression of the essence, another re-definition of cosmic meaning -another dis-covering of the potency of life presenced in each one of us. Another reminder that individuals do possess the choice to act or not to act for the greater cause of evolution: that each act can matter, can make a difference ... We do not have to simply consume and pay homage to past glorious deeds; to behave as if we believe history itself has now ceased, or has been rendered the future realm of an officially ap­pointed few. Those appointed few are like the old gods of the past: they exist so that we individu­als can, through adversity, discover our own potential - the potential that is really one potential: that of the cosmos itself. Thus, Satanists do not follow gods. So what then of Satan, that greatly mis-understood living symbol? Satan is not tied to cultural phases, and does not in image represent a once great society. Instead, Satan is the timeless flow of the cosmos, seeking existence. Satan is the grail itself, that secret guarded by the inadequate gods of our past. Satan is the very essence of the striving to become a god - Satan is the arrogance within that en­ables us to leave behind the archaic gods, and to find the courage to be the new gods. Satan is how we live, how we die, and how we shall be after causal life. Satan is the word that when invoked presences the very essence of our striving and defiance. As a living Being, Satan desires new life, new expression, and the constant surpassing of each"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"shadowy archetype created to represent Him. As living Beings, when we are living right, we are Satan -both as individuals and collectively, as the new species of Human that is yet to be. Let us stop grovelling to old archetypes, stop forming fan-clubs for the Old Ones, and discard the superstition and academia that is so precious and so useless. We possess the creative genius to set in motion new Earth-shattering forms, and the arrogance to behave as the embodiment of the future that we, in essence, are. The future implies an upward surge away from the near medieval times we still live in, and in this becoming of evolution, we do not need to seek answers from any­where but within ourselves. The future gods bear our names ... II The Forbidden Alchemy One of the long-term aims of the Dark Tradition is to bring to consciousness for the majority the reality of the Force that is Satan. This 'dis-covering' will result in the upward evolutionary surge known as the 'New Aeon'. A magickal Order, such as the ONA, is only one of several forms by which Satan is presenced­and presenced in the most undiluted of ways, without the obstruction of mortal fears. In one sense, all genuine sinister orders are an invokation to Satan: they constitute in themselves a magickal ritual, with each member understanding the conditions required if the long-term goal of the rite is to be attained. This magickal ritual, being founded upon the uncompromising princi­ples of Nature, contains within it spontaneous or unknown factors which defy the imposition of abstract dogma. By this magickal ritual the unique creativity, the uniqueness of Being possesed by each Adept, is allowed to develope of itself. But Traditional Satanists also understand that uniqueness of Being to be the Will of the Cos­mos itself, and thus certain types of individual creativity are Life made manifest during its course of Evolution - this is to say, in esoteric terms, that certain types of creativity presence the acausal. Practically, the creativity/magick that marks Adeptship is nurtured and expressed by individual defiance· the uniqueness of Being which is Satan. Because genuine acts of magick presence the acausal, the relationship of magick with 'the world' can be said to be \"wholistic\": a relationship where the difference and diversity of Nature and 'forms' exist to enable the spirit (or Being) of the Cosmos to thrive and evolve - ultimately there is nothing which exists external to this continous flow of Change; nothing which can be in­fluenced or changed in isolation. A genuine Adept understands this, and begins to embody in their individual life, this most natural of esoteric paths: the way of empathy. As all genuine sinister magickians are quick to point out, this apprehension currently exists at odds with conventional esotericism. A well-quoted example is the qabalistic approach (as sickeningly influential today as ever) which involves the magickian . or more accurately 'sorcerer' - in viewing the forces of Nature as separate, often barbarous material to be dominated and manipulated for personal ends. A highly evolved esoteric Order would not be characterised by this 'grimoire' approach, since such an approach lacks a binding purpose, a great and clear vision which would enable members to transcend the personal and become the organic whole of a true magickal Order -an Order which is the life of the Cosmos manifested in a conscious way, and pertinent to a particular rna­"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ment in causal time. A profusion of this latter type of magickal Order would be one such result of the New Aeon made manifest. In other words, what could be described as conventional occultism is that which is swayed by abstract theories over observation and intuition, whilst the genuine Western Way - for which read 'the Septenary System', Traditional Satanism, and so on -is concerned with what actually exists beyond li~ited personal forms. In real magick, there is an initial attempt to mimic the flow of natural forces, until an integration is achieved and with it, large-scale Willed Change -that is, con­scious aeonic evolution. Via this process of magick - still the provence of the select few (Satanists of course!) - the Cosmos can progress to its next stage of existence: to live consciously via its mani­festations; to evolve from childhood to adult existence. This is the secret of The Great Work. This path of genuine magick does not involve however the slavish following of some 'cosmic doctrine'/mandate, or any other such dogma. It involves the individual in freeing themselves from all influences in order to live, or become, the reality of the forces of Life itself. Thus the purpose of the Seven-Fold Way: to guide its Initiates towards the attainment of self-insight, where the 'personal' exists as a method to express the Cosmos, and not as a hinderence - through projections ­of the apprehension of Life as a unified whole. The reality can only ever be experienced anew by each Initiate, since this apprehension of Life is a way of Being, and can only, as yet, be partially de­scribed by abstract methods. Thus each new Satanist - and genuine Satanic order -is a new mani­festation of the living essence: thus there is Evolution. lIt Archetypes and the SatJmic Essence A magickal order such as the ONA is not motivated by trends in contemporary thinking, al­though it may on occassion manipulate 'fashion' to provoke an appropriate outcome. All forms ­from magickal systems, to 'Art,' to revolutionary political organisations (etc.) - have a finite life­span, but the criteria by which present-day Occultists often judge forms as 'useful' or 'outmoded' is most usually influenced by temporal trends, by the status quo. One type of essential form so judged is the archetype. As discussed in Order MSS relating to Ae­onics, the life-span of an archetype is not tied to 'linear time', or effected in any way by fleeting trends in society. At the very least, archetypes die when the civilisation to which they are bound dies - when a new aeon becomes manifest. Thus, they are subject to an aeonic/'alchemical' mode of time rather than the abstracted form by which we tend to live our personal lives, since 'time' is simply a measure of the change of Cosmic matter and energy. This aeonic mode of time may also be described as Racial. But even on the cusp of a new aeon, an archetype may spawn offspring -or rather, it may con­tinue to change according to its nature and particular mode of time. This occurs when the ethos of one aeon is continued and evolved into the next, as hopefully will occur during the transition from this present Western Aeon to the next 'Galactic' one. In order to really understand such things as archetypes, one must attain through self-effort, the aforementioned liberation from all contemporary influences -and from those influences which lie outside temporal forms. Most who do not follow the Seven-Fold Way will not achieve those stages beyond 'individuation' because the present concept of 'liberated thinking' or occult understanding"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"is still in itself dictated by the influences that engineer this present sodetJ/culture. With regard to imple­menting the practical, 'magickal' purpose of archetypes, personal 'like' or 'dislike' of one form or another does not necessarily validate or invalidate the reality of that form, and should not provide the basis for making a reasoned judgement of what is, or is not, of aeonic significance (this is par­ticularly true of 'politics' ...). In general, archetypes exert influence upon the unconscious, with mostly indirect results. How­ever, Satan (or perhaps more accurately Satanas) is a numinous symbol, a living, Earth-based mani.­festation of the acausal. As such Satan is that force made conscious, and the gateway through which we as sentient Beings become the Will of the Cosmos. Satan therefore, is the word, \"image\", vibration, chant and deed of Cosmic evolution itself. The 'magick' of Satan and the Dark Gods in general are for us the keys to that Evolution. How present (or past) cultures view Satan is not entirely relevant, and should not be seriously considered by those attempting to form a judgement. Again, the reality has to be experienced. A Sinister organi­sation [and Satanas is the epitome of the Sinister] is imbued with that reality and seeks to increase the Cosmic Tides via its works in the 'real world'. Thus, the \"chaos\" trend of viewing all causal forms as merely means towards the 'Occult' attain­ment of some 'thing' is mistaken, because in this, a purely causal frame of reference - particularly in terms of 'time' -is used to judge that which actually possesses both causal and acausal compo­nents. It must be understood that techniques and forms are not there solely for individual experi­encing/gratification, but rather that such things either express or counter an evolutionary pattern. In this, the understanding of the 'acausal component' is vital. Thus, not all fonns by their causal nature express limited understanding of acausal forces. While some methods are practical tools by which the individual may attain various magickallevels (as in some Insight Roles), others are those forces made manifest in the causal world: that is, the form so created is not a nexion to channel or presence the essence - it is the very essence itself; the essence evolving as it must evolve in causal time and space. This is so because such manifestations possess the greatest capacity to presence the continuous flow of Change that is Life [and signifi­cantly, do not always confonn to coventional 'Occult' expectations: they are viewed as 'exoteric']. That some forms may express things that are culturally understood as 'plebian', primitive, or \"Old Aeon\" is absolutely irrelevant to their capacity to cause aeonic Change. This discernment requires the Satanic qualities of insight, knowledge, intuition and reason. For those unique individuals whose Destiny is tied to such a fonn, there is no living of that fonn while hiding the \"esoteric reality\", the esoteric wisdom -the occult aspect. There is no clever deceit, no skilled manipulation, because the form created is the reality, is that esoteric wisdom made real and practical. This is the domain of Vindex, that much misunderstood embodiment of crea­tive Change. Vindex does not really need 'the Occult' in conventional terms, to presence, or ac­cess the numinous ideals that s/he represents. Such things, in this case, only obscure the essence of Change, of evolution -as they can often distance a person from the creative numen which can and does provoke such an evolution. Because of the nature of human consciousness, we possess the capability to extend and create symbols and forms (such as language, or more simply sound) which could describe the essence it­self. Not all abstract symbols [whether mathematical, magickal or other] need inherently and ulti­mately obscure the essence; and neither is it in their nature -or in the nature of any form for that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"matter - to presence the acausal by purely intellectual procedures. In this we need to understand and integrate with existing numinous symbols in order to spawn completely new forms - this ini­tial confrontation and then synthesis of 'opposites' (in terms of the psyche) allows the necessary organic (and latent) relationship to develope between human life and symbols and other forms. III: Synthesis The majority are still swayed by archetypal forces conventionally described as \"light\" and \"dark\". That there exists a reality beyond such opposites does not mean that those opposites, for the major­ity, do not exist. They exist and exert influence until they are confronted and transcended. A magickal Order understands this, and thus seeks to guide its adherents towards the realms 'beyond opposites' via appropriate ordeals/Grade rituals -that is, via the fires of experience. That some (and they are very few) may attain this transcendence does not mean that such archetypes cease to exist for others, or that the realms beyond opposites are any more 'real'. Each realm, from those symbolised by Initiate to Magus, expresses a reality in the process of Evolution, and cannot be accurately comprehended in linear tenus. In one practical sense, what is \"good\" and what is \"evil\" may be said to exist, since these are the concepts, at this point in time, by which a society views the world - by which life, for the majority, is still influenced. That the definition of moral absolutes may alter over the ages does not itself alter the essence by which they effect the process of human living. This bifurcation still exists because that is the nature of our species at present, as it has been for centuries, despite the many external changes that have occurred, and despite the intellectual mus­ings of philosophers and occultists alike. This is unlikely to begin to change beyond its current pri­mary level until the emergence of the next aeon - some four hundred years from now. Thus a rite such as the genuine Black Mass still possesses real magickal purpose for individuals at a certain level of their development, as well as contributing to the necessary, broader aeonic changes. Such a rite accesses Nazarene/Magian energies and then re-directs them in a sinister way - and, as has been stated elsewhere in ONA MSS, the Satanist does not believe in the reality of \"God\", or the 'divinity' of the Nazarene, only that others so believe. Thus, there is still great relevance in promot­ing and practising a system of genuine \"Black\" magick which aims to counter the works of those who promote and practise magick of the \"White\" variety: in terms of the psyche of the West, a cos­mic battle must still be played out if a synthesis is to be achieved by civilisation as a whole. In eso­teric terms, this is to say that our civilisation has not as yet evolved to the stage of Adeptship. The goal of the Sinister Initiate is to aid this aeonic synthesis, and the methods by which they achieve this for the majority will differ in many instances from those which enabled this achievement for them as individuals. In reality, both an esoteric Black and White Order do exist, but the form that is now conven­tionally understood as \"evil\" is instead the way that will allow the necessary transition to take place, and thus prevent the stagnation and decay that would result from the triumph of Magian forces [as presenced by the \"White\" Order). In the most profound sense therefore, it is the Sinister Path that enshrines what is genuinely divine and life-enhancing... In this very real Cosmic battle, Satan does not feature as some Judaeo-Nazarene device to op­"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"press 'the Folk', but as a numinous symbol for our civilisation, of all that defies the counter­evolutionary force of the Magian. What is rarely expressed, however, is that such counter­evolutionary forces are part of the process of Cosmic Change, part of the Wyrd of Western civilisa­tion. For without such opposition there is no real evolution, no Triumph of the Will-and no Life. Thus to oppose such counter-evolutionary forces is to positively aid aeonic evolution and bring the intergration with Nature so often sought by those who follow an Occult way. It has been often said that 'opposition' and the identifying of enemy forces (sometimes mistak­enly described as \"scapegoats\") is now counter-evolutionary, and somehow \"old aeon\". This is a tragic forgetting of what we, as a Western -or Aryan - Race are, and will always be: hunters and warriors. And it is through the opposition which we do draw to ourselves by virtue of what we are, that we are able to struggle, fight, and thus evolve. If our instincts are still healthy and intact, we will know the forces that are working against us and consequently how to combat them in defence of the Honour of our Wyrd. As practitioners of magick, we must have the understanding to allow those numinous symbols which presence -or 'order' -the wyrd of the aeon to which we are bound, to evolve unhindered according to their own mode of time; to flow with, and consciously become those forces, rather than aid counter-evolutionary powers by allowing limited personal ideas and projections to domi­nate. Real practitioners of Aeonic magick do not project their own understanding onto the society of their time, as they do not seek in their practises to elevate the understanding of their contem­pories by willful self-expression. Changes in the collective psyche will take much longer than one lifetime, and will instead swell in waves, over Aeons. Thus, a genuine practitioner of Aeonic magick works with the raw materials and possibilities that characterise the society of their time: they do not work beyond practical boundaries. And in this, importantly, an Aeonic magickian is not swayed solely by the desire to witness the fruits of their understanding in their own personal lifetime; they plan for centuries ahead, and embody in their Being the slowness of evolution, the Wisdom ofAges ... /Vi Eira For the occultist, the great curse of his endeavours lies in a pronounced capacity to think too much: to over-intellectualise, to analyse -to seek too readily to express practical truths via academic articles, and such like. Ideally, at this stage in esoteric development, a gradual move away from the intellectual approach should begin to emerge, along with an acceptance of the necessity for calV­ing out the future by practical acts. The time for seeking to achieve influence via the written aca­demic word should be waning, replaced instead by the understanding that such a seeking will only have a significant role following the practical realisation of the next esoteric stages -that is, when there is wisdom to distill from new deeds. At this point, there should be a hunger to experience, to pioneer - to re-express the essence. The profusion of occult writings and journals, and pronouncements of organisations, should be viewed by the modern, intrepid occultist with tedium and disdain. There should be presenced"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"within the modem occultist that insatiable desire to speak and create from direct experience; to redefine by extraordinary experiencing those things which have become accepted truths and dusty, arcane lore: to live a hero's life, rather than enter the boring debates over strategy, tactics and history. The above, quintessentially Satanic attitude, is still a rarity. In keeping with contemporary trends, the modem occultist behaves more like the Quantum scientist - allowing the intellect to dominate in the first instance, seeking answers through analysis before a thing has been uniquely tasted and experienced. The worrying trend is revealed in the occassional prefacing of articles with: 'We have observed/seen in others ... \", and then going from there to draw judgements with­out the need to experience what those others have experienced. This is particularly - and disturb­ingly - true of the various approaches to Aeonics. The worrying aspect is that this, the most pro­found of magickal techniques, is becoming a forum for academic debate, analysis and the pro­nouncement of personal opinions under the guise of Insight. Aeonic Magick - the flow of civilisations -is an utterly organic process. It cannot be subjected to academic and personal projections, for that is to make it into something else entirely. As has been constantly stressed, the process requires individuals to lose what is personal of themselves by be­coming completely immersed in practical aeonic forms. There is most certainly a subtle guiding, sometimes a subtle altering of those forms; but there is also, very significantly, a giving up of one­self to those aspects which cannot be controlled, which flow as they flow regardless of individual influence. The nearest analogy to this process lies in the flight of a seagull, as it rides the wind, adapting to a sudden storm; flying in calm weather, but going with the direction of the gales that may dictate a new course. It takes great skill, and the development of a perfect balance between what is individually willed, and what is unfolded by the greater flow of Life itself. Consequently, Aeonics requires the individual to brave the unknown, and forge uniquely from what cannot be pinned down, a new experiencing of the constant, awesome becoming of the Cosmos. We have the practical tools to do this via the various forms, discussed many times, that presently exist in the world. And each new person who really lives those forms, who becomes fully im­mersed so they effectively are those forms, brings to flower something which utterly defies the aca­demic debates and analysis: something new, something living -a storm to change the flow of our lives. Occultists should possess the insight to recognise that point beyond which debate and critical analysis cease to become productive for all individuals, of all allegiances. This is particularly true with regard to aeonic forms which are still growing, still in their early stages. There comes a time when the organic process of Change as a whole must be left alone to develope of itself, and personal ob­jections of a thing are silenced. Occultists must be aware of the need to create conditions by which the necessary process of thesis - antithesis - synthesis, inherent within all aeonic forms, can flourish. This is a slow process - painfully so when apprehended within the time span of one indi­vidual causal life - and requires for its growth a way of Living on the part of individuals. Individu­als cannot be led to this way of Living by the adoption of forceful opinions, as esoteric organisa­tions cannot be built upon such opinions. Again, this insight involves laying aside personal motivations - knowing when to act and when to move with that greater flow of Life. A useful example of a form for which strategical, semantic debate is now becoming counter-productive is that of 'politics' - particularly where Race/Racism is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"concerned. Such things are still not understood on a rudimentary level let alone on an aeonic one, and are still too practically nascent to be subject to the lofty criticisms of the esoteric com­mentator. Therefore it is imperative that a few individuals at least strive to keep alive the promise of magick by being prepared to change their lives (including the 'occult' aspect) in order to seek to become that tool for Change; prepared to suffer the mistakes, the 'loss of face', the real dangers that will assuredly follow. Of those few individuals who have lived thus, all will testify to the pro­found, almost indescribable difference encountered by living and immersing oneself in an aeonic form, as opposed to the overview supposedly gained from literature and observing the experiences of other people. The former is to be an organic part of the dialectic of Life, re-defining, re­experiencing the essence; the latter, a victim and perpetuator of brainwashing. The outer forms of aeonics can always be criticised -but the critical observations are not the point, are not the magick. The point lies solely in the aforementioned dialectic of Life: if the only way of achieving this intergration means that an individual must become for a time a real revolu­tionary fighter, and risk spending some of that time in prison, then that is the only way -that is the harsh choice faced by those who have undertaken the Great Work. However, for the majority faced with making this stark choice, personal feelings still continue to dictate, obSCUring and ulti­mately killing the Will of the Cosmos that is presenced within each individual. This Will is not dictated by personal choice, but is like the wind itself, a sudden reality upon which we must ride if the end goal is to be reached. This is one reason why Traditional Satanists eschew all those estab­lished beliefs and methods which bring comfort, all those old gods who bring familiarity and ener­vating 'identity'. Individuals may sincerely believe that such things, and their histories and ways, are important -but they really are not. So what is the reality? ... Sadly, the only present reality is that life is still too soft, too easy for the majority to be impelled by the terrifying process of Crea­tion. l7r The Future Aeon For the Present, we exist in a society characterised by a 'supermarket' approach of choice and con­sumption, where individuals no longer create history, but look backwards and study, and romanti­cise -and distort. The realm of the Esoteric is no exception to this, and thus it is vital that we as Occultists, as creative individuals, cease to waste our time delving into the folk-tales and legends of past, dead cultures - this includes those of the Norse, Celtic, Saxon, and whatever else passes for conventional esoteric interest. Because to derive esoteric inspiration from the dim and distant deeds of an archetype is a waste of the magickal opportunity that exists now, with the people who exist now and the potential that they can embody in the future. To create and perform rituals based on a dim and distant fireside tale -or employ the symbolism of a past communal life-style -is a counter-productive [in aeonic terms] indulgence. A 'culture' is, magickally, unimportant. What matters is civilisation -or more precisely, the living, evolving force that moves a civilisation forwards, and which is in itself embod­ied by that civilisation. In this, the creativity of an associated culture is only of relevance if it presences this living, moving force."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"When we enter a place of enigmatic 'historical interest', such as an old settlement or stone cir­cle, we do not need to psychically unravel -or seek to re-enact - the secrets of a past community: we who live now are those secrets, we are that enigma. We must only tap into the genius of our creatvity and flow forwards, leaving the monuments, the ruins - the dead shells· where they be­long. Ifthere is a message locked within the unknown dolmen, it is this. However, to use the form of an ancient or old archetype for the purpose of doing something with that archetype in the world is another matter. But this implies re-presenting such an arche­type as the hero of a new mythos - a mythos entirely representational of the current aeonic phase, and by that token one which allows the next phase to be reached. Thus, a new mythos would feature an established archetype committing great acts of nobility (and great acts of terror), the nature and form of which would inspire and liberate the 'modern masses'. The magick of the archetype would be in its living now in the real world, rather than hav­ing existed in some ethereal realm of the past; a past when the manifestation of Human life was, in many respects, very different to today. These differences lie in what is and what is not practi­cally needed in order for the people of modern Western' society to feel inspired towards overcom­ing the problems, self-imposed and otherwise, of their day-to-day existence. The deeds of this archetype could be a re-presentation of those acts committed by a real-life, modem day hero (such as a Satanist) -or the creation of a new legend, the practical basis of which has yet to occur, therefore inspiring individuals to bring it to life in the causal world ... The ways and methods of this powerful magickal technique are legion. What is rarely considered by 'pagans' and occultists alike, is how archetypes organically change as a civilisation organically changes according to its various cultural, political and historical phases. For the West, one of our primary archetypes is that of the Warrior. As long as we as a Race continue to live, this archetype will never cease to be relevant: it will never die. However, the form by which this archetype exerts its influence on a Folk alwa,s changes according to the develop­ment of those things which aid racial survival. It is this latter form of development which defines the work of an Aeonic magickian, and not, as previously stated, temporary intellectual trends/ fashion. Thor, for example, was once a real, living individual tied to a Folk Community, who achieved immortality and 'god status' by doing great heroic deeds. These deeds provided inspiration for that Folk to practically emulate those deeds -and perhaps even surpass them. But, as stated above, we as a Folk have since moved into an entirely different set of circumstances to those which per­tained to a particular phase in Norse history. In order to effectively deal with the evolutionary problems of toda\" we need an archetype that we can realistically and practically follow in deed. This new warrior archetype has, within the scope of history, only recently evolved and lives now within the soul of the Western Race. It speaks of the future, and allows the old gods of the past to fade with dignity, as is their desire. And what new form does the Warrior now take? To accept and use this knowledge is to wield real, practical magick· to taste the living fruits of the cosmos. But it is for each potential adept to make their own discovery ... W': TheArt01Future Magick"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The essence of Future Magick is quite simple. It does not involve complicated 'occult' rituals where circles are drawn, implements brandished, and earth-shattering 'words of power' laboriously recited by a 'High Priest'. It does not involve fumigating an indoor Temple with the correct in­cense, or observing the archiac correspondences contained in dreaded books of dead things. It does not involve a group of robed individuals standing in a circle and observing some ancient tradition, or beating drums in worship of some lovely celestial goddess and some virile horned god. All such obvious occult trappings are now ephemera, and fundamentally, are of the past. It is not surprising that the practise of such things is growing, since we live in a time when all commu­nal traditions, all senses of spiritual meaning are fading or are being destroyed. But there are no secrets contained in the past - no message from the mists of time to guide us forward. AB previously stated, we who live now are the message of our future evolution: all that has happened throughout the aeons has led to this point, and, despite appearences, we as a species know more now than we ever have known. In order to move forwards, we must make this reality a living one, within each and every one of our lives. We must trust in our latent, evolved creative genius and have the courage to discard the romantic trappings we as a species are becoming dependent upon. The Galactic future can be presenced through our magick if we allow it to be. This requires a leap of faith into the Abyss ­into the realm of Satan. All that the new ceremonies require, is for individuals who possess this new aeonic faith to gather at specific times and perhaps light a bonfire which will function as a focus/symbol for the gathering. All else will create itself from there. The specific gathering times -or fests -are as follows: Mid -end of April; Early November; Spring Equinox; Mid - end of May; Summer Solstice; Early - mid August; Autumn Equinox; Win­ter Solstice; Late January -late Feb. These are the times when the seasonal energies/cosmic tides are at their most pronounced. These energies, in themselves unbound by any phase in history, are, in the manner of magick, re­expressed each year according to the circumstances of the celebrating and the broader esoteric changes occurring at that time. Of neccessity a traditional form such as a Nine Angles rite pro­vides the basis for each fest -but such a rite is in itself unbound by imagery from the dead and dis­tant past (qv. Black Book lID. In essence, the 'Galactic' or acausal magick that will presence the Fu­ture, is expressed through chant and thought, and thus brings the living synthesis of Being that each act of magick seeks. This is the magick that has always characterised the meaning of genuine Satanism: the Way of Empathy. The practising of the fests expresses a conscious integration with the living cosmic forces, and reaches the height of expression when woven into the life of a rural community. VIII Fundi A great deal has been written over the years concerning the concept of the nexion, and while the basic meaning is widely understood -that of a nexion being a point where the acausal intrudes into the causal universe (and vice versa) - the outer form that a nexion may take requires some fur­ther explanation."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Firstly, a nexion can take many forms, and may even be a combination of forms. According to very rare conditions, an aeonic nexion may be an individual. Or it could be a revolutionary Relig­ious form. Or, as stated, it could constitute several such forms co-existing in the world in order to bring forth the aeonic transition. However, the standard image is usually that of an isolated, wind-swept hill, which may perhaps include upon it some ancient ruined structures. It is such an isolated place that is usually sought by occultists when attempting to open a gate/nexion. This attempt will most likely involve regular performance at the chosen site of rituals designed to presence the acausal (such as Nine Angles ceremonies, etc. - qv. Order MSS Themn). Thus, a tradition is started whereby a reservoir of ener­gies is created for future Adepts to draw from and direct according to desire. Several such places have been established over the years in the British Isles, with one site in particular having been opened in an area of the Welsh Marches over 1,000 years ago in order to inaugurate the Western Aeon, as has been documented by the Dark Tradition. Thus, the nexion associated with the present Western Aeon was indeed an isolated, genuinely esoteric place. However, it was only thus because of the nature of the times in which it was cre­ated: times characterised by the Nazarene oppression, which demanded an esoteric approach to preserving what we sometimes term as the 'Western ethos'. This was in contrast to the nexion which presenced the Hyperborian Aeon of Albion. This nex­ion existed in the area of Stonehenge. The nexion then was not solely the henge itself, or the land upon which it was built, or the folk who lived and worshipped there: it was a combination of all those factors. The nexion of Albion was the organic whole of the community which grew there; a living, working centre where all the threads of nature and human-kind were woven as one. What can be found at that site now is the dead shell of what was once a living organism - a nexion by which life evolved significantly. Because of the enervating nature of this present time, the nexion associated with the next aeon and which is being established now, is also an organic whole - a community. But this community must in this present age develope covertly, since to openly establish it as an 'occult' venture would be to hinder its slow, natural growth, and turn it into something short-sighted and short-lived: a 'project' attempting to bend the Will of Nature in accordance with a set of accepted 'ideas'. That .is, such a venture would seek to project upon the essence a limited understanding of what consti­tutes the 'esoteric', and would thus represent a step backwards, into that which is already dying. The community instead allows the essence to dictate the ways of living, and remains always separate from 'occult' forums and trends in order that it may presence the future by founding a new organic approach to Life itself. From this slow, aeonic development will come the new forms, the new expressions, the new magick -of themselves, unhindered by any pre-conceptions or ex­pectations, and free from all past and fading archetypes. Thus the community itself will become the new esoteric path; the new religion -the new country. In order to make this next phase meaningful and significant -that is, practical -a leap of faith is required: a breaking away from the established, on all levels. Thus, the spirit of real pioneering is to be invoked, and there is no reason why ultimately this leap of faith cannot be repeated across the diverse regions of the Earth. In establishing this nexion, the cycle that began in Albion will have returned to its new begin­ning. This beginning is in essence quite simple: it is the cultivating of the conscious apprehension"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of the acausality of 'time', from which all else shall follow. Only from these seemingly humble, ru­ral beginnings can emerge the race that will practically extend towards the stars, since both the Will and the form of technology required to fulfil the Galactic Destiny can only develope organi­cally from revolutionary organic beginnings and methods. The hidden, outwardly 'non-esoteric' community will be this new beginning, and must subse­quently be nurtured in such a way that it flourishes for at least 1,000 years. This new form signi­fies the closing of all that outwardly consitutes this present age, and is the essence itself, not merely a vehicle for the expression of the essence. It is a combination of both causal and acausal: it is a liv­ing nexion - the next stage, made practical, in our evolution. What is described above represents the essence of magick. VII: Addendum And so in this, and in other ONA writings, the practical meaning of Magick is explicated -all that is now required of sinister esoteric Orders and individuals is the Will to make the meaning a real­ity. Thus, in conclusion, the magickal aims of a genuine sinister organisation should be as follows: 1) To continue to maintain the existing Tradition by diseminating the various teachings and methods [as published in MSS such as Codex Saerus, Naos and others]. 2) To practically aid those 'exoteric' forms which will bring the New Aeon. 3) To extend the Tradition by creating new forms of the sinister. These would include Artistic [musick/images/writing]; 'Magickal' [new ceremoniaVhermetic forms]; and practical, numinous ways of living [as in the creation of an esoteric rural community, or communities - qv. Order MSS Themn]. In Satanism, lies the stuff of modem folk-tales -of future legends; for unlike others, the Satan­ist lives the life and dies the death of a Hero. This is not a claim made lightly. As a consequence of the actions of a few, the next fifty years will witness a Recalling of the devestating Creative force that each individual life can will into Becoming. Though many will dismiss it because they do not have the courage to try, the Way of Satan re­mains, amidst the myriad of 'paths' the essence of the Great Work. Experto credite. And when the works are complete, a Satanist disappears from sight -toward the next stage, leaving aston­ishment, disbelief and many questions in their wake. And then the failures begin their campaign, of distor­tion and lies. Just occassionally, they may hear our laughter. C. Beest/ONA. Revised: ONA 1998 eh.
