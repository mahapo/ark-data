[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Notes on Esoteric Tradition - Cosmic Wheel & Tetrahedron Cosmic Wheel: The Cosmic Wheel is a wordless expression of the destiny of man, and represents that boundless cosmic ordering to which the essence eternally flows. It is a symbol of our potential, of the endless struggle for the evolution of consciousness, and of our unique warrior ethos. It enshrines the Will, determination, and drive required to bring large scale change. It is both creation and destruction; life and death - it is revitalization, and the light of the cosmos. It implies the wisdom inherent in experience, and the experience drawn from great struggles. It is the Star of distant galaxies, and the light to our travels. It is balance - both light and dark, both chaos and order. Yet it is none of these things, and all of these things - it is what lies beyond these things. Above all it represents what is Galactic, or Sinister. The Cosmic Wheel is best represented as silver on black, representing the light of the Cosmos. For ceremonies it should be presented as a banner - particularly outdoors, as a makeshift altar acting as a gateway into unseen existence, in conjunction with a tetrahedron of Quartz. It can also be worn by initiates of the tradition as a ring. The four scythes represent the elements, and the circle the cosmic being. It turns sun-wise, as the scythes cut out all that stands in the way of destiny. It is visualized during Aeonic ceremonies during vibration/chant, and can also aid in the opening of a Nexion."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Quartz Tetrahedron: Tradition holds that the most effective shape for quartz, in accessing the acausal is that of a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular (equilateral) planes. The most basic molecular structure of quartz, actually, is a tetrahedron. The structure - SiO2, consists of one central silicon atom, surrounded by four oxygen atoms. These are referred to as silicate tetrahedra, and are linked at the corners to create the structure of the crystal. Tradition has stated very little to why the quartz tetrahedron is employed in opening a gate to the acausal, but one might deduct that its basic molecular structure does have some effect on why it is effective; as a tetrahedron is simply a magnification of its essence as matter. These structural notes apply only to Quartz Crystal, and are different for other crystals. As noted elsewhere, a tetrahedron should be ground/cut from a large piece of the clearest possible Quartz by a skilled professional. A jeweler who works in quartz might be able to do this for a sizable sum, yet may not have the equipment to grind larger sizes. The larger and clearer the tetrahedron, the better - but one should expect at least some cloudiness or imperfection. Ideally the Quartz should be found or mined personally [for initiates in America the best places for this are in Arkansas. Australia also has an abundance of quartz.], but in some cases this may prove impractical. Each tetrahedron should be passed down to subsequent generations of initiates for use. Its effectiveness relies on many things - the ability of the initiates to perform the chants, that it is continually charged, its unique history, and so on - but the quartz tetrahedron is one of the most useful tools in accessing the acausal and opening a nexion.
